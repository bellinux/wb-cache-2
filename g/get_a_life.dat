5|$|David Mirkin (born September 18, 1955) is an American {{feature film}} and {{television}} director, writer and producer. Mirkin grew up in Philadelphia and intended to become an electrical engineer, but abandoned this career path in favor of studying film at Loyola Marymount University. After graduating, he became a stand-up comedian, and then moved into television writing. He wrote for the sitcoms Three's Company, It's Garry Shandling's Show and The Larry Sanders Show and served as showrunner on the series Newhart. After an unsuccessful attempt to remake the British series The Young Ones, Mirkin created <b>Get</b> <b>a</b> <b>Life</b> in 1990. The series starred comedian Chris Elliott and ran for two seasons, {{despite a lack of}} support from many Fox network executives, who disliked the show's dark and surreal humor. He moved on to create the sketch show The Edge starring his then-partner, actress Julie Brown.|$|E
5|$|On {{his way to}} a meeting, Webber {{goes through}} a red light, and collides with another vehicle, {{resulting}} in him becoming T-boned. Webber is taken to the neighboring Mercy West Hospital, where he is treated by former colleague Dr. Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez), and subsequently discharged. Ferguson finally agrees to the surgery, after constant pleads from Lexie, and makes a start to physical therapy. Lexie returns home to see her sister Dr. Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo) and her new husband Dr. Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey) having sex in the kitchen. Dr. Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl) is at home, begging her husband Karev to spend time with her, but he dismisses her. At Dr. Mark Sloan (Eric Dane)'s apartment, his girlfriend Lexie has moved in, and his bisexual ex-girlfriend Torres walks in on Sloan in the shower. Lexie expresses her concern to Torres about doing this, and she apologizes. Robbins confronts Shepherd, the hospital's chief of neurosurgery, and asks him to run an expensive test to see if Andy has Tethered spinal cord syndrome, which reveals that he has it, and it is reversed through surgery. Stevens notices the girl Dr. George O'Malley (T.R. Knight) saved, Amanda (Shannon Lucio), sitting outside the hospital, and tells her to go <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>life,</b> because O'Malley did not save her so she could be miserable. At the conclusion of the episode, Stevens unites with Karev, and Webber announces that Seattle Grace will be merging with Mercy West.|$|E

500|$|In 1999, {{several of}} the Fox {{executives}} who had disliked <b>Get</b> <b>a</b> <b>Life</b> came to Mirkin and apologized for {{the way they had}} treated the show, stating that they now found it funny. They commissioned Mirkin to write, produce and direct a similarly-themed show of his choice. Mirkin produced a pilot for Jeff of the Universe, a [...] "sarcastic" [...] parody of the science fiction genre. The executives who had disproved of <b>Get</b> <b>a</b> <b>Life</b> had since moved from the Fox Network to Fox Studios, and they liked this new show. However, the new executives at Fox did not, and chose not to air the show. Mirkin often plays clips from the show at the talks he does at colleges; they receive a positive response.|$|E
500|$|Mirkin {{served as}} {{executive}} producer for the series, directed {{most of the}} episodes, wrote several of them, and oversaw the filming and production of them all, {{to ensure that they}} had the correct [...] "tone". The show's production process was lengthy; Mirkin would rise at [...] to film the show, write further episodes from [...] until , and then repeat that the following day. Unlike most single-camera shows, which have around six days to film, Mirkin had to film each episode in two days. He enjoyed doing it, but described it as [...] "not a healthy way to live". Due to the logistics of filming the show, especially its many sets and effects, Mirkin convinced Fox to not film it in front of a studio audience and use a laugh track instead. The show achieved steady ratings in its first season, finishing 92nd out of the [...] listed in the Nielsen ratings. However, for its second season, it was moved from [...] on Sunday to [...] on Saturday and lost the bulk of its audience; it was canceled after that second season finished in 1992. In a 1999 piece about the show's DVD release, Tom Shales praised the show, concluding, [...] "At its best, <b>Get</b> <b>a</b> <b>Life</b> achieved dizzying heights of surrealist farce. At its worst, it was at least amusingly idiotic existential slapstick. <b>Get</b> <b>a</b> <b>Life</b> is a television classic unlike any other. For one thing, most of the others are better. We're not talking Playhouse 90 here, after all. But we are talking riotous nonsense, and that's not to be sneezed at. It's to be laughed at. Hard." [...] A strong cult following subsequently developed, and Mirkin noted that although the show was canceled [...] "ultimately we got the audience I was hoping for and they are super dedicated and passionate to this day." ...|$|E

[...] He sees the video as a collaboration, the video director came up with the vision and Mars added his vision and so on.

500|$|However, {{the general}} feeling {{around the league}} was that the {{punishment}} {{could have been more}} severe. Detroit Red Wings general manager Jack Adams said that Campbell [...] "could do no less" [...] and [...] "I thought he would be suspended until January 1 of next season." [...] Red Wings forward Ted Lindsay, whom the league had disciplined earlier the same season for an incident in Toronto in which he attacked a Maple Leafs fan who had been threatening teammate Gordie Howe, expressed the stronger opinion that Richard was lucky not to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>life</b> suspension: [...] "In baseball, football or almost anything else that much would be almost automatic. I say they should have suspended him for life." [...] Bruins president Walter A. Brown agreed with Adams, saying [...] "That's the least they could do"; Bruins player Fleming Mackell said, [...] "If they had thrown the book at Richard in [...] when he cut Bill Ezinicki and Vic Lynn, it might have stopped him and made him an even greater hockey player because of it." [...] Interest was high in the hockey world; the Detroit Free Press reported its switchboard was swamped with calls.|$|E
500|$|Mirkin was the {{executive}} producer and showrunner for the animated sitcom The Simpsons, during its fifth and sixth seasons (1993–1995). Following {{the end of the}} show's fourth season, most of the original staff members left the show; only Bill Oakley, Josh Weinstein, Conan O'Brien and Dan McGrath remained, and O'Brien soon left to replace David Letterman as host of Late Night. Executive producers James L. Brooks and Richard Sakai hired Mirkin following his exit from The Edge. He had been asked to join the show's writing team when it started in 1989, but decided instead to work on <b>Get</b> <b>a</b> <b>Life.</b> He was a fan of The Simpsons before being hired for the show, and started work in [...] Due to the show's long production cycle, season five did not air until the following September.

500|$|Thompson has {{heavily criticized}} {{a number of}} video games and campaigned against their {{producers}} and distributors. His basic argument is that violent video games have repeatedly been used by teenagers as [...] "murder simulators" [...] to rehearse violent plans. He has pointed to alleged connections between such games {{and a number of}} school massacres. According to Thompson, [...] "In every school shooting, we find that kids who pull the trigger are video gamers." [...] Also, he claims that scientific studies show teenagers process the game environment differently from adults, leading to increased violence and copycat behavior. According to Thompson, [...] "If some wacked-out adult wants to spend his time playing , one has to wonder why he doesn't <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>life,</b> {{but when it comes to}} kids, it has a demonstrable impact on their behavior and the development of the frontal lobes of their brain." [...] Thompson has described the proliferation of games by Sony, a Japanese company, as [...] "Pearl Harbor 2". According to Thompson, [...] "Many parents think that stores won’t sell an M-rated game to someone under 17. We know that's not true, and, in fact, kids roughly 50 percent of that time, all the studies show, are able to walk into any store and get any game regardless of the rating, no questions asked." ...|$|E
500|$|Mirkin {{wanted to}} produce a surreal, Monty Python-esque, single-camera comedy series. He had a {{development}} deal with Newharts producers MTM Enterprises and persuaded them to buy the rights {{to produce a}} pilot for an American adaptation of the British sitcom The Young Ones. The pilot was entitled Oh No, Not Them!, and featured Nigel Planer from the original series, as well as Jackie Earle Haley and Robert Bundy. Mirkin had wanted to cast comedian Chris Elliott in the pilot, but was prevented by Fox, which wanted Elliott for another show. Oh No, Not Them!, in Mirkin's words, [...] "tested through the floor" [...] {{because it was too}} [...] "surreal" [...] and [...] "sarcastic" [...] and was not picked up. Mirkin and Elliott decided to develop a show together, along with Adam Resnick. In 1990, they created the sitcom <b>Get</b> <b>a</b> <b>Life,</b> which was conceived as a dark, surreal, psychotic version of the cartoon Dennis the Menace. The show stars Elliott as Chris Peterson, a 30-year-old newspaper delivery boy who still lives with his parents, and who is increasingly losing his grip on reality. Fox was lukewarm about the idea, but Mirkin convinced them to order a pilot by understating how dark the show would be. The network executives disliked the pilot after seeing an initial run-through, but Mirkin felt that this was because they [...] "didn't get" [...] the show and opted not to change it. The executives enjoyed the finished pilot and it was aired. However, throughout the show's run, the network's initially negative attitude prevailed. According to Mirkin, many of the executives struggled to understand it and objected to the darkness and surrealism of the show's humor, which included the frequent death of Elliott's character, and regularly threatened to shut down production. After its first season, on the insistence of the network, Chris moves out of his parents' garage, attempts to get additional jobs to his paper route, and attempts to get a girlfriend. However, Mirkin and Elliott refused to [...] " [...] the essential goofiness of the show".|$|E
500|$|The album {{opens with}} [...] "Army of Me", a song [...] "so menacing and inorganic-sounding" [...] that, {{according}} to The New York Times, it verges on industrial rock. It is an aggressive technopop song with elements of trip hop. Dedicated to the singer's younger brother, the song's lyrics are, according to Björk herself, [...] "about telling {{someone who is}} full of self-pity and doesn't have anything together to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>life</b> and stand up"; as she sings: [...] "And if you complain once more/You'll meet an army of me!" [...] "Hyperballad", which incorporates a spectrum of electronic and orchestral styles, {{has been described as}} [...] "a love song penned by Aphex Twin". NME wrote that its music [...] "altered from gentle folktronica to drum and bass-tinted acid house"; an attempt to reflect the song's lyrics, which are about [...] "the art of not forgetting about yourself". In them, Björk describes living {{at the top of a}} mountain and going to a cliff at sunrise. She throws objects off the cliff while pondering her own suicide. The ritual allows her to exorcise darker thoughts and return to her partner. [...] "Hyperballad" [...] is followed by [...] "The Modern Things", a song that, in a magical realist tone, [...] "playfully posits the theory that technology has always existed, waiting in mountains for humans to catch up". Interview described it in 1995 as a [...] "spooky tune", noting [...] "the odd scratchings at the end" [...] of the track. In his 2000 book Jung and the Postmodern: The Interpretation of Realities, Christopher Hauke described this effect at the end as [...] "when a record player has reached the end of an analogue, vinyl record and the needle is stuck as the disc continues going round"; and considered this [...] "trick" [...] to be a case of postmodernism, serving as an example of [...] "the relationship between the present and past that pushes conceptualising even further by the inclusion of modern technology and its ambivalent relationship with previous forms." [...] In a startling shift in style, the big band track [...] "It's Oh So Quiet" [...] covers a German composition made famous by Betty Hutton. It has been described as [...] "a palate-cleanser during the course of the record". The last song recorded for Post, Björk has said she decided to include it, [...] "just to make it absolutely certain that the album would be as schizophrenic as possible, that every song would be a shock".|$|E

The protagonist is an ecologist, battling installation of a planned nuclear plant.

Here, Gordimer again pursues the questions of how to integrate everyday life and political activism. New York Times critic J. R.
