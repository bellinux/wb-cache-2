5|$|By early May, the Albanian authorities, {{being unable}} to {{suppress}} the revolt, became willing to start discussions with the <b>intervention</b> <b>of</b> the International Commission.

5|$|Despite its rapid {{gains and}} popular backing, the new {{administration}} was marked by conflicts between the radical wing and more conservative forces, especially {{over the issue of}} land reform. Two successive abortive coups were able to weaken the Government, and its international status was always contested by Russia. After managing to rally a degree of sympathy from Ottoman political leaders, the Revolution was ultimately isolated by the <b>intervention</b> <b>of</b> Russian diplomats, and ultimately repressed by a common <b>intervention</b> <b>of</b> Ottoman and Russian armies, without any significant form of armed resistance. Nevertheless, over the following decade, the completion of its goals was made possible by the international context, and former revolutionaries became the original political class in united Romania.|$|E

5|$|FIFA {{president}} Jules Rimet intervened, {{and eventually}} four European teams {{made the trip}} by sea: Belgium, France, Romania, and Yugoslavia. The Romanians, managed by Constantin Rădulescu and coached by their captain Rudolf Wetzer and Octav Luchide, entered the competition following the <b>intervention</b> <b>of</b> newly crowned King CarolII. He selected the squad personally, and negotiated with employers {{to ensure that the}} players would still have jobs upon their return. The French entered at the personal <b>intervention</b> <b>of</b> Rimet, but neither France's star defender Manuel Anatol nor the team's regular coach Gaston Barreau could be persuaded to make the trip.

5|$|If {{consciousness}} (the mind) {{can exist}} independently of physical reality (the brain), one must explain how physical memories are created concerning consciousness.

40|$|We use the event-study {{methodology}} {{to analyze}} {{the effectiveness of the}} foreign exchange market interventions conducted by the Swiss National Bank (SNB) during the period from 1986 through 1995.

The significance of this e®ect, however, depends on the direction <b>of</b> <b>intervention.</b> In general, the evidence suggests that the <b>interventions</b> <b>of</b> the SNB to strengthen the Swiss franc were more e®ective than its interventions to weaken the Swiss franc.
