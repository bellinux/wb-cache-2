5|$|The geology of the <b>Grand</b> <b>Canyon</b> area {{includes}} one of {{the most}} complete and studied sequences of rock on Earth. The nearly 40 major sedimentary rock layers exposed in the <b>Grand</b> <b>Canyon</b> and in the <b>Grand</b> <b>Canyon</b> National Park area range in age from about 200million to nearly 2billion years old. Most were deposited in warm, shallow seas and near ancient, long-gone sea shores in western North America. Both marine and terrestrial sediments are represented, including fossilized sand dunes from an extinct desert. There are at least 14 known unconformities in the geologic record found in the <b>Grand</b> <b>Canyon.</b>|$|E

As the train runs alongside the <b>Grand</b> <b>Canyon</b> Diorama, the main theme from On the Trail, the third movement of Ferde Grofé's <b>Grand</b> <b>Canyon</b> Suite, can be heard; and as the train runs alongside the Primeval World Diorama, music from the 1961 film Mysterious Island can be heard. Shortly after leaving the tunnel, the train arrives back at Main Street, U.S.A. Station, completing what the park refers to as The Grand Circle Tour.|$|E

5|$|<b>Grand</b> <b>Canyon</b> {{lies on the}} {{southern}} end of the Intermountain West seismic belt. At least 35 earthquakes larger than 3.0 on the Richter Scale occurred in the <b>Grand</b> <b>Canyon</b> region in the 20th century. Of these, five registered over 5.0 on the Richter Scale and the largest was a 6.2 quake that occurred in January 1906. Major roughly north—south trending faults that cross the canyon are (from west to east), the Grand Wash, Hurricane and Toroweap. Major northeast-trending fracture systems of normal faults that intersect the canyon include the West Kaibab and Bright Angel while northwest-trending systems include the Grandview—Phantom. Most earthquakes in the region occur in a narrow northwest-trending band between the Mesa Butte and West Kaibab fracture systems. These events are probably the result of eastward-migrating crustal stretching that may eventually move past the <b>Grand</b> <b>Canyon</b> area.|$|E
5|$|In late Precambrian time, {{extension}} {{from a large}} {{tectonic plate}} or smaller plates moving away from Laurentia thinned its continental crust, forming large rift basins that would ultimately fail to split the continent. Eventually, this sunken region of Laurentia was flooded with a shallow seaway that extended from at least present-day Lake Superior to Glacier National Park in Montana to the <b>Grand</b> <b>Canyon</b> and the Uinta Mountains. The resulting <b>Grand</b> <b>Canyon</b> Supergroup of sedimentary units is composed of nine varied geologic formations that were laid down from 1.2billion and 740million years ago in this sea. Good exposures of the supergroup {{can be seen in}} eastern <b>Grand</b> <b>Canyon</b> in the Inner Gorge and from Desert View, Lipan Point and Moran point.|$|E
5|$|On August28, 1869, {{three men}} deserted the expedition, {{convinced}} {{that they could not}} possibly survive the trip through the <b>Grand</b> <b>Canyon.</b> They were killed by Native Americans after making it to the rim of the canyon; two days later, the expedition ran the last of the <b>Grand</b> <b>Canyon</b> rapids and reached St. Thomas. Powell led a second expedition in 1871, this time with financial backing from the U.S. government. The explorers named many features along the Colorado and Green rivers, including Glen Canyon, the Dirty Devil River, Flaming Gorge, and the Gates of Lodore. In what is perhaps a twist of irony, modern-day Lake Powell, which floods Glen Canyon, is also named for their leader.|$|E

Additional measures have been combined with the alternative operations, where appropriate, to provide additional resource protection or enhancement. The preferred alternative is the Modified Low Fluctuating Flow Alternative...|$|R

5|$|On October 9, 1922, a road {{located in}} the general {{location}} of MT 87 {{was added to the}} Montana State Highway system. By at least 1924, an auto trail known as the Banff <b>Grand</b> <b>Canyon</b> Road ran along the highway in the general location of MT 87. The next year, the highway had been given a graded dirt surface, and was designated as part of the Great White Way auto trail, as well as the Banff <b>Grand</b> <b>Canyon</b> Road. Between 1925 and 1927, the auto trail designations were removed from the stretch of highway near present-day MT 87. By 1937, the main highway had been shifted north of the location of MT 87, and had been numbered as State Highway 1. A road remained in the location of MT 87, although it was unnumbered. This road had also been extended several miles northward to Lyon.|$|E

60|$|Maui is the Valley Isle of Hawaii, and Kauai the Garden Isle; but Lakanaii, lying {{abreast of}} Oahu, is {{recognized}} in the present, and was known of old and always, as the Jewel Isle of the group. Not the largest, nor merely the smallest, Lakanaii is conceded by all to be the wildest, the most wildly beautiful, and, in its size, the richest of all the islands. Its sugar tonnage per acre is the highest, its mountain beef-cattle the fattest, its rainfall the most generous without ever being disastrous. It resembles Kauai {{in that it is}} the first-formed and therefore the oldest island, so that it had had time sufficient to break down its lava rock into the richest soil, and to erode the canyons between the ancient craters until they are like <b>Grand</b> <b>Canyons</b> of the Colorado, with numberless waterfalls plunging thousands of feet in the sheer or dissipating into veils of vapour, and evanescing in mid-air to descend softly and invisibly through a mirage of rainbows, like so much dew or gentle shower, upon the abyss-floors.|$|R
40|$|River float {{trips on}} the Colorado River through Marble and <b>Grand</b> <b>Canyons</b> {{increased}} dramatically {{within the last}} ten years such that the National Park Service has determined to reduce numbers of river trip participants and require all motorized trips to convert to oar-powered trips by 1977. These policies have become major management concerns that are identified as the "motor-row issue. " This study examines the "motor-row issue" which consists of four major subissues: (1) limitation of use, (2) perception of a wilderness experience, (3) user agreement with conversion, and (4) user preference for type of trip. Data were collected with self-administered questionnaires distributed at one pre-trip and four post-trip sites. Results of the study indicate there is not a definitive position of the user population regarding conversion. For example, a strong majority of respondents perceive a wilderness experience, agree that numbers of people should be limited, and are highly satisfied; users are divided in their agreement with conversion policies and preference for type of trip. These results will yield definitive conclusions regarding conversion when the National Park Service defines the "desired" populations of participants through management goals and objectives...|$|R
5000|$|John McPhee {{described}} the geology {{revealed by the}} building of Interstate 80 {{in a series of}} books on the formation of the continent of North America, books that were published between 1981 and 1993 and collected in a one-volume edition in 1998. In [...] "Basin and Range" [...] (1981), he described how the idea emerged in a conversation with Princeton geologist Kenneth S. Deffeyes: [...] "What about Interstate 80, I asked him. It goes the distance. How would it be? 'Absorbing,' he said. And he mused aloud: After 80 crosses the Border Fault, it pussyfoots along on morainal till that levelled up the fingers of the foldbelt hills. It does a similar dance with glacial debris in parts of Pennsylvania. It needs no assistance on the craton. It climbs a ramp to the Rockies and a fault-block staircase up the front of the Sierra. It is geologically shrewd. It was the route of animal migrations, and of human history that followed. It avoids melodrama, avoids the <b>Grand</b> <b>Canyons,</b> the Jackson Holes, the geologic operas of the country, but it would surely be a sound experience of the big picture, of the history, the construction, the components of the continent." ...|$|R

5|$|Ice ages {{during the}} Pleistocene brought a cooler and wetter pluvial climate {{to the region}} {{starting}} 2 to 3million years ago. The added precipitation increased runoff and the erosive ability of streams (especially from spring melt water and flash floods in summer).

5|$|In {{addition}} to this, cattle ranchers who observed condors feeding {{on the dead}} young of their cattle assumed that the birds killed the cattle. This fallacy led to the condor's extirpation {{in some parts of}} the western United States.

5|$|Signage for SR 67 {{begins at}} Bright Angel Point along the North Rim of the <b>Grand</b> <b>Canyon</b> National Park. ADOT does not officially own {{this section of}} road, but it is signed as SR 67. The road heads north as the Kaibab Plateau North Rim Parkway through {{the small town of}} North Rim, {{surrounded}} by evergreen trees. The parkway enters a small clearing before meeting the park entrance, where ownership by ADOT begins. Heading into Kaibab National Forest on a northward path, the roadway is surrounded by a narrow meadow bordered by evergreen trees. As it passes the nearby Deer Lake, SR 67 meets an unpaved National Forest road. The landscape around the route is crisscrossed by these routes as SR 67 makes several turns, turning back toward the north. The highway, with the new name of <b>Grand</b> <b>Canyon</b> Highway in addition to its other designation, makes several turns as it heads north through the woods. It takes a more northwesterly path as it runs through Coconino County. Near its terminus, the road turns back northeast toward its terminus at US 89A in Jacob Lake.|$|E

2500|$|In the 1940s {{and early}} 1950s, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation planned to {{construct}} a series of Colorado River dams in the rugged Colorado Plateau province of Colorado, Utah, and Arizona. Glen Canyon Dam was born of a controversial damsite the Bureau selected in Echo Park, {{in what is now}} Dinosaur National Monument in Colorado. A small but politically effective group of objectors led by David Brower of the Sierra Club succeeded in defeating the Bureau's bid, citing Echo Park's natural and scenic qualities as too valuable to submerge. By agreeing to a relocated damsite near Lee's Ferry between Glen and <b>Grand</b> <b>Canyons,</b> however, Brower did not realize what he had gambled away. At the time, Brower had not actually been to Glen Canyon. When he later saw Glen Canyon on a river trip, Brower discovered that it had the kind of scenic, cultural, and wilderness qualities often associated with America's national parks. Over 80 side canyons in the colorful Navajo Sandstone contained clear streams, abundant wildlife, arches, natural bridges, and numerous Native American archeological sites. By then, however, {{it was too late to}} stop the Bureau and its commissioner Floyd Dominy from building Glen Canyon Dam. [...] Brower believed the river should remain free, and would forever after consider the loss of Glen Canyon his life's ultimate disappointment.|$|R
