50|$|In the EU and U.S. legal {{maximum load}} {{restrictions}} {{are placed on}} weight, independent of manufacturer’s rating. In the EU a tractor can generally have 10 tonne lb on a single axle, with suspension type and number of tires often allowing slightly higher loads. In the U.S. weight restrictions are generally 20,000 lb on a single axle, and 34,000 lb (less than two single axles) on a tandem. The primary factor is distance between axle centerlines, also used to measure bridge formulas. A bridge formula does not reduce axle load allowances, rather <b>Gross</b> <b>Vehicle</b> <b>Weights</b> (GVW), which can affect load distribution and actual axle weights.|$|R

40|$|In recent years, the {{reduction}} of freight truck trips has been a common policy goal. To this end, policies aimed at influencing load consolidation have been suggested and implemented, resulting in higher <b>gross</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>weights.</b> The purpose of such policies has generally been to mitigate congestion and environmental impacts.
