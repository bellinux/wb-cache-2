The wind gust was evaluated by the WMO Evaluation Panel who found that the anemometer was mechanically sound and the gust was within statistical probability and ratified the measurement in 2010. The anemometer was mounted 10 m above ground level (and thus 64 m above sea level). During the cyclone, several extreme gusts of greater than 300 km/h (160 kn; 83 m/s) were recorded, with a maximum 5-minute mean speed of 176 km/h (95 kn; 49 m/s), the extreme <b>gust</b> <b>factor</b> was {{in the order of}} 2.27-2.75 times the mean wind speed.

40|$|Due to the {{small-scale}} and non-stationary {{nature of}} the convective wind gusts usually associated with thunderstorms, there is a considerable lack of knowledge regarding their characteristics and statistics. In an effort to remedy this situation, we investigated in this study a set of 110 climate stations of the German Weather Service between 1992 and 2014 to analyze the temporal and spatial distribution, intensity, and occurrence probability of convective gusts. Similar to thunderstorm activity, the frequency of convective gusts decreases gradually from southern to northern Germany. No further spatial structures, such as a relation to orography or climate conditions, can be identified regarding their strength or likelihood. Rather, high wind speeds of above 30  m s − 1  can be expected everywhere in Germany with almost similar occurrence probabilities. A comparison of the 20 -year return values of convective gusts with those of turbulent gusts demonstrates that the latter have higher frequencies, especially in northern Germany. However, for higher return periods, this effect can be reversed at some stations. The values of the convective <b>gust</b> <b>factors</b> are mainly in a range between 1 and 4 but can even reach values up to 10.

The <b>gust</b> <b>factor</b> is an important parameter for design with the gust speed being routinely used to evaluate the maximum wind pressure acting on structures. This is of special interest when dealing with extreme wind risk assessment at locations where only scarce measurements are available. In the oil and gas industry, the ISO 19901 - 1 (2005) code is the standard approach to estimate the <b>gust</b> <b>factor</b> for offshore structural design. The methodology is based on the analysis of extensive marine data from the Island of Frøya on the Norwegian coast by Andersen and Løvseth (1993).

This is based on the latest developments of the Engineering Sciences Data Unit <b>gust</b> <b>factor</b> model (ESDU, 2003; Vickery and Skerlj, 2005). This model has been further validated by making use of additional storm wind records at various offshore, onshore and coastal locations.
