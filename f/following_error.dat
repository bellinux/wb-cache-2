40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} adjustments of selective attention <b>following</b> <b>errors</b> and {{their relation to}} the error-related negativity (Ne/ERN), a correlate of errors in event-related potentials. We hypothesized that, if post-error adjustments reflect an adaptive mechanism that should prevent the occurrence of further errors, then adjustments of attentional selectivity should be observed only <b>following</b> <b>errors</b> due to insufficient selective attention. To test this, a four-choice flanker task was used in which errors due to insufficient selective attention (flanker errors) and other errors (nonflanker errors) could be distinguished. We found strong adjustments of selective attention <b>following</b> flanker <b>errors</b> but not <b>following</b> nonflanker <b>errors.</b> Moreover, the Ne/ERN amplitude was correlated with adjustments of selective attention on a trial-by-trial basis.

40|$|A common finding {{across many}} {{reaction}} time tasks {{is that people}} slow down on trials <b>following</b> <b>errors,</b> a phenomenon known as post-error slowing. In the present study, we tested a novel hypothesis about the neural mechanism underlying post-error slowing. Recent {{research has shown that}} when task-relevant stimuli occur in a rhythmic stream, neuronal oscillations entrain to the task structure, thereby enhancing reaction speed. We hypothesized that under such circumstances post-error slowing results from an error-induced disturbance of this endogenous brain rhythm. To test this hypothesis, we measured oscillatory EEG dynamics while human subjects performed a demanding discrimination task under time pressure. We found that low-frequency neuronal oscillations entrained to the stimulus presentation rhythm, and that the low-frequency phase at stimulus onset predicted the speed of responding. Importantly, we found that this entrainment was disrupted <b>following</b> <b>errors,</b> and that the degree of phase disturbance was closely related to the degree of post-error slowing on the subsequent trial. These results describe a new mechanism underlying behavioral changes <b>following</b> <b>errors...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{a method}} for {{accurate}} path following for miniature air vehicles is developed. The method {{is based on the}} notion of vector fields, which are used to generate desired course inputs to inner-loop attitude control laws. Vector field path following control laws are developed for straight-line paths and circular arcs and orbits. Lyapunov stability arguments are used to demonstrate asymptotic decay of path <b>following</b> <b>errors</b> in the presence of constant wind disturbances. Experimental flight tests have demonstrated mean path <b>following</b> <b>errors</b> on less than one wingspan for straight-line and orbit paths, and less than three wingspans for paths with frequent changes in direction.

40|$|Previous electroencephalographic {{studies have}} {{identified}} premovement high-alpha {{power as a}} predictor of movement accuracy; less frontal-central high-alpha power is associated with accurate movements (e. g., holed golf putts), and could reflect more cognitive resources being allocated to response programming. The present experiment tested this interpretation. Ten expert and ten novice golfers completed 120 putts while high-alpha power was recorded and analyzed as a function of whether the previous putt was holed (i. e., a correct response) or missed (i. e., an error). Existing evidence indicates that more resources are allocated to response programming <b>following</b> <b>errors.</b> We observed less premovement high-alpha power <b>following</b> <b>errors,</b> especially in experts.
