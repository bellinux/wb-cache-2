5000|$|... #Caption: <b>Fulvestrant,</b> a steroidal {{antiestrogen}} and a drug used in {{the treatment}} of breast cancer.|$|E
50|$|<b>Fulvestrant</b> is a steroid; an alkyl-sulfinyl moiety {{was added}} to the {{endogenous}} estrogen receptor ligand, 17β-estradiol.|$|E
50|$|The PALOMA-3 trial {{announced}} in April 2015 that {{the addition of}} palbociclib was superior to <b>fulvestrant</b> alone for progression-free survival.|$|E
50|$|<b>Fulvestrant</b> was {{studied in}} endometrial cancer but results were not {{promising}} {{and as of}} 2016 development for this use was abandoned.|$|E
50|$|A single oral dose of 8.3 mg/kg ZB716 to mice {{has been}} found to result in an over 160 ng/mL maximal {{concentration}} of the drug in circulation, a level far in excess of the 15.2 ng/mL concentration achieved with subcutaneous injection of <b>fulvestrant</b> in mice. As such, not only may ZB716 be more convenient to administer in humans, but it has far greater bioavailability compared to <b>fulvestrant</b> and may allow for greater systemic exposure and hence therapeutic benefit.|$|E
50|$|<b>Fulvestrant</b> {{is slowly}} absorbed and maximum plasma {{concentrations}} (Cmax) are reached after about 5 {{days and the}} terminal half-life is around 50 days. <b>Fulvestrant</b> is highly (99%) bound to plasma proteins includiung very low density lipoprotein, low density lipoprotein, and high density lipoprotein. It appears to be metabolized along the same pathways as endogenous steroids; CYP3A4 may be involved, but non-cytochrome routes {{appear to be more}} important. It doesn't inhibit any CYP450 enzymes. Elimination is almost all via feces.|$|E
5000|$|The MONARCH 2 {{study is}} {{investigating}} the effectiveness of Abemaciclib in combination with <b>Fulvestrant</b> for women with breast cancer. It is due to end in Feb 2017. In March 2017, results from the MONARCH 2 study indicated Abemaciclib demonstrated superior progression-free survival (PFS) over placebo plus <b>fulvestrant</b> in patients with estrogen receptor positive and HER2 negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer. The study sponsor, Eli Lilly plans to file a NDA with the FDA in Q2 2017.|$|E
50|$|ICI-164384, {{also known}} as N-n-butyl-N-methyl-11-(3,17β-dihydroxyestra-1,3,5(10)-trien-7α-yl)undecanamide, is a steroidal {{antiestrogen}} and a synthetic derivative of estradiol which {{is closely related to}} <b>fulvestrant</b> and was never marketed. It is a silent antagonist of the estrogen receptor (ER) with no intrinsic estrogenic activity and hence is a pure antiestrogen, unlike selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) like tamoxifen. The drug was under development by AstraZeneca for the treatment of breast cancer but was discontinued in favor of <b>fulvestrant,</b> which is very similar to ICI-164384 but is more potent in comparison.|$|E
50|$|Atossa Genetics is {{sponsoring}} a Phase 2 clinical trial, {{on the use}} of <b>fulvestrant</b> administered through a microcatheter into the lactiferous duct as neoadjuvant treatment for ductal carcinoma in situ and invasive breast cancer.|$|E
50|$|ZB716 {{produces}} <b>fulvestrant</b> as {{an active}} metabolite in vivo in mice, with approximately 10 to 15% of the drug being converted into it. As such, most of the effects are likely due to the parent drug.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Fulvestrant</b> is a {{selective}} estrogen receptor degrader (SERD) and was first-in-class to be approved. [...] It works by binding to the estrogen receptor and destabilizing it, causing the cell's normal protein degradation processes to destroy it.|$|E
50|$|ZB716, {{also known}} as fulvestrant-3 boronic acid, is a synthetic, steroidal, orally active {{antiestrogen}} which is under development {{for the treatment of}} estrogen receptor (ER)-positive metastatic breast cancer. The drug is a silent antagonist of the ERα (IC50 = 4.1 nM) as well as a selective estrogen receptor degrader (SERD). It is an analogue of <b>fulvestrant</b> in which the C3 hydroxyl group has been replaced with a boronic acid moiety. In accordance, the two drugs have similar pharmacodynamic properties. However, whereas <b>fulvestrant</b> is not orally active and must be administered via intramuscular injection, ZB716 is less susceptible to first-pass metabolism, and in relation to this, is orally active.|$|E
50|$|Antiestrogens include {{selective}} estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) like tamoxifen, clomifene, and raloxifene, the ER silent antagonist {{and selective}} estrogen receptor degrader (SERD) <b>fulvestrant,</b> aromatase inhibitors (AIs) like anastrozole, and antigonadotropins including androgens/anabolic steroids, progestogens, and GnRH analogues.|$|E
50|$|Some of Pritchard's {{most recent}} {{research}} {{has to do with}} Endocrine Therapy combination strategies for the treatment of HR1/HER2- Advanced Breast Cancer in postmenopausal women. The best sequencing for Endocrine therapy combination treatment has yet to be determined, but there has been much evidence supports some combinations help with first line defense and other combinations work as second line defense. First line therapy for advanced breast cancer patients could either be a combination of <b>fulvestrant</b> and anastrozole or palbociclib and letrozole. Combinations of everoli-mus and extremstane or palbociclib plus <b>fulvestrant</b> are good second-line therapies. With second-line therapy combinations there are some risks for toxicity, which can be controlled by early and regular monitoring.|$|E
50|$|Estrogen {{deprivation}} {{therapy is}} a form of hormone therapy that is used in the treatment of breast cancer. Modalities include antiestrogens such as selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) like tamoxifen, selective estrogen receptor degraders like <b>fulvestrant,</b> and aromatase inhibitors like anastrozole and ovariectomy.|$|E
50|$|ER-X is a membrane-associated {{receptor}} that {{is bound}} and activated by 17α-estradiol and 17β-estradiol {{and is a}} putative membrane estrogen receptor (mER). It shows sequence homology with ERα and ERβ and activates the MAPK/ERK pathway. The receptor is insensitive to the antiestrogen ICI-182,780 (<b>fulvestrant).</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Fulvestrant</b> is {{used for}} the {{treatment}} of hormone receptor positive metastatic breast cancer or locally advanced unresectable disease in postmenopausal women; it is given by injection. [...] A 2017 Cochrane review found it is as safe and effective as first line or second line endocrine therapy.|$|E
50|$|Dr. Love has {{a number}} of patents, {{including}} one for a microcatheter, that can be positioned in the breast ducts through their opening in the breast. A Phase 2 clinical trial, investigates its use to deliver <b>fulvestrant</b> as a treatment for ductal carcinoma in situ and invasive breast cancer.|$|E
5000|$|... Abemaciclib (LY2835219) is in two phase 3 {{trials for}} breast cancer. In March 2017, Abemaciclib {{demonstrated}} superior progression-free survival over placebo plus <b>fulvestrant</b> {{in patients with}} estrogen receptor positive and HER2 negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer {{after the completion of}} the MONARCH 2 global Phase 3 clinical trial.|$|E
50|$|<b>Fulvestrant,</b> {{sold under}} the trade name Faslodex among others, is a {{medication}} {{used to treat}} hormone receptor (HR)-positive metastatic breast cancer in postmenopausal women with disease progression as well as HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer in combination with palbociclib in women with disease progression after endocrine therapy. It is given by injection into a muscle.|$|E
50|$|Such {{conditions}} may {{be treated with}} drugs with antiestrogen actions, including selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) such as tamoxifen and clomifene, estrogen receptor antagonists such as <b>fulvestrant,</b> aromatase inhibitors such as anastrozole and exemestane, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues such as leuprolide and cetrorelix, and/or other antigonadotropins such as danazol, gestrinone, megestrol acetate, and medroxyprogesterone acetate.|$|E
50|$|ERx is a {{putative}} membrane estrogen receptor (mER) {{of which}} little is currently known. It was discovered as a gene transcription signature induced by estradiol that {{is independent of}} the ERα/ERβ and GPER and was identified using the membrane-impermeable estradiol conjugate E2-BSA in the absence or presence of the ERα/ERβ antagonist <b>fulvestrant</b> (ICI-182,780) and the GPER antagonist G-15.|$|E

50|$|The {{drug was}} {{approved}} {{for use in}} the European Union in November 2016 as a treatment for hormone receptor (HR) positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer either in combination with an aromatase inhibitor or, for women who have received prior endocrine therapy, in combination with <b>fulvestrant.</b> In pre- or perimenopausal women, a luteinizing hormone releasing hormone agonist should also be given.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} {{patent for}} Faslodex expired in October 2004. Drugs subject to pre-marketing regulatory review {{are eligible for}} patent extension, {{and for this reason}} AstraZeneca got an extension of the patent to December 2011.AstraZeneca has filed later patents. There is no generic Faslodex available. A later patent for Faslodex expires in January 2021. Atossa Genetics has a patent for the administration of <b>fulvestrant</b> into the breast via a microcatheter invented by Susan Love.|$|E
50|$|MIBE is a synthetic, nonsteroidal {{antiestrogen}} {{that acts}} as a dual antagonist of the ERα and the GPER. It was found to prevent estradiol-induced proliferation of MCF-7 breast cancer cells, an action that was mediated via inhibition of both receptors. The drug was synthesized in 2012. It has been suggested that drugs like MIBE might be superior agents in the treatment of breast cancer compared to current antiestrogens like tamoxifen and <b>fulvestrant,</b> which are antagonistic at the ERα but were found in 2005 to be GPER agonists.|$|E
50|$|Endoxifen, {{also known}} as N-desmethyl-4-hydroxytamoxifen, is an orally active nonsteroidal {{selective}} estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) of the triphenylethylene group that is or was under development {{for the treatment of}} estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. It is also being evaluated as an antipsychotic for treatment of mania and other psychotic disorders. Endoxifen is an active metabolite of tamoxifen and {{has been found to be}} effective in patients that have failed previous hormonal therapies (tamoxifen, aromatase inhibitors, and <b>fulvestrant).</b> The prodrug tamoxifen is metabolized by the CYP2D6 enzyme to produce afimoxifene (4-hydroxytamoxifen) and endoxifen.|$|E
50|$|Similarly to tamoxifen, a SERM, brilanestrant {{shows some}} {{capacity}} {{to activate the}} ER in certain contexts and possesses weak estrogenic activity in the rat uterus, and unlike <b>fulvestrant,</b> which is currently the only SERD to have been marketed, brilanestrant is not a steroid and is orally bioavailable and {{does not need to}} be administered by intramuscular injection. Brilanestrant has been found to be active in tamoxifen- and fulvestrant-resistant in vitro models of human breast cancer. Side effects observed in clinical studies of brilanestrant thus far have included diarrhea, nausea, and fatigue of mostly mild-to-moderate severity.|$|E
