40|$|ABSTRACT: This article {{describes}} (1) the applications for heavy-duty sacks, (2) {{the technical requirements}} for the sacks, and (3) the films and resins used to meet the critical requirements for this industry. It also describes how the technical requirements of the sack are determined. Finally, it shows how gas phase metallocene-catalyzed <b>hexene</b> <b>copolymer</b> {{linear low density polyethylene}} resins are used to produce downgauged sacks with tailored properties {{to meet the needs of}} this industry...|$|E
40|$|Metallocene {{catalysts}} {{have been}} increasingly studied by industry and academic groups, and {{are starting to}} be applied commercially to produce a variety, among which are ethylene/ 1 -alkene copolymers. This study was primarily concerned with ethylene/ 1 - alkene copolymerizations using dimethylsilyl-bis(2 -methyl- 4 -phenyl-indenyl) zirconium dichloride with methylaluminoxane as cocatalyst. The effect of the 4 -phenyl group was shown to greatly increase the polymerization activity of ethylene {{as well as the}} copolymerization of ethylene and 1 - <b>hexene</b> <b>copolymers.</b> The reactivity ratios, used to calculate the necessary feed ratios needed to create a copolymer with specific characteristics were also determined. The molecular weights, melting points, and glass transitions of the resulting polymers were examined. The activities of copolymerizations of ethylene and 1, 4 -hexadiene were found to have a diminished activity compared to copolymerizations of ethylene and 1 -hexene...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{molecular}} architecture {{on the evolution}} of viscoelastic properties during crystallization was investigated using ethyleneâ€“ <b>hexene</b> <b>copolymers</b> manufactured via metallocene (M-LLDPE) and Ziegler-Natta (ZN-LLDPE) processes. Differences in branching distribution were shown to have a drastic effect on the viscoelastic properties near the gel point. It is shown that the branching distribution rather than branch content is the determining parameter for the evolution of the rheological properties during isothermal and non-isothermal crystallization, and for the width of the solidification interval. We developed a partial melting technique for the preparation of stable critical gels of LLDPE whose viscoelastic properties correspond to the intermediate state between melt and solid. Local molecular conformation and crystallinity in these gels were characterized by Raman spectroscopy, which shows that the transition from melt-like to solid-like rheological behavior (physical gelation) in LLDPE occurs at a very low overall crystallinity of less than 5 %...|$|R
40|$|The pendant drop {{apparatus}} is {{the most}} reliable and accurate method of measuring the interfacial tension of polymer melts. In spite of its widespread use, a detailed experimental procedure {{has yet to be}} published. This study examined all practical aspects of pendant drop experiments with viscous polymer melts and establishes procedures for material preparation, syringe diameter selection, experimental protocol, determination of equilibrium, and the most accurate measurement of interfacial tension. In addition, the effects of both drop volume and unstable drops on interfacial tension measurements are discussed. Comparing the surface tension and interfacial tension values for several polyethylene (PE) and polystyrene (PS) resins to literature data tested the effectiveness of the experimental procedure. The values of surface tension of several experimental linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) resins were determined and related to the copolymer structural and material properties. It was determined that the surface tension of the LLDPE <b>hexene</b> <b>copolymers</b> is primarily a function of the chain branching density rather than number average molecular weight. This occurs because the properties of a branched end are believed to be similar to those of a chain end. Therefore, bulk polymer properties of a branched polymer should depend primarily on the concentration of branched ends. Studying the relationship between the surface tension and the free volume of the LLDPE copolymers corroborated the relationship between the surface tension and the branching density. The values of surface tension and surface tension temperature coefficients of the LLDPE copolymers were found to be similar to literature values of linear polyethylene of equal effective molecular weight. However, the findings are inconclusive due to inconsistencies in the literature data. Also, the effects of polydispersity were believed to have caused a significant surface tension reduction and increased the value of the surface tension temperature coefficient in one of the samples...|$|R
