5|$|Interferometric {{synthetic}} aperture radar (InSAR) is a radar technique used in geodesy and remote sensing. Satellite {{synthetic aperture}} radar <b>images</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> geographic feature are taken on separate days, and changes {{that have taken place}} between radar images taken on the separate days are recorded as fringes similar to those obtained in holographic interferometry. The technique can monitor centimeter- to millimeter-scale deformation resulting from earthquakes, volcanoes and landslides, and also has uses in structural engineering, in particular for the monitoring of subsidence and structural stability. Fig20 shows Kilauea, an active volcano in Hawaii. Data acquired using the space shuttle Endeavour's X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar on April 13, 1994 and October 4, 1994 were used to generate interferometric fringes, which were overlaid on the X-SAR image of Kilauea.|$|E

The transformed image is filtered using a Gabor filter with NxM filtering regions. N and M are predetermined positive integers. Feature values <b>of</b> the Gabor-filter <b>image</b> are extracted in respective channels <b>of</b> <b>a</b> freq. domain division layout corresponding to the NxM filter regions of the Gabor filter. Finally the image texture descriptor is described using the texture feature values <b>of</b> the <b>image.</b> In the first step the <b>image</b> <b>of</b> the time domain is two-dimensional Fourier-transformed to be <b>an</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> orthogonal co-ordinate system freq. domain.

Stela 15 shows K'inich Yat Ahk II as a devout practitioner of religious rituals, doing his sacred duty. On the other hand, Stela 12 shows the ajaw as a victorious military chief, defeating enemies and taking captives. O'Neil argues that their presence on the upper terrace of the O-13 pyramid is similar to how the images of previous kings of Piedras Negras were serialized. In addition, both Stelae 15 and 12 include the names of several sculptors and artists, one of whom worked on both stelae. These names are difficult to translate because many are unique when compared to extant Mayan glyphic texts.|$|E
