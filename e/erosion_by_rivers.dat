25|$|The Chocolate Hills are conical karst hills {{similar to}} those seen in the {{limestone}} regions of Slovenia, Croatia, northern Puerto Rico, and Pinar del Río Province, Cuba. These hills consist of Late Pliocene to Early Pleistocene, thin to medium bedded, sandy to rubbly marine limestones. These limestones contain the abundant fossils of shallow marine foraminifera, coral, mollusks, and algae. These conical hills are geomorphological features called cockpit karst, which were created {{by a combination of}} the dissolution of limestone by rainfall, surface water, and groundwater, and their subaerial <b>erosion</b> <b>by</b> <b>rivers</b> and streams after they had been uplifted above sea level and fractured by tectonic processes. These hills are separated by well developed flat plains and contain numerous caves and springs. The Chocolate Hills are considered to be a remarkable example of conical karst topography.|$|E
25|$|A {{variety of}} archaeological {{sciences}} {{are used in}} underwater archaeology. Dendrochronology is an important technique especially for dating the timbers of wooden ships. It may also provide additional information, including {{the area where the}} timber was harvested (i.e. likely to be where the ship was built) and whether or not there are later repairs or reuse of salvaged materials. Because plant and animal material can be preserved underwater, archaeobotany and archaeozoology have roles in underwater archaeology. For example, for submerged terrestrial sites or inland water, identification of pollen samples from sedimentary or silt layers can provide information on the plants growing on surrounding land and hence {{on the nature of the}} landscape. Information about metal artifacts can be obtained through X-ray of concretions. Geology can provide insight into how the site evolved, including changes in sea-level, <b>erosion</b> <b>by</b> <b>rivers</b> and deposition by rivers or in the sea.|$|E
50|$|Calaminarian {{grassland}} is grassland {{where the}} process of seral succession has been halted due to the toxicity of soils containing high levels of toxic metal ions. These habitats may be semi-natural on naturally exposed deposits, or the result of mining, or from <b>erosion</b> <b>by</b> <b>rivers,</b> sometimes including washed-out mine workings.|$|E

50|$|The {{coast is}} {{generally}} a high-energy, dynamic environment with spatial variations {{over a wide}} range of timescales. The coast is exposed to <b>erosion</b> <b>by</b> <b>rivers</b> and winds as well as the sea, so that a combination of denudational processes will work against a sea wall. Because of these persistent natural forces, sea walls need to be maintained (and eventually replaced) to maintain their effectiveness.|$|E
50|$|The {{dawn of the}} Quaternary period had {{large-scale}} glaciation, transforming water {{pockets and}} lakes into unstoppable rivers of ice, which remodeled the topography, scouring and striating the landscape. At {{the end of this}} activity, <b>erosion</b> <b>by</b> <b>rivers</b> continued, forming the Gorge as it is today. The Verdon’s riverbed was scoured for a second time of the accumulated coral and limestone sediments, by a water delivery rate nearing 2000 to 3000 cubic metres per second.|$|E
5000|$|In geology, {{trenches}} {{are created}} {{as a result of}} <b>erosion</b> <b>by</b> <b>rivers</b> or by geological movement of tectonic plates. In the civil engineering field, trenches are often created to install underground infrastructure or utilities (such as gas mains, water mains or telephone lines), or later to access these installations. Trenches have also often been dug for military defensive purposes. In archaeology, the [...] "trench method" [...] is used for searching and excavating ancient ruins or to dig into strata of sedimented material.|$|E

40|$|At time-scales of 102 to 105 years, <b>erosion</b> <b>by</b> <b>rivers,</b> {{landslides}} and glaciers can exceed 5 mm/y. Sustained denudation {{at these}} rates {{is sufficient to}} account {{for many of the}} rapid rates of unloading or cooling that are revealed by geobarometric or thermochronologic studies. Because feedbacks exist among many surface processes, determinations of erosion rates on a few geomorphic processes can be adequate to estimate mean rates across an entire landscape. Rates of fluvial and glacial incision exert a dominant control on landscape lowering, because these rates set the local base level and modulate the flux from adjacent hillslopes. When rates of deformation are sufficiently rapid and sustained, a collisional orogen approaches a dynamic equilibrium or topographic steady state. Due to variations in erosion rates as a function of Late Cenozoic climate changes, such a steady state should be defined at time-scales longer than one climate cycle. During dynamic equilibrium, the geomorphic system displays a predictable configuration of interacting rivers, hillslopes and glaciated process zones. A dynamic equilibrium appears to prevail near Nanga Parbat, Pakistan, and the Southern Alps of New Zealand, where spatial variations in geomorphic erosion rates mimic variations in bedrock cooling rates at time-scales of 106 y...|$|E

5|$|The {{western and}} {{southern}} sides, which {{lie in the}} rain shadow of the central highlands, are home to dry deciduous forests, spiny forests, and deserts and xeric shrublands. Due to their lower population densities, Madagascar's dry deciduous forests have been better preserved than the eastern rain forests or the original woodlands of the central plateau. The western coast features many protected harbors, but silting {{is a major problem}} caused by sediment from the high levels of inland <b>erosion</b> carried <b>by</b> <b>rivers</b> crossing the broad western plains.|$|R
50|$|Khasan is {{the only}} Russian-inhabited {{locality}} {{on the border with}} North Korea. It lies near Lake Khasan and the Tumen River. The border between Russia and North Korea is formed <b>by</b> the <b>river,</b> but the Tumen's course sometimes changes during floods, effectively diminishing the territory of Russia and threatening to flood the settlement of Khasan and the Peschanaya border station. Since 2003, work has been progressing to reinforce the area with rocky soil for protection against <b>erosion</b> <b>by</b> the <b>river.</b> There is an unobtrusive Russian outpost near the border with a large radar array. On the North Korean side of the border lies Tumangang. The closest Chinese town is Fangchuancun.|$|R
50|$|The {{relief of}} the Kashubian Lake District {{was caused by}} several factors: the Scandinavian ice sheet, and river-glacial forms, causing U-shaped valleys.

40|$|Two {{important}} {{features of the}} high slopes at Gushui Hydropower Station are layered accumulations (rock-soil aggregate) and multilevel toppling failures of plate rock masses; the Gendakan slope is selected for case study in this paper. Geological processes of the layered accumulation of rock and soil particles are {{carried out by the}} movement of water flow; the main reasons for the toppling failure of plate rock masses are the increasing weight of the upper rock-soil aggregate and mountain <b>erosion</b> <b>by</b> <b>river</b> water. Indoor triaxial compression test results show that, the cohesion and friction angle of the rock-soil aggregate decreased with the increasing water content; the cohesion and the friction angle for natural rock-soil aggregate are 57. 7 [*]kPa and 31. 3 ° and 26. 1 [*]kPa and 29. 1 ° for saturated rock-soil aggregate, respectively. The deformation and failure mechanism of the rock-soil aggregate slope is a progressive process, and local landslides will occur step by step. Three-dimensional limit equilibrium analysis results show that the minimum safety factor of Gendakan slope is 0. 953 when the rock-soil aggregate is saturated, and small scale of landslide will happen at the lower slope...|$|R
