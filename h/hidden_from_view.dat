5|$|As a {{three-way}} loudspeaker system employing six individual drive units, each Isobarik kabinet has two tweeters, two midrange drivers and two woofers. One driver of each frequency range faces forward; a second tweeter and midrange are {{mounted on the}} top surface of the enclosure, and one bass unit is <b>hidden</b> <b>from</b> <b>view.</b> While the bass units are isobaric loaded, the midrange is mounted in a terminated transmission line. Crossover points are set at 375Hz between the woofer and midrange, and 3kHz between the tweeter and midrange. The upward-firing drivers were designed to aid dispersion and improve the off-axis listening experience.|$|E
5|$|Because the Moon is {{continuously}} blocking {{our view}} of a half-degree-wide circular area of the sky, the related phenomenon of occultation occurs when a bright star or planet passes behind the Moon and is occulted: <b>hidden</b> <b>from</b> <b>view.</b> In this way, a solar eclipse is an occultation of the Sun. Because the Moon is comparatively close to Earth, occultations of individual stars are not visible everywhere on the planet, nor at the same time. Because of the precession of the lunar orbit, each year different stars are occulted.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the fires}} of 1996 to 2003, archaeologists had {{surveyed}} approximately {{ninety percent of the}} park. Dense undergrowth and tree cover kept many ancient sites <b>hidden</b> <b>from</b> <b>view,</b> but after the Chapin V, Bircher and Pony fires, 593 previously undiscovered sites were revealed– most of them date to the Basketmaker III and Pueblo I periods. Also uncovered during the fires were extensive water containment features, including 1,189 check dams, 344 terraces, and five reservoirs that date to the Pueblo II and III periods. In February 2008, the Colorado Historical Society decided to invest a part of its $7million budget into a culturally modified trees project in the National Park.|$|E

5|$|Medieval vernacular {{architecture}} in rural environments {{made use of}} local materials and styles. As in England, cruck construction was used, employing pairs of curved timbers to support the roof; however they were usually <b>hidden</b> <b>from</b> <b>view.</b> In rural areas there was extensive use of turf {{to fill in the}} walls, sometimes on a stone base, but they were not long lasting and had to be rebuilt frequently, perhaps as often as every two or three years. In some regions, including the south-west and around Dundee, solid clay walls were used, or combinations of clay, turf and straw, rendered with clay or lime to make them weatherproof. With a lack of long span structural timber, the most common building material was stone, employed in both mortared and dry stone construction. Different regions used broom, heather, straw, turfs or reeds for roofing.|$|E
5|$|The {{motorcycle}} sidecar missile used in one chase sequence {{was built}} by film staff at Pinewood and used a standard Kawasaki Z900 and a custom made sidecar outfit. The sidecar was made large enough so that a stuntman could lie flat inside. It had two 10 inch scooter wheels on each side, a Suzuki 185 engine and the detached projectile was steered through a small solid rubber wheel at the front. A heavily smoked perspex nose allowed the stuntman sufficient visibility to steer the device whilst being entirely <b>hidden</b> <b>from</b> <b>view.</b> A pincer type lock held the sidecar in place until operated by the pilot via a solenoid switch. The sequences involving the outfit were speeded up as {{the weight of the}} sidecar made the outfit very difficult to control.|$|E
5|$|Skara Brae {{consists}} of ten clustered houses and is northern Europe's most complete Neolithic village. Occupied between 31002500 BC {{the houses are}} similar to those at Barnhouse, but they are linked by common passages and were built into a large midden containing ash, bones, shells, stone and organic waste. Only the roofs, which were probably supported by timber or whalebone, would have been visible from the outside. In each case the stone dressers were erected so that they dominated the view on entering the house through the low doors and there are elaborate carvings of unknown meaning on some of the stones in the houses and passages. A variety of bone beads, pins and pendants and four carved stone balls were also discovered at the site, which was only revealed after a storm in the winter of 1850 ripped away the grass from a covering sand dune. The existing ruins mostly belong to a secondary phase of building with the foundations of the first phase largely <b>hidden</b> <b>from</b> <b>view.</b>|$|E

Females also have a large translucent ovary, situated towards the posterior of the visceral mass.|$|E
25|$|Between Camp Baker and Eden Bridge, the Smith River {{remains in}} semi-primitive state. There are four working ranches, a guest ranch, a hunting ranch, and two subdivisions (each with several seasonally-occupied homes) on land {{adjacent}} to the river, although as of 2009 much development was <b>hidden</b> <b>from</b> <b>view</b> by the geography if the canyon or vegetation.|$|E

25|$|A fire, {{possibly}} {{caused by}} arson, threatened the shroud on 11 April 1997. In 2002, the Holy See had the shroud restored.

An examination of two other similar aircraft showed that the area of cracking was <b>hidden</b> <b>from</b> <b>view</b> by other fuselage structure.|$|E

25|$|Female Nephila {{produce an}} egg-sac in the {{surrounding}} environs of the web to protect their eggs. The eggs are deposited on a silk platform then are covered in loose silk to form a sac.
