5|$|Although it {{is thought}} to have a body-centered cubic crystal {{structure}} from absolute zero to its melting point, high-resolution measurements of the thermal expansion along the three crystallographic axes reveal anisotropies which are inconsistent with a cubic structure. Therefore, further research and discovery <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>area</b> <b>is</b> expected.|$|E
5|$|Since rain only falls as liquid, in frozen temperatures, rain cannot fall. As a result, {{very cold}} climates see very little {{rainfall}} {{and are often}} known as polar deserts. A common biome <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>area</b> <b>is</b> the tundra which has a short summer thaw and a long frozen winter. Ice caps see no rain at all, making Antarctica the world's driest continent.|$|E
5|$|The carbon–fluorine bond is organic chemistry's strongest, {{and gives}} {{stability}} to organofluorines. It is almost non-existent in nature, but {{is used in}} artificial compounds. Research <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>area</b> <b>is</b> usually driven by commercial applications; the compounds involved are diverse and reflect the complexity inherent in organic chemistry.|$|E

5|$|There {{is little}} {{development}} within the main canyon, although the El Toro Creek area is primarily residential. There is also some {{residential and commercial}} development downstream of State Route 73. The concrete channel <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>area</b> <b>is</b> small and undersized for major floods, which caused it to overflow in the late 1990s and again in 2010.|$|E
5|$|After {{aftershocks}} {{from the}} quake had concluded, examination took place, producing a focal {{solution to the}} small events. Movement of these shocks {{was similar to that}} of previous earthquakes around the Azores. For these earthquakes, scientists had determined that the conjugate nodal plane was responsible, seeing shearing on the right-lateral (dextral) side. All faulting <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>area</b> <b>is</b> strike-slip-oriented, and on a rather large scale. Because of this research, information now points towards Azores volcanism being controlled by earthquake movement.|$|E

5|$|After welding, {{a number}} of {{distinct}} regions can be identified in the weld area. The weld itself is called the fusion zone—more specifically, it is where the filler metal was laid during the welding process. The properties of the fusion zone depend primarily on the filler metal used, and its compatibility with the base materials. It is surrounded by the heat-affected zone, the area that had its microstructure and properties altered by the weld. These properties depend on the base material's behavior when subjected to heat. The metal <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>area</b> <b>is</b> often weaker than both the base material and the fusion zone, and is also where residual stresses are found.|$|E
5|$|Although many {{hypotheses}} {{have been}} put forward {{to explain how the}} ketogenic diet works, it remains a mystery. Disproven hypotheses include systemic acidosis (high levels of acid in the blood), electrolyte changes and hypoglycaemia (low blood glucose). Although many biochemical changes are known to occur in the brain of a patient on the ketogenic diet, it is not known which of these has an anticonvulsant effect. The lack of understanding <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>area</b> <b>is</b> similar to the situation with many anticonvulsant drugs.|$|E
5|$|As {{the freeway}} {{continues}} northward, US31 intersects {{the western end}} of M-20 in New Era in Oceana County.

5|$|Blakeney Point, {{like most}} of the {{northern}} part of the marshes <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>area,</b> <b>is</b> part of the parish of Cley next the Sea. The main spit runs roughly west to east, and joins the mainland at Cley Beach before continuing onwards as a coastal ridge to Weybourne. It is approximately 6.4km (4mi) long, and is composed of a shingle bank which in places is 20m (65ft) in width and up to 10m (33feet) high. It has been estimated that there are 2.3millionm3 (82millionft3) of shingle in the spit, 97per cent of which is derived from flint.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{challenges}} in assessing progress <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>area</b> <b>is</b> the number of clinical studies that either do not report {{the gender of the}} subjects or lack the statistical power to detect gender differences. These were still issues in 2014, and further {{compounded by the fact that}} the majority of animal studies also exclude females or fail to account for differences in sex and gender. for instance despite the higher incidence of depression amongst women, less than half of the animal studies use female animals. Consequently, a number of funding agencies and scientific journals are asking researchers to explicitly address issus of sex and gender in their research.|$|E
5|$|Research {{focused on}} four {{individual}} days that accumulated more than 5.9 inches (15cm) of hail in 30 {{minutes on the}} Colorado front range has shown that these events share similar patterns in observed synoptic weather, radar, and lightning characteristics, suggesting the possibility of predicting these events prior to their occurrence. A fundamental problem in continuing research <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>area</b> <b>is</b> that, unlike hail diameter, hail depth is not commonly reported. The lack of data leaves researchers and forecasters in the dark when trying to verify operational methods. A cooperative effort between the University of Colorado and the National Weather Service is in progress. The joint project's goal is to enlist {{the help of the}} general public to develop a database of hail accumulation depths.|$|E

5|$|The mixed {{woodland}} region is a dense forest with {{many species of}} trees, located near {{the tops of the}} plateaus. The forest canopy shades the ground, resulting in a cooler temperature. The canopy also reduces the amount of water evaporation. California black oak, Douglas fir, Pacific madrone, incense cedar, and other plants grow in the {{mixed woodland}}. Shrubs such as Oregon grape, honeysuckle, blue elderberry, and Pacific poison oak also grow here. The soil <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>area</b> <b>is</b> mostly loam.|$|E

5|$|The soils in {{the lower}} part of the Kettle Creek {{watershed}} are highly acidic, deep, and well-drained. A total of 22 percent of the surface rock <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>area</b> <b>is</b> interbedded sedimentary rock, while sandstone makes up 78 percent. The Lower Kittanning coal seam is found in the Kettle Creek watershed. Rock formations in the Kettle Creek watershed include the Huntley Mountain Formation, the Burgoon Sandstone, the Pottsville Group, and the Allegheny Group. The Huntley Mountain Formation is from the Devonian period and the Mississippian epoch. The Burgoon Sandstone is from the Mississippian epoch and the Allegheny and Pottsville Groups are from the Pennsylvanian epoch. The Allegheny Group is the only rock formation in the watershed to contain coal that is economically worth mining.|$|E

5|$|As {{proposed}} by the Admiralty, Moore's plans for the new attack on Kaafjord involved the Home Fleet's aircraft attacking the region over several days. While the fighter aircraft involved in the previous raids had used only their machine guns to strafe German defences {{in order to reduce}} the threat they posed to the Barracudas, it was decided to use some of these aircraft as dive bombers during Operation Goodwood. In preparation, the two squadrons of Corsairs and single squadron of Grumman F6F Hellcats selected to participate in the attack received training in dive-bombing tactics during the period between Operations Mascot and Goodwood. Another new element of the plans was a decision to use Fleet Air Arm aircraft to drop mines near Tirpitz and the entrance to Kaafjord. The mines dropped near the battleship were to be fitted with time-delay fuses, and it was hoped that the explosions of these devices would cause Tirpitzs captain to try to move the warship into safer waters and pass through the minefield at the fjord's entrance. During the period before Operation Goodwood, the Home Fleet's flying squadrons conducted training exercises using a target range at Loch Eriboll in northern Scotland; the terrain <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>area</b> <b>is</b> comparable to that around Kaafjord, and the loch had also been used for this purpose as part of the preparations for Operation Tungsten.|$|E
5|$|In total, 415 {{types of}} plants and 86 species of {{mushroom}} are recorded in the area. A number of local flower types are considered endemic to the Balkans, such as Dianthus deltoides and Allium breviradum. On the other hand, many endemic plants of central and northern Greece grow also in the park, like the Centaurea vlachorum. Moreover, rare species of the forests of Pindus mountains, typical of the lower geological layers, are Minuartia baldaci, Bornmuellera tymphaea, Campanula hawkinsiana, Viola dukadjinica and Silene pindicola. The most important places for the gathering of rare plants are the northern slopes of the peaks of Aftia, Flegga and Kapetan Kleidi. All the above places are very steep and difficult for grazing animals and therefore natural regeneration of the forest <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>area</b> <b>is</b> progressing normally and many rare plants are conserved. The serpentine soil, which is dominant {{in the area of}} the Pindus National Park also favors the growing of rare endemic plant species.|$|E
