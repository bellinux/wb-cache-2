25|$|Starting {{with the}} 2008 National Electrical Code and the 2009 Canadian Electrical Code, listed {{tamper-resistant}} receptacles that address electric shock hazards to children {{must now be}} installed in almost all areas of new or renovated dwellings. According to statistics cited by the NFPA, the code change adds only $40 {{to the cost of}} building an average, 75-receptacle home in the US, yet prevents shock hazards to a child that sticks a single, metal object into the receptacle. The new receptacles are expected {{to reduce the number of}} electric shocks to children because inserting a normal, two-blade <b>electrical</b> <b>plug</b> applies pressure on both sides of the receptacle to open an internal, spring-loaded shutter, but a foreign object fails to do so and therefore does not make contact with the live electrical contacts. However, the device can still be defeated by inserting two objects simultaneously. Despite its weaknesses, the tamper-resistant receptacle is superior to protective plastic outlet caps which must be individually installed on each receptacle (and are a choking hazard when removed), and to sliding covers that children easily learn to defeat.|$|E
2500|$|An early American <b>electrical</b> <b>plug</b> and socket {{was invented}} by Harvey Hubbell and {{patented}} in 1904. Hubbell's first design was a socket which screwed into a lampholder (like the early lampholder plugs), but with a separable plug with pins (...) or blades (US patent 774251). The 1906 Hubbell catalog shows the blade plug with a flush mounting socket for use in wall or floor. Other manufacturers adopted the Hubbell pattern, and by 1915 they were widespread.|$|E

2500|$|Harvey Hubbell had {{patented}} {{the parallel}} blade plug in 1913, and patented a polarized version in 1916. He also patented the T-slot single outlet in 1915, and a duplex T-slot outlet in 1916 both meant {{to take his}} older 1904 tandem and newer parallel plug design. (Single: US Pat. 1146938; Duplex: US Pat. 1210176). Prior to the 1930s, when Hubbell's parallel blade plug received its official rating of 125v (and became the United States' general service <b>electrical</b> <b>plug</b> standard), all of his electrical connectors were used interchangeably on either 120v or 240v. [...] The two blade tandem configuration plug received its official rating of 250v in the 1950s but has been [...] "banned" [...] from use since the 1960s because of its lack of a ground or neutral.|$|E
2500|$|Several early American <b>electrical</b> <b>plug</b> and socket {{arrangements}} were invented by Harvey Hubbell. On 26 February 1903 he filed two patent applications featuring 2-pin plugs and adaptors for using his plugs with existing designs of lamp sockets and wall receptacles. Hubbell's first plug design had two round pins which differed from those already {{in use in}} Europe in that {{the tips of the}} pins had annular detents similar to those of present-day jack plugs to positively retain a plug in its socket. [...] In one patent, US 774,250 a plug was used with a socket which screwed into a lampholder (like the early lampholder plugs). In the other patent US 776,326 [...] the same type of plug was used with various three-way adaptors that could be connected to lampholders or [...] "a receptacle of any ordinary type". Figures 2 and 4 of this patent show an adaptor plugged into {{what appears to be a}} [...] "Chapman" [...] receptacle. Hubbell evidently soon found the round pin design unsatisfactory as a subsequent patent US 774,251 filed on May 27, 1904 shows lampholder adaptors similar to those of his first patent for use with plugs having coplanar (tandem) flat pins. Hubbell's catalogue of 1906 includes various three-way adaptors similar to those shown in the US 776,326 patent, but modified for use with the coplanar flat pin plugs. The Chapman receptacle must have been in general use at the time, as it was the only type of non-lampholder receptacle for which adaptors were supplied. The 1906 catalogue says of the Chapman adaptor: [...] "The device avoids fastening the cords together as is necessary with the ordinary Chapman plug when used for more than one purpose." [...] This suggests that Hubbell's original invention was prompted by his observation of the problem that arose with the use of this sort of receptacle and plug. Gradually wall sockets were developed to supplement those that screwed into lampholders.|$|E
