5|$|On July 24, 1994, the PNA proclaimed Gaza {{the first}} city council in the Palestinian territories. The 2005 Palestinian {{municipal}} elections were not held in Gaza, nor in Khan Yunis or Rafah. Instead, Fatah party officials selected the smaller cities, towns, and villages to hold elections, assuming they would fare better in less urban areas. The rival Hamas party, however, won {{the majority of}} seats <b>in</b> <b>seven</b> <b>of</b> the ten municipalities selected for the first round with voter turnout being around 80%. 2007 saw violent clashes {{between the two parties}} that left over 100 dead, ultimately resulting in Hamas taking over the city.|$|E

5|$|Due to Milan {{winning the}} UEFA Champions League, Gourcuff was {{included}} in the squads that competed in the 2007 UEFA Super Cup and the 2007 FIFA Club World Cup, though he didn't appear in the former match and appeared infrequently in the latter competition. In the 2007–08 Serie A season, Gourcuff struggled for playing time as he was in direct competition with the Brazilian international and 2007 FIFA World Player of the Year winner Kaká. Gourcuff's development and attitude at the club was also questioned by manager Carlo Ancelotti who critically stated that the player had psychological issues. Gourcuff only appeared in 15 league matches for the club starting only four. He scored his only goal of the season on 31 October 2007 in a 5–0 hammering of Sampdoria. On 24 February 2008, after appearing as a half-time substitute, Gourcuff assisted on the game-winning goal scored in the 90th minute by Filippo Inzaghi in Milan's 2–1 win over Palermo. In the final nine matches of the season, Gourcuff was an unused substitute <b>in</b> <b>seven</b> <b>of</b> them. In Gourcuff's final match at the club, he assisted on the final goal by Alexandre Pato in the club 5–1 win over Reggina.|$|E

5|$|Hershey {{began its}} regular season with major {{offensive}} problems. They were outshot in 17 {{of their first}} 18 games, and were held to one or fewer goals <b>in</b> <b>seven</b> <b>of</b> those games. Their 6–10–1–0 start was the lowest total through 17 games since 2004–05, which was the last season they {{failed to make the}} playoffs. After losing their season opener to the Syracuse Crunch, the Bears beat the Binghamton Senators on October 19 despite being outshot 44 to 21. Hershey lost their first home game on October 20, falling 8–7 to the Rochester Americans; the 15-goal total marked the most combined goals from a Bears home opener, up from the previous record of 12 in 1987. Hershey center Ryan Potulny exited the game with an undisclosed injury, and would not return until November 16 after a nine-game absence. The team's defense improved in subsequent games, allowing two goals or fewer in four of their next five matches.|$|E
5|$|In 1905, when Macdonald was 15, {{the family}} moved to the town of Port Hood, Cape Breton. Macdonald {{attended}} the Port Hood Academy. He hoped to enroll next in the Bachelor of Arts program at St Francis Xavier University in Antigonish, but his family couldn't afford to pay for a university education so Macdonald obtained a teaching licence and taught for two years to finance his education. Midway through his university studies, he took another year off to earn money teaching. He completed his final term on credit and was required to teach in the university's high school during 1914–15 to pay off his debt. Macdonald did well at St. FX. He played rugby, joined the debating team, edited the student newspaper and, in his graduating year, won the gold medal <b>in</b> <b>seven</b> <b>of</b> his eight courses. He was also class valedictorian.|$|E
5|$|In {{her first}} World Cup {{races in the}} 2005–06 season, Neuner {{achieved}} average course times; her best result was being fourth fastest in the pursuit race in Kontiolahti. During her first full season in 2006–07, she finished among the top three fastest skiers in 19 of her 24 races and came in fastest <b>in</b> <b>seven</b> <b>of</b> them. Neuner won the 2007–08 Biathlon World Cup with dominating skiing performances. She set the fastest course time in 19 of her 25 races and was second or third fastest in the remaining six. At {{the beginning of the}} 2008–09 season, Neuner had a substantial drop in her skiing times due to a series of illnesses. However, she recovered and set the fastest course time in 14 of the remaining 18 races from January onwards. In the 2009–10 Olympic season, Neuner again started slowly in December, but came back finishing among the top three fastest skiers in 17 of her 21 races. She had her second best winter in 2010–11 when she set the fastest or second fastest skiing time in 90% of her 21 races.|$|E

5|$|Luongo {{made his}} {{international}} debut at the 1995 World U-17 Hockey Challenge in Moncton, New Brunswick, with Team Québec, winning bronze. Three years later, {{he was named}} to the Canadian national junior team for the 1998 World Junior Championships in Finland. He played backup to Victoriaville Tigres goaltender Mathieu Garon, going winless in three appearances with a 3.70 GAA, as Canada finished in eighth place. Luongo became the starting goaltender the following year at the 1999 World Junior Championships in Winnipeg, Manitoba, appearing <b>in</b> <b>seven</b> <b>of</b> Canada's eight games. He recorded a shutout in {{the first game of the}} tournament against the Czech Republic, making 36 saves in a 0–0 tie. He went on to help Team Canada to the gold medal game against Russia, but lost in overtime, surrendering a goal to Artem Chubarov. With a 1.92 GAA and two shutouts, Luongo was given Best Goaltender and All-Star Team honours.|$|E
5|$|Sham, {{who had won}} the Santa Anita Derby, {{was seen}} as the most {{formidable}} challenger to Secretariat in the Derby because of his finish ahead of Secretariat in the Wood and his Santa Anita victory. Coming off the heels of the his victory at the Wood, Angle Light was seen as a threat to win. Angle Light was also trained by Lucien Laurin, along with as Secretariat, and thus Secretariat and Angle Light were coupled for betting purposes. Flamingo Stakes winner Our Native finished first or second <b>in</b> <b>seven</b> <b>of</b> his nine starts during the 1973 season, causing him to be named as a contender. Blue Grass Stakes winner My Gallant and Shecky Greene, who won the Fountain of Youth Stakes, were both trained in Chicago by Lou Goldline, which also resulted in their odds being coupled. Goldline said the two horses were similar and would do well at Churchill Downs because they both liked fast tracks. Impecunious, who was victorious in the Arkansas Derby, was initially entered in the race, but withdrew two days before because of a bruised heel. None of the competing horses had been sired by a previous Derby winner.|$|E
5|$|The {{club was}} unable to {{replicate}} its form in the 1947–48 season, occupying 11th place on its conclusion in May 1948. Despite that, Liddell reached double figures {{with a total of}} 11 goals. He accompanied the club when it embarked on its second exhibition tour of North America. His displays against Sweden's Djurgården, played at the Brooklyn Dodgers' Ebbets Field, and North American teams earned him praise from journalists and gained him 13 goals in 11 matches. In the 1948–49 season, Liddell occupied left back and four forward positions. During his career, he would fill all ten outfield roles, mostly because of injuries to other players. His brother, Tom, became a teammate in 1949 after Liverpool signed him from Lochore Welfare. He never represented the club as a senior. The club finished in eighth in the 1949–50 season, going undefeated for a post-First World War record of 19 consecutive matches. Liddell scored ten goals <b>in</b> <b>seven</b> <b>of</b> those matches, including three braces.|$|E

5|$|The {{system uses}} eight {{lettered}} zones which are divided by major state highways. Each county {{road in the}} system is designated with the zone letter followed by a number. Six of the zones, A–F, are in the Lower Peninsula while the Upper Peninsula is divided into the remaining two, G and H. There have been a total of 66different highways designated <b>in</b> <b>seven</b> <b>of</b> the zones; as of 2015 no E highways have been named. Participation by the county road commissions is optional, and not all counties use the system. One additional highway, H-16, has appeared on state maps since the 1980s {{although it is not}} a part of the system. Of the highways designated, two were removed from the system and later partially restored.|$|E
5|$|Twenty {{nations have}} {{qualified}} for the Cricket World Cup at least once (excluding qualification tournaments). Seven teams have competed in every finals tournament, five of which have won the title. The West Indies won the first two tournaments, Australia has won five, India has won two, while Pakistan and Sri Lanka have each won once. The West Indies (1975 and 1979) and Australia (1999, 2003 and 2007) are the only nations to have won consecutive titles. Australia has played <b>in</b> <b>seven</b> <b>of</b> the eleven final matches (1975, 1987, 1996, 1999, 2003, 2007, 2015). England has yet to win the World Cup, but has been runners-up three times (1979, 1987, 1992). The best result by a non-Test playing nation is the semi-final appearance by Kenya in the 2003 tournament; while the best result by a non-Test playing team on their debut is the Super 8 (second round) by Ireland in 2007.|$|E
