40|$|The use of {{a simple}} {{fluorescent}} nucleoside analogue in detection of point mutations by hybridization in solution is described. Pyrene is placed at 3 ' and 5 ' ends {{of a pair of}} oligodeoxynucleotide probes via a phosphoramidite derivative of deoxyribose with this fluorophore attached at the 1 ' position, replacing a DNA base. Adjacent binding of dual probes containing this fluorophore to a complementary target sequence results in a pronounced spectral change from blue pyrene monomer emission (lambdamax= 381 398 nm) to green-white excimer emission (lambdamax= 490 nm). Optimization of the relative binding positions of the two probes shows that the greatest spectral change occurs when they bind with partial <b>end</b> <b>overlap.</b> In optimum orientation, the monomer emission band for the probes decreases intensity by as much as a factor of seven and the excimer band increases up to 40 -fold on binding a complementary target.

40|$|Orthophoto process {{transforms}} {{a vertical}} aerial photograph {{in to the}} equivalent of traditional map. Yet it retains the advantages of a photograph-virtually displaying actual cultural and land features and the built environment rather than representing those features using symbols and lines. With the development of technology, Digital photogrammetry has started to be used widely in almost all areas about mapping. Especially digital orthophotos which are a photogrammetric products, are being used by lots of private sectors because of theirs easy interpretability. Several photogrammetric software which can be use to generate orthophotos are Leica Photogrammetric System (LPS), PCI Geomatica, Topcon pi 3000, Image Master, Erdas Imagine, VirtuoZo and others. In this study photogrammetric data from aerial photographs was used to generate orthophoto using erdas imagine software. The processing procedure {{of the system is}} described in detail. Sets of measurements (length and width) of selected buildings were obtained. The results obtained from this software are compared with ground survey measurement. The results showed that an accuracy of sub-meter of ± 0. 406 m could be obtained from orthophoto generated using erdas imagine software. Conclusion is drawn concerning the suitability of the software for use in orthophoto generation. Future research is recommended based on two or more photogrammetric systems to comprise both side overlap and <b>end</b> <b>overlap...</b>|$|E

50|$|Also {{known as}} a navel curve or curve, so named because of their curvature. A curved barbell is {{mechanically}} identical to a straight barbell, except for being curved. Curvature on a curved barbell can range from almost straight to circular, with some barbells actually being spiral, with the <b>ends</b> <b>overlapping</b> but separated to allow the insertion of the jewelry. A variation on this design is a J-bar, a slightly curved barbell (sometimes {{referred to as a}} bananabell or banana barbell) with a 90 degree bend near one end, used in vertical navel piercings to position the decorative end of the jewelry more appropriately. They can be either internally threaded or externally threaded.|$|R
50|$|The complex {{morphology}} of {{a natural}} rubber network {{can be seen in}} Fig. 3, which shows the probability density vs. end-to-end distance (in units of mean node spacing) for an ‘average’ chain. For the common experimental cross-link density of 4x1019 cm−3, an average chain contains about 116 isoprene units (52 Kuhn lengths) and has a contour length of about 50 nm. Fig. 3 shows that a significant fraction of chains span several node spacings, i.e., the chain <b>ends</b> <b>overlap</b> other network chains. As the network is strained, paths composed of these more extended chains emerge that span the entire sample, and it is these paths that carry most of the stress at high strains.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{causal link}} between {{disparate}} tropomyosin (Tm) functions and the structural instability in Tm is unknown. To test {{the hypothesis that}} the structural instability in the central region of Tm modulates the function of the <b>overlapping</b> <b>ends</b> of contiguous Tm dimers, we used transgenic mice (TmDM) that expressed a mutant α-Tm in the heart; S 229 E and H 276 N substitutions induce structural instability in the central region and the <b>overlapping</b> <b>ends</b> of Tm, respectively. In addition, two mouse cardiac troponin T mutants (TnT 1 – 44 Δ and TnT 45 – 74 Δ) that have a divergent effect on the <b>overlapping</b> <b>ends</b> of Tm were employed. The S 229 E-induced instability in the central region of TmDM altered the <b>overlapping</b> <b>ends</b> of TmDM, thereby it negated the attenuating effect of H 276 N on Ca 2 +-activated maximal tension. The rate of cross-bridge detachment (g) decreased in TmDM+TnTWT and TmH 276 N+TnTWT fibers but increased in TmDM+TnT 45 – 74 Δ fibers; however, TnT 45 – 74 Δ did not alter g, demonstrating that S 229 E in TmDM had divergent effects on g. The S 229 E substitution in TmDM ablated the H 276 N-induced desensitization of myofilament Ca 2 + sensitivity in TmDM+TnT 1 – 44 Δ fibers. To our knowledge, novel findings from this study show that the structural instability in the central region of Tm modifies cardiac contractile function via its effect on the <b>overlapping</b> <b>ends</b> of contiguous Tm...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT We {{analyzed}} the transcriptome of Escherichia coli K- 12 by strand-specific RNA sequencing at single-nucleotide reso-lution during steady-state (logarithmic-phase) growth and upon entry into stationary phase in glucose minimal medium. To generate high-resolution transcriptomemaps, we developed an organizational schema {{which showed that}} in practice only three features are required to define operon architecture: the promoter, terminator, and deep RNA sequence read coverage. We pre-cisely annotated 2, 122 promoters and 1, 774 terminators, defining 1, 510 operons {{with an average of}} 1. 98 genes per operon. Our analyses revealed an unprecedented view of E. coli operon architecture. A large proportion (36 %) of operons are complex with internal promoters or terminators that generate multiple transcription units. For 43 % of operons, we observed differential ex-pression of polycistronic genes, despite being in the same operons, indicating that E. coli operon architecture allows fine-tuning of gene expression. We found that 276 of 370 convergent operons terminate inefficiently, generating complementary 3 = tran-script <b>ends</b> which <b>overlap</b> on average by 286 nucleotides, and 136 of 388 divergent operons have promoters arranged such that their 5 = <b>ends</b> <b>overlap</b> on average by 168 nucleotides. We found 89 antisense transcripts of 397 -nucleotide average length, 7 unan-notated transcripts within intergenic regions, and 18 sense transcripts that completely overlap operons on the opposite strand...|$|R
50|$|One of the {{fundamental}} goals of most hose clamps is to ensure a tight seal between the hose and the barb, preventing the working fluid from escaping. To this goal, {{they are designed to}} provide even pressure on all sides, with no gaps. An example of this would be wire clamps. An obvious design would seem to be simply having a wire around the hose, one end attached to a nut, and the other end to the screw, and when tightened, pulling the ends of the wire towards each other. However, this will leave a gap where no pressure is applied (underneath the screw), and cause a leak. To combat this, the more complicated and weaker design of having the <b>ends</b> <b>overlap</b> and then be pushed apart from each other is used, as this ensures pressure around the entire circumference of the hose.|$|R

5000|$|Xylem {{serves as}} a chief {{conducting}} tissue of vascular plants. It {{is responsible for the}} conduction of water and mineral ions/salt. Xylem tissue is organized in a tube-like fashion along the main axes of stems and roots. It consists of a combination of parenchyma cells, fibers, vessels, tracheids, and ray cells. Longer tubes made up of individual cells are vessels (tracheae), while vessel members are open at each end. Internally, there may be bars of wall material extending across the open space. These cells are joined end to end to form long tubes. Vessel members and tracheids are dead at maturity. Tracheids have thick secondary cell walls and are tapered at the ends.

40|$|We {{present a}} new {{racetrack}} coil magnet design, {{with an open}} midplane gap, that keeps decay particles in a neutrino factory muon storage ring from directly hitting superconducting coils [1]. The structure is very compact because coil <b>ends</b> <b>overlap</b> middle sections top and bottom for skew focusing optics [2].

For Design-B reverse polarity and identical end design of consecutive long and short coils offers theoretically perfect magnet end field error cancellation. These designs avoid the dead space penalty from coil ends and interconnect regions (a large fraction in machines with short length but large aperture magnets) and provide continuous bending or focussing without interruption.
