60|$|Strictly speaking, {{with the}} tip of the tongue one can't really taste at all. If you put a small drop of honey or of oil of bitter almonds on that part of the mouth, you will find (no doubt to your great surprise) that it {{produces}} no effect of any sort; you only taste it when it begins slowly to diffuse itself, and reaches the true tasting region in the middle distance. But if you put a little cayenne or mustard on the same part, you will find that it bites you immediately--the experiment should be tried sparingly--while if you put it lower down in the mouth you will swallow it almost without noticing the pungency of the stimulant. The reason is, that the tip of the tongue is supplied only with nerves which are really nerves of touch, not nerves of taste proper; they belong to a totally different main branch, and they go to a different centre in the brain, together with the very similar threads which supply the nerves of smell for mustard and pepper. That is why the smell and taste of these pungent substances are so much alike, as everybody must have noticed, a good sniff at a mustard-pot producing almost the same irritating effects as an incautious mouthful. As a rule we don't accurately distinguish, it is true, between these different regions of taste in the mouth in ordinary life; but that is because we usually roll our food about instinctively, without paying much attention to the particular part affected by it. Indeed, when one is trying deliberate experiments in the subject, in order to test the varying sensitiveness of the different parts to different substances, it is necessary to keep the tongue quite dry, in order to isolate the thing you are experimenting with, and prevent its spreading to all parts of the mouth together. In actual practice this result is obtained in a rather ludicrous manner--by blowing upon the tongue, between each experiment, with a pair of bellows. To such undignified expedients does the pursuit of science lead the ardent modern psychologist. Those domestic rivals of Dr. Forbes Winslow, the servants, who behold the enthusiastic investigator alternately drying his tongue in this ridiculous fashion, {{as if he were a}} blacksmith's fire, and then squeezing out a single drop of essence of pepper, vinegar, or beef-tea from a <b>glass</b> <b>syringe</b> upon the dry surface, not unnaturally arrive at the conclusion that master has gone stark mad, and that, in their private opinion, it's the microscope and the skeleton as has done it.|$|E

The present {{study was designed to}} compare the effect of different syringe materials and silicone oil lubrication on the protein aggregation. The stability of a recombinant fusion protein, abatacept (Orencia), and a fully human recombinant immunoglobulin G 1, adalimumab (Humira), was assessed in silicone oil-free (SOF) and silicone oil-lubricated 1 -mL <b>glass</b> <b>syringes</b> and polymer-based syringes in accelerated stress study. Samples were subjected to agitation stress, and soluble aggregate levels were evaluated by size-exclusion chromatography and verified with analytical ultracentrifugation. In accordance with current regulatory expectations, the amounts of subvisible particles resulting from agitation stress were estimated using resonant mass measurement and dynamic flow-imaging analyses. The amount of aggregated protein and particle counts were similar between unlubricated polymer-based and <b>glass</b> <b>syringes.</b> The most significant protein loss was observed for lubricated <b>glass</b> <b>syringes.</b> These results suggest that newly developed SOF polymer-based syringes are capable of providing biopharmaceuticals with enhanced physical stability upon shipping and handling. © 2015 The Authors.

50|$|Both a {{pharmacist}} and a veterinarian, Murdoch {{was aware of}} the risks in reusing syringes. There was a high risk of passing infection from one patient to the next in both humans and animals, unless the <b>glass</b> <b>syringe</b> was sterilized accurately. Wanting to eliminate these risks, and needing more effective vaccination for his animal patients, Murdoch designed and invented the disposable hypodermic syringe, a plastic version of its glass predecessor. Murdoch presented the design to officials of the New Zealand Department of Health, who were skeptical, and believed it “too futuristic”, and {{that it would not be}} received well by both doctors and patients. Development of the syringe was held off for a few years due to lack of funding. Eventually, when he was granted both patents, Murdoch’s syringe became hugely successful, with millions used throughout the world every day. It is not widely known as a New Zealand design, although Murdoch's achievements have been covered in the New Zealand media.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{plastic and}} glass {{syringes}} used for blood gas samples. Most syringes come pre-packaged and contain {{a small amount}} of heparin, to prevent coagulation. Other syringes may need to be heparinised, by drawing up {{a small amount of}} liquid heparin and squirting it out again to remove air bubbles. Once the sample is obtained, care is taken to eliminate visible gas bubbles, as these bubbles can dissolve into the sample and cause inaccurate results. The sealed syringe is taken to a blood gas analyzer. If a plastic blood gas syringe is used, the sample should be transported and kept at room temperature and analyzed within 30 min. If prolonged time delays are expected (i.e., greater than 30 min) prior to analysis, the sample should be drawn in a <b>glass</b> <b>syringe</b> and immediately placed on ice.

40|$|BACKGROUND [...] Although plastic {{arterial}} sampling syringes are now commonly used, {{the effects}} of sample storage time and temperature on blood gas tensions are poorly described for samples with a high oxygen partial pressure (PaO 2) taken with these high density polypropylene syringes. METHODS [...] Two ml samples of tonometered whole blood (PaO 2 86. 7 kPa, PaCO 2 4. 27 kPa) were placed in <b>glass</b> <b>syringes</b> and in three brands of plastic blood gas syringes. The syringes were placed either at room temperature or in iced water and blood gas analysis was performed at baseline and after 5, 10, 20, 40, 60, 90, and 120 minutes. RESULTS [...] In the first 10 minutes measured PaO 2 in plastic syringes at room temperature fell {{by an average of}} 1. 21 kPa/min; placing the sample on ice reduced the rate of PaO 2 decline to 0. 19 kPa/min. The rate of fall of PaO 2 in glass at room temperature was 0. 49 kPa/min. The changes in PaCO 2 were less dramatic and at room temperature averaged increases of 0. 47 kPa for plastic syringes and 0. 71 kPa for <b>glass</b> <b>syringes</b> over the entire two hour period. These changes in gas tension for plastic syringes would lead to an overestimation of pulmonary shunt measured by the 100 % oxygen technique of 0. 6 % for each minute left at room temperature before analysis.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{practice}} of on-ice storage of arterial-blood samples in plastic syringes for delayed analysis continues, {{and the effects}} of storage time and temperature on the measurement of blood-oxygen-saturation values (SaO 2) have not been adequately described. OBJECTIVE: To de-termine the effects of syringe material, storage time, and storage temperature on normal arterial-ized blood gas and SaO 2 values. METHODS: We used a temperature-controlled extracorporeal circuit to “arterialize ” 500 mL of fresh, whole human blood at 37 °C, and we used certified cali-bration gases of 12 % O 2 and 5 % CO 2 to produce normal blood-gas values. From that arterialized blood we took 90 samples and randomly assigned them to 6 groups, until there were 15 samples in each group. The groups were (1) plastic syringe, analyzed immediately, (2) plastic syringe, stored 30 min at 0 – 4 °C, (3) plastic syringe, stored 30 min at 22 °C, (4) <b>glass</b> <b>syringe,</b> analyzed immediately, (5) <b>glass</b> <b>syringe,</b> stored 30 min at 0 – 4 °C, and (6) <b>glass</b> <b>syringe,</b> stored 30 min at 22 °C. RESULTS: Compared to the samples that were analyzed immediately, the PO 2 of the samples stored in plastic syringes for 30 min at 22 °C and at 0 – 4 °C was significantly higher, with a clinically important magnitude of 11. 9 – 13. 7 mm Hg. The PCO 2 of blood stored in glass for 30 min at 0 – 4 °C was significantly lower, although the magnitude of the difference (1. 5 mm Hg) was not clinically im-portant. There were no statistically significant differences in pH or oxygen saturation among the 6 groups. CONCLUSION: For accurate arterial-blood-gas results, samples drawn in plastic syringes should be analyzed immediately. If the analysis is going to be delayed, the samples should be drawn and stored in glass.
