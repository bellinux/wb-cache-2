5000|$|Adiabatic {{shear band}} {{is a term}} used in physics, {{mechanics}} and engineering. Since the 1960s adiabatic shear bands have been studied extensively because of their importance as a failure mode {{in areas such as}} metal <b>forming</b> <b>and</b> <b>cutting,</b> various types of ballistic impact, as well as vehicle crashes. An adiabatic shear band {{is one of the many}} mechanisms of failure that occur in metals and other materials that are deformed at a high rate in processes such as metal forming, machining and ballistic impact. Adiabatic shear bands are usually very narrow, typically 5-500 μm and they consist of very highly sheared material."Adiabatic" [...] is a thermodynamic term meaning an absence of heat transfer - the heat produced is retained in the zone where it is created. (The opposite extreme, where all heat that is produced is conducted away, is [...] "isothermal".) ...|$|E
50|$|Today {{the threads}} of {{threaded}} fasteners (such as machine screws, wood screws, wallboard screws, and sheetmetal screws) {{are usually not}} cut via single-point screw-cutting; instead most are generated by other, faster processes, such as thread <b>forming</b> <b>and</b> rolling <b>and</b> <b>cutting</b> with die heads. The latter processes are the ones employed in modern screw machines. These machines, although they are lathes specialized for making screws, are not screw-cutting lathes {{in the sense of}} employing single-point screw-cutting.|$|R

Rate of burning is controlled by deterrent coatings eliminating precision <b>forming</b> <b>and</b> <b>cutting</b> machines required for surface area control of extruded propellants. Safety was improved by performing most of the {{manufacturing process}} in water. Olin subsidiaries began manufacturing ball powder specification WC846 for [...]303 British ammunition during World War II. Hodgdon Powder Company salvaged 80 tons of WC846 propellant from disassembled [...]303 British military rifle cartridges in 1949 and sold the propellant to handloading civilians as BL type C. The C was to indicate the propellant burned [...] "cooler" [...] than traditional Improved Military Rifle (IMR) propellants. Olin continued manufacturing WC846 for both civilian ammunition and 7.62×51mm NATO cartridges after the war.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is the development, {{identification}} and validation of {{a model for the}} simulation of a thermomechanical multistage production process chain for sheet steels. The process of interest consists of forming (in particular deep-drawing) followed by cutting and heat treatment. For the <b>forming</b> <b>and</b> <b>cutting</b> stages, the complete model is based in particular on a model for thermoelastic, viscoplastic (i. e., rate-dependent) material behavior in sheet steels accounting for isotropic and anisotropic (i. e., kinematic and cross) hardening. This is combined with a model for thermally induced phase transformations in order to model heat treatment. The particular material modeled here is the sheet steel LH 800 (R). This steel has an initially ferritic microstructure which is maintained during <b>forming</b> <b>and</b> <b>cutting.</b> Heating of the workpiece after <b>forming</b> <b>and</b> <b>cutting</b> during heat treatment phase results in transformation of ferrite to austenite. Subsequent air-cooling back to room temperature is accompanied by a second transformation from austenite to martensite. Model predictions for the workpiece behavior during <b>forming</b> <b>and</b> <b>cutting</b> show quite good agreement with corresponding experimental results. In contrast, small discrepancies between the model predictions and experimental results for the change in workpiece geometry during cooling imply that the phase transformation from austenite to martensite in LH 800 (R) is not purely volumetric in nature as assumed in the model. Rather, it results in change in the deviatoric state of stress in the material and a corresponding change in shape of the workpiece. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|Inappropriate {{choice of}} dental implant type in {{relation}} to the detailed structure of bone at the site, and inadequate surgical technique has led to 5 [*]% failure of dental implants worldwide. By using the finite element method, three typical implant insertion scenarios are modelled and evaluated in this chapter. The scenarios are implant thread forming, cutting and the combination of <b>forming</b> <b>and</b> <b>cutting.</b> The bone–implant system is modelled using three-dimensional finite element technique which incorporates realistic material properties in simulating the cancellous and cortical bone. The bone–implant contact is defined using ‘surface-to-surface’ discretisation and the arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian adaptive meshing scheme. In current practice many implant companies recommend thread cutting for normal bone and forming for compact bone so that implant stability can be ensured. Based on the findings of the present study, the combination of <b>forming</b> <b>and</b> <b>cutting</b> may also be recommended for clinical practice because it best matches the specified ideal stress level resulting in positive bone stimulation with minimum resorption. Stress information obtained in these three implant insertion scenarios will advance the understanding of bone response at an early stage of the osseointegration process and primary stability.

40|$|This {{paper is}} in three parts {{describing}} {{the analysis and}} simulation of the grinding process. This first part {{is concerned with the}} generation of the wheel surface by single point diamond dressing. In grinding, the grinding wheel has to be dressed periodically to restore wheel <b>form</b> <b>and</b> <b>cutting</b> efficiency. Understanding the process of generating the grinding wheel surface is important for the control of the grinding process. Generation of the wheel surface is simulated as a single diamond dressing process on a computer generated wheel. The wheel is simulated by grains randomly spaced in the wheel volume. The topography of the wheel cutting surface is generated by simulating the action of an ideal dressing tool as it dresses the wheel. The simulation of the wheel topography takes account of the motion of the dressing tool, grain size, grain spacing, grain fracture and grain break-out. The simulated cutting surface is used for further simulations of grinding. The simulation of grinding using the simulated grinding wheel surface is described in Sections 2 and 3 where a comparison is made of results predicted from simulation with results obtained from experiments. By matching simulated and experimental results, it is possible to explain the relative importance of dressing and grinding parameters...|$|R
