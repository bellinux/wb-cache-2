60|$|The {{effect of}} the shot was very unexpected. One of the bulls was hit, but evidently not in a deadly manner, for {{the motion of the}} boat had {{disturbed}} Leo's aim. Each combatant turned with a look of wild surprise at the <b>interruptor,</b> and, as not unfrequently happens in cases of interference with fights, both made a furious rush at him. At the same moment, all the cows seemed to be smitten with pugnacity, and joined in the attack. There was barely time to get ready, when the furious animals were upon them. Guns and rifles were pointed, axes and spears grasped, and oars gripped. Even the women seized each a spear, and stood on the defensive. A simultaneous volley checked the enemy for a moment, and sent one of the cows to the bottom; but with a furious bellow they charged again.|$|E

40|$|Working memory (WM) {{performance}} is impaired {{by the presence}} of external interference. Accordingly, more efficient processing of intervening stimuli with practice may lead to enhanced WM performance. To explore the role of practice on the impact that interference has on WM performance, we studied young adults with electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings as they performed three motion-direction, delayed-recognition tasks. One task was presented without interference, whereas two tasks introduced different types of interference during the interval of memory maintenance: distractors and <b>interruptors.</b> Distractors were to be ignored, whereas <b>interruptors</b> demanded attention based on task instructions for a perceptual discrimination. We show that WM performance was disrupted by both types of interference, but interference-induced disruption abated across a single experimental session through rapid learning. WM accuracy and response time improved in a manner that was correlated with changes in early neural measures of interference processing in visual cortex (i. e., P 1 suppression and N 1 enhancement). These results suggest practice-related changes in processing interference exert a positive influence on WM performance, highlighting the importance of filtering irrelevant information and the dynamic interactions that exist between neural processes of perception, attention, and WM during learning...|$|R

The Mk. VII and late Mk. X Lancasters used the heavier, electrically-controlled Martin 250 CE 23A turret equipped with two [...]50 inch machine guns which was mounted further forward to preserve the aircraft's longitudinal balance, and because it had an internal mechanism to prevent firing on the aircraft itself, it did not require a coaming.

50|$|When the Ottoman Army {{learned about}} the new Spanish model of 1893, it ordered some 200,000 rifles in the same configuration. Their rifles were {{chambered}} for the 7.65×53mm Argentine cartridge and were identical to the Spanish model, except for a unique cartridge feed <b>interruptor</b> or magazine cut-off, which when engaged permits the feeding and extraction of single cartridges only while keeping the cartridges in the magazine in reserve, which permitted the feeding of single cartridges while keeping the magazine fully loaded. What distinguished the original 1893 and subsequent 1903 Ottoman Mauser was its tangent rear sight calibrated from 200 to 2,000 meters, which was represented not by Arabic numerals like virtually all other rifles, but instead by Eastern Arabic numerals; these numerals would also be used on future Persian Mauser rifles and carbines. Later (and most manufactured throughout the decades of production) Turkish Mauser rifles produced were fitted with rear sights calibrated in standard Arabic numerals. By the late 1930s, most all of these original rifles still in Turkish hands were re-barreled and converted to fire the far more common and powerful 8mm Mauser. Even so, this remains a distinguishing feature of the few authentic 1893/1903 Ottoman Mauser rifles—the ones still chambered in 7.65mm Argentine—still in existence from that period.|$|E
50|$|Overlaps {{can often}} be seen as {{problematic}} in terms of turn-taking, {{with the majority of}} research being between cooperative versus competitive overlap. One theory by Goldberg (1990) argues the dynamic relationship between overlap and power over the conversation by suggesting that two types of overlap are power interruptions and displays of rapport. During conversation, a listener has an obligation to support the speaker. An interruption impedes upon this obligation by infringing upon the wishes of the speaker (which is to be heard). The difference between a power interruption or rapport {{is the degree to which}} the speakers wishes are impeded upon. Rapport interruptions contribute to the conversation in that they ultimately cooperate and collaborate with the speaker in order to reach a mutual goal of understanding. Power interruptions are generally hostile and do not cooperate with the speaker. The goals of the power <b>interruptor</b> are both divergent from and regardless of the goals of the speaker. Power interruptions are further categorized into two types: process control interruptions and content control interruptions. Process control interruptions involve attempts to change the topic by utilizing questions and requests, and because they return control to the original speaker are generally seen as the less threatening of the two. Content control interruptions involve attempts to change the topic by utilizing assertions or statements that are unrelated to the current topic. Content control interruptions are viewed as problematic and threatening since they seize control of both the topic and attention away from the speaker.|$|E

The GUARDIAN incorporates a 250 mW, 532 nm (visible-green) laser which utilizes patent-pending Variable Range & Focus Optics for safe and effective engagement range from 1-1000 meters and Hailing & Warning out to 2000 meters. The GUARDIAN is fully compliant with FDA 21 CFR 1040 Regulations. The DEFENDER incorporates a 450 mW, 532 nm (visible-green) laser which utilizes patent-pending Variable Range & Focus Optics for safe and effective engagement range from 1-2400 meters and Hailing & Warning out to 4000 meters. The STEALTH is a multi-spectral, multi-functioning, weapons mounted laser system that provides the Operator with a Visible Laser Optical Distractor (300 mW), Visible (red or green) Pointer (Hi and Lo powers), IR Illuminator (Hi and Lo powers), IR Pointer (Hi and Lo powers) and White LED Flashlight (150 Lumens). The STEALTH takes the functionality of a GUARDIAN's Optical Distractor, and combines it with an AN/PEQ-15 and also a Tactical LED Flashlight, and combines everything into one compact system to lighten the load of the Operator and have one firing trigger and set of batteries versus three. Unlike all other optical distractors, or [...] "dazzler", systems, which use fixed focus divergence angles, all Dazer Lasers utilize the patent-pending Variable Range & Focus Optics to allow for engagements at ALL ranges, versus being limited to ranges from 10 meters (safety reasons) out to 500 meters (ineffective because beam is too large). Incorporating an auto-shut off does not work in the battlefield as this simply turns the system off; but if the capability is needed at shorter ranges, an automatically shut off system now cannot work and endangers the Operator. All Dazer Laser systems can operate from -20 C to +55 C, are waterproof to 10+ meters for 60+ minutes (model dependent), and ruggedized in accordance with MIL STD-810G requirements.|$|E

The phase angle derived by FFT analysis of the output signal and that given by the slit reading are compared, after which the phase lag is determined and used as the phase angle adjustment for the in-plane component. In routine measurements, the spinning angular speed and the sense of spin remain unchanged for the calibration measurement.|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} decade the flying {{patterns}} and foraging behavior of bees have {{become a matter of}} public policy in the European Union. Determined to establish a system where transgenic crops can `coexist' with conventional and organic farming, the EU has begun to erect a system of demarcations and separations designed to minimize the extent of `gene flow' from genetically modified plants. As the European landscape is regimented through the introduction of isolation distances and buffer zones, bees and other pollinating insects have become vectors of `genetic pollution', disrupting the project of cohabitation and purification devised by European authorities. Drawing on the work of Michel Serres on parasitism, this paper traces the emergence of bees as an object of regulatory scrutiny and as an <b>interruptor</b> of the `coexistence' project. Along with bees, however, another uninvited guest arrived unexpectedly on the scene: the beekeeper, who came to see his traditional relationship to bees, crops, and consumers at risk.

Respiratory mechanics were obtained during ventilatory support with and without the resistor. Airway compression was assessed using the <b>interruptor</b> method. For the study, a turbulent resistor was applied with the highest resistance level that did not increase the end-expiratory lung volume. At this resistance level, external positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) was generated in all patients.

40|$|Abstract. There is {{a growing}} {{interest}} in technologies for supporting individuals to manage their accessibility for interruptions. The applicability of these technologies {{is likely to be}} influenced by social relationships between people. This paper describes an experiment that examines interplay between a working relationship of an <b>interruptor</b> and an interruptee and two different system approaches to handle interruptions. We tested how system behaviour and the social relationship between the actors influence their interruption behaviours. Our results are consistent with prior research on the importance of relational benefit to understanding interruption. We found that interruptors were far more likely to be considerate of interruptees ' activities, when they both shared a common goal. We have extended those findings by showing that interruptees display similar behaviours to those presented by interruptors. The results regarding the systems ’ influence show a clear trend towards the positive effect of the Automatic system on peoples ’ interruption behaviours which is based on: (i) visible interruption costs, (ii) social tension and (iii) system preference. We think that the results of this experiment translated into design implications can prove helpful in informing the design of computer–mediated solutions supporting interruption handling...|$|E

Shocks due to defective wiring in home appliances or other electrical equipment can cause severe burns, even death. As a result, the National Electrical Code now requires GFIs in all new homes constructed. This particular type of GFI employs a sensing element which derives from technology acquired in space projects by SCI Systems, Inc., Huntsville, Alabama, producer of sensors for GE and other manufacturers of GFI equipment. The sensor is based on the company's experience in developing miniaturized circuitry for space telemetry and other spacecraft electrical systems; this experience enabled SCI to package <b>interruptor</b> circuitry in the extremely limited space available and to produce sensory devices at practicable cost. The tiny sensor measures the strength of the electrical current and detects current differentials that indicate a fault in the functioning of an electrical system.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} discourses that {{were present in}} one teacher {{education}} site in Tasmania over a two-year period. This involved both the investigation and analysis of teacher education practices as well as pre-service teachers' responses to such practices. The research is ethnographic, focusing in particular on the discourses produced by Secondary English pre-service teachers {{in the construction of}} their subjectivities. This thesis draws from post-critical writing pedagogy, discourse analysis and feminist poststructuralist theory, arguing that subjectivity is fragmented, multiple and fractured rather than fixed and unitary. The research strongly argues that teacher education practices of personalising experience through the use of the genres of narrative, biography and autobiography constrain subjectivity. Furthermore, researching the personal through teacher research and action research 'focuses on the research process rather than the writing process. This research repositions the personal as a product of discourse, rather than personal experience, by repositioning research as writing (Lee 1995 / 1996, 1998) and discourse analytic techniques as significant in providing Secondary English pre-service teachers with the semiotic space to reconstruct pedagogy. The dominant discursive positions that were made known in relation to the Secondary English pre-service teachers are identified using a grounded theory approach and further elaborated using discourse analysis. The dominant discourses of the teacher education site were also analysed in conjunction with the Secondary English pre-service teachers as part of the emancipatory intention of the study. The initial analysis of data from {{the first year of the}} study resulted in the implementation of an <b>interruptor</b> strategy on subjectivity (McWilliam 1995), through the process of research as writing (Lee 1995 / 1996, 1998), to displace Secondary English pre-service teachers' initial, fixed assumptions of teaching. The deconstructive process of double reading (Grosz 1989; Lather 1996, 2004) as well as collaborative rewriting practices, worked towards displacing, repositioning and in the process redesigning subjectivity and pedagogy. Reciprocity is positioned as a critical and productive part of the study in the displacement and repositioning of subjectivity...|$|E

METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study involving 38 children and adolescents with CF followed at the Cystic Fibrosis Outpatient Clinic of the São Lucas Hospital, located in the city of Porto Alegre, Brazil. After Rint had been measured, the subjects underwent spirometry. To evaluate bronchodilator response, we repeated the measurements after the use of inhaled albuterol. RESULTS: There was a strong correlation between inverse Rint and FEV 1 (r = 0. 8; p < 0. 001), and there was a moderate correlation between inverse Rint and FEF 25 - 75 % (r = 0. 74; p < 0. 001), as well as between inverse Rint and body mass index (r = 0. 62; p < 0. 001). We used a ROC curve to compare the bronchodilator response, as determined by Rint, with spirometric values. For a Rint cut-off point of - 28 %, the area under the curve was 0. 75, with a sensitivity of 66 % and a specificity of 82 %.

MÉTODOS: A técnica Rint foi realizada com os pacientes em posição sentada, em expiração, utilizando clipe nasal e com suporte das bochechas. O exame pletismográfico foi realizado de acordo com protocolos padronizados. As medidas foram realizadas antes e após a administração inalatória de um broncodilatador via spray dosimetrado com espaçador. RESULTADOS: Avaliamos 99 pacientes consecutivos encaminhados para o Hospital de Clínicas de Porto Alegre, Porto Alegre (RS), para a realização de testes de função pulmonar, com idades entre 18 e 82 anos. Desses, 52 eram mulheres. Houve boa concordância entre os métodos (r = 0, 8; coeficiente de correlação intraclasse = 0, 8) nos pacientes com VEF 1 > 60 % do previsto. Os valores de Rint foram menores que os da RVA por pletismografia em indivíduos mais graves. Entretanto, houve boa concordância entre Rint > 4 cmH 2 O • L- 1 • s- 1 e RVA por pletismografia > 2, 5 cmH 2 O • L- 1 • s- 1 (razão de verossimilhança > 8 e coeficiente kappa = 0, 73). CONCLUSÕES: A concordância entre o Rint e a RVA por pletismografia foi boa nos indivíduos menos graves. A concordância para um diagnóstico de aumento da RVA entre os dois métodos também foi forte.

Our main objective was to study the effect of amplitude modulations (AM) and frequency modulation (Wm) in the refractive index of nonlinearity (gamma) at a spread of Photonic Crystal Fiber with initially fixed range with frequency and amplitude periodically varying modulation. The implementation of modulation was inserted into dual-fiber couplers, which has been studied for its use as a whole using ultra switching optical switch and as an optical processor. Our simulations are {{taking into account the}} amplitude and frequency modulations of different PMN - PFC. Coupler for coupling whose length is Lc = 1. 8 cm, the transmission characteristics of the compression factor, the crosstalk (Xtalk) and extinction rate (Xratio) levels were studied in the first descending order solitons of high energy pump for considering 2 LC. An analysis of the reference (channel 2) channel was observed that the low frequency modulation is an increase in the switching power by increasing the transmission efficiency. For high modulation frequencies transmitted energy efficiency loses. The switching pulses are stronger in the low frequency and high amplitude modulation. The Xtalk {{is a function of the}} measurement made on the secondary channel (channel 1) revealed that this increase in unwanted high-frequency energy, to reduce the extent of amplitude modulation. In summary, we have demonstrated that the introduction of a non- linear profile leads to a frequency modulated PMN - PFC high variations in transmission efficiency, Xtalk, Xratio function of frequency and modulation amplitude and the input power.

40|$|Stochastic fluctuations, or noise, are {{ubiquitous}} in biological systems and {{play an important}} role in many cellular processes. Experimental evidences have shown that noise affects the reliability of cell coordination in populations of communicating cells. In this thesis, we study the effects of stochasticity in the emergence of collective behavior in populations of bacteria communicating by QS. We focus on the genetic switch as a paradigm of cellular decision making in both natural and synthetic bacterial systems. Our approach is based on mathematical modeling and stochastic simulations, both at the level of the single cell and at the level of the cell population. We focus on four main topics. In the first topic, we analyze the interplay between intracellular noise and the diffusion process of the QS signaling mechanism. We build a model describing the expression of the signaling molecule and its diffusion in a population of cells, focusing on the situation of very low constitutive expression rate. We show that varying the diffusion rate produces a repertoire of dynamics for the signaling molecule. Our results reveal the contribution of intrinsic noise and transcriptional noise (mRNA copy number fluctuations) in the fluctuations of the signaling molecule. We observe that the total noise exhibits a maximum as a function of the diffusion rate, in contrast to previous studies. Thus, the QS communication mechanism modifies the fluctuations of the signaling molecule inside the cell and interacts with the gene expression noise. In the second topic, we study the effects of gene expression noise on the precision of the population coordination in the QS activation of the LuxR/LuxI system. We analyze the response and dynamics of a population of cells to different levels of autoinducer. Our results show that gene expression noise in LuxR is the main factor that controls the transient variability of the QS activation. This study sheds light on the relation between the single cell stochastic dynamics and the collective behavior in a population of communicating cells. In the third topic, we analyze the effects of intrinsic noise in an autoactivating switch in an isolated single cell. We show that noise promotes the stability of the low-state phenotype of the switch and that the bistable region is extended when increasing the intensity of the fluctuations, an effect that we call stochastic stabilization. Our results show that intrinsic noise modifies the epigenetic landscape as well as the switching rate, which results in complex behavior of the stochastic switching dynamics when varying the intensity of noise. Thus, at the level of a single cell, intrinsic noise contributes to the cell-to-cell variability of the genetic switch and can modify its stable states and its dynamics. In the fourth topic, we build a model of a population of toggle switches communicating by the exchange of two diffusible QS signals. We show that increasing the diffusion rate, which increases the coupling strength between the cells, leads to a phase transition from an unordered phase where the cells randomly flip between the two states of the switch, to an ordered phase with all the cells locked into the same stable state. The same transition is found in a population of cells growing exponentially in a closed volume. Moreover, the response of the cells to a varying external signal exhibits a hysteresis loop. We show that the cell-cell coupling enhances the sensitivity of the population response to the external signal and suggest that this new mechanism could be used to increase the robustness and sensitivity of biosensors. Our results suggest a new mechanism for collective cell decision making based on the phenomenon of phase transition. En aquesta tesi, estudiem els efectes de la estocàsticitat en la aparició del comportament col·lectiu en poblacions de bacteris que comuniquen per quorum sensing (QS). Ens centrem en el <b>interruptor</b> genètic com a paradigma dels processos de decisió cel·lulars tant en sistemes de bacteris naturals com sintètics. El nostre mètode es basa en la modelització matemàtica i en les simulacions estocàstiques, tant a nivell d'una cèl·lula individual com a nivell d'una població de cèl·lules. A nivell d'una cèl·lula individual, mostrem que el soroll afavoreix l'estabilitat del fenotip de l'estat ``baix'' de l'interruptor genètic autoactivador i que la regió de biestabilitat s'estén quan creix la intensitat de les fluctuacions, un efecte que hem anomenat estabilització estocàstica. A nivell d'una població de cèl·lules, mostrem que el procés de difusió del mecanisme de QS modifica les fluctuacions i la dinàmica de la molècula autoinductora dins de la cèl·lula i interactua amb el soroll en la expressió genètica. En el sistema canònic de QS LuxR/LuxI, mostrem que el soroll en la expressió genètica de LuxR és el principal factor que controla la variabilitat transitòria de l'activació del QS. El soroll intrínsec disminueix la precisió de la coordinació de la població i modifica la dinàmica de la transició de QS. A més, presentem un model d'una població d'interruptors genètics de toggle switch que comuniquen per l'intercanvi de dos senyals difusius de QS. Mostrem que l'increment de la velocitat de difusió, que augmenta la força de l'acoblament entre les cèl·lules, porta a una transició de fase: va des d'una fase desordenada on les cèl·lules salten de manera aleatòria entre els dos estats de l'interruptor, fins a una fase ordenada amb totes les cèl·lules bloquejades en el mateix estat estable. La mateixa transició s'ha trobat en una població de cèl·lules que creixen exponencialment en un volum tancat, amb totes les cèl·lules entrant en l'estat ordenat quan arriben a una mida crítica del sistema. Els nostres resultats suggereixen un nou mecanisme per la decisió cel·lular col·lectiva basat en el fenomen de la transició de fase...|$|E
40|$|Metabotropic {{glutamate}} receptors (mGlu receptors) are class C GPCRs {{widely distributed}} through the CNS and considered pharmacological targets for neurologic disorders, such as neuropathic pain and Parkinson’s disease, between others. Classical allosteric modulators receptors {{might be useful}} to treat these disorders, but they the control over of the compound, once it is administered, is lost. Photoswitchable allosteric modulators have an azo-­‐moiety in their chemical scaffold and might offer a powerful alternative to these classical drugs, since their pharmacological activity can be “switched on and off”, depending on the wavelength of illumination. First, we designed and synthesised alloswitch-­‐ 1 using an azo-­‐replacement strategy, using previously described mGlu 4 PAM with two diarylamides. We replaced one of these amides with an azo-­‐bond to obtain the first GPCR photoswitchable allosteric modulator with activity in-­‐vivo. Alloswitch-­‐ 1 selectively performed NAM activity in mGlu 5 in the trans-­‐isomer, whether in the cis disposition it was inactive. This behaviour was easily controlled by illumination with 380 nm and 500 nm of wavelength and was consistent and reversible in transfected cells and native cultures. Moreover, it allowed the possibility to control the natatorial motility of native Zebrafish larvae or Xenopus Tropicalis with light, {{and it was also}} effective in the reduction of pain-­‐like behaviour in rodents, showing a clear light-­‐ dependent activity. We next designed and synthesised new related phenylazopyiridnes not only to study the structure -­‐ pharmacological activity relationship, but also the efficiency of photoisomerisation from trans to cis isomers and the rate of thermal relaxing from cis to trans isomers. Thus, we obtained many compounds with a very similar potency to alloswitch-­‐ 1, but other with an enhanced potency from 4 -­‐ to 10 -­‐fold shift, improved photoswitching properties or other ones that requires a wider wavelength for photoisomerisating, which is less harmful for in-­‐vivo tissues. Furthermore, we demonstrated that if we adjust the wavelength of illumination, we are able to control the rate of activation of the receptor, something that only can be afforded with dose-­‐adjustment with conventional pharmacology. We also synthesised optogluram with the previous azo-­‐replacement approach used with alloswitch-­‐ 1, but replacing a second amide with an azo-­‐bond. It resulted in a photoswitchable positive allosteric modulator (PAM) of mGlu 4, with similar photoswitching properties to alloswitch-­‐ 1 and also effective in the reduction of pain-­‐like behaviour in rodents. Additionally we also designed and synthesised two non-­‐photoswitchable bioisosters of alloswitch-­‐ 1 and optogluram, which did not have an azo-­‐moiety in their scaffold but conserved the previous pharmacological properties as mGlu ligands. We also synthesised a series of 12 compounds, six of them photoisomerisable, to study the relationships between mGlu 4 PAMs and mGlu 5 NAMs. Among them, we found two compounds having both pharmacological activities in the low-­‐micromolar range of potency. Concerning the mGlu 5 NAMs of this family, we discovered the chemical particularities that make them inverse agonists or partial antagonists. Finally, we tried to design and synthesise photoswitchable mGlu 4 PAMs and mGlu 5 NAMs with a trans isomer inactive and a cis isomer active (cis-­‐on). To do that, we designed new modulators and computationally verified the suitability of the cis-­‐on with molecular dockings. Despite the efforts made, we were not successful to find some cis-­‐on without unspecific effects. Overall, we found the molecular characteristics that relate mGlu 4 PAMs and mGlu 5 NAMs, and how to obtain a molecular switch between both pharmacological activities. We make a success of azo-­‐ replacing approaches of previous active compounds for obtaining photoswitchable compounds. We additionally proved that optopharmacology might be more advantageous than optogenetics or conventional pharmacology, because of the possibility to perform assays with native tissues or in-­‐ vivo with no genetic modification and adjust the activation of the receptor with light with a single dose of compound, instead of changing doses to find the optimal one. Els receptors de glutamat metabotròpics (mGlu) són GPCRs distribuïts a través del CNS i es consideren dianes farmacològiques per a trastorns neurològics, com ara el dolor neuropàtic i la malaltia de Parkinson, entre d'altres. En primer lloc, vam dissenyar i sintetitzar l’alloswitch-­‐ 1 utilitzant una estratègia de azo-­‐ reemplaçament, per obtenir el primer modulador al·∙lostèric de GPCR fotocommutable amb activitat in vivo. L’alloswitch-­‐ 1 té activitat de NAM en mGlu 5 en l'isòmer trans, mentre que en la disposició cis és inactiu. Aquest comportament es controla fàcilment amb il·∙luminació amb 380 nm i 500 nm i és reversible in-­‐vitro. D'altra banda, va permtre la possibilitat de controlar la motilitat de larves de peix zebra o capgrossos amb llum. També vam poder controlar la sensació de dolor en rosegadors depenent de la llum. Seguidament, vam realitzar el disseny i síntesi de noves feniliazopiridines, no només per l'estudi de la relació SAR, sinó també per l'eficiència de fotoisomerizació. Vam obtenir compostos amb bona potència farmacològica i vam millorar les propietats de fotoisomerització. També vam sintetitzar l’optogluram amb l’estratègia azo-­‐reemplaçament anterior. El resultat va ser un modulador al·∙lostèric positiu (PAM) de mGlu 4 fotoisomerable, amb propietats òptiques similars a l’alloswitch-­‐ 1 i també és eficaç en el control de la sensació de dolor en rosegadors. A més també vam dissenyar i sintetitzar dos bioisòsters no fotisomeritzables que conservaven les propietats farmacològiques anteriors. Vam sintetitzar una sèrie per trobar compostos amb activitat dual com a PAM de mGlu 4 i NAM de mGlu 5. Dos dels compostos ho va arribar a ser i amb els que van resultar NAMs de mGlu 5, en vam descobrir les particularitats químiques que els fan agonistes inversos o antagonistes parcials. Finalment, vam intentar de dissenyar i sintetitzar PAMs de mGlu 4 i NAMs de mGlu 5 amb un isòmer trans inactiu i un isòmer cis actiu, però sense èxit. En resum, vam trobar les característiques moleculars que relacionen PAMS de mGlu 4 i NAMS mGlu 5, i com obtenir un <b>interruptor</b> molecular entre ambdues activitats farmacològiques. A més, vam demostrar que l’optofarmacologia presenta avantatges respecte la farmacologia convencional, ja que permet ajustar l'activació del receptor amb llum...|$|E
