50|$|The {{first version}} of MacDraw {{was similar to that}} of MacPaint, {{featuring}} both the same tools and patterns. However MacDraw was vector-based, meaning that an object's properties and placement can be changed at any time. MacDraw included features for printing and also integrated into MacWrite via cut-and-paste. MacDraw was more advanced than MacPaint, featuring a grid and the ability to change the <b>drawing</b> <b>dimensions.</b> However MacDraw lacked support for using more than one document at a time, and also lacked zooming capabilities. MacDraw was especially useful in drawing flowcharts, diagrams and technical drawings.|$|E

40|$|In a roofing project, {{acquiring}} the underlying as-built 3 D geometry and visualizing the roof structure {{is needed in}} different phases of the project life-cycle. Architectural drawings, building information model (BIM) files, or aerial photogrammetry are used to estimate the roofing area in the bidding process. However, as a roof structure is never built to the exact <b>drawing</b> <b>dimensions,</b> as-built dimensions of boundaries of every roof plane have to be obtained {{several times during the}} course of its build. There are a number of surveying methods {{that can be used for}} this purpose: tape measuring, total station surveying, aerial photogrammetry, and laser scanning. However, obtaining measurements using these methods could be costly in terms of equipment, labor, and/or worker exposure to safety hazards. Aiming to address this limitation and provide roofing practitioners with an alternative roof surveying and visualization method that is simple to use, automated, inexpensive, and safe, a close-range videogrammetric roof 3 D reconstruction framework is presented in this research. When using this method, a roofing contractor will simply collect stereo video streams of a target roof. The captured data is processed to generate a 3 D wire-diagram for every roof plane. In this process, distinctive visual features of the scene (e. g., 2 D points and lines) are first automatically detected and matched between video frames. Matched features and the camera calibration information are used to compute an initial estimation of the 3 D structure. Then, a hybrid bundle adjustment algorithm is used to refine the result and acquire the geometry that has the maximum likelihood. Afterwards, different roof planes are found and a measurable 3 D wire-diagram is generated for each plane. Ph. D...|$|E

50|$|When all {{the records}} are assembled, the {{surveyor}} examines the documents for errors, such as closure errors. When a {{metes and bounds}} description is involved, the seniority of the deeds must be determined. The title abstract usually gives the order of seniority for the deeds related to the tract being surveyed and should be used if available. After this data is gathered and analyzed the field survey may commence. The initial survey operations should be concentrated on locating monuments. In urban regions, monuments should be sought initially; but {{in the absence of}} monuments, property corners marked by iron pins, metal survey markers, iron pipes, and other features possibly establishing a line of possession should be located. When the approximate positions for the boundaries of the property have been located, a traverse is run around the property. While the control traverse is being run, ties should be measured and all details relevant to the boundaries should be acquired. This includes but is not limited to locating the property corners, monuments, fences, hedge rows, walls, walks, and all buildings on the lot. The surveyor then takes this collected data and compares it to the records which were received. When a solution is reached, the chosen property corners (those that best fit all the data) are coordinated, and ties by direction and distance are computed from the nearest traverse point. Once this has been established the features on the lot can be <b>drawn,</b> <b>dimensions</b> can be shown from these features to the boundary line, and a map or plat is prepared for the client.|$|R

40|$|Electrical test {{structures}} of the type known as cross-bridge resistors have been patterned in (100) epitaxial silicon material that was grown on Bonded and Etched-Back Silicon-on-Insulator (BESOI) substrates. The CDs (Critical Dimensions) of a selection of their reference segments have been measured electrically, by SEM (Scanning-Electron Microscopy) cross-section imaging, and by lattice-plane counting. The lattice-plane counting is performed on phase-contrast images made by High-Resolution Transmission-Electron Microscopy (HRTEM). The reference-segment features were aligned with directions in the BESOI surface material. They were defined by a silicon micromachining process which results in their sidewalls being atomically-planar and smooth and inclined at 54. 737 {degree} to the surface (100) plane of the substrate. This (100) implementation may usefully complement the attributes of the previously-reported vertical-sidewall one for selected reference-material applications. The SEM, HRTEM, and electrical CD (ECD) linewidth measurements that are made on BESOI features of various <b>drawn</b> <b>dimensions</b> on the same substrate is being investigated to determine the feasibility of a CD traceability path that combines the low cost, robustness, and repeatability of the ECD technique and the absolute measurement of the HRTEM lattice-plane counting technique. Other novel aspects of the (100) SOI implementation that are reported here are the ECD test-structure architecture {{and the making of}} HRTEM lattice-plane counts from both cross-sectional, as well as top-down, imaging of the reference features. This paper describes the design details and the fabrication of the cross-bridge resistor test structure. The long-term goal is to develop a technique for the determination of the absolute dimensions of the trapezoidal cross-sections of the cross-bridge resistors reference segments, as a prelude to making them available for dimensional reference applications...|$|R
