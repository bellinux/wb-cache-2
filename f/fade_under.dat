50|$|Archaeological {{excavations}} in the Lorca {{area have}} revealed {{that it has been}} inhabited continuously since Neolithic times, 5,500 years ago. The earliest permanent settlement is in the Guadalentín River valley, likely because of its presence of water sources, mineral resources, and lying along a natural communication route in Andalusia. On the hillside below the castle and the town archaeological digs have revealed the remains of an important population of the El Argar culture during the Bronze Age. During the Roman period, a settlement here was called Eliocroca, detailed in the Antonine Itinerary and located right on Via Augusta.

A few years earlier, Paul had managed the design and production of a 25 million dollar province wide anodized aluminum signage project; the contract having been awarded to Permaloy coatings division in Alberta. A few years later, Paul asked Permaloy if they would, as a favour to the Ukrainian immigrants of Canada, donate money and the anodized aluminum for the Pysanka's construction.

These packages consisted mostly of comfort features — nicer interiors, more padding and insulation, carpet, chrome trim, and upper and lower side molding and tailgate trim. 1971 was the first year for AM/FM radios factory installed. Finally, the front brakes on all light-duty trucks were switched from drum brakes to disc brakes, resulting in much less brake <b>fade</b> <b>under</b> heavy use.

The 1/2 ton 4 x 4 retained the 6 lug bolt pattern. This bolt pattern would remain the standard {{through the end of the}} C/K series (along with the Chevrolet/GMC vans).

50|$|Vitreous enamel {{has many}} useful properties: it is smooth, hard, {{chemically}} resistant, durable, scratch resistant (5-6 on the Mohs scale), has long-lasting colour fastness, {{is easy to}} clean, and cannot burn. Enamel is glass, not paint, so it does not <b>fade</b> <b>under</b> ultraviolet light. A disadvantage of enamel {{is a tendency to}} crack or shatter when the substrate is stressed or bent, but modern enamels are relatively chip- and impact-resistant because of good thickness control and coefficients of thermal expansion well-matched to the metal. The Buick automobile company was founded by David Dunbar Buick with wealth earned by his development of improved enamelling processes, c. 1887, for sheet steel and cast iron. Such enameled ferrous material had, and still has, many applications: early 20th century and some modern advertising signs, interior oven walls, cooking pots, housing and interior walls of major kitchen appliances, housing and drums of clothes washers and dryers, sinks and cast iron bathtubs, farm storage silos, and processing equipment such as chemical reactors and pharmaceutical process tanks. Structures such as filling stations, bus stations and Lustron Houses had walls, ceilings and structural elements made of enamelled steel. One of the most widespread modern uses of enamel is in the production of quality chalk-boards and marker-boards (typically called 'blackboards' or 'whiteboards') where the resistance of enamel to wear and chemicals ensures that 'ghosting', or unerasable marks, do not occur, as happens with polymer boards. Since standard enamelling steel is magnetically attractive, it may also be used for magnet boards. Some new developments {{in the last ten years}} include enamel/non-stick hybrid coatings, sol-gel functional top-coats for enamels, enamels with a metallic appearance, and new easy-to-clean enamels.|$|E
5000|$|By then, Joe Frazier {{had not yet}} KO'd Ellis {{to unify}} the two boxing belts, but was still {{considered}} by many to be champion. This first match against Frazier took place June, 23rd, 1969. It was Quarry's 38th pro fight and Frazier's 23rd pro fight. Both had turned pro in 1965. The fight was held at New York City's Madison Square Garden, which is where the Mathis fight had also been held three months earlier. This would be the site of a number of Quarry's fights in years to come. During this time, he called New York City his home citing bad press he received in Los Angeles.The fight was cited later by writers and observers for its remarkable early action. Round One was later called [...] "Round Of The Decade" [...] and the bout was later named Ring Magazines [...] "Fight of The Year". Quarry fought a very aggressive fight to please the crowds after the lacklustre Ellis match, going head-to-head in the center of the ring with Frazier, and fighting Frazier's kind of fight. Judges gave Quarry the edge in points for the first two rounds as he landed the more punches with his greater speed and combination punching. But as he was slugging with the slugger, he began to <b>fade</b> <b>under</b> the fast pace of the war and hard punches of Frazier. He was cut badly by Frazier in the third round but continued on. Unable to hurt Frazier at this point and receiving many unanswered shots, the fight was stopped after the 7th round due to the cut. He was well behind in scoring at this point. There were no knockdowns in the bout, which was an impressive fact given all the hard punches landed.|$|E

50|$|Mongul {{receives}} a Yellow power ring after breaking a dying Sinestro Corps member's neck (a later promotional image shows Mongul with the Yellow ring as well a Green Lantern Corps ring). Mongul offers the Sinestro Corps inductees a choice: to serve him or die. He removes the ring from each one who refuses, {{and at one}} point had gained an extra five rings. He then attacks Arisia and Sodam Yat with Black Mercy plants, and takes them prisoner. He uses his ring to send thousands of Black Mercy seeds, which he had genetically engineered to bring the victims greatest fears to life, instead of their dreams, to several unsuspecting planets. In a confrontation with several members of the Green Lantern Corps, Mongul is defeated when the fly-like Lantern Bzzd flies through his eye, and he is thrown down to the Black Mercy's planet. He is last seen buried in soil, being used as food by the Black Mercys. However, he soon breaks free and escapes the planet, while keeping his rings and his right arm. His left arm had been severed in the process, but, through the power of his rings, Mongul is able to control and direct it. He attacks a nearby ship to get food for himself, killing the husband of the pilot. This inadvertently causes the woman to become the first recruit of the Star Sapphires, the violet Power Ring having been drawn to her by the void in her heart created by her loss. Mongul uses his left arm to invade the planet Daxam and establish it as the new homeworld for his faction of the Sinestro Corps under his command. However, he is challenged for the leadership by Arkillo. Defeating him in single combat, Mongul pulls out Arkillo's tongue and wears it as a necklace. In the process, he gains the loyalty of the faction of the Sinestro Corps loyal to Arkillo and complete rule over the planet Daxam, but draws on himself the attentions of Arisia and Sodam Yat, the Daxamite host for the Ion Entity. Upon the arrival of Arisia and Yat, several members of the Sinestro Corps are swiftly defeated and killed by Yat until his Superman-like powers <b>fade</b> <b>under</b> Daxam's red sun. Despite his power loss and Mongul's incredible strength, Yat does battle with him, using the Ion power to briefly launch Mongul into space, before entering Daxam's sun and transforming it from red to yellow, granting all Daxamites superpowers. The Daxamite's overwhelming attack forces Mongul to have the Sinestro Corps abandon Daxam, with the despot planning to make a different planet their home base.|$|E

We present a simple method – based on cooling in ambient air - to observe the color change of several butterfly wings colored by various photonic nanoarchitectures. The color change {{can be attributed to}} the condensation of atmospheric humidity in the nanocavities of the photonic nanoarchitecture. The effects were investigated by controlled cooling combined with the in-situ measurement of the changes in the reflectivity spectra. For certain species the reflectivity maximum (color) has almost completely disappeared. A correlation was also found between the openness of the nanostructure and the time of the color change. Cooling experiments, using thin copper wires showed that color alteration could be limited to millimeters; this may offer a possible alternative for display technology...|$|E
