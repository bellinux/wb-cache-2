5|$|Adams {{left the}} club in April 1962 and was {{replaced}} with Sid Abel, who was also head coach. First under Abel as GM and then Ned Harkness, Alex Delvecchio, Lindsay, and Jimmy Skinner in the position, the Red Wings suffered {{a long period of}} decline, from 1967 until 1983, during which they made the playoffs only twice. They did not appear in the Finals <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> and only won one of the three series they appeared in, beating the Atlanta Flames two games to none in 1978.|$|E
5|$|Although {{ultimately}} {{the number of}} men that joined the units of the 2nd AIF from the Militia was in fact lower than anticipated, a large number of such personnel left to seek an opportunity to serve overseas. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> the 61st Battalion lost many of its experienced senior officers and non-commissioned officers to the 2/25th and 2/33rd Battalions that were raised in Queensland, {{as well as to the}} Royal Australian Air Force. Of note was the loss of the battalion's pipe and drum band, which joined the 2/25th en masse. A 61st Battalion officer, Major Charles Withy, also went across with them serving initially as the second in command and then later as the 2/25th's commanding officer.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{molecular}} clock estimation, Trigonognathus {{is thought to}} have originated around 41 million years ago during the Middle Eocene, {{as part of a larger}} evolutionary radiation of etmopterid genera. The genus is represented <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> period by the extinct species T. virginiae, whose fossilized teeth have been recovered from Lutetian age (47.8–41.3 Mya) strata in Landes, southwestern France. Fossil teeth virtually identical to those of the modern viper dogfish are known from the Cubagua Formation in northeastern Venezuela, which dates to the Late Miocene and Early Pliocene (11.6–3.6 Mya).|$|E

5|$|Between 1940 and 2005, the {{population}} of Juniata County was proportionally the third fastest-growing population of any county in Pennsylvania, with only Snyder County's and Perry County's populations growing faster. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> period, the county's population has increased by 50.69%, or 7,792 people. In the 1980s, the county's rate of population growth was more than 50 {{times higher than the}} rate of population growth in Pennsylvania. The county's rate of population growth in the 1970s was even higher.|$|E
5|$|Copenhagen's urban {{development}} {{in the first half}} of the 20th century was heavily influenced by industrialisation. After World War II, Copenhagen Municipality adopted Fordism and repurposed its medieval centre to facilitate private automobile infrastructure in response to innovations in transport, trade and communication. Copenhagen’s spacial planning <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> frame was characterised by the separation of land uses: an approach which requires residents to travel by car to access facilities of different uses.|$|E
5|$|During {{the mid-19th}} century, Ohio Wesleyan focused on {{attracting}} students, adding fields of study, and fundraising, {{by which it}} significantly increased its endowment. Sturges Hall was constructed as the University's first library in 1855. In 1873, the school added the Department of Natural History housed in Merrick Hall. The Ohio Wesleyan Female College, established in 1853, merged with the university in 1877. Between 1876 and 1888, enrollment tripled and music education greatly increased, yet no major buildings were built <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>time.</b>|$|E

5|$|For the {{remainder}} of the campaign, about 600 men from the regiment– including a batch of reinforcements that arrived in early October– carried out mainly defensive duties before leaving with the last Australian troops to be evacuated from the peninsula on 20 December. They did not take part in any large-scale battles, but were involved in fighting off a number of sharp attacks. The exact number of casualties suffered is not known, but 18 men from the regiment are known to have been killed <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>time.</b>|$|E
5|$|Idiophones were {{extremely}} important in Chinese music, hence {{the majority of}} early instruments were idiophones. Poetry of the Shang dynasty mentions bells, chimes, drums, and globular flutes carved from bone, the latter {{of which has been}} excavated and preserved by archaeologists. The Zhou dynasty saw percussion instruments such as clappers, troughs, wooden fish, and yǔ (wooden tiger). Wind instruments such as flute, pan-pipes, pitch-pipes, and mouth organs also appeared <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> period. The xiao (an end-blown flute) and various other instruments that spread through many cultures, came into use in China during and after the Han dynasty.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, Jordan Rudess {{was hired}} to replace Sherinian. Rudess's first work was Scenes from a Memory, a concept album that {{followed}} {{the story of a}} murder mystery. In 2002, the group released Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence, followed by Train of Thought in 2003, and Octavarium in 2005. Two more live albums were also released <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> period, and a new one, titled Score, was released for the band's 20thanniversary and featured the band backed by a 29-piece orchestra. It was followed a year later by their ninth studio album, Systematic Chaos. Dream Theater's tenth studio album, Black Clouds & Silver Linings, the band's second under Roadrunner Records; was released on June 23, 2009.|$|E

5|$|In the UK, The Secret Service {{aired in}} the ATV, Granada and Southern {{broadcasting}} regions on its original run, appearing on Sunday evenings at the regular time of 5.30pm. In most other ITV regions, The Flaxton Boys was broadcast <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> slot. Outside of Britain, ATN Channel 7 purchased and broadcast the series in Australia on Saturday mornings in 1972. Although repeats ran until 1972 on ATV and Southern, and until 1975 on Granada, the series {{has not been}} transmitted since and remains unsold to new broadcasters.|$|E
5|$|In the {{remainder}} of the season, Bosanquet never took more than three wickets in an innings, although he scored a century against Essex and three other fifties. He played for the Gentlemen against the Players scoring 38 and 19 but did not take a wicket in the 17 overs he bowled. In 20 first-class matches, Bosanquet scored 1,198 runs (average 37.43) and took 63 wickets (average 27.77). After this season, he rarely bowled and later stated that he did not bowl the googly after 1905, particularly after one embarrassing attempt to do so in a match at Harrow. In another eight seasons of first-class cricket, he took only 22 wickets. However, his batting seemed to improve <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>time.</b>|$|E

5|$|Knox was {{probably}} educated at the grammar school in Haddington. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>time,</b> the priesthood {{was the only}} path for those whose inclinations were academic rather than mercantile or agricultural.

5|$|Later in the year, in April, {{he was one}} of four Scottish envoys sent to Canterbury for {{abortive}} {{talks with}} the English and French. In the next few years, Nicholas' activities are difficult to trace, but he was probably involved in much diplomatic activity, including perhaps having a hand in drawing up the brief which Baldred Bisset would later deliver to the pope in the interests of Scottish independence. It was probably <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> too that Nicholas became a clerk at Arbroath Abbey and perhaps a canon of Dunblane Cathedral.|$|E

5|$|On 2 April, the Japanese divisional commander, Akanaga, {{called the}} 13th and 23rd Infantry Regiments {{back across the}} Puriata, to a {{position}} south-west of the Pain feature. At this point, {{the decision was made}} to launch a fresh attack aimed at taking Slater's Knoll and eliminating the Australian forces in the area surrounding the Puriata ford. The attack was scheduled for 5 April, and over the course of the following three days, contact was minimal. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>time,</b> there were a few minor skirmishes, and small groups of Japanese were seen by the Australians around Barara, Slater's Knoll and Mosigetta. As further intelligence reports came in, it became clear to the Australian commanders that the Japanese were about to deliver the main attack.|$|E
5|$|Overcrowding and {{shortages}} of equipment in England {{meant that it}} was decided to keep the Anzacs in Egypt during the European winter, during which time they would undertake further training in order to prepare them for their eventual use in the trenches in France. Despite this, however, the training that the Australians and New Zealanders received <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> could only be considered very rudimentary in nature, and despite popular opinion at the time, it did little to prepare them for what was to come.|$|E
5|$|Several actresses were {{considered}} {{for the role of}} Tatiana, including Italians Sylva Koscina and Virna Lisi, Danish actress Annette Vadim, and English-born Tania Mallet. 1960 Miss Universe runner-up Daniela Bianchi was ultimately cast, supposedly Sean Connery's choice. Bianchi started taking English classes for the role, but the producers ultimately chose to have her lines redubbed by British stage actress Barbara Jefford in the final cut. The scene in which Bond finds Tatiana in his hotel bed was used for Bianchi's screen test, with Dawson standing <b>in,</b> <b>this</b> <b>time,</b> as Bond. The scene later became the traditional screen test scene for prospective James Bond actors and Bond Girls.|$|E
