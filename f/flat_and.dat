5|$|Blake {{decided to}} compose his score {{to match the}} key of the Schubert Mass, {{in order for the}} music to {{continue}} seamlessly. However, during the recording session with his orchestra, the Sinfonia of London, he found that the Schubert piece was running slow and therefore <b>flat,</b> <b>and</b> he had to ask the players to tune flat to match his intended key.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, matter {{itself is}} {{expected}} to come {{under the influence of}} radioactive decay, as even the most stable materials break apart into subatomic particles. Current data suggest that the universe has a flat geometry (or very close to <b>flat),</b> <b>and</b> thus, will not collapse in on itself after a finite time, and the infinite future allows for the occurrence of a number of massively improbable events, such as the formation of Boltzmann brains.|$|E

5|$|In this <b>flat</b> <b>and</b> marshy area, the {{branches}} and roots of mangrove trees form dams where deposits of oyster shells naturally accumulate along with mud and plant detritus.

5|$|Many riders used normal {{road race}} bikes for this stage, as {{the course is}} highly {{atypical}} for a time trial, with roads that were not <b>flat</b> <b>and</b> straight. Most of those riders altered their road race bikes with the aerodynamic handlebars of a time trial bike, but some, including race leader Danilo Di Luca, did not. The climbs in the stage increased the overall chances for strong climbers who are relatively weak time trialists, such as Damiano Cunego and Gilberto Simoni.|$|E

Early filming took place at Pinewood Studios, and around London, with scenes variously featuring Craig and Harris at Bond's <b>flat,</b> <b>and</b> Craig and Kinnear travelling down the River Thames.|$|E
5|$|Over about 80 million years, erosion {{caused the}} {{transportation}} of {{massive amounts of}} alluvial sediment {{to the floor of}} the Central Valley, where it was trapped between the California Coast Range on the west and the Sierra Nevada on the east, forming an incredibly <b>flat</b> <b>and</b> fertile land surface. The present-day form of the upper Merced River watershed, however, was formed by glaciers, and the lower watershed was indirectly but significantly affected.|$|E

Ice from Mt. Harkness and Sifford Mountain also wound up in Warner Valley.|$|E
