50|$|TRPV1-S isoform {{results from}} {{alternative}} splicing during post-transcriptional regulation, {{a variation of}} the TRPV1 C-terminus due to insertion of 23-base-pair sequence, exon14a, that contains a stop codon. The <b>inserted</b> <b>sequence</b> is flanked by two introns marked with GT/AG donor-acceptor sites that are necessary for U2-dependent splicing. Consequently, incorporation or bypass of exon14a results in the short or long isoforms, respectively. It is suggested that efficient splicing of the exon14a segment necessitates the specialized environment of TG in vampire bats. Compared to the long isoform (threshold ~ 40 °C), the temperature threshold of channel activation is much lower for TRPV1-S. TRPV1-S channels expressed in HEK293 cells and Xenopus oocytes (cells commonly used for manipulation of expressing certain genes) have a threshold of 30 °C. This is highly consistent with in vitro studies pertaining to temperature thresholds of IR-sensitive receptors in vampire bats (28 °C). Activation of TRPV1-S channels in the TG may then suggest a similar mechanism (as seen in IR-sensing snakes) for how infrared sensing may work in vampire bats. Trigeminal nerves which innervate specialized temperature sensitive receptors on the nose-leaf may in turn activate TRPV1-S channels in the TG in response to infrared thermal radiation.|$|E
5000|$|Transposon {{sequencing}} {{begins by}} transforming bacterial populations with transposable elements using bacteriophages. Tn-seq uses the Himar I Mariner transposon, a common and stable transposon. After transformation, the DNA is cleaved and the <b>inserted</b> <b>sequence</b> amplified through PCR. The recognition sites for MmeI, a type IIS restriction endonuclease, can be introduced {{by a single}} nucleotide change in the terminal repeats of Mariner. It is located 4 bp {{before the end of}} the terminal repeat. MmeI makes a 2 bp staggered cut 20 bases downstream of the recognition site. When MmeI digests DNA from a library of transposon insertion mutants, fragmented DNA including the left and right transposon and 16 bp of surrounding genomic DNA is produced. The 16 bp fragment is enough to determine the location of the transposon insertion in the bacterial genome. The ligation of the adaptor is facilitated by the 2 base overhang. A primer specific to the adaptor and a primer specific to the transponson are used to amplify the sequence via PCR. The 120 bp product is then isolated using agarose gel or PAGE purification. Massively parallel sequencing is then used to determine the sequences of the flanking 16 bp. Gene function is inferred after looking at the effects of the insertion on gene function under certain conditions.|$|E

As {{we hypothesized that}} the rearrangement between BCR and ABL genes occurred near the <b>inserted</b> <b>sequence</b> {{and because of the}} relative small size of BCR intron 14, we determined the BCR-ABL breakpoint at the genomic DNA level.

40|$|As a {{step toward}} {{selecting}} folded proteins from libraries of randomized sequences, we have designed a `loop entropy reduction'-based phage-display method. The basic premise is that insertion of a long disordered sequence into a loop of a host protein will substantially destabilize the host because of the entropic cost of closing a loop in a disordered chain. If the <b>inserted</b> <b>sequence</b> spontaneously folds into a stable structure with the N and C termini close in space, however, this entropic cost is diminished.

Eventually, multiple species of deletion mutants were detected simultaneously in later infection cycles; once detected, these variants rapidly dominated the population and thereafter appeared to be maintained at a relative equilibrium. Sequence analysis of these variants identified preferred sites of recombination in the parental viruses, including both short direct repeats and inverted repeats. One instance of insert deletion through recombination with an endogenous retrovirus was also observed.

Cloning and sequencing analyses revealed that the <b>inserted</b> <b>sequence</b> was 1, 665 bp in length and had a terminal inverted repeat of 15 bp. In addition, this <b>inserted</b> <b>sequence</b> was found to generate a 4 -bp duplication at the inserted site upon transposition.

The <b>inserted</b> <b>sequence</b> contains two long open reading frames of 461 and 222 amino acids which are overlapped and encoded by different strands. Although these open reading frames showed no homology to any protein registered in the DNA data bases, the longer open reading frame contained many basic amino acids (87 of 461), as was observed with transposases of so-called insertion sequence (IS) elements. All of these characteristics are typical of IS elements, and the sequence was named IS 1380. The copy number of IS 1380 in a cell of A. pasteurianus NCI 1380 was estimated to be about 100. Several strains of acetic acid bacteria also contained IS 1380 at high copy numbers.

Three plasmids, pYA 401, pYA 402, and pYA 403, constructed with the cosmid vector pCVD 305 conferred wild-type levels of virulence to plasmid-cured S. typhimurium and had a common 14 -kb DNA <b>insert</b> <b>sequence.</b> Another recombinant plasmid, pYA 422, constructed with the vector pACYC 184, conferred to plasmid-cured S. typhimurium a wild-type 50 % lethal dose (LD 50) level, but mice died more slowly than when infected with wild-type S. typhimurium. Furthermore, pYA 422 conferred the ability to cause a higher, but not a wild-type, level of splenic infection on plasmid-cured S. typhimurium. pYA 422 had a 3. 2 -kb <b>insert</b> <b>sequence</b> which mapped {{to the center of}} the 14 -kb common sequence of the cosmid clones.

Even though the insertions were performed at two different sites, looping out occurred at the C-terminal end of the same β-strand. Reasons as to why a non-native sequence would be recruited to replace that which occurs in the native protein are discussed. Our results illustrate how sequence insertions can facilitate protein evolution through both local and nonlocal changes in structure...|$|R

40|$|Hepatitis B virus (HBV) takes {{humans as}} its sole natural host, and {{productive}} infection in vivo is restricted exclusively to hepatocytes in the liver. Consequently, HBV-derived viral vectors are attractive candidates for liver-targeting gene therapies. Previously, {{we developed a}} novel recombinant HBV vector, designated 5 c 3 c, from a highly replicative clinical isolate. 5 c 3 c was demonstrated {{to be capable of}} efficiently delivering protein or RNA expression into infected primary tupaia hepatocytes (PTH), but the design of 5 c 3 c imposes stringent restrictions on <b>inserted</b> <b>sequences,</b> which have limited its wider adoption. In this work, we addressed issues with 5 c 3 c by re-designing the insertion strategy. The resultant vector, designated 5 dCG, was more replicative than parental 5 c 3 c, imposed no specific restrictions on <b>inserted</b> <b>sequences,</b> and allowed insertion of a variety of cargo genes without significant loss of replication efficiency. 5 dCG-based recombinant HBV effectively delivered protein and RNA expression into infected PTH. Furthermore, due to the loss of functional core ORF, 5 dCG vectors depend on co-infecting wild type HBV for replication and efficient expression of cargo genes. Development of the improved 5 dCG vector makes wider applications of recombinant HBV possible, while dependence on co-infecting wild type HBV results in improved safety for certain in vivo applications...|$|R
