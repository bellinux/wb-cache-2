The ship {{remained on the}} reef in calm overnight conditions and all crew and 21 passengers were rescued the following morning. On 8 April 1894 the steamship Udea was lost on the same rocks with a cargo of coal and iron. Owned by David MacBrayne, she was en route from Glasgow to Lewis at the time. On 16 September 1940 the British steam liner Aska was bombed by a German aircraft south of Gigha whilst carrying French troops from Gambia. Twelve crewmen died in the attack and 75 survivors were successfully picked up by trawlers. On fire, the Aska drifted onto Cara and was wrecked there. Four years later the Mon Cousu was deliberately sunk in the Sound of Gigha and used for bombing practice. In 1991 the Russian factory ship Kartli was hit by two <b>freak</b> <b>waves</b> off Islay and ran aground at Port Ban after the crew were evacuated. Forty seven crew members were air-lifted to safety but four men {{were killed in the}} accident.|$|E

From about 1997 most leading authors acknowledged the existence of rogue waves with the caveat that wave models had been unable to replicate rogue waves. The first scientific research which comprehensively proved that waves exist that are clearly outside the range of Gaussian waves was published in 1997.|$|E

50|$|The {{evidence}} in the photographs showed abnormally large waves out in the deep ocean, where science, using the linear model had predicted that such extreme waves were extremely rare, {{to the extent that}} a 30 m crest-to-trough wave would occur only once every 10,000 years. The proof gathered by Stolt Surf joined a growing body of evidence that the linear model did not adequately explain all of the types of waves that could be encountered. The loss of MS München in a storm in the North Atlantic the following year was attributed to an 'unknown event', but was later considered {{to be one of the}} first losses that could be confidently attributed to a freak wave. Despite this, it was not until the separate encounters by the cruise liners Bremen and Caledonian Star in the South Atlantic, that the possibility of nonlinear causes of <b>freak</b> <b>waves</b> was seriously considered. The resulting theories helped to explain the possible causes of the <b>freak</b> <b>waves</b> encountered by Stolt Surf.|$|E

The nonlinear parameters of ocean waves of skewness, atiltness, kurtosis and spectrum band width et al. are analyzed, and their relevance with component wave characteristics of significant wave height, maximum wave height and so on is examined. It is evident that with an exception of kurtosis, the parameters describing nonlinear characteristics of observed wave spectrum are feebly event.

50|$|Beach front flora plays a {{major role}} in {{stabilizing}} the foredunes and preventing beach head erosion and inland movement of dunes. If flora with network root systems (creepers, grasses and palms) are able to become established, they provide an effective coastal defense as they trap sand particles and rainwater and enrich the surface layer of the dunes, allowing other plant species to become established. They also protect the berm from erosion by high winds, <b>freak</b> <b>waves</b> and subsiding flood waters.|$|E
