5|$|Nightjars are {{medium-sized}} nocturnal {{birds that}} usually nest on the ground. They have long wings, short legs, and very short bills. Most have small <b>feet</b> <b>that</b> are {{of little use}} for walking and long, pointed wings. Their soft plumage is cryptically colored to resemble bark or leaves. Three species have been recorded in Maryland.|$|E
5|$|The {{little brown}} bat can be {{distinguished}} from the Indiana bat {{by the absence of}} a keel on the caclar and long hairs on the hind <b>feet</b> <b>that</b> stretch longer than the toes. Compared to the long-legged bat, the brown bat has a shorter tibia and lesser amounts of ventral wing hair in addition to the lack of a keel on the caclar.|$|E

5|$|The blades are transtibial prostheses, {{meaning they}} replace legs and <b>feet</b> <b>that</b> are amputated {{below the knee}} (BK). They were {{developed}} by medical engineer Van Phillips who incorporated Flex-Foot, Inc., in 1984, and in 2000 sold the company to Össur which now (in 2012) manufactures the blades. They are designed to store kinetic energy like a spring, allowing the wearer to jump and run effectively.|$|E
5|$|The {{exhibition}} remained open to {{the public}} until 2005, when it was closed for a third restoration. The $12-million restoration, by Olin Conservation, Inc., of Great Falls, Virginia, started with the 26 sections of the painting and recreated its original shape of 14 panels hung from a circular railing, slightly flared out at the bottom. In the process, some original pieces were found of the 12 circumferential <b>feet</b> <b>that</b> had been cut away. Fourteen vertical feet of sky was also restored.|$|E
5|$|The female {{relies on}} her hind feet for digging. She may {{accumulate}} so much sand and mud on her <b>feet</b> <b>that</b> her mobility is reduced, making her vulnerable to predators. To lighten her labors, she lubricates {{the area with}} her bladder water. Once the nest is complete, the female deposits into the hole. The freshly laid eggs are white, elliptical, porous, and flexible. From start to finish, the female's work may take fourhours. Sometimes she remains on land overnight afterwards, before returning to her home water.|$|E

5|$|The spiny scallop {{usually has}} a {{symbiotic}} relationship with an encrusting sponge which grows on its left valve. This is most often the orange Myxilla incrustans but is sometimes the purple or brown Mycale adherens. The sponge provides camouflage for the scallop and may deter predators from attacking it as sponges often produce a repulsive odour and tend to be distasteful. It also {{makes it more difficult}} for a starfish to get the strong grip with its tube <b>feet</b> <b>that</b> it needs to force the two valves of the scallop apart.|$|E
5|$|Myers {{made one}} hundred oxy-hydrogen balloon bombs for the {{government}} to do a full scale experiment of producing rain. The balloons were 10, 12, and 20 feet in diameter. The purpose of the Texas experiment was to see if making artificial rain could be done by man-made weather modification. After the experiment took place it was reported that the result was a success of what was hoped for. The news press release of August 20, 1891, reported that rain was made to fall two days before at three o'clock in the afternoon. At the time the sky was clear and there was no prediction of rain in the area for at least a week. The claim was that the rain produced was directly or indirectly caused by the explosion of the oxygen-hydrogen balloon bombs that were exploded electrically at altitudes of 1800 to 3000 <b>feet.</b> <b>That</b> started a sequence of events that lead to a torrent. The rain storm that ensued was reported by ranchers and railroad linemen for some thousand miles across several states. After this Myers was contracted by paper companies in New York state to see about producing rain in their forests that needed it badly. He contended that the Mohawk Valley was {{a good place to start}} rain and that the rainfall then would go to the Adirondack Mountains and Catskill Mountains.|$|E

Late in August the Air Force began flare missions over North Korea. B-29 Superfortresses would release parachute flares at 10,000 <b>feet</b> <b>that</b> ignited at 6,000 feet, whereupon co-operating B-26 bombers attacked any enemy movement discovered in the illuminated area.|$|E
25|$|Many car {{parks are}} {{independent}} buildings dedicated exclusively to that use. The design loads for car parks are often {{less than the}} office building they serve (50 psf versus 80 psf), leading to long floor spans of 55–60 <b>feet</b> <b>that</b> permit cars to park in rows without supporting columns in between. The most common structural systems in the United States for these structures are either prestressed concrete double-tee floor systems or post-tensioned cast-in-place concrete floor systems.|$|E

25|$|Many {{individuals}} with A-T develop deformities of the <b>feet</b> <b>that</b> compound the difficulty {{they have with}} walking due to impaired coordination. Early treatment may slow progression of this deformity. Bracing or surgical correction sometimes improves stability at the ankle sufficient to enable an individual to walk with support, or bear weight during assisted standing transfers from one seat to another. Severe scoliosis is relatively uncommon, but probably does occur more often than in those without A-T. Spinal fusion is only rarely indicated.|$|E

Their hands are depicted with four fingers and an opposable thumb, with larger fingertips and red dots on their underside.

25|$|Many locals say Orang Pendek's feet {{look like}} those of a child, {{evidenced}} by foot prints they have found while walking through the forest. However, another local animal, the sun bear, is a possible source of these sightings. Bears in general are known for having <b>feet</b> <b>that</b> look quite human-like, and the size of a sun bear's {{are similar to those of}} a child. In addition, gibbons populate the forests in this area and are known to occasionally descend to the ground and walk for a few seconds at a time on two legs. Witnesses could possibly be seeing orangutans; however: 1) this species has long been thought to have died out in all but the northern regions of Sumatra and 2) witnesses almost never describe the animal as having orange fur.|$|E

25|$|Weta created {{numerous}} {{pieces of}} prosthetics, {{and would have}} to monitor them on set too. They created 1800 Orc body suits to go with 10,000 Orc heads, lasting six days and one day respectively. Weta also spent a year creating Hobbit <b>feet</b> <b>that</b> would look like furry feet yet act as shoes for actors. In total, 1800 pairs were used by the four lead actors during production. Actors would also go in for face casts to create pointed ears and false noses. Most extensive was John Rhys-Davies as Gimli, who would spend four-and-a-half hours in the morning to apply Dwarven prosthetics. Gino Acevedo also worked on created realistic skin tones for the actors, such as Bernard Hill's possessed Théoden and a younger Bilbo. Peter(s) King and Owen also led the make-up department in making numerous wigs and creating general dirt on the actors. As well as applying make-up, {{at the end of the}} day there was an hour of carefully removing the make-up and prosthetics. As well as the prosthetics, there were also numerous corpses of actors and horses.|$|E
25|$|The first {{indications}} of A-T usually occur during the toddler years. Children start walking at a normal age, {{but may not}} improve much from their initial wobbly gait. Sometimes they have problems standing or sitting still and tend to sway backward or from side to side. In primary school years, walking becomes more difficult, and children will use doorways and walls for support. Children with A-T often appear better when running or walking quickly in comparison to when they are walking slowly or standing in one place. Around {{the beginning of their}} second decade, children with typical forms of A-T start using a wheelchair for long distances. During school years, children may have increasing difficulty with reading because of impaired coordination of eye movement. At the same time, other problems with fine-motor functions (writing, coloring, and using utensils to eat), and with slurring of speech (dysarthria) may arise. Most of these neurologic problems stop progressing after the age of about 12 – 15 years, though involuntary movements may start at any age and may worsen over time. These extra movements can take many forms, including small jerks of the hands and <b>feet</b> <b>that</b> look like fidgeting (chorea), slower twisting movements of the upper body (athetosis), adoption of stiff and twisted postures (dystonia), occasional uncontrolled jerks (myoclonic jerks), and various rhythmic and non-rhythmic movements with attempts at coordinated action (tremors).|$|E

25|$|The first {{crossbow}} fibulae, {{from the}} early 3rd century AD, has short, thin arms, no knobs, a long bow and a short foot. The later crossbow fibulae have been divided into groups by several archeologists including Keller, Prottel and Soupault. Type I, dating to the 3rd and 4th centuries, has small, simple knobs and a <b>foot</b> <b>that</b> is shorter than the bow. Type II, dating to the 4th century, has larger knobs and a <b>foot</b> <b>that</b> is approximately the same length as the bow. Type III, also dating to the 4th century, has a <b>foot</b> <b>that</b> is longer than the bow. There are several variants of the Type III based on the decoration of the foot: dotted circles, chevrons, or curlicues. Another variant, dating to the 4th and 5th centuries, the Bugelkopf type, has no transverse bar, or arms at all but retains the round knob at the head.|$|R
