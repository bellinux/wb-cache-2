40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} three {{algorithms used}} {{for the analysis of}} gray <b>level</b> <b>histograms.</b> Two of them are easily developed from standard techniques and the other is a completely new method. We will study the advantages of each and give examples of real-world use. Gray <b>level</b> <b>histogram</b> analysis (mainly threshold computation) is a known technique that allows easy and fast segmentation of the regions of interest in an image [1]. Many methods have been proposed for this problem [2], but almost all of them focus only on the problem of bimodal histograms. We will deal with multimodal histograms and, besides, we improve the time efficiency of the most widely used method (Otsu’s [3]). Finally, we investigate the potentials of these techniques for scalar quantifiers design (because Otsu method is a clustering technique) ...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a fast machine vision method for the {{automatic}} inspection of defects in textured surfaces. Traditional 2 D Gabor filtering schemes have shown to be very effective for detecting local anomalies in textured surfaces of industrial materials. However, they are computationally expensive and sensitive to image rotation. In order to alleviate the limitations of 2 D Gabor filtering, we first use the 1 D ring-projection transformation to compress a 2 D <b>gray-</b> <b>level</b> image to a 1 D pattern, and then employ a 1 D Gabor filter to detect defects embedded in a homogeneous texture. Given a problem with image size N x N and filter window W x W, the computational complexity can be significantly reduced from O(W 2 N 2) in the 2 D Gabor space to O(WN 2) in the 1 D Gabor space, and the detection results are invariant to rotation changes of a texture. The experiments on structural textures such as wooden surface, LCD display and machined surface, and statistical textures such as granite, leather and sandpaper have shown the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method...|$|R

First analyze the distribution of image gray <b>level</b> <b>histogram</b> and find the optimum threshold values, then set the model’s initial contours with thresholds and construct energy functional, lastly iterate the functional formulations until convergence to the object boundary.

The main objective is to select the features that best describe a tissue characteristic of a healthy kidney from ultrasound image. Three ultrasound machines that have different specifications are used {{in order to get a}} different quality (different resolution) of ultrasound image. Initially, the acquired images are manually cropped to get the region of interest (ROI) of kidney. Then the cropped images are undergoing filtering process to remove the speckle noise that presence in the ultrasound images. Four filtering techniques (Wiener filter, Median filter, Gaussian Low Pass filter and Histogram Equalization) are tested to find the best filtering technique for all the three groups of image. By calculating Mean Square Error (MSE) and Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR), result shows that Gaussian Lowpass Filter having the highest PSNR, then is choose as the filtering method for this thesis. These enhanced images then are segment to create a foreground and background where the mask is created. In this thesis, only statistical based texture features method is used which depends on the spatial distribution of intensity values or gray levels in the kidney region. Three statistical {{feature extraction}}s techniques used are Intensity <b>Histogram</b> (IH), <b>Gray-</b> <b>Level</b> Co-Occurance Matrix (GLCM) and Gray-level run-length matrix (GLRLM).
