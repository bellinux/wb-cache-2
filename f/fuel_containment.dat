A parametric analysis is performed which studies how the average containment time, average number density, and mass loading of the fuel vary as a function of several design and operational parameters. The containing effect of the injected fluids is studied by varying the velocity and injection angle of the outer wall flow. The effect of rocket acceleration on the containment of the fuel is also examined. The results offer both a qualitative and quantitative look at <b>fuel</b> <b>containment,</b> thereby providing another step toward establishing the feasibility, or lack thereof, of the open‐cycle gas core nuclear rocket...|$|E

5000|$|The first {{suggestion}} {{for this type}} of reactor came in 1947 from Prof. Dr. Farrington Daniels at Oak Ridge, who also created the name [...] "pebble-bed reactor". The concept of a very simple, very safe reactor, with a commoditized nuclear fuel was developed by Professor Dr. Rudolf Schulten in the 1950s. The crucial breakthrough was the idea of combining <b>fuel,</b> structure, <b>containment,</b> and neutron moderator in a small, strong sphere. The concept was enabled by the realization that engineered forms of silicon carbide and pyrolytic carbon were quite strong, even at temperatures as high as 2000 °C (3600 °F). The natural geometry of close-packed spheres then provides the ducting (the spaces between the spheres) and spacing for the reactor core. To make the safety simple, the core has a low power density, about 1/30 the power density of a light water reactor.|$|R

50|$|On Friday, April 15, 2011, a T-hawk drone {{was used}} to conduct {{surveillance}} of the damaged Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear power station. This nuclear plant suffered severe damage {{as a result of}} a devastating earthquake and tsunami which struck the east coast of Japan one month earlier. The damage resulted in several of the reactors at the facility undergoing partial meltdown, releasing radioactivity into the local area. The radiation was thousands of times above the safe limit for exposure, making the area unsafe for human habitation. The radiation was intense enough to make even short-term exposure hazardous, preventing people from going in to assess the damage. The T-hawk drone took numerous photographs of the damaged reactor housings, turbine buildings, spent nuclear <b>fuel</b> rod <b>containment</b> pools, and associated facilities damaged by the earthquake, tsunami, and subsequent hydrogen gas explosions at the facility. This allowed Tokyo Electric Power Co. (TEPCO) to better determine where the releases of radioactivity were coming from and how to best deal with them.|$|R

40|$|A {{methodology}} of experimental simulation {{of state of}} spent nuclear fuel that occurs on the sea floor due to some catastrophes or dumping is developed. Data on long-term (more than 2000 days) experiments on estimation of 85 Kr and 137 Cs release rate from spent nuclear fuel (fragments of irradiated UO 2 pellets) were firstly obtained; these estimates prove correctness of a hypothesis offered by us in early 1990 s concerning to earlier 85 Kr release (by one order of magnitude {{higher than that of}} 137 Cs) as compared to other fission fragments in case of loss of integrity of <b>fuel</b> <b>containment</b> as a result of corrosion on the sea floor. A method and technique of onboard 85 Kr and 137 Cs sampling and extraction (as well as sampling of tritium, product of triple 235 U fission) and their radiometric analysis at coastal laboratories are developed.

40|$|The Lewis Research Center of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration {{initiated}} a project at Battelle Memorial Institute {{for the purpose}} of fabricating clad <b>fuel</b> pellet <b>containment</b> vessel assemblies. These assemblies house clad fuel pellets containing enriched fuel. Irradiation studies of these assemblies in the NASA Plum Brook Reactor will provide data required for the desigi of thermionic converter reactors being considered by NASA. Three major objectives were defined at the initiation of this project at Battelle. These were (1) to provide containment vessel assemblies for irradiation studies, (2) to identify the best fuel dispersion/cladding combination for the fueled pellets, and (3) to identify and optimize the most promising fabrication technique to the extent necessary to provide reproducible specimens. In addition to these major objectives, other goals were defined in relation to supporting studies required for the successful conclusion of this program. The approach for accomplishing these objectives involved the cooperation of various research and research support groups at Battelle. These groups contributed to the overall program by involvement in the following areas: (1) Preparation or procurement of various types of UO{sub 2 } fuel particles; (2) Application of tungsten coating to the fuel particles; (3) Development of various powder-consolidation techniques for the fuel form including use of explosive methods and hot isostatic pressing; (4) Selection and evaluation of high-temperature claddings for the fuel form; (5) Development of techniques for cladding application to the fuel form; (6) Evaluation of candidate systems by thermal cycling; (7) Fabrication of irradiation containment vessels and the associated components; and (8) Conduction of appropriate supporting studies associated with welding and brazing of the containment vessel components. The objectives of this program were accomplished to the extent that two clad <b>fuel</b> pellet <b>containment</b> vessel assemblies were completed and forwarded to NASA for irradiation testing. In conjunction with this effort, a compatible fuel-cladding system was developed for the clad fuel pellet as well as a fabrication process.

50|$|In {{a nuclear}} meltdown, {{the most severe}} outcome of a steam {{explosion}} is early containment failure. Two possibilities are the ejection at high pressure of molten <b>fuel</b> into the <b>containment,</b> causing rapid heating; or an in-vessel steam explosion causing ejection of a missile (such as the upper head) into, and through, the containment. Less dramatic but still significant is that the molten mass of fuel and reactor core melts through {{the floor of the}} reactor building and reaches ground water; a steam explosion might occur, but the debris would probably be contained, and would in fact, being dispersed, probably be more easily cooled.

40|$|Composite {{pressure}} vessels, {{used extensively}} for gas and <b>fuel</b> <b>containment</b> in space vehicles, are generally constructed with a metallic liner, while the fiber reinforcement carries the {{major portion of}} the pressure-induced load. The design {{is dominated by the}} liner s low strain at yield since the reinforcing fibers cannot operate at their potential load-bearing capability without resorting to pre-stressing (or autofrettaging). An ultra high-efficiency pressure vessel, which operates at the optimum strain capability of the fibers, can be potentially achieved with a liner-less construction. This paper discusses the design and manufacturing challenges to be overcome in the development of such a pressure vessel. These include: (1) gas/liquid containment and permeation, (2) design and structural analysis, and (3) manufacturing process development. The paper also presents the development and validation tests on a liner-less pressure vessel developed by Kaiser Compositek Inc. (KCI).

The sensor is designed such that liquid swelling polymers transduce their swelling into a microbend force on an optical fibre when exposed to hydrocarbon fuels. Interrogation of the sensor using standard Optical Time Domain Reflectometry (OTDR) techniques provides the possibility of rapidly detecting and locating target hydrocarbon fuels and chemicals at multiple positions along the sensor length.

40|$|Due to the {{formation}} of radioactive fission products in the nuclear fission process, safety regulations for the operation of nuclear power plants are much more severe than for conventional Stations. The prevention of fission product release from fuel elements is therefore one of the main problems of nuclear power production. Whereas the fuel in water or liquid metal cooled reactors is contained in a metal cladding, the only material which can be used as <b>fuel</b> <b>containment</b> in a heliumcooled high temperature reactor (HTR) is graphite. Industrial graphites, however, generally display a high permeability for fission products. That leads to the use of coated particles to load feed and breed material into the fuel elements of HTR's.

40|$|Cylindrical fuel casks {{often have}} impact {{limiters}} surrounding just {{the ends of}} the cask shaft in a typical 'dumbbell' arrangement. The primary purpose of these impact limiters is to absorb energy to reduce loads on the cask structure during impacts associated with a severe accident. Impact limiters are also credited in many packages with protecting closure seals and maintaining lower peak temperatures during fire events. For this credit to be taken in safety analyses, the impact limiter attachment system must be shown to retain the impact limiter following Normal Conditions of Transport (NCT) and Hypothetical Accident Conditions (HAC) impacts. Large casks are often certified by analysis only because of the costs associated with testing. Therefore, some cask impact limiter attachment systems have not been tested in real impacts.

These {{nuclear power plants}} (NPPs) not only offer a small power size (less than 300 MWe), a reduced spatial footprint, and modularized compact designs {{fabricated}} in factories and transported to the intended sites, but also passive safety features. Some light water (LW) -SMRs have already been granted by Department of Energy: NuScale and mPower. New LW-SMRs are mainly inspired by the early LW-SMRs (such as process-inherent ultimate safety (PIUS), international reactor innovative and secure (IRIS), and safe integral reactor (SIR)). LW-SMRs employ significantly fewer components to decrease costs and increase simplicity of design. However, new physical challenges have appeared with these changes.

The effective thermal conductivity of this composite structure is dependent on the interaction of the parts via various physical phenomena, and therefore is difficult to infer accurately from the conductivity of the constituent materials. A mock-up of the annular <b>fuel</b> rod <b>containment</b> thimble was created to allow the conductivity of the annular lead bismuth eutectic-filled gap to be measured. An electric rod heater was used to provide temperatures similar to the in-core environment, and conductivity was determined based on thermocouple temperature readings at various points across the gap. A second series of experiments substituted a steel tube for the aluminum thimble, and used a bucket of stationary water as coolant. The purpose of these changes was to increase the temperature of the eutectic and achieve a larger melted fraction, {{while at the same time}} creating a large enough temperature drop across the gap to allow reliable measurements. A third series of experiments refined the setup and were able to produce more precise measurements of the thermal conductivity. The measured conductivities were between 4 and 8 W/m-K, much lower than the reported conductivity of the lead bismuth at about 10 W/m-K. The difference must be attributed to thermal resistances at the eutectic-aluminum and eutectic-steel interfaces. This, and the inherent difficulty of measuring the interface temperature due to the finite width of the thermocouples and the existence of sharp thermal gradients makes it difficult to further reduce the uncertainty in the measured conductivity...|$|R
40|$|This work {{presents}} a Guidance Navigation and Control (GNC) model {{to manage the}} rendezvous phase of an active spacecraft with an uncooperative small orbiting capsule, containing samples collected on a planetary surface. To enable autonomous navigation the chaser exploits a Model Predictive Control system (MPC) to settle a close loop architecture and to handle close proximity maneuvers constraints, such as the Line-of-Sight cone constraint on position, and safety path constraints imposed to design safe trajectories in case of contingencies occurrence, like thrusters failures. Since these constraints are convex, the optimization step of the guidance algorithm exploits the linear and quadratic programming and, since the mission may ask for an elliptic orbit, the prediction of the relative trajectory uses the Linear Time Variant state transition matrix developed by Yamanaka-Ankersen. The guidance algorithm is split into two phases: a first phase, which privileges the <b>fuel</b> consumption <b>containment,</b> applies a Variable Horizon MPC with linear programming and is composed {{by a set of}} hop branches and holding points; a second phase which is based on a fixed receding horizon MPC and quadratic programming to minimize the target capture error. The MPC with LTV state prediction, taking advantage of a linearized attitude error modeling, is exploited to include in the proposed architecture the attitude dynamics and control, harmonized with the orbital required dynamics. As a consequence, the control is given in terms of each thruster activation timeline (assuming Pulse Width Modulation) to provoke expected control force and torque on the chaser. Relative navigation is based on an single optic camera, modelled to assess the target illumination conditions impact on the guidance performance. Results from the Montecarlo analyses - run to assess the GNC sensitivity to different parameters (e. g. sampling time, cost function weights, horizon length, target orbit parameters) are presented.

Such cycle range from cryogenic temperatures associated with cryogenic <b>fuel</b> (LN, LOX) <b>containment</b> to high temperatures of 300 degrees associated with future hypervelocity aeropropulsion systems. Microcrack development thresholds {{as a function of}} temperature range of the thermal cycle, the number of cycles, and the applied stress level imposed on the composite are reported. We have conducted stress-thermal cycles on thin bismaleimide-woven carbon fiber foils for three temperature range cycles. The principle findings are that the full cycles from - 196 degree celsius up to 250 degree celsius cause the most significant microcrack development. These observations indicate that the high temperature portion of the cycle under load causes fiber-matrix interface failure and subsequent exposure to higher stresses at the cryogenic, low temperature region results in composite matrix microcracking {{as a result of the}} additional stresses associated with the fiber-matrix thermal expansion mismatch. Our initial studies for 12 ply PMR-II- 50 polyimide/M 6 OJB carbon fabric [0 f, 90 f, 90 f, 0 f, 0 f, 90 f] composites will be presented. The stress-thermal cycle test procedure for these will be described. Moisture absorption characteristics between cycles will be used to monitor interconnected microcrack development. The applied stress level will be 75 percent of the composite cryogenic - 196 degree celsius ultimate strength...|$|R
