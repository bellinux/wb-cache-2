25|$|Many of the {{elements}} that form volatile high-valence fluorides will also form volatile high-valence chlorides. Chlorination and distillation is another possible method for separation. The sequence of separation may differ usefully from the sequence for fluorides; for example, zirconium tetrachloride and tin tetrachloride have relatively low boiling points of 331°C and 114.1°C. Chlorination has even been proposed as a method for removing zirconium <b>fuel</b> <b>cladding,</b> instead of mechanical decladding.|$|E
25|$|Removal of fission {{products}} {{is similar to}} reprocessing of solid fuel elements - by chemical or physical means the highly valuable fissile fuel is separated from the waste {{fission products}}. Ideally the fertile fuel (thorium or U-238) and other fuel components (e.g. carrier salt or <b>fuel</b> <b>cladding</b> in solid fuels) can also be reused for new fuel.

Intermediate-level wastes includes resins, chemical sludge and metal nuclear <b>fuel</b> <b>cladding,</b> as well as contaminated materials from reactor decommissioning. It may be solidified in concrete or bitumen for disposal. As a general rule, short-lived waste (mainly non-fuel materials from reactors) is buried in shallow repositories, while long-lived waste (from fuel and fuel reprocessing) is deposited in geological repository. U.S. regulations do not define this category of waste; the term is used in Europe and elsewhere.|$|E

To demonstrate the effects of the conservatism, a brief sensitivity analysis is performed in which a few of the key system parameters are varied to determine their effect on the <b>fuel</b> <b>clad</b> temperatures.

25|$|Nuclear fuel in {{the reactor}} {{pressure}} vessel {{is engaged in a}} fission chain reaction, which produces heat, heating the water in the primary coolant loop by thermal conduction through the <b>fuel</b> <b>cladding.</b> The hot primary coolant is pumped into a heat exchanger called the steam generator, where it flows through hundreds or thousands of small tubes. Heat is transferred through the walls of these tubes to the lower pressure secondary coolant located on the sheet side of the exchanger where the coolant evaporates to pressurized steam. The transfer of heat is accomplished without mixing the two fluids to prevent the secondary coolant from becoming radioactive. Some common steam generator arrangements are u-tubes or single pass heat exchangers.|$|E
25|$|Pressurized water reactor (PWR) fuel {{consists}} of cylindrical rods put into bundles. A uranium oxide ceramic is formed into pellets and inserted into Zircaloy tubes that are bundled together. The Zircaloy tubes are about 1cm in diameter, and the <b>fuel</b> <b>cladding</b> gap {{is filled with}} helium gas to improve the conduction of heat from the fuel to the cladding. There are about 179-264 fuel rods per fuel bundle and about 121 to 193 fuel bundles are loaded into a reactor core. Generally, the fuel bundles consist of fuel rods bundled 14×14 to 17×17. PWR fuel bundles are about 4 meters long. In PWR fuel bundles, control rods are inserted through the top directly into the fuel bundle. The fuel bundles usually are enriched several percent in 235U. The uranium oxide is dried before inserting into the tubes to try to eliminate moisture in the ceramic fuel {{that can lead to}} corrosion and hydrogen embrittlement. The Zircaloy tubes are pressurized with helium to try to minimize pellet-cladding interaction which can lead to fuel rod failure over long periods.|$|E

40|$|A simple {{conduction}} {{model with}} phase {{change has been}} developed for the transient analysis of a fuel pin based on average properties and lumped-parameter techniques. The transient behavior of <b>fuel</b> and <b>cladding</b> can be accurately described by simple analytical expressions that agree with conventional numerical approaches for under-cooling transient analysis. If it be assumed that the heat-transfer resistance between the <b>fuel</b> and <b>cladding</b> remains the same for both steady-state and transient periods, the phase-change problem for <b>fuel</b> and <b>cladding</b> melting can be significantly simplified. BY using the predetermined average overall heat-transfer coefficient across a fuel pin in the steady-state period, the average transient <b>fuel</b> and <b>cladding</b> temperatures can be formulated analytically.

2500|$|As the {{pressure}} in the primary system continued to decrease, reactor coolant continued to flow, but it was boiling inside the core. First, small bubbles of steam formed and immediately collapsed, known as nucleate boiling. As the system pressure decreased further, steam pockets began to form in the reactor coolant. This {{departure from nucleate boiling}} (DNB) into the regime of [...] "film boiling" [...] caused steam voids in coolant channels, blocking the flow of liquid coolant and greatly increasing the <b>fuel</b> <b>cladding</b> temperature. The overall water level inside the pressurizer was rising despite the loss of coolant through the open pilot-operated relief valve, as the volume of these steam voids increased much more quickly than coolant was lost. Because of the lack of a dedicated instrument to measure the level of water in the core, operators judged the level of water in the core solely by the level in the pressurizer. Since it was high, they assumed that the core was properly covered with coolant, unaware that because of steam forming in the reactor vessel, the indicator provided misleading readings. Indications of high water levels contributed to the confusion, as operators were concerned about the primary loop [...] "going solid," [...] (i.e. no steam pocket buffer existing in the pressurizer) which in training they had been instructed to never allow. This confusion was a key contributor to the initial failure to recognize the accident as a loss-of-coolant accident, and led operators to turn off the emergency core cooling pumps, which had automatically started after the pilot-operated relief valve stuck and core coolant loss began, due to fears the system was being overfilled.|$|E

The jagged edges of the pellet can rub and interact with the inner cladding wall. During power increases in the fuel pellet, the ceramic fuel material expands faster than the <b>fuel</b> <b>cladding,</b> and the jagged edges of the fuel pellet begin to press into the cladding, potentially causing a perforation. To prevent this from occurring, two corrective actions were taken.

This General Purpose Heat Source (GPHS) is fabricated using iridium clad vent sets to contain the plutonium oxide fuel pellets.
