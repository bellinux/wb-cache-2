Those arrested who were found not guilty were either exiled if relatives of the convicted or released and returned to Dujail. Only 96 of the 148 condemned were actually executed, two of the condemned were accidentally released while a third was mistakenly transferred to another prison and survived. The 96 executed included four men mistakenly executed after having been found not guilty and ordered released.

2500|$|He {{could not}} find any legal {{authority}} or precedent for the respondents' argument that the SCA violation, which was not before the Court, rendered the search per se unconstitutional. To the contrary, {{he pointed to the}} Virginia v. Moore case decided the previous term, in which evidence from a search conducted after an <b>illegal</b> <b>arrest</b> was ruled admissible since statutory violations did not inherently constitute Fourth Amendment violations. Nor would an SCA violation have rendered the actions of petitioners unconstitutional since they themselves did not violate it. [...] "The otherwise reasonable search by OPD is not rendered unreasonable by the assumption that Arch Wireless violated the SCA by turning over the transcripts".|$|E

This was a way of protesting the <b>illegal</b> <b>arrests</b> they were suffering.|$|R

50|$|Hitler {{was sworn}} in as Chancellor on the morning of 30 January 1933 in what some {{observers}} later described as a brief and indifferent ceremony. By early February, a mere week after Hitler's assumption of the chancellorship, the government had begun to clamp down on the opposition. Meetings of the left-wing parties were banned and even some of the moderate parties found their members threatened and assaulted. Measures with an appearance of legality suppressed the Communist Party in mid-February and included the plainly <b>illegal</b> <b>arrests</b> of Reichstag deputies.|$|R

50|$|The main {{criticism}} of the state's measures, as mentioned above, is that a national state is expected {{to enforce the law}} and respect human rights, even when repressing violent criminals that do not show such respect.

This type of detention was determined to intrude on interests protected by the Fourth Amendment. It is therefore necessary to safeguard against <b>illegal</b> <b>arrest.</b> Proper Miranda warnings did not attenuate the misconduct of the police and the confession should have been suppressed.|$|E
