500|$|Lead singer Bart Millard has {{described}} the story behind [...] "So Long Self" [...] as [...] "...really simple: Itâ€™s Not About [...] It never has been and it never will be. Just like when maybe you had to break up with a girlfriend or a boyfriend growing up, or maybe the same thing <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> the ultimate breakup in life is when we breakup with ourselves. Because Christ said you have to die to self to follow him". The song is also lyrically about a break-up with sinful human nature.|$|E
500|$|Timberlake and Scott Storch wrote [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] with Timbaland, who {{produced}} the song. Storch found working with Timberlake easy {{because of the}} song's meaning. Reporters believed its lyrics were inspired by Timberlake's romantic relationship with American recording artist Britney Spears, which ended in 2002. Timberlake told MTV News, [...] "I'm not going to specifically say if any song is about anybody. I will say writing a couple of songs on the record helped me deal {{with a couple of}} things. To me songs are songs. They can stem from things that completely <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> personally or they can stem from ideas that you think could happen to you." [...] In December 2011, Timberlake admitted that he had written [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] after an argument with Spears: [...] "I was on a phone call that was not the most enjoyable phone call. I walked into the studio and he [...] could tell I was visibly angry." [...] Timbaland recalled, [...] "I was like, 'Man, don't worry about it' and he was like, 'I can't believe she did that to me' and he was like, 'You were my sun, you were my earth'".|$|E

Hubris is not the requital of past injuries; this is revenge. As for the pleasure in hubris, its cause is this: naive men think that by ill-treating others they make their own superiority the greater.|$|E

5000|$|Ben Kweller adopts {{the word}} [...] "Dayenu" [...] {{in the song}} Lizzy on his album Sha Sha. On his website he writes: [...] "Dienu is like an old folk word that's Hebrew and it means 'it would have been enough'... when {{something}} good <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> and then another good thing <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> What you had {{in the first place}} would have been enough, if nothing else <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> It's all about counting your blessings and staying grounded".|$|R

[...] "He reckons that if this trauma <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> when you were five or six then, emotionally, that part of you remains five or six. And {{what you have to}} do is carry that five- or six-year-old around with you and try and emotionally help that other part of you. It sounds a bit airy-fairy, but I think he's something of a genius, Mr. Bradshaw." ...|$|E
2500|$|Nonetheless, Orange Man soon sparked large {{controversy}} {{in the media and}} in public after it was discovered children had copied the events of the advertisement in playgrounds and injured themselves; Rupert Howell, a Tango advertisement executive, stated in 2000 that Orange Man [...] "sparked a playground craze" [...] where [...] "people used to go round sort of slapping each other and saying 'You've Been Tango'd', and it was all very entertaining and great fun. There were no problems until we got a phone call once from a surgeon who said 'look, I'm not the complaining type but I thought you'd like to know that I did an operation on a child this morning with a damaged ear drum, and I was wheeling him in to the operating table, and said to him 'what <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> then?' and replied 'I got Tango'd.'" [...] As a result, Howell pulled the advertisement from television that afternoon, although other reports erroneously state that the advertisement was banned.|$|E
2500|$|In November 1934, Wilson {{was visited}} by old {{drinking}} companion Ebby Thacher. Wilson was astounded {{to find that}} Thacher had been sober for several weeks {{under the guidance of}} the evangelical Christian Oxford Group. Wilson took some interest in the group, but shortly after Thacher's visit, he was again admitted to Towns Hospital to recover from a bout of drinking. This was his fourth and last stay at Towns hospital under Doctor Silkworth's care and he showed signs of delirium tremens. It was while undergoing treatment with The Belladonna Cure that Wilson experienced his [...] "Hot Flash" [...] spiritual conversion and quit drinking. Earlier that evening, Thacher had visited and tried to persuade him to turn himself over to the care of a Christian deity who would liberate him from alcohol. According to Wilson, while lying in bed depressed and despairing, he cried out, [...] "I'll do anything! Anything at all! If there be a God, let Him show Himself!" [...] He then had the sensation of a bright light, a feeling of ecstasy, and a new serenity. He never drank again for the remainder of his life. Wilson described his experience to Dr. Silkworth, who told him, [...] "Something has <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> I don't understand. [...] But you had better hang on to it".|$|E
