40|$|The <b>draperies</b> are {{the most}} {{interesting}} 3 D element in fashion design. According to the ways of their constructing they {{are the most}} interesting 3 D element for the process of pattern making too. They can be classified as free and fixed types. In clothing’ design the both types can be used as only decorative or combined decorative and constructional elements. The <b>draperies</b> are used in every type of ladies’ clothing but may be the ladies’ dresses give possibilities for the more interesting designs. An investigation of all possible ways for designing and pattern making of <b>draperies</b> with decorative and constructional function in fashion design of ladies’ dresses is presented in the paper. The free <b>draperies</b> located in the neckline have been presented in the paper, but the same ways of fashion design and pattern making can be used in down parts of dresses, skirts and trousers, in which <b>draperies</b> transform the waist darts. Analogical ways can be used in other details but in these cases the <b>draperies</b> will be with only decorative function. In the pattern making of the free <b>draperies</b> the number of the folds depends on the number of the equidistant arcs, but in the pattern making of the fixed <b>draperies</b> it is not binding the number of the folds to be equated to the number of lines which divide the detail. For the fixed <b>draperied</b> the fan-shaped arrangement according to only one line is enough and the bigger number of folds {{is a result of the}} interlacement. All studied in the paper ways of pattern making cover every possibility for fashion design of ladies’ dresses or other ladies’ garments with free or fixed <b>draperies</b> with decorative and constructional function. The results of the presented investigation of free and fixed <b>draperies</b> facilitate the process of fashion design and pattern making and gives opportunity for variety of models...|$|R

In addition to describing his usage of orpiment to de Mayerne, Johnson also told Daniel King his technique for <b>draperies.</b> For linen <b>draperies</b> he used [...] "white and oker broken with bone black". For blue <b>draperies,</b> he first laid in [...] "all the background folds and shadows ... neatly and perfectly finished" [...] with [...] "indico ground in drying oiland mixt wth smalt and white".

5|$|The {{painting}} {{contains elements}} typical of Cimabue's representations of Christ, including the illusionism of the <b>drapery</b> folds, the large halo, long flowing hair, dark, angular faces and dramatic expressions.

5|$|Appliqué art, {{which is}} a stitching-based craft unlike embroidery, was pioneered by Hatta Maharana of Pipili. It is widely used in Puri, both for {{decoration}} of the deities and for sale. Maharana's family members are employed as darjis or tailors or sebaks by the Maharaja of Puri. They prepare articles for decorating the deities in the temple for various festivals and religious ceremonies. The appliqué works are brightly coloured and patterned fabric {{in the form of}} canopies, umbrellas, <b>drapery,</b> carry bags, flags, coverings of dummy horses and cows, and other household textiles; these are marketed in Puri.

5|$|During the Nara period, from 710 to 794, the {{government}} established and supported workshops called zōbussho, {{the most prominent}} of which was located in the capital Nara at Tōdai-ji, which produced Buddhist statuary. Clay, lacquer and wood, in addition to bronze, were used. Stylistically, the sculptures were influenced by the high Tang style, showing fuller body modelling, more natural <b>drapery</b> and a greater sense of movement. Representative examples of Nara period sculpture include the Great Buddha and the Four Heavenly Kings at Tōdai-ji, or the Eight Legions at Kōfuku-ji.|$|E

5|$|McGregor {{was married}} to Jessie, and the couple had a {{daughter}} and a son, also named Jessie and William. A teetotaller, McGregor was {{a supporter of the}} Temperance movement, and was active in the local branch of the Liberal Party until his membership lapsed in 1882 due to the increasing amount of time he devoted to football. He was involved in the early attempts to establish a baseball league in the United Kingdom, and served as the honorary treasurer of the Baseball Association of Great Britain and Ireland. Despite his commitment to sport, he held desperately on to his <b>drapery</b> business throughout his life.|$|E
5|$|Official {{regulation}} {{states that}} the flag must never touch the ground or water, or {{be used as a}} <b>drapery</b> in any form.

When out in the open, the flag should always be flown between sunrise and sunset, irrespective of the weather conditions. Prior to 2009, the flag could be flown on a public building at night under special circumstances; currently, Indian citizens can fly the flag even at night, subject to the restriction that the flag should be hoisted on a tall flagpole and be well-illuminated.|$|E

5|$|The design bears close {{similarities}} to Burne-Jones's Luna (painted in watercolour 1870 and in oils 1872–1875), which also shows a female figure in classical <b>drapery</b> on a globe surrounded by clouds. As {{with many of}} Watts's works {{the style of the}} painting was rooted in the European Symbolist movement, but also drew heavily on the Venetian school of painting. Other works which have been suggested as possible influences on Hope include Burne-Jones's The Wheel of Fortune (c.1870), Albert Moore's Beads (1875), Dante Gabriel Rossetti's A Sea–Spell (1877), and The Throne of Saturn by Elihu Vedder (1884).|$|E
5|$|Born in Braco in Perthshire, Scotland, McGregor {{first became}} {{interested}} in football after watching a match between locals and visiting artisans at Ardoch. He served an apprenticeship as a draper in Perth, and in 1870, following the example of his brother Peter, moved to Birmingham, and opened his own <b>drapery</b> business in Aston, an area just outside the city. Upon his arrival in the English Midlands he became involved with a local football club, Calthorpe, which had been formed by a fellow Scot, Campbell Orr. McGregor was enthusiastic enough about the game to arrange for his shop to close early on Saturdays {{to allow him to}} watch matches, and he later sold football kits at the shop, which became a popular meeting place for football enthusiasts.|$|E
5|$|Candaules {{shows the}} moment at which Gyges, hiding behind the door, first catches sight of Nyssia's naked body. Candaules lies naked in bed, while Nyssia undresses as she prepares to join him, and Gyges tiptoes around the door {{to catch a glimpse}} of her. Nyssia holds a piece of fabric, which forms a {{vertical}} line cutting off the body of Candaules at the top of his legs, invoking a theme of emasculation at the hands of a powerful woman. By positioning the figures in such a way that none are looking out of the picture, and the viewer is directly behind Nyssia, Etty intended that the viewer feel the same sense of voyeurism and intrusion that Gyges would have felt, forced to spy on his master's naked wife against his will and without her knowledge. The cluttered arrangement of <b>drapery</b> and architectural features intentionally exaggerates the claustrophobic and implicitly violent nature of the scene.|$|E
30|$|For the {{depiction}} of <b>draperies</b> and skies, the master obtained subtle color designs by employing a stratified system with underlying layers that were allowed to dry before subsequent layers were applied. In particular for the <b>draperies,</b> passages of translucent glazes were superimposed on strongly pigmented underpainting in order to temper the color tone of the latter and/or to modulate forms and deep shadows. In the case of dark red and blue colored <b>draperies,</b> loose impastos of bright paint were added to evoke the highlights. For instance, the underpainting of red <b>draperies</b> was composed of vermilion mixed with lead white, sometimes with small addition of iron reds, red lakes and/or calcium-based fillers (calcite and gypsum) to further modify the vivid color of vermilion. Next, transparent glazes were employed in areas of shadow, based on red lake {{with the addition of}} a carbon-based black. Finally, impastoed highlights containing vermilion mixed with lead white and red lake were applied.|$|R
