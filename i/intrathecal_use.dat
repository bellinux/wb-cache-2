40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: <b>Intrathecal</b> opioids <b>used</b> {{to relieve}} labor pain have been {{associated}} with uterine hyperactivity and nonreassuring fetal heart rate abnormalities. We retrospectively evaluated all charts of singleton, term, vertex-presenting parturients in active labor requesting neuraxial pain relief during a 1 -year period for the occurrence of nonreassuring fetal heart rate tracings. METHODS: Three different strategies to relieve labor pain were routinely used in our department: conventional epidural using 10 mL bupivacaine 0. 125 % and sufentanil 0. 75 microg/mL; combined spinal and epidural (CSE) <b>using</b> <b>intrathecal</b> sufentanil (7. 5 microg); and CSE <b>using</b> <b>intrathecal</b> bupivacaine (2. 5 mg) and sufentanil (1. 5 microg). Charts (n = 1, 293) were evaluated for nonreassuring fetal heart tracings and uterine hyperactivity as well as for neonatal and labor outcome. RESULTS: Intrathecal sufentanil (7. 5 microg) produced significantly more nonreassuring tracings and uterine hyperactivity. However, this did not result in more cesarean deliveries or detrimental neonatal outcome. CONCLUSION: Based on this retrospective analysis, we conclude that intrathecal sufentanil in a dose of 7. 5 microg has the potential to result in more nonreassuring fetal heart rate tracings compared with both <b>intrathecal</b> analgesia <b>using</b> a bupivacaine (2. 5 mg) /sufentanil (1. 5 microg) mixture and epidural analgesia using bupivacaine, sufentanil, and epinephrine.

40|$|The {{effective}} treatment of patients suffering from neuropathic cancer pain remains a clinical challenge. When patients experience either insufficient analgesia or problematic side-effects after opioid administration, intrathecal administration of morphine and other medications such as bupivacaine and clonidine may offer significant advantages. Additionally, ketamine, a non-competitive N-methyl- d -Aspartate-receptor antagonist {{is able to}} alter pain perception at the spinal level. Because of the potential neurotoxicity after neuraxial use of racemic ketamine, intrathecal administration of the preservative-free active compound, S (+) -ketamine may be a valuable alternative.

Procedures and Results: A BIP model was first established. BIP rats showed lower paw withdrawal threshold (PWT) from day 1, which persisted for 21 days following the burn injury. Spinal SIRT 1 /Ac-H 3 expression increased following burn injury. The <b>intrathecal</b> <b>use</b> of resveratrol increased PWT and SIRT 1 expression but induced down-regulation of Ac-H 3 expression. We first demonstrated that the inhibition of SIRT 1 significantly induced mechanical allodynia in naïve rats. The preinjection of SIRT 1 inhibitor partly antagonized the analgesic effects of resveratrol in BIP rats. Conclusion: Inhibition of SIRT 1 produces pain facilitation in the naïve rats. The expression of spinal SIRT 1 increased after burn injury in the BIP model. The activation of spinal SIRT 1 might mediate the resveratrol-induced analgesic effects.
