40|$|AbstractOrganic {{peroxides}} have {{significance in}} organic synthesis and biological processes. Characterization of these compounds with weak O–O bonds is sometimes difficult {{due to their}} thermal instability and sensitivity to acid or base. Coordination of diacyl peroxides with AgBF 4 provides a means for analysis of these compounds by coordination ionspray tandem mass spectrometry (CIS-MS/MS). Precursor ion (Q 1) scans of acetyl benzoyl peroxide give two Ag+ adducts, [M + Ag + solvent]+ and [M + Ag + M]+. These silver ion adducts can be selectively dissociated (CID) to give unique structural information about the analyte. Decomposition of the [M + Ag + solvent]+ adduct generates fragmentation products due to apparent homolytic cleavage of the O–O bond followed by decarboxylation of the resultant radicals. The bis-diacylperoxide complex, [M + Ag + M]+ gives CID pathways that involve homolysis of the O–O bond and free radical cross-coupling of the two diacyl peroxides coordinated to the silver ion, i. e. formation of <b>dibenzoyl</b> <b>peroxide,</b> phenyl benzoate, and biphenyl from acetyl benzoyl peroxide.

Activation is effected by irradiation using an annular radiation source (3) close to the jet. Irradiation is at right angles to the jet. A reflective surface (2, 2 ') at least part-surrounds the jet. Photo- and/or thermochemical activation takes place. Irradiation takes place in the W band of electromagnetic radiation, resulting in photochemical activation. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - Alternatively, infra red radiation promotes thermochemical activation. In a further variant, the visible waveband is used, causing photochemical activation. The light is incoherent and continuous, or it is pulsed. Ultraviolet light is provided by e. g. a mercury lamp, photodiode and/or a flash lamp. In addition, the location on the solid where the jet impinges, is irradiated using one of the above methods. The etchant is a water-free halogen- containing organic or inorganic compound or mixture. It is a straight chain, branched, aliphatic, cycloaliphatic and/or aromatic C 1 -C 12 hydrocarbon which is at least partially halogenated. It is e. g. carbon tetrachloride, chloroform, bromoform, dichloromethane or a mixture of them. A wide range of further examples is specified in accordance with these principles, including diverse sulfur-, phosphorous- and ammonium compounds. Lewis-acids may be employed, especially boron trichloride or aluminum trichloride. The etchant includes at least one radical initiator, e. g. <b>dibenzoyl</b> <b>peroxide</b> or azo-isobutyronitrile. A radiation absorber is included, e. g. a dye, especially eosin, fluoroscene, phenolphthalein and/or Bengal red. It is alternatively a polycyclic aromatic compound, especially pyrene or napthacene. A solid body of silicon is used. AN INDEPENDENT CLAIM IS INCLUDED FOR corresponding apparatus. USE - To etch material from solids including semiconductor wafers, using an activated liquid jet. To cut, microstructure, dope solids, make local deposits, cut trenches and/or conduct metallization of solids or silicon wafers. (All claimed). Wafers may be cut from the single crystal by parallel jets. ADVANTAGE - The apparatus used, is not damaged by the etchant. This is because the etchant is not activated until after it has left the nozzle and is in flight. Virtually all of the activated etchant has sufficient life to reach and act upon the solid. Illumination of the jet at right angles, minimizes irradiation of and consequent undesired effects on the solid, avoiding problems of earlier laser-irradiation systems. Process efficiency is increased by mirrors, which are optionally elliptical, with the source at one focus, the jet at the other. Irradiation generates highly-reactive free radicals of e. g. chlorine, which etch silicon both directly and rapidly. Technical implementation is simple. Outstanding material removal is assured.

This {{problem was}} undertaken {{in order to establish}} fundamental copolymerization parameters for the system styrene, M 1, and acrylamidostearic acid, M 2. The propagation steps in the copolymerization of two monomers M 1 and M 2 are illustrated by the four equations: Equation: M 1 ' + M 1 [...] -> M 1 ', Rate Constant: k 11 Equation: M 2 ' + M 2 [...] -> M 2 ', Rate Constant: k 12 Equation: M 2 ' + M 2 [...] -> M 2 ', Rate Constant: k 22 Equation: M 2 ' + M 2 [...] -> M 1 ', Rate Constant: k 21 where M 1 ' and M 2 ' represent chain radicals having monomers M 1 and M 2 respectively, as their terminal, free-radical-bearing units. The fundamental parameters are defined as r 1 = (k 11 /k 12) and r 2 = (k 22 /k 21). The polymerizations were run in tubes which had a side arm viscometer so {{that it was possible to}} determine whether any conversion had taken place during the experiment. After polymerization had produced evidence of some conversion (as indicated by the attached viscometer), the reaction tubes were cooled in a Dry Ice acetone bath. The contents of the tube were then subjected to a purifying procedure which for this system required that the mixture of monomer and polymer be precipitated four times from a dioxane solution by a four fold excess of ligroin. This procedure was deduced from preliminary solubility studies of monomer and polymer. The purifying procedure was tested by preparing synthetic mixtures of both monomers and polymers in proportions which amounted to a ten percent conversion of monomer to polymer. From the results of the test of the purification procedure a correction factor was calculated by which the experimentally determined values of the polymer composition were corrected. The calibration factors were determined by analyzing known mixtures of the two homopolymers. Five copolymerization runs were made in bulk at 65 ° with 0. 5 [...] 0. 6 mole percent initiator (<b>dibenzoyl</b> <b>peroxide)</b> to low conversion. The values for the relative reactivity ratios are as follows: r 1 = 2. 12, r 2 = 0. 36. These were determined by plotting the data according to the equations of Fineman and Ross: F(f- 1) /f = r 2 *(F 2 /f) -r 2 (f- 1) /F= -r 2 *(f/F 2) + r 1 where F=F 1 /F 2 (F 1 and F 2 are the initial mole fractions of monomers in the charge) f=f 1 /f 2 (f 1 and f 2 are the mole fractions of the polymers). In order to visualize the accuracy of the results a theoretical curve of incremental polymer composition as a function of monomer composition was constructed using the above values of r 1 and r 2. The experimental points were then placed on the same curve. All the points fell close to the curve thus indicating acceptable results...|$|E
40|$|Reaction of (C 6 H 3 - 2 -AsPh 2 -n-Me) Li (n = 5 or 6) with [AuBr(AsPh 3) ] at - 78 degrees C {{gives the}} {{corresponding}} cyclometallated gold(I) complexes [Au 2 [(mu-C 6 H 3 -n-Me) AsPh 2] 2] [n = 5, (1); n = 6, (9) ]. 1 undergoes oxidative addition with halogens and with <b>dibenzoyl</b> <b>peroxide</b> to give digold(II) complexes [Au 2 X 2 [(mu-C 6 H 3 - 5 -Me) AsPh 2] 2] [X = Cl (2 a), Br (2 b), I (2 c) and O 2 CPh (3) ] containing a metal-metal {{bond between the}} 5 d 9 metal centres. Reaction of 2 a with AgO 2 CMe or of 3 with C 6 F 5 Li gives the corresponding digold(II) complexes in which X = O 2 CMe (4) and C 6 F 5 (6), respectively. The Au-Au distances increase in the order 4 < 2 a < 2 b < 2 c < 6, following the covalent binding tendency of the axial ligand. Like the analogous phosphine complexes, 2 a- 2 c and 6 in solution rearrange to form C-C coupled digold(I) complexes [Au 2 X 2 [mu- 2, 2 -Ph 2 As(5, 5 -Me 2 C 6 H 3 C 6 H 3) AsPh 2]] [X = Cl (5 a), X = Br (5 b), X = I (5 c) and C 6 F 5 (7) ] in which the gold atoms are linearly coordinated by As and X. In contrast, the products of oxidative additions to 9 depend markedly on the halogens. Reaction of 9 with chlorine gives the gold(I) -gold(III) complex, [ClAu[mu- 2 -Ph 2 As(C 6 H 3 - 6 -Me) ]AuCl[(6 -MeC 6 H 3) - 2 -AsPh 2]-kappa 2 As,C] (10), which contains a four-membered chelate ring, Ph 2 As(C 6 H 3 - 6 -Me), in the coordination sphere of the gold(III) atom. When 10 is heated, the ring is cleaved, the product being the digold(I) complex [ClAu{µ- 2 -Ph 2 As(C 6 H 3 - 6 -Me) }Au{AsPh 2 (2 -Cl- 3 -Me-C 6 H 3) }] (11). Reaction of 9 with bromine at 50 °C gives a monobromo digold(I) complex (12), {{which is similar to}} 11 except that the 2 -position of the substituted aromatic ring bears hydrogen instead halogen. Reaction of 9 with iodine gives a mixture of a free tertiary arsine, (2 -I- 3 -MeC 6 H 3) AsPh 2 (13), a digold diiodo compound (14) analogous to 11, and a gold(I) -gold(III) zwitterionic complex [I 2 AuIII{(µ-C 6 H 3 - 2 -AsPh 2 - 6 -Me) } 2 AuI] (15) in which the bridging units are arranged head-to-head between the metal atoms. The structures of 2 a- 2 c and 4 - 15 have been determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. The different behaviour of 1 and 9 toward halogens mirrors that of their phosphine analogues; the 6 -methyl substituent blocks C-C coupling of the aryl residues in the initially formed oxidative addition product. In the case of 9, the greater lability of the Au-As bond in the initial oxidative addition product may account for the more complex behaviour of this system compared with that of its phosphine analogue...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{a study of}} dimethylplatinum(II) and dimethylplatinum(IV) complexes containing bidentate nitrogen donor ligands. This work deals with oxidative addition, and reductive elimination chemistry, and it focuses on synthesis, characterization, and reaction mechanisms in studies of these complexes. The compound [PtMe 2 (bpe) ], bpe = 1, 2 -bis(2 -pyridyl) ethane, is easily oxidized to give octahedral organoplatinum(IV) complexes and the subsequent chemistry is profoundly influenced by the accompanying strain induced in the 7 -membered Pt(bpe) chelate ring. On reaction of [PtMe 2 (bpe) ] with HCl, the initial product [PtHClMe 2 (bpe) ] undergoes reductive elimination of methane to form [PtClMe(bpe) ]. In contrast, methyl iodide reacts with [PtMe 2 (bpe) ] to give [PtIMe 3 (bpe) ], and this decomposes by loss of the bpe ligand to give the cubane [(PtIMe 3) 4] and not by reductive elimination. Finally, {{a new class of}} platinum(IV) double cubane clusters was obtained on oxidation of complex [PtMe 2 (bpe) ] with either hydrogen peroxide to give [Pt 4 (m-OH) 4 (m 3 -OH) 2 Me 10], as a mixed complex with [PtMe 2 (CO 3) (bpe) ], or with oxygen in methanol to give [Pt 4 (m-OH) 2 (m-OMe) 2 (m 3 -OMe) 2 Me 10]. The oxidation of the complex [PtMe 2 (bps) ], bps = bis(2 -pyridyl) -dimethylsilane, by oxygen, hydrogen peroxide or <b>dibenzoyl</b> <b>peroxide</b> in the presence of water or alcohol gives the complex cation, [PtMe 3 (k 3 -N,N,O-HOSiMe(2 -C 5 H 4 N) 2) ]+, in a reaction involving easy cleavage of a methylsilicon bond. Treatment of the complex [PtMe 2 (bps) ] with B(C 6 F 5) 3 in trifluoroethanol in air gives the complex [Me(bps) Pt-OSiMe(2 -C 5 H 4 N) 2 PtMe 3]+ [B(OCH 2 CF 3) (C 6 F 5) 3]-. The unique binuclear platinum complex is formed via the competitive methyl platinum group cleavage from [PtMe 2 (bps) ] by the acid H[B(OCH 2 CF 3) (C 6 F 5) 3] to give the platinum(II) fragment and oxidation by air to give the platinum(IV) fragment. Combination of the two units then gives the binuclear complex which involves a very easy methylsilicon group cleavage reaction. The platinum(II) complexes containing five-membered heterocyclic imidazole ligands show high reactivity to a broad variety of alkyl halides, peroxides, and halogens forming stable platinum(IV) complexes. The dimethylplatinum(II) complex [PtMe 2 {(mim) 2 C=CH 2 }], (mim) 2 C=CH 2 = 1, 1 -bis(1 -methylimidazole- 2 -yl) ethene reacts with dichloromethane to give the dimethylplatinum(IV) complex [PtCl(CH 2 Cl) Me 2 {(mim) 2 C=CH 2 }]. The product exists as a mixture of two isomers, the cis isomer as the kinetic product and the trans isomer as the thermodynamic product. The dimethylplatinum(II) complex [PtMe 2 (DECBP) ], DECBP = 4, 4 ’-diethoxycarbonyl- 2 - 2 ’-bipyridine], undergoes easy oxidative addition to the corresponding platinum(IV) complexes. The reactions of the complex [PtMe 2 (DECBP) ] with alkyl bromides RCH 2 Br, which have hydrogen bond donor or acceptor functional groups, result in the formation of stable platinum(IV) complexes. Those complexes self-assemble in the solid state to form supramolecular polymers via the intermolecular OH•••O=C, N-H•••Br, OH•••BrPt, interactions, with other predicted interactions such as the π-stacking, and the C(H) •••BrPt secondary weak interactions...|$|E
40|$|Oxidation is an {{important}} route for the activation of chemical feedstock for the synthesis of chemical intermediates. Alkene epoxidation by the electrophilic addition of oxygen to a carbon-carbon double bond is a major challenge in oxidation catalysis. In particular {{it is important to}} use molecular oxygen as the oxidant to avoid the formation of reagent by products. Although molecular oxygen is the most environmentally benign oxidant in many cases, far more reactive forms of oxygen are required to achieve reaction, and this can lead to by-products with a heavy environmental burden with respect to their disposal. Free solvent selective epoxidation of cw-cyclooctene with air and small catalytic amount of radical initiator using supported nano-gold catalysts has been conducted in the liquid phase. Optimization of reaction conditions has been attempted to improve the selectivity by minimizing the background reactions of the support and radical initiator {{in the absence of the}} catalyst. Five different radical initiators were tested namely: di-/-butyl peroxide (DTBP), /-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP), cumene hydroperoxide (CHP), azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) and <b>dibenzoyl</b> <b>peroxide</b> (DBP). TBHP was selected for more detailed study as it combine the best activity and selectivity in the presence of the catalyst and minimum background reactions in the absence of the catalyst. The influence of the metal nano-particle support was also studied using six different supports. Use of graphite as a support was found to give the best combination of selectivity and conversion. In general the selectivity to the epoxide increased with reaction temperature from 60 - 80 C and was highest at 80 C. Other carbon supports, e. g. activated carbon and silicon carbide were found to be less effective. Au supported on TiO 2, SiO 2 and AI 2 O 3 catalysts were also selective for the epoxidation reaction and the general order of activity was: graphite > SiC > TiO 2 > SiO 2 AI 2 O 3 Ac. Extensive studies concerning the reusability of the gold/graphite catalyst was conducted as catalyst reusability is a key feature of green chemistry. The catalyst is found to be inhibited by the epoxide product but we demonstrate the effect of this is negligible for reused catalysts over a long reaction time. The observation of an induction period may in part be due to the adsorption of the radical initiator blocking surface sites as well as the establishment of the reactive species. The use of bimetallic catalyst, to be exact Au-Pd supported on graphite, shows significant effect on c/s-cyclooctene reactivity. The Au-Pd ratio has a major effect on the conversion with very low activities being associated with Au:Pd weight ratios of ca. 4 : 1 and 1 : 4 which may be associated with structured alloys that can be formed at these compositions. The molar Pd surface percentage were found to have dramatic effect on the conversion as low Pd surface would produce low activity and contrariwise. The selectivity to the epoxide is not affected by the Au:Pd ratio. Catalyst preparation method was also studied and sol immobilization method was found to be the most effective for gold catalyst, however, DP method was the preferred one in the bimetallic catalysts. The Au-Pd/graphite catalyst series has been further evaluated using crotyl alcohol (trans- but- 2 -en-l-ol) as starting material and using the same reaction conditions that had adopted for the epoxidation of c/s-cyclooctene. With crotyl alcohol, /-butyl hydroperoxide was not required for activity. In the absence of Pd, crotonaldehyde was formed, but the introduction of Pd leads to an isomerisation pathway to 3 -buten-l-ol being favored over epoxidation and crotonaldehyde was a minor product. Dimerisation of crotonaldehyde and carbon carbon bond cleavage was observed with Au catalyst. However, with Pd catalysts Wacker-like oxidation of the isomerisation pathway was the major by-product...|$|E
40|$|The dinuclear cyclometallated gold(I) complex [Au 2 (μ- 2 -C 6 F 4 PPh 2) 2] was {{prepared}} in high yield from {{the reaction of}} 2 -LiC 6 F 4 PPh 2 with either [AuBr(AsPh 3) ] or [AuCl(tht) ], and from the reaction of 2 -Me 3 SnC 6 F 4 PPh 2 with [AuCl(tht) ]. The digold(I) complex undergoes oxidative addition reactions with halogens to give the metal-metal bonded dihalodigold(II) complexes [Au 2 IIX 2 (μ- 2 -C 6 F 4 PPh 2) 2] (X = Cl, Br, I), which on warming or exposure to light, isomerise to give the heterovalent gold(I) -gold(III) species [XAu(µ- 2 -C 6 F 4 PPh 2) (κ 2 - 2 -C 6 F 4 PPh 2) AuX] containing a four-membered cyclometallated ring on a gold(III) centre. Unlike its protio analogue, [Au 2 (μ- 2 -C 6 F 4 PPh 2) 2] did not undergo oxidative addition of methyl iodide or <b>dibenzoyl</b> <b>peroxide.</b> The dihalodigold(II) [Au 2 IIX 2 (μ- 2 -C 6 F 4 PPh 2) 2] and gold(I) -gold(III) compounds [XAu(µ- 2 -C 6 F 4 PPh 2) (κ 2 - 2 -C 6 F 4 PPh 2) AuX] (X = Cl, Br) are further oxidised by halogens to give the digold(III) species [Au 2 X 4 (μ- 2 -C 6 F 4 PPh 2) 2] and [X 3 Au(μ- 2 -C 6 F 4 PPh 2) (κ 2 - 2 -C 6 F 4 PPh 2) AuX], respectively. The complexes [Au 2 X 4 (μ- 2 -C 6 F 4 PPh 2) 2] are reduced to the dihalodigold(II) complexes {{in the presence of}} one equivalent of zinc powder; further addition of zinc gave the parent digold(I) dimer. Treatment of [Au 2 IICl 2 (μ- 2 -C 6 F 4 PPh 2) 2] and [ClAu(µ- 2 -C 6 F 4 PPh 2) (κ 2 - 2 -C 6 F 4 PPh 2) AuCl] with an excess of silver nitrate, benzoate, acetate, trifluoroacetate or triflate gave the corresponding oxyanion complexes. Slow crystallisation of the di(benzoato) digold(II) complex from dichloromethane and methanol gave the parent digold(I) complex derived by reductive elimination. The di(triflato) digold(II) complex behaved similarly, although in this case the novel gold(I) tetramer [Au 4 (μ- 2 -C 6 F 4 PPh 2) 4] was formed together with the dimer. Two closely related gold complexes containing the chelating κ 2 (C,O) phosphine oxide ligand, 2 -C 6 F 4 P(O) PPh 2, were isolated from the reaction of [ClAu(µ- 2 -C 6 F 4 PPh 2) (κ 2 - 2 -C 6 F 4 PPh 2) AuCl] with an excess of silver nitrate. The reaction of [Au 2 IICl 2 (μ- 2 -C 6 F 4 PPh 2) 2] with two equivalents of potassium trifluoroethoxide failed to give the corresponding digold(II) bis(alkoxo) complex; instead, reduction took place to form the digold(I) dimer [Au 2 (μ- 2 -C 6 F 4 PPh 2) 2]. Treatment of a solution of the di(benzoato) digold(II) complex with C 6 F 5 Li gave the pentafluorophenyl complex [Au 2 (C 6 F 5) 2 (μ- 2 -C 6 F 4 PPh 2) 2] which, when heated in toluene, rearranged to the gold(I) -gold(III) complex [(C 6 F 5) Au(µ- 2 -C 6 F 4 PPh 2) (κ 2 - 2 -C 6 F 4 PPh 2) Au(C 6 F 5) ], analogous to the behaviour of the dihalodigold(II) complexes. The heterovalent, gold(I) -gold(III) dimethyl compound [Au 2 I,III(CH 3) 2 (μ- 2 -C 6 F 4 PPh 2) 2] was obtained from the reaction of the di(benzoato) digold(II) complex with dimethylzinc. This compound is structurally similar to its tetraprotio analogue. The cycloaurated dinuclear gold complexes [Au 2 (μ-C 6 H 3 -n-F- 2 -PPh 2) 2] (n = 5, 6) were made similarly to the 2 -C 6 F 4 PPh 2 analogue from the appropriate lithium or tin reagents, though in some cases the dimers were formed in admixture with the corresponding gold(I) tetramers. Like their tetrafluoro analogues, the 6 -fluoro complexes [Au 2 X 2 (μ-C 6 H 3 - 6 -F- 2 -PPh 2) 2] (X = Cl, Br, I) rearrange on heating to give the heterovalent gold(I) -gold(III) species [XAu(µ-C 6 H 3 - 6 -F- 2 -PPh 2) (κ 2 -C 6 H 3 - 6 -F- 2 -PPh 2) AuX]. Thus, the presence of a fluorine atom in place of hydrogen in the 6 -position of the bridging aryl group is sufficient to stop the isomerisation of the digold(II) complexes [Au 2 X 2 (μ- 2 -C 6 H 4 PPh 2) 2] at the gold(I) -gold(III) stage and to prevent subsequent C-C coupling of the aryl groups at the gold(III) centre. In contrast, the dihalodigold(II) complexes containing the 5 -fluoro substituted ligand undergo reductive elimination and coupling of the metallated aryl groups to give the digold(I) biphenyldiyl complexes [Au 2 X 2 (2, 2 &# 039;-Ph 2 P- 5 -FC 6 H 3 C 6 H 3 - 5 -F-PPh 2) ] (X = Cl, Br, I). The described complexes were characterised using 1 H NMR, 31 P NMR, 19 F NMR spectroscopy, elemental analysis, mass spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and 197 Au Mössbauer spectroscopy...|$|E
