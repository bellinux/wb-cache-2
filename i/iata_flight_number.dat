50|$|Airline mega mergers, {{in markets}} {{such as the}} United States, have deemed it {{necessary}} to break conventional <b>flight</b> <b>numbering</b> schemes. Organizations such as IATA, ICAO, ARC, as well as CRS systems and the FAA's ATC systems limit <b>flight</b> <b>numbers</b> to four digits (0001 through 9999). The pool of available <b>flight</b> <b>numbers</b> has been outstripped by demand for them by emergent mega-carriers. As such, some carriers have resorted to using the same <b>flight</b> <b>number</b> for back-and-forth <b>flights</b> (e.g. DCA-PBI-DCA), or in other cases carriers have resorted to assigning a single <b>flight</b> <b>number</b> to an eight-leg flight (e.g. ICT-DAL-HOU-MDW-OMA-DEN-ABQ-LAS-BDL).|$|R
40|$|The 6 th General Flight Crew Training Meeting held in Montreal in May, 1984 was {{for most}} IATA member {{airlines}} {{the first time}} they had been exposed to what was then a relatively new aspect of flight crew training-resource management training. In reviewing the results of this meeting the <b>IATA</b> <b>Flight</b> Crew Training SubCommittee (FCTSC), which had been responsible for the agenda and the meeting itself, concluded that because very few airlines had implemented a program or even appeared to understand the term resource management, a member airline survey should be conducted and the results analyzed. This presentation shows the results of that survey in a form which can be related to the topics of the workshop...|$|R
