Students in both groups were given the same texts, but only group B had the opportunity of asking anything related to the vocabulary of the text. Just after the reading, the researcher took all the text copies back and the students were asked to complete two different tests, one at a time. The first test consisted on asking them the translation of 20 English words linked to the topic (meaning recall). The second test presented the same 20 words, but this time students had to match them to their corresponding definitions (meaning recognition). A week later, the same two tests were passed again in both groups in order to check the vocabulary they had learnt. The results show that explicit learning may be more effective than incidental learning when acquiring vocabulary in EFL.

40|$|The deaf child {{usually does}} not begin to learn {{vocabulary}} until he has reached an age at which the hearing child has already mastered most of the vocabularies in adult expression.

40|$|The {{prevalence}} of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in the United States has increased exponentially {{within the past}} decade. The increasing prevalence has strained the current delivery system, resulting in a service-need gap. Identification of effective and efficient means of preparing ASD interventionists in evidence-based practices is necessary to address this gap. Telepractice, or instruction and support delivered using communication technologies (e. g., videoconferencing, online modules, and computerized software programs), has emerged as means of reducing this service-need gap by addressing barriers to obtaining quality training. To further the literature base, this dissertation contains two studies. The purpose of the first study was to synthesize the empirical literature {{on the use of}} telepractice to prepare ASD interventionists. The first study assessed the quality of the literature and identified future research priorities. A systematic search identified 12 studies for inclusion in the review.

40|$|The present {{dissertation}} on autism spectrum disorders (ASD) addressed several questions. First, the behavioral symptoms of speaking and mute individuals with ASD were compared on the Autism Behavior Checklist (ABC), a commonly used diagnostic instrument. In addition, {{questions about the}} construction of the ABC were investigated. In Study I it was found that although the two groups did not significantly differ on the total ABC score, the mute group demonstrated significantly more pathology on 21 of 57 items and 3 of 5 subscales. The speaking group obtained significantly higher scores on only 8 items and 1 subscale (Language). The appropriateness of providing greater pathology scores to speaking, rather than mute, individuals with ASD was called into question. In addition, it was speculated that the expressive language items are weighted too heavily, on both the Language subscale and the total score. Second, because the 57 items of the ABC were categorized into 5 subscales on a subjective basis, an empirical investigation of the factor structure of the ABC was performed. In Study II, a 5 -factor model that contained 39 of the items accounted for 80 % of the total variance in the checklist. No support was found for classifying the 57 items into the existing 5 subscales. Finally, the two most common forms of instruction to teach children with ASD, discrete-trial teaching and <b>incidental</b> <b>teaching,</b> were assessed. In Study III it was ascertained that discrete-trial teaching was more efficient and produced faster acquisition and initially, greater generalization. However, by follow-up, the <b>incidental</b> <b>teaching</b> methods resulted in equal retention, greater generalization, and equal or greater spontaneous usage. The findings indicate that although it takes a longer time for children with autism to learn with <b>incidental</b> <b>teaching</b> procedures, once they have acquired an ability, it may be more permanent...|$|E

40|$|After {{observing the}} lack of {{generalization}} of language trained in highly structured training sessions using established behavior modification techniques, "incidental teaching" procedures were developed to change the use of specified language behaviors in the natural environment. This paper reports {{an analysis of the}} general changes in the language, other than that specifically targeted by the <b>incidental</b> <b>teaching</b> procedures, used by disadvantaged preschool children. The daily language samples of disadvantaged children involved in a previously reported experiment to increase compound sentence usage were reexamined and compared to comparable records of other disadvantaged children and of middle-class children of college parents in order to assess possible general effects of the intervention program. Whereas the language that both groups of comparison children used changed little across the preschool year, the amount of talking by the children in the experimental program increased markedly. Their use of more elaborate vocabulary and more elaborate sentences also increased in direct proportion to the increases in overall language use, such that both language use and language elaboration in the experimental group of children changed from a pattern simlar to the comparison group of disadvantaged children to a pattern similar to the comparison group of middleclass children. It is argued that some general features of the <b>incidental</b> <b>teaching</b> procedure [...] differentially attending to child overtures and responding relative to the child's selected topic (reinforcer) [...] contributed to the increase in overall language use beyond the specific language behavior targeted, and that this increase in the probability of children's talking itself resulted in the substantial increases in elaboration seen in the children's spontaneous language. Because, at least in children with fairly well-developed language repertoires, language use is contextually controlled, talking more involves talking in more varied and complex contexts, which inevitably produces the use of more elaborate language...|$|E

Whenever the children selected a preschool play material, they were prompted and required to ask for it, first by name (noun), then by name plus a word that described the material (adjective-noun combination), then by use of a color adjuctive-noun combination, and finally by requesting the material and describing how they were going to use it (compound sentence). As each requirement was made, the children's general use of that aspect of language markedly increased, but little change was noted in the amount or nature of the children's interactions with teachers or their use of a set of materials to which they had free access.

40|$|Abstract: This article {{examined}} {{the rate of}} self-initiated communication acquisition, in a second language, {{of a child with}} autism. The language treatment objective was to teach functional communication skills in English through the use of Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS). The findings of this study show that it is possible for a child with autism to acquire functional communication skills in his second language even though he did not possess such communication skills in his first language. Key words: autism, picture exchange communication (PECS), verbal initiations. Children with autism have severe language deficits and socialization problems (American Psychiatric Association, 1994). Although a wide array of intervention techniques such as <b>incidental</b> <b>teaching</b> (Hart & Risley, 1980), pivotal response training (Koegal, Koegal, & Schreibman, 1991), reinforcing communication attempts rather than correct speech responses (Koegal, O’Dell & Dunlap, 1988) have been employed to stimulate speech, researches have shown that approximately 50 % of children with autism continued to remain nonverbal (Charlop & Haymes, 1994; Peeters & Gillberg, 1999; Prizant, 1983). Hence, one option is to use Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) to teach communi-cation to these nonverbal children.

There are four play conditions (specific play opportunity SPO, specific play timed SPT, unstructured play opportunity UPO, and unstructured play timed UPT). SPO condition used play schemes to teach multiple targets within 15 opportunities presented per session. A play scheme, any toy with multiple elements (a carwash) or a theme (princesses), was utilized. The play schemes used were vehicles and books & puzzles. SPT condition had all the same aspects of SPO, except instead of providing 15 opportunities, the session was defined by 15 minute timed sessions.
