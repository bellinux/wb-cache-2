The landscape and a great number of notable buildings are correctly rendered in such great detail, that historical censorship, misinterpretations, and later restorations have not prevented modern research from repeatedly corroborating the painting's accuracy.|$|E
5|$|Considered one of {{the preeminent}} figures of the classic horror film, the vampire <b>has</b> <b>proven</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> rich subject for the film and gaming industries. Dracula is a major {{character}} in more films than any other but Sherlock Holmes, and many early films were either {{based on the novel}} Dracula or closely derived from it. These included the 1922 German silent film Nosferatu, directed by F. W. Murnau and featuring the first film portrayal of Dracula—although names and characters were intended to mimic Draculas, Murnau could not obtain permission to do so from Stoker's widow, and had to alter many aspects of the film. Universal's Dracula (1931), starring Béla Lugosi as the Count, was the first talking film to portray Dracula. The decade saw several more vampire films, most notably Dracula's Daughter in 1936.|$|E
5|$|The total {{incompetence}} of the D.C. {{government in}} Washington, DC, {{has become an}} embarrassment to our entire Nation. This experiment in home rule is a disaster. All of us who serve in this Chamber, well over 95% of us, have held other positions in government. We have been mayors. We have been township trustees, State legislators, and the rest. I am convinced, Mr. Speaker, that there are well over 2,000 township trustees in my congressional district who with one arm tied behind their backs, could blindfolded {{do a better job}} of directing this city than the city council of D.C. It is high time that this experiment in home rule that <b>has</b> <b>proven</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> disaster for our nation be terminated, that we return to some sort of logical government whereby the rest of us can function in this city.|$|E

For example, 11C-labelled metomidate (11C-metomidate), {{has been used}} to detect tumors of adrenocortical origin.

25|$|This Charter {{provision}} provides both substantive {{and procedural}} rights.

As such, it <b>has</b> <b>proven</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> controversial provision in the Charter.|$|E

Maslow theorized that people will not seek to satisfy a higher level need until their lower level needs are met. There has been little empirical support for the idea that employees {{in the workplace}} strive {{to meet their needs}} only in the hierarchical order prescribed by Maslow.|$|E

Lakehead University, established through the lobbying of local businessmen and professionals, <b>has</b> <b>proven</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> major asset.

Emperor Constantine ordered their burning while Arius was still living, and any that survived this purge were later destroyed by his Orthodox opponents. Those works which have survived are quoted {{in the works of}} churchmen who denounced him as a heretic. This leads some—but not all—scholars to question their reliability.|$|E
25|$|Value {{investing}} <b>has</b> <b>proven</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> successful investment strategy. There {{are several}} ways to evaluate its success. One way is to examine the performance of simple value strategies, such as buying low PE ratio stocks, low price-to-cash-flow ratio stocks, or low price-to-book ratio stocks. Numerous academics have published studies investigating the effects of buying value stocks. These studies have consistently found that value stocks outperform growth stocks and the market as a whole.|$|E

The rules of college football do not precisely cover The Play's bizarre final seconds. Finally, the intense passion from both Cal and Stanford fans often make objective analysis of The Play a great challenge.|$|E

MRI scans are capable of producing a variety of chemical and physical data, in addition to detailed spatial images.

In addition, college students who participate in community volunteer projects as a part of their college experience report finding a much greater relevance in their academic studies after completing community volunteer projects.|$|E
