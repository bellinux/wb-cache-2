The State, on rebuttal, offered the transcript of the daughter's testimony pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. Section 2945.49 (1975) which permits the use <b>of</b> preliminary <b>examination</b> testimony <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>witness</b> who “cannot for any reason be produced at trial.” The defense objected asserting that use of the transcript violated the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution (incorporated to the States under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution). The trial court admitted the transcript and the defendant was convicted. The Supreme Court of Ohio overturned the conviction. That {{court held that the}} daughter's absence at trial and the lack of cross-examination at the preliminary hearing violated the Confrontation Clause.|$|R
40|$|The crux <b>of</b> <b>an</b> {{adversarial}} system as practiced in Malaysian courts is the adducing of evidence through the oral tradition. This usually involves examinations in three stages. A direct examination is {{conducted by the}} party that initiates the action, while a cross examination is {{carried out by the}} opposing side. In the event where a re-examination is necessary, the initiating party can re-examine his witness to ‘repair’ the damage done during the cross-examination. Institutionalized courtroom questioning involves questions posed by the lawyers with the answers to be provided for by the witnesses. Through strategic questioning therefore, <b>a</b> <b>witness</b> summoned to court by a litigating party will establish and then strengthen the version of the party that summon him.

50|$|However, {{he defended}} {{several of the}} United Irishmen in {{prominent}} high treason cases in the 1790s. Among them were the Revd. William Jackson, Archibald Hamilton Rowan, Wolfe Tone, Napper Tandy, The Sheares Brothers, Lord Edward Fitzgerald, William Orr and William Drennan. His difficulty in defending treason cases was that the Dublin administration could rely upon one <b>witness</b> to secure <b>a</b> conviction, while in England the law required that the prosecution had to use two or more witnesses. Consequently his success depended on his lengthy <b>examination</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> single <b>witness</b> {{to try to find}} an inconsistency. He used this technique to great effect in the case <b>of</b> Patrick Finney, <b>a</b> Dublin tobacconist charged with treason in 1798, largely on the evidence of one James O'Brien. Curran destroyed O'Brien's credit and the judges, for once in sympathy with the accused, virtually ordered an acquittal. In the same year he unsuccessfully defended the journalist Peter Finnerty for seditious libel in publishing an attack on the judges who heard the William Orr case, and the Lord Lieutenant. Despite an eloquent speech by Curran, Finnerty was found guilty and sentenced to two years imprisonment.|$|R
40|$|This diploma thesis {{deals with}} {{position}} of a witness in criminal proceeding. The first part, it defines a conception of a witness; focuses on legal process aspects of {{position of a}} witness and also on capability {{to act as a}} witness in criminal proceeding.

The third part defines rights and duties of a witness in criminal proceedings as they result not only from Criminal Procedure Act but also from constitutional principles. There is closer focus on witness' duty to testify, to liability to participate in confrontation and recognition (as special kinds of evidence). Another focus is on some witnesses' rights: rights to deny giving testimony and right to legal help and mainly to right to afford security of a witness.

40|$|The {{examination}} of witness {{in a criminal}} process According to {{the title of this}} final paper, it concerns the most important procedural technique under the criminal process - the <b>examination</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>witness.</b> It is the most widespread criminalistic and criminal technique which is irreplaceable in the criminal process. The basic task is finding {{the facts of the case}} beyond a reasonable doubt. A witness, as a person who testifies to circumstances of an examined case which he remembered and kept in his memory, is one of the basic institutes of criminal law next to the examination. His testimony is very important in checking, investigation and clarifying crimes and other criminalistic relevant events, more precisely in the whole process of clarifying criminal activities. The master's degree thesis is divided into six chapters. The principal part of the thesis is formed by the second chapter to the fourth one. In the introduction the history of the examination, the goal and the structure of the paper are mentioned shortly. The first chapter contains the definition of examination and kinds of examination and creates the beginning of the whole thesis. The important part of the paper is devoted to a witness. A witness is a person who perceives with his senses facts which are important for finding the facts [...] ...|$|E

40|$|The status <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>witness</b> in Czech and French {{criminal}} procedure - comparison The subject of my thesis is <b>a</b> comparison <b>of</b> the status <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>witness</b> in <b>a</b> Czech and French {{criminal procedure}}. I have chosen this theme because I'm interested in criminal law and I also pursue studying French law. During this activity I found <b>an</b> institute <b>of</b> assisted <b>witness</b> which is completely unique and unknown in a Czech legal environment. This thesis {{is divided into}} three parts, at first I focus on the status <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>witness</b> in Czech legislation, the second part contains a French regulation and the third is <b>a</b> comparison <b>of</b> those two. The first thing in a first part is a determination who the witness is and who can be <b>a</b> <b>witness</b> in <b>a</b> criminal procedure. Then I concern with rights and duties which the witness owns and must fulfil during the proceedings. Next chapter deals with <b>a</b> course <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>examination</b> <b>of</b> the <b>witness</b> and with questions connected with an examination, e. g. tactics <b>of</b> <b>examination.</b> In the next chapter there is possible to find out specifics <b>of</b> <b>a</b> situation when the <b>witness</b> is <b>a</b> minor. Next important aspect is also <b>a</b> protection <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>witness</b> who is jeopardized because <b>of</b> <b>a</b> provision <b>of</b> <b>a</b> testimony.

40|$|Abstract. Abstract interpretation-based proof {{carrying}} code uses postfixpoints {{of abstract}} interpretations to <b>witness</b> that <b>a</b> program respects a safety policy. Some witnesses carry {{more information than}} needed and are therefore unnecessarily large. We introduce <b>a</b> notion <b>of</b> size <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>witness</b> and propose techniques for reducing the size of such certificates. For distributive analyses, we show that <b>a</b> smallest <b>witness</b> exist and we give an iterative algorithm for computing it.

Finally, only the existence <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>witness</b> is needed to assure the code consumer of the safety <b>of</b> <b>a</b> given program.
