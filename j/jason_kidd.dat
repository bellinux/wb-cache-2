5|$|Despite {{winning a}} {{championship}} with the Spurs, doubts lingered over Parker's future. The Spurs had attempted {{and failed to}} acquire New Jersey Nets' <b>Jason</b> <b>Kidd,</b> but Parker told coach Popovich {{that he wanted to}} be San Antonio's starting point guard. Parker played well during the regular season, recording 14.7 ppg, 5.5 apg and 3.2 rpg. However, the Spurs were defeated by the Los Angeles Lakers in the Western Conference semi-finals in the 2004 NBA Playoffs, and were denied back-to-back titles.|$|E
5|$|Nash, {{along with}} former Yahoo! {{president}} and fellow Victoria-native Jeff Mallett, are investors in Women's Professional Soccer, a soccer league that {{was launched in}} March 2009. Nash cited his twin daughters and wanting to have role models for them {{to look up to}} as a reason for supporting the league. Nash also co-hosted Showdown in Chinatown in 2008, an 8-on-8 charity soccer game held at Sara D. Roosevelt Park. He scored two goals in his team's 8–5 victory. Participants included Thierry Henry, <b>Jason</b> <b>Kidd,</b> Baron Davis, and Suns teammates Raja Bell and Leandro Barbosa.|$|E

50|$|He {{also worked}} as an {{assistant}} coach of the New Jersey Nets of the NBA. On August 3, 2010, he became a scout for the Nets. Shortly after, he left for the Boston Celtics. In 2013, he joined <b>Jason</b> <b>Kidd's</b> coaching staff on the Brooklyn Nets. The next season, he joined the Washington Wizards coaching staff.|$|R
5|$|On July 9, 2008, Barea re-signed {{with the}} Dallas Mavericks to a three-year deal. In 2008–09, Barea's {{role on the}} team {{increased}} dramatically. Injuries to Jerry Stackhouse, Josh Howard and Jason Terry saw Barea's minutes per game double as coach Rick Carlisle began regularly using a three-guard lineup which included <b>Jason</b> <b>Kidd,</b> Jason Terry and Barea to spark an offensive streak in games. On February 20, 2009, Barea scored a then career high 26 points in an 86–93 loss to the Houston Rockets.|$|E
5|$|After {{failing to}} sign coveted free agents Deron Williams and Steve Nash, the Mavericks {{retooled}} their roster by {{letting go of}} <b>Jason</b> <b>Kidd,</b> Jason Terry and Brendan Haywood, and acquiring younger players such as O. J. Mayo, Darren Collison, as well as veteran big men Chris Kaman and Elton Brand. Nowitzki plans to play out {{the remainder of his}} 4-year, 80 million dollar contract that expires in 2014. Nowitzki underwent knee surgery in October 2012 and missed the first 27 games of the season. He returned on December 23, 2012, in a game against San Antonio.|$|E
5|$|The {{most recent}} Rookie of the Year winner is Malcolm Brogdon. Twenty-one winners were drafted first overall. Fourteen winners have {{also won the}} NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP) award in their careers; Wilt Chamberlain and Wes Unseld earning both honors the same season. Nineteen of the forty two non-active winners have been elected to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. Three seasons had joint winners—Dave Cowens and Geoff Petrie in the , Grant Hill and <b>Jason</b> <b>Kidd</b> in the , and Elton Brand and Steve Francis in the 1999–2000 season. Five players won the award {{unanimously}} (by capturing all of the first-place votes) – Ralph Sampson, David Robinson, Blake Griffin, Damian Lillard, and Karl-Anthony Towns.|$|E
50|$|On July 31, 2014, Bayless {{signed with}} the Milwaukee Bucks. He had a solid {{first half of the}} 2014-15 season before his form dropped post All-Star break. During the season, Bayless was often relied upon to carry a {{significant}} load as he knew the system and had coach <b>Jason</b> <b>Kidd's</b> trust. This was especially true in the first week that followed the All-Star break, as newly acquired Michael Carter-Williams was still nursing a toe-injury.|$|R
50|$|On June 28, 2013, Frank {{gave in to}} player-turned-rookie-coach <b>Jason</b> <b>Kidd's</b> rather public {{recruiting}} {{efforts to}} make Frank (who had coached Kidd when he played for the Nets) his lead assistant coach on the (now-Brooklyn) Nets. Frank's contract made him the highest-paid assistant coach in the NBA at the time (approximately $6 million over 6 years). Preferring to delegate his authority, Kidd stated that Frank's role would be to run the team's defense, while being Kidd's (on-the-job-training-style) head-coaching mentor. Kidd placed another assistant coach, John Welch, {{in charge of the}} team's offense.|$|R

5|$|After graduating with {{a degree}} in sociology, Nash was {{selected}} 15th overall by the Phoenix Suns {{in the first round of}} the 1996 NBA draft. Upon hearing the draft announcement, Suns fans booed in disapproval of the relatively unknown player. This was because despite his impressive college accomplishments, Nash had not played in one of the major college conferences. A major influence in Phoenix's choice was assistant coach Donnie Nelson, who met Nash back in high school as he was coached by Nelson's friend Ken Shields, and would eventually befriend the player as he played in Santa Clara. During his first two seasons in the NBA, Nash played a supporting role behind NBA star point guards Kevin Johnson, Sam Cassell, and later, <b>Jason</b> <b>Kidd.</b> Both Johnson and Cassell had NBA Finals experience, while Kidd was the second overall pick in the 1994 NBA draft and already an All-Star when he arrived at Phoenix.|$|E
5|$|The 2007–08 {{campaign}} {{saw another}} first-round playoffs exit for Nowitzki and his Mavericks. Despite a mid-season trade that sent veteran NBA All-Star <b>Jason</b> <b>Kidd</b> to Dallas, the Mavericks finished seventh {{in a highly}} competitive Western Conference. Nowitzki averaged 23.6 points, 8.6 rebounds, and a career-high 3.5 assists for the season. In the playoffs, they faced rising star Chris Paul's New Orleans Hornets, and were eliminated in five games. The playoff loss led to the firing of Avery Johnson as head coach and the eventual hiring of Rick Carlisle. The few positive highlights that season for Nowitzki were his first career triple-double against the Milwaukee Bucks on February 6, 2008, with 29 points, 10 rebounds, and a career-high 12 assists, and on March 8, 2008 (34 points against the New Jersey Nets), when he surpassed Rolando Blackman with his 16,644th point to become the Mavericks' all-time career points leader.|$|E
5|$|In the 1995–96 season, Nash began {{attracting}} {{the attention of}} the national media and professional scouts. He had spent the summer before that honing his skills, playing with the Canadian national team and working out with the likes of established NBA players <b>Jason</b> <b>Kidd</b> and Gary Payton. Santa Clara again captured the WCC title, and for the second consecutive year, Nash was named Conference Player of the Year, the first Bronco to do so since Kurt Rambis. He scored 28 points in leading the No. 10 seed Broncos to a first round upset win over No. 7 seed Maryland, but then the Broncos were eliminated by Kansas. Nash's performances ensured that he earned an honourable mention All-America as a senior by The Associated Press and the USBWA. He also finished his career as Santa Clara's all-time leader in career assists (510), free-throw percentage (.862), and made and attempted three-pointers (263–656). He remains third on the school's all-time scoring list (1,689), and holds Santa Clara's single-season free-throw percentage record (.894). In September 2006, Nash had his jersey (#11) retired, becoming the first Santa Clara student-athlete to receive that honour.|$|E

40|$|Zipser (1991) {{showed that}} the hidden unit {{activity}} of a fully-recurrent neural network model, trained on a simple memory task, matched the temporal activity patterns of memory-associated neurons in monkeys performing delayed saccade or delayed match-to-sample tasks. When noise, simulating random fluctuations in neural firing rate, {{is added to the}} unit activations of this model, the effect on the memory dynamics is to slow the rate of information loss. In this paper, we show that the dynamics of the iterated sigmoid function, with gain and bias parameters, is qualitatively very similar to the "output" behavior of Zipser's multi-unit model. Analysis of the simpler system provides an explanation for the effect of noise that is missing from the description of the multi-unit model.

On February 27, he recorded his eighth career triple-double and first as a Bull with 22 points, 16 rebounds and a career-high 14 assists in a 103–95 loss to the Portland Trail Blazers. At 35 years old, he became the oldest player to record a triple-double since Kobe Bryant did so at 36 years old in 2014. On March 7, he recorded his second triple-double {{of the season with}} 12 points, 17 rebounds and 13 assists in a 100–90 win over the Milwaukee Bucks, becoming just the fourth player 35 years or older with multiple triple-doubles in a season, joining <b>Jason</b> <b>Kidd,</b> Kobe Bryant and Paul Pierce.

5|$|The Lakers won 58 {{games in}} 2001–02. In the playoffs, they swept Portland and {{defeated}} San Antonio four games to one {{to advance to}} the Western Conference Finals to face Sacramento. The series would go on to be {{known as one of the}} greatest playoff matchups in NBA history. The series extended to all seven games, and ended in a Lakers victory. In game one, Bryant scored 30 points as the Lakers won, 106–99. The series would then shift in Sacramento's favor, with the Kings winning the next two games. Facing a deficit in game 4, the Lakers had the ball with under 20 seconds to play. After misses by both Bryant and O'Neal, Kings center Vlade Divac tapped the ball away from the rim in an attempt to wind down the clock. It went straight into Robert Horry's hands, who drained a game-winning three with under three seconds to play. After the Kings won game five on a buzzer beater by Mike Bibby, the Lakers were faced with a must-win game six. In one of the most controversial playoff games in league history (Tim Donaghy scandal), the Lakers would win by four points. The Lakers went on to win game seven in overtime, with the Kings missing numerous potentially game-saving shots and free throws. The Lakers then achieved a three-peat by sweeping <b>Jason</b> <b>Kidd</b> and the New Jersey Nets in the NBA Finals. O'Neal won each of the Finals series' MVP awards, making him the only player besides Michael Jordan to win three consecutive Finals MVPs.|$|E
