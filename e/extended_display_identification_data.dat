HDMI 1.0 to HDMI 1.2a uses the EIA/CEA-861-B video standard, HDMI 1.3 uses the CEA-861-D video standard, and HDMI 1.4 uses the CEA-861-E video standard.

[...] On July 15, 2013, the CEA announced the publication of CEA-861-F which is a standard {{that can be used}} by interfaces such as DVI, HDMI, and LVDS. CEA-861-F adds the ability to transmit several Ultra HD video formats and additional color spaces.|$|E

50|$|Mini-DVI {{connectors}} on Apple hardware {{are capable}} of carrying DVI, VGA, or TV signals {{through the use of}} adapters, detected with EDID (<b>Extended</b> <b>display</b> <b>identification</b> <b>data)</b> via DDC. This connector is often used in place of a DVI connector in order to save physical space on devices. Mini-DVI does not support dual-link connections and hence cannot support resolutions higher than 1920×1200 @60 Hz.|$|E

50|$|<b>Extended</b> <b>display</b> <b>identification</b> <b>data</b> (EDID) is a {{companion}} standard; it defines a compact binary file format describing the monitor's capabilities and supported graphics modes, {{stored in a}} read-only memory (EEPROM) chip programmed by the manufacturer of the monitor. The format uses a description block containing 128 bytes of data, with optional extension blocks to provide additional information. The most current version is Enhanced EDID (E-EDID) Release A, v2.0.|$|E
50|$|<b>Extended</b> <b>Display</b> <b>Identification</b> <b>Data</b> (EDID) is a data {{structure}} {{provided by a}} digital display to describe its capabilities to a video source (e.g. graphics card or set-top box). It is what enables a modern personal computer to know what kinds of monitors are connected to it. EDID is defined by a standard published by the Video Electronics Standards Association (VESA). The EDID includes manufacturer name and serial number, product type, phosphor or filter type, timings supported by the display, display size, luminance data and (for digital displays only) pixel mapping data.|$|E
50|$|While {{most modern}} {{graphics}} cards have support for dual monitors and can expand a desktop across three screens, 3D games are generally {{limited to a}} single monitor. The GXM uses the standard <b>Extended</b> <b>Display</b> <b>Identification</b> <b>Data</b> (EDID) structure to communicate its capabilities to the graphics card just as a monitor does. However, the GXM's resolution includes all pixels in the three monitors. If the TripleHead2Go were hooked up to three monitors with 800×600 resolution, the TripleHead2Go would report itself as a single monitor with 2400×600 resolution. The graphics card then sends out a 2400×600 signal which the TripleHead2Go divides and distributes to the appropriate monitors.|$|E

50|$|DVI's {{digital video}} {{transmission}} format {{is based on}} panelLink, a serial format developed by Silicon Image that utilizes a high-speed serial link called transition minimized differential signaling (TMDS). Like modern analog VGA connectors, the DVI connector includes pins for the display data channel (DDC). A newer version of DDC called DDC2 allows the graphics adapter to read the monitor's <b>extended</b> <b>display</b> <b>identification</b> <b>data</b> (EDID). If a display supports both analog and digital signals in one DVI-I input, each input method can host a distinct EDID. Since the DDC can only support one EDID, {{there can be a}} problem if both the digital and analog inputs in the DVI-I port detect activity. It is up to the display to choose which EDID to send.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{a series of}} experiments designed to test auditory display techniques for interactive image sonification on a tablet computer. The aim of these experiments was to evaluate new sonic methods developed for finding graphical features on a tablet computer screen for both regular size, and extended (larger than physical screen size) displays. A series of tests were designed to evaluate the techniques, and determine the effectiveness of binaural information {{in a series of}} goal-oriented searching tasks. The results show that, by using the techniques developed, users can locate graphical features on regular and <b>extended</b> <b>displays,</b> using sound alone. Additionally, it was found that users could improve their search times when using auditory information to improve their ability to search <b>extended</b> <b>displays...</b>|$|R

30|$|To this end, {{the edge}} router creates 42 bytes {{signature}} value (size of ECDSA digital signature with 160 bits elliptical curve key) by applying ECDSA signing algorithm to 60 bits <b>identification</b> <b>data</b> plus 13 bytes flow ID. This 42 bytes signature should also {{transfer to the}} destination along with 60 bits of <b>identification</b> <b>data.</b> Obviously, {{it is not a}} good idea to embed 42 bytes of data to the IP header because embedding 42 bytes data and 60 bits <b>identification</b> <b>data</b> to 32 bits marking field requires at least 13 packets, while looking at Table  6 shows that K[*]=[*] 13 has a bad TR (64 % to 88 %). So we decided to add 42 bytes ECDSA digital signature to the end of the K th packet payload of each flow. It is assumed that when this system is used it would be known that DFM is using ECDSA signing algorithm.|$|R

50|$|Conventional {{explicit}} certificates {{are made}} up of three parts: <b>identification</b> <b>data,</b> a public key and a digital signature which binds the public key to the user’s <b>identification</b> <b>data</b> (ID). The digital certificate is created by a trusted third party and its signature can be independently verified by anyone in the network. The public key, ID and digital signature are distinct data elements which make up the physical size of the certificate. Conventional certificates can get very large.
