50|$|For {{more than}} a century, glass has been {{produced}} in the Kingdom of Crystal. Up until the 1950s, the budding <b>glass</b> <b>workers</b> were trained by the masters {{in the midst of}} regular production. They were allowed to practise, fail and practise again, finally to succeed.|$|R
5000|$|In early 1915, a {{group of}} {{immigrant}} Bohemian <b>glass</b> <b>workers</b> approached Charles L. in hopes of employment; he hired them and formed the Elrose Decorating Company to craft and market Bohemian-style glassware made in the United States. This subsidiary company was named for his sister Elrose.|$|R
5000|$|One of {{the main}} {{features}} of the 1893 version of the church building was (and still is) a huge stained glass window on the High Street (west) side of the sanctuary. Over fifty years after the window’s installation, it was still {{believed to be the}} largest window enclosed in one frame in the state of Indiana. [...] The stained glass window was paid for by Mrs. George Gable as a memorial to her mother (Lydia Taughinbaugh), {{who was one of the}} charter members of the church. [...] The glass was handmade in Belgium, and installed by local <b>glass</b> <b>workers</b> originally from that country. Ironically, most of Hartford City's Belgian-immigrant <b>glass</b> <b>workers</b> were Catholics living on the other (south) side of the city. [...] Although Hartford City had numerous local glass factories by the next decade, Hartford City Glass Company was the only glass factory in town in 1892. [...] Therefore, it can safely be assumed that the Belgian <b>glass</b> <b>workers</b> were employees of that glass factory. “Old-timers” may remember Belgian <b>glass</b> <b>workers</b> as employees of American Window Glass Company, which purchased Hartford City Glass just before 1900. Belgium is the site of multiple examples of Western European cathedral architecture. Examples include the St. Michael and St. Gudula Cathedral, Cathedral of Our Lady, the Our Lady of Flanders’ Cathedral of Tournai, and others. During the 19th century, Belgium also contributed significantly to the revival of architecture from the Middle Ages. The works of countymen Jean-Baptiste Capronnier in stained glass, and Baron Bethune in architecture, are especially noteworthy. [...] An American example of Capronnier’s work with stained glass can be found in the “parable window” in the First Presbyterian Church of Philadelphia.|$|R
5000|$|At Fenton, Dave Fetty, {{a factory}} <b>glass</b> <b>worker</b> {{for most of}} his career, was allowed to use {{specialist}} skills, learned before joining the factory, in limited editions of [...] "offhand" [...] pieces without the use of moulds. Such pieces are more akin to Studio glass than [...] "Factory Glass".|$|R
5000|$|The name [...] "Armanaz" [...] is of pre-Semitic origin. It may be {{the sight}} of the ancient Assyrian city of Tarmanazi. According to {{historian}} Carl Joham Lamm, ancient sources indicate that Armanaz was founded by <b>glass</b> <b>workers</b> from a town near Tyre (modern-day Lebanon) with the same name.|$|R
2500|$|In medieval cities, {{craftsmen}} {{tended to}} form associations {{based on their}} trades, confraternities of textile workers, masons, carpenters, carvers, <b>glass</b> <b>workers,</b> each of whom controlled secrets of traditionally imparted technology, the [...] "arts" [...] or [...] "mysteries" [...] of their crafts. Usually the founders were free independent master craftsmen who hired apprentices.|$|R
5000|$|Solidarity {{was opposed}} to {{partnership}} as a policy, preferring to see a [...] "return to the fighting spirit" [...] of the country's first union movement, the Red Feds. It built a modest base in the South Auckland industrial regions of East Tamaki and Onehunga, organising small engineering firms, <b>glass</b> <b>workers,</b> courier drivers and service workers.|$|R
500|$|Although {{the third}} tank was not added in 1893, a new ware room was built. The room was [...] long by [...] wide, and could hold 20,000 boxes. The roof and walls {{were covered in}} iron.

5|$|In 1899, Hartford City Glass was {{acquired}} by the American Window Glass Company, which controlled 85 percent of the American window glass manufacturing capacity. During the next decade, the company began replacing its skilled and well–paid Belgian glass blowers with machines and less-skilled machine operators. The company used the Hartford City plant to test and refine the new technology. Most of the Belgian <b>glass</b> <b>workers</b> left town.|$|R
2500|$|In 1483, {{he settled}} in Würzburg. On 7 December 1483, {{he joined the}} Saint Luke's Guild of painters, sculptors, and <b>glass</b> <b>workers</b> as a painter's assistant. On 28 February 1485, he married Anna Schmidt (born Uchenhofer), a widow of a master {{goldsmith}} with three sons. This marriage not only brought him property, but it also meant that he could end his apprenticeship and become a master craftsman.|$|R
50|$|Gaudin {{was born}} in Boulogne-Billancourt in 1950, her father was the stained glass {{designer}} Pierre Gaudin. She was the fourth generation of stained <b>glass</b> <b>workers</b> and she took over the business when her father died. Pierre Gaudin died in 1973, his father was Jean Gaudin (1879-1954) and his father and Sylvie's great grandfather was Félix Gaudin (1851-1930) who was a glass painter and mosaic artist.|$|R

5000|$|Although {{the third}} tank was not added in 1893, a new ware room was built. The room was 60 ft long by 120 ft wide, and could hold 20,000 boxes. The roof and walls {{were covered in}} iron.

5000|$|Construction of {{the house}} of worship began in 1892 and was {{completed}} in 1893. The church building {{is considered one of the}} city’s best examples of the Richardsonian Romanesque style of architecture. [...] One aspect of the building that makes it particularly notable is its windows. The church features massive stained glass windows that were hand-crafted in Belgium and assembled by local <b>glass</b> <b>workers</b> originally from that country.|$|R
50|$|The {{repeal of}} Prohibition in 1933 and {{the advent of}} World War II greatly {{improved}} the economics of the glass industry, and led to widespread re-employment of <b>glass</b> <b>workers.</b> The GBBA responded with a strong organizing effort. The 1933 National Industrial Recovery Act protected union organizing activity for the first time. A 1931 conference had given the GBBA the exclusive right to organize the 12,000 workers in the 21 plants of the Owens-Illinois company (which manufactured 60 percent of all glass containers in the U.S.), and the union slowly began organizing Owens-Illinois. The invention of the neon sign and its immense popularity not only generated an intense demand for skilled <b>glass</b> <b>workers,</b> but also boosted wages. Employers often offered double what the collective bargaining agreement required. By 1936, the glass blowers' union has organized 90 percent of all workers in the neon sign industry. But in 1937, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers challenged the GBBA's right to the neon sign workers. It won, and by 1938 nearly all of the neon sign locals had left the GBBA.|$|R
2500|$|Becker also greatly {{added to}} the union's membership. [...] In July 1995, the union absorbed the 74,000-member United Rubber Workers. [...] In January 1997, the 140,000-member Aluminum, Brick and <b>Glass</b> <b>Workers</b> Union also merged with the USW, and in 1999 the Canadian {{division}} of the Transportation Communications International Union agreed to leave their parent union and join the USW. However, a planned merger with the United Auto Workers and International Association of Machinists collapsed.|$|R
50|$|Harry Woods (born in St Helens on 14 March 1894; date {{of death}} unknown) was an English footballer who played as an inside-forward. He initlally trained as a <b>glass</b> <b>worker</b> whilst playing as an amateur for St Helens Recreation, and then Ashton Town and St Helens Town. In 1911, he joined Norwich City, then in the Southern League, where he played until the {{outbreak}} of World War I, making 151 appearances and scoring 37 goals.|$|R
50|$|Georges Bontemps was a {{director}} of a French glass manufacturer based at Choisy-le-Roi until 1848. In 1830, he acted as an agent to the Englishman Robert Lucas Chance, assisting in the recruitment of French and Belgian <b>glass</b> <b>workers</b> {{to work for him}} - an illegal act that could have resulted in both men being imprisoned. Chance was looking for ways to improve the production of flat glass at his newly formed factory in Smethwick, Birmingham.|$|R
5000|$|In 1870 it {{was brought}} by Chance Brothers but {{problems}} with coal supply lead to the final closure. In 1871 the works employed 319 people. The works closed down in 1873, but [...] "Nailsea" [...] glass, {{an example of the}} [...] "latticino" [...] decorative style, (mostly made by <b>glass</b> <b>workers</b> {{at the end of their}} shift in Nailsea and at other glass works) is still sought after by collectors around the world.|$|R
