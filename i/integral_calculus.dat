The term appeared in English in George Peacock's 1816 translation of Lacroix's Differential and <b>Integral</b> <b>Calculus.</b> Alexis Clairaut was the first to think of {{polar coordinates}} in three dimensions, and Leonhard Euler was the first to actually develop them.|$|E
5|$|Formal {{schooling}} did {{not start}} in Hungary {{until the age of}} ten. Instead, governesses taught von Neumann, his brothers and his cousins. Max believed that knowledge of languages other than Hungarian was essential, so the children were tutored in English, French, German and Italian. By the age of 8, von Neumann was familiar with differential and <b>integral</b> <b>calculus,</b> but he was particularly interested in history, reading his way through Wilhelm Oncken's 46-volume Allgemeine Geschichte in Einzeldarstellungen. A copy was contained in a private library Max purchased. One of the rooms in the apartment was converted into a library and reading room, with bookshelves from ceiling to floor.|$|E
5|$|Archimedes {{was able}} to use infinitesimals {{in a way that is}} similar to modern <b>integral</b> <b>calculus.</b> Through proof by contradiction (reductio ad absurdum), he could give answers to {{problems}} to an arbitrary degree of accuracy, while specifying the limits within which the answer lay. This technique is known as the method of exhaustion, and he employed it to approximate the value of π. In Measurement of a Circle he did this by drawing a larger regular hexagon outside a circle and a smaller regular hexagon inside the circle, and progressively doubling the number of sides of each regular polygon, calculating the length of a side of each polygon at each step. As the number of sides increases, it becomes a more accurate approximation of a circle. After four such steps, when the polygons had 96 sides each, he {{was able to}} determine that the value of π lay between 3 (approximately 3.1429) and 3 (approximately 3.1408), consistent with its actual value of approximately 3.1416. He also proved that the area of a circle was equal to π multiplied by the square of the radius of the circle (πr2). In On the Sphere and Cylinder, Archimedes postulates that any magnitude when added to itself enough times will exceed any given magnitude. This is the Archimedean property of real numbers.|$|E

From the age of Greek mathematics, Eudoxus (BC) used the method of exhaustion, which foreshadows the concept of the limit, to calculate areas and volumes, while Archimedes (BC) developed this idea further, inventing heuristics which resemble the methods of <b>integral</b> <b>calculus.</b> The method of exhaustion was later discovered independently in China by Liu Hui in the 3rd century AD in order to find the area of a circle.
