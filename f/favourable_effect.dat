500|$|In {{the late}} 1980s and early 1990s, Jan Boklöv pioneered the V-style: skis were instead spread {{outwards}} in an aerodynamic [...] "V" [...] shape, with the athlete's body lying much flatter between them. This created yet more surface area and lift, instantly enabling distances {{of up to}} ten per cent further. It also had a <b>favourable</b> <b>effect</b> of granting more stability in the air, although the peak speed was some [...] slower than the parallel style. At first this new technique was looked upon unfavourably by the judges, who made it an issue to downgrade style points for those who used it. Nevertheless, within a few years, with Boklöv having won the 1988/89 Ski Jumping World Cup season and other athletes promptly adopting the technique, the judges' stance quietly eased and the V-style became the ubiquitous standard still used today.|$|E

30|$|In {{terms of}} implementation, {{results show that}} the {{allocation}} of resources to programme administration has <b>favourable</b> <b>effects</b> on labour market variables either directly or through its interaction with training policies. The effects of these interactions illustrate that as more ALMP resources are devoted to programme administration, the <b>favourable</b> <b>effects</b> of ALMPs on labour market variables become stronger. In addition, a disruption of policy continuity is associated with negative effects for all labour market variables analysed. The contrary occurs with the variable timing (i.e. measuring whether policies are implemented in a countercyclical or procyclical manner), which is non-significant in most cases. Interestingly, the size of the coefficients arising from policy and implementation variables once interactions are included is noticeably higher, which demonstrates that a correct implementation of policies enhances their beneficial effect.|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} 24 years, {{research}} groups in eight different countries have conducted 28 independent evaluation studies on Integrated Psychological Therapy (IPT) including 1, 329 schizophrenia patients. The present study examines {{the effectiveness of}} IPT under different treatment conditions {{by means of a}} meta-analytic review. The most salient results indicate <b>favourable</b> mean <b>effect</b> sizes for IPT in comparison to control groups (placebo-attention conditions, standard care). Moreover, the superiority of IPT continues to increase during an average catamnestic phase of 8. 1 months. The method obtains similarly <b>favourable</b> <b>effects</b> in different functional areas (neurocognition, social behaviour, psychopathology) and different assessment formats (expert ratings, self-reports, psychological tests). The comparison of different settings of IPT and control groups shows the superiority of IPT in any given therapy or site condition. The analysis of subsamples of inpatients, outpatients, and patients in varying rehabilitation phases reveals similarly <b>favourable</b> <b>effects.</b> Comparing only high-quality studies yields comparable results. In summary, the present meta-analysis corroborates evidence that IPT is an 'empirically validated treatment' according to American Psychiatric Association guidelines...|$|R

Hatton in his appearance realised little of the fancies in which Sybil had sometime indulged with regard to him. That appearance was prepossessing: a frank and even benevolent expression played upon his intelligent and handsome countenance: his once rich brown hair, still long though very thin, was so arranged as naturally to conceal his baldness; he was dressed with great simplicity, but with remarkable taste and care: nor did the repose and suavity of his manner and the hushed {{tone of his voice}} detract from the <b>favourable</b> <b>effect</b> that he always at once produced.|$|E

This early conception, which we have found in America, was easily combined with doctrines of the death and revival, not of the year, not of the seed sown, but of the human soul.

60|$|Mr. Sherwin and I had not latterly met on {{the most}} cordial terms. He was {{dissatisfied}} with me for not having boldly approached the subject of my marriage in my father's presence; and considered my reasons for still keeping it secret, as dictated by morbid apprehension, and as showing a total want of proper firmness. On the other hand, he was obliged to set against this omission on my part, the readiness I had shown in meeting his wishes on all remaining points. My life was insured in Margaret's favour; and I had arranged to be called to the bar immediately, so as to qualify myself in good time for every possible place within place-hunting range. My assiduity in making these preparations for securing Margaret's prospects and mine against any evil chances that might happen, failed in producing the <b>favourable</b> <b>effect</b> on Mr. Sherwin, which they must assuredly have produced on a less selfish man. But they obliged him, at least, to stop short at occasional grumblings about my reserve with my father, and to maintain towards me a sort of sulky politeness, which was, after all, less offensive than the usual infliction of his cordiality, with its unfailing accompaniment of dull stories and duller jokes.|$|E
60|$|The autumn {{that year}} {{was bright and}} warm, and at the {{beginning}} of October, Mr. Walsh, the new curate, came. The mild weather, the relaxation from excessive work, and perhaps another benignant influence, had for a few weeks a visibly <b>favourable</b> <b>effect</b> on Mr. Tryan. At least he began to feel new hopes, which sometimes took the guise of new strength. He thought of the cases in which consumption patients remain nearly stationary for years, without suffering so as to make their life burdensome to themselves or to others; and he began to struggle with a longing that it might be so with him. He struggled with it, because he felt it to be an indication that earthly affection was beginning to have too strong a hold on him, and he prayed earnestly for more perfect submission, and for a more absorbing delight in the Divine Presence as the chief good. He was conscious that he did not wish for prolonged life solely that he might reclaim the wanderers and sustain the feeble: he was conscious of a new yearning for those pure human joys which he had voluntarily and determinedly banished from his life--for a draught of that deep affection from which he had been cut off by a dark chasm of remorse. For now, that affection was within his reach; he saw it there, like a palm-shadowed well in the desert; he could not desire to die in sight of it.|$|E
60|$|Anger {{departed}} by night, {{attended by}} two servants. Being {{arrived at the}} port, and enquiring for Ferdinand Alvarez, he lighted accidentally on George Alvarez, who was just ready to weigh anchor. This George was a wealthy merchant, a man of probity, and who had an extreme affection for the Father. He received the letters of Alvarez {{as if they had}} been addressed to himself, took the three Japonians into his ship, entertained them with all kindness, and brought them to Malacca; taking great satisfaction in the good office he should do in presenting them to the man of God, who might, perhaps, make them the first Christians of their country. But the misfortune was, that they missed the Father, who was just gone for the Moluccas. Anger, more disquieted in a foreign land than he had been at home, and despairing of ever seeing him, whom he had so often heard of from his friends, had it in his thoughts to have returned to Japan, without considering the danger to which he exposed himself, and almost forgetting the murder which had caused his flight, according to the custom of criminals, who blind themselves in those occasions, and whom divine justice oftentimes brings back to the same place where they had committed their offence. Whereupon, he went again to sea, and having made some little stay in a port of China, he pursued his voyage. Already some Japonian islands were in sight, when there arose a furious tempest, which endangered the sinking of the ship, and which in four days brought him back into the same port of China, from whence he had set out. This was to Anger a <b>favourable</b> <b>effect</b> of God's providence; for the same hand which drives the guilty to the precipice, sometimes preserves them from falling into it, and pulls them back, after a miraculous manner.|$|E
40|$|Biomarkers and imaging {{trials have}} often been used as {{guideposts}} {{in the development of}} drugs for atherosclerosis. This article explores the role of biomarkers and imaging trials in the development of 4 drugs: rimonabant, torcetrapib, ezetimibe, and niacin. Rimonabant, a selective cannabinoid- 1 receptor, causes weight loss and exerts <b>favourable</b> <b>effects</b> on lipid biomarkers. An intracoronary ultrasound study showed no effect for the primary but significant benefit for the secondary end point. A large clinical outcomes trial was halted when it became apparent that the drug caused serious psychiatric side effects, including suicide. Torcetrapib, a cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibitor, lowers low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and induces a marked increase in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. However, a large clinical outcomes trial was halted very prematurely due to a 58 % increase in all-cause mortality. Neutral imaging studies were reported later. Ezetimibe lowers low density lipoprotein cholesterol but did not reduce carotid intima-media thickness, and there is as yet no clinical trial evidence that it reduces cardiovascular events after a decade on the market. Niacin exerts <b>favourable</b> <b>effects</b> on lipid biomarkers and has shown regression of atherosclerosis in small carotid imaging trials, but did not reduce events in a recent clinical trial that was stopped early {{due to a lack of}} efficacy. In summary, <b>favourable</b> <b>effects</b> on lipid biomarkers often do not translate into clinical benefit, and imaging trials, which focus on a narrow measurement of atherosclerosis, are also often not helpful. © 2012 Canadian Cardiovascular Society...|$|R
