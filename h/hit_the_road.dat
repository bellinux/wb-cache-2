5|$|In {{addition}} to the main game, Sam & Max <b>Hit</b> <b>the</b> <b>Road</b> includes several minigames. Some of these, such as a carnival game based on Whac-A-Mole but involving live rats, must be completed {{in order to receive}} new items and further the game's plot, while others, such as a car-themed version of Battleship, are entirely optional as to whether the player uses them. As with the majority of LucasArts adventure games, Sam & Max <b>Hit</b> <b>the</b> <b>Road</b> is designed so that the player characters cannot die or reach a complete dead-end.|$|E
5|$|The {{series has}} been very {{successful}} despite its relatively limited amount of media, and has gathered a significant fan base. However, the franchise did not gain more widespread recognition until after the 1993 release of LucasArts' Sam & Max <b>Hit</b> <b>the</b> <b>Road,</b> which cultivated interest in Purcell's original comics. Sam & Max <b>Hit</b> <b>the</b> <b>Road</b> is regarded as an exceptional adventure game and an iconic classic of computer gaming in the 1990s. Subsequent video games and the television series have also fared well with both critics and fans; critics consider the episodic video games {{to be the first}} successful application of the episodic distribution model.|$|E

5|$|Between 1943 and 1951, fictional collie Lassie was the {{inspiration}} for seven MGM feature films. With completion of the seventh film in 1951, the studio planned no further films for the Lassie character or Pal, the dog actor who portrayed the character. In lieu of $40,000 back pay owed him by MGM, Pal's owner and trainer Rudd Weatherwax took all rights to the Lassie trademark and name, and <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> with Pal to perform at fairs, rodeos, and other venues.|$|E

5|$|LucasArts began {{development}} {{of the game in}} 1992 with the intention to use new settings and characters after the success of the past Maniac Mansion and Monkey Island adventure titles. Series creator Steve Purcell, then a LucasArts employee, was one of the lead designers on the project. Sam & Max <b>Hit</b> <b>the</b> <b>Road</b> is the ninth game to use the SCUMM adventure game engine, and also integrated the iMUSE audio system developed by Michael Land and Peter McConnell. The game {{was one of the first}} to incorporate full voice talent for its characters; the two title characters were voiced by professional voice actors Bill Farmer and Nick Jameson.|$|E

5|$|The game {{implements}} {{an inventory}} system to allow Sam to store any items that the player picks {{up during the}} course of the game. The player may select any of the items in the inventory and can then attempt to use them on objects in the game world or give them to other characters simply by clicking on the desired target. Unlike Save the Worlds predecessor, Sam & Max <b>Hit</b> <b>the</b> <b>Road,</b> inventory items are context specific, and cannot be used together or combined to create new items. Typically, Sam carries a gun that may be used to solve several puzzles.|$|E
5|$|Word was {{spreading}} about the band's bizarre stage show {{by the time}} they <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> again, resulting in ever-larger audiences at their concerts. Not long after Malcolm's arrival, the band recorded their act for posterity by filming two concerts at Detroit's Traxx club. Some of this footage was eventually packaged as Blind Eye Sees All, their only official video release to date. They purchased their first 8-track recorder at this time, and used it to record two songs later used on the A-side of Cream Corn from the Socket of Davis.|$|E
5|$|Sam & Max <b>Hit</b> <b>the</b> <b>Road</b> was {{developed}} by a small team at LucasArts, {{many of whom had}} previous experience working on other LucasArts adventure games. The game was designed by Sean Clark, Michael Stemmle, Sam & Max creator Steve Purcell and his future wife Collette Michaud, all of whom had worked on Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis. Sam and Max first appeared as video game characters as internal testing material for SCUMM engine programmers recently employed by LucasArts; Steve Purcell created animated versions of the characters and an office backdrop for the programmers to practice on. Soon after, Sam & Max comic strips by Steve Purcell were published in LucasArts' quarterly newsletter. After a positive reaction from fans to the strips and out of a wish to use new characters and settings after the success of the Monkey Island and Maniac Mansion franchises, LucasArts offered in 1992 to create a video game out of the characters.|$|E

5|$|The Sam & Max {{franchise}} {{features a}} variety of soundtracks that accompany its video game products. This music is mostly grounded in film noir jazz, incorporating various other styles at certain points, such as Dixieland, waltz and mariachi, usually to support the cartoon nature of the series. The first Sam & Max game, Sam & Max <b>Hit</b> <b>the</b> <b>Road,</b> {{was one of the}} first games to feature a fully scored music soundtrack, written by LucasArts' composers Clint Bajakian, Michael Land and Peter McConnell. The music was incorporated into the game using Land and McConnell's iMUSE engine, which allowed for audio to be synchronized with the visuals. Although the full soundtrack was never released, audio renders of four of the game's MIDI tracks were included on the CD version of the game.|$|E
5|$|After LucasArts' license with Steve Purcell {{expired in}} 2005, the Sam & Max {{franchise}} moved to Telltale Games, {{a company of}} former LucasArts employees who had worked {{on a number of}} LucasArts adventure games, including on the development of Freelance Police. Under Telltale Games, a new episodic series of Sam & Max video games was announced. Like both Sam & Max <b>Hit</b> <b>the</b> <b>Road</b> and Freelance Police, Sam & Max Save the World was in a point-and-click graphic adventure game format, although it lacked the original voice actors for the characters. The first season ran for six episodes, each with a self-contained storyline but with an overall story arc running through the series. The first episode was released on GameTap in October 2006, with episodes following regularly until April 2007, and a special compilation on the Wii released in October 2008. A second season, Sam & Max Beyond Time and Space, began in November 2007 and ended in April 2008. This was also released as a compilation on the Wii. Originally expected to be released in 2009, a third season, , began in April 2010.|$|E
5|$|Sam & Max <b>Hit</b> <b>the</b> <b>Road</b> is a 2D {{adventure}} {{game where}} the player controls {{the actions of}} Sam from a third-person perspective. The player uses Sam to explore the pre-rendered cartoon environments {{of the game and}} solve a series of puzzles using a simple point-and-click interface. The game's puzzles have logical solutions, although a number of them have far-fetched solutions due to the game's cartoon setting. Players can set the game's cursor in a particular mode to designate how Sam interacts with the environment: Sam can walk around an area, talk to other characters, look at objects, pick them up or otherwise try to use them. The cursor's graphic changes when it is hovered over an in-game entity that Sam can interact with. When talking to another character, the player is given a choice of subject areas to discuss, depicted in a conversation tree as icons {{at the base of the}} screen. In addition to specific topics involving the game's plot, Sam can inject unconnected exclamations, questions and non sequiturs into a conversation.|$|E

5|$|Sam and Max, the Freelance Police, are two {{comic book}} {{characters}} created by Steve Purcell, who act as private detectives and vigilantes. Sam & Max <b>Hit</b> <b>the</b> <b>Road</b> follows the pair {{on a case}} that takes them from their office in New York City across the United States. The game starts {{in a similar way}} to many of the comic stories, with Sam and Max receiving a telephone call from an unseen and unheard Commissioner, who tells them to go to a nearby carnival. At the carnival, they are told by the owners that their star attraction, a frozen bigfoot called Bruno, has been set free and fled taking their second attraction, Trixie the Giraffe-Necked Girl. Sam and Max set off to find Bruno and Trixie and bring them back. As the duo investigate the carnival, they learn that Bruno and Trixie are in love and that Trixie freed Bruno. The Freelance Police leave the carnival to pursue leads at various tourist traps throughout the country, such as The World's Largest Ball of Twine, a vortex controlled by giant subterranean magnets and bungee jumping facilities at Mount Rushmore.|$|E
