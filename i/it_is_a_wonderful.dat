[...] DVD Verdict's Jennifer Malkowski gave the episode a B+, declaring the episode's [...] "highlight" [...] "one of the reasons the Screamapillar is endangered, that it's 'sexually attracted to fire.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|In Wind, Whales and Whisky, Silver Donald Cameron {{discusses}} one of {{the ironies}} he sees about life in Cape Breton. On the one hand, the island seems poor with chronic unemployment, but on the other, its rural inhabitants have access to abundant and delicious food such as apples, cranberries, fish, deer, moose and the produce from their gardens. After describing [...] "the most unbelievably wonderful meal of the voyage"—lobster and grey sole baked in the oven with tinned mushroom soup accompanied by scalloped potatoes and broccoli, Cameron writes: [...] "I love living in a depressed region, I thought. One lives so well." [...] In a chapter entitled, Good People in Bad Times, Cameron outlines the troubles of industrial Cape Breton including the long decline of two of its economic mainstays, coal mining and steel making. [...] "It is a hard place to make a living," [...] he writes, [...] "but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> place to live." ...|$|E
2500|$|Independent {{experts have}} raised concern about {{publicity}} exaggerating {{the importance of}} the find before information was available for scrutiny. Chris Beard, curator of the Carnegie Museum of Natural History, was [...] "awestruck" [...] by the publicity machine but concerned that if the hype was exaggerated, it could damage the popularisation of science if the creature was not all that it was hyped up to be. Paleoanthropologist Elwyn Simons of Duke University stated that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> specimen but most of the information had been previously known, and paleoanthropologist Peter Brown of the University of New England said that the paper had insufficient evidence that Darwinius was ancestral to the simians. Others have also criticized claims that the fossil represents the [...] "missing link in human evolution", arguing {{that there is no such}} thing unless evolution is visualized as a chain as there are an enormous number of missing branches, and that while the fossil is a primate, there is no evidence to suggest that its species is a direct ancestor of humans. ScienceBlogger Brian Switek questioned the sensationalist coverage of claims of ancestral relationships made before a full cladistic analysis, and in a column in The Times he stated that a unique opportunity to communicate science had been lost, with press releases forestalling the necessary discovery and debate which should now proceed.|$|E

50|$|During those days, {{the thing}} that was so very {{pleasant}} was that there were no standards of writing. You were turned loose to think of something and do it.

500|$|I deplore {{the fact}} that East Germans were shot while trying to flee westward, but the Berlin Wall served a useful purpose.

2500|$|Whilst Rouvas was {{disappointed}} with his seventh-place finish, announcing to Greek media [...] "I am so sorry, I {{wanted us to}} win", there was still unanimous support towards the artist himself in the country. [...] "Seventh in Europe, first in our hearts" [...] many journalists reported on Greek television. The media and public pronounced their support for Rouvas, the general consensus being that the artist gave it his best even though this did not translate in enough votes in the contest. All criticism in Greece focused on {{the selection of the}} song itself, rather than the artist's performance. Rouvas stated that, overall, <b>it</b> has all <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> experience for him: [...] "some win, some lose, personally, I gave everything I had.
