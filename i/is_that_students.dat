25|$|With the {{adoption}} of standards-based education, most states have created examinations in which students are compared to a standard of what educators, businesspeople, parents, and other stakeholders have determined to be what every student {{should know and be}} able to do. Students are graded as exceeding, meeting, or falling below the standard. The advantage <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>students</b> are not compared against each other, and all have the opportunity to pass the standard. However, the standard is typically set at a level that is substantially higher than previous achievement, so that a relatively high percentage of students fail at least some part of the standards in the first year, including an especially high percentage non-college bound students.|$|E
25|$|The Van Wickle Gates, {{dedicated}} on June 18, 1901, have a pair {{of smaller}} side gates that are open year-round, and a large central gate that is opened two days a year for Convocation and Commencement. At Convocation the gate opens inward to admit the procession of new students. At Commencement the gate opens outward for the procession of graduates. A Brown superstition <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>students</b> who walk through the central gate a second time prematurely will not graduate, although walking backwards is said to cancel the hex. Members of the Brown University Band famously flout the superstition by walking through the gate three times too many, as they annually play {{their role in the}} Commencement parade.|$|E
25|$|Liberty University has an {{internet}} education component {{which is called}} LU Online, previously the Distance Learning Program (DLP). Prior to the launch of its online education component in 2009, Liberty University provided adult learning courses through the LU School of Lifelong Learning (LUSLLL) by way of its External Degree Program. The LUSLLL was Liberty University's fastest growing school at the time with Jerry Falwell forecasting in his 1997 autobiography an enrollment of 40,000 students in the early 21st Century, with the expectation of an addition 10,000 students studying on campus at the same time. Both expectations have been surpassed by current enrollment figures. Liberty's online component currently provides degrees from Associates level to Doctorate. The online school runs unilaterally with the semester program offered at Liberty University's campus. One difference with LU Online <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>students</b> take 16-week (full semester) classes for {{a few of their}} cataloged courses while the remainder are taken in 8-week subterms which are titled B, C, and D. These subterms provide the student with scheduling flexibility through shorter, slightly overlapping sessions. There is a separation at the 600-level and above at which courses are only offered in the B and D terms. LU Online promotes teacher/student discourse through interactive online discussions and class size limits (capped at 25 students). Liberty University reports that enrollment for their online program is six times greater than their residential enrollment, with about 80,000 of their 92,500 total students enrolled online.|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{intended}} to describe the students’ problems in learning English conversation class as the extra curricular activity at Madrasah Aliyah Maarif Sukorejo, Pasuruan. Descriptive qualitative research {{was used as the}} design of this study to collect all information to answer the problems. The population research of this study <b>was</b> second year <b>students</b> <b>that</b> contains of 15 students and one English teacher. The data were obtained through the unstructered interview for English teacher and mix questionnaire for the students which were presented descriptively after being classified into related aspects. The result of this study shows <b>that</b> the <b>students</b> face some problems. First <b>that</b> <b>were</b> related to inhibition <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>students</b> felt ashame if they got attention when they were speaking English. Second, some problems <b>that</b> <b>were</b> related to nothing to say <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the <b>students</b> have not any idea to express their opinion when they are learning speaking. Third, some problems <b>that</b> <b>were</b> related to low or uneven participation <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the <b>students</b> felt less in participation when they are learning speaking. Fourth, some problems <b>that</b> <b>were</b> related to mother tongue use was as follows, students were afraid of criticisms by their friend in speaking class. The causes of the problems were, first the causes <b>that</b> <b>was</b> related to inhibition <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>students</b> felt ashame if they got attention because they thought that they became centre of attention in the class. Second, the cause <b>that</b> <b>was</b> related to nothing to say <b>were</b> <b>that</b> the <b>students</b> had not any idea because the students did not master the material. Third, the cause <b>that</b> <b>was</b> related to low or un-even participation <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>students</b> less in participation because teacher explains about tenses. The last, the cause <b>that</b> <b>was</b> related to mother tongue use <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>students</b> felt afraid of criticism by their friends because they would be regarded as cleverer than others...|$|R

500|$|The school's {{philosophy}} <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>students</b> learn best {{at their}} own pace. The original curriculum was a cross between [...] "instruction and home life". The Albany Free School has no firm schedule and does not grade students. The day begins at 8:15a.m. and students are asked {{what they want to}} do each day. Students are grouped by age and present their own plan for each day. They pursue various projects including writing, filmmaking, and studying language or history. The school also offers structured math and reading classes for those who want it. Classes tend to have five to seven students per teacher and the school's teacher–student relationships are close. Teachers report a relative ease in holding students accountable to their stated plans. In 2006, the school had ten teachers, four interns, and a number of parent volunteers for 58 students between the ages of three and fourteen (pre-K to eighth grade). The school has a [...] "Living and Learning" [...] program between 10 a.m. and noon, followed by lunch, which the students make themselves as part of the program. The children play sports until their 3 p.m. class and school ends at 4 p.m.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{important}} pedagogical {{feature of}} GCE is learning through communicative practices {{outside the classroom}} that [...] "harness [...] the educational force of the wider culture". If students are encouraged [...] "to see themselves as political agents", educators assume {{they are more likely}} to acquire the knowledge, skills and abilities that enable them to [...] become agents of change. Another important element of the student-centered participatory nature of GCED, <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>students,</b> through their engagement with others via Social Network Services, create their own forms of global citizenship through dialogue, learning, and action. This is [...] an important element, for example, in the activities of grassroots organizations like 'GIN' (Global Issues Network), which involves students and teachers in projects that address global issues such as human rights, trade rules, and deforestation. Such student-driven, student-led projects combine both the 'global consciousness' and 'global competence' aspects of GCED.|$|E
2500|$|Competition {{is divided}} into six levels or divisions, Calculus, Pre-calculus, Algebra II, Geometry, Algebra I, and Statistics. At state and {{national}} competitions, only three levels are used: Theta (Geometry and Algebra II), Alpha (Pre-Calculus), and Calculus. There is only a Mu division at the nationals level. Additionally, there are usually Open tests, which can be taken by students from any division, including Statistics, Number Theory, and History of Math. Most students start {{at the level of}} math that they are currently enrolled in or have last taken and progress to higher levels. [...] A student can begin at another level, but it must be higher. The only exception to this <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>students</b> enrolled in either Algebra II or Geometry can take whichever of the two they want because not all schools offer these courses in the same sequence. If a student competes in a higher level, such as Pre-Calculus, he/she cannot then go back and compete at the Algebra II level. [...] This encourages students to compete with other students who are taking classes of similar mathematical difficulty.|$|E

2500|$|How early {{decision}} affects financial aid. There are {{conflicting reports}} about how early decision affects aid offers. The more widely held {{view is that}} a student's bargaining position is weaker because the student cannot compare offers from different colleges. Since the applicant is declaring an intention to attend if accepted, then the school can [...] "pinpoint the smallest amount of financial aid it will take {{for the student to}} attend." [...] There have been reports of problems with early Decision aid offers falling below levels that had been expected prior to applying. A report in the Chicago Tribune suggested that applying early decision could cost [...] "thousands more than necessary." [...] A report in US News pointed to a research study concluding that regular decision applicants get more financial aid than early ones. Lynn O'Shaughnessy described early decision as [...] "essentially applying blind" [...] because a student has agreed to attend before seeing the financial aid package; and this practice [...] "favors rich students." [...] Several reports confirm that early decision applicants tend to come from wealthier families. However, a contrasting view <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>students</b> who apply early have an advantage getting aid because they are applying earlier in the year when that aid is being doled out, and the early decision kids have [...] "first crack at the money," [...] particularly at competitive schools without extra-large endowments. Two reports suggested that while a student's bargaining position is somewhat weaker, it is not totally diminished, and that if a college thinks an early decision admittee may withdraw because of financial concerns, the college [...] "may pull out all the stops" [...] to prevent this, and that the possibility of backing out for financial reasons gives an applicant some form of negotiating leverage. Ivy League universities and other universities with large endowments may be somewhat different, in the sense that all aid offers are likely to be based solely on financial need, and that whether an applicant applied by early or regular methods would have no impact on the resulting financial aid package, according to one report.|$|E
