5|$|At the {{beginning}} of <b>his</b> <b>rule,</b> the government was divided between two PDPA factions: the Khalqists (which Taraki was the leader of), the majority, and the Parchamites, the minority. In 1978, shortly after <b>his</b> <b>rule</b> began, Taraki started a purge {{of the government and}} party which led to several high-ranking Parchamite members being sent into de facto exile by being assigned to serve overseas as ambassadors. His reign was marked by a cult of personality centered on himself that had been cultivated by Amin. His relationship with Amin turned sour during <b>his</b> <b>rule,</b> ultimately resulting in Taraki's overthrow on 14 September 1979 and subsequent murder on 8 or 9 October, upon Amin's orders.|$|E

The king then used Ambohimanga as a launching point for a successful campaign to bring the twelve sacred hills of Imerina under <b>his</b> <b>rule,</b> including the hill city of Antananarivo, thereby reuniting the four quadrants of the divided Kingdom of Imerina under his sovereignty and {{putting an end to}} 77 years of civil war. To consolidate support for <b>his</b> <b>rule,</b> Andrianampoinimerina mobilized representatives of the numerous noble castes to participate in the most extensive effort yet to expand and fortify Ambohimanga. He ordered the construction of new city walls, gates and defensive trenches, as well as a rosewood palace called Mahandrihono, which he had built in the traditional style.|$|E

5|$|As Zahir {{consolidated}} {{his power}} and reduced external threats to <b>his</b> <b>rule</b> in the 1760s, his sons aspired for more influence and ultimately fought against their father and each other {{in order to secure}} their place as Zahir's successor. Besides support from elements of the Zaydani clan, Zahir's sons maintained their own power bases, largely derived from their mothers' clans, and also made their own alliances with other powerful actors in the region. Zahir was victorious in the many conflicts he had with his sons, but their frequent dissent weakened <b>his</b> <b>rule</b> and played a contributory role to his downfall in 1775. Prior to his sons' individual rebellions, Zahir had eliminated other relatives who challenged his power.|$|E

5|$|Henry {{placed a}} {{symbolic}} emphasis on rebuilding royal authority, but <b>his</b> <b>rule</b> was relatively circumscribed by Magna Carta.

The charters did not address the sensitive issues of the appointment of royal advisers and the distribution of patronage, and they lacked any means of enforcement if the King chose to ignore them. The inconsistency with which he applied the charters over the course of <b>his</b> <b>rule</b> alienated many barons, even those within his own faction.|$|E
