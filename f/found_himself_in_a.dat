5|$|The Bills were {{returning}} from 1–13 and 4–9–1 records in 1971 and 1972, respectively. Incumbent starting quarterback Dennis Shaw <b>found</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> battle with rookie Joe Ferguson for the starting job.|$|E
5|$|After Boroughbridge Pembroke <b>found</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> {{difficult}} situation. The {{opponents of}} Hugh Despenser {{and his father}} had lost all faith in him, {{but at the same time}} he found himself marginalised at court where the Despensers' power grew more and more complete. On top of this came his financial problems. On 24 June 1324, while on an embassy to France, he suddenly collapsed and died while lodging somewhere in Picardy.|$|E
5|$|After Grant's army {{slipped past}} Lee's army {{to cross the}} James River, Hancock <b>found</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> {{position}} from which he might have ended the war. His corps arrived to support William Farrar Smith's assaults on the lightly held Petersburg defensive lines, but he deferred to Smith's advice because Smith knew the ground and {{had been on the}} field all day, and no significant assaults were made before the Confederate lines were reinforced. One of the great opportunities of the war was lost. After his corps participated in the assaults at Deep Bottom, Hancock was promoted to brigadier general in the regular army, effective August 12, 1864.|$|E

50|$|On this occasion, Burbank {{worked with}} the evil Hyperion of the {{mainstream}} Marvel Universe, and held captive the visiting Thor. Burbank was taken captive but later <b>found</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> interdimensional vacuum as he attempted to escape confinement.|$|R
5|$|At 1.15 pm, Parker {{was waiting}} outside the harbour with the reserve {{and raised a}} signal {{ordering}} Nelson to withdraw. Nelson acknowledged the signal but ignored it, while Nelson's second in command, Rear-Admiral Thomas Graves, repeated the signal but too did not obey it. Riou now <b>found</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> difficult position. Too junior an officer to risk disobeying a direct order, he remained in action for a further {{half an hour before}} reluctantly giving the order for his small squadron to withdraw.|$|E
5|$|Auriemma <b>found</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> {{national}} debate following a decision he {{made during the}} 1997–98 season. Senior Nykesha Sales suffered a season-ending injury {{in one of the}} final games of the regular season. At the time of her injury, she was only one point shy of Kerry Bascom's school scoring record. The next game, with Bascom's blessing, and assistance from friend and Villanova head coach Harry Paretta, Auriemma arranged to have Sales, who was on crutches, score a basket and then allow Villanova to score a basket to start the game at 2–2. Sales then held the school scoring record.|$|E
5|$|In 1933–34, Johnson {{earned his}} fourth {{consecutive}} post-season all-star nod, {{on the second}} team. He also participated in the first all-star game in NHL history as the league held a benefit game {{to raise money for}} Toronto's Ace Bailey, whose career was ended by a violent hit early in the season. Johnson contemplated retirement following that season as he again <b>found</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> dispute with the Rangers on a new contract, but signed prior to the season's start. His season was again reduced by injury in 1934–35 but he returned in time for the playoffs.|$|E

50|$|Donnelly {{started the}} first 5 {{games of the}} 2010 Super 14 season before being ruled out {{for the rest of}} the {{campaign}} with a serious ankle injury.

5|$|In 2013, Weinberg again <b>found</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> {{real estate}} dispute, {{threatening}} {{legal action against}} Monmouth County in connection with its attempt to repair damage to the Henry Hudson Trail in Atlantic Highlands following damage caused by Superstorm Sandy. Weinberg claimed that the work done in creating {{that portion of the}} trail, augmented by Sandy, had caused significant damage to two properties he and his wife owned there. The issue was still ongoing in 2014.|$|E
5|$|On {{becoming}} king in 548, Thurisind immediately <b>found</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> difficult situation. Sometime during 546–548, the Byzantine Empire had {{conspired to}} convince the Lombards under Audoin to move into Pannonia (modern Hungary), a former Roman province bordering the Danube river. Justinian hoped this would keep open the land route from the Balkans to Italy while containing the Gepids, who he considered a serious menace to Byzantine interests on the Balkan frontier. The Gothic War between the Ostrogoths and the Byzantines had been raging on the Italian peninsula since 535; Justinian {{wanted to be able}} to rush troops to Italy if they were needed.|$|E
5|$|Vespasian moved {{rapidly to}} Egypt, leaving the Jewish war {{under the command}} of Titus. At the same time Alexander, as a proven {{commander}} with experience of Jewish affairs, was sent by Vespasian to join Titus as his chief of staff and adviser, second only to Titus himself. By April 70, Jerusalem was under siege by four legions, and even after the city walls were overcome, the defenders held out in the Temple. Alexander, the offspring of a pious Jewish family, whose own father had donated the gold and silver for the Temple gates, now <b>found</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> position of command against his former brothers in that very sanctuary.|$|E
50|$|In 1838, Maurice O'Connell {{returned}} to Sydney {{in command of}} the forces. He was senior member of the executive council when, the question of the rights of Bligh's daughters to certain land granted to Bligh in 1806 having been again raised, Governor Gipps <b>found</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> extremely delicate position. The matter was settled by compromise in 1841.|$|R
50|$|In 1580 Wtenbogaert {{was sent}} at the city's expense to study {{theology}} in Geneva and {{came into contact}} with Theodore Beza; but his sympathies were with Jacobus Arminius. On his return to Utrecht <b>in</b> 1584 he <b>found</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> awkward position <b>in</b> the continuing discord. Eventually in 1590 the magistrates removed the preachers from both sides.|$|R
50|$|When the {{war ended}} (WWII), Walter Newcomb <b>found</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> enviable position. The {{amusement}} business was expected to see a great surge {{with the return of}} the country's military personnel and a general feeling of national pride. With the closure of the Venice Pier reducing his competition, he relocated his Venice-based carousel into the old Looff Hippodrome.|$|R
5|$|In 1828, Ibrahim Pasha thus <b>found</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> {{difficult}} situation: he {{had just}} suffered a defeat at Navarino; the joint fleet exercised a blockade which prevented him from receiving reinforcements and supplies; his Albanian troops, whom {{he could no longer}} pay, had returned to their country under the protection of Theodoros Kolokotronis’ Greek troops. On August 6, 1828, a convention had been signed at Alexandria between the viceroy of Egypt, Muhammad Ali, and the British admiral Edward Codrington. Ibrahim Pasha had to evacuate his Egyptian troops and leave the Peloponnese to the few Turkish troops (estimated at 1200 men) remaining there. However, Ibrahim Pasha refused to honor the agreement that had been reached, continuing to control various Greek regions: Messenia, Navarino, Patras and several other strongholds. He had also ordered the systematic destruction of Tripoli.|$|E
5|$|Johnson <b>found</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> {{difficult}} situation during the Indian {{leg of the}} tour. The team—mostly made up of RAAF personnel—had been ill with food poisoning and dysentery, and travelled across the Indian subcontinent by long train journeys. The airmen wanted to travel by air, and threatened to abandon the tour or replace Hassett, an AIF member, with either Keith Carmody or Keith Miller, who were RAAF fighter pilots. However, the standoff was ended when Sismey arranged for a RAAF plane to transport the team. On the playing arena, {{it was not a}} happy tour for Johnson and his men. They lost the three-match series against India 1–0 and recorded only one victory, against South Zone, in their nine matches.|$|E
5|$|On {{his return}} to his homeland, Pyrrhus <b>found</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> {{difficult}} position. His Italian sojourn had emptied his coffers and crippled his army, leaving him reliant on Sicilian mercenaries who required payment. In order to secure funds to pay his troops, Pyrrhus planned a war against Antigonus II Gonatas, the new king of Macedon. Citing Antigonus' refusal to provide him with aid during his Italian expedition as a casus belli, Pyrrhus invaded Macedon {{in the spring of}} 274 BC. He was accompanied by an army consisting of 8,000 infantry and 500 cavalry although their numbers were probably augmented by Gallic mercenaries. It has been speculated that by invading Macedon, Pyrrhus was acting as the agent of the monarchs of Ptolemaic Egypt, Ptolemy II and Arsinoe II, however N. G. L. Hammond posits that this is highly unlikely.|$|E

60|$|Norgate <b>found</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> {{atmosphere}} of strange excitement during his two hours' {{waiting at the}} House of Commons on the following day. He was ushered at last into Mr. Hebblethwaite's private room. Hebblethwaite had just {{come in from the}} House and was leaning <b>a</b> little back <b>in</b> his chair, <b>in</b> <b>an</b> attitude of repose. He glanced at Norgate with a faint smile.|$|R
60|$|Siegmund <b>found</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> abbey. He {{looked up}} the nave of the night, where the sky came down on the sea-like arches, and he watched the stars catch fire. At least it was all sacred, {{whatever}} the God might be. Helena herself, the bitter bread, was stuff of the ceremony, which he touched with his lips {{as part of the}} service.|$|R
5|$|As-Salih Ayyub was ill and {{his health}} {{deteriorated}} further {{due to the}} mounting pressure from the Crusader offensive. His wife Shajar al-Durr called a meeting of all the war generals and thus became commander-in-chief of the Egyptian forces. She ordered the fortification of Mansurah and then stored large quantities of provisions and concentrated her forces there. She also organized a fleet of war galleys and scattered them at various strategic points along the Nile River. Crusader attempts to capture Mansurah were thwarted and King Louis <b>found</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> critical position. He managed to cross the Nile to launch a surprise attack against Mansurah. Meanwhile, as-Salih Ayyub died, but Shajar al-Durr and as-Salih Ayyub's Bahri Mamluk generals, including Rukn al-Din Baybars and Aybak, countered the assault and inflicted heavy losses on the Crusaders. Simultaneously, Egyptian forces cut off the Crusader's line of supply from Damietta, preventing the arrival of reinforcements. As-Salih Ayyub's son and the newly proclaimed Ayyubid sultan al-Mu'azzam Turan-Shah reached Mansurah {{at this point and}} intensified the battle against the Crusaders. The latter ultimately surrendered at the Battle of Fariskur, and King Louis and his companions were arrested.|$|E
5|$|Following the annulment, Cromwell was {{executed}} on 28 July. Cranmer now <b>found</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> politically prominent position, with no-one else to shoulder the burden. Throughout {{the rest of}} Henry's reign, he clung to Henry's authority. The king had total trust in him and in return, Cranmer could not conceal anything from the king. At the end of June 1541, Henry with his new wife, Catherine Howard, left for {{his first visit to}} the north of England. Cranmer was left in London {{as a member of a}} council taking care of matters for the king in his absence. His colleagues were Lord Chancellor Thomas Audley and Edward Seymour, Earl of Hertford. This was Cranmer's first major piece of responsibility outside the Church. In October, while the king and queen were away, a reformer named John Lascelles revealed to Cranmer that Catherine engaged in extramarital affairs. Cranmer gave the information to Audley and Seymour and they decided to wait until Henry's return. Afraid of angering the king, Audley and Seymour suggested that Cranmer inform Henry. Cranmer slipped a message to Henry during mass on All Saints Day. An investigation revealed the truth of the marital indiscretions and Catherine {{was executed}} in February 1542.|$|E
5|$|Further, {{the work}} shows {{evidence}} of its having been {{put together in}} a very haphazard and hasty fashion, with little to no subsequent editing of the material to form a cohesive narrative. Birley sees {{an example of the}} carelessness with which the author approached the work in the construction of Marcus Aurelius' biography, where midway through the Life of Marcus Aurelius the author <b>found</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> muddle, probably because he had historical material in excess of what he required, and also because he had already used up much of his source to write separate biographies of Lucius Verus and Avidius Cassius, whose lives intersected with Marcus'. The answer he came up with was to use Eutropius as his source for a brief overview of Marcus' principate following the death of Lucius Verus. However, he found that in doing so, the narrative's ending was too abrupt and so, after including some gossip about Commodus not being his son, he once again began an account of Marcus' reign after the death of Verus.|$|E

50|$|At {{some point}} after World War II, Jones was {{entrapped}} in the mystical Urn of Pandora, along {{with scores of}} other heroes, by the misguided Fighting Yank.

What part this hero will play in the modern world remains to be seen.|$|R
5|$|In Mumbai and Aurangabad, police {{rounded up}} more than 400MNS workers. In Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad, MNS workers went on a rampage {{following}} the arrest of Raj, smashing windows and windscreens of eleven state buses. Thirteen rioters were arrested. They also chopped off both hands of a Bihari hawker sleeping on the streets. He was severely beaten until he fell unconscious. When he gained consciousness the following day, he <b>found</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> hospital with both hands amputated. The injured, mainly hawkers, were treated at the Nashik Civil Hospital after they were beaten. Shops along Nashik Road closed down after the incident. Incidents of stone pelting on state-run buses were reported from the Nashik Road, Ambad, Ravivar Peth, and Gangapur areas. Bus services were severely curtailed and diverted via Nipani. In Amrawati, MNS workers blocked roads and pelted stones at buses, damaging several vehicles in the process. Though contingents of the Rapid Action Force and the Central Industrial Security Force were deployed {{in many parts of}} the state, the police could not control violence by the MNS who adopted hit-and-run methods of attack. More than 200activists of the MNS were arrested across Nashik. Many activists went underground and coordinated with party activists from undisclosed locations.|$|E
5|$|In {{a letter}} dated 24 September 1554, Knox {{received}} {{an invitation from}} a congregation of English exiles in Frankfurt {{to become one of}} their ministers. He accepted the call with Calvin's blessing. But no sooner had he arrived than he <b>found</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> conflict. The first set of refugees to arrive in Frankfurt had subscribed to a reformed liturgy and used {{a modified version of the}} Book of Common Prayer. More recently arrived refugees, however, including Edmund Grindal, the future Archbishop of Canterbury, favoured a stricter application of the book. When Knox and a supporting colleague, William Whittingham, wrote to Calvin for advice, they were told to avoid contention. Knox therefore agreed on a temporary order of service based on a compromise between the two sides. This delicate balance was disturbed when a new batch of refugees arrived that included Richard Cox, one of the principal authors of the Book of Common Prayer. Cox brought Knox's pamphlet attacking the emperor to the attention of the Frankfurt authorities, who advised that Knox leave. His departure from Frankfurt on 26 March 1555 marked his final breach with the Church of England.|$|E
5|$|Stephen became {{increasingly}} concerned with ensuring {{that his son}} Eustace would inherit his throne. The King tried to convince the Church to agree to crown Eustace to reinforce his claim; Pope Eugene III refused, and Stephen <b>found</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> sequence of increasingly bitter arguments with his senior clergy. In 1153 the Empress's son, Henry FitzEmpress, invaded England and built an alliance of powerful regional barons to support his claim for the throne. The two armies met at Wallingford, but neither side's barons were keen to fight another pitched battle. Stephen began to examine a negotiated peace, a process hastened by {{the sudden death of}} Eustace. Later in the year Stephen and Henry agreed to the Treaty of Winchester, in which Stephen recognised Henry as his heir in exchange for peace, passing over William, Stephen's second son. Stephen died the following year. Modern historians have extensively debated the extent to which Stephen's personality, external events, or the weaknesses in the Norman state contributed to this prolonged period of civil war.|$|E
50|$|Anti-aircraft guns started firing heavily, and he <b>found</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> intense {{barrage of}} flak. Rushing to escape at full {{throttle}} {{with a number}} of enemy fighters behind him, he succeeded in returning safely from the battlefield. His leader Kuroiwa had already returned to the Wuhu airfield, Anhui China, waiting for his return. Kuroiwa scolded Tetsu severely for the rash attacks he made on the day.|$|R
50|$|In 1915, he {{was forced}} to {{evacuate}} from the front to the interior, and lived in Moscow at the Chudov Monastery. In the end of 1915, he was appointed to the Eparchy of Chişinău and Khotin, and in 1916 he was elevated to the rank of archbishop. With the opening of the Romanian front, Archbishop Anastasy once again <b>found</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> area with military operations.|$|R
