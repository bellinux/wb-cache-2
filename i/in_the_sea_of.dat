5|$|British and French {{submarine}} operations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sea</b> <b>of</b> Marmara {{were the}} one significant area of success of the Gallipoli Campaign, forcing the Ottomans to abandon the sea as a transport route. Between April and December 1915, nine British and four French submarines carried out 15 patrols, sinking one battleship, one destroyer, five gunboats, 11 troop transports, 44 supply ships and 148 sailing vessels {{at a cost of}} eight Allied submarines sunk in the strait or <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sea</b> <b>of</b> Marmara. During the campaign there was always one British submarine <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sea</b> <b>of</b> Marmara, sometimes two; in October 1915, there were four Allied submarines in the region. E2 left the Sea of Marmara on 2 January 1916, the last British submarine in the region. Four E-class and five B-class submarines remained in the Mediterranean Sea following the evacuation of Helles. By this time the Ottoman navy had been all but forced to cease operations in the area, while merchant shipping had also been significantly curtailed. The official German naval historian, Admiral Eberhard von Mantey, later concluded that had the sea-lanes of communication been completely severed the Ottoman 5th Army would likely have faced catastrophe. As it was these operations were a source of significant anxiety, posing a constant threat to shipping and causing heavy losses, effectively dislocating Ottoman attempts to reinforce their forces at Gallipoli and shelling troop concentrations and railways.|$|E
5|$|Caprellamutica {{were first}} {{described}} in 1935 by A. Schurin from specimens {{collected from the}} Peter the Great Gulf <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sea</b> <b>of</b> Japan. It belongs to the genus Caprella in the subfamily Caprellinae of the family Caprellidae, a group of highly specialized amphipods commonly known as skeleton shrimp. Caprellids are classified under the superfamily Caprelloidea of the infraorder Caprellida.|$|E

5|$|After {{being sent}} toward the Moon by the Saturn V's upper stage, the astronauts {{separated}} the spacecraft {{from it and}} traveled for three days until they entered into lunar orbit. Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into the lunar module Eagle and landed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sea</b> <b>of</b> Tranquility. They stayed {{a total of about}} 21.5 hours on the lunar surface. The astronauts used Eagles upper stage to lift off from the lunar surface and rejoin Collins in the command module. They jettisoned Eagle before they performed the maneuvers that blasted them out of lunar orbit on a trajectory back to Earth. They returned to Earth and landed in the Pacific Ocean on July 24.|$|E
5|$|C. mutica {{are native}} to shallow {{protected}} {{bodies of water}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sea</b> <b>of</b> Japan. In as little as 40 years, they have become an invasive species in the North Atlantic, North Pacific, and along the coasts of New Zealand. They {{are believed to have}} been accidentally introduced to these areas through the global maritime traffic and aquaculture. Outside of their native range, C.mutica are often exclusively synanthropic, being found in large numbers in and around areas of human activity. Their ecological and economic impact as an invasive species is unknown, but they pose a serious threat to native populations of skeleton shrimp in the affected areas.|$|E

5|$|Eschrichtiidae {{consists}} {{of only one}} living member: the gray whale (Eschrichtius robustus). The two populations, one <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sea</b> <b>of</b> Okhotsk and Sea of Japan {{and the other in}} the Mediterranean Sea and East Atlantic, are thought to be genetically and physiologically dissimilar. The gray whale is traditionally placed as the only living species in its genus and family. However, DNA analysis by studies, such as the one by Takeshi Sasaki (of the Tokyo Institute of Technology) and colleagues, indicates certain rorquals, such as the humpback whale, Megaptera novaeangliae, and the fin whale, Balaenoptera physalus, are more closely related to the gray whale than they are to some other rorquals, such as the minke whale, Balaenoptera acutorostrata.|$|E
5|$|For Asian stocks, {{resident}} {{groups may}} {{exist in the}} Yellow Sea and East China Sea, and the Sea of Japan (though these populations are critically endangered and the population off China, Korea, and Japan are either near extinction or in very small numbers). Very small increases in sightings have been confirmed off Shiretoko Peninsula, Abashiri, and Kushiro in Hokkaido, Tsushima, Sado Island, off Maiduru <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sea</b> <b>of</b> Japan since in late 2000s as whales in Sea of Okhotsk might have started recolonizing into former habitats (for coastal Sakhalin, as well). Whales possibly used to migrated into Seto Inland Sea.|$|E
5|$|Fresh fish {{is readily}} available, caught off Israel's coastal {{areas of the}} Mediterranean and the Red Sea, or <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sea</b> <b>of</b> Galilee, or raised in ponds {{in the wake of}} {{advances}} in fish farming in Israel. Fresh fish is served whole, in the Mediterranean style, grilled, or fried, dressed only with freshly squeezed lemon juice. Trout (called forel), gilthead seabream (called denisse), St. Peter's fish (known as 'musht') and other fresh fish are prepared this way. Fish are also eaten baked, with or without vegetables, or fried whole or in slices, or grilled over coals, and served with different sauces.|$|E

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sea</b> <b>of</b> Japan zone on Honshu's west coast, {{northwest}} winter winds bring heavy snowfall. In the summer, {{the region}} is cooler than the Pacific area, though it sometimes experiences extremely hot temperatures because of the foehn. The Central Highland has a typical inland humid continental climate, with large temperature differences between summer and winter seasons, as well as large diurnal variation; precipitation is light, though winters are usually snowy. The mountains of the Chūgoku and Shikoku regions shelter the Seto Inland Sea from seasonal winds, bringing mild weather year-round.|$|E
5|$|On 5 February, Mesudiye {{supported}} operations off Şarköy <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sea</b> <b>of</b> Marmara, bombarding Bulgarian {{troops that}} had occupied the town. This {{was the last}} wartime operation conducted by the ship; she {{did not participate in}} the amphibious assault on Şarköy three days later. The Ottoman fleet then spent the remaining months of the war in port, until the armistice ended the conflict in April.|$|E
5|$|The German {{occupation}} of Crimea from May to November 1918 {{did not affect}} the abandoned ship. The Anglo-French forces that replaced the Germans stayed in Sevastopol until April 1919. Before leaving, the British destroyed Rostislavs engines on April 25. The White forces of Baron Wrangel used the disabled ship as a floating battery <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sea</b> <b>of</b> Azov. The ship, manned by a ragtag volunteer crew, was stationed in the shallow waters of the Strait of Kerch to harass the Reds in Taman and prevent a landing in the Crimea. After the defeat of Wrangel's land forces, the crew scuttled Rostislav in the Strait of Kerch to prevent the Red forces from breaking through to the Black Sea.|$|E

5|$|The Shenandoah {{destroyed}} {{one more}} prize <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sea</b> <b>of</b> Okhotsk, north of Japan, then continued to the Aleutians {{and into the}} Bering Sea and Arctic Ocean, crossing the Arctic Circle on June 19. Continuing then south {{along the coast of}} Alaska the Shenandoah came upon a fleet of Union ships whaling on June 22. She opened continuous fire, destroying a major portion of the Union whaling fleet. Capt. Waddell took aim at a fleeing whaler, Sophia Thornton, and at his signal, the gunner jerked a wrist strap and fired the last two shots of the American Civil War. Shenandoah had so far captured and burned eleven ships of the American whaling fleet while in Arctic waters.|$|E

5|$|After {{affecting}} Guam, Chataan continued {{toward the}} northwest and gradually intensified. At 0000UTC on July8, the typhoon {{reached its peak}} intensity of 175km/h (110mph 10-minute sustained) while located near the Japanese island of Okinotorishima. The JTWC assessed that Chataan had reached its peak intensity of 240km/h (150mph 1-minute sustained) about six hours earlier; on that basis, the agency classified {{the system as a}} super typhoon. On July8, Chataan turned toward the north around the subtropical ridge while maintaining its peak winds for about 18hours. On July9 the typhoon turned to the northeast, and late that day it weakened to a severe tropical storm. At around 1530UTC on July10, Chataan made landfall on the Bōsō Peninsula in Honshu with winds of about 100km/h (65mph 10-minute sustained). The storm briefly moved offshore before making a second landfall on eastern Hokkaido at 1200UTC on July11; this marked the first occasion of a July landfall on the island in 28years. A few hours later, Chataan became an extratropical cyclone <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sea</b> <b>of</b> Okhotsk, where the remnants stalled before dissipating on July13 near Sakhalin.|$|E

5|$|After {{the death}} of Manuel I and the {{subsequent}} demise of the Komnenian dynasty in 1185, the navy declined swiftly. The maintenance of galleys and the upkeep of proficient crews were very expensive, and neglect led to a rapid deterioration of the fleet. Already by 1182 the Byzantines had to pay Venetian mercenaries to crew some of their galleys, but in the 1180s, as {{the bulk of the}} Komnenian naval establishment persisted, expeditions of 70–100 ships are still recorded in contemporary sources. Thus Emperor Andronikos I Komnenos (1183–1185) could still gather 100 warships in 1185 to resist and later defeat a Norman fleet <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sea</b> <b>of</b> Marmara. However, the subsequent peace treaty included a clause which required the Normans to furnish a fleet for the Empire. This, together with a similar agreement made by Isaac II Angelos (1185–1195 and 1203–1204) with Venice the next year, in which the Republic would provide 40–100 galleys at six months' notice in exchange for favourable trading concessions, is a telling indication that the Byzantine government was aware of the inadequacy of its own naval establishment.|$|E
5|$|Both ships saw {{extensive}} {{service with}} the Ottoman fleet {{over the course}} of the decade following their arrival in November 1907. They took part in the first fleet maneuver conducted by the fleet in over twenty years in 1909. Neither ship saw action during the Italo-Turkish War of 191112, as Peyk-i Şevket had been interned at British-controlled Suez at the outbreak of war, and Berk-i Satvet was stationed with the reserve fleet <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sea</b> <b>of</b> Marmara, which did not risk confrontation with the significantly stronger Italian fleet. Both ships saw combat during the First Balkan War in 1913, primarily in supporting Ottoman forces ashore in East Thrace. The ships provided gunfire support to the Ottoman army holding the Çatalca line in defense of the capital at Constantinople. Berk-i Satvet also took part in two brief skirmishes with the Greek Navy.|$|E
5|$|During the storm's passage, {{there were}} 61daily {{rainfall}} records broken by Nabi's precipitation across Japan. The rains from Nabi caused significant slope failures and large accumulations of driftwood. The amount of sediment {{displaced by the}} rains was estimated at 4,456m3/km2, over four times the yearly average. A total of 630m3 (2,066ft3) of driftwood was recorded. However, the rainfall also helped to end water restrictions in Kagawa and Tokushima prefectures. In addition to the heavy rainfall, Nabi produced gusty winds on the Japan mainland, peaking at 115km/h (72mph) in Muroto. A station on Tobishima <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sea</b> <b>of</b> Japan recorded a gust of 119km/h (74mph). The typhoon spawned a F1 tornado in Miyazaki, which damaged several buildings. In Wajima, Ishikawa, Nabi produced a Foehn wind, causing temperatures to rise quickly.|$|E
