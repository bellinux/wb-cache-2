40|$|The flat Golgi {{cisterna}} is {{a highly}} conserved feature of eukaryotic cells, but how is this morphology achieved and is it related to its function in cargo sorting and export? A physical model of cisterna morphology led us to propose that sphingomyelin (SM) metabolism at the trans-Golgi membranes in mammalian cells essentially controls the structural features of a Golgi cisterna by regulating its association to curvature-generating proteins. An experimental test of this hypothesis revealed that affecting SM homeostasis converted flat cisternae into <b>highly</b> <b>curled</b> membranes with a concomitant dissociation of membrane curvature-generating proteins. These data lend support to our hypothesis that SM metabolism controls the structural organization of a Golgi cisterna. Together with our previously presented role of SM in controlling the location of proteins involved in glycosylation and vesicle formation, our data reveal the significance of SM metabolism in the structural organization and function of Golgi cisternae.

40|$|In this study, {{we present}} {{analytical}} and experimental investigation of electrically actuated micro cantilever based resonators. These devices are fabricated using polyimide and coated with chrome and gold layers from both sides. The cantilevers are <b>highly</b> <b>curled</b> up due to stress gradient, {{which is a}} common imperfection in surface micro machining. Using a laser Doppler vibrometer, we applied a noise signal to experimentally find the first four resonance frequencies. Then, using a data acquisition card, we swept the excitation frequency around the first four natural modes of vibrations. Theoretically, we derived a reduced order model using the Galerkin method to simulate {{the dynamics of the}} system. Extensive numerical analysis and computations were performed. The numerical analysis was able to provide good matching with experimental values of the resonance frequencies. Also, we proved the ability to excite higher order modes using partial electrodes with shapes that resemble the shape of the mode of interest. Such micro-resonators are shown to be promising for applications in mass and gas sensing...|$|R

50|$|The {{original}} Glengarry pin, affectionately {{known as}} the “stick lady” was designed by a charter Glengarries member, Lynda More. At the same time, she created a companion pin for the men. Both were curling stone stick figures with a U for Utica surrounding the figure. After a few years, the Lynda created a second pin for Glengarries to trade at bonspiels. It is a shield in white, blue, and gold, with a Glengarry hat, crossed brooms, a stone, and a thistle. Mixed <b>curling</b> became a <b>staple</b> of the club, and our famous Mixed Bonspiel was started in 1953, so a mixed pin was created, combining {{the male and female}} heads on a single pin.|$|R
40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of ChemistryDaniel A. HigginsThree {{water-soluble}} perylene diimides (PDIs) {{were investigated}} to examine {{differences in their}} thin film forming properties. The PDI thin films investigated in this thesis are formed in an electrostatic-self-assembled (ESA) layer-by-layer (LBL) process {{by the use of}} a dip coater. The three PDIs employed are sodium bis (sulfonatopropyl) perylene diimide (PDISO[subscript] 3 [superscript] 2 -), bis (trimethylammonioethyl) perylene diimide diiodide (PDIDI[superscript] 2 +), and N-(butoxypropyl) -N'-(2 -(N,N,N-trimethylammonio) -ethyl) perylene- 3, 4, 9, 10 -tetracarboxylic diimide iodide (C[subscript] 7 OPDI[superscript]+). Thin films were made by alternately depositing the PDIs with counter polyelectrolyte (PEs). The PEs employed were poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDDA[superscript]+) and poly(acrylic acid) (PA[superscript]-), depending on the charge of the PDI. PDIs were determined to be aggregated in all three PDI precursor solutions. The fraction of PDI aggregated in each was found to be 0. 972, 0. 903, and 0. 993, for the PDISO[subscript] 3 [superscript] 2 -, PDIDI[superscript] 2 +, and C[subscript] 7 OPDI[superscript]+, respectively. The C[superscript] 7 OPDI[superscript]+ solution was the most aggregated only having one charge group, which makes it more hydrophobic. Thin films prepared from the solutions all displayed an absorbance spectrum similar to the aggregated form. All the composites displayed linear growth in film thickness and fiber width with bilayer number. However, the three composites gave unique surface morphologies. The PDISO[subscript] 3 [supercript] 2 -[dot in middle of line]PDDA+ composite was found to incorporate <b>highly</b> <b>curled</b> intertwined fibers compared to the PDIDI[superscript] 2 +[dot in middle of line]PA[superscript]- composite, where the fibers were not intertwined. The fiber structure was found to change after 15 bilayers. This change in morphology was attributed to the fibers grafting together and overlapping causing the loss of original fiber structure. The two symmetric composites differed in the film thickness with the PDISO[subscript] 3 [superscript] 2 -[dot in middle of line]PDDA[superscript]+ being thicker than the PDIDI[superscript] 2 +[dot in middle of line]PA[superscript]- composite. This was attributed to the molecular weights (MW) of the polyelectrolytes investigated during thin film deposition, with the PDDA[superscript]+ having a much higher MW. C[subscript] 7 OPDI[superscript]+[dot in middle of line]PA[superscript]- thin film composite had a film thickness approximately equal to the PDISO[subscript] 3 [superscript] 2 -[dot in middle of line]PDDA[superscript]+ composite, indicating precursor aggregation also influences deposition rate. The C[subscript] 7 OPDI[superscript]+[dot in middle of line]PA[superscript]- composite incorporated wavy thin fibers that appeared aligned in the dipping direction. This alignment was visible for bulk samples in UV-vis absorption dichroism studies. The alignment was parallel to the dipping direction of the substrate...|$|R
5000|$|Gotland sheep are fine-boned and {{of medium}} size. Gotlands are polled {{and have no}} wool on their black heads and legs. Sometimes there may be white {{markings}} {{on the top of}} the head or around the nose and mouth. They have alert medium-sized ears that stand outwards with a small neat muzzle, an even jaw and even teeth. Their slender neck and shoulders set smoothly into a level back with good depth and reasonable breadth of body. The slender legs are well spaced and upright. The tail is short with a hair-covered tip. The fleece is fine, long, lustrous and dense and can be all shades of grey from silver to charcoal grey and dark enough to be almost black. In the USA [...] "American" [...] Gotlands can also be found in white and moorit (a reddish-brown color). They have a clearly defined even <b>curl</b> (purl) and <b>staple</b> that is soft to the touch. Their disposition is docile and friendly, although older rams can become aggressive. The fleece is typically 29 to 34 micrometres in diameter. Lambswool can be in the low to mid 20s micrometre range. The fleece is prized in the United States by hand-spinners and in Europe they are most desired for their pelts.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} PDE {{had shown}} a pug that qualified for Crufts competition {{was born to}} a Crufts champion with numerous health problems typical in the breed; kneecaps sitting out of their joints, partially collapsed larynx, elongated soft palate, narrowing of nasal cavity, inward rolling of lower eyelids and curvature of the spine. Three Years On also developed considerable airtime to this variety of dog. Breeding for the pug's curled tail {{is thought to be}} the reason for the deformed spine, with breed standard calling for the tail to be [...] "curled as tightly as possible" [...] and [...] "double <b>curl</b> <b>highly</b> desirable". The vertebrae have to be of unusual shapes for the tail to form a corkscrew when fit together. This likely increases the instances of abnormalities elsewhere in the spine, according to Cambridge professor Nick Jeffery. There is currently a breed club screening program for the spine but it is making little progress. The current standard has been softened to state that the tail should be [...] "tightly curled over the hip", but it still notes a double <b>curl</b> to be <b>highly</b> desirable. Muzzle standard has been changed from [...] "short" [...] to [...] "relatively short". The programme states that pugs in show rings are still so flat-faced that the RSPCA started a campaign to highlight issues in brachycephalic (broad and short-faced) breeds.|$|R
