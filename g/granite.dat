40|$|International audienceTwo late Paleozoic, partly {{deformed}} granitic batholiths, the Youngju and Andong <b>granites,</b> regionally {{occur in}} the northeastern Yeongnam Massif. The deformed <b>granites</b> generally occur along the shear zone trending northeast in {{the central part of}} the study area, and their foliations are subparallel to the trend of shear zone, indicating post-emplacement deformation. Both <b>granites</b> belong to tonalite-granodiorite-granite association, but have dominantly granodiorite composition. They have similar chemical features, corresponding to metaluminous, calc-alkaline, I-type, and volcanic arc <b>granites.</b> Most chemical variation trends suggest that mineral fractionation patterns in the two <b>granites</b> should be similar except for the plagioclase fractionation. Relative to the Andong <b>granites,</b> the Youngju <b>granites</b> contain significantly higher FeO, MnO, MgO, K 2 O, Rb, Th, U, Sc, and Pb, and lower Al 2 O 3, Na 2 O, P 2 O 5, TiO 2, Sr, Zr, and Ga. The Youngju <b>granites</b> also have higher K 2 O/Na 2 O, Rb/Sr, and Th/Y ratios, and a lower K/Rb ratio than the Andong <b>granites.</b> The geochemical differences between the two <b>granites</b> are prominent, particularly, in mafic facies. The more incompatible nature of the Youngju <b>granites</b> may be attributed to higher degree of mixing or assimilation with old crustal materials during ascent or emplacement of magma.

40|$|Early Cretaceous A-type <b>granites</b> in the Lower Yangtze River belt, central eastern China, {{with both}} A 1 and A 2 {{chemical}} subgroups, formed at 125 ± 2 Ma, after a Cretaceous ridge subduction. Remarkably, A 1 and A 2 group <b>granites</b> are distributed in three zones, roughly parallel {{to each other}} and to a slightly older adakite belt. In general, A 1 <b>granites</b> form in intraplate settings, whereas A 2 <b>granites</b> near paleo-convergent margins. The alternate distribution of these two subgroup A-type <b>granites</b> is compatible with a proposed Cretaceous ridge subduction in the region. The subduction of a dry and hot spreading ridge may have only released small amount of fluids, so that metasomatism on the overriding lithosphere was undetectable, correspondingly resulted in A 1 <b>granites</b> later on. In contrast, wetter and colder oceanic crust away from the spreading ridge was responsible for mantle metasomatism and consequently the formation of A 2 <b>granites.</b> Further away from the ridge, the subduction angle was much steeper, and dehydration of the slab had occurred earlier during the subduction, and thus dramatically reduced mantle metasomatism, corresponding to A 1 <b>granites</b> again. Both A 1 and A 2 <b>granites</b> formed within a short period of time due to slab window/rollback, after the ridge subduction. The distribution of the A 1 and A 2 <b>granites</b> together with the adakite belt may be taken as discrimination indice for ancient ridge subduction. © 2011 Elsevier B. V.

5|$|It was {{announced}} in November 2016 that pink <b>granite,</b> usually found deep in the Earth's crust, {{had been found in}} drilling samples. It suggests the impact was so great it shocked and melted rocks found deep in the crust, causing them to shoot up before falling back down to produce the peak rings. The <b>granite</b> samples were also found to be lighter and weaker than normal <b>granite,</b> a result of the shock and extreme conditions of the impact. The findings confirmed that the rock comprising the peak ring had originated deep in the earth, and was ejected to the surface. It had been subjected to immense pressures and forces and had been melted by heat and shocked by pressure from its usual state into its present form in just minutes; the fact that the peak ring was made of <b>granite</b> was also significant, since <b>granite</b> is not a rock found in sea-floor deposits, originating much deeper in the earth, and had been ejected to the surface by the immense pressures of impact. Gypsum, a sulfate-containing rock that is usually present in the shallow seabed of the region, had been almost entirely removed and likely vaporized to enter the atmosphere, an event immediately followed by a megatsunami sufficient to lay down the largest known layered bed of sand, around 100 m deep and separated by grain size, directly above the peak ring. These types of sand deposits are caused by extreme water movement, where the larger and heavier sand grains settle first, followed by lighter and smaller grains.|$|E

40|$|Criteria {{that have}} been (and still are) used to {{characterize}} S-type <b>granites</b> of the Lachlan Fold Belt (LFB) of southeastern Australia are reviewed, and comparisons are made with various peraluminous <b>granites</b> of southwestern North America, {{some of which have}} been classified as S-types on the basis of insufficient data. Virtually all of the vast volume of S-type <b>granites</b> in the LFB are near-surface, batholithic <b>granites</b> that are commonly associated with S-type volcanics and are not associated with regional metamorphic rocks and migmatites. They are strongly peraluminous, as shown by the presence of cordierite. <b>Granites</b> with primary muscovite are rare. All are low in Na, Ca, and Sr as a result of chemical weathering during formation of the sedimentary sources. Peraluminous <b>granites</b> of various ages in southwestern North America are distinctly different. They rarely contain cordierite (a mineral characteristic of LFB S-types), but some are highly evolved such that Fe-Mn-rich garnet has crystallized. They are dominantly two-mica <b>granites,</b> indicating crystallization at higher water fugacities and greater depths than most peraluminous <b>granites</b> of the LFB. Cordierite-bearing volcanics (S-types) have not been reported. Sodium is generally high in the peraluminous <b>granites</b> of southwestern North America. Some of these rocks have trondhjemitic affinities; the parent magmas seem {{more likely to have been}} produced by partial melting of altered basaltic rocks. Locally, some peraluminous rocks (marginal to metaluminous types) may owe their compositions to high-level contamination of I-types; these are not S-type rocks. No compelling evidence has been presented that any of the peraluminous <b>granites</b> of southwestern North America are S-types. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractWe {{examined}} the geochronology, petrology, and geochemistry of the two-stage Guikeng pluton, Wuyi Mountain Range, South China, {{with the aim}} of assessing the influence on Indosinian magmatism in South China of collision/amalgamation between the Sibumasu Block and the Indo-China and South China blocks, and between the North China and Yangtze blocks. An additional aim was to summarise the characteristics and geodynamic evolution of Indosinian magmatism in South China. The Guikeng pluton was then compared with the Indosinian Fucheng–Hongshan and Shiwandashan–Darongshan plutons in the Wuyi–Yunkai Mountain Range Belt, two groups of Indosinian <b>granites</b> in Hunan Province (South China Inland Belt), and Indosinian granitoids in the Sulu–South Korea Belt. The Guikeng pluton consists of medium- to fine-grained biotite monzogranites and biotite <b>granites</b> in its marginal belt, medium- to coarse-grained K-feldspar phenocryst-rich biotite <b>granites</b> in its interior part, and late-stage fine-grained muscovite <b>granites.</b> The <b>granites</b> have high Rb, Cs values, (87 Sr/ 86 Sr) i, and Rb/Sr ratios, low Sr, Ba, and εNd(t) values, and slightly to moderately negative Eu anomalies. These geochemical characteristics suggest that the <b>granites</b> were derived from late Paleo-proterozoic meta-sedimentary basement (1. 7 – 2. 0 Ga). The rocks of the marginal belt and {{the main part of the}} pluton originated from two distinct magma sources. The fine-grained muscovite <b>granites</b> were produced by intensive differentiation of K-feldspar phenocryst-rich biotite <b>granites.</b> The <b>granites</b> from the marginal belt and the main part of the pluton yield SHRIMP U–Pb zircon ages of 234 ± 3 and 220. 4 ± 3 Ma, respectively, consistent with early and late Indosinian magmatism in South China. The early Indosinian metaluminous to weakly peraluminous foliated biotite <b>granites</b> were formed in a collision/compressional setting, whereas late Indosinian strongly peraluminous massive <b>granites</b> were formed in a post-collision setting. The rock assemblage, source region of Indosinian <b>granites,</b> and tectonic setting differ between South China and Sulu–South Korea, indicating the metamorphic basement of the Ogcheon Metamorphic Belt in North China is different to that of the Nanhua Rift in South China...|$|R

40|$|Granitic rocks {{can have}} {{a wide range of}} sources, over all parts of the {{spectrum}} from pure mantle to pure crust. These sources show a significant correlation with tectonic setting. <b>Granites</b> from ocean ridges usually have characteristics that indicate depleted mantle sources. <b>Granites</b> in volcanic arcs usually have depleted mantle sources modified by a component from subducted oceanic crust and sediment. <b>Granites</b> from intraplate settings usually show evidence of enriched mantle (lithosphere andlor asthenosphere) sources together with rare crustal melts. <b>Granites</b> from syn-collision settings are usually characterised by pure crustal sources or by mantle sources containing large subducted crustal components. <b>Granites</b> from post-collision settings usually carry signs of enriched lithospheric mantle sources together with rare crustal melts.

40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>Granites</b> {{and related}} {{volcanic}} rocks of the Lachlan Fold Belt can be grouped into suites using chemical and petrographic data. The distinctive characteristics of suites reflect source-rock features. The first-order subdivision within the suites is between those derived from igneous and from sedimentary source rocks, the I- and S-types. Differences {{between the two}} types of source rocks and their derived <b>granites</b> are due to the sedimentary source material having been previously weathered at the Earth's surface. Chemically, the S-type <b>granites</b> are lower in Na, Ca, Sr and Fe 3 +/Fe 2 +, and higher in Cr and Ni. As a consequence, the S-types are always peraluminous and contain Al-rich minerals. A little over 50 % of the I-type <b>granites</b> are metaluminous and these more mafic rocks contain hornblende. In the absence of associated mafic rocks, the more felsic and slightly peraluminous I-type <b>granites</b> may be difficult to distinguish from felsic S-type <b>granites.</b> This overlap in composition is to be expected and results from the restricted chemical composition of the lowest temperature felsic melts. The composi-tions of more mafic I- and S-type <b>granites</b> diverge, {{as a result of the}} incorporation of more mafic components from the source, either as restite or a component of higher temperature melt. There is no overlap in composition between the most mafic I- and S-type <b>granites,</b> whose composition...|$|R
