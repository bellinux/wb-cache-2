40|$|Note: Some pages out of order. The {{well-known}} {{regulation of}} the electrolyte balance by the adrenal cortex {{has been attributed to}} its secretion of a hormone similar to, if not identical with, <b>desoxycorticosterone.</b> A deficiency of adrenocortical hormone lowers both serum chloride and sodium, and elevates potassium. Therapy with <b>desoxycorticosterone</b> rapidly restores these electrolyte levels to normal by markedly increasing the retention of sodium and chloride and reducing the renal retention of potassium. Therefore it seemed paradoxical to find that large doses of <b>desoxycorticosterone</b> acetate (DCA) can lower the serum chloride of both normal and adrenalectomized animals. At the outset of this research, the problem was to determine the mechanism by which DCA produced this hypochloremia, which has been observed by several investigators. It seemed probable that it was an overdosage effect related to the loss of potassium produced by DCA, and that this steroid must increase the urine chloride excretion, contrary to the available information indicating that it produces chloride retention.

Progesterone and <b>desoxycorticosterone</b> stimulate P-gp ATPase activity with, respectively, apparent concentrations giving half-maximal activation of 20 - 25 microM and 40 - 50 microM, and activation factors of 2. 3 (at 100 microM progesterone) and 1. 8 (at 170 microM <b>desoxycorticosterone).</b> Hydrocortisone above 100 microM stimulates P-gp ATPase activity while corticosterone has no apparent stimulating effect.

A similar non-competitive inhibition of progesterone-stimulated P-gp ATPase activity by <b>desoxycorticosterone</b> or by corticosterone leads to the conclusion that these steroids, although sharing related structures, have distinct modulating sites on P-gp. As expected from their mutually non-exclusive interactions on P-gp, progesterone and verapamil when mixed induce a synergistic modulation of P-gp ATPase activity.

40|$|Recent {{findings}} suggest {{an important role}} of the sodium ion, intracellularly deposited by the adrenal mineralocorticoids, as the physicochemical mediator between the pressor actions of the mineralocorticoids and of the adrenosympathogenic neurohormones. The following observations show that the pressor effectiveness of both the pressor neurohormones and <b>desoxycorticosterone</b> acetate depends {{on the availability of}} sodium. This supports the theory that vascular pressor re-sponsiveness and tonus is determined jointly by the sodium-depositing corticoids as sensitizers and the adrenosympathogenic neurohormones as the physiologic stimulators of the vascular con-tractile elements. AN IMPORTANT role of the local action of electrolytes in the main-tenance of vascular tone was postulated by Loebl and Swingle 2 10 years ago.

Averaged flowing lymph volume on 25 sound dogs at 10 minutes from the thoracic duct-fistle formation was 3. 5 cc, total protein nitrogen 511 mg, albumin nitrogen 266 mg/ 100 cc, globulin nitrogen 171 mg/ 100 cc, A/G ratio 1. 35, fibrinogen nitrogen 33 mg/ 100 cc, and non-protein nitrogen was 31 mg/ 100 cc. 2. Administration of allyl formate brought an increase on flowing lymph volume and total protein contents, and the increase was apparent on albumin fraction in the early stage and on globulin fraction in the end stadium. A/G ratio, therefore, increased temporally in the early stage, and afterward the value reduced gradually to reach below that before the administration of allyl formate. Both fibrinogen and non-protein nitrogen increased. These results may suggest that allyl formate brings serous inflammatory process. 3. Administration of Syncorta, a preparate of <b>desoxycorticosterone</b> acetate, brought inhibition of increases of thoracic duct lymph volume and total protein volume, decrease of A/G ratio, and increase of fibrinogen on the allyl fomate-administered dog.

40|$|After the {{synthesis}} of <b>desoxycorticosterone</b> (DOC), {{it became apparent that}} this cortico-steroid, the physiological effects of which are con-cerned primarily with sodium and potassium me-tabolism, can produce a state of hypertension both in animals and in man (1, 2). The induced hy-pertension is dependent upon the administration of adequate amounts of dietary sodium, whereas the hypertensive state, produced by administra-tion of glucocorticoids such as cortisone, differs in that it is independent of the dietary sodium content (3). More recently, following the chemical and bio-logical characterization of the mineralocorticoid hormone, aldosterone (4), a disease state associ-ated with primary hypersecretion of this hormone has been described in man (5). Aldosterone pro-duces effects on sodium and potassium metabolism similar to those of <b>desoxycorticosterone,</b> and the clinical syndrome of primary aldosteronism re-sembles the disease state produced by chronic ad-ministration of DOC to dogs (6). Arterial hy-pertension has been a consistent finding in pa-tients with primary hyperaldosteronism. A number of other observations have suggested a relationship between the dietary sodium intake and the blood pressure level of patients with pri-mary (benign essential) hypertension. The bene-ficial effects of sodium deprivation, and of various natriuretic agents in certain patients with hyper-tension, is well known.

40|$|SUMMARY Hemodynamic {{variables}} were measured in 20 young pigs; thirteen received subcutaneous im-plantations of <b>desoxycorticosterone</b> acetate (DOCA) impregnated in Sllastic strips, seven received implants of Silastic strips alone {{and served as}} controls. No salt {{was added to the}} standard diet of either group. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) rose in a regular pattern in the DOCA-treated pigs, reaching on the average a level significantly greater than that of the control group 48 hours after the implantation. Pressure continued to rise, reaching a plateau 38 % above tbat of the preimpiant value 2 weeks later. In some pigs the MAP elevation was caused by an increase in cardiac output (CO); in others it was caused by an increase in total peripheral resistance (TPR). An increase in central venous pressure occurred in many DOCA-treated pigs regardless of whether the increase in MAP was caused by an increase in CO or in TPR. The results indicate that it is arterial pressure per se that is the regulated variable in this model of mineralocorticoid hypertension.

To explore this question, the renal vascular responses (RVR) to intrarenal injections of subpressor doses of AII and norepinephrine were studied in dogs with an electromagnetic flowmeter. Acute and chronic sodium depletion increased plasma renin activity (PRA) and blunted the RVR to AII, while acute sodium repletion and chronic sodium excess plus <b>desoxycorticosterone</b> acetate decreased PRA and enhanced the RVR to AII. The magnitude of the RVR to AII was inversely related to PRA. The RVR to norepinephrine was unaffected by sodium balance and {{was not related to}} PRA. Inhibition of the conversion of angiotensin I to AII by SQ 20, 881 during sodium depletion lowered mean arterial blood pressure (MABP), increased renal blood flow (RBF), and enhanced the RVR to AII but not to norepinephrine. Administration of bradykinin to chronically sodium-depleted dogs also lowered the MABP and increased RBF but had no effect on the RVR to AII. SQ 20, 881 had no effect on MABP, RBF, or the RVR to AII in the dogs with chronic sodium excess and <b>desoxycorticosterone</b> acetate.

The data did not suggest that the variations in the RVR to AII were because of direct effects of sodium on vascular contraction, changes in the number of vascular AII receptors, or the renal prostaglandins.
