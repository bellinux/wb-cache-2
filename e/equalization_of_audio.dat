50|$|More generally, {{some forms}} of lossy {{compression}} {{can be thought of}} as an application of transform coding - in the case of multimedia data, perceptual coding: it transforms the raw data to a domain that more accurately reflects the information content. For example, rather than expressing a sound file as the amplitude levels over time, one may express it as the frequency spectrum over time, which corresponds more accurately to human audio perception. While data reduction (compression, be it lossy or lossless) is a main goal of transform coding, it also allows other goals: one may represent data more accurately for the original amount of space - for example, in principle, if one starts with an analog or high-resolution digital master, an MP3 file of a given size should provide a better representation than a raw uncompressed audio in WAV or AIFF file of the same size. This is because uncompressed audio can only reduce file size by lowering bit rate or depth, whereas compressing audio can reduce size while maintaining bit rate and depth. This compression becomes a selective loss of the least significant data, rather than losing data across the board. Further, a transform coding may provide a better domain for manipulating or otherwise editing the data - for example, <b>equalization</b> <b>of</b> <b>audio</b> is most naturally expressed in the frequency domain (boost the bass, for instance) rather than in the raw time domain.|$|E

It boasted a significantly different algorithm included into the FFT-based continuous noise filter called [...] "Artifact Suppression" [...] mode. The new algorithm reportedly reduced the aliasing and artifacting that often accompanies noise reduction with such filters. Of equal significance was {{the introduction of a}} simple Virtual Phono Preamp for accurate and simplified <b>equalization</b> <b>of</b> almost any record format. Another milestone was the development and inclusion of an [...] "EZ Enhancer" [...] filter which simplified the otherwise difficult process of sound enhancement that often follows the noise reduction process. DC-7 also introduced a simple [...] "Tune Library" [...] which allowed a user to catalogue the progression and restoration <b>of</b> <b>audio</b> files in a database style view. Somewhere along the line it was also decided to include the Spectrogram View previously only found in the DC-Forensics range with the basic audio restoration/Live software version to aid in manual impulse noise removal and other challenging operations. Together, these changes provided very successful and popular in the field <b>of</b> <b>audio</b> restoration tools and was likened to the transition [...] "from regular television to High Definition".|$|R

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a criterion to assess <b>equalization</b> <b>of</b> opportunity {{that is consistent}} with theoretical views of equality of opportunity. We characterize inequality of opportunity as a situation where some groups in society enjoy an illegitimate advantage. In this context, <b>equalization</b> <b>of</b> opportunity requires that the extent of the illegitimate advantage enjoyed by the privileged groups falls. Robustness requires that this judgement be supported by the broadest class of individual preferences. We formalize this criterion in a decision theoretic framework, and derive an empirical condition for <b>equalization</b> <b>of</b> opportunity based on observed opportunity distributions. The criterion is used to assess the effectiveness of child care at equalizing opportunity among children, using quantile treatment effects estimates of a major child care reform in Norway...|$|R

Finally, the problem of common law did not lie in the <b>equalization</b> <b>of</b> the mentioned contracts, but rather in the absence of depositum irregulare contracts applied to monetary questions...|$|R
