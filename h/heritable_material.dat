In this study we test the hypothesis that heat shock treatment of rainbow trout eggs, activated with UV irradiated sperms, leads to the generation of a uniform populations of diploid gynogenetic females. Activation of fertilized eggs with UV irradiated semen, by heat shock at 27. 5 °C for 10 min. directly after fertilization induces diploid gynogenesis. Diploid individuals are obtained {{at a rate of}} 73. 33 %. Triploid individuals are obtained at a rate of 26. 67 %.

40|$|Vertical {{transmission}} of <b>heritable</b> <b>material,</b> {{a cornerstone of}} the Darwinian theory of evolution, is inadequate to describe the evolution of eukaryotes, particularly microbial eukaryotes. This is because eukaryotic cells and eukaryotic genomes are chimeric, having evolved {{through a combination of}} vertical (parent to offspring) and lateral (trans-species) transmission. Observations on widespread chimerism in eukaryotes have led to new and revised hypothesis for the origin and diversification of eukaryotes that provide specific predictions on the tempo (early vs continuous transfers) and mode (nature of donor and recipient lineages) of lateral gene transfers (LGTs). Analyses of available data indicate that LGTs in eukaryotes largely fall into two categories: (1) LGTs from organelles to the nucleus, only a few of which appear to have occurred {{at the time of the}} origin of eukaryotes, and (2) anomalous LGTs involving diverse donor and recipient lineages. Further testing of hypotheses on the origin and diversification of eukaryotes will require complete genome sequences from a number of diverse eukaryotes and prokaryotes combined with sequences of targeted genes from a broad phylogenetic sample...|$|E

50|$|Genetic {{engineering}} {{is a process}} that alters the genetic make-up of an organism by either removing or introducing DNA. DNA can be introduced directly into the host organism or into a cell that is then fused or hybridized with the host.

They provide {{goods and services}} which {{are essential to the}} survival and well-being of all humanity. Forest genetic resources – the <b>heritable</b> <b>materials</b> maintained within and among tree and other woody plant species that are of actual or potential economic, environmental, scientific or societal value – are essential for the continued productivity, services, adaptation and evolutionary processes of forests and trees. This first volume of The State of the World’s Forest Genetic Resources constitutes a major step in building the information and knowledge base required for action towards better conservation and sustainable management of forest genetic resources at the national, regional and international levels. The publication was prepared based on information provided by 86 countries, outcomes from regional and subregional consultations and commissioned thematic studies. It presents definitions and concepts related to forest genetic resources and a review of their value; the main drivers of changes and the trends affecting these vital resources; and key emerging technologies. The central section analyses the current status of conservation and use of forest genetic resources on the basis of reports provided by the countries. The book concludes with recommendations for ensuring that present and future generations continue to benefit from forests and trees, both through innovations in practices and technologies and through enhanced attention to forest genetic resources at the institutional and policy level...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: A {{fundamental}} {{concept in}} biology is that <b>heritable</b> <b>material,</b> DNA, is passed from parent to offspring, {{a process called}} vertical gene transfer. An alternative mechanism of gene acquisition is through horizontal gene transfer (HGT), which involves movement of genetic material between different species. HGT is well-known in single-celled organisms such as bacteria, but its existence in higher organisms, including animals, is less well established, and is controversial in humans. RESULTS: We {{have taken advantage of}} the recent availability of a sufficient number of high-quality genomes and associated transcriptomes to carry out a detailed examination of HGT in 26 animal species (10 primates, 12 flies and four nematodes) and a simplified analysis in a further 14 vertebrates. Genome-wide comparative and phylogenetic analyses show that HGT in animals typically gives rise to tens or hundreds of active 'foreign' genes, largely concerned with metabolism. Our analyses suggest that while fruit flies and nematodes have continued to acquire foreign genes throughout their evolution, humans and other primates have gained relatively few since their common ancestor. We also resolve the controversy surrounding previous evidence of HGT in humans and provide at least 33 new examples of horizontally acquired genes. CONCLUSIONS: We argue that HGT has occurred, and continues to occur, on a previously unsuspected scale in metazoans and is likely to have contributed to biochemical diversification during animal evolution...|$|E
40|$|The size {{constraints}} of the nucleus necessitate condensation of eukaryotic DNA into chromatin. The fundamental subunit of chromatin is the nucleosome, ~ 147 bp of DNA wound about the histone octamer. Each octamer typically contains two copies each of the canonical histones H 2 A, H 2 B, H 3 and H 4. However, packaging DNA limits its availability to enzymes necessary for the maintenance and expression of our <b>heritable</b> <b>material.</b> More precisely, all chromatin-dependent processes [...] transcription, replication, recombination, and repair [...] {{are affected by the}} position and occupancy of nucleosomes. Given the transcriptional challenges inherent to DNA packaging, this dissertation documents studies aimed at addressing this fundamental question: How does a cell modify chromatin to achieve proper gene expression? To this end, I pursued functional studies in S. cerevisiae of a potential chromatin modifier, Yta 7, and a novel chromatin modification, H 2 A. Z acetylation. My studies on Yta 7, a conserved bromodomain-containing protein with AAA-ATPase homology, identified this protein as a novel regulator of histone H 3 eviction or degradation. Cells lacking Yta 7 exhibited both increased levels of chromatin-incorporated histone H 3 and decreased nucleosome spacing. Importantly, this modulation of H 3 levels occurred post-transcriptionally. The yta 7 &# 916; mutant's transcriptional defects were partially suppressed by decreased dosage of histones H 3 and H 4, indicating the transcriptional impact of this increased nucleosome density. Additionally, Yta 7 associated with inducible genes only upon transcriptional activation, with prominent enrichment within open reading frames. Yta 7 and its ATPase function were required for the proper induction of these genes. Further, loss of local Yta 7 activity resulted in a 5 ' to 3 ' gradient of H 3 accumulation within a large open reading frame upon transcriptional activation, indicating a direct requirement for Yta 7 's regulation of H 3 levels at that gene. In support of a direct mechanism of histone eviction or degradation by Yta 7, Yta 7 directly interacts with histone H 3 in vitro. Further, over-expressing Yta 7 resulted in a ~ 65 % decrease in levels of chromatin-bound H 3, as assayed by chromatin immunoprecipitation. Taken together, my studies support a model in which Yta 7 utilizes the energy released upon ATP hydrolysis to evict and/or facilitate the degradation of histone H 3. As bulk chromatin from cells without Yta 7 exhibited increased nucleosome density and decreased dosage of either H 3 or H 4 suppresses the growth defect of the yta 7 &# 916; mutant, Yta 7 presumably evicts or degrades an H 3 /H 4 dimer or tetramer. Thus, these studies identified a protein that limited the extent of DNA packaging, thereby facilitating RNA polymerase activity upon transcription. Restricting nucleosome density represents one mechanism for enabling transcriptional activation. Another possible mechanism is modifying the nucleosomes themselves, by covalently modifying the incorporated histones or changing which histones are incorporated. Although nucleosomes typically contain two copies of each canonical histone, histone variants, such as H 2 A. Z and H 3. 3, can be substituted at specific genomic locations for their cognate canonical histone. The histone H 2 A variant H 2 A. Z is conserved and essential in all multicellular eukaryotes assayed. Yeast cells lacking H 2 A. Z exhibit a broad range of chromatin-based phenotypes, including defective gene induction, genomic instability, and spreading of the Sir-silencing complex from heterochromatin into euchromatic domains. However, the importance of its N-terminal tail acetylations to these functions remained unclear. Therefore, I undertook studies to determine the genome-wide requirements for H 2 A. Z acetylation, assess the role of individual acetylation sites and identify which proteins might interpret these modifications. My work on H 2 A. Z acetylation indicated that the transcriptome of cells lacking H 2 A. Z acetylation exhibited fewer expression defects than cells lacking H 2 A. Z. In contrast to proposed roles in transcriptional activation, cells lacking H 2 A. Z acetylation exhibited a bias toward up-regulation of genes. Genes that were down-regulated in these cells, however, were highly enriched for telomere-adjacent genes, consistent with Sir silencing antagonism or altered telomeric structure. In keeping with more recent work, my data supported a model of acetylation-site equivalence and additive activity of H 2 A. Z acetylation. Additionally, this work identified the double bromodomain-containing TFIID-associated Bdf 1 as interacting with H 2 A. Z in an acetylation-dependent manner in vivo. As Bdf 1 is required to inhibit Sir-complex spreading from the telomeres, this work provides insight into the potential mechanism of Bdf 1 's Sir complex antagonism. Further work will have to be performed to determine if the down-regulation of telomere-adjacent genes in cells that cannot acetylate H 2 A. Z is Sir-dependent and whether these genes' requirement for acetylated H 2 A. Z is a direct one. However, these studies on H 2 A. Z acetylation are consistent with a model in which H 2 A. Z acetylation prevents chromatin condensation by the Sir proteins, an alternative mechanism for maintaining proper gene expression...|$|E
40|$|Genetic {{homeostasis}} was {{studied in}} different maize (Zea mays L.) genotypes and populations {{to determine whether}} selection has affected homeostasis and to determine whether homeostasis is <b>heritable.</b> The maize <b>materials</b> included one group of six inbred lines released before the 1960 s (older lines), and another group of six inbred lines released after the 1970 s (newer lines). Within each group, single cross, F 2, and backcross generations were developed. The experiments were conducted at two Iowa locations in 1985 and 1986. Individual plant measurements were taken for eight maize traits: yield, ear length, ear diameter, kernel-row number, kernel depth, plant and ear height, and number of tassel branches. The objectives {{of this study were}} to compare genetic homeostasis of the older versus the newer maize lines to determine whether selection of newer lines has changed the levels homeostasis and to study whether the homeostatic effects are transmitted from the inbred lines to their single cross, FI, and backcross generations;Estimates of genetic homeostasis were obtained using the proportion of the environmental variance contained in the within-plot variance. The significance and magnitude of the genotype x environment interaction mean squares and the coefficient of variation were also used as preliminary estimates of homeostasis. The coefficient of variation, however, was not a good estimator because it had a negative and highly significant correlation with the mean. Genetic homeostasis depended on the level of heterogeneity and heterozygosity of the maize genotypes and populations. The homogeneous and homozygous inbred lines were the least homeostatic. The homogeneous and heterozygous single crosses exhibited good homeostasis. The F 2 and backcross generations (heterogeneous and 50 % heterozygous) expressed similar homeostasis among them, and better homeostasis than the single crosses;The newer lines were more homeostatic than the older lines. The inbred lines were consistent in transmitting in a heritable manner the homeostatic effects, either good or bad, to their single cross, F 2, and backcross generations. In most instances, the eight traits measured followed the same tendency in all comparisons among generations within both groups. Kernel depth, however, did not have a regular pattern of transmission of the homeostatic effects across generations...|$|R
