The recent emergence of quasi- 2 D monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) provide ideal systems to explore the EHL state since <b>ineffective</b> <b>screening</b> of the out of plane field lines in these quasi- 2 D systems allows for stronger charge carrier correlations in contrast to conventional 3 D bulk semiconductors and enabling the existence of the EHL at high temperatures.

As with all tasks, there are ways to approach this task that will facilitate performance and other approaches that will degrade performance, either by increasing errors or by unnecessarily prolonging the process. A clearer understanding of psychological factors influencing the effectiveness of footage review will facilitate future training in best practice with respect to the review of CCTV footage. The goal of this report is to provide such understanding by reviewing research on footage review, research on related tasks that require similar skills, and experimental laboratory research about the cognitive skills underpinning the task. The report is organised to address five challenges to effectiveness of CCTV review: the effects of the degraded nature of CCTV footage, distractions and interrupts, the length of the task, inappropriate mindset, and variability in people’s abilities and experience. Recommendations for optimising CCTV footage review include (1) doing a cognitive task analysis to increase understanding {{of the ways in which}} performance might be limited, (2) exploiting technology advances to maximise the perceptual quality of the footage (3) training people to improve the flexibility of their mindset as they perceive and interpret the images seen, (4) monitoring performance either on an ongoing basis, by using psychophysiological measures of alertness, or periodically, by testing screeners’ ability to find evidence in footage developed for such testing, and (5) evaluating the relevance of possible selection tests to <b>screen</b> effective from <b>ineffective</b> <b>screener...</b>|$|R

We propose and estimate a Bayesian learning model of tariff and usage choice that explains this “flat-rate bias” without relying on behavioral misjudgments or tariff-specific preferences.

Aggregate uncertainty inflates prior variances causing consumers to heavily weight private signals. Consumers with high posteriors are therefore overly optimistic. Although posteriors are unbiased across products, this productlevel bias conditional on one’s posterior (i. e., “conditional bias”) arises for each product, thereby explaining the flat-rate bias. The consequences of conditional bias are exacerbated by switching costs that deter consumers from changing tariffs after updating their beliefs.

These athletes were found to have either partial or full androgen insensitivity, despite having an SRY gene, making them phenotypically female and giving them no advantage over other female competitors.

40|$|Although {{ultrasound}} has so {{far been}} found to be <b>ineffective</b> as a <b>screening</b> tool for ovarian cancer, it is commonly used as a means of evaluating or following ovarian or adnexal masses once they are detected. We review the use of serial ultrasound for the management of adnexal masses and propose an approach to monitoring based on an understanding of the overall risk of cancer among the population in question and an assessment of how the potential benefit of monitoring compares with potential risk. In our approach, masses that are symptomatic, large (> 10 cm), associated with an elevated CA 125 level or overt signs of malignancy, or that are determined to have a worrisome appearance by stringent ultrasound criteria should be evaluated surgically. Women with masses that have none of these characteristics should be offered monitoring. Short-term initial ultrasound monitoring carries significant potential benefit in terms of aiding detection of early malignancy and avoidance of unnecessary surgery. However, if a mass remains stable but persistent, the potential benefit of ongoing monitoring wanes with time, whereas the potential harms, in terms of patient anxiety, cost and the risk of incidental findings and unnecessary surgery increase. Therefore, monitoring of stable lesions should be limited in duration in order to limit potential harms from overtreatment and overdiagnosis...|$|R

We show that this latter uncertainty inflates prior variances, which leads consumers to weight their private signals more heavily when updating beliefs. Posteriors are unbiased across products.

Methodology: Six-hundred and eighty-five children aged 4 – 5 years from a Metropolitan area of Adelaide, Australia, were enrolled. Each parent completed a questionnaire aimed at detecting parental concerns about hearing impairment. Screening audiometry was then performed. Children who failed the initial audiometry screening underwent repeat audiometry screening 6 – 8 weeks later. The audiometry and questionnaire data were then compared. Results: Of the 657 children who successfully completed initial audiometry, 544 (83 %) passed and 113 (17 %) failed. Of the 84 children who had follow-up audiometry, 64 (76 %) passed. Parental concerns were identified on questionnaire in 50 % of all children. Neither individual questions nor the number of concerns were found to relate to audiometry results.

40|$|Background/Rationale The {{prevalence}} {{of mental health}} issues in prison populations is exacerbated by <b>ineffective</b> <b>screening</b> for mental illness during earlier contact with {{the criminal justice system}} (CJS). Effective screening is reliant on cooperation between the CJS and mental health services. Interagency working has proved difficult in the past as might be expected of working between public services so distinct in expectations, priorities and working culture. Poor interprofessional working leads to court proceedings and public safety being compromised. Further, mentally disordered defendants face inappropriate imprisonment and fail to access community support/treatment. The aim of work is to explore the nature of interprofessional working at the interface of working between the CJS and the mental health services. Methods Data was collected through a cross sectional survey of court (n= 479) and mental health workers (n= 146). Results Attitudes towards defendants and willingness to work across agencies were comparable across agencies. Procedural expectations varied as did awareness, feelings of efficacy and levels of training that supports better interagency working. Conclusions We discuss the implication of findings for future interprofessional training needs of both court and mental health services. We compare and contrast these with current interprofessional education whose focus is almost exclusively on relationships between health and social care professionals...|$|E

It {{predominantly}} occurs in two histological types, ie, squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma, each with its own distinct geographical distribution and natural history. The incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma is rising, as is that of its precursor lesion, Barrett&# 39;s esophagus, which consists of metaplastic change in the squamous mucosa of the esophagus in response to damage by gastroesophageal reflux disease. The principal risk factors for esophageal cancer are cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption, reflux disease, and obesity. In tumors without local invasion or distant metastases, surgery remains the treatment option of choice, although there are considerable differences of opinion regarding the roles of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. A wide variety of endoscopic treatments are available for dysplastic lesions and palliation. Despite the availability of increasingly complex imaging modalities and expensive and possibly <b>ineffective</b> attempts at <b>screening,</b> the evidence base is conflicted and the prognosis remains poor.

40|$|Over {{the past}} several decades alarmist reports about the {{supposed}} dangers of the sexualised nature of much Japanese popular culture have regularly featured in the English-language press. It has been claimed that Japan is 2 ̆ 7 awash 2 ̆ 7 in all kinds of pornography, including child pornography (Larimer 1999; Fallows 1986 : 38) and that insufficient attempts are made by the authorities to properly regulate the expression of sexual matters. A major concern of such reporting has been the supposed 2 ̆ 7 dark side 2 ̆ 7 (McGinty 2002) of the manga (comics) which are ubiquitous in Japan and, since the 1980 s, have become popular with young people worldwide. International childprotection agencies, including such bodies as UNICEF, have argued that Japan 2 ̆ 7 s classification systems, which tend to be self-regulated by various culture industries as opposed to enforced by government-appointed bodies, are <b>ineffective</b> in <b>screening</b> out representations of sex and violence that are 2 ̆ 7 harmful to youth 2 ̆ 7 (McLelland 2011). One problem with this kind of media discourse is that it assumes there are universal standards or agreement over the meaning of contentious terms such as 2 ̆ 7 pornography 2 ̆ 7 or 2 ̆ 7 obscenity 2 ̆ 7. As Anne Allison has pointed out, Anglophone discussions of pornography have largely overlooked standards and practices concerning the regulation of sexual expression in non-Western countries; or, when they are attended to, {{as in the case of}} Japan, 2 ̆ 7 practices and texts involving the representation, alteration and aestheticisation of bodies have been judged by western (or universalist) standards 2 ̆ 7 (2000 : 54). Allison calls for the need to 2 ̆ 7 foreground the local context 2 ̆ 7 when analysing the genres of pornography available, as well as attending to their users. In this chapter I offer a historical overview of the regulation of sexual content primarily in relation to the Japanese print media. Through attending to a few specific case studies that have not been discussed in English, I show that a range of Japanese authorities, particularly the police, have exercised a great deal of scrutiny over sexual expression.

40|$|The {{survival}} rate {{of patients with}} ovarian cancer is over 90 % in Stages I and II but detection strategies based on CA 125 testing are <b>ineffective.</b> Hence, this <b>screening</b> approach not only fails to decrease ovarian cancer mortality but also causes significant harm including major surgery in cancer free women. Fortunately, the metrics of ultrasound-based techniques are encouraging—a recent large scale trial of over 200, 000 women indicated that the sensitivity and specificity were 89. 4 % and 99. 8 %, respectively, when combined with CA 125 tests. However, the positive predictive value of ovarian cancer was only 43. 3 %. Therefore, we hypothesize that using photoacoustic ultrasoundcombined with lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles can achieve advances in specificity and sensitivity that are need in population-wide studies. In our study, we used poly-lacticco- glutamic acid (PLGA), lecithin, and 1, 2 -distearoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphoethanolamine-N-[folate(polyethylene glycol) ]- 5000 (DSPE-PEG-folate) to fabricate hybrid nanoparticles. The photoacoustic imaging agents DiR or IR- 1061 were encapsulated in PLGA hydrophobic core. The folate-functionalized nanoparticles can actively target HeLa cells which overexpress folate receptors on their cell membrane. The main hypothesis is that the folate-functionalized nanoparticles could produce highercontrast between ovarian cancer tissues and normal tissues than nanoparticles without folate modification. Also, we proved our IR- 1061 -loaded nanoparticles had a pH-responsive release profile. We can even use photoacoustic imaging to track the releasingIR- 1061 in PBS at different pH values. In the future, we attempt to conjugate IR- 1061 molecules with anti-cancer drugs to endow our nanoparticles theranostic capability.

40|$|Introduction: In the {{traditional}} model of care, an annual visit {{was dedicated to}} the task of assessing and delivering preventive care. With the move away from annual physicals, primary care physicians are addressing preventive services at every clinic visit often aided by electronic clinical decision support (CDS) systems. Methods: We conducted a case study of a visit-driven CDS system in use at a primary care clinic. Steady-state performance was assessed via control charts of quality metrics, data regarding completion of recommendations, and an analysis of screening intervals achieved with patient visits. Results: Under this visit-driven CDS system, quality metric performance was poor and declining. Almost half of the patients were not screened (46. 5 %), and the other half were overscreened the majority of the time (83. 3 %). Recommended preventive services were ordered less than half the time (42. 6 %), despite CDS reminders. Discussion: Various barriers and systematic inefficiencies combined to produce <b>ineffective</b> <b>screening</b> in this visit-driven CDS preventive service delivery system. As a result, we conclude a visit-driven system cannot produce optimal results. In order to improve performance, preventive services should be delivered separately from clinical visits, perhaps by a “preventive service ranger” (PSR) utilizing the CDS system to review each patient once annually. Under such a system, patients would receive preventive services in an organized and efficient fashion, potentially leading to better continuity, higher quality metrics that are mathematically predictable, and improved satisfaction...|$|E
40|$|Endometrial {{cancer is}} the most common {{gynecologic}} cancer with 54, 870 cases occurring in the United States in 2015 and causing 10, 170 deaths, an 18. 5 % mortality rate (Elit and Reade, 2015). Ovarian cancer, while less common, is much more fatal. In 2015 in the United States, 21, 290 cases occurred and resulted in 14, 180 deaths, a 66. 6 % mortality rate. This mortality rate makes ovarian cancer the fifth most deadly cancer for women in the United States, which is largely explained by <b>ineffective</b> <b>screening</b> strategies and limited treatment possibilities (Cramer, 2012). Thus, developing effective prevention strategies is especially important to saving the lives of women who will develop ovarian or endometrial cancer.

However, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) does not currently recommend taking COCs for the prevention gynecologic cancer (CDC, 2014 a). Since the efficacy of COCs for reducing risk of ovarian and endometrial cancer is well established, guidelines need to be determined for populations of women that should take hormonal birth control to minimize cancer risk.

Until recently, this has been available {{as part of the}} UK Familial Ovarian Cancer Screening Study (UKFOCSS), using ultrasound scans of the ovaries and tumour marker blood tests. The present study aimed to gain an in-depth understanding of women's experiences of participating in ovarian cancer screening. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 48 UKFOCSS participants. Interviews were recorded, transcribed and relevant sections analysed using a framework approach. Results: Screening provided women with reassurance which they found beneficial. A sense of privilege, as well as feeling proactive in potentially detecting ovarian cancer at an early stage was described. The wider benefit to research and the potential impact this could have on others was also important to women. Negative experiences of screening included worry about the screening tests and results, false reassurance by test results and disappointment with <b>ineffective</b> <b>screening.</b> Aspects of the screening study, such as the logistics, organisation and communication, were described as both good and problematic. When weighed up by the women, most described an overall positive experience of screening. Conclusions: Women reported both positive and negative experiences of screening.

40|$|Cervical {{cancer is}} an {{important}} public health problem among adult women in developing countries in South and Central America, sub-Saharan Africa, and south and south-east Asia. Frequently repeated cytology screening programmes [...] either organized or opportunistic [...] {{have led to a}} large decline in cervical cancer incidence and mortality in developed countries. In contrast, cervical cancer remains largely uncontrolled in high-risk developing countries because of <b>ineffective</b> or no <b>screening.</b> This article briefly reviews the experience from existing screening and research initiatives in developing countries. Substantial costs are involved in providing the infrastructure, manpower, consumables, follow-up and surveillance for both organized and opportunistic screening programmes for cervical cancer. Owing to their limited health care resources, developing countries cannot afford the models of frequently repeated screening of women over a wide age range that are used in developed countries. Many low-income developing countries, including most in sub-Saharan Africa, have neither the resources nor the capacity for their health services to organize and sustain any kind of screening programme. Middle-income developing countries, which currently provide inefficient screening, should reorganize their programmes in the light of experiences from other countries and lessons from their past failures. Middle-income countries intending to organize a new screening programme should start first in a limited geographical area, before considering any expansion. It is also more realistic and effective to target the screening on high-risk women once or twice in their lifetime using a highly sensitive test, with an emphasis on high coverage (> 80 %) of the targeted population. Efforts to organize an effective screening programme in these developing countries will have to find adequate financial resources, develop the infrastructure, train the needed manpower, and elaborate surveillance mechanisms for screening, investigating, treating, and following up the targeted women. The findings from the large body of research on various screening approaches carried out in developing countries and from the available managerial guidelines should be taken into account when reorganizing existing programmes and when considering new screening initiatives...|$|R
40|$|To {{investigate}} the ethnicity-specific association between {{body mass index}} (BMI) and diabetes in pregnancy, {{with a focus on}} the appropriateness of using BMI cut-offs to identify pregnant women at risk of diabetes. Analysis of routinely-collected data from a maternity unit in London, UK. Data were available on 53 264 women delivering between 2004 and 2012. Logistic regression was used to explore the association between diabetes in pregnancy and BMI among women of different ethnicities, and adjusted probability estimates were used to derive risk equivalent cut-offs. ROC curve analysis was used to assess the performance of BMI as a predictor of diabetes in pregnancy. The prevalence of diabetes in pregnancy was 2. 3 % overall; highest in South and East Asian women (4. 6 % and 3. 7 %). In adjusted analysis, BMI category was strongly associated with diabetes in all ethnic groups. Modelled as a continuous variable with a quadratic term, BMI was an acceptable predictor of diabetes according to ROC curve analysis. Applying a BMI cut-off of 30 kg/m 2 would identify just over half of Black women with diabetes in pregnancy, a third of White (32 %) and South Asian (35 %) women, but only 13 % of East Asian women. The 'risk equivalent' (comparable to 30 kg/m 2 in White women) threshold for South Asian and East Asian women was approximately 21 kg/m 2, and 27. 5 kg/m 2 for Black women. This study suggests that current BMI thresholds are likely to be <b>ineffective</b> for diabetes <b>screening</b> in South and East Asian women, as many cases of diabetes will occur at low BMI levels. Our results suggest that East Asian women appear to face a similarly high risk of diabetes to South Asian women.

40|$|Abstract Background The Asian {{population}} {{is one of}} the fastest growing ethnic minority groups in western countries. However, cancer screening uptake is consistently lower in this group than in the native-born populations. As a first step towards developing an effective cancer screening intervention program targeting Asian women, we conducted a comprehensive systematic review, without geographic, language or date limitations, to update current knowledge on the effectiveness of existing intervention strategies to enhance breast and cervical screening uptake in Asian women. Methods This study systematically reviewed studies published as of January 2010 to synthesize knowledge about effectiveness of cancer screening interventions targeting Asian women. Fifteen multidisciplinary peer-reviewed and grey literature databases were searched to identify relevant studies. Results The results of our systematic review were reported in accordance with the PRISMA Statement. Of 37 selected intervention studies, only 18 studies included valid outcome measures (i. e. self-reported or recorded receipt of mammograms or Pap smear). 11 of the 18 intervention studies with valid outcome measures used multiple intervention strategies to target individuals in a specific Asian ethnic group. This observed pattern of intervention design supports the hypothesis that employing a combination of multiple strategies is more likely to be successful than single interventions. The effectiveness of community-based or workplace-based group education programs increases when additional supports, such as assistance in scheduling/attending screening and mobile screening services are provided. Combining cultural awareness training for health care professionals with outreach workers who can help healthcare professionals overcome language and cultural barriers is likely to improve cancer screening uptake. Media campaigns and mailed culturally sensitive print materials alone may be <b>ineffective</b> in increasing <b>screening</b> uptake. Intervention effectiveness appears to vary with ethnic population, methods of program delivery, and study setting. Conclusions Despite some limitations, our review has demonstrated that the effectiveness of existing interventions to promote breast and cervical cancer screening uptake in Asian women may hinge on a variety of factors, such as type of intervention and study population characteristics. While some studies demonstrated the effectiveness of certain intervention programs, the cost effectiveness and long-term sustainability of these programs remain questionable. When adopting an intervention program, it is important to consider the impacts of social-and cultural factors specific to the Asian population on cancer screening uptake. Future research is needed to develop new interventions and tools, and adopt vigorous study design and evaluation methodologies to increase cancer screening among Asian women to promote population health and health equity. </p...|$|R
40|$|Pancreatic ductal {{adenocarcinoma}} (PDAC) is {{a highly}} lethal disease for a multitude of reasons including very late diagnosis. This in part {{is due to the}} lack of understanding of the biological behavior of PDAC and the <b>ineffective</b> <b>screening</b> for this disease. Significant efforts have been dedicated to finding the appropriate serum and imaging biomarkers to help early detection and predict response to treatment of PDAC. Carbohydrate antigen 19 - 9 (CA 19 - 9) has been the most validated serum marker and has the highest positive predictive value as a stand-alone marker. When combined with carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and carbohydrate antigen 125 (CA 125), CA 19 - 9 can help predict the outcome of patients to surgery and chemotherapy. A slew of novel serum markers including multimarker panels as well as genetic and epigenetic materials have potential for early detection of pancreatic cancer, although these remain to be validated in larger trials. Imaging studies may not correlate with elevated serum markers. Critical features for determining PDAC include the presence of a mass, dilated pancreatic duct, and a duct cut-off sign. Features that are indicative of early metastasis includes neurovascular bundle involvement, duodenal invasion, and greater post contrast enhancement. 18 -F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18 -FDG) radiotracer uptake and changes following treatment may predict patient overall survival following treatment. Similarly, pretreatment apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values may predict prognosis with lower ADC lesions having worse outcome. Although these markers have provided significant improvement in the care of pancreatic cancer patients, further advancements can be made with perhaps better combination of markers or discovery of unique marker(s) to pancreatic cancer...|$|E
40|$|Hereditary diffuse {{gastric cancer}} (HDGC) syndrome, {{although}} rare, is highly penetrant {{at an early}} age, and is severe and incurable because of <b>ineffective</b> <b>screening</b> tools and therapy. Approximately 45 % of HDGC families carry germline CDH 1 /E-cadherin alterations, 20 % of which are nonsense leading to premature protein truncation. Prophylactic gastrectomy is the only recommended approach for all asymptomatic CDH 1 mutation carriers. Suppressor-tRNAs can replace premature stop codons (PTCs) with a cognate amino acid, inducing readthrough and generating full-length proteins. The use of suppressor-tRNAs in HDGC patients could therefore constitute a less invasive therapeutic option for nonsense mutation carriers, delaying the development of gastric cancer. Our analysis revealed that 23 / 108 (21. 3 %) of E-cadherin-mutant families carried nonsense mutations that could be potentially corrected by eight suppressor-tRNAs, and arginine was the most frequently affected amino acid. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we developed an arginine suppressor-tRNA vector to correct one HDGC nonsense mutation. E-cadherin- deficient cell lines were transfected with plasmids carrying simultaneously the suppressor-tRNA and wild-type or mutant CDH 1 mini-genes. RT-PCR, western blot, immunofluorescence, flow cytometry and proximity ligation assay (PLA) were used to establish the model, and monitor mRNA and protein expression and function recovery from CDH 1 vectors. Cells expressing a CDH 1 mini-gene, carrying a nonsense mutation and the suppressor-tRNA, recovered full-length E-cadherin expression and its correct localization and incorporation into the adhesion complex. This is the first demonstration of functional recovery of a mutated causative gene in hereditary cancer by cognate amino acid replacement with suppressor-tRNAs. Of the HDGC families, 21. 3 % are candidates for correction with suppressor-tRNAs to potentially delay cancer onset...|$|E
40|$|Within {{the formal}} {{child welfare system}} in South Africa, foster care is {{considered}} the preferred form of alternative care for children removed from their biological families and who are unavailable for adoption. This reflects {{the belief that the}} family is ideal environment best suited for optimal child survival and development. Although many South African children have benefitted from court-ordered foster care in the last two decades, however <b>ineffective</b> <b>screening,</b> training and preparation of foster carers have posed challenges to meeting the needs of children in need of alternative care. Utilizing general systems and attachment theories, {{the purpose of this study}} was to explore perceptions about developing an evidence-based tool for the screening of eligible foster mothers of children in cluster-foster care in South Africa. The study employed a qualitative research approach to data collection and analysis. A semistructured interview schedule was used to explore the perspectives of 12 social workers and four foster mothers about context-specific criteria for screening foster mothers within the clusterfoster care system in South Africa. Results indicate that a reliable and valid tool for screening eligible mothers in cluster foster care settings in South Africa should include a standardized assessment of parenting skills and psychological wellbeing of potential foster mothers in addition to the normative sociodemographic background assessments. Emotional and financial support were also shown to be crucial in ensuring the retention of foster mothers within the context of high attrition rates of foster parents in South Africa. The findings of this study underscore the importance of using an evidence-based screening tool to recruit potential foster mothers in South Africa and the need to assess the psychosocial wellbeing of potential foster mothers in addition to background checks...|$|E
40|$|Background: The recent Ebola {{virus disease}} (EVD) {{outbreak}} {{has been described}} as unprecedented in terms of morbidity, mortality, and geographical extension. It also revealed many weaknesses and inadequacies for disease surveillance and response systems in Africa due to underqualified staff, cultural beliefs, and lack of trust for the formal health care sector. In 2014, Ghana had high risk of importation of EVD cases. Objective: The objective {{of this study was to}} assess the EVD surveillance and response system in northern Ghana. Design: This was an observational study conducted among 47 health workers (district directors, medical, disease control, and laboratory officers) in all 13 districts of the Upper East Region representing public, mission, and private health services. A semi-structured questionnaire with focus on core and support functions (e. g. detection, confirmation) was administered to the informants. Their responses were recorded according to specific themes. In addition, 34 weekly Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response reports (August 2014 to March 2015) were collated from each district. Results: In 2014 and 2015, a total of 10 suspected Ebola cases were clinically diagnosed from four districts. Out of the suspected cases, eight died and the cause of death was unexplained. All the 10 suspected cases were reported, none was confirmed. The informants had knowledge on EVD surveillance and data reporting. However, there were gaps such as delayed reporting, low quality protective equipment (e. g. gloves, aprons), inadequate staff, and lack of laboratory capacity. The majority (38 / 47) of the respondents were not satisfied with EVD surveillance system and response preparedness due to lack of infrared thermometers, <b>ineffective</b> <b>screening,</b> and lack of isolation centres. Conclusion: EVD surveillance and response preparedness is insufficient and the epidemic is a wake-up call for early detection and response preparedness. Ebola surveillance remains a neglected public health issue. Thus, disease surveillance strengthening is urgently needed in Ghana...|$|E
40|$|Documented {{risks of}} {{physical}} activity include reduced bone mineral density at high activity volume, and sudden cardiac death among adults and adolescents. Further illumination of these risks is needed to inform future public health guidelines. The present research seeks to 1) quantify the association between physical activity and bone mineral density (BMD) across {{a broad range of}} activity volume, 2) assess the utility of an existing pre-screening questionnaire among US adults, and 3) determine if pre-screening risk stratification by questionnaire predicts referral to physician among Texas adolescents. ^ Among 9, 468 adults 20 years of age or older in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2007 - 2010, linear regression analyses revealed generally higher BMD at the lumbar spine and proximal femur with greater reported activity volume. Only lumbar BMD in women was unassociated with activity volume. Among men, BMD was similar at activity beyond four times the minimum volume recommended in the Physical Activity Guidelines. These results suggest that the range of activity reported by US adults is not associated with low BMD at either site. ^ The American Heart Association / American College of Sports Medicine Preparticipation Questionnaire (AAPQ) was applied to 6, 661 adults 40 years of age or older from NHANES 2001 - 2004 by using NHANES responses to complete AAPQ items. Following AAPQ referral criteria, 95. 5 % of women and 93. 5 % of men would be referred to a physician before exercise initiation, suggesting little utility for the AAPQ among adults aged 40 years or older. Unnecessary referral before exercise initiation may present a barrier to exercise adoption and may strain an already stressed healthcare infrastructure. ^ Among 3181 athletes in the Texas Adolescent Athlete Heart Screening Registry, 55. 2 % of boys and 62. 2 % of girls were classified as high-risk based on questionnaire answers. Using sex-stratified contingency table analyses, risk categories were not significantly associated with referral to physician based on electrocardiogram or echocardiogram, nor were they associated with confirmed diagnoses on follow-up. Additional research is needed to identify which symptoms are most closely related to sudden cardiac death, and determine the best methods for rapid and reliable assessment. ^ In conclusion, this research suggests that the volume of activity reported by US adults is not associated with low BMD at two clinically relevant sites, casts doubts on the utility of two existing cardiac screening tools, and raises concern about barriers to activity erected through <b>ineffective</b> <b>screening.</b> These findings augment existing research in this area that may inform revisions to the Physical Activity Guidelines regarding risk mitigation. ...|$|E
