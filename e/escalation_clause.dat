The review encompasses the evolution of the current coverage and provides an examination of; how and why it has come about, the complexity of the <b>escalation</b> <b>clause,</b> the extent of coverage and the effects of the current clause. The analysis emphasizes the change in the Navy's approach to escalation coverage that has occurred since 1962. It was concluded; that the ship acquisition environment has influenced the development of the current <b>escalation</b> <b>clause,</b> that escalation coverage has become progressively more comprehensive and that the use of the current <b>escalation</b> <b>clause</b> does have some adverse effect on the shipbuilding process.

40|$|Since {{the option}} to redevelop a {{property}} is valuable, ground leased property should trade at a discount relative to fee simple property because of the impairment {{of the value of}} that option resulting from the foreshortened horizon of the leaseholder. This discount would be over and above the discount that results from the leaseholder’s non-existent residual claim to the property. We evaluate alternative contractual arrangements that may be more incentive compatible between the owner of the leased fee and the leasehold. We find that a lease extension clause causes the lessee to defer development and develop at much higher density. Sharing {{of the value of the}} residual claim between the owner of the leased fee and the leasehold also increases the intensity of redevelopment but results in earlier redevelopment. Also, we find that a more realistic <b>escalation</b> <b>clause</b> causes redevelopment to occur sooner but at similar density...|$|E
40|$|M. Com. The {{potential}} {{investor in}} real estate is often confronted with a selection of properties in which he can invest. Each of these investments involves an expected rate of return and a risk that can be expressed in relation to each other. This relationship, known as the risk profile, differs from investment to investment and is therefore unique to a particular investment. The expected {{rate of return on}} an investment {{in real estate}} depends on the total expected tenant income less operating expenditures. Furthermore, the expected rate of return is influenced by the choice of capital structure. To be efficient, the capital structure must combine own as well as borrowed capital. Expected gross tenant income increases from year to year in terms of the <b>escalation</b> <b>clause.</b> The market average discount rate, at which income is discounted, does not necessarily have to differ from year to year. Consequently. a higher income could lead to a higher discounted value. The risk of investing in real estate is influenced by various factors such as location, interest rates, mass opinion, tenant mix and operating risk [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Excerpt] Each year {{thousands}} of people write contracts with <b>escalation</b> <b>clauses</b> that {{are tied to the}} Consumer Price Index (CPI). Escalation contracts call for an increase in some type of payment {{in the event of an}} increase in prices. These contracts are used in a wide variety of ways, from adjusting rent prices to adding cost-of-living adjustments to alimony payments and wage contracts. Unfortunately, many escalation contracts tied to the CPI are vague. For example, a contract may stipulate that “the Consumer Price Index (CPI) 2 ̆ 2 be used to escalate an apartment rent, but the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) publishes {{thousands of}} CPIs each month, so a more carefully worded contract could minimize ambiguity and the likelihood of future disputes.

We explore contractual alternatives that would be Pareto preferred by owners of the leased fee estate and the leasehold interest. The sharing {{of the value of}} the residual claim between the owner of the leased fee and the leasehold and a lease extension clause triggered by redevelopment can enhance the value of the asset to both parties. The results suggest that employing such contractual terms in ground leases in the United States would lead to outcomes more consistent with the fee simple case. <b>Escalation</b> <b>clauses</b> also have a potential impact on the timing and intensity of redevelopment.

Using a game-theoretic variant of real options analysis, the underlying real estate asset market is modeled as a continuous-time Nash equilibrium in which developers make construction decisions under demand uncertainty. Then, using the economic notion that leasing simply represents the purchase of the use of the asset over a specified time frame, I use a contingent-claims approach to value many of the most common real estate leasing arrangements. In particular, the model provides closed-form solutions for the equilibrium valuation of leases with options to purchase, pre-leasing, gross and net leases, leases with cancellation options, ground leases, <b>escalation</b> <b>clauses,</b> lease concessions and sale-leasebacks. ...|$|R
5000|$|COLA is not CPI, {{which is}} an {{aggregate}} indicator. Using CPI as a COLA salary adjustment for taxable income fails to recognize that increases are generally taxed at the highest marginal tax rate whereas an individual's rising costs are paid with after-tax dollars - dollars commensurate with an individual's average after-tax level. Indexing tax brackets does not address this fundamental issue but it does effectively eliminate [...] "bracket-creep". Indexation has been very important in high-inflation environments, and was known as monetary correction [...] "correção monetária" [...] in Brazil from 1964 to 1994. Some countries have cut back significantly {{in the use of}} indexation and cost-of-living <b>escalation</b> <b>clauses,</b> first by applying only partial protection for price increases and eventually eliminating such protection altogether when inflation is brought down to single digits.|$|R

Thus, inflation indexation is often applied to pension payments, rents and other situations which are not subject to regular re-pricing in the market.|$|R
40|$|Although the use {{of single}} {{solicitations}} for the acquisition of multiple supplies or services through the issuance of individual work orders began in the 1970 s, {{it was not until}} the mid- 90 s that {{the use of}} Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts was formally authorized by the U. S. Congress for use in federally funded projects. In view the federal success with this innovative contracting method, some state Departments of Transportation (DOTs) have incorporated IDIQ techniques into their contracting practices. However, some of the procedures established for federally funded IDIQ contracts are not implementable at the state level. In particular, DOTs need a simple, equitable approach to escalate contract unit prices on multi-year single award IDIQ contracts. Therefore the objective of this study is to develop a method for escalating IDIQ bid unit prices that is tailored for the Minnesota Department of Transportation (MnDOT). The proposed escalation method is the result of a comprehensive literature review and detailed case study analysis that benchmarked the state-of-practice in IDIQ contracting in the transportation industry. DOT contractual information about current <b>escalation</b> <b>clauses</b> was also collected, and then the price adjustment methods described in these clauses were tested using actual MnDOT historical bid data. The result indicated that traditional price escalation techniques for construction projects were not compatible with IDIQ contracts, highlighting the need of an alternative price adjustment method. The proposed method is termed 2 ̆ 2 A times E 2 ̆ 2 (AxE) bidding. AxE bidding is modeled after the 2 ̆ 2 A plus B 2 ̆ 2 (A+B) or 2 ̆ 2 cost plus time 2 ̆ 2 bidding method that has been in use throughout the country for the past two decades. In both cases, the 2 ̆ 2 A 2 ̆ 2 part is the sum of the products of the bid unit prices and the engineer 2 ̆ 7 s estimated quantities. In A+B bidding, the 2 ̆ 2 B 2 ̆ 2 part is the value of time in which the bidder proposes to complete the project. In A+B, a bidder with an aggressive schedule can win the contract without the need to be low on the 2 ̆ 2 A 2 ̆ 2 part of the bid. AxE bidding uses the same theory but the 2 ̆ 2 E 2 ̆ 2 part of the formula is the bidder 2 ̆ 7 s escalation rate. Again, a bidder can win without being the lowest price and can use the mathematical relationship between its bid unit prices and the amount they will escalate to achieve the lowest AxE amount...|$|R
