5|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{especially}} {{due to the}} vernacular language used, this work was largely neglected among the Greek scholars, especially by Adamantios Korais and Dimitrios Katartzis, and was never used as an academic work, or even as a school textbook. It was also negatively received by the Church hierarchy, as well as conservative Greek scholars, due to the vernacular language it used and the liberal views it expressed. It <b>is</b> <b>worth</b> <b>noting</b> <b>that</b> the work’s linguistic form disappointed even Dimitrios Katartzis, the intellectual mentor of the two authors, while Philippidis himself, never used such vernacular style language again in his future works. However, Geographia Neoteriki inspired a number of similar geographical works published in Greece during the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|The {{importance}} of collegiate life {{is such that}} for many students their college JCR (Junior Common Room, for undergraduates) or MCR (Middle Common Room, for graduates) is seen as more important than OUSU. JCRs and MCRs each have a committee, with a president and other elected students representing their peers to college authorities. Additionally, they organise events and often have significant budgets to spend as they wish (money coming from their colleges and sometimes other sources such as student-run bars). (It <b>is</b> <b>worth</b> <b>noting</b> <b>that</b> JCR and MCR are terms {{that are used to}} refer to rooms for use by members, as well as the student bodies.) Not all colleges use this JCR/MCR structure, for example Wadham College's entire student population is represented by a combined Students' Union and purely graduate colleges have different arrangements.|$|E
5|$|Together, the Permanent Members {{form the}} North Atlantic Council (NAC), a body which meets {{together}} {{at least once}} a week and has effective governance authority and powers of decision in NATO. From time to time the Council also meets at higher level meetings involving foreign ministers, defence ministers or heads of state or government (HOSG) and it is at these meetings that major decisions regarding NATO's policies are generally taken. However, it <b>is</b> <b>worth</b> <b>noting</b> <b>that</b> the Council has the same authority and powers of decision-making, and its decisions have the same status and validity, at whatever level it meets. France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom and the United States are together referred to as the Quint, which is an informal discussion group within NATO. NATO summits also form a further venue for decisions on complex issues, such as enlargement.|$|E

50|$|It may <b>be</b> <b>worth</b> <b>noting</b> <b>that</b> {{the part}} of Route 12 running through Peterborough's Bridge Street has a cycling ban in place {{approximately}} Monday-Saturday 9:00 am - 6:00pm and Sunday 9:00 am - 4:00pm.|$|R
50|$|Neocentromeres {{have also}} been {{reported}} in lung carcinoma and acute myeloid leukemia. It may <b>be</b> <b>worth</b> <b>noting</b> <b>that</b> neocentromeres in cancer may occur more frequently than currently observed, because many cancer screenings involving karyotyping do not use assays that detect neocentromere formations.|$|R
5|$|As a {{descriptive}} {{model of the}} two levels, Hare posited two extreme cases of people, one of whom would only use critical moral thinking and the other of whom would only use intuitive moral thinking. The former he called the 'archangel' and the latter the 'prole'. It <b>is</b> <b>worth</b> <b>noting</b> <b>that</b> it is not Hare's intention to divide up the entire human race into either archangels or proles; according to his theory each person shares the traits of both to limited and varying extents at different times. The archangel has superhuman powers of thought, superhuman knowledge and no weaknesses. This unbiased 'ideal observer', when presented with an unfamiliar situation, {{would be able to}} immediately scan all potential consequences of all possible actions in order to frame a universal principle from which he/she could decide an appropriate action for the situation. Such a person would not need a set of intuitive moral rules, as he/she would be able to decide the correct response to any possible situation by reason alone. By contrast, the prole has these human weaknesses to an extreme degree. He/she must rely upon intuitions and sound prima facie principles all of the time, as he is incapable of critical thought. The set of intuitive moral rules that the prole follows must be simple and general enough that they can be easily understood and memorised, and also quick and easy to use.|$|E
25|$|It <b>is</b> <b>worth</b> <b>noting</b> <b>that</b> all {{the even}} order susceptibilities become zero in centrosymmetric media. A {{proof of this}} is as follows.|$|E
25|$|It <b>is</b> <b>worth</b> <b>noting</b> <b>that</b> {{the common}} Jewish name Halpern, and many {{variants}} such as Alpert, {{derive from the}} name of this city Heilbronn, and the early Jewish community there.|$|E
50|$|It may <b>be</b> <b>worth</b> <b>noting</b> <b>that</b> {{residents}} of this area remain somewhat mystified {{by the fact that}} their neighborhood is dotted on maps and designated as a CDP, as it is actually a suburban residential neighborhood and not a separate town or settlement of any sort.|$|R
3000|$|Intuitively, a {{vector field}} {{is nothing but}} a {{collection}} of tangent vectors with the continuous constraint. Since at each point, a tangent vector is a derivation. A vector field {{can be viewed as a}} directional derivative on the whole manifold. It might <b>be</b> <b>worth</b> <b>noting</b> <b>that</b> each vector X [...]...|$|R
5000|$|It may <b>be</b> <b>worth</b> <b>noting</b> <b>that</b> cov(FS) − cov(HS) = ¼ s2A [...] Experiments {{consisting}} of FS and HS families could utilize this by using intra-class correlation to equate experiment variance components to these covariances section on [...] "Coefficient of relationship as an intra-class correlation" [...] for {{the rationale behind}} this.|$|R
25|$|Since 1995, two Dutch Harness Horse stallions {{have been}} chosen to add elegance and responsiveness, though it <b>is</b> <b>worth</b> <b>noting</b> <b>that</b> these stallions had {{primarily}} Ostfriesen and Groningen pedigrees themselves, and no Hackney blood.|$|E
25|$|It <b>is</b> <b>worth</b> <b>noting</b> <b>that</b> {{despite the}} fact that the Mordecais were the only Jewish family in and around this small town, they {{remained}} observant Jews, keeping a strictly kosher home where Shabbos was observed.|$|E
25|$|It <b>is</b> <b>worth</b> <b>noting</b> <b>that</b> 'attachment', 'craving', 'fear' and 'aversion' above {{cited in}} bold font are {{somewhat}} standardized and hence less-rich lexical {{choices for the}} semantic field represented by the four of the 'Five Poisons' (Sanskrit: pancha klesha) they denote.|$|E
30|$|System {{recovery}} process {{is one of}} the key factors for a large MTDC system. It <b>is</b> <b>worth</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> loss of a transmission line due to fault results in a reduction in overall power capacity of the MTDC network leading to a direct consequence on the remaining healthy lines of the network.|$|R
50|$|SNED1 is {{very highly}} conserved {{throughout}} evolutionary history and {{is shown to}} exhibit this conservation across {{a wide range of}} taxa, from mammals, to vertebrates, to invertebrates.It may <b>be</b> <b>worth</b> <b>noting</b> <b>that</b> the abundance of cysteine residues appear to be very highly conserved, suggesting that the cysteine richness is a very important feature of this protein.|$|R
60|$|When, {{some months}} later, the story appeared, its effect was {{immediate}} {{on both sides}} the Atlantic. It <b>is</b> <b>worth</b> <b>note</b> <b>that</b> during his French visit Cooper met Sir Walter Scott. Cooper was born at Burlington, New Jersey, 15th Sept., 1789, and died at Cooperstown, New York (which took its name from his father), 14th Sept., 1851.|$|R
25|$|It <b>is</b> <b>worth</b> <b>noting</b> <b>that</b> action {{potentials}} do {{not usually}} produce an observable field, mainly because the currents associated with action potentials flow {{in opposite directions}} and the magnetic fields cancel out. However, action fields have been measured from peripheral nerves.|$|E
25|$|It <b>is</b> <b>worth</b> <b>noting</b> <b>that</b> orbital rockets are {{launched}} vertically {{at first}} to lift the rocket above the atmosphere (which causes frictional drag), and then slowly pitch over and finish firing the rocket engine parallel to the atmosphere to achieve orbit speed.|$|E
25|$|It <b>is</b> <b>worth</b> <b>noting</b> <b>that</b> nicotine, {{although}} frequently {{implicated in}} producing tobacco addiction, is not significantly addictive when administered alone. The addictive potential manifests itself after co-administration of an MAOI, which specifically causes sensitization of the locomotor response in rats, {{a measure of}} addictive potential.|$|E
30|$|It <b>was</b> <b>worth</b> <b>noting</b> <b>that</b> {{this type}} of CO 2 -sensitive gel also had {{remarkable}} resistance to scouring compared to other CO 2 -sensitive shutoff systems such as sodium aluminate (with 2.0 PV water injected, less than 83  % permeability reduction) and resol phenol–formaldehyde resin (with 2.0 PV water injected, less than 31  % permeability reduction because the curing resin is brittle).|$|R
6000|$|... and it {{certainly}} seems probable that the allusion is to the dark colour of the hero’s hair; still, {{the point is not}} one of much importance, though it may <b>be</b> <b>worth</b> <b>noting</b> <b>that</b> a similar expression occurs in Ogilby’s superbly illustrated translation of the Odyssey, published in 1665, where Charles II.’s Master of the Revels in Ireland gives the passage thus: ...|$|R

In the matter of Latin, it may <b>be</b> <b>worth</b> <b>noting</b> <b>that</b> Rousseau rashly or otherwise condemns the practice of writing it, as a vexatious superfluity (p. 132).|$|R
25|$|It <b>is</b> <b>worth</b> <b>noting</b> <b>that</b> some of {{the shelters}} were {{incomplete}} as war broke out, some had little to no ventilation, many of them not camouflaged and some were not fitted with armored observation domes. The incomplete state of the shelters significantly reduced the combat capability of the emplacements.|$|E
25|$|It <b>is</b> <b>worth</b> <b>noting</b> <b>that</b> in the 7 matches {{he played}} in Aucher Warner lost the toss each time. On each {{occasion}} the West Indians had to field first and on each occasion they lost the match. Stanley Sproston had more luck, winning the toss 5 times out of 10.|$|E
25|$|A {{study by}} Griffiths et al. {{concluded}} that psilocybin {{is capable of}} producing mystical experiences. These experiences may be conducive {{to the development of}} a religious ritual. It <b>is</b> <b>worth</b> <b>noting</b> <b>that</b> the experience of death and rebirth can be brought on by psychedelic drugs, but it is also a central concept of Hinduism (i.e. saṃsāra).|$|E

25|$|The {{purpose of}} this order was, at least in part, {{to ensure that the}} local {{population}} would sell food and other supplies to his troops. It <b>is</b> <b>worth</b> <b>noting</b> <b>that</b> the Parliamentarian Colonel Daniel Axtell was court-martialled by Ireton in 1650 as a result of atrocities committed by his soldiers during the Battle of Meelick Island.|$|E
25|$|The word Sadism {{originates}} {{from the}} works of Donatien Alphonse François, Marquis de Sade, and the word Masochism originates from Leopold von Sacher-Masoch, the author of Venus in Furs. However, it <b>is</b> <b>worth</b> <b>noting</b> <b>that</b> the Marquis de Sade describes unconsented abuse in his works, such as in Justine. Venus in Furs describes a consented domme-sub relationship.|$|E
25|$|It <b>is</b> <b>worth</b> <b>noting</b> <b>that</b> {{there are}} {{factors other than}} true attentional {{abilities}} that might relate to difficulty paying attention. For example, {{it is possible that}} sensory deficits impact older adults' attentional abilities. In other words, impaired hearing or vision may {{make it more difficult for}} older adults to do well on tasks of visual and verbal attention.|$|E
