500|$|According to {{the park}} and Twitter posts {{selected}} by news media, public response during the soft opening was positive; Total Orlando gave the ride five stars for teenagers and four stars for adults. On Coaster101.com [...] "Ashley" [...] said that although the restraints were tight, they were comfortable and not as tight as those on other rides, adding: [...] "The drop on Falcon's Fury is different from any ride I have ever ridden. The best way I can describe it is that instead of leaving your stomach {{at the top of the}} tower, you take it with you to the bottom." [...] According to Florida Trip Guides, the ride was a good addition {{to the park}}'s attraction lineup: [...] "Falcon's Fury is not for the faint of heart. I have ridden dozens of drop towers but this one is different. Something about facing straight down and falling really makes you nervous." [...] Robert Niles of Theme Park Insider said that Falcon's Fury and other recent attractions were nearing the extreme of human tolerance; as a result, [...] "You're getting to the point where instead of making an attraction more popular by having it achieve some type of record, you're actually limiting the audience for that." [...] Randi Nissenbaum of Bay News 9 called the view from the top of the tower incredible, and although she was nervous at first she wanted to ride again. Sue Carlton of the Tampa Bay Times said, [...] "it was terrifying and thrilling and <b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>on</b> as hard as I could and yelled and closed my eyes and afterward stepped off rubber-kneed and exhilarated." ...|$|E

2500|$|Duncan Smith {{remained}} on the backbenches until 1997, when the new Conservative leader William Hague brought him into the Shadow Cabinet as Shadow Social Security Secretary. At the 1997 general election, boundary changes saw his constituency renamed Chingford and Woodford Green and his majority of 14,938 was reduced to 5,714. Duncan Smith realised the dangers that he and neighbouring Conservative MPs faced, so redoubled his efforts: [...] "We spent the final week of the campaign working my seat {{as if it was}} a marginal. <b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>on</b> but everywhere around me went." [...] (Notable Conservatives defeated in North London included Defence Secretary Michael Portillo, Education Minister Robin Squire, Foreign Office Minister Sir Nicholas Bonsor, 4th Baronet, Sir John Michael Gorst, Sir Rhodes Boyson, Sir Michael Neubert, Ian Twinn, Hartley Booth, Hugh Dykes and Vivian Bendall.) In 1999, Duncan Smith replaced John Maples as Shadow Defence Secretary.|$|E

60|$|I {{watched the}} lion growing bigger and bigger. I saw Don and Sounder {{run from the}} pinyon into the open slide, and heard their impetuous burst of wild yelps as they saw their game. Then Jones's clarion yell made me bound for my horse. I reached him, was about to mount, when Moze came {{trotting}} toward me. I caught the old gladiator. When he heard the chorus from below, he plunged like a mad bull. With both arms round him <b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>on.</b> I vowed never to let him get down that slide. He howled and tore, but <b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>on.</b> My big black horse with ears laid back stood like a rock.|$|E

60|$|The snow {{came down}} in earnest before we had made two more leagues, and, {{steering}} partly by the wind and partly by instinct of direction, <b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>on</b> half-choked and blinded, more and more slowly, until, when at last the case looked hopeless, Heysham shouted, for a telegraph post loomed up.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>on</b> by him, {{for he had}} set me all of a tremble {{with his}} notion of a sail in sight, and watched for the Long-boat again.

60|$|I struck {{straight}} into the heath; <b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>on</b> to a hollow I saw deeply furrowing the brown moorside; I waded knee-deep in its dark growth; I turned with its turnings, and finding a moss-blackened granite crag in a hidden angle, I sat down under it.

60|$|The wind freshened in the afternoon, {{raising a}} stiffer sea and trying {{the boat and}} me severely.
