5|$|Low-pressure <b>deposition</b> of {{thin films}} of cubic boron nitride is possible. As in diamond growth, {{the major problem}} is to {{suppress}} the growth of hexagonal phases (h-BN or graphite, respectively). Whereas in diamond growth this is achieved by adding hydrogen gas, boron trifluoride is used for c-BN. Ion beam <b>deposition,</b> plasma-enhanced chemical vapor <b>deposition,</b> pulsed laser <b>deposition,</b> reactive sputtering, and other physical vapor <b>deposition</b> methods are used as well.|$|E
5|$|Large single {{crystals}} (many cubic centimeters) can {{be grown}} by the gas transport (vapor-phase <b>deposition),</b> hydrothermal synthesis, or melt growth. However, because of high vapor pressure of ZnO, growth from the melt is problematic. Growth by gas transport is difficult to control, leaving the hydrothermal method as a preference. Thin films can be produced by chemical vapor <b>deposition,</b> metalorganic vapour phase epitaxy, electrodeposition, pulsed laser <b>deposition,</b> sputtering, sol-gel synthesis, atomic layer <b>deposition,</b> spray pyrolysis, etc.|$|E

5|$|From the 1960s, {{the rates}} of lung {{adenocarcinoma}} started to rise relative to other types of lung cancer. This {{is partly due to}} the introduction of filter cigarettes. The use of filters removes larger particles from tobacco smoke, thus reducing <b>deposition</b> in larger airways. However, the smoker has to inhale more deeply to receive the same amount of nicotine, increasing particle <b>deposition</b> in small airways where adenocarcinoma tends to arise.

5|$|In the 1950s, {{research}} {{started in}} the Soviet Union and the US on the growth of diamond by pyrolysis of hydrocarbon gases at the relatively low temperature of 800°C.

Diamond film <b>deposition</b> was independently reproduced by Angus and coworkers in 1968 and by Deryagin and Fedoseev in 1970. Whereas Eversole and Angus used large, expensive, single-crystal diamonds as substrates, Deryagin and Fedoseev succeeded in making diamond films on non-diamond materials (silicon and metals), which led to massive research on inexpensive diamond coatings in the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} to mimic this asymmetry in the laboratory in model bilayer systems.

By utilizing two different monolayers in Langmuir-Blodgett <b>deposition</b> or a combination of Langmuir-Blodgett and vesicle rupture <b>deposition</b> it is also possible to synthesize an asymmetric planar bilayer. This asymmetry may be lost over time as lipids in supported bilayers can be prone to flip-flop.|$|E

40|$|<b>Depositions</b> are {{the most}} common form of live {{testimony}} in litigation. Particularly in high-stakes civil and quasi-criminal litigation, however, <b>depositions</b> are often a source of considerable stress and anxiety for the witness. Therapeutic jurisprudence is an interdisciplinary approach to studying the law. It uses both social science and legal analysis to study the psychological and emotional effects that legal procedures have on people. The present article suggests that because <b>depositions</b> are often a stressful legal proceeding, they provide a rich context for the application of therapeutic jurisprudence. The authors suggest that good lawyers engage in a number of techniques during the defense of <b>depositions</b> that may have positive psychological effects on witnesses. Those techniques have been developed by lawyers through trial and error, but have seldom been subjected to empirical testing. The authors argue that empirical research should be conducted to identify therapeutic techniques for defending <b>depositions...</b>|$|R

25|$|Thin-film <b>deposition</b> is {{a process}} applied in the {{semiconductor}} industry to grow electronic materials, in the aerospace industry to form thermal and chemical barrier coatings to protect surfaces against corrosive environments, in optics to impart the desired reflective and transmissive properties to a substrate and elsewhere in industry to modify surfaces to {{have a variety of}} desired properties. The <b>deposition</b> process can be broadly classified into physical vapor <b>deposition</b> (PVD) and chemical vapor <b>deposition</b> (CVD).

The PVD process can be carried out at lower <b>deposition</b> temperatures and without corrosive products, but <b>deposition</b> rates are typically lower.
