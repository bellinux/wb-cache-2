50|$|A related term, <b>delta</b> <b>hedging</b> is {{the process}} of setting or keeping the delta of a {{portfolio}} as close to zero as possible.

40|$|Purpose – Interest only strips {{are created}} by {{stripping}} the interest portion of cash flows generated in mortgage-backed securities or simply by servicing portfolios of mortgages. A number of financial institutions have significant amounts of mortgage-servicing rights (MSR) which need to be <b>delta</b> (dynamic) <b>hedged.</b> Because MSR have a positive duration when prepayment effect is stronger than discount effect, {{it is possible to}} <b>delta</b> <b>hedge</b> a portfolio of MSR with other fixed income securities such that the value of the portfolio is not affected by increases or decreases in market rates. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to address this issue. Design/methodology/approach – The paper develops the delta-hedge-ratio of MSR within a dynamic approach, using three different securities. To lower the cost of the <b>delta</b> <b>hedge,</b> the authors compare three hedge ratios dynamically, in order to obtain the portfolio that needs the least <b>delta</b> <b>hedge.</b> Findings – The model enables the reduction of the amount of portfolio rebalancing and therefore reduces the cost of MSR portfolio hedging.

40|$|Equity {{and credit}} markets are often treated as {{independent}} markets. In this dissertation our objec- tive is to hedge {{a position in}} a credit default swap with either shares or share options. Structural models enable us to link credit risk to equity risk via the ¯rm's asset value. With an extended version of the seminal Merton (1974) structural model, we value credit default swaps, shares and share options using arbitrage pricing theory. Since {{we are interested in}} hedging the change in value of a credit default swap dynamically, we use a jump-di®usion model for the ¯rm's asset value in order to model the short term credit risk dynamics more accurately. Our mathematical model does not admit an explicit solutions for credit default swaps, shares and share options, thus we use a Brownian Bridge Monte Carlo procedure to value these ¯nancial products and to compute the <b>delta</b> <b>hedge</b> ratios. These <b>delta</b> <b>hedge</b> ratios measure the sensitivity of the value of a credit default swap with respect to either share or European share option prices. We apply these <b>delta</b> <b>hedge</b> ratios to simulated and market data, to test our hedging objective.

40|$|The Black-Scholes {{description}} of <b>delta</b> <b>hedging</b> makes the instantaneous {{value of the}} short sale negative, but the value should be zero by the principle of no arbitrage. This violation of no-arbitrage {{makes it impossible to}} illustrate the Black-Scholes <b>delta</b> <b>hedging</b> of an endowment of one call by an example containing only legally realizable transactions, and this causes confusion as to what <b>delta</b> <b>hedging</b> really does. Like Cox and Ross (1976), we model the short sale as having cash proceeds, and after including these, its instantaneous net value is zero. From this fact, <b>delta</b> <b>hedging</b> yields the risk-free rate of return on the option's opening value, for as long as required, in both discrete and continuous time. The terms of the Black-Scholes equation can be interpreted as inflows or outflows of cash, whose values are fixed at the time of hedging, and which risk-averse investors correctly price as risk-free even under the objective probability measure.

40|$|In {{option price}} simulations, simulation-time {{is of great}} importance. Control variates is a {{variance}} reduction technique that can reduce simulation-time. Three approaches {{to the use of}} control variates in Monte Carlo option pricing are presented and evaluated. Employed methods include ordinary control variate implementation, a replicating <b>delta</b> <b>hedge</b> and re-simulation. Ordinary control variates uses a highly correlated random variable with known mean to reduce variance. The <b>delta</b> <b>hedge</b> tries to replicate the option and is constructed with an approximative delta formula, which is new to stock markets. The third method evaluated, called re-simulation, is a new method which use an earlier simulated option price as control variate. Applying an earlier option price as control variate results in a more generic method, since earlier simulated prices often exists. The three models are evaluated on Asian and Cliquet options, either in the standard Black and Scholes model or in Merton’s jump diffusion model. Presented results show that the re-simulation method almost always yield a more efficient simulation procedure compared with the other methods. For some Cliquet options the simulation speed up over crude Monte Carlo is remarkable...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The variational {{inequality}} formulation {{provides a}} mechanism to determine both the option value and the early exercise curve implicitly [17]. Standard finite difference approximation typically leads to linear complementarity problems with tridiagonal coefficient matrices. The second order upwind finite difference formulation gives rise to finite dimensional linear complementarity problems with nontridiagonal matrices, whereas the upstream weighting finite difference approach with the van Leer flux limiter for the convection term [19, 22] yields nonlinear complementarity problems. We propose a Newton type interior-point method for solving discretized complementarity/variational inequality problems that arise in the American option valuation. We illustrate that the proposed method on average solves a discretized problem in 2 ∼ 5 iterations to an appropriate accuracy. More importantly, {{the average number of}} iterations required does not seem to depend on the number of discretization points in the spatial dimension; the average number of iterations actually decreases as the time discretization becomes finer. The arbitrage condition for the fair value of the American option requires that the <b>delta</b> <b>hedge</b> factor be continuous. We investigate continuity of the delta factor approximation using the complementarity approach, the binomial method, and the explicit payoff method. We illustrate that, while the (implicit finite difference) complementarity approach yields continuous <b>delta</b> <b>hedge</b> factors, both the binomial method and the explicit payof...|$|R

The existence of <b>Delta</b> <b>hedging</b> strategies in this pathwise setting is established via existence results for recursive schemes of parabolic Cauchy problems and via the existence of functional Cauchy problems on path space. Our main results establish the nonexistence of pathwise arbitrage opportunities in classes of strategies containing these <b>Delta</b> <b>hedging</b> strategies and under relatively mild conditions on the local volatility matrix.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY The {{objective}} of this thesis is to study the pricing of copper options by comparing the premiums of traded options and <b>delta</b> <b>hedging</b> cost. Furthermore, this thesis analyzes the profits of using options in the copper price risk management of an industrial company that uses copper as a raw material. <b>Delta</b> <b>hedging</b> of options and option returns have been widely studied in equity markets but relatively {{few studies have been}} conducted in the commodity markets. This paper thus extends on the literature concerning commodity options. DATA AND METHODOLOGY The data set consists of prices of traded copper forwards and options of 6 different maturities in London Metal Exchange in 1998 - 2008. <b>Delta</b> <b>hedging</b> is conducted with both the basic Black (1976) model and with a GARCH application to account for stochastic volatility in the underlying instrument. In addition, the <b>delta</b> <b>hedging</b> returns are regressed on simultaneous copper returns to account for systematic bias in the hedge ratios. The returns are also analyzed against the performance of the S&P 500 Composite Index, the US Government Bond Index, the GSCI, as well as the SMB and HML factors. The profitability of using traded options in risk management is assessed by comparing the returns of long positions in copper forwards and options. Furthermore, in a second strategy the term structure of copper is used to select a position in a forward or an option. RESULTS This study finds evidence on the cost of <b>delta</b> <b>hedging</b> being lower than the premiums traded options in the copper market. The application of GARCH volatility does not influence profits of <b>delta</b> <b>hedging</b> further, but reduces the deviation of returns slightly. Overall, the returns on <b>delta</b> <b>hedging</b> are not related to copper returns or systematic market risk factors. Due to their high price, traded options are not optimal in risk management over the observance period. Furthermore, using copper term structure to choose between a forward or an option does not affect the cost of risk management...|$|E

40|$|We {{propose to}} use two futures {{contracts}} in hedging an agricultural commodity commitment to solve either the standard <b>delta</b> <b>hedge</b> or the roll-over issue. Most current literature on dual-hedge strategies {{are based on}} a structured model to reduce roll-over risk and is somehow difficult to apply for agricultural futures contracts. We instead propose to apply a regression based model and a naive rules of thumb for dual-hedges which are applicable for agricultural commodities. The naive dual strategy {{comes from the fact that}} in a large sample of agricultural commodities, De Ville, Dhaene and Sercu (2008) find that garch-based hedges do not perform as well as ols-based ones and that we can avoid estimation error with such simple rule. Our expectations-based naive hedge ratios are driven from two conditions: omitting exposure to spot price and eliminating the expected basis effects on the portfolio values. It is also noisy, though, so the first-pass hedge ratios need to be smoothed. (We use a modified version of Gelper et al. (2007) for the purpose.)
