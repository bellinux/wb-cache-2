500|$|Gemini, {{with the}} {{exception}} of two songs which were filmed in Switzerland, was shot at AVM Studios. One of the songs, [...] "Penn Oruthi", was shot at Jungfraujoch, the highest railway station in Europe. Part of the song sequence was filmed on a sledge in Switzerland, making it the second Indian film to have done so after the Bollywood film Sangam (1964). Though there were problems in acquiring permission, executive producer M. S. Guhan persisted. The overseas shoots were arranged by Travel Masters, a Chennai-based company owned by former actor N. Ramji. Gemini was completed on schedule and M. Saravanan praised the director, saying, [...] "...we <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> working with S. P. Muthuraman himself, such was Saran's efficiency".|$|E
500|$|Conversely, another rock genre, Britpop, {{emerged in}} part as a {{reaction}} against the dominance of grunge in the United Kingdom. In contrast to the dourness of grunge, Britpop was defined by [...] "youthful exuberance and desire for recognition". The leading Britpop bands, [...] "Blur and Oasis exist as reactionary forces to [...] eternal downcast glare." [...] Britpop artists' new approach was inspired by Blur's tour of the United States {{in the spring of}} 1992. Justine Frischmann, formerly of Suede and leader of Elastica (and at the time in a relationship with Damon Albarn) explained, [...] "Damon and I <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> in the thick of it at that point ... it occurred to us that Nirvana were out there, and people were very interested in American music, and there should be some sort of manifesto for the return of Britishness." ...|$|E
500|$|Shooting {{commenced}} {{in early}} November and concluded on November 27, 2007. The strike suspended {{the script for}} the next episode and freed {{the cast and crew}} from an immediate deadline, with the result that more time was spent on filming [...] "Meet Kevin Johnson" [...] than the average Lost episode. Shooting did not customarily overlap with the surrounding episodes, although it was produced simultaneously with the [...] mobisodes directed by executive producer Jack Bender and one scene from the season premiere overseen by co-executive producer Jean Higgins. Perrineau hoped the audience would enjoy Michael's return since the cast and crew [...] "busted [...] butts doing this one. It <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> making a movie because there's so much stuff that happens in this episode". Lilly called it [...] "one of the best episodes of the first eight." ...|$|E

500|$|Chester Bennington {{stated in}} an {{interview}} with MTV News, which referred to Linkin Park's new style as being less technical and more organic: [...] "When it came to doing things that <b>felt</b> very much <b>like</b> older Linkin Park, like mixing hip-hop with a rock chorus, [...] <b>felt</b> <b>like,</b> if <b>we</b> <b>were</b> going to do it, we need to really {{do it in a way}} that felt natural and felt original and <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> it <b>was</b> something <b>we</b> hadn't done in the past... there are hip-hop songs on the album—'Wretches and Kings', 'When They Come for Me'—they're like nothing the band have tried before: snarling, raw, dark and...strangely organic." ...|$|R
5000|$|According to lead vocalist Gerard Way, {{the band}} had {{struggled}} with the departure of drummer Bob Bryar and was dissatisfied with {{the progress of the}} sessions for their fourth studio album until the recording of [...] "Na Na Na". A breakthrough was achieved once the chord progressions for the song were in place, with Way explaining,"That's the moment where we said, 'This song changes everything. We're starting over right now. We're starting it over with Rob Cavallo, and we're doing it now'. Everything up to that point had <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>we</b> had <b>been</b> in this kind of stasis, and as artists, stasis really equals death. So, it was so bad, the vibe wasn't good, and then 'Na Na' happened. And then, all of a sudden, there was this real, big intensity underneath us, and it <b>was</b> the momentum <b>we</b> needed to dig deep and record another album". The song was not originally intended as a single, but due to the positive response to the album's teaser video, [...] "Art is the Weapon", it was released and a full music video was shot.|$|R
500|$|Many of {{the band}} members have {{expressed}} their dissatisfaction with All Hope Is Gone and {{is considered to be}} their least favorite Slipknot album. Feeling discontent over the record's production process, Root said, [...] "it felt a little bit rushed. And it <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> trying to do things just to appease a schedule, which I didn't really like." [...] Root was particularly disappointed with the record's producer, Dave Fortman, and said, [...] "Dave Fortman really helped me appreciate Rick Rubin as a producer. [...] wasn't able to get nine people together on the same page and, to me, that's {{the most important thing in}} making a Slipknot record." [...] Conversely, Jordison said, [...] "It's finally the record that I've wanted Slipknot to sound like." [...] He went on to compliment Fortman's ear for tone, and considered All Hope Is Gone to be the band's best album. All Hope Is Gone was mixed by Colin Richardson in Miloco's The Engine Room studio in the United Kingdom.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} filmed between October and November 2007 {{in the sixth}} {{production}} block of the series, alongside [...] "Exit Wounds". The sequence of Jack, Ianto and Owen leaving for Gwen's wedding was recorded at Roald Dahl Plass on 25 October 2007. A number of locations {{were used for the}} wedding venue. Producer Richard Stokes notes that [...] "it <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> organising a real wedding but one that was being shot in about five different venues". Director Ashley Way states that in directing the wedding scenes, the production team had {{to make sure that the}} colour scheme co-ordinated in regards to aspects like the bridesmaids costumes and the flower patterns. Costume designer Ray Holman experienced difficulty sourcing a maternity wedding dress to accommodate the nine-month baby bump worn by Eve Myles. He remarks that in trying to source three such dresses from bridal shops in Cardiff he was regarded [...] "as if I was the biggest sinner in the world" [...] and ended up designing the dress worn by Gwen himself.|$|E
500|$|Nevermind {{not only}} popularized the Seattle grunge {{movement}} but also brought alternative rock {{as a whole}} into the mainstream, establishing its commercial and cultural viability. Neverminds success surprised Nirvana's contemporaries, who felt dwarfed by its impact. Fugazi's Guy Picciotto later commented: [...] "It was like our record {{could have been a}} hobo pissing in the forest for the amount of impact it had. [...] It <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> playing ukuleles all of a sudden because of the disparity of the impact of what they did". Karen Schoemer of the New York Times added that [...] "What's unusual about Nirvana's [...] "Nevermind" [...] is that it caters to neither a mainstream audience nor the indie rock fans who supported the group's debut album." [...] In 1992, Jon Pareles of The New York Times described that {{in the aftermath of the}} album's breakthrough, [...] "Suddenly, all bets are off. No one has the inside track on which of dozens, perhaps hundreds, of ornery, obstreperous, unkempt bands might next appeal to the mall-walking millions". Record company executives offered large advances and record deals to bands, and previous strategies of building audiences for alternative rock bands had been replaced by the opportunity to achieve mainstream popularity quickly.|$|E
5000|$|The band started {{recording}} the songs for their 3rd release and first label released full length in mid 2012 at Jonny Bell's (from Crystal Antlers) studio in Long Beach, California. The album was engineered and produced by [...] "Sloppy" [...] Jon B. Gilberts who also produced and engineered New Ghosts / Old Waves. [...] "The Late Great Whatever" [...] {{was released on}} Feb. 26, 2013 through Volcom Entertainment. From the first song, Hear or Anywhere with its prog punk aesthetic and pop heart to the final 12th song Styx and Branches it {{is considered to be}} a furious and infectious garage rock album that draws inspiration from psychedelic surf and punk. The album is also decidedly more heavy and hardcore than New Ghost / Old waves says Brayden Ward, “When people listened to it, we wanted it to feel <b>like</b> how it <b>felt</b> when <b>we</b> <b>were</b> writing it and what it <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> when <b>we</b> <b>were</b> writing it was that it was just a little bit dark, and not brooding, black and noir, just a little darker than New Ghost/Old Waves.” ...|$|R
500|$|Clifford was {{irritated by}} being placed within a genre by critics, stating that Seefeel [...] "weren't {{trying to fit}} into any one of their scenes and it <b>felt</b> a little <b>like</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> almost having {{convention}} thrust upon us when that was the very thing <b>we</b> <b>were</b> reacting against." [...] AllMusic compared the songs to ambient music by the Aphex Twin, while Exclaim! noted that [...] "Quique follows a similar path as Aphex Twin's Selected Ambient work but with structures that a more rock-based band like Chapterhouse dreamed of matching." [...] The members of Seefeel were fans of Aphex Twin and said after playing shows with him and Autechre that they felt [...] "more affinity with them {{than many of the}} bands we'd met – Robin Guthrie and the Cocteau Twins excepted!" ...|$|R
60|$|She {{was about}} five miles off when we dived to cut her off. My {{calculation}} <b>was</b> exact. As <b>we</b> came abreast we loosed our torpedo and struck her fair. We swirled round with the concussion of the water. I saw her in my periscope list over on her side, and I {{knew that she had}} her death-blow. She settled down slowly, and there was plenty of time to save her people. The sea was dotted with her boats. When I got about three miles off I rose to the surface, and the whole crew clustered up to see the wonderful sight. She dived bows foremost, and there was a terrific explosion, which sent one of the funnels into the air. I suppose we should have cheered--somehow, none of us <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> cheering. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> all keen sailors, and it went to our hearts to see such a ship go down like a broken eggshell. I gave a gruff order, and all were at their posts again while we headed north-west. Once round the Land's End I called up my two consorts, and we met next day at Hartland Point, the south end of Bideford Bay. For the moment the Channel was clear, but the English could not know it, and I reckoned that the loss of the Olympic would stop all ships {{for a day or two}} at least.|$|R
500|$|Phillip Atwell {{directed}} the music video on December 10–11, 2002. Almost all the film footage {{was used in}} the video except for a scene where 50 Cent raps in a glass box. The video is set in a fictional hip hop boot camp known as the Shady/Aftermath Artist Development Center. It begins with a black Hummer driving to the facility at an unknown location. Video clips from Eminem's single [...] "Without Me" [...] are seen playing in the entrance on flat screen TVs. We see Eminem & Dr. Dre looking down at the lab from a lab balcony with windows. 50 Cent is introduced by hanging upside down from the roof of a gym. Atwell commented, [...] "I think I could have done better with it, but I really liked the way that it turned out". The video also contains a shooting range, which Atwell felt was appropriate because 50 Cent had been shot nine times. He said, [...] "creatively, I <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> able to put guns in a video and have it play. And I like it when you are able to play within the standards and still give the artist something symbolic of what they are going for." ...|$|E

We're very dedicated and motivated about this now." ...|$|E
2500|$|Through 2006, {{interest}} in the band gradually faded. Their songs {{did not have the}} chart success that the members had expected. Allmusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine has remarked that the band's music [...] "didn't quite stick in the brain". Bassist Ethan Mentzer later said, [...] "There was a point where it <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> in an airplane and the engines just died... It was a long, slow glide down."

Foo Fighters were invited {{to serve as the}} musical act on the February 21, 2000 episode of Late Show with David Letterman, the first since his surgery, to perform [...] "Everlong." [...] Grohl stated that he was [...] "blown away" [...] after learning that Letterman was a fan of their music. The band went as far as cancelling a stop on a tour in South America so they could perform, explaining that [...] "We just <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>we</b> had to <b>be</b> there. Not only was it an honor to be asked, but it <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> something <b>we</b> had to do - because he had always meant so much to us. And that started this connection that we've had for years. It's fucking cool, you know?" [...] On May 20, 2015, the band returned to perform [...] "Everlong" [...] again, the night of Letterman's final episode. The six-minute-long performance was set to a montage of footage spanning Letterman's career.|$|R

In November 2014, it was reported that new elements had been added to the story, such as treating nature as the film's antagonist. Pixar's general manager and president Jim Morris stated [...] "We all liked the movie from the beginning, but... the story had some kind of fatal flaws in it that none of us really saw. It was kind of a Billy Elliot story. It was {{a very different kind of}} movie - there was a whole dinosaur culture and community and so forth. It was one where the Arlo character was kind of repressed by the community. It never quite felt right. It always <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> vilifying this group dinosaur characters that was otherwise a very likeable group. It just didn’t feel like it resonated truly." [...] Morris additionally explained: [...] "We give people the chance to work on a story, and we give them our support, but it doesn't always work out... there were story issues that were just not solvable. So we changed the story to make it better, and we're very proud of the film we have now." [...] In October 2014, Sohn was announced as the new director of the film.|$|R
5000|$|California {{began the}} season with a three-game winning streak, during which head coach Jeff Tedford became with the winningest coach in program history. The Bears then had three {{straight}} losses, including their sole home loss of the season. They were able to get four more wins, improving to a 7-5 mark following the first losing season in Tedford's tenure as head coach. This was Cal's third Holiday Bowl, the most recent being in 2006, and their prior record was 1-1. Coincidentally they had faced Texas teams in all of their Holiday Bowl matchups, with Texas Tech in 2004 and Texas A&M in 2006. Notably, the 2004 appearance resulted after Texas head coach Mack Brown had lobbied for an invitation to the Rose Bowl over Cal. Tedford said the incident [...] "was a long time ago. I felt bad for our team because I really <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>we</b> deserved to <b>be</b> in the Rose Bowl that year, but we're in 2011 now and it is a whole different situation."

We put no energy into the artwork or into anything. On a lot of songs, there aren’t lyrics!

2500|$|Blur were {{involved}} in a vibrant social scene in London (dubbed [...] "The Scene That Celebrates Itself" [...] by Melody Maker) [...] that focused on a weekly club called Syndrome in Oxford Street; the bands that met up were a mix of music styles, some would be labelled shoegazing, while others would go on to be part of Britpop. The dominant musical force of the period was the grunge invasion from the United States, which filled the void left in the indie scene by The Stone Roses' inactivity. Blur, however, took on an Anglocentric aesthetic with their second album Modern Life Is Rubbish (1993). Their new approach was inspired by a tour of the United States in the spring of 1992. During the tour, frontman Damon Albarn began to resent American culture and found the need to comment on that culture's influence seeping into Britain. Justine Frischmann, formerly of Suede and leader of Elastica (and at the time in a relationship with Damon Albarn) explained, [...] "Damon and I <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> in the thick of it at that point ... it occurred to us that Nirvana were out there, and people were very interested in American music, and there should be some sort of manifesto for the return of Britishness." [...] John Harris wrote in an NME article just prior to the release of Modern Life is Rubbish, [...] " [...] timing has been fortuitously perfect. Why? Because, as with baggies and shoegazers, loud, long-haired Americans have just found themselves condemned to the ignominious corner labeled 'yesterday's thing'".

He was also our Pro Tools engineer for part of it—not the whole thing, part of it, doing Pro Tools editing. He played on a song that never made the record." [...] Coutts recounted the atmosphere of the final recording session. [...] "It was kind of like a musical community, like friends and musicians would stop by and people that were working there, part of the recording team. Bob sang vocals; Bob played guitar.
