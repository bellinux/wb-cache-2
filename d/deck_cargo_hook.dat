Yachts are loaded by ship or by shore cranes in cradles either supplied by the carrier or the owner.

5000|$|In peacetime {{it is very}} rare, if {{it happens}} at all, that a tanker takes <b>deck</b> <b>cargo.</b> The war changed this as {{there was a huge}} demand for {{transporting}} large pieces of war equipment from the US to Europe and other war theatres. It was quickly figured out that tankers had large uncluttered deck areas {{that could be used for}} volume cargoes, like airplanes and trucks. For this the tankers had to be equipped with so-called [...] "spar decks" [...] where the cargo could be secured. On 1 January 1944 a total of 58 Norwegian tankers were equipped to take <b>deck</b> <b>cargo.</b> The installation of the spar decks was paid for by the UK and Nortraship did not ask any payment for <b>deck</b> <b>cargo,</b> as the charter for the oil cargo already covered the costs.|$|R
50|$|Key {{components}} of a <b>cargo</b> <b>hook</b> include the load beam, the keeper, and the attach point. The load beam is the solid piece of metal {{at the bottom of}} a <b>cargo</b> <b>hook</b> that supports the load. Usually it has a curved, narrow end which is used to load a ring, rope, or net onto the hook. The keeper is the locking, spring-operated mechanism that keeps the load from sliding off the load beam during transport. The attach point attaches the hook to the belly of the helicopter, swing system, or longline.|$|R
50|$|The {{following}} table {{includes a}} list of helicopter models {{that are designed to}} carry underslung loads. Cargo capacities provided reflect the airframe manufacturer's specifications; when put into practice the actual maximum load capacities may be less, depending on the rating of the <b>cargo</b> <b>hook</b> equipment. For example, if a helicopter model is rated by the manufacturer as having a maximum cargo sling load capacity of 4,000 LB, but the <b>cargo</b> <b>hook</b> equipment is only rated for 3,000 LB, then the pilot can only carry loads weighing 3,000 LB or less.|$|R

[...] A [...] "between deck" [...] or [...] "tweendeck" [...] is any deck between the main deck and the ship's hold. [...] "Tweendeck space" [...] is the space between any two continuous decks. The mention of a between <b>decks</b> <b>cargo</b> suggests that her hold was filled to capacity, as, for weight and balance considerations, it would have been loaded first.|$|R
