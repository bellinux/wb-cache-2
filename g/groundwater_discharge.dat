Very high spatial resolution thermal and hyperspectral images were acquired using Thermal Airborne Broadband Imager 320 (TABI- 320) and Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager 550 (CASI- 550) sensors. Extensive in situ spectroradiometer and oceanographic measurements were carried out in parallel with thermal and hyperspectral image acquisitions. Experiments and analysis of the data show that the combined use of very high spatial resolution airborne thermal and hyperspectral sensors for the detection of relatively small sub-aerial coastal springs and submarine <b>groundwater</b> <b>discharges</b> proves to be a very efficient and operational method. Very high spatial resolution thermal data were able to detect even very small coastal sub-aerial springs. On the other hand, the hyperspectral data were the most appropriate for detecting relatively small submarine <b>groundwater</b> <b>discharges,</b> which were not detected on thermal imagery, due to the increase in turbidity that these discharges cause. This is confirmed by the strong correlations between the hyperspectral data and the in situ measured turbidity-related water inherent optical properties. © 2011 Taylor & Francis...|$|R

40|$|The {{typically}} elevated {{natural attenuation}} capacity of riverbed-hyporheic zones {{is expected to}} decrease chlorinated hydrocarbon (CHC) <b>groundwater</b> plume <b>discharges</b> to river receptors through dechlorination reactions. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess physico-chemical processes controlling field-scale variation in riverbed-hyporheic zone dechlorination of a TCE <b>groundwater</b> plume <b>discharge</b> to an urban river reach. The 50 -m long pool-riffle-glide reach of the River Tame in Birmingham (UK) studied is a heterogeneous high energy river environment. The shallow riverbed was instrumented with a detailed network of multilevel samplers. Freeze coring revealed a geologically heterogeneous and poorly sorted riverbed. A chlorine number reduction approach provided a quantitative indicator of CHC dechlorination. Three sub-reaches of contrasting behaviour were identified. Greatest dechlorination occurred in the riffle sub-reach that was characterised by hyporheic zone flows, moderate sulphate concentrations and pH, anaerobic conditions, low iron, but elevated manganese concentrations with evidence of sulphate reduction. Transient hyporheic zone flows allowing input to varying riverbed depths of organic matter are anticipated to be a key control. The glide sub-reach displayed negligible dechlorination attributed to the predominant <b>groundwater</b> baseflow <b>discharge</b> condition, absence of hyporheic zone, transition to more oxic conditions and elevated sulphate concentrations expected to locally inhibit dechlorination. The tail-of-pool-riffle sub-reach exhibited patchy dechlorination that was attributed to sub-reach complexities including significant flow bypass of a low permeability, high organic matter, silty unit of high dechlorination potential. A process-based conceptual model of reach-scale dechlorination variability was developed. Key findings of practitioner relevance were: riverbed-hyporheic zone CHC dechlorination may provide only a partial, somewhat patchy barrier to CHC <b>groundwater</b> plume <b>discharges</b> to a surface water recept or and, monitoring requirements to assess the variability in CHC attenuation within a reach are expected to be onerous.

Cuatro Ciénegas waters are characterized by circumneutral pH (6. 9 – 7. 7) and reasonably low alkalinity (160 – 215 mg/kg as HCO 3). The d 18 O values of Cuatro Ciénegas waters range from 28. 2 to 25. 7 ‰, with a mean of 26. 5 ^ 0. 82 ‰, whereas dD ranges from 252 to 243 ‰, with a mean of 246. 6 ^ 3. 2 ‰.
