40|$|Prostate {{cancer is}} more {{frequently}} diagnosed in young males. It is then {{of utmost importance}} to improve preservation and recovery of sexual function. The surgical technique of radical prostatectomy has evolved and <b>erectile</b> <b>nerve</b> sparing allows now to achieve recovery in an important proportion of selected patients. However, rehabilitation and sexual counselling protocols are rare and may not include the partner. This has led us to propose a specific urologic and sexologic associated management...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIntroductionThe {{incidence}} of iatrogenic arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) has increased recently. Early {{diagnosis and treatment}} can prevent major complications such as arteriomegaly. ReportWe report {{the case of a}} 30 -year-old man who presented a long-standing popliteal AFV leading to iliac and femoral arteriomegaly. Fourteen years ago, he had undergone open reduction and internal fixation for a supracondylar femur fracture. A two-phase surgery was performed successfully. In phase 1, the Kirschner wire was removed and the arterial wall defect was closed by direct suture. Phase 2 was performed to repair the arteriomegaly. DiscussionOpen repair is the best therapeutic option in this patient, although it has the risk of <b>erectile</b> <b>nerve</b> damage...|$|E
40|$|Dissection of the {{cavernous}} nerves during radical prostatectomy {{for prostate cancer}} eliminates spontaneous erections. Using the rat as an experimental model, we compared the regenerative capacity of autologous nerve grafts and Schwann-cell-seeded nerve guides. After bilateral excision of cavernous nerve segments, cavernous nerves were reconstructed using unseeded silicon tubes, nerve autografts and silicon tubes seeded with either Glial-cell-line-derived (GDNF) -overexpressing or green fluorescent protein (GFP) -expressing Schwann cells (SCs) (16 study nerves per group). Control groups underwent either a sham operation or bilateral excision of cavernous nerve segments without repair. After 12  weeks erectile function was assessed by neurostimulation and intracavernous pressure (ICP) measurement. The reconstructed nerve segments were excised and histologically analyzed. We demonstrated an intact erectile response upon neurostimulation in 25 % (4 / 16) of autologous nerve grafts, in 50 % (8 / 16) of unseeded tubes, in 75 % (12 / 16) of the Schwann-cell–GFP group and in 93. 75 % (15 / 16) of the GDNF group. ICP was significantly increased when comparing the Schwann-cell–GFP group with nerve autografts, unseeded conduits and negative controls (P< 0. 005). In conclusion, Schwann-cell-seeded scaffolds combined with neurotrophic factors are superior to unseeded tubes and autologous nerve grafts. They present a promising therapeutic approach for the repair of <b>erectile</b> <b>nerve</b> gaps...|$|E
40|$|Radical prostatectomy {{often results}} in erectile {{dysfunction}} because of lesions to the <b>erectile</b> <b>nerves.</b> In this study we evaluated histomorphological alterations in cavernous smooth muscleandcollagencontentafterradicalprostatectomy. Progressive fibrosis in the corpora cavernosa after radical prostatectomy probably results from denervation and/or an ischemic process, which is caused in turn by the ligation of anomalous pudendal artery branches or of venous plexuses that drain to or from the corpora cavernosa. Fibrosis and the subsequent loss in elasticity and function of erectile tissue probably together cause erectile dysfunction...|$|R
40|$|Radical {{surgical}} treatment of localized prostate cancer is performed {{to heal the}} patient of his malignant disease. Surgery for advanced prostate cancer, e. g. transurethral resection for obstruction or hemorrhage, is always a palliative modality {{and has to be}} seen in the context of systemic treatment. Radical prostatectomy is a major intervention which allows complete removal of the prostate gland and the seminal vesicles at the same time. Due to resection at the distal end of the prostatic urethra, the bladder sphincter system is partially destroyed. In general, to guarantee radicality, the <b>erectile</b> <b>nerves</b> and vessels are sectioned, resulting in erectile impotency. Preservation of these structures to maintain potency is indicated only exceptionally. Radical prostatectomy is today a routine operation with minimal mortality (0. 5 - 1 %) and minor complication rate. Average hospitalization is about 10 days. Long-term postoperative morbidity is characterized by urinary incontinence and erectile impotency. Incontinence {{takes a long time to}} heal. A certain number of patients will keep a generally not very bothersome stress dribbling; however, some may show complete leakage, necessitating an anti-incontinence operation. For an indication of radical prostatectomy, two essential factors have to be considered: the usually extremely slow growth of prostate cancer and the high prevalence of clinically insignificant latent carcinomas. It is for these reasons and for the consequences on live quality that radical prostatectomy should not be performed on patients with a life expectancy of less than 10 years...|$|R
50|$|Clitorectomy {{amputation}} or {{removal of}} most of the clitoris, including glans, <b>erectile</b> tissue, and <b>nerves.</b> This procedure was the most common clitoral surgery performed prior to 1970, but was largely abandoned by 1980 because it usually resulted in loss of clitoral sensation. Potential surgical problems: The primary effect of this surgery, not surprisingly, is a drastic reduction in ability to experience orgasm. The appearance is not very normal. Regrowth of unwanted erectile tissue has sometimes presented problems.|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} we {{investigated}} whether {{the situation of}} urinary bladder cancer survivors can be improved. To do this, {{it is necessary to}} acquire a more specific knowledge of longterm distressing symptoms, symptom characteristics (nature, occurrence, intensity and duration), and of the corresponding symptom-induced distress, as well as the effect on wellbeing and the quality of life (VI). This more exact information can also be used in the pretherapeutic situation to "tailor", as far as possible. the method of treatment for the individual. Well-being is statistically significantly lower in patients having undergone cystectomy and urostomy, both non-continent and continent, as compared to a matched control population (I). Patients treated with radical radiotherapy for urinary bladder cancer report the same lowered level of well-being (II) in contrast to patients treated with cystectomy and an orthotopic neobladder connected to the urethra; they reported well-being and a subjective quality of life as good as that of the matched control population (M). One reason for the discordance might be the feeling of reduced attractiveness in urostomy patients, a 5 -fold increase in feeling unattractive being reported among them (I) as compared to no increase at all in cystectomised patients with a neobladder (III). The 6 - fold increase of the feeling of reduced attractiveness in the irradiated patients as compared to matched controls might be an effect due to the increased risk for bowel symptoms. A 9 -fold increased risk for defecation urgency and an 11 -fold increased risk for faecal leakage was reported by the irradiated patients as compared to the matched controls (II). The risk of being affected by these symptoms was also increased in cystectomised patients with a urostomy, and a 7 -fold increase of defecation urgency and faecal leakage was seen compared to matched controls (I). The risk of symptomatic urinary tract infections was increased 3 -fold among the operated patients with a urostomy, i. e. 25 % had at least one urinary tract infection requiring treatment during the past year (I). Virtually all men operated on were affected by sexual dysfunction, particularly erectile dysfunction, a symptom causing much distress among the affected (I+III, IV). A lower prevalence of erectile dysfunction was seen among the irradiated patients, i. e. 75 % (II). Symptoms of sexual dysfunction were the most distressing kinds of symptom among urinary bladder cancer patients (IV). The prevalence of distressing symptoms was lowest for surgical patients with orthotopic neobladder substitution. The occurrence of distressing symptoms does not increase with follow-up time, but an increased symptom burden was strongly correlated with decreased well-being (V). A majority of urinary bladder cancer patients give priority to optimal survival over a reduced symptom burden (I- III). If we refine the surgical technique during radical cystectomy and preserve (autonomic?) nerves in the pelvis, possibly the distressful bowel symptoms and the faecal leakage seen in patients operated in Sweden but not among those operated at Herlev University Hospital in Copenhagen can be eliminated. The high incidence of urinary tract infections in bladder cancer survivors possibly can be diminished by preventive measures. An orthotopic neobladder substitution and preservation of <b>erectile</b> <b>nerves</b> during surgery are further means to improve quality of life in urinary bladder cancer survivors. For those giving high priority to preserved sexual function, radical radiotherapy can be an option. During radiotherapy, diminishing the dose to the anal sphincter and rectum probably can increase quality of life in the patients that are cured. Our studies have identified additional factors that may improve the situation for urinary bladder cancer survivors, and 1 conclude that quality of life of urinary bladder cancer survivors probably can be improved considerably...|$|R
40|$|A {{inevitable}} {{consequence of}} radical prostatectomy without nerve protection {{is the total}} <b>erectile</b> dysfunction. With <b>nerve</b> protection the risk of erectile dysfunction can be lowered but not eliminated. Preoperative counselling of patients can be optimised in cognition of the factors which influence the postoperative erectile function. 110 Patients were asked 18 - 24 months after the operation {{with regard to their}} erectile potence. This patients were separated in the four groups of the erection hardness score, which assses the rigidity of their erections. Different potential risk factors (age, quality of preoperative erections, PSA-value in serum, Gleason score, tumor volume, prostate volume, adjuvant radiotherapy, nicotine consuming, ASA-score, chronic disease score [CDS], hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease) of postoperative erectile function was correlated in univariate analysis. For the multivariate analysis were the factors used with univariate correlation (p <= 0. 05) or with tendentially relation (p <= 0. 2) to the postoperative function. On univariate analysis, age (p < 0. 001) and ASA-score (p = 0. 018) were negative predictors of postoperative potency. On multivariate analysis, only age revealed significance (p = 0. 028). Being one year older the patients’ risk of an erectile status one grade lower is increased by factor 1. 128. Being ten years older, the risk of a worse functional outcome is increased by factor 3. 334. In case of an age difference of 20 years,the factor is nearly 11...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Endothelial {{dysfunction}} and {{peripheral neuropathy}} are important mecha-nisms responsible for diabetes-induced <b>erectile</b> dysfunction (ED). <b>Nerve</b> in-jury-induced protein 1 (Ninjurin 1) {{is known to}} be related to neuroinflammatory proc-esses and is also reported to induce vascular regression during the developmental period. In the present study, we determined the differential expression of Ninjurin 1 in penile tissue of streptozotocin (STZ) -induced diabetic mice with ED. Materials and Methods: Diabetes was induced in 8 -week-old C 57 BL/ 6 J mice by intra-peritoneal injections of STZ (50 mg/kg for 5 days). Eight weeks later, erectile function was measured by electrical stimulation of the cavernous nerve (n= 6 per group). The penis was then harvested for immunohistochemical analysis and Western blot analysis for Ninjurin 1 (n= 4 per group). We also determined Ninjurin 1 expression in primary cultured mouse cavernous endothelial cells (MCECs) incubated under the following conditions: normal glucose condition (5 mM), high-glucose condition (30 mM), and high-glucose condition (30 mM) +insulin (1 nM). Results: The expression of Ninjurin 1 protein was significantly higher in both cavernous endothelial cells and the dorsal nerve bundle of diabetic mice than in those of controls. In the in vitro study in MCECs, Ninjurin 1 expression was also significantly increased by the high-glucose condition and was returned to baseline levels by treatment with insulin. Conclusions: Regarding the role of Ninjurin 1 in neuropathy and vascular regression, {{it would be interesting to}} examine the effects of inhibition of Ninjurin 1 on erectile func-tion in animal models of ED with a vascular or neurogenic cause...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Cavernous nerve (CN) injury during radical prostatectomy (RP) causes CN {{degeneration}} {{and secondary}} penile fibrosis and smooth muscle cell (SMC) apoptosis. Pentoxifylline (PTX) is a phosphodiesterase inhibitor that further inhibits multiple cytokine pathways involved in nerve degeneration, apoptosis, and fibrosis. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate whether PTX enhances erectile {{function in a}} rat model of CN injury. DESIGN, SETTING AND INTERVENTIONS: Forty male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent CN crush injury and were randomized to oral gavage feeding of phosphate-buffered saline (vehicle) or PTX 25, PTX 50, or PTX 100 mg/kg per day. Ten animals underwent sham surgery and received vehicle treatment. Treatment continued for 28 d, followed by a wash-out period of 72 h. An additional eight rats underwent resection of the major pelvic ganglion (MPG) for tissue culture and examination of direct effects of PTX on neurite sprouting. MEASUREMENTS: Intracavernous pressure recording on CN electrostimulation, immunohistologic examination of the penis and the CN distal to the injury site, and length of neurite sprouts in MPG culture. RESULTS: Daily oral gavage feeding of PTX resulted in significant improvement of erectile function compared to vehicle treatment in all treated groups. After treatment with PTX 50 and PTX 100 mg/kg per day, the expression of neuronal nitric oxide synthase in the dorsal penile nerve {{was significantly higher than}} in vehicle-treated rats. Furthermore, PTX treatment prevented collagen deposition and SMC loss in the corpus cavernosum. In the CN, signs of Wallerian degeneration were ameliorated by PTX treatment. MPG culture in medium containing PTX resulted in a significant increase of neurite length. CONCLUSIONS: PTX treatment following CN injury in rats improved <b>erectile</b> recovery, enhanced <b>nerve</b> regeneration, and preserved the corpus cavernosum microarchitecture. The clinical availability of this compound merits application in penile rehabilitation studies following RP in the near future. status: publishe...|$|R
