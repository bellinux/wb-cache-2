50|$|CDC {{operates}} {{three companies}} under its umbrella, each {{focusing on a}} different geographic location. BidTool.net covers the construction activity in Illinois, Indiana, Wisconsin, and Colorado, while CDC covers {{most of the rest}} of the country, with the exception of the southeastern US, which is covered by its <b>DataFax</b> arm.|$|E
50|$|Although {{video games}} {{represented}} {{the majority of}} the company's revenue, Data East had always been involved in engineering. Outside of video games, Data East produced image transmission equipment, data communication adapters for satellite phones from NTT DoCoMo, and developed electrocardiogram equipment for ambulances. According to the company's website, its <b>Datafax</b> product, released in 1983, was the world's first portable fax machine.|$|E
40|$|The VA Cooperative Studies project "Group Treatment of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, " is a {{randomized}} clinical trial comparing group PTSD treatments. There are 10 clinical, 2 supervision and 2 administrative sites. Clinical sites (staffed with a PI, 4 therapists, 2 case managers, 1 assessor and research assistant) treat 36 male Vietnam veterans in 3 cycles testing at months 0, 7, 12, 18 and 24. Clinical supervision and routine administrative functions—which demanded {{a high degree}} of accuracy—are done using low-cost telemedical techniques. Because of budget constraints, the system design had to be done with existing technology. The study is guided by national executive, biostatistics, and treatment committees which teleconference weekly. The clinical teams have monthly group teleconferences with weekly individual phone supervision and daily/PRN e-mail supervision. Communications are stored in searchable, analyzable databases. Routine activities use internet technology. Data are collected using the <b>DataFax</b> data management system. <b>DataFax</b> manage...|$|E
40|$|Previously and {{currently}} planned methods of transferring or relaying telemetered {{information from a}} remote receiving station to the Mission Control Center, at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center, are discussed. The data flow techniques of the Apollo Program (fixed formats), the Skylab Program (data compression), and the Space Shuttle Program (data throughput) are defined and analyzed according to their advantages and deficiencies from an operations viewpoint. Excluded from the data flow technique discussions are command data, tracking data, television data, and Teletype and <b>Datafax</b> messages. Voice transmissions are addressed in the Space Shuttle Program discussion because they form {{a part of the}} telemetry data stream. The tradeoffs between actual data flow requirements and existing communications limitations are addressed for each of these programs. Finally, a short discussion of current problem areas in the planned ground data transmission system for the Space Shuttle Program is presented...|$|E
40|$|The Kennedy Space Center is {{transforming}} the PRACA bath {{automatic data processing}} (ADP) system of today into a fully integrated data base with on-line update and retrieval capabilities. The present manual system of reporting (<b>Datafax,</b> mail, and telephone) to the off-site design and engineering organizations is {{to be replaced by}} direct access to the most current information as it accrues at KSC or VAFB. Two major goals of the Intercenter PRACA are to provide a single data depository for both launch sites and to fully integrate the problem data with engineering data as well as other relevant information. The resulting ADP system can provide a closed loop system for problem reporting, corrective action and recurrence control that should serve the engineering community as well as reliability and quality assurance at the launch sites, KSC and VAFB, and at the design centers, JSC and MSFC...|$|E
40|$|Three maKes of telefacsimile {{equipment}} are descnbed and compared (1) Xerox Magnavox Telecopier, (2) <b>Datafax</b> 1824 and Dial/Datafax, and (3) Alden II Docufax. The models described {{are thought to}} be potentially useful to libraries. specifically for the purpose of transferring copies of pnnted pages from one library to another. Each system is capable of operating at minimum cost by using a single voice-grade telephone line. In this report the operating principles and characteristics of each model are described and the reliability and copy quality assessed. Costs are compared and tabulated for equipment, supplies. and telephone line service in two _hypothetical library systems, one comprising two libraries and the other, ten libraries. It is concluded that all three of these makes of equipment perform with sufficient rehability and copy quality for most library purposes. The type of equipment to select for a specific library apphcation is determined primarily by the anticipated volume of use, the quality and capacity of telephone lines to be used, {{and the nature of the}} material to b...|$|E
40|$|The aim of GRACE was {{to provide}} a large {{multinational}} registry of the full spectrum of patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) in order to define patient characteristics and outcomes and derive predictive risk scores. The study was designed and administered by an independent steering committee; data analyses were performed under the guidance of the steering committee at the Center for Outcomes Research of the University of Massachusetts. Regular feedback regarding local, regional and international guideline and performance measures was provided to individual hospitals and clusters of hospitals. Regional and international benchmark data were available to all sites. Main GRACE involved 123 hospitals in 14 countries in North and South America, Europe, Australia and New Zealand. GRACE 2 (Expanded GRACE) comprised 154 hospitals in Europe, North and South America, Asia, Australasia and China. Continuous recruitment and follow-up took place between 1999 and 2009. The first 10 - 20 patients per site (depending on hospital size) were enrolled each month, resulting in the recruitment of 102 341 patients, who were categorized as having ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction or unstable angina. Standardized case report forms (<b>datafax</b> or electronic) were completed by trained study coordinators, and included fields relating to demographic factors, comorbid conditions, treatments and in-hospital and post-discharge (6 -month) events. Blood sampling, genetic analyses and longer-term follow-up were undertaken in GRACE substudies. Prospective individual patient follow-up was carried out. All sites were audited locally; 10 % of individual patient records were audited in a 2 -year cycle. Less than 1 % of 20 key baseline fields, and less than 1 % of discharge diagnosis and discharge status data, were missing. Six-month follow-up was 85 % complete. Publications and risk scores are available at [URL] Proposals for specific analyses were considered, in competition, by an independent publications committee...|$|E
