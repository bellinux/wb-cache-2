500|$|Sports {{journalists have}} {{articulated}} the idea {{with increasing frequency}} that fighting adds nothing to the sport and should be banned. Among the reasons they cite are that it is unsportsmanlike, is a [...] "knee-jerk" [...] reaction that detracts from the skillful aspects of the game, {{and that it is}} simply a waste of time. The <b>Journal</b> <b>of</b> <b>Sport</b> and Social Issues Ryan T. Lewinson and Oscar E. Palma believe that fighting shows a lack of discipline on the part of participants, as well as a lack of fairness in certain cases, including when fighters have a size disparity. However, supporters of fighting say it provides a means of security for players, that fighting is a tool players use to keep opposing players in check; essentially allowing players to police which hits and dirty plays are unacceptable.|$|E

2500|$|The X Games gained media {{exposure}} due {{to their}} big name sponsors, top-tier athletes, and consistent fan attendance. As the <b>Journal</b> <b>of</b> <b>Sport</b> Management (2006) explains, Generation X and Generation Y are the two demographics most highly valued by marketers. This creates a broad approach on marketing towards that certain demographic, {{which is why the}} X Games marketing and economic outlook is so [...] "out of the box". According to ESPN (2008), in the Winter X Games inaugural year, 1997, 38,000 spectators attended the four-day event. In 1998, the attendance dropped to 25,000 spectators. But just two years later, a record attendance of 83,500 people attended the Winter X Games' East Coast debut. The X Games and Winter X Games continue to grow with the popularity of action sports and the athletes who compete in them.|$|E
