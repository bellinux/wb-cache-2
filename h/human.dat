5|$|Recent {{literature}} exploring bioethical {{questions from}} a <b>human</b> rights perspective has been criticised {{on the grounds}} that <b>human</b> rights theory contains unresolved problems. Bioethicists have claimed that bioethical inquiry can contribute to resolving these problems. Cochrane claims that this contribution to <b>human</b> rights literature offers three insights, but that these are not entirely original. These insights are questions about institutional fairness, rights as trumps and rights as solely belonging to humans. Cochrane holds that <b>human</b> rights should be reconceptualised as sentient rights. The grounding of <b>human</b> rights, he claims, are not distinct from the grounding of <b>human</b> obligations to nonhuman animals, and attempts to distinguish <b>human</b> rights from the rights of other sentient beings ultimately fail.|$|E

This interpretation goes far beyond normal statutory interpretation, and includes past and future legislation, therefore preventing the <b>Human</b> Rights act from being impliedly repealed by subsequent contradictory legislation.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Environmental {{philosophers}} spend {{considerable time}} drawing {{the divide between}} <b>humans</b> {{and the rest of}} nature. Some argue that <b>humans</b> and our actions are unnatural. Others allow that <b>humans</b> are natural, but maintain that <b>humans</b> are nevertheless distinct. The motivation for distinguishing <b>humans</b> from the rest of nature is the desire to determine what aspects of the environment should be preserved. The standard view is that we should preserve those aspects of the environment outside of <b>humans</b> and our influence. This paper examines the standard view by asking two questions. First, are the suggested grounds for distinguishing <b>humans</b> {{from the rest of the}} environment viable? Second, is such a distinction even needed for determining what to preserve? The paper concludes that debates over whether <b>humans</b> are natural and whether <b>humans</b> are unique are unhelpful when deciding what to preserve...|$|R

An analogous term is partly univocal (has only one meaning) and partly equivocal (has {{more than one}} potential meaning) because an analogy {{is in some ways}} the same and in some ways different from the subject. He proposed that those godly qualities which resemble <b>human</b> qualities are described analogously, with reference to <b>human</b> terms; for example, when God is described as good, {{it does not mean that}} God is good in <b>human</b> terms, but that <b>human</b> goodness is used as a reference to describe God's goodness.|$|E

Rajab was Training Program Officer and Senior Researcher at BCHR. He later became Vice President and Head of International Relations until he later took over from Abdulhadi Alkhawaja as BCHR president, a position he still held as of August 2012.
