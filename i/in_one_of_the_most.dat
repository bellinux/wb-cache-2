5|$|After {{finishing}} last in 1966–67, the Bruins {{qualified for}} the 1968 playoffs, their first appearance in the playoffs since the 1958–59 season. In the pre-season, the Bruins added Phil Esposito, Fred Stanfield and Ken Hodge from the Chicago Black Hawks <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> famous deals ever. The Bruins also added rookies Glen Sather and Derek Sanderson, developing a more aggressive image {{that led to the}} nickname of the 'Big Bad Bruins.' The Bruins, happy to make the playoffs, were swept by eventual champion Montreal in the first round.|$|E

John's nephew Otto retreated {{and was soon}} overthrown, with John agreeing to a five-year truce. Philip's victory was crucial to the political order in England and France, and the battle was instrumental in establishing absolute monarchy in France.|$|E

5|$|Baggio was {{not fully}} {{fit for the}} final against Brazil at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California, after pulling his {{hamstring}} during the semi-final and playing {{with the aid of}} a painkiller injection. Despite being far less dominant than in previous matches, he still tested Brazilian goalkeeper Cláudio Taffarel and was able to set up a few chances for his teammates. The match ended 0–0 after extra time; he took Italy's last penalty in the resulting shootout, but his kick went over the cross-bar and the Brazilians won the title <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> upsetting moments in World Cup history.|$|E
5|$|Four years earlier, in the {{election}} of 1876, Republican Rutherford B. Hayes of Ohio defeated Democrat Samuel J. Tilden of New York <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> hotly contested presidential elections in the nation's history. The results initially indicated a Democratic victory, but the electoral votes of several states were disputed until {{just a few days}} before the new president was to be inaugurated. Members of both parties in Congress agreed to convene a bipartisan Electoral Commission, which ultimately decided the race for Hayes.|$|E
5|$|In 1876, Hayes {{was elected}} {{president}} <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> contentious elections in national history. He lost the popular vote to Democrat Samuel J.

The result was the Compromise of 1877, in which the Democrats acquiesced to Hayes's election and Hayes withdrew remaining U.S. troops protecting Republican office holders in the South.|$|E

5|$|The largest plant task {{undertaken}} {{during the}} deployment was {{the construction of}} an airstrip at Opuwo. The squadron commander, Major David Crago, described how the road network in Namibia was better than expected; in retrospect, the squadron brought too much heavy road-making equipment. The squadron deployed 20 members of the Plant Troop (under Captain Nigel Catchlove) to Opuwo. Over a period of four months, Sergeant Ken Roma constructed an all-weather airstrip <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> remote parts of Namibia.|$|E
5|$|The {{population}} of Framlingham in Suffolk rose sharply after the Norman invasion of England as the village {{turned into a}} small town of at least 600 inhabitants, surrounded by valuable lands <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> prosperous parts of the country. The region was owned by the powerful Hugh d'Avranches, the Earl of Chester, who granted it in turn to Roger Bigod, the Sheriff of Suffolk. A ringwork or motte and bailey castle was first built in either the 11th or early 12th century in the northern half of the Inner Court of the current castle.|$|E

5|$|The {{result was}} an {{operational}} period of only eight years. This unique locomotive was saved from being scrapped at Woodham Brothers scrapyard in Barry, Vale of Glamorgan, South Wales {{when it was}} purchased {{by a group of}} railway enthusiasts who restored it from scrapyard to as-built condition in 13 years. Since then, modifications have been made to the original design, resulting <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> efficient and powerful steam locomotives ever to run in Britain.

5|$|The {{wreck of}} the Mary Rose was rediscovered in 1971.

The surviving section of the ship and thousands of recovered artefacts are of immeasurable value as a Tudor-era time capsule. The excavation and raising of the Mary Rose was a milestone in the field of maritime archaeology, comparable in complexity and cost only to the raising of the Swedish 17th-century warship Vasa in 1961.|$|E
5|$|Though the Giants {{kept the}} game {{close in the}} first half, and went into halftime down 10–0, the Ravens {{dominated}} the second half.

Collins completed 15 of 39 passes for 112yards and 4 interceptions. The Ravens won the game 34–7 <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> lopsided Super Bowls ever. The lone Giants score came on a Ron Dixon kickoff return for a touchdown. On the very next kickoff, the Ravens countered as Jermaine Lewis also returned a kickoff for a touchdown.|$|E
