5|$|In 1945 he was {{transferred}} to the newly formed Ministry of Public Security of Poland (MBP). In his work, Światło, like many other communist secret police agents, used torture and forgery. He was involved in arresting hundreds of members of Polish underground organization, Armia Krajowa, its leadership (the Trial of the Sixteen) and falsifying of the 1946 Polish referendum. In time he was promoted to Lieutenant colonel (pol.Podpułkownik) and served in various offices and departments, eventually in 1951 <b>ending</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the 10th Department, where {{he was one of the}} leading officers. The 10th Department was responsible for handling the Party members themselves. He received orders personally from the First Secretary of the Polish United Workers' Party Bolesław Bierut, and arrested such notable people as politicians Władysław Gomułka and Marian Spychalski, General Michał Rola-Żymierski and Cardinal Stefan Wyszyński. He had access - sometimes unique - to many secret documents. He interrogated Noel Field on 27 August 1949 in Budapest as well as his brother, Herman Field (a US citizen who went to Poland to look for his brother). Herman would be secretly imprisoned for five years, until the information on him was revealed - by Światło himself.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, the State of Connecticut paid $550,000 {{to acquire}} the parcel of land which became Lake Gardner State Park. The land was {{acquired}} from the estate of Carmine Belardo and returned a beach to public service {{that had been a}} private resort for 60 years. The Town of Salem had sought {{to acquire the}} land, but the citizens rejected the plan three times and a state funded grant was rejected in 1994 after the DEP announced the interest in acquiring the property for the state. In 2008, the state spent about $1million to pave the boat launch area and improve parking for 54 vehicles. In 2012, the State of Connecticut was looking to institute parking fees for the park after it experienced several years of increased attendance and incidents in the park limits. Concerns included littering, unkempt toilets, swimmers going outside the designated zone and police arresting almost three times as many visitors from 2011. In response to the issues, patrols were increased and additional signage was added to inform swimmers. The problems with trash problems and portable toilets <b>ending</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the lake caused concerns for a local advocacy group, Friends of Gardner Lake, and the Gardner Lake Authority which has staff to attend the lake during peak hours.|$|E
5|$|In {{preparation}} for 1998–99, he signed athletic Derby centre-back Matt Carbon for £800,000, Blackpool striker James Quinn for £500,000, and Manchester City defender Jason van Blerk for £50,000. He also brought in winger Mark Angel, midfielders Mario Bortolazzi and Enzo Maresca, and striker Fabian de Freitas. However, {{the player who}} had the greatest impact for West Brom was young striker Lee Hughes, who had been signed before Smith's arrival but only made his first start under Smith. Aside from Maresca, many of Smith's signings had little impact, and supporters criticised him for allowing popular goalkeeper Alan Miller and strikers Andy Hunt and Bob Taylor to leave the club. West Brom started the season well with Hughes in tremendous form, but a slump in form in March 1999 left them <b>ending</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> 12th place. Smith was dismissed on 27 July 1999, just {{a week before the}} start of 1999–2000.|$|E

As Jarrett attempted to hit Rhino with the guitar, Rhino countered by crashing into Jarrett with his Gore maneuver for the pinfall victory at 5 minutes and 30 seconds to become the new NWA World Heavyweight Champion. After the contest, AMW, Jarrett, and Team Canada attacked Rhino and placed him in the casket. Team 3D came to his defense, as well as the 3LiveKru.
