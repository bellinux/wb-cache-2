50|$|The Komatsu PC200-8 Hybrid is a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>excavator</b> {{manufactured}} by Komatsu Limited. It is the world’s first hybrid (electro-hydraulic) powered construction equipment. At {{the time of}} its launch it was found to consume 25% less fuel than comparable non-hybrid excavators and up to 40% less fuel while carrying out certain functions. It was released on 1 June 2008. It has been made available in Japan, China and North America.|$|E
50|$|In recent years, <b>hydraulic</b> <b>excavator</b> {{capabilities}} {{have expanded}} far beyond excavation tasks. With {{the advent of}} hydraulic powered attachments such as a tiltrotator, breaker, a grapple or an auger, the excavator is frequently used in many applications other than excavation and with the tiltrotator attachment, actually serves as an effective tool carrier. Many excavators feature quick coupler (quick-attach) mounting systems for simplified attachment mounting, dramatically increasing the machine's utilization on the jobsite.|$|E

The 345C L, with 345 hp (257 kW) of net flywheel power, is classified as a large excavator by Caterpillar. In Caterpillar's naming conventions, the last two digits indicate the excavator's weight in metric tonnes. The 345C L is not named after its horsepower. Rather, it is a coincidence that both use the number 345. Caterpillar currently produces the 300 series, including the 345C L.|$|E
50|$|The {{workgroup}} of {{a compact}} <b>hydraulic</b> <b>excavator</b> {{consists of the}} boom, dipper or arm, and attachment (e.g. auger, bucket or breaker).

Certain manufacturers including Terex and Caterpillar (CAT) offer an extendable boom option, much like the extendable boom of a backhoe loader.|$|E

50|$|The Trojan Armoured Vehicle Royal Engineers {{is based}} on a Challenger 2 tank chassis, but lacks the main armament. In place of the turret, it has a large <b>hydraulic</b> <b>excavator</b> arm, which can be used to {{excavate}} areas, move obstacles, and deposit the fascine that the Trojan carries at its rear. The Trojan is usually also fitted with a plough on the front, which enables it to clear mines, either detonating them on contact, or pushing them out of the way to clear a safe channel for following vehicles.|$|E
50|$|The {{foundation}} of the Warner & Swasey Construction Equipment Division with five product lines was started in 1946 {{with the development of}} the first production hydraulic excavator; the GRADALL®. This machine was new technology for the industry and was highly versatile and productive for a variety of work. The DUPLEX TRUCK® Company of Lansing, Michigan, a heavy duty and specialized truck manufacturer was acquired in 1955 to supply truck chassis for the GRADALL and future Warner & Swasey backhoe excavator and crane products. In 1957 the Company sought a broader market penetration into the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>excavator</b> market. It acquired the Badger Machine Company of Winona, Minnesota, with its six HOPTO® <b>hydraulic</b> <b>excavator</b> models which complimented the Gradall models. The Company acquired in 1967, the Sargent Engineering Corporation of Fort Dodge, Iowa, a manufacturer of hydraulic cranes. Their six SARGENT HYDRA-TOWER® CRANE models enabled the company to move into another large segment of the construction industry using hydraulic machinery. That same year the Company partnered with a Canadian paper industry association in the manufacture of the ARBOMATIK® a line of hydraulic tree harvesting equipment. Through corporate diversity into hydraulic construction equipment, the growing popularity and productivity of this type of hydraulic machinery yielded strong business growth for the Warner & Swasey company of Cleveland, Ohio during the years of 1946 through 1977.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hydraulic</b> <b>excavator</b> {{capabilities}} {{have expanded}} far beyond excavation tasks with buckets. With {{the advent of}} hydraulic-powered attachments such as a breaker, a grapple or an auger, the excavator is frequently used in many applications other than excavation. Many excavators feature a quick coupler for simplified attachment mounting, increasing the machine's utilization on the jobsite. Excavators are usually employed together with loaders and bulldozers. Most wheeled, compact and some medium-sized (11 to 18-tonne) excavators have a backfill (or dozer) blade. This is a horizontal bulldozer-like blade attached to the undercarriage and is used for levelling and pushing removed material back into a hole.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hydraulic</b> <b>Excavators</b> are {{somewhat}} {{different from other}} construction equipment in that all movement and functions of the machine are accomplished through the transfer of hydraulic fluid. The compact excavator's work group and blade are activated by hydraulic fluid acting upon <b>hydraulic</b> cylinders. The <b>excavator's</b> slew (rotation) and travel functions are also activated by hydraulic fluid powering hydraulic motors.|$|R

50|$|HISTORYThe Company {{started in}} the Excavator {{business}} in 1948, when they built a loader unit on a Dodge 4x4 chassis. Followed by a <b>Hydraulic</b> <b>excavator</b> the TU in 1951. It was built on a 2-wheeled trailer and powered from the towing tractor. Over 1000 were sold before a new design was introduced in 1956, the TO. By 1961 the tenth anniversary they had sold over 400 units, and moved into the German market. The TY and TYA being introduced that year. The German firm O&K introduced the RH5 their first hydraulic machine as well in 1961.|$|E
5000|$|Excavators (Hydraulic Excavators) {{are heavy}} {{construction}} equipment {{consisting of a}} boom, dipper (or stick), bucket and cab on a rotating platform known as the [...] "house". The house sits atop an undercarriage with tracks or wheels. They are a natural progression from the steam shovels and often mistakenly called power shovels. All movement and functions of a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>excavator</b> are accomplished {{through the use of}} hydraulic fluid, with hydraulic cylinders and hydraulic motors. [...] Due to the linear actuation of hydraulic cylinders, their mode of operation is fundamentally different from cable-operated excavators which use winches and steel ropes to accomplish the movements.|$|E

A stipulation within his divorce papers demanded that while on the Sanford family's Coosaw plantation, [...] "no airplanes will be flown at children".
