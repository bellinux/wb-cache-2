5|$|And {{being on}} that blessed pilgrimage {{in the sacred}} city of Rome and seeing its great and ancient monuments and reading the great deeds of the Romans as {{described}} by Virgil, Sallust, Lucan, Livy, Valerius, Orosius, and other masters of history... I took my prompting from them although I am a disciple unworthy of such an undertaking. But {{in view of the}} <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>our</b> city of Florence, daughter and offspring of Rome, was mounting and pursuing great purposes, while Rome was in its decline, I thought it proper to trace in this chronicle the origins of the city of Florence, so far as I have been able to recover them, and to relate the city's further development at greater length, {{and at the same time}} to give a brief account of events throughout the world as long as it please God, in the hope of whose favor I undertook the said enterprise rather than in reliance on my own poor wits. And thus in the year 1300, on my return from Rome, I began to compile this book in the name of God and the blessed John the Baptist and in honor of our city of Florence.|$|E

Both historians of the battle and IJN commanders have acknowledged this factor as {{the primary reason for}} the Sho plan's failure. H.P. Willmott writes: [...] "In large measure, the Japanese defeat in the Philippines had assumed substance...prior to the landing operations of 17 and 20October. This was the case because of {{the nature and extent of}} the victory won by American carrier air groups in the course of their operations after 10October." [...] Toyoda, when posed the question [...] "What would you say was the primary cause for the lack of success in that operation?"

According to Mercury vice president Marty Maidenberg, an international tour for the album had been planned by October 1996, with concert dates in Japan and the United Kingdom, but it never materialized. In November 1997, Saadiq told the Philadelphia Daily News [...] "there should have been like four singles from that album. You'll have to call Mercury on that. It went Platinum with no promotional tour. We did our job and they made their money." [...] The group disbanded shortly afterwards, and each member went on to pursue an individual music career.|$|E

2500|$|By {{the time}} of the German {{invasion}} in 1939, antisemitism was escalating, and hostility towards Jews was a mainstay of the right-wing political forces post-Piłsudski regime and also the Catholic Church. Discrimination and violence against Jews had rendered the Polish Jewish population increasingly destitute, as was the case throughout much of Central and Eastern Europe. Despite the impending threat to the Polish Republic from Nazi Germany, there was little effort seen in the way of reconciliation with Poland's Jewish population. In July 1939 the pro-government Gazeta Polska wrote, [...] "The <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>our</b> relations with the Reich are worsening does not in the least deactivate our program in the Jewish question—there is not and cannot be any common ground between our internal Jewish problem and Poland's relations with the Hitlerite Reich." [...] Escalating hostility towards Polish Jews and an official Polish government desire to remove Jews from Poland continued until the German invasion of Poland.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{examples}} from auditory perception research {{will be helpful}} in explaining the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>our</b> perceptual faculties naturally enhance and supplement our conscious experience. First, there is the [...] "cocktail party phenomenon" [...] (Moray, 1959). When someone is engaged in conversation {{with a group of}} people in a noisy room, but then they suddenly hear something or hear their name from across the room, when they were completely inattentive to the input before, that is the cocktail party phenomenon. This phenomenon also occurs with words associated with danger and sex. Although people may be inattentive to a portion of their environment, when they hear specific [...] "trigger" [...] words, their auditory capacities are redirected to another dimension of perceptual awareness. This shows that we do process information outside of our immediate conscious experience. Similar to visual perception, auditory perception also enhances and supplements our experience by searching out and extracting meaningful information from our environment.|$|E
