50|$|<b>Gadobutrol</b> is a {{medicinal}} product used in diagnostic {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI) in adults and children. It provides contrast enhancement during cranial, spinal, or breast investigations. In the central nervous system, <b>Gadobutrol</b> works by highlighting any areas with disrupted blood brain barrier (BBB) and/or abnormal vascularity. In breast tissue, <b>Gadobutrol</b> exposes the presence and extent of malignant breast disease. Similarly, <b>gadobutrol</b> is also used in contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (CE-MRA) for the diagnosis of stroke, detection of tumor perfusion, and presence of focal cerebral ischemia.|$|E
50|$|It is {{recommended}} that renal impairment be assessed for all patients prior to administration of <b>gadobutrol.</b> It {{is not necessary to}} adjust the dose in these populations, however, <b>gadobutrol</b> will need to be removed from the body using hemodialysis.|$|E

50|$|<b>Gadobutrol</b> is a {{paramagnetic}} macrocyclic {{contrast agent}} administered intravenously {{for use in}} magnetic resonance imaging. The contrast-enhancing effect {{is a result of}} the neutral complex of gadolinium and dihydroxy-hydroxymethylpropyl- tetraazacyclododecane-triacetic acid (butrol), which works to decrease differences in longitudinal relaxation times (T1) and differences in spin-spin or transverse relaxation times (T2). These relaxation times, coupled with differences in proton density, are responsible for the variation in intensity of radio frequency signals which contribute to an MRI's tissue visualization capabilities. Greater signal enhancement, and therefore, greater tissue visualization, is achieved with increased shortening of T1 and T2.|$|E

Two identical breast MRI examinations were performed in 72 patients with biopsy-proven breast cancer, separated by 1 - 7 days. <b>Gadobutrol</b> 1. 0 M or gadobenate 0. 5 M were administered in a randomised order. Lesion detection and characterisation were performed by two independent blinded readers. Lesion tracking, which compared on-site readings and histology from surgery or biopsy, was performed by a third reader. Differences in lesion detection and characterisation were compared between the two contrast agents. Among 103 lesions, 96 were malignant and 7 were benign. No difference in lesion detection was identified between the contrast agents (82. 33 % for <b>gadobutrol,</b> 81. 60 % for gadobenate). Assessment of sensitivity in lesion characterisation and Breast Imaging Reporting and Data Systems showed no difference between <b>gadobutrol</b> (92. 63 %) and gadobenate (90. 53 %). Regarding morphology, there was more non-focal enhancement for <b>gadobutrol</b> than for gadobenate (P = 0. 0057).

40|$|Background: This study {{determined}} the pharmacokinetics of the contrast agent <b>gadobutrol</b> in marmosets by quantitative MRI to derive guidelines for neuroimaging protocols. Methods: Local concentrations of <b>gadobutrol</b> were determined from consecutive gradient echo-based mapping of the relaxation rate R 1 on a clinical 3 T MRI scanner. Half-time of renal elimination was measured after injection of a triple dose of <b>gadobutrol</b> (0. 3 mmol/kg) into the saphenous vein. A first-order single-compartment model was fitted to the measured R 1 values and verified by blood analysis. Results: Slow injection (1. 5 minutes) {{resulted in an}} elimination half-time of 26 ± 4 minutes. After bolus injection (15 seconds), elimination was much slower (62 ± 8 minutes) with 45 % larger distribution volumes. Importantly, more <b>gadobutrol</b> entered the cerebrospinal fluid. Conclusions: Slow injection and a latency of about 20 minutes are recommended to avoid extravasation. Application of a triple dose of <b>gadobutrol</b> compensates for the fast elimination in healthy marmosets...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Two macrocyclic {{extracellular}} contrast agents, one-molar neutral <b>gadobutrol</b> and ionic gadoterate meglumine, {{were compared}} to determine the overall preference for {{one or the other}} in a clinical setting. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Multicenter, randomized, single-blind, intra-individually controlled, comparison study with a corresponding blinded read. Efficacy analysis was based on 136 patients who underwent identical MRI examinations: group A first received 1. 0 M <b>gadobutrol</b> followed by 0. 5 M gadoterate meglumine 48 h to 7 days later; group B had a reversed administration order. Three independent blinded readers assessed off-site their overall diagnostic preference (primary efficacy parameter) based on a matched pairs approach. RESULTS: Superiority of <b>gadobutrol</b> over gadoterate meglumine was demonstrated for the qualitative assessment of overall preference across all readers by a statistically significant difference between both contrast agents for this primary endpoint. Preferences in lesion enhancement (secondary endpoint) were also found significantly in favor of <b>gadobutrol.</b> For preference in lesion delineation from surrounding tissue/edema and for internal structure only a trend towards a higher proportion for <b>gadobutrol</b> was found (except for internal structure reported by one reader, which showed a result of statistical significance). Lesion contrast and relative lesion enhancement (quantitative parameters) were statistically significantly higher for <b>gadobutrol</b> compared to gadoterate meglumine. CONCLUSION: Contrast-enhanced MRI of neoplastic brain lesions at a dose of 0. 1 mmol Gd/kg body weight, assessed in a standardized off-site blinded reading, results in a significantly higher qualitative and quantitative preference for <b>gadobutrol</b> compared to gadoterate meglumine...|$|E

40|$|Purpose Contrast-enhanced {{magnetic}} resonance imaging (MRI) of {{the central nervous system}} (CNS) with gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) is standard of care for CNS imaging and diagnosis because of the visualization of lesions that cause blood–brain barrier breakdown. <b>Gadobutrol</b> is a macrocyclic GBCA with high concentration and high relaxivity. The objective {{of this study was to}} compare the safety and efficacy of <b>gadobutrol</b> 1. 0 M vs unenhanced imaging and vs the approved macrocyclic agent gadoteridol 0. 5 M at a dose of 0. 1 mmol/kg bodyweight. Materials and Methods Prospective, multicenter, double-blind, crossover trial in patients who underwent unenhanced MRI followed by enhanced imaging with <b>gadobutrol</b> or gadoteridol. Three blinded readers assessed the {{magnetic resonance}} images. The primary efficacy variables included number of lesions detected, degree of lesion contrast-enhancement, lesion border delineation, and lesion internal morphology. Results Of the 402 treated patients, 390 patients received study drugs. Lesion contrast-enhancement, lesion border delineation, and lesion internal morphology were superior for combined unenhanced/gadobutrol-enhanced imaging vs unenhanced imaging (P < 0. 0001 for all). Compared with gadoteridol, <b>gadobutrol</b> was non-inferior for all primary variables and superior for lesion contrast-enhancement, as well as sensitivity and accuracy for detection of malignant disease. The percentage of patients with at least one drug-related adverse event was similar for <b>gadobutrol</b> (10. 0 %) and gadoteridol (9. 7 %). Conclusion <b>Gadobutrol</b> is an effective and well-tolerated macrocyclic contrast agent for MRI of the CNS. <b>Gadobutrol</b> demonstrates greater contrast-enhancement and improved sensitivity and accuracy for detection of malignant disease than gadoteridol, likely because of its higher relaxivity...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this phase III {{clinical}} trial was to compare two different extracellular contrast agents, 1. 0 M <b>gadobutrol</b> and 0. 5 M gadopentate dimeglumine, for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with known or suspected focal renal lesions. Using a multicenter, single-blind, interindividual, randomized study design, both contrast agents were compared {{in a total of}} 471 patients regarding their diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity to correctly classify focal lesions of the kidney. To test for noninferiority the diagnostic accuracy rates for both contrast agents were compared with CT results based on a blinded reading. The average diagnostic accuracy across the three blinded readers (‘average reader’) was 83. 7 % for <b>gadobutrol</b> and 87. 3 % for gadopentate dimeglumine. The increase in accuracy from precontrast to combined precontrast and postcontrast MRI was 8. 0 % for <b>gadobutrol</b> and 6. 9 % for gadopentate dimeglumine.

40|$|PURPOSE: To compare {{enhancement}} {{characteristics and}} image quality of two macrocyclic gadolinium chelates, gadoterate meglumine and <b>gadobutrol,</b> in low-dose, time-resolved MRA of the calf station. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 100 consecutive patients with {{peripheral arterial disease}} (stages II-IV) were retrospectively analysed. Fifty patients were included in each group - 32 men and 18 women for <b>gadobutrol</b> (mean age 67 years) and 34 men, 16 women for gadoterate meglumine (mean age 64 years). 0. 03 mmol/kg bw of either <b>gadobutrol</b> or gadoterate meglumine was injected. <b>Gadobutrol</b> was diluted 1 ∶ 1 with normal saline (0. 9 % NaCl) to provide similar injection volume and bolus geometry compared to the undiluted 0. 5 M dose of gadoterate meglumine. Signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR), contrast-to-noise-ratio (CNR) and image quality were analysed and compared between the two groups. RESULTS: Mean SNR ranged from 83. 0 ± 46. 7 (peroneal artery) to 96. 4 ± 64. 5 (anterior tibial artery) for <b>gadobutrol,</b> and from 37. 6 ± 13. 8 (peroneal artery) to 45. 3 ± 16. 4 (anterior tibial artery) for the gadoterate meglumine group (p< 0. 0001). CNR values ranged from 30. 1 ± 20. 1 (peroneal artery) to 37. 6 ± 26. 0 (anterior tibial artery) for <b>gadobutrol</b> and from 14. 9 ± 8. 0 (peroneal artery) to 18. 6 ± 16. 4 (anterior tibial artery) for gadoterate meglumine (p< 0. 0001). No significant difference in image quality was found except for the peroneal arteries (p = 0. 006 and p = 0. 04). Interreader agreement was excellent (kappa 0. 87 - 0. 93). CONCLUSION: The significantly better enhancement as assessed by SNR and CNR provided by <b>gadobutrol</b> compared to gadoterate meglumine does not translate into substantial differences in image quality in an equimolar, low-dose, time-resolved MRA protocol of the calves...|$|E
40|$|Rationale and Objectives: Monochromatic {{quantitative}} {{computed tomography}} allows a nondestructive and quantitative measurement of gadolinium (Gd) concentration. This technique {{was used in}} the C 6 rat glioma model to compare gadopentetate dimeglumine and <b>gadobutrol.</b> Methods: Rats bearing late-stage gliomas received 2. 5 mmol/kg (392. 5 mg Gd/kg) of gadopentetate dimeglumine (n 5) and <b>gadobutrol</b> (n 6) intravenously before the imaging session performed at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility. Results: Monochromatic quantitative computed tomography enabled in vivo follow-up of Gd concentration as a function of time in specified regions of interest. Surprisingly, after <b>gadobutrol</b> injection, Gd concentrations in the center and periphery of the tumor were higher than those after gadopentetate injection, although identical in normal and contralateral area of the brain. Conclusion: The in vivo assessment of absolute Gd concentrations revealed differences in <b>gadobutrol</b> and gadopentetate dimeglumine behaviors in tumoral tissues despite injections in the same conditions. These differences might be attributed to different characteristics of the contrast agents...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the {{efficacy}} and safety of macrocyclic <b>gadobutrol</b> (1. 0 M) with linear gadopentetate dimeglumine (0. 5 M) for contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of central nervous system (CNS) lesions in Chinese patients (N = 147) with known or suspected CNS lesions, who were enrolled in this single-blind, randomized, parallel-group study. Three blinded independent readers evaluated all efficacy variables. The primary efficacy variable was the difference between the two agents for the change in contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) between non-enhanced and contrast-enhanced scans of lesions. Secondary outcomes included mean change in number of lesions detected before and after contrast enhancement, diagnostic confidence, and safety and tolerability parameters. <b>Gadobutrol</b> was non-inferior to gadopentetate dimeglumine in respect to the difference in the mean change in CNR (6. 94; 95 % confidence interval [CI] lower limit: - 3. 90; predefined maximum 95 % CI lower limit: - 6. 52). The mean change in the number of CNS lesions detected was greater with <b>gadobutrol</b> versus gadopentetate dimeglumine (1. 2 vs. 0. 2 lesions). Diagnostic confidence was classified as ‘high’ for more patients with <b>gadobutrol</b> versus gadopentetate dimeglumine by the investigators (58. 8 % vs. 55. 4 %) and by the three blinded readers (63. 6 % vs. 55. 7 %, 23. 7 % vs. 18. 0 % and 81. 7 % vs. 81. 0 %). Both agents were well tolerated by participating patients. We concluded that in Chinese patients with CNS lesions, <b>gadobutrol</b> (1. 0 M) was as effective and well tolerated in contrast-enhanced MRI as gadopentetate dimeglumine (0. 5 M). <b>Gadobutrol</b> provided improved visualization of CNS lesions compared with gadopentetate dimeglumine, with a comparable tolerability profile...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{perform a}} {{quantitative}} and qualitative comparison of <b>gadobutrol</b> and gadoterate in three-station contrast enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (CE-MRA) of the lower limbs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this prospective randomized controlled trial, 52 patients with leg ischemia {{were randomly assigned to}} one of two groups receiving either <b>gadobutrol</b> (1. 0 mmol Gd/mL, 15 mL) or gadoterate (0. 5 mmol Gd/mL, 30 mL). Three-station 3 D CE-MRAs from the pelvis to the ankles were performed with moving-table technique on a 1. 5 T MR scanner. Injection time was identical in both groups. Signal-to-noise (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratios (CNR) were calculated for 816 arteries. Contrast quality in 1196 vessel segments was evaluated separately by two blinded readers on a three-point scale. RESULTS: Mean SNR (61. 8 +/- 7. 8 for <b>gadobutrol</b> vs. 61. 9 +/- 9. 1 for gadoterate, P = 0. 257), CNR (52. 8 +/- 9. 1 vs. 52. 8 +/- 10. 7, P = 0. 154), and qualitative ranking (1. 41 vs. 1. 44, P = 0. 21) for all vessels did not differ significantly between the two patient groups. The overall quality was good in 90. 4 % with gadoterate and 94. 2 % with <b>gadobutrol</b> (P = 0. 462). CONCLUSION: High-concentration <b>gadobutrol</b> allows neither a higher CNR nor any qualitative advantage over the ordinary unspecific Gd agent gadoterate when the same Gd load and injection times are used in multistation CE-MRA of the peripheral arteries...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{mammalian}} {{target of}} rapamycin (mTOR) pathway has received increasing attention {{as a potential}} antiepileptogenic target. Treatment with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin after status epilepticus reduces the development of epilepsy in a rat model. To study whether rapamycin mediates this effect via restoration of blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction, contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (CE-MRI) {{was used to determine}} BBB permeability throughout epileptogenesis. METHODS: Imaging was repeatedly performed until 6 weeks after kainic acid-induced status epilepticus in rapamycin (6 mg/kg for 6 weeks starting 4 h after SE) and vehicle-treated rats, using <b>gadobutrol</b> as contrast agent. Seizures were detected using video monitoring in the week following the last imaging session. RESULTS: <b>Gadobutrol</b> leakage was widespread and extensive in both rapamycin and vehicle-treated epileptic rats during the acute phase, with the piriform cortex and amygdala as the most affected regions. <b>Gadobutrol</b> leakage was higher in rapamycin-treated rats 4 and 8 days after status epilepticus compared to vehicle-treated rats. However, during the chronic epileptic phase, <b>gadobutrol</b> leakage was lower in rapamycin-treated epileptic rats along with a decreased seizure frequency. This was confirmed by local fluorescein staining in the brains of the same rats. Total brain volume was reduced by this rapamycin treatment regimen. SIGNIFICANCE: The initial slow recovery of BBB function in rapamycin-treated epileptic rats indicates that rapamycin does not reduce seizure activity by a gradual recovery of BBB integrity. The reduced BBB leakage during the chronic phase, however, could contribute to the decreased seizure frequency in post-status epilepticus rats treated with rapamycin. Furthermore, the data show that CE-MRI (using step-down infusion with <b>gadobutrol)</b> can be used as biomarker for monitoring the effect of drug therapy in rats...|$|E
