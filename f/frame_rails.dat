25|$|Its hammer {{action is}} built into a {{removable}} assembly for easy maintenance, after the fashion of the Tokarev TT-30 pistol, whereas its slide rides inside the <b>frame</b> <b>rails,</b> rather than outside as in the traditional Browning pattern. This latter feature mimics the frame-to-receiver interface of its predecessor in Swiss military service, the Luger pistol, allowing for a very tight fit between the slide, barrel and frame without compromising reliability. This construction feature contributes to the unusually high accuracy for which the SIG P210 is known. It ships with a 50-meter (54.7 yd) test target typically showing a group of five to ten shots in a cluster under 5cm (2in) in diameter.|$|E
25|$|On October 24, 1985, Evans, who had {{clinched}} the 1985 National Modified title {{the week before}} at Thompson, was practicing for the Winn-Dixie 500 Modified Feature at Martinsville Speedway in Martinsville, Virginia (the races featured 200-lap Modified and Busch Grand National, and a 100-lap Late Model feature), when he crashed heavily in turn 3. The 44-year-old perished in the accident. The racing world was devastated {{by the loss of}} Richie, but his devoted fans have done much to keep his memory alive. Years later other deaths came in the Whelen Modifieds including Charlie Jarzombek at Martinsville in 1987, Corky Cookman at Thompson in 1987, Don Pratt at the Pocono R.o.C. in 1989 and Tony Jankowiak at Stafford in 1990, occasional competitor and two-time defending track champion Tommy Druar in a Lancaster event in 1989, Tom Baldwin, Sr. at Thompson in 2004, and John Blewett III at Thompson in 2007. As a result, officials made more safety features. Evans' crash, along with other fatal crashes in the late 1980s, led to questions about excessive frame rigidity of the Tour Modifieds, and safety changes resulted. In particular, straight <b>frame</b> <b>rails</b> were phased out, with new chassis required to have a step-up which could bend in hard impacts rather than transmitting all its impact force to the driver.|$|E
2500|$|Introduced in 1996, the P95 {{incorporated}} {{a number of}} changes from earlier P-Series pistols, including a shorter 3.9-in barrel and a new frame made of fiberglass-reinforced polyurethane, based on Dow Chemical's [...] "Isoplast". This reduced {{the weight of the}} pistol by [...] and reduced manufacturing costs. Chambered in 9mm Luger, unlike other polymer-framed handguns on the market at the time of design, the P95 had no metal inserts in the frame. The high-strength polymer allowed the slide to ride directly on the polymer <b>frame</b> <b>rails</b> which simplified manufacturing and further reduced production costs.|$|E
40|$|Series of {{manufacturing}} {{processes such as}} coiling-uncoiling, cold forming and hole cutting processes involved {{in the making of}} truck <b>frame</b> <b>rail</b> sections leave certain amount {{of manufacturing}} imperfections into the <b>frame</b> <b>rail.</b> As the manufacturing imperfections in the form of residual stresses {{play a significant role in}} determining the dynamic structural behavior of truck <b>frame</b> <b>rail</b> members, a careful assessment of residual stresses resulting from coiling-uncoiling and cold forming processes is needed. In the present investigation, non-linear Finite Element (FE) simulation of coiling-uncoiling and cold forming processes were carried out and the resulting residual stresses in <b>frame</b> <b>rail</b> corner, flat web and flange sections were compared with the experimentally measured residual stress values using X-ray diffraction technique. It is observed that in corner sections, the numerically predicted residual stresses are in close agreement with the experimentally measured residual stresses in forming (transverse) direction. In the direction perpendicular to forming (longitudinal direction), while the trends of numerical and experimental residual stresses are observed to follow the same pattern, some deviation in stress values are observed in the inner half of the corner sections. As the coiling-uncoiling process is the main cause for the residual stress presence in flat web and flange sections, the computed coiling-uncoiling residual stresses in longitudinal directions are compared with experimentally measured residual stresses in frame web sections and the trends are observed to be in good agreement...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{large numbers}} of bolt holes cut into truck frame side members act as joineries and points of {{attachments}} for various sub systems of the truck. While these bolt holes are unavoidable due to their primary functional importance, the near hole residual stress resulting from the type of hole cutting operation {{plays a significant role}} in deciding the fatigue performance of <b>frame</b> <b>rail</b> structures. If the residual stress is tensile in nature, this along with the surface roughness at the hole surface can lead to early initiation of fatigue cracks around bolt hole surface. In order to assess the extent of plastic deformation and resulting residual stresses in near hole areas of frame bolt holes cut using drilling, punching, laser cutting and water jet cutting processes, experimental investigation was carried out through microstructure analysis and X-ray diffraction measurements. Apart from this, an assessment of shot-peened hole surface was taken up to understand the effect of shot-peening on fatigue behavior of <b>frame</b> <b>rail</b> section with bolt holes. Also the test specimens extracted from <b>frame</b> <b>rail</b> sections were tested for comparing the fatigue life of specimens having bolt holes cut using different hole cutting operations...|$|R

2500|$|There {{is another}} version of the model J known as the Duesenberg JN (a name never used by the company either). All JNs were sold with Rollston {{coachwork}} and only ten were produced in 1935. In an attempt to give a more modern look to an ageing design, the JN was equipped with smaller -diameter wheels (versus [...] ), skirted fenders, bullet-shaped taillights, and bodies set on the <b>frame</b> <b>rails</b> for a lower look. The battery box and tool box were redesigned slightly so that the doors could close over the frame. Supercharged JNs gained the logical SJN designation.|$|E
2500|$|In 2002, {{a concept}} Bel Air {{convertible}} was {{shown at the}} North American International Auto Show. It features a few styling and design cues from the best remembered tri-five (1955–57) models, such as the chrome windshield frame, traffic light viewfinder, and a gas filler cap behind the tail light, similar to 1956–1957 Chevy's gas cap behind the chrome trim {{on the back of}} the tail fin, but more reminiscent of the 1948–1958 Cadillac gas cap tail light. It also features the same body on frame hydroforming technology (used in the <b>frame</b> <b>rails</b> of the Corvette and GM’s midsize sport-utility vehicles) and a sheet metal body, on a [...] wheelbase, and a [...] track. Suspension is short long arm up front and Hotchkiss drive in the rear. It rides on five-spoke aluminum wheels with [...] red line tires and anti lock discs all-round. The elegant, yet simple interior features a twin-element instrument panel, column-mounted gearshift and bench seats covered in soft high-tech fabrics colored red to match the exterior that are cleverly designed to slide forward for easier backseat entry. It also served as a showcase for their new turbocharged inline five-cylinder concept engine based on the L52 (Vortec 3500), straight-5 truck engine. According to a September 2002 GM press release, the all-aluminum 3.5L (211 cu in) 20-valve DOHC engine, with a bore of 93.0mm (3.7in), and a stroke of 102.0mm (4in), that delivers up to 315 horsepower and [...] of torque, mated to a Hydra-Matic 4L60-E electronically controlled four-speed automatic. A virtual [...] "turbo boost" [...] button on the steering wheel activates the powertrain control module to trigger a more aggressive spark and fueling calibration for maximum horsepower. It also led the 13th Annual Stater Brothers Route 66 Rendezvous as the official vehicle in September 2002. General Motors has shown no interest in producing the car.|$|E
2500|$|The C4 {{represented}} a clean {{break from the}} previous generation of Corvette with a completely new chassis and modern, sleeker styling. Since emissions regulations were still changing and electronic engine management was in its infancy, horsepower was, compared to earlier generations, low. Therefore, the primary design emphasis, {{at least for the}} launch, was on handling and braking, with all-independent suspension with light-weight suspension and wheels, and all new brakes with aluminum calipers. The front suspension saw the C3's coil springs replaced by a transverse fiberglass mono-leaf spring, which was only 1/3 of the weight of the coil springs while also introducing an anti-roll bar-like effect on the front. The price of this no-holds-barred emphasis on handling was ride comfort, especially with the Z51 performance and handling package. The C4 did not use separate body-on-frame construction like its predecessors. [...] Instead, it used what GM termed a [...] "uniframe", which consisted of a traditional perimeter frame, with the door posts, windshield frame, halo, and the rear portion of the floor pan integrated into one welded assembly. [...] This was not a [...] unibody assembly, as none of the exterior body panels were structural members. [...] Due to a styling decision to use a targa top instead of T-tops, there was no structural member tying the windshield frame to the halo as on the C3. [...] This required extremely tall side rails on the frame to maintain chassis rigidity, and as a result, the door sills were quite deep, with entry and exit likened by contemporary auto journals to a [...] "fall in and climb out" [...] experience. [...] The targa top bolted into place, becoming a structural component, rather than simply latching on like T-tops. [...] Despite the tall <b>frame</b> <b>rails,</b> the C4 was prone to rattles and squeaks, especially with the targa top removed. [...] The emergency brake, located between the door sill and the drivers seat, was moved lower and toward the rear of the car in 1988 for easier entry and exit.|$|E

40|$|AbstractA failure {{analysis}} investigation {{was performed on}} a fractured heavy duty truck <b>frame</b> <b>rail</b> obtained during endurance track testing. The fracture observed was on the frame web within the torque rod connection to the rear drive axle of the vehicle. This section of frame experiences multi-axial loading conditions including out-of-plane bending, twisting and shear under road loads. Metallographic examination revealed micro-cracks {{on the edges of}} an open hole located in an area of high stress concentration. This manufacturing defect acted as a stress raiser and resulted in fatigue crack initiation. Simulation of crack growth on <b>frame</b> <b>rail</b> using dynamic loads from a full vehicle model was completed. After careful analysis it was concluded that the failure occurred due to an aggressively drilled open hole which created small crack initiations in a high stress-state location of the frame. This resulted in extensive curvilinear crack growth under dynamic loads of the vehicle...|$|R
