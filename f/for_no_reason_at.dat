5|$|Men with SCI {{rank the}} ability to father {{children}} among their highest concerns relating to sexuality. Male fertility is reduced after SCI, due {{to a combination of}} problems with erections, ejaculation, and quality of the semen. As with other types of sexual response, ejaculation can be psychogenic or reflexogenic, and the level of injury affects a man's ability to experience each type. As many as 95% of men with SCI have problems with ejaculation (anejaculation), possibly due to impaired coordination of input from different parts of the nervous system. Erection, orgasm, and ejaculation can each occur independently, although {{the ability to}} ejaculate seems linked {{to the quality of the}} erection, and the ability to orgasm is linked to the ejaculation facility. Even men with complete injuries may be able to ejaculate, because other nerves involved in ejaculation can effect the response without input from the spinal cord. In general, the higher the level of injury, the more physical stimulation the man needs to ejaculate. Conversely, premature or spontaneous ejaculation can be a problem for men with injuries at levels T12–L1. It can be severe enough that ejaculation is provoked by thinking a sexual thought, or <b>for</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>at</b> all, and is not accompanied by orgasm.|$|E
5|$|The White House's {{most famous}} alleged {{apparition}} {{is that of}} Abraham Lincoln. Eleanor Roosevelt never admitted to having seen Lincoln's ghost, but did say that she felt his presence repeatedly throughout the White House. Mrs. Roosevelt {{also said that the}} family dog, Fala, would sometimes bark <b>for</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>at</b> what she felt was Lincoln's ghost. President Dwight Eisenhower's press secretary, James Hagerty, and Liz Carpenter, press secretary to First Lady Lady Bird Johnson, both said they felt Lincoln's presence many times. The former president's footsteps are also said to be heard in the hall outside the Lincoln Bedroom. As reputable an eyewitness as Lillian Rogers Parks admitted in her autobiography My Thirty Years Backstairs at the White House that she had heard them. Margaret Truman, daughter of President Harry S. Truman, said she heard a specter rapping {{at the door of the}} Lincoln Bedroom when she stayed there, and believed it was Lincoln. President Truman himself was once wakened by raps at the door while spending a night in the Lincoln Bedroom. Others have actually seen an apparition of the former president. The first person reported to have actually seen Lincoln's spirit was First Lady Grace Coolidge, who said she saw the ghost of Lincoln standing at a window in the Yellow Oval Room staring out at the Potomac. Winston Churchill, Theodore Roosevelt, and Maureen Reagan and her husband have all claimed to have seen a spectral Lincoln in the White House. A number of staff members of the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration claimed to have seen Lincoln's spirit, and on one occasion Roosevelt's personal valet ran screaming from the White House claiming he had seen Lincoln's ghost. Perhaps the most famous incident was in 1942 when Queen Wilhelmina of The Netherlands heard footsteps outside her White House bedroom and answered a knock on the door, only to see Lincoln in frock coat and top hat standing in front of her (she promptly fainted). Several unnamed eyewitnesses have claimed to have seen the shade of Abraham Lincoln actually lying down on the bed in the Lincoln Bedroom (which was used as a meeting room at the time of his administration), and others have seen Lincoln sit on the edge of the bed and put his boots on. The most famous eyewitness to the latter was Mary Eben, Eleanor Roosevelt's secretary, who saw Lincoln pulling on his boots (after which she ran screaming from the room).|$|E

25|$|If an {{employer}} {{is said to}} have a high turnover rate relative to its competitors, it means that employees of that company have a shorter average tenure than those of other companies in the same industry. High turnover may be harmful to a company's productivity if skilled workers are often leaving and the worker population contains a high percentage of novices. Companies will often track turnover internally across departments, divisions, or other demographic groups, such as turnover of women versus men. Most companies allow managers to terminate employees at any time, for any reason, or <b>for</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>at</b> all, even if the employee is in good standing. Additionally, companies track voluntary turnover more accurately by presenting parting employees with surveys, thus identifying specific reasons as to why they may be choosing to resign.|$|E
500|$|The Immaculate Collection, Madonna's first greatest-hits {{compilation}} album, {{was released}} in November 1990.

The album was certified diamond by RIAA and sold over 30 million copies worldwide, becoming the best-selling compilation album by a solo artist in history. [...] "Justify My Love" [...] reached {{number one in the}} U.S. becoming her ninth number-one Its music video featured scenes of sadomasochism, bondage, same-sex kissing, and brief nudity. The video was deemed too sexually explicit for MTV and was banned from the network.

2500|$|Justice Rehnquist {{would have}} upheld North Carolina's and Louisiana's {{mandatory}} death penalties. He disputed the historical evidence adduced {{in support of}} the claim that American juries dislike mandatory death penalties. He also felt that the Court's decisions had an analytical flaw. The Court had struck down the mandatory death penalty because it took away discretion from the jury. Yet, Rehnquist pointed out, a jury in Georgia could reject the death penalty <b>for</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>at</b> all. Thus, Georgia's scheme did not alleviate the concerns articulated in Furman about the arbitrariness of the death penalty any more than North Carolina's ignored them. He also disputed whether the appellate review of death sentences inherent in the systems the Court had approved could truly ensure that each death sentence satisfied those concerns. He finally took issue with the idea that the fact that [...] "death is different" [...] requires any extra safeguards in the sentencing process.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{the second}} series {{featured}} an indept storyline (possibly added {{to increase the}} shows praise), and vastly improved digital effects. Some minor aspects which were made in or changed in Season 2 included Rod's appearance being made more memorable by a mullet adorened with lightning bolts shaved into {{the sides of his}} head. Steve is vastly less tolerant to any sign of weakness expressed by his team (possibly due to their failure in Episode 7), often physically abusing them <b>for</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>at</b> all, and losing his apparent ability to appear anywhere to commentate on the team's progress. Kanangra is no longer a factor, but is mentioned in [...] Episode 2 to show Steve's familiarity with councils. The characters were seen talking more, hence we learn that Womp is mostly disliked, Rod and Mephisto have a minor friendship. We also learn that Steve is not the creator of Fistworthiness, having learned it from ancient monks. However, we also learn that Steve was displeased with the peaceful use of Fistworthiness and changed it into his violent version (which is nonetheless proved to be less powerful).|$|E
2500|$|Unlike {{some of his}} contemporaries, Jones {{stuck with}} country music with a vengeance. [...] Jones never reached the top 40 of the Billboard Hot 100 and almost never had any of his music played on {{mainstream}} popular music stations in his career. Ironically, without even trying, Jones' unabashed loyalty to strictly country arrangements attracted the admiration of musicians and songwriters {{from a wide range}} of genres. [...] In an often-quoted tribute, Frank Sinatra called Jones [...] "the second best singer in America". [...] In a Rolling Stone interview in 1969, Bob Dylan was asked what he thought was the best song released in the previous year and he replied, [...] "George Jones had one called 'Small Town Laboring Man'," [...] and in his autobiography Chronicles, Dylan states that in the early 1960s he was largely unimpressed by what he heard on the radio and admits [...] "Outside of maybe George Jones, I didn't listen to country music either." [...] Country rock pioneer Gram Parsons was an avid George Jones fan and covered Jones' song [...] "That's All It Took" [...] on his first solo album. [...] In the documentary Gram Parsons: Fallen Angel, Pamela des Barres recalls seeing Parsons singing Jones' song [...] "She Once Lived Here" [...] at an empty Whiskey A Go Go in Los Angeles: [...] "It was my peak, peak moment, not sitting on Jimmy Page's amp...that was my peak moment." [...] Parsons reignited Keith Richards' interest in country music in the early seventies and after Jones' death in 2013 the guitarist wrote, [...] "He possessed the most touching voice, the most expressive ways of projecting that beautiful instrument of anyone I can call to mind. [...] You heard his heart in every note he sang." [...] Richards recorded [...] "Say It's Not You" [...] with Jones for The Bradley Barn Sessions in 1994 and recalls in his autobiography hearing him sing for the first time when the Rolling Stones and Jones were on the same show in Texas in 1964: [...] "They trailed in with tumbleweed following them, as if tumbleweed was their pet. [...] Dust all over the place, a bunch of cowboys. But when George got up, we went whoa, there's a master up there." [...] In the documentary The History of Rock 'N' Roll, Mick Jagger also cites Jones as one of his favorite country singers. [...] John Prine mentions Jones in his song [...] "Jesus the Missing Years". [...] Jones fan Elvis Costello had a surprise hit in the UK when he covered [...] "A Good Year For The Roses" [...] in 1981. [...] Elliott Smith told an interviewer about his idea of Heaven: [...] "George Jones would be singing all the time. [...] It would be like New York in reverse: people would be nice to each other <b>for</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>at</b> all, and it would smell good." [...] In a 2001 interview with Mark Binelli from Rolling Stone, Leonard Cohen asked, [...] "Have you heard George Jones' last record Cold Hard Truth? [...] I love to hear an old guy lay out his situation. [...] He has the best voice in America," [...] and the day Jones died, Cohen performed [...] "Choices" [...] on stage in Winnipeg, Canada as a tribute to the country legend. [...] In 2013, Robbie Robertson told Uncut, [...] "He was the Ray Charles of country music - the one who could make you cry with his voice...We wouldn't listen to country music, the guys in The Band, but we'd listen to George Jones..." [...] Robert Plant told Uncuts Michael Bonner in 2014, [...] "I now have to listen to George Jones once a day. [...] Amazing singer. [...] What a singer." [...] James Taylor, who wrote [...] "Bartender's Blues" [...] with Jones in mind and sang background vocals with him on the recording, told Rolling Stone, [...] "He sounds like a steel guitar. [...] It's the way he blends notes, the way he comes up to them, the way he crescendos and decrescendos. [...] The dynamic of it is very tight and very controlled - it's like carving with the voice." [...] Other disparate artists who recorded with Jones include Dennis Locorriere and Ray Sawyer of Dr. Hook, Mark Knopfler, the Staples Singers, Leon Russell, B.B King, Blackberry Smoke and Linda Ronstadt. [...] In 1995, Burt Reynolds wrote, [...] "He is to country music what Spencer Tracy is to movies." ...|$|E
