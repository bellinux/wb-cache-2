500|$|One of {{the most}} {{recognisable}} aspects of My Bloody Valentine's music is Shields' guitar sound, which [...] "use texture more than technique to create vivid soundscapes." [...] During the late 1980s, Shields began customising the tremolo systems for his Fender Jaguars and Jazzmasters; extending the tremolo arm and loosening it considerably, {{to allow him to}} manipulate the arm while strumming chords, which resulted in excessive pitch bending. Shields used a number of alternate and open tunings that together with his tremolo manipulation achieved [...] "a strange warping effect that makes the music wander in and out of focus", according to Rolling Stone. Shields' most notable effect is reverse digital reverb, sourced from a Yamaha SPX90 effects unit. Together with the tremolo manipulation and distortion, he created a technique known as [...] "glide guitar". Shields effects rig, which is composed largely of distortion, graphic equalizers and tone controls, consists of at least 30 effects pedals and is connected to a large amount of amplifiers, which are often set to maximum volume to increase sustain. During live performances, and in particular the closing song [...] "You Made Me Realise", My Bloody Valentine perform an interlude of noise and excessive feedback, known as [...] "the holocaust", which would last for half an hour and often reached 130db. Shields later remarked [...] "it was so loud it was like sensory deprivation. We <b>just</b> <b>liked</b> the fact that we could see a change in the audience at a certain point." ...|$|E
500|$|The music video's {{theme is}} multiplicity. Mor {{said that the}} idea [...] "was {{essentially}} trying to reduce what the song is about to symbols.

[...] The video opens with intercalated beauty shots of will.i.am and Spears, until the scene cuts to will.i.am using his iPhone camera add-on and social network iam+. will.i.am says [...] "bring the action", and Spears is seen wearing a skin-tight skirt and a long-sleeved top with bare midriff and cleavage. Spears performs fast movements to the song's beat and sings the lyrics. She is then seen atop a white box and posing to the camera. When the track's chorus begins, will.i.am appears {{in front of an}} empty black background and is joined by Spears, who is now wearing a corseted leotard accented with feathers, standing on a moving walkway, and they sing together. After the first [...] "Britney, bitch" [...] line is heard, dancers perform to [...] "Scream & Shout". The video cuts to intercalated scenes of flaming disco balls, Spears image multiplied, and will.i.am wearing several gold accessories, including a cap with a gold plate that reads 'King'. Mor said that the video has no narrative, and that, [...] "there's no deep meaning to any of it...To me it was just about, you know, every scene is like a photo. I <b>just</b> <b>liked</b> it, I liked seeing the human heads, and I liked seeing the gold chains off of the plaques and then making it scroll. And then it was an awesome way to introduce characters, some friends of will...so that it wasn't just about them."
