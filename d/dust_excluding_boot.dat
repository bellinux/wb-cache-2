I argue that the broader and narrower readings of a single lexical form can be treated as polysemous senses {{to the extent that}} they exhibit some symptoms of autonomy as contextually construed sense units. However, as some vertical polysemes’ senses also exhibit symptoms of unity, they fall in between ambiguity and vagueness. As word senses are here defined as contextually construed units of meaning, their autonomy is considered independently from their conventionality. However, a corpus study of pairs of words with a dual inclusion/contrast relationship (including 'shoe/boot', 'cup/mug', 'dog/bitch', 'meat/chicken' and 'dog/puppy') suggests that even senses that exhibit a low degree of autonomy may nevertheless be conventionalised...|$|R

40|$|A dark {{region of}} tens of {{kilometres}} width is present on the western ablation zone of the Greenland ice sheet. The dark appearance is caused by higher amounts of dust. This dust has either been deposited recently or {{was brought to the}} surface by outcropping ice. Because the resulting lower albedos may {{have a significant effect on}} melt rates, we analysed surface dust, also called cryoconite, from locations in the dark region as well as locations from the brighter surrounding reference ice with microscopic and geochemical techniques to unravel the composition and origin. We find that (part of) the material indeed crops out from the ice, and that there is little difference between dust from the dark region and from the reference ice. Although, the dust from the dark region seems enriched in trace and minor elements that are mainly present in the current atmosphere because of anthropogenic activity. This enrichment is probably caused by higher precipitation and lower melt rates in the dark region relative to the ice marginal zone. The rare earth elemental ratios of the investigated material are approximately the same for all sites and resemble Earths average crust composition. Therefore, the cryoconite does probably not contain volcanic material. The mineralogical composition of the <b>dust</b> <b>excludes</b> Asian deserts, which are often found as provenance for glacial dust in ice cores, as source regions. Consequently, the outcropping dust likely has a more regional origin. Finally, we find cyanobacteria and algae in the cryoconite. Total Organic Carbon accounts for up to 5 weight percentage of the cryoconite from the dark region, whereas dust samples from the reference ice contain only 1 % or less. This organic material is likely formed in situ. Because of their high light absorbency, cyanobacteria and the organic material they produce, contribute significantly to the low albedo of the dark region...|$|R
40|$|The Keck Interferometer Nuller (KIN) {{was used}} to survey 25 nearby main {{sequence}} stars in the mid-infrared, {{in order to assess}} the prevalence of warm circumstellar (exozodiacal) dust around nearby solar-type stars. The KIN measures circumstellar emission by spatially blocking the star but transmitting the circumstellar flux in a region typically 0. 1 - 4 AU from the star. We find one significant detection (eta Crv), two marginal detections (gamma Oph and alpha Aql), and 22 clear non-detections. Using a model of our own Solar System's zodiacal cloud, scaled to the luminosity of each target star, we estimate the equivalent number of target zodis needed to match our observations. Our three zodi detections are eta Crv (1250 +/- 260), gamma Oph (200 +/- 80) and alpha Aql (600 +/- 200), where the uncertainties are 1 -sigma. The 22 non-detected targets have an ensemble weighted average consistent with zero, with an average individual uncertainty of 160 zodis (1 -sigma). These measurements represent the best limits to date on exozodi levels for a sample of nearby main sequence stars. A statistical analysis of the population of 23 stars not previously known to contain circumstellar <b>dust</b> (<b>excluding</b> eta Crv and gamma Oph) suggests that, if the measurement errors are uncorrelated (for which we provide evidence) and if these 23 stars are representative of a single class with respect to the level of exozodi brightness, the mean exozodi level for the class is < 150 zodis (3 -sigma upper-limit, corresponding to 99 % confidence under the additional assumption that the measurement errors are Gaussian). We also demonstrate that this conclusion is largely independent of the shape and mean level of the (unknown) true underlying exozodi distribution...|$|R

The pretransitional disk around the Herbig star HD 169142 exhibits multi-gap disk structure, differentiated gas and dust distribution, planet candidates, and near-infrared fading in the past decades, which make it a valuable target for a case study of disk evolution. Using near-infrared interferometric observations with VLTI/PIONIER, we aim to study the dust properties in the inner sub-au region of the disk in the years 2011 - 2013, when the object is already in its near-infrared faint state. We first performed simple geometric modeling to characterize {{the size and shape of}} the NIR-emitting region. We then performed Monte-Carlo radiative transfer simulations on grids of models and compared the model predictions with the interferometric and photometric observations.

The sources of silica dust may arise from air supply to emplacement drifts as well as host rock around emplacement drifts. For this calculation, the source of dust is conservatively assumed to be the host rock (Assumption 3. 6), which is subject to long-term neutron exposure resulting in saturated radioactivity.

Results from a {{historical}} prospective cohort study on Norwegian {{pulp and paper}} workers showed {{a significant increase in}} risk of lung cancer, pleural mesothelioma, colon cancer and malignant melanomas among men, compared to the Norwegian population. The risk of lung cancer was highest among sulphite mill workers. The risk of pleural mesothelioma was highest among maintenance workers with asbestos exposure. Most of the increased risk in lung cancer can be explained by a combination of smoking habits and asbestos use, although an effect of other work-related exposures (sulfur and chloride compounds, wood <b>dust)</b> cannot be <b>excluded.</b> Among the female part of the cohort we found a significant excess in risk of ovarian cancer.

Some open-bolt designs can suffer from {{a condition in which}} bolt retention fails and the weapon discharges even with no trigger input. Open-bolt machine guns could not be synchronized to fire through the arc of a propeller due to the relatively long period between sear disengagement and the ignition of the cartridge, making them harder to use as forward-firing weapons on tractor configuration fighter aircraft. Accuracy can suffer somewhat in an open-bolt design, again due to the longer delay between pulling the trigger and primer ignition, but this is generally less of a concern in automatic weapons, since after the first shot, the operation is indistinguishable from a firearm that fires from a closed bolt. It is only when the trigger is released that the bolt is caught in the rearward position; during automatic fire, both types of bolts are free to operate at full rate, without hindrance. As most open-bolt guns are automatics, generally only weapons, such as submachine guns, converted to semi-automatic operation suffer from this.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Hawaii at Manoa, 2008. All {{of these}} four {{features}} are weaker over USA and the surrounding oceans than in Mexico. Clouds affect the Earth's energy balance by reflecting incoming sunlight and trapping outgoing heat. It has been hypothesized that various cloud properties (e. g., reflectivity, coverage, lifetime and precipitation efficiency) partly depend on the number concentration of aerosols that serve as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) during cloud growth. The CCN number varies widely throughout the world over time, and is poorly known. Therefore, a means to convert satellite derived aerosol optical properties to CCN concentration would help evaluate this important indirect effect of aerosols on radiation balance. In order to assess whether remote sensing of CCN is feasible, this dissertation explores the relationships among aerosol size distribution, chemical composition and optical properties measured during aircraft experiments over USA and Mexico. The aircraft data illuminate four reasons why remote sensing of CCN concentration can potentially achieve a small relative error (< 20 %) over Mexico. First, many pollution particles are large enough to significantly affect light extinction. They even dominate it in absence of dust. Consequently, the correlation between extinction and CCN number is high, once the extinction due to <b>dust</b> is <b>excluded</b> using the wavelength dependence of extinction. Second, the ambient humidity is usually low, which reduces the error in the estimated response of particle extinction to humidity changes. Third, because many CCN contain black carbon, light absorption also provides {{a measure of the}} CCN concentration. The fourth reason is pertinent to the chemical properties of CCN. The organic fraction of volatile mass of submicron particles (OMF) was found to be anti-correlated with the wavelength dependence of extinction. This anti-correlation provides a potential tool for remote-sensing not only OMF but also the CCN activity, if the relationship between these two properties is tight and known. The concurrent aircraft measurement of aerosol size distribution suggests that the observed anti-correlation reflects preferential uptake of anion (sulfate and nitrate) by coarse dust. This chemical action may significantly reduce solubility of accumulation-mode particles and, consequently, CCN concentration. Includes bibliographical references (leaves 184 - 202).

40|$|International audienceA {{large number}} of {{published}} and unpublished measurements of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentrations and aerosol optical thickness (AOT) measurements have been analyzed. AOT measurements were obtained mostly from the AERONET network, and selected to be collocated {{as closely as possible}} to the CCN investigations. In remote marine regions, CCN 0. 4 (CCN at a supersaturation of 0. 4 %) are around 110 cm ? 3 and the mean AOT 500 (AOT at 500 nm) is 0. 057. Over remote continental areas, CCN are almost twice as abundant, while the mean AOT 500 is ca. 0. 075. (Sites dominated by desert <b>dust</b> plumes were <b>excluded</b> from this analysis.) Some, or maybe even most of this difference must be because even remote continental sites are in closer proximity to pollution sources than remote marine sites. This suggests that the difference between marine and continental levels must have been smaller before the advent of anthropogenic pollution. Over polluted marine and continental regions, the CCN concentrations are about one magnitude higher than over their remote counterparts, while AOT is about five times higher over polluted than over clean regions. The average CCN concentrations from all studies show a remarkable correlation to the corresponding AOT values, which can be expressed as a power law. This can be very useful for the parameterization of CCN concentrations in modeling studies, as it provides an easily measured proxy for this variable, which is difficult to measure directly. It also implies that, at least at large scales, the radiative and microphysical effects of aerosols on cloud physics are correlated and not free to vary independently. While this strong empirical correlation is remarkable, it must still be noted that that there is about a factor-of-four range of CCN concentrations at a given AOT, and that there remains considerable room for improvement in remote sensing techniques for measuring CCN abundance...|$|R

The dusts {{are mainly composed of}} mineral grains in addition to a considerable amount of organic material, {{especially in the case of}} the dusts deposited in summer. The magnetic susceptibility of these modern dusts is generally higher than that of glacial loess, and in addition they show clear seasonal variations with maximum values in the summer dust and minimum values in the winter dust. Assuming that pollution effects on modern <b>dust</b> can be <b>excluded,</b> this implies that the high susceptibility values of Quaternary paleosols may arise either from the direct effect of climate on the baseline susceptibility of the raw dust or from further enhancement by post-depositional pedogenesis. The pattern of seasonal dust flux shows that most of the total annual dust deposition is generated by continuous deposition throughout the year rather than by dust storms in specific seasons; however, the flux does exhibit seasonal variability with highest flux occurring in spring or early summer, especially in the northern Loess Plateau. The grain-size distribution of modern dust shows a positive-skewed asymmetrical pattern that is analogous to Quaternary loess. Seasonal variations in dust grain size are characterized by coarsening in spring and summer and by fining in autumn and winter. At a specific site the dust grain-size strongly depends on height above the local ground surface and decreases nonlinearly with increasing height. On the basis of vertical profiles, spatial trends and the seasonal variability of dust flux and grain size, we infer that modern dust, and thus Quaternary loess, is mostly transported at a low level of the atmosphere throughout the year with intensified dust deposition in spring and early summer...|$|R

Seven different fire emission inventories are applied independently to WRF-Chem model (v 3. 5) with the same model configuration (<b>excluding</b> <b>dust</b> and other emission sources) over the northern sub-Saharan African (NSSA) biomass-burning region. Results for November and February 2010 are analyzed, respectively representing the start and end of the biomass burning season in the study region. For February 2010, estimates of total smoke emission vary by a factor of 12, but only differences by factors of 7 or less are found in the simulated regional (15 degrees W- 42 degrees E, 13 degrees S- 17 degrees N) and monthly averages of column PM 2. 5 loading, surface PM 2. 5 concentration, aerosol optical depth (AOD), smoke radiative forcing at the top-of-atmosphere and at the surface, and air temperature at 2 m and at 700 hPa. The smaller differences in these simulated variables may reflect the atmospheric diffusion and deposition effects to dampen the large difference in smoke emissions that are highly concentrated in areas much smaller than the regional domain of the study. Indeed, at the local scale, large differences (up to a factor of 33) persist in simulated smoke-related variables and radiative effects including semi-direct effect. Similar results are also found for November 2010, despite differences in meteorology and fire activity. Hence, biomass burning emission uncertainties have a large influence on the reliability of model simulations of atmospheric aerosol loading, transport, and radiative impacts, and this influence is largest at local and hourly-to-daily scales. Accurate quantification of smoke effects on regional climate and air quality requires further reduction of emission uncertainties, particularly for regions of high fire concentrations such as NSSA...|$|R

Approaching actual wear testing of mechanical components, it is beneficial to first establish relative wear rates caused by dust on commonly used mechanical component materials.

We also observe (i) large [Zn/Fe] values (>+ 0. 6) and sub-solar Ti/Fe ratios which imply substantial differential depletion, (ii) large a/Fe ratios suggesting nucleosynthetic enrichment by massive stars, and (iii) low C^ 0 /C^+ ratios (< 10 ^{- 4 }). Quantitatively, the observed depletion levels and C^ 0 /C^+ ratios of the gas are not characteristic of cold, dense HI clouds in the Galactic ISM. We argue that the GRB-DLAs represent the ISM near the GRB but not gas directly local to the GRB (e. g. its molecular cloud or circumstellar material). We compare these observations with DLAs intervening background quasars (QSO-DLAs). The GRB-DLAs exhibit larger N(HI) values, higher a/Fe and Zn/Fe ratios, and have higher metallicity than the QSO-DLAs. We argue that the differences primarily result from galactocentric radius-dependent differences in the ISM: GRB-DLAs preferentially probe denser, more depleted, higher metallicity gaslocated in the inner few kpc whereas QSO-DLAs {{are more likely to}} intersect the less dense, less enriched, outer regions of the galaxy. Finally, we investigate whether <b>dust</b> obscuration may <b>exclude</b> GRB-DLA sightlines from QSO-DLA samples; we find that the majority of GRB-DLAs would be recovered which implies little observational bias against large N(HI) systems.

40|$|A {{large number}} of {{published}} and unpublished measurements of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentrations and aerosol optical thickness (AOT) measurements have been analyzed. AOT measurements were obtained mostly from the AERONET network, and selected to be collocated {{as closely as possible}} to the CCN investigations. In remote marine regions, CCN 0. 4 (CCN at a supersaturation of 0. 4 %) are around 110 cm − 3 and the mean AOT 500 (AOT at 500 nm) is 0. 057. Over remote continental areas, CCN are almost twice as abundant, while the mean AOT 500 is ca. 0. 075. (Sites dominated by desert <b>dust</b> plumes were <b>excluded</b> from this analysis.) Some, or maybe even most of this difference must be because even remote continental sites are in closer proximity to pollution sources than remote marine sites. This suggests that the difference between marine and continental levels must have been smaller before the advent of anthropogenic pollution. Over polluted marine and continental regions, the CCN concentrations are about one order of magnitude higher than over their remote counterparts, while AOT is about five times higher over polluted than over clean regions. The average CCN concentrations from all studies show a remarkable correlation to the corresponding AOT values, which can be expressed as a power law. This can be very useful for the parameterization of CCN concentrations in modeling studies, as it provides an easily measured proxy for this variable, which is difficult to measure directly. It also implies that, at least at large scales, the radiative and microphysical effects of aerosols on cloud physics are correlated and not free to vary fully independently. While the observed strong empirical correlation is remarkable, it must still be noted that there is about a factor-of-four range of CCN concentrations at a given AOT, and that there remains considerable room for improvement in remote sensing techniques for CCN abundance...|$|R
40|$|The {{microbial}} community dominates biogeochemical cycling of the ocean, affecting global climate. The impact of physical disturbance of near surface microbial populations was {{studied in the}} northeastern tropical and subtropical Atlantic Ocean. This region lies beneath easterly trade winds, resulting in strong perturbations in terms of wind driven mixing and Aeolian dust deposition. Firstly, the region’s surface water bacterioplankton community was compared with adjacent regions in terms of metabolic activity, by measuring the uptake rates of radioactively labelled amino acids (3 H-leucine and 35 S-methionine) {{as a proxy for}} bacterial production. Remarkably, there was little variation in uptake rates between the two Atlantic (sub-) tropical gyres. Rates reflected regional photosynthetic biomass, except in the study region. The bacterioplankton community of this region was less metabolically active than that of the oligotrophic north Atlantic gyre, despite ocean colour data identifying the region as productive. The region’s uniqueness is probably related to the episodic Saharan dust inputs experienced. To test whether dust deposition controls {{microbial community}} structure, surface communities were compared, using flow cytometry and fluorescence in situ hybridisation, between two winter periods when either wind-driven mixing or dust deposition occurred. Wind-driven mixing was associated with domination by the ubiquitous SAR 11 clade of Alphaproteobacteria, whereas key primary producers, Prochlorococcus cyanobacteria, numerically dominated during calmer conditions. Phytoplankton-associated Bacteroidetes and Synechococcus cyanobacteria were most abundant during turbulent conditions. Gammaproteobacteria, encompassing opportunistic species, were the only group to benefit from dust inputs; thus dust deposition seems to have a minor influence on the region’s bacterioplankton community compared to wind mixing, suggesting community change following dust storm events may be linked to nutrients delivered by wind mixing, as much as from dust. To test further whether changes in the SAR 11 and Prochlorococcus populations varied between years due to wind- or dust-related perturbation, a method based on 35 S-methionine uptake was developed for measuring the metabolic response of these groups to Aeolian <b>dust,</b> whilst <b>excluding</b> wind impacts. Subsurface seawater samples were treated with freshly collected dust, added directly or indirectly as a “leachate” after its rapid dissolution in deionised water. Prochlorococcus and SAR 11 cells were sorted by flow cytometry to determine their group-specific responses. Both Prochlorococcus and SAR 11 were metabolically impaired by the addition of dust, which may explain the low metabolic activity observed in the region (mentioned above). Although SAR 11 showed minor positive responses to dust leachate additions, leachate proved detrimental to Prochlorococcus. Thus dust dissolution in situ appears to be more deleterious to Prochlorococcus than SAR 11 and hence could initiate a compositional shift in the indigenous bacterioplankton, suggesting the observed switch from SAR 11 - to Prochlorococcus-domination following dust deposition (mentioned above) was indeed a result of an alternative stimulus, most likely wind stress. In conclusion, whereas dust deposition may prove beneficial to bacterioplankton species with high nutrient demands, such as some Gammaproteobacteria, it does not appear to affect the ambient dominant bacterioplankton groups of the northeast (sub-) tropical Atlantic to the same degree as wind-driven perturbations. Furthermore, large dust deposition events may prove detrimental to ambient populations, resulting in low community metabolic activity. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|We present SHARC-II 350 um imaging {{of twelve}} 24 um-bright (F_ 24 um > 0. 8 mJy) Dust-Obscured Galaxies (DOGs) and CARMA 1 mm imaging of {{a subset of}} 2 DOGs, all {{selected}} from the Bootes field of the NOAO Deep Wide-Field Survey. Detections of 4 DOGs at 350 um imply IR luminosities which are consistent within a factor of 2 of expectations based on a warm dust spectral energy distribution (SED) scaled to the observed 24 um flux density. The 350 um upper limits for the 8 non-detected DOGs are consistent with both Mrk 231 and M 82 (warm <b>dust</b> SEDs), but <b>exclude</b> cold <b>dust</b> (Arp 220) SEDs. The two DOGs targeted at 1 mm were not detected in our CARMA observations, placing strong constraints on the dust temperature: T_dust > 35 - 60 K. Assuming these dust properties apply to the entire sample, we find dust masses of ~ 3 x 10 ^ 8 M_sun. In comparison to other dusty z ~ 2 galaxy populations such as sub-millimeter galaxies (SMGs) and other Spitzer-selected high-redshift sources, this sample of DOGs has higher IR luminosities (2 x 10 ^ 13 L_sun vs. 6 x 10 ^ 12 L_sun for the other galaxy populations), warmer dust temperatures (> 35 - 60 K vs. ~ 30 K), and lower inferred dust masses (3 x 10 ^ 8 M_sun vs. 3 x 10 ^ 9 M_sun). Herschel and SCUBA- 2 surveys {{should be able to}} detect hundreds of these power-law dominated DOGs. We use HST and Spitzer/IRAC data to estimate stellar masses of these sources and find that the stellar to gas mass ratio may be higher in our 24 um-bright sample of DOGs than in SMGs and other Spitzer-selected sources. Although larger sample sizes are needed to provide a definitive conclusion, the data are consistent with an evolutionary trend in which the formation of massive galaxies at z~ 2 involves a sub-millimeter bright, cold-dust and star-formation dominated phase followed by a 24 um-bright, warm-dust and AGN-dominated phase.

40|$|In {{the last}} two decades astronomers carried out a large number of galaxy surveys tuned towards the study of galaxy {{formation}} and evolution. With the ever improving technology, increasing telescope sizes of ground-based telescopes and the development of space-based telescopes it has become possible to detect galaxies {{at a time when the}} Universe was only a few hundred million years old. However, for the majority of galaxies a detailed spectroscopic analysis is not possible due to their distance and limited telescope time. Thus, many surveys rely on photometric data alone to help unveil the properties of galaxies. One of the most important areas of study within galaxy formation and evolution is the analysis of the galaxy stellar population parameters as these can provide us with information about the star formation histories of galaxies and when and possibly how they assembled their mass. A popular approach in the literature is the fitting of synthetic spectral energy distributions inferred from stellar population modelling to the multi-wavelength photometry of galaxies. However, this approach comes with a large number of fitting parameters all of which are essentially user-dependent and will bias the result in one way or another. The aim of this thesis is to investigate the accuracy and efficiency of spectral energy distribution fitting as derivation technique for the galaxy physical properties, such as age, stellar mass, dust reddening, etc., as a function of the fitting parameters, such as star formation histories, age grids, metallicity, initial mass function, dust reddening, reddening law, filter setup and wavelength coverage and stellar population model, and to find the setup of parameters that recovers the properties best. In particular, we investigate in detail the dependence of the derived properties on the assumed wavelength coverage and exact filter setups. Mock galaxies with known properties serve as test particles for this exercise. The synthetic spectral energy distributions used in this thesis are based on the Maraston (2005) stellar population models. Literature results which investigate similar problems are obtained using the models of Bruzual & Charlot (2003). Firstly, the fitting is carried out under the assumption that galaxy redshifts are known mimicking surveys for which galaxy redshifts are derived spectroscopically. Then we study the case in which the redshift is not known and needs to be determined alongside the galaxy physical properties which is the case for most photometric surveys. In general, we find that - using normal template star formation histories as widely used in the literature - ages and stellar masses of star-forming galaxies are underestimated, reddening and star formation rates are overestimated. This is due to a mismatch in star formation history and the overshining effect. The addition of the rest-frame near-IR appears to be crucial for the derivation of robust results. For aged galaxies with little or no on-going star formation we find that a setup covering a wide range of star formation histories and metallicities works best when the fit is carried out <b>excluding</b> <b>dust</b> reddening. For high redshift star-forming galaxies we find that a new type of star formation history (inverted-� models which start forming stars at high redshift) recovers stellar masses and star formation rates best. The parameters of truly passive galaxies are much better determined. In order to ease the comparison of literature data that was analysed with different fitting parameter setups we provide scaling relations for the transformation of stellar masses between different setups. Our results concerning the importance of the wavelength coverage in the fitting are particularly useful for the planning of future surveys and observation proposals. We apply our findings from the study of mock galaxies to various samples of real galaxies which cover different redshift ranges and galaxy types. We derive the stellar population properties for a sample of star-forming galaxies at z ∼ 2 from the GOODS-S survey using inverted-� models (with high formation redshifts) and show that the obtained dust reddening and star formation histories are in excellent agreement with those derived from other methods. We also show how the wrong set of fitting parameters can lead to unrealistically young ages, low stellar masses and high star formation rates which are a pure artefact from the fit. Furthermore, we study a sample of low redshift, predominantly passive galaxies from the SDSS-III/BOSS survey for which we use the spectral model of Maraston et al. (2009) that is tuned to the needs of this particular type of galaxies. We find that BOSS galaxies are mostly passive, old and massive at each redshift in the range 0 < z < 0. 7. Finally, we complement the study of SDSS-III/BOSS galaxies by deriving stellar masses for the SDSS-I/II galaxies in a similar fashion. We conclude that the simultaneous derivation of stellar population properties of galaxies from spectral energy distribution fitting is difficult but that these properties can be very well derived provided the right setup and wavelength coverage are used in the fitting. We also conclude that more work is needed to better match star formation histories of aged galaxies with little on-going star formation in order to improve estimates of stellar population parameters.
