40|$|Stress-strain {{curves of}} sheet metals at high strain rates, say 700 S- 1, are determined. Laminated plates are {{compressed}} dynamically by a modified split Hopkinson pressure bar system. Plate specimens are from either an aluminium sheet or a thin tube cut-open followed by <b>flat-rolling.</b> The mean flow stress {{at a given}} strain is generally affected by both the strain-rate and the friction between the specimen and tools. In the first place, therefore, the specimens with various heights are tested under almost a same constant strain-rate history. Secondly, the intrinsic flow stress is determined by applying an extrapolation method to the above test results in order to eliminate the effect of friction. With these procedures, the high strain-rate stress-strain curves of commercially pure aluminium sheets are reasonably obtained...|$|R

40|$|The {{research}} examines a {{case study}} {{carried out in the}} Southern Italy where at-grade three-leg and four-leg intersections with stop control on the minor roads were investigated {{from the point of view}} of level of service LOS and crash phenomena. The main scope is to explore how a set of methods can be applied sequentially to check whether improvements to LOS, in terms of control delays and 95 th percentile of the queues length distribution, and safety, in terms of number of expected crashes during a study period, can be achieved by improving the existing geometric configurations. The intersections investigated belong to a two-lane rural road network under low-volume conditions and they are located on a <b>flat-rolling</b> terrain. They have been built before National Standard became law. A total of 89 typical intersections were investigated and 550 crashes were observed over a period of 5 years (2005 - 2010). As first step, a crash level was associated with each site according to methodology based on the crash rate evaluation. Further step was focused on main three intersections characterized by high crash rate level. Comparisons in terms of LOS and number of crashes were carried out between existing configurations and new geometric solutions (I option: adjustment of the existing intersections to Standards by adopting left-turn lanes, right-turn lanes, median-refuge islands, lighting; II option: changing the shape into a roundabout). The results confirmed that both geometric solutions are reliable to improve LOS and reduce the crash cost but the roundabout is the best solution...|$|R

40|$|Pnictide superconductors {{will be very}} {{promising}} for applications if wires with high critical current density Jc can allow reel-to-reel large-scale fabrication at low costs. To understand the mechanism(s) that limited Jc in <b>flat-rolled</b> Sr 0. 6 K 0. 4 Fe 2 As 2 (Sr 122) tapes, microstructure analysis has been considered the most direct and efficient way. Here, we report on high-resolution microstructure imaging and analysis on Fe-sheathed <b>flat-rolled</b> Sr 122 tapes, which have a Jc as high as 2. 3 × 104 A/cm 2 at 10 T and 4. 2 K. The overlapping nature of the Sr 122 plates was clearly observed. Transmission electron microscopy/scanning transmission electron microscopy analysis showed that, besides the cracks formed during the fabrication process, the SrO 2 phase and cavities caused by the inhomogeneously dispersed Sr and K are the other important factors suppressing Jc. The wetting phase FeAs at the grain boundaries can be partially substituted by Sn in Sn-added samples. Our findings provide insights that {{pave the way to}} further enhance the critical current of the rolled 122 tapes up to the practical level...|$|E

40|$|This dispute {{concerns}} the measures China took {{to implement the}} Dispute Settlement Body’s rulings in China–GOES (DS 414), which had found a number of violations with respect to China’s antidumping and countervailing duties imposed on grain oriented <b>flat-rolled</b> electrical steel (GOES) imported from the United States. In this compliance proceeding, the United States claimed that the Redetermination issued by China’s Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) continued to violate WTO law. At {{the center of the}} dispute were MOFCOM’s findings that the US imports had the effect of suppressing and/or depressing the prices of domestic like products. While the Panel reached the conclusion that the MOFCOM findings were inconsistent with WTO rules, it did not clarify the criteria for determining such price effects.

30|$|Steel is the {{material}} of choice for a large number and very diverse industrial applications. Surface qualities along with other properties {{are the most important}} quality parameters, particularly for <b>flat-rolled</b> steel products. Traditional manual surface inspection procedures are awfully inadequate to ensure guaranteed quality-free surface. To ensure stringent requirements of customers, automated vision-based steel surface inspection techniques {{have been found to be}} very effective and popular during the last two decades. Considering its importance, this paper attempts to make the first formal review of state-of-art of vision-based defect detection and classification of steel surfaces as they are produced from steel mills. It is observed that majority of research work has been undertaken for cold steel strip surfaces which is most sensitive to customers' requirements. Work on surface defect detection of hot strips and bars/rods has also shown signs of increase during the last 10  years. The review covers overall aspects of automatic steel surface defect detection and classification systems using vision-based techniques. Attentions have also been drawn to reported success rates along with issues related to real-time operational aspects.|$|E
40|$|Increase of {{requirements}} to {{quality of the}} <b>flat-rolled</b> steel causes the appearance of new methods and im-provement of the well-known approaches to improving the geometry of thin-gage rolled steels. On modern rolling mills, control {{and management of the}} strips cross-section is carried out by a profile and flatness control system (PFC). The main channel of the influence of such systems on the geometric parameters of the rolled steel is the axial shifting of S-shaped working rolls in CVC (Continuous Variable Crown) mills. The performance of the PFC is determined by the correct choice of the initial (machining) profile of the working rolls. The paper discusses the way to improve the meth-odology of grinding S-shaped working rolls by taking into account the thermal deformations, arising from the contact with the hot strip. The mathematical model of the thermal condition of S-shaped rolls,which allows to predict the change of the roll’s thermal profile, gives the possibility to create the algorithm for the grinding of the working rolls in hot condition and increase the accuracy of performance of their machining profile...|$|E
40|$|International audienceNumerical {{simulation}} is used {{to study}} patented high-C steel <b>flat-rolled</b> wire cold forming processes. An elasto-plastic power law, identified from mechanical tests, is used into Forge 2005 ® finite element (FEM) package in order to describe the material behaviour during wire drawing followed by cold rolling. A through-process approach has been favoured, transferring residual wire-drawing stresses and strain into the flat-rolling preform. This mechanical analysis, associated with a triaxiality study, points to dangerous areas where fracture may initiate due to high tensile stresses. Lemaître's isotropic damage criterion, including crack closure effect, a - 1 / 3 cut-off value of stress triaxiality, and tension/compression damage asymmetry, has been used and has confirmed the previous analysis. A number of non-coalesced voids nucleated on inclusions have been observed in the Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), especially in high-deformation zones ("blacksmith's cross"). Their evolution has been simulated in the FEM model using spherical numerical markers, which deform into oblate or prolate ellipsoids. The deformation-induced morphological evolution of voids observed in the SEM compares well with the geometrical evolution of the markers, {{which suggests that the}} morphologies observed do not result from micro-crack propagation, but from material transport of the nucleated voids...|$|E
40|$|Scrap {{iron and}} steel has long been {{considered}} a resource in the steel-making industry, and its value is largely determined by its impurity content. As the mini-mills, the major consumers of scrap {{iron and steel}}, expand into producing <b>flat-rolled</b> sheet, the demand for high-quality scrap will increase. Of the impurities present in scrap, copper is particularly troublesome because of its role in causing hot shortness. Therefore, the copper content of scrap should be kept below {approx} 0. 1 wt%. A method for removing copper from steel {{could be used to}} improve the quality of scrap and make it more available for use by mini-mills. To determine the effectiveness of a binary slag consisting of aluminum sulfide and iron sulfide on the removal of copper from steel and iron, the distribution coefficient of copper between the slag and a carbon-saturated iron melt was investigated at 1, 365 C. The composition of the slag was varied from nearly pure aluminum sulfide to pure iron sulfide.

40|$|Irradiations {{were made}} on small {{specimens}} of U- 5 wt. % Zr- 1. 5 wt. % Nb alloy {{with a wide variety}} of fabrication histories and heat treatments in order to determine the optimum heat treatment for the fuel plates for the Experimental Boiling Water Reactor (EBW). In the time available, a heat treatment could not be found which simultaneously conferred dimensional stability and corrosion resistance to the alloy. The most effective heat treatment for dimensionally stabilizing swaged or round-rolled material was a 24 -hr isothermal transformation from the gamma phase at 650 deg C. This heat treatment was subsequently used as a basis for the heat-treatment specifications for the EBWR fuel plates. In later studies on specimens cut from plates it was learned that the alloy could be adequately stabilized against irradiation growth and also made corrosion- resistent by first reducing the plate 12 % in thickness by cold rolling followed by a 24 -hr isothermal transformation from the gamma phase at 665 deg C, and finally quenching from 800 deg C. Irradiation growth rates of plate specimens were effectively reduced by the presence of metallurgically bonded Zircaloy- 2 cladding. <b>Flat-rolled</b> material under irradiation generally increased in length and width and decreased in thickness.
