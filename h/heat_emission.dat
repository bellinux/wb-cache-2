The ongoing global warming means that heat has been accumulating since 1880, in air, ground, and water.

Such emissions, from e. g. the global use of fossil fuel and nuclear power, must contribute to global warming. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare globally accumulated and emitted heat. The heat accumulated in air corresponds to 6. 6 % of the global warming, while the remaining heat is stored in the ground (31. 5 %), melting of ice (33. 4 %), and sea water (28. 5 %). It was found that the net <b>heat</b> <b>emissions</b> 1880 - 2000 correspond to 74 % of accumulated heat, i. e. the global warming, during the same period.

40|$|Although {{global warming}} is scientifically accepted, its cause is still disputed.

Global warming means that heat has been accumulating in air, ground, and water since 1880.

A comparison of accumulated and emitted heat show that <b>heat</b> <b>emissions</b> explains 55 % of the global warming. Moreover, the amount of emitted heat is underestimated, since the non-commercial use of fossil fuel is not included, e. g. gas flares, underground coal fires, oil used in production of plastics, and also biofuel (wood) consumed at a greater rate than the growth.

H 577 P LSGI 2015 Yogeswaranxv, 128 leaves :illustrations (some color); 30 cmThe main {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to measure anthropogenic heat flux using satellite remote sensing, and evaluate the results using GIS-based modelling. In cities, anthropogenic <b>heat</b> <b>emissions</b> are sourced mainly for buildings, vehicles and human metabolic activities. The emissions vary significantly over time and space, and are not easily measured, so detailed models of anthropogenic <b>heat</b> <b>emissions</b> are not available for most cities. Previous studies have mainly used three approaches: inventory, energy balance enclosure, and building energy models. The present study is the first to model anthropogenic heat using three different approaches. Thermal infrared Images from the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer, Level 1 B (ASTER, L 1 B) satellite are used to estimated anthropogenic <b>heat</b> <b>emissions</b> using the energy balance approach. A new technique is developed to calculate the emissivity with a higher spatial resolution. This study measures urban morphometric parameters using the Geographic Information Systems (GIS) at a much finer scale, compared to previous studies, which only calculate approximate morphometric parameters of the city. Anthropogenic <b>heat</b> <b>emissions</b> are estimated from six different ASTER images of Hong Kong captured between 2007 and 2009. These images represent diurnal (day and night) periods and seasons (summer and winter). In this study, a global anthropogenic heat model called the Large-scale Urban Consumption of energY (LUCY) is adopted for application to Hong Kong, with the spatial resolution increased to 100 m from 2. 5 -arc minutes (~ 5 -km spatial resolution). The anthropogenic <b>heat</b> <b>emissions</b> in LUCY greatly depend on population density data. Therefore, a new population scheme is introduced, in which daytime population data are included so as to consider the migration of population within grid cells at any given time. Other input parameters like energy consumption, air temperature, traffic information, and temperature schemes are also modified to match Hong Kong conditions. A GIS-based model using a bottom-up approach is utilized to account for anthropogenic heat emitted from each building block and every road in Hong Kong. Since these emission sources are captured at a finer resolution in the GIS-based model, the model data are used as the reference for evaluating the remote sensing and LUCY models. It may be noted that the model estimations are limited to the times of satellite image acquisition (~ 11 am for the day and 11 pm for the night) on the given date. In addition, the anthropogenic heat values estimated using the three different models is limited to 100 m spatial resolution. Anthropogenic <b>heat</b> <b>emissions</b> were found to be higher at day compared to nighttime emissions. Likewise, summer emissions were higher than winter ones. In all models, the highest emissions were observed in grid cells with tall commercial, business and residential buildings. Although the intensity levels differed across models, the spatial distributions remained essentially the same. Finally, a significant correlation between anthropogenic heat and UHI was noted when the results of the models were correlated with urban-morphometric parameters and ASTER surface temperature measurements. The anthropogenic heat values estimated using remote sensing agree well with those derived from the GIS-based model. However, there are certain differences in terms of advantages and disadvantages. Overall, the results from all the three models are usable as inputs to climate models. This should be useful to urban planners and other agencies in studies related to UHI.

Our aim was to investigate the influence of <b>heat</b> <b>emission</b> design temperature on the efficiency and design parameters of seasonal storage in terms of collector area, the ratio of storage volume to collector area (RVA), and the ratio of height to diameter of storage tank. For this purpose, we developed a mathematical model in MATLAB to predict hourly heat demand in the building, heat loss from the storage tank, solar collector heat production, and heat support by heat pump as a backup system when needed. In total, 108 cases were simulated with RVAs that ranged from 2 to 5  (m 3  m− 2), collector areas of 30, 40, and 50  (m 2), height-to-diameter-of-storage-tank ratios of 1. 0, 1. 5, and 2. 0  (m m− 1), and various heat emissions with design supply/return temperatures of 35 / 30 as very-low-, 45 / 35 as low-, and 55 / 45  (°C) as medium-temperature <b>heat</b> <b>emission.</b> In order to find the best combination based on <b>heat</b> <b>emission,</b> we considered the efficiency of the system in terms of the heat pump work considering coefficient of performance (COP) of the heat pump and solar fraction.

This includes a database of different working patterns and public holidays, vehicle use and energy consumption in each country. The databases can be edited to include specific diurnal and seasonal vehicle and energy consumption patterns, local holidays and flows of people within a city. If better information about individual cities is available within this (open-source) database, then the accuracy of this model can only improve, to provide the community data from global-scale climate modelling or the individual city scale in the future.

An assessment of the <b>heat</b> <b>emissions</b> estimated revealed that they are reasonably close to those produced by a global model {{and a number of}} small-scale city models, so results from LUCY can be used with a degree of confidence. From LUCY, the global mean urban QF has a diurnal range of 0. 7 – 3. 6 W m− 2, and is greater on weekdays than weekends.
