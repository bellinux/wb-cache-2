25|$|It {{is common}} to score music for the whistle using {{standard}} musical notation. The tin whistle is not a transposing instrument - for example, music for the D tin whistle is written in concert pitch, not transposed down a tone as would be normal for transposing instruments. Nevertheless, {{there is no real}} consensus on how tin whistle music should be written, or on how reading music onto the whistle should be taught. However, when music is scored for a soprano whistle it will be written an octave lower than <b>it</b> <b>sounds,</b> <b>to</b> spare ledger lines and make it much easier to read.|$|E

[...] A claim of cruelty against Barrett committed by the groupies and hangers-on who frequented his apartment during this period was described by writer and critic Jonathan Meades. [...] "I went [...] to see Harry and there was this terrible noise. It sounded like heating pipes shaking. I said, 'What's up?' and he sort of giggled and said, 'That's Syd having a bad trip. We put him in the linen cupboard'". Storm Thorgerson responded to this claim by stating [...] "I do not remember locking Syd up in a cupboard. <b>It</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>to</b> me like pure fantasy, like Jonathan Meades was on dope himself." [...] Other friends assert that Barrett's infamous flatmates, [...] "Mad Jock" [...] and [...] "Mad Sue," [...] believed that acid held all the answers and thought of Barrett as a genius or [...] "god," [...] and were spiking his morning coffee with LSD every day without his knowledge, leaving him in a never-ending trip. He was later rescued from that flat by friends and moved elsewhere, but his erratic behavior continued. Watkinson and Anderson included quotes from a story told to them by Thorgerson that underscored how volatile Barrett could be. [...] "On one occasion, I had to pull him off Lindsay (Barrett's girlfriend at the time) because he was beating her over the head with a mandolin". On one occasion, Barrett threw a woman called Gilly across the room, because she refused to go to Gilmour's house. These strange behaviors contradicted Barrett's usually gentle nature. According to Gilmour in an interview with Nick Kent, the other members of Pink Floyd approached psychiatrist R. D. Laing with the 'Barrett problem'. After hearing a tape of a Barrett conversation, Laing declared him [...] "incurable".|$|E
2500|$|In 1967, Swedish actor Lars Ekborg, outside Sweden most {{known for}} his part in Ingmar Bergman's [...] "Summer with Monika" [...] made an album called [...] "I Tom Lehrers vackra värld" [...] ("In the {{beautiful}} world of Tom Lehrer"), with 12 of Lehrer's songs interpreted in Swedish. Lehrer {{wrote in a letter to}} the producer Per–Anders Boquist that [...] "not knowing any Swedish, I am obviously not equipped to judge, but <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>to</b> me as though Mr Ekborg is perfect for the songs", along with further compliments to pianist Leif Asp for unexpected additional flourishes.|$|E

2500|$|Quinn’s {{argument}} against the obscenity charges was based upon claims that the prurient material in Ulysses was actually a deterrent rather than a pernicious influence. He made further arguments that one needed {{to be acquainted with}} the city of Dublin to truly understand the work and that the sporadic punctuation, and the perceived incomprehensibility of the novel, was due to Joyce’s poor eyesight. At one point in the trial Quinn confessed that [...] "I myself do not understand Ulysses—I think Joyce has carried his method too far,” whereupon one of the presiding judges replied, “Yes, <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>to</b> me like the ravings of a disordered mind—I can’t see why anyone would want to publish it".|$|E
2500|$|Roger Spooner, the farmer, said on CNN that Sherrod {{is not a}} racist, {{that she}} did {{everything}} she could for his family; more than 20 years later, he and Sherrod remain friends. [...] The Spooners credit Sherrod with helping them save their farm: [...] "If it hadn't been for her, we would've never known who to see or what to do", Roger Spooner said. [...] "She led us right to our success." [...] His wife, Eloise Spooner, said that [...] "after things kind of settled down, she brought Sherrod some tomatoes out of her garden, {{and they had a}} good visit." [...] Eloise Spooner recalled Sherrod as [...] "nice-mannered, thoughtful, friendly; a good person." [...] The couple were surprised by the controversy. [...] "I don't know what brought up the racist mess", Roger Spooner said. [...] "They just want to stir up some trouble, <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>to</b> me in my opinion." [...] Eloise Spooner said that on seeing the story of Sherrod's resignation, [...] "I said, 'That ain't right. They have not treated her right.'" ...|$|E
60|$|I confess I {{doubt the}} Homeric genuineness of [Greek: dakruoen gelaschsa]. [1] <b>It</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>to</b> me {{much more like}} a prettiness of Bion or Moschus.|$|E

6000|$|Kate stoutly confronted him. [...] "Perhaps {{the fame}} {{you give her}} will destroy her. <b>It</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>to</b> me like notoriety rather than fame. This poor child {{has a right to}} herself, and I will help her assert it." ...|$|E
6000|$|For, horrible as <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>to</b> say so, I knew {{perfectly}} well now that Jack was Dr. Ivor: yet, {{in spite of that}} knowledge, I loved him still. He was my father's murderer; and I couldn't help loving him! ...|$|E
6000|$|How sweet <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>to</b> hear David say that! so {{simply and}} {{sincerely}} {{that it was}} {{far more than a}} mere compliment. She did not thank him, but said softly as if to herself: ...|$|R
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>to</b> me a very disagreeable speech; but {{the grey}} man laughed--I {{had not heard}} him laugh till then--and my mother ran to my aunt and kissed her; and somehow the room seemed to become lighter.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly a loud {{hissing noise}} was {{heard over the}} side. <b>It</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>to</b> those on deck as if the great sea-serpent had put {{his head out of}} the sea close {{alongside}} and sent a violent hiss into the air.|$|R
6000|$|... "Both, Dave. How queer <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>to</b> {{call you}} Dave, my Dave!" [...] Mr. Porter caught the boy around the neck. [...] "I can't believe it yet--I really can't. Where {{have you been}} all these years? And how did you learn----" ...|$|E
6000|$|Then you gather {{yourself}} for one final effort, and succeed, by superhuman patience, {{in getting the}} fool to understand that you wish to know if Mr. Williamson is in, and he says, so <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>to</b> you, [...] "Be in all the morning." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then I {{must tell}} you this, Iris; I don't approve {{of what you have}} just said. <b>It</b> <b>sounds,</b> <b>to</b> my mind, unpleasantly like {{suspicion}} of me and suspicion of my friend. I see your face confessing it, my lady, at this moment." ...|$|E
6000|$|There! That's Homer, {{the real}} thing! Just as <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>to</b> the rude crowd of Greek peasants {{who sat in}} a ring and guffawed at the rhymes and watched the {{minstrel}} stamp it out into [...] "feet" [...] as he recited it! ...|$|R
50|$|Auditory {{learners}} {{may have}} a knack for ascertaining {{the true meaning of}} someone's words by listening to audible signals like changes in tone.

6000|$|I {{had never}} thought much of my name before; but when she spoke <b>it,</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>to</b> {{me for the first}} time in my life like a mighty nice name, and then she brightened {{suddenly}} and tapped her own breast and said: [...] "Ajor!" ...|$|R

"Do you know, Mr. Ingledew," [...] she said, in a {{trembling}} voice, [...] "I'm sure you don't mean it for intentional rudeness, but <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>to</b> us very like it, {{when you speak}} of our taboos and compare us openly to these dreadful savages.

6000|$|... "Lewis said to me, 'Why do {{you talk}} 'Venetian' (such as I could [...] talk, not very fine to be sure) to the Venetians, and not the usual [...] Italian?' I answered, partly from habit and partly to be understood, [...] if possible. 'It may be so,' said Lewis, 'but <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>to</b> me like [...] talking with a 'brogue' to an Irishman.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But he's a dear good fellow, for all that, Jack," [...] Elsie said stoutly; {{and strange}} as <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>to</b> say so, I admired her for {{sticking}} {{up for her}} friend Dr. Ivor, if she really liked him.

50|$|At first, Australian {{languages}} {{were written}} following English orthography as <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>to</b> the writer.

6000|$|... 'The {{same idea}} {{struck me that}} {{occurred}} to Hampton,' Danvers said, 'but I suppose it was fancy. <b>It</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>to</b> me {{as if he had}} already paid, to some extent, the debt he spoke of, or as if he had no doubt whatever that he should do so in the future.' ...|$|R

60|$|Presumably {{what we hear}} is a {{perambulator}} backing {{into its}} stall in the passage.

60|$|For a {{year after}} that was done to me I wept every day at the same hour and for the same space of time.

A day in prison on which one does not weep is a day on which one's heart is hard, not a day on which one's heart is happy.|$|E
