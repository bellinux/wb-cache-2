40|$|AbstractThe present paper {{discusses}} {{the results of}} an investigation into the effects of test rate and the mode of loading on the fracture energy, Gc, of adhesively-bonded fibre-composite joints. Various carbon-fibre reinforced-polymer (CFRP) matrix composite substrates have been bonded using two different types of automotive structural epoxy-adhesives. They have been tested via loading the bonded joints in mode I (tensile), mode II (in-plane shear) and mixed-mode I/II from slow rates (i. e., of about 10 − 5 m/s) up to relatively high rates of test of about 15 m/s. The high-rate tests were photographed using a high-speed digital video camera to record the deformation of the joint and the fracture behaviour. An analysis strategy has been developed for the various modes of loading (i) to account for the observed fracture behaviour, (ii) to circumvent the problems posed by oscillations in the load traces due to the presence of dynamic effects in the faster tests, and (iii) to account for the kinetic energy associated with the moving specimen arms in the faster tests. Based on the analysis strategy developed, the effect of the test rate on the fracture energy, Gc, for the different loading modes for the joints has been ascertained. Furthermore, various different fracture paths were observed in the tests. They were either cohesive, in the adhesive layer, or interlaminar in the composite substrates. The exact <b>fracture</b> <b>path</b> observed was a function of (i) the type of composite substrate, (ii) the type of adhesive, and (iii) the mode of loading employed. However, the nature of the <b>fracture</b> <b>path</b> was found to be quite insensitive to the test rate. Essentially, it was found that joints subjected to mixed-mode I/II loading were more likely to exhibit an interlaminar <b>fracture</b> <b>path</b> in the composite substrates than when loaded in either pure modes I or II. The propensity for a given joint to exhibit such a <b>fracture</b> <b>path</b> via delamination of the composite substrate has been explained by calculating the transverse tensile stresses induced in the loaded composite arms, and comparing this value to the measured transverse tensile strength of the composite. Following this approach, the underlying reasons for the observed <b>fracture</b> <b>path</b> were identified and could be predicted. Also, the proposed scheme provides a route to design against delamination failure occurring in adhesively-bonded fibre-composite test specimens...|$|E
30|$|One hundred kilo Newton servo {{controlled}} {{universal testing machine}} (Make: FIE–BLUESTAR, India, Model: UNITEK 94100) was employed to evaluate the transverse tensile properties of the FSW and UWFSW joints. The tensile specimens were extracted, machined and tested as per the ASTM E 8 M guidelines. Before testing, the samples were flattened to ensure the equal cross-sectional area along the entire gauge length of the specimen. The tensile properties such as yield strength, ultimate tensile strength and elongation were evaluated. The {{cross section of the}} tensile tested samples were polished and etched to reveal the entire <b>fracture</b> <b>path</b> using optical microscope. The tensile <b>fracture</b> <b>path</b> was identified by the macro-structural analysis. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) was employed to characterize the fracture surfaces. Hydraulic-controlled Vickers microhardness tester (Make: Shimadzu and model: HMV- 2 T) was used to measure the microhardness along the cross section of the weld joint. The indentations were made under the load of 4.9  N for a dwell time of 15  s. The single hardness profile was obtained along the mid-thickness region with the indentation of 1  mm spacing. The correlation between the entire <b>fracture</b> <b>path</b> and the LHDR cannot be agreed from the single hardness profile. Hence, the hardness distribution maps were obtained by indenting along five test lines which are 1  mm spacing along the thickness direction.

The results of rock strength, diamond and percussion drillability tests in eleven sandstones, marbles and igneous rocks are reported, and correlated with the developed texture coefficient. The texture coefficient returns highly statistically significant correlations with rock strength and drillability data.

To capture the complex hydraulic fractures in rock masses, a numerical code called Rock Failure Process Analysis (RFPA 2 D) is introduced. Based {{on the characteristics of}} a typical Glutenite reservoir in China, a series of 2 D numerical simulations on the hydraulic fractures in a small-scale model are conducted. The initiation, propagation and associated stress evolution of the hydraulic fracture during the failure process, which cannot be observed in experimental tests, are numerically simulated. Based on the numerical results, the hydraulic <b>fracturing</b> <b>path</b> and features are illustrated and discussed in detail. The influence of the confining stress ratio, gravel sizes (indicated by the diameter variation), and gravel volume content (VC) on the hydraulic fracturing pattern in a conglomerate specimen are numerically investigated, and the breakdown pressure is quantified as a function of these variables. Five hydraulic fracturing modes are identified: termination, deflection, branching (bifurcation), penetration, and attraction. The propagation trajectory of the primary hydraulic fractures is determined by the maximum and minimum stress ratios, although the <b>fracturing</b> <b>path</b> on local scales is clearly influenced by the presence of gravels in the conglomerate, particularly when the gravels are relatively large. As the stress ratio increases, the fractures typically penetrate through the gravels completely rather than propagating around the gravels, and the breakdown pressure decreases with increasing stress ratio.

When cutting through the material, crack fronts directly affect the coupling between simulation nodes, requiring a dynamic adaptation of the nodal shape functions. We show how local visibility tests and dynamic caching lead to an efficient implementation of these effects based on point collocation. Complex fracture patterns of interacting and branching cracks are handled using a small set of topological operations for splitting, merging, and terminating crack fronts. This allows continuous propagation of cracks with highly detailed fracture surfaces, independent of the spatial resolution of the simulation nodes, and provides effective mechanisms for controlling <b>fracture</b> <b>paths.</b> We demonstrate our method {{for a wide range}} of materials, from stiff elastic to highly plastic objects that exhibit brittle and/or ductile fracture. status: publishe...|$|R
