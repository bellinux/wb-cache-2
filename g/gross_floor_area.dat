40|$|Several {{studies have}} {{documented}} benefits of prefabrication system (prefab) {{compared to the}} traditional building system (TBS). However, the documented benefits have been anecdotal or fragmented with reports of isolated case study projects. Few studies {{have looked at the}} objectively quantified benefits from statistical significance point of view and across building types in New Zealand. This study contributes to filling this knowledge gap by analyzing cost and time-savings, and productivity improvement achievable by the use of prefab in place of the TBS. Records of completion times and final contract values of 66 building projects implemented using prefab in Auckland were collected. The building types included commercial, houses, apartments, educational, and community buildings. The project details included final contract sums, completion dates, <b>gross</b> <b>floor</b> <b>areas,</b> and number of floors. Based on these details, the equivalent completion times and the final cost estimates for similar buildings implemented using the TBS were obtained from the Rawlinsons construction data handbook and feedback from some designers and contractors. Marginal productivity outcome for each building project was computed as the product of the cost and time-savings achieved using the prefab. Results showed that the use of prefab in place of TBS resulted in 34 % and 19 % average reductions in the completion times and costs, respectively. This also translated to overall 7 % average improvement in the productivity outcomes in the building projects. Univariate ANOVA-based hypothesis test results showed that ‘building type’ had no significant effects on the cost and productivity improvement outcomes, but had significant effect on the time savings analyzed in the case study projects. The greatest productivity gain of 11 % was achieved in house projects. These evidence-based results could guide optimized use of prefab for specific building application. The hypothesis-testing outcome provides insights on one of several potential influences on prefab improvements, which will be analyzed in subsequent research...|$|R

40|$|Building {{morphology}} {{has significant}} influence on operational energy demand of buildings. Energy consumption for space cooling {{accounts for more than}} 75 % of electricity use in typical condominium buildings. With {{increase in the number of}} condominiums in Sri Lanka, the requirement for space cooling has increased resulting in significant energy demands. Accordingly, this study developed a morphology-based model for forecasting cooling energy demand of condominiums. The study employed a quantitative approach involving questionnaire survey and document review to collect data from thirty (30) condominiums in Sri Lanka. The correlation analysis performed on the data collected indicates that the number of floors (0. 940), building height (0. 930), building shape (- 0. 686), grouping of buildings (- 0. 647) window-to-wall-ration (0. 597), <b>gross</b> internal <b>floor</b> <b>area</b> (0. 489), and wall-to-floor-ratio (- 0. 457) have significant correlations with the cooling energy demand of condominiums in Sri Lanka. A multiple linear regression model developed shows that the number of floors and window-to-wall-ration account for 91. 2 % accuracy of the cooling energy estimation for condominiums in Sri Lanka. Thus, using the developed model, the annual cooling energy demand of a condominium can be forecast, considering significant design factors that could inform decisions at the building design and construction stage to ensure energy efficient designs...|$|R
40|$|The student {{accommodation}} {{sector in}} now the best-performing {{asset in the}} UK and US property markets and this is projected to further accelerate, with building refurbishment of existing student accommodations being the preferred method to satisfy growing demand. However, there are no published research studies on refurbishment projects within the student accommodation sector. Refurbishment is an emergent trend to upgrade existing stock to ensure that buildings meet rising energy efficiency demands. Moreover, it is widely affirmed that greenhouse gases contribute to climate change and notably the built environment is a significant contributor, both through its construction and during its operation and use. This paper demonstrates through a comparative case study approach, how greenhouse gases levels can be effectively measured during refurbishment works. There are multiple metrics used for quantification/assessment of greenhouse gases performance and this paper aims to make well-argued recommendations for their best use. Four student accommodation refurbishment projects are presented to compare and contrast differing emission datasets. The results dictate that project cost and duration cannot alone be used to gauge greenhouse gases emissions; more too, in the instance of student accommodation refurbishment, <b>gross</b> internal <b>floor</b> <b>area</b> {{and the number of}} rooms offers a more predictable indicator. It is recommended that refurbishment developers reflect on these recommendations when reporting the primary energy and GHG performance of their refurbishment works.

40|$|One of {{the aims}} of the HOPE project is to develop a method to assess {{healthiness}} and energy efficiency of buildings and strategies to optimise their performance towards health and energy efficiency. In this project, a building is defined "Healthy and Energy Efficient" if: it does not cause or aggravate illnesses of the building occupants; it assures a high level of comfort for the building occupants; it minimises the use of non-renewable energy taking into account available technology. Health and comfort performance criteria for buildings have been defined. They include a set of measurable parameters related to indoor air pollutants or physical characteristics of the indoor environment. Compliance with this set is expected to assure, {{with a high degree of}} confidence, the provision of acceptable performance of buildings and zones within them. Target values of the selected parameters have been set taking as reference the WHO air quality guidelines, when available. Health classification of buildings is based on health risk analysis from checklist data, if necessary integrated with measurements, and health- and comfort-related questionnaire data. To this purpose, health hazards have been divided into 3 groups and acute building-related symptoms are evaluated through the Building Symptom Index (BSI), a numeric indicator that considers the frequency of symptoms related to the Sick Building Syndrome (SBS) perceived by the occupants. In the end, the building is ranked according to the health status in one of 3 classes. Energy efficiency is evaluated by means of the energy index, i. e. the yearly total energy use per <b>gross</b> heated <b>floor</b> <b>area,</b> and the building is ranked accordingly.
