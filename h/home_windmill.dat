40|$|In Smart Grid environments, <b>homes</b> {{equipped}} with <b>windmills</b> {{are encouraged to}} generate energy and sell it back to utilities. Time of Use pricing {{and the introduction of}} storage devices would greatly influence a user in deciding when to sell back energy and how much to sell. Therefore, a study of sequential decision making algorithms that can optimize the total pay off for the user is necessary. In this paper, reinforcement learning is used to tackle this optimization problem. The problem of determining when to sell back energy is formulated as a Markov decision process and the model is learned adaptively using Q-learning. Experiments are done with varying sizes of storage capacities and under periodic energy generation rates of different levels of fluctuations. The results show a notable increase in discounted total rewards from selling back energy with the proposed approach...|$|R
50|$|The {{southern}} {{portion of}} the property is now home to the David Glass House, a Victorian style structure dating to the late 1860s to early 1870s. This home was relocated from its original site at Lora Nita Farm. The Glass House is a two-story, wood-frame dwelling with a one-story rear wing, which may be older than {{the main body of}} the house. The tank house, somewhat modified from historic condition, is a two-story, wood-frame structure that is probably slightly later in date than the house. The Glass House exterior will soon be restored to its original beauty. Following that part of the project, the landscaping around the home will be reworked to resemble a photo of the home from 1890s. The photo shows a <b>windmill</b> behind the <b>home</b> and the <b>windmill</b> from the Henry Farm will be placed there to best recreate the way the Glass House is depicted in the photo.|$|R
500|$|During the Middle Ages and {{industrial}} revolution the area which now forms The Downs {{was used as}} common grazing land. It was mined for lead, calamine, iron and limestone, and became <b>home</b> to a <b>windmill</b> which produced snuff from the tobacco which {{had become one of}} the city's principal imports. In 1777 the windmill burnt out in a storm, and the building was converted into the observatory, which houses a camera obscura. In the 18th and 19th centuries Bristol's economy boomed and Clifton became a desirable place to live. Mansion houses were built overlooking the gorge, but after grazing was stopped, trees grew and obscured the view from these mansions. In the Victorian era, with houses creeping further onto the Downs, an Act of Parliament was passed to protect them as a park for the people of Bristol. In 1754 a bridge to span the gorge was proposed, but it was nearly 80years before work began on Isambard Kingdom Brunel's Clifton Suspension Bridge, and a further 30years before it was completed. [...] Today the bridge is perhaps the best known landmark in Bristol.|$|R
40|$|Mumford [née McFarland], Enid Mary (1924 – 2006), social scientist, {{was born}} on 6 March 1924 at Iona, Groveland Avenue, Wallasey, Cheshire, the {{daughter}} of Arthur McFarland (1893 – 1966), a hospital secretary, and later a prominent barrister and chief stipendary magistrate of Liverpool, and his wife, Dorothy, née Evans, a headteacher. Her family and intellectual heritage were in the north-west of England. She attended Wallasey high school before joining the social sciences department at Liverpool University, where she took {{a special interest in}} social psychology and graduated BA in 1946. She then went to work in industry, first with Rotol Ltd, aeronautical engineers, as a personnel manager responsible for industrial relations strategy for a large number of female staff, and subsequently with the Liverpool clock and watch maker J. D. Francis as a production manager. The experience of working in industry close to the shop floor proved invaluable for her later academic work as a teacher and researcher. On 28 July 1947, at the parish church of St Nicholas, Wallasey, she married James Muir (Jim) Mumford, a dental surgeon one year her senior (son of James Montgomery Mumford), who was later to become professor of operative dental surgery at Liverpool University. They made their <b>home</b> at 4 <b>Windmill</b> Close, Appleton, Warrington, Cheshire, situated conveniently between the universities of Liverpool and Manchester. They had two children, Michele and Colin...|$|R
5000|$|After {{resistance}} from his uncles about the design, Wright explained the windmill to the aunts:Of course {{you had a}} hard time with Romeo and Juliet. But you know how troublesome they were centuries ago. The principle they represent still causes mischief in the world because it is so vital. Each is indispensible to the other... neither could stand without the other. Romeo, as you will see, will do all the work and Juliet cuddle alongside to support and exhalt him. Romeo takes the side of the blast and Juliet will entertain the school children. Let's let it go at that.According to the local Spring Green newspaper, The <b>Home</b> News, the <b>windmill</b> was completed in 1897. The Romeo and Juliet Windmill was the second structure the aunts commissioned from Wright. The first one, which no longer exists, was Hillside Home School I built in 1887. It was known by students and teachers in the institution of the Hillside Home School as the Home Building. The third structure designed by Wright for the Hillside Home School was a stone educational facility, the Hillside Home School II, commonly known as the Hillside Home School, since it's {{the only one of the}} two that still exists. [...] Romeo and Juliet is one of five buildings designed by Frank Lloyd Wright on what became his property, which is now known as the Taliesin estate. From the windmill, it is possible to see three of the other structures on the Taliesin estate: the residence Taliesin is on an adjacent hill to the north, Tan-y-Deri is near the windmill's base, and the Hillside Home School is down the hill to windmill's south. Also on the estate is the farming structure, Midway Barn.|$|R
