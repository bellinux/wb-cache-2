A cross-sectional study in 921 patients with anterior pain or knee instability of at least 6 months&# 39; duration was conducted from July 2001 to December 2009. All subjects were clinically evaluated and underwent radiography and computed tomography of their knees. According to their degree of dislocating patellar dysplasia, the subjects were classified into groups for statistical comparison. There was a statistically significant difference in all measurements when the groups were compared, except for external tibial torsion angle. The most sensitive and specific measurements for determining patellar instability were the trochlear groove angle, tibial tubercle-trochlear <b>groove</b> <b>distance,</b> average patellar tilt, and average patellar height. Patients with potential patellar instability, increased tibial tubercle-trochlear <b>groove</b> <b>distance,</b> and patellar height, tilt, and deviation measurements had a greater risk for patellar dislocation.

40|$|OBJECTIVES To prospectively compare {{patellofemoral}} and femorotibial alignment in supine non-weight-bearing {{computed tomography}} (NWBCT) and upright weight-bearing CT (WBCT) {{and assess the}} differences in joint alignment. METHODS NWBCT and WBCT images of the knee were obtained in 26 patients (mean age, 57. 0 [*]±[*] 15. 9  years; range, 21 - 81) using multiple detector CT for NWBCT and cone-beam extremity CT for WBCT. Two musculoskeletal radiologists independently quantified joint alignment by measuring femorotibial rotation, tibial tuberosity-trochlear <b>groove</b> <b>distance</b> (TTTG), lateral patellar tilt angle, lateral patellar shift, and medial and lateral femorotibial joint space widths. Significant differences between NWBCT and WBCT were sought using Wilcoxon signed-rank test (P-value[*]<[*] 0. 05). RESULTS Significant differences were found for femorotibial rotation (the NWBCT mean changed from 2. 7 °[*]±[*] 5. 1 (reader 1) / 2. 6 °[*]±[*] 5. 6 (reader 2) external rotation to WBCT 0. 4 °[*]±[*] 7. 7 / 0. 2 °[*]±[*] 7. 5 internal rotation; P[*]=[*] 0. 009 /P[*]=[*] 0. 004), TTTG (decrease from NWBCT (13. 8  mm[*]±[*] 5. 1 / 13. 9  mm[*]±[*] 3. 9) to WBCT (10. 5  mm[*]±[*] 5. 0 / 10. 9  mm[*]±[*] 5. 2; P[*]=[*] 0. 008 /P[*]=[*] 0. 002), lateral patellar tilt angle (decrease from NWBCT (15. 6 °[*]±[*] 6. 7 / 16. 9 °[*]±[*] 7. 4) to WBCT (12. 5 °[*]±[*] 7. 7 / 15. 0 °[*]±[*] 6. 2; P[*]=[*] 0. 011 /P[*]=[*] 0. 188). The medial femorotibial joint space decreased from NWBCT (3. 9  mm[*]±[*] 1. 4 / 4. 5  mm[*]±[*] 1. 3) to WBCT (2. 9  mm[*]±[*] 2. 2 / 3. 5  mm[*]±[*] 2. 2; P[*]=[*] 0. 003 /P[*]=[*] 0. 004).

METHODS: Fifty patients with TD were retrospectively analysed and compared to 52 age- and gender-matched patients (CG). TT-TG was measured on transverse MR images, as {{the distance between the}} trochlear groove of minimal 2  mm depth proximally and the centre of the patellar tendon at its distal insertion. The height of the femoral reference point above joint line was recorded for both groups. TT-TG measurement was repeated in CG using the first (P 25), second (P 50) and third quartile (P 75) above joint line of TD.

Recently, {{it has been shown that}} TT-TG negatively correlated with the quadriceps angle, suggesting that if used individually, neither provide a valid measure of instability. This study aimed to compare TT-TG distance between both knees in patients with unilateral instability to assess whether this measurement is a decisive element in the management decisions for patellar instability. METHODS - Sixty-two patients (18 male and 44 female), reporting to a specialist patella clinic for recurrent unilateral patellar instability, were included in the study. Patients underwent bilateral long leg computed tomography scan to determine TT-TG distance in both knees. Tibial TT-TG in symptomatic and asymptomatic knees in the same individual was compared statistically. RESULTS - Mean TT-TG distance in the symptomatic knee was 16. 9 (± 4. 9) mm, compared to 15. 6 (± 5. 6) mm in the asymptomatic knee. Tibial TT-TG was not significantly different between stable and unstable knees (n. s.). CONCLUSIONS - The lack of difference in TT-TG distance between stable and unstable knees suggests that TT-TG distance alone may not be a decisive element in establishing therapeutic choices for patellar instability. It should, therefore, be interpreted with caution during clinical evaluations. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: II...|$|E

Despite conductance measurements were first taken with a the fact that advances in IRGA-based porometry and porometer, then, without delay, a silicone rubber measurement of chlorophyll fluorescence allow direct and impression of the leaf was made of the area directly indirect measurement of stomatal activity in small areas under the porometer cup. From a positive replica of of leaves (Daley et al., 1989; Parkinson et al., 1990), this impression, stomatal aperture, PGD and pore there is still a need for accurate measurements of indi...|$|E
40|$|Purpose The aim of {{this study}} was to measure the tibia {{tubercle}} trochlea <b>groove</b> <b>distance</b> (TT–TG) as a function of knee flexion. Our hypothesis was that there is a different pattern in healthy volunteers and patients with patella instability (PFI). Methods Thirty-six knees of 30 patients with at least one dislocation of the patella and 30 knees of 30 healthy volunteers as control group were analysed with magnetic resonance imaging by three different observers. The TT–TG was measured in steps of 15 ° between 0 ° and 90 ° of knee flexion. Furthermore, the alignment of the leg (MA), the femur torsion (FTor) and the tibia torsion (TTor) was calculated. Results The TT–TG was higher in patients compared to volunteers and in extension compared to flexion. This difference was statistically significant (p < 0. 05). Most of the patients with a TT–TG above 20 mm in extension showed a high decrease in flexion to normal values. In some patients, this compensating mechanism fails. MA, FTor and TTor were not different in patients and control group (n. s.). Conclusion The TT–TG distance is dynamic and decreased significantly during flexion in knees with PFI and healthy volunteers. However, there were a small number of patients in the PFI group where this compensation mechanism did not work. Therefore, the decision to perform a tibia tubercle osteotomy should not be based on one single measurement in extension or 30 ° of knee flexion. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Purpose The {{quadriceps}} angle (Q-angle) represents the angle between the vector of {{action of the}} quadriceps and the patellar tendon. An increased Q-angle {{has been associated with}} an increased risk of patellar instability, although there is disagreement on its reliability and validity as it is affected by the position of the limb and contraction of the quadriceps. Tibial tuberosity–trochlear <b>groove</b> <b>distance</b> (TT–TG) is ascertained by axial CT scanning, with an increased value associated with patellar instability. This study aimed to determine whether the Q-angle correlates with the TT–TG distance in patients with patellar instability. Methods Q-angles were measured in 34 knees that had previously undergone CT scanning for assessment of patellar instability. Measurements were made with the patient supine, the knee extended and the lower limbs in neutral rotation with the quadriceps relaxed and contracted. TT–TG distance was measured on CT scanning in an identical position. Results Of the 34 knees measured, 24 had symptoms of patellar instability, and 10 were normal. A significant negative correlation between relaxed Q-angle and TT–TG in all knees was demonstrated (p = 0. 028). In symptomatic knees, contracted Q-angle also demonstrated a significant negative correlation with TT–TG (p = 0. 037). Conclusions If TT–TG distance is regarded as the gold standard measurement, Q-angle is not a reliable indicator of patellar instability. There is a clear need to develop methods to more fully characterise the knee and factors contributing to patellar instability. Level of evidence II...|$|E
40|$|Background: Acute patellar {{dislocation}} (APD) is {{a common}} knee injury in children. The pattern and frequency of injury to the medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL) is different in pediatric compared with adult populations. Purpose: To report on injury patterns sustained to the MPFL after APD in children and to determine whether predisposing factors for APD cited in adults hold true in the pediatric population. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods:Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies were reviewed for 36 children sustaining APD. Evidence of injury to the MPFL was documented, and when the MPFL was torn, the location of tear was determined. Presence of trochlear dysplasia, patella alta, tibial tubercle–trochlear <b>groove</b> (TTTG) <b>distance,</b> and thickness of the lateral patellofemoral retinaculum (LPR) were recorded and correlated with MPFL tear. Results: Of the 36 patients sustaining APD, only 16 tore the MPFL. The location of MPFL tear was equally divided between the origin, the insertion, or both, with no case of midsubstance tear. There was a significant correlation identified between MPFL rupture and both LPR thickness greater than 3 mm and TTTG distance greater than 19 mm. Conclusion: The MPFL does not always tear in children who sustain APD, and the tear location is variable. A thickened LPR and increased TTTG distance predispose to MPFL tear...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjective: To {{determine}} {{the contribution of}} MRI in evaluating patellofemoral instability (PFI) and to compare the underlying predisposing factors between the study and control groups. Materials and methods: We enrolled knee MRI scans of 38 patients with lateral patellar dislocation (LPD) and 38 control subjects. All MRI scans were examined for LPD and patellofemoral joint (PFJ) morphological abnormalities. The lateral trochlear inclination angle, sulcus angle and trochlear depth were the MR measures for trochlear dysplasia (TD), patellar height ratio was used for evaluation of patella alta, the patellar tilt angle, and the tibial tuberosity-trochlear <b>groove</b> (TT-TG) <b>distance</b> were also measured. Results: MRI confirmed PFI in 84. 2 % of study group and detected abnormal PFJ morphological factors in all cases. The prevalences and mean values of all MR parameters showed significant differences (p< 0. 001) between the study and control groups. MR parameters for TD had the highest sensitivity of 57. 9 %, while the TT-TG distance was the most specific 97. 4 % for PFI. The prevalence of combined PFJ abnormal morphological factors was 36. 8 % in the study group. Conclusion: MRI was useful in quantitative measuring of the predisposing factors contributing to PFI resulting in significant difference in all MR parameters between the study and control groups...|$|R
40|$|Double slip turnout {{is common}} in heavy haul railway and due to its complex structure, its {{maintenance}} is difficult as well as important. Focusing on No. 12 double slip turnout (75 kg/m rail), this study analyzed {{the intensity of the}} different slotted rubber pad under iron plate and track stiffness of turnout zone based on the finite element method with a purpose of improving the performance of the double slip turnout. Results show that: the depth of groove on rubber pad and <b>groove</b> center <b>distance</b> have great influences on the equivalent stresses of iron plate and the pad; under pressure of 85. 52 kN on sleeper, the maximal equivalent stresses of iron plate and the pad under iron plate are 72. 959 and 2. 141 MPa, respectively, both smaller than their allowable value; the maximal longitudinal variation rates of entire track stiffness are 1. 42 and 1. 34 respectively; the stiffness uniformity of the diamond-shaped double slip turnout can meet the requirement that the train runs at or below 120 km/h. All these achievements can be used as the theoretical guidance for performance optimization of double slip turnout and improving the running stability of heavy haul trains as well as extending service life of the turnou...|$|R
