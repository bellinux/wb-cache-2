This paper presents a method that {{might be used to}} assess the impact of weld imperfections in a piping system, provided that limited <b>destructive</b> <b>examination</b> of welded joints is possible. A probability distribution function of weld quality is developed from the <b>destructive</b> <b>examination,</b> and this is combined with an experimentally determined relationship between weld quality and reduced strength. This latter is the result of uniaxial tensile testing of specimens with controlled imperfections. A seismic stress probability distribution function is determined by conventional seismic analysis.

Packaged contents include stabilized plutonium-bearing residues that contain chloride salts and a low (< 0. 5 weight %) water content. The DOE 3013 STD requires surveillance of the packages over the 50 year lifetime. These surveillance requirements have been further defined by the Integrated Surveillance Program to include both non-destructive examination (NDE) and <b>destructive</b> <b>examination</b> (DE) of the 3013 container. The DE portion of surveillance involves examining the 3013 nested containers, analyzing the head space gas, and evaluating the plutonium oxide chemistry. At SRS, the stored 3013 containers will undergo preparation for the DE surveillance activities in facilities located in K-Area. The actual DE surveillance will be performed in SRNL.

Two nanostructures with important applications are selected for characterization. First, uniaxially aligned gold nanorods (AuNRs) embedded in polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) films are realized by determining suitable heating conditions during stretching, using PVA of high molecular weight mixed with plasticizer to improve the plastic deformability, and stretching the composite film. A high stretch ratio of seven is attained and the induced alignment of the rods is quantified statistically by an order parameter of 0. 92 and an average angle of 3. 5 °. The stretched composite film is shown to have dichroic optical properties, which confirmed the good alignment. Since the statistical quantification requires <b>destructive</b> <b>examinations,</b> a novel non-destructive method is developed based on a probabilistic approach, computational simulations, and spectrometric measurements.
