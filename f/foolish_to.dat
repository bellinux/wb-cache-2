5|$|Bush was not {{a natural}} melodist à la Dvorák, though he could produce an {{appealing}} tune when he set his mind to it. But he was a first-rate contrapuntist, and his harmonic world can glow with a rare internal warmth.

Cable and Emile's espionage work {{has made it possible}} for a major offensive, Operation Alligator, to begin. The previously idle fighting men, including Billis, go off to battle.|$|E
5|$|Varro, {{in command}} {{on the first}} day, is {{presented}} by contemporary sources {{as a man of}} reckless nature and hubris, who was determined to defeat Hannibal. While the Romans were approaching Cannae, a small portion of Hannibal's forces ambushed them. Varro repelled the attack and continued on his way to Cannae. This victory, though essentially a mere skirmish with no lasting strategic value, greatly bolstered the confidence of the Roman army, perhaps leading to overconfidence on Varro's part. Paullus, however, was opposed to the engagement as it was taking shape. Unlike Varro, he was prudent and cautious, and he believed it was <b>foolish</b> <b>to</b> fight on open ground, despite the Romans' numerical strength. This was especially true since Hannibal held the advantage in cavalry (both in quality and quantity). Despite these misgivings, Paullus thought it unwise to withdraw the army after the initial success, and camped two-thirds of the army east of the Aufidus River, sending the remainder to fortify a position on the opposite side. The purpose of this second camp was to cover the foraging parties from the main camp and harass those of the enemy.|$|E

Another time, he was caught using slugs on machines. He also used stolen credit cards on vacations.|$|E
25|$|As strong {{opponents of}} the war, the Federalists held the Hartford Convention in 1814 that hinted at disunion. National {{euphoria}} after the victory at New Orleans ruined {{the prestige of the}} Federalists and they no longer played a significant role as a political party. President Madison and most Republicans realized they were <b>foolish</b> <b>to</b> let the Bank of the United States close down, for its absence greatly hindered the financing of the war. So, with the assistance of foreign bankers, they chartered the Second Bank of the United States in 1816.|$|E
25|$|Bismarck {{also worked}} to {{maintain}} the friendship of Russia and a working relationship with Napoleon III's France, the latter being anathema to his conservative friends, the Gerlachs, but necessary both to threaten Austria and to prevent France allying itself to Russia. In a famous letter to Leopold von Gerlach, Bismarck wrote that it was <b>foolish</b> <b>to</b> play chess having first put 16 of the 64 squares out of bounds. This observation became ironic, as after 1871, France indeed became Germany's permanent enemy, and eventually allied with Russia against Germany in the 1890s.|$|E

25|$|Iconodules further {{argued that}} {{decisions}} {{such as whether}} icons ought to be venerated were properly made by the church assembled in council, not imposed on the church by an emperor. Thus the argument also involved {{the issue of the}} proper relationship between church and state. Related to this was the observation that it was <b>foolish</b> <b>to</b> deny to God the same honor that was freely given to the human emperor, since portraits of the emperor were common and the iconoclasts did not oppose them.|$|E
25|$|On December 6, 2006, Deming {{testified before}} the US Senate {{committee}} on the Environmental and Public Works, concluding that The amount of climatic warming {{that has taken place}} in the past 150 years is poorly constrained, and its cause--human or natural--is unknown. There is no sound scientific basis for predicting future climate change with any degree of certainty. If the climate does warm, {{it is likely to be}} beneficial to humanity rather than harmful. In my opinion, it would be <b>foolish</b> <b>to</b> establish national energy policy on the basis of misinformation and irrational hysteria.|$|E
25|$|To Antonino Votto, Callas wasThe {{last great}} artist. When {{you think this}} woman was nearly blind, and often sang {{standing}} a good 150 feet from the podium. But her sensitivity! Even if she could not see, she sensed the music and always came in exactly with my downbeat. When we rehearsed, she was so precise, already note-perfect... She {{was not just a}} singer, but a complete artist. It's <b>foolish</b> <b>to</b> discuss her as a voice. She must be viewed totally—as a complex of music, drama, movement. There is no one like her today. She was an esthetic phenomenon.|$|E

25|$|A {{gene probe}} for rpoB is {{available}} in some countries and this serves as a useful marker for MDR-TB, because isolated RMP resistance is rare (except when patients {{have a history of}} being treated with rifampicin alone). If the results of a gene probe (rpoB) are known to be positive, then it is reasonable to omit RMP and to use SHEZ+MXF+cycloserine. The reason for maintaining the patient on INH despite the suspicion of MDR-TB is that INH is so potent in treating TB that it is <b>foolish</b> <b>to</b> omit it until there is microbiological proof that it is ineffective.|$|E
25|$|Ida S. Scudder {{realized}} {{that she would be}} <b>foolish</b> <b>to</b> go on alone in her fight to bring better health to South India's women. So she decided to open a medical school for girls. Skeptical males said she would be lucky to get three applicants; actually she had 151 the first year (1918), and has had to turn many away ever since. At first, the Reformed Church in America was the main backer of the Vellore school, but since Dr. Scudder agreed to make it coeducational it has the support of 40 missions. Of 242 students today, 95 are men.|$|E
25|$|The Germans {{appreciated}} that constant patrols by destroyers was both wasteful {{of time and}} resources of those ships, and left them open to attack. Instead, they designed defensive minefields to prevent enemy ships approaching and freed up the destroyers for duties escorting larger ships. In the future, ships were never to be sent out one by one. The British realised it was <b>foolish</b> <b>to</b> have sent Arethusa into battle with inadequate training and jammed guns. British ships were criticised for having fired considerable ammunition and torpedoes with little effect: this criticism later proved counter-productive when at the Battle of Dogger Bank, ships became excessively cautious of wasting ammunition and thus missed opportunities to damage enemy vessels.|$|E

25|$|Since a team {{almost always}} scores fewer {{runs in a}} {{baseball}} game than its number of outs, a baserunner will frequently take risks attempting to advance an extra base or to score a run, resulting in close plays at a base. In cricket, since the number of runs scored {{is much greater than}} the number of wickets taken in a match, a batsman would be very <b>foolish</b> <b>to</b> risk getting run out in an attempt to score an extra run without a very high expected chance of success. In general, cricket batsmen are run out due to exceptional fielding, poor judgment/communication, or a combination of said factors. In baseball, runners are often out not of their own accord – they are simply forced out.|$|E
25|$|The enemy, Brinkmann thought, {{could and}} would glean {{important}} intelligence {{from the most}} seemingly innocuous messages and consequently his fleet commander was <b>foolish</b> <b>to</b> issue them. At 08:01, once again without consulting Lindemann or Brinkmann, he radioed the Naval High Command his intent to sail to St. Nazaire and detach his heavy cruiser for commerce operations. No mention {{of the extent of}} the damage incurred by Bismarck was relayed to Germany. The ship was down by the bow, having been hit. The shell had severed the fuel lines to forward fuel tanks by allowing sea water to pour in through the hole located just above the waterline. In Germany, Raeder and his staff felt unable to issue Lütjens with any orders since they had no information {{on the state of the}} task force.|$|E
25|$|Many {{have said}} that a vacuum does not exist, others that it does exist {{in spite of the}} repugnance of nature and with {{difficulty}}; I know of no one who has said that it exists without difficulty and without a resistance from nature. I argued thus: If there can be found a manifest cause from which the resistance can be derived which is felt if we try to make a vacuum, it seems to me <b>foolish</b> <b>to</b> try to attribute to vacuum those operations which follow evidently from some other cause; and so by making some very easy calculations, I found that the cause assigned by me (that is, the weight of the atmosphere) ought by itself alone to offer a greater resistance than it does when we try to produce a vacuum.|$|E
