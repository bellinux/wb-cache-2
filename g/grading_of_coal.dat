50|$|Coal mining {{has been}} mined in Kintyre since the 15th Century, {{although}} the <b>grade</b> <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> {{was not the}} best it was a popular export. A model village includes the light railway that ran between Machrihanish and Campbeltown.|$|R
50|$|RTPS uses <b>coal</b> for {{generation}} <b>of</b> electricity. Its daily requirement <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> {{is about}} 24,000 metric tons, delivered from Western Coalfields Ltd. and Mahanadi Coalfields Ltd.The coal supplied is sampled using a computerized system {{and sent to}} the laboratory for testing.

40|$|The South African {{economy is}} {{strongly}} based on coal as a mined resource, and various <b>grades</b> <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> are supplied to {{local and international}} customers. However, the environmental impacts associated with the preparation and production <b>of</b> different <b>coal</b> <b>grades</b> from Run <b>of</b> Mine (RoM) or raw coal are variable; specifically, the different mining methods used for coal extraction – opencast or underground mining – have different environmental impacts. The entire life cycles <b>of</b> the <b>grades</b> <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> must therefore be evaluated in order to compare environmental performances with supplied economic values. In this paper, a Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) methodology, based on the ISO 14040 standard, is applied for this purpose. Four cases are considered in South Africa: typical high-grade and low-grade coals from opencast and underground mines...|$|R
50|$|In 1993, the smokebox {{extension}} {{added in}} the 1940s by the Great Western to allow the locomotive to burn poorer <b>grades</b> <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> was removed {{in order to improve}} drafting. The coal board extensions were also removed at this time presumably to improve rearward visibility.|$|R
50|$|The {{energy value}} <b>of</b> <b>coal,</b> or the fuel content, {{is the amount}} of {{potential}} energy in coal that can be converted into actual heating ability. The value can be calculated and compared with different <b>grades</b> <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> or even other materials. Materials <b>of</b> different <b>grades</b> will produce differing amounts of heat for a given mass.|$|R
50|$|The high <b>grade</b> <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> {{produced}} was {{ideal for}} maritime uses, and was hence bought by various shipping concerns including the Admiralty and Cunard Line. This spurred Davies {{purchase of the}} rival Harris-owned Deep Navigation Colliery in 1893, which from 1914 for a period provided electricity supply to Lady Windsor.|$|R
5000|$|Coal pieces {{smaller than}} 0.09375 inches in size were {{considered}} [...] "culm," [...] {{and unable to}} be separated from the impurities (and thus useless). The <b>grade</b> <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> ranged from a low of 5 percent impurities for steam or broken coal to a high of 15 percent for pea-size coal and its subsets.|$|R
50|$|To {{understand}} the nuance of the Court's holding, consider this explanation: Congress decides {{to implement a}} uniform tax on all coal mining. The tax so implemented distinguishes between different <b>grades</b> <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> (e.g., anthracite versus bituminous versus lignite) and exempts one <b>of</b> the <b>grades</b> from taxation. Even though the exempted grade could potentially be defined by where it is geographically produced, the tax itself is still geographically uniform.|$|R
5000|$|Methods <b>of</b> drying <b>coal</b> {{through the}} use of forced-air dryers, heat, and {{centrifuges}} were adopted by American coal companies throughout the 20th century. As many coal breakers handled heavier loads <b>of</b> <b>coal,</b> wooden buildings were abandoned in favor of structures made entirely of steel or reinforced concrete. In the mid-20th century, [...] "Diester tables"—oscillating table-sized sluices—were widely adopted by the American coal industry, allowing even finer <b>grades</b> <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> to be processed and captured. Other processing devices such as froth flotation jigs and disc filters were also employed.|$|R
50|$|At {{the start}} of the 19th century, coal mining was almost all {{bituminous}} coal. In 1810, 176,000 short tons <b>of</b> bituminous <b>coal</b> were mined in the US, versus 2,000 tons <b>of</b> anthracite. US <b>coal</b> mining grew rapidly in the early 1800s, doubling or tripling every decade. Anthracite mining overtook bituminous coal mining in the 1840s, and from 1843 through 1868, more anthracite was mined than bituminous coal. But the more limited deposits of anthracite could not satisfy the increasing demand for coal, and from 1869 on, bituminous coal was the predominant <b>grade</b> <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> mined.|$|R
50|$|It {{is thought}} that gold was washed on Bacan since at least 1774; in the mid-nineteenth century, 20 skilled Chinese gold workers were brought from west Borneo but a gold rush did not eventuate. During the era of steam power, {{an attempt was made}} to {{establish}} coal mining on the island using Japanese convicts imprisoned by the Dutch. However, following the delivery of several tons the <b>grade</b> <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> was deemed poor and the mining was discontinued.|$|R
50|$|High grade (HG) and ultra {{high grade}} (UHG) {{anthracite}} {{are the highest}} <b>grades</b> <b>of</b> anthracite <b>coal.</b> They are the purest forms <b>of</b> <b>coal,</b> having the highest degree of coalification, the highest carbon count and energy content and the fewest impurities (moisture, ash and volatiles).|$|R
5000|$|By 1835, {{his brother}} Henry was state {{geologist}} of Pennsylvania, and together the brothers unfolded the historical geology of the Appalachian chain. Among their joint special investigations were {{the study of}} the solvent action of water on various minerals and rocks, and the demonstration that [...] "coal beds stand in close genetic relation to the amount of disturbance to which the inclosing strata have been submitted, the coal becoming harder and containing less volatile matter as the evidence of the disturbance increases". In modern terms, this was the realization that the geological process of metamorphism had gradually transformed softer <b>grades</b> <b>of</b> <b>coal,</b> such as lignite, into harder grades, such as anthracite.|$|R
50|$|The {{temporary}} nationalisation <b>of</b> the <b>coal</b> industry {{during the}} hostilities of World War 2, leading to full nationalisation in 1947, {{led to an}} end to the system of individual collieries selling direct to individual end customers, however different collieries produced different <b>grades</b> <b>of</b> <b>coal,</b> and domestic and industrial customers were still dotted at many locations throughout the country, and so Wath Yard was still needed to efficiently manage the coal traffic flows from the area. This was so much so, that in the early 1950s, the yard became one of the eastern ends of the Manchester-Sheffield-Wath electric railway, over the Woodhead route. A prime justification of this scheme was the heavy coal flows from Wath up the steep grades over the Pennines.|$|R
40|$|Use of {{gasification}} {{based on}} dirty fuels in markets other than syngas production for downstream chemical processes is emerging due to market changes associated with improved gas turbines, deregulation of electric power generation, {{as well as}} more and more stringent environmental regulations. Especially for the increasing quantities of opportunity fuels such as refinery residues, biomass and some <b>grades</b> <b>of</b> <b>coal,</b> integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) technology is best suited to producing affordable and clean power. In this contribution, all relevant aspects are discussed in the context of growing operational experience gained e. g. in the major European IGCC power stations: the Demkolec plant in Buggenum, Netherlands, is in the third year of successful commercial operation on syngas.

25|$|Since the {{foundation}} of East Germany in 1949 Brandenburg formed one of its component states. The State of Brandenburg was completely dissolved in 1952 by the Socialist government of East Germany, doing away with all component states. The East German government then divided Brandenburg among several Bezirke or districts. (See Administrative division of the German Democratic Republic). Most of Brandenburg lay within the Bezirke of Cottbus, Frankfurt, or Potsdam, but parts of the former province passed to the Schwerin, Neubrandenburg and Magdeburg districts (town Havelberg). East Germany relied heavily on lignite (the lowest <b>grade</b> <b>of</b> <b>coal)</b> as an energy source, and lignite strip mines marred areas of southeastern Brandenburg. The industrial towns surrounding Berlin were important to the East German economy, while rural Brandenburg remained mainly agricultural.|$|R
5000|$|On {{the fourth}} level down, the coal was further cleaned of impurities. This was {{originally}} done primarily by hand, but hand picking was gradually supplanted after 1910 by improved screens and jigs. Although breaker boys worked {{at all levels}} <b>of</b> the <b>coal</b> breaker, most <b>of</b> the removal of impurities by hand occurred on this level. (Some picking did occur on the ground level <b>of</b> the <b>coal</b> breaker, where boys would locate good pieces <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> in the culm {{and return it to}} the [...] "clean" [...] coal stream.) Some coal might travel to this level directly from second level, if small enough, as at this level the screens and jigs were only capable <b>of</b> handling egg-grade <b>coal</b> and smaller. This area <b>of</b> the <b>coal</b> breaker was also where most dry screens and wet jigs operated. At this level, the use of conveyor belts (with or without paddles or scoops) was necessarily in order to move the smaller <b>grades</b> <b>of</b> <b>coal,</b> with most belts moving at about 33 feet per minute for pea coal and 50 feet per minute for larger grades. Multiple sorting and picking levels might exist in a single coal breaker, depending on the amount <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> to be processed.|$|R
40|$|A {{noble metal}} {{catalytic}} reactor was tested with three <b>grades</b> <b>of</b> SRC 2 <b>coal</b> derived liquids, naphtha, middle distillate, and {{a blend of}} three parts middle distillate to one part heavy distillate. A petroleum derived number 2 diesel fuel was also tested to provide a direct comparison. The catalytic reactor was tested at inlet temperatures from 600 to 800 K, reference velocities from 10 to 20 m/s, lean fuel air ratios, and a pressure of 3 x 10 to the 5 th power Pa. Compared to the diesel, the naphtha gave slightly better combustion efficiency, the middle distillate was almost identical, and the middle heavy blend was slightly poorer. The coal derived liquid fuels contained from 0. 58 to 0. 95 percent nitrogen by weight. Conversion of fuel nitrogen to NOx was approximately 75 percent for all three <b>grades</b> <b>of</b> the <b>coal</b> derived liquids...|$|R
5000|$|Commercial {{operations}} in fishing and sea hunting were established inside the bay at Point Gardner by the Tyee Company {{who sought to}} take advantage of the unexploited waters of southeast Alaska. They established their operations on Admiralty Island at Murder Cove in 1907 using the first American-built steam-powered whaler, the 97-foot [...] "Tyee Junior", which was equipped with a harpoon gun on the bow. Consequent to a declining whale population, the company closed its {{operations in}} 1913. In 1905, the most extensive coal exploration in southeastern Alaska occurred at Murder Cove, Kootznahoo Inlet, and Hamilton Bay. The Tertiary-aged coal-bearing formations are made up of conglomerate, sandstone, and shale. The Murder Cove explorations occurred on a 5 ft thick seam located [...] from deep water. Though this deposit contains the best <b>grade</b> <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> in the region, further development did not proceed because of its very limited size. A lighthouse was established at Murder Cover during the fiscal year 1914.|$|R
5000|$|Metallurgical <b>coal</b> is <b>coal</b> <b>of</b> a {{sufficient}} <b>grade</b> {{for use in}} steel production.

40|$|This project {{involves}} {{the implementation of}} a new particulate control technology called a ``Core Separator`` for low emission sources (LES) in Krakow. With several hundred boiler sites in the city burning low grade coal, existing pollution control equipment consists primarily of low efficiency cyclones. Such equipment cannot meet the emission standards of most industrial nations. More importantly, these conditions have been the cause of low ambient air quality in Krakow from suspended particles. The Core Separator can be retrofitted onto these boiler houses to substantially reduce particulate emissions, particularly those consisting of the fraction classified as PM 10. In this project, Core Separator technology will be demonstrated for boiler house applications in the Krakow region. Phase I entailed business planning and infrastructure studies to determine the market for this equipment. In the second phase, the technology is to be demonstrated in several boilers of different capacity and firing various <b>grades</b> <b>of</b> <b>coal.</b> Later, a joint venture company was to be established with capability of manufacturing and supplying this equipment in Krakow and throughout Poland...|$|R

40|$|Coal is a combustible, carbonaceous, {{sedimentary}} rock that is {{formed by the}} accumulation, compaction, and physical and chemical alteration of vegetation [Simon and Hopkins 1981; Bates and Jackson 1987]. Coal is classified according to its type, grade, and rank. The type <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> relates to the plant materials from which the <b>coal</b> originated. The <b>grade</b> <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> refers to {{the purity of the}} coal-or the amount of inorganic material (including ash and sulfur) left after the coal is burned [Bates and Jackson 1987; Stefanko 1983]. The rank <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> indicates its degree of metamorphosis and roughly correlates to the geological age <b>of</b> the <b>coal</b> or the geological environment from which it has been mined [Bates and Jackson 1987]. Rank also indicates the percentage of carbon in dry, mineral-free coal [Whitten and Brooks 1973] {{and the degree to which}} the coalification process has progressed [Larsen 1981]. The geological process of coalification begins with organic materials (e. g., celluloses, lignins, and other plant compounds that are deoxygenated and then dehydrogenated) and ends with <b>coal</b> <b>of</b> various geological ages, from lignite to anthracite [Larsen 1981]. Table 3 - 1 presents the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) classification <b>of</b> <b>coals</b> by rank. According to Parkes [1982], high-rank coal includes anthracite and semianthracite coal ("hard coal," with 91 % to 95 % carbon); intermediate-rank coal includes low-, medium-, and high-volatile bituminous and sub-bituminous coal ("soft coal," with 76 % to 90 % carbon); and low-rank coal includes lignite (with 65 % to 75 % carbon or less). The rank <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> tends to increase from the western to the eastern United States, with anthracite occurring primarily in eastern Pennsylvania [Schlick and Fannick 1971]. Most <b>of</b> the <b>coal</b> currently mined in the United States is bituminous [Given 1984]. A classification <b>of</b> the <b>coal</b> in the United States is provided in Table 3 - 2...|$|R

The mine was needed to replace a specific <b>grade</b> <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> currently being supplied from the Company 2 ̆ 7 s Elouera Colliery. The Dendrobium Mine Project (incorporating the mine and the associated infrastructure), having undergone a Commission of Enquiry, was given approval by the Department of Planning in November 2001 and by the BHP Billiton Board of Directors immediately thereafter. The Dendrobium Mine became an official entity on December 23, 2001 by a redistribution of Kemira, Mt. Kembla and Elouera Mine holdings.

40|$|This {{technical}} report summarizes {{research that has}} produced an optimization-based decision support system for assessing the resilience of the Marine Transport System conveying coal in the Port of Pittsburgh area. We describe waterside data with the throughput and storage capacities of locks, pools, and transfer points; landside data with road and rail capacities; a set <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> contracts (i. e., <b>grade</b> <b>of</b> <b>coal,</b> source, destination, quantity, and delivery date); and some policy costs for using these alternate conveyances, and perhaps suffering some shortage. An “operator’s model” is presented that uses this data to emulate the best cost-minimizing policy to operate this Marine Transport System. This operator’s model is then manipulated to emulate loss of key components and evaluate the best possible system response, where {{it may be necessary}} to transfer from the least-expensive, waterborne barge conveyance to rail and/or road transport, and {{it may be necessary to}} allocate shortages among system customers. Systematic evaluations lead to a “resilience curve” for the system. Generalizing, simultaneous loss of sets of components can be modeled, as can the effects of defending certain components, rendering them invulnerable to attack. The final product, a Defender-Attacker-Defender optimization system, can advise the best use of a given defensive budget, where an attacker will observe these defensive preparations and alter his plans accordingly, and the operator, observing losses due to attacks, responds as best able to operate the surviving infrastructure. This system can be applied without change to any other Marine Transport System conveying any set of commodities as flows through a transport network, although considerable effort may be required to develop the appropriate input data and then run the model to perform the analysi...|$|R
40|$|In 2008 the Molteno Coal Field was re-opened for {{commercial}} production {{with a small}} scale open cast mine at Indwe, Eastern Cape. This mine is situated on 5 hectares of land within a headwater catchment of the White Kei River, {{a tributary of the}} Great Kei River. The Molteno coal seam {{was one of the first}} to be exploited in South Africa, where mining commenced in 1877, rising to an average peak production of 176 000 tonnes per annum by 1904. Production gradually fell when higher <b>grades</b> <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> were discovered in Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal, and the mines were abandoned, unrehabilitated, by 1948. The abandoned workings have continued to be mined by informal coal miners for over 100 years. The historic effects of the unrehabilitated works and the ongoing informal mining on the water quality of receiving water resources have been found to be relatively minor, with evidence of high alkalinity in downstream rivers and dams (pH median> 8). With the development of high efficiency circulating fluidized-bed (CFB) technology, the low grade Molteno coal seam has become commercially attractive for a range of industrial and power generation applications. Production of up to 100 000 – 240 000 tonnes per annum of the estimated 100 million tonnes <b>of</b> measured <b>coal</b> is now planned for the first phase of the project.
