5000|$|The {{original}} version, {{later called}} the A-spec, could reach {{a speed of}} 120 mph, but the chassis, a “14-gauge ladder <b>frame</b> <b>with</b> <b>cruciform</b> bracing” based on the Triumph TR3, flexed so much that doors occasionally came open, marring its reputation. Bumpers were originally an optional extra. With the basic specification not including full bumpers, the A-spec. cars have two short, chromium-plated 'whiskers' on the body {{on either side of}} the front grille and two short, vertical bumpers, or [...] "overriders" [...] at the rear, which were not included if the rear bumper was optioned. Early A-spec. cars had recesses behind the door handles, but these were phased out.|$|R
50|$|Buckner Hill House is a {{historic}} plantation house located near Faison, Duplin County, North Carolina. It was built about 1860, and is a two-story, five bay by five bay, square Italianate style <b>frame</b> dwelling <b>with</b> a <b>cruciform</b> plan. The house rests on high brick piers and is capped by a low deck-on-hip roof. It features lavish wooden and plaster ornamentation and center bay porches on each elevation. Also on the property are the contributing kitchen, smokehouse, and storehouse.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "D" [...] Shed is a {{cast-iron}} <b>framed</b> structure <b>with</b> <b>cruciform</b> columns, a roof structure {{and a variety}} of similarly unique features. The structure is five 20 foot bays long and two 20 foot bays wide. It was erected as a transit warehouse and appeared on the first edition Ordnance Survey map from surveys carried out in the 1870s. Originally sited alongside Bute East Dock Basin it was also served by rail. The “D Shed” has a Grade II listing and is one of only a few mid-nineteenth century buildings in Cardiff Bay. It has wholly cast cruciform columns and the eaves beams have been constructed out of simple available riveted sections. The cast iron used in the eave beams is stamped 'Rhymney' so it is assumed manufacture was in the Rhymney Ironworks. The roof truss design includes a bent bottom member and cast iron stays.|$|R
50|$|The Rumsey Hall {{building}} {{stood on}} the west side of the village of Cornwall, on the north side of Bolton Hill Road just west of the Congregational church. It was a 2-1/2 story wood <b>frame</b> structure, <b>with</b> a <b>cruciform</b> plan, covered by a gabled roof and finished in wooden clapboards. Its front facade consisted of a six-column Greek Revival temple front, the columns rising to an entablature that encircled the building, with a fully pedimented gable above. The gable had a rectangular multipane window at its center. The building corners were pilastered.|$|R
40|$|Analysis, design, {{and testing}} of two types of pivoted pad journal {{bearings}} and a spiral-grooved thrust bearing suitable for direct installation into the NASA 2 to 15 KW Brayton Cycle Rotating Unit (BRU) have been accomplished. Both types of tilting pad bearing assemblies are of the preloaded type, consisting of three pads with one pad flexibly mounted. One type utilizes a non-conforming pivot, while the other replaces the conventional spherical pivot <b>with</b> a <b>cruciform</b> flexible <b>member.</b> The thrust bearing is flexure mounted to accommodate static machine mislinement. Test results indicate that both types of journal bearings should satisfy the requirements imposed by the BRU. Hydrostatic tests of the spiral-grooved thrust bearing showed it {{to be free of}} pneumatic hammer with as many as 24 orifices over the BRU pressure and load range...|$|R

40|$|The {{design of}} un-braced frames using wind-moment method (WMM) <b>with</b> <b>cruciform</b> column (CCUB) section as {{vertical}} member is presented here. Steel frames {{on a regular}} grid with approximately equal column spacings in the y-y and z-z direction using UC/UB sections has resulted in minor axis controlled the design, {{which leads to a}} significant loss in performance. The use of CCUB sections with equal Iy and Iz warrants an equal behaviour in both directions whilst ensuring that both the major and minor axis beam to column connections remain straightforward. The study has been conducted on 2 -bay and 4 -bay plane <b>frames</b> <b>with</b> 2, 4, 6 and 8 storey heights, and two different load cases are considered: minimum wind load in conjunction with maximum gravity load and vice versa. Structural design optimization of steel frames was conducted on the selection of steel sections for beam and column. The selection was carried out {{in such a way that}} the steel frame had the minimum weight while the performance of the structure was within the limitations described by BS EN 1993 - 1 - 1 : 2005. Significant column weight savings (between 17 – 66 %) was achieved by using CCUB section in the design, as compared to conventional UC sections...|$|R
