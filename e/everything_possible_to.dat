5|$|By {{the end of}} the 20th century, the {{intersection}} was handling 30,000 drivers a day, from increasingly developed Cornwall, Newburgh and New Windsor. NYSDOT expanded {{the intersection}} with middle-turn lanes and overhead signs on all approaches. Many drivers still felt it was a confusing intersection and that the confusion slowed traffic down as much as the many cars' stopping to enter and exit nearby businesses. In 2001 state officials said they had done <b>everything</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> improve traffic flows through the Five Corners. Continuing congestion was attributable to insufficient or nonexistent planning.|$|E
5|$|The {{bedrock of}} E.V. Ramasamy’s {{principles}} and the movements {{that he started}} was rationalism. He thought that an insignificant minority in society was exploiting the majority {{and trying to keep}} it in a subordinate position forever. He wanted the exploited to sit up and think about their position, and use their reason to realise that they were being exploited by a handful of people. If they started thinking, they would realise that they were human beings like the rest, that birth did not and should not endow superiority over others and that they must awaken themselves and do <b>everything</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> improve their own lot.|$|E
5|$|President Andrew Johnson {{appointed}} Ewing as U.S. Minister to Holland, {{where he}} served from 1866 to 1870. This appointment may have drawn the ire of the Radical Republicans, for Speaker of the House James G. Blaine urged President Ulysses S. Grant that Ewing be recalled and replaced with his brother, Charles Ewing. Blaine told the President that Hugh was 'acting badly'. Blaine himself was disingenuous, having represented to prominent politicians in Ohio including Senator John Sherman {{that he was doing}} <b>everything</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> nominate his close personal friend, former Ohio General Roeliff Brinkerhoff, for the post. Nonetheless, Blaine's request to recall General Ewing was never acted upon, possibly due to the influence of his sister, whose husband General Sherman was a very close friend to President Grant.|$|E

25|$|Burke {{left the}} ring believing that her title was safe {{because she had}} not lost two falls. Many in the press stated that Byers had {{defeated}} her {{and the image of}} Burke’s championship was tarnishing.

25|$|Gay {{people could}} seldom be {{convinced}} that heterosexual sex would {{provide them with the}} same pleasure they derived from homosexual sex. Patients often wanted to become heterosexual for reasons Freud considered superficial, including fear of social disapproval, an insufficient motive for change. Some might have no real desire to become heterosexual, seeking treatment only to convince themselves that they had done <b>everything</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> change, leaving them free to return to homosexuality after the failure they expected.|$|E
25|$|De Gaulle {{not only}} kept the {{patriotic}} resistance alive; {{he also did}} <b>everything</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> re-establish the French claim to independence and sovereignty. As a leader, the American and British governments preferred the less popular, but less abrasively vindictive, General Giraud to de Gaulle, but for the French population de Gaulle was almost universally recognised as the true leader in their victory. These events forced Roosevelt to recognise, finally and fully, the provisional government installed in France by de Gaulle.|$|E
25|$|After being {{granted a}} second chance, Siegel cracked down and did <b>everything</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> turn the Flamingo into a success by making renovations and obtaining good press. He hired future newsman Hank Greenspun as a publicist. The hotel reopened on March 1, 1947,—with Lansky present—and began turning a profit. However, {{by the time}} profits began improving, the mob bosses above Siegel were tired of waiting. Although time was running out, at age 41, Siegel had carved out {{a name for himself}} in the annals of {{organized}} crime and in Las Vegas history.|$|E

25|$|The Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) {{hearings}} in 1940 increased government control over Alaska's airlines which completely reshaped the industry.

The CAB {{ruled in favor of}} a Seattle route for Star in March 1941, but President Franklin D. Roosevelt vetoed the ruling. Pan American Airways started a Seattle – Ketchikan – Juneau service with a Sikorsky flying boat in 1940, but the route was discontinued when World War II started.|$|E
25|$|When the Emperor's power seemed broken {{after the}} African disaster, Francis I {{was far from}} reaping the {{benefits}} of an effort that ended up being rather costly, and he couldn't reply with the reputation he had acquired throughout Europe. The two monarchs Charles I of Spain and Francis I of France, used up {{the remainder of the}} year to prepare new campaigns. On the French part, Frances I did <b>everything</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> obtain military support from the Ottoman Empire, persuading Suleiman the Magnificent to return to Hungary and attack Charles of Austria's possessions, while the Ottoman Admiral, Hayreddin Barbarossa, attacked the Spanish and Italian coasts.|$|E
25|$|The {{amount of}} the award depends on, in part, {{the value of the}} salved vessel, the degree of risk {{involved}} and the degree of peril the vessel was in. Legal disputes do arise from the claiming of salvage rights. To reduce the amount of a claim after an accident, boat owners or skippers often remain on board and in command of the vessel; they do <b>everything</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> minimise further loss and seek to minimize the degree of risk the vessel is in. If another vessel offers a tow and the master or owner negotiates an hourly rate before accepting then salvage does not apply.|$|E
50|$|Following {{a number}} of near-death {{incidents}} involving attempted-swimming by drunk visitors, the council eventually began to remove the attractive features of the lake to discourage visitors from venturing close to it. It {{was at this point}} that Mr Tomlinson decided to dive into the lake. The council argued that they had done <b>everything</b> reasonably <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> ensure the safety of visitors and the lake itself was not the danger, so much as the disregard to warnings and the actions of the public.|$|R

25|$|Screen shot: Screen {{shots are}} blind shots, {{in which the}} goalie can not find the {{location}} of the puck. Goalies should never anticipate or guess when and where the puck will hit. In the screen shot, another player (usually an opponent, but sometimes the goaltender's own teammate) stands between the shooter and the goaltender, obscuring the goaltender's vision of the shot. On a screen shot, the goaltender must do <b>everything</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> try to see the shot, dropping to the butterfly stance and thrusting their glove out at the sound of a shot is not the best idea in the modern game. Some goalies, such as Ed Belfour or Ron Hextall, went as far as (illegally) punching players in the head or slashing their legs.|$|E
25|$|Other {{points of}} the {{agreement}} included the exchange of technical advisers, cooperation on coastal patrols, and the aerial photographing of strategic areas within Colombia. On the issue of aerial photography, Colombia {{made it clear that}} it would only be accomplished by Colombian aircraft and American cameramen. Colombia also made it clear that, although it was fully supportive of the fight against the Axis, it would do <b>everything</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> limit the amount of American military activity taking place on or from its territory. The Colombians did not invite the United States to build its own military bases within their country, as Ecuador and other South American countries did. They felt that the defense of Colombia should be carried out by Colombians, and the United States did not object.|$|E
25|$|Clare, the {{daughter}} of Debbie Tyler (Nicola Duffett), arrives in Walford in 1993 when her mother moves in with her new partner Nigel Bates (Paul Bradley).

Despite problems, Debbie marries Nigel in 1994 and Clare is happy with them; however, her happiness is cut short when her mother dies in a hit-and-run accident in 1995. Nigel falls apart and Clare has to look after him but Nigel sorts himself out when Liam returns, wanting custody of Clare but Clare is happy and {{does not want to}} leave her stepfather.
