40|$|Abstract. The {{underlying}} {{concepts of}} collisionless magnetic field reconnection {{in the vicinity}} of the <b>diffusion</b> <b>regions</b> are developed qualitatively from first principles. One conclusion of this analysis is that energetic ions and electrons observed in the terrestrial magnetosphere or from the sun are not accelerated to the observed energies in the <b>diffusion</b> <b>regions.</b> In plasmas from the laboratory to the terrestrial magnetosphere, the sun, and accretion disks in astrophysics, it is observed that magnetic field geometries change and particles are accelerated on time scales that are short compared to magnetic field diffusion times due to classical Coulomb collisions. These observations require physical processes different from Coulomb resistivity. One such process is collisionles...|$|R
5000|$|Hence, {{electrons}} {{can easily}} tunnel through the depletion region. The J-V {{characteristic of the}} tunnel junction is very important because it explains why tunnel junctions {{can be used to}} have a low electrical resistance connection between two pn junctions. Figure D shows three different regions: the tunneling region, the negative differential resistance region and the thermal <b>diffusion</b> <b>region.</b> The region where electrons can tunnel through the barrier is called the tunneling region. There, the voltage must be low enough so that energy of some electrons who are tunneling is equal to energy states available {{on the other side of}} the barrier. Consequently, current density through the tunnel junction is high (with maximum value of , the peak current density) and the slope near the origin is therefore steep. Then, the resistance is extremely low and consequently, the voltage too. This is why tunnel junctions are ideal for connecting two pn junctions without having a voltage drop. When voltage is higher, electrons cannot cross the barrier because energy states are no longer available for electrons. Therefore, the current density decreases and the differential resistance is negative. The last region, called thermal <b>diffusion</b> <b>region,</b> corresponds to the J-V characteristic of the usual diode: ...|$|E
50|$|The mission builds {{upon the}} successes of the ESA Cluster mission, but will surpass it in spatial {{resolution}} and in temporal resolution, allowing {{for the first time}} measurements of the critical electron <b>diffusion</b> <b>region,</b> the site where magnetic reconnection occurs. Its orbit is optimized to spend extended periods in locations where reconnection is known to occur: at the dayside magnetopause, the place where the pressure from the solar wind and the planets' magnetic field are equal; and in the magnetotail, which is formed by pressure from the solar wind on a planet's magnetosphere and which can extend great distances away from its originating planet.|$|E
50|$|New {{measurements}} {{from the}} Cluster mission {{for the first}} time now can determine unambiguously the scale sizes of magnetic reconnection in the Earth's magnetosphere, both on the dayside magnetopause and in the magnetotail. Cluster is a four-spacecraft mission, with the four spacecraft in a tetrahedron arrangement, to separate spatial from temporal changes as the suite flies through space. Cluster has now also unambiguously discovered 'reverse reconnection' near the polar cusps. 'Dayside reconnection' allows interconnection of the Earth's magnetic field with that of the Sun (the Interplanetary Magnetic Field), allowing particle and energy entry into the Earth's vicinity. Tail reconnection allows release of energy stored in the Earth's magnetic tail, injecting particles deep into the magnetosphere, causing auroral substorms. 'Reverse reconnection' is reconnection of Earth's tail magnetic fields with northward Interplanetary Magnetic Fields, causing sunward convection in the Earth's ionosphere. The Magnetospheric Multiscale Mission, launched on 13 March 2015, is improving on Cluster results by having a tighter constellation of spacecraft, allowing finer spatial measurements and finer time detail. In this way the behavior of the electrical currents in the electron <b>diffusion</b> <b>region</b> will be better understood.|$|E
40|$|To {{understand}} the role of magnetic reconnection in global evolution of magnetosphere and to place spacecraft observations into global context {{it is essential to}} perform global simulations with physically motivated model of dissipation that is capable to reproduce reconnection rates predicted by kinetic models. In our efforts {{to bridge the gap between}} small scale kinetic modeling and global simulations we introduced an approach that allows to quantify the interaction between large-scale global magnetospheric dynamics and microphysical processes in <b>diffusion</b> <b>regions</b> near reconnection sites. We utilized the high resolution global MHD code BATSRUS and incorporate primary mechanism controlling the dissipation in the vicinity of reconnection sites in terms of kinetic corrections to induction and energy equations. One of the key elements of the multiscale modeling of magnetic reconnection is identification of reconnection sites and boundaries of surrounding <b>diffusion</b> <b>regions</b> where non-MHD corrections are required. Reconnection site search in the equatorial plane implemented in our previous studies is extended to cusp and magnetopause reconnection, as well as for magnetotail reconnection in realistic asymmetric configurations. The role of feedback between the non-ideal effects in <b>diffusion</b> <b>regions</b> and global magnetosphere structure and dynamics will be discussed...|$|R
50|$|Small reverse leakage {{currents}} are formed due to formation of reverse bias between <b>diffusion</b> <b>regions</b> and wells (for e.g., p-type diffusion vs. n-well), wells and substrate (for e.g., n-well vs. p-substrate). In modern process diode leakage {{is very small}} compared to sub threshold and tunnelling currents, so these may be neglected during power calculations.|$|R
40|$|Criteria for {{identifying}} electron <b>diffusion</b> <b>regions</b> in magnetic field reconnection events are defined and justified. By employing these criteria and further {{constraints on the}} measured parallel electric field, 117 electron <b>diffusion</b> <b>regions</b> {{have been found in}} searching through three years of Polar satellite sub-solar data. They exist in filamentary currents in which parallel electric fields and depressed plasma densities are found and where the electron beta is generally less than one. The average parallel electric field in these events is about 30 % of the average 38 mV/m perpendicular field. The size of these regions is the order of the electron skin depth or less. These electron <b>diffusion</b> <b>regions</b> are topological boundaries in the plasma and magnetic field line flows because the components of ExB/B 2 on their opposite sides are frequently different. These regions are found throughout the magnetopause but mainly on its magnetospheric side and at the magnetospheric separatrix. This may be because the depleted plasma in these regions is not sufficient to carry the filamentary current imposed on it without creating parallel electric fields and the associated microphysics. The divergence of the pressure tensor in the Generalized Ohms Law may be the leading term that balances the parallel electric field because the plasma density is observed to vary significantly in most events. The picture resulting from this data is of a magnetopause that is highly structured and filamentary and very different from a linear, laminar, symmetric, structure sometimes considered in theories or simulations...|$|R
50|$|In 2015, new exact {{explanation}} for the original Bohm’s experiment is reported, in which the cross-field diffusion measured at Bohm’s experiment and Simon’s experiment were explained by {{the combination of the}} ion gyro-center shift and the short circuit effect. The ion gyro-center shift occurs when an ion collides with a neutral to exchange the momentum; typical example is ion-neutral charge exchange reaction. The one directional shifts of gyro-centers take place when ions are in the perpendicular (to the magnetic field) drift motion such as diamagnetic drift. The electron gyro-center shift is relatively small since the electron gyro-radius is much smaller than ion’s so it can be disregarded. Once ions move across the magnetic field by the gyro-center shift, this movement generates spontaneous electric unbalance between {{in and out of the}} plasma. However this electric unbalance is immediately compensated by the electron flow through the parallel path and conducting end wall, when the plasma is contained in the cylindrical structure as in Bohm’s and Simon’s experiments. Simon recognized this electron flow and named it as ‘short circuit’ effect in 1955. With the help of short circuit effect the ion flow induced by the diamagnetic drift now becomes whole plasma flux which is proportional to the density gradient since the diamagnetic drift includes pressure gradient. The diamagnetic drift can be described as (kBT/eB)∇n/n, (here n is density) for approximately constant temperature over the <b>diffusion</b> <b>region.</b> When the particle flux is proportional to (kBT/eB)∇n/n, the other part than ∇n/n is the diffusion coefficient. So naturally the diffusion is proportional to kBT/eB. The other front coefficient of this diffusion is a function of the ratio between the charge exchange reaction rate and the gyro frequency. A careful analysis tells this front coefficient for Bohm’s experiment was in the range of 1/13 ~ 1/40. The gyro-center shift analysis also reported the turbulence induced diffusion coefficient which is responsible for the anomalous diffusion in many fusion devices; described as (2/π)(δn/n)2(kBT/eB). This means different two diffusion mechanisms (the arc discharge diffusion such as Bohm’s experiment and the turbulence induced diffusion such as in the tokamak) have been called by the same name of “Bohm diffusion”.|$|E
40|$|The {{reconnection}} rate {{is obtained}} for the simplest case of 2 D symmetric reconnection in an incompressible plasma. In the short note (Erkaev et al., Phys. Rev. Lett., 84, 1455 (2000)), the reconnection rate is found by matching the outer Petschek solution and the inner <b>diffusion</b> <b>region</b> solution. Here {{the details of the}} numerical simulation of the <b>diffusion</b> <b>region</b> are presented and the asymptotic procedure which is used for deriving the reconnection rate is described. The reconnection rate is obtained as a decreasing function of the <b>diffusion</b> <b>region</b> length. For a sufficiently large <b>diffusion</b> <b>region</b> scale, the reconnection rate becomes close to that obtained in the Sweet-Parker solution with the inverse square root dependence on the magnetic Reynolds number, determined for the global size of the current sheet. On the other hand, for a small <b>diffusion</b> <b>region</b> length scale, the reconnection rate turns out to be very similar to that obtained in the Petschek model with a logarithmic dependence on the magnetic Reynolds number.

40|$|Abstract—Silicide {{had been}} used to reduce the sheet {{resistance}} of <b>diffusion</b> <b>region</b> for almost 20 years. However, as the silicided re-gion becomes small, the contact resistance of silicide/silicon inter-face becomes higher than the resistance of the Si <b>diffusion</b> <b>region</b> such that current may not flow into the silicide layer. The effect of silicide thickness and contact resistivity on the total resistance of the silicided <b>diffusion</b> <b>region</b> was studied by two-dimensional sim-ulation. It is observed that below a threshold length, the resistance of silicided <b>diffusion</b> <b>region</b> is higher than the unsilicided <b>diffusion</b> <b>region</b> if the silicon consumption during silicide formation is taken into consideration. Thinner silicide and lower contact resistivity re-duce total resistance and threshold length but the threshold length is still much longer than the typical design rule of poly-Si to poly-Si distance.

40|$|A three-region {{mathematical}} model of gas bubble dynamics {{has been shown}} suitable for describing diffusion-limited dynamics {{of more than one}} bubble in a given volume of extravascular tissue. The model is based on the dynamics of gas exchange between a bubble and a well-stirred tissue region through an intervening unperfused <b>diffusion</b> <b>region</b> previously assumed to have constant thickness and uniform gas diffusivity. As a result, the gas content of the <b>diffusion</b> <b>region</b> remains constant as the volume of the region increases with bubble growth, causing dissolved gas in the region to violate Henry's law. Earlier work also neglected the relationship between the varying <b>diffusion</b> <b>region</b> volume and the fixed total tissue volume, because only cases in which the <b>diffusion</b> <b>region</b> volume is {{a small fraction of the}} overall tissue volume were considered. We herein extend the three-region model to correct these theoretical inconsistencies by allowing both the thickness and gas content of the <b>diffusion</b> <b>region</b> to vary during bubble evolution. A postulated difference in gas diffusivity between an infinitesimally thin layer at the bubble surface and the remainder of the <b>diffusion</b> <b>region</b> leads to variation in <b>diffusion</b> <b>region</b> gas content and thickness during bubble growth and resolution. This variable thickness, differential diffusivity (VTDD) model can yield bubble lifetimes considerably longer than those yielded by earlier three-region models for given model and decompression parameters, and meets a need for theoretically consistent but relatively simple bubble dynamics models for use in studies of decompression sickness (DCS) in human subjects, Keywords: decompression sickness, gas diffusion in tissue, diffusivit...|$|E

Hence, the effect of various pore-scale parameters on nanoparticle deposition can be understood by studying nanoparticle transport at pore scale and upscaling the results to the Darcy scale. In this work, correlation equations for the deposition rate coefficients of nanoparticles in a cylindrical pore are developed {{as a function of}} nine pore-scale parameters: the pore radius, nanoparticle radius, mean flow velocity, solution ionic strength, viscosity, temperature, solution dielectric constant, and nanoparticle and collector surface potentials. Based on dominant processes, the pore space is divided into three different <b>regions,</b> namely, bulk, <b>diffusion,</b> and potential <b>regions.</b> Advection-diffusion equations for nanoparticle transport are prescribed for the bulk and <b>diffusion</b> <b>regions,</b> while the interaction between the <b>diffusion</b> and potential <b>regions</b> is included as a boundary condition.

40|$|The Hall effect during {{magnetic}} reconnection {{without an}} external guide field {{has been extensively}} studied in the laboratory plasma of the Magnetic Reconnection Experiment (MRX) [Yamada et al., Phys. Plasmas 4, 1936 (1997) ] by measuring its key signature, an out-of-plane quadrupole magnetic field, with magnetic probe arrays whose spatial resolution is {{on the order of}} the electron skin depth. The in-plane electron flow is deduced from out-of-plane magnetic field measurements. The measured in-plane electron flow and numerical results are in good agreement. The electron <b>diffusion</b> <b>region</b> is identified by measuring the electron outflow channel. The width of the electron <b>diffusion</b> <b>region</b> scales with the electron skin depth (~ 8 c/ωpe) and the peak electron outflow velocity scales with the electron Alfven velocity (~ 0 : 11 VeA), independent of ion mass. The measured width of the electron <b>diffusion</b> <b>region</b> is much wider and the observed electron outflow is much slower than those obtained in 2 D numerical simulations.
