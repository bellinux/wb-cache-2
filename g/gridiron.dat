5|$|The {{sometimes}} utopian {{concept of}} the new town, aimed at improving society through the foundation of architecturally designed communities, was {{an important part of}} Scottish thinking from the mid-eighteenth to the twentieth century.

Helensburgh near Glasgow was laid out in 1776 on a <b>gridiron</b> plan.

50|$|The flame-grilling {{machine at}} Burger King, Carl's Jr./Hardee's, and other fast food {{restaurants}} {{is called a}} 'broiler'. It works by moving meat patties along a chain conveyor belt between top and bottom burners, grilling {{both sides of the}} meat patty at the same time. This concept was invented in 1898, when the Bridge and Beach Co. of St. Louis, Missouri, started manufacturing a vertical cast iron stove. These stoves were designed to allow the meat to be flame-broiled (flame-grilled) on both sides at the same time. Custom hinged steel wire <b>gridirons</b> were built for use in the vertical broilers. The hinged <b>gridirons</b> were slid {{in and out of the}} stoves holding the meat while it cooked evenly on both sides, like modern day oven racks. These stoves took up a small amount of counter space. They were used in lunch spots to feed factory workers.|$|R

5|$|Canadian football, the {{predominant}} form of football in Canada, {{is closely related}} to American football â€“ both sports developed from rugby, and the two sports are considered to be the chief variants of <b>gridiron</b> football. Although the two games share a similar set of rules, there are several key rule differences: for example, in Canadian football the field measures , including two 20-yard end zones (for a distance between goal lines of 110 yards), teams have three downs instead of four, there are twelve players on each side instead of eleven, fair catches are not allowed, and a rouge, worth a single point is scored if the offensive team kicks the ball out of the defense's end zone. The Canadian Football League (CFL) is the major Canadian league and is the second-most popular sporting league in Canada, behind only the National Hockey League.|$|E

5|$|The Michiganensian {{described}} the defeat as follows:"There had been {{every reason to}} expect a victory from Chicago. Michigan had played strong and consistent foot ball throughout her schedule â€“ Chicago had been erratic and unsteady. But there is certainly no sport more full of surprises than foot-ball, and the Thanksgiving Day contest of '96 furnished as sensational a surprise in as exciting a contest as had ever come off on a western <b>gridiron.</b> There was one great difference {{in the character of}} the play of the two teams. Michigan was playing her stock game of football, hard and steady, the game she could have been depended on to play at any time. Chicago seemed to have been trained and nerved to this one game.

5|$|C-SPAN {{continues}} to expand its coverage of government proceedings, {{with a history of}} requests to government officials for greater access, especially to the U.S. Supreme Court. In December 2009, Lamb wrote to leaders in the House and Senate, requesting that negotiations for health care reform be televised by C-SPAN. Committee meetings on health care were broadcast subsequently by C-SPAN and may be viewed on the C-SPAN website. In November 2010, Lamb wrote to incoming House Speaker John Boehner requesting changes to restrictions on cameras in the House. In particular, C-SPAN asked to add some of its own robotically operated cameras to the existing government-controlled cameras in the House chamber. In February 2011, Boehner denied the request. A previous request to Speaker Designate Nancy Pelosi in 2006, to add C-SPAN's cameras in the House chamber to record floor proceedings, was also denied. Although C-SPAN uses the congressional chamber feed cables, the cameras are owned and controlled by each respective body of Congress. Requests by C-SPAN for camera access to non-government events such as the annual dinner by the <b>Gridiron</b> Club have also been denied.|$|E
25|$|A second New Haven gastronomical {{claim to}} fame is Louis' Lunch, which {{is located in a}} small brick {{building}} on Crown Street and has been serving fast food since 1895. Though fiercely debated, the restaurant's founder Louis Lassen is credited by the Library of Congress with inventing the hamburger and steak sandwich. Louis' Lunch broils hamburgers, steak sandwiches and hot dogs vertically in original antique 1898 cast iron stoves using <b>gridirons,</b> patented by local resident Luigi Pieragostini in 1939, that hold the meat in place while it cooks.|$|R
2500|$|There {{are many}} {{additional}} claims {{as to the}} origin of the hambuger. Some enthusiasts claim the hamburger could have been created in SÃ£o GonÃ§alo, a municipality located in the Brazilian state of Rio de Janeiro, in the 18th century by a Chef named Sauerbrown [...] "Little" [...] Victor, but this claim has no supporting evidence to back the opinion. A local newspaper claims that Louis Lassen, a Danish immigrant who arrived in America in 1880, sold butter and eggs as a street vendor. In 1974, in an interview with The New York Times, he recounted how he created a hamburger steak sandwich with small strips of beef for a restaurant known as Louis' Lunch. Lassen's family claims 1900 as the year of his invention. Revealed in a public confrontation between the grandson of Louis, Kenneth Davis Lassen Fletch, and his uncle, documentation signed under notary in 1900 demonstrates the development of the hamburger, as it stresses the difference between a [...] "hamburger steak" [...] and a [...] "hamburger sandwich". Louis' Lunch flame broils the hamburgers in the original vertical cast iron gas stoves manufactured by the Bridge and Beach, Co., St. Louis, Missouri in 1898. The stoves use hinged steel wire <b>gridirons</b> to hold the hamburgers in place while they cook simultaneously on both sides.

2500|$|Even {{with the}} {{publication}} of the Commissioners' Plan, the work of <b>gridironing</b> Manhattan was far from done. Randel's map only showed 16 elevation points for the entirety of Manhattan island, and many more would be needed. In addition, very few of the streets were actually placed into the physical landscape of the island; 125th Street, for instance, was the northernmost street for which Randel had an actual physical position. [...] These tasks, that of completing the survey with elevations, along with marking the actual positions of the notional streets of the plan, would take Randel another six years, until about 1817, supervised by a committee of five alderman, as the Commission had disbanded once it had discharged its legal responsibility.|$|R
