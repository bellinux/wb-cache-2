5|$|Driessen explores ways {{in which}} nonhuman animals might be {{understood}} to be engaging in political deliberation. His claim is empirical rather than normative, as he presents nonhuman animals as already being in political dialogue with humans; rather than arguing that rights should be extended to animals, <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> <b>for</b> a recognition of how interactions with animals have always been political. This is particularly noticeable, he argues, when humans {{are involved in the}} development of new technologies, analysing the example (following Bruno Latour) of Gaston Lagaffe building a door in dialogue with his boss and the office cat, and of farmers and cows using milking robots. He argues that a recognition of this animal deliberation can lead to more thoughtful forms of both environmentalism and democracy.|$|E
5|$|Editorials by AlterNet, The Montreal Gazette, The Wall Street Journal, The Guardian, and The New York Times {{have accused}} Wilders of {{hypocrisy}} given that, in their view, Wilders {{has called for}} the ban of {{the sale of the}} Quran while simultaneously arguing for his own personal freedom of speech. In a speech during a Dutch parliamentary debate, Wilders elaborated that <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> <b>for</b> the consistent application of Dutch laws restricting any act of expression that incites violence. Ideally, he would prefer to see nearly all such laws abolished. As such, he supports a European-wide constitutional protection of freedom of speech like that which exists in the United States.|$|E
5|$|While {{planning}} his revenge, however, Aloha's turn to {{face the}} fear of having his planet attacked comes. A hostile alien invader known as Captain Kabuki (voiced by Lorelei King) descends upon Little Muu and starts taking it apart, piece by piece, contrasting on what Aloha himself had once tried to do to Crater Planet in the first game. Aloha flees the onslaught in his space pod, and lands on an asteroid far away from Little Muu, where <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> <b>for</b> help from his sworn enemy, Universal City Hall. Once again, Robbit is dispatched to help, and manages to free the parts of Little Muu which Kabuki has taken, and ultimately faces Kabuki one-on-one in mortal combat. Robbit defeats Kabuki, resulting in the latter escaping.|$|E

25|$|Unger's {{vision of}} {{economics}} {{is that it}} cannot be unhinged from ideas about the individual and social life. Human activity and political organization must be incorporated into any analysis of trade and economies. In remaking the discipline, <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> <b>for</b> {{a return to the}} normative practice of classical economics but stripped of its necessitarian assumptions and typological references. The development of explanatory claims and prescriptive ideas are necessary. The discipline must connect the transformation of nature with that of society—the making of things with the reorganization of people.|$|E

25|$|In various NFL Films {{productions}} {{about the}} play years later, various Raiders have theorized {{that the real}} purpose of Swearingen's phone conversation was {{to see if there}} were enough police on hand to ensure the players' safety if the play was ruled incomplete, and was then called in the Steelers' favor out of fear, Swearingen was told when asking how many police officers were present that there were only six policemen, so <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> <b>for</b> six points and a touchdown.

25|$|In his 2003 book Our Final Hour, British Astronomer Royal Martin Rees {{argues that}} {{advanced}} {{science and technology}} bring as much risk of disaster as opportunity for progress. However, Rees does not advocate a halt to scientific activity. Instead, <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> <b>for</b> tighter security and perhaps an end to traditional scientific openness. Advocates of the precautionary principle, such as many in the environmental movement, also favor slow, careful progress or a halt in potentially dangerous areas. Some precautionists believe that artificial intelligence and robotics present possibilities of alternative forms of cognition that may threaten human life.|$|E

500|$|Signs {{of missing}} footage from the Sellers {{segments}} are evident at various points. Evelyn Tremble is not captured on camera; an outtake of Sellers entering a racing car was substituted. In this outtake, <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> <b>for</b> the car, à la Pink Panther, to chase down Vesper and her kidnappers; {{the next thing}} that is shown is Tremble being tortured. Out-takes of Sellers were also used for Tremble's dream sequence (pretending {{to play the piano}} on Ursula Andress' torso), in the finale - blowing out the candles whilst in highland dress - {{and at the end of}} the film when all the various [...] "James Bond doubles" [...] are together. In the kidnap sequence, Tremble's death is also very abruptly inserted; it consists of pre-existing footage of Tremble being rescued by Vesper, followed by a later-filmed shot of her abruptly deciding to shoot him, followed by a freeze-frame over some of the previous footage of her surrounded by bodies (noticeably a zoom-in on the previous shot).|$|E
500|$|As {{the public}} outcry against the few Maverick {{incidents}} becomes {{too great to}} deny, the government steps in, and under the advice of Dr. Cain, forms an elite military police organization called the [...] "Maverick Hunters". The Hunters are to capture or disable any Reploids that {{pose a threat to}} humans, provide damage control at Maverick uprisings, help with disaster recovery, and perform other tasks as needed. To lead this group, Cain designs a very advanced Reploid, thought to be immune to whatever defect causes Mavericks. This robot, named Sigma, heads the Hunters for some time before ultimately becoming a Maverick himself, alongside {{the vast majority of the}} other Hunters. Sigma seizes control of a small island, driving out all human occupants. Claiming that the humans are inferior and that they are limiting the growth and potential of Reploids, <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> <b>for</b> his followers to begin a massive extinction effort. X, guilt-ridden at having helped design such a dangerous race, joins forces with the only other remaining Hunter, Zero, in order to stop Sigma at any cost.|$|E

500|$|In {{chapters}} {{five and}} six Townsend discusses US-funded charitable organizations in China, especially missions. He points out that although the United States had given at least $160 million in philanthropy to China, these charities in China, even secular hospitals and schools, are generally preyed upon by the very Chinese people who the charitable workers seek to help. [...] These charities are subject to rampant looting, arson, and murderous mob violence by Chinese people who their government refuses to prosecute. Much of this violence is incited by the anti-foreigner propaganda of the KMT, a party described as being [...] "worse than the Ku Klux Klan at its most degenerate stage", and through US aid to China Townsend suggests that America is actually bankrolling propaganda against itself. Though the missionaries are sincere and hard-working, Townsend finds that they suffer from extreme delusion over the ultimate futility of their goal of reforming the Chinese. The missionaries, he states, have willfully ignored overwhelming evidence that no degree of care or education can uproot the intrinsic sickness of Chinese culture. <b>He</b> <b>calls</b> <b>for</b> an end to all missionary and charitable work in China.|$|E
500|$|Lody {{was also}} the subject of {{literary}} and stage works; a hagiographic biographical account, Lody – Ein Weg um Ehre (Lody – One Way to Honour), was published by Hans Fuchs in 1936 and a play called Lody: vom Leben und Sterben eines deutschen Offiziers (Lody: {{the life and death}} of a German officer), by Walter Heuer, premiered on Germany's National Heroes' Day in 1937. It depicts Lody as brave and patriotic but clumsy, leaving a trail of clues behind him as he travels in the UK: wearing clothes marked [...] "Made in Germany", writing naval secrets on the back of a bus ticket which he loses and a Scotland Yard detective finds, coming to attention when an orchestra in London plays the German naval anthem, arousing suspicion when <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> <b>for</b> German wine while writing secret reports to Berlin, and leaving incriminating letters in the pockets of suits which he sends to be pressed. Lody is arrested in London and sentenced to death. Offered a chance to escape, he refuses and drinks a glass of wine with the firing squad, toasting Anglo-German friendship. He is led out to his execution, saying his final words: [...] "I shall see Germany once more –from the stars." [...] The Dundee Evening Telegraph described the storyline as [...] "quaint".|$|E
500|$|High Prophets, or Hierarchs, are {{the supreme}} {{leaders of the}} theocratic Covenant. Upon {{assuming}} office, each Hierarch picks a new regnal name {{from a list of}} names of former Hierarchs, similar to the practice of some Orthodox Patriarchs. In Halo 2, there are shown to be only three; the Prophets of Truth, Mercy, and Regret (voiced by Michael Wincott, Hamilton Camp and Robin Atkin Downes in Halo 2, respectively; in Halo 3, Truth is voiced by Terence Stamp). The novel [...] reveals that these three Prophets, originally known as the Minister of Fortitude, the Vice-Minister of Tranquility, and the Philologist, plotted to usurp the throne of the Hierarchs; in the process, they hide the truth that humanity is descended from the Covenant gods, the Forerunners, believing that the revelation could shatter the Covenant. During the course of Halo 2, Regret attacks Earth, and then retreats to Delta Halo. There, <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> <b>for</b> reinforcements, but is killed by the Master Chief. Later, Mercy is attacked by the Flood on High Charity; Truth could have saved him, but left him to die so he could have full control over the Covenant. In , Truth is seen inspecting some Engineers around the Forerunner construct near New Mombasa. In Halo 3, Truth also meets his demise {{at the hands of the}} Arbiter when the Prophet attempts to activate all the Halo rings from the Ark. His death become the culmination of the Covenant's downfall.|$|E

500|$|An {{official}} {{synopsis of}} the film was published in The Moving Picture World states: [...] "Jack Thorne, a young artist, finds his efforts unappreciated, {{and he and his}} wife and little daughter {{are on the verge of}} starvation. The final blow comes when his last painting, on which he had built much hope, was rejected by a rich man, whom an artist chum kindly brought to the impoverished studio. Jack decides that he can struggle no longer. Unseen by his wife, he picks up his revolver, puts it in his pocket and goes out, intending to end everything. But his little daughter has watched him; she follows him and stays his hand. Her prayers and entreaties bring him to a realization of what his rash act would mean to the two helpless ones that would be left behind. Penitent and remorseful, he accompanies his child back to their poor home. There he confesses to his wife that it was only the child's timely interference that saved him from ending it all. The mother drops on her knees beside her child, and clasping her in her arms, raises grateful eyes to Heaven in a prayer of thankfulness. Jack, looking up suddenly, sees the beautiful group of mother and child, with a light as if from Heaven upon them. Realizing that [...] is the inspiration and subject for which he has sought in vain, <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> <b>for</b> them not to move, and at once begins his great painting of them, which brings him fame and wealth." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the sixth}} chapter, [...] "Written spells and charms", Merrifield {{discusses}} {{the use of}} the written word in magical contexts. Highlighting archaeological examples from the ancient Graeco-Roman world, he looks at inscriptions on lead tablets that were buried in cemeteries and amphitheatres, both places associated with the dead. Moving on to the use of magic squares, Merrifield highlights various examples of the Sator square in archaeological contexts, before also discussing squares that contained numerical data with astrological significance. He rounds off the chapter with an examination of Post-Medieval curses and charms containing the written word, citing examples that have been found by archaeologists across Britain, hidden inside various parts of buildings. In the seventh chapter, [...] "Charms against witchcraft", he deals with archaeological evidence for a variety of Early Modern and Modern British spells designed to ward off malevolent witchcraft. After briefly discussing the role of holed stone charms, he looks at the evidence for witch bottles, making reference to their relation to beliefs about witches' familiars. Proceeding to focus on 19th- and 20th-century examples, Merrifield discusses the case of James Murrell, an English cunning man, and his involvement with the witch bottle tradition. Merrifield's final chapter, [...] "The ritual of superstition: recognition and potential for study", provides an overview of the entire book, highlighting the evidence of ritual continuity from pre-Christian periods to the present day. Pointing out what he sees as areas of further exploration for archaeologists, <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> <b>for</b> [...] "systematic investigation" [...] of the subject.|$|E
500|$|Through Turkish ambassadorial {{visits and}} other contacts, Europeans gained {{a fascination with}} the [...] "barbarous", noisy sound of these bands, {{and a number of}} European courts {{established}} [...] "Turkish" [...] military ensembles in the late-17th and early 18th centuries. The music played by these ensembles, however, were not authentically Turkish music, but rather compositions in the prevalent European manner. The general enthusiasm quickly spread to opera and concert orchestras, where the combination of bass drum, cymbals, tambourines, and triangles were collectively referred to as [...] "Turkish music". The best-known examples include Haydn's Symphony No. 100, which acquired its nickname, [...] "The Military", from its use of these instruments, and three of Beethoven's works: the [...] "alla marcia" [...] section from the finale of his Symphony No. 9 (an early sketch reads: [...] "end of the Symphony with Turkish music"), his [...] "Wellington's Victory"—or Battle Symphony—with picturesque sound effects (the bass drums are designated as [...] "cannons", side drums represent opposing troops of soldiers, and ratchets the sound of rifle fire), and the [...] "Turkish March" [...] (with the expected bass drum, cymbals, and triangle) and the [...] "Chorus of Dervishes" [...] from his incidental music to The Ruins of Athens, where <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> <b>for</b> the use of every available noisy instrument: castanets, cymbals, and so forth. By the end of the 18th century, the batterie turque had become so fashionable that keyboard instruments were fitted with devices to simulate the bass drum (a mallet with a padded head hitting the back of the sounding board), cymbals (strips of brass striking the lower strings), and the triangle and bells (small metal objects struck by rods). Even when percussion instruments were not actually employed, certain alla turca [...] "tricks" [...] were used to imitate these percussive effects. Examples include the [...] "Rondo alla turca" [...] from Mozart's Piano Sonata, K. 331, and part of the finale of his Violin Concerto, K. 219.|$|E
