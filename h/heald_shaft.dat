40|$|The {{manufacturers}} of weaving equipment recently endeavour to minimise the necessary designing {{plays in the}} weaving loom mechanisms. One of the mechanisms most exposed to stress is the shedding motion that defines the held-shaft stroke. Its end part is the <b>heald</b> <b>shaft.</b> The <b>heald</b> <b>shaft</b> constitutes a problematic assembly of the shedding motion. The design employed presently is characterised by dynamic impact loading caused by designing play in the suspension of healds into the <b>heald</b> <b>shaft.</b> During weaving cycle, the healds fly between the main beams of the <b>heald</b> <b>shaft,</b> producing a considerable force pulse. This paper {{is concerned with the}} description of dynamic behaviour of the existing design on the basis of mathematical modelling and verification of obtained results by means of experimental analysis...|$|E
40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the {{analysis}} of the existing design solution of shedding mechanism. It is characterised by a heald attachment into the <b>heald</b> <b>shaft</b> with a necessary design allowance. The preparation of a mathematical model for the new concept of the heald attaching to the <b>heald</b> <b>shaft</b> frame is explained in this study. A damping element for dissipating the energy created during the heald impact on the carrying wire of the <b>heald</b> <b>shaft</b> is currently used for the high-speed weaving loom. This system makes use of a damping element, fitted in the profile of the rod at an optimum distance from heald eye. This element provides for reduction of the heald velocity before its drop upon the supporting wire because the opposite section of the heald is pressed into the rubber element. The calculated results of the new concept of the heald attaching to the <b>heald</b> <b>shaft</b> frame are compared with the existing solution without application of the damping element...|$|E
50|$|In {{negative}} cam shedding, the <b>heald</b> <b>shafts</b> {{are either}} raised or lowered by the mechanism but are returned by {{the action of}} an external device, usually springs. The maximum number of <b>heald</b> <b>shafts</b> controlled by tappet shedding is 20, but this is not possible in practice.|$|R
50|$|In {{positive}} cam shedding, the heddle (or <b>heald)</b> <b>shafts</b> {{are both}} raised and lowered by the tappets.|$|R
5000|$|Cam shedding, {{also known}} as tappet shedding, is {{the control of the}} {{movement}} of <b>heald</b> <b>shafts</b> in weaving simple constructions by means of cams or tappets.|$|R
50|$|Alternating sets of threads are lifted by {{connecting}} them with string or wires called heddles to another bar, called the shaft (or heddle bar or <b>heald).</b> Heddles, <b>shafts</b> and the couper (lever {{to lift the}} assembly) are called the harness â€” the harness provides for mechanical operation using foot- or hand-operated treadles.After passing a weft thread through the warp, a reed comb is used to beat (compact) the woven weft.|$|R
5000|$|Hattersley Domestic LoomThe Hattersley Domestic Loom {{was part}} of the Hattersley Domestic System that include other {{machines}} such as pirn winder and warping mill. It was a compact machine, combining all the know how and precision engineering of the nineteenth century with the need for a treadle operated loom. This looms has tappets to control up to 8 <b>shafts,</b> <b>healds</b> or boards; most simply have 4 shafts and a set of four 2/2 Twill tappets and four plain weave tappets. 5,6,7,and 8 pick tappets were available. In order to cope with the different gearings the tappet drive cog on the bottom drive shaft could be adjusted and there are two sizes of tapped mounting drive cogs. There was also a Dobby version.|$|R
