And parts of it are just as fun, if not more so, than the earlier games, but {{a laundry list of}} bugs, hardware glitches, and severe multiplayer issues keep the game from reaching its potential." [...] He praised the single-player campaign and the storyline. However, he cited numerous bugs, including no support for Windows 95, despite the box claiming otherwise, and compatibility issues with Windows XP.

He concluded [...] "If you need your new Myth fix and can't wait for a patch, then the best option is to buy the game from a store that accepts returns in case the game doesn't like your particular system setup. If you can play it, <b>focus</b> <b>your</b> efforts on the campaign - it's fun, {{and for the most part}} works as advertised.

Setting limits involves restricting {{the amount of time spent}} on various activities and selecting settings to carefully avoid crowds and noise.
