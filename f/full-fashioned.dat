In the past they were manufactured by cutting the fabric and then sewing it together. Today, thanks to Pio Chiaruttini who patented this new technique, stockings are generally fully knitted and a fake or mock seam is added up the back for a particular fashion look. Some brands also produce seamed hold-ups.|$|E

50|$|Baldock was {{formerly}} {{the location of}} a film processing factory which closed before the company (originally based in Letchworth Garden City) could move in; local folklore has it that it was a silent film studio, {{but this is not the}} case. The building was then bought by the <b>Full-Fashioned</b> Hosiery Company from Halifax, later becoming the Kayser Bondor ladies stocking factory (which temporarily produced parachutes during World War II). Its Art Deco facade still stands as the largest Listed Building in the town; it was converted to a Tesco supermarket in the late 1980s.Another notable building in the town is the thirteenth century Baldock Parish Church of St. Mary the Virgin at the centre of the town. The original church was built in about 1150 by the Knights Templar before being largely rebuilt in about 1330 by the Knights Hospitaller. It is a Grade I listed building.|$|E

The <b>Full-Fashioned</b> Hosiery Workers Union launched an organizing drive in the summer of 1933 in the silk stocking mills around Reading, Pennsylvania. The employers refused to recognize the union, and 10,000 workers went on strike. On August 10, 1933, the NLB mediated a settlement. Known as the [...] "Reading Formula," [...] the settlement consisted of four parts: (1) That the union call off the strike; (2) That all employees be rehired immediately, without retaliation; (3) That the NLB hold elections in which the workers would vote by secret ballot for their own representatives, and that both parties would negotiate a collective bargaining agreement covering wages, hours and working conditions; and (4) That in the event of any disagreement on any matter, the parties would submit the dispute to the NLB for binding arbitration. The [...] "Reading Formula" [...] proved useful in settling large numbers of labor disputes, including strikes in silk mills in Paterson, New Jersey; silk mills in Allentown, Pennsylvania; tool and die factories in Detroit, Michigan; and coal mines in Illinois. By the end of August, however, the [...] "Reading Formula" [...] was being opposed by employers, whose company unions were losing representational elections to worker-controlled unions. Wolman and Teagle, chairmen of the NRA's Labor Advisory Board and Industry Advisory Board (respectively), worked out an agreement to accommodate industry concerns regarding implementation of Section 7(a) of the National Industrial Recovery Act, but President Roosevelt rejected this agreement on September 15. But the situation deteriorated through December, to the point where major employers were not longer taking their labor disputes to the Board. To strengthen the NLB's powers vis-a-vis employers, President Roosevelt issued Executive Order 6511 on December 16, 1933. The order ratified the Board's prior activities, including its decisions and representational elections. The order also authorized the Board to [...] "settle by mediation, conciliation or arbitration all controversies between employers and employees which tend to impede the purpose of the National Industrial Recovery Act." [...] But E.O. 6511 said nothing about elections, and did not address the Board's enforcement powers. Roosevelt issued a new order, E.O. 6580, on February 1, 1934. The order gave the Board explicit power to authorize, upon a showing by a substantial number of employees, representational elections to determine majority status, and appeared to give the winning organization exclusive representation for employees in the bargaining unit (although this interpretation was widely contested). Upset with the increasingly regulatory approach being taken toward national labor relations policy, Wolman attempted to resign from the NLB on February 24, 1934, but was persuaded by Roosevelt, Johnson and Wagner to withdraw his resignation.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Transformation of textile {{industry}} is a very urgent mission for China. Our present problems include decreasing of profit from export, increasing of cost (labour and energy), competition from other developing countries, and lack of innovative products, etc. In order to increase the profit and find new future, some studies have been tried to explore some innovative methods to shift traditional textile produce patterns. This paper discusses some design examples from a perspective of developing branded finished products for consumer markets to instead of providing fabric materials. A detailed case study on the <b>full-fashioned</b> woven good is demonstrated here to explain some chances, advantages, disadvantages, and threatens. It is believed that the transformation of {{textile industry}} in China has to be tied with our own innovation of advanced technology and creative design concepts, which can provide some solution to the coming problems of environment, energy, and labour, etc...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A {{thrust of}} the study is to compare {{different}} design principles for advanced creation of <b>full-fashioned</b> weaving. According to the present integrated design mode, three technical elements of weaving design have been identified in the course of creation, i. e. mixed yarns, integrated structures, and integrated patterns. The design process is the key to successful integrated design, including allocation of materials of warp and weft, different interlacing locations that suitable for clothing structures, and the method of patterning in the current CAD digital processing. The entire design mode is different from the previous laminar woven textile designs. Experiments have shown that, with the shapeable materials, the fine silk yarns are perfect to weave and mould the three dimensional dress for women. Besides, rich and novel textures can be embellished inherently on the surfaces of the full-fashion woven clothing. The expanded creative dimensions of woven textiles contributed an added value to silk products produced by current machines. Meanwhile the new features of Seamless Woven Fashion (SWF) further widened the creative scope of fashion design. The study has contributed to the future research and development of advanced woven textiles as the end products...|$|E

Using {{a case study of}} one singular group of men and women, who worked at the Berkshire Knitting Mill, a <b>full-fashioned</b> hosiery mill in Reading, Pennsylvania during the early twentieth century, it seeks to understand the meaning in the everyday worklives of people. It questions how people reconstitute the world of work and what meanings they bestow upon the past and present as conjured in their stories, and how these stories in turn shaped them. It also questions how the policies and events of the time affected their lives. ^ The methodology of this study is the use of the life history that emerges in the person 2 ̆ 7 s reminiscences. The researcher 2 ̆ 7 s role is that of a co-creator, through her presence and guidance of conversation in the interview setting. ^ Using a phenomenological approach, where we learn people 2 ̆ 7 s conceptions of their everyday life experience, it is anticipated that the emic processes, the processes from within a group, may shed new light on ways of understanding the meaning of people 2 ̆ 7 s lives, in this case, how older people reconstitute the past, the meaning of past work in people 2 ̆ 7 s lives, the role of ritual and storytelling in social work. ^ The findings of this study contribute to the understanding of productive aging by learning the resources that people use to sustain their lives and culture. The study 2 ̆ 7 s findings show that the work ethic {{is an integral part of}} this older generation of workers 2 ̆ 7 identity, and that social security and medicare are 2 ̆ 2 taken for granted 2 ̆ 2 and essential entitlement programs that provide them with a decent quality of life. ...|$|E
