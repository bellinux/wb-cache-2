25|$|I will {{no longer}} {{participate}} in this transparent ploy to gather media attention for Finkelstein and his publisher. I answer all of his charges fully in Chapter 16 of my forthcoming book The Case For Peace, {{to be published by}} Wiley in August. My book deals with important and current issues, such as the prospects for peace in the immediate future. Finkelstein's deals with the irrelevant past that both Israelis and Palestinians are trying to put behind them. Let the marketplace judge our books. As far as I'm concerned, the public controversy is over and I will comment no further on the false charges leveled by Finkelstein and the UCP. Let them henceforth pay for their own publicity, instead of trying to <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> cheap by launching phony attacks against me.|$|E
500|$|Cliff White of NME {{called the}} album [...] "almost a voyeur's delight", {{and was not}} {{favorable}} of Gaye's sensual themes, stating [...] "Although getting down, getting mellow, and getting it on are paramount considerations {{in the privacy of}} my own home, I don't particularly want to be party to someone else's night life. Not on record anyway... Like peeking through the windows of the Gaye residence in the wee wee hours. Perhaps that's your kick, but personally I find it a mite frustrating." [...] White also criticized the album's sound, describing the songs as [...] "all expressions of the same mood. Sensual, satisfied, and spaced out", and calling I Want You [...] "simply the explorative aftermath of Let's <b>Get</b> <b>It</b> <b>On.</b> <b>The</b> sweet nuthin's of a drowsy, sweat-streaked lover." [...] Robert Christgau of The Village Voice wrote favorably of the album's sound quality. However, he criticized the lyrical content, as well as Ware's involvement in songwriting, stating [...] "was it Ware who instructed Marvin to eliminate all depth and power from his voice? I mean, if you're into insisting on sex it's in bad taste to whine about it." ...|$|E

[...] After a few abortive efforts by Fey's co-writers, who also made [...] "rural juror" [...] sound akin to [...] "ruhhr-juhhrr," [...] everyone was so pleased that [...] " [...] wanted to hurry up and <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> air before someone else did." [...] Jenna's film, The Rural Juror, was first mentioned three episodes earlier, in [...] "Tracy Does Conan", and referenced several times later. A running joke throughout the series was the difficulty in pronouncing the film's title, so that everyone thought it was called something different. Throughout the episode, the film was called [...] "Roar Her, Gem Her" [...] by Liz; and also [...] "Oral Germ Whore" [...] and [...] "Roaring Junior" [...] by Pete. This episode also features the first mention of Mitch Lemon (Andy Richter), Liz's brother. Mitch has a form of amnesia, named Trauma Induced Niveaphasia, due to a skiing accident in December 1985.|$|E

2500|$|Gaye {{eventually}} {{recorded the}} final {{versions of the}} song during the Let's Get It On recording sessions, recording several takes. One of the alternate takes was later issued on the deluxe edition re-issue of Let's Get It On and featured the saxophone intro by Eli Fontaine as the [...] "Head Title" [...] versions had done. In the version that was overdubbed for the final track listing of Let's <b>Get</b> <b>It</b> <b>On,</b> <b>the</b> saxophone intro {{in the beginning was}} edited out. There also appeared to be sounds of microphone bleed that was reverberated while Gaye was singing and simple drum beats. In the alternate take of [...] "Come Get to This" [...] after the song ends, the voices of Gaye and Denise Gordy taken from the earlier 1970 sessions, could be heard before the beginning of the alternate vocal of [...] "Distant Lover". In the finished version, Gaye sung in both a falsetto and a tenor voice, begging and pleading for his lover to [...] "come back home" [...] in a raspy growl. According to the liner notes of the Deluxe reissue of Let's Get It On, it took twenty separate recording sessions before Marvin was satisfied with the song-more dates than it took to record the entire What's Going On album.

6000|$|The gay life {{depicted}} in the two last chapters, while it kept Goldsmith {{in a state of}} continual excitement, aggravated the malady which was impairing his constitution; yet his increasing perplexities in money matters drove him to the dissipation of society as a relief from solitary care.

He had long since finished his new comedy, yet the year 1772 passed away without his being able to <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> stage.

A long and baffling negotiation was carried on between Goldsmith and Colman, the manager of Covent Garden; who retained the play in his hands until the middle of January (1773), without coming to a decision. The theatrical season was rapidly passing away, and Goldsmith's pecuniary difficulties were augmenting and pressing on him. We may judge of his anxiety by the following letter: ...|$|E
60|$|One fellow, {{like a black}} Hercules, put his wrapper on {{his head}}, and his head under a bale, which I thought would crush him down into the surf, but he walked ashore with an easy {{springing}} motion, that showed he possessed more than sufficient power. Another man, hitting Hercules a sounding smack as he went by, received a mighty cask on his head that should have cracked it--but it didn't. Then I observed the boatmen place on the gunwale an enormous flat box, which seemed to me about ten feet square. It was corrugated iron, they told me, of, I forget, how many hundredweight. A crowd of Kafirs got under it, and carried it ashore as easily {{as if it had}} been a butterfly. But this was nothing to a box which next made its appearance from the bowels of that capacious boat. It was in the form of a cube, and must have measured nine or ten feet in all directions. Its contents I never ascertained, but the difficulty with which the boatmen got it rested on the side of the boat proved its weight to be worthy of its size. To <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> shoulders of the Kafirs was the next difficulty. It was done by degrees. As the huge case was pushed over the edge, Kafir after Kafir put his head or shoulder to it, until there were, I think, from fifteen to twenty men beneath the weight;--then, slowly, it left the boat, and began to move towards the shore.|$|E
