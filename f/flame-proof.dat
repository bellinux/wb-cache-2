40|$|The {{modification}} of classical polymers {{is one of}} the most effective approaches in order to increase the innovation potential of plastics which are characterized by good mechanical properties and good possibility. The authors use organic esters of phosphorous acid to modify aliphatic polyamides in such a way that defined property profiles result as a function of employed material. Especially, the blockage of terminal amino groups and the <b>flame-proofing</b> equipment of polyamides. In the scope of a research project, basic investigations of the reaction behaviour of additives with aliphatic polyamides have to be carried out. the most suitable additive is a derivate of 6 -hydroxy-(6 H) -dibenz-(c,e) -(1, 2) -oxaphosphorine according to the polyamides PA 6 and PA 12. A combination of 50 % reaction behavior and 50 % phosphorus content leads to the best results. The reactive conversion of PA 6 and PA 12 with this additive is influenced by temperature, concentration of the additive, residence time and shear. According to the minimization of terminal amino group, increasing thermal stability and flame equipment the optimal conditions of reaction are determined as a function of the used polyamide. The reduction of the terminal amino group depends on the amount of additive at all polyamides investigated. The reduction of the terminal amino groups increases the thermooxidative stability. This can be detected by means of the reduction of the tendency to get yellow. The unsatisfactory results of the investigations of the thermooxidative stabilization of PA 12 require combinations with other stabilizations such as copper(I) compounds. With respect to the <b>flame-proofing</b> equipment, PA 6 and PA 12 are reacted with PCIII ME 50 / 50, PCIII ME 37 / 65 and the development product 3710. 35 from Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe (Federal Republic of Germany).

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thes is in textile conservaHon deal s {{with issues}} cancerning flame-relardant finishes on textiles, and whether flame-praofing chemicals may develop inlo {{a problem for}} the preservation and conservation of treated textiles. The fundamental questions deal! with concern which textiles are being treated with <b>flame-proofing</b> agents, as weil as degradation, health and environmental aspects. To address these quesHons mainly wrilten sources have been studied. Previous research on the effect of <b>flame-proofing</b> agents on textiles in museum collections is scarce, which might be why there has been minimal aUention given this subject in the field of textile conservation. Furnishings in public places need to meet the requirements for local and national fire regula lions and are therefore often subjected to fire-proofing treatments. Objects thaI might have a fire-proofing treatment are theatre curlains, drapes, upholstered furniture and textile art and hangings. Textiles made of wool have good thermal properties and usually do not require any added chemicals to be fire-proof. Cellulose-based textiles, on the other hand, are easily ignited and burn readily. They are therefore more often given a flame-prooHng finish. Flame-retardants have the ability to delay ignition but cannot prevent it completely. The most common flame-retardanls can be divided into four groups: inorganic-, organophosphoros-, halogenated- and nitrogen-based flame retardants. Som e of the commonly used flame-retardants have appeared lo cause damage to both the environment and human health. Three subslances (tris (2, 3 -d ibromopropyl) phosphate, tris (1 -aziridinyl) phosphine oxid e and polybrominated biphenyls) have subsequently been banned in Sweden for use with textiles that are worn in contacl wilh Ihe skin. Problems concerning flame-retardants' degrading properties on textiles were reported as earlyas the 1960 s, but there has been little further research into the subject. A chemical which has been frequently used is ammonium phosphate, Unfortunately, it has been shown lo degrade textile fibres and cause a colour change. Textile conservators may sometimes need lo test the presence of flameretardants in textiles to be able to choose the best conservation treaiment. The best way is to do an elemental analys is. One of the conclusions of this work is that flame-retardanl finishes {{have a negative effect on}} textiles, and that conservators and museum persannei who handle textile collections need lo be aware of this. ThaI is one way to help prevent further unnecessary treatments, especially on works of art. By discussing the matter with the local emergency services il may be possible lo find other solutions.

Borate compounds have properties of multifunctional smoke suppressants, flame retardants, and afterglow suppressants. In this study, borate was coupled {{onto the surface of}} viscose rayon felt. Coupling and carbonization were confirmed by attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infra-red (ATR FTIR). The initial carbonization temperature was certified with ATR FTIR, elemental analysis of carbon, and thermogravimetric analysis. In the carbonization step, all chemical groups of the surface of the viscose rayon felt degraded to the various gases. Moreover, the weight percentage of the carbon element increased with increasing carbonization temperature. Initial rapid thermal degradation temperatures of viscose rayon prepared at various temperatures increased with the increasing reaction tem-perature. The activation energy was calculated with the Freeman and Carroll method. The activation energy of borate-coupled viscose rayon decreased much more than before coupling. However, the activation energy increased with the increasing carbonization temperature in the carbonization step. Viscose rayon borates showed higher limiting oxygen index (LOI) values and volumetric resistance rate values than viscose rayon phosphates. In this article, the relationship between the activation energy and LOI is studied. The synthesized viscose rayon borate is found to be highly effective as a flam...|$|R

40|$|Complexes of {{cellulose}} phosphate with transition metals such as chromium, manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel, copper, zinc, zirconium, molybdenum, silver, cadmium and mercury have {{been characterized by}} reflectance UV-visible spectra. The thermal behaviour {{of cellulose}} and the metal complexes of cellulose phosphate in air has been studied by differential thermal analysis and thermogravimetry from ambient temperature to 750 Â°C. From the resulting data, various thermodynamic parameters for different stages of thermal degradation can be obtained following the method of Broido. The activation energies for decomposition of cellulose and metal complexes of cellulose phosphatewere found to kJ molâˆ’ 1. Pyrolysis-mass spectrometric studies of metal complexes of cellulose phosphate using soft ionization modes such as field ionization and field desorption give very low abundances of volatile products in the spectra compared with the yields with untreated cellulose. The IR and reflectance UV-visible spectra of the pyrolysis residues of metal complexes of cellulose phosphate indicate that dehydration takes place and the metal complexes are stable up to 250 Â°C.

40|$|Electrical {{apparatuses}} {{for use in}} {{the presence}} of explosive gas atmospheres have to be specially designed to prevent them from igniting the explosive gas. Flameproof design implies that electrical components producing incendiary electrical sparks, e. g. relays and switches, be contained in enclosures that not only withstand the maximum pressure of an internal gas explosion. In addition any holes or slits in the enclosure wall have to be designed {{in such a way that}} they will not transmit a gas explosion inside the enclosure to an explosive gas atmosphere outside it. Designs of a variety of flameproof enclosure joints, including plane flanged joints, are specified in detail in international standards (IEC) requiring that the maximum permissible average roughness of any flame gap surface has to be < 6. 3 Î¼m. The standards also require that any damaged joint surface has to be restored to the original quality prescribed in standards (IEC). However, the standards do not provide any guidance as to what level of damage is considered significant. As a result even minor mechanical or corrosive damage of flame path surfaces gives rise to expensive overhaul and repair of flame proof apparatuses. In fact, this is mandatory in spite of the fact that a generous safety factor is included in the requirements to maximum permissible gap widths. For example, for the plane-flange configuration and explosive gas (propane) used in the present investigation, the maximum permissible width in a practical apparatus is only 0. 4 mm, whereas the real limiting value is 0. 92 mm. The purpose of the present investigation has been to obtain some experimental guidance as to what level of damage of flame gap surfaces is required to significantly reduce the <b>flame-proofing</b> effect of flame gaps in flameproof electrical apparatuses. The maximum experimental safe gap (MESG) of an explosive gas mixture is the largest gap width between the two parts of a circular plane joint of 25 mm breadth in a standardized test, which prevents transmission of a gas explosion on the inside of the gap to an outside explosive gas mixtures. Normally the purpose of MESG experiments is to compare MESGs of different gases and vapours, using the same smooth flame gap surface in all experiments. However, in the present investigation MESG has been used as a parameter for judging whether various kinds of significant damage of the gap surface had any noticeable effect on the ability of the flame gap to prevent flame transmission. A significant reduction of MESG compared with that obtained with a standard undamaged surface (standard roughness of < 6. 3 Î¼m) would mean that the particular type of damage under test had destroyed the gap efficiency significantly. On the other hand a significant increase of MESG compared with that for the undamaged surface would mean the damage had in fact significantly increased the gap efficiency. In the experiments performed in the present work premixed 4. 2 vol. % propane in air was used as the test gas mixture in all the experiments. Two different apparatuses were used, viz. a plane circular-flange apparatus (PCFA) and a plane rectangular-slit apparatus (PRSA).

Using an open reaction vessel, urea, sulphamic acid and phosphorous acid gave an exothermic reaction over the temperature range 120 - 140 'C with gas liberation. The condensates thus formed contained aliphatic polyamide chains, containing urea groups and sulphur and phosphorus residues. According to the type and amount of initial materials, various urea condensates, capable of imparting different degrees of flame retardancy, were synthesized. The sulphamic acid/urea (SIU), phosphoric acid /urea (P AIU), sulphamic acid/phosphoric acid/urea (SJPAIU) and also sulphamic acid/phosphorous acid/urea (S/PH/U) condensates were produced. When these urea condensates were cooled down, Water-soluble products were produced, and these materials could be applied to the textile substrate using a pad-bake technique. Cotton fabrics were treated with these condensates: typically a pad-liquor contained 500 g/l of urea condensate, 10 g/I of wetting agent; fabric was padded to 80 % wet pick-up, dried (80 'C) and cured for two minutes (l 65 'C). These urea condensates, when cured on cotton at high temperature (16 S'C), change to water-insoluble products; as a result of reactions between cellulose hydroxyl group and the urea condensate a complicated polymer structure network can be produced on the surface of a fabric and a flame retardant effect imparted. The SIU condensate only produced partial FR properties, {{while the rest of the}} compounds produced completely flame retardant fabrics. FT-IR analysis and NMR analysis was carried out on the urea condensates and also on the flame retardant fabrics. DSC thermal analysis was performed on the initial materials, urea condensates and also the treated fabrics. The characterization of urea condensate treated fabrics were studied further using SEM and energy dispersion X-ray micro analysis. In the case of the urea condensates a small amount of sulphamic acid has a significant influence on the reaction between phosphating agents and urea; in fact the presence of SA reduces the exothennic reaction. However, at high concentrations of urea, the exothermic reaction occurred at a higher temperature and a hard crystalline product was produced, thus application required dissolution in warm water (50 â€¢C). A urea condensate of 1 mole sulphamic acid, 1 mole phosphorus acid and up to 18 moles of urea could produce a durable flame retardant finish on cotton fabric. A higher amount of phosphorous acid in the urea ~ondensate products (IS/ 2 PH/IOU) reduced the exotherm temperature and a high quality flame retardant effect was produced on cotton fabric. The evenness of phosphorus and sulphur elemental distribution on the surface and cross section of treated fibre was confirmed using SEM. Desirable flame retardancy effects from the urea condensate treated fabrics were obtained with comparatively low levels of sulphur and phosphorus (in comparison with the current commercially available Proban and Pyrovatex treated fabrics). However, in the washing process of the condensate-treated fabr ics, no significant reduction in P or S concentration/level was found. The excellent flame retardancy of the new system can be explained due to the N/P/S containing polymer formed on the surface of the fabric. DSC results from the treated fabrics confirmed these observations. Fabrics treated with Pro ban and Pyrovatex showed a very sharp exotherm after 300 'C, but for fabrics treated with the urea condensates only a small exotherm effect appeared. In FT-IR analysis and NMR analysis, the production of aliphatic polymer chains of different length was verified, however, for the insoluble product formed in situ by heating at 160 'C, and also for the condensates formed on the fabric at high temperature, a complicated polymer structure was shown to contain a possible combination of cyanuric acid, cyclic urea, triazine and melamine. All these materials have been identified in the FT-IR spectra of a water- insoluble urea product formed at 160 â€¢C. To make a model reaction with other hydroxyl group-containing substrates, starch and polyvinyl alcohol were treated with the ISI 2 PH/IOU condensate. The flame retardancy effect on both these treated substrates was confirmed by DSC thermal analysis. Advantages of this new wash-durable FR system over the currently available Proban/Pyrovatex systems include: no formaldehyde, low cost, ready availability of materials, simplicity of the treatment (no specific equipment required), and maintenance of all the desirable physical properties of the fabric, such as soft handle, acceptable tensile strength, no effect on dyed grounds and also no yellowing of the fabric.
