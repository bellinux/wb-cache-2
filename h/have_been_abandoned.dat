5|$|After Aymer's {{death in}} 1324, the castle passed by {{marriage}} to Lawrence, Lord Hastings, and {{was held in}} the Hastings family until 1390, when Reginald Lord Grey de Ruthin acquired it.

In the 6th centuryAD the hill top was entirely abandoned and was used only for agriculture during the medieval period.|$|E

If the governor's objection had stood the project would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>abandoned</b> and a new site chosen. In August 2004, the repository became an election issue, when Senator John Kerry (D) said that he would abandon the plans if elected.|$|E

The {{population}} size of Carnaby's cockatoo fell by over 50% in 45 years, {{and up to}} a third of their traditional breeding grounds in the Wheatbelt <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>abandoned.</b> The bird is part of an annual census, the Great Cocky count, that has been held every year since 2009 to track the population change of Carnaby's and other black cockatoos. The 2016 Great Cocky Count counted 10,919 Carnaby's black cockatoos, indicating the population had declined by 50% on the Perthâ€“Peel Coastal Plain since 2010, dropping by around 10% each year. The total population is estimated to consist of 40,000 individuals.|$|E

5|$|From the 1st century AD onwards, Cassel {{developed}} into a key urban centre for the whole region with an extensive road network converging on the hill. Towards {{the end of the}} 3rd century, however, repeated invasions of Germanic tribes caused devastation throughout the region and at least 80% of settlements in the area are thought to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>abandoned,</b> accompanied by a general economic decline. Cassel was fortified with a circuit of walls at around this time but suffered its own decline, which was reflected in its loss of status as a regional capital; Tournai took over as the capital of the newly constituted Civitas Turnacensium.|$|E
5|$|Many ragstone {{quarries}} <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>abandoned</b> and backfilled once exhausted. When Ditton Quarry {{closed down}} in 1984, quarrying operations {{had left behind}} a legacy of a lime-rich soil which formed {{the foundation of a}} thriving habitat for plants and wildlife; 140 wild flowers (including five that are rare in Kent), 18 butterfly species, and 50 bird species have been recorded. It is also home to foxes, rabbits, frogs, toads and newts. The quarry is now a Site of Nature Conservation Importance (SNCI). Public access is free.|$|E

5|$|African {{tribes in}} several {{countries}} have termites as totems, {{and for this reason}} tribe members are forbidden to eat the reproductive alates. Termites are widely used in traditional popular medicine; they are used as treatments for diseases and other conditions such as asthma, bronchitis, hoarseness, influenza, sinusitis, tonsillitis and whooping cough. In Nigeria, Macrotermes nigeriensis is used for spiritual protection and to treat wounds and sick pregnant women. In Southeast Asia, termites are used in ritual practices. In Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand, termite mounds are commonly worshiped among the populace. Abandoned mounds are viewed as structures created by spirits, believing a local guardian dwells within the mound; this is known as Keramat and Datok Kong. In urban areas, local residents construct red-painted shrines over mounds that <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>abandoned,</b> where they pray for good health, protection and luck.|$|E
5|$|For {{these reasons}} the ancients instead settled {{at the head}} of the bay in what is today known as the Campo (hinterland) of Gibraltar. The town of Carteia, near the {{location}} of the modern Spanish town of San Roque, was founded by the Phoenicians around 950 BC on the site of an early settlement of the native Turdetani people. The Carthaginians took control of the town by 228 BC and it was captured by the Romans in 206 BC. It subsequently became Pompey's western base in his campaign of 67 BC against the pirates that menaced the Mediterranean Sea at the time. Carteia appears to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>abandoned</b> after the Vandals sacked it in 409 AD during their march through Roman Hispania to Africa. The region subsequently fell under the rule of the Christianised Visigoths.|$|E
5|$|If it was {{necessary}} to seize control of a castle an army could either launch an assault or lay siege. It was more efficient to starve the garrison out than to assault it, particularly for the most heavily defended sites. Without relief from an external source, the defenders would eventually submit. Sieges could last weeks, months, and in rare cases years if the supplies of food and water were plentiful. A long siege could slow down the army, allowing help to come or for the enemy to prepare a larger force for later. Such an approach was not confined to castles, but was also applied to the fortified towns of the day. On occasion, siege castles would be built to defend the besiegers from a sudden sally and would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>abandoned</b> after the siege ended one way or another.|$|E

5|$|Originally {{conceived}} as a freeway linking Scituate with suburban Warwick, the proposed alignment of Route 37 was later shortened to an alignment linking I-295 with I-95. Construction on the freeway began in 1963 and was completed by 1969. An eastward extension across upper Narragansett Bay was proposed in 1966; this proposal would have extended Route 37 north to I-195 and I-295 in Attleboro, Massachusetts, completing a beltway around the city of Providence. This extended route was approved and given the I-895 designation in 1968, but the extension was ultimately canceled by the Rhode Island Department of Transportation (RIDOT). In the 1980s, Route 37 was included in proposals for an eastward extension of Interstate 84 from Hartford, Connecticut to Rhode Island, but this alignment was also canceled. RIDOT has long-range plans to extend Route 37 east to Route 117 in Downtown Warwick, but plans for a westward extension <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>abandoned.</b>|$|E
5|$|The text is a royal {{building}} inscription, a genre {{which had}} no equivalent in Old Persian literature. It illustrates how Cyrus co-opted local traditions and symbols to legitimize his conquest and control of Babylon. Many elements of the text were drawn from long-standing Mesopotamian themes of legitimizing rule in Babylonia: the preceding king is reprimanded and he is proclaimed to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>abandoned</b> by the gods for his wickedness; the new king has gained power through the divine will of the gods; the new king rights the wrongs of his predecessor, addressing {{the welfare of the}} people; the sanctuaries of the gods are rebuilt or restored, offerings to the gods are made or increased and the blessings of the gods are sought; and repairs are made to the whole city, in the manner of earlier rightful kings.|$|E
5|$|An infant with {{a severe}} heart {{condition}} is admitted in neonatology, and is revealed to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>abandoned</b> in a schoolyard by his biological mother, whose identity lies between four pre-adolescents. Montgomery quickly becomes emotionally involved in the case, reliving the feelings she went through after aborting the child conceived with Dr. Mark Sloan (Eric Dane). Shepherd and O'Malley get quarantined after an outburst at the hospital, due to a patient suspected of having the plague. Their incapacity to leave the hospital leads to numerous confessions between the two, including Shepherd's reveal of his desire to divorce his wife and reconcile with Grey. Dr. Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez) takes {{a leave of absence}} from the hospital, in a continuous attempt to bond with the grieving interns, who do not approve of her relationship with O'Malley. When a patient, Giselle Toussant (Elizabeth Goldstein), is admitted to the hospital, and ultimately dies in Dr. Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson)'s care, she begins to question her abilities as a surgeon, due to the guilt over the death of both Toussant and Duquette, whom she also performed surgery on. At the conclusion of the episode, Stevens overcomes her grief and gets off the floor, which metaphorically expresses her desire to move on.|$|E
