40|$|RT-real time PCR {{was used}} for the {{detection}} of 13 viruses in 768 samples of Vitis vinifera cv. Sangiovese collected from nine Tuscanian districts (Italy). Analysis of virus distribution was carried out on 482 samples infected with viruses responsible for <b>infectious</b> <b>degeneration</b> or associated with leafroll, fleck and rugose wood diseases that are included in the European (2005 / 43 /EC) and Italian (DM 07 / 07 / 2006 and DM 24 / 06 / 2008) directives. Viruses associated with rugose wood disease were the most common (90 %), Grapevine rupestris stem pitting-associated virus, which is not regulated, was found in more than 80 % of infected samples, and Grapevine leafroll-associated virus 3 was the most frequent among EU-regulated viruses followed by Grapevine fleck virus. Grapevine virus A, a virus regulated in Italy, was found in more than 30 % of infected vines whereas the presence of other non-regulated viruses such as Grapevine virus D (4 %), Grapevine leafroll-associated virus 4 (GLRaV- 4), GLRaV- 4 strains 5 and 9 was low (1 %). These findings indicate the need of implementing the European regulation for the production of high quality planting material...|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} studies have {{established}} that vertical transmission of viruses is an important phenomenon affecting a wide range of viruses, especially as a result of breeding programs. Nevertheless, the presence of virus in a seed, does not always lead to seedling infection. In grapevine, seed transmission has been reported for many nepoviruses, but {{little is known about the}} other virus associated diseases such as Leafroll, Rugose wood complex and Fleck diseases, that are considered by Italian legislation on certification of grapevine propagation material, together with <b>infectious</b> <b>degeneration.</b> Thus, the aim of this study is monitoring the virological condition of seedlings obtained by crosses between infected parentals, analyzing the sanitary status of seedlings after the transfer in experimental fields. In this study, 50 progeny plants from three different traditionally crossbreed seeded and seedless table grape cultivars were investigated for the detection of nine grapevine viruses. It was observed that the viral state of parentals was quite compromised, while viruses were not detected in any of the 150 progeny plants, demonstrating that the main grapevine viruses are at low risk for seed transmission. These results could make it possible to reduce the precautions to obtain propagation material free from infectious diseases and also suggest to consider reproduction as a new procedure of sanitation in breeding programs...|$|E
40|$|An {{in vitro}} {{grafting}} method adapting the usual “indexing by green grafting” technique (Walter et al., 1990) to in vitro culture conditions was tested. The local grapevine varieties Khamri Tozeur, Akhel Meguergueb, Jerbi Degueche, Asli and Jebbi, infected respectively with <b>infectious</b> <b>degeneration,</b> leafroll, vein mosaic, corky bark and vein necrosis diseases, were used. Virus expression was greater on media having {{a greater number}} of nutrients such as the Van Hoof (1974) medium containing 12 macronutrients. On the other hand, the addition of BAP (0. 25 mg l- 1) to the medium reduced external virus symptoms on newly sprouted axillary shoots. When these shoots were transferred to fresh culture medium supplemented with IBA (0. 1 mg l- 1), typical and specific symptoms of major virus diseases clearly developed. Re-grafting of axillary shoots on the fragment of an infested clone can be used to overcome difficulties related to corky bark and vein mosaic symptom expression. We also demonstrated that viruses occur in general in mixed infections. The symptoms of a given virus become evident only when favourable conditions to it arise. Our research is still working on reducing the time of detecting virus and virus-like diseases. This is essential for sanitary selection of grapevine plants...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Corneal {{collagen}} cross-linking (CxL) is a prevalent surgical {{method for}} the management of keratoconus. However, literature suggests that, further to keratoconus, CxL has a beneficial impact on a series of corneal related diseases and states. This article attempts to provide a contemporary review for all additional applications of CxL. Specifically, it outlines the most recent studies that demonstrate the beneficial impact of CxL for iatrogenic ectasias, pellucid marginal <b>degeneration,</b> <b>infectious</b> keratitis, bullous keratitopathy, and for ulcerative keratitis. The outcome of this review indicates that CxL could serve as a primary or adjuvant therapeutic modality for all aforementioned corneal-related pathologic states...|$|R
40|$|Keratoconus is a {{condition}} characterized by biomechanical instability of the cornea, presenting in a progressive, asymmetric and bilateral way. Corneal collagen crosslinking (CXL) with riboflavin and Ultraviolet-A (UVA) is a new technique of corneal tissue strengthening that combines the use of riboflavin as a photo sensitizer and UVA irradiation. Studies showed that CXL was effective in halting the progression of keratoconus {{over a period of}} up to four years. The published studies also revealed a reduction of max K readings by more than 2 D, while the postoperative spherical equivalent (SEQ) was reduced by an average of more than 1 D and refractive cylinder decreased by about 1 D. The major indication for the use of CXL is to inhibit the progression of corneal ecstasies, such as keratoconus and pellucid marginal degeneration. CXL may also be effective in the treatment and prophylaxis of iatrogenic keratectasia, resulting from excessively aggressive photo ablation. This treatment has been used to treat infectious corneal ulcers with apparent favorable results. Most recent studies demonstrate the beneficial impact of CXL for iatrogenic ecstasies, pellucid marginal <b>degeneration,</b> <b>infectious</b> keratitis, bullous keratopathy and ulcerative keratitis. Several long-term and short-term complications of CXL have been studied and documented. The possibility of a secondary infection after the procedure exists because the patient is subject to epithelial debridement and the application of a soft contact lens. Formation of temporary corneal haze, permanent scars, endothelial damage, treatment failure, sterile infiltrates, bullous keratopathy and herpes reactivation are the other reported complications of this procedure...|$|R
40|$|International audienceBackground and Aims: Xiphinema {{index and}} X. diversicaudatum are {{nematodes}} that transmit the {{grapevine fanleaf virus}} and the Arabis mosaic virus, respectively. These viruses are the two agents mainly responsible for the disease that causes the most economic damage to grapevines worldwide. The <b>infectious</b> <b>degeneration</b> of grapevines affects vine performance and grape composition. The control of Xiphinema populations by soil disinfection is now impossible because of the removal from the market of the last available chemical treatments. In this study, saponins are assessed as an alternative treatment to control nematode populations. Methods and Results: The nematicidal effect of saponins from Gypsophila paniculata roots was tested against X. index and X. diversicaudatum. In aqueous media, a concentration of 1 mg/mL {{was associated with a}} mortality of greater than 95 % in both nematodes, while in rearing soil, 73 % of X. index and 85 % of X. diversicaudatum were killed by 150 μg of saponins per gram of soil. In addition, an ecotoxicological study was undertaken on two soil bio-indicators (the mycorrhizal fungus Glomus mosseae and soil nitrification) that revealed that they were not affected by Gy. paniculata saponins at a nematicidal concentration. In the soil, investigation of the major Gy. paniculata root saponins revealed that these molecules were completely degraded in the soil within 4 days. Conclusion: We show that Gy. paniculata saponins are an efficient and environmentally friendly treatment against two nematodes that transmit grapevine fanleaf virus. Significance of the Study: This saponin-based alternative to chemical treatments could provide an environmentally safe and efficient solution for vine growers to use against grapevine fanleaf vector nematodes...|$|E
