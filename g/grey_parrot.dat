Like amazon parrots and macaws, cockatoos frequently develop cloacal papillomas. The relationship with malignancy is unknown, as is the cause, although a parrot papilloma virus has been isolated from an African <b>grey</b> <b>parrot</b> with the condition.|$|E
5|$|An {{unidentified}} dark parrot seen {{alive by}} the Swedish naturalist Fredrik Hasselqvist in Africa {{was given the}} name Psittacus obscurus by Linnaeus in 1758, who again synonymised it with the Mascarene parrot in 1766. Because of this association, some authors believed {{it was from the}} Mascarene Islands as well, but this dark parrot's description differs from that of the Mascarene parrot. This disagreement led some authors to use now-invalid combinations of the scientific names, such as Mascarinus obscurus and Coracopsis obscura. The unidentified parrot may have been an African <b>grey</b> <b>parrot</b> (Psittacus erithacus) instead.|$|E

40|$|A few {{animal species}} {{are capable of}} vocal learning. Parrots are well known for their vocal {{imitation}} abilities. In this study, we investigated whether African <b>grey</b> <b>parrots</b> (Psittacus erithacus) emit specific vocalizations in specific contexts. We first described the vocal repertoire and its ontogenesis of four captive <b>grey</b> <b>parrots.</b> After a comparison with vocalizations emitted by wild and other captive African <b>grey</b> <b>parrots,</b> we observed that only three call categories were shared by all <b>grey</b> <b>parrots</b> populations, suggesting that isolated populations of parrots develop population-specific calls. Then, we artificially provoked ten different contexts and recorded vocalizations of four captive <b>grey</b> <b>parrots</b> in these situations. Parrots predominantly emitted call categories in some contexts: distress, protestation, alarm, asking (i. e. emitted when a bird wanted something from an experimenter and contact calls. These results suggest that some calls are learned {{and can be used}} in specific contexts. Peer reviewe...|$|R

5|$|In 1973, {{based on}} remains {{collected}} by Louis Etienne Thirioux {{in the early}} 20th century, the English ornithologist Daniel T. Holyoak placed a small subfossil Mauritian parrot in the same genus as the broad-billed parrot and named it Lophopsittacus bensoni. In 2007, {{on the basis of}} a comparison of subfossils, correlated with 17th and 18th century descriptions of small grey parrots, Hume reclassified it as a species in the genus Psittacula and called it Thirioux's <b>grey</b> <b>parrot.</b> In 1967, James Greenway had speculated that reports of grey Mauritian parrots referred to the broad-billed parrot.|$|E

50|$|Another {{series of}} {{experiments}} further tested grey parrots' cognitive abilities. In general, most animals cannot associate sounds with objects, such as food, placed into a cup. While originally only the great apes and young human children were known to make this association with ease, {{it was found that}} <b>grey</b> <b>parrots,</b> under most conditions, can also associate sounds with the presence of an object. For the most part, <b>grey</b> <b>parrots</b> performed more successfully if the cup was shaken horizontally before it is given the choice of selecting which contained food, however, further experimentation indicated {{that it is not a}} requirement and proved that <b>grey</b> <b>parrots</b> have very high cognitive abilities.|$|R

50|$|In an {{experiment}} {{to test the}} vocalizations of <b>grey</b> <b>parrots,</b> four bred in captivity were placed in an aviary. Throughout the day they spent time {{in a room with}} toys and came into fairly regular contact with the humans taking care of them. The noises that these parrots could hear consisted of the calls of canaries in the laboratory, people cleaning, doors squeaking, etc. In the next 3 years, the parrots made over 50,000 vocalisations. What was interesting was that, although they were bred in captivity, the sounds they made were not only ones of their immediate surroundings. They also made calls similar to those of other captive <b>grey</b> <b>parrots</b> in different locations and even wild <b>grey</b> <b>parrots.</b>|$|R

25|$|Studies with captive {{birds have}} given insight into which birds {{are the most}} intelligent. While parrots have the {{distinction}} of being able to mimic human speech, studies with the African <b>grey</b> <b>parrot</b> have shown that some are able to associate words with their meanings and form simple sentences (see Alex). Parrots and the corvid family of crows, ravens, and jays are considered the most intelligent of birds. Not surprisingly, research has shown that these species tend to have the largest HVCs. Dr. Harvey J. Karten, a neuroscientist at UCSD who has studied the physiology of birds, has discovered that the lower parts of avian brains {{are similar to those of}} humans.|$|E
25|$|Studies with captive {{birds have}} given insight into which birds {{are the most}} intelligent. While parrots are able to mimic human speech, studies with the African <b>grey</b> <b>parrot</b> have shown that some are able to {{associate}} words with their meanings and form simple sentences. Along with crows, ravens, and jays (family Corvidae), parrots are considered the most intelligent of birds. The brain-to body size ratio of psittacines and corvines is {{comparable to that of}} higher primates. One argument against the supposed intelligent capabilities of bird species is that birds have a relatively small cerebral cortex, which is {{the part of the brain}} considered the main area of intelligence in other animals. However, birds use a different part of the brain, the mediorostral HVC as the seat of their intelligence. These species tend to have the largest hyperstriata, and Harvey J. Karten, a neuroscientist at the University of California, San Diego, who studied bird physiology, has discovered that the lower part of the avian brain is functionally similar to that in humans. Not only have parrots demonstrated intelligence through scientific testing of their language-using ability, but also some species of parrots such as the kea are also highly skilled at using tools and solving puzzles.|$|E
25|$|Parrots may {{not make}} good pets for most people because of their natural wild {{instincts}} such as screaming and chewing. Although parrots can be very affectionate and cute when immature, they often become aggressive when mature (partly due to mishandling and poor training) and may bite, causing serious injury. For this reason, parrot rescue groups estimate that most parrots are surrendered and rehomed through at least five homes before reaching their permanent destinations or before dying prematurely from unintentional or intentional neglect and abuse. The parrots' ability to mimic human words and their bright colours and beauty prompt impulse buying from unsuspecting consumers. The domesticated budgerigar, a small parrot, {{is the most popular}} of all pet bird species. In 1992, the newspaper USA Today published that 11 million pet birds were in the United States alone, many of them parrots. Europeans kept birds matching the description of the rose-ringed parakeet (or called the ring-necked parrot), documented particularly in a first-century account by Pliny the Elder. As they have been prized for thousands of years for their beauty and ability to talk, they have also often been misunderstood. For example, author Wolfgang de Grahl says in his 1987 book The <b>Grey</b> <b>Parrot</b> that some importers had parrots drink only coffee while they were shipped by boat, believing that pure water was detrimental and that their actions would increase survival rates during shipping. Nowadays, it is commonly accepted that the caffeine in coffee is toxic to birds.|$|E

25|$|Dja Faunal Reserve was {{established}} as a faunal reserve in 1950. It was designated by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site in 1987 under Natural Criteria ix and x, {{on account of the}} diversity of species present in the reserve. The Dja River surrounds the reserve on most of its border, except in the northeast. In 1981 it was designated a biosphere reserve under the UNESCO Man & Biosphere Programme covering an area of 526,000 ha. It has a topography with elevation varying between 400 m and 800 m with climate of equatorial type and with average annual precipitation of about 1,570mm. It has dense rain forests and is integral part of the Congo Basin. It is reported as the largest and best-protected of rainforests in Africa with 90 percent preserved in pristine condition mostly due to its difficult accessibility. There are more than 1,500 known plant (canopy of 30-40m rising to 60m) species in the reserve, over 107 mammals including five threatened species and more than 320 bird species in the reserve. The forest canopy consists of 43 tree species. It is well known for its biodiversity and a wide variety of primates such as western lowland gorilla Gorilla gorilla (CR) and western chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) with total reported species of more than 4000. As an Important Bird Area recognised by the BirdLife International, the 1993 inventory records avifauna of 349 resident species and also more than 80 species of regular migrants.
