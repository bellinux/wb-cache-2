40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to obtain {{information}} that could help farmers increase the profitability of their operations and improve the likelihood that they would continue farming. The specific objective was to empirically evaluate which socio-demographic characteristics and purchasing behaviors encourage consumers to patronize farmers? markets, in general and public markets, in particular. Data was drawn from telephone survey responses from 502 potential food shoppers in Alabama. Logit model results point to several factors that seem to be strongly correlated with consumer purchasing behaviors and attitudes toward shopping at public markets, including income, education, age of household head, household size, price and quality of produce. 3 Introduction In the past, farmers? markets were the usual way of buying and selling rural produce (Brown, 2002). With the advent of supermarkets, farmers? markets all but disappeared in many countries. However, in countries such as France and Italy, which place a high priority on food provenance and regional specialization, farmers? markets continued without a break, partly due to the presence of mechanisms in these countries to identify and promote locally grown foods (Erlich, Ruth, and Wahlqvist, 2005). In the U. <b>S,</b> <b>farmers?</b> <b>markets</b> first started to reappear in the 1970 s from where they have spread to other nations such a...|$|R

This study will describe some changes that the mobile phones has produced in Upper East Region, Ghana. It will show that rural farmers have found the mobile phone helpful in various ways. To {{be able to call}} to the markets to access price information, organization of transport and discussion on agricultural diseases with pesticide dealers are some of the findings that will be presented in this text. The data has been collected through a two-and-a-half-month fieldwork in the Kassena-Nankana Districts during the dry season 2016 - 17. I conducted a pilot survey to get a varied sample for the semi -structured interviews, and I had group discussions where I collected data to supplement the interviews. Theories about General Purpose Technologies, innovation, agricultural innovation systems and institutions will be addressed. Through these theories I will try to present the mobile phone as a technology that can facilitate change on a scale that is almost unprecedented in the study area. The mobile phone has connected people that were previously disconnected, and the communication possibilities it offers may have wide ranging effects on how the <b>farmer</b> <b>s</b> conduct their <b>market</b> transactions as well as their production methods. This paper will indicate that the market places are losing its central importance as a geographical area. It will show that a mobile phone handset has different functions that some farmers utilize to enhance local knowledge. Mobile Money Transfer (MMT) is a mobile phone banking service that is accessible to many more people than the commercial banks. Some of the changes can be regarded as innovations, and it is clear that some farmers benefit in many ways from the mobile phones different functions...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the extent to}} which financial returns on market indices exhibit mean and volatility asymmetries, as a response to past information from both the U. <b>S.</b> <b>market</b> and the local market itself. In particular, we wish to assess the asymmetric effect of a combination of local and U. <b>S.</b> <b>market</b> news on volatility. To the best of the authors knowledge, this joint effect has not been considered previously. We propose a double threshold non-linear heteroscedastic model, combined with a GJR-GARCH effect in the conditional volatility equation, to capture jointly both mean and volatility asymmetric behaviours and the interactive effect of U. <b>S.</b> and local <b>market</b> news. In an application to five major international market indices, clear evidence of threshold non-linearity is discovered, supporting the hypothesis of an uneven mean-reverting pattern and volatility asymmetry, both in reaction to U. <b>S.</b> <b>market</b> news and news from the local market itself. Significant, but somewhat different, interactive effects between local and U. S. news are observed in all markets. An asymmetric pattern in the exogenous relationship between the local market and the U. <b>S.</b> <b>market</b> is also found. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R
