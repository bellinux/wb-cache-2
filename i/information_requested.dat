25|$|Following the {{admission}} of Portugal to the United Nations in December 1955, the Secretary-General officially asked the Portuguese Government if the country had non-self-governing territories under its administration.

25|$|In early 2005, Farage {{requested}} that the European Commission disclose where the individual Commissioners had spent their holidays. The Commission did not provide the <b>information</b> <b>requested,</b> {{on the basis that}} the Commissioners had a right of privacy. The German newspaper Die Welt reported that the President of the European Commission, José Manuel Barroso, had spent a week on the yacht of the Greek shipping billionaire Spiros Latsis. It emerged soon afterwards that this had occurred a month before the Commission under Barroso's predecessor Romano Prodi approved 10.3 million euros of Greek state aid for Latsis's shipping company. It also became known that Peter Mandelson, then the British EU Commissioner, had accepted a trip to Jamaica from an unrevealed source.|$|E
25|$|From {{its early}} years, {{when it was}} contending that the Nairs needed to join {{together}} {{if they were to}} become a political force, it argued that the caste members should cease referring to their traditional subdivisions and instead see themselves as a whole. Census information thereafter appears to have become unreliable on the matter of the subdivisions, in part at least because of the NSS campaign to ensure that respondents did not provide the <b>information</b> <b>requested</b> of them. The NSS also promoted marriage across the various divisions in a further attempt to promote caste cohesion, although in this instance it met with only limited success. Indeed, even in the 1970s it was likely that cross-subdivision marriage was rare generally, and this was certainly the case in the Central Travancore area.|$|E

25|$|The Working Group {{divided the}} Evaluation Report on eleven {{detailed}} themes and weightings: Government support, legal issues {{and public opinion}} (2); General infrastructure (5); Sports venues (4); Olympic Village(s) (3); Environmental conditions and impact (2); Accommodation (5); Transport concept (3); Safety and security (3); Experience from past sports events (2); Finance (3); and, Overall project and legacy (3). Weightings, varying between 1 and 5 (5 being the highest), were attributed by the Working Group to each criterion, reflecting the level of <b>information</b> <b>requested</b> of the Applicant Cities {{at this stage of}} the bid process, and the potential of achieving the level required for the organisation of the Olympic Games in the seven years' preparation time. The Working Group set the benchmark at 6 as minimum required grade (on a scale of 0 to 10). This grade was attributed by the Working Group to the main and sub-criteria for each Applicant City, reflecting the assessment of the Working Group (quality, number, location, concept, etc.).|$|E
25|$|From the <b>information</b> <b>requested</b> by his predecessor, {{and of all}} the {{scenarios}} that were examined by the Minister, he agreed in August 1968 to the closure of the Lewes to Uckfield section of line. But the resultant row over the severing of what was a very important rail link began. Considerable opposition from the users centred, in the first instance, around the inadequate replacement bus service – which had Ministerial approval. The issue was resolved by the Transport Commissioners who, on examination of all the complaints from the users and undertaking the journey themselves, upheld the users' complaints. However concerns over the state of the bridge over Cliffe High Street remained and finally the BR Chief Civil Engineer declared the bridge unsafe. This meant the cessation of rail services along this section of line, with a replacement bus service in place. All of these actions resulted in the delaying of the closure from January 1969 to May 1969.|$|E
25|$|The Chamber {{relied on}} the Krstić trial {{judgment}} for the historical context and underlying facts, although it only utilized those factual portions of the Krstić judgment which {{were not included in}} the appeal that was underway at the time of the Chamber's decision. In its decision the Chamber concluded that Republika Srpska's failure to make accessible and to disclose <b>information</b> <b>requested</b> by the applicants about their missing relatives constituted a violation of its positive obligations to secure respect for their rights to private and family life, as guaranteed by Article 8 of the European Convention. Also, it held that Republika Srpska's failure to inform the applicants about the truth of the fate and whereabouts of their missing relatives, including conducting a meaningful and effective investigation into the massacre at Srebrenica in July 1995, violated their rights to be free from inhuman and degrading treatment, as guaranteed by Article 3 of the European Convention. Finally, the Chamber concluded that in failing to fulfill its obligations owed to the applicants under the European Convention, the Republika Srpska had discriminated against the applicants due to their Bosniak origin.|$|E

2500|$|Complaints were lodged against former Israeli Defense Forces {{chief of}} General Staff Lt.-Gen. (res.) Dan Halutz {{and six other}} senior Israeli {{political}} and military officials by pro-Palestinian organizations, who sought to prosecute them in Spain under the principle of universal jurisdiction. On 29 January 2009, Fernando Andreu, a judge of the Audiencia Nacional, opened preliminary investigations into claims that a targeted killing attack in Gaza in 2002 warranted the prosecution of Halutz, the former Israeli defence minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer, the former defence chief-of-staff Moshe Ya'alon, and four others, for crimes against humanity. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu strongly criticized the decision, and Israeli officials refused to provide <b>information</b> <b>requested</b> by the Spanish court. The attack killed the founder {{and leader of the}} military wing of the Islamic militant organisation Hamas, Salah Shehade, who Israel said was responsible for hundreds of civilian deaths. The attack also killed 14 others (including his wife and 9 children). It had targeted the building where Shahade hid in Gaza City. It also wounded some 150 Palestinians, according to the complaint (or 50, according to other reports). [...] The Israeli chief of operations and prime minister apologized officially, saying they were unaware, due to faulty intelligence, that civilians were in the house. The investigation in the case was halted on 30 June 2009 by a decision of a panel of 18 judges of the Audiencia Nacional. The Spanish Court of Appeals rejected the lower court's decision, and on appeal in April 2010 the Supreme Court of Spain upheld the Court of Appeals decision against conducting an official inquiry into the IDF's targeted killing of Shehadeh.|$|E
