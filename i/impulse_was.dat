5|$|Science Fantasy, {{which also}} {{appeared}} under the titles Impulse and SF <b>Impulse,</b> <b>was</b> a British fantasy and science fiction magazine, launched in 1950 by Nova Publications as {{a companion to}} Nova's New Worlds. Walter Gillings was editor {{for the first two}} issues, and was then replaced by John Carnell, the editor of New Worlds, as a cost-saving measure. Carnell edited both magazines until Nova went out of business in early 1964. The titles were acquired by Roberts & Vinter, who hired Kyril Bonfiglioli to edit Science Fantasy; Bonfiglioli changed the title to Impulse in early 1966, but the new title led to confusion with the distributors and sales fell, though the magazine remained profitable. The title was changed again to SF Impulse for the last few issues. Science Fantasy ceased publication the following year, when Roberts & Vinter came under financial pressure after their printer went bankrupt.|$|E

An advantage to Coltrane recording with <b>Impulse!</b> <b>was</b> that it would enable him to work again with engineer Rudy Van Gelder, who had taped both his and Davis' Prestige sessions, as well as Blue Train. It was at Van Gelder's new studio in Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey that Coltrane would record most of his records for the label.|$|E

25|$|Stroman's late husband, Mike Ockrent, {{had asked}} his {{employees}} to recommend material to be adapted into musicals during his two year production deal at Warner Bros. His assistant recommended the Zola novel, and began developing {{the idea in}} detail with the production executive. Later, when Warner Bros. passed on this, the idea and notes that were developed by Ockren't staff members were give to Stroman. Her original <b>impulse</b> <b>was</b> {{to make it into}} a ballet, but decided against it, and felt it could be strong enough as a musical. The idea for the musical Contact had also originally been developed at Ockrent's Warner Bros. office by the same two staff members, and then also offered over to Stroman by Ockrent when it didn't fly with the film studio.|$|E
25|$|In 2002, the RS-68 {{became the}} first large liquid-propellant rocket engine {{designed}} in the U.S. since the Space Shuttle main engine (SSME) in the 1970s. The primary goal for the RS-68 was to reduce cost versus the SSME. Some sacrifice in chamber pressure and specific <b>impulse</b> <b>was</b> made, hurting efficiency; however, development time, part count, total cost, and assembly labor were reduced to {{a fraction of the}} SSME, despite the RS-68's significantly larger size. Typically, the RS-68 runs at 102% rated thrust for the first few minutes of flight, and then throttles down to 58% rated thrust before main engine cutoff. On the Heavy variant, the main CBC's engine throttles down to 58% rated thrust around 50 seconds after liftoff, while the strap-on CBCs remain at 102%. This allows the main CBC to conserve propellant and burn after booster separation. After the strap-on CBCs separate, the main CBC's engine throttles back up to 102% before throttling back down to 58% prior to main engine cutoff.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{stability}} of stochastic delay differential systems with two kinds of <b>impulses,</b> that <b>is,</b> destabilizing <b>impulses</b> and stabilizing impulses. Both the pth moment and almost sure exponential stability criteria are established by using the average impulsive interval. When the <b>impulses</b> <b>are</b> regarded as disturbances, a lower bound of average impulsive interval is obtained; {{it means that the}} impulses should not happen too frequently. On the other hand, when the <b>impulses</b> <b>are</b> used to stabilize the system, an upper bound of average impulsive interval is derived; namely, enough <b>impulses</b> <b>are</b> needed to stabilize the system. The effectiveness of the proposed results is illustrated by two examples...|$|R

25|$|The Geo Storm was a rebadged {{version of}} the sporty, second {{generation}} Isuzu Impulse minus some of that car's more expensive features. The Storm was sold in Japan as the PA Nero and related Gemini Coupe, Impulse. The Storm lacked the Impulse's Lotus-tuned suspension {{as well as the}} Impulse's optional turbocharger and all-wheel drive drivetrain. Although they were essentially the same car, sales of the Storm were much stronger than those of the Impulse—indeed, the Storm sold better than most small GM cars of that era. Slow sales of the Isuzu version doomed the Storm when the Isuzu <b>Impulse</b> <b>was</b> canceled, the Geo Storm derivative had nothing to be built from, meaning both cars were discontinued in 1993. the Storm was replaced by the Geo Prizm for Standard hatchback in the same year as Storm discontinued and The wagonback Model was replaced by Pontiac Vibe in 2002 the Prizm and Vibe was built at the NUMMI plant. For The GSi hatchback Model was replaced by GM Delta platform based Chevrolet Cobalt SS in 2004 The Cobalt SS was built at the Lordstown Assembly in Lordstown, Ohio. As of 2010, there were only 40,300 Storms registered for road use.|$|E

His music for Creatures of <b>Impulse</b> <b>was</b> criticised as [...] "extremely undramatic", though others found it [...] "pretty". Much of it was cut from revivals of the piece.|$|E
500|$|Shortly before {{completing}} {{his contract with}} Atlantic in May 1961, John Coltrane joined the newly formed Impulse! label, with whom the [...] "Classic Quartet" [...] would record.

500|$|By late 1966 Bonfiglioli {{had made}} enough {{money from his}} {{antiques}} dealing {{to be able to}} retire to Jersey. J.G. Ballard was briefly involved with the magazine in an editorial role, but his aims for the magazine were too far from the publisher's goals and he was quickly replaced by Harry Harrison. Harrison almost immediately had to leave England and handed over much of the day-to-day management of the magazine to Keith Roberts. Despite the setback from Bonfiglioli's title change, the magazine was still profitable, but in July 1966 Roberts & Vinter's distributor, Thorpe & Porter, went bankrupt while owing Roberts & Vinter a substantial sum. The resulting financial pressure led Roberts & Vinter to decide to focus on their more profitable magazines, and the February 1967 issue of SF <b>Impulse</b> <b>was</b> the last, though New Worlds, the sister magazine, survived via an Arts Council grant obtained by Brian Aldiss's efforts. [...] The title was merged with New Worlds with effect from the March 1967 issue, though nothing of SF Impulses content was retained.|$|E
500|$|Cardcaptor Sakura {{was first}} {{conceived}} {{shortly before the}} conclusion of Clamp's Magic Knight Rayearth, which was serialized in Nakayoshi. Clamp's head editor Yamonouchi asked them to do another series in Nakayoshi, and Clamp {{decided to make a}} [...] "Nakayoshi-esque" [...] series, as opposed to Rayearth, which Clamp described as unlike anything they had done before. Head Clamp writer Nanase Ohkawa's first <b>impulse</b> <b>was</b> to create a magical girl series, despite not being well-versed in the genre. Ohkawa wanted the heroine Sakura {{to be in the same}} age group as the majority of Nakayoshis readers so that fans could relate to her. Due to it being different from how Clamp normally conceived characters, Ohkawa designed the other characters such as Tomoyo and Cerberus to be more like Clamp's previous creations. Once Ohkawa had enough information on the characters, she had the three artists in Clamp—Mokona, Tsubaki Nekoi and Satsuki Igarashi—design them based on her descriptions. When designing Cerberus, Ohkawa wanted a mascot-type companion for Sakura, but Nekoi tried various forms, including dogs and squirrels, before designing the final version. Syaoran and Toya were conceived to be a common type of character featured in Clamp's works.|$|E
500|$|Shearer {{said in an}} {{interview}} that [...] "The animating <b>impulse</b> <b>was</b> to do rock 'n' roll right. The four of us had been around rock 'n' roll and we were just amazed by how relentlessly the movies got it wrong. Because we were funny people it was going to be a funny film, but we wanted to get it right." [...] When they tried to sell it to various Hollywood studios, they were told that the film would not work. The group kept saying, [...] "No, this is a story that's pretty familiar to people. We're not introducing them to anything they don't really know," [...] so Shearer thought it would at least have some resonance with the public. The film was only a modest success upon its initial release but found greater success, and a cult following, after its video release. In 2000, the film was ranked 29th on the American Film Institute's list of the top 100 comedy movies in American cinema and it was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being [...] "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".|$|E

500|$|In July 1966 Roberts & Vinter's distributor, Thorpe & Porter, went bankrupt, owing Roberts & Vinter a {{substantial}} sum. The resulting financial pressure led Roberts & Vinter {{to focus on}} their more profitable magazines, and they made plans to close down both Science Fantasy and New Worlds. [...] After hearing of these plans, Moorcock and Warburton began to consider forming a separate company to continue publishing New Worlds, and Brian Aldiss contacted well-known literary figures such as J.B. Priestley, Kingsley Amis, Marghanita Laski, and Angus Wilson to gain support for an application for {{a grant from the}} British Arts Council in late 1966. [...] In early January 1967 Aldiss discovered that the grant application would be successful, and that New Worlds would be awarded £150 per issue, though in the event the formal grant certification was delayed until at least May. [...] The grant was enough to enable the magazine to continue, though it would not cover all costs. [...] A publisher still needed to be found, and both Fontana and Panther Books expressed an interest, but the promise of the money and the prestige of an Arts Council grant convinced Warburton to stay involved personally. [...] While these negotiations were going on, two more issues were assembled from backfile material and donated stories. [...] Roberts & Vinter had ceased to exist by this time, so a sister company, Gold Star Publications, became the publisher for both these issues, with Warburton and Aldiss providing Gold Star with personal financial guarantees. [...] These two issues appeared in March and April 1967, but the latter was mistakenly also dated March in the indicia. [...] Science Fantasy, which by this time had been retitled SF <b>Impulse,</b> <b>was</b> not continued but was merged with New Worlds as of the first Gold Star issue, though nothing of SF Impulses design or content was visible in New Worlds.|$|E

But Jean Metzinger, who had been termed [...] "the Emperor of Cubism" [...] during the spring in Paris, was not among the artist exhibiting works in Brussels. Apollinaire’s <b>impulse</b> <b>was</b> to define L'Esprit nouveau observed in a range of paintings, from proto-Cubist quasi-Fauve landscapes to the semi-abstract geometric compositions of artists such as Metzinger, Delaunay, Gleizes and a growing group of followers.

Thus the force on the rod was exerted by tension rather than compression, (or in less technical language, the trigger motor worked by being [...] "pulled" [...] rather than [...] "pushed") which enabled the rod to be lighter, minimising its inertia so that it could operate faster (at least in early versions of the gear, each revolution of the cam wheel produced two firing impulses instead of one). A single firing lever engaged the gear and fired the gun in one action, rather than the gear having to be [...] "turned on" [...] and then fired, as with some earlier gears.|$|E

2500|$|In {{practice}} {{it was found}} that it was necessary for the gun to be fired in semi-automatic mode.

The majority of these firing impulses would catch the gun in the course of its firing cycle, that is when it was [...] "busy" [...] ejecting a spent round or loading a fresh one, and would be [...] "wasted"; but eventually the firing cycle was completed, and the gun was ready to fire. It then had to [...] "wait" [...] for the next impulse from the gear, and on receiving this it fired. This delay between being ready to fire and actually firing inevitably slowed the rate of fire in comparison with a free-firing machine gun, which fires the moment it is ready to do so; but provided the gear functioned correctly the gun could fire fairly rapidly through the whirling propeller blades without striking them.|$|E
