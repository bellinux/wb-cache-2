5|$|Boranes are {{chemical}} compounds of boron and hydrogen, with the generic formula of BxHy. These compounds {{do not occur}} in nature. Many of the boranes readily oxidise on contact with air, some violently. The parent member BH3 is called borane, but it is known only in the <b>gaseous</b> <b>state,</b> and dimerises to form diborane, B2H6. The larger boranes all consist of boron clusters that are polyhedral, some of which exist as isomers. For example, isomers of B20H26 {{are based on the}} fusion of two 10-atom clusters.|$|E

5|$|The element hydrogen, {{with one}} {{electron}} per neutral atom, is usually {{placed at the}} top of Group 1 of the periodic table for convenience, but hydrogen is not normally considered to be an alkali metal; when it is considered to be an alkali metal, it is because of its atomic properties and not its chemical properties. Under typical conditions, pure hydrogen exists as a diatomic gas consisting of two atoms per molecule (H2); however, the alkali metals only form diatomic molecules (such as dilithium, Li2) at high temperatures, when they are in the <b>gaseous</b> <b>state.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{lack of a}} {{magnetosphere}} and {{the extremely}} thin atmosphere of Mars are a challenge: the planet has little heat transfer across its surface, poor insulation against bombardment of the solar wind and insufficient atmospheric pressure to retain water in a liquid form (water instead sublimes to a <b>gaseous</b> <b>state).</b> Mars is nearly, or perhaps totally, geologically dead; the end of volcanic activity has apparently stopped the recycling of chemicals and minerals between the surface and interior of the planet.|$|E
5|$|Water is a {{chemical}} substance that {{is composed of}} hydrogen and oxygen and is vital for all known forms of life. In typical usage, water refers only to its liquid form or state, but the substance also has a solid state, ice, and a <b>gaseous</b> <b>state,</b> water vapor, or steam. Water covers 71% of the Earth's surface. On Earth, it is found mostly in oceans and other large water bodies, with 1.6% of water below ground in aquifers and 0.001% {{in the air as}} vapor, clouds, and precipitation. Oceans hold 97% of surface water, glaciers, and polar ice caps 2.4%, and other land surface water such as rivers, lakes, and ponds 0.6%.

25|$|A {{condenser}} is a {{piece of}} apparatus or equipment {{that can be used to}} condense, that is, to change the physical state of a substance from its gaseous to its liquid state; in the laboratory, it is generally used in procedures done with organic liquids brought into <b>gaseous</b> <b>state</b> through heating or application of vacuum (lowered pressure), though processes often involve at least trace amounts of the common inorganic component water, and can involve other inorganic substances as well. Condensers can be applied at various scales, from micro-scale (very few microliters) to process-scale (many liters), using laboratory glassware and occasionally metalware that accomplishes the cooling of the vapor generated by boiling (through heating or application of vacuum).|$|E
25|$|The working fluid, in its <b>gaseous</b> <b>state,</b> is {{pressurized}} and circulated {{through the}} system by a compressor. On the discharge side of the compressor, the now hot and highly pressurized vapor is cooled in a heat exchanger, called a condenser, until it condenses into a high pressure, moderate temperature liquid. The condensed refrigerant then passes through a pressure-lowering device also called a metering device. This may be an expansion valve, capillary tube, or possibly a work-extracting device such as a turbine. The low-pressure liquid refrigerant then enters another heat exchanger, the evaporator, in which the fluid absorbs heat and boils. The refrigerant then returns to the compressor and the cycle is repeated.|$|E
25|$|Liquid {{particles}} are bound firmly but not rigidly. They {{are able to}} move around one another freely, resulting in a limited degree of particle mobility. As the temperature increases, the increased vibrations of the molecules causes distances between the molecules to increase. When a liquid reaches its boiling point, the cohesive forces that bind the molecules closely together break, and the liquid changes to its <b>gaseous</b> <b>state</b> (unless superheating occurs). If the temperature is decreased, the distances between the molecules become smaller. When the liquid reaches its freezing point the molecules will usually lock into a very specific order, called crystallizing, and the bonds between them become more rigid, changing the liquid into its solid state (unless supercooling occurs).|$|E

The {{two forms of}} gas coexisted at a sufficiently high supersaturation of gas where {{one or more of}} the nanobubbles may sit on top of a micropancake.

We analyzed these results assuming temporal and local quasi-equilibrium conditions...|$|R
25|$|The alkanes from pentane (C5H12) to octane (C8H18) are refined into gasoline, {{the ones}} from nonane (C9H20) to {{hexadecane}} (C16H34) into diesel fuel, kerosene and jet fuel. Alkanes {{with more than}} 16 carbon atoms can be refined into fuel oil and lubricating oil. At the heavier end of the range, paraffin wax is an alkane with approximately 25 carbon atoms, while asphalt has 35 and up, although these are usually cracked by modern refineries into more valuable products. The shortest molecules, those with four or fewer carbon atoms, are in a <b>gaseous</b> <b>state</b> at room temperature. They are the petroleum gases. Depending on demand {{and the cost of}} recovery, these gases are either flared off, sold as liquefied petroleum gas under pressure, or used to power the refinery's own burners. During the winter, butane (C4H10), is blended into the gasoline pool at high rates, because its high vapor pressure assists with cold starts. Liquified under pressure slightly above atmospheric, it is best known for powering cigarette lighters, {{but it is also a}} main fuel source for many developing countries. Propane can be liquified under modest pressure, and is consumed for just about every application relying on petroleum for energy, from cooking to heating to transportation.|$|E

40|$|The {{apparent}} evaporation coefficient (α) {{of water}} has no unique value but {{depends on the}} conditions of observation, and must, therefore, be determined for each experimental situation. According to the accessible area theory of monolayer permeation, α {{is related to the}} resistance of a monolayer to the evaporation of the water on which it is spread. It is thus possible to use measured evaporation resistances to estimate the value of α appropriate to these experiments. α is found to be 2 × 10 - 4 both for a monolayer-free surface and for a surface covered by an octadecanol monolayer in the transition region between the condensed and <b>gaseous</b> <b>states...</b>|$|R

50|$|Geologically speaking, Colombian {{emeralds}} {{are said}} to be the purest emeralds in the world because Colombian emerald deposits are the only ones on earth found in sedimentary host rock rather than in Igneous rock. The tectonic movements that created the Andes Mountains force the raw materials of emeralds—beryllium, chromium, and vanadium—found in the ground into liquid and <b>gaseous</b> <b>states.</b> These materials, in such states, find their way into cracks in the already sedimentary medium surrounding them and then eventually cool and crystallize. A saline solution found in the sedimentary rock eventually washes out impurities such as iron that cloud other beryls from forming onto the crystallizing stone. This intricate process produces the emeralds found in the mines of Colombia.|$|R
