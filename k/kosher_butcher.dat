5|$|B'nai Israel was {{the only}} Jewish {{congregation}} in Memphis, and from {{the time it was}} established members were split between traditionalists and reformers. When remodeling their new building, the congregation voted eighteen to fourteen to maintain traditional separate seating for men and women. By 1858, with enough funds to hire a full-time spiritual leader, they consulted Rabbi Isaac Leeser, the leader of America's Orthodox Jewish community, but were also in contact with Rabbi Isaac Mayer Wise, the leader of America's fledgling Reform movement, who had dedicated B'nai Israel's sanctuary earlier that year. The members had advertised for their first spiritual leader in Wise's newspaper, The Israelite (along with other English-language Jewish newspapers) {{at the same time they}} advertised for a <b>kosher</b> <b>butcher.</b> Leeser recommended Jacob J. Peres, an Orthodox rabbi.|$|E

50|$|At {{the end of}} {{the nineteenth}} century, <b>kosher</b> <b>butchering</b> and {{vivisection}} (animal experimentation) were the main concerns of the German animal welfare movement. The Nazis adopted these concerns as part of their political platform. According to Boria Sax, the Nazis rejected anthropocentric reasons for animal protection—animals were to be protected for their own sake. In 1927, a Nazi representative to the Reichstag called for actions against cruelty to animals and <b>kosher</b> <b>butchering.</b>|$|R

25|$|In rabbinical {{interpretation}} {{a continuing}} {{application of the}} commandment is identified. Rabbi Yosef Karo Shulchan Aruch Yoreh Deah 61:1, rules that after the slaughter of animal by a shochet (<b>kosher</b> <b>butcher),</b> the cuts of the foreleg, cheek and maw {{should be given to}} a kohen freely, without the kohen paying or performing any service. This giving is required to be free of both monetary and servicial compensation (B.Bechorot 27a).|$|E

50|$|Despite Napoleonic {{emancipation}} in 1793, Jews remained {{barred from}} {{entry into the}} guilds in the Netherlands and were not permitted to be shopkeepers (with few exceptions, e.g. <b>kosher</b> <b>butchers)</b> for fear of the competition they would present to other Dutch.

25|$|In a {{paradoxical}} turn of events, the United States government recognized cantors {{as the first}} Jewish clergy, even before rabbis were recognized: as a congregation could be organized and led by a committee of Jewish laypersons, who {{would not have the}} expertise in liturgy a hazzan would have, newly forming congregations in the late 19th and early 20th centuries sometimes hired a hazzan for a synagogue (and made sure that a <b>kosher</b> <b>butcher</b> was established in the neighborhood) for some time before setting about hiring a rabbi, seeing the hazzan (and the butcher) as a more immediate need. The hazzan therefore solemnized marriages and otherwise represented the congregation in the eyes of civil authorities.|$|E

2500|$|In December 2008, Moshe Ya'ish al-Nahari, a 30-year-old Hebrew {{teacher and}} <b>kosher</b> <b>butcher</b> from Raydah, {{was shot and}} killed by Abed el-Aziz el-Abadi, a former MiG-29 pilot in the Yemeni Air Force. Abadi confronted Nahari in the Raydah market, and shouted out, [...] "Jew, accept the message of Islam", and opened fire with an AK-47. Nahari was shot five times, and died. During interrogation, Abadi proudly confessed his crime, and stated that, [...] "these Jews must convert to Islam". Abadi had murdered his wife two years before, but had avoided prison by paying her family compensation. The court found Abadi mentally unstable, and ordered him to pay only a fine, but an appeals court sentenced him to death. Following al-Nahari's murder, the Jewish {{community}} expressed its feelings of insecurity, claiming to have received hate mail and threats by phone from Islamic extremists. Dozens of Jews reported receiving death threats, and said that they had been subjected to violent harassment. Nahari's killing and continual anti-Semitic harassment prompted approximately 20 other Jewish residents of Raydah to emigrate to Israel. In 2009, five of Nahari's children moved to Israel, and in 2012, his wife and four other children followed, having initially stayed in Yemen so she could serve as a witness in Abadi's trial.|$|E
2500|$|In 1985, the BBC {{produced}} {{a version of}} the play for their BBC Television Shakespeare series. Directed by Jane Howell, the play was the thirty-seventh and final episode of the series and starred Trevor Peacock as Titus, Eileen Atkins as Tamora, Hugh Quarshie as Aaron and Anna Calder-Marshall as Lavinia. Because Titus was broadcast several months after the rest of the seventh season, it was rumoured that the BBC were worried about the violence in the play and that disagreements had arisen about censorship. This was inaccurate however, with the delay caused by a BBC strike in 1984. The episode had been booked into the studio in February and March 1984, but the strike meant it couldn't shoot. When the strike ended, the studio couldn't be used as it was being used by another production, and then when the studio became available, the RSC was using Trevor Peacock, and filming didn't take place until February 1985, a year later than planned. Initially, director Jane Howell wanted to set the play in present-day Northern Ireland, but she ultimately settled on a more conventional approach. All the body parts seen throughout were based upon real autopsy photographs, and were authenticated by the Royal College of Surgeons. The costumes of the Goths were based on punk outfits, with Chiron and Demetrius specifically based on the band KISS. For the scene when Chiron and Demetrius are killed, a large carcass is seen hanging nearby; this was a genuine lamb carcass purchased from a <b>kosher</b> <b>butcher</b> and smeared with Vaseline to make it gleam under the studio lighting. In an unusual design choice, Howell had the Roman populace all wear identical generic masks without mouths, so as to convey the idea that the Roman people were faceless and voiceless, as she felt the play depicted a society which [...] "seemed like a society where everyone was faceless except for those in power." [...] The production {{was one of the most}} lauded plays of the series and garnered almost universally positive reviews.|$|E

5000|$|Due to the boycott's {{successful}} tactics, on May 22, the Retail <b>Butchers</b> Association (the <b>kosher</b> <b>butchers</b> association) realigned {{itself with}} the boycott campaign and ceased selling kosher meat in all their stores. In addition, kosher restaurants throughout NYC removed meat from their menus until the prices came back down. By May 27, major Orthodox religious leaders had publicly affirmed support for the boycott, and by June 9 the prices dropped to 14 cents a pound.|$|R
50|$|The 1902 kosher meat boycott was {{a boycott}} of New York City <b>kosher</b> <b>butchers</b> in {{response}} to a coordinated increase in price of kosher meat from 12 to 18 cents a pound.

The protests, led mainly by women on Manhattan’s Lower East Side, though controversial in their often-violent tactics, were largely successful and resulted in the lowering of the price of meat down to 14 cents a pound.|$|R

50|$|In Yiddish, gizzards are {{referred}} to as pipik'lach, literally meaning navels. The gizzards of kosher species of birds have a green or yellowish membrane lining the inside, which must be peeled off before cooking, as it lends a very bitter taste to the food. In traditional Eastern European Jewish cuisine, the gizzards, necks, and feet of chickens were often cooked together, although not the liver, which per Kosher law must be broiled. <b>Kosher</b> <b>butchers</b> often sell roasting chickens with the gizzard, neck, and feet butchered and left in the cavity to be used for making chicken soup.|$|R
