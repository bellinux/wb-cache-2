40|$|In {{the present}} paper, a hybrid {{technique}} involving {{artificial neural network}} (ANN) and genetic algorithm (GA) has been proposed for performing modeling and optimization of complex biological systems. In this approach, first an ANN approximates (models) the non-linear relationship(s) existing between its input and output example data sets. Next, the GA, which is a stochastic optimization technique, searches the input space of the ANN {{with a view to}} optimize the ANN output. The efficacy of this formalism has been tested by conducting a case study involving optimization of DNA curvature characterized in terms of the RL value. Using the ANN-GA methodology, a number of sequences possessing <b>high</b> <b>RL</b> values have been obtained and analyzed to verify the existence of features known to be responsible for the occurrence of curvature. A couple of sequences have also been tested experimentally. The experimental results validate qualitatively and also near-quantitatively, the solutions obtained using the hybrid formalism. The ANN-GA technique is a useful tool to obtain, ahead of experimentation, sequences that yield <b>high</b> <b>RL</b> values. The methodology is a general one and can be suitably employed for optimizing any other biological feature...|$|R

30|$|Recently, SSF {{has built}} up {{reliability}} in many industries and has evolved as an interesting substitute to SLF (Singhania et al. 2009). Severe foaming problems usually result from the production of biosurfactants in SLF and therefore, researches have suggested their production in SSF. Of these biosurfactants, RLs {{have been the most}} attractive for their production in SSF in recent years. The present work aimed at the optimization of the fermentation conditions for RL production in SSF. Twelve different solid substrates or combinations of solid substrates were screened for the production of RLs by the hyperproducing mutant 15 GR using GMSM as the impregnating solution. Selection of an appropriate substrate is an important feature of SSF since it acts as both a source of nutrients and a physical support (Pandey 2003). As shown in the results, the <b>highest</b> <b>RL</b> level was obtained with the mixture of sugarcane bagasse and sunflower seed meal. Sugarcane bagasse, a porous residue obtained from cane stalks after the juice extraction from sugarcane (Soccol et al. 2010) consists chiefly of cellulose and hemicelluloses, lignin, nitrogenous compounds, and ash (Abdullah et al. 2006). Sunflower seed meal is obtained by grinding sunflower seeds which are rich in lipids, carbohydrates and proteins (Alberton et al. 2010). The <b>high</b> <b>RL</b> levels obtained using this mixture {{may be due to the}} fact that oils usually stimulate RL production, as reported in previous SLF studies (Benincasa and Accorsini 2008; Costa et al. 2006; Trummler et al. 2003). Another explanation may be that the mixture of substrates resulted in a substrate bed with properties superior to single substrates. Using sunflower seed meal alone caused the solid substrate to compact considerably probably due to its high lipid content. Sugarcane bagasse acts as a bulking agent, improving the substrate bed properties (Alberton et al. 2010).|$|R

The inherent lipophilicity of GNTs provides them the ability to image cells at low magnetic field strength.

The rl relaxivity is ca. 20 times greater than for other paramagnetic Gd-based CAs.

40|$|In {{the field}} of {{immobilization}} of actinides in phosphate-based ceramics, several thorium and uranium doped britholite samples were submitted to leaching tests. The normalized dissolution rates determined for several pH values, temperatures and acidic media from the calcium release range from 4. 7 × 10 − 2 g m− 2 d− 1 to 21. 6 g m− 2 d− 1. Their comparison with that determined for phosphorus, thorium and uranium revealed that the dissolution is clearly incongruent for all the conditions examined. Whatever the leaching solution considered, calcium and phosphorus elements were always released with <b>higher</b> <b>RL</b> values than the other elements (Nd, Th, U). Simultaneously, thorium was found to quickly precipitate as alteration product, leading to diffusion phenomena for uranium. For all the media considered, the uranium release is {{higher than that of}} thorium, probably due to its oxidation from tetravalent oxidation state to uranyl. Moreover, the evaluation of the partial order related to proton concentration and the apparent energy of activation suggest that the reaction of dissolution is probably controlled by surface chemical reactions occurring at the solid/liquid interface. Finally, comparative leaching tests performed in sulphuric acid solutions revealed a significant influence of such media on the chemical durability of the leached pellets, leading to higher normalized dissolution rates for all the elements considered. On the basis of the results of chemical speciation, this difference was mainly explained in the light of higher complexion constants by sulfate ions compared to nitrate, chloride and phosphate...|$|R
30|$|Since {{major changes}} {{have been made in}} the {{fermentation}} conditions for RL production, the time course profile was repeated, using the optimized conditions reached (a 50 : 50 mixture of sugarcane bagasse and sunflower seed meal, an impregnating solution of 20  ml containing 5 %(v/v) glycerol, inoculum size 1 %v/v, pH 8 and incubation temperature of 30  °C). Again, maximum RL production was obtained after 10  days of incubation, however, the RL level this time was about 1.5 fold higher than results obtained in the previous time course study, reaching 46.85  g/l-IS. The obtained value was also about 5.5 folds higher than that obtained using SLF carried out in this study. Moreover, this RL level was obtained in a shorter time than most studies reported so far. In 2008, a maximum RL production of 46  g/l-IS (172  g/kg-IDS) by P. aeruginosa UFPEDA 614 in SSF using a 50 : 50 mixture of sugarcane bagasse and sunflower seed meal with 37.5  ml of impregnating solution containing 10 % v/v glycerol after 12  days was reported (Camilios-Neto et al. 2008). Although our RL yield is comparable with this value when expressed in terms of g/l-IS, our yield expressed in terms of g/kg of solid substrate showed lower values. This may be explained by the smaller volume of impregnating solution used in our study. Moreover, in 2011, the <b>highest</b> <b>RL</b> production of 45  g/l-IS was obtained by the same strain after 12  days of SSF using sugarcane bagasse and corn bran (1 : 1), and an impregnating solution of 35  ml containing 6 % (v/v) of each of glycerol and soybean oil (Camilios-Neto et al. 2011). Therefore, in our study, the mutant 15 GR yielded comparable RL concentrations that were reached in less time and using lower concentrations of carbon source than both these studies. Moreover, although maximum RL concentrations were obtained after 10 days of incubation, <b>high</b> <b>RL</b> levels were already achieved (41.87  g/l-IS (83.74  g/kg-IDS)) by the mutant 15 GR after only 6 days of incubation, unlike Camilios-Neto et al. (2008), whose RL yields reached only about 24  g/l-IS (89  g/kg-IDS) after 6 days of incubation. In addition, in 2017, maximum RL yields of 18.7  g/l was obtained using glycerol as carbon source and rapeseed/wheat bran as matrix (Wu et al. 2017). Our study hence presents an appropriate basis for subsequent studies on RL production using SSF. In conclusion, these results showed that the application of BBD and RSM were successful in enhancing the RL production under SSF by 67 % and a maximum RL concentration of 46.85  g/l-IS was obtained in the present study using a mixture of sugarcane bagasse and sunflower seed meal after only 10  days of incubation. Optimum fermentation conditions were found to be an inoculum size of 1 %v/v, a temperature of 30  °C and a pH of 8. These results suggest that SSF may possibly be a feasible substitute for SLF to produce RLs since our maximum yield was comparable with values that have been obtained in SLF: 23.6  g/l (Noh et al. 2014), 32  g/l (Matsufuji et al. 1997), 36.7  g/l (Muller et al. 2011), and 46  g/l (Linhardt et al. 1989). These findings imply that RL production by P. aeruginosa 15 GR in static tray bioreactors may be successful (Durand 2003). Additional concern to the application of SSF for RL production is hence justified for enhancing RL levels in laboratory-scale work even further and for moving up to pilot scale.|$|R

This study aimed to investigate tillage and P fertilization effects on root distribution and morphology {{of corn and}} soybean. A field corn-soybean rotation experiment established in 1992 at l’Acadie is a split-plot design (4 replicates) with tillage (moldboard plough (MP) and NT) and P fertilization (0 (0 P), 17. 5 (0. 5 P) and 35 (1 P) kg P·ha- 1 every two years) as main and sub-plot factors. Soils and corn roots were sampled in 2014 at silking stage by collecting soil cores to 60 -cm depth (0 - 5, 5 - 10, and every 10 cm) at 5, 15 and 25 cm perpendicularly to the row. Soybean roots were sampled in 2015 at flowering stage. Root length (RL) was determined with WinRHIZO. Corn root length density (RLD) was higher in MP (1. 48 cm·cm- 3) than in NT (1. 28 cm·cm- 3). 0 P and 0. 5 P treatments (1. 29 and 1. 23 cm·cm- 3, respectively) significantly reduced RLD compared to 1 P (1. 62 cm·cm- 3). Corn roots mostly accumulated at 0 - 5 and 5 - 10 cm. Tillage and P fertilization {{had no effect on}} corn root vertical distribution. However, tillage had significant effects on soybean root vertical partition. Soybean in NT had a RLD of 1. 95 cm·cm- 3 on average; and roots mostly accumulated at 0 - 10 cm with 44 % of total RL. MP had lower RLD (1. 55 cm·cm- 3), with the <b>highest</b> <b>RL</b> proportion (36 %) at 10 - 20 cm. Additionally, soybean had relatively higher RLDs in 0 P and 0. 5 P than 1 P.

Methods: Twenty-two semi-elite RL players and 24 physically active but untrained men completed a maximal oxygen consumption test (VO 2 max test) on a treadmill and electronic arm ergometer in a randomized order. Percent body fat was calculated from the sum of six skinfolds. Results: Lower and upper body absolute (P= 0. 03 and P= 0. 02 respectively) but not relative VO 2 max was <b>higher</b> in the <b>RL</b> group compared to the control group. Upper body peak power (P= 0. 001), ventilation (P= 0. 05) and lactate concentration (P= 0. 03) were <b>higher</b> in the <b>RL</b> group compared to the control group. Maximum heart rate was lower during arm ergometry for both groups (P ≤ 0. 001) compared to predicted and treadmill values. Conclusions: The results show that while semi-elite RL players have above average lower body aerobic capacity their upper body aerobic capacity is not well developed and similar to untrained men. Coaches and players need to implement separate and dedicated training programs to enhance the development of the upper body aerobic system in RL players. Upper body training should be based on maximal heart rate values achieved during upper body maximal testing...|$|R

In all three crops the rs, measured with a ventilated diffusion porometer, the ψ, measured with the pressure chamber, the π, measured with a vapor pressure osmometer, and the calculated P, decreased from sunrise to reach minimum values near midday and then increased again in the afternoon. The diurnal range of all the variables was greater for leaves in the upper canopy than {{for those in the}} lower canopy. P was observed to decrease with decreasing ψ, but never became zero. Sorghum had a higher P at a ψ of, say − 10 bars, than did maize, and maize had a higher P than tobacco at the same ψ.

When compared at high irradiances, rs did not increase as ψ declined to − 13, − 15, and − 10 bars or as P declined to 0. 3, 3. 5, and 1. 2 bars in maize, sorghum, and tobacco, respectively. The relation between rs and I in the upper, nonsenescent leaves of all three crops fits a hyperbolic curve, but the response varied with species and leaf senescence. The adaxial and abaxial epidermises had the same response of rs to I in maize and sorghum, whereas in tobacco the adaxial epidermis had a higher rs than the abaxial epidermis at all values of I.

The characters evaluated were: plant (PL), shoot (SL) and root (RL) length; total plant (PDM), shoot (SDM), root (RDM) and lateral root (LRDM) dry matter. A lateral root index (LRI) and shoot root dry matter (SRDM = SDM/RDM) and length ratios; (SRL = SL/RL) were calculated.

The Arábica coffee standard variety showed intermediary root and shoot development. Genotypes of high yield background were higher in SL and SDM, while the dwarf types had only lower SL than the normal ones, but <b>higher</b> <b>RL</b> and dry matters.

EPA 314.0 describes two methods to establish the MCT: a regression method and the method of the highest acceptable conductance level. EPA 314.0 suggests determining the MCT on a perchlorate concentration level that is five times <b>higher</b> than the <b>RL.</b> In the EPA method, the MCT experiments were conducted on a 25  µg/L perchlorate level corresponding to perchlorate RLs of 3 – 5  µg/L [3]. In this study, the evaluations were performed on a concentration level of 10  µg/L perchlorate, reflecting potentially lower concentrations to be addressed by the ISO standard. The experiments were repeated using identical chromatographic conditions with an unused IonPac AS 20 column set. Both data sets demonstrated a similar retention time, recovery, and MCT. Table  2 summarizes the results of these data sets.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background When {{the steroid}} hormones {{estrogen}} and progesterone bind to nuclear receptors, they have transcriptional impact on target {{genes in the}} human endometrium. These transcriptional changes have a critical function in preparing the endometrium for embryo implantation. Methods 382 genes were selected, differentially expressed in the receptive endometrium, to study their responsiveness of estrogen and progesterone. The endometrial cell lines HEC 1 A and RL 95 - 2 were used as experimental models for the non-receptive and receptive endometrium, respectively. Putative targets for activated steroid hormone receptors were investigated by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) using receptor-specific antibodies. Promoter occupancy of the selected genes by steroid receptors was detected in ChIP-purified DNA by quantitative PCR (qPCR). Expression analysis by reverse transcriptase (RT) -PCR was used to further investigate hormone dependent mRNA expression regulation of a subset of genes. Results ChIP-qPCR analysis demonstrated that each steroid hormone receptor had distinct group of target genes in the endometrial cell lines. After estradiol treatment, expression of estrogen receptor target genes predominated in HEC 1 A cells (n = 137) compared to RL 95 - 2 cells (n = 35). In contrast, expression of progesterone receptor target genes was <b>higher</b> in <b>RL</b> 95 - 2 cells (n = 83) than in HEC 1 A cells (n = 7) after progesterone treatment. RT-PCR analysis of 20 genes demonstrated transcriptional changes after estradiol or progesterone treatment of the cell lines. Conclusions Combined results from ChIP-qPCR and RT-PCR analysis showed different patterns of steroid hormone receptor occupancy at target genes, corresponding to activation or suppression of gene expression after hormone treatment of HEC 1 A and RL 95 - 2 cell lines. </p...|$|R
40|$|We {{present an}} {{analysis}} of CCD photometric observations of the eclipsing novalike cataclysmic variable DW UMa obtained in two different luminosity states: high and intermediate. The star presents eclipses with very different depth: ~ 1. 2 mag in the high and ~ 3. 4 mag in the intermediate state. Eclipse mapping reveals that this difference is almost entirely due to {{the changes in the}} accretion disc radius: from ~ 0. 5 RL 1 in the intermediate state to ~ 0. 75 RL 1 in the <b>high</b> state (<b>RL</b> 1 is the distance from the white dwarf to the first Lagrangian point). In the intermediate state, the entire disc is eclipsed while in the high state, its outer part remains visible. We also find that the central intensity of the disc is nearly the same in the two luminosity states and that it is the increase of the disc radius that is responsible for the final rise from the 1999 / 2000 low state. We find that the intensity profile of the disc is rather flat and suggest a possible explanation. We also discuss the effect of using a more realistic limb-darkening law on the disc temperatures inferred from eclipse mapping experiments. Periodogram analysis of the high state data reveals "positive superhumps" with a period of 0. 1455 in 2002 and 0. 1461 in 2003, in accord with the results of Patterson et al. However, we cannot confirm the quasi-periodic oscillations reported by these authors. We obtain an updated orbital ephemeris of DW UMa: Tmin[HJD]= 2446229. 00687 (9) + 0. 136606527 (3) E.

40|$|Recently osteopontin (OPN), {{a protein}} of the {{extracellular}} matrix, has generated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) a significant interest as a prognostic factor. Aim {{of this study}} was to confirm, in liver tissues of subjects with HCV-positive HCC undergoing liver transplantation (RL, n= 10) and of donors (DL, n= 14), the increase of OPN plasma and tissue concentration, the OPN splicing isoforms expression profiling together with those of thrombin, and to evaluate a possible association between OPN measurements. Their association with Notch- 1, IV-Collagen- 7 s domain, IL- 6 and TNF-α were also evaluated. Real-Time PCR experiments and immunometric assay were performed. mRNA expression resulted <b>higher</b> in <b>RL</b> than in DL for all analyzed genes and several correlations were found between them. The more relevant association were between OPN-a and OPN-b (p< 0. 0001), between thrombin and OPN-a (p= 0. 007), between 7 s-collagen and OPN isoforms (p< 0. 05) and between Notch- 1 with OPN-c (p= 0. 004). Both OPN plasma and liver tissue extract concentrations were assessed confirming the trend observed at the mRNA level. An important association was found between OPN plasma and protein (p< 0. 0001, r= 0. 96) even splitting patients in DL (p< 0. 0001, r= 0. 93) and RL (p< 0. 0001, r= 0. 96). A reduction of OPN plasma levels was found at 6 months after transplantation. Considering MELD score as liver disease severity, the mRNA expression of our markers as well as of OPN plasma and tissue concentrations resulted increased as a function of clinical severity. Our results might be considered a useful starting point to validate OPN as a prognostic and diagnostic marker of HCC...|$|R
