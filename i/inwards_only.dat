60|$|It is an {{important}} fact that when an organic or inorganic object {{is placed on the}} glands of the disc, and the exterior tentacles are thus caused to bend <b>inwards,</b> not <b>only</b> is the secretion from the glands of the latter increased in quantity and rendered acid, but the contents of the cells of their pedicels become aggregated. The process always commences in the glands, although these have not as yet touched any object. Some force or influence must, therefore, be transmitted from the central glands to the exterior tentacles, first to near their bases causing this part to bend, and next to the glands causing them to secrete more copiously. After a short time the glands, thus indirectly excited, transmit or reflect some influence down their own pedicels, inducing aggregation in cell beneath cell to their bases.|$|R

It is widespread on islands in Western Pacific Ocean, including Hawaii, and presents combinations of unusual features which make easily recognizable for field workers. These include dirty white shell exterior with deep purple colored interior, operculars colored purple. Opercular plates {{on each side}} calcify together in all but youngest individuals, and cannot be separated or easily distinguished from each other. This feature is shared only by Rehderella belyaevi, but in latter species, scutum and tergum can be distinguished by raised ridge replacing old articular margin. Unique feature of Nesochthamalus is its basis. In young individuals, it is entirely membraneous, and with age, becomes secondarily calcareous progressively <b>inwards,</b> leaving <b>only</b> the center membraneous. As the basis calcifies, it rises off the substrate forming a saucer shape when viewed from the side. In addition, interior of shell is secondarily calcified.|$|R

30|$|An {{accurate}} {{depiction of}} the time evolution {{of a black hole}} magnetosphere and the global considerations germane to the IACS are intimately related to minimizing the numerical dissipation of Alfven waves. The IACS is a one-way surface as far as t he propagation of Alfven waves is concerned. In other words, at the IACS and within it, all Alfven waves should propagate <b>inwards</b> and <b>only</b> <b>inwards.</b> The propagation of waves in a higher order Godunov code is modulated by the Riemann solver. It is, therefore desirable if the Riemann solver can mimic this one-way propagation property for Alfven waves. Alas, whether a Riemann solver does so or not, depends crucially on the design of the Riemann solver. Some Riemann solvers which retain the substructure associated with Alfven waves within the Riemann fan, can indeed represent such a one-way propagation of Alfven waves. Other Riemann solvers, like the HLL Riemann solver, do not retain the substructure associated with the Alfven waves. At extraordinarily high resolutions, any well-designed code will of course minimize this dissipation. However, the present generation of simulations have all been done with low or modest resolutions. Furthermore, they have mostly used the HLL Riemann solver which, we argue, applies a maximal, and deleterious, dissipation to Alfven waves. To appreciate this point, realize that the HLL Riemann solver is based on a wave model that has just two extremal waves. These two extremal waves determine the ends of the Riemann fan in one-dimension. The speed of these extremal waves is usually set to the extremal signal speeds in the physical problem. For a relativistic MHD (RMHD) simulation of highly magnetized event horizon magnetospheres, these extremal signal speeds are usually set to approximately the speed of light propagating in either direction at a zone interface where the Riemann solver is applied. The HLL Riemann solver does not incorporate any further sub-structure associated with intermediate waves. Consequently, the HLL Riemann solver maximizes the dissipation of Alfven waves even near the IACS. This is the very location where the dissipation of these waves has to be minimized. Introducing the intermediate waves in the Riemann fan reduces the dissipation, but that effect is not incorporated in the HLL Riemann solver.|$|R

This book aims at enlightening {{the process}} whereby {{comparative}} knowledge and comparative practices were developed {{as part of}} a mechanism of world description. Comparison, it is argued, is part of a process of confrontation producing particular notions of self and other, of similarity and dissimilarity, either this relates to contrasting mores, cultures, Civilizations, Nation-states or educational systems. Despite great changes in world history in the past centuries, be it in religious, economic or political terms, the comparative mind has had enormous difficulties to approach difference. From the Greeks to the Middle Ages, from the Portuguese discoveries and travel narratives up to modern globalization times, comparative practices have tended to systematically normalize discrepancy by means of producing intellectual tools aimed at identifying differences which can be permanently re-conducted to sameness. Narrative descriptions, naturalist historiography and later on the social sciences all share comparative discourses that criss-cross our knowledge building processes. The intellectual and methodological tools that were developed along with disciplinarization processes in order to analyse and decompose the complexity of the self/other equation belong, in fact, to pre-scientific times. By underlying the processes of discourse formation in comparative education this work attempts to look <b>inwards</b> not <b>only</b> into the disciplinary field but also to the theoretical mechanisms at work (concept formation, analytical procedures, scientific validation) that perpetuate tenets, representations and ideological stances from early comparative times. Three moments in time-history are to be considered as turning points: the time of experience (the comparison that emerges out of confrontation), the time of science (the nature as a metaphor) and the time of Man (the emergence of the social sciences). From these critical turning-points the discussion pursues on determining potential breakaways to the comparative mind, calling forth new comparative approaches in face of the acute internationalization of the educational systems...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Isolated single {{crayfish}} {{muscle fibers}} were locally activated by applying negative current pulses to a pipette whose tip was {{in contact with}} the fiber surface. The contraction initiated by a moderate depolarization spread inwards in a graded manner according to the magnitude and duration of depolarization. Increase of the depolarized area increased the distance of the inward spread for a given amount of depolarization. If a large area of the surface membrane was depolarized with a large pipette for a sufficiently long time, the contraction spread not <b>only</b> <b>inwards,</b> but further transversely passing {{through the center of the}} fiber. Successive brief depolarizations given at an appropriate interval could produce contraction more effectively for a given amount of total current than did a prolonged depolarization. On the other hand, the contraction initiated by a strong negative current was observed to spread around the whole perimeter but not through the center of the fiber. Each type of local contraction always spread along the striation pattern and not longitudinally. Possible mechanisms of these responses are discussed in connection with the transverse tubular system of the muscle fibers...|$|R
40|$|We {{analyze the}} orbital and mass {{evolution}} of planets that undergo run-away gas accretion {{by means of}} 2 D and 3 D hydrodynamic simulations. The disk torque distribution per unit disk mass {{as a function of}} radius provides an important diagnostic for the nature of the disk-planet interactions. We first consider torque distributions for nonmigrating planets of fixed mass and show that there is general agreement with the expectations of resonance theory. We then present results of simulations for mass-gaining, migrating planets. For planets with an initial mass of 5 Earth masses, which are embedded in disks with standard parameters and which undergo run-away gas accretion to one Jupiter mass (Mjup), the torque distributions per unit disk mass are largely unaffected by migration and accretion for a given planet mass. The migration rates for these planets are in agreement with the predictions of the standard theory for planet migration (Type I and Type II migration). The planet mass growth occurs through gas capture within the planet's Bondi radius at lower planet masses, the Hill radius at intermediate planet masses, and through reduced accretion at higher planet masses due to gap formation. During run-away mass growth, a planet migrates <b>inwards</b> by <b>only</b> about 20 % in radius before achieving a mass of ~ 1 Mjup. For the above models, we find no evidence of fast migration driven by coorbital torques, known as Type III migration. We do find evidence of Type III migration for a fixed mass planet of Saturn's mass that is immersed in a cold and massive disk. In this case the planet migration is assumed to begin before gap formation completes. The migration is understood through a model in which the torque is due to an asymmetry in density between trapped gas on the leading side of the planet and ambient gas on the trailing side of the planet.

60|$|LILIACEAE.--Gloriosa Plantii.--The stem of a half-grown plant {{continually}} moved, generally describing {{an irregular}} spire, but sometimes oval figures with the longer axes directed in different lines. It either followed the sun, or moved in an opposite course, and sometimes stood still before reversing its direction. One oval {{was completed in}} 3 hrs. 40 m.; of two horseshoe-shaped figures, one was completed in 4 hrs. 35 m. {{and the other in}} 3 hrs. The shoots, in their movements, reached points between four and five inches asunder. The young leaves, when first developed, stand up nearly vertically; but by the growth of the axis, and by the spontaneous bending down of the terminal half of the leaf, they soon become much inclined, and ultimately horizontal. The end of the leaf forms a narrow, ribbon- like, thickened projection, which at first is nearly straight, {{but by the time the}} leaf gets into an inclined position, the end bends downwards into a well-formed hook. This hook is now strong and rigid enough to catch any object, and, when caught, to anchor the plant and stop the revolving movement. Its inner surface is sensitive, but not in nearly so high a degree as that of the many before-described petioles; for a loop of string, weighing 1.64 grain, produced no effect. When the hook has caught a thin twig or even a rigid fibre, the point may be perceived in from 1 hr. to 3 hrs. to have curled a little inwards; and, under favourable circumstances, it curls round and permanently seizes an object in from 8 hrs. to 10 hrs. The hook when first formed, before the leaf has bent downwards, is but little sensitive. If it catches hold of nothing, it remains open and sensitive for a long time; ultimately the extremity spontaneously and slowly curls inwards, and makes a button-like, flat, spiral coil at the end of the leaf. One leaf was watched, and the hook remained open for thirty-three days; but during the last week the tip had curled so much <b>inwards</b> that <b>only</b> a very thin twig could have been inserted within it. As soon as the tip has curled so much inwards that the hook is converted into a ring, its sensibility is lost; but as long as it remains open some sensibility is retained.|$|R
40|$|Tidal Downsizing is {{the modern}} {{version of the}} Kuiper (1951) {{scenario}} of planet formation. Detailed simulations of self-gravitating discs, gas fragments, dust grain dynamics, and planet evolutionary calculations are summarised here and used to build a predictive planet formation model and population synthesis. A new interpretation of exoplanetary and debris disc data, the Solar System's origins, and the links between planets and brown dwarfs is offered. This interpretation is contrasted with the current observations and the predictions of the Core Accretion theory. Observations that can distinguish the two scenarios are pointed out. In particular, Tidal Downsizing predicts that presence of debris discs, sub-Neptune mass planets, planets more massive than ∼ 5 Jupiter masses and brown dwarfs should not correlate strongly with the metallicity of the host. For gas giants of ∼ Saturn to a few Jupiter mass, a strong host star metallicity correlation is predicted <b>only</b> <b>inwards</b> of a few AU from the host. Composition of massive cores is predicted {{to be dominated by}} rock rather than ices. Debris discs made by Tidal Downsizing are distinct from those made by Core Accretion at birth: they have an innermost edge always larger than about 1 au, have smaller total masses and are usually in a dynamically excited state. It is argued that planet formation in surprisingly young or very dynamic systems such as HL Tau and Kepler- 444 may be a signature of Tidal Downsizing. Open questions and potential weaknesses of the hypothesis are pointed out. Comment: 49 pages. Accepted by PASA. This is the pre final submission version [...] comments welcom...|$|R
40|$|Release of {{the human}} {{rhinovirus}} (HRV) genome into the cytoplasm of the cell involves a concerted structural modification of the viral capsid. The intracellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM- 1) cellular receptor of the major-group HRVs and the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor of the minor-group HRVs have different nonoverlapping binding sites. While ICAM- 1 binding catalyzes uncoating, LDL receptor binding does not. Uncoating of minor-group HRVs is initiated by the low pH of late endosomes. We have studied the conformational changes concomitant with uncoating in the major-group HRV 14 and compared them with previous results for the minor-group HRV 2. The structure of empty HRV 14 was determined by cryoelectron microscopy, and the atomic structure of native HRV 14 {{was used to examine}} the conformational changes of the capsid and its constituent viral proteins. For both HRV 2 and HRV 14, the transformation from full to empty capsid involves an overall 4 % expansion and an iris type of movement of viral protein VP 1 to open up a 10 -Å-diameter channel on the fivefold axis to allow exit of the RNA genome. The β-cylinders formed by the N termini of the VP 3 molecules inside the capsid on the fivefold axis all open up in HRV 2, but we propose that only one opens up in HRV 14. The release of VP 4 is less efficient in HRV 14 than in HRV 2, and the N termini of VP 1 may exit at different points. The N-terminal loop of VP 2 is modified in both viruses, probably to detach the RNA, but it bends <b>only</b> <b>inwards</b> in HRV 2...|$|R
