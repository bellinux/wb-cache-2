5|$|Some astronomers had {{suggested}} that the impacts might have a noticeable effect on the Io torus, a torus of high-energy particles connecting Jupiter with the highly volcanic moon Io.

5|$|Throughout {{the state}} of Florida, the storm {{destroyed}} 2,156homes and trailers, severely damaged 3,903, and inflicted minor impact on 30,524 others. Approximately 391farm buildings were destroyed, an additional 989suffered extensive <b>impact,</b> <b>and</b> 2,499 others received minor damage. Roughly 174buildings were demolished, 1,029 received major <b>impact,</b> <b>and</b> 4,254 suffered minor damage. Additionally, 281boats were destroyed or severely damaged. A total of 50% of grapefruit crop was lost, 10% of the orange and tangerine crops were ruined, and the avocado crop was almost destroyed. With at least $350million in damage in Florida alone, Donna was the costliest hurricane to impact the state, at the time. Additionally, there were 14confirmed fatalities: six from drowning, four from heart attacks, two from automobile accidents, and two from electrocution. About 1,188 others were injured.|$|E
5|$|According to MCC {{guidelines}} for umpires, factors {{to consider when}} giving an lbw decision include the angle at which the ball was travelling and whether the ball was swinging through the air. He must also account for {{the height of the}} ball at <b>impact</b> <b>and</b> how far from the wicket the batsman was standing; from this information he must determine if the ball would have passed over the stumps or struck them. The MCC guidance states that it is easier to make a decision when the ball strikes the batsman without pitching, but that the difficulty increases when the ball has bounced and more so when there is a shorter time between the ball pitching and striking the batsman.|$|E
5|$|After {{directing}} Finding Nemo, Stanton felt Pixar {{had created}} believable simulations of underwater physics and {{was willing to}} direct a film set largely in space. WALL-E has minimal dialogue in its early sequences; many of the characters do not have voices, but instead communicate with body language and robotic sounds designed by Burtt. The film criticizes consumerism, corporatism, nostalgia, waste management, human environmental <b>impact</b> <b>and</b> concerns, obesity, and global catastrophic risk. It is also Pixar's first animated film with segments featuring live-action characters. Following Pixar tradition, WALL-E was paired with a short film titled Presto for its theatrical release.|$|E

5|$|After {{just one}} winning season in 10 years under coaches Sandra Hamm (1974–75), Wanda Flora (1975–80) and Jean Balthaser (1980–85), UConn hired as their new head coach the Italian-born Geno Auriemma, {{who had served}} as {{assistant}} coach at Virginia, {{with the goal of}} revitalizing the program. Auriemma's training skills had an immediate <b>impact</b> <b>and</b> the team showed steady signs of progress: after going 12–15 in his first season in 1985–86, Auriemma led UConn to winning seasons in 1986–87 and 1987–88.|$|E
5|$|Afterwards, local townspeople went to {{see what}} happened, and 100 to 200 people who got near to the {{meteorite}} crater soon reported feeling sick. First responding police officers arriving to investigate the scene also fell ill. After the initial event of September 15, {{the number of people}} falling ill increased, requiring physicians to establish auxiliary medical tents for the Carancas health center. Patients were treated for dermal injuries, nausea, headaches, diarrhea and vomiting. The death of nearby livestock was also reported. Locals made the decision to stop drinking from nearby water sources for fear of contamination and authorities considered declaring a state of emergency. Four days after the meteorite <b>impact</b> <b>and</b> the unexplained illness, most villagers reported having recovered.|$|E
5|$|Also {{known as}} a {{manifold}} cage or regulator cage, this is a structure which can be clamped to {{the neck of the}} cylinder or manifolded cylinders to protect the valves and regulator first stages from <b>impact</b> <b>and</b> abrasion damage while in use and from rolling the valve closed by friction of the handwheel against an overhead. A valve cage is often made of stainless steel, and some designs can snag on obstructions.|$|E

Four young orphans under the care of Topapa, the village elder, explore the earthquake's <b>impact</b> <b>and</b> come across a crystal of light. The crystal grants them a portion of its power, and instructs them to go forth and restore balance to the world. Not knowing what to make of the crystal's pronouncements, but nonetheless recognizing the importance of its words, the four inform their adoptive family of their mission and set out to explore an overworld outside the area in which they were brought up, in order to bring balance back to the world.|$|E
5|$|An inter-municipal railway {{committee}} {{was established in}} 1941. Led by Sigval Bergesen, it considered the possibility of extending the Ålgård Line towards Hunnedalen via Setesdalsheiene to Lunde in Telemark. The line would be built with a higher standard than the Sørlandet Line and have a shorter route, allowing travel time from Stavanger to Oslo to be reduced to four to five hours. A detailed plan was made for the extension from Ålgård to the county border with Telemark. To consider the proposal, parliament established a committee in 1949 {{to look at the}} various proposals. After considering the <b>impact</b> <b>and</b> value of the various railways that had been proposed in the 1940s, it recommended not building the Inner Trunk Line, as the expansion had been christened.|$|E
5|$|As {{the highway}} would {{pass through the}} Hamersley National Park, the Environmental Protection Authority decided in 1983 that an Environment Review and Management Program report was {{required}} for the Newman to White Springs section. Consultants prepared the report for Main Roads, which found that the key risks were erosion, visual <b>impact,</b> <b>and</b> possible damage to flora. A detailed survey was carried out, which included the use of laser and infra-red measuring devices from within a helicopter, and numerous field trips to determine the final alignment and bridge sites. A comprehensive Environmental Impact Statement was then produced, and the project was approved in mid-1984.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper offers}} a {{critical}} review of modeling practice {{in the field of}} integrated assessment of climate change and ways forward. Past efforts in integrated assessment have concentrated on developing baseline trajectories of emissions and mitigation scenario analyses. A key missing component in IAMs is the representation of climate <b>impacts</b> <b>and</b> adaptation responses. Through the examination of conceptual, theoretical and empirical frameworks for the analysis of climate <b>impacts</b> <b>and</b> adaptation, we identify five characteristics of an ideal IAM: regional and sectoral detail for <b>impacts</b> <b>and</b> adaptation strategies; distinct representation of the three types of adaptation—adaptation through market adjustments, protective/defensive expenditures, and adaptive/coping expenditures; intertemporal decision making under uncertainty; induced innovation in adaptation-related technologies; and connection with empirical work on <b>impacts</b> <b>and</b> adaptation. Our review of existing IAMs finds that most models are severely lacking in most of these modeling features. ...|$|R
