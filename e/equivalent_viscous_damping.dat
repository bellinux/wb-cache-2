40|$|The paper {{discusses}} {{the design and}} performance of a novel type of passive control system used for suppressing unwanted vibrations in civil engineering structures subjected to both lateral and base excitation. The new control system is inspired by the traditional tuned mass damper (TMD) with the modification that the mass is replaced by an inerter. An inerter has a two-terminal flywheel device capable of generating high apparent mass and its application is now extended from Formula 1 car suspension systems to train suspensions and building base isolation systems. The new control device is named the tuned inerter damper (TID). The tuning of the TID is based on existing tuning guidelines for damped vibration absorbers. We are assessing {{the performance of the}} TID in comparison to an equivalent TMD and an <b>equivalent</b> <b>viscous</b> <b>damper,</b> to show the advantages brought by the inerter’s capacity of generating extra apparent mass. The analysis shows that the TID is capable of suppressing the response of higher vibration modes, while the TMD can only control the single mode targeted during the tuning of the device. Moreover, the TID is most efficient when located {{at the bottom of the}} structure, which is a potential advantage compared with TMD installation. A multi-degree-of-freedom (DOF) structure is presented as a numerical study to verify our theoretical results. The structure was subjected to base excitation in the form of unit impulse and earthquake load, and to lateral excitation based on wind tunnel tests data. Its performance was similar or superior to that of an <b>equivalent</b> TMD or <b>viscous</b> <b>damper.</b> Therefore, the TID represents a potentially attractive alternative to traditional passive control techniques...|$|R

In order to obtain accurate predictions, the system damping properties must be properly {{taken into account in}} the finite element model used for coupled loads analysis.

Therefore, the structural damping matrix of the system must be converted into an <b>equivalent</b> <b>viscous</b> <b>damping</b> matrix when a transient coupled loads analysis is performed. This paper focuses on the validation of <b>equivalent</b> <b>viscous</b> <b>damping</b> methods for dynamically condensed finite element models via correlation with experimental data for a realistic structure representative of a slender launch vehicle with solid rocket motors.

By using identification of each building for several earthquakes and dividing the time histories into short segments, structural response trends can be investigated. It is shown that structural period and damping vary with amplitude of excitation.

The particle dampers (PDs) {{as one of the}} passive damping devices has found wide use in the field of aeronautical engineering, mechanical engineering, and civil engineering because it has several advantages compared with the forms of <b>viscous</b> <b>damping,</b> for example, structure simplicity, low cost, robust properties, and being effective over a wide range of frequencies.

40|$|Damage {{detection}} in structural {{health monitoring}} is usually done by correlating {{the level of}} damage in a structure to its dynamic parameters estimated from vibration records. In buildings such correlations are not well established. A vibration-based damage detection technique that is {{able to identify the}} structural condition of the system based on small amplitude vibrations is desirable because such kind of data are typically available. This study focuses on the relationships between small-amplitude vibration dynamic properties and past levels of displacement in reinforced concrete structures. Small displacements are defined as displacements below an overall drift ratio of 0. 03 %. Laboratory tests on a full-scale flat-plate structure and a series of small-scale beams were done. It is observed that natural frequency and <b>equivalent</b> <b>viscous</b> <b>damping</b> ratio are displacement-dependent parameters even at small displacement levels. Such displacement-dependency of dynamic parameters was captured by using an elastic single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) system with variable stiffness and variable <b>equivalent</b> <b>viscous</b> <b>damping,</b> i. e., nonlinear-elastic SDOF, to represent the small-amplitude vibration response of the reinforced concrete structures. It is found that change in the dynamic parameters with past maximum displacement is tracked best using tests done at identical displacement. Observations from tests are compared to those extracted from experiments done by other researchers. In the small-scale beams, the <b>equivalent</b> <b>viscous</b> <b>damping</b> ratio measured at small displacements found to increase from the as-built level with displacement initially but then decrease once the past maximum drift reaches approximately the yield level. A similar behavior is observed in a full-scale 7 -story structure. A condition based on relative change in fundamental frequency and <b>equivalent</b> <b>viscous</b> <b>damping</b> ratio is suggested to define, and identify, a characteristic displacement associated with yield in reinforced concrete buildings. However, more data from full-scale building tests are necessary to justify the extension of the observations made from small-scale test for use in structural health monitoring of actual buildings. Nonlinear-elastic SDOF model representation has encountered difficulties when applied on currently existing data sets from full-scale buildings. A practical finding {{of this study is that}} the fundamental frequency in a typical reinforced concrete building reduces to approximately 2 / 3 of that measured at as-built condition after the structure is subjected to approximately 1. 5 % maximum drift ratio level. ...|$|E

As the excitation level is increased, the response power spectrum predicted by the uncoupled model becomes broader and more shifted towards the high frequencies than that obtained by the coupled model. In addition, the difference in response between the coupled and uncoupled models at high frequencies becomes larger. When a high intensity harmonic excitation is used, causing a nonlinear plate response, both models predict the same frequency content of the response. However, the level of the harmonics and subharmonics are higher for the uncoupled model. Comparisons to earlier experimental and numerical results show that acoustic coupling has a significant effect on the plate response at high excitation levels.

Variable control feel including response feel is provided from the following five sources: control position, control rate, normal acceleration, pitching velocity, and pitching acceleration. This system provides a very flexible tool for more detailed study of longitudinal control feel characteristics than has previously been possible. The evaluation program for the variable-feel system yielded flight time histories which illustrate effects on the stability of airplane and control-system response modes of large amounts of response feel.
