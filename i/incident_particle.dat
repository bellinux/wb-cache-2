25|$|Charged {{radiation}} species (α and β particles) interact through Coulombic forces {{between the}} charges of the electrons in the absorbing medium and the charged radiation particle. These interactions occur continuously along {{the path of the}} <b>incident</b> <b>particle</b> until the kinetic energy of the particle is sufficiently depleted. Uncharged species (γ photons, x-rays) undergo a single event per photon, totally consuming the energy of the photon and leading to the ejection of an electron from a single atom. Electrons with sufficient energy proceed to interact with the absorbing medium identically to β radiation.|$|E
25|$|At {{this point}} Einstein brings into play the first screen {{as well and}} argues as follows: since the {{incident}} particles have velocities (practically) perpendicular to the screen S1, and since {{it is only the}} interaction with this screen that can cause a deflection from the original direction of propagation, by the law of conservation of impulse which implies that the sum of the impulses of two systems which interact is conserved, if the <b>incident</b> <b>particle</b> is deviated toward the top, the screen will recoil toward the bottom and vice versa. In realistic conditions the mass of the screen is so large that it will remain stationary, but, in principle, it is possible to measure even an infinitesimal recoil. If we imagine taking the measurement of the impulse of the screen in the direction X after every single particle has passed, we can know, {{from the fact that the}} screen will be found recoiled toward the top (bottom), whether the particle in question has been deviated toward the bottom or top, and therefore through which slit in S2 the particle has passed. But since the determination of the direction of the recoil of the screen after the particle has passed cannot influence the successive development of the process, we will still have an interference figure on the screenF. The interference takes place precisely because the state of the system is the superposition of two states whose wave functions are non-zero only near one of the two slits. On the other hand, if every particle passes through only the slit b or the slit c, then the set of systems is the statistical mixture of the two states, which means that interference is not possible. If Einstein is correct, then there is a violation of the principle of indeterminacy.|$|E
2500|$|Generally speaking, {{surface bonding}} is {{different}} from the bonding within the bulk of a material. [...] In order to accurately model and describe the surface characteristics and properties of a material, it is necessary to understand the specific bonding mechanisms at work at the surface. [...] To do this, one must employ a technique that is able to probe only the surface, we call such a technique [...] "surface-sensitive". [...] That is, the 'observing' particle (whether it be an electron, a neutron, or an atom) {{needs to be able to}} only 'see' (gather information from) the surface. [...] If the penetration depth of the <b>incident</b> <b>particle</b> is too deep into the sample, the information it carries out of the sample for detection will contain contributions not only from the surface, but also from the bulk material. [...] While there are several techniques that probe only the first few monolayers of a material, such as low-energy electron diffraction (LEED), helium atom scattering is unique in that it does not penetrate the surface of the sample at all! [...] In fact, the scattering 'turnaround' point of the helium atom is 3-4 Angstroms above the surface plane of atoms on the material. [...] Therefore, the information carried out in the scattered helium atom comes solely from the very surface of the sample.|$|E

50|$|In chemistry, nuclear physics, and {{particle}} physics, {{inelastic scattering}} {{is a fundamental}} scattering {{process in which the}} kinetic energy of an <b>incident</b> <b>particle</b> is not conserved (in contrast to elastic scattering). In an inelastic scattering process, some of the energy of the <b>incident</b> <b>particle</b> is lost or increased. Although the term is historically related to the concept of inelastic collision in dynamics, the two concepts are quite distinct; inelastic collision in dynamics refers to processes in which the total macroscopic kinetic energy is not conserved. In general, scattering due to inelastic collisions will be inelastic, but, since elastic collisions often transfer kinetic energy between particles, scattering due to elastic collisions can also be inelastic, as in Compton scattering.|$|E
50|$|Using these parameters, {{absorber}} foils do {{not need}} to be incorporated into the instrument design.
