40|$|Helically <b>grooved</b> annular <b>seal</b> {{configurations}} {{were tested}} in highly turbulent flow to determine if reduced leakage and enhanced stability would result from the pumping action of the seal. It was found that: (1) leakage of a helically <b>grooved</b> <b>seals</b> decreases with running speed; (2) leakage reduction due to increased running speed is greater at lower values of R sub a; (3) an asymptote for leakage reduction is indicated with increasing running speed; (4) leakage is reduced by reducing the ridge (minimum) and average clearances; (5) leakage increases with increasing pitch angles and with increasing <b>groove</b> depth. Plain <b>seals</b> with smooth rotors and stators will leak more than a helically <b>grooved</b> <b>seal.</b> It was also found that plain seals with a rough rotor and a rough stator leak less than a properly designed helically <b>grooved</b> <b>seal.</b> A properly designed helically <b>grooved</b> <b>seal</b> consumes {{at least twice as}} much power as a conventional annular seal...|$|R
40|$|Helical <b>groove</b> <b>seal</b> is {{designed}} in reactor coolant pump {{to control the}} leakage along the front surface of the impeller face due to its higher resistance than the circumferentially <b>grooved</b> <b>seal.</b> The flow and the friction factors in helical <b>groove</b> <b>seals</b> are predicted by employing a commercial CFD code, FLUENT. The friction factors of the helical <b>groove</b> <b>seals</b> with helix angles varying from 20 [*]deg to 50 [*]deg, at a range of rotational speed and axial Reynolds number, were, respectively, calculated. For the helically grooved stator with the helix angle greater than 20 [*]deg, the leakage shows an upward trend with the helix angle. The circumferentially grooved stator has a lower resistance to leakage than the 20 [*]deg and 30 [*]deg stators. It can be predicated that, for a bigger helix angle, the friction factor increases slightly {{with an increase in}} high axial Reynolds number, which arises from the high-pressure operation condition, and the friction factor is generally sensitive to changes in the helix angle in this operation condition. The study lays the theoretical foundation for liquid seal design of reactor coolant pump and future experimental study to account for the high-pressure condition affecting the leakage characteristic...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{provides}} experimental {{static and}} dynamic results for four pairs of seals, including {{a pair of}} smooth seals and three pairs of centrally <b>grooved</b> <b>seals.</b> The <b>grooved</b> <b>seals</b> have <b>groove</b> depth to clearance ratios (Dg/C) of 5, 10, and 15. The radial clearance of each test seal is 0. 0891 mm. Test conditions include three shaft rotational speeds from 4000 to 10000 rpm, three inlet oil pressures from 24 to 70 bars, and seal dimensionless eccentricities from 0 (centered) to 0. 7. For each pair of test seals, dynamic results include stiffness and damping coefficients; static results include stator position, attitude angles, and seal leakage. Stiffness, damping, and leakage are compared among the seal pairs with various groove depths. Results show that all rotordynamic coefficients consistently decrease with increasing <b>seal</b> <b>groove</b> depths, and <b>seal</b> leakage remains constant through varying groove depths. Additionally, a comparison is made between experimental results of all test seals and XLLubeGT. XLLubeGT is a computer model developed at Texas A&M University, which uses a Reynolds equation + energy equation model to predict dynamic performance of a <b>grooved</b> <b>seal.</b> It operates {{on the assumption that}} the groove is large enough to create separate lands within the seal, creating a zero or negligible pressure perturbation across the seal. A comparison with XLLubeGT shows that even the seal with the largest groove depth tested is not deep enough to agree with XLLubeGT predictions...|$|R

40|$|Circumferential grooves are {{machined}} {{into the}} rotor surface of liquid annular seals to reduce leakage. Analyses {{in the literature}} regarding rotordynamic coefficients for smooth stator/grooved rotor (SS/GR) seals are scarce, and measured results are absent despite the significant effect of these annular seals on pump rotordynamics. Furthermore, few annular seal test rigs can impose and measure pre-swirl. Consequently, this study aims to quantify the effect of pre-swirl and operating static eccentricity on measured static and dynamic characteristics of the SS/GR seal. The test seal has a nominal minimum radial clearance of Cr = 203. 2 ?m (8 mil) and the length-to-diameter ratio of L/D = 0. 5. The rotor surface has 15 square grooves with a depth of 1. 524 mm (60 mils). This geometry is based on measured dimensions in an Electrical Submersible Pump. The author conducts tests at speeds of 2, 4, 6, and 8 krpm, axial pressure drops of 2. 07, 4. 14, 6. 21, and 8. 27 bar (30, 60, 90, and 120 psi), and eccentricity ratios up to ? 0 = 0. 80. Pre-swirl is imposed and varied over low, medium, and high values. The lubricant is ISO VG 2 oil at 46. 1 ?C (115 ?F) to ensure turbulent flow at all operating conditions. Measured <b>grooved</b> <b>seal</b> results are compared to results of a smooth seal of equal length, diameter, and nominal clearance. Note that no published predictions for this seal exist, precluding measurement-versus-prediction comparisons. Static measurements include leakage rate, applied static load, eccentric position, pre-swirl ratio (PSR), and outlet swirl ratio (OSR). At 2 krpm and 8. 27 bar, the SS/GR seal leakage rate {{is lower than the}} smooth seal by a factor of 0. 7 for a total reduction of 19 LPM. However, at high speeds and low pressures, <b>grooved</b> <b>seal</b> leakage is 0. 8 to 0. 9 times that of the smooth seal with reductions in leakage rate on the order of 2 LPM. Consequently, adding rotor grooves to restrict leakage is more advantageous at high pressure drops and low speeds. Outlet swirl is measured {{for the first time in}} a liquid-annular-seal test rig. Contrary to expectation, measured OSR is generally lower than 0. 5, possibly due to the axial and radial location of the pitot tube within the outlet chamber. Dynamic measurements include rotor-stator relative displacement, stator acceleration, and applied dynamic excitations. The author calculates dynamic-stiffness values, rotordynamic coefficients, whirl frequency ratio, and effective damping. Most notable of the dynamic results is the negative direct stiffness of the SS/GR seal. Negative direct stiffness would have a detrimental effect on pump rotordynamics, lowering both the natural frequency and the onset speed of instability. Calculated whirl frequency ratio is generally high (? 0. 5) with values up to 1. 2 for the <b>grooved</b> <b>seal.</b> Finally, effective damping is lower for the <b>grooved</b> <b>seal</b> than the smooth seal indicating that the SS/GR seal has worse stability characteristics than a comparable SS/SR seal. Overall, increases in PSR have a detrimental effect on SS/GR seal rotordynamic performance leading to modest decreases in direct stiffness, increases in the magnitude of cross-coupled stiffness, and increases in whirl frequency ratio. Additionally, operation at high eccentricity ratios for the SS/GR seal has negative effects. Leakage increases, and direct stiffness decreases as eccentricity ratios approach 0. 80...|$|R
40|$|Reliability, {{life and}} vehicle pay load can be {{enhanced}} by improved seals on space vehicle propulsion systems. Development of two types of fluid-film seals for application to advanced LOX turbomachines are summarized. The first is a floating ring, helium buffered seal whose function is to exclude intrusion of liquid oxygen (LOX) into the turbine drive. The other is a spiral groove, LOX, face-type configuration designed to break down pressure and minimize leakage of LOX. The Rayleigh-step, floating ring gas seals require low clearances to minimize leakage and stiff films to assure tracking excursions of the rotor and to overcome Coulomb friction between the rings and housings. The design and test results of these buffer seals are described. Results indicate significant performance improvement over seals used on contemporary engines. The possibilities of reducing helium storage requirements and thus increasing payload appear promising. A unique configuration of spiral <b>groove</b> LOX <b>seal</b> was required to avoid detrimental vaporization in the flow path. It was found that fluid turbulence and inertia influence groove geometry and in particular groove depth must be much greater than spiral <b>groove</b> <b>seals</b> using conventional fluids...|$|R

The velocity contours are compared with experimental values. It shows good overall agreement of the axial, radial, and azimuthal velocities in the through-flow jet, shear layer, and recirculation zone. Quantitative comparisons of velocity profiles {{at the center of the}} groove are made to experiment. This study verifies the prediction accuracy of three turbulence models.

40|$|An {{analysis}} for helically-grooved turbulent annular seals is developed to predict leakage and dynamic coefficients, {{as related to}} rotordynamics. The grooved surface pattern is formulated as an inhomogeneous directivity in surface shear stress. The zeroth-order equations define the steady-state leakage and the circumferential velocity development due to wall shear for a centered rotor position.

40|$|The {{leakages}} and {{the dynamic}} characteristics of six types of spiral <b>grooved</b> <b>seals</b> are experimentally investigated. The {{effect of the}} helix angle of the seal is investigated mainly under {{the condition of the}} same nominal clearances, land and groove lengths, and groove depths. The dynamic characteristics are measured for various parameters such as preswirl velocity, pressure difference between inlet and outlet of the seal, whirling amplitude, whirling speed, and rotating speed of the rotor. The results are also compared with leakage increases with the increase of the helix angle, but as the rotating speed increases, the leakages of the larger helix angle seals quickly drop. The leakage of the smooth-stator (SS) /smooth-grooved rotor (SGR) seal drops faster than that of the spiral-grooved stator (SGS) /smooth-rotor (SR) seal. It is found that a circumferential flow can be produced by the flow along the helix angle direction, and this circumferential flow acts as a negative swirl. For the present helix angle range, there is an optimum helix angle with which the seal has a comparatively positive effect on the rotor stability. Compared with the SGS/SR seals, the SS/SGR seal has a worse effect on the rotor stability...|$|R

40|$|Scroll {{compressors}} {{are widely}} used in room air conditioning cycles, package air conditioning cycles, refrigeration, water heater and automobile air conditioning cycles as well as air compressors, helium compressors and vacuum pump. There are two main leakage paths in a compression chamber formed by a fixed scroll and an orbiting scroll. One is the leakage path through a radial clearance between the wraps of fixed and orbiting scroll. The leakage through the radial clearance is prevented by pressing the orbiting scroll radially against the fixed scroll by a mechanism such as a compliance mechanism. Oil inside the compression chamber also has the sealing effect and reduces the leakage through the radial clearance. Another leakage path is an axial clearance which is the clearance between a tip of the scroll wrap and a base plate. A tip seal {{is often used to}} prevent the leakage through the axial clearance. Although there have been many studies on the tip seal, the seal mechanism of the tip seal is not thoroughly clarified yet, and the influence of design parameters on efficiency of the tip seal is unclear. In addition, the relationship between the sealing effect and a frictional loss of the tip seal is also not validated well. In this study, a test apparatus which can evaluate the sealing effect and the frictional loss of the tip seal simultaneously is developed. The influence of several design parameters on the sealing effect and the frictional loss is examined with the test apparatus.
