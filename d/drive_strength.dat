To explain the observed effects, we develop a master equation for the microwave dressed charge states, including quasiparticle tunnelling. A bimodal behaviour of the frequency shift as a function of gate voltage can be used for sensitive charge detection. However, at weak drives, the charge sensitivity is significantly reduced by nonequilibrium quasiparticles, which induce transitions to a non-sensitive state. Unexpectedly, at high-enough drives, the quasiparticle tunnelling enables a very fast relaxation channel to the sensitive state. In this regime, the charge sensitivity is thus robust against externally injected quasiparticles and the desired dynamics prevail over a broad range of temperatures.

A set of standard cells are said to be footprint compatible when they are interchangeable from a place-and-route perspective without causing DRC errors.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Boston UniversityThis {{study is}} an {{investigation}} of certain interrelationships between hostility and learning. Learning {{is defined as a}} change in performance associated with practice and is discussed as an activity instigated and affected by drives. Hostility is used to designate a heightened activity level (drive state) in the direction of violence such as belligerency, cruelty, or destructiveness. 	For purposes of this study, hostile <b>drive</b> <b>strength</b> is defined by perceptual responses to ambiguous stimuli given by an individual. The general purpose of this investigation is to test the hypothesis that when there is high hostile <b>drive</b> <b>strength,</b> learning is inhibited with respect to stimuli connoting hostility. 	in an experimental study of learning rate and stimuli with hostile import, Williams found that the groups of individuals whose task it was to learn "hostile" words required significantly more serial learning trials to attain criterion than were needed to learn neutral words. This finding suggests that learning rate is related to stimuli connoting hostility. However, the connotation of hostility depends upon the reacting individual, and a more general question still requiring investigation is the influence of hostile <b>drive</b> <b>strength</b> on learning rate. 	The specific predictions tested in this investigation are: 	(1) Learning rate is negatively related to stimuli connoting hostility when hostile <b>drive</b> <b>strength</b> is held constant. 	(2) Learning rate is unrelated to hostile <b>drive</b> <b>strength</b> when stimuli are held constant. 	(3) Learning rate is negatively related to hostile <b>drive</b> <b>strength</b> in interaction with stimuli connoting hostility. 	Hostile <b>drive</b> <b>strength</b> is defined in this study by scores obtained by the Elizur method for analyzing hostile content of responses to the Rorschach test. These scores were obtained for over two hundred Rorschach test protocols from male college students who took the Rorschach test in class groups generally in accordance with the method of administration suggested by Hire. 	Variation in hostile <b>drive</b> <b>strength</b> was accomplished by the selection of two groups of subjects. The high hostile <b>drive</b> <b>strength</b> group was selected from among those whose hostility scores were above the median of the two hundred protocols. Similarly, the low hostile <b>drive</b> <b>strength</b> group was selected from those scoring at the median and below. The two groups of sixteen each were similar with respect to age, education, intelligence scores, and college grades. One might characterize the typical member of either group as a twenty-two year old male who has completed three years of college with an average grade of C. 	With respect to the Rorschach test hostility scores, which were the basic selection criterion, the following conclusions were supported: 	(1) The hostility score is unrelated to the number of test responses elicited. 	(2) The high and low <b>drive</b> <b>strength</b> groups do not differ in Rorschach test response productivity. 	(3) In a test-retest analysis of twenty Rorschach test protocols obtained at an interval of approximately one year, the consistency of hostile <b>drive</b> <b>strength</b> classification is significantly greater than chance. 	(4) A rank-difference correlation of. 96 between two scores' independent ratings of the hostility scores on ten randomly-selected Rorschach test protocols supports the reproducibility of the scoring method. 	Learning in this study was accomplished by the serial-anticipation method, often referred to as serial learning. Three twelve 0 word lists were constructed, consisting of a practice list, a "Hostile List," and a "Non-Hostile List. " All words were chosen from Haagen's list of four hundred two-syllable adjectives scaled in terms of meaningfulness, association value, familiarity, and vividness. A group of psychologists were given selected adjectives and asked to choose those having hostile connotations. A word was considered to have hostile connotations when a majority of the psychologists so judged that particular word. 	Each subject was seen by the writer on two occasion. On the first, the subject took the group Rorschach test. On the second, which took approximately one hour, the subjects learned the three lists of words. All subjects were presented the practice list first. To control for possible serial effects of practice with the experimental lists, the latter were presented in ABBA order. Standard instructions were issued, and the study was referred to as a memorizing experiment. The learning criterion was the number of trials required to attain one perfect performance on each list. 	Results in terms of mean trials to learn to criterion were as follows for the high hostile <b>drive</b> <b>strength</b> group: 8. 8 trials on the "Non-Hostile List" and 13. 1 trials on the "Hostile List. " For the low hostile <b>drive</b> <b>strength</b> group, results were: 9. 9 trials on the "Non-Hostile List" and 10. 4 trials on the "Hostile List. " 	The first prediction stated that learning rate is negatively related to stimuli connoting hostility when hostile <b>drive</b> <b>strength</b> is held constant. On the basis of an analysis of variance, the appropriate null hypothesis was rejected at the. 001 level of significance, thus supporting the first prediction. The second prediction stated that learning rate is unrelated to hostile <b>drive</b> <b>strength</b> when stimuli are held constant. In the appropriate null form, the second hypothesis could not be rejected. The third prediction stated that learning rate is negatively related to hostile <b>drive</b> <b>strength</b> in interaction with stimuli connoting hostility. On the basis of an analysis of variance, the appropriate null hypothesis was rejected at the. 01 level of significance, thus supporting the third prediction. Thus, all three predictions of the study are supported. 	the results with respect to the first prediction are consistent with Williams's findings. However, any formulation of these confirmed findings must also take into consideration the results with respect to the third prediction of this study. 	A suggested formulation of the findings holds that the individual with hostile impulses, i. e., high hostile <b>drive</b> <b>strength,</b> who is motivated to learn but who is confronted with symbols associated with feelings consonant with his own unacceptable drives, is precipitated into a conflict situation, since action based on these drives would be socially unacceptable. The resultant inhibition of behavior, a frequently observed reaction of individuals in conflict situations, is reflected in inhibition of learning activity. Implications for further study within the concept of hostility are discussed...|$|E

In this paper, the difference of rise and fall slew is presented as another process-variation metric along with the delay in determining the relative mismatch between the <b>drive</b> <b>strengths</b> of nMOS and pMOS devices. The importance of considering both of these metrics is illustrated, and a new slew-rate monitoring circuit is presented for measuring the difference of rise and fall slew of a signal on the critical path of a circuit.

In both regimes, inelastic scattering induced by the ac drive can excite quasi-bound states in the channel that leads to resonance promotion of higher order sidebands.

Moreover, emerging devices such as heterojunction tunneling FETs are more amenable to vertical fabrication. However, past studies of vertical channel devices focused more on regular memory architectures and simple standard cells like inverter. Since naive migration of regular FinFET layouts to vertical FETs yields little benefits, we identify several vertical efficient layout structures and propose novel layout generation heuristics for vertical channel devices. We also compare VGAA with symmetric and asymmetric source/drain architectures. The layout efficiencies of several VGAA structures, vertical double gate (VDG), lateral gate-all-around (LGAA), and FinFET are presented in our experiments. We observe that even though most vertical channel standard cells have more diffusion gaps than lateral cells do, they still benefit from vertical architectures in area because of the elimination of diffusion contacts. For asymmetric architectures, the area is larger than symmetric architectures because of the extra diffusion gaps needed, but our experiments indicate that for both symmetric and asymmetric architectures, vertical channel devices are likely to have a density advantage over lateral channel devices assuming that current <b>drive</b> <b>strengths</b> of both are similar.
