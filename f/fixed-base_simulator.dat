25|$|Twelve {{seconds before}} the plane hit the mountain, named El Diluvio (The Deluge), the Ground Proximity Warning System activated, announcing an {{imminent}} terrain collision and sounding an alarm. Within a second of this warning the first officer disengaged the autopilot, and the captain attempted to climb clear of the mountain; however, neither pilot had remembered to disengage the previously deployed speed brakes, which reduced the rate of climb. At 9:41:28 pm Eastern Standard Time it struck trees at about 8,900 feet MSL {{on the east side}} of the mountain. The crash was six miles south of Tuluá VOR and 28 miles north of the approach end of runway 19 at Alfonso Bonilla Aragon International Airport. During the investigations, it was found that neither the Boeing <b>fixed-base</b> <b>simulator</b> nor the CDU/FMS simulator could be backdriven with the data obtained directly from the accident airplane's flight data recorder. Because the B-757 flight simulators could not be backdriven during the tests, it could not be determined with precision whether the airplane would have missed the mountain/tree tops if the speedbrakes had been retracted during the escape attempt. However, the final report stated that if the flightcrew had retracted the speedbrakes one second after initiating the escape maneuver, the airplane could have been climbing through a position that was 150 feet above the initial impact point. Because the airplane would have continued to climb and had the potential to increase its rate of climb, it might well have cleared the trees at the top of the mountain.|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} a <b>fixed-base</b> <b>simulator</b> study {{of the effects of}} {{variable}} longitudinal control-system dynamics on pilot opinion are presented and compared with flight-test data. The control-system variables considered in this investigation included stick force per g, time constant, and dead-band, or stabilizer breakout force. In general, the fairly good correlation between flight and simulator results for two pilots demonstrates the validity of <b>fixed-base</b> <b>simulator</b> studies which are designed to complement and supplement flight studies and serve as a guide in control-system preliminary design. However, in the investigation of certain problem areas (e. g., sensitive control-system configurations associated with pilot- induced oscillations in flight), <b>fixed-base</b> <b>simulator</b> results did not predict the occurrence of an instability, although the pilots noted the system was extremely sensitive and unsatisfactory. If it is desired to predict pilot-induced-oscillation tendencies, tests in moving-base simulators may be required. It was found possible to represent the human pilot by a linear pilot analog for the tracking task assumed in the present study. The criterion used to adjust the pilot analog was the root-mean-square tracking error of one of the human pilots on the <b>fixed-base</b> <b>simulator.</b> Matching the tracking error of the pilot analog to that of the human pilot gave an approximation to the variation of human-pilot behavior over a range of control-system dynamics. Results of the pilot-analog study indicated that both for optimized control-system dynamics (for poor airplane dynamics) and for a region of good airplane dynamics, the pilot response characteristics are approximately the same...|$|E
40|$|The main aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} a selection of commonly used performance indicators (PIs) that have been reported to be sensitive to distraction and workload. More specifically, the PIs were tested for their ability to differentiate between task modalities (visual, cognitive and haptic) and task difficulty (easy, medium and hard). It was investigated whether possible differences were constant across two traffic situations (with/without lead vehicle) and two driving simulators. The experiment was conducted in the VTI Driving Simulator III, an advanced moving-base simulator, and in the Volvo Car Corporation driving simulator, an advanced <b>fixed-base</b> <b>simulator.</b> Both simulators were equipped with Smart Eye Pro eye tracking systems. A visual, a cognitive and a haptic secondary task were chosen to test the ability of the PIs to distinguish between the tasks’ loading on different modalities. Some of the main results from the study were: There were only minor differences between the two simulators for driving behaviour as described by longitudinal PIs. There was no overall offset, and the main difference was that the visual task led to stronger speed reductions in the moving-base simulator, which influenced both the mean speed and the speeding index. Regarding lateral PIs, major differences between the two simulators were found, both as a general offset and for those factor combinations that include modality and task difficulty level. With the visual or the haptic task active, the drivers positioned themselves further to the left and the variation in lateral position was higher in the <b>fixed-base</b> <b>simulator.</b> The number of lane crossings did not differ considerably between the simulators, but the lane departure area was larger on average in the <b>fixed-base</b> <b>simulator,</b> again influenced by modality, with the largest lane departure areas for the visual task, and in the case of the <b>fixed-base</b> <b>simulator</b> for the haptic task as well. Most of the eye movement related PIs had a general offset between the simulators. The drivers in the <b>fixed-base</b> <b>simulator</b> accumulated more time with their eyes off the road, especially during the visual and the cognitive tasks, while the drivers in the moving-base simulator cast longer single glances at the display...|$|E

5000|$|Though human-piloted {{aviation}} {{has existed}} {{since the early}} 20th century, simulator sickness did not arise as an issue for pilots until much later when the first <b>fixed-base</b> <b>simulators</b> were created. Bell Aircraft Corporation created a helicopter simulator for the Navy during the 1950s, and it was found [...] "that {{a large number of}} observers (mostly helicopter pilots) experienced some degree of vertigo during these demonstrations". Navy psychologists performed further study on the pilots who participated in these simulator exercises, and found that 28 out of 36 respondents to their evaluations experienced sickness. Additionally, psychologists found that experienced flight instructors seemed to be most susceptible. In fact, 60% of the instructors reported simulator sickness symptoms compared to only 12% of the students.

30|$|Although {{there are}} {{significant}} differences, driving simulation has followed progress in flight simulation. Like flying, driving is a dynamic task that involves a set of rapid control maneuvers and critical feedback {{in order to avoid}} obstacles and prevent crashes [19]. However, compared to airline pilots, driving involves higher amplitude and higher frequency cues. Motion feedback does not {{play a key role in}} most of the slow maneuvers performed by civilian pilots. In fact, there is no evidence that motion-based simulators are more efficient than <b>fixed-base</b> <b>simulators</b> for training commercial pilots [7]. This highlights the stark contrast between driving simulation and civil aviation flight simulation; compared to an airline pilot, the driver needs a higher degree of motion simulation. The higher complexity inherent in the driving task probably explains why flight simulators are widely used for pilot training, while driving simulators are not widely used for driver training [31].|$|R

Pertinent literature from the past two decades is reviewed. The paper observes that no definitive conclusion can be drawn that would warrant modification of current qualification requirements for platform motion in full flight simulators.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to examine how long it takes for older drivers to adapt their steering control on a <b>fixed-base</b> driving <b>simulator.</b> We hypothesized that older drivers achieve maximum training benefit within the first few minutes of a driving simulation. Thirteen drivers over 65 years of age drove a four-channel, 150 º forward field-ofview, 50 º rear field-of-view, <b>fixed-base</b> driving <b>simulator</b> for 25 minutes. We used a six-degree steering wheel reversal criterion to evaluate drivers’ adaptation to the simulator. Since drivers’ adapt to a simulator over time, we examined the number of steering wheel reversals greater than six degrees that occurred per minute during each of three sections, the start, middle and end of the 25 -minute drive. The results showed that older drivers needed about three minutes to adapt and get the “feel” of the simulator. Before this time driving behavior in the simulator may not be representative of actual driving performance. These results provide preliminary support for assuming that an adaptation period as short as five minutes may enable drivers to adapt to the driving simulator and drive normally...|$|R

All subjects were tested in the morning so as to avoid systematic effects of fatigue. The participants were first given a short (3 to 4  min) run on the practice drive (the beginning portion had S-curves, which can expose drivers prone to simulation sickness) in the driving simulator to ensure that the driver was not prone to simulation sickness syndrome. Nausea, disorientation and ocular problems such as eyestrain, blurred vision and eye fatigue have been reported as some of the indicators of simulation sickness in <b>fixed-base</b> <b>simulators</b> [27, 32]. If a participant experienced the syndrome, the practice drive was immediately terminated and the participant was deemed unfit to take the simulation drive. If a participant did not feel any discomfort in the practice drive, then the rest of the protocol followed. The sample of drivers was tested over a period of 3  months. The annual road mileage of participants was not considered as most drivers (especially older drivers) confessed to its inaccuracy. This inaccurate reporting of annual mileage by older drivers may have been consciously reported because of its roots in the low-mileage bias phenomena [26].|$|R
