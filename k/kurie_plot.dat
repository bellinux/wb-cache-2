50|$|A <b>Kurie</b> <b>plot</b> (also {{known as}} a Fermi-Kurie plot) is a graph used in {{studying}} beta decay developed by Franz N. D. Kurie, in which the square root {{of the number of}} beta particles whose momenta (or energy) lie within a certain narrow range, divided by the Fermi function, is plotted against beta-particle energy. It is a straight line for allowed transitions and some forbidden transitions, in accord with the Fermi beta-decay theory. The energy-axis (x-axis) intercept of a <b>Kurie</b> <b>plot</b> corresponds to the maximum energy imparted to the electron/positron (the decay's -value). With a <b>Kurie</b> <b>plot</b> one can find the limit on the effective mass of a neutrino.|$|E
40|$|The planned rhenium beta-decay {{experiment}} MARE might {{probe the}} absolute mass scale of neutrinos {{with the same}} sensitivity as the tritium beta-decay experiment KATRIN, which will start data taking in 2011 and will proceed for five years. We present the energy distribution of emitted electrons for the first unique forbidden beta-decay of 187 Re. It is found that the p-wave emission of electron dominates over the s-wave. By assuming mixing of three neutrinos the Kurie function for the rhenium beta-decay is derived. It is shown that the <b>Kurie</b> <b>plot</b> near the endpoint is within a good accuracy linear {{in the limit of}} massless neutrinos like the <b>Kurie</b> <b>plot</b> of the superallowed beta-decay of 3 H.

The maximum {{energy of the}} 14. 3 -day beta activity, as determined from several <b>Kurie</b> <b>plots,</b> {{was found to be}} 1. 704 +/- 0. 008 Mev. The <b>Kurie</b> <b>plots</b> gave excellent straight lines from the maximum beta-energy to about 0. 26 Mev. In phosphorus samples prepared from neutron irradiated sulfur an additional beta-activity was observed having a maximum energy of 0. 26 +/- 0. 02 Mev and a half-life of 24. 8 +/- 0. 5 days. This low-energy beta-group was also observed in phosphorus samples prepared from sulfur and lithium chloride irradiated with X-rays having a maximum energy of 68 Mev. The low-energy beta-group was not observed in phosphorus samples prepared from sulfur irradiated with deuterons or phosphorus irradiated with neutrons.

40|$|High {{statistics}} calorimetric {{measurements of}} the beta spectrum of 187 Re are being performed with arrays of silver perrhenate crystals operated at low temperature. After a modification of the experimental set-up, which allowed to substantially reduce the background of spurious counts and therefore to increase the sensitivity on the electron antineutrino mass, a new measurement with 10 silver perrhenate microbolometers is running since July 2002. The crystals have masses between 250 and 350 micrograms and their average FWHM energy resolution, constantly monitored by means of fluorescence X-rays, is of 28. 3 eV at the beta end-point. The <b>Kurie</b> <b>plot</b> collected during 4485 hours x mg effective running time has an end-point energy of 2466. 1 +/- 0. 8 {stat} +/- 1. 5 {syst} eV, while the half lifetime of the decay {{is found to be}} 43. 2 +/- 0. 2 {stat} +/- 0. 1 {syst} Gy. These values are the most precise obtained so far for 187 Re. From the fit of the <b>Kurie</b> <b>plot</b> we can deduce a value for the squared electron antineutrino mass m(nu) ^ 2 of 147 +/- 237 {stat} +/- 90 {syst} eV^ 2. The corresponding 90 % C.

40|$|Specific {{class of}} textures for the Dirac and Majorana mass {{matrices}} in the seesaw model {{leading to a}} pair of almost degenerate neutrinos is discussed. These textures can be obtained by imposing a horizontal U(1) symmetry. A specific model is discussed in which: (1) All three neutrino masses are similar in magnitude and could lie around eV providing hot component of the dark matter in the universe. (2) Two of these are highly degenerate and their (mass) ^ 2 difference could solve the solar neutrino problem through large angle MSW solution.

40|$|An {{experiment}} is proposed {{to test the}} theory recently advanced by Feynman and Gell-Mann on the vector interaction in β decay. According to the theory, the Fermi coupling constant is not appreciably altered by renormalization, in agreement with experiment. A further property of the theory is exploited here, that analogous γ and β transitions in light nuclei have proportional matrix elements, {{as far as the}} V interaction is concerned. In particular, the V interaction gives rise to "weak magnetism" analogous to the magnetic effects that induce the emission of M 1 photons. This "weak magnetism" obeys Gamow-Teller selection rules and interferes with the A coupling, distorting the spectra of high-energy β transitions with ΔJ= 1 (no). It is suggested that the β spectra of B 12 and N 12 be measured accurately and compared. Departure from linearity of the <b>Kurie</b> <b>plot</b> should be noticed in each case; the ratio of the spectra can be calculated with confidence {{on the basis of the}} theory, which predicts a 20...|$|E
40|$|Thulium, in {{the form}} of Tm 203, has been made {{radioactive}} by neutron irradiation In a pile. The radiations have been investigated by a magnetic beta-spectrometer and by absorption methods. A conversion line is found at an energy of 0. 0682 +/-. 0011 Mev. and indicates a gamma ray of 0. 129 +/-. 003 Mev. The beta spectrum is found to be complex {{as the result of a}} <b>Kurie</b> <b>plot</b> with apparently three components whose end points are 0. 953 +/-. 020 Mev., O. 526 +/-. 020 Mev., and 0. 30 U +/-. 020 Mev. The intensities are, respectively, 74 %, 18 %, and 8 % as Judged by the graphical integration of the areas under the components. The existence of these components and the values of the end points are subject to confirmation by gamma ray and coincidence measurements. As the result of absorption measurements of the gamma rays in lead it is believed that the gamma radiation consists of three components with energies about 0. 1 Mev., 0. 2 Mev. and 0. 8 Mev. respectively.

40|$|The beta and gamma {{spectra of}} 6. 9 day lutecium have been {{measured}} using a thin lens spectrometer. Gamma rays of average energies 112. 2 ± 0. 6 kev., 206. 3 ± 1. 0 kev., and 317 - 3 ± 1. 5 kev., have been found, the former two of comparable intensity {{and the latter}} much weaker. Characteristic X-radiation from Hf has also been observed. These energies are computed from four conversion lines on the beta spectrum at 46. 9 ± 0. 5 kev., 101. 8 ± 0. 6 kev., 109. 9 ± 0. 6 kev., and 141. 4 ± 0. 8 kev., {{as well as from}} photoelectron lines using lead, gold, and tin radiators. Beta end points based on a <b>Kurie</b> <b>plot</b> occur at l 69 ± 10 kev., 366 ± 25 kev., and 495 ± 5 kev. A decay scheme is proposed consistent with these results. The great importance of avoiding source charging has been demonstrated by shifts of the conversion lines up to 20 kev. when a source mounting of thin nylon was used.

40|$|Journals {{published}} by the American Physical Society {{can be found at}} [URL] ground-state Gamow-Teller transition in the decay of O- 14 is strongly hindered and the electron spectrum shape deviates markedly from the allowed shape. A reanalysis of the only available data on this spectrum changes the branching ratio assigned to this transition by seven standard deviations: Our new result is (0. 54 +/- 0. 02) %. The <b>Kurie</b> <b>plot</b> data from two earlier publications are also examined, and a revision to their published branching ratios is recommended. The required nuclear matrix elements are calculated with the shell model, and, for the first time, consistency is obtained between the M 1 matrix element deduced from the analog gamma transition in N- 14 and that deduced from the slope in the shape-correction function in the beta transition, a requirement of the conserved-vector current hypothesis. This consistency is obtained, however, only if renormalized rather than free-nucleon operators are used in the shell-model calculations. In the mirror decay of C- 14, a similar situation occurs. Consistency among the C- 14 lifetime, the slope of the shape-correction function, and the M 1 matrix element from gamma decay can be achieved only with renormalized operators in the shell-model calculation...|$|E
40|$|An {{exhaustive}} {{study has}} been made of the β spectrum of 35 S, recorded with a Si(Li) detector. The object was to identify the origin of a distortion in the 35 S β spectrum some 17 keV below the end point, reported over three years ago and interpreted then as evidence for a 17 keV neutrino. Measurements with different source-detector spacings and with varied collimation have shown that there is a long range curvature in the <b>Kurie</b> <b>plot</b> which is a sensitive function of configuration, but the principal origin of the distortion is energy loss in the 35 S sources. The 35 S sources, prepared by chemical adsorption of Ba 35 SO 4 on a gold substrate, are clumped and locally thick. Electrons near the end point lose ∼ 0. 3 keV in the source material and if this is taken into account the spectra are well fitted without any admixture of 17 keV neutrino. The source thickness has been investigated with a proton microprobe and determined from both source tilting and the yield of barium K X-rays; these studies are discussed in detail. The uncertainties in and justification for the form of the electron response function employed are also thoroughly discussed. If there is no systematic error common to the majority of 14 independent sets of 35 S data, the admixture of 17 keV neutrino is < 10 - 3 (95 % CL). A simple search for a kink at 150 keV in the combined data from all 14 runs yielded a limit of 1. 8 × 10 - 3 (95 % CL). The end point of the 35 S β spectrum is found to be 167. 60 ± 0. 05 keV. © 1995 Springer-Verlag...|$|E
40|$|A beta spectrometer, {{consisting}} of a liquid scintillation counter, coupled to a programmable multichannel analyser was used {{to achieve the objective}} of detecting and measuring beta activity in low level aqueous environmental solution as well as identifying the radioisotopes present. Aqueous solutions of standard beta emitters, covering a range of energies between 18. 6 KeV and 3550 KeV, were used to develop computer methods for analysis. The best proportions of the counting cocktail was found consist of 4. 0 ml of aqueous sample, 3. 0 ml of Triton X- 100 and 3. 0 ml of toluene containing 4. 0 g per litre PRO and 0. 4 g per litre POPOP. The effects of pH, acids, bases, buffers, and salts on the stability of the mixture and on the detection efficiency of the radioisotopes, were investigated and found not to be severe. Pretreatment of the sample was not required. It was found that temperature changes, beyond the operating temperature range, could result severe errors. 1024 channels of aquisition area, for the collection of the spectra, give good conditions for computer analysis. End channel and channel number of maximum count calibration gave a linear relationship to the Em, of standard beta emitters. It was found that the theoretical fitting of the spectra is possible and the normalisation ratio V of the theoretical to the experimental fitting procedure has alinear relationship to the activity of emitter. <b>Kurie</b> <b>plot</b> was applied for checking the Emav value of the emitters used. Application of the Cerenkov counting technique for beta emitters, gives extra data to support the main results. For the analysis of environmental solutions, which may contain a variety of radioisotopes, the system was used to obtain spectra of alpha emitters, beta emitters with internal conversion and Cerenkov radiation. Synthetic mixtures of tritium and carbon- 14 of activity ratios between 8 : 1 and 1 : 8 were used to investigate the problems of multielement spectral analysis...|$|E
40|$|We {{show in a}} model {{independent}} manner that, if the magnitudes of Majorana {{masses of}} neutrinos are exactly equal at some high scale, the radiative corrections cannot reproduce the observed masses and mixing spectrum at the low scale, irrespective of the Majorana phases or the mixing angles at the high scale. The data from the solar and atmospheric neutrino experiments can be explained through the mixing of three active neutrinos with nonzero masses. The atmospheric neutrino solution needs νµ−ντ mixing with the corresponding mass squared difference of ∆m 2 atm ≈ 10 − 3 − 10 − 2 eV 2, and a large mixing angle, sin 2 2 θatm> 0. 8 [1]. The solar neutrino solution needs the mixing of νe {{with a combination of}} νµ and ντ with a corresponding mass squared difference ∆m 2 ⊙ > ∆m 2 ⊙, there are three distinct patterns for the neutrino masses {{from the point of view}} of mass hierarchy. We define the mass eigenstate ν 3 as the one such that |∆m 2 31 | ≈ |∆m 232 | ≈ ∆m 2 atm, and the states ν 1 and ν 2 as the ones separated by |∆m 2 21 | ≈ ∆m 2 ⊙, with ∆m 231 and ∆m 221 having the same sign (here ∆m 2 ij ≡ |mi | 2 − |mj | 2). With this convention, the possible patterns for the neutrino masses are (i) completely hierarchical: |m 1 | ≪ |m 2 | ≪ |m 3 |, (ii) partially degenerate: |m 1 | ∼ |m 2 | ≫ |m 3 |, also called as inverted hierarchy or (iii) completely degenerate: |m 1 | ∼ |m 2 | ∼ |m 3 |. In contrast to the first two cases, the common mass in the third case can be near the direct limit on the electron neutrino mass as obtained from the <b>Kurie</b> <b>plot</b> [3]. Such a mass can have its own signature in the neutrinoless double beta decay [4]. In order for the neutrinos to contribute even a small fraction of the dark matter [5] of the universe, degenerate neutrino masses are essential...|$|E
