25|$|In the Christian {{tradition}} of European cultures, where ecclesiastical sanction authenticates monarchic power, {{when a new}} monarch assumes the throne in a coronation ceremony, the crown {{is placed on the}} new monarch's head by a religious official. Some, though not all early Holy Roman Emperors travelled to Rome {{at some point in their}} careers to be crowned by the pope. Napoleon, according to legend, surprised Pius VII when <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> crowned himself, although in reality this order of ceremony had been pre-arranged (see coronation).|$|E

60|$|<b>He</b> <b>reached</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> {{folded her}} in an embrace which would have aroused the {{professional}} enthusiasm of Hackenschmidt and drawn guttural congratulations from Zbysco. She creaked, but did not crack, beneath the strain.|$|E
6000|$|... "My reward," [...] said Powers, and as {{he spoke}} <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> clasped both of the girl's hands in his own, [...] "yes, my reward. May I come and claim it here?" ...|$|E
60|$|The captain breathed {{hard for}} a moment. <b>He</b> <b>reached</b> <b>out</b> far <b>and</b> wide to find any {{coherency}} in these remarks; then, with a great effort, changed the subject.|$|R
60|$|A {{singular}} look, quite {{unlike the}} habitual placid, good-humoured {{expression of the}} man, crossed Gabriel's face as <b>he</b> quietly <b>reached</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> took the paper from Olly's hand.|$|R
5000|$|Kool G Rap on Collaboration Origin:“Necro was <b>reaching</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> then <b>he</b> finally <b>reached</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> {{connected}} with somebody in my camp {{and me and}} Necro had a meeting, {{we sat down and}} we talked and we agreed on doing this project." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>reached</b> <b>out,</b> <b>and,</b> to the girl's surprise, {{took up a}} bowl {{from the}} table, and {{appeared}} to weigh it in his hands. It {{was made of the}} indurated fibre which is frequently to be met with in the Bush ranches.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't apologise to me!" [...] said Eustace. [...] "My {{poor old}} chap, my only feeling towards you {{is one of}} the purest and profoundest pity." [...] <b>He</b> <b>reached</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> pressed Sam's hand. [...] "I regard you as a toad beneath the harrow!" ...|$|E
60|$|But he was {{blinded by}} water and mud {{as well as}} by rage; and the oldest Rover boy easily evaded the new onslaught. Then, of a sudden, <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> caught Martell by both wrists and held him in a vise-like grasp.|$|E

He tells her that she must give in to him, or else he will kill her. He also threatens to cause her dishonor by murdering a slave and placing the two bodies in each other’s arms, {{and then he would}} claim that he killed her because he {{discovered}} them in this embrace. If she would give in to him, Tarquin promises to keep it all secret. Lucrece pleads with him to no avail. He rapes her.|$|R
60|$|Eddie {{tried to}} smile as he {{looked up into the}} other's face. <b>He</b> <b>reached</b> a hand <b>out</b> <b>and</b> laid it on Billy's arm.|$|R
60|$|The bishop ran {{a hundred}} yards or more before he found a place at which a boat could be beached. It {{was not a very}} good place, but if <b>he</b> could <b>reach</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> seize the bow, that would be enough for him. He was strong enough to pull that boat over a paved street.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, I never plague anybody," [...] murmured Tom, {{with a look}} {{of injured}} innocence on his round face. <b>He</b> <b>reached</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> caught some snow from a nearby bush. [...] "Say, Jack, what is that on the horse's hind foot?" [...] he went on.|$|E
60|$|So {{once more}} he {{scrambled}} {{down from the}} pile of corn and little by little drew nearer to the two queer things. The nearer he got, the more harmless they looked. Finally <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> smelled of the smallest. Then he turned up his nose.|$|E
60|$|The {{boys were}} {{seated on the}} rear deck, talking over matters in general, when a strong puff of wind caused {{a sheet of paper}} to blow from somewhere ahead towards Dave. <b>He</b> <b>reached</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> caught the sheet just as it was about to go overboard.|$|E

Subsequently, the camcorder is found floating in water by a fifth individual who herself and another film each other on a boat cruise and later in a nightclub where Harris is performing as a DJ.

Scenes of the music video flash back in rapid succession, leading to {{the ending of the}} video with Harris setting the camera down and getting into bed with Goulding in the same bedroom as {{at the beginning of the}} video.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now Mr. Panther {{had never}} tried bark, {{but he thought}} to himself that if it made Mr. Porcupine so fat it must be good. He would try the piece of bark first and eat Mr. Porcupine afterward. So <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> snapped up the strip of bark.|$|E
60|$|She {{thought the}} voice familiar, {{but could not}} place it, though her heart whispered that it might belong to the young {{stranger}} of her dreams. <b>He</b> <b>reached</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> {{took her hand and}} together they turned and walked quickly toward the jungle, followed by the two who had accompanied him.|$|E
60|$|The {{smoke from}} above was now settling, and this caused many to cough, while it made seeing more {{difficult}} than ever.

60|$|It is true I {{held the}} cudgel, {{but what could}} I do with it against his four great arms?

60|$|<b>He</b> <b>reached</b> <b>out</b> his hand, <b>and,</b> unseen, {{slipped his}} razor-case into his pocket. 'I cannot stay here,' he thought, 'I must go down!' Without {{a word he}} left the room, {{and went back to}} the lawn.|$|R
2500|$|Their {{journey is}} {{interrupted}} when their steam-powered vessel is waylaid by the outlaw petrol-powered motorcycle gang, the Black Avengers. Jaggar, however, senses {{that these men}} may be of use to his cause and challenges their leader, Stag Stopa. The rules of the Black Avengers only allow a member to challenge the leader, and so he and Bogel are taken back to their headquarters for Feric to be initiated. Feric acquits himself mainly in the drinking of ale and in running the gauntlet of torches on a motorcycle. He and Stopa duel with truncheons, and Feric's truncheon breaks. Desperately <b>he</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> defeats Stopa with the legendary [...] "Great Truncheon of Stag Held"—which can only be wielded by a descendant of the last true King of Heldon, Sigmark IV. The Black Avengers immediately pledge fealty to him, and become the [...] "Knights of the Swastika".|$|R

60|$|Eliphalet had ambition, {{which is}} not a wholly {{undesirable}} quality. He began to wonder how it would feel to own a few of these valuable fellow-creatures. <b>He</b> <b>reached</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> touched lightly a young mulatto woman who sat beside him with an infant in her arms. The peculiar dumb expression on her face was lost on Eliphalet. The overseer had laughed coarsely.|$|E
6000|$|A sudden light {{sprang to}} the man's eyes as <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> <b>out</b> a hand <b>and</b> grasped the girl's fingers. [...] "Do you care a little now?" [...] he asked. [...] "Can't {{you tell me}} that you do--just a bit?" ...|$|R

After being freed by her allies, Semirhage is given a Domination Band, an item used to control male channelers, and locks it around Rand's neck. She and Black Ajah sister Elza Penfell use it to make him torture and attempt to kill his lover, Min Farshaw.

5000|$|Conn {{provided}} {{details about}} the film in the Spring 1957 issue of their magazine, The Baton, distributed to public school music teachers: [...] "Mr. B Natural is the spirit of music in everyone...a sort of LepreCONN who is always {{no more than an}} inch away from the fingertips of anyone. Mr. B has a code however, that prohibits him from showing himself for anyone unless <b>he</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> calls for the spirit of music. In full color, Mr. B Natural entertainingly answers the call of Buzz, a shy, reticent teen-ager and for twenty-six minutes and forty seconds explains how music and playing a musical instrument will help develop posture, breathing, self-confidence, coordination and in general a young person's character. Mr. B gives both youthful and adult audiences ease to take instruction in the values of music. The Film is being made available by the Band Instrument Division of Conn through Conn dealers everywhere." ...|$|R
