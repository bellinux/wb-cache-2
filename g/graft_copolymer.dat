5000|$|Branched chain: A chain with at leastone {{branch point}} {{intermediate}} between theboundary units.

50|$|Reactive compatibilization is a {{procedure}} in which immiscible polymer blends are compatibilized by creating copolymers in the solution or melt state. Copolymers are formed when the proper functional groups in each {{component of the}} immiscible blend interact in the compatibilization process. These interactions include hydrogen, ionic or covalent bonding. The functional groups that cause these interactions can be the end groups that are already present in the blend polymers (e.g., carboxylic acids or alcohols on polyesters, or amine groups on nylons). Another approach is to add functional groups to the component chains by grafting. The many possible functional groups allow for many types of commercial polymer blends, including polyamide/polyalkene blend systems. There {{are a number of}} advantages reactive compatibilization has over using the traditional block or <b>graft</b> <b>copolymer</b> as the compatibilizing agent. Unlike the latter approach, reactive compatibilization does not rely on diffusing pre-formed copolymers. Copolymers form at the interfaces of the two immiscible blends and {{do not need to be}} dispersed. In the traditional approach the system needs to be well mixed when adding the copolymers. Reactive compatibilization is also much more efficient than traditional compatibilization. This is because in reactive compatibilization, functional groups are either already present, or easily grafted on the blend components. In the traditional compatibilization, copolymers must be synthesized on a case by case basis for the components to blend.|$|E

Better flocculation efficacies of <b>grafted</b> <b>copolymers</b> are due to their structural differences.

50|$|A {{process for}} {{inducing}} regeneration in skin {{was invented by}} Dr. Ioannis V. Yannas (then Assistant Professor in the Fibers and Polymers Division, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge MA) and Dr. John F. Burke (then Chief of Staff, Shriners Burns Institute, Boston MA). Their initial objective was to discover a wound cover that would protect severe skin wounds from infection by accelerating wound closure. Several kinds of grafts made of synthetic and natural polymers were prepared and tested in a guinea pig animal model. By late 1970s {{it was evident that}} the original objective was not reached. Instead, these experimental grafts typically did not affect the speed of wound closure. In one case, however, a particular type of collagen graft led to significant delay of wound closure. Careful study of histology samples revealed that grafts that delayed wound closure induced the synthesis of new dermis de novo at the injury site, instead of forming scar, which is the normal outcome of the spontaneous wound healing response. This was the first demonstration of regeneration of a tissue (dermis) that does not regenerate by itself in the adult mammal. After the initial discovery, further research led to the composition and fabrication of grafts that were evaluated in clinical trials. These grafts were synthesized as a <b>graft</b> <b>copolymer</b> of microfibrillar type I collagen and a glycosaminoglycan, chondroitin-6-sulfate, fabricated into porous sheets by freeze-drying, and then cross-linked by dehydrothermal treatment. Control of the structural features of the collagen scaffold (average pore size, degradation rate and surface chemistry) was eventually found to be a critical prerequisite for its unusual biological activity.|$|E
