The 2017 Breeders' Cup Classic was help on November 4 at Del Mar Racetrack. Going into the race, handicappers were divided over who was the best horse in North America. Arrogate's victory in the Dubai World Cup over Gun Runner had been ranked as the best performance of the year up to that point, but Arrogate had suffered two losses after returning to the United States. By contrast, Gun Runner had won three straight Grade I races and appeared to be <b>getting</b> <b>stronger.</b> Gun Runner was made the 9-5 morning-line favorite over Arrogate at 2-1 in a top quality field of eleven. By post time, the odds on Gun Runner had drifted out slightly to 2.4-1, making him the second betting choice. Collected, who had beaten Arrogate in the Pacific Classic earlier in the year, was the third choice.|$|E

25|$|Jean-Baptiste Lamarck had {{originally}} proposed a theory on the transmutation {{of species that}} was largely based on a progressive drive toward greater complexity. Lamarck also believed, as did many others at the time, that characteristics acquired {{during the course of}} an organism's life could be inherited by the next generation, and he saw this as a secondary evolutionary mechanism that produced adaptation to the environment. Typically, such characteristics included changes caused by the use or disuse of a particular organ. It was this mechanism of evolutionary adaptation through the inheritance of acquired characteristics that much later {{came to be known as}} Lamarckism. Although Alfred Russel Wallace completely rejected the concept in favor of natural selection, Charles Darwin always included what he called Effects of the increased Use and Disuse of Parts, as controlled by Natural Selection in On the Origin of Species, giving examples such as large ground feeding birds <b>getting</b> <b>stronger</b> legs through exercise, and weaker wings from not flying until, like the ostrich, they could not fly at all.|$|E
25|$|Darwin’s {{theory of}} natural {{selection}} {{laid the groundwork for}} modern evolutionary theory, and his experiments and observations showed that the organisms in populations varied from each other, that some of these variations were inherited, and that these differences could be acted on by natural selection. However, he could not explain the source of these variations. Like many of his predecessors, Darwin mistakenly thought that heritable traits were a product of use and disuse, and that features acquired during an organism's lifetime could be passed on to its offspring. He looked for examples, such as large ground feeding birds <b>getting</b> <b>stronger</b> legs through exercise, and weaker wings from not flying until, like the ostrich, they could not fly at all. This misunderstanding was called the inheritance of acquired characters and was part of the theory of transmutation of species put forward in 1809 by Jean-Baptiste Lamarck. In the late 19th century this theory became known as Lamarckism. Darwin produced an unsuccessful theory he called pangenesis to try to explain how acquired characteristics could be inherited. In the 1880s August Weismann's experiments indicated that changes from use and disuse could not be inherited, and Lamarckism gradually fell from favor.|$|E

They also continuously tried to empty the water out of the coal containers (which were the ones most seriously in danger) using buckets, since the pumps were insufficient.|$|E

2500|$|Overnight, pumping {{continued}} on Bonhomme Richard, and repairs began (also, the powder {{was removed from}} the magazine, which was threatened by the continued smouldering of the ship’s woodwork). With the water still getting deeper, the guns from the lower decks were reluctantly heaved overboard—not a very difficult task, as much of the hull was missing. The dead went the same way, though with rather more dignity. At 2pm the next day, with the carpenter insisting that the ship could not be saved, Commodore Jones took the ex-captain and lieutenant of Serapis to safety, but returned early in the evening to check on progress. Finding that the water was still rising, he ordered the wounded, who ideally should not have been moved, to be transferred to other vessels (Pearson was not aware of this nocturnal operation, and wrote in his official report that Jones had left the wounded aboard). At 10pm, those who had been brought in from other ships to man the pumps were ordered to leave, and {{during the rest of the}} night the most important items aboard were removed. These did not include personal possessions, not even most of Jones’s. The flotilla was slowly moving east-south-east away from the coast all this time, and was not seen from land again after night fell (as Flamborough Head is about [...] high, ships’ sails would be visible on a clear day up to [...] away). At 4am the next day, 25 September, pumping was abandoned, with the water almost up to the lower deck. The wind was <b>getting</b> <b>stronger,</b> so all personnel abandoned ship at 10am, and just before 11, as a boat approached from the commodore’s new command ship, Serapis, to try to salvage a few more items, Bonhomme Richard started to disappear beneath the waves.|$|E
2500|$|Andropov {{was elected}} the party's General Secretary on 12 November 1982 by a {{decision}} of the Central Committee. The Central Committee meeting was held less than 24 hours after the announcement of Brezhnev's death. A.R. Judson Mitchell claims that the Central Committee meeting which elected Andropov as General Secretary, {{was little more than}} a rubber stamp meeting. Andropov was in a good position to take over the control of the party apparatus; three big system hierarchs, Brezhnev, Kosygin and Suslov had all died. A fourth, Kirilenko, was forced into retirement. At the Central Committee meeting of 22 November 1982, Kirilenko lost his membership in the Politburo (after a decision within the Politburo itself), and Nikolai Ryzhkov, the Deputy Chairman of the State Planning Committee, was elected to the Secretariat. Ryzhkov became the Head of the Economic Department of the Central Committee, and became the leading Central Committee member on matters regarding economic planning. Shortly afterwards, Ryzhkov, after replacing Vladimir Dolgikh, began to oversee the civilian economy. At [...] the 14–15 June 1983 Central Committee meeting, Vitaly Vorotnikov was elected as a candidate member of the Politburo, Grigory Romanov was elected to the Secretariat and five members of the Central Committee were given full membership. The election of Romanov in the Secretariat, weakened Chernenko's control considerably. Later, Yegor Ligachev was appointed as Head of the Party Organisational Work Department of the Central Committee. Certain Brezhnev appointees were kept, such as Viktor Chebrikov and Nikolai Savinkin. With these appointments, Andropov effectively wielded the powers of the nomenklatura. Even so, by the time he had succeeded in dominating the Central Committee, Andropov fell ill. He was unable to attend the annual parade celebrating the victory of the October Revolution. Chernenko, the official second-ranking secretary, competed for power with Mikhail Gorbachev. The meetings of the Central Committee and the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union were postponed to the last possible moment because of Andropov's health. Changes continued however, and the Andropov appointees continued Andropov's course of introducing new blood into the Central Committee and Party apparatus. Vorotnikov and Mikhail Solomentsev were given full membership in the Politburo, Chebrikov was elected a candidate member of the Politburo and Ligachev became a member of the Secretariat. Chernenko's position began to look precarious; Gorbachev was <b>getting</b> <b>stronger</b> by the day. Four days after Andropov's death, on 9 February 1984, Chernenko was elected as the party's General Secretary.|$|E
