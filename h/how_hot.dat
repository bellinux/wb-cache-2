[...] "Crazy for You" [...] was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on July 16, 1985, for shipment of one million copies of the single across United States—the requirement for a gold single prior to 1989. The song reached number two on the Adult Contemporary Singles (behind [...] "Rhythm of the Night" [...] by DeBarge), and 80 on the Hot R/Hip-Hop Songs chart. It placed at nine on the year-end chart for 1985, with Madonna becoming the top pop artist for the year. In Canada, the song debuted at number 70 on the RPM issue dated March 16, 1985. On its eleventh week {{on the chart}}, the song reached the top position. It was present on the chart for a total of 25 weeks and was ranked seventh on the RPM Year-end chart for 1985. A music video was released, featuring Madonna singing the song in a night-club. The video was included in , released in 2009.|$|E

40|$|Abstract During {{substorm}} growth phases, magnetic reconnection at the magnetopause extracts ~ 1015 J {{from the}} solar wind which is then stored in the magnetotail lobes. Plasma sheet pressure increases to balance magnetic flux density increases in the lobes. Here we examine plasma sheet pressure, density, and temperature during substorm growth phases using 9 years of Cluster data (> 316, 000 data points). We show that plasma sheet pressure and temperature are higher during growth phases with higher solar wind driving, whereas the density is approximately constant. We also show a weak correlation between plasma sheet temperature before onset and theminimum SuperMAG AL (SML) auroral index in the subsequent substorm. We discuss how energization of the plasma sheet before onset may result from thermodynamically adiabatic processes; <b>how</b> <b>hotter</b> plasma sheets may result in magnetotail instabilities, and how this relates to the onset {{and size of the}} subsequent substorm expansion phase. 1...|$|R

2500|$|If a {{physical}} system is inhomogeneous or very rapidly or irregularly changing, for example by turbulence, {{it may be}} impossible to characterize it by a temperature, but still there can be transfer of energy as heat between it and another system. If a system has {{a physical}} state that is regular enough, and persists long enough {{to allow it to}} reach thermal equilibrium with a specified thermometer, then it has a temperature according to that thermometer. An empirical thermometer registers degree of hotness for such a system. Such a temperature is called empirical. For example, Truesdell writes about classical thermodynamics: [...] "At each time, the body is assigned a real number called the temperature. This number is a measure of <b>how</b> <b>hot</b> the body is." ...|$|E
