40|$|The {{formation}} of magnetite by {{the reduction of}} hematite with iron {{in the presence of}} aqueous solution at 350 - 570 "C, 1 - 2 kbar pressure, takes place by two reactions: (l) the oxidation of iron metal with water, and (2) the reduction of hematite with hydrogen. The overall oxidation-reduction reaction is accelerated by increased temperature, pressure, and solution acidity. The oxidation of iron occurs by a replacement and armoring mechanism, whereas hematite reduction occurs by reductive dissolution of hematite and direct precipi-tation of magnetite from the bulk solution. The initial rapid rate of the hematite reduction may render unreliable an oxygen <b>isotope</b> <b>geothermometer</b> calibrated using the reaction...|$|E

SATISH-KUMAR 1, Yasuhito YOSHIDA 1 and Hideki WADA 1 Abstract Spurrite [Ca 5 Si 2 O 8 (CO 3) ], a calc-silicate mineral with a carbonate molecule, {{is a product}} of high-temperature contact metamorphism, a typical example of which is found at the Fuka contact aureole, Okayama Prefecture, Japan. We report here carbon and oxygen isotope composition of CO 2 released from the reaction of spurrite with phosphoric acid in the temperature range of 25 ℃ to 100 ℃. While reacting with the acid carbon isotopes did not fractionate, while oxygen isotope shows consider-able isotope fractionation with varying reaction temperature, similar to other carbonate minerals. This suggests that the carbon and oxygen isotope measurements can be carried out using acid extraction method. In the Fuka contact aureole, carbon isotope fractionation of about 3 ‰ is observed between coexisting spurrite and coarse-grained calcite. If in equilibrium the carbon isotope fractionation between carbonate molecule in spurrite and calcite has the potential application as an <b>isotope</b> <b>geothermometer.</b> However, oxygen isotope distribution between calcite and spurrite could not be critically evaluated because of the uncertainties of source oxygen isotopes values of infiltrating fluids during the skarn formation and the fractionation of it between silicate and carbonate phases...|$|E
40|$|Hydrogen isotope {{fractionation}} factors between hydroxyl-bearing minerals and water were determined at temperatures ranging between 400 and 850 °C. The hydrogen isotope exchange {{rates for the}} mineral-water pairs examined were very slow. In most cases {{it was necessary to}} use an interpolation method for the determination of the hydrogen isotope equilibrium fractionation factor, α_e. For the temperature range of 450 – 850 °C the hydrogen {{isotope fractionation}} factors for the mica-water and amphibole-water systems are simply expressed as a function of temperature and the molar fractions of the six-fold coordinated cations in the crystal, regardless of mineral species, as follows: 10 ^ 3 In α_(e(mineral-water)) = − 22. 4 (10 ^ 6 T^(− 2)) + 28. 2 + (2 X_(Al) − 4 X_(Mg) − 68 X_(Fe)), where X is the molar fraction of the cations. As the equation indicates, for any specific composition of the OH-bearing minerals, the change of α_e with temperature, over the temperature range investigated, is the same for all minerals studied. Thus for any specified values of X_(Al), X_(Mg), and X_(Fe) for these minerals, the relationship between α_e and T is 10 ^ 3 In α_e = αT^(− 2) + k. Consequently, hydrogen isotope fractionation among coexisting minerals is temperature independent and cannot be used as a hydrogen <b>isotope</b> <b>geothermometer.</b> Some exceptions to the above general observations exist for minerals such as boehmite and kaolinite. In these minerals hydrogen bonding modifies the equilibrium hydrogen isotopic fractionation between mineral and water...|$|E
40|$|Although {{commonly}} {{utilized in}} continental geothermal work, the water–hydrogen and methane–hydrogen <b>isotope</b> <b>geothermometers</b> have been neglected in hydrothermal studies. Here we report δD-CH 4 and δD-H 2 values from high-temperature, black smoker-type hydrothermal vents and low-temperature carbonate-hosted {{samples from the}} recently discovered Lost City Hydrothermal Field. Methane deuterium content is uniform across the dataset at − 120 ± 12 ‰. Hydrogen δD values vary from − 420 ‰ to − 330 ‰ at high-temperature vents to − 700 ‰ to − 600 ‰ at Lost City. The application of several geothermometer equations to a suite of hydrothermal vent volatile samples reveals that predicted temperatures are similar to measured vent temperatures at high-temperature vents, and 20 – 60 °C higher than those measured at the Lost City vents. We conclude that the overestimation of temperature at Lost City reflects 1) that methane and hydrogen are produced by serpentinization at N 110 °C, and 2) that isotopic equilibrium at temperatures b 70 °C is mediated by microbial sulfate reduction. The successful application of hydrogen <b>isotope</b> <b>geothermometers</b> to low-temperature Lost City hydrothermal samples encourages its employment with low-temperature diffuse hydrothermal fluids...|$|R
40|$|The oxygen isotope {{fractionation}} between analcime and water is studied {{to test the}} feasibility of using zeolites as low-temperature thermometers. The fractionation of oxygen isotopes between natural analcime and water is determined at 300, 350, and 400 C, and at fluid pressures ranging from 1. 5 to 5. 0 kbar. Also, isotope ratios for the analcime framework, the channel water, and bulk water are obtained. The {{results suggest that the}} channel water is depleted in O- 18 relative to bulk water by a constant value of about 5 percent, nearly independent of temperature. The analcime-water fractionation curve is presented, showing that the exchange has little effect on grain morphology and does not involve recrystallization. The exchange is faster than any other observed for a silicate. The exchange rates suggest that zeolites in active high-temperature geothermal areas are in oxygen isotopic equilibrium with ambient fluids. It is concluded that calibrated zeolites may be excellent low-temperature oxygen <b>isotope</b> <b>geothermometers...</b>|$|R

40|$|Pb-Zn-Ag vein and listwaenite {{types of}} {{mineralization}} in Crnac deposit, Western Vardar zone, were deposited within several stages: (i) the pre-ore stage comprises pyrite, arsenopyrite, pyrrhotite, quartz, kaolinite and {{is followed by}} magnetite-pyrite; (ii) the syn-ore stage is composed of galena, sphalerite, tetrahedrite and stefanite; and (iii) the post-ore stage is composed of carbonates, pyrite, arsenopyrite and minor galena. The vein type mineralization is hosted by Jurassic amphibolites and veins terminate within overlying serpentinites. Mineralized listwaenites are developed along the serpentinite-amphibolite interface. The reserves are estimated to 1. 7 Mt of ore containing in average 7. 6 % lead, 2. 9 % zinc, and 102 g/t silver. Sulfides from the pre- and syn-mineralization assemblage of the vein- and listwaenite-types of mineralization from the Crnac Pb-Zn-Ag deposit have been analyzed using microprobe, crush-leachates and sulfur isotopes. The pre-ore assemblage precipitated under high sulfur fugacities (f(S(2)) = 10 (- 8) - 10 (- 6) bar) from temperatures ranging between 350 degrees C and 380 degrees C. Most likely water-rock reactions, boiling and/or increase of pH caused an increase of delta(34) S of pyrite toward upper levels within the deposit. The decomposition of pre-ore pyrrhotite to a pyrite-magnetite mixture occurred at a fugacity of sulfur from f(S(2)) = 8. 7 x 10 (- 10) to 9. 6 x 10 (- 9) bar and fugacity of oxygen from f(O(2)) = 2. 4 x 10 (- 30) to 3. 1 x 10 (- 28) bars, indicating a contribution of an oxidizing fluid, i. e. meteoric water during pre-ore stages of hydrothermal activity. The crystallization temperatures obtained by the sphalerite-galena <b>isotope</b> <b>geothermometer</b> range from 230 to 310 degrees C. The delta(34) S values of pre- and syn-ore sulfides (pyrite, galena, sphalerite, delta(34) S = 0. 3 - 5. 9 parts per thousand) point to magmatic sulfur. Values of delta(34) S of galena and sphalerite are decreasing upwards due to precipitation of early formed sulfide minerals. Post-ore assemblage precipitated at temperature below 190 degrees C. Based on data presented above, we assume two fluid sources: (i) a magmatic source, supported by sulfur isotopic compositions within pre- and syn-ore minerals and a high mol% of fluorine found within pre- and syn-ore leachates, and (ii) a meteoric source, deduced by coincident pyrite-magnetite intergrowth, sulfur isotopic trends within syn-ore minerals and decrease of crystallization temperatures from the pre-ore stage (380 - 350 degrees C), towards the syn-ore (310 - 215 degrees C) and post-ore stages (< 190 degrees C). Post-ore fluids are Na-Ca-Mg-K-Li chlorine rich and were modified via water-rock reactions.

40|$|The Alvord Valley Known Geothermal Resources Area (KGRA), located {{east of the}} Steens Mountain-Pueblo Mountains fault {{block in}} southeastern Oregon, is within the {{northern}} Basin and Range province. This investigation focuses on three thermal areas in the Alvord Basin: Borax Lake and the hot springs north of Borax Lake, Alvord Hot Springs and Mickey Springs. Mickey Springs and the springs north of Borax Lake are boiling at the surface (94 and 95 ° C, respectively). Inflow temperatures to Borax Lake, measured {{at a depth of}} 30 m, are greater than 100 ° C. Surface temperatures for Alvord Hot Springs and a flowing well northeast of Borax Lake are 78 and 59 ° C, respectively. Thermal fluids issue from Quaternary lacustrine and alluvial deposits. While silica sinter deposits are present at all three thermal areas, sinter is not presently being deposited. Minor calcite is being deposited at the springs north of Borax Lake. The springs discharge from N to NEstriking, high-angle, basin-bounding faults along the base of Steens Mountain and Mickey Mountain and NE-striking intrabasinal faults south of Alvord Lake. The thermal waters are dilute sodium-bicarbonate waters with significant amounts of sulfate and chloride. Conservative element plots (B, F, and Li vs. Cl) indicate good correlation between Cl and the other conservative elements. These correlations could result from mixing of thermal water with a dilute cold water or fluid evolution due to increased fluid-rock interaction, evaporation, and steam loss due to boiling. The small variations in chloride concentrations of thermal fluids during the sampling period argues against mixing of thermal fluids with cold water. The geothermal system is a hot-water rather than a vapordominated system. The ỎD content of thermal fluids is similar to the ỎD content of local cold water wells, springs, basinal pore fluids at a depth of 4 to 5 m, and perennial streams. Similarities in ỎD values indicate recharge for geothermal fluids is precipitation from the Steens Mountain fault block. The Ỏ 18 content of thermal fluids is shifted 2 to 3 °/oo {{to the right of the}} world meteoric water line indicating fluid-rock interaction at elevated temperatures in the reservoir. Tritium contents indicate relatively long residence times and/or low-velocity circulation of meteoric water through basement rocks. Values range from 0 to 0. 25 T. U. The application of two end-member models, which calculate fluid residence times, generate a minimum of 57 years and a maximum of greater than 10, 000 years. Estimated reservoir temperatures based on cation and silica geothermometry are between 170 and 200 °C. Oxygensulfate <b>isotope</b> <b>geothermometer</b> estimates indicate reservoir temperatures between 198 and 2072 ̆ 7 C for Borax Lake and Alvord Hot Springs. Mickey Springs and a flowing well northeast of Borax Lake yield temperature estimates of 168 and 150 ° C, respectively. These values indicate partial reequilibration of the isotopic system. The Ỏ 13 C contents of carbon dioxide and methane of gas discharges from the thermal areas are similar to geothermal fluids from other sites. The Ỏ 13 C of methane indicate 2 ̆ 2 normal 2 ̆ 2 geothermal methane for Alvord Hot Springs and Mickey Springs (- 27. 8 and - 27. 6, respectively). The Ỏ 13 C of CH 4 for springs north of Borax Lake (- 33. 6) indicates a small amount of thermogenic methane may be contributed by thermal alteration of organics in basinal sediments. The Ỏ 13 C contents for C 02 at Alvord Hot Springs and Borax Lake are within the range expected for atmospheric, fumarolic, or mantle derived C 02 (- 6. 5 and - 6. 6, respectively). The Ỏ 13 C content of C 02 from Mickey Springs is isotopically lighter than gas released from fumaroles or the mantle (- 9. 4). N 2 /Ar ratios for Mickey Springs and Borax Lake gases (39. 2 and 40. 8, respectively) indicate interaction with airsaturated ground water during flow through the the zone of aeration. Helium is enriched relative to Ar and N 2 in gas discharges from Alvord Hot Springs, indicating longer fluid residence times and/or increased crustal interaction at high temperatures. Ratios of B/Cl indicate the fluid reservoir is hosted in volcanic rocks. The Li/Cs ratios for the Borax Lake thermal area are consistent with a reservoir located in rhyoli tic rocks. The 228 Ra/ 226 Ra content of Borax Lake thermal fluids (1. 14 ± 0. 13 dpm/kg) indicates interaction with volcanic rocks for Borax Lake. The 228 Ra/ 226 Ra content of thermal fluids from Alvord Hot Springs and Mickey Springs (0. 38 0. 02 and 0. 17 0. 09) are lower than those expected for volcanic rocks and may indicate local uranium accumulation in the reservoir or zones of upflow. The 87 Sr / 86 Sr values for thermal waters and stratigraphic uni ts indicate the fluid reservoir is located in volcanic rocks beneath Steens Basalt. Equilibration of fluids in these units argues for thermal water circulation depths of 2 to 2. 5 km in the Borax Lake thermal area, greater than 3 km in the Alvord Hot Springs area and 1 to 2 km in the Mickey Springs area. Data presented in this study do not preclude a single large deep reservoir system discharging at these three thermal areas in the Alvord basin. Differences in the chemical and isotopic composition of discharge from the three thermal areas are produced during upf low from the reservoir. During upflow, thermal waters follow a complex pathway of vertical and lateral fractures which includes short residence times in shallow reservoirs before reaching the surface.

40|$|Interdiffusion between coexisting {{minerals}} affects all {{rocks and}} causes resetting and discordance of stable <b>isotope</b> <b>geothermometers</b> that is commonly observed in slowly cooled igneous and metamorphic rocks. The Fast Grain Boundary (FGB) model describes the stable isotope fractionations and intracrystalline zonation which result from closed system interdiffusion (Eiler et al., 1991, 1992). This model assumes that grain boundary diffusion is {{much faster than}} volume diffusion, and it accounts for exchange among all minerals in a rock. Previous models of closure temperature violate mass balance restrictions and will be inaccurate in most rocks. Modeling results are described for amphibolites and hornblende granites and gneisses; biotite granites, schists, and gneisses; pelitic and semi-pelitic rocks; garnet peridotites; anorthosites, gabbros, pyroxenites, and related rocks; and calc-silicate rocks. Examples of mineral pairs and specific rock types that allow accurate stable isotope thermometry include plagioclase-pyroxene in pyroxene bearing anorthosites and garnet-quartz in garnetiferous quartzites. In contrast, the same mineral pairs in related rocks such as pyroxenites and pelitic schists will exhibit reset apparent temperatures. Closed-system processes are capable of producing a variety of patterns of stable isotope resetting, discordance, mineral zonation, and fractionation reversals. Examples include large reversals of quartz-feldspar fractionations in micaceous rocks, and oscillatory zonation in feldspar from some quartz-rich rocks. These results permit reinterpretation of many studies of stable isotope thermometry, speedometry, and retrograde alteration history. FGB modeling of mineral zonation provides an important new guide to applying recently developed micro-analytical tools to slowly cooled rocks. Application of the FGB model to quartzo-feldspathic gneisses from the Adirondack Mountains, New York, demonstrates the usefulness of diffusion modeling in discriminating closed-system, diffusion controlled retrogression from open-system retrogression, and illustrates the possible importance of incorporating the effect of water activity on mineral diffusivity...|$|R
40|$|Oxygen {{isotopes}} {{have been}} equilibrated between muscovite and aqueous alkali chloride solution and between paragonite and alkali chloride solution in the temperature range of 400 °– 650 °C at 1 and 1. 5 kb fluid pressure. Isotopic equilibrium was inferred {{from the fact}} that compatible fractionation factors were obtained using 3 different chemical reactions to produce the mica: (1) muscovite or paragonite was prepared by reacting natural kaolinite with 2 – 3 molal KCl or NaCl solutions; (2) muscovite was crystallized in pure water from a gel; and (3) synthetic paragonite was reacted with 2 – 3 molal KCl solution, producing muscovite by an alkali ion exchange reaction. The 1 M modification of the mica was made in every experiment. In several cases the extent of oxygen exchange was traced by running companion equilibrations in solutions of unusually low O^(18) /O^(16) ratio. No isotopic fractionation was discernible between muscovite and paragonite in the temperature range studied. Per mille fractionations between muscovite and water are given by the expression 10 ^ 3 In α = 2. 38 (10 ^ 6 T^(− 2)) − 3. 89. These data can be combined with the results of other laboratory equilibration studies to establish a set of calibrated oxygen <b>isotope</b> <b>geothermometers.</b> Analogous to the alkali feldspar systems previously reported, the direct relationship between cation and oxygen isotope exchange suggests that some type of solution-redeposition mechanism operated during muscovite-paragonite transformations in aqueous solutions. Also, the extensive oxygen isotope exchange (with the solution) that accompanies the formation of muscovite from kaolinite implies a breakdown of the kaolinite structure. This notion does not concur with hypotheses based on rate studies and X-ray measurements that the unaltered kaolinite structure is partially inherited by the mica...|$|R
