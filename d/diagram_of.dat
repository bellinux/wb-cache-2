5|$|As {{regards the}} line of battle, we are given a little {{information}} by Ammianus.

5|$|Portrait of Madame Cézanne (sometimes Portrait of Mrs. Cézanne) is a 1962 Pop art {{painting}} by Roy Lichtenstein. It is a quotation of Erle Loran's <b>diagram</b> <b>of</b> a Cézanne {{painting of the}} same name. It {{was one of the}} works exhibited at Lichtenstein's first solo exhibition in Los Angeles. The work became controversial in that it led to a reconsideration of what constitutes art.|$|E

40|$|Diagrams {{can help}} with program {{understanding}} and code modification tasks. Today, many tools extract <b>diagrams</b> <b>of</b> packages, classes, associations and dependencies. However, during coding activities, developers often ask questions about objects and relations between objects, i. e., the run time structure. Most tools that display the run-time structure show only partial views based on running the system. In previous work, we proposed extracting <b>diagrams</b> <b>of</b> the run-time structure using static analysis. In this paper, we investigate whether developers {{who have access to}} such <b>diagrams</b> <b>of</b> the run-time structure can perform a code modification task more effectively than developers who have access to <b>diagrams</b> <b>of</b> only the code structur...|$|R

To the constellations featured on Mercator's globe, Molyneux added the Southern Cross and Southern Triangle, though somewhat to the west of their true positions.

5|$|When {{the stars}} of a {{particular}} globular cluster are plotted on an HR diagram, in many cases {{nearly all of the}} stars fall upon a relatively well defined curve. This differs from the HR <b>diagram</b> <b>of</b> stars near the Sun, which lumps together stars of differing ages and origins. The shape of the curve for a globular cluster is characteristic of a grouping of stars that were formed at approximately the same time and from the same materials, differing only in their initial mass. As the position of each star in the HR diagram varies with age, the shape of the curve for a globular cluster can be used to measure the overall age of the star population.|$|E
