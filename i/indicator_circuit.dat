50|$|The general {{negative}} feedback arrangement {{can be implemented}} by an IC voltage regulator (LM317 voltage regulator on Figure 8). As with the bare emitter follower and the precise op-amp follower above, it keeps up a constant voltage drop (1.25 V) across a constant resistor (1.25 Ω); so, a constant current (1 A) flows through the resistor and the load. The LED is on when the voltage across the load exceeds 1.8 V (the <b>indicator</b> <b>circuit</b> introduces some error). The grounded load is an important advantage of this solution.|$|E

5000|$|User {{data was}} {{originally}} stored on cassette tape. Radio Shack's model CTR-41 cassette recorder was {{included with the}} US$599 package. The software-based cassette tape interface was very slow and erratic; Green described it as [...] "crummy ... drives users up the wall", and {{the first issue of}} 80 Micro had three articles on how to improve cassette performance. It was sensitive to audio volume changes, and the machine gave only the very crudest indication as to whether the correct volume was set, via a blinking character on screen while data was being loaded. To find the correct volume, one would sometimes have to attempt to load a program once, adjusting volume until the machine picked up the data, then reset the machine, rewind the tape and attempt the loading again. Users quickly learned to save a file three or more times in hopes that one copy would prove to be readable. Automatic gain control or <b>indicator</b> <b>circuits</b> could be constructed to compensate for this (the owner's manual provided complete circuit diagrams for the whole machine, including the peripheral interfaces, with notes on operation).|$|R

40|$|Solar {{energy is}} one of the many forms of {{renewable}} energy on earth. This energy can be harnessed by using a solar cell or photovoltaic cell which converts sunlight directly into electricity. Solar power can also be used in many small electrical devices such as battery chargers. In this project, a solar powered battery charger with a state of charge <b>indicator</b> <b>circuit</b> is developed to charge AA batteries and to show indication to the user when the batteries reach a fully charged state. The primary benefit of using a solar powered battery charger is that it {{is one of}} the cheapest forms of recharging batteries.

5000|$|The field {{windings}} are supplied with {{power from the}} battery via the ignition switch and regulator. A parallel circuit supplies the [...] "charge" [...] warning indicator and is earthed via the regulator (which is why the indicator is on when the ignition is on but the engine is not running). Once the engine is running and the alternator is generating power, a diode feeds the field current from the alternator main output equalizing the voltage across the warning indicator which goes off. The wire supplying the field current {{is often referred to}} as the [...] "exciter" [...] wire. The drawback of this arrangement is that if the warning lamp burns out or the [...] "exciter" [...] wire is disconnected, no current reaches the {{field windings}} and the alternator will not generate power. Some warning <b>indicator</b> <b>circuits</b> are equipped with a resistor in parallel with the lamp that permit excitation current to flow if the warning lamp burns out. The driver should check that the warning indicator is on when the engine is stopped; otherwise, there might not be any indication of a failure of the belt which may also drive the cooling water pump. Some alternators will self-excite when the engine reaches a certain speed.|$|R

40|$|In-circuit testing methodologies are {{required}} to tackle the evaluation of embedded radio-frequency circuits. This paper presents design considerations for the test circuitry proposed to implement a methodology for on-chip testing a low-noise amplifier. A previously reported test technique consists on applying to the LNA a sequence of stimuli with different amplitudes, and on measuring the output amplitude for each input level. The obtained set of coordinates (Vin, Vout) allows finding the 3 rd order polynomial that best fits the LNA¿s transfer function. The LNA input voltages which lead to the 1 dB compression (P 1 dB) and third-order intercept (IP 3) points are then calculated after the polynomial coefficients. The work presented herein addresses the implementation of this method, according the scheme shown in Figure 1, i. e., {{the design of a}} variable amplitude oscillator, of the switch to connect it to the LNA input, {{as well as of the}} RMS-DC converter to measure the LNA¿s output power. Their development is based on criteria seeking to minimize power consumption and simplicity. Another design driving aspect addresses the facility of controlling the test operation and of observing the output measures using digital or low frequency signals, making it easier to interface this test scheme with general purpose testers. In spite of the simplicity of the circuits being proposed, good measurement results can be obtained. This concerns namely the RMS-DC converter, which is based on a simple half-wave rectifier. Anyway, simulation results for 1 dB compression and third-order intercept points show a good agreement with the expected ones. Alternative, eventually more accurate, RMS-DC converters or received signal strength <b>indicator</b> <b>circuits</b> would provide more accurate results at the cost of a much higher complexity and power consumption. Being a controlled oscillator available at the LNA input, the blocks placed after the LNA along the receiver chain can also be tested in sequence...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a fast received signal strength <b>indicator</b> (RSSI) <b>circuit</b> for wireless communi-cation application. The proposed circuit is developed using power detectors and an analog-to-digital con-verter {{to achieve a}} fast settling time. The power de-tector is consisted of a novel logarithmic variable gain amplifier (VGA), a peak detector, and a comparator in a closed loop. The VGA achieved a wide logarithmic gain range in a closed loop form for stable operation. For the peak detector, a fast settling time and small ripple are obtained using the orthogonal characteristics of quadrature signals. In 0. 18 -μm CMOS process, the RSSI value settles down in 20 μs with power consump-tion of 20 mW, and the maximum ripple of the RSSI is 30 mV.

The unit will provide 600 -V peak-to-peak with a dc-to-loo-MHz bandwidth. Other impor-tant characteristics include < 40 -ns delay time, 50 -dB voltage gain, and 4 -ns risetime with 6 % overshoot and ringing.

40|$|The {{increase}} in continuous loads such as radio transmitters and microprocessors in substations {{has led some}} utilities, including ours, {{to take a closer}} look at the sizing of the stationary batteries that operate those stations when commercial power is lost. Critical functions, such as tripping circuit breakers and conununicating information to dispatch centers, are placed on DC power. When station power is present, that DC power for the continuous loads is supplied by the charger. When conunercial power is lost, however, the continuous loads are carried by the batteries, which must also have the capacity to operate tripping mechanisms. IEEE Standard 485 I is widely accepted as the guideline for sizing of stationary batteries, and its application is discussed. Once a battery is placed in service, its maintenance, monitoring and periodic testing protocols are the next issues that the utility considers. Those practiced by this utility are discussed, including monitoring of the presence of DC power at certain critical points by SCADA equipment. The COIIlIOOnvoltages in electric utility substations are 48 and 120. 48 volt systems are more common, and are the preferred choice when allowable because of their smaller physical size and ease of maintenance. In some stations, however, the physical size of the station requires the higher voltage in order to lower the current and thus the voltage drop.

50|$|It is {{impossible}} to know precisely how many accidents were prevented by the proper observation of the rule, and it could not always prevent a crash. At Winwick, a train was brought to a stand some distance from the signal box. The fireman left promptly to carry out the rule, but he had not reached the signal box before his train was struck. To prevent such occurrences, 'call plungers' (which operate an indicator in the signal box when pressed) or telephones were installed at some signal posts, or track circuits installed. However, even this solution was not completely foolproof e.g. at Castlecary in 1937, the signalman observed that a train had passed a signal at danger, possibly due to a false signal indication, and assumed it had continued on past his signal box. The signalman failed to check his track <b>circuit</b> <b>indicators,</b> which would have shown that the train stopped, and the fireman arrived in the signal box moments too late to stop the signalman accepting a following express train. Full interlocking with track circuits and signal indications might have prevented this accident.|$|R
