50|$|The tramway's prosperous heyday was over, {{and it was}} to be {{many years}} before things improved. The {{deepening}} depression made the situation even worse, and saw staff retrenchments and the withdrawal of concession fares and <b>freight</b> <b>rebates</b> for primary producers. The onset of the Second World War brought further austerity; there were constant labour and material shortages, and it was difficult to buy coal. By 1944 the tramway was offering the bare minimum of service to customers, and Council had exhausted almost every trick it knew to keep it running. Scheduled services had again been cut back to twice weekly, and track maintenance was reduced to only the most urgent and necessary repairs. The two old engines had both been scrapped, and the only locomotive left in service was now 20 years old. Treasury had been waiving interest and loan repayment for years, and had written off a part of the debt; effectively the Queensland Government was subsidising the Aramac tramway because it was cheaper to do so than to provide an alternative service to the Aramac district at government expense.|$|R
