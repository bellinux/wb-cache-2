25|$|Toilet paper {{when used}} with a toilet roll holder with a {{horizontal}} axle {{parallel to the floor}} and also parallel to the wall has two possible orientations: the toilet paper may <b>hang</b> <b>over</b> (in front of) or under (behind) the roll; if perpendicular to the wall, the two orientations are right-left or near-away. The choice is largely a matter of personal preference, dictated by habit. In surveys of US consumers and of bath and kitchen specialists, 60–70 percent of respondents prefer over.|$|E

The split top of the piece now called the bishop was interpreted as a bishop's mitre or a fool's cap.|$|E

25|$|All five {{versions}} of the picture are of roughly the same large size (2.6 x 2.2 m). Bonaparte appears mounted in the uniform of a general in chief, wearing a gold-trimmed bicorne, and armed with a Mamluk-style sabre. He is wreathed {{in the folds of}} a large cloak which billows in the wind. His head is turned towards the viewer, and he gestures with his right hand toward the mountain summit. His left hand grips the reins of his steed. The horse rears up on its back legs, its mane and tail whipped against its body by the same wind that inflates Napoleon's cloak. In background a line of the soldiers interspersed with artillery make their way up the mountain. Dark clouds <b>hang</b> <b>over</b> the picture and in front of Bonaparte the mountains rise up sharply. In the foreground BONAPARTE, HANNIBAL and KAROLVS MAGNVS IMP. are engraved on rocks. On the breastplate yoke of the horse, the picture is signed and dated.|$|E

She lives on the outskirts of society and makes her home near [...] "graveyards, gibbets, and the battlefields copiously supplied by civil war"; she uses the body parts from these locations in her magic spells. Indeed, she delights in otherwise heinous and macabre acts involving corpses (for instance, [...] "when the dead are confined in a sarcophagus [...] then she eagerly rages every limb. She plunges her hand into the eyes, delights at digging out the congealed eyeballs, and gnaws the pallid nails on a desiccated hand.").|$|E

Ill-health and hull damage forced him to put ashore at Australia. After departing on 12 December 1971, a large sea creature (a whale or shark) damaged his boat about [...] southwest of Fremantle. [...] "Only his skill and heroic efforts were able to keep the vessel afloat until jury repairs could be made". King was below deck when he heard a shattering sound and saw the hull below the water line bulge inward and splinter. He rushed upstairs and heeled the boat so that the hole was lifted out of the water. He had to <b>hang</b> <b>over</b> the side and submerge himself to carry out emergency repairs with material that included thirteen ropes, sticky tape, collision covers, sheet copper, and sponge rubber. Then he had to fix the inside of the hull as well. After three days of work, he was able to return to Fremantle, [...] "barely able to limp into port".|$|E

Instead of employing numerous columns like those at Harvard Stadium, Smith designed double columns that allow for more space between columns.

2500|$|Lee's {{death was}} {{alleged to have}} a melancholic effect on viewers; Desson Howe of The Washington Post wrote that Lee [...] "haunts every frame" [...] and James Berardinelli called the film [...] "a case of 'art imitating death', and that specter will always <b>hang</b> <b>over</b> The Crow". Berardinelli called it an {{appropriate}} epitaph to Lee, Howe called it an appropriate sendoff, and Ebert stated {{that not only was}} this Lee's best film, but it was better than any of his father's (Bruce Lee). Critics generally thought that this would have been a breakthrough film for Lee, although James disagreed. The changes made to the film after Lee's death were noted by reviewers, most of whom saw them as an improvement. Howe said that it had been transformed into something compelling. James, although terming it a genre film, said that it had become more mainstream because of the changes.|$|E
2500|$|In 1956, John D. Clark theorized in {{an article}} in the Baker Street Journal that Wolfe was the {{offspring}} of an affair between Sherlock Holmes and Irene Adler (a character from [...] "A Scandal in Bohemia"). Clark suggested that the two had an affair in Montenegro in 1892, and that Nero Wolfe was the result. The idea was later co-opted by William S. Baring-Gould and implied in the novels of Nicholas Meyer, but there is no evidence that Rex Stout had any such connection in mind. Certainly there is no mention of it in any of the stories, although a painting of Sherlock Holmes does <b>hang</b> <b>over</b> Archie Goodwin's desk in Nero Wolfe's office. Some commentators note both physical and psychological resemblances and suggest Sherlock's brother Mycroft Holmes as a more likely father for Wolfe. Commentators have noted a coincidence in the names [...] "Sherlock Holmes" [...] and [...] "Nero Wolfe": the same vowels appear in the same order. In 1957, Ellery Queen called this [...] "The Great O-E Theory" [...] and suggested that it was derived from the father of mysteries, Edgar Allan Poe.|$|E
