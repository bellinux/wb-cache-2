40|$|Superhydrophobic surface {{have drawn}} {{considerable}} attention {{due to its}} applicability to protective and self-cleaning textiles. Generally, creating fine roughness on hydrophobic materials is an effective way of fabricating repellent surfaces. The {{purpose of this study}} is to investigate the influence of surface morphology and surface energy on the repellency (or wettability). To this end, PS nanowebs in various fiber morphologies were fabricated by varying the electrospinning conditions. Electrospinning with the varied polymer concentration and solvent mixture generated different surface morphologies, such as beads, wrinkles, and smooth fibers. A smooth PS film showed CA of 95 Ëš; compared to the film 2 ̆ 7 s CA, CAs on an electrospun web were apparently increased, due to the increased roughness of the web for a hydrophobic PS material. It was concluded that introducing surface roughness on an oxidized PS surface (hydrophilic) enhanced the surface wettability, while the roughness on a <b>hydrophobized</b> <b>surface</b> enhanced the surface repellency...|$|E

Effects of concentration (≤ 10 g ml− 1, for lysozyme ≤ 200 g ml− 1) and dependence of surface wettability, {{as well as}} adsorption kinetics and elutability of adsorbed films by buffer and sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) solutions were investigated. Results showed that the amounts adsorbed decreased in the order lactoferrin ≥ lactoperoxidase> lysozyme ≥ histatin 5. On hydrophilic silica, the adsorption was most likely driven by electrostatic interactions, which resulted in adsorbed amounts of lactoferrin that indicated the for-mation of a monolayer with both side-on and end-on adsorbed molecules. For lactoperoxidase the adsorbed amounts were somewhat higher than an end-on monolayer, lysozyme adsorption showed amounts corresponding to a side-on monolayer, and histatin 5 displayed adsorbed amounts {{in the range of}} a side-on monolayer. On hydrophobized substrata, the adsorption was also mediated by hydrophobic interactions, which resulted in lower adsorbed amounts of lactoferrin and lactoperoxidase; closer to side-on monolayer coverage. For both lysozyme and histatin 5 the adsorbed amounts were the same as on the hydrophilic silica. The investigated proteins exhibited fast adsorption kinetics, and the initial kinetics indicated mass transport controlled behaviour at low concentrations on both types of substrates. Buffer rinsing and SDS elution indicated that the proteins in general were more tightly bound to the <b>hydrophobized</b> <b>surface</b> compared to hydrophilic silica.

40|$|Hydrophobicity is a {{property}} of soils that reduces their affinity for water, which may help impeding the pressure build-up within aggregates, and reducing aggregate disruption. The {{purpose of this}} study was to examine the relation of soil hydrophobicity and drying temperature to water stability of aggregates while preventing the floating of dry aggregates using unhydrophobized and <b>hydrophobized</b> <b>surface</b> Andisol. Soil was hydrophobized using stearic acid into different hydrophobicities. Hydrophobicity was determined using sessile drop contact angle and water drop penetration time (WDPT). Water stability of aggregates (%WSA) was determined using artificially prepared model aggregates. The %WSA increased as the contact angle and WDPT increased. Contact angle and WDPT, which provided maximum %WSA showing less than 1 s of floating, was around 100 ° and 5 s, respectively. Although the %WSA gradually increased with increasing contact angle and WDPT above this level, high levels of hydrophobicity initiated aggregate floating, which would cause undesirable effects of water repellency. Heating at 50 °C for 5 h d- 1 significantly affected %WSA and hydrophobicity in hydrophobized samples, but did not in unhydrophobized samples. The results indicate that the contact angle and wetting rate (WDPT) are closely related with the water stability of aggregates. The results further confirm that high levels of hydrophobicities induce aggregate floating, and the drying temperature has differential effects on hydrophobicity and aggregate stability depending on the hydrophobic materials present in the soil...|$|E
40|$|Biomolecule {{adsorption}} is {{the first}} stage of biofouling. The aim of this work was to reduce the adsorption of proteins on stainless steel (SS) and titanium surfaces by modifying them with a poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) –poly(propylene oxide) (PPO) –PEO triblock copolymer. Anchoring of the central PPO block of the copolymer is known to be favoured by hydrophobic interaction with the substratum. Therefore, the surfaces of metal oxides were first modified by self-assembly of octadecylphosphonic acid. PEO–PPO–PEO preadsorbed on the <b>hydrophobized</b> <b>surfaces</b> of titanium or SS was shown to prevent the adsorption of bovine serum albumin (BSA), fibrinogen and cytochrome C, as monitored by quartz crystal microbalance (QCM). Moreover, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry were used to characterize the surfaces of the SS and titanium after competitive adsorption of PEO–PPO–PEO and BSA. The results show that the adsorption of BSA is well prevented on <b>hydrophobized</b> <b>surfaces,</b> in contrast to the surfaces of native metal oxides...|$|R

The low-molecular weight protein content of bulk HPalS was also investigated using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, and this revealed {{the presence of a}} large group of proteins< 100 kDa in size. Adsorption to pure (hydrophilic) and methylated (<b>hydrophobized)</b> silica <b>surfaces</b> revealed that the total adsorbed amounts were greater on hydrophobized silica.

40|$|Recent reports using {{particle}} image velocimetry and cone-and-plate rheometers {{have suggested}} that a simple Newtonian liquid flowing across a superhydrophobic surface demonstrates a finite slip length. Slippage on a superhydrophobic surface indicates {{that the combination of}} topography and hydrophobicity may have consequences for the coupling at the solid-liquid interface observed using the high-frequency shear-mode oscillation of a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM). In this work, we report on the response of a 5 MHz QCM possessing a superhydrophobic surface to immersion in water-glycerol mixtures. QCM surfaces were prepared with a layer of SU- 8 photoresist and lithographically patterned to produce square arrays of 5 mu m diameter circular cross-section posts spaced 10 mu m center-to-center and with heights of 5, 10, 15, and 18 mu m. Non-pattemed layers were also created for comparison, and both non-hydrophobized and chemically <b>hydrophobized</b> <b>surfaces</b> were investigated. Contact angle measurements confirmed that the <b>hydrophobized</b> post <b>surfaces</b> were superhydrophobic. QCM measurements in water before and after applying pressure to force a Cassie-Baxter (non-penetrating) to Wenzel (penetrating) conversion of state showed a larger frequency decrease and higher dissipation in the Wenzel state. QCM resonance spectra were fitted to a Butterworth-van Dyke model for the full range of water-glycerol mixtures from pure water to (nominally) pure glycerol, thus providing data on both energy storage and dissipation. The data obtained for the post surfaces show a variety of types of behavior, indicating the importance of the surface chemistry in determining the response of the quartz crystal resonance, particularly on topographically structured surfaces; data for <b>hydrophobized</b> post <b>surfaces</b> imply a decoupling of the surface oscillation from the mixtures. In the case of the 15 mu m tall <b>hydrophobized</b> post <b>surfaces,</b> crystal resonance spectra become narrower as the viscosity -density product increases, which is contrary to the usual behavior. In the most extreme case of the 18 mu m tall <b>hydrophobized</b> post <b>surfaces,</b> both the frequency decrease and bandwidth increase of the resonance spectra are significantly lower than that predicted by the Kanazawa and Gordon model, thus implying a decoupling of the oscillating surface from the liquid, which can be interpreted as interfacial sli...|$|R
40|$|Normal and {{shear forces}} were {{measured}} {{as a function}} of surface separation, D between hydrophobized mica surfaces bearing layers of a hydrophobic-polyelectrolytic diblock copolymer, poly(methyl methacrylate) -block-poly(sodium sulfonated glycidyl methacrylate) copolymer (PMMA-b-PSGMA). The copolymers were attached to each <b>hydrophobized</b> <b>surface</b> by their hydrophobic PMMA moieties with the nonadsorbing polyelectrolytic PSGMA tails extending into the aqueous medium to form a polyelectrolyte brush. Following overnight incubation in 10 (- 4) w/v aqueous solution of the copolymer, the strong hydrophobic attraction between the hydrophobized mica surfaces across water was replaced by strongly repulsive normal forces between them. These were attributed to the osmotic repulsion arising from the confined counterions at long-range, together with steric repulsion between the compressed brush layers at shorter range. The corresponding shear forces on sliding the surfaces were extremely low and below our detection limit (+/- 20 - 30 nN), even when compressed down to a volume fraction close to unity. On further compression, very weak shear forces (130 +/- 30 nN) were measured due to the increase in the effective viscous drag experienced by the compressed, sliding layers. At separations corresponding to pressures of a few atmospheres, the shearing motion led to abrupt removal of most of the chains out of the gap, and the surfaces jumped into adhesive contact. The extremely low frictional forces between the charged brushes (prior to their removal) is attributed to the exceptional resistance to mutual interpenetration displayed by the compressed, counterion-swollen brushes, together with the fluidity of the hydration layers surrounding the charged, rubbing polymer segments...|$|E
40|$|Hydrophobization of {{the surface}} of {{sandstone}} and limestone materials is an effective method of their protection against the effects of weathering. Effective hydrophobizing agents are solutions of alkyltrialkoxysilanes, especially methyl- or octyltriethoxysilane in a suitable organic solvent (in particular white spirit), and solutions containing polymeric organosilicon compounds also in mineral spirits. It is a major disadvantage of hydrophobization {{that there is a}} change in the original appearance of the material due to the increased deposition of dirt on the hydrophobic surface, which is unevenly washed away by rain water, which results in unsightly stains on the surface. Another general disadvantage of hydrophobization is that it renders it very difficult to impossible to carry out another treatment particularly with hydrophilic agents. With the proposed method it is possible to create a thin hydrophilic layer on a <b>hydrophobized</b> <b>surface</b> to ensure the uniform washing away of dirt and to enable the mentioned additional surface treatment. Given that the depth of its removal may be precisely controlled in this process, the hydrophobization will be removed only to the desired depth and will not therefore undermine the effectiveness of the hydrophobization. The new method of hydrophobization of sandstone and limestone materials with a thin hydrophilic coating is based on a two-step process comprising the surface hydrophobization using an agent comprising alkyltrialkoxysilanes or polydimethylsiloxane polymers in an organic solvent to a sufficient depth, and the removal of a thin surface layer of the hydrophobization, bound {{to the surface of the}} material, with a thickness of approximately 1 mm...|$|E

The imidization reaction was monitored by NMR and attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared (ATR–FTIR) spectroscopy. 1, 2 -Cyclohexyldicarboxylic anhydride was chosen as a model compound for the PSMA copolymer; this allowed a more detailed characterization by NMR and ATR–FTIR spectroscopy. After the PSMA/PDMS–NH 2 imidization reached completion, {{a fraction of the}} anhydrides were ammonolyzed. In this way, a self-emulsifying latex with an average particle diameter of approximately 145 nm and a ¿ potential of - 56 mV was obtained. It was found that the PDMS-modified PSMA latex in which 30 mol% of the initial amount of anhydride groups were previously imidized by using PDMS-NH 2 and a fraction of the anhydrides were ammonolyzed with 0. 3 eq. of NH 3 (PSMA 30) was stable in the pH range 4 – 10.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{hydrophobic}} interaction plays {{an essential role}} in various natural phenomena and industrial processes. Previous studies on the {{hydrophobic interaction}} focused mainly on the interaction between hydrophobic solid surfaces for which the effective range of hydrophobic attraction was reported to vary from ∼ 10 nm to> 1 μm. Here, we report studies of the interaction between an air bubble in water used as a probe attached to the cantilever of an atomic force microscope and partially <b>hydrophobized</b> mica <b>surfaces.</b> No bubble attachment was observed for bare hydrophilic mica, but attachment behaviors and attraction with an exponential decay length of 0. 8 − 1. 0 nm were observed between the air bubble and partially hydrophobized mica as characterized by a water contact angle on the mica surface that varied from 45 ° to 85 °.

Differences in elution (using {{sodium dodecyl sulphate}} (SDS) solutions) between mixed and single protein films were also investigated. On both hydrophilic and <b>hydrophobized</b> <b>surfaces</b> HWS and MUC 5 B were found to adsorb to pre-adsorbed layers of statherin and PRP 1 respectively. Statherin adsorption on both substrate types showed no or minor exchange by HWS or MUC 5 B and no change in SDS elution between mixed and single protein films. Small amounts of PRP 1 were exchanged by HWS on both surface types and the SDS elutable fractions were similar or larger for mixed films compared to single protein films. PRP 1 and MUC 5 B in sequence showed minor exchange of PRP 1 on hydrophilic surfaces, while no exchange could be established on hydrophobized substrates. SDS elutable fractions decreased for PRP 1 and MUC 5 B mixed films compared to single protein films.

The adsorption behavior was mapped while stepwise increasing the concentration of SDS to a polyelectrolyte solution of constant concentration.

An adsorbed layer remained after complete exchange of the polyelectrolyte/surfactant solution for aqueous NaCl.

The overall features of the deposition were similar at hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces, but there were also notable differences.

The adsorbed hIgG forms interfacial structures varying in organization from a submonolayer to a multilayer. An "end-on" IgG orientation in the monolayer film, associated with the surface coverage results, does not corroborate with the effective protein thickness determined from SPR/SAW measurements. This inconsistence is interpreted by a deformation effect induced by conformation change. This conformation change is confirmed by QCM-D measurement. Combined SPR/SAW measurements suggest that the adsorbed protein barely contains water after extended contact with the hydrophobic surface. This limited interfacial hydration also contributed to a continuous conformation change in the adsorbed protein layer. The viscoelastic variation associated with interfacial conformation changes induces about 1. 5 times overestimation of the mass uptake in the QCM-D measurements.

Surface deposition from the formulations onto model surfaces of either anionic hydrophilic, or hydrophobized, silica was induced by controlled dilution of the formulations into the coacervation region, and was monitored with time by ellipsometry.

40|$|International audienceConventional lithographic {{printing}} processes using porous alumina for offset applications generally use “wet” routes.

Treatments involving rf plasma-enhanced fluorination (PEF) constitute exceptional tools for modifying the surface properties of materials. Many advantages of these techniques can be indeed outlined, when compared to more conventional methods: room-temperature reactions, chemical modi-fications limited to surface only without changing the bulk properties, possible non-equilibrium reac-tions. The influence of PEF treatments on porous alumina layer used in printing plates has been tested with various fluorinated gases (CF 4, C 3 F 8 and C 4 F 8) and characterized by XPS.

The stability of the multilayers was investigated by addition of sodium dodecyl sulfate solution (SDS). Atomic force microscopy was employed to investigate morphological structures on the surfaces during the layer-by-layer film build-up. It was clearly shown that, on both hydrophilic and hydrophobized silica, only MUC 5 B and lactoperoxidase showed the ability for multilayer formation, resulting in an approximately linear increase in adsorbed amount and film thickness with each deposition cycle. The net increase in amounts per cycle was larger on the hydrophilic silica. Further, MUC 5 B needs to be adsorbed first on the hydrophilic substrates to obtain this fast build-up behavior. Generally, addition of SDS solution showed that a large fraction of the adsorbed film could be desorbed. However, films on the hydrophobized silica were more resistant to surfactant elution. In conclusion, MUC 5 B–cationic protein multilayers can be formed on hydrophilic and hydrophobized silica, depending on {{the choice of the}} cationic protein as well as in which order the build-up is started on hydrophilic silica.

The influence of fatty acids on the fouling of membranes is often ignored because their concentration is rather low.

The pore radius of the membrane, the concentration of fatty acids and the pH of the solution all have a profound influence on the flux reduction when treating solutions containing fatty acids.

When the surface is rendered hydrophobic, the nonsoluble block exhibits stronger interaction with the surface and higher adsorbed masses are achieved. Interaction forces between two such adsorbed layers on both substrates were measured using the surface forces apparatus.

Stable films, supported by the repulsive van der Waals-Casimir-Lifshitz force were always observed between air bubble and hydrophilic mica surfaces (water contact angle, &# 0952;w < 5 &# 0176;) whereas bubble attachment occurred on <b>hydrophobized</b> mica <b>surfaces.</b> A theoretical model, based on the Reynolds lubrication theory and the augmented Young-Laplace equation including the effects of disjoining pressure, provided excellent agreement with experiment results, indicating the essential physics involved in the interaction between air bubble and solid surfaces can be elucidated. A hydrophobic interaction free energy per unit area of the form: WH(h) = -&# 0947;(1 - cos &# 0952;w) exp(-h/DH) can be used to quantify the attraction between bubble and hydrophobized solid substrate at separation, h, with &# 0947; being the surface tension of water. For surfaces with water contact angle in the range 45 &# 0176; < &# 0952;w < 90 &# 0176;, the decay length DH varied between 0. 8 and 1. 0 nm. This study quantified the hydrophobic interaction in asymmetric system between air bubble and hydrophobic surfaces, and provided a feasible method for synchronous measurements of the interaction forces with sub-nN resolution and the drainage dynamics of thin films down to nm thickness...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to investigate the adsorption of PRP- 1, PRP- 3 and statherin to solid surfaces in terms of dependence on concentration, the presence of electrolyte and surface wettability. Time resolved in situ ellipsometry was used to determine the adsorbed amounts and adsorption rates of pure PRP- 1, PRP- 3 and statherin onto pure (hydrophilic) and methylated (<b>hydrophobized)</b> silica <b>surfaces.</b> The initial film build-up was fast and plateaus were reached within 10 min at all concentrations for both types of surfaces and all proteins. The observed adsorption and calculated diffusion rates of PRP- 1, PRP- 3 and statherin, respectively, indicated that the initial adsorption was mass transport controlled at low concentrations. At hydrophobic surfaces, isotherm shapes and adsorbed amounts were similar for PRP- 1 and PRP- 3, while statherin adsorbed to a higher extent. At hydrophilic surfaces only PRP- 1 adsorbed substantially, while for PRP- 3 and statherin adsorbed amounts were low. The presence of Ca 2 + ions in the phosphate buffer solution increased the adsorption of statherin and PRP- 3 on hydrophobic surfaces, while PRP- 1 was unaffected. On hydrophilic surfaces, all three proteins adsorbed in higher amounts in NaCl, compared to CaCl 2 at similar ionic strength. It is concluded that acidic PRPs (PRP- 1 and PRP- 3) and statherin readily form films on a variety of materials and solution conditions, showing that their functions may be fulfilled under a wide range of conditions...|$|R
40|$|Biofouling {{refers to}} the {{accumulation}} of organisms and their products onto surfaces immersed in a biological aqueous environment. It includes molecular-, micro- and macro-fouling. Molecular fouling is the initial step of biofouling, in which a conditioning film is formed by adsorption of organic biomolecules. Furthermore, surface-associated aggregates of microorganisms with their extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) are called biofilm, known to provoke the biocorrosion of metals. Chlorination {{is still the most}} common treatment to control biofouling of cooling condensers fed with fresh- or seawater in power plants, provoking harmful effects to the aquatic environment. An environmental-friendly way to replace chlorination is thus highly desired. The aim of this thesis is to design a renewable poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) -based coating on metals (Ti, stainless steel and Al brass) used in cooling condensers, with a view to reduce biofouling. Adsorption of a PEO-poly(propylene oxide) -PEO copolymer was performed on native and <b>hydrophobized</b> metal <b>surfaces.</b> Three proteins (albumin, fibrinogen, cytochrome C) and Pseudomonas 2021, a marine bacterium, were used as model molecular- and micro-fouling agents, respectively. The results show that the adsorbed triblock copolymer prevents protein adsorption and significantly reduces bacterial adhesion on hydrophobized metal substrates, but not on native ones. The copolymer conformation {{plays a key role in}} biofouling reduction; it is believed to form a brush structure on hydrophobized substrates. In addition, proteins were highlighted as an important constituent of EPS and their conditioning films, as analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. This confirms the relevance of preventing protein adsorption to reduce biofouling. (AGRO - Sciences agronomiques et ingénierie biologique) [...] UCL, 201...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: The aims of {{the present}} study were to {{investigate}} the adsorption from human whole saliva to solid surfaces in terms of dependence of adsorption time and surface wettability, to investigate pellicle elutability with buffer and sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) and finally to identify major components involved. Methods: Time resolved in situ ellipsometry was used to determine the adsorbed amounts and adsorption rates from human whole saliva onto pure (hydrophilic) and methylated (<b>hydrophobized)</b> silica <b>surfaces.</b> Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was used to identify salivary components in the secretions as well as major components in pellicles. Results: The results demonstrated that on hydrophobic surfaces the initial adsorption was rapid and a plateau was reached, whereas on hydrophilic ones a continuous increase was observed during the time course of experiments. Contrary to what was expected, it was found that buffer rinsing removed less material after short adsorption times on hydrophobic surfaces, whereas less time dependence was observed on hydrophilic ones. After SDS exposure a minor fraction remained adsorbed after 15 minutes of adsorption, while a complete removal of the adsorbed film was observed after 2 hours of adsorption on hydrophobic surfaces. On hydrophilic surfaces a minor fraction remained adsorbed after both 15 minutes and 2 hours of adsorption. The two-dimensional gel electrophoresis revealed the presence of more than 50 proteins, with a molecular mass below 200 kDa present in whole saliva. Of these proteins only a few components were detected in the fraction eluted by SDS. Conclusions: We conclude that the different desorbability upon buffer rinsing and addition of SDS indicate that adsorbed proteins have varying binding strengths to the two types of surfaces. The time dependence observed and the compositional analysis show that the adsorbed pellicle undergoes conformational and/or compositional changes...|$|R

40|$|There {{have been}} {{considerable}} interests about the sub-nanoscale resolution of biomolecule AFM imaging. Optimization of sample preparation and imaging conditions of soft biological structures in ambient conditions provide possibilities {{to control the}} tip-sample interactions. In order to achieve nanoscale resolution, stable sample conditions become necessary for both hydrophillic and hydrophobic surface. [1, 2] We have examined the interaction force between the <b>hydrophobized</b> Si (100) <b>surface</b> and the probe tip in water in addition to in the air by measuring the force using atomic force microscopy. The silicon substrates were treated by 48 % hydrofluoric acid (HF) solution, and by aminopropyltriethoxysilane (ATPES) solution, and by degreasing only. After sample treatment procedures, the force-distance measurements were carried out immediately by biolever cantilever with ~ 0. 03 N/m spring constant. The sample with a 48 % HF solution treatment exhibits greater adhesion force than the surface treated with ATPES. On the other hand, the surface treated with only deionized water-degreasing presents highest adhesion from hydrophilic characteristics of the native oxide on the silicon surface. The adhesion force in water reveal significantly smaller than in air for all sample surfaces. [Fig. 1. 2 and 3] References...|$|R
40|$|In the {{considered}} thesis {{colloidal particles}} on polystyrene base, synthesized {{by the way}} of emulgator-free copolymerization has been matter of investigation. The surfaces of these particles possess amphoteric groups causing a positive or negative charge depending on the pH of the medium. Considering their isoelectric point the particles show reversible coagulation. These charged colloidal particles perform electrophoretic motion when an electric field {{is applied to the}} cell containing the dispersion. In combination of electrophoretic measurements with the well known method of laser-doppler-anemometrie it is possible to get information about the electrophoretic mobility of these particles and so one can draw conclusions about the quantity of effective surface charge. In this paper the electrophoretic mobility as an indicator for surface charge were measured under different conditions. Changing the pH, the kind of electrolyte and its ionic strength and the hydrophobicity of the medium demonstrates the strong influence of these parameters. As a result one can see that even in very low concentrations of the electrolytic systems, i. e. 5 * 10 - 7 mol/l, the mobility shows a characteristical behaviour under the examined conditions. Further on it is possible to study the behaviour of stability of the dispersion under these conditions. Furthermore adsorption experiments with the spherical protein bsa on the particle surface were made even under different conditions. It seems obviously clear, that bsa adsorbs more effective on <b>hydrophobized</b> particle <b>surfaces.</b> Compared to these model systems colloidal particles from water and waste water were examined. Neither their real configuration nor their matter is known, but only by knowledge about their electrophoretic behaviour it is possible to draw conclusions about their stability. Using salts on the base of iron and chlorine to separate these particles from the medium it is possible to optimize the required dose. It is a very interesting result that a quick measurement of these physicochemical parameter offers a reliable method in the treatment of water and waste water...|$|R
40|$|The surfactant-polymer system SDS-JR 400 with {{different}} component ratios was {{studied in the}} bulk solution using DLS and during adsorption at solid-liquid interfaces using AFM. DLS measurements delivered data concerning the size and uniformity of micelle-like clusters formed in the bulk solution. Soft-contact AFM imaging was used to visualize {{the structure of the}} adsorbed layer, the acquirement of the force-distance curves together with the special �scratching� treatment brought information about the mechanical properties of the layer. The adsorption from the mixed solutions in the concentration range from below critical aggregation concentration (CAC) to above polymer saturation point (PSP) was cooperative at native mica, hydrophobized mica and <b>hydrophobized</b> silica <b>surface.</b> The surfactant-rich mixtures showed the less and the polymer-rich mixtures � the most pronounced adsorption at all surfaces. In all cases of adsorption from mixtures the adsorbed layer was structured showing a presence of polymer-surfactant aggregates. A correlation between light scattering data concerning sturcturizing and particle size, on the one hand, and AFM images, on the other hand, was observed. A resemblance between images of mixture samples of the same or similar composition, but acquired on different surfaces, was found. It turned out that the influence of surface properties is of less importance for adsorption, compared to the influence of the mixture composition in bulk. It should be remarked that this conclusion can only be drawn, when surfactant and polymer are mixed prior to adsorption. A dependence between the surface charge and hydrophobicity, on the one hand, and the strength of adsorption, on the other hand, was visualized: SDS-JR 400 mixtures of the same composition demonstrated different properties of the adsorbed layer after adsorption at native mica, hydrophobized mica and hydrophobized silica. The data obtained during �washing-off� experiments including a subsequent substitution of mixtures in the bulk phase with increasing surfactant/polymer ratio demonstrated that the composition and structure of the adsorbed layer follow the same changes that occur in the bulk phase: SDS penetrates the adsorbed layer and causes changes in its properties...|$|R
40|$|The main {{components}} in the mucous gels apart from water are mucins, which are proteins with high molecular weights and an abundance of negatively charged oligosaccharide side chains. The aim of the investigations was to characterize interactions between mucins and other proteins that {{are present in the}} mucous gel, and also between mucins and components used in pharmaceutical formulations. More specifically, the main objectives were (I) to investigate the possibility to assemble multilayer films with mucins and oppositely charged polymers or proteins on solid substrates; (II) to evaluate mucoadhesive proper-ties of drug delivery particles by examination of their interactions with mucins. The construction of multilayer films was performed on silica and <b>hydrophobized</b> silica <b>surfaces</b> by alternate adsorption, and the adsorbed amount and thickness of the films were measured in situ by time resolved ellipsometry. It was demonstrated that films could be assembled using mucins in combination with both chitosan and lactoperoxidase. The build-up was characterized by adsorption and redissolution processes, and the extent of redissolution could be explained by taking the charge densities and concentrations of the components into account. It was also demonstrated that the nature of the substrate can be crucial for the possibilities to assemble multilayer films, and from the results it may be concluded that a high amount of mucin in the first step is important for successful layer-by-layer assembly. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that lactoperoxidase is catalytically active when adsorbed to mucin layers, and it may thereby exert its antimicrobial action. The evaluation of mucoadhesive properties of drug delivery particles was performed with lipid nanoparticles stabilized by a poly(ethylene oxide) based polymer and with particles modified by chitosan. Both types of model particles (unmodified and chitosan modified) were investigated by measuring their adsorption to mucin-coated silica surfaces by ellipsometry. It was shown that the binding of unmodified particles to mucin-coated silica surfaces was weak and pH-dependent. Based on the pH and electrolyte dependence of the adsorption, it was proposed that the interaction is mediated by hydrogen bonding between protonated carboxyl groups in the mucin molecule and oxygen atoms in poly(ethylene oxide). Chitosan modified particles, on the other hand, showed a substantial and strong binding to mucin-coated surfaces, which can probably be attributed to interactions between amino groups in chitosan and negatively charged groups in the mucin layer. The findings from the present investigations are in agreement with previous reports on the interaction of mucins with poly(ethylene oxide) and chitosan. It can therefore be concluded that the methodology applied is useful for evaluating mucoadhesive properties of nanoparticles...|$|R
