5|$|At birth {{the lungs}} are very undeveloped with only around one sixth of the alveoli {{of the adult}} lung present. The alveoli {{continue}} to form <b>into</b> <b>early</b> adulthood, {{and their ability to}} form when necessary is seen in the regeneration of the lung. Alveolar septa have a double capillary network instead of the single network of the developed lung. Only after the maturation of the capillary network can the lung enter a normal phase of growth. Following the early growth in numbers of alveoli there is another stage of the alveoli being enlarged.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of Erika's classification, {{forecast}} models diverged significantly on the potential future of Erika. Statistical guidance and the HWRF depicted a hurricane while the ECMWF and GFS showed a weaker system due to increasing wind shear. The models that intensified the storm indicated a more northerly track while those that kept it weaker had the system continuing along a westward course. Accordingly, the NHC noted low confidence in their five-day forecast for Erika. This uncertainty ultimately reflected in above-average forecast errors when compared to all tropical cyclones, but roughly average for weak, poorly organized systems. Throughout August25 and <b>into</b> <b>early</b> August26, the convective organization of Erika fluctuated due to wind shear and entrainment of dry air, periodically leaving the center of circulation devoid of convection.|$|E
5|$|By the 19th century, Victorian {{scholars}} such as William Stubbs, James Ramsay, and William Hunt {{sought to}} understand how the English political system had evolved under Henry. They explored the emergence of Parliamentary institutions during his reign, and sympathized with the concerns of the chroniclers over the role of the Poitevins in England. This focus carried on <b>into</b> <b>early</b> 20th-century research into Henry, such as Kate Norgate's 1913 volume, which continued to make heavy use of the chronicler accounts and focused primarily on constitutional issues, with a distinctive nationalistic bias.|$|E
