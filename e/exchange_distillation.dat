40|$|Key words: boron isotope; {{pyrolysis}} reaction; isotope abundance Abstract：Nowadays in China, excessive {{import of}} boron isotope {{has always been}} the bottleneck to its industrial applications in nuclear, mechanical, steel and electronic fields. To pull the boron industry out of the mire of import, it is prerequisite to study the enriching and refining of boron isotope. In this work, we present an experimental setup of boron isotope separation by chemical <b>exchange</b> <b>distillation</b> with focus on pyrolysis reaction. After repeated tests, the optimal temperature of pyrolysis reaction (i. e., 140 o C) had been found and the best enrichment of 10 B (i. e., 34. 4 %) could be achieved when the reaction continued to the 8 th day. These results indicate that the more completely the pyrolysis reaction performs, the better enrichment o...|$|E

40|$|Abstract The overall {{reason for}} {{investigating}} intermediate heat <b>exchange</b> in diabatic <b>distillation</b> is to enable {{a reduction in}} external energy demand. This thesis applies computer simulations and experimental measurements to evaluate and analyse the use of intermediate heat <b>exchange</b> in binary <b>distillation.</b> The use of intermediate heat exchange has been studied in a stand-alone distillation unit as a method to improve the energetic performance of distillation. Considerable external energy savings can theoretically be achieved by using different intermediate heat exchange arrangements. The way the intermediate heat exchange is performed {{in terms of a}} combination of positions for side stream withdrawal and side stream return has a clear impact on the column performance. In a real column with constant number of trays and constant separation an optimisation of the intermediate heat exchange will generate increased efficiencies locally together with improved separation. Some parts will run closer to reversibility than other parts. A new type of experimental equipment has been constructed to enable pilot plant scale diabatic distillation experiments in both the rectifying section {{as well as in the}} stripping section...|$|R

By-products {{in the form of}} gaseous and liquid oxygen as well as small quantities of liquid nitrogen are formed. Five basic unit operations make the air separation process which are namely; air compression, air purification, heat <b>exchange,</b> liquefaction and <b>distillation.</b> Nitrogen is compressed to 30 bar prior to export to the ammonia making plant.|$|R
40|$|The solvent {{extraction}} of Os from geological samples digested in aqua regia has been investigated. A straightforward procedure {{has been developed}} in which OsO 4 is partitioned directly from the aqua regia digest solution into an organic phase, either CCl 4 or CHCl 3, and is then recovered by back extraction into concentrated HBr. Following a simple micro-distillation step, the purified sample is ready for thermal ionisation mass spectrometry (TIMS). This new approach avoids hightemperature fusion, ion <b>exchange</b> or large-scale <b>distillation</b> techniques, while {{the simplicity of the}} handling procedures and the potential use of small reagent volumes ensures that blank contributions are kept to a minimum...|$|R
40|$|The process {{intensification}} (PI) technique involves changing a tower?s internals and operating mode and the separate {{movement of the}} liquid and vapor phases. This can significantly increase column throughput and reduce energy requirements, while improving separation performance. PI {{is a set of}} innovative principles for enhancing the driving forces and synergistic effects in a process to obtain: dramatic reductions in the size of a plant needed to achieve a production objective, significant increases in the production capacity within a given equipment volume, a step reduction in energy usage per ton of product, or a marked cut in the formation of wastes and byproducts. PI encompasses recognized technologies in reactor engineering, heat <b>exchange,</b> mixing, and <b>distillation.</b> Particularly in distillation systems, PI has received much attention, with the aim of increasing both energy and separation efficiency...|$|R
40|$|Presence of Zinc (II) in {{drinking}} water beyond permissible limits is considered unsafe for human health. Many different anthropogenic activities including mining, burning of petroleum, industrialization, and urbanization cause a release of considerably higher amounts of zinc into the waterbodies. A permissible limit of 5 mg/L is set by various environmental and pollution control authorities beyond which water may cause respiratory, liver, gonads, and brain disorders. Due to these health hazards, {{it is important to}} remove exceeding amounts of zinc from drinking water. Zinc enters drinking water from various sources such as corrosive pipelines, release of industrial effluents, and metal leaching. Different biological and physiochemical techniques are used to remove zinc involving chemical precipitation, ion <b>exchange,</b> adsorption, biosorbents, <b>distillation,</b> ozonation, and membrane filtration technology. Among these technologies, physical process of adsorption using low cost adsorbents is not only economical but abundant, efficient, and easily available. In present review different physiochemical and biological techniques are discussed for the removal of Zinc from drinking water...|$|R
5|$|The heavy isotope 15N {{was first}} {{discovered}} by S. M. Naudé in 1929, soon after heavy isotopes of the neighbouring elements oxygen and carbon were discovered. It presents {{one of the}} lowest thermal neutron capture cross-sections of all isotopes. It is frequently used in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to determine the structures of nitrogen-containing molecules, due to its fractional nuclear spin of one-half, which offers advantages for NMR such as narrower line width. 14N, though also theoretically usable, has an integer nuclear spin of one and thus has a quadrupole moment that leads to wider and less useful spectra. 15N NMR nevertheless has complications not encountered in the more 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy. The low natural abundance of 15N (0.36%) significantly reduces sensitivity, a problem which is only exacerbated by its low gyromagnetic ratio, (only 10.14% that of 1H). As a result, the signal-to-noise ratio for 1H is about 300 times as much as that for 15N at the same magnetic field strength. This may be somewhat alleviated by isotopic enrichment of 15N by chemical <b>exchange</b> or fractional <b>distillation.</b> 15N-enriched compounds have the advantage that under standard conditions, they do not undergo chemical exchange of their nitrogen atoms with atmospheric nitrogen, unlike compounds with labelled hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen isotopes that must be kept away from the atmosphere. The 15N:14N ratio is commonly used in stable isotope analysis in the fields of geochemistry, hydrology, paleoclimatology and paleoceanography, where it is called δ15N.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{the nuclear}} {{reactors}} using uranium as fuel and heavy water as moderator, after a while, {{due to increased}} tritium concentration as result of neutrons capture on deuterium nucleus, we have to establish a set of measures to decrease the tritium concentration. The amount of tritium obtained in a CANDU reactor is about 2, 4 KCi/MW. The experimental plant realise the separation and extraction of tritium from tritiated heavy water at 30 Ci/kg (for a higher concentration will be diluted at that level). The tritium request in the USA was 4 * 106 Ci in 1980; in Romania was 2 * 104 Ci in 1990, 3 * 104 in 2000 {{and will continue to}} increase. On present times the price for tritium is estimated at about 2 $/Ci[1] on international market and increasing. This is due to growing and continues diversification of application fields; nuclear medicine, nuclear fusion, research labs.

Valcea, as principal target have to establish the technology of the waterhydrogen catalyzed isotopic <b>exchange</b> and cryogenic <b>distillation</b> for mixtures of hydrogen and his isotopes diatomic species. The main target of the experimental pilot plant is to establish the detritiation technology of CANDU reactor moderator and to certify the equipments specific for cryogenic domain and tritiated mediums.

40|$|There {{has been}} a growing {{interest}} in {{renewable sources of energy}} due to an increase in demand and potential shortages and environmental problems associated with fossil fuels. Bio-oils, complex liquid fuels produced from fast pyrolysis of biomass, have been recognized as one potential source of renewable energy. However, they cannot be utilized directly due to their high viscosity, corrosiveness, and high char content. Bio-oils readily phase separate into aqueous phase and organic phase upon addition of water. The aqueous fraction of bio oil (AFBO) is convenient to process and contains sugars, organic acids, hydroxyacetone, hydroxyacetaldehyde, furfural, phenols and other organic species that can potentially be converted to hydrogen, alkanes, aromatics, or olefins. However, the acidity of AFBO (pH ~ 2. 5) is relatively high due to the presence of organic acids which can impose more demands on construction equipment of the vessels and the upgrading process. Removal of acids is essential to use AFBO as a commercial fuel or further upgrading into fuels or chemicals. Traditional separation techniques for the removal of acids from AFBO, like ion <b>exchange</b> and <b>distillation</b> are not attractive due to practical limitations. Membrane-based separations have been increasingly employed due to their inherent advantages over conventional separations methods. Pressure driven membrane processes like nanofiltration (NF) and reverse osmosis (RO) have been used in chemical, electronics, textile, petrochemical, pulp and paper, and food industries {{as well as for the}} treatment of municipal wastewater and landfill leachates. However, these processes are targeted for aqueous systems containing little or no organic solvents. The use of membranes to separate organic solvent solutions or organic-rich aqueous solutions is still at a very early stage. The feasibility of removing small organic acids from the AFBO using NF and RO membranes was studied. Experiments were conducted with commercially available polymeric NF and RO membranes and aqueous solutions of increasing complexity, i. e. single solute solutions of acetic acid and glucose, binary solute solutions containing both acetic acid and glucose, and a model AFBO containing acetic acid, glucose, formic acid, hydroxyacetone, furfural, guaiacol, and catechol. Feed concentrations (up to 34 % solute by weight) close to those in real AFBO were chosen. These were generally at least an order of magnitude higher than previously studied in the literature for related membrane separations. Retention factors for single and binary solutions of acetic acid and glucose were promising so that the separation was expected to be feasible. However, all the membranes were irreversibly damaged when experiments were conducted with the model AFBO due to the presence of guaiacol in the feed solution. Experiments with model AFBO excluding guaiacol were also conducted. NF membranes showed retention factors of glucose greater than 80 % and of acetic acid less than - 15 % when operated at transmembrane pressures near 60 bar. Finally, the solution-diffusion (SD) model was applied to predict the permeate flux and solute retention and compared to the experimental results. In another study, we explored the potential of nanocomposite membranes in gas separations. Solubility based membrane gas separation, in which the more soluble (and perhaps slower-diffusing) species preferentially permeates through the membranes, has received considerable attention due to both economic and environmental concerns. In this work, we synthesized organic-inorganic nanocomposite membranes by decorating the surfaces of commercially available alumina substrates with a selective organic material that is physically or chemically anchored to the porous surfaces. Hyperbranched melamine-based dendrimers and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) were used as filling agents. Separation factors for propane/nitrogen and carbon dioxide/methane were obtained for modified membranes. The separation performance of PDMS-alumina composite membranes was comparable to the currently best known polymers being used for this type of application...|$|R
30|$|Existing {{methods of}} water {{purification}} are very diverse and {{are based on}} processes such as reverse osmosis, ion <b>exchange,</b> adsorption, ultra-filtration, <b>distillation</b> and photo-oxidation. The majority of them, however, have limitations, mainly high energy consumption and low efficiency. So {{it is necessary to}} develop a water purification system using locally available raw materials in the rural and peri-urban areas. In most of the conventional water treatment methods, alum and polyaluminum chloride are used for turbidity removal. The ion exchange is widely used for the removal of permanent hardness of water. These methods are not cost-effective, and in addition to that, the usage of aluminum in treatment units induces Alzheimer’s disease (Ndabigengesere et al. 1995; Muyibi 1998; Crapper et al. 1973; Suet and Wing 1992). Research on natural coagulants has shown that Moringa oleifera seed is a natural coagulant aids in hardness, turbidity (50 – 90 %) and bacteria removal (Vijay et al. 2012; Yarahmadi et al. 2009; Sotheeswaran et al. 2011; Nwaiwu and Moses 2010; Mustapha 2013; Eman et al. 2010; Egbuikwem and Sangodoyin 2013; Mangale et al. 2012; Olayemi 1994; Dalen et al. 2009). The seeds are proven to be good in the removal of chemical oxygen demand (COD) also (Emelie et al. 2008). Moringa is a tropical tree which naturally grows in India, Africa, Central and South America (Malusare and Milind 2011; Fahey 2005; Anjorin et al. 2010; Vinoth et al. 2012). It contains chemical constituents such as alkaloids, tannins, flavonoids, carbohydrates, amino acids, fatty acid glycosides (Nilani et al. 2012; Stavros and John 2002). Also it was proved that Moringa oleifera together with sand filtration exhibited an improvement in drinking water in developing countries by removing 97 % turbidity and 89 % Escherichia coli (E. coli). Though this method of clarifying is being followed since the twentieth century (Mumuni et al. 2013), the limitations remain in controlled dosage based on pH, water quality and skilled labors for preparation of natural coagulants from plant seeds and nuts. The main drawback of this method is that the water treated in this method will have the presence of dissolved organic matter which contributes to the re-growth of pathogens and prevents the clarified water from being potable after some time (Mcullough 2012). So, the water which is clarified using this method cannot be stored. Though many studies were carried out on Moringa oleifera in the removal of turbidity and biological contaminant, the effects of storage condition on its performance are to be explored further (Muyibi et al. 2004).|$|R
30|$|Pinch {{analysis}} showed that the energy required for distillation could be reduced by 38 - 60 %, depending on the case, when implementing heat integration. The lowest reduction, 38 %, was found for the 1 G stand-alone plant. This is mainly {{the result of the}} high temperature in the rectifying reboiler (143 °C) preventing the transfer of heat from other streams in the process to the reboiler because of the lower temperatures {{in the rest of the}} process. The highest energy reduction in distillation, 60 %, was found for the 2 G stand-alone plant. Part of the energy demand was covered by utilizing condensing steam from the pretreatment step. The corresponding values for the co-located plant with heat integration and the combined plant with heat integration were 52 % and 42 %, respectively. The energy required to heat the distillation feed in the combined heat integrated plant was almost zero, and for the other cases the reductions were 64 - 81 %. These reductions were partly the result of heat exchange between the stillage streams and the feed streams. The energy required to heat the feed stream to the evaporation unit was also greatly reduced for the 1 G and 2 G stand-alone plants with heat integration, being 82 % and 90 %, respectively. For the combined plant the reduction was only 8 % after heat integration, and for the co-located plant it was about 30 %. No heat reduction was observed in the evaporation stage. The reason for this was mainly the high temperature of 129 °C in the first effect, which limited the amount of available streams that could transfer energy to the evaporator stage. The condensing streams that could have been used for heat exchange in these cases were primarily chosen to supply the distillation stage with energy. Therefore, utilities had to be supplied to the evaporation stage. For the high-temperature condensing streams the primary options for heat <b>exchange</b> are in <b>distillation,</b> evaporation and in the dryer (but also, to some degree, the feed streams) since these steps are operated at the highest temperatures. Therefore, it is important to investigate the complete process to obtain a good overview of all the heat sources and heat sinks in the system. A large amount of energy must be dissipated at low temperature because of the low pressure in the last evaporation step, where the overhead vapor has a temperature of 63 °C. This energy could partly be recovered with MVR, as investigated by Fujimoto et al. [28] and Sassner et al. [20]. Part of the steam could possibly also be used to replace some of the live steam in the liquefaction step.|$|R
40|$|The {{available}} instrumental {{methods for}} platinum group element (PGE: Ru, Rh, Pd, Os, Ir, Pt) and gold (Au) determinations are reviewed. Inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) and ICP-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) enable rapid, multi-elemental analysis, their instrumental and analytical characteristics being discussed here. The suitability of ICP techniques to quantitatively determine the PGEs + Au is demonstrated. The detection limits by ICP-AES range from 6 to 29 ng. mL[sup]- 1, while those for ICP-MS range from 0. 3 to 0. 22 ng. mL[sup]- 1, {{for the individual}} PGEs + Au. A digestion step is generally required prior {{to the analysis of}} geological materials by ICP-AES and/or ICP-MS. Digestion procedures are reviewed, with particular attention to the new method of microwave digestion. A comparative study of three digestion methods was undertaken, a range of well-characterised rock reference materials being used to evaluate open acid digestion, microwave acid digestion and alkali fusion procedures. The precision and accuracy of results obtained by ICP-AES and ICP-MS for 46 elements demonstrates that no single digestion method is universally applicable. It is concluded that the best digestion procedure for PGE-bearing materials is a combination of microwave acid digestion followed by a fusion of the residue. Such a method was developed and its suitability is demonstrated using reference materials containing high levels of the PGEs + Au, which enable their direct determination by solution ICP-MS. Even with the superior sensitivity of ICP-MS, low concentrations of the PGEs + Au in most geological materials preclude the quantitation of unseparated samples. Separation methods which have been used (fire assay, coprecipitation, ion <b>exchange,</b> solvent extraction, <b>distillation)</b> are reviewed. Two ion-exchange methods were developed to separate the PGEs + Au from their associated matrix elements allowing their preconcentration prior to analysis. An anion-exchange method can be used in conjunction with ICP-MS for the separation and determination of ≥ 1 ng. g[sup]- 1 Ir and> 1 [mu]g. g[sup]- 1 Ru, Rh, Pd, Pt or Au. A cation-exchange ICP-MS procedure can be used to determine the PGEs at a wider range of concentrations. An evaluation using all the available PGE reference materials showed good agreement with reference values in most instances. Stable isotopes were used to evaluate this method and the results confirm that quantitative results may be obtained. The cation-exchange procedure can be scaled-up to larger samples thus enabling the determination of < 1 ng. mL[sup]- 1 of individual PGEs. This is demonstrated using 5 g sub-samples and guidelines are given for further increases in sample size. Slurry nebulisation ICP-MS was developed for the determination of the PGEs + Au in solid samples without a prior digestion stage. An assessment of the method using reference materials demonstrated that quantitative results may be obtained for all seven PGEs + Au at levels above 50 to 200 ng. g[sup]- 1 (depending on the element). This method is ideally suited to the routine analysis of mineralised samples or where only small sample sizes are available...|$|R
