When I had finished, I prepared Punch's dinner--a large plateful of bones and tidbits. I went outside to give it to him. Now it happened that a visitor had ridden over from a neighboring ranch, and with him had come a Newfoundland dog as big as a calf. I set the plate on the ground. Punch wagged his tail and began. He had before him a blissful half-hour at least. There was a sudden rush. Punch was brushed aside like a straw in the path of a cyclone, and that Newfoundland swooped down upon the plate. In spite of his huge maw he must have been trained to quick lunches, for, in the fleeting instant before he received the kick in the ribs I aimed at him, he completely engulfed the contents of the plate. He swept it clean. One last lingering lick of his tongue removed even the <b>grease</b> <b>stains.</b>|$|E

On the other hand, electronic touch panels have a problem such as deterioration of visibility of the screen by finger <b>grease</b> <b>stain.</b> To solve these problems, we need to fabricate the anti-stain surfaces which have superhydrophobic and oil-repellent abilities without spoiling the transparency of the transparent substrate. In this study, we fabricated lotus leaves like surface on a glass substrate. Firstly, SiO 2 particles of ca. 100 nm diameter were arranged on the glass substrates. Secondly, to obtain the fractal-like structure (ultra-micro-rough structure) on the surface, ZnO thin film having a columnar structure was fabricated on the SiO 2 particles by using an atmospheric pressure cold plasma deposition system. By using these processes, the ZnO columns formed radiantly on the spherical surface of the SiO 2 particles. Furthermore, without spoiling the ultra-micro-rough structure, a transparent anti-stain monolayer with low surface energy was prepared by using a chemical adsorption technique onto the surface. Average value of the water droplet contact angles of the samples fabricated was 151. 8 deg. Field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) observation reviled that this sample has a raspberry structure in which columnar structure has grown radially on the SiO 2 particles...|$|R

2500|$|Rabbi Johanan {{called his}} {{garments}} [...] "my honor." [...] Rabbi Aha bar Abba said in Rabbi Johanan's name that [...] "And he shall put off his garments, {{and put on}} other garments," [...] teaches that a change of garments {{is an act of}} honor in the Torah. And the School of Rabbi Ishmael taught that the Torah teaches us manners: In the garments in which one cooked a dish for one's master, one should not pour a cup of wine for one's master. Rabbi Hiyya bar Abba said in Rabbi Johanan's name that it is a disgrace for a scholar {{to go out into the}} marketplace with patched shoes. The Gemara objected that Rabbi Aha bar Hanina went out that way; Rabbi Aha son of Rav Nachman clarified that the prohibition is of patches upon patches. Rabbi Hiyya bar Abba also said in Rabbi Johanan's name that any scholar who has a <b>grease</b> <b>stain</b> on a garment is worthy of death, for Wisdom says in [...] "All they that hate me ( [...] , mesanne'ai) love (merit) death," [...] and we should read not , mesanne'ai, but , masni'ai (that make me hated, that is, despised). Thus a scholar who has no pride in personal appearance brings contempt upon learning. Ravina taught that this was stated about a thick patch (or others say, a bloodstain). The Gemara harmonized the two opinions by teaching that one referred to an outer garment, the other to an undergarment. Rabbi Hiyya bar Abba also said in Rabbi Johanan's name that in [...] "As my servant Isaiah walked naked and barefoot," [...] "naked" [...] means in worn-out garments, and [...] "barefoot" [...] means in patched shoes.|$|R

There {{are a number}} of different classes of POPs including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), which were once used for their non-flammability and chemical stability in things like transformers, insulation, and other electrical products; polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), which are flame-retardants that are used in a variety of foam and plastic products, including flooring, furniture, and electronics; perfluorinated chemicals (PFCs), which make everyday products like cookware, mattresses, and carpets resistant to <b>stains,</b> <b>grease,</b> and water; polybrominated biphenyls (PBBs), which are non-flammable chemicals that were once used in things like televisions, computer monitors, and textiles; and organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), which are used for mosquito control and agriculture. Many POPs do not degrade, or break down easily, and thus they persist for many years, even decades, in the environment. Thus, even POPs whose production has been banned pose continued threats to human health. POPs can easily travel long distances through the air before being deposited, and can thus be found all over the world.

50|$|Historically, cycling shorts {{were made}} of knit black wool, which hides oil and <b>grease</b> <b>stains,</b> with a chamois leather padding inside the shorts in the crotch area, which reduces chafing from the bicycle saddle. Modern cycling shorts are often made of spandex (Lycra) with a {{synthetic}} chamois which acts as an elastic interface between the cyclist's body and the saddle, and are produced {{in a variety of}} shapes and styles to suit the needs of different riders. On some cycling shorts different materials are often placed on different parts of the shorts to take advantage of each materials benefit providing a very efficicent cycling short. For example, the patterns used for the chamois on women's cycling shorts tend to be quite different from those used for men's. The hem of each leg is usually lined with elastic and/or silicone that clings to the skin, keeping it in a fixed position. These shorts made from several panels (or cuts of fabric) fit better and are more beneficial, especially for racers, but cost more.|$|E

40|$|Background: Lipases {{are used}} in {{detergent}} industries to minimise the use of phosphate-based chemicals in detergent formulations. The use of lipase in household laundry reduces environmental pollution and enhances the ability of detergent to remove tough oil or <b>grease</b> <b>stains.</b> Results: A lipase-producing indigenous Bacillus subtilis strain [accession no. KT 985358] was isolated from the foothills of Trikuta mountain in Jammu and Kashmir, India. The lipase (BSK-L) produced by this strain expressed alkali and thermotolerance. Lipase has an optimal activity at pH  8. 0 and temperature 37 °C, whereas it is stable at pH  6. 0 – 9. 0 and showed active lipolytic activity at temperatures 30 to 60 °C. Furthermore, lipase activity {{was found to be}} stimulated {{in the presence of the}} metal ions Mn 2 +, K+, Zn 2 +, Fe 2 + and Ca 2 +. This lipase was resistant to surfactants, oxidising agents and commercial detergents, suggesting it as a potential candidate for detergent formulation. BSK-L displayed noticeable capability to remove oil stains when used in different washing solutions containing buffer, lipase and commercial detergent. The maximum olive oil removal percentage obtained was 68 % when the optimum detergent concentration (Fena) was 0. 3 %. The oil removal percentage from olive oil-soiled cotton fabric increased with 40  U/mL of lipase. Conclusions: This BSK-L enzyme has the potential for removing oil stains by developing a pre-soaked solution for detergent formulation and was compatible with surfactants, oxidising agents and commercial detergents...|$|E
40|$|Interest in {{sustainable}} development has increased throughout society {{during the past}} decades, and the chemical industry is no exception. The appeal for renewable raw materials has consequently increased and has {{paved the way for}} the implementation of industrial biotechnology. Since enzymes are used to convert biomass in nature, they may also be a good choice in the chemical industry. However, to identify if the use of enzymes is the best alternative for a particular application they must be evaluated. Investigations can be carried out on the enzyme itself, the reaction, the reactor design or the complete process. Analyses of the environmental impact and the economics of the process are also important. The focus of the interdisciplinary research programme Greenchem at Lund University is to develop speciality chemicals from renewable raw materials using enzymes as catalysts. The work presented in this thesis was focused on the reactor and the process, rather than the catalyst itself, or a specific reaction, as those have been covered in other projects within Greenchem. Lipases are among the most extensively studied enzymes. Candida antarctica lipase B (CalB), which can be used to catalyse several different reactions, is one example. This enzyme was most frequently used in the work described in this thesis, usually in an immobilised preparation, Novozym® 435 (N 435). In the initial study presented in this thesis, four wax esters were produced and tested regarding their applicability as wood coatings. Unfortunately, even the best of these waxes showed too low resistance to <b>grease</b> <b>stains.</b> Towards the end of this work a new study was initiated; acrylation of polymers to be used as the main component in lacquers, with the hope of achieving better resistance than that achieved with the wax esters. These acrylates were produced on litre-scale via lipase-catalysed trans-esterification between ethyl acrylate and polyesters and polyethers, respectively, and were found to be comparable to the commercial alternatives available today. A biolubricant, trimethylolpropane (TMP) oleate, was produced via esterification using the same lipase preparation, as well as epoxidised rapeseed methyl ester (RME) through chemo-enzymatic epoxidation. Several parameters must be considered when setting up a biocatalytic process. Water activity is one of them, and a system for water activity control was developed using wax ester synthesis as a model reaction. The system consisted of a sensor, a control unit and the facility to bubble air through the reactor, either dry or saturated with water, to decrease or increase the humidity in the reactor. The optimum water activity for esterification using N 435 was determined and found to be close to zero. For comparison, an immobilised lipase from Candida rugosa was used, and this preparation was found to work best at higher water activities, i. e. above 0. 5. By-product removal is another important parameter, and this was accomplished by evaporation through bubbling air through the reactor in wax ester synthesis, or by vacuum in the synthesis of acrylates and TMP oleate. The stability of the enzyme and the performance of the processes were investigated by varying different parameters. In the acrylation reaction half-lives of up to 320 h were achieved for two different CalB preparations, which resulted in reasonable catalyst costs for the process. However, when using N 435 for TMP oleate synthesis, the process was not viable due to the combination of the long reaction times required at moderate temperatures and the relatively low stability of the enzyme (~ 90 h half-life). The stability of the biocatalyst was also found to be too low for an economically feasible production of epoxidised RME, although it could be enhanced by appropriate process design. Productivity and enzyme stability were investigated in different reactor designs, and it was found to be crucial to maintain the hydrogen peroxide concentration at a low, controlled level in order to prolong the life-time of the biocatalyst. The work presented in this thesis shows the direct applicability of biocatalysis to some processes such as the acrylation reaction, which has been proven to be competitive with traditional chemical production methods. In other cases, further development regarding choice of biocatalyst, reaction medium and process design are needed. One of the most important factors in investigations regarding industrial biotechnology is the enzyme stability, as this determines the possibility of implementing the process on an industrial scale...|$|E
