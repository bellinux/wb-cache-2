5|$|Similar {{damage is}} being done today to the {{semi-arid}} areas that rim deserts and about twelve million hectares of land are being turned to desert each year. Desertification is caused by such factors as drought, climatic shifts, tillage for agriculture, overgrazing and deforestation. Vegetation {{plays a major role}} in determining the composition of the soil. In many environments, the rate of erosion and run off increases dramatically with reduced vegetation cover. Unprotected dry surfaces tend to be blown away by the wind or be washed away by flash floods, leaving <b>infertile</b> <b>soil</b> layers that bake in the sun and become unproductive hardpan. Although overgrazing has historically been considered to be a cause of desertification, there is some evidence that wild and domesticated animals actually improve fertility and vegetation cover, and that their removal encourages erosive processes.|$|E

25|$|In {{the ensuing}} centuries, Iceland {{became one of}} the poorest {{countries}} in Europe. <b>Infertile</b> <b>soil,</b> volcanic eruptions, deforestation and an unforgiving climate made for harsh life in a society where subsistence depended almost entirely on agriculture. The Black Death swept Iceland twice, first in 1402–1404 and again in 1494–1495. The former outbreak killed 50% to 60% of the population, and the latter 30% to 50%.|$|E

25|$|Until recently, {{the people}} of Kiribati mostly lived in villages with populations between 50 and 3,000 on the outer islands. Most houses are made of {{materials}} obtained from coconut and pandanus trees. Frequent droughts and <b>infertile</b> <b>soil</b> hinder reliable large-scale agriculture, so the islanders have largely turned to the sea for livelihood and subsistence. Most are outrigger sailors and fishermen. Copra plantations serve as a second source of employment. In recent years large numbers of citizens have moved to the more urban island capital of Tarawa. Increasing urbanisation has raised the population of South Tarawa to 50,182.|$|E
25|$|The geology of the Lizard {{peninsula}} is unusual, {{in that it}} is mainland Britain's only {{example of}} an ophiolite, a section of oceanic crust now found on land. Much of the peninsula consists of the dark green and red Precambrian serpentinite, which forms spectacular cliffs, notably at Kynance Cove, and carved and polished serpentine ornaments are sold in local gift shops. This ultramafic rock also forms a very <b>infertile</b> <b>soil</b> which covers the flat and marshy heaths of the interior of the peninsula. This is home to rare plants, such as the Cornish Heath, which has been adopted as the county flower.|$|E
25|$|The Noongar peoples had variously, {{according}} to their territory, to adapt to four different Mediterranean-type climatic zones, with dry spells varying from as low as 3 to as high as 11months. Tribes were spread over three different geological systems: the coastal plains, the plateau, and the plateau margins, all areas characterized by relatively <b>infertile</b> <b>soil.</b> The north was characterized by casuarina, acacia and melaleuca thickets, the south by mulga scrubland but it also supported dense forest stands. Several rivers ran to the coast and with lakes and wetlands provided the Noongar with their distinctive food and vegetation resources, depend on locality.|$|E

2500|$|Spanish wines (...) are wines {{produced}} in Spain. Located on the Iberian Peninsula, Spain has over 2.9million acres (over 1.17million hectares) plantedmaking {{it the most}} widely planted wine producing nation {{but it is the}} third largest producer of wine in the world, the largest being France followed by Italy. This is due, in part, to the very low yields and wide spacing of the old vines planted on the dry, <b>infertile</b> <b>soil</b> found in many Spanish wine regions. The country is ninth in worldwide consumptions with Spaniards drinking, on average, 21.6 litres (5.706 US gal) per person a year. The country has an abundance of native grape varieties, with over 400 varieties planted throughout Spain though 80 percent of the country's wine production is from only 20 grapesincluding the reds Tempranillo, Garnacha, and Monastrell; the whites Albariño from Galicia, Palomino, Airen, and Macabeo; and the three cava grapes Parellada, Xarel·lo, and Macabeo.|$|E

40|$|Beans do {{not appear}} {{inherently}} suited to <b>infertile</b> <b>soils.</b> A diagnostic effort to define and evaluate soil constraints in African bean production is needed. We suggest bean BNF is host- plant limited, and that BNF in short-season bean is due to inadequate C and N dynamics in the bean plant. In <b>infertile</b> <b>soils,</b> improved host-plant resistance to edaphic stresses may improve BNF. Several studies indicate that heritable variation exists in bean with regard to resistance to low soil P. Additional promising avenues of research on resistance to low soil P include mycorrhizal symbiosis, rhizosphere modification and root morphology. For nutritional characteristics, specific physiological traits may be more fruitful selection criteria than plant vigour and yield. Mechanistic research on Ca deficiency, Al toxicity and P deficiency would be useful in defining traits {{to be used in}} breeding improved bean materials for <b>infertile</b> African <b>soils.</b> (AS...|$|R

50|$|The uplands have {{traditionally}} suffered from drought and <b>infertile</b> <b>soils,</b> weeds and plant diseases.

50|$|Three {{quarters}} of the country's land {{is made up of}} latosol, a reddish, mineral-rich but <b>infertile</b> <b>soil</b> found in tropical rainforest.
