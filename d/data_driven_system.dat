This {{can be done with}} general purpose proces-sors (PCs), digital signal processors (DSPs), or more recently with field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). In a computational neuroscience system that will interact with neural data recorded in real-time, clas-sifying action potentials, commonly referred to as spike sorting, is an important step in this process. A comparison was made between using a PC, DSPs, and FPGAs to train a spike sorting system using Gaussian Mixture Models. The results show that FPGAs can significantly outper-formed PCs or DSPs by embedding algorithms directly in hardware. ...|$|E

40|$|This {{collaborative}} inquiry {{documents the}} experiences of five secondary school teachers who worked together to improve teaching and learning by developing a Literacy Inquiry Team. The {{purpose of this study}} was to explore connections between teacher leadership and school improvement, specifically by attempting to improve literacy instruction through collaborative, teacher-led initiatives. The collected data documents our collaborative planning, instructional changes, as well as our perceptions of our instructional improvements as the Literacy Inquiry Team moved through the seven stages of Sagor's [...] . action research process. The analysis revealed that teachers in a wide range of subject areas can make a mental shift in their thinking to believe in the effectiveness of literacy instruction in building student capacity for learning. The findings suggest that teachers will make a larger commitment to making further instructional improvements after they see a connection between literacy instruction and deeper student learning. The findings also demonstrate that collaborative inquiry teams are an effective way for teachers to begin building shared meaning [...] . and capacity for improvement. Finally, the collected data documents my leadership growth as I led the Literacy Inquiry Team.

40|$|It is {{no secret}} that child welfare in the United States is in a {{constant}} state of crisis. Even more so, oft-forgotten higher placements such as congregate care and day treatment settings for youth tend to maintain a state of “survival mode”. St. Joseph’s Home for Children in Minneapolis is no different - staff interviews indicated high levels of burnout, turnover, and inadequate program supplies. With maintaining the status quo already being so difficult in higher placements due to these factors; it is understandable why comprehensive changes in interventions may be infrequent and difficult to implement. The purpose of the present project was to conduct a literature review of practices in congregate care and day treatment settings in order to recommend potential new practices to Catholic Charities of St. Paul and Minneapolis as a part of their strategic envisioning process for St. Joseph’s Home for Children. Higher placements for youth face a unique challenge: developing a flexible, evidence-based intervention system for a particularly high-risk population. Common themes in the lives of these youth include complex trauma, self-harm, conduct problems, and lack of developmentally-appropriate social skills. A number of practices are reviewed in the present study, including models for the treatment milieu, specific intervention procedures, models of therapy, and measures to assess children’s mental health outcomes. The review revealed that a number of evidence-based practices are available for this population, but appropriate models should be chosen depending on the characteristics (i. e. age, presenting problem) of the population. Integration of multiple evidence-based practices is recommended in order to best serve youth, and continuous evaluation of said practices and exploration of further practices is likely necessary in order to achieve and maintain improved program outcomes. Common themes within these models is the need for a social-emotional curriculum, trauma-informed care, a relationship-based system, adequate staff and system supports, use of reinforcement, reduction of punishment, preventative practice, a <b>data</b> <b>driven</b> <b>system,</b> and including input from youth. In accountability measures, the Child and Adolescent Needs and Strengths Assessment Tool (CANS) seemed to be the most cost-effective, least time-intensive measure while retaining strong psychometric properties. This report was prepared for St. Joseph’s Home for Children in Minneapolis (a division of Catholic Charities of St. Paul and Minneapolis) and its emergency shelter, residential treatment, and day treatment programs, with support from the University of Minnesota Center for Urban and Regional Affairs.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a practice-led research investigation into ways of designing more experiential and evocative interactions with data {{that relates to}} our experiences whereby less explicit, more intrinsic and aesthetic relationships are made between people, objects and data. I argue that the utilitarian values and instrumental approach behind the design of most systems that mediate our personal autobiographical data, while important, are not appropriate for more emotional forms of remembering. Therefore, systems are needed that cater specifically to modes of remembering such as reminiscence and reflection. By learning from our material encounters with memory, there are rich opportunities for design to uncover the latent values that might exist in biographical data. To articulate the design rationale of the thesis, I describe two existing design projects: the Digital Slide Viewer and Photobox. These provide some design principles that offer guidance in making memory data physical so as to encourage meaningful material practices, and ways that interactions might be designed to promote reflection. After exploratory interviews to gather insight into the ways people associate meaning with objects a set of designed provocations were produced. The Poker Chip sought to understand the ways that the material form of an object connects to its meaning, while The Bowl investigates how the actions we might use to make these meaningful objects might in themselves be meaningful. The final designed provocation takes ideas from its predecessors, and puts them into practice with a <b>data</b> <b>driven</b> <b>system.</b> By responding to live data from real earthquakes, the Earthquake Shelf creates a tangible rendition that, by damaging objects, leaves behind material evidence of a remote event. During a long-term field deployment, connection between the objects on the shelf and the participant’s memories proved illusive, but the shelf itself provided a viscerally real connection to a past experience. The outcome of this thesis then is to articulate Experiential Manufacturing; {{a position on the}} design of technologies intended to mediate more emotional forms of memory, such that they can create more compelling relations between data, people, and things. It does this by first opening and exploring a design space based on alternative values for designing technologies of reminiscence that mediate our life experiences. By prioritizing the aesthetic elements of the experiences, rather than focusing on the data that describes it, this thesis explores the potential of material, liveness and slowness to create systems that mediate our experience data in more evocative and emotionally valuable ways. It then presents this position as a set of thematic values, or Strong Concepts at the heart of Experiential Manufacturing...|$|E

These problems are interconnected with common components: hurricane activity is aggravated by ongoing wetland erosion; water circulation models are used in hurricane forecasts, ecological planning and emergency response; environmental sensors provide information for models of different processes with varying spatial and time scales. This has prompted programs to build an integrated, comprehensive, computational framework for meteorological, coastal, and ecological models. Dynamic and adaptive capabilities are crucially important for such a framework, providing the ability to integrate coupled models with real-time sensor information, or to enable deadline based scenarios and emergency decision control systems.
