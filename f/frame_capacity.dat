50|$|Gross {{vehicle weight}} rating (GVWR) is the manufacturer's stated maximum safe {{mass of the}} motorcycle, {{including}} its own mass and everything it carries, taking into consideration the tire profile and load capacity; brake, suspension and <b>frame</b> <b>capacity.</b> It is printed on a motorcycle's VIN Plate. The difference between GVWR and wet weight is how much the motorcycle can safely carry, including fuel; the rider, passenger and their clothing; cargo; and other accessories. Using this calculation, a typical large cruiser might have a maximum useful payload of 400 lb. This is especially of interest in touring motorcycles because when comparing motorcycles ridden by the same operator and passenger, clad in the same safety clothing, the machine with the greatest difference between its GVWR and wet weight can safely bear the most additional weight; for instance, camping food and gear, extra fuel, or spare parts. It also indicates that a large rider and passenger might overload the machine even without carrying any additional load, in which case they might need two vehicles for a planned tour.|$|E

30|$|In this {{proposed}} scheme, the DL scheduler generates the MAC Protocol Data Units (MPDUs) of a DL sub-frame at the eNBs and filling a UL grant {{with the data}} of active bearers at the UEs. It also assigns signaling bearers, such as bearers carrying IMS signaling and protocol packets always having higher priority over any other data bearers. Guaranteed Bit Rate (GBR) bearers (e.g., VoLTE in this work) always have higher priority over other non-GBR bearers (e.g., Email). It {{is worth noting that}} IMS signaling is the only exception to this rule as a non-GBR bearer has higher priority over GBR bearers with QCI[*]=[*] 5 (see Table  4). For all GBR bearer traffic, and since their radio bearers are accepted only through an Admission Control (AC), then the <b>frame</b> <b>capacity</b> is expected to be sufficient to handle all of them with any remaining <b>frame</b> <b>capacity</b> given to non-GBR bearers based on their priority levels. The non-GBR bearers are then serviced based on their QCI values. If non-GBR bearers have the same QCI, then they will be serviced using a fairness scheduling algorithm and the available resources are then shared equally among these bearers and data. An exceeded traffic limit of GBR bearers may exist (if found) due to underestimation of RLC and MAC layer overheads or due to a higher than expected load from higher layers. In such cases, and to keep a reasonable level of fairness between different types of traffic, this traffic is served by the scheduler {{in the same way as}} the traffic on non-GBR bearers is served. Additionally, this procedure is applied after all the non-GBR bearers’ traffic has been handled.|$|E

Three phases of frames were tested. The first phase was conducted on individual reinforced concrete bare frame used as control frame. The second phase was conducted on two model frames representing individual reinforced frame infilled with masonry panels constructed between two columns, then constructed the top beam, and the other one constructed as bare frame and then infilled with masonry. The third phase was strengthened with different methods to improve its behavior. Glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) sheets, steel rebar impeded in frame, plastering and ferrocement meshes were used. The drift, toughness, ductility and failure load were improved by using such masonry wall due to like-shear wall effect which also increased <b>frame</b> <b>capacity</b> to resist lateral load. The ferrocement strengthening method was recommended to improve the ductility and ultimate failure loads of the existed frames. Also casting concrete of frame over the masonry “Balady” method; increases the ultimate load capacity of frame by 145 % of bare frame ultimate failure load. Also it increases its ductility and toughness by 33 % and 195 %, respectively.

40|$|Springer International Publishing AG 2018. The {{survivability}} of {{a structure}} under progressive collapse highly relies on its toughness (energy absorption prior to failure). In a 2 -D Reinforced Concrete (RC) frame for example, if catenary action is developed, {{the provision of}} greater rotational capacity at the support interface would contribute to larger deformations (improving toughness) and longer surviving time of the frame. Previous tests on 2 -D RC frames have shown that under large deformations, concrete surrounding the rebar was highly damaged due to cracking, spalling or splitting, reducing the <b>frame</b> <b>capacity.</b> It has also been realised that one way to increase the deformation limit of frames is by allowing more slip or elongation of reinforcement. Based on these two observations, alterations to the conventional reinforcement detailing are devised to improve the frame deformation capacity, i. e. provision of stirrups in accordance to seismic detailing rule to minimise concrete damage and substitution of deformed bars with round bars as longitudinal reinforcement to facilitate greater rotation and slip. Three frame specimens are presented in this paper, the first frame with conventional detailing as the control specimen (FR), the second frame with higher shear reinforcement ratio based on seismic detailing (FR-S), and the last frame with round bars as longitudinal reinforcement (FR-R). Through this study, the effects of modified detailing towards the load resistance and deformation capacity of 2 -D RC frames can be quantified...|$|E

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine whether Limit Design could be applied to low-rise unbraced concrete frames. The investigation was carried out both analytically and experimentally. In the analytical part, two mathematical models were used to determine the behavior of unbraced frames. The first method used a nonlinear computer program, which takes into account the material and geometric nonlinearities of concrete frames. Several cases of frames with different reinforcement ratios and under different beam to column load ratios were investigated. For each frame the gravity loads were increased proportionately to 3 / 4 of the ultimate <b>frame</b> <b>capacity.</b> Then, lateral load was applied to failure while keeping the beam and column loads constant. The second mathematical model solved for the frame stability equation by assuming elasto-plastic moment curvature relationships for members. Also, the stability solution was carried out by reducing the frame to a column attached to a linear spring. In the experimental part, two frames were designed for the same loading conditions but by two different methods; and were tested to failure. Frame USD- 1 was designed by the Ultimate Strength Design, while Frame LD- 1 by a Limit Design method. The columns were 21 -in high while the beam was 84 -in long. The loading procedure consisted of proportionately loading the beam and columns up to the design load, and then applying the lateral load to failure. The computer study and the stability model solution showed that frames subjected to low column thrusts remained in stable equilibrium until two plastic hinges form, thus constituting a mechanism. The two experimental frames remained in stable equilibrium until two plastic hinges formed in the beams. The ultimate lateral loads of Frames USD- 1 and LD- 1 exceeded the design lateral load by 66 % and 33 %, respectively. Based on this investigation, it appears that Limit Design may be used for low-rise unbraced reinforced concrete structures...|$|E
40|$|Increasing {{challenges}} {{with regards}} to remote fields, reservoir conditions and deep water, forces the petroleum industry to adopt new technology. A large part of this technology {{comes in the form}} of subsea equipment. Larger and heavier subsea modules are manufactured and installed in order to meet the field and reservoir conditions. Inspection, maintenance and repair (IMR) operations presents a key element in a subsea field life cycle. Lifting through moonpool is preferred when performing such an operation. A critical factor which has been identified for lifts through moonpool, is when equipment is to be docked onto the cursor frame. During the docking, relative motion between vessel and equipment can lead to large impulse loads. The structural strength of the cursor frame is seen as a limiting factor and a risk element. This is the main reason for Subsea 7 and Statoil to initiate this thesis. This thesis addresses the module handling system on Havila Subsea. Emphasize has been made on structural challenges of the cursor frame and the possibility of improvement. Both manual capacity calculations and Staad. Pro analysis has been conducted for both existing and alternative cursor frame. The loads have been applied as static loads acting on the tip of the prongs, this is to simulate a worst case scenario where the funnels are just docket at the prongs and the vessel experiences a large pitch or roll motion. The alternative cursor frame has been modeled with new and flexible prongs. The flexible prongs can deflect 5 degrees in any direction. Analysis shows that the existing cursor frame has a high structural capacity and the prongs are the cursor frame weakest members. The prongs have been proven to have a capacity of 11. 8 Te per prong. Effectively this gives a total static cursor <b>frame</b> <b>capacity</b> of 23. 6 Te. The flexible prongs have been shown to be beneficial {{with regards to}} impulse loads and fatigue.

40|$|In {{broadband}} multimedia satellite networks it {{is necessary}} to multiplex bursty streams of traffic with differing Quality of Service (QoS) requirements to maximise the utilisation of the satellite link bandwidth. Providing the desired QoS of each service, in a multi-service environment is a major challenge for satellite networks. Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) which provides hard QoS guarantees is suitable for a multi-service satellite environment. ATM has been developed as a vehicle for multimedia communications and is widely {{regarded as one of the}} most important and fastest-growing communications technology of this decade. The design of suitable traffic and congestion control algorithms is one of the most important challenge for the success of an ATM-based satellite network. This thesis develops and optimises a traffic and congestion control mechanism which can provide users the required QoS for ATM over satellite networks. In order to provide QoS differentiation for end-to-end communication it is proposed to use both loss and delay priorities, which are determined form the required Cell Loss Rate (CLR) and Cell Transfer Delay (CTD) parameters, for each service class. A multiple shared buffer scheduling (MSBS) policy considering both delay and loss priorities, is proposed and evaluated for scheduling and discarding of ATM cells. It is shown that both the CTD and CLR requirements of ATM services can be met by the MSBS scheme. A combined preventive/reactive control scheme incorporating an adaptive Leaky Bucket (LB) is investigated for the satellite environment. It has been found that reactive control improves the cell loss due to congestion for time scales larger than the propagation delay. As the satellite air interface bandwidth is currently one of the most expensive commodities in the service provision, an adaptive MAC protocol that can support the ATM service classes whilst maximising the bandwidth utilisation, is proposed and evaluated. The mapping of ATM service classes to MAC classes and the use of a prioritised request queue provides the QoS differentiation required by ATM networks. It is shown that a pure reservation system performs poorly for very bursty user traffic. The user population which can be supported using Random Access (RA) for very bursty users with short burst duration is higher. The system throughput can be maximised, by making this protocol adaptive to changing traffic characteristics.

40|$|In this thesis, an ice-induced {{damage to}} a DNV-GL {{registered}} cargo ship isinvestigated by looking into its damage survey report, and running nonlinearfinite element analyses. The analyses are used for regeneration of the damagedeformations and estimation the damage loading. The results are compared withdesign and capacity ice loads calculated from DNV-GL and IACS' rule requirementsfor the ice class of the ship studied, DNV_ICE, IACS_PC. The Finnish-Swedish Ice Class Rules (FSICR), which are adopted by DNV-GL, andthe International Association of Classification SocietiesUnified Requirements for Polar Class (IACS UR PC), are derived and explained with focus onplating and framing requirements. From the rules design loads and capacityloads for the frames in the side bow of the case study ship, are calculatedand applied to three different finite element models for analysis. The first model is a single frame with plate flange. The second istwo neighbouring frames with two tripping brackets in between. The third model is the ship side damage area. In addition to the design loads from the rules, five proposed load cases areanalyzed for the ship side model. The resulting model deformations arecompared with deformation measurements from photosgiven in the surveyor report, in order to evaluate the applied load cases. Aresemblance in the deformations indicates a load case that resembles theoriginal damage load. The analyses of the frame models with design and capacity loads form the rulesshow that the frames have {{a considerable amount of}} capacity beyond the rulecalculations. In one of the analyses a <b>frame</b> <b>capacity</b> of 15 MPa is obtained,while the design capacity is 5 MPa. For the ship side model, only one of the five proposed load cases provesto be successful. Measurements of the deformation of the model are done, and they coincide withthe photos where the deformations are large, but give a poor match elsewhere. A pressure of 6. 9 MPa over an area of 5. 8 m^ 2 is neededto reproduce the largest of the deformations seen in the photos. The ship side analysis shows that a force about ten times the FSICRdesign load, or twice the IACS PC design load, is needed to produce thedeformations seen in the photos. The large difference in the ratio for the FSICR and the IACS PCforce originate from the difference {{in the size of the}} load application area. The rules appear to present very conservative design loads, as the finiteelement analyses reveal a considerable amount of load carrying capacity beyondthe design load level. This is because the rules are derived to be conservative, hence,they are not suited for calculation of the actual capacity of a structure. For the ship side model, an ice class 3 - 5 notations higherthan the notation it is classified for is needed to withstand the damageloading, depending on how the numbers are evaluated. This implies that theship in question has been sailing in waters with ice conditions it was not designed for. Due to a lot of uncertainty related to the photo measurements, and the many assumptionsmade for the analyses' input, an uncertainty is related to the output of the analyses,and the conclusions based on these. This thesis is conducted in cooperation with DNV-GL, Tankers and Dry Cargo Section,Høvik, Norway. They supplied survey reports, ship drawings, and supervisionalong the way. The vessel documents are applied anonymously within theproduction of this report.

The present research explores the plastic response of a stiffened plate subjected to lateral ice loads. The Finite Element Method (FEM) is extensively used to study the plastic behavior of stiffened plates. In order to gain confidence in using FEM, a validation study of a full scale experiment is initially presented. Following the examination of experimental and numerical results for a loaded grillage, the report examines three separate but related questions concerning the design of ice capable stiffened panels. [...] Ship structure design normally considers single frames. This is justified because under uniform loading, all frames behave similarly - so {{it is reasonable to}} consider frames singly. In case of ice loading which is non symmetric, the symmetric boundary condition does not accurately represent the true structural behavior. The difference in load carrying capacity between frames in isolation and frames as part of a grillage, subjected to an unsymmetrical loading is studied. [...] The capacity of a stiffened plate depends on many factors - geometric properties, material properties, loading type etc. The current IACS Polar Rules for Ships contain plastic limit state models of <b>frame</b> <b>capacity.</b> These limit states are analytical 1 y derived using relatively simple energy methods and validated by finite element analyses. The contributions from large deformations and membrane stresses are ignored and hence these analytical solutions may not accurately estimate capacity of all frames. The reliable methods to estimate capacity are either to conduct a full scale experiment or a nonlinear finite element analysis. These methods are either very expensive or too complex. There is a need for a simple regression equation which can predict capacity taking into account all the non-linear behavior of the structure. There are ten factors which influence load carrying capacity of a frame. The study of ten factors at two levels (at high and low levels of each factor) requires 1024 (2 10) ANSYS analyses. A significant {{reduction in the number of}} analyses is achieved by using "design of experiments" (DOE) method. A new regression equation for estimating load carrying capacity of the frame is proposed and validated using independent FE analyses. [...] The total load carrying capacity of a stiffened plate is contributed by both shell plate and stiffener. In most situations, stiffened panels will be sensitive to buckling under axial loads. In the case of ice reinforcement, the loads are primarily normal to the shell, with minimal axial loads. The concern for frame buckling remains, although the issue is less well understood. Some stiffeners, especially those with slender webs, show a tendency to fail by local web buckling, tripping and shear buckling, causing a sudden loss of capacity and resulting in collapse of the structure. The IACS Polar Shipping Rules (URI 2) contains a requirement aimed at the prevention of web buckling by specifying a maximum web height I web thickness (h w /tw). While URI 2 employs plastic limit states, the stability ratio is based on prevention of elastic buckling. In some cases these stability requirements have a significant impact on the design.

Already in the nineties, a global study on the transition towards sustainable fishing based on twenty five casestudies emphasised the success of fisheries co-management (OECD, 1997). At the same time, there has been renewed {{interest in}} traditional systems of fisheries co-management: the fishers'corporations (prud’homies) in the French Mediterranean, the Lofoten islands fisheries, the Cofradias in Catalonia, theVan Chai system in Vietnam, the Panchayat village system from Andhra Pradesh. Some of these older systems are onlyon the fringes of co-management proper, which evidences the wide spectrum covered by co-management in the fishingliterature. Several major questions related to the co-management of fisheries are broached in this study:■ What are the terms of reference that would allow adequate intervention of each stakeholder in a co-managementsystem, {{at the level of the}} different phases and various scales (local, national, transnational) ?■ What is the relative importance of the social, economic, institutional and legal aspects of co-management, respectively?■ What are the key factors for success or failure of fisheries co-management?■ What are the main components of conditionality for co-management in terms of <b>framing,</b> <b>capacity</b> building,data and tools?■ Are the costs of co-management higher or lower than other, more centrally-managed systems?■ What lessons drawn from international experience can be applied to the SRFC region...|$|R

She was pre-fabricated at Glasgow in Scotland, disassembled, and shipped across the Atlantic in pieces that were reunited in Kingston This original vessel was 114 ft long, 19 ft wide with a depth of hold of 6 ft, drawing about 3 ft of water. Her side-mounted paddle wheels and [...] engine gave the original ship a top speed estimated at 13 mph. Her tonnage was variously stated as between 120 and 133 tons reg. (293 tons gross).

Even if capable of recognizing problems, without adequate cognitive <b>frames,</b> the <b>capacity</b> to provide solutions or identify alternatives is lost. When trying to identify the deeper roots and interconnectedness of different sorts of crises (global financial, economic and debt crises, and the ecological crisis), the relationship between globalization and democracy and democratic legitimacy needs more careful analysis at the EU level. The global crisis and transformation might enhance transnational and global consciousness and responsibility-taking as well as networking and participation. An unexpected result may open the way for de facto cosmopolitanism. Given the strong political attempts and interests to re-strengthen the nation-state, the non-linear path will be conflict ridden...|$|R
40|$|The {{capacity}} of accelerated channel is investigated for different classes of initial states. It is shown that, the capacities of the travelling channels {{depend on the}} frame in which the accelerated channels are observed in and the initial shared state between the partners. In some <b>frames,</b> the <b>capacities</b> decay as the accelerations of both qubit increase. The decay rate is larger if the partners are initially share a maximum entangled state. The possibility of using the accelerated quantum channels to perform quantum coding protocol is discussed. The amount of decoded information is quantified for different cases, where it decays as the partner's accelerations increase to reach its minimum bound. This minimum bound depends on the initial shared states and it is large for maximum entangled state...|$|R
