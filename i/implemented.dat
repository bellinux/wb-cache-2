Constraint variants are ubiquitous: <b>implementing</b> them requires considerable effort, but yields better performance. This paper shows how to use variable views to derive perfect propagator variants: derived propagators inherit essential properties such as correctness and domain and bounds completeness. ...|$|R

5|$|At {{the turn}} of the century, the {{psychiatric}} reform that had been <b>implemented</b> by Franco Basaglia in Italy became known and was publicly declared to be <b>implemented</b> in Russia, with the view of retrenchment of expenditures.

Russia is decades behind the countries of the European Union in mental health reform, which has already been <b>implemented</b> or is being <b>implemented</b> in them. Until Russian society, Gushansky says, is aware of the need for mental health reform, we will live in the atmosphere of animosity, mistrust and violence. Many experts believe that problems spread beyond psychiatry to society as a whole. As Robert van Voren supposes, the Russians want to have their compatriots with mental disorders locked up outside the city and do not want to have them in community. Despite the 1992 Russian Mental Health Law, coercive psychiatry in Russia remains generally unregulated and fashioned by the same trends toward hyperdiagnosis and overreliance on institutional care characteristic of the Soviet period. In the Soviet Union, there had been an increase of the bed numbers because psychiatric services had been used to treat dissidents.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{ability of}} tillage <b>implements</b> to {{maintain}} surface residue coverage is largely {{dependent on the}} <b>implement’s</b> main active component. Two categories of tillage <b>implements</b> were compared to determine their ability to maintain grain sorghum (non–fragile) surface residue coverage when operating at two different tillage depths for fall and spring tillage. Chisel–type <b>implements</b> were found to bury substantially less crop residue than disk–type <b>implements.</b> Disk–type <b>implements</b> were found to bury increased amounts of crop residue when operating at deeper tillage depths. Fall and spring tillage were also found to leave equivalent amounts of percent residue cover and total mass of crop residue remaining on the soil surface. A more thorough understanding of the ability of tillage <b>implements</b> to maintain adequate amounts of surface residue coverage should enable producers to select appropriate <b>implements</b> to maximize production while minimizing erosion...|$|R

Staffs, which also function as weapons, are used by druids, invokers, sorcerers and wizards. Totems are used by druids and shamans. Wands are used by bards, warlocks and wizards. Holy symbols are used by Avengers, Clerics and Paladins; unlike other <b>implements,</b> a character can benefit from a holy symbol by wearing it rather than needing to wield it. Orbs are used by wizards and musical instruments are used by bards. Sorcerers can use daggers as <b>implements,</b> and swordmages can use any weapon in the light and heavy blade groups, and certain paragon paths such as Wizard of the Spiral Tower can use specific weapon types as <b>implements.</b> Additionally, some magic weapons, such as Holy Avengers (for paladins), Pact Blades (for warlocks) and Songblades (for bards), function as <b>implements.</b> The July 2008 Playtest version of the Artificer uses orbs, rods, staffs and wands as <b>implements.</b>|$|R

The structures shown can also be <b>implemented</b> using microstrip or buried stripline techniques (with suitable adjustments to dimensions) and can be adapted to coaxial cables, twin leads and waveguides, although some structures are more suitable for some implementations than others. The open wire implementations, for instance, of a number of structures are shown in the second column of figure 3 and open wire equivalents can be found for most other stripline structures.

40|$|This study {{examines}} the performance implications of <b>implementing</b> generic competitive strategies, {{and whether the}} implementation of a combination competitive strategy yields an incremental performance benefit over a single generic competitive strategy using data from Ghana, a Sub-Saharan African economy <b>implementing</b> economic liberalization policies. Two types of singular generic competitive strategies are analyzed: cost-leadership and differentiation. Our findings from the overall sample provide support for the viability and profitability of <b>implementing</b> coherent generic competitive strategies [...] cost-leadership, differentiation, and the combination of the singular strategies. The results further indicate that firms <b>implementing</b> a combination strategy tend to experience substantial incremental performance benefits over those <b>implementing</b> only the cost-leadership strategy. However, the incremental performance benefits to firms <b>implementing</b> a combination strategy do not significantly differ from the performance of firms <b>implementing</b> only the differentiation strategy. Furthermore, firms that <b>implement</b> a coherent competitive strategy (combination, cost-leadership, or differentiation) tend to gain considerable incremental performance benefits over firms that are stuck-in-the-middle.

Results showed thai Saudi Agricultural Bank distributed <b>implements</b> to twelve primary regions, and the increasing numbers of farm <b>implements</b> in some regions were proportional to the increasing numbers of farm owencrs and not with the area of farm parcels nor with the cultivated area of the region. Highly significant differences were found among the regions in the numbers of the distributed <b>implements.</b> These <b>implements</b> were primary tillage tools, secondary tillage tools, planters, sprayers, and mowers. It was found that the distribution of tillage cools and planters were related to a specific field crop.
