40|$|Abstract only availableEnergetic {{materials}} {{are defined as}} substances in which <b>fuel</b> and <b>oxidizer</b> react chemically to release energy. The amount and rate of energy released by this reaction can be improved by {{increasing the amount of}} interfacial contact between <b>fuel</b> and <b>oxidizer.</b> In conventional energetic materials macroscopic particles of <b>fuel</b> and <b>oxidizer</b> are mixed randomly. In this arrangement energy is lost due decreased contact between <b>fuel</b> and <b>oxidizer</b> {{as a result of the}} large particle size and random distribution. To reduce the amount of energy lost much smaller nano-particles can be used. The smaller particles allow for increased interfacial contact between <b>fuel</b> and <b>oxidizer,</b> resulting in improved performance. Even with smaller particles some energy is still lost due to the random arrangement. In order to further improve performance it is necessary to order the arrangement of <b>fuel</b> and <b>oxidizer.</b> Utilizing a method known as surfactant templating ordered structures such as nanorods, nanowires, and nanowells (similar to a honeycomb) can be created from oxide materials such as Copper Oxide, and Iron Oxide. When Aluminum Nano-particle fuel is mixed with these ordered oxide materials the resulting material has greatly increased interfacial contact between <b>fuel</b> and <b>oxidizer.</b> When reacted, these materials have minimal energy loss and greatly improved energetic performance. The increased performance of this type of material has created the possibility of many new applications for energetic materials. The potential uses for this material range from on chip power generation, to shockwave generation for medical imaging. College of Engineering Undergraduate Research Optio...|$|R

50|$|The Japanese Navy {{invested}} heavily in developing a large, heavy, and long-range torpedo, the Type 93. Torpedoes were the only weapon that gave small warships, such as destroyers, the potential to cripple or sink battleships. The IJN's torpedo research and development focused on using highly compressed oxygen instead of compressed air as the <b>fuel</b> <b>oxidizer</b> in the torpedo's propulsion system. These torpedoes used an otherwise normal wet-heater engine burning a fuel such as methanol or ethanol. Since air is only 21% oxygen (and 78% nitrogen), pure oxygen provides {{five times as much}} oxidizer in the same tank volume, thereby increasing torpedo range. In addition, the absence of the inert nitrogen resulted in the emission of significantly less exhaust gas, comprising only carbon dioxide, which is significantly soluble in water, and water vapor, thus greatly reducing tell-tale bubble trails.|$|E

5000|$|Solid {{propellants}} {{are either}} [...] "composites" [...] composed mostly of large, distinct macroscopic particles or single-, double-, or triple-bases (depending {{on the number}} of primary ingredients), which are homogeneous mixtures of one or more primary ingredients. Composites typically consist of a mixture of granules of solid oxidizer (examples: ammonium nitrate, ammonium perchlorate, potassium nitrate) in a polymer binder (binding agent) with flakes or powders of energetic compounds (examples: RDX, HMX), metallic additives (examples: aluminium, beryllium), plasticizers, stabilizers, and/or burn rate modifiers (iron oxide, copper oxide). Single-, double-, or triple-bases are mixtures of the <b>fuel,</b> <b>oxidizer,</b> binders, and plasticizers that are macroscopically indistinguishable and often blended as liquids and cured in a single batch. Often, the ingredients of a double-base propellant have multiple roles such as RDX which is both a fuel and oxidizer or nitrocellulose which is a <b>fuel,</b> <b>oxidizer,</b> and plasticizer. Further complicating categorization, there are many propellants that contain elements of double-base and composite propellants, which often contain some amount of energetic additives homogeneously mixed into the binder. In the case of gunpowder (a pressed composite without a polymeric binder) the fuel is charcoal, the oxidizer is potassium nitrate, and sulphur serves as a catalyst. (Note: sulphur is not a true catalyst in gunpowder as it is consumed to a great extent into a variety of reaction products such as K2S.) During the 1950s and 60s researchers in the United States developed ammonium perchlorate composite propellant (APCP). This mixture is typically 69-70% finely ground ammonium perchlorate (an oxidizer), combined with 16-20% fine aluminium powder (a fuel), held together in a base of 11-14% polybutadiene acrylonitrile (PBAN) or Hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (polybutadiene rubber fuel). The mixture is formed as a thickened liquid and then cast into the correct shape and cured into a firm but flexible load-bearing solid. Historically the tally of APCP solid propellants is relatively small. The military, however, uses a wide variety of different types of solid propellants some of which exceed the performance of APCP. A comparison of the highest specific impulses achieved with the various solid and liquid propellant combinations used in current launch vehicles is given in the article on solid-fuel rockets.|$|E
50|$|The {{temperatures}} {{at which}} linear coal-fueled MHD generators can operate {{are limited by}} factors that include: (a) the combustion <b>fuel,</b> <b>oxidizer,</b> and oxidizer preheat temperature which limit the maximum temperature of the cycle; (b) the ability to protect the sidewalls and electrodes from melting; (c) the ability to protect the electrodes from electrochemical attack from the hot slag coating the walls combined with the high current or arcs that impinge on the electrodes as they carry off the direct current from the plasma; and (d) by the capability of the electrical insulators between each electrode. Coal-fired MHD plants with oxygen/air and high oxidant preheats would probably provide potassium seeded plasmas of about 4200 deg. F, 10 atmospheres pressure, and begin expansion at Mach 1.2. These plants would recover MHD exhaust heat for oxidant preheat, and for combined cycle steam generation. With aggressive assumptions, one DOE-funded feasibility study of where the technology could go, 1000 MWe Advanced Coal-Fired MHD/Steam Binary Cycle Power Plant Conceptual Design, published in June 1989, showed that a large coal-fired MHD combined cycle plant could attain a HHV energy efficiency approaching 60 percent‚Äîwell in excess of other coal-fueled technologies, so the potential for low operating costs exists.|$|E
50|$|A tracer {{projectile}} {{is constructed}} with a hollow base {{filled with a}} pyrotechnic flare material, made of a mixture of a very finely ground metallic <b>fuel,</b> <b>oxidizer,</b> and {{a small amount of}} organic fuel. Metallic fuels include magnesium, aluminum, and occasionally zirconium. The oxidizer is a salt molecule which contains oxygen combined with a specific atom responsible for the desired color output. Upon ignition, the heated salt releases its oxygen to sustain combustion of the fuel in the mixture. The color-emitting atom in the salt is also released and reacts chemically with excess oxygen providing the source of the colored flame. In NATO standard ammunition (including US), the oxidizer salt is usually a mixture of strontium compounds (nitrate, peroxide, etc.) and the metallic fuel is magnesium. Burning strontium yields a bright red light. Russian and Chinese tracer ammunition generates green light using barium salts. An oxidizer and metallic fuel alone, however, do not make a practical pyrotechnic for the purposes of producing colored light. The reaction is too energetic, consuming all materials in one big flash of white lightwhite light being the characteristic output of magnesium-oxide (MgO), for example. Therefore, in the case of using Strontium Nitrate and Magnesium, to produce a red colored flame that is not over-powered by the white light from the burning fuel, a chlorine donor is provided in the pyrotechnic mixture, so that Strontium Chloride can also form in the flame, cooling it so that the white light of MgO is greatly reduced. Cooling the flame in this manner also lengthens the reaction rate so that the mixture has an appreciable burn time. Polyvinylchloride (PVC) is a typical organic fuel in colored light for this purpose. Some modern designs use compositions that produce little to no visible light and radiate mainly in infrared, being visible only on night vision equipment.|$|E

During SSME thrusting, the orbiter general-purpose computers constantly compute the instantaneous mass of the vehicle due to the usage of the propellants.

40|$|A {{major hazard}} {{posed by the}} {{propulsion}} system of hypersonic and space vehicles {{is the possibility of}} fire or explosion in the vehicle environment.

50|$|Devil's venom was a {{nickname}} coined by Soviet rocket scientists for a liquid rocket fuel {{composed of a}} dangerous combination of nitric acid and hydrazine‚Äîspecifically, hypergolic UDMH-nitric acid.

Further, both the <b>fuel</b> and <b>oxidizer</b> have high boiling points compared to other rocket fuels such as liquid hydrogen, and oxidizers such as liquid oxygen, allowing rockets to be stored ready for launch for long periods without the <b>fuel</b> or <b>oxidizer</b> boiling off and needing to be replenished.|$|R
