5|$|The {{game was}} well {{received}} by reviewers, who appreciated the {{improvements in the}} accessibility of the game, allowing players to immediately <b>jump</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> play without spending excessive time in the game's menus. The game also sold well, however, it sold about less than 50 percent of Guitar Hero: World Tour's sales, specifically selling 1.2 million copies across all platforms. Improvements to both the Career and competitive multiplayer modes were also highlights of the game. However, the game's track list {{was considered to be}} too broad, and controversy arose over the ability to use the avatar of Kurt Cobain to perform in any other song within the game.|$|E
5|$|Band Hero has {{received}} mixed to positive reviews from gaming critics. Most recognized {{the game as}} having the same feature sets as Guitar Hero 5, including any benefits or flaws that may come from that. Reviewers praised the reuse of the Guitar Hero 5 features such as the Party Play mode that allows for players to <b>jump</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> out, the improved Career mode, and the improved GHTunes. Some identified that the target market of the game appears to be towards teenage girls, such as the featuring of Taylor Swift, the color schemes used in the game, {{and other parts of}} the song selection. Reviewers noted that setlist would be the strongest measure of whether players should purchase the game. The reviewers also commented on the smaller setlist, which contains only 65 songs compared to Guitar Hero 5s 85.|$|E
5|$|Harry, Ron, Ginny, and Lockhart {{return to}} the main castle and reunite with McGonagall, Dumbledore, and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley. Ginny, whose {{possession}} by Voldemort caused all of the petrification and troubles {{over the course of}} the year, is given a reprieve by Dumbledore, who reasons that greater wizards have been duped by Voldemort before and takes great interest in the qualities of the diary, which Harry gives to him. Lucius Malfoy bursts in after this meeting, demanding to know why and how Dumbledore has returned to the school and accompanied by Dobby, revealing the family to whom he is enslaved. The house-elf also provides Harry with unspoken cues regarding the diary’s ownership: While it was Tom Riddle’s, it had been in the Malfoys’ possession, and Harry returns it, devising a scenario involving his own sock that frees Dobby from the Malfoys’ employment, thus provoking an attack on Harry, only for Dobby to <b>jump</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> save him. The petrified students are cured, the end-of-year exams are cancelled (much to Hermione’s chagrin), Hagrid comes back in the middle of the final feast, and Harry returns to Privet Drive in higher spirits than he last left it.|$|E

5|$|Notably, KOF 94 innovated {{the genre}} by {{replacing}} a traditional round-based format used in preceding fighting {{games with a}} format consisting of 3-on-3 team based matches dubbed the Team Battle System. Instead of choosing a single character, the player selects from one of eight available teams, each consisting of three members. Before each match, the players choose {{the order in which}} each of their team member enters the battle. When the match begins, the members chosen to go first on their respective teams will fight. When one character is defeated, the following member of the same team will take his or her place, while the character on the other team will have a small portion of their life restored (if energy was lost during the previous round). If a character is losing a match against the opponent, then the player can call one of the remaining teammates standing on the sidelines to <b>jump</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> perform a support attack. The match ends when all three members of either team lose.|$|E

Álvarez was looking for one shot and got it in the sixth round. He backed up Gomez with a right hand and followed up with a flurry to get the referee to <b>jump</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> stop the fight.|$|E
25|$|Casual games {{derive their}} name from their ease of accessibility, simple to {{understand}} gameplay and quick to grasp rule sets. Additionally, casual games frequently support {{the ability to}} <b>jump</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> out of play on demand. Casual games as a format existed long before the term was coined and include video games such as Solitaire or Minesweeper which can commonly be found pre-installed with many versions of the Microsoft Windows operating system. Examples of genres within this category are match three, hidden object, time management, puzzle or many of the tower defense style games. Casual games are generally available through app stores and online retailers such as PopCap, Zylom and GameHouse or provided for free play through web portals such as Newgrounds. While casual games are most commonly played on personal computers, phones or tablets, {{they can also be}} found on many of the on-line console system download services (e.g., the PlayStation Network, WiiWare or Xbox Live).|$|E

It’s almost like being on LSD, but worse. It’s not good. You never want May out of control. You don’t {{want her to be}} paranoid." [...] Regarding Reyes' choice to work with Johnson {{at the end of the}} episode, Luna said that [...] "a lot of that is I respect her power and I respect her.

[...] He noted that they [...] "get sidetracked" [...] with the blackouts in this episode, and then Gabe asks Johnson to leave. Luna said [...] "that look on his face you see is perhaps a little disappointment in that he started to have a bond with someone he hasn’t killed. I think that face you see is one of—not fear, but definitely concern that the one person who knows that Robbie Reyes is Ghost Rider is now back out there running around, doing whatever she has to do." [...] Whedon called Gabe asking Johnson to leave Robbie [...] "another blow to Daisy and her emotional makeup" [...] as she [...] "has been trying to operate alone, because she doesn’t want to be a danger to anyone else.

She praised Neal Bledsoe's portrayal of Stephen Burkett, saying that he did a [...] "wonderful job of playing a chronic hair puller". She also praised the character of Curtis, stating that he was [...] "adorable". Of the storyline she said, [...] "The actual murder by electrocution was an interesting twist and one I didn't see coming. I was happy to see Bud <b>jump</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> read the murderer her rights before she said anything further. That certainly seemed like something a detective should do". She finished in saying that she [...] "enjoyed" [...] the song played at the end of the episode, 'Maybe' by Ingrid Michaelson [...] "was both cheery and melancholy enough to fit the moment". Michelle Carlbert from TV Equals praised the scene in which Megan pulls Colin's hair, calling it one of her [...] "favourite bits", another being when it showed Ethan, Peter, Curtis and Bud going out on a [...] "Boy’s Night" [...] stating it was [...] "awesome" [...] and that she [...] "love(s) it when they show the team bonding like that".

500|$|Destiny's Child {{recorded}} R {{songs with}} styles that encompasses urban, contemporary, and dance-pop. In the group's original line-up, Knowles {{was the lead}} vocalist, Rowland was the second lead vocalist, Luckett was on soprano, and Roberson was on alto. Knowles remained as the lead vocalist in the group's final line-up as a trio, however, Rowland and Williams also took turns in singing lead {{for the majority of}} their songs. Destiny's Child cited R singer Janet Jackson as one of their influences. Ann Powers of The New York Times described Destiny's Child music as [...] "fresh and emotional... these ladies have the best mixes, the savviest samples and especially the most happening beats." [...] In the same publication, Jon Pareles noted that the sound that defines Destiny's Child, aside from Knowles' voice, [...] "is the way its melodies <b>jump</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> out of double-time. Above brittle, syncopated rhythm tracks, quickly articulated verses alternate with smoother choruses." [...] The group usually harmonize their vocals in their songs, especially on the ballads. In most instances of their songs, each member sings one verse and chimes in at the chorus. In their third album Survivor (2001), each member sings lead in the majority of the songs. Knowles said, [...] "...everybody {{is a part of the}} music... Everybody is singing lead on every song, and it's so great—because now Destiny's Child is at the point vocally and mentally that it should be at." [...] Knowles, however, completely led songs like [...] "Brown Eyes" [...] and [...] "Dangerously in Love". The group explored their lyrics to man-to-woman relationship, sisterhood and female empowerment anthems.|$|E

Just before he dies he presses to his lips the locket with the picture of his beloved little girl and in a vision sees her in the clouds holding out her arms to him that he, too, may enter with her the pearly gates, inside of which all souls are equal, and all free. The comedy of the story is furnished by little Eva's Aunt Ophelia, a queer old lawyer named Marx, and his stubborn donkey, to say nothing of Topsy, a wicked little colored girl, who Aunt Ophelia tries hard to convert." ...|$|E
500|$|Both Karate Champ and Yie Ar Kung Fu later {{provided}} {{a template for}} Capcom's Street Fighter in 1987. Street Fighter found its own niche in the gaming world, partially because many arcade game developers in the 1980s focused more on producing beat-em-ups and shoot 'em ups. Part of the game's appeal {{was the use of}} special moves that could only be discovered by experimenting with the game controls, which created a sense of mystique and invited players to practice the game, although similar controller motions used for grappling maneuvers in the earlier Brian Jacks Uchi Mata were deemed too difficult. Following Street Fighter's lead, the use of command-based hidden moves began to pervade other games in the rising fighting game genre. Street Fighter also introduced other staples of the genre, including the blocking technique as well as the ability for a challenger to <b>jump</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> initiate a match against a player at any time. The game also introduced pressure-sensitive controls that determine the strength of an attack, though due to causing damaged arcade cabinets, Capcom replaced it soon after with a six-button control scheme offering light, medium and hard punches and kicks, which became another staple of the genre. In 1988, Home Data released Reikai Dōshi: Chinese Exorcist, also known as Last Apostle Puppet Show, the first fighting game to use digitized sprites and motion capture animation. Meanwhile, home game consoles largely ignored the genre. [...] was one of few releases for the Sega Genesis but was not as popular as games in other genres. Technical challenges limited the popularity of early fighting games. Programmers had difficulty producing a game that could recognize the fast motions of a joystick, and so players had difficulty executing special moves with any accuracy.|$|E
500|$|Guitar Hero 5 {{was well}} {{received}} upon release. Seth Schiesel of The New York Times called Guitar Hero 5 [...] "the most enjoyable Guitar Hero game in several years" [...] and [...] "generally well-tuned, often exhilarating rock ’n’ roll experience". [...] Keza MacDonald of Eurogamer commented {{that there is}} [...] "just nothing wrong" [...] with Guitar Hero 5, given the various stumbling blocks the developers had made from previous iterations of the game, {{and the way the}} developers have continued to find new additions to the game. Reviewers greatly appreciated the new features in the game {{to make it easier to}} <b>jump</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> play music, from the simplification of the menu system to the availability of every song in all the game modes from the start. Erik Brudvig of IGN considers the menu change to be [...] "one of the best things that Neversoft has done", although the menus are a minor part of the game, it removes much of the frustration with the World Tour and other previous Guitar Hero games' menu systems. Arthur Gies of GameSpy noted that by simplification of the interface, [...] "Neversoft stripped Guitar Hero down to what works and built up from there". Reviewers appreciated the immediate launch of the game's Party Mode once the player put the disk in the system and the ability to jump right into that song through the new menus, and considered this to help make the game enjoyable for social gatherings. Chris Watters of GameSpot considered this mode to be [...] "accessible, welcoming, and delightfully low key". The changes in Career mode, in which the players need not stick to the same instrument or difficulty throughout, was well appreciated. Brudvig appreciated how this allows the player to complete the Career mode without getting stuck on a song, having to go back to replay the Career mode on other instruments, and that with the addition of song Challenges, provides enough incentive to return to the songs to improve one's performance. The new multiplayer modes in Rockfest, which replaced more [...] "arcadey" [...] competitive modes, were considered a welcome replacement, as it allowed players of various skill levels to compete fairly against each other, making the game more friendly to the multiplayer experience. However, Matt Helgeson of Game Informer noted that despite the various RockFest modes, it [...] "all comes down to hitting the notes correctly".|$|E

2500|$|AppSpy's Andrew Nesvadba {{scored the}} iOS version 5 out of 5, praising the {{graphics}} and touchscreen controls, and writing, [...] "The Settlers is everything great about strategy games.

[...] Arron Hirst of 148Apps scored it 4 out of 5. Although he was critical {{of the lack of}} free play and multiplayer modes, he praised the controls and the replication of the original game mechanics, concluding, [...] "the game is both immersive and addicting." [...] Pocket Gamer's Tracy Erickson scored it 8 out of 10, giving it a [...] "Silver Award", and calling it [...] "surprisingly good" [...] and [...] "largely positive."
