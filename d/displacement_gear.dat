Abstract: {{numerical control}} system {{is used to}} control the gear hob and gear blank in autorotation and linkage generative movement, to realize the machining of teeth shape and teeth dividing; {{and at the same}} time it controls the vertical <b>displacement</b> of the <b>gear</b> hob and the horizontal <b>displacement</b> of <b>gear</b> blank, to make a circular arc track whose radius is the sum of gear blank’s radius and gear hob’s radius, thus realizing the NC machining of circular-arc aligned gear. Before and after the machining of teeth form, transition arc is used to finish the trimming and thinning of the teeth thickness at the teeth end; on the prerequisite of machining the circular-arc aligned gear, this method successfully solves the puzzle of gear chamfering, and discharges all gear burr into the lower end of the teeth. The advantage of this machining method lies in that when the hob cuts deeper, as the both side-blades are cutting the work-piece at the same time, the thinning on both sides are quite symmetrical, and the fine symmetry remains during the uniform change of the teeth thickness. So, the machining precision of the parts is prior to the requirements in the drawing, and this method yields good effect, which broadens the application of NC technology...|$|R

For this reason several innovations aimed at reducing the power absorbed by the lubrication pump have been developed in recent years.

However during the 1990 s, a more gradual reduction in the fuel consumption of cars, coupled with increasing sales of 4 -wheel-drive vehicles, has seen fuel consumption for new passenger vehicles as a whole stabilise. BTRE new vehicle database The average fuel consumption rate of new passenger vehicles sold each year is {{a significant factor in}} determining Australia’s transport fuel use and emissions well into the future.

40|$|External {{spur gear}} pumps are {{exceedingly}} useful components in common hydraulic systems. The main issue with {{external gear pumps}} is that all current models are limited to only fixed-displacement. This means that for every revolution of the gears inside the pump, a set amount of fluid will always be displaced. Consequently, external gear pumps are limited in their use because they can only operate at full throttle causing inefficiencies when reduced displacement is needed. The successful procurement of a variable <b>displacement</b> <b>gear</b> pump will allow a more efficient use of hydraulic systems, {{such as in the}} displacement controlled systems used in some heavy construction equipment. In this research approach, the displacement is varied by changing the timing of the gears inside the pump. More specifically, changing the timing of the gears’ connections with the inlet and outlet grooves alters the available volume in the gears’ spaces, subsequently varying the displacement. With this in mind, additional research was conducted to develop an actuation system for the aforementioned process. This includes the design of new gears, bearing blocks, and additional hydraulics for use in a modified existing commercial pump. Simulations have shown the implementation of the design allowed for a 67 % reduction in displacement, and thus successful introduction of variable displacement into an external gear pump.

40|$|NASA's {{proposed}} lunar lander, Altair, will {{be exposed}} to vastly different external environment temperatures. The challenges to the active thermal control system (ATCS) are compounded by unfavorable transients in the internal waste heat dissipation profile: the lowest heat load occurs in the coldest environment while peak loads coincide with the warmest environment. The current baseline for this fluid is a 50 / 50 inhibited propylene glycol/water mixture with a freeze temperature around - 35 C. While the overall size of the radiator's heat rejection area is dictated by the worst case hot scenario, a turn-down feature is necessary to tolerate the worst case cold scenario. A radiator with digital turn-down capability is being designed as a robust means to maintain cabin environment and equipment temperatures while minimizing mass and power consumption. It utilizes active valving to isolate and render ineffective any number of parallel flow tubes which span across the ATCS radiator. Several options were assessed in a trade-study to accommodate flow tube isolation and {{how to deal with}} the stagnant fluid that would otherwise remain in the tube. Bread-board environmental tests were conducted for options to drain the fluid from a turned-down leg as well an option to allow a leg to freeze/thaw.

40|$|Due to many advantages, {{swash plate}} pumps are wide spread in {{hydraulic}} systems. The main advantages are the through drive capability, the adjustability {{and most of}} all, the high power density. Their application range is limited, historically, to 450 bar including medium and higher volume sizes. In higher pressure range, constant pumps such as wobbling disks or radial piston pumps are normally used. This is because the higher stressed parts can be dimensioned much bigger. Pumps with lower power such as constant <b>displacement</b> <b>gear</b> pumps are generally used in low price applications. In order to enlarge the application range of swash plate pumps, their advantages have to be further improved and strengthened. This paper shows by example how {{the pressure of the}} basic series A 4 VSO was increased up to a nominal pressure of 630 bar and the historical pressure mark of 450 bar could be exceeded. This increase in pressure level enables for example steel treatment manufacturers to reduce their component sizes without the need of a pressure transducer. Furthermore the power density of the redesigned HA 4 VSO was increased by 36 %, compared to the standard A 4 VSO, by significantly increasing the self-priming speed. On {{the other side of the}} application range, in lower power mobile applications such as small tractors, forklift and skid steer loader, there is an increasing demand for less exhaust emissions and better fuel economy. The energy saving potential by changing from a hydraulic system with constant hydraulic pumps to variable hydraulic pumps is already proven on high power applications.

5000|$|Gear pumps (with {{external}} teeth) (fixed displacement) {{are simple}} and economical pumps. The swept volume or <b>displacement</b> of <b>gear</b> pumps for hydraulics will be between about 1 and 200 millilitres. They {{have the lowest}} volumetric efficiency ( [...] ) of all three basic pump types (gear, vane and piston pumps) These pumps create pressure through the meshing of the gear teeth, which forces fluid around the gears to pressurize the outlet side. For lubrication, the gear pump uses {{a small amount of}} oil from the pressurized side of the gears, bleeds this through the (typically) hydrodynamic bearings, and vents the same oil either to the low pressure side of the gears, or through a dedicated drain port on the pump housing. Some gear pumps can be quite noisy, compared to other types, but modern gear pumps are highly reliable and much quieter than older models. This is in part due to designs incorporating split gears, helical gear teeth and higher precision/quality tooth profiles that mesh and unmesh more smoothly, reducing pressure ripple and related detrimental problems. Another positive attribute of the gear pump, is that catastrophic breakdown is a lot less common than in most other types of hydraulic pumps. This is because the gears gradually wear down the housing and/or main bushings, reducing the volumetric efficiency of the pump gradually until it is all but useless. This often happens long before wear causes the unit to seize or break down.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Material fatigue is an {{important}} issue in structural design, especially for aircraft that undergo long-term alternating stress. Composite materials have been used extensively in aircraft because of their high specific strength ratio. Using composites made from different reinforcing materials and matrices through various manufacturing methods can yield different levels of performance when structures undergo long-term cyclic stress. Currently, composite materials are extensively used to build aircraft for large commercial carriers such as the Boeing 787 and the Airbus A 380. Composite materials are also used in newly-developed small business jets and light aircraft to reduce weight and fuel consumption. The primary objective {{of this study is to}} analyze the reaction of light aircraft landing gear under cyclic stress.

40|$|In {{helicopters}} and other rotorcraft, the gearbox {{is a major}} source of noise and vibration (N&V). The two N&V excitation mechanisms are the relative <b>displacements</b> between mating <b>gears</b> (transmission errors) and the friction associated with sliding between gear teeth. Historically, transmission errors have been minimized via improved manufacturing accuracies and tooth modifications. Yet, at high torque loads, noise levels are still relatively high though transmission errors might be somewhat minimal. This suggests that sliding friction is indeed a dominant noise source for high power density rotorcraft gearboxes. In reality, friction source mechanism is associated with surface roughness, lubrication regime properties, time-varying friction forces/torques and gear-mesh interface dynamics. Currently, the nature of these mechanisms is not well understood, while there is a definite need for analytical tools that incorporate sliding resistance and surface roughness, and predict their effects on the vibro- acoustic behavior of gears. Toward this end, an experiment was conducted to collect sound and vibration data on the NASA Glenn Gear-Noise Rig. Three iterations of the experiment were accomplished: Iteration 1 tested a baseline set of gears to establish a benchmark. Iteration 2 used a gear-set with low surface asperities to reduce the sliding friction excitation. Iteration 3 incorporated low viscosity oil with the baseline set of gears to examine the effect of lubrication. The results from this experiment will contribute to a two year project in collaboration with the Ohio State University to develop the necessary mathematical and computer models for analyzing geared systems and explain key physical phenomena seen in experiments. Given the importance of sliding friction in the gear dynamic and vibro-acoustic behavior of rotorcraft gearboxes, there is considerable potential for research & developmental activities. Better models and understanding will lead to quiet and reliable gear designs, as well as the selection of optimal manufacturing processes...|$|R

The buoy simulation model is provided by Wave 4 Power (W 4 P). It consists of a floater that is rigidly connected to a fully submerged vertical (acceleration) tube open at both ends. The tube contains a piston whose motion relative to the floater-tube system drives a power take-off mechanism. The power take-off model is provided by Ocean Harvesting Technologies AB (OHT). It comprises a mechanical gearbox and a gravity accumulator. The system is utilized to transform the irregular wave energy into a smooth electrical power output. OHT's simulation model needs to be extended with a hydraulic motor at the input shaft. There are control features in both systems, that need to be connected and synchronized with each other. Another major goal within the thesis is to test different online control techniques. A simple control strategy to optimize power capture is called sea-state tuning and it can be achieved by using a mechanical gearbox with several discrete gear ratios or with a variable <b>displacement</b> pump. The <b>gear</b> ratio of the gear box can be regulated according to a 2 D look up table based on the average wave amplitude and frequency over a defined time frame. The OHT power take-off utilizes a control strategy, called spill function, to limit the excess power capture and keep the weight accumulator within a span by disengaging the input shaft from the power take-off. This is to be modified to implement power limitation with regulation of the gear ratio of the gearbox. + 4673629078...|$|R

O rendimento na barra de tração é frequentemente usado para comparar ou avaliar tratores. Entretanto, o rendimento na barra de tração é afetado pelas condições da superfície de deslocamento, pela relação de engrenagens e pela relação entre o peso e a potência do trator. O objetivo do presente trabalho foi avaliar o rendimento na barra de tração de um trator agrícola com diferentes relações entre o peso/potência sob diferentes regimes de carga aplicados na barra de tração. O ensaio foi conduzido na Fazenda Experimental Lageado, pertencente a UNESP, Campus de Botucatu - SP avaliando as seguintes relações de peso e potência: 50; 55 e 60 N kW- 1, onde para cada uma dessas relações utilizou-se três intervalos de força na barra de tração da seguinte forma: 15 a 20; 25 a 30 e 35 a 40 kN. Concluiu-se que as relações de peso e potência e as cargas estudadas apresentaram pouca variabilidade. Observou-se que a relação de peso e potência de 50 e 55 N kW- 1, para as cargas aplicadas na barra de tração de 25 a 30 e 35 a 40 kN, apresentaram diferença entre médias, sendo que o maior rendimento da barra de tração foi obtido para a carga de 25 a 30 kN, onde a média foi de 50, 9 e 54, 1 % respectivamente. Já para a relação de peso e potência de 60 N kW- 1 não houve diferença entre médias nas cargas de 25 a 30 e 35 a 40 kN. Testing {{the tractor}} in {{agricultural}} soil {{is one way}} of getting information, particularly with regard to the development of traction. The yield at the drawbar is often used to compare or evaluate tractors. However, drawbar performance is affected by the conditions of the <b>displacement</b> surface, the <b>gear</b> ratio and the ratio between the weight and power of the tractor. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the yield at the drawbar of a tractor at different weight to power ratios, with different loads on the drawbar. The test was conducted at the Lageado Experimental Farm,belonging to UNESP, on Botucatu Campus in SãoPaulo, by evaluating the following weight to power ratios: 50, 55 and 60 N kW- 1, where for each of these ratios, three intervals of force on the drawbar were used, as follows: 15 to 20, 25 to 30 and 35 to 40 kN. It was concluded that the weight to power ratios and the loads studied showed little variability. The weight to power ratios of 50 and 55 N kW- 1, for loads on the drawbar of 25 to 30 and 35 to 40 kN, showed differences between their averages, with the highest yield at the drawbar being obtained for a load of 25 to 30 kN, where the average was 50. 9 and 54. 1 % respectively. As for the weight to power ratio of 60 -N kW- 1, there was no difference in the averages for loads of 25 to 30 and 35 to 40 kN...|$|R
