5|$|During World War II The German Navy {{deployed}} weather buoys (Wetterfunkgerät See — WFS) {{at fifteen}} fixed {{positions in the}} North Atlantic and Barents Sea. They were launched from U-boats into a maximum depth of ocean of 1000 <b>fathoms</b> (1,800 metres), limited by {{the length of the}} anchor cable. Overall height of the body was 10.5 metres (of which most was submerged), surmounted by a mast and extendible aerial of 9 metres. Data (air and water temperature, atmospheric pressure and relative humidity) were encoded and transmitted four times a day. When the batteries (high voltage dry-cells for the valves, and nickel-iron for other power and to raise and lower the aerial mast) were exhausted, after about eight to ten weeks, the unit self-destructed.|$|E
5|$|Films of {{the time}} {{typically}} used dinosaurs as monsters, with the added element of atomic fears in the early Cold War. Thus, The Beast from 20,000 <b>Fathoms</b> (1953) and Godzilla (1954; American release 1956) portray monstrous dinosaur-like prehistoric reptiles that go on rampages after being awakened by atomic bomb tests. An alternative appears in Disney's animated Fantasia (1940), in its The Rite of Spring sequence, which attempted to portray dinosaurs with some scientific accuracy (although it has the common error of showing prehistoric animals from many different time periods living at the same time) and also in Karel Zeman's Cesta do praveku (1955;Journey to the Beginning of Time) Czechoslovakian children's science fiction movie inspired by Zdeněk Burian's work.|$|E
5|$|Wong Tei Tung and Three <b>Fathoms</b> Cove are the {{earliest}} sites of human habitation in Hong Kong during the Paleolithic Period. It {{is believed that}} the Three Fathom Cove was a river-valley settlement and Wong Tei Tung was a lithic manufacturing site. Excavated Neolithic artefacts suggested cultural differences from the Longshan culture of northern China and settlement by the Che people, prior to the migration of the Baiyue to Hong Kong. Eight petroglyphs, which dated to the Shang Dynasty (c. 1600 BC – 1066 BC) in China, were discovered on the surrounding islands.|$|E

50|$|Drift next {{began work}} in late February, 1879, off the Mississippi River Delta in the Gulf of Mexico. Both current and {{temperatures}} were observed at depths of 2 <b>fathom</b> m, 5 <b>fathom</b> m, 10 <b>fathom</b> m, 20 <b>fathom</b> m, 30 <b>fathom</b> m, 45 <b>fathom</b> m, 80 <b>fathom</b> m and 90 <b>fathom</b> m depending on depths at the stations. The ship made 497 temperature observations and 2,131 current measurements at thirteen stations before return to New York in late May of 1879. By this time other ships were studying currents, particularly the Blake and Bache {{with reference to}} the Gulf Stream. There is no mention of the ship in the fiscal year 1880 report and the report for fiscal year 1881 notes she, along with others, have been laid up for want of means with Drift at Brooklyn, New York.|$|R
50|$|<b>Fathom</b> Harvill (Welch) is a skydiver touring Europe with a U.S. {{parachute}} team. She is {{approached by}} a Scottish agent to recover an atomic triggering mechanism. The film was based on Larry Forrester's second <b>Fathom</b> novel <b>Fathom</b> Heavensent, then in the draft stage but never published. His first was 1967's A Girl Called <b>Fathom.</b>|$|R
5|$|FitzRoy's {{instructions}} from the Admiralty required a detailed geological survey of a circular coral atoll to investigate how coral reefs formed, particularly whether they rose {{from the bottom of}} the sea or from the summits of extinct volcanoes, and the effects of tides measured with specially constructed gauges. He chose the Keeling Islands in the Indian Ocean, and on arrival on 1 April the entire crew set to work. Darwin found a coconut economy, serving both the small settlement and wildlife. There was a limited range of native plants and no land birds, but hermit crabs everywhere. The lagoons teemed with a rich variety of invertebrates and fish, and he examined the atoll's structure in view of the theory he had developed in Lima, of encircling reefs becoming atolls as an island sank. This idea was supported by the numerous soundings FitzRoy had taken showing a steep slope outside the reef with no living corals below 20–30 <b>fathoms</b> (10–15m).|$|E
5|$|By {{the turn}} of the 18th century, Felling {{consisted}} of little more than the large Brandling estate and a small scattering of tiny farming villages. However, Ralph Brandling, the incumbent of the Brandling estate at that time, had come to realise the value of the rich coal deposits on his estate and began drift mining around 1670. He initially found the large coal seams under his estate difficult to extract due to their depth, and indeed it was imported coal from Newcastle-upon-Tyne which saw the development of more extensive industries in salt, glass and chemicals which began to attract workers to the area. At around 1750, a large copper-works was opened at the banks of the River Tyne; the first such works to be developed on the river. Encouraged by these developments, Ralph Brandling's son, Charles Brandling, firstly commissioned more extensive mining of near-surface coal on his estate and then, encouraged by the discovery of several strata below his estate, began boring operations in 1758 to allow ultimately for deeper coal extraction. The result was the opening of Felling Colliery in 1779, working on the High Main stratum at a depth of 125 <b>fathoms.</b> A brown paper mill was also opened in 1798.|$|E
5|$|The fleet {{remained}} in captivity during the negotiations that ultimately produced the Treaty of Versailles. Reuter {{believed that the}} British intended to seize the German ships on 21 June 1919, which was the deadline for Germany to have signed the peace treaty. Unaware that the deadline had been extended to the 23rd, Reuter ordered the ships to be sunk at the next opportunity. On the morning of 21 June, the British fleet left Scapa Flow to conduct training maneuvers, and at 11:20 Reuter transmitted the order to his ships. Seydlitz slipped beneath the surface at 13:50. On her side and on the bottom in twelve <b>fathoms</b> of water the wreck was frequently mistaken for a small island, and was sold in this condition as scrap to the salvage firm of Cox and Danks along with a battleship and twenty-six destroyers. The ship was raised on 2 November 1928, and while still inverted was towed south to be scrapped in Rosyth by 1930. Seydlitzs bell is {{on display at the}} Laboe Naval Memorial.|$|E

25|$|Fish Hawk {{also was}} {{outfitted}} to conduct general scientific {{research related to}} fisheries, including depth sounding, measuring {{the temperature of the}} sea bottom, and collecting marine animals and plants. She had a hoisting winch with 1,000 <b>fathoms</b> (6,000 feet; 1,829 meters) of steel cable for trawling and dredging, an otter trawl, a 9-foot (2.75-meter) beam trawl, an 11-foot (3.6-meter) beam trawl, a 17-foot (5.2-meter) beam trawl, Blake and Chester rake dredges, and a tangle bar, the latter an iron axle and wheels with deck swabs or bundles of rope yarn on chains that Fish Hawk could drag along the sea bottom to capture marine animals and plants. For hydrography, she had a sounding machine with 600 <b>fathoms</b> (3,600 feet; 1,097 meters) of piano wire, deep-sea reversing thermometers, and density salinometers.|$|E

25|$|Seven Mosquitos {{under the}} command of Squadron Leader E C Gartrell, OBE used three-inch solid-headed rockets to sink the ship, while an eighth filmed the event for the National Film Unit. The attack lasted 35 minutes and the ship sank at 3:43pm in 450 <b>fathoms</b> of water 15 miles south east of Baring Head after taking ten direct hits.|$|E
25|$|Coal-fired steam engines, were an {{important}} part of the operation at Leadhills. Leadhills had three steam engines as early as 1778 (Smout, 1967, p.106). In the winter of 1765, James Watt had been approached to design and build a steam engine for Leadhills that would raise water from 30 <b>fathoms</b> (approx. 55m.) below the surface. Watt did not get the contract (Hills, 1998).|$|E
25|$|The {{house was}} empty on 4 February 1560 when French troops led by d'Oysel {{attacked}} and burnt it. On Easter Day 1562, the 3rd Earl of Arran, {{who suffered from}} mental ill health, escaped from his father and bedchamber at Kinneil using sheets as a rope. The drop was 30 <b>fathoms.</b> After the battle of Corrichie in October 1562, Arran was the reluctant keeper of George Gordon at Kinneil, the forfeited heir of the Earl of Huntly.|$|E
50|$|In 2004, Turner {{restarted}} the <b>Fathom</b> {{series and}} had a preview of its premiere in his company's first comic, Michael Turner Presents: Aspen. After that, a <b>Fathom</b> miniseries titled Fathom: Dawn of War was produced and, shortly after that, the series Fathom: Cannon Hawke was started. The second volume in the <b>Fathom</b> series was drawn by artist Koi Turnbull. The third <b>Fathom</b> series was drawn by artist Ale Garza and inked by Sal Regla.

25|$|On 13 March 1583 Doctor John Dee {{had entered}} into a lease at the London home of Lionel Duckett to work silver and lead mines at Combe Martin and Knap Down in Devon; however Dee left England in September 1584 {{in the wake of}} debts {{incurred}} {{as a result of the}} Frobisher expeditions in 1576-8. In 1587 Dee's lease was in some way taken over by his former pupil, Adrian Gilbert, brother of Sir Humphrey Gilbert, and John Poppler, a London lapidary. Gilbert and Bulmer then {{entered into a}} bargain whereby Bulmer would work the mine and bear the costs, and he and Gilbert would have an equal share of the profits. The mine developed by Bulmer, Fayes Mine, is said by Atkinson to have been 32 <b>fathoms</b> deep and 32 <b>fathoms</b> wide, and to have yielded Bulmer and Gilbert £10,000 apiece for the first two years of operation, although the output dropped to £1000 during the mine's final year. Dee returned to England in 1589, and on 19 December was generously compensated by Gilbert. Two 'famous bowls' were later made of silver taken from Fayes Mine.|$|E
25|$|At 11 pm in the moonlight, Equino {{had cleared}} for battle, stood in and bore {{down upon the}} three English ships. The English were {{surprised}} with many still on shore in the dark but as the Spanish approached, they placed and anchored themselves in seven <b>fathoms</b> of water just off a sandbar. Spanish combat tactics during this time {{was an attempt to}} grapple and then board. English tactics on the other hand was the heavy use of firepower to batter opponents into submission.|$|E
25|$|Sun wampum {{were the}} red, white, and purple beads of {{cylindrical}} shape, drilled through the center, {{used to make}} strings of wampum and to make belts or sashes.

25|$|Two men, in {{the hope}} of {{finishing}} early, and contrary to established Leadhills custom, had entered the mine before 4AM; another two, presumably from the same partnership, entered soon after. Reaching their work level (at 25 <b>fathoms)</b> the first two encountered the bad air. They persisted, thinking they could force their way through it, began to feel dizzy, collapsed, and eventually suffocated. The next two encountered a similar fate. The accident was not discovered until some time after 6AM; by which time all of the four men were dead.|$|E
25|$|By now, {{the water}} under Entreprenantes keel {{was less than}} three <b>fathoms</b> (5 m) and Williams was obliged to tack. He turned his {{attention}} to the prize, and after firing a few shots, boarded her and took possession. She was the Spanish brig St. Joseph (San Jose), out of Cadiz and Gibraltar, and had been captured whilst sailing to Tarragona. Williams took her in tow and sailed her out of the harbour. Hundreds of spectators on the mole head at Málaga watched the action. Entreprenante accomplished the entire engagement without taking any casualties. This was to be Entreprenantes last action.|$|E
25|$|As a result, {{science fiction}} film came {{into its own}} in the 1950s, {{producing}} films like Destination Moon, Them!, Invasion of the Body Snatchers, Forbidden Planet, and many others. Many of these movies were based on stories by Campbell's writers. The Thing from Another World was adapted from a Campbell story, Them and Invasion of the Body Snatchers were based on Jack Finney novels, Destination Moon on a Heinlein novel, and The Beast from 20,000 <b>Fathoms</b> was derived from a Ray Bradbury short story. John Wyndham's cosy catastrophes, including The Day of the Triffids and The Kraken Wakes, provided important source material as well.|$|E
