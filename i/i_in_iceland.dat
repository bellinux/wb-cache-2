5000|$|In a monarchy, a regent usually governs due to one {{of these}} reasons, but may also be elected to rule during the interregnum when the royal line has died out. This {{was the case in the}} Kingdom of Finland and the Kingdom of Hungary, where the royal line was {{considered}} extinct in the aftermath of World War <b>I.</b> <b>In</b> <b>Iceland,</b> the regent represented the King of Denmark as sovereign of Iceland until the country became a republic in 1944. In the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (1569-1795), kings were elective, which often led to a fairly long interregnum. In the interim, it was the Roman Catholic Primate (the Archbishop of Gniezno) who served as the regent, termed the [...] "interrex" [...] (Latin: ruler [...] "between kings" [...] as in ancient Rome). In the small republic of San Marino, the two Captains Regent, or Capitani Reggenti, are elected semi-annually (they serve a six-month term) as joint heads of state and of government.|$|E
40|$|The rock site {{characterization}} for {{earthquake engineering}} applications in Iceland is common {{due to the}} easily exposed older bedrock and more recent volcanic lava rock. The corresponding site amplification is generally assumed to be low but has not been comprehensively quantified, especially for volcanic rock. The earthquake strong-motion of the Mw 6. 3 Ölfus earthquake on 29 May 2008 and 1705 of its aftershocks recorded on the first small-aperture strong-motion array (ICEARRAY <b>I)</b> <b>in</b> <b>Iceland</b> showed consistent and significant variations in ground motion amplitudes over short distances (< 2 km) in an urban area located mostly on lava rock. This study analyses the aftershock recordings to quantify the local site effects using the Horizontal to Vertical Spectral Ratio (HVSR) and Standard Spectral Ratio (SSR) methods. Additionally, microseismic data has been collected at array stations and analyzed using the HVSR method. The results between the methods are consistent and show that while the amplification levels remain relatively low, the predominant frequency varies systematically between stations and is found to correlate with the geological units. In particular, for stations on lava rock the underlying geologic structure is characterized by repeated lava-soil stratigraphy characterized by reversals in the shear wave velocity with depth. As a result, standard modeling of HVSR using vertically incident body waves does not apply. Instead, modeling the soil structure as a two-degree-of-freedom dynamic system is found to capture the observed predominant frequencies of site amplification. The results {{have important implications for}} earthquake resistant design of structures on rock sites characterized by velocity reversals. © 2016 Elsevier Lt...|$|E

40|$|From the introduction]. The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} Icelandic intra-party politics through the lens of principal-agent relationships. <b>In</b> particular, <b>I</b> examine the divergence between power relationships in “domestic” politics and EU politics. The main finding is that this discrepancy is large. After explaining why this is so, in the final section of the paper I discuss what this implies for representative democracy as a direct chain from voters to parliament to the executive and the civil servants. The empirical data in this paper builds on published work and on a set of 15 semi-structured interviews with MPs and party managers that <b>I</b> conducted <b>in</b> <b>Iceland</b> <b>in</b> March 2007. In a later version of the paper, detailed distinctions will be made between these interviews. For now, however, the interviews are presented as a whole and only the main themes of these interviews are reported.

The aims of the study were to compare the pattern and subjective effects of i. v. MPH use to other i. v. psychostimulants and examine whether the pattern of use differs among MPH preparations. This is a nationwide descriptive study. Information was collected from 95 i. v. substance users undergoing inpatient detoxification and reporting i. v. MPH use in the last 30 days using a semi-structured interview. MPH SR was both the most commonly used (96 %) and preferred i. v. psychostimulant (57 %). The intensity and duration of 'euphoria' did not differ between cocaine and MPH SR. No participant reported MPH OROS as their preferred substance even though a third had used it in the past month. The pattern of i. v. MPH use is similar to other psychostimulants among treatment seeking patients. MPH OROS was the least preferred i. v. psychostimulant, despite having the largest market share <b>in</b> <b>Iceland.</b> The results indicate that MPH OROS has less abuse potential than other MPH preparations...|$|R

40|$|The {{history of}} dance {{as an art}} form <b>in</b> <b>Iceland</b> is young. It is highly {{influenced}} by the Western canonical history of dance but at the same time, that history cannot be considered the history of contemporary dance <b>in</b> <b>Iceland.</b> This paper is concerned with discussing the ambiguous relationship that exists between the Western canonical history of dance and the history and genealogy of contemporary dance <b>in</b> <b>Iceland.</b> <b>I</b> will argue <b>in</b> this paper that the ambiguous relations Icelandic contemporary dance holds with its past is problematic in terms of how dance is made <b>in</b> <b>Iceland</b> and how it can be observed critically. When it comes to terminology within the local dance discourse this paper will highlight how this ambiguity can be seen to have created confusion in the way terminology has emerged in the Icelandic vocabulary. When one looks at the aesthetics of styles and genres of contemporary dance <b>in</b> <b>Iceland,</b> {{it is clear that the}} scene has not been created in a void. It has been formed from influences, genres and styles from Europe and North - America that have found their way on to the island. At the same time, the island is not intrinsically linked to either the scenes of Europe and North America. <b>In</b> this thesis <b>I</b> intend to locate and identify contemporary dance as it takes place <b>in</b> <b>Iceland</b> presently. To do so I will attempt to give an account of the origins, traces and current discourses of the contemporary dance scene <b>in</b> <b>Iceland.</b> As such, this thesis can be understood and read as an attempt to critically locate, identify and map contemporary dance as it is understood and practiced <b>in</b> <b>Iceland</b> presently...|$|R
