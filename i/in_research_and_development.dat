5|$|Bahrain invests little <b>in</b> <b>research</b> <b>and</b> <b>development.</b> In 2009 and 2013, this {{investment}} reportedly amounted to 0.04% of GDP, although {{the data were}} incomplete, covering only the higher education sector. The lack of comprehensive data {{on research and development}} poses a challenge for policy-makers, as data inform evidence-based policy-making.|$|E
5|$|In January 1992 Walsh {{was made}} chief {{executive}} of Pillsbury, {{in addition to his}} job as CFO of the Grand Met food division. He identified the various divisions of Pillsbury as poorly integrated and reined in their independence to make them more accountable to head office. He also invested heavily <b>in</b> <b>research</b> <b>and</b> <b>development,</b> technology, IT systems and marketing. A boosted marketing budget helped to grow Häagen-Dazs from a well known US brand to a product with global reach, {{and one of the best}} known names in luxury ice cream.|$|E
5|$|The new {{business}} model required additional capital. To this end, {{the company was}} sold to Banner Productions in 1965, with Gottschalk remaining as president. Panavision would soon expand into markets beyond Hollywood, eventually including New York, Europe, Australia, Hong Kong, and Southeast Asia. Kinney National Company bought out Banner in 1968 and took over Warner Bros.-Seven Arts the following year, eventually renaming itself Warner Communications due to a financial scandal. Kinney/Warner's financial resources made possible a massive expansion in Panavision's inventory, as well as substantial leaps <b>in</b> <b>research</b> <b>and</b> <b>development.</b>|$|E

5|$|During 1997, BK revamped its French fries in North America. The {{improved}} fries were {{coated with}} a layer of potato-based starch, giving the fries a crisp shell that maintained its texture longer. The company introduced them in a series of advertisements that claimed the new fries tasted better than McDonald's fries in consumer taste comparisons. Other ads featured Mr. Potato Head in a series of demographically-targeted commercials. The fries were <b>in</b> <b>research</b> <b>and</b> <b>development</b> for over two years and already had been available in several markets when the advertising campaign began. In Europe, BK also sells potato wedges, a type of French fry that is thick-cut and wedge-shaped. In 1991, the company introduced Twister fries, spiral-cut fries with a spicy coating, as part of a promotional push. Part of the product's appeal was they were served in a paper drink cup as opposed to the normal fry carton. The product was designed as a short-term promotion that would be periodically reintroduced.|$|E
5|$|In 1901, {{the year}} that Jacob Rogers died and {{the same year that}} the American Locomotive Company (ALCO) was formed through the merger of eight other {{locomotive}} manufacturers, the company reopened as the Rogers Locomotive Works. Reuben Wells was again the shop superintendent. But Rogers was at a competitive disadvantage. Not enough capital investment was made to purchase new equipment or <b>in</b> <b>research</b> <b>and</b> <b>development.</b> ALCO and Baldwin, the two companies that were at the time the largest locomotive manufacturers in North America, held too much of a lead in manufacturing and selling their own locomotives for Rogers to keep up. Compounding Rogers' troubles was the greater city of Paterson that had grown up around the shop. There was not any room for Rogers to expand.|$|E
5|$|In {{connection}} with his {{background as a}} musician, Lee founded the record label Monster Music in 1999, signing Van Morrison's daughter Shana. Monster created numerous divisions as it diversified into other products, such as Monster Performance Car, Monster Game, Monster Photo and Monster Computer. By 2003, Monster produced more than 1,000 products, including power cords, gaming accessories and cooling products. According to a 2005 USA Today article, Lee and his company were developing furniture with high-end electronics built-in, wireless products to replace audio cords and a user interface to consolidate the consumer's control of their electronics. Lee and his son worked with Dr. Dre to collaborate on the Beats brand of headphones, which was later acquired by Apple for $3 billion in 2014. According to Business Insider, Beats Electronics denies that Monster {{had a role in}} the design of the headphones. Lee said Beats had no engineers on staff and it spent millions <b>in</b> <b>research</b> <b>and</b> <b>development</b> to get the product started, but that their contract was poorly constructed, giving all the intellectual property to Beats when it wasn't renewed.|$|E

5|$|The Bahraini Economic Vision 2030 {{published}} in 2008 {{does not indicate}} how the stated goal of shifting from an economy built on oil wealth to a productive, globally competitive economy will be attained. Bahrain has already diversified its exports to some extent, out of necessity. It has the smallest hydrocarbon reserves of any Gulf state, producing 48,000 barrels per day from its one onshore field. The bulk of the country’s revenue comes from its share in the offshore field administered by Saudi Arabia. The gas reserve in Bahrain is expected to last for less than 27 years, leaving the country with few sources of capital to pursue {{the development of new}} industries.
