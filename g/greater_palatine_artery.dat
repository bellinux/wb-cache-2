25|$|Like the face, {{the human}} nose is well vascularized with arteries and veins, and thus {{supplied}} with abundant blood. The principal arterial blood-vessel {{supply to the}} nose is two-fold: (i) branches from the internal carotid artery, the branch of the anterior ethmoid artery, the branch of the posterior ethmoid artery, which derive from the ophthalmic artery; (ii) branches from the external carotid artery, the sphenopalatine artery, the <b>greater</b> <b>palatine</b> <b>artery,</b> the superior labial artery, and the angular artery.|$|E
25|$|Internally, {{the lateral}} nasal wall is {{supplied}} with blood by the sphenopalatine artery (from behind and below) {{and by the}} anterior ethmoid artery and the posterior ethmoid artery (from above and behind). The nasal septum also is supplied with blood by the sphenopalatine artery, and by the anterior and posterior ethmoid arteries, with the additional circulatory contributions of the superior labial artery and of the <b>greater</b> <b>palatine</b> <b>artery.</b> These three (3) vascular supplies to the internal nose converge in the Kiesselbach plexus (the Little area), which is a region in the anteroinferior-third of the nasal septum, (in front and below). Furthermore, the nasal vein vascularisation of the nose generally follows the arterial pattern of nasal vascularisation. The nasal veins are biologically significant, {{because they have no}} vessel-valves, and because of their direct, circulatory communication to the sinus caverns, which makes possible the potential intracranial spreading of a bacterial infection of the nose. Hence, because of such an abundant nasal blood supply, tobacco smoking does therapeutically compromise post-operative healing.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: During {{cleft palate}} repair, velopharyngeal {{sphincter}} reconstruction {{is still a}} challenge to plastic surgeons. To improve results of surgical treatment of cleft palate and secondary velopharyngeal incompetence, a carefully designed modified procedure for palatoplasty is presented. Materials and Methods: Thirty patients with incomplete cleft palate corrected by this procedure from April 2003 to October 2007 were included. A u-shaped incision {{was made in the}} anterior palate to separate bipedicle flap based on the <b>greater</b> <b>palatine</b> <b>arteries</b> of both sides. After complete dissection of the nasal and palatal mucosa, palatal muscles were carefully dissected from the posterior edge of the bones of the hard palate, wherein the well-mobilised flap receded backward spontaneously and elongated the soft palate. After suturing the nasal mucosa in the midline, the dissected palatal muscles of both sides were sutured together in the anterior third of the soft palate. On suturing the nasal mucosa and the palatal muscles, the soft palate became elongated and the oral mucosa was seen receding backward spontaneously to cover the anterior part of the soft palate. Results: All corrected patients showed good results, with no recurrence, no post-operative fistulae, with accepted speech pattern and no need for further pharyngoplasty. The line of the sutured nasal mucosa and the palatal muscles became covered by the healthy non-sutured oral mucosa and the soft palate became elongated, with narrowing of the vellopharyngeal isthmus after this technique. Conclusion: The designed flap allows covering of sutured nasal mucosa and palatal muscles with a healthy unsutured oral mucosa and elongates the soft palate. Thus, there was no incidence of post-operative fistula and no need for further pharyngoplasties...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Understanding {{the anatomy}} of the pterygomaxillary {{junction}} region helps prevent blood loss in Le Fort I osteotomy. Here, we determined {{the location of the}} descending <b>palatine</b> <b>artery</b> and the structure of the pterygomaxillary region. Patients and methods: The study group consisted of 82 Japanese patients with mandibular prognathism and asymmetry, with and without maxillary retrognathism or asymmetry. A total of 164 sides were measured and divided into right versus left, men versus women, and bimaxillary osteotomy (B) versus mandibular osteotomy (S). Lateral and frontal cephalograms and computed tomography (CT) were analysed for all patients. The relationship between the cephalometric measurements and the measurements of the descending <b>palatine</b> <b>artery</b> and pterygoid plate (PP) were assessed. Results: There were no significant correlations between measurements of cephalograms and those of the descending <b>palatine</b> <b>artery</b> and PPs. There were significant differences between right and left in lateral plate length (p = 0. 0014) and thickness of PP (p = 0. 0047). There were significant {{differences between men and women}} in right width of PP (p = 0. 0034), right thickness of PP (p = 0. 0063), left posterior length (p = 0. 0196), and left thickness of PP (p = 0. 0279). The B group had a shorter anterior length than the S group (right: p < 0. 0001, left: p = 0. 0027). Conclusion: These results suggest that the location of the descending <b>palatine</b> <b>artery</b> and the morphology of the PPs were not significantly associated with any cephalometric measurements.

30|$|The first {{description}} of a technique for closing oroantral fistula using a full-thickness palatal flap based on <b>greater</b> <b>palatine</b> <b>artery</b> dates back to Ashley [15]. Advantages of the palatal flap include high vascularity, generous thickness, and quality of tissue. Moreover, this flap is more resilient, less prone to infection, very resistant to lacerations, and {{does not lead to}} lowering of the vestibule. However, the most significant disadvantages are flap necrosis [15], exposed bony surface, pain, and development of surface irregularities as a result of secondary epithelialization post operatively [2]. In 1980, Ehrl employed this technique with wide fistulas of 1  cm in diameter [16]. The technique consists of excising the epithelium from its edges and incising the palatal fibro-mucosa so as to create a flap with a posterior base, supplied by the <b>greater</b> <b>palatine</b> <b>artery.</b> The anterior extension of the flap must be wide enough to exceed the diameter of the bony defect and long enough to allow lateral rotation. Tension-free suturing should be performed [8].|$|E
30|$|The {{success rate}} of cleft palate surgery is {{influenced}} by many factors. The main flap for the cleft palate surgery is fed by the <b>greater</b> <b>palatine</b> <b>artery</b> and the lesser palatine artery [24]. If the palatal defect is wide, the flap width will be narrowed. These long narrow flaps may cause problems with blood circulation, and wide expanses of exposed raw bone surface can cause extensive wound contracture after the operation [24 – 26]. Ischemic damage and wound contracture is {{the main cause of}} postoperative palatal fistula. The incidence of postoperative palatal fistula is reported to be 4.6 – 12.5 % and is dependent on the degree of the tissue defect [27]. Wound contracture after operation can cause shortening of the soft palate and may result in velopharyngeal insufficiency [28].|$|E
40|$|This {{technical}} note describes a new surgical technique for a palatal {{approach to the}} maxillary sinus for a vertical augmentation prior to dental implant placement. In 12 fully or partially edentulous patients (seven women, five men), 16 palatal sinus elevations were performed.

The raised sinus cavity was augmented with a synthetic nano-structured hydroxyapatite-based graft material. No harm occurred to the <b>greater</b> <b>palatine</b> <b>artery</b> or the sinus membrane. The vestibular and periimplant gingiva were preserved {{and there was no}} disharmonious soft tissue distortion or massive scar formation. Swelling and bleeding were minimal. Primary stability was achieved for all but one implant.

40|$|Introduction: Every {{dental health}} {{professional}} {{should have the}} essential knowledge to identify, assess and manage a potentially life-threatening situation. Aim: To assess the experience, awareness, and perceptions about medical emergencies among dental interns in Chennai city, India. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study carried out in four randomly selected dental colleges of Chennai city. Data were collected using a self-administered, structured, closed-ended 20 -item questionnaire. It consists of questions on experience of medical emergencies encountered by interns during their graduation, awareness of the essential drugs and equipment, the amount of medical emergencies training undertaken by participants, preparedness of interns in handling medical emergencies. Descriptive statistics, independent sample t-test, were used. Results: Out of 335 interns, 157 (47 %) said that syncope {{was the most common}} medical emergency event encountered by the interns. Regarding awareness about essential drugs, about 161 (48 %) study participants answered oxygen, epinephrine, nitroglycerin, antihistamine, salbutamol, and aspirin as emergency drugs. About half of the study participants, 187 (56 %) were aware that pressure should be given to the affected site, with or without suturing if the <b>greater</b> <b>palatine</b> <b>artery</b> is inadvertently cut.

30|$|Perforation of the sinus {{membrane}} is {{the most}} common intra-operative complication in maxillary sinus floor augmentation. According to a systematic review, mean prevalence of membrane perforation was 19.5  % [6]. Membrane perforation was usually closed by fibrin glue, suturing or, covering them with a collagen membrane. Depending on the size and location of the perforation, a sufficient quantity of bone augmentation is not possible in the optimal site. In cases of larger perforations, discontinuation of SFA, and reoperation after healing of the sinus membrane may be a more reliable method. However, the staged recovery approach requires an additional treatment period. In the present case, bone volume required for implant placement was supplemented by the first SFA. Additional SFA with the palatal window osteotomy technique was able to graft in palatal sinus cavity which is the insufficient bone volume area. A particular advantage of the palatal window osteotomy is that it can easily approach the cavity compared to buccal window osteotomy, when buccal bone in maxillary sinus is thick and long. From these findings, it may be suggested that maxillary sinus augmentation with the palatal window osteotomy approach is useful in compensation of the palatal sinus cavity. Caution should be exercised during elevation of the palatal flap and osteotomy preparation in the palatal wall to avoid damage to the greater palatine neurovascular bundle (GPB) which contains <b>greater</b> <b>palatine</b> <b>artery,</b> vein, and nerve. Since GPB exits through the greater palatine foramen and runs anteriorly in the bone groove of the palate, three-dimensional analysis using CBCT or CT would reduce surgical complications [7]. Further studies are needed to confirm the efficiency of the palatal window osteotomy technique.|$|E
