40|$|The mesolimbic and nigrostriatal {{dopamine}} (DA) systems play a {{key role}} in the physiology of reward seeking, motivation and motor control. Importantly, they are also involved in the pathophysiology of Parkinson’s and Huntington’s disease, schizophrenia and addiction. Control of DA release in the striatum is tightly linked to firing of DA neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and the substantia nigra (SN). However, local influences in the striatum affect release by exerting their action directly on axon terminals. For example, endogenous glutamatergic and cholinergic activity is sufficient to trigger striatal DA release independently of cell <b>body</b> <b>firing.</b> Recent <b>developments</b> involving genetic manipulation, pharmacological selectivity or selective stimulation have allowed for better characterization of these phenomena. Such termino-terminal forms of control of DA release transform considerably our understanding of the mesolimbic and nigrostriatal systems, and have strong implications as potential mechanisms to modify impaired control of DA release in the diseased brain. Here, we review these and related mechanisms and their implications in the physiology of ascending DA systems...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The main {{alkaline}} fluxes are sodium feldspar, {{potash feldspar}} while alkaline earth auxiliary fluxes are calcite, magnesite, dolomite, sepiolite, palygorskite and talc. The {{objective of the}} first part of study is to discover firing behavior of magnesite-rich clay within the Ca-rich ceramic bodies. The physical properties, including water adsorption (WA), firing shrinkage (FS) and firing-bending strength (BS) were determined. Replacing the opening materials (grog, sand and marble) with magnesite rich clay (Eskişehir clay) at the ratios of 3, 6, 9, 11, 12, 15 % has effect on firing shrinkage water absorption and bending strength. Eskişehir clay increases bending strength and <b>firing</b> shrinkage. The <b>body</b> containing 15 mass % Eskişehir clay had WA: 15. 51, FS: 3. 80 and BS: 272. 39 kgf/cm 2 after firing at 1150 °C. As the peak temperature is raised within the range of 980 ºC- 1250 ºC, the crystalline constituents were identified as quartz, anorthite, gehlenite, diopside and cristobalite. After 1150 °C, the most important change in the <b>fired</b> <b>bodies</b> was the complete reaction of the quartz.

40|$|Abstract 				 				 					 						Background 					The {{transition}} from the vegetative mycelium to the primordium during fruiting <b>body</b> <b>development</b> is the most complex and critical developmental event in {{the life cycle of}} many basidiomycete fungi. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying this process has long been a goal of research on basidiomycetes. Large scale assessment of the expressed transcriptomes of these developmental stages will facilitate the generation of a more comprehensive picture of the mushroom fruiting process. In this study, we coupled 5 '-Serial Analysis of Gene Expression (5 '-SAGE) to high-throughput pyrosequencing from 454 Life Sciences to analyze the transcriptomes and identify up-regulated genes among vegetative mycelium (Myc) and stage 1 primordium (S 1 -Pri) of Coprinopsis cinerea during fruiting <b>body</b> <b>development.</b> 				 				 					 						Results 					We evaluated the expression of > 3, 000 genes in the two respective growth stages and discovered that almost one-third of these genes were preferentially expressed in either stage. This identified a significant turnover of the transcriptome during the course of fruiting <b>body</b> <b>development.</b> Additionally, we annotated more than 79, 000 transcription start sites (TSSs) based on the transcriptomes of the mycelium and stage 1 primoridum stages. Patterns of enrichment based on gene annotations from the GO and KEGG databases indicated that various structural and functional protein families were uniquely employed in either stage and that during primordial growth, cellular metabolism is highly up-regulated. Various signaling pathways such as the cAMP-PKA, MAPK and TOR pathways were also identified as up-regulated, consistent with the model that sensing of nutrient levels and the environment are important in this developmental transition. More than 100 up-regulated genes were also found to be unique to mushroom forming basidiomycetes, highlighting the novelty of fruiting <b>body</b> <b>development</b> in the fungal kingdom. 				 				 					 						Conclusions 					We implicated a wealth of new candidate genes important to early stages of mushroom fruiting development, though their precise molecular functions and biological roles are not yet fully known.

The pigs were group-housed in commercial type grower houses and fed a diet consisting of 14 MJ/kg energy, 18 % CP and 1. 1 % lysine during the growth period up to a live weight of 65 kg, followed by a diet consisting 13. 5 MJ/kg, 16 % CP and 0. 9 % lysine from 65 kg to 90 kg and then a diet consisting of 13. 2 MJ/kg, 15 % CP and 0. 7 % lysine from 90 kg onwards. Pigs were slaughtered at 116, 130, 144, 158, 172, 186, 200 and 214 days of age. Gonadal growth and development were measured in gilts (ovary length, ovary width, ovary thickness, ovary weight, ovary volume, follicle number, {{and size of the}} largest follicle), boars (testis length, testis width, testis weight and testis volume) and <b>body</b> <b>development</b> parameters (slaughter weight, warm carcass weight, carcass length, chest depth, dressing percentage and P 2 backfat thickness) were compared. Differences between means were tested using breed, sex and slaughter age as fixed effects, while the relationships between gonadal and <b>body</b> <b>development</b> parameters were evaluated by means of correlation analysis. Genotype 5 had a significantly shorter ovary length than Genotype 4 and Genotype 2. Genotype 2 gilts also had heavier ovaries and larger ovary volumes than Genotype 5 gilts. In boars, Genotype 2 had significantly heavier testes weights than Genotype 5 boars. Genotype 5 boars also tended to have smaller testis volumes than Genotype 2 boars. In <b>body</b> <b>development,</b> Genotype 2 gilts and boars were superior to the Genotype 5 in terms of slaughter and warm carcass weights, while Genotype 3 seconded Genotype 2. The average P 2 backfat thicknesses were 11. 88 mm and 13. 68 mm for boars and gilts respectively. Correlations between gonadal and <b>body</b> <b>development</b> parameters were low to moderate in the gilts (r = - 0. 305 to 0. 555) and moderate to high in boars (r = 0. 560 to 0. 871). However, dressing percentage, follicle number and size of the largest follicle correlated poorly with all other measurements. It is concluded from the study that although Genotype 5 do not grow to the same size and at the same rate compared to the other genotypes, they appear to be the most suitable for the production of top quality pork in terms of its low backfat thickness. Genotype 5 pigs were also characterized with a slower gonadal growth and <b>body</b> <b>development</b> compared to Genotype 2 pigs. Results from this study suggest that selecting against backfat may delay gonadal development and sexual maturation in pigs.
