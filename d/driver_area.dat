5000|$|The {{discernible}} {{motion of}} each diaphragm flexure is very small, {{but because of}} the folded structure, more air is moved than would be by a conventional cone or electrostatic driver of the same plotted surface area. As a matter of surface comparison, a standard 1 in AMT strip has a functional <b>driver</b> <b>area</b> comparable to an 8 in circular dynamic cone. The folded driver design, combined with the small motion range, means the AMT acts like a point source version of a larger driver, inherently resulting in lower sound reproduction distortion. As a result of its motion pattern, the AMT [...] "spits" [...] the air out in a way similar to the action of shooting a watermelon seed from your hand by squeezing it between thumb and forefinger. The speed of the air as it leaves the diaphragm is approximately five times faster than the speed of the actual driver structure, hence the name, Air Motion Transformer.|$|E
40|$|This {{project has}} been {{commissioned}} by Elof AB. Elof AB {{is a company that}} manufactures lift equipment for heavy lifts indoors. These machines are manufactured in very small series and are often adapted for specific customers with additional equipment. The assignment for this master thesis was to redesign the existing drive unit D 300. The main goal was to change the <b>driver</b> <b>area</b> by improving the visibility, the ergonomics, the accessibility, and analyzing any problem that may exist with the present design of the <b>driver</b> <b>area</b> and solve these issues. To get a deeper insight and understanding of the problem a number of analyzes were made that ended up in a list of specifications that were approved by Elof AB. Different creative methods were used that generated 12 different <b>driver</b> <b>area</b> concepts. These were thoroughly evaluated with a number of evaluation methods which led to one concept that were chosen for further development. During the development of the concept it became partly modified when it´s disadvantages were removed and strengths of other concepts were implemented. When this was finished the <b>driver</b> <b>area</b> concept was designed in detail with UGS NX 6. 0. In the new <b>driver</b> <b>area</b> the driver has been given more space and possibility to always be facing a desired direction. The design and placement of the controllers has been improved significantly and the driver can adjust certain components of the seat to achieve good ergonomics. The design of the ladder has been improved with a simpler solution. The general design of the concept has been consciously chosen in a way that creates harmony in both shape and color. The final design of the concept was evaluated in comparison with the current <b>driver</b> <b>area</b> on D 300 and the result was very satisfying. The goal to improve the design of the <b>driver</b> <b>area</b> is fulfilled, but more work needs to be done on the <b>driver</b> <b>area</b> and the drive unit before it is ready for production.

40|$|Abstract—A {{low-power}} compact {{driver for}} multi-standard physical layer is presented. The proposed driver achieves low power and small area through the voltage-mode driver with trans-impedance configuration and the novel hybrid driver,. In the voltage-mode driver, a trans-impedance configuration alleviates {{the problem of}} limited common-mode range of error amplifiers and the area and power overhead due to pre-amplifier. For a standard with extended output swing, only current sources are added in parallel with the voltage-mode driver, which is named a ‘hybrid driver’. The hybrid architecture not only increases output swing but reduces overall <b>driver</b> <b>area.</b> The overall driver occupies 0. 14 mm 2. Power consumptions under 3. 3 -V supply are 24. 5 mW for the voltage-mode driver and 44. 5 mW for the hybrid driver.

40|$|Aim of the study: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate recent technological improvements to forest bundlers: a new cutting device with shears and a mechanism which allows the bundling pressure to be changed by the <b>driver.</b> <b>Area</b> of study: eucalyptus plantations in Northern Spain. Material and Methods: Several time studies were performed in order to compare and calculate productivity depending on the machine: John Deere bundler working with the traditional chainsaw and Monra bundler equipped with the technological improvements of shears and adjustable bundling pressure. Research highlights: Significant differences were found between cutting devices (shears and chainsaw) and between the Monra working at maximum pressure and at lower pressure. Shears were shown to be a more robust and reliable cutting device, with 1. 02 cutting attempts per bundle compared to 1. 55 with chain saw. The use of shears made the loading more efficient as it eliminates the need to shake the residues before feeding the bundler. A great advantage of this technological improvement is that it can be incorporated into other machines and thus improve bundling efficiency. In spite of this, working at standard bundling pressure, the productivity of the Monra bundler is only 3. 2 per cent higher than that of the John Deere due to the fact that in the latter bundling is faster and it produces bundles with significantly more dry mass. For the Monra bundler, the option of producing lighter bundles further reduced productivity compared to when standard weight bundles are produced. However, it would be of interest to study the effect of the machine working at various pressures in order to optimize the work system. It is possible that working at higher pressures would have advantages in terms of increasing transport efficiency...|$|E
40|$|Driving {{a car is}} {{visually}} highly demanding, {{since it}} includes searching for, detecting and reading information. The information shall then be interpreted and valued, {{as a part of}} the decision making process – often within a short period of time. From time to time the amount of information exceed the capacity of the driver, and this increases the risk of an accident. Volvo Car Corporation wanted to find of if the driver’s situation, and safety, could be helped by presenting some information in a higher position than today, above the steering wheel. It was of interest to see what kind of visual information would benefit the most from this position and how the information should be designed. Two technical solutions where evaluated: one display with perceived depth, ‘advanced driver display’ (ADD), developed by Jaguar, and one ‘head-up display’ (HUD), designed by BMW. Literature studies and interviews with people experienced in developing the <b>driver</b> <b>area,</b> have formed a base on which the evaluations are built. A HUD solution is recommended for presenting information which seeks the driver’s attention and is related to the driving task, example of this is warnings and navigation help. This kind of information should be salient and placed in a high location, between 4 ° and 8 ° down from a horizontal line of sight in the driver’s field of view (vertically), to be quick to read and to enable the driver to use the peripheral vision to detect danger and traffic. It is important to keep the amount of information as low as possible. A focal distance greater than 2. 5 m makes it easy for the driver to refocus. Green is recommended as the main colour and red is recommended for acute warnings. The height of alphanumerics is recommended to cover the driver’s field of view at least 0. 40 ° vertically. Since symbols often hold more information per area it is recommended that they are larger than the alphanumerics. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{question}} How can {{the design of}} buses and systems of design for route bus bodywork manufacture reduce {{the negative effects of}} specification diversity? by examining the application of mass customisation processes to an area of bespoke production – the public route bus. The route bus is an essential element of the transport system providing cost efficient public transport, but route buses are manufactured to the specification of bus operators and this design may differ significantly from other bus operators whose supply of vehicles is from the same bodywork manufacturer. The bus bodywork manufacturer must accommodate this specification diversity. The present method for doing so is by means of bespoke production to ensure the bus meets the operator’s explicit specification, but this process is time consuming and expensive in design and manufacture. Where diversity is accommodated by bespoke manufacturing there are functional benefits to the bus operator and passenger, however there are negative consequences in manufacture. This research set out to determine methods of reducing the repercussions of specification diversity; vehicle cost, design and engineering time, and production efficiency. This was achieved by generating physical designs and design methods balancing the bus operators’ access to a suitable product and the manufacturer’s ability to increase efficiency and quality of that product. The research methods explored mass customisation theories through product design experiments. This method required seeking out theoretical perspectives on the research problem and bringing them to bear on two studio experiments – the design of a <b>driver’s</b> <b>area</b> and a bus interior to meet the requirements of all stakeholders in bus transport. The research resulted in four critical interventions to the present bespoke manufacturing methodology, establishing means of reducing the negative impacts of specification diversity in route bus design. The four interventions are demonstrated {{in the development of a}} bus <b>driver’s</b> <b>area</b> and a suite of bus interior components. The bus <b>driver’s</b> <b>area</b> has been carried through to full production for the Australian bus market, while the bus interior demonstrates an extended implementation of intervention four; where the diversity of user requirements in the bus interior necessitate a completely modular system of components. 1. Determine user needs before the bus specification process. 2. Designs to be developed by the manufacturer in response to user needs. 3. This design should be standardised where possible, as suggested by the user needs. 4. Where user needs dictate product variations, apply a mass customisation approach to accommodate these needs. The interventions constitute a contribution to knowledge by their implementation in two design projects, one of which resulted in products adopted by the route bus manufacturer and market...|$|R

The theoretical part contains description of selected models. Described models are then applied to a real dataset in the practical part. The real dataset modelling was performed using the statistical software R. It has been proved that maximum likelihood parameter estimations are of better quality than the method of moments or quantile method estimations. The results of aggregate loss distribution computational methods are comparable. This comparability is mostly caused by a large number of observations.
