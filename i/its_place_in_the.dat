5|$|As {{soon as the}} {{heaviest}} attacks subsided against the 25th Division, Walker ordered it to release the 5th Regimental Combat Team on September 7 to move to other engagements along the Pusan Perimeter. The continuing fighting north of Taegu made it necessary to move reserves there. That evening the 1st and 2nd Battalions, 27th Infantry, moved from the Nam River battlefield to relieve the 5th Regimental Combat Team on the Masan front. 27th commander Colonel John H. Michaelis assumed command of the regimental zone at 15:00 on September 9. The 3rd Battalion, 27th Infantry, broke off its counterattacks on Battle Mountain that day, rejoined the regiment, and took <b>its</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{southern end of the}} line on September 11. Meanwhile, the 5th Regimental Combat Team began moving to Samnangjin on the September 10. Upon arrival at Samnangjin, it passed to Eighth Army reserve.|$|E

5|$|Equally, Gaudí {{stood out}} as {{interior}} decorator, decorating {{most of his}} buildings personally, from the furnishings to the smallest details. In each case {{he knew how to}} apply stylistic particularities, personalising the decoration according to the owner's taste, the predominant style of the arrangement or <b>its</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> surroundings—whether urban or natural, secular or religious. Many of his works were related to liturgical furnishing. From the design of a desk for his office {{at the beginning of his}} career to the furnishings designed for the Sobrellano Palace of Comillas, he designed all furnishing of the Vicens, Calvet, Batlló and Milà houses, of the Güell Palace and the Bellesguard Tower, and the liturgical furnishing of the Sagrada Família. It is noteworthy that Gaudí studied some ergonomy in order to adapt his furnishings to human anatomy. Many of his furnishings are exhibited at Gaudi House Museum.|$|E
5|$|Madsen's {{first year}} as {{chairman}} of the club proved to be a difficult year for Malmö FF as they were relegated from Allsvenskan for the first time, leaving the top flight {{for the first time since}} the club's demotion in 1934, ending a run of 63 consecutive seasons in the first division. Madsen and the club's director of sports, Hasse Borg, initiated a programme for Malmö FF to regain <b>its</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> top league, and the club was promoted back to Allsvenskan in 2000, after one season in Superettan. Nineteen-year-old Zlatan Ibrahimović emerged as the club's leading goalscorer, scoring 12 goals in 26 games. Ibrahimović was sold to Ajax in 2001 for 86.2million SEK (approximately €10.2million); as of 2012, this is the highest transfer fee paid to a Swedish football club.|$|E
5|$|Repair work {{commenced}} on {{the garden}} and undercroft in early 2008—the beams and columns supporting the terrace having become dangerously weak—and was scheduled to take three years to complete. The council commissioned NPS Architectural Group to oversee restoration {{and work on the}} memorial itself started in September 2009; the council initially hoped that the project would be complete by Armistice Day 2010. During the repair work the memorial itself was rotated to face the city hall, in accordance with the wishes of local veterans to allow them easier access for parades, and underwent minor restoration work. <b>Its</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> memorial garden was taken by a new bronze sculpture: Breath by Paul de Monchaux. The garden re-opened to the public in March 2011. The memorial and garden was re-dedicated after three years on Armistice Day, 11 November 2011; the repair work had cost £2.6million.|$|E

5|$|The Danish {{physicist}} Niels Bohr was {{the first}} to seriously consider the possibility of an element with atomic number as high as 118, noting in 1922 that such an element would take <b>its</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> periodic table below radon as the seventh noble gas. Following this, Aristid von Grosse wrote an article in 1965 predicting the likely properties of element 118. These were remarkably early predictions, given that it was not yet known how to produce elements artificially in 1922, and that the existence of the island of stability had not yet been theorized in 1965. It was 80 years from Bohr's prediction before oganesson was successfully synthesised, although its chemical properties have not been investigated to determine if it behaves as the heavier congener of radon.|$|E
5|$|The {{contents}} of the Stromata, as its title suggests, are miscellaneous. <b>Its</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> trilogy is disputed – Clement initially intended to write the Didasculus, a work which would complement the practical guidance of the Paedagogus with a more intellectual schooling in theology. The Stromata is less systematic and ordered than Clement's other works, {{and it has been}} theorized by André Méhat that it was intended for a limited, esoteric readership. Although Eusebius wrote of eight books of the work, only seven undoubtably survive. Photius, writing in the 9th century, found various text appended to manuscripts of the seven canonical books, which lead Daniel Heinsius to suggest that the original eighth book is lost, and he identified the text purported to be from the eighth book as fragments of the Hypopotoses.|$|E
5|$|This {{was how he}} {{personally}} designed many of the Sagrada Família's sculptures. He would thoroughly study the anatomy of the figure, concentrating on gestures. For this purpose, he studied the human skeleton and sometimes used dummies made of wire to test the appropriate posture of the figure {{he was about to}} sculpt. In a second step, he photographed his models, using a mirror system that provided multiple perspectives. He then made plaster casts of the figures, both of people and animals (on one occasion he made a donkey stand up so it would not move). He modified the proportions of these casts to obtain the figure's desired appearance, depending on <b>its</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> church (the higher up, the bigger it would be). Eventually, he sculpted the figures in stone.|$|E

5|$|Thrombolysis is enzymatic {{destruction}} of blood clots. This {{is achieved by}} the administration of a drug (such as urokinase or alteplase) that activates plasmin, an enzyme that occurs naturally {{in the body and}} digests clots when activated. Thrombolysis is an accepted treatment for heart attacks and stroke unrelated to dissection. In cervical artery dissection, only small case series are available. The thrombolytic drug is administered either intravenously or during cerebral angiography through a catheter directly into the affected artery. The data indicates that thrombolysis is safe, but <b>its</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> treatment of VAD is uncertain.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} morning the Australians remained in position, and at daybreak they {{found more than}} 150 North Korean dead within the 3 RAR defensive position. Coad subsequently brought the Middlesex forward to secure his northern flank, while 3 RAR moved forward to the Talchon River, taking up positions in the hills overlooking Chongju by 11:00. During the advance the Australians had clashed {{with a number of}} North Korean stragglers, killing 12 and capturing 10 in skirmishes. It became clear that organised resistance had ceased however, with the successful Australian assault and the subsequent defence of its objectives the day before breaking the North Koreans locally. In the north the Middlesex pushed forward to the riverbank, while in the afternoon the Argylls forded the river with two platoons of Shermans. Meanwhile, aerial reconnaissance reported the presence of North Korean tanks to the west of Chongju. Regardless, that afternoon the Argylls encountered no further opposition as they entered and cleared the ruined and burning town, securing it by 17:00. The brigade then moved into divisional reserve for the US 24th Infantry Division, with Church ordering the US 21st Infantry Regiment to take <b>its</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lead in order to give the British and Australian infantry a much needed respite. The tanks and infantry of the US 21st Infantry Regiment subsequently moved through the brigade.|$|E
