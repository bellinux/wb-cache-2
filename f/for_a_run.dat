5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, Jenny returns to visit Forrest and he soon proposes to her. She declines, but slips {{into his bedroom}} and makes love to him that night before leaving early the next morning. Heartbroken, Forrest elects to go <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>run.</b> He decides to keep running across the country several times, over {{three and a half}} years, {{becoming}} famous in the process.|$|E
5|$|The scrimmages were {{something}} awful to witnessliving, kicking, scrambling masses of humanity surging to and fro, each individual after the leather oval. If a Baltimorean {{got the ball}} and started <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>run,</b> he was unfailingly caught {{by one of the}} brawny Cadets and dashed to earth with five or six men falling on him.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} Republican politicians, such as Treasury Secretary George Cortelyou, tested the waters <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>run</b> but {{chose to stay}} out. New York Governor Charles Evans Hughes ran, but when he made a major policy speech, Roosevelt the same day sent a special message to Congress warning in strong terms against {{corporate}} corruption. The resulting coverage of the presidential message relegated Hughes to the back pages. Roosevelt reluctantly deterred repeated attempts to draft him for another term.|$|E

5|$|After the election, Roosevelt {{continued}} to promote progressive ideals, a New Nationalism, much to Taft's dismay. Roosevelt attacked his successor's administration, arguing that its guiding principles were {{not that of}} the party of Lincoln, but those of the Gilded Age. The feud continued on and off through 1911, {{a year in which}} there were few elections of significance. Wisconsin Senator La Follette announced a presidential run as a Republican, and was backed by a convention of progressives. Roosevelt began to move into a position <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>run</b> in late 1911, writing that the tradition that presidents not run for a third term only applied to consecutive terms.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after this}} match, Jardine made his Test debut against the West Indies who were touring England that season. This was West Indies' first ever Test match. The team possessed several fast bowlers who had enjoyed some {{success on the}} tour of England. Many batsmen only played them with difficulty, {{particularly}} on the occasional fast-paced pitch, but Jardine played them confidently. Jardine played {{in the first two}} Tests, both of which were won by England by an innings, but missed the third for unknown reasons. He scored 22 on his debut, but was more successful in the second Test. He scored 83: when he had scored 26, he hit his wicket when setting off <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>run,</b> but was given not out. At the time, a batsman was not out if he had completed his shot and was setting off for a run; the West Indian cricketer Learie Constantine believed that Jardine was only given not out because he told the umpire his shot was complete. Later, while he was batting with Tate, a player with whom {{he did not have a}} good relationship, Jardine was run out when Tate refused to go <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>run.</b>|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{subsequent}} to the resumption, Compton took two boundaries from Lindwall's first over and another from Johnston's subsequent over. He then hit a ball into the covers and Bradman and Loxton collided {{in an attempt to}} prevent a run. Compton called Bedser through <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>run</b> on the misfield, but Loxton recovered and threw the ball to the wicket-keeper's end with Bedser a long way short of the crease. It ended an innings of 145 minutes, in which Bedser scored 37 and featured in a 121-run partnership with Compton. According to O'Reilly, it was the only mistake Compton made in his innings. The stand fell five runs short of England's highest Test partnership for the eighth wicket against Australia, a mark set by Patsy Hendren and Harold Larwood.|$|E

5|$|In January 1957 Horne {{appeared}} as the compere {{on the popular}} Saturday evening comedy and music radio show Variety Playhouse, initially <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>run</b> of four months, but soon extended {{until the end of}} June. He also began to write a weekly column for the women's magazine She, and to appear in an increasing number of other programmes. After his work on Variety Playhouse had finished, he and the programme's writers Eric Merriman and Barry Took prepared a script for a pilot episode of a new show, Beyond Our Ken. The show, in which Horne was joined by Kenneth Williams, Ron Moody, Hugh Paddick and Betty Marsden, was broadcast in October 1957.|$|E
5|$|Musicals {{continued}} to dominate at the theatre in the post-Second World War period, including transfers {{of the successful}} Broadway productions Follow the Girls (1945; 572 performances) and the Lerner and Loewe musicals Brigadoon (1949; 685 performances) and Paint Your Wagon (1953; 478 performances). Leonard Bernstein's West Side Story opened in December 1958 <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>run</b> of 1,039 performances, transferring from Broadway via the Manchester Opera House. The London premiere of Fiddler on the Roof was on 16 February 1967, starring Chaim Topol, and the production ran at Her Majesty's for 2,030 performances. Forty years after the original stage adaptation, André Previn's musical adaptation of The Good Companions premiered on 11 July 1974, followed by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Alan Ayckbourn's initially unsuccessful collaboration, Jeeves, on 22 April 1975, which has since enjoyed considerable success.|$|E
5|$|On October 10, 1893, Fields married Dora McDavid; {{the couple}} had six children. At age 21, he was elected constable of Carter County, but three years later, he fell short in his bid to capture a seat in state legislature.

5|$|On {{the second}} morning, English tailender Alec Bedser had reached 37. His partner Denis Compton hit a {{ball into the}} covers and Bradman and Loxton {{collided}} {{in an attempt to}} field the ball and prevent a run. Compton called Bedser through <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>run</b> on the misfield, but Loxton recovered and threw the ball to the wicket-keeper's end. Bedser was a long way short of the crease and was run out. The wicket ended an innings of 145 minutes, in which Bedser scored 37 in a 121-run partnership. England then lost their last three wickets for 26 runs to be all out for 363.|$|E
5|$|Twenty {{minutes into}} the game, a pass to the right wing by George Livingstone eluded Bolton's Archie Freebairn, and reached Meredith, who dribbled beyond Bob Struthers <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>run</b> on goal. He shot to goalkeeper Davies' left, scoring the opening goal. Reporters with Bolton sympathies, such as ex-Bolton {{secretary}} JJ Bentley, claimed the goal to be offside, though the Bolton players made no appeal to the referee. The goal led to one over-exuberant Manchester City supporter invading the pitch, and subsequently being escorted away by police, though {{in contrast to the}} modern image of the football hooligan, the Sporting Chronicle reported that the man was then allowed back onto the terraces, as the police had been impressed by the level of devotion that he had demonstrated.|$|E
5|$|Undeterred, Sanford began {{preparations}} {{two years}} later <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>run</b> for the 1976 Democratic presidential nomination.

While he developed a following among educators, {{he did not have}} a satisfactory campaign theme by the new year. Then, while campaigning in Massachusetts in January, he suffered sharp pains and was diagnosed with a heart murmur. On January 25, Sanford withdrew from the primaries, the first Democrat to do so that year.|$|E

5|$|Australia {{then headed}} to The Oval for the Fifth Test. Barnes {{returned}} from injury, so Hassett {{returned to his}} customary position in the middle order. England elected to bat on a rain-affected pitch. Propelled by Lindwall's 6/20, the tourists skittled Yardley’s men for 52 in 42.1 overs on the first afternoon. With the score at 1/10, Bill Edrich attempted to hook a short ball from Bill Johnston. Edrich failed {{to get the ball}} {{in the middle of the}} bat and it looped up and travelled around 10m. Hassett caught the ball just behind square leg, diving sideways to get two hands to the ball. Soon after, Lindwall bounced Compton, resulting in an edge that appeared to be heading towards the slips cordon. However, the ball cleared the ring of Australian fielders. Hutton called Compton through <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>run,</b> but his surprised partner was too busy watching the ball and dropped his bat in panic. Luckily for Compton, the ball went to Hassett at third man, who waited for Compton to regain his bat and composure before returning the ball, thereby forfeiting the opportunity to effect the run out. However, Compton only made four before being dismissed, so Australia lost little from Hassett's sportsmanship.|$|E
5|$|During {{his service}} as {{lieutenant}} governor, Beshear formed and chaired the Kentucky Tomorrow Commission, a privately financed group assembled {{to make recommendations}} for the state's future growth and development. The 30-person commission was formed in July 1984 and presented its report – containing more than 100 recommendations – in September 1986. Among the recommendations in the commission's report were several changes to the state constitution, adopted in 1891. The recommended changes included eliminating the offices of state treasurer, {{secretary of state and}} superintendent of public instruction, holding elections only in odd-numbered years instead of every year, and raising the term limit for the state's constitutional officers from one term to two consecutive terms. The state legislature showed little interest in calling a constitutional convention, however, and the commission's recommendations were not immediately adopted, though several have since been implemented. Other recommendations in the commission's report included the creation of lifelong learning programs, implementation of criminal justice reforms, and improvements in worker training. The commission was hailed by some as the most substantial undertaking by a lieutenant governor to date, but was panned by others as a move by Beshear to better position himself <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>run</b> for governor in 1987.|$|E
5|$|It {{was in the}} 1999–2000 {{season that}} the Colorado Avalanche played their first game in the new Pepsi Center that cost US$160million. Milan Hejduk scored the first goal of a 2–1 victory against the Boston Bruins on October 13, 1999. The Avalanche {{finished}} {{the season with a}} 42–28–11–1 record for 96 points and won the Northwest Division. Before the playoffs, the Avalanche strengthened their defense <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>run</b> towards the Stanley Cup. On March 6, 2000, the Boston Bruins traded future Hockey Hall of Fame defenseman Ray Bourque and forward Dave Andreychuk to Colorado for Brian Rolston, Martin Grenier, Samuel Pahlsson and a first round draft pick. Bourque, who had been a Bruin since 1979, requested a trade to a contender for a chance to win the Stanley Cup. However, and just as the year before, Colorado lost in the Conference Finals against the Dallas Stars in a seven games after beating the Phoenix Coyotes and Detroit Red Wings in five games.|$|E

5|$|Loxton {{came in and}} {{accompanied}} Morris for 39 further runs before falling to Edrich. Lindwall fell for nine before Morris was finally removed for 196, ending an innings noted for his hooking and off-driving. It took a run out to remove Morris; he attempted a quick run after the ball was hit to third man. Morris was called through <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>run</b> by Don Tallon, {{but he was too}} slow for the substitute fielder Reg Simpson's arm. Australia went on to finish with 389. Morris had scored more than half the runs {{as the rest of the}} team struggled against the leg spin of Hollies, who took 5/131. Hollies tossed the ball up repeatedly, coaxing the Australians into attacking balls that spun after pitching on off stump. Morris took four catches for the match as Australia took victory by an innings and 149 runs, sealing a 40 Test series triumph.|$|E
5|$|On a cold, snowy day, thirteen-year-old Lad feels snubbed {{when the}} three-year-old Wolf does not {{invite him to}} join him and Rex, a five-year-old collie and bull terrier mix, <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>run</b> in the woods. Later, Lad goes for a walk, {{following}} their path. When he meets them on the trail, rather than letting Lad pass, Rex viciously attacks him. With his teeth dulled by old age, Lad is unable to really fight back. Refusing to just run, he defends himself as best he can while moving backwards towards home, half a mile away. Though Wolf betrays him and joins Rex in the life-or-death fight, Lad manages to {{get close enough to}} the house for Bruce to hear the battle and alert the Master and Mistress. The Master is forced to kill Rex after the crazed dog turns on him. After four weeks recovering from his wounds, Lad is able to go outside again and Wolf steps aside for him, acknowledging he is still the leader of the Place's dogs.|$|E
5|$|On {{the second}} day, Bradman was {{involved}} in effecting a run out. Denis Compton hit a ball into the covers and Bradman and Loxton collided {{in an attempt to}} prevent a run. Compton called Bedser through <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>run</b> on the misfield, but Loxton recovered and threw the ball to the wicket-keeper's end with Bedser a long way short of the crease. It ended an innings of 145 minutes, in which Bedser scored 37 and featured in a 121-run partnership with Compton. Compton hit several boundaries and Bradman responded by spreading his field to offer Compton a single so that the tail-enders would be on strike and could be attacked. This worked, as Compton was unable to farm the strike as he desired, and wickets fell at the other end. Bradman caught Jack Young to end England's innings at 363. Having dropped Brown, Barnes was hit in the ribs by a Dick Pollard pull shot and taken to hospital, leaving Australia with only Morris as a specialist opening batsman. Ian Johnson was deployed as Australia's makeshift second opener. He fell for one to bring Bradman to bat. O'Reilly criticised the use of Johnson to partner Morris, as Hassett had transformed himself into a defensive batsman with little backlift and a guarded approach, a style typical of an opener. The Australian captain thus had to face Bedser, who had already dismissed him three times in the Tests with a new ball, and Pollard, who had troubled him in the match against Lancashire. Pollard then trapped Bradman for seven with an off cutter that struck the Australian captain on the back foot to leave Australia at 2/13. Australia were eventually out for 221, yielding a 142-run lead.|$|E
