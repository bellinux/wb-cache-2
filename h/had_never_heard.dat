5|$|Perhaps {{the biggest}} problem Biden faced {{was the fact that}} voters did not know about him and his candidacy. An April 2–5 poll {{conducted}} by Gallup found that 38% of the public <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> of Joe Biden and 17% had no opinion at all about him. In contrast, 0% of the public <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> of Hillary Clinton and only 3% had no opinion according to a June 1–3 poll by Gallup.|$|E
5|$|A September poll {{conducted}} by Clemson University found that 36% {{of the public}} <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> of Joe Biden and only 44% had a favorable opinion of him. However, this was the highest awareness rating in the Democratic field outside of the frontrunners (Clinton, Obama, and Edwards) and non-declared but highly discussed Al Gore. A September 18 poll found that 56% of respondents had not heard enough about Biden to form an opinion about him.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, it was {{sometimes}} {{claimed that the}} original letter could be found on display at Brasenose College at the University of Oxford along with other great works in the English language. Lincoln scholar F. Lauriston Bullard investigated this claim in 1925, discovering that it was untrue and the college <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> of the Bixby letter.|$|E

5|$|After {{moving to}} the US, Rihanna signed a {{contract}} with Def Jam Recordings, and released her debut album Music of the Sun (2005). The album was inspired by caribbean music, including soca, dancehall, and reggae, and incorporates dance-pop and R. In an interview for MTV, Rihanna said that when she had arrived in the US, she had been exposed to different types of music that she <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> before, including rock music, which she incorporated into her second studio album, A Girl like Me (2006).|$|E
5|$|Ayers Rock {{were formed}} in the Australian pop-music scene of the early 1970s, which {{included}} artists {{in a number of}} genres: mainstream pop (Zoot and Liv Maessen), blues rock (Chain), heavy rock (Billy Thorpe & the Aztecs), and boogie (Carson). Bands such as Blackfeather and Madder Lake combined mainstream and progressive rock. Most pop and rock listeners <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> jazz fusion; when Ayers Rock incorporated the music into their sets, it was rarely performed by fellow Australian artists.|$|E

5|$|During World War II Russell Spurr was a {{lieutenant}} in the Royal Indian Navy fighting the Japanese in Burma. After the war, in February 1946, Spurr {{was part of the}} Commonwealth occupation force stationed in the Japanese naval base of Kure in southern Japan. There he noticed a huge drydock standing empty, and after querying what it had been used for, he learnt that it was where Yamato had been built. Spurr had been isolated in Burma for several years and <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> of Yamato, but he became interested in her story and started collecting information about the battleship.|$|E
5|$|Hearings began September 27, 1918, {{shortly before}} the end of World War I. Nearly four dozen {{witnesses}} testified. Many were agents of the Bureau of Investigations (BOI), the predecessor of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The agents, controversially and usually erroneously, implicated high-profile American citizens as pro-German, using the fallacy of guilt by association. For example, the Bureau chief labeled some people pro-German because they had insubstantial and non-ideological acquaintance with German agents. Others were accused because their names were discovered in the notebooks of suspected German agents, of whom they <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard.</b>|$|E
5|$|After the Battle of Culloden in 1746, it was rumoured that Prince Charles Edward Stuart {{and some}} of his senior Jacobite aides had escaped to St Kilda. An {{expedition}} was launched, and in due course British soldiers were ferried ashore to Hirta. They found a deserted village, as the St Kildans, fearing pirates, had fled to caves to the west. When they were persuaded to come down, the soldiers discovered that the isolated natives knew nothing of the Prince and <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> of King George II either. Paradoxically, Lady Grange's letters and her resultant evacuation from the island may have prevented her being found by this expedition.|$|E

Unferth silently concedes defeat and the feast continues.|$|R

5|$|Ireland once {{dominated}} the world's market for whiskey, producing 90% of the world's whiskey {{at the start}} of the 20th century. However, as a consequence of bootleggers during the prohibition in the United States (who sold poor-quality whiskey bearing Irish-sounding names thus eroding the pre-prohibition popularity for Irish brands) and tariffs on Irish whiskey across the British Empire during the Anglo-Irish Trade War of the 1930s, sales of Irish whiskey worldwide fell to a mere 2% by the mid-20th century. In 1953, an Irish government survey, found that 50 per cent of whiskey drinkers in the United States <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> of Irish whiskey.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of the court {{vacation}} in August 1904, Hastings decided that {{it would be best to}} find a tenancy in a more prestigious set of chambers; Corbet only dealt with two or three cases a year, and solicitors were unlikely to give briefs to a barrister of whom they <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard.</b> The set of chambers below Corbet's was run by Charles Gill, a well-respected barrister. Hastings would be able to improve his career through an association with Gill, but Gill did not actually know Hastings and had no reason to offer him a place in his chambers. Hastings decided he would spend the court vacation writing a law book, and introduce himself to Gill by asking if he would mind having the book dedicated to him. Hastings wrote the book on the subject of the law relating to money-lending, something he knew very little about. He got around this by including large extracts from the judgements in cases related to money-lending, which increased the size of the book and reduced how much he would actually have to write.|$|E

5|$|Lehuby's company readied a ship at Le Havre {{and began}} to gather French emigrants, of whom about 30 {{obtained}} passports to travel to Poyais. Discarding the idea of co-operation with Spain, MacGregor published a new Poyaisian constitution in Paris in August 1825, this time describing it as a republic—he remained head of state, with the title Cazique—and on 18 August raised a new £300,000 loan through Thomas Jenkins & Company, an obscure London bank, offering 2.5% interest per annum. No evidence survives {{to suggest that the}} relevant bonds were issued. The Sketch was condensed and republished as a 40-page booklet called Some Account of the Poyais Country. French government officials became suspicious when an additional 30 people requested passports to travel to this country they <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> of, and ordered the Nouvelle Neustrie company's ship to be kept in port. Some of the would-be emigrants became concerned themselves and made complaints to the police, which led to the arrest of Hippisley and MacGregor's secretary Thomas Irving in Paris in the early hours on 4 September 1825. Lehuby's ship never left Le Havre, and his colonists gradually dispersed.|$|E
5|$|The {{settlers}} {{were discovered}} in early May 1823 by the Mexican Eagle, a schooner from British Honduras carrying the Chief Magistrate of Belize, Marshal Bennet, to the Mosquito king's court. Seven men and three children had died, and many more were sick. Bennet informed them that Poyais did not exist and that he <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> of this Cazique they spoke of. He advised them to return with him to British Honduras, as they would surely die if they stayed where they were. The majority preferred to wait for Hall to come back, hopefully with news of passage back to Britain. About half a week later Hall returned with the Mosquito king, who announced that MacGregor's land grant was revoked forthwith. He had never granted MacGregor the title of Cazique, he said, nor given him the right to sell land or raise loans against it; the emigrants were in fact in George Frederic Augustus's territory illegally {{and would have to}} leave unless they pledged allegiance to him. All the settlers left except for about 40 who were too weakened by disease to make the journey.|$|E
