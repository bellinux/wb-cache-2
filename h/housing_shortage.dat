5|$|According to Jim Gaines, {{director}} of the Jesse H. Jones Center for Economic and Demographic Forecasting at Rice Center, a Rice University-affiliated urban research center, {{the development of these}} apartment complexes was not well planned or coordinated. There was often little interest in building a quality product as developers were primarily concerned with generating quick revenue and capitalizing on the deregulation of financial institutions, tax laws favoring apartment construction, inflation, and a <b>housing</b> <b>shortage</b> in the Houston metropolitan area.|$|E
5|$|During {{the years}} between World War I and World War II, {{many of the old}} mansions were hastily {{converted}} into apartments to house the growing labor supply, a practice encouraged by the federal government at the time through low-interest loans. However, after World War II, with the <b>housing</b> <b>shortage</b> solved by large-scale suburban development affordable to the middle class, vacancy rates in Old Louisville surged. To attract renters, landlords had to lower rents dramatically, attracting less affluent tenants with less funds to maintain the homes.|$|E
5|$|A {{catastrophic flood}} in March 1913, {{known as the}} Great Dayton Flood, led to the {{creation}} of the Miami Conservancy District, a series of dams and hydraulic jumps installed around Dayton, in 1914. Like other cities across the country, Dayton was heavily involved in the war effort during World War II. Several locations around the city hosted the Dayton Project, a branch of the larger Manhattan Project, to develop polonium triggers used in early atomic bombs. The war efforts led to a manufacturing boom throughout the city, including high demand for housing and other services. At one point, emergency housing was put into place due to a <b>housing</b> <b>shortage</b> in the region, much of which is still in use today.|$|E

5|$|Cotillo was {{member of}} the Joint Legislative Committee on Housing, {{also known as the}} Lockwood Committee because it was headed by Charles C. Lockwood. The {{committee}} investigated renting and building conditions in the City of New York and ended a spate of rent-raising {{as a result of the}} <b>housing</b> <b>shortage</b> after World War I. The group found that the housing conditions at the time constituted a serious menace to public health in New York since some 400,000 persons were directly affected by the scarcity of affordable dwellings and the poor quality of the existing ones. Later he was the chairman of New York state commission to investigate child welfare, and a {{member of the}} Joint Legislative Committee to Investigate Exploitation of Immigrants (1923–24).|$|E
5|$|Though Ross was {{concerned}} about the appearance of a conflict of interest, as he had appointed many of the board members who had elected him, he announced he would accept the position. As the news of his acceptance spread throughout the state, prospective students flocked to Texas AMC. Many of the men Ross had supervised during the Civil War wanted their sons to study under their former commander, and 500 students attempted to enroll {{at the beginning of the}} 18901891 school year. Three hundred and sixteen students were admitted, though the facilities were only designed for 250 scholars. When Ross officially took charge of the school on February 2, the campus had no running water, faced a <b>housing</b> <b>shortage,</b> was taught by disgruntled faculty, and many students were running wild.|$|E
5|$|When Ross {{arrived at}} the school, he found no running water, a <b>housing</b> <b>shortage,</b> a disgruntled faculty, and many {{students}} running wild. As Ross began to make improvements, parents began {{to send their children}} to the school in the hopes that they would learn from Ross's example. Although enrollment had always been limited to men, in 1893, Ethel Hudson, the daughter of an A professor, became the first woman to attend classes at the school and helped edit the annual yearbook. She was made an honorary member of the class of 1895. Several years later her twin sisters became honorary members of the class of 1903, and slowly other daughters of Aggie professors were allowed to attend classes.|$|E

5|$|In the {{economic}} austerity of post-war Britain, Larwood's business made little money. He was persuaded, largely by his erstwhile opponent Jack Fingleton, {{that he would}} find better prospects and a warm welcome in Australia, {{and he decided to}} emigrate there with his family, which by then included five daughters. On 1 April 1950 the Larwoods sailed on SS Orontes—the ship that had carried Jardine's party 18 years previously. On arrival in Australia the welcome was warm and immediate. During their initial weeks in a Sydney hotel, unbeknown to them half their bills were paid by the former prime minister Ben Chifley. Despite a <b>housing</b> <b>shortage,</b> the family was soon settled in a bungalow in the Sydney suburb of Kingsford, and Larwood found steady employment with a soft drinks firm. Fingleton later arranged a meeting between Larwood and Chifley; their respective broad Nottinghamshire and Australian accents meant that neither could understand the other, and Fingleton had to act as an interpreter.|$|E

25|$|In {{the post-war}} era, Ballarat's growth continued. In {{response}} to an acute <b>housing</b> <b>shortage,</b> significant suburban expansion occurred. An extensive Housing Commission of Victoria estate {{was built on the}} former Ballarat Common (today known as Wendouree West). The estate was originally planned to contain over 750 prefabricated houses. While planning for the estate began in 1949, main construction occurred between 1951 and 1962.|$|E
25|$|The region had unique housing {{profile in}} 1990. While other areas complained of <b>housing</b> <b>shortage,</b> a {{significant}} number of houses, particularly in Agusan del Norte and Surigao del Norte were vacant. However, available statistics do not give the magnitude of substandard of units to be replaced and current housing backlog. Currently, the cities of Butuan and Surigao and other municipalities are not spared from housing problems, i.e. squatters bought by urbanization.|$|E

Students seeking exemption from the living on campus requirement have to fill out and return paperwork.|$|E
25|$|A <b>housing</b> <b>shortage</b> was {{partially}} eased by {{the construction of}} 100 units of the Plew Heights Defense Housing Project near Valparaiso for civil service employees and enlisted personnel. The Federal Works Agency, Division of Defense Housing, awarded the contract for the task to the Paul A. Miller Construction Company of Leesburg, Florida on 5 May 1941, with construction beginning on 8 May. The 11 November 1941 deadline for completion was beaten by almost a month.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{documents}} and examines Housing in the Third world cities generally {{and the effect}} of poverty and urbanization. It explains the integration of the green and brown agenda as a means of sustainable urban development in developing cities. The study provides evidence of <b>housing</b> <b>shortages</b> as a result of poverty and rate of urbanization. However, although urbanization is a common phenomenon that is taking place all over the world, urbanization rate is highest in Africa, and as a result, governments of sub- Saharan African countries are challenged in providing housing and related infrastructure for the growing urban population. It concludes with the importance of slum improvement and highlights the issue of <b>housing</b> <b>shortages</b> as one of the major challenges facing a developing economy...|$|R
50|$|Another wave of Dutch {{immigration}} to South Africa {{occurred in the}} wake of World War II, when many Dutch citizens were moving abroad to escape <b>housing</b> <b>shortages</b> and depressed economic opportunities at home.

25|$|The colonial {{government}} embarked on several measures {{to address the}} serious social problems facing Singapore. For example, a Chinese Protectorate under Pickering was established in 1877 {{to address the needs}} of the Chinese community, including controlling the worst abuses of the coolie trade and protecting Chinese women from forced prostitution. In 1889 Governor Sir Cecil Clementi Smith banned secret societies, driving them underground. Nevertheless, many social problems persisted up through the post-war era, including an acute <b>housing</b> <b>shortage</b> and generally poor health and living standards.|$|E
25|$|The Bronx is home {{to several}} Off-Off-Broadway theaters, many staging new works by {{immigrant}} playwrights from Latin America and Africa. The Pregones Theater, which produces Latin American work, opened a new 130-seat theater in 2005 on Walton Avenue in the South Bronx. Some artists from elsewhere in New York City have begun to converge on the area, and housing prices have nearly quadrupled in the area since 2002. However rising prices directly correlate to a <b>housing</b> <b>shortage</b> across {{the city and the}} entire metro area.|$|E
