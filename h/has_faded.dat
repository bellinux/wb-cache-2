5|$|During {{the early}} Renaissance, {{painters}} such as Duccio di Buoninsegna learned to paint faces {{first with a}} green undercoat, then with pink, which gave the faces a more realistic hue. Over the centuries the pink <b>has</b> <b>faded,</b> making some of the faces look green.|$|E
5|$|Some {{chemical}} tests {{can be used}} to help identify the mushroom. A drop of dilute potassium hydroxide placed on the cap cuticle will stain dark red to blackish, and orange-yellow on the flesh, while ferrous sulphate solution turns the cuticle yellow and then greenish-yellow. Melzer's reagent will turn the flesh dark blue, after the natural bluing reaction to injury <b>has</b> <b>faded.</b>|$|E
5|$|Many motifs {{are used}} in {{traditional}} kilims, handmade flat-woven rugs, each with many variations. In Turkish Anatolia in particular, village women wove themes significant for their lives into their rugs, whether before marriage or during married life. Some motifs represent desires, such as for happiness and children; others, for protection against threats such as wolves (to the flocks) and scorpions, or against the evil eye. These motifs were often combined when woven into patterns on kilims. With the fading of tribal and village cultures in the 20th century, the meaning of kilim patterns <b>has</b> <b>faded</b> also.|$|E

5|$|The Philippines values its {{relations}} with the United States. It supported the United States during the Cold War and the War on Terror and is a major non-NATO ally. Despite this history of goodwill, controversies related to the presence of the now former U.S. military bases in Subic Bay and Clark and the current Visiting Forces Agreement have flared up from time to time. Japan, the biggest contributor of official development assistance to the country, is thought of as a friend. Although historical tensions still exist on issues such as the plight of comfort women, much of the animosity inspired by memories of World War II <b>has</b> <b>faded.</b>|$|E

25|$|Bookmarks {{have been}} {{incorporated}} in browsers since the Mosaic browser in 1993. Bookmark lists were called Hotlists in Mosaic and in previous versions of Opera; this term <b>has</b> <b>faded</b> from common use. Other early web browsers such as ViolaWWW and Cello also had bookmarking features.|$|E
25|$|Young male zebras {{eventually}} {{leave their}} family groups. This {{is not because}} of sexual maturity or being kicked out by their fathers, but because their relationship with their mothers <b>has</b> <b>faded</b> {{after the birth of}} a sibling. The young stallion then seeks out other young stallions for company. Young females may stay in the harem until they are abducted by another stallion.|$|E

25|$|Coltman was the {{architect}} and Steen Sehested prepared the reinforced concrete design. Initially the façade was coloured grey, {{green and white}} however it <b>has</b> <b>faded.</b> It {{was a product of}} golden age cinema with featured safety designs such as emergency lighting and fire prevention systems for the projector room. Ventilation grills and exhaust fans enhanced its air circulation. The foyers were laid with locally produced rubber flooring.|$|E
25|$|Every May, Rome {{hosts the}} ATP Masters Series tennis tournament on the clay courts of the Foro Italico. Cycling was {{popular in the}} post-World War II period, {{although}} its popularity <b>has</b> <b>faded.</b> Rome has hosted the final portion of the Giro d'Italia three times, in 1911, 1950, and 2009. Rome {{is also home to}} other sports teams, including volleyball (M. Roma Volley), handball or waterpolo.|$|E

25|$|Growing {{from a small}} {{agitation}} {{group of}} about fifty members, the SWM now began to build groups in major colleges such as Trinity College and University College, Dublin. Its traditional workplace bastion, Waterford Glass, <b>has</b> <b>faded</b> in strength but the SWP has developed some limited support in the Dublin Bus unions and the education branch of SIPTU. The party campaigned vigorously in referendums for abortion choice and for divorce.|$|E
25|$|During Andrés López Obrador's {{administration}} {{a political}} slogan was introduced: la Ciudad de la Esperanza ("The City of Hope"). This motto was quickly adopted {{as a city}} nickname, but <b>has</b> <b>faded</b> since the new motto Capital en Movimiento ("Capital in Movement") {{was adopted by the}} administration headed by Marcelo Ebrard, though the latter is not treated as often as a nickname in media. Since 2013, to refer to the City particularly in relation to government campaigns, the abbreviation CDMX has been used (from Ciudad de México).|$|E
25|$|In recent years, {{the great}} rivalry between the Blue Bulls and Western Province <b>has</b> <b>faded.</b> It has been many {{years since the}} decades that these two teams {{dominated}} the Currie Cup competition and new rivalries {{have come to the}} foreground. Many Blue Bull fans actually agree that the rivalry has shifted towards Free State, especially after both teams qualified for the Currie Cup final for the third consecutive year in 2006. Statistics have shown that Loftus Versfeld currently experiences more incidents of bad behaviour during Bulls home games against Free State and the Sharks, than during any other games in the season, including those against Western Province.|$|E

25|$|Language (and {{especially}} spoken language) is {{not necessarily}} linked with national identification. Family ties and informal local contact across the border used to be very common, with South Jutlandic being the first language of both Danish minded and German minded people. Sometimes the purest South Jutlandic may be found among older people who identify as German. Since they have not attended Danish schools, their speech is not influenced by Standard Danish. With urbanisation in the recent decades this crisscross of dialects and national sentiment <b>has</b> <b>faded,</b> High German becoming the first choice everywhere, but often some South Jutlandic words are retained in the vocabulary.|$|E
25|$|While Voldemort {{did learn}} of Harry's telepathic connection, Voldemort was never aware that Harry was {{inadvertently}} carrying {{a fragment of}} his soul. With this destroyed, the connections between the two were also broken, and Harry never again felt pain in his scar. Rowling revealed Harry has also {{lost the ability to}} speak Parseltongue, though he regained the ability to understand it in Harry Potter and the Cursed Child after his scar began to hurt again following the rise of Voldemort and Bellatrix's daughter Delphi whom Harry, his son Albus Severus, and his allies defeated and sent to Azkaban. In the epilogue of the film, the scar <b>has</b> <b>faded</b> to an ordinary looking scar on Harry's forehead.|$|E
25|$|Stó:lō {{society was}} {{organized}} into classes: the sí:yá:m (or upper classes), the ordinary people, and the slaves, who were usually captives taken from enemy tribes in raids or warfare. A person's family status {{was important in}} determining their role within Stó:lō society, and within Longhouse ceremonies, though this <b>has</b> <b>faded</b> over time. Slaves may have been treated relatively well, {{but they were not}} permitted to eat with others at the Longhouse fire. They were primarily responsible for daily tasks such as gathering nuts, fruits and other foods, or firewood. The use of slaves died out in the nineteenth century. In some bands, the memory of which families descend from slaves may persist.|$|E
