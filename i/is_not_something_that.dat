25|$|Social constructivist {{scholars}} view {{learning as}} an active process where learners should learn to discover principles, concepts and facts for themselves, hence the importance of encouraging guesswork and intuitive thinking in learners (Brown et al.1989; Ackerman 1996). In fact, for the social constructivist, reality <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> we can discover {{because it does not}} pre-exist prior to our social invention of it.

25|$|Some {{treatment}} {{has been given}} to dogs with CCD to observe their reactions and how they are similar or different from how humans would react to the same pharmaceutical or behavioral treatment. A combination of the two approaches {{has been found to be}} most effective in lowering the intensity and regularity of OCD in both canines and humans. Pharmaceutically, clomipramine was found to be more effective than an alternative chemical, amitriptyline, in treatments for dogs. One study by Karen Overall discovered that by combining behavioral therapy with the more effective clomipramine, the symptoms of Canine Compulsive Disorder decreased by over 50% for all of the dogs involved in the study. Overall acknowledges that OCD <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> can be completely cured, but studies like this are still important because Obsessive Compulsive Disorder can be controlled effectively enough so it does not interfere with one's life, a valuable and commonly sought after thing for those who suffer from the disorder.|$|E
25|$|The Land of Oz as {{portrayed in}} the classic MGM musical movie of 1939, is quite {{different}} from that portrayed in Baum's books. The most notable difference is that in the film the entire land of Oz appears to be dreamed up by Dorothy Gale (thus making it a dream world), although, Dorothy earnestly corrects the adults at the end that she was indeed there, and an image of Dorothy's falling farmhouse returning to earth is presented. The apparent message is that one should appreciate one's home, no matter how dull it may look or uninteresting its surroundings may be, for having a home and a family <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> should be taken for granted. This contrasts sharply with the books, in which Dorothy and her family are eventually invited to move to Oz due to a bank foreclosure on the farm, showing both that Oz is a real place, and that it is a utopia compared to the prairies of Kansas.|$|E

500|$|The {{suggestion}} that asexuality is a sexual dysfunction is controversial among the asexual community. Those who identify as asexual usually prefer {{it to be}} recognized as a sexual orientation. Various scholars state that asexuality is a sexual orientation, as some asexuals are unable to masturbate even though they reportedly have a normal sex drive, and that there are variations of sexual preferences, arguing that asexuality ought to be included as well. They and many asexual people believe that the lack of sexual attraction is valid enough to be categorized as a sexual orientation. The researchers argue that asexuals do not choose to have no sexual desire, and generally start to find out their differences in sexual behaviors around adolescence. Because of these facts coming to light, it is reasoned that asexuality is more than a behavioral choice and <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> can be cured like a disorder.Cited from: [...] There is also analysis on whether asexuality is becoming more popular, with more people identifying as asexual.|$|E

500|$|The {{original}} {{doctrine of}} privity {{consisted of two}} rules - first, that a third party may not have obligations imposed {{by the terms of}} a contract, and second, that a third party may not benefit from the terms of a contract.

The second rule was not originally held to be valid, and in the 17th Century third parties were allowed to enforce terms of a contract that benefited them, as shown in Provender v Wood [...] Hetley 30, where the judgement stated that [...] "the party to whom the benefit of a promise accrews, may bring his action." [...] The first reversal of this was in Bourne v Mason [...] 1 Vent., where the Court of King's Bench found that a third party had no rights to enforce a contract that benefited him. This case was quickly reversed, and decisions immediately after Bourne v Mason took the view that third parties could enforce contracts that benefited them.|$|E

[...] Though she was quite proud of her own versatility as an actress, saying [...] "I played every kind of role. I was never petite or cute so there was never anything about me which would go out of style", critics found fault with her range. Malone wrote that she [...] "seemed to struggle in comedic roles but proved her mettle in films that called on her to take charge of situations or find courage in the face of adversity". One critic remarked that it took a director like John Ford to bring out a good performance from her. [...] The Irish critic Philip Moloy thought the opposite, saying [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> she would accept herself, but Maureen O'Hara's career probably suffered from its long-term association with John Ford. John Ford's view of Ireland, and things Irish, tended to be broad, sentimental and sociologically distorted, and his characters were often cliched representatives of their nationality". In the 1960s, O'Hara ventured into maturer roles as she aged.|$|E
500|$|During his campaign, Biden {{focused on}} the war in Iraq and his support for the {{implementation}} of the Biden-Gelb plan to achieve political success. He touted his record in the Senate as the head of major congressional committees and his experience on foreign policy. Despite speculation to the contrary, Biden rejected the notion of accepting the position of Secretary of State, focusing only on the presidency. At a 2007 campaign event, Biden said, [...] "I know a lot of my opponents out there say I'd be a great Secretary of State. Seriously, every one of them. Do you watch any of the debates? 'Joe's right, Joe's right, Joe's right.'" [...] Other candidates' comments that [...] "Joe is right" [...] in the Democratic debates were converted into a Biden campaign theme and ad.

The presidency <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> lends itself to on-the-job training." [...] Biden also said that Obama was copying some of his foreign policy ideas.

Pro-Family Perspectives director Angela Conway said: [...] " [...] <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> should be considered the norm, programmes like Neighbours can make the behaviours that lead to teenage pregnancy seem normal and acceptable.

[...] Mignon said that the storyline between Declan and Bridget was not shallow, trite or vulgar, further adding she would not have liked to film the storyline if it was and branded it as showing emotional spectrum of pregnancy justice. Critics also slammed the show, noting that Neighbours has a G-rating and the storyline could lead to more promiscuity and teenage pregnancies among young viewers. The storyline continued despite the controversy it caused and Declan and Bridget became parents to a daughter, India.|$|E

500|$|When the {{character}} was announced, he {{was described as}} a hustler who sees everything as an opportunity, and has created several personas since the age of seven to hide his real self. Norwood expanded on this, saying [...] "when he was in school and the register was being read out and it got to his name it would be 'Chubb!' and all the kids in school would start taking the mickey out of it. What he did was create something even more ridiculous to take away from that. He [...] out of himself and took the power away from those that were taking the mickey out of him. [...] For the same reason most kids put on a front, it's to protect himself from the world. He doesn't like his real name so he tried to create something that would get away from that and Fatboy was that creation. The street and the slang stuff <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> is far away from him, it is still from the area that he lives in. Fatboy was someone he adopted to put a brave face on, to put a mask on himself, to protect Arthur from the world." [...] Before adopting the [...] "Fatboy" [...] persona, he would adopt personas of men he saw on television, and Norwood said Fatboy was [...] "an awkward kind of child". Fatboy comes from a wealthy background, and gets what he wants from his parents, with whom he has a good relationship, but hustles to hide the fact. He often wears clothing brand Ed Hardy, and his speech has, according to Norwood, a [...] "unique rhythm". Norwood is able to make viable changes to the script to make it sound more authentic.|$|E
500|$|On the {{birthday}} of Albizu, the Macheteros issued a message discussing the approach of other pro-independence organizations that had moved away from armed resistance. The EPB considered those that had done so as having abandoned the ideals of Albizu and Betances, instead adopting a [...] "defeated and conformist approach" [...] {{in the face of}} the challenge involved in securing independence for Puerto Rico. Accepting that [...] "violence <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> should be accepted by anyone sane", the organization insisted that they were not the source of violence and were instead responding to it. The EPB argued that most of the public had been [...] "conditioned to accept the [...] "pacific route" [...] towards liberty and independence", citing it as an inefficient and dilatory method that would lead to the [...] "suicide and self-destruction" [...] of Puerto Rican identity. The organization expressed that all of the political structure and the format of the general elections was created by the United States, citing skepticism that independence could win under such circumstances. Citing that inaction resulted in an exacerbation of social, eviromental and economic problems emerging from the status quo, the EPB justified its use of violence as a means [...] "for self preservation". On September 23, 2000, the EPB celebrated Lares as the moment that illustrated the birth of Puerto Rico as a nation. The organization also held an introspection where it questioned why the independence movement was segregated into several factions and speculated that it was the system's fault, since [...] "it promotes individualism over collectivity", arguing that this is the reason why the federal government continues to vigorously promote it. The EPB then listed Vieques as an example of a weakening of this tendency and an example of the independence movement converging around a cause without pursuing protagonism. The organization interpreted approaches made by the Navy involving the devolution and decontamination of terrains as a distraction to divide the protestors and sign that there [...] "was fear in Washington", accusing Rosselló and legislators such as Mundo and Parga of facilitating this strategy. The Macheteros also praised the manner in which the religious movements and the PIP handled the situation, despite acknowledging philosophical differences with the latter.|$|E
