5|$|A book {{published}} by Nationalmuseum in 1992 on Carl Larsson {{claims that the}} most immediate and natural explanation <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>ultimate</b> rejection of the painting {{was the fact that}} time had rendered the painting unfashionable. Because of the long debate, the painting became a survivor from a time past and it could not meet the modernist ideals of the new century.|$|E

In 2011, Hughes appeared as guest coach during The Ultimate Fighter 13 season for friend and former UFC Heavyweight Champion Brock Lesnar.|$|E
5|$|Mike Rio is {{a junior}} college {{national}} wrestling champion at 149lbs for Harper College in Illinois and then transferred to Lindenwood University to become back-to-back chamapion at the NAIA national wrestling championships, being named Most Outstanding Wrestler of the 2006 national championship tournament. Also, during his time at Lindenwood University {{he was also the}} college roommate of now fellow UFC fighter and The Ultimate Fighter 12 winner Jonathan Brookins. Rio is currently a professional mixed martial arts fighter; formerly competing <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ultimate</b> Fighting Championship. John Salter is also another MMA fighter who won the 2007 NAIA National Wrestling Championship at 174 lbs.|$|E
5|$|The {{first six}} seasons {{featured}} sixteen fighters, in either {{one or two}} weight categories. The first two seasons, however, were very different from each following season. The original format <b>for</b> <b>The</b> <b>Ultimate</b> Fighter saw each team compete in challenges, such as hoisting their respective coach up on their shoulders and sprinting down a beach, or a team tug-of-war. These challenges resulted in eliminations of fighters who hadn't fought, {{until late in the}} season when the challenge incentive was to select the next fight where fighters would be eliminated, having lost the fight. In the first two seasons, fighters would also leave the house for good upon losing and this often resulted in odd numbers for teams, which forced the moving of fighters to opposing teams.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} UK release received various cuts to {{scenes of}} violence and martial arts weaponry, and to reduce the impact of sound effects, to receive a more box-office-friendly 12 certificate. Further cuts {{were made to the}} video/DVD release to retain this rating. These edits were restored <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ultimate</b> Edition DVD release in the UK, which was consequently upgraded to a 15 certificate. However, upon the release of the Blu-ray in 2012, it was rated back down to a 12 uncut.|$|E
5|$|The primary feud {{leading up}} to Royal Rumble 1993 was between WWF World Heavyweight Champion Bret Hart and {{challenger}} Razor Ramon (a replacement <b>for</b> <b>The</b> <b>Ultimate</b> Warrior, who had left the previous November). Ramon formed an alliance in late 1992 with Ric Flair, who Hart defeated to win the title belt. During an interview in which Hart {{was talking about the}} upcoming match, Ramon and Flair came to the ring and attacked Hart. Ramon later escalated the feud by attacking Owen Hart, Bret's brother.|$|E
5|$|To {{maintain}} control and improve administration, various schemes {{to divide the}} work of the Roman Emperor by sharing it between individuals were tried between 285 and 324, from 337 to 350, from 364 to 392, and again between 395 and 480. Although the administrative subdivisions varied, they generally involved a division of labour between East and West. Each division was a form of power-sharing (or even job-sharing), <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>ultimate</b> imperium was not divisible and therefore the empire remained legally one state—although the co-emperors often saw each other as rivals or enemies.|$|E

5|$|Additionally, Faran Tahir {{appears as}} Raza, {{the leader of}} the Ten Rings; Paul Bettany voices J.A.R.V.I.S., Stark's {{personal}} AI system; Leslie Bibb portrays Christine Everhart, a reporter for Vanity Fair; and Clark Gregg appears as Phil Coulson, an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.. Will Lyman provides the voiceover during the opening award ceremony. Director Jon Favreau plays Happy Hogan, Stark's bodyguard and chauffeur, and Samuel L. Jackson makes a cameo appearance as Nick Fury, director of S.H.I.E.L.D., in a post-credits scene. Jackson's face was previously used as the model <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ultimate</b> Marvel imprint version of Nick Fury. Other cameos in the film include Stan Lee as himself, being mistaken for Hugh Hefner by Stark at a party; Tom Morello, who provided guitar music for the film, as a terrorist guard; and Jim Cramer as himself. Ghostface Killah had a cameo in a scene where Stark briefly stays in Dubai, but the scene was cut from the theatrical release for pacing reasons.|$|E
5|$|After the Union rout at Bull Run, {{the first}} major battle of the Civil War, and the {{retirement}} of the aged Winfield Scott in late 1861, Lincoln appointed Major General George B. McClellan general-in-chief of all the Union armies. McClellan, a young West Point graduate, railroad executive, and Pennsylvania Democrat, took several months to plan and attempt his Peninsula Campaign, longer than Lincoln wanted. The campaign's objective was to capture Richmond by moving the Army of the Potomac by boat to the peninsula and then overland to the Confederate capital. McClellan's repeated delays frustrated Lincoln and Congress, as did his position that no troops were needed to defend Washington. Lincoln insisted on holding some of McClellan's troops {{in defense of the}} capital; McClellan, who consistently overestimated the strength of Confederate troops, blamed this decision <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>ultimate</b> failure of the Peninsula Campaign.|$|E
5|$|Biko and SASO were openly {{critical}} of NUSAS' protests against government policies. Biko argued that NUSAS merely sought {{to influence the}} white electorate; in his opinion, this electorate was not legitimate, and protests targeting a particular policy would be ineffective <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>ultimate</b> aim of dismantling the apartheid state. SASO regarded student marches, pickets, and strikes to be ineffective and stated it would withdraw from public forms of protest. It deliberately avoided open confrontation with the state until such a point when it had a sufficiently large institutional structure. Instead, SASO's focus was on establishing community projects and spreading Black Consciousness ideas among other black organisations and the wider black community. Despite this policy, in May 1972 it issued the Alice Declaration, in which it called for students to boycott lectures {{in response to the}} expulsion of SASO member Abram Onkgopotse Tiro from the University of the North after he made a speech criticising its administration. The Tiro incident convinced the government that SASO was a threat.|$|E

5|$|The Sonic X-treme debacle {{has been}} cited as a reason <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>ultimate</b> failure of the Sega Saturn. With the Sonic the Hedgehog series being {{attributed}} {{to much of the}} success of the company's prior system, the Genesis, and Sony and Nintendo both having flagship 3D platformers available early in the life cycle of their consoles (Crash Bandicoot and Super Mario 64, respectively), Sega was expected by fans to follow suit and produce an official 3D Sonic game. With the game's cancellation, the Saturn never did receive an exclusive Sonic platform game, but rather only the Genesis port of Sonic 3D Blast; Sonic Jam, a compilation of the 2D Genesis Sonic titles; and Sonic R, a racing game. Sonic's debut in a full 3D platform game was not until 1998, with Sonic Adventure as a Dreamcast launch title, well after the discontinuation of the Saturn.|$|E
5|$|While Manhattan {{is being}} evacuated, a Japanese man named Kunihiko Maeda manages {{to sneak into}} the city, {{witnessing}} a police officer combust into flames in the process. Aya awakens in an apartment in SoHo, with Daniel and Maeda at her side. Maeda reveals the origins of Eve: A scientist tried to culture the cells of his wife after {{she was involved in}} a car accident, and the mitochondria in her cells took over her body. Maeda believes that Eve may be trying to give birth to an “Ultimate Being”. The next day, the three go to see Dr. Klamp again. After examining cell samples from that of Eve and Aya's, Maeda concludes that based on selfish gene theory, Aya and Eve's mitochondria are in an evolutionary race for survival. Dr. Klamp suddenly appears and asks a few questions of Aya in a hostile manner. The three leave and head for the St. Francis Hospital, where Maeda thinks Eve may try to get sperm <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ultimate</b> Being. When they arrive, they find that Eve is already there. Eve takes the sperm and escapes.|$|E
