50|$|The {{submarine}} {{was missing}} its external torpedo tube covers. They used one original, that was stored somewhere else and the drawings (obtained from England), to construct 3 replicas. Most {{of the external}} paint was also removed, for minor <b>derusting</b> {{and the removal of}} some small dents. It was anticipated that the total restoration, would cost over 360000 Euros.|$|E
40|$|Gluconic acid is a mild {{organic acid}} that has gained much {{interest}} {{as it has}} many industrial applications {{such as in the}} pharmaceutical, food, animal feed and textile industry. It is also applied as additive in cement to control the setting time and increase strength and water resistance, component of photographic developer, and used for alkaline <b>derusting</b> in metallurgy. There are several methods to produce gluconic acid including chemical, electrochemical, biochemical and bioelectrochemical. In this research, batch fermentation of glucose into gluconic acid was done with intial substrate concentration of 150, 200 and 250 g/l. The experimental data resulted was then used to obtain kinetic parameters. The kinetic models used were Contois and Logistic equation for cell growth, Luedeking-Piret equation for gluconic acid formation, and Luedeking-Piret-like equation for glucose consumption. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{following}} problem definitions {{were studied}} {{within the framework}} of the present research project: how does the reinforcement at the transition to the unrepaired concrete behave taking into consideration the decisive influence parameters? The studies are to be concentrated on such cases where not all the concrete containing chloride surrounding the reinforcement can be removed. Linked with this is the question of how much residual chloride may remain in the old concrete. What is the effect of different degrees of <b>derusting</b> of the steel (remaining corrosion scars, residual chloride) at the repair location on the corrosion behaviour of the reinforcement after the repair? How deep must the concrete excavation at the repair be in order to prevent reverse diffusion of chloride to the reinforcement in critial quantities? Separate study programmes were implemented for the above three problem definitions. (orig.)

5000|$|The church became {{renowned for}} the {{extraordinary}} lacery in stone which adorns the facades, from bottom {{to the top}} of the derricks. One can count over 30 non-repeating registers of decorative motives. Western architectural elements (Gothic, Renaissance) combine with the Eastern style, of Armenian (Khachkar), Georgian, Persian, Arabian or Ottoman inspiration, in a totally bold conception, whose result is a harmonious ensemble. The effusive scenery makes the church resemble a shrine of architectonic proportions, especially conceived to protect the Sfanta Cuvioasa Parascheva's relics (1641). After the 1882 restoration, the original fresco was <b>derusted,</b> some fragments still being kept today in the monastery's museum.|$|R
50|$|DG 783/DG 2376 {{was saved}} by Roger Redward for his {{proposed}} Southern Rail museum in Prebbleton. In 1988, the NZR decided to re-possess all of Rogers collection held on NZR property {{as he had}} failed to make several rent payments. The loco was sold in 1988 to the Weka Pass Railway, who were at the time seeking spare parts to maintain their two locomotives, and had the loco trucked to their Waipara yard where it was gradually stripped of most of its useful parts. In 2005, Weka Pass decided to sell the remains of the loco with the condition that it was removed from Waipara after purchase. The locomotive was subsequently purchased by two railfans, Darryl Bond and Evan Batchelor, who had the derelict locomotive moved to the Ferrymead Heritage Park, where it was planned to restore the locomotive. The locomotives front bogie (fitted with the cracked bogie ex-DG 770) has since been repaired, the body largely <b>derusted,</b> and parts have been acquired to begin to restore the locomotive to service in the later International Orange livery, which the loco never carried in service. It is planned to be fitted with the new cab from DG 2140. In late 2013, the locomotive was moved to Oamaru.|$|R
40|$|AbstractIndia is {{spending}} about 1. 25 lakh crore rupees to protect iron structure from rust every year. The USA {{is spending}} about 12 lakh crore rupees {{every year for}} the same purpose. Generally, iron suface is protected by applying a special paint coating at regular intervals. This method of protection involves more chemicals {{and most of them are}} toxic in nature which cause several environmental hazards. Therefore, a preliminary study was under taken to find out the possibility of involving biotechnological method(s) to remove iron rust and protect the metal from further rust formation. A fungal-based technique was developed through which aerosol particulate matter was generated. A set of rusty iron mesh (1 mm) was exposed to the aerosol particulate matter for a period of time. The rusty iron mesh which not exposed to the aerosol particulate was kept as control. The result revealed that the rust on rusty metals was removed (<b>derusted)</b> and the metal surface became brilliant white due to the deposition of aerosol particles, which inturn protected the metal from rust formation for about fifteen years in natural condition, However, the control metal lost its original shape and structure gradually by deterioration. As this new biological method offers a long-term solution for rust problem it can be tried in a big way...|$|R
