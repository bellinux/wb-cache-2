50|$|Thrips simplex is {{a species}} of insect in the genus Thrips in the order Thysanoptera. It is {{commonly}} known as the <b>gladiolus</b> <b>thrips</b> and infests gladiolus plants as well as various other monocotyledonous plants such as lilies, irises and freesias.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Gladiolus</b> <b>Thrip</b> (Mackenzie Crook): A preening, narcissistic and {{ruthless}} hit-man, Thrip is a Type 12 entity, {{the most powerful}} type of demon there is. He has a cockney accent and speaks in a very pompous, verbose manner. He possesses superhuman speed and strength and is immune to most forms of attack. Nevertheless, he possesses an arrogant belief in his invincibility which leads to his apparent destruction {{at the hands of}} Luke in the first episode. Thrip had no nose and wore an ivory beak in its place which survived the apparent destruction of his body. He later returns in the final episode, working to drive Luke and Galvin apart; however he is ultimately slain by Mina, who awakens her vampiric nature by drinking a vial of her own blood. Thanks to her vampiric sense, Mina realises that Thrip is a vampire (explaining why he did not die previously and why he was so difficult to kill). She later tears out his throat, as {{the only one who can}} kill a vampire is another vampire, causing his body to liquefy. Thrip's superhuman speed was a hint to his true nature, as vampires bear the same kind of superhuman speed as seen in 'Suckers'.|$|R
50|$|Crook {{starred in}} Wyndham Price's drama Abraham's Point as Comet Snape and {{appeared}} in City of Ember as Looper, and on TV {{was featured in}} the documentary Tattoos: A Scarred History (2009). He also appeared in Big Brother Celebrity Hijack and the ITV drama Demons (originally titled The Last Van Helsing) as the vampire Dr. <b>Gladiolus</b> Hadilus Tradius <b>Thrip.</b> In January 2009, Crook featured {{in the second and}} third episodes of the third series of the E4 hit teen cult drama Skins, which he played psychotic Bristol gangster Johnny White. He appeared in Merlin, for the first episode of the second season, as Cedric, who tried to take Merlin's job as Prince Arthur's manservant.In November 2010 Mackenzie starred in A Reluctant Tragic Hero, a comic play by Anton Chekhov, on the Sky Arts channel, which also starred Johnny Vegas.Mackenzie played Corporal Buckley, a brutal career soldier, in Jimmy McGovern's Accused, broadcast on BBC1 in November 2010.During the 2012 San Diego Comic-Con it was announced that Crook would play the role of Orell in the third season of Game of Thrones.|$|R
50|$|The <b>{{gladiolus}}</b> <b>thrips</b> {{feeds on}} gladiolus, lily, freesia, crocus and iris, but damage is mostly {{limited to the}} gladiolus. The thrips can remain inside the corms of gladiolus over winter, causing them to ooze sap from the wounds, turn brown and sticky. These corms are {{the main source of}} infestation in growing plants the following year; the emerging leaves are tunnelled and appear silvery at first, turning brown later. Heavy infestation can cause poor plant growth and the plant may fail to flower. When the thrips tunnel into the flowers, these can be scarred and distorted. Other damage may be brown buds, discoloured or streaked blooms, and bleached or distorted flower spikes.|$|E
40|$|Previous to the {{discovery}} of the <b>gladiolus</b> <b>thrips</b> in North America in 1929, the gladiolus plant was considered practically free from serious insect injury. With the introduction and rapid distribution of the thrips, however, the study of insects attacking the gladiolus has demanded the attention of entomologists as well as commercial growers in many states. At the present time a complete list of insects which feed on this plant would comprise a considerable number of species. Even though some of these are of only secondary importance, they may under some conditions become pests of serious consequence to the individual grower. The purpose of this bulletin is to familiarize the grower with the habits, type of injury and the control of the more common gladiolus insect pests...|$|E
40|$|The <b>gladiolus</b> <b>thrips</b> (Thrips simplex) is {{a common}} pest of gladioli. The insect causes damage to leaves, flower stalks and buds by sucking. The present study was {{intended}} to investigate the susceptibility of four Gladiolus cultivars {{as well as the}} colour preference of the thrips tested on different coloured flowers of the cultivars. The experiment was carried out in 2006 at two locations in central Slovenia. After planting the corms on April, 27 and May, 2 on three occasions with successive plant stages the percentage of infested foliage surface and flowers was assessed. Of the cultivars tested, the ‘Nova Lux’ was the only cultivar suited for cultivation without insecticide application. The flowers of gladioli with a light colour (white ‘White Prosperity’, yellow ‘Nova Lux’) were less infested in comparison with cultivars with dark coloured flowers (orange ‘Hunting Song’, red ‘Oscar’) ...|$|E
