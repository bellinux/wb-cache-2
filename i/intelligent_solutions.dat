40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the problem of}} scheduling a given number of jobs on a specified number of identical parallel robots with unequal release dates and precedence constraints {{in order to minimize}} mean tardiness. This problem is strongly NP-hard. The author proposes a hybrid <b>intelligent</b> <b>solution</b> system, which uses Genetic Algorithms and Simulated Annealing (GA+SA). A genetic algorithm, as is well known, is an efficient tool for the solution of combinatorial optimization problems. Solutions for problems of different scales are found using genetic algorithms, simulated annealing and a Hybrid <b>Intelligent</b> <b>Solution</b> System (HISS). Computational results of empirical experiments show that the Hybrid <b>Intelligent</b> <b>Solution</b> System (HISS) is successful with regards to solution quality and computational time...|$|R
