5|$|The {{flowers of}} all banksias arise in a spiral pattern around the <b>flower</b> <b>spike</b> axis; however in Banksia coccinea they develop into {{distinctive}} vertical columns, which are strongly accentuated by large gaps in between. Paired in columns, the red styles {{contrast with the}} grey-white perianth making a striking <b>flower</b> <b>spike.</b>|$|E
5|$|Banksia integrifolia subsp. monticola: Commonly {{known as}} white {{mountain}} banksia, {{it is the}} only subspecies with a montane distribution; it occurs in the Blue Mountains of northern New South Wales. It is similar in form to B.integrifolia subsp. integrifolia, but differs in having longer, narrower leaves, and follicles that are more deeply embedded in the old <b>flower</b> <b>spike.</b>|$|E
5|$|Aboriginal people, {{particularly}} the Nyoongar and Yamatji, placed the <b>flower</b> <b>spike</b> in a paperbark-lined hole {{filled with water}} to make a sweet drink. Both this species and B.aemula have been credited with the inspiration behind May Gibbs' Big Bad Banksia Men; this species was familiar to Gibbs in her childhood and likely gave her the initial inspiration, although the depictions resemble the latter species. Artist Marianne North produced a highly regarded painting of B.attenuata during her stay in Australia in 1880–1881.|$|E
500|$|Historically, {{indigenous}} Australians obtained nectar from B.integrifolia by {{stroking the}} <b>flower</b> <b>spikes</b> then licking their hands, or by steeping <b>flower</b> <b>spikes</b> in a coolamon overnight. They {{also used the}} <b>flower</b> <b>spikes</b> as hairbrushes. Early settlers used the nectar as a syrup for sore throats and colds; and bushmen would impregnate barren [...] "cones" [...] with fat to make a slow-burning candle.|$|R

5|$|Banksia telmatiaea, {{commonly}} known as swamp fox banksia or rarely marsh banksia, is a shrub that grows in marshes and swamps along the lower west coast of Australia. It grows as an upright bush up to 2m (7ft) tall, with narrow leaves and a pale brown <b>flower</b> <b>spike,</b> which can produce profuse quantities of nectar. First collected in the 1840s, it was not published as a separate species until 1981; as with several other similar species it was previously included in B.sphaerocarpa (Fox Banksia).|$|E
5|$|George placed B.telmatiaea in {{subgenus}} Banksia {{because its}} inflorescence {{is a typical}} Banksia <b>flower</b> <b>spike,</b> section Oncostylis because it has hooked styles, and series Abietinae because its inflorescence is roughly spherical. He considered its closest relative to be B.leptophylla (Slender-leaved Banksia), which differs from B.telmatiaea in having longer leaves and larger flowers; yet in his arrangement he placed it between B.scabrella (Burma Road Banksia) and B.laricina (Rose-fruited Banksia).|$|E
5|$|In 1981, George {{published}} a revised arrangement that placed B.attenuata in the subgenus Banksia {{because of its}} <b>flower</b> <b>spike,</b> section Banksia because its styles are straight rather than hooked, and the series Cyrtostylis, a large and rather heterogenous series of twelve species. He conceded its large emarginate cotyledons (having a notch in their apex) were quite different from other members, {{and that it had}} similarities in flower architecture to another anomalous member B.elegans. He felt B.attenuata to have affinities to B.lindleyana and B.media.|$|E
25|$|It is {{also very}} popular for cut flower production, {{not just because of}} its {{attractive}} foliage and <b>flower</b> <b>spikes,</b> but also because <b>flower</b> <b>spikes</b> occur terminally on a branch, allowing flowers to be cut with a stem.|$|R
25|$|The Indigenous {{people of}} {{south-western}} Australia would suck on the <b>flower</b> <b>spikes</b> {{to obtain the}} nectar, they also soaked the <b>flower</b> <b>spikes</b> in water to make a sweet drink. Banksia trees are a reliable source of insect larvae which are extracted as food.|$|R

5|$|In his 1981 {{monograph}} The genus Banksia L.f. (Proteaceae), Alex George placed B.caleyi in B.subg. Banksia {{because its}} inflorescence {{is a typical}} Banksia <b>flower</b> <b>spike</b> shape; in B.sect. Banksia because of its straight styles; and B.ser. Tetragonae because of its pendulous inflorescences. He considered its closest relative to be B.aculeata, which has narrower leaves with fewer, larger lobes; longer perianths, which grade from red to cream rather than from cream to red; shorter pistils; and also differences in the follicles, seeds and flowering time.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many members}} of the family Proteaceae, Banksia menziesii is largely self-incompatible; that is, inflorescences require pollinators to be fertilised and produce seed. One {{mechanism}} by which the species promotes cross-pollination with other plants is protandry, whereby the male parts release pollen that becomes non-viable before the female parts become receptive on the same <b>flower</b> <b>spike.</b> The individual flowers are uniform, and it is unclear why so few go on to develop follicles. Published in 1988, a field study conducted in banksia woodland near Perth noted that anthesis occurred on an inflorescence at an average rate of 40 to 60 florets opening per day, although this varied widely between different flowerheads. Foraging by honeyeaters would cause the florets to open, but bees would not.|$|E
5|$|The current taxonomic {{arrangement}} of the genus Banksia is based on botanist Alex George's 1999 monograph for the Flora of Australia book series. In this arrangement, B.dentata is placed in Banksia subgenus Banksia, because its inflorescences {{take the form of}} Banksias characteristic flower spikes, section Banksia because of its straight styles, and series Salicinae because its inflorescences are cylindrical. There has been debate on which species it is most closely related to. Alf Salkin had noted that B.dentata displays characteristics which are primitive within the genus. Unlike southern banksias, it has small juvenile leaves and broad dentate adult leaves. Alex George concluded initially that its affinities lay with Banksia integrifolia on account of their similar inflorescences. In a morphological cladistic analysis published in 1994, Kevin Thiele placed it in the newly described subseries Acclives along with B.plagiocarpa, B.robur and B.oblongifolia within the series Salicinae. These four species all have follicles which point slightly upwards towards the apex of the <b>flower</b> <b>spike.</b> It was held to be most closely related to B.robur on account of its large undulate leaves. Salkin had also noted that the seedling leaves of B.dentata, B.robur and B.oblongifolia were all similar and roughly linear, suggesting a close relationship. However, this subgrouping of the Salicinae was not supported by George; he discounted a close relationship with B.robur, which he felt was too distinctive.|$|E

25|$|The {{flowers are}} {{arranged}} in flower spikes or capitate flower heads. The character most commonly associated with Banksia is the <b>flower</b> <b>spike,</b> an elongated inflorescence consisting of a woody axis covered in tightly-packed pairs of flowers attached at right angles. A single <b>flower</b> <b>spike</b> generally contains hundreds or even thousands of flowers; the most recorded is around 6000 on inflorescences of B.grandis. Not all Banksia have an elongate <b>flower</b> <b>spike,</b> however: {{the members of the}} small Isostylis complex have long been recognised as Banksias in which the <b>flower</b> <b>spike</b> has been reduced to a head; and recently the large genus Dryandra has been found to have arisen from within the ranks of Banksia, and sunk into it as B.ser. Dryandra. They similarly have capitate flower heads rather than spikes.|$|E
25|$|B.subg. Banksia can {{be traced}} back to Banksia verae, an unranked taxon {{published}} by Robert Brown in his 1810 Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen. Under Brown's arrangement, Banksia was divided into two groups based on inflorescence shape. Banksia verae was defined as containing those Banksia taxa with the elongate <b>flower</b> <b>spike</b> typical of Banksia, and it thus contained all but one species. The remaining species, B.ilicifolia (Holly-leaved Banksia), has a dome-shaped head and so was placed alone in Isostylis.|$|E
25|$|B.subg. Isostylis {{shares with}} B.ser. Dryandra the {{property}} of having compact, dome-shaped flower heads. Structurally, however, Isostylis flower heads are quite {{different from those of}} B.ser. Dryandra, having more in common with the erect flower spikes of other Banksia taxa. Specifically, Isostylis flower heads have an ovoid axis, suggestive of a greatly reduced <b>flower</b> <b>spike,</b> whereas Dryandra flower heads emerge from a flat receptable. Furthermore, Isostylis has thick follicles with a woolly coating, whereas Dryandra follicles are thin and hairless; and the involucral, common and floral bracts of Isostylis are unlike those of Dryandra.|$|E
5|$|A {{variety of}} pollinators have been {{recorded}} visiting the <b>flower</b> <b>spikes,</b> including New Holland honeyeater (Phylidonyris novaehollandiae), red wattlebird (Anthochaera carunculata), native and European honey bees, wasps and ants. The <b>flower</b> <b>spikes</b> drip nectar onto the ground or lower leaves, suggesting pollination by nonflying mammals, which are attracted to the scent. Being upside down may facilitate this process.|$|R

25|$|Specimens of Banksia {{were first}} {{collected}} by Sir Joseph Banks and Dr Daniel Solander, naturalists on the Endeavour during Lieutenant (later Captain) James Cook's 1770 voyage to the Pacific Ocean. By {{the time of}} Meissner's arrangement, 58 species were recognised. The most recent taxonomic arrangement, which had stood since 1830, was Brown's 1830 arrangement. Brown had divided Banksia into two unranked taxa: Banksia verae ("true banksia"), later renamed Eubanksia, containing all species with the <b>flower</b> <b>spike</b> then considered characteristic of the genus; and Isostylis, containing only B.ilicifolia, which is unusual in having a dome-shaped inflorescence.|$|E
500|$|Banksia brownii {{was first}} {{collected}} near King George Sound in 1829 by William Baxter, who named it {{in honour of}} botanist Robert Brown. A formal description was published by Brown in his 1830 Supplementum Primum Prodromi Florae Novae Hollandiae; thus the full botanic name of the species is Banksia brownii Baxter ex R.Br. Under Brown's taxonomic arrangement, B.brownii was placed in subgenus Banksia verae, the [...] "true banksias", because its inflorescence is a typical Banksia <b>flower</b> <b>spike.</b> Banksia verae was renamed Eubanksia by Stephan Endlicher in 1847.|$|E
500|$|Brown {{eventually}} {{published the}} species in his 1810 work On {{the natural order}} of plants called Proteaceae. The specific name is derived from the Latin words ilex [...] "holly" [...] and folium [...] "leaf", hence [...] "holly-leaved". In 1810, Brown published Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen in which he arranged the genus into two unranked groups. B.ilicifolia was placed alone in Isostylis because of its unusual dome-shaped inflorescences. All other species were placed in Banksia verae, the [...] "true banksias", because they have the elongate <b>flower</b> <b>spike</b> then considered characteristic of Banksia.|$|E

The sugar glider (Petaurus breviceps) forages among the <b>flower</b> <b>spikes</b> and is a probable pollinator. The common blossom bat (Syconycteris australis) feeds on nectar. B.dentata has been recorded as a host plant for the mistletoe species Amyema benthamii, Decaisnina angustata and D.signata.|$|R
500|$|In his 1981 {{monograph}} The genus Banksia L.f. (Proteaceae), Australian botanist Alex George placed B.sceptrum in B.subg. Banksia {{because its}} inflorescence {{is a typical}} Banksia <b>flower</b> <b>spike</b> shape, in B.sect. Banksia because of its straight styles, and in B.ser. Banksia because of its robust inflorescence and hairy pistil that is prominently curved before anthesis. He added that its follicles resembled those of Banksia ornata, while the [...] seed body resembled those of B. speciosa and B. baxteri, though its obovate, crinkled cotyledons suggested an affinity with the series Cyrtostylis.|$|E
500|$|Robert Brown {{recorded}} 31 {{species of}} Banksia in his 1810 work Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen, {{and in his}} taxonomic arrangement, placed the taxon in the subgenus Banksia verae, the [...] "True Banksias", because the inflorescence is a typical Banksia <b>flower</b> <b>spike.</b> By the time Carl Meissner published his 1856 arrangement of the genus, there were 58 described Banksia species. Meissner divided Brown's Banksia verae, which had been renamed Eubanksia by Stephan Endlicher in 1847, into four series based on leaf properties. He placed B.speciosa in the series Dryandroideae.|$|E
500|$|Banksia dentata {{is used as}} a nectar {{source in}} the honey bee industry. Aborigines in the Northern Territory would light old seed cones and use them as firebrands, these lasting for up to two hours. The nectar was {{consumed}} by indigenous people. A hot smoking <b>flower</b> <b>spike</b> was used to cauterise leprosy sores, and people suffering from diarrhea would squat over smoking cones in the hope this would relieve their symptoms. [...] The thin woody spikes that did not develop follicles were used as nasal ornaments by aboriginal women, and flower spikes were used as combs.|$|E
5|$|The <b>flower</b> <b>spikes</b> of B. paludosa {{are unable}} to self-pollinate and require pollinators to set seed. A 1988 isozyme study showed very high rates of outcrossing; pollen from one plant is well-mixed among other plants in the locale. Nonflying mammals are {{important}} pollinators in heathland habitat, with the brown antechinus (Antechinus stuartii) a frequent visitor to <b>flower</b> <b>spikes.</b> The sugar glider (Petaurus breviceps) is another mammal pollinator. Bird species that have been observed foraging and feeding at the flowers include the red wattlebird (Anthochaera carunculata), yellow-faced honeyeater (Lichenostomus chrysops), white-eared honeyeater (L. leucotis), crescent honeyeater (Phylidonyris pyrrhoptera), New Holland honeyeater (P.novaehollandiae), and eastern spinebill (Acanthorhynchus tenuirostris).
