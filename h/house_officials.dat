5|$|On March 23, 1983, President Reagan {{announced}} the Strategic Defense Initiative, a ground and space-based weapons {{system designed to}} protect from nuclear attack. Matlock continued to advise the President on policy toward the Soviet Union and on September 1, 1983, when the Soviets shot down commercial flight KAL 007, Matlock returned to Washington to work with White <b>House</b> <b>officials.</b>|$|E
5|$|Carney's {{appointment}} to diplomatic postings {{in countries that}} had often difficult relations with the United States earned him both praise and criticism from observers for his hands-on diplomatic style. His strong views on Iraq's reconstruction efforts after the war in 2003 were in part responsible for a wholesale change in the Bush administration's strategy to stabilize the war-torn nation. He also advocated engagement with Sudan {{at a time when}} White <b>House</b> <b>officials</b> and the C.I.A. wanted the U.S. Embassy closed in Khartoum.|$|E
5|$|On June 2, 1956, the Republican National Committee {{announced}} that Chotiner {{would have no}} role in the upcoming campaign. On June 6, a House subcommittee disclosed that the California attorney had written to President Eisenhower asking the President to intercede on behalf of Stanley Weiss's low-cost charter line North American Airlines (NAA) before the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB). The attorney admitted inquiring of White House aides concerning the case, but denied using any influence on behalf of any client. White <b>House</b> <b>officials</b> said that they had done no more than ask the CAB when a decision might be expected in NAA's case, and that NAA had lost before the CAB anyway.|$|E

5|$|During the Syrian Civil War, Clinton and the Obama {{administration}} initially {{sought to}} persuade Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to engage popular demonstrations with reform, then as government violence allegedly rose in August 2011, called {{for him to}} resign from the presidency. The administration joined several countries in delivering non-lethal assistance to so-called rebels opposed to the Assad government and humanitarian groups working in Syria. During mid-2012, Clinton formed a plan with CIA Director David Petraeus to further strengthen the opposition by arming and training vetted groups of Syrian rebels, but the proposal {{was rejected by the}} White <b>House</b> <b>officials</b> who were reluctant to become entangled in the conflict and who feared that extremists hidden among the rebels might turn the weapons against other targets.|$|E
5|$|One of President Garfield's more wearying duties {{was seeing}} office seekers, {{and he saw}} Guiteau at least once. White <b>House</b> <b>officials</b> {{suggested}} to Guiteau that he approach Blaine, as the consulship was within the Department of State. Blaine also saw the public regularly, and Guiteau became a regular at these sessions. Blaine, who {{had no intention of}} giving Guiteau a position he was unqualified for and had not earned, simply stated that the deadlock in the Senate over Robertson's nomination made it impossible to consider the Paris consulship, which required Senate confirmation. Once the New York senators had resigned, and Robertson had been confirmed as Collector, Guiteau pressed his claim, and Blaine told him he would not receive the position.|$|E
25|$|I also do {{not believe}} it would be {{appropriate}} for me to offer opinions, as your letter suggests the committee may seek, about the ultimate responsibility of senior White <b>House</b> <b>officials</b> for the disclosure of Ms. Wilson's identity, or the sufficiency of the remedial measures that White <b>House</b> <b>officials</b> took after the leak. Prosecutors traditionally refrain from commenting outside of the judicial process on the actions of persons not charged with criminal offenses. Such individuals have significant privacy and due process interests that deserve protection as do the intemal deliberations of prosecutors relating to their conduct.|$|E

25|$|After White <b>House</b> <b>officials</b> {{asserted}} that Iran was supplying insurgents in Iraq with munitions, Pace questioned {{the validity of}} the claim in a February 2007 press conference.

25|$|Therefore, if law {{enforcement}} interviews of the President, Vice President or other senior White <b>House</b> <b>officials</b> become subject to routine public disclosure, even upon {{the conclusion of}} an investigation, there is an increased likelihood that such officials could feel reluctant to participate in voluntary interviews or, if they agree to such voluntary interviews, could decline to answer questions on certain topics.|$|E

25|$|The {{draft report}} of the House Government Reform Committee said the {{documents}} – largely Abramoff's billing records and e-mails – listed 485 lobbying contacts with White <b>House</b> <b>officials</b> over three years, including 10 with top Bush aide Karl Rove.

25|$|In late 1972, Cronkite prodded the show's {{producers}} to feature two nights of lengthy explanation on the Watergate scandal, {{which had been}} extensively covered by The Washington Post, but had not received major national coverage.

25|$|In particular, Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak has met several Trump {{campaign}} {{members and}} administration nominees; involved people dismissed those meetings as routine conversations {{in preparation for}} assuming the presidency. Trump's team has issued at least twenty denials concerning communications between his campaign and Russian officials; several of these denials {{turned out to be}} false. In the early months of 2017, Trump and other senior White <b>House</b> <b>officials</b> asked the Director of National Intelligence, the NSA director, the FBI director, and two chairs of congressional committees to publicly dispute the news reports about contacts between Trump associates and Russia.|$|E

25|$|According to the New York Times, Israel {{sought help}} from the United States for a {{military}} attack against Iran. Israel reportedly asked for bunker-busting bombs for an attack on Iran's main nuclear complex and for permission to fly over Iraq to reach Iran's major nuclear complex at Natanz. The Bush administration rejected the requests. According to the article, White <b>House</b> <b>officials</b> never conclusively determined whether Israel had {{decided to go ahead}} with the strike before the United States protested, or whether Prime Minister Ehud Olmert of Israel was trying to goad the White House into more decisive action before President Bush left office.|$|E
25|$|By 1975, Jimmy Hoffa was {{planning}} to seize {{the presidency of the}} Teamsters again. Hoffa had been released from prison on December 23, 1971, when President Richard Nixon commuted his sentence to time served. According to the United States Department of Justice and White <b>House</b> <b>officials,</b> Hoffa's release was granted on the condition that he not participate directly or indirectly in union activities until 1980. But Hoffa contended that he had never agreed to any such condition, and unsuccessfully sued to have the restriction overturned. But Fitzsimmons supported the government's position, and Charles Colson, special counsel to President Nixon who helped negotiate Hoffa's release, backed Fitzsimmon's interpretation of the release agreement.|$|E
25|$|Todd Park, the U.S. chief {{technology}} officer, initially said on October 6 that the glitches {{were caused by}} unexpected high volume when the site drew 250,000 simultaneous users instead of the 50,000-60,000 expected. He claimed that the site would have worked with fewer simultaneous users. More than 8.1 million people visited the site from October 1 to 4. White <b>House</b> <b>officials</b> subsequently conceded {{that it was not}} just an issue of volume, but involved software and systems design issues. For example, consumers are required to create an account before being able to compare plans, and the registration process may have created a bottleneck that led to the long wait times. Also, stress tests done by contractors 1 day before the launch date revealed that the site became too slow with only 1,100 simultaneous users, nowhere near even the 50,000-60,000 expected.|$|E

25|$|On July 19, 2010, Shirley Sherrod {{was fired}} from her {{appointed}} position as Georgia State Director of Rural Development for the United States Department of Agriculture. Her firing was an administration reaction to media reports on video excerpts from her address to an event of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in March 2010 and commentary posted by conservative blogger Andrew Breitbart on his website. Based on these excerpts, the NAACP condemned Sherrod's remarks as racist and US government officials called on the official to resign. However, review of her full speech showed that the excerpts had been selectively edited, and that her remarks – understood in context – were {{about the importance of}} overcoming personal prejudices. The NAACP and White <b>House</b> <b>officials</b> then apologized for their earlier criticisms, and United States Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack apologized for the firing and offered Sherrod a new position.|$|E

500|$|That October, {{a meeting}} {{concerning}} Sandwedge was arranged between Haldeman, Mitchell, Magruder and Strachan.

Another factor in Caulfield's removal from the helm was the belief of several White <b>House</b> <b>officials,</b> including Dean, that Caulfield's Irish-American, non-college educated background was at odds with [...] "an Administration of WASP professional men".|$|E
