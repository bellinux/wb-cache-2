A hydroelectric dam originally built to provide baseload power will have its generators sized according to the average flow of water into the reservoir. Uprating such a dam with additional generators increases its peak power output capacity, thereby increasing its capacity to operate as a virtual grid <b>energy</b> <b>storage</b> <b>unit.</b> The United States Bureau of Reclamation reports an investment cost of $69 per kilowatt capacity to uprate an existing dam, compared to more than $400 per kilowatt for oil-fired peaking generators.

Functioning as a virtual grid storage unit in this way, the uprated dam {{is one of the most}} efficient forms of energy storage, because it has no pumping losses to fill its reservoir, only increased losses to evaporation and leakage.|$|E

50|$|The basic {{spot welder}} {{consists}} of a power supply, an <b>energy</b> <b>storage</b> <b>unit</b> (e.g., a capacitor bank), a switch, a welding transformer, and the welding electrodes. The energy storage element allows the welder to deliver high instantaneous power levels. If the power demands are not high, then the energy storage element isn't needed. The switch causes the stored energy to be dumped into the welding transformer. The welding transformer steps down the voltage and steps up the current. An important feature of the transformer is it reduces the current level that the switch must handle. The welding electrodes {{are part of the}} transformer's secondary circuit. There is also a control box that manages the switch and may monitor the welding electrode voltage or current.|$|E
