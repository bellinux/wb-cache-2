The methods employed are {{not restricted to}} the Conical-Gregorian antenna, but apply {{in a general way}} to dual and even multiple reflector systems. Complex vector wave methods are used in the Fresnel and <b>Fraunhofer</b> <b>regions</b> of the reflectors. Field amplitude, phase, polarization data, and time average Poynting vectors are obtained via an IBM 360 / 91 digital computer.

40|$|Some of the {{features}} of single and dual parabolic-cylinder reflector antenna systems are discussed in terms of wave conversions, field divergence, and wavefronts in Fresnel and <b>Fraunhofer</b> <b>regions.</b> Beam-squinting, by mechanical displacement and electrical phase gradient methods, is introduced together with the combination of these methods. In the case of dual parabolic cylinders there is also a discussion of surface-truncation, parametric representation of surface intersections, main-aperture blockage by the subsystem, and beam squinting. A few diffraction patterns are presented to illustrate the type of data available via a formulation equivalent to the complex-vector Kirchhoff-Kottler formulation. Main and cross-polarization components of the solution are available as they are inherently part of the field solution in the Cartesian coordinate system. A means of displaying main and cross-polarization components for arbitrary beam-scanning in space is outlined. Extensions to monopulse tracking with variable-beamwidth (zooming) capability are introduced...|$|R
40|$|Interference and {{diffraction}} {{of light}} are elementary topics in optics. The {{aim of the}} work presented here is to develop an accurate and cheap optical-system simulation software that provides a virtual laboratory for studying the effects of propagation in both time and space for the near- and far-field regions. In laboratory sessions, this software can let optical engineering undergraduates simulate many optical systems based on thin slits. The numerical method used is the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method that has been successfully applied in many engineering fields. Using this numerical method, the irradiance distribution can be successfully evaluated in different planes far from the simulation grid without degrading performance. In addition, an easy-to-use MATLAB GUI handles all {{the parameters of the}} FDTD simulation and computes theoretical values of irradiance for both the Fresnel and <b>Fraunhofer</b> <b>regions.</b> Therefore, by using this software, the student is able to analyze the behavior of the Fresnel and Fraunhofer expressions {{as a function of the}} distance. This distance is defined as the space between the slits plane and the plane that contains the virtual screen on which the irradiance pattern is represented.

40|$|Vegetation {{productivity}} {{is driven by}} nitrogen (N) availability in soils. Both excessive and low soil N induce physiological changes in plant foliage. In 2001, we examined the use of spectral fluorescence and reflectance measurements to discriminate among plants provided different N fertilizer application rates: 20 %, 50 %, 100 % and 150 % of optimal N levels. A suite of optical, fluorescence, and biophysical measurements were collected on leaves from field grown corn (Zea mays L.) and soybean plants (Glycine max L.) grown in pots (greenhouse + ambient sunlight daily). Three types of steady state laser-induced fluorescence measurements were made on adaxial and abaxial surfaces: 1) fluorescence images in four 10 nm bands (blue, green, red, far-red) resulting from broad irradiance excitation; 2) emission spectra (5 nm resolution) produced by excitation at single wavelengths (280, 380 or 360, and 532 nm); and 3) excitation spectra (2 nm resolution), with emission wavelengths fixed at wavelengths centered on selected solar Fraunhofer lines (532, 607, 677 and 745 nm). Two complementary sets of high resolution (less than 2 nm) optical spectra were acquired for both adaxial and abaxial leaf surfaces: 1) optical properties (350 - 2500 nm) for reflectance, transmittance, and absorptance; and 2) reflectance spectra (500 - 1000 nm) acquired with and without a short pass filter at 665 nm to determine the fluorescence contribution to apparent reflectance in the 650 - 750 spectrum, especially at the 685 and 740 nm chlorophyll fluorescence (ChIF) peaks. The strongest relationships between foliar chemistry and optical properties were demonstrated for C/N content and two optical parameters associated with the red edge inflection point. Select optical properties and ChIF parameters were highly correlated for both species. A significant contribution of ChIF to apparent reflectance was observed, averaging 10 - 25 % at 685 nm and 2 - 6 % at 740 nm over all N treatments. Discrimination of N treatment groups was possible with specific fluorescence band ratios (e. g., F 740 /F 525 obtained with 380 EX). From all measurements assessing fluorescence, higher ChIF and blue/green emissions were measured from the abaxial leaf surfaces; Abaxial surfaces also produced higher reflectances in the 400 - 800 nm spectrum. Fluorescence information collected in <b>Fraunhofer</b> <b>regions</b> located {{on the shoulders of}} ChIF features compared favorably with peak emissions. This supports the potential capability of a future space-born interferometer sensor to capture plant canopy fluorescence...|$|R

50|$|Scattering-based DDM {{belongs to}} the {{so-called}} near-field (or deep Fresnel) scattering family, a recently introduced family of imaging-based scattering methods. Near field is used here {{in a similar way}} to what is used for near field speckles i.e. as a particular case of Fresnel region as opposed to the far field or <b>Fraunhofer</b> <b>region.</b> The near field scattering family includes also quantitative shadowgraphy and Schlieren.|$|E
50|$|From Maxwell's {{equations}} we {{find that}} radio waves, as they exist in free space in the far field or <b>Fraunhofer</b> <b>region</b> behave as plane waves. In plane waves the electric field, magnetic field and direction of propagation are mutually perpendicular.

5000|$|Many {{possible}} uses of terahertz sensing and imaging {{are proposed}} in manufacturing, quality control, and process monitoring. These in general exploit the traits of plastics and cardboard being transparent to terahertz radiation, {{making it possible}} to inspect packaged goods. The first imaging system based on optoelectronic terahertz time-domain spectroscopy were developed in 1995 by researchers from AT&T Bell Laboratories and was used for producing a transmission image of a packaged electronic chip. This system used pulsed laser beams with duration in range of picoseconds. Since then commonly used commercial/ research terahertz imaging systems have used pulsed lasers to generate terahertz images. The image can be developed based on either the attenuation or phase delay of the transmitted terahertz pulse. Since the beam is scattered more at the edges and also different materials have different absorption coefficients, the images based on attenuation indicates edges and different materials inside of an objects. This approach is similar to X-ray transmission imaging, where images are developed based on attenuation of the transmitted beam. In the second approach, terahertz images are developed based on the time delay of the received pulse. In this approach, thicker parts of the objects are well recognized as the thicker parts cause more time delay of the pulse. Energy of the laser spots are distributed by a Gaussian function. The geometry and behavior of Gaussian beam in the <b>Fraunhofer</b> <b>region</b> imply that the electromagnetic beams diverge more as the frequencies of the beams decrease and thus the resolution decreases. This implies that terahertz imaging systems have higher resolution than scanning acoustic microscope (SAM) but lower resolution than X-ray imaging systems. Although terahertz can be used for inspection of packaged objects, it suffers from low resolution for fine inspections. X-ray image and terahertz images of an electronic chip are brought in the figure on the right. Obviously the resolution of X-ray is higher than terahertz image, but X-ray is ionizing and can be impose harmful effects on certain objects such as semiconductors and live tissues. To overcome low resolution of the terahertz systems near-field terahertz imaging systems are under development. In nearfield imaging the detector needs to be located very close {{to the surface of the}} plane and thus imaging of the thick packaged objects may not be feasible. In another attempt to increase the resolution, laser beams with frequencies higher than terahertz are used to excite the p-n junctions in semiconductor objects, the excited junctions generate terahertz radiation as a result as long as their contacts are unbroken and in this way damaged devices can be detected. [...] In this approach, since the absorption increases exponentially with the frequency, again inspection of the thick packaged semiconductors may not be doable. Consequently, a tradeoff between the achievable resolution and the thickness of the penetration of the beam in the packaging material should be considered.|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} Fresnel and Fraunhofer diffraction on regular structures {{generated by}} multiplicative iterative procedures. We {{prove that the}} iterative procedure of field construction is preserved during Fresnel diffraction, while the initiator of the structure in the Fresnel region is the Fresnel transform of the original structure.

40|$|International audienceThe {{concept of}} fractal geometry, {{introduced}} by Mandelbrot has been explored in diverse areas of science, including acoustics [1]. First {{part of this}} work relates the properties of far-field <b>Fraunhofer</b> <b>region</b> diffraction in wave acoustics for characterizing reflection on a periodic regular indented plane. Diffusion prediction of a self-similar structure, the Sierpinski carpet, is then developed through the computation of its spatial Fourier transform. Scattering intensity computation results show that after propagation of a coherent plane wave through the structure, the resulting acoustical field displays fractal properties itself, showing a self-similar structure of the reflected signal. This computational approach of the Sierpinski carpet's scattering properties will lead us to develop, in a near future, an acoustic angular scattering measurement process, applied to a Sierpinski tetrahedron 3 -D scale model...|$|E
40|$|The {{near-field}} {{phase modulation}} (NFPM) {{caused by the}} plasma scalds is investigated with a newly proposed mixed overcoat layer model. Based on the NFPM, the far-field intensity modulation (FFIM) is calculated and discussed with the scalar diffraction theory. The results indicate that both the NFPM and FFIM {{are sensitive to the}} scalding depth. A feature curve is developed to analyze the NFPM for arbitrary scalding depth. The modulation can be ignored when the scalding depth is less than the first feature point in the feature curve. Even though the diffraction intensity in the Fresnel region can be enhanced dozens of times, the FFIM in the <b>Fraunhofer</b> <b>region</b> can recover gradually if the scalding depth is below a critical value. The preliminary experimental results are consistent with the theoretical prediction. (C) 2015 Optical Society of Americ...|$|E
40|$|A novel {{method to}} {{accurately}} and efficiently model {{the interaction between}} radiating devices is proposed. Whereas previous work of the authors dealt with singleport devices (antennas), this paper constitutes an important extension to actual multiport devices, as such {{paving the way for}} electromagnetic interference assessment of real-life (sub) systems early in their design cycle. The method solely relies on the knowledge of the radiation patterns of the different ports of the devices, which can either be measured or simulated using a solver of choice. These patterns are then used to compute the electromagnetic interaction between the devices that may be positioned in each other's radiative near-field (Fresnel region) or far-field (<b>Fraunhofer</b> <b>region).</b> Furthermore, in the model, their relative positions and orientations can be altered at a very low computational cost. The technique is thoroughly validated and illustrated, demonstrating its appositeness to study the electromagnetic compatibility behavior of the multiport devices...|$|E

A dual-reflector system (Cassegrain) was also simulated for the transmitting case, and fields were computed in the <b>Fraunhofer</b> <b>region.</b> Appended results include derivations which show that the vector Kirchhoff-Kottler formulation has an equivalent form requiring only incident magnetic fields as a driving function. Satisfaction of the radiation conditions at infinity by the equivalent form is demonstrated by a conversion from Cartesian to spherical vector operators. A subsequent development presents the formulation by which Fresnel or Fraunhofer patterns are obtainable for dual-reflector systems.

40|$|Axisymmetric {{radiating}} and scattering structures whose rotational invariance {{is broken}} by non-axisymmetric excitations present an important class {{of problems in}} electromagnetics. For such problems, a cylindrical wave decomposition formalism {{can be used to}} efficiently obtain numerical solutions to the full-wave frequency-domain problem. Often, the far-field, or <b>Fraunhofer</b> <b>region</b> is of particular interest in scattering cross-section and radiation pattern calculations; yet, it is usually impractical to compute full-wave solutions for this region. Here, we propose a generalization of the Stratton-Chu far-field integral adapted for 2. 5 D formalism. The integration over a closed, axially symmetric surface is analytically reduced to a line integral on a meridional plane. We benchmark this computational technique by comparing it with analytical Mie solutions for a plasmonic nanoparticle, and apply it to the design of a three-dimensional polarization-insensitive cloak.

40|$|Solutions are {{presented}} for the electromagnetic fields radiated by an arbitrarily oriented current filament located above a perfectly conducting ground plane and excited by a traveling current wave. Both an approximate solution, valid in the <b>fraunhofer</b> <b>region</b> of the filament and predicting the radiation {{terms in the}} fields, and an exact solution, which predicts both near and far field components of the electromagnetic fields, {{are presented}}. Both solutions apply to current waveforms which propagate along the channel but are valid regardless of the actual waveshape. The exact solution is valid only for waves which propagate {{at the speed of}} light, and the approximate solution is formulated for arbitrary velocity of propagation. The spectrum-magnitude of the fourier transform-of the radiated fields is computed by assuming a compound exponential model for the current waveform. The effects of channel orientation and length, as well as velocity of propagation of the current waveform and location of the observer, are discussed.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a theoretical and numerical {{investigation of the}} spatially averaged electric field in the beam of a circular aperture. The investigation leads to closed-form analytical expressions, based on scalar diffraction theory, which describe the spatially averaged electric field in the Fresnel region of a circular aperture excited by a spatially uniform, harmonic plane wave. The expressions ultimately permit rapid, practical, and efficient prediction of certain routine electromagnetic measurements. Because the expressions are valid in the Fresnel region, they are also valid in the near field, the far field, and the <b>Fraunhofer</b> <b>region</b> of a circular aperture. In fact, it is shown that the closed-form expressions contain, as special cases, classic on-axis and far-field results associated with a circular aperture. The analytical expressions {{are based on a}} generalization of Fresnel diffraction originally developed by Lommel in the late 1800 s. Hence, a thorough review of the literature on the Lommel diffraction formulation is presented. Finally, it is shown that results obtained from the closed-form expressions compare quite favorably to results obtained from the exact solution computed via the dyadic Green 2 ̆ 7 s function approach...|$|E
