50|$|Rigid belt {{actuators}} can {{be thought}} of as rack and pinion devices that use a flexible rack. Rigid belt actuators use two reinforced plastic ribbed belts, that engage with pinions mounted on <b>drive</b> <b>shafts</b> within a <b>housing.</b> The belts have evenly spaced load bearing blocks on the non-ribbed face. As the pinions spin, the belts are rotated 90 degrees through the housing, which interlocks the blocks like a zipper into a rigid linear form. The resulting beam or column is effective at resisting tension and compression (buckling). Because the actuating member can fold on itself, it can be stored relatively compactly in a storage magazine, either in an overlapping or coiled arrangement. The actuator is driven by an electric motor.|$|R

Rigid chain actuators use limited-articulation chains, usually resembling a roller chain, that engage with pinions mounted on a <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> within a <b>housing.</b> The links of the actuating member, the “rigid chain”, are articulated {{in a manner that}} they deflect from a straight line to one side only. As the pinions spin, the links of the chain are rotated 90 degrees through the housing, which guides and locks the chain into a rigid linear form effective at resisting tension and compression (buckling). Because the actuating member can fold on itself, it can be stored relatively compactly in a storage magazine, either in an overlapping or coiled arrangement. Rigid chain actuators are generally driven by electric motors. Most rigid chains are manufactured from steel.|$|R

Many methods are available at present for the design optimization of structural systems and these methods based on mathematical programming techniques involving gradient search and direct search. These methods assume that the design variables are continuous. But in practical structural engineering optimization, almost all the design variables are discrete. This is due to the availability of components in standard sizes and constraints due to construction and manufacturing practices.
