50|$|Two-piece plain {{bearings}}, {{known as}} full bearings in industrial machinery, {{are commonly used}} for larger diameters, such as crankshaft bearings. The two halves are called shells. There are various systems used to keep the shells located. The most common method is a tab on the parting line edge that correlates with a notch in the housing to prevent axial movement after installation. For large, thick shells a button stop or <b>dowel</b> <b>pin</b> is used. The button stop is screwed to the housing, while the <b>dowel</b> <b>pin</b> keys the two shells together. Another less common method uses a <b>dowel</b> <b>pin</b> that keys the shell to the housing through a hole or slot in the shell.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{a variety}} of specifications, military, ISO, DIN, ASME that pins may be made to. And size can even vary by <b>dowel</b> <b>pin</b> material. Metric dowel pins are often found in two size. In DIN 6325 {{standard}} the dowel pins are slightly larger than the nominal value. For example a 3 mm <b>dowel</b> <b>pin</b> will range from 3.002 to 3.008. In the ISO 2338 standard the dowel pins are slightly smaller - 3mm nominal range is 2.986 to 3.000. The terminology (e.g. [...] "oversized", [...] "standard") is not entirely consistent across suppliers. In inch pins [...] "oversized" [...] refers to pins that are more significantly oversized for worn out <b>dowel</b> <b>pin</b> holes.

5000|$|The {{bell housing}} bolt pattern {{for the old}} AMC 196 Straight-6 engine {{is the same as}} for the more modern early 199 and 232 (used from 1964 to 1971), but the 196 had {{different}} <b>dowel</b> <b>pin</b> sizes. AMC's 1956 to 1966 V8s used a different bell housing bolt pattern that was slightly larger in diameter than the six cylinder bell. When AMC discontinued their first V8 engine design after 1966, the bell housing changed; all 1966-up V8 bell housing bolt patterns are the same. The bell housing for six-cylinder engines changed to match the V8 in 1972 when AMC switched from Borg-Warner to Chrysler transmissions automatic. The flywheel also changed from 153 teeth (a common Chevy size) to 164 teeth (a common Ford size). Starter motors used with the 1966-up V8 bellhousing were sourced from Motorcraft which interchanges with the Ford V8 and some of their inline sixes (which uses a separate starter solenoid) - the Jeep 4.0 L uses a Mitsubishi-designed starter which has an integrated solenoid which is lighter in weight but retaining the two mounting bolts with a threaded top hole and unthreaded hole which bolts to the transmission bellhousing.|$|E

40|$|Statement of Problem: Given that meticulous implant {{prosthodontic}} {{procedures are}} recommended {{to obtain the}} best possible intraoral fit, the die systems used for multi implant casts warrant further investigation. Die stone expansion and errors introduced by removable die casts may exceed the accuracy required for the passive fit of implant prosthesis. Purpose: The {{purpose of the study}} was to evaluate the linear dimensional accuracy between the implant master die and three conceptually different die systems such as Pindex system, Accu-trac precision die system, and Conventional brass <b>dowel</b> <b>pin</b> system. Materials and Methods: Thirty impressions of implant master die were made with polyether impression material. Ten experimental implant casts were fabricated for each of the three different die systems tested: Accu-trac precision die tray system, Pindex system, and conventional brass <b>dowel</b> <b>pin</b> system. The solid experimental casts were sectioned and then removed from the die system 30 times. Linear distances between all six possible distances were measured from one centre of the transfer coping to the other, using a co-ordinate measuring machine in millimeters up to accuracy of 0. 5 microns. Data were tabulated and statistically analyzed by Binomial non parametric test using SPSS version 15. Results: Significant differences were found for distance A-B (P = 0. 002), A-C (P = 0. 002), A-D (P value = 0. 002), and B-D (P = 0. 021) in Conventional <b>Dowel</b> <b>pin</b> system however for Accu-trac precision die tray system, it was significant only for distance A-D (P = 0. 002) but for Pindex system it was non-significant for all the distances measured. Conclusion: Within the limitations of this study, use of Pindex system is recommended when sectioned dies are needed for a multi implant retained prosthesis...|$|E

30|$|The {{pairing of}} {{different}} isolates of X. polymorpha {{also created a}} significant number of zone lines. This result is somewhat surprising, as previous research indicated that isolates of X. polymorpha seldom manage to zone line wood internally, although it is completely capable of colonizing the wood [8, 11, 12]. There are several possible explanations for this effect. The addition of other fungi, whether those already inside the log, or simply the other isolate of X. polymorpha, may have stimulated antagonism and therefore also stimulated zone line production. It is also possible that the <b>dowel</b> <b>pin</b> inoculation forced internal zone line formation, as the fungus was not allowed to first colonize the external face before proceeding into the wood. Based upon the previous literature [3], this is the first instance in which X. polymorpha has produced {{a significant number of}} internal zone lines. As this fungus degrades wood at a much slower rate than T. versicolor or P. brumalis under controlled conditions [6, 13], its potential use in large-scale spalting will allow for similar zone line production to T. versicolor/S. cuboideum, without the potential for higher levels of white-rot decay.|$|E
40|$|Aim: The {{record of}} path of {{insertion}} on the dental cast {{is part of}} the dentist′s work authorization to the dental laboratory technician. The path of insertion record enables the dental technician to replace the cast on a surveyor in the same position that the dentist selected. Analysis of factors that influence the path of insertion should determine a path of insertion that will reduce the potential for dislodgement and promote stability of removable partial denture (RPD). Materials and Methods: The recording of the relation of a cast to a dental surveyor and the transfer of this relationship to the dental laboratory may be done by tripodization, by scoring the base of the cast, or by cementing a reference pin on the cast. Conclusion: Recording the established path of insertion can be difficult when the procedure uses a cemented pin and the casts are mounted in an articulator.

Current Connecting rods were used widely with <b>dowel</b> <b>pin</b> type or serration type. The fracture split method used for connecting rod is attracting attention as a mechanical method that can reduce production cost by decreasing the manufacturing processes. The Conventional micro alloyed steel {{can not be used}} for the fracture because of higher ductility. In this method powder metals and forged steel (C 70 S 6) are used.

In this research, an analytical beam mechanics model was developed to describe the elastic deflection of a cortical screw under a statically applied load. To test the predictive ability of the analytical model, a synthetic bone substitute was used for experiments. The bone substitute was a composite sandwich, consisting of two 6 mm cortical walls separated by a cancellous region. A novel instrument was developed to measure the bending deflection of screws under a radial load applied by a surgical plate at the screw head. A dial indicator and <b>dowel</b> <b>pin</b> arrangement was utilized to measure screw deflection at the screw head and {{along the length of}} the screw in order to determine a deflection curve for the screw axis.

30|$|One of {{the most}} {{promising}} wood value-added processes currently under development is spalting, where pigment is added to wood via fungal colonization. Previous studies have shown laboratory level spalting to be achievable and highly predictable. However, large-scale spalting for potential commercial applications introduces a substantial number of additional variables which impact the spalting process. To test the potential of commercial-scale spalting, Acer saccharum, Fagus grandifolia, and Populus tremuloides logs were inoculated with multiple known spalting fungi utilizing both liquid spray cultures and live <b>dowel</b> <b>pin</b> cultures. Many of the fungi that successfully produce spalting in small, sterile cultures also produced significant amounts in large logs, with many spalting patterns identical to those found in small-scale testing. Pairings of Trametes versicolor/Scytalidium cuboideum and Xylaria polymorpha/Xylaria polymorpha (different isolates) produced significant amounts of zone lines. In addition, the method of inoculation impacted the amount of spalting: more zone lines were produced when fungi were introduced via plugs, while more stain was produced when liquid cultures were sprayed onto the logs. These results indicate that many of the standard spalting fungi are suitable for large-scale applications; however, the inoculation method appears to be a vital component for successful spalting under a restricted time schedule.|$|E
