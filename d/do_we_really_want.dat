Because [...] "there was very little time for the listener or the viewer to really hone in on what's there musically", Tyler [...] "needed something that could be played a little bit more simply as a melody. Then all the orchestration—you know, I wrote these string lines that are actually, have kind of a fantastical, more complex nature to it. That just supports a melody that is more of a whistler." [...] Marvel agreed with this approach, and worked with Tyler to hone the orchestration; [...] "as the graphics were being <b>done</b> <b>we</b> <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> to hit little moments with some sparkly shimmer and get it more specific."

5000|$|Now {{continuing}} their {{career as a}} trio, with Ihsahn handling keyboards, vocals, guitars and bass, the band recorded their third album IX Equilibrium and toured Europe and North America. It was around 2000 when Samoth and Trym started to gravitate more towards death metal, while Ihsahn directed his musical exploration towards his side project, Peccatum. Thus, in 2001, Emperor decided to disband after releasing one final album, Prometheus: The Discipline of Fire & Demise, composed entirely by Ihsahn. Ihsahn later recalled that [...] "When we announced the split up in 2001, we didn't think <b>we</b> would <b>do</b> anything more with Emperor ever again...The decision was also based on the feeling that Emperor {{had a lot of}} integrity, and that {{if we were going to}} end it, we should end it while we still created great music. For us, the decision was made in the black metal spirit. Since Samoth and I pulled in different directions, we didn't see any point in continuing. The core of the band wasn't intact anymore". Samoth echoed Ihsahn's position: [...] "At that point, we both had other priorities that we wanted to pursue and we both felt that splitting up Emperor was the best thing to <b>do.</b> <b>We</b> <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> to focus on other things, and felt it was the only right thing to do".|$|R

[...] "We didn't look at any of the work they'd <b>done.</b> <b>We</b> <b>really</b> didn't <b>want</b> to know anything about it." [...] In February 2007, Lasseter announced Toy Story 2s co-director, Unkrich, as the sole director of the film instead of himself (Lasseter had directed the first two films and was busy directing Cars 2), and Michael Arndt as screenwriter. 2010 was also announced as the tentative release date.|$|R

The track is a pop song with strong funk influences, featuring a predominant horn sound in its composition. Oller told Teen Vogue: [...] "We {{just want to make}} music that's current and consistent with what everyone is vibing to. For 'Bad Girls', we recorded a real horn section which isn't something a lot of people <b>do</b> these days. <b>We</b> <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> {{to go back to that}} and go back to the roots of making music." ...|$|R

5000|$|After {{the release}} of the third FUs album, <b>Do</b> <b>We</b> <b>Really</b> <b>Want</b> to Hurt You? the band had begun to take a more {{aggressive}} rock direction, or more of a punk direction vs a hardcore direction [...] "whatever those words mean" [...] as Steve Grimes wrote in a band bio. The changes were taken further when the band changed its name to Straw Dogs, with guitarist Steve Martin and drummer Chris [...] "Bones" [...] Jones added to the line-up. As Straw Dogs, the band released an EP followed by two albums. Drummer Jones died in a car crash the day after the debut Straw Dogs LP was released. The EP and first LP, Straw Dogs and We Are Not Amused, respectively, were released on the Restless/Enigma label. The third album Your Own Worst Nightmare was released by Lone Wolf Records, an independent label from Toronto. European re-releases came from German label, Lost and Found Records, some of which were authorised by the band.|$|E

[...] By contrast, others praised the ad for celebrating the diversity of American people. Guardian writer Jill Filipovic noted that the company had been increasingly targeting minorities, such as Latino Americans (who {{are more likely to be}} heavy drinkers of soft drinks because of their low cost) and drew comparisons to the marketing of cigarettes to women, but that [...] "before we applaud Coke's advertising diversity, we should ask: <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>really</b> <b>want</b> Coke to diversify?" ...|$|E

A spokesperson for the Punjabi Taliban, Muhammad Umar, said that [...] "We don't follow a policy of attacking shrines.

Ansen and Lowing considered Shatner's direction during action sequences weak, with Lowing adding that {{the second half of the}} film felt directionless. Hicks wrote that the film's broad humor gave the film an inconsistent tone. In contrast, Chris Dafoe of the Toronto The Globe and Mail called it [...] "the most intentionally funny" [...] episode of the film series.

40|$|This report summarises {{the presentations}} made and discussions {{held at the}} Second of the ESRC/JISC Workshops Planning for the 2001 Census. The report {{presents}} views of expert census users and summarises the recommendations to ESRC and JISC about what kinds of data from the 2001 Census should be requested from the UK Census Offices. The Workshops are supported by ESRC Award H 507265031. The Census of Population {{is a very large}} exercise in data collection and processing. In 2001 some 25 million households in the United Kingdom will be contacted and asked to provide answers to a simple questionnaire of 25 to 30 questions. Such a task is likely to cost £ 125 - 150 millions to the Census Offices. Purchase of the data for academic research purposes is likely to cost ESRC and JISC some £ 1. 5 to £ 2 millions directly and an equivalent amount indirectly on support over the following decade. It is therefore essential that the Population Census is very carefully planned beforehand and that the greatest possible value is extracted from the data collected. This edited collection of papers reports on presentations and discussions in the Fourth and Final Workshop in the series Workshops Planning for the 2001 Census - Determining Academic Community Needs and Strategy. The Fourth Workshop was entitled The 2001 Census: What <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>really</b> <b>really</b> <b>want?.</b> The aim was to gather together and summarise the principal recommendations of the First (Geography), Second (Interfaces) and Third (Special Data Sets) Workshops. The Workshop was twinned with another on The One Number Census: A Research Workshop, organised by Ludi Simpson. The One Number Census project is a major undertaking by the Census Offices to deal with anticipated underenumeration by estimating how many households and people are missed by the standard enumeration. Part 1 of the report on Look Up Tables and Area Statistics contains chapters by David Martin on the output geography proposals for 2001, by Seraphim Alvanides and Stan Openshaw on further developments to the methods being used to define output areas and by Bob Barr on what the Look Up Tables associated with the 2001 Census should be like. These chapters contain key recommendations on census output geography. Part 2 of the report puts forward recommendations for the preparation of Microdata - Samples of Anonymised Records and Longitudinal Data from the 2001 Census. Angela Dale summarises the conclusions of the SARs Sub-Group of the Census Offices' Output Working Group. Brian Dodgeon and Heather Joshi document the essential features of the 2001 Census Link to the Longitudinal Study and make a final plea for some new questions. Part 3 of the report reviews proposals for the improvement of Interaction Statistics from the 2001 UK Census. Paul Boyle and Phil Rees make radical proposals for revamping the provision of Migration Statistics. Martin Frost concentrates on ways of improving the accuracy of the Workplace Statistics. The fourth part of the report gathers together recommendations about information technology interfaces to census data, arguing that the tools and infrastructure are now in place to make networked and standalone access to the different types of data so much easier for the new user. Donald Morse and Alistair Towers review what interfaces to boundary data should look like. James Harris argues for the development of interfaces based on general data standards and the Web to access census statistics. Oliver Duke-Williams outlines how complex migration statistics can be presented for access in a simpler and easier to use interface. Ian Turton identifies how current software developments in Java programming will make possible delivering easy to use interfaces to microdata very simple. Finally, Paul Williamson describes a design of a data dictionary for all census data sets. In Part 5, recommendations are summarised. Phil Rees reports on the views of 140 respondents drawn from the different corners of the academic community. The final pages try to draw out some general points from the very large number of recommendations made in the Fourth Workshop. ...|$|R

It does not even apply to any people who are not Germans; and of your wild guesses about some twenty other peoples, not one has gone right even by accident. Your two or three shots at my own not immaculate land have been such that you would have been much nearer the truth if you had tried to invade England by crossing the Caucasus, or to discover England among the South Sea Islands. With your first delusion, that our courage was calculated and malignant when in truth our very corruption was timid and confused, I have already dealt. The case is the same with your second favourite phrase; that the British army is mercenary. You learnt it in books and not in battlefields; and I should like to be present at a scene in which you tried to bribe the most miserable little loafer in Hammersmith {{as if he were a}} cynical condottiere selling his spear to some foreign city. It is not the fact, my dear sir. You have been misinformed. The British Army is not at this moment a hireling army any more than it is a conscript army. It is a volunteer army in the strict sense of the word; nor do I object to your calling it an amateur army. There is no compulsion, and there is next to no pay. It is at this moment drawn from every class of the community, and there are very few classes which would not earn a little more money in their ordinary trades. It numbers very nearly as many men as it would if it were a conscript army; that is with the necessary margin of men unable to serve or needed to serve otherwise. Ours is a country in which that democratic spirit which is common to Christendom is rather unusually sluggish and far below the surface. And the most genuine and purely popular movement that we have had since the Chartists has been the enlistment for this war.
