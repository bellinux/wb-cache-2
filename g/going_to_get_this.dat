2500|$|At the Old Trafford Roses Match in 1926, {{a record}} 78,617 spectators paid {{to watch the}} match peter out into a high scoring draw, with centuries from Lancashire's Harry Makepeace (126), Ernest Tyldesley (139) and 92 from Frank Watson being {{answered}} by Yorkshire legends Percy Holmes (143) and Herbert Sutcliffe (89) who put on 199 {{as if to make}} amends for events 2 years previously. Leonard Green, Lancashire's captain, was batting when the score stood at 499. Neville Cardus relates the story that Green said to himself [...] "It's not likely that Lancashire ever again will score 500 against Yorkshire, so I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>this</b> single run if it kills me." [...] He pushed a ball from Wilfred Rhodes to the off-side and ran 'like the wind'. The ball was hurled back in anger by Yorkshire legend Emmott Robinson, striking Rhodes on the wrist while Green dived to make his ground. Picking himself up he heard Rhodes muttering to himself:"There's somebody runnin' up and down this wicket. Ah don't know who it is, but there's some-body runnin' up and down this wicket." [...] The operative words in that famous lamentation are, [...] "Ah don't know who it is." ...|$|E
2500|$|The 4 May 2007 {{conviction}} of Peter Tobin {{for the murder}} of student Angelika Kluk led to speculation that he is Bible John. This thesis was spearheaded by Professor David Wilson, an expert in criminal behaviour, who was struck by two key aspects of Kluk's murder. Tobin was already in his 60s when the murder was committed, which is unusually late to start a killing career; {{and the fact that he}} attacked with such violence, then hid the body and ran away to London did not suggest the work of an amateur. There are striking parallels between Bible John and Peter Tobin. All three of Tobin's former wives gave accounts of being imprisoned, throttled, raped and beaten by him. There are strong similarities between photographs of Tobin when aged in his 20s and the photo fit artist's impression of Bible John. Tobin had moved from Glasgow in 1969 after marrying his first wife, whom he had met at the Barrowland ballroom the same year as Bible John's known killings ended. It is alleged by his former wives that Tobin is driven to violence by the menstrual cycle, something which has long been suspected as the motive behind the Bible John murders. Additionally, Tobin was a Roman Catholic with strong religious views. Former detective Joe Jackson, who investigated the murders in the 1960s, said he suspected Tobin the moment he was arrested for Kluk's murder in 2006. He said: [...] "When I saw his photograph, I thought, 'This is as near to Bible John as you are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get.</b> <b>This</b> looks a winner.' He fitted the bill in every way and he had connections with religion." ...|$|E

The perfectionist Kovacs describes in minute detail {{what had to be}} done and how to do it. The memo ends with this: [...] "I don't know how the hell you're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>this</b> done by Sunday - but 'rots of ruck." [...] (signed) [...] "Ernie (with love)".

5000|$|A {{few days}} after the 1929 cloudburst, a group of {{mountain}}eers led by Horace Kephart climbed to the crest of the Central Smokies to inspect the damage.

Upon seeing this, Kephart was said to have remarked, [...] "I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>this</b> put on a Government map for you."

The United States Geological Survey gave it the name [...] "Charlie's Bunion" [...] shortly thereafter. The mountain rising above Charlies Bunion to the west was named after Kephart himself.|$|E
