40|$|The central {{purpose of}} this {{proposal}} is to understand the signals that urban students of color believe deter or inspire them to pursue a four-year college education. The urban setting for this proposed study is Denver, Colorado where the <b>Denver</b> <b>Public</b> <b>School</b> (DPS) system has a poor track record related to college access. Almost 80 % of all DPS students are of color and less than 9 % go on to complete a four-year college degree. Therefore, it is imperative we {{gain a better understanding}} of the signals that influence the college aspirations of these students. The study will utilize a signaling theory lens to qualitatively study students of color enrolled in the DPS at three high school sites. The study will develop best practice recommendations for guidance counselors and college enrollment management practitioners which aim to improve access to college for students of color in the DPS system.
