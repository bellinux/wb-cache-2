Lens distortions that arise from the nonlinearity of a lens are the main cause for mismatches in stitching images. We estimate the <b>distortion</b> <b>factors</b> for each image using the Division Model and linearize the projected relationships between matching distorted feature points. Because our method works at the RANSAC stage, the estimated <b>distortion</b> <b>factors</b> are further refined during the bundle adjustment phase and thus accurate <b>distortion</b> <b>factors</b> are obtained. Applications based on estimated lens <b>distortion</b> <b>factors</b> show that our method is more efficient and that the stitched results are more accurate than other previous methods...|$|R

The self-adaptive filter with carrier wave as the filter input signal and mud pressure PSK signal including noise as the filter expected input signal in structure was adopted to process the mud pressure PSK signals with the broadband signal characteristic in communication. Mathematical model of the filter was built to reconstruct the mud pressure PSK signals based on the evaluation criterion of least mean square error (LMS) and the mathematical model of mud pressure PSK signals.
