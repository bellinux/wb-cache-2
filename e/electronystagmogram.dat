40|$|Background: Epileptic {{nystagmus}} is rare. There is no {{report in}} Korea about epileptic nystagmus by the activation of cortical smooth pursuit area. We studied a 29 -year-male patient with nonconvulsive simple partial status epilepticus presenting as pure ictal nystagmus. Methods: The EEG including electrooculogram and <b>electronystagmogram</b> during ictus was done. Brain MRI including 99 mTc-ECD SPECT and 18 F-FDG PET were also done during ictus and repeated after complete relief from symptom. Subtraction images obtained {{from each of}} SPECT and PET were coregistrated onto MRI. Humphrey visual field test was done for documentation of visual field defect. Results: EEG was compatible with nonconvulsive status epilepticus arising from right mesial occipital area with 9 - 10 Hz frequency. Compensatory left beating nystagmus with midline crossing feature was noted and characteristic ipsiversive linear slow phase was presented in <b>electronystagmogram.</b> Brain neuroimages from MRI, 99 mTc-ECD SPECT, and 18 F-FDG PET revealed that the righ...|$|E
40|$|An 82 -year-old male {{suffered}} from prostatic cancer five years ago. Since then, {{he has taken}} flutamide and was bothered with episodic vertigo (EV) every morning. In order to treat prostatic cancer, flutamide was not discontinued, but conservative treatment and life-style change were recommended. Finally, EV actually subsided. Herein, we report the rare case, in which EV was an unexpected side effect of flutamide. Herein we review his whole history, physical examination, vestibular function test, <b>electronystagmogram,</b> caloric test, awake encephalogram, blood examinations, color-coded duplex ultrasonogram and magnetic resonance imaging/angiogram to suggest a mechanism of flutamide responsible for EV...|$|E
40|$|Infants with {{congenital}} deafness caused by severe bilateral inner ear malformations frequently suffer from {{severe hearing loss}} and poor balance. Unfortunately, the use of hearing aids is usually ineffective in recovering hearing, necessitating cochlear implants. We report {{a case of a}} 6 -year-old boy with {{congenital deafness}} and bilateral inner ear malformations (right side, incomplete partition type I [IP-I]; left side, common cavity deformity). Hearing aids had a remarkable effect in this patient, enabling sufficient and favorable hearing recovery such as to allow the patient to engage in daily conversations. Per-rotatory nystagmus was recorded on an <b>electronystagmogram</b> for both right and left rotations in a damped rotational chair test. It is rare for deaf children with severe bilateral inner ear malformation to demonstrate favorable development in hearing and good equilibrium function. Our findings suggest that auditoryâ€“vestibular hair cells in this patient may have been partially preserved despite IP-I in the right ear and common cavity deformity of the left ear...|$|E
40|$|Features and {{significance}} of individual vestibular symptoms for the diagnosis of latent labyrinthitis and limited forms of labyrinthine affections offering considerable difficulties are discussed. Vestibular symptoms are indistinct. In case of the negative fistular symptom the greatest significance is acquired by the study of posture nystagmus according {{to the results of}} <b>electronystagmograms,</b> changes of tonic reactions and statics, as well as data of experimental vestibular tests. The necessity of evaluation of all the vestibular symptoms {{from the point of view}} of their vector characteristics and in a complex of evidence obtained by otoneurological examination of the patient is emphasized. Delicate topic and differential diagnosis of vestibular disturbances is of great importance {{and significance}} in the choice of the conservative or surgical method of treatment...|$|R
40|$|Clinical data on 244 probands with spinocerebellar types, 163 with late {{cortical}} cerebellar atrophies (LCCA), and 180 with olivopontocerebellar atrophies (OPCA) were analysed. Spinocerebellar {{cases were}} divided into three according to their estimated genetic mechanisms: recessive, dominant, or sporadic. Ages of onset were identical in sporadic spinocerebellar types, LCCA, and OPCA, the average being about 50. They showed highly correlated clinical patterns. In the light of other evidence, these diseases may represent a premature aging process in the central nervous system, probably determined multifactorially. Recessive spinocerebellar cases were very few. There were 127 cases of spinocerebellar types with dominant inheritance, characterised by age of onset around 33, colourful ocular signs, and spasticity. A large family with this disease was described in which 34 patients were affected through five generations. The computed tomograms showed an almost normal cerebellum and <b>electronystagmograms</b> indicated patterns of vestibulocular impairment. No necropsied case was available among the present material, but in pathological reports of similar cases, major lesions {{were found in the}} ventral and the dorsal spinocerebellar tracts, Clarke's columns, and the posterior columns in the spinal cord. This disease, or hereditary spastic ataxia, represented a fairly well-defined entity inherited dominantly among a group of cases with spinocerebellar types, and it was separable from LCCA or OPCA, not only on clinical and genetic grounds, but by a predominantly spinal involvement...|$|R
