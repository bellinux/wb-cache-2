40|$|Abstract Background Non-invasive {{screening}} {{investigations are}} rarely used {{for assessing the}} activation and progression of the hypothalamic-pituitary gonadal axis through puberty. This study aimed to establish a normal range for <b>urinary</b> <b>gonadotrophins</b> in children progressing through puberty. Methods Urine samples were collected from 161 healthy school children (76 boys, 85 girls) aged 4 â€“ 19 [*]yrs. Height and weight were converted to standard deviation score. Pubertal status, classified by Tanner staging, was determined by self-assessment. <b>Urinary</b> <b>gonadotrophins</b> were measured by chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay. Results were grouped according to pubertal status (pre-pubertal or pubertal). Results Of the 161 children, 50 were pre-pubertal (28 boys; 22 girls) and 111 were pubertal (48 boys; 63 girls). Overall, <b>urinary</b> <b>gonadotrophins</b> concentrations increased with pubertal maturation. All pre-pubertal children had a low urinary LH:Creatinine ratio. LH:Creatinine ratios were significantly higher in pubertal compared to pre-pubertal boys (p p [*]=[*] 0. 006). However, LH:FSH ratios were a more consistent discriminant between pre-pubertal and pubertal states in both sexes (Boys 0. 45 pubertal vs 0. 1 pre-pubertal; girls 0. 23 pubertal vs 0. 06 pre-pubertal). Conclusion <b>Urinary</b> <b>gonadotrophins</b> analyses {{could be used as}} non-invasive integrated measurement of pubertal status which reflects clinical/physical status. </p...|$|R
40|$|Infertility {{problems}} {{are present in}} 10 to 15 % of couples of fertile age. Ovulatory dysfunction, as a single cause, can be successfully treated and in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) can help {{a considerable number of}} couples, also when male {{problems are}} present. Gonadotrophins, consisting of mixed hormones of variable molecular composition, are used in different ways in this connection for ovarian stimulation. The aims of the thesis were to i) evaluate whether the composition of available drugs could explain varying ovarian response, ii) compare pharmaco-kinetic and -dynamic properties of the drugs used, iii) study the ovarian response to highly purified follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) in the absence of luteinizing hormone (LH), iv) compare the efficacy of purified urinary FSH (FSH-HP) and <b>urinary</b> <b>menopausal</b> <b>gonadotrophin</b> (hMG) preparation and v-vi) to compare two recombinant FSH preparations, in terms of ovarian stimulatory effects, pregnancy and delivery rates. Marketed urinary preparations were analysed by isoelectric focusing, and by bio- and immuno-assays for FSH and LE Stimulatory effects and elimination rates were compared in crossover studies. Recombinant FSH (rhFSH) stimulatory effects were studied in gonadotrophin-deficient women. In a clinical comparative crossover study the stimulatory effects of FSH-HP and hMG were assessed. Two rhFSH preparations were compared clinically, with regard to their efficiency in ovarian stimulation as well as to pregnancy rates. This study was further extended to a comparison of delivery rates after IVF. Conclusions: The <b>urinary</b> <b>gonadotrophin</b> preparations examined are dissimilar in terms of heterogeneity of their FSH and LH molecular constituents and FSH- and LH-potencies. Different methods of preparation might be responsible for these differences. However, the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties are not influenced by the heterogeneities observed. Repeated injections result in an accumulation of FSH in plasma, due to its long circulating half-life. The concept of an optimal FSH/LH ratio is not supported by the results obtained. Recombinant FSH exhibits no LH-effect. It can stimulate normal inhibin production, normal granulosa cell function, and growth of ovarian follicles in the absence of estrogens. FSH-HP is as effective as hMG for use in IVF; however lower estradiol levels can be expected in treatment cycles, when highly purified FSH preparations are used; this should be taken into consideration when the day of ovum retrieval is based on circulating oestrogen levels. Available rhFSH preparations are equally suitable and effective, when used in IVF...|$|R

Follitropin alpha {{can be used for}} controlled ovarian hyperstimulation in assisted reproduction, ovulation induction for WHO group I and II anovulatory infertility and in men with hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism (HH) or idiopathic oligo-asthenospermia. Current evidence suggests superiority of <b>urinary</b> <b>human</b> <b>menopausal</b> gonadotropin (HMG) over follitropin alpha in controlled ovarian hyperstimulation for IVF in terms of live birth rate per couple. Addition of lutropin to follitropin alpha in an unselected IVF population does not appear to confer any benefit; however, it may have a role in ovulation induction in women with hypothalamic hypogonadism. Urinary HMG preparations (especially currently available highly purified preparations) are more cost effective than rFSH in terms of cost per ongoing pregnancy. However, women using rFSH injection pen devices have higher levels of satisfaction as compared to those using urinary HMG by means of conventional syringes.

First, the pharmacokinetic properties of human <b>urinary</b> <b>gonadotrophins</b> were analysed with immunological and biological methods, both during bolus i. m. injections and during pulsatile s. c. administration. Second, a prospective randomized controlled study was performed in 75 patients undergoing IVF/embryo transfer in whom the effects of pulsatile s. c. administration were compared {{with the effects of}} single daily bolus i. m. injections of the same gonadotrophin preparation. The results showed that neither method of gonadotrophin administration induced measurable changes in the serum concentration of luteinizing hormone (LH). Both oestradiol and andro-stenedione concentrations were slightly lower during pulsatile s. c. gonadotrophin administration, suggesting that this method of gonadotrophin administration results in less LH occupying the ovarian LH receptors. Pulsatile s. c. gonadotrophin administration resembles a continuous infusion of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). Significant fluctuations in the serum concentrations of FSH were observed during single daily bolus i. m. administration of human <b>urinary</b> <b>gonadotrophins,</b> but the pregnancy rate of IVF/embryo transfer per cycle after pulsatile s. c. administration was not significantly better than after the daily bolus i. m. injection of gonadotrophins (42. 1 versus 37. 2 %).

40|$|Background Several {{systematic}} reviews compared recombinant <b>gonadotrophin</b> with <b>urinary</b> <b>gonadotrophins</b> (HMG, purified FSH, highly purified FSH) for ovarian hyperstimulation in IVF and ICSI {{cycles and}} these reported conflicting results. Each of these reviews used different inclusion and exclusion criteria for trials. Our aim in producing this review {{is to bring}} together all randomised studies in this field under common inclusion criteria with consistent and valid statistical methods. Objectives To compare the effectiveness of recombinant gonadotrophin (rFSH) with the three main types of <b>urinary</b> <b>gonadotrophins</b> (i. e. HMG, FSH-P and FSH-HP) for ovarian stimulation in women undergoing IVF or ICSI treatment cycles. Search strategy An extended search was done according to Cochrane guidelines including the Menstrual Disorders & Subfertility Group's Specialised Register of controlled trials, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE (1966 to May 2010), EMBASE (1980 to May 2010), CINAHL (1982 to May 2010), National Research Register, and Current Controlled Trials. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials reporting data comparing clinical outcomes for women undergoing IVF/ICSI cycles and using recombinant FSH in comparison with HMG or highly purified HMG, purified urinary FSH (FSH-P), and highly purified urinary FSH (FSH-HP) for ovarian hyperstimulation in IVF or ICSI cycles were included. Data collection and analysis Primary outcome measure was live birth rate and OHSS per randomised woman. Binary outcomes were analysed using odds ratios and also reported in absolute terms. Grouped analyses were carried out for all outcomes to explore whether relative effects differed due to key features of the trials. Main results We included 42 trials {{with a total of}} 9606 couples. Comparing rFSH to any of the other gonadotrophins irrespective of the down-regulation protocol used, did not result in any evidence of a statistically significant difference in live birth rate (28 trials, 7339 couples, odds ratio 0. 97, 95 % CI 0. 87 to 1. 08). This suggests that for a group with a 25 % live birth rate using <b>urinary</b> <b>gonadotrophins</b> the rate would be between 22. 5 % and 26. 5 % using rFSH. There was also no evidence of a difference in the OHSS rate (32 trials, 7740 couples, OR 1. 18, 95 % CI 0. 86 to 1. 61). This means that for a group with 2 % risk of OHSS using <b>urinary</b> <b>gonadotrophins,</b> the risk would be between 1. 7 % and 3. 2 % using rFSH.

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Human</b> <b>menopausal</b> gonadotrophins and {{recombinant}} human {{follicle stimulating hormone}} are the two main gonadotrophin products utilized for controlled ovarian stimulation in assisted reproductive technologies. In this meta-analysis, the number of oocytes was designated as the most relevant endpoint directly resulting from ovarian stimulation, and therefore where the drug effect may be estimated with the best sensitivity. Methods All published randomized controlled trials on ovarian stimulation comparing the two gonadotrophin products were evaluated. Internal validity was determined using Chalmers' validated scale. If trials {{did not meet the}} established quality criteria, a sensitivity analysis assessed the stability of the results. The comparison of continuous variables was conducted following the weighted mean difference and the standardized mean difference (Cohen's effect size) with the random model. Given the known relationship of baseline conditions on treatment endpoints, results were adjusted for age, body mass index and type of infertility. Results Sixteen studies involving 4040 patients were included. Treatment with <b>human</b> <b>menopausal</b> gonadotrophins resulted in fewer oocytes (- 1. 54; 95 % CI: - 2. 53 to - 0. 56; P Conclusions Because baseline conditions are predictive of outcome, meta-analytic results are more sensitive when these variables are considered. Using an endpoint closely associated with the stimulation period, sufficient sensitivity is achieved to compare gonadotrophin treatments.

As various endocrine function studies, urinary total 17 -KS and its fractions, urinary 17 -OHCS, urinary estrogens and their fractions, and <b>urinary</b> <b>gonadotrophin</b> were determ ined. The impressive results in patients with impotence due to diabetes mellitus were marked decreases in III, IV and V fractions of 17 -KS and lowered <b>urinary</b> <b>gonadotrophin.</b> A part of patients was performed gonadotrophin test and semi n al vesicle absorption studies as the functional evaluation of the sexual glands. Histological examinations of the testicle obtain e d by biopsy performed in 18 patients showed atrophic pictures in 14 cases (77. 8 %).

40|$|Anovulation is {{a common}} cause of female infertility. Treatment for women with {{anovulation}} is aimed at induction of ovulation. Ovulation induction with follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) is indicated in women with WHO type II anovulation in whom treatment with clomifene citrate (clomifene) has failed. The majority of these women have polycystic ovary syndrome. The major disadvantages of ovulation induction with FSH are the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome {{and the risk of}} higher order multiple pregnancies. To reduce the rate of complications due to multiple follicular development, FSH should be administered using a chronic low-dose protocol with small dose increments. In women with WHO type I anovulation, an exogenous supply of luteinizing hormone (LH) is required to achieve an adequate follicular response to FSH treatment. Thus, ovulation induction with FSH is not the treatment of choice in these women. FSH is a hormone that stimulates follicle growth and oocyte maturation. Endogenous FSH is produced by the pituitary gland and exists as a family of isohormones exhibiting distinct oligosaccharide structures. FSH for exogenous administration is derived from urine or is produced as recombinant FSH. The commercially available FSH products all contain different mixtures of FSH isoforms. To determine the effectiveness of urofollitropin (urinary-derived FSH), a comparison with the other available gonadotropins was made (i. e. recombinant FSH and <b>human</b> <b>menopausal</b> gonadotropin). Urofollitropin and recombinant FSH appear to be equally effective and well tolerated for ovulation induction. <b>Human</b> <b>menopausal</b> gonadotropin is comparably effective to urofollitropin in terms of pregnancy outcomes.

MEASUREMENTS and main results [...] Support with human chorionic gonadotrophin did not significantly alter the progesterone or oestradiol concentrations in the early or mid-luteal phase. The mean (range) progesterone concentrations in the late luteal phase in women who did not become pregnant were, however, significantly higher in those who received support (16 (9 - 110) nmol/l nu 8 (4 - 46) nmol/l), and the luteal phase was significantly longer in this group (14 days nu 12 days). The rate of pregnancy was significantly higher in the women who received support than in those who did not (25 / 61 nu 8 / 54). CONCLUSIONS [...] When buserelin and <b>human</b> <b>menopausal</b> gonadotrophin are used to hyperstimulate ovaries support with human chorionic gonadotrophin in the luteal phase has a beneficial effect on in vitro fertilisation...|$|R
40|$|In 20 {{anovulatory}} {{patients who}} were normoprolactinaemic, 12 developed transient hyperprolactinaemia when they were treated with <b>human</b> <b>menopausal</b> gonadotropin (hMG) for induction of ovulation. The hyperprolactinaemia was {{probably due to the}} increased oestrogen production effect on some susceptible patients. The pregnancy rate was found to be lower in those who developed this condition. The dosage of hMG required was found to be significantly higher in this group. The importance of recognizing this transient hyperprolactinaemia and probably the role of Bromocriptine are discussed. Further study is suggested. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Background: Clomiphene citrate {{is one of}} the {{effective}} drugs for infertility treatment due to oligo-ovulation or anovulation. Intrauterine insemination (IUI) is one of more adherent methods for treatment of infertile cases which is followed by controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH). Objective: the aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate Clomiphene citrate versus letrozole with gonadotropins in IUI cycles. Materials and Methods: In this prospective randomized trial, 180 infertile women who were referred to Milad Hospital were selected. The first group received 5 mg/day letrozole on day 3 - 7 of menstrual cycle. The second group received 100 mg/day Clomiphene in the same way as letrozole. In both groups, <b>human</b> <b>menopausal</b> gonadotropin was administered every day starting on day between 6 - 8 of cycle. Ovulation was triggered with urinary Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (5000 IU) when have two follicles of â‰¥ 16 mm. IUI was performed 36 hr later. Results: The number of matured follicles, cycle cancellation, and abortion were the same in both groups. Endometrial thickness was higher at the time of <b>human</b> <b>menopausal</b> gonadotropin administration in letrozole group. Chemical and clinical pregnancy rates were much higher in letrozole group. Ovarian hyperstimulation was significantly higher in clomiphene group. Conclusion: Letrozole appears to be a good alternative to clomiphene citrate with fewer side effects...|$|R
40|$|Great {{progress}} has been achieved during the last 20 years {{in the field of}} ovulation induction in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Clomiphene citrate remains the first line of treatment for all anovulatory women with PCOS, since in properly selected patients the cumulative pregnancy rate approaches that in normal women, Human <b>urinary</b> <b>gonadotrophins</b> have been used extensively for ovulation induction, but the development of low-dose regimens has opened a new era in the management of anovulation related to PCOS, This article discusses the main advantages and disadvantages of the principal methods and regimens currently used for ovulation induction in patients with PCOS including clomiphene citrate, gonadotrophins, pulsatile gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and GnRB agonists, It also discusses new drugs discovered recently, particularly recombinant gonadotrophins and GnRH antagonists, and provides some thoughts regarding their use in future protocols, Finally, based on the discovery of new ovarian substances which specifically control luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion, this article develops assumptions on possible implications of these substances in the pathophysiology of PCOS and their potential use in the management of the syndrome...|$|R
40|$|<b>Urinary</b> <b>gonadotrophins</b> from post-menopausal {{patients}} were tested by two methods of bioassay. Measured by {{the response of}} the mouse uterus, the daily excretion of total gonadotrophin in the less severely disabled patients ranged from 10 to 200 mg. equivalents of HMG 20 A. Patients with active rheumatoid arthritis showed similar levels but some patients with severe disability due to anorexia, reticulosis or anaemia excreted very little gonadotrophin. The gonadotrophins were also measured in terms of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) using the ovarian response in mice treated with excess human chorionic gonadotrophin. It was found that they differed strikingly from HMG 20 A in being relatively more potent in the assay for FSH. This suggests that they contained relatively more FSH. The day-to-day fluctuation in the excretion of total gonadotrophin was compared with the differences between duplicate estimations. There were considerable quantitative fluctuations which could not be explained by the experimental errors. There was little evidence of major fluctuation in the quality of the gonadotrophins when this was assessed in a similar way...|$|R
40|$|There is {{evidence}} that when preparations of gonadotrophic hormone are injected intravenously they disappear from the blood stream fairly rapidly. The fate of the gonadotrophin varies, however, with {{the source of the}} prep-aration. Thus Lipschutz and Vivaldi (1) found that when urinary gonado [...] trophin was injected intravenously into rabbits, 80 per cent of the active material disappeared from the blood stream in 6 to 8 hours. Parkes and White (2) found that of <b>urinary</b> <b>gonadotrophin</b> injected intravenously was excreted in the urine in about 9 hours. On the other hand mare serum preparations are not excreted by the kidneys and they disappear from the blood stream more slowly. Catchpole and his co-workers (3) found that when such preparations were administered intravenously into rabbits, the quantity of active principle in the blood was decreased to half in 20 hours; in the gelding the decrease to half activity occurred even more slowly, viz., in about 6 days.
