40|$|The {{sugar cane}} {{industry}} uses brake vans, coupled {{to the end}} of cane trains, to produce a given constant braking force to improve the cane bin ride dynamics and to assist the braking of trains. Unlike other railway vehicles, cane bins often have neither brakes or suspensions. Currently brake vans operate using compressed air, supplied by an on board compressor, which activates a brake calliper, which clamps a ventilated disc rotor on each of the four wheel sets. This system needs maintenance due to wear on the brake pads and rotors. An <b>electrical</b> <b>braking</b> implemented using self-excited induction generator is proposed.

5000|$|Brake {{refers to}} the device which was used to load an engine and hold it at a desired {{rotational}} speed.

40|$|Inhalable {{airborne}} particles have inverse health affect. In railways, mechanical brakes, the wheel–rail contact, current collectors, ballast, sleepers, and masonry structures yield particulate matter. Field tests examined a Swedish track using a train instrumented with particle measurement devices, brake pad temperature sensors, and speed and brake sensors. The main {{objective of this}} field test was to study the characteristics of particles generated from disc brakes on a running train with an on-board measuring set-up. Two airborne particle sampling points were designated, one near a pad–rotor disc brake contact and a second under the frame, not near a mechanical brake or the wheel–rail contact; the numbers and size distributions of the particles detected were registered and evaluated under various conditions (e. g. activating/deactivating <b>electrical</b> <b>brakes</b> or negotiating curves). During braking, three speed/temperature-dependent particle peaks were identified in the fine region, representing particles 280 nm, 350 nm, and 600 nm in diameter. In the coarse region, a peak was discerned for particles 3 – 6 μm in diameter. Effects of brake pad temperature on particle size distribution were also investigated. Results indicate that the 280 nm peak increased with increasing temperature, and that <b>electrical</b> <b>braking</b> significantly reduced airborne particle numbers. FESEM images captured particles sizing down to 50 nm. The ICP-MS results indicated that Fe, Cu, Zn, Al, Ca, and Mg were the main elements constituting the particles.   QC 20120226.

50|$|The SWS {{characteristics}} were deeply analysed during {{and at the}} end of the testing period, when it had done 80 000 km. In the point of view of the driver, the performance is good and partly better than with a diesel bus. The only additional effort compared to a diesel bus comes from minding of the poles. The <b>electrical</b> <b>braking</b> system is efficient, and therefore the lifetime of the service brakes is longer. The drive motor at the rear axle is excessively noisy due to vibrations; the same issue concerns on the diesel engine. The heating system and main inverter cooling would need a further development. While the diesel generator ensured the power supply, the extra weight was seen as a drawback. The old and worn cables above the streets caused problems during service.|$|R
