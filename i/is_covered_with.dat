40|$|Four {{patients}} with five wounds {{were randomly assigned}} to treatment with three occlusive dressings: DuoDERM, Restore and Comfeel Ulcus; the dressings were left intact for 24 - 48 h. When the dressings were removed, it was found that wounds that had <b>been</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> Restore and Comfeel contained coagulated sanguinous material. Two wounds that had <b>been</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> Comfeel and Restore, respectively, <b>were</b> then <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> DuoDERM, while one wound previously <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> DuoDERM <b>was</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> Restore. Either no clotting occurred under DuoDERM or clots may have resolved.

The {{rough endoplasmic reticulum}} is so named because the cytoplasmic surface <b>is</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> ribosomes, giving it a bumpy appearance when viewed through an electron microscope. The smooth ER appears smooth since its cytoplasmic surface lacks ribosomes.|$|E
