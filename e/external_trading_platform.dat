40|$|Comportamentally, the <b>external</b> <b>trade</b> {{balance is}} {{determined}} by the state of the national economy, external factors and by the evolution of the currencies in which the trade is done. The evolution of the <b>external</b> <b>trade</b> balance is the mirror of the external imbalance recorded by Romania in the period between 1990 - 2009. That’s why, an analysis in which is needed to discover the sources that cause the trade deficit, is not only opportune, but also imperative, because the existence of the trade deficit determines the amassment of external debt, which subdues Romania to numerous efforts in order to pay back the debt and the interest. The present paper analysis the evolution of the Romanian <b>external</b> <b>trade</b> balance with its elements, from 1990 till the end of 2009, in order to find out its essential characteristics and what are the sources for the trade deficit of this country, by emphasizing on the continuity and discontinuity factors from the evolution of the <b>external</b> <b>trade</b> balance, and also the resources for financing the deficit. The paper points out the characteristics of the <b>external</b> <b>trade</b> balance evolution, and the measure by which the currency evolution had an influence. The analysis offers these conclusions: Romania needs urgent measures to attract foreign direct investments to balance the <b>external</b> <b>trade</b> deficit, and needs to assess thoroughly the means by which it finance its deficit; the authorities should focus with the utmost responsibility the idea of a sustainable <b>external</b> <b>trade</b> balance, and to adopt the necessary decisions, because the continuous deficit will put in peril the durability of any economic growth and the deflation process. <b>external</b> <b>trade</b> balance, current account, sold, deficit...|$|R

40|$|The {{vehicular}} participatory sensing network (VPSN) is {{now becoming}} more and more prevalent, and additionally has shown its great potential in various applications. A general VPSN consists of many tasks from task, publishers, <b>trading</b> <b>platforms</b> and a crowd of participants. Some literature treats publishers and the <b>trading</b> <b>platform</b> as a whole, which is impractical since they are two independent economic entities with respective purposes. For a <b>trading</b> <b>platform</b> in markets, its purpose is to maximize the profit by selecting tasks and recruiting participants who satisfy the requirements of accepted tasks, rather than {{to improve the quality of}} each task. This scheduling problem for a <b>trading</b> <b>platform</b> consists of two parts: which tasks should be selected and which participants to be recruited? In this paper, we investigate the scheduling problem in vehicular participatory sensing with the predictable mobility of each vehicle. A genetic-based trading scheduling algorithm (GTSA) is proposed to solve the scheduling problem. Experiments with a realistic dataset of taxi trajectories demonstrate that GTSA algorithm is efficient for <b>trading</b> <b>platforms</b> to gain considerable profit in VPSN...|$|R
