40|$|A {{two year}} {{experiment}} demonstrated electrical energy savings through evaporator <b>fan</b> <b>cycling</b> {{in part of}} a full-sized refrigerated controlled atmosphere apple storage facility in Yakima, Washington. Room cooling demand and evaporator fan operation was controlled by the bulk fruit temperature. Refrigerant temperature was regulated by a computer controlled ramping sequence and a weighted average of three thermistors rather than a room thermostat. Evaporator fans remained off 60 - 65 % of the time during periods of <b>fan</b> <b>cycling</b> operation. Seasonal average fan energy savings approached 50 - 55 % when the product remained in storage for a typical length of time. Room environment conditions, product mass loss, and fruit quality were not compromised. Bulk fruit temperature was exceptionally stable as compared to fruit stored in non-fan cycled rooms controlled by traditional means. Less fan motor heat input in the fruit storage space also results in compressor energy savings. Total electrical energy savings were projected to an 18 room fruit storage facility implementing computer controlled evaporator <b>fan</b> <b>cycling.</b> Projected electrical energy savings achievable through evaporator <b>fan</b> <b>cycling</b> {{for the state of}} Washington were made based on reported apple storage capacity...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1988 Increased {{consumer}} demand for fresh fruit {{throughout the year}} has created a need for long term storage. Long term storage of fruit uses more energy than fresh market products, thus increasing production cost. Pacific Northwest energy costs and more competition for markets has made energy conservation an important factor to be considered by the fruit industry. A BASICA computer program, RLSIM, was developed to predict the transient refrigeration load throughout the storage season in apple and pear cold storage warehouses. RLSIM accurately predicted the seasonal and component refrigeration system energy demand curves during the 1985 - 1986 cold storage season. The results also indicated that the largest single energy use component is the continuous operation of evaporator fans. Simulation of a six hours on and six hours off <b>fan</b> <b>cycling</b> technique indicated a reduction of 23. 75 percent could be achieved in overall refrigeration system energy use in the cold storage warehouse. Cold storage warehouse management can be improved by using the results of RLSIM. <b>Fan</b> <b>cycling</b> schemes could be properly employed without risk of increasing fruit temperature. Recommendations were made to update research in areas of cooling and respiration rates of various fruits in both controlled atmosphere and common storage...|$|E

Energy saving schemes were explored in terms of temperature fluctuations and energy use. In this paper, the implementation of fluctuating cooling air temperature at constant air exchange rate, 8 h at 0. 6 °C and 16 h at 1. 2 °C, according to a day-night regime, was examined experimentally and by use of a porous medium CFD model of an apple fruit cool store. With the model, different evaporator coil <b>fan</b> <b>cycling</b> schemes, including 12 hours on - 12 hours off; 10 hours on - 14 hours off; and 8 hours on - 16 hours off were then investigated.

40|$|The {{performance}} of dual evaporator household refrigerators was studied experimentally and by numerical simulation. This study considers only serial connection where the refrigerant {{flows through the}} fresh food evaporator and then through the freezer evaporator without a pressure drop between the evaporators. The prototype tested had insufficient compressor power and a higher cabinet thermal conductance than designed. In addition, the exit of the freezer evaporator was always two-phase affecting compressor performance. However, control of the fresh food cabinet air temperature was achieved through turning the fan off and on during operation. This <b>fan</b> <b>cycling</b> affected both the {{performance of}} the prototype and the charge distribution inside the system. The data from the tests was used to check the accuracy of a numerical model of dual evaporator refrigerators. It was shown that the accuracy of the model could be improved through various adjustments. However, uncertainty about the compressor performance limited the accuracy to between 10 and 20 percent. This model was then used to simulate {{the performance of the}} refrigerator as originally designed and with larger and smaller evaporators. In general, charge requirements increased with evaporator size as did the system???s sensitivity to ambient temperature. Increasing the fresh food evaporator size did not significantly increase COP but did increase capacity...|$|E

40|$|Systems {{based on}} the vapor {{compression}} cycle are {{the most widely used}} in a variety of air conditioning applications. Despite the vast growth of modern control systems in the field of air conditioning systems, industry standard control is still thermostat based on-off control, in other words cycle control. This thesis proposes an approach to find the optimal profiles for the expansion valve and the evaporator fan for an air conditioning system for a given period of on-off cycle of the compressor. The research will consist of two phases, the development of a simulation model and an experimental analysis. In this thesis, the profiles for the expansion valve and the evaporator fan are parameterized by an S-curve equation so that the optimization problem will have less numbers of parameters. The first step is a simulation model that predicts startup/shutdown characteristics. This model is used as a tool to understand the effect that the S-curve parameters has on the system cycle efficiency. Several key vapor compression system dynamics are identified as causes for increasing/decreasing system's cyclic efficiency. Refrigerant migration and fan delay at shutdown are determined as crucial issues that {{have an effect on the}} A direct search optimization algorithm, namely the simplex search algorithm, is then used to search for the optimal S-curve parameters. Valve/fan strategies that ultimately resulted in a better superheat control are assessed as the most energy efficient. Extensive experimental tests conducted on a 3 -ton residential air conditioner are then presented to intuitively understand the effect of expansion valve and evaporator <b>fan</b> <b>cycling</b> in a real system. A real time optimization method is explored and the feasibility, recommendations for a successful online method are proposed. The heuristics for the expansion valve and evaporator fan profiles from the optimization results could be easily hard coded into any commercial air conditioning system to perform the much preferred cycle control. Thus a significant improvement in the energy performance was observed without the use of any advanced control techniques...|$|E
