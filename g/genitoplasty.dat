40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} the anatomical and cosmetic results of feminizing <b>genitoplasty</b> in girls with ambiguous genitalia due to Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH). CASUISTIC AND METHOD: Twenty-seven females with genital ambiguity (Prader III-V) due to CAH underwent an one-stage feminizing <b>genitoplasty</b> and were followed for a mean time of 4 years. In twelve girls, two cutaneous labioscrotal island-flaps {{were associated with}} the conventional <b>genitoplasty,</b> to decrease the excess of labia majora and to enlarge the vaginal introitus. Urinary tract infections were observed in sixteen girls in the preoperative and in only seven in the postoperative period.

RESULTS: The results of clitoroplasty were considered good in 63 % of the cases; however, 4 girls developed clitoral atrophy. An excess of labia majora was present in 25 % and persistence of the urogenital sinus occurred in 11 % (three children without labioscrotal island flap). The labioscrotal island flap was considered technically feasible and reproducible. Five girls had to be re-operated. The cosmetic results were considered excellent or good in 63 % of the cases, satisfactory in 18. 5 % and unsatisfactory or bad in 18. 5 %.

40|$|Aim: To {{evaluate}} the clinical profile {{and management of}} 46 XX Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH) patients presenting with severe virilization and assigned a male gender. Materials and Methods: Of 173 children diagnosed with CAH at the Pediatric Intersex Clinic since 1980, seven children with CAH presented late with severe virilization and were reared as males. All of them were assigned the male sex with removal of the female adnexa. Six were treated with male <b>genitoplasty.</b> Appropriate hormonal supplementation was offered after puberty. Results: The mean age at presentation was 14. 2 years (7 - 21). Six patients had presented after puberty, only one at seven years of age. Staged male <b>genitoplasty</b> comprising of chordee correction, male urethroplasty, and bilateral testicular prosthesis was performed. The female adnexa (uterus, ovaries, most of the upper vagina, and the fallopian tubes) were removed. The mental makeup was masculine in six and bigender in one. Bilateral mastectomy was performed at puberty in all. Hormonal treatment comprised of glucocorticoids and testosterone. Six patients were comfortable with {{the outcome of the}} masculinizing <b>genitoplasty.</b> One had a short-sized phallus. One had repeated attacks of urinary tract infection arising from the retained lower vaginal pouch. Social adjustments were good in all, except in one who had a bigender mental makeup.

40|$|The ideal {{surgical}} technique and appropriate age for performing feminizing <b>genitoplasty</b> are debatable, and few long-term outcome {{studies have been}} reported. PURPOSE: To report a retrospective study on anatomical and functional outcomes of feminizing <b>genitoplasty</b> in patients with virilizing congenital adrenal hyperplasia. METHODS: We selected 34 patients (mean age = 3. 4 ± 2. 5 yr) with genital ambiguity classified according to Prader stage. Follow-up ranged from 2 to 16 years. Clitoral length ranged from 1. 9 to 5. 0 cm; 28 patients had a single perineal orifice, and 6 had a double orifice. The {{surgical technique}} included clitorovaginoplasty in a single procedure and was carried out before 2 years of age in 18 patients. Clitoroplasty was performed with glans preservation in all patients. Blood supply was exclusively maintained by the frenular pedicle in 97 % of the cases, whereas clitoral dorsal nerves and vessels were preserved in the remaining 3 %. The opening of the urogenital sinus was performed using either the Y-V perineal flap procedure (25 patients) or the cut-back incision procedure (8 patients). RESULTS: Good morphological and functional results were achieved in 68 % of the patients; 21 % of the patients had surgical complications, such as incision bleeding (2 cases), glans necrosis (1 girl with Prader V), and vaginal introitus stenosis (4 cases). Three of the latter underwent dilation with acrylic molds in the post-pubertal period with good functional results. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that single-stage feminizing <b>genitoplasty</b> consisting of vulvoplasty, clitoroplasty, and Y-V perineal flap produced good cosmetic and functional results in virilized girls with congenital adrenal hyperplasia, with few complications. In addition, this surgical approach prevented the need for neovaginaplasty even in patients with high vaginal insertion...|$|E
40|$|Aim. To {{evaluate}} {{surgical procedures}} adopted for male <b>genitoplasty</b> in intersex disorders. Patients and Methods. Case records of intersex patients undergoing male <b>genitoplasty</b> from Pediatric Intersex clinic were studied. Results. Of 356 intersex cases undergoing urethroplasty from 1989 – 2007, the hypospadias was penoscrotal (68 %), scrotal (17 %) and perineal (15 %). 351 patients underwent chordee correction for mild: moderate: severe chordee in 24 : 136 : 191 cases. Byars flaps were fixed upto the corona in 267 cases. Urethroplasty performed was Theirsch duplay in 335 cases, Snodgrass in 16 cases and Ducketts onlay graft in 5 cases {{that did not}} require chordee correction. Age at urethroplasty was 2. 5 years— 22 years (mean 11. 5 years, median— 5. 6 years). Penoscrotal transposition correction and testicular prosthesis insertion were performed independently. Complications included fistula (45), recurrent fistula (11), stricture (12), baggy urethra (8) and recurrent infection due to persistent vaginal pouch (5). Additional distal urethroplasty was required in 15 patients for previous urethroplasty done upto the corona 5 – 15 years earlier. Conclusion. Hypospadias in intersex disorders is associated with severe chordee in most cases and requires an early chordee correction to allow phallic growth, staged urethroplasty and multiple surgeries to achieve good cosmetic and functional results...|$|E

40|$|America advocates feminising genital {{surgery for}} all {{children}} with ambiguous genitalia assigned to a fe-male sex of rearing 4, 5. A standard infant feminising <b>genitoplasty</b> involves removal {{of some of the}} clitoris to reduce its size, construction of a vagina or opening the vaginal introitus and sometimes refashioning of the labia. In some European centres removal of the whole clitoris (clitorectomy) is still the procedure of choice for the enlarged clitoris 6. Proponents of femi-nising <b>genitoplasty</b> in infancy cite both psychological reasons such as stable gender identity development and a better psychosexual and psychosocial outcome as well as physical reasons such as menstruation and sexual intercourse in later life. It is important for cli-nicians to know whether all or any of these outcomes are achieved and this information can only be obtained by well designed long-term follow-up studies. Available Data Unfortunately, there are few available objective, long-term outcome data from representative groups of intersex adults.
