Selma later wrote, [...] "Because I lost my mother very early and therefore had a rather difficult youth, a strong need grew in me to give people that which <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>missed</b> so much: mother-love and love of human beings. Therefore I chose the profession of nursing".|$|E
500|$|Hill {{attended}} {{his first}} boat drag racing event in 1974 at Austin, Texas. He thought the drivers were [...] "crazy" [...] after {{he saw a}} driver being thrown from his boat during a crash. Less than a month later, Hill had stopped motorcycle racing to drag race boats, despite {{not being able to}} swim. [...] "Once I hit the water with the boat, I never went back to motorcycles," [...] Hill recalled. [...] "The power, speed, and acceleration were all things that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>missed</b> since I quit drag racing." [...] He began racing in a non-blown hydroplane, winning in his first event. In his third race he set the class top speed. In 1975, he set the Southern Drag Boat Association (SDBA) speed record at [...] In 1976, he switched to nitromethane fuel and set the SDBA record with a [...] run. He was the SDBA top pointgetter and won the National Drag Boat Association (NDBA) World Fuel & Gas championship. He repeated as champion in both series in 1977, setting the NDBA record with a [...] run.|$|E
60|$|I waited patiently. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>missed</b> my beauty-sleep, and my feet {{had frozen}} hard, but I was past regrets.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Sir Kitchen-knave, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>missed</b> {{the only}} way [...] Where Arthur's men are set along the wood; [...] The wood is nigh as full of thieves as leaves: [...] If both be slain, I am rid of thee; but yet, [...] Sir Scullion, canst thou use that spit of thine? [...] Fight, an thou canst: <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>missed</b> {{the only way}}.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is nonsense. Something must <b>have</b> happened. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>missed</b> you so long, but was {{determined}} to find you. Have you a headache?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Louis was half-way {{home when}} he exclaimed, 'There! <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>missed</b> Tom Madison a second time. When shall I ever {{remember}} him at the right time?' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>missed</b> my only {{opportunity}} of seeing my nameless patient again. He {{had been gone}} nearly an hour when I inquired for him.|$|E
6000|$|... 'No {{honest man}} of {{principle}} and {{education can be}} utterly useless; but when, three days ago, I recollected {{that it was my}} sixtieth birthday, I looked back, and saw nothing but desultory broken efforts, and restless changes. Your father told me, when I thought him unaware of the meaning of his words, that if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>missed</b> many joys, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>missed</b> many sorrows; but I had taken the way to make my one sorrow a greater burden than his many.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Francisco," [...] said Leonard, as {{he rolled}} {{himself up in}} his blanket, [...] "you had a narrow escape to-night. If <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>missed</b> my hold!" ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{following}} morning Ralph {{went down to}} the beach. [...] "Why, Master Conway," [...] an old fisherman said, [...] "you are a downright stranger. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>missed</b> you rarely." ...|$|R
6000|$|COADE. My muffler; <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>missed</b> it. (It is however to his {{forehead}} that his hand goes. Immediately thereafter he misses his sylvan attire.) Why ... why ... what ... who ... how is this? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come {{to think}} of it, <b>I</b> believe <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>missed</b> Betty," [...] said Col. Zane, gravely. [...] "She seems more quiet. Is she unhappy? When did you first see this change?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was afraid}} <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>missed</b> you, Horrocks," [...] {{said the man}} at the window, {{gripping}} the window-ledge with his hand. His voice was unsteady.|$|E
6000|$|I learnt <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>missed,</b> by rash unheed, [...] My track; that, so the Will decided, [...] In life, death, {{we should}} be divided, And at the sense I ached indeed.|$|E
6000|$|Thereupon I seized my {{opportunity}} and reminded all present how Copple had called out: [...] "Turkey number one! Turkey number two!" [...] the day <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>missed</b> so many. Then I said: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your wine is too good, and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> slept so {{well that}} it seems <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>missed</b> the steamer. Well, there are other means of transit, and, {{if it is not}} too late, you and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{business}} to talk about." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Last day or two?" [...] he {{repeated}} reflectively. [...] "No, I can't say that <b>I</b> <b>have,</b> <b>Miss</b> Abbeway. <b>I</b> needn't {{remind you that}} we don't risk communications except when they are necessary." ...|$|R
6000|$|It was {{as clear}} as day. How could <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>missed</b> it before? There it seemed to stand out almost legible on the flagstaff. I read it now with ease: [...] "Berry Pomeroy Athletic Club." ...|$|R
60|$|I saw him {{raise his}} gun ever so little and bend forward, {{and at that}} moment out flashed two woodcocks into the open, the one <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>missed</b> to his right, and the other to his left.|$|E
6000|$|The {{thing in}} the dark {{repeated}} in a louder tone, [...] "Say the words." [...] <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>missed</b> its last remark. [...] "Not to go on all-fours; that is the Law," [...] it repeated {{in a kind of}} sing-song.|$|E
60|$|Indeed, I {{could have}} torn my hair when I {{read in the}} English papers of the fine {{fighting}} which {{was going on in}} Portugal and on the frontiers of Spain, all of which <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>missed</b> through my misfortune in falling into the hands of Milord Wellington.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is well, Dias, that {{we carried}} out your suggestion, as I see <b>I</b> should <b>have</b> had an uncommonly {{good chance of}} getting my fingers smashed, or a wrist broken. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>missed</b> as often as any of you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was dreaming}} {{of all the}} chances which Pythagoras and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>missed</b> to-night owing to your d----d nonsense," [...] said Socrates, who was more sulky now {{than he had been}} before he went to sleep.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is not tenable," [...] said Mr. Stone. [...] "But it is restful. The wind is {{everywhere}} and nowhere, and {{nothing can be}} hidden from it. When <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>missed</b> that little girl, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> tried, in a sense, to become the wind; but <b>I</b> <b>have</b> found it difficult." ...|$|R
60|$|I fired, {{and knowing}} that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>missed,</b> turned sick and faint. The {{antelope}} bounded forward a few yards right {{to the edge of}} the dip; then, never having heard such a sound before, and being overcome by some fatal curiosity, stopped and turned around, staring at the direction whence it had come.|$|E
60|$|With {{increasing}} animation {{he stated}} again that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>missed</b> his point. Entirely. And {{in a tone}} of growing self-conscious complacency he told me that few things escaped his attention, and he was rather used to think them out, and generally from his experience of life and men arrived at the right conclusion.|$|E
6000|$|... 'So we'll wait {{the signal}} rocket, Till [...] . Barrow, show that locket, That turquoise-studded locket, Which you slipped from out your pocket [...] And are {{pressing}} with a kiss! [...] Turquoise-studded, spiral-twisted, It is hers! And <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>missed</b> it From her chain; {{and you have}} kissed it: [...] Barrow, villain, what is this?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I've missed you," [...] {{she confessed}} frankly. [...] "I {{seem to have}} had lots to do, and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been going to the theatres, and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> quite made up my mind to write a play. But <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>missed</b> you.--Shall <b>I</b> go and put on my hat?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "To me," [...] Mr. Stenson declared, [...] "this is {{a veritable}} temple of peace. I arrived here {{literally}} on all fours. <b>Miss</b> Abbeway <b>has</b> proved to me quite conclusively {{that as a}} democratic leader <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>missed</b> my vocation." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, yes," [...] Nellie said, {{clapping}} her hands. [...] "And {{there will}} be fine doings, and bonfires, and arches, {{and all sorts of}} festivities. I do begin to feel how much <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>missed</b> the want of that good fairy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Boom!" [...] {{came the}} ironclad's gunshot like a command. [...] "Bang!" [...] the bullet leapt from my hand. Do you know, I {{did not want}} to shoot her then. Indeed I {{did not want to}} shoot her then! Bang! and I had fired again, still striding on, and--each time it seemed <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>missed.</b>|$|E
60|$|Both Jack and Peterkin {{answered}} {{this inquiry}} by themselves laughing so immoderately that I was induced to believe <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>missed</b> noticing some good joke, so I begged {{that it might}} be explained to me; but as this only produced repeated roars of laughter, I smiled and helped myself to another slice of plantain.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, friends," [...] said Oliver, after {{completing}} the dressing of the wound, [...] "before I met with you <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>missed</b> my way while travelling to St. Just. Will one of you direct me to the right road, and I shall bid you good-night, as I think you have no further need of my services." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Poor Emily," [...] she said. [...] "You know I am amongst {{those few}} {{who knew her}} well--you also, I think, were one of them. There was no one I was more fond of--no one whom <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>missed</b> so much." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah! <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>missed</b> all {{the great}} festivals this year. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> not stayed to the full service since I was at Rickworth, and what is worse, I do not dislike being prevented,' said Violet, falteringly; as if she must say the words, 'I don't like staying alone.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You {{ought not}} to have done it at all. We will talk about that later. It doesn't alter the fact that Ellen is a thief. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>missed</b> money half a dozen times. Besides that, there's the brooch. Step this way, officer.' ...|$|R
