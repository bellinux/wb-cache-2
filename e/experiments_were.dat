5|$|Initial <b>experiments</b> <b>were</b> {{carried out}} in September 1954. No alpha decay was seen from {{mendelevium}} atoms; thus, Ghiorso suggested that the mendelevium had all decayed by electron capture to fermium and that the experiment should be repeated to search instead for spontaneous fission events.

5|$|Several of the {{officers}} and petty officers {{in charge of the}} main gun turret crews believed that Skelley's and Costigan's proposed <b>experiments</b> <b>were</b> dangerous, especially because of the age of the guns and the turrets, in addition to their numerous maintenance problems. Meyer complained to Commander Robert John Kissinger, Iowas chief weapons officer, about the proposed experiments, but Kissinger refused to convey the concerns to Captain Moosally or halt the experiments.|$|E
5|$|The first {{chemistry}} <b>experiments</b> <b>were</b> performed using gas thermochromatography in 2001, using 172Os and 173Os as a reference.

40|$|The Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL) Advanced Test Reactor (ATR), a DOE Category A reactor, was {{designed}} to provide an irradiation test environment for conducting a variety of experiments. The ATR Safety Analysis Report, determined by DOE {{to meet the requirements}} of 10 CFR 830, Subpart B, provides versatility in types of <b>experiments</b> that may <b>be</b> conducted. This paper addresses two general types of experiments in the ATR facility and how safety analyses for <b>experiments</b> <b>are</b> related to the ATR safety basis. One type of <b>experiment</b> <b>is</b> more routine and generally represents greater risks; therefore this type of <b>experiment</b> <b>is</b> addressed with more detail in the safety basis. This allows individual safety analyses for these <b>experiments</b> to <b>be</b> more routine and repetitive. The second type of <b>experiment</b> <b>is</b> less defined and is permitted under more general controls. Therefore, individual safety analyses for the second type of <b>experiment</b> tend to <b>be</b> more unique from experiment to <b>experiment.</b> <b>Experiments</b> <b>are</b> also discussed relative to "major modifications" and DOE-STD- 1027 - 92.

5|$|The sheep {{populations that}} were {{required}} by Bennetts at Avondale also afforded additional research opportunities.

5|$|A {{large number}} of {{decompression}} <b>experiments</b> <b>were</b> done using goats, which were compressed for three hours to assumed saturation, rapidly decompressed to surface pressure, and examined for symptoms of decompression sickness. Goats which had been compressed to 2.25 bar absolute or less {{showed no signs of}} DCS after rapid decompression to the surface. Goats compressed to 6 bar and rapidly decompressed to 2.6 bar (pressure ratio 2.3 to 1) also showed no signs of DCS. Haldane and his co-workers concluded that a decompression from saturation with a pressure ratio of 2 to 1 was unlikely to produce symptoms.|$|E
5|$|As ununennium is {{the lightest}} undiscovered element, {{it has been}} the target of {{synthesis}} experiments by both German and Russian teams in recent years. The Russian <b>experiments</b> <b>were</b> conducted in 2011, and no results were released, strongly implying that no ununennium atoms were identified. From April to September 2012, an attempt to synthesize the isotopes 295Uue and 296Uue was made by bombarding a target of berkelium-249 with titanium-50 at the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research in Darmstadt, Germany. Based on the theoretically predicted cross-section, it was expected that an ununennium atom would be synthesized within five months of the beginning of the experiment.|$|E

5|$|Because {{the lighter}} group 12 {{elements}} often occur as chalcogenide ores, <b>experiments</b> <b>were</b> conducted in 2015 {{to attempt to}} deposit copernicium atoms on a selenium surface to form copernicium selenide, CnSe. Reaction of copernicium atoms with trigonal selenium to form a selenide were observed, with ΔHadsCn(t-Se) > 48kJ/mol, with the kinetic hindrance towards selenide formation being lower for copernicium than for mercury. This was unexpected as {{the stability of the}} group 12 selenides tends to decrease down the group from ZnSe to HgSe, while it increases down the group for the group 14 selenides from GeSe to PbSe.|$|E
5|$|Dr Eric Underwood {{began his}} {{research}} at Avondale in the mid-1930s also utilising the sheep flocks.

5|$|In 1935, the United States Department of the Interior {{created the}} Southwestern Range and Sheep Breeding Laboratory {{to address the}} {{problems}} Rambouillet stock had caused for the Navajo economy. Located at Fort Wingate, New Mexico, the program's aim was to develop a new sheep bloodline that simulated the wool characteristics of the 19th-century Navajo-Churro stock and would also supply adequate meat. The Fort Wingate researchers collected old Navajo-Churro stock from remote parts of the reservation and hired a weaver to test their experimental wool. Offspring of these <b>experiments</b> <b>were</b> distributed among the Navajo people. World War II interrupted the greater part of this effort when military work resumed at Fort Wingate.|$|E

5|$|In 1967, <b>experiments</b> <b>were</b> {{conducted}} to compare nobelium's chemical behavior {{to that of}} terbium, californium, and fermium. All four elements were reacted with chlorine and the resulting chlorides were deposited along a tube, along which they were carried by a gas. It {{was found that the}} nobelium chloride produced was strongly adsorbed on solid surfaces, proving that it was not very volatile, like the chlorides of the other three investigated elements. However, both NoCl2 and NoCl3 were expected to exhibit nonvolatile behavior and hence this experiment was inconclusive as to what the preferred oxidation state of nobelium was. Determination of nobelium's favoring of the +2 state had to wait until the next year, when cation-exchange chromatography and coprecipitation <b>experiments</b> <b>were</b> carried out on around fifty thousand 255No atoms, finding that it behaved differently from the other actinides and more like the divalent alkaline earth metals. This proved that in aqueous solution, nobelium is most stable in the divalent state when strong oxidizers are absent. Later experimentation in 1974 showed that nobelium eluted with the alkaline earth metals, between Ca2+ and Sr2+. Nobelium is the only f-block element for which the +2 state is the most common and stable one in aqueous solution. This occurs because of the large energy gap between the 5f and 6d orbitals {{at the end of the}} actinide series.|$|E
5|$|Instead, {{under the}} novel {{conditions}} of attrition warfare, war pigeons in their traditional role as pigeon post saw a renaissance.

5|$|Kitayama and Karasawa {{concluded}} that the patterns in the findings from both <b>experiments</b> <b>were</b> most consistent with {{the hypothesis that the}} preference is due to an attachment to the self.
