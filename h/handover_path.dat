First, we present {{the state of the art}} by over-viewing the IEEE 802.16 j specifications regarding QoS, <b>handover</b> and <b>path</b> management. We also introduce the intrusion tolerance concept while examining some research work, as it is applied to wireless networking and we overview the requirements for an efficient QoS provision. Second, we define the novel 3 TCA architecture and we present its services and the QoS compensation it achieves. Third, we detail the 3 TCA implementation in Relay Networks. After that, we overview the properties and features of 3 TCA-based relay networks. Finally, we evaluate the performance of our proposition and we conclude.|$|R

Such a sender-centric failover-based handover mechanism will inevitably degrade the SCTP performance due to (i) failure detection on the primary path is a time-consuming process (more than 60 s [11]) and (ii) frequent “ping-pong” primary <b>path</b> <b>handover</b> may increase the sender’s load and overhead. Moreover, when SCTP switches to a new primary path, it may experience a slow-start phase on the new path because of a timeout event. This may cause a sending rate fluctuation and influence user-perceived quality of multimedia communications.|$|R
40|$|Aiming at the {{features}} of wireless mobile communication, this paper proposes a new resource reservation scheme, Fast RSVP (resource reservation protocol), to guarantee the QoS of sessions for mobile IPv 6. The scheme adopts cross-layer design, it cooperates two modules at different layers: Mobile IP module and RSVP module. By adding some primitives, the scheme lets the two modules work together to guarantee the QoS of sessions for mobile users. Fast RSVP imports a series of new mechanisms such as advanced resource reservation on neighbor tunnels, resource reservation on optimized routes, resource reservation for <b>handover</b> sessions, <b>path</b> merging etc. Simulation results show that Fast RSVP scheme, compared with other traditional RSVP extensions for mobile environments, has the following advantages: (1) it realizes a mobile node handover with QoS guarantees; (2) it avoids resource wasting caused by triangular routes and duplicate reservations in mobile IP handover process; (3) it distinguishes different types of reservation requests, greatly reducing the handover session forced termination rate while maintaining high performance of the network. 12 page(s...|$|R

The routing problem is divided into two separate problems: UDL and ISL routing. For the ISL routing, the problem has been defined as a minimization problem with start and end satellites known, and minimizing the <b>path</b> <b>handover</b> to connect these end satellites. We used greedy optimization to solve the problem. In order to use the algorithm on traffic requiring guaranteed QoS, we added an end-to-end delay constraint into the optimization process...|$|R

Interruption in World Wide Web access during handover in a cellular network can be avoided by relocating in advance the proxy cache to the target base station before the <b>handover</b> using the <b>path</b> prediction algorithm. To reduce the cache overhead in the handover, this paper proposes a “distance based relocation ” mechanism, in which the cache of the base station is relocated once the mobile unit reaches the relocation point in the cell. This mechanism estimates the time at which the relocation has to be done by keeping track of the distance between the mobile terminal and the base station...|$|R
40|$|The {{emerging}} Media Independent Handover (MIH) standard {{proposes to}} support session continuity during handover between heterogeneous networks. One {{of the critical}} features provided by MIH is an Event Service which includes predictive network degradation events, such as Link_Going_Down (LGD), which are triggered based on link layer metrics. Our results highlight the reactivness of media stream quality to network degradation. The point of degradation however, is specific to {{the characteristics of the}} class of media streaming service. Many existing event algorithms utilize static performance thresholds which are unresponsive to the requirements of individual application service classes. In this paper we propose a Service Oriented Link Triggering Algorithm (SOLTA) which triggers the LGD and Link_Down (LD) events based on link layer metrics but subject to the performance characteristics of the supported class of service. SOLTA illustrates that for 802. 11, it is necessary to have aggressive service class specific, link event triggering. SOLTA also illustrates how a soft <b>path</b> <b>handover</b> approach such as Stream Control Transmission Protocols Concurrent Multi-path Transfer (SCTP-CMT) variant is necessary to support seamless session migration...|$|R

For Mobility in IP based networks, Mobile IPv 6 is considered as a standard by both industry and research community, but this mobility protocol has some reliability issues. There {{are a number of}} elements that can interrupt the communication between Mobile Node (MN) and Corresponding Node (CN), however the scope of this research is limited to the following issues only: • Reliability of Mobility Protocol • Home Agent Management • <b>Handovers</b> • <b>Path</b> failures between MN and CN First entity that can disrupt Mobile IPv 6 based communication is the Mobility Anchor point itself, i. e. Home Agent. Reliability of Home Agent is addressed first because if this mobility agent is not reliable there would be no reliability of mobile communication. Next scenario where mobile communication can get disrupted is created by MN itself and it is due to its mobility. When a MN moves around, at some point it will be out of range of its active base station {{and at the same time}} it may enter the coverage area of another base station. In such a situation, the MN should perform a handover, which is a very slow process. This handover delay is reduced by introducing a “make before break” style handover in IP network. Another situation in which the Mobile IPv 6 based communication can fail is when there is a path failure between MN and CN. This situation can be addressed by utilizing multiple interfaces of MN at the same time. One such protocol which can utilize multiple interfaces is SHIM 6 but it was not designed to work on mobile node. It was designed for core networks but after some modification in the protocol, it can be deployed on mobile nodes.

40|$|With {{the use of}} picocells to {{meet the}} {{increased}} demand of traffic density, the mobile communication networks need to comply with greater number of call handover requests than the normal cells. As the probability of handover requests is directly proportional to the mobile velocity, the handover response should be made dependent on mobile velocity to avoid unwanted call termination and early handover for high and low velocity vehicles respectively. Due to the dependency of <b>handover</b> performance to <b>path</b> loss exponent, a variable hysteresis scheme has already been proposed. As the handover performance is highly dependent on user velocity, if the hysteresis margin is made adaptive and varied dynamically in a complimentary manner with mobile velocity, the call termination as well as unnecessary handover may be minimized for high and low velocity mobiles respectively. In this work, a variable hysteresis margin based handover scheme is thus proposed and studied which takes care of both path loss exponent and mobile velocity. For different values of path loss exponent the positions of handover requests have been found out for different mobile velocities. Results show that handover delay decreases proportionately as user velocity increases, thus eliminating call termination or call quality degradation probability for high velocity mobiles and early handover for low velocity mobiles...|$|R
