The effects of these defaults are taken into account by correcting the laminated stiffness coefficients. Numerical examples have been performed analyzing three types of stacking sequences for thin carbon/epoxy cylinders.

It is shown that the natural frequencies depend on applied in-plane load, initial <b>geometrical</b> <b>imperfection</b> and the in-plane boundary conditions.;In the theoretical analysis, the natural frequencies, out-of-plane static displacements and in-plane stress distribution are calculated using the Rayleigh-Ritz minimization technique. A concept of 2 ̆ 7 connection coefficients 2 ̆ 7 {{has been used to}} reduce the computational work. In this concept, the relationship between the out-of-plane and in-plane displacement coefficients are first determined by solving the equations resulting from the minimization of the total potential energy with respect to the in-plane displacement coefficients. This relationship is then substituted into the equations obtained by minimizing the total potential energy with respect to the out-of-plane displacement coefficients.;In the experimental side of the work, tests were carried out on several thin (thickness ranging from 0. 56 mm to 1. 15 mm) mild steel plates (300 mm x 250 mm). Uniaxial in-plane loading was applied through two 2 ̆ 7 V 2 ̆ 7 grooved edge beams.
