These new talks, known as the Structural Impediments Initiative, focused on structural features in Japan that seemed to impede imports in ways outside the normal scope of trade negotiations. Issues raised in the Structural Impediments Initiative, and by the Japanese themselves in domestic discussions, included the distribution system (in which manufacturers continued to have unusually strong control over wholesalers and retailers handling their products, inhibiting newcomers, especially foreign ones) and investment behavior that made {{it very difficult for}} foreign firms to acquire Japanese firms (such as that of the management of Koito Mfg. in <b>denying</b> <b>board</b> representation to T.

50|$|The Flight Compensation Regulation 261/2004 is a {{regulation}} in EU law establishing common rules on compensation and assistance to passengers {{in the event}} of <b>denied</b> <b>boarding,</b> flight cancellations, or long delays of flights. It requires compensation of €250 to €600 depending on the flight distance for delays over 4 hours, cancellations, or being <b>denied</b> <b>boarding</b> from overbooking. Shorter delays mean a percentage of the full compensation. Airlines must provide refreshments and accommodation where appropriate. The Court of Justice of the European Union has interpreted passenger rights strictly, so that there are virtually no exceptions for airlines to evade their obligations for breach of contract.|$|E

5000|$|Despite initial {{opposition}} from the Chinese Ministry of Railways, train tickets were upgraded in late 2009 to accommodate QR codes on a ticket, thus enabling personal information to be stored. This would link the ticket with its legal purchaser, {{paving the way for}} a [...] "real name and ID" [...] requirement to be implemented. Such a policy went into effect on a trial basis beginning early 2010 (for the duration of the Chunyun period on all non high-speed trains). In 2011, the [...] "real name and ID" [...] requirement expanded to more cities in China, and was made permanent for the Wuhan-Guangzhou High-Speed Railway even after the Chunyun period. The requirement became mandatory for all CRH high speed trains with effect from June 1, 2011 and was expanded to nearly all passenger trains on January 1, 2012.

40|$|In this paper, {{we develop}} a revenue {{management}} model to jointly make the capacity allocation and overbooking decisions over an airline network. The crucial observation behind our model {{is that if}} the penalty cost of <b>denying</b> <b>boarding</b> to the reservations were given by a separable function, then the optimality equation for the joint capacity allocation and overbooking problem would decompose by the itineraries. We exploit this observation by building an approximation to the penalty cost that is separable by the numbers of reservations for different itineraries. In this case, we can obtain an approximate solution to the optimality equation by plugging the separable approximation into the boundary condition of the optimality equation. Our computational experiments compare our approach with a standard deterministic linear programming formulation, as well as a recent joint capacity allocation and overbooking model. When compared with the standard deterministic linear programming formulation, our approach can provide significant profit improvements. On the other hand, when compared with the recent joint capacity allocation and overbooking model, our approach can provide similar profit performance with substantially shorter runtimes. Capacity allocation and overbooking form two important components of network revenue managemen...|$|R
