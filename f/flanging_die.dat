40|$|In this study, {{springback}} for bending and flanging advanced {{high-strength steel}} (AHSS) was investigated by using experimental methods and computation models. The elastic and plastic properties of AHSS {{were determined by}} using the tensile test and the biaxial bulge test. Dual-phase (DP) 600 showed significant decreases about 10 % of unloading elastic modulus as the effective strain increased during loading and unloading cyclic tensile tests, while aluminum-killed drawing quality (AKDQ) gave almost constant modulus. Therefore, a general expectation of constant elastic modulus of material will not always apply to AHSS. The V-bend {{test was used to}} investigate the effects of material properties, texture orientations, and die openings on springback. The experimenatal results showed that TRIP 780 has relatively smaller springback compared to DP 780 and 780 HY (high yield) materials at two different die opening lengths. Experimental results were compared to the predictions of computation model. Preliminary tests with an S-rail <b>flanging</b> <b>die</b> were conducted with AKDQ material to investigate the feasibility of this test method for springback study. In addition, finite-element (FE) simulations for S-rail flanging of AKDQ and DP 780 were conducted to predict the thinning distribution. Springback simulations were conducted for DP 980 S-rail part with constant and variable elastic modulus. The variable elastic modulus gave the higher magnitude of springback compared to the constant elastic modulus model...|$|E

Open and closed Pillow Blocks, <b>Flanged</b> bearings, <b>die</b> set bearings and bushings followed. The company then developed ISO Metric and finally JIS Metric bearings.|$|R
