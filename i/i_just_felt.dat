I didn't really know what to do for her because I didn't hear nothing else that was on the album, but <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>felt</b> like she didn't have that bounce on her album.|$|E

Corgan explained, [...] "To be completely honest, I {{think it was}} a situation where we'd become so close to Butch that it started to work to our disadvantage... <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>felt</b> we had to force the situation, sonically, and take ourselves out of normal Pumpkin recording mode. I didn't want to repeat past Pumpkin work." ...|$|E

[...] Dunfermline manager Stephen Kenny praised his team's efforts after the game but admitted that poor defending had resulted in the defeat. Kenny was sacked as manager a week later due to continuing poor league results and was replaced by player Jim McIntyre.|$|E

500|$|I've {{been in a}} {{reflective}} state of mind. I've done lot of soul searching and <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>felt</b> in a romantic mood when I was writing for [...] so that's what I wrote about... I decided that I {{wanted to work with}} a whole bunch of different producers. [...] Björk's album was one of my favorite for years—it's brilliantly produced. And I also wanted to work with Massive Attack. So obviously, he was on the list. Nellee was the last person I worked with, and it wasn't until then that I got a grip of what the sound of the whole record was, so I had to go back and redo a lot.|$|E

500|$|The five-song soundtrack {{album and}} {{background}} score of Siva were composed by Ilaiyaraaja, with Veturi Sundararama Murthy writing {{the lyrics of}} [...] "Anando Brahma", [...] "Enniyallo", and [...] "Kiss Me Hello". Sirivennela Sitaramasastri wrote the lyrics for the remaining two songs: [...] "Botany" [...] and [...] "Sarasalu". S. P. Balasubrahmanyam, S. Janaki, K. S. Chithra, and Mano were the singers. Due to a strike in Madras, Ilaiyaraaja and Varma completed the background score in Mumbai. The producers suggested Varma to use stock tunes instead for the score. Nagarjuna noticed this {{and asked them to}} provide what Varma asked for, and offered to pay the additional expenses incurred if any. For an action scene, Ilaiyaraaja used moving string music; when Varma asked why, he answered: [...] "They have come here to study and they are fighting. So <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>felt</b> sad for them".|$|E

500|$|During the 1992 season, Ripken and the Orioles {{tried to}} work out a new contract. Several times {{throughout}} the season, Ripken endured batting slumps. He said after the season, [...] "I don't like to make excuses for the fact that I wasn't hitting, but I was distracted... <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>felt</b> like the Orioles were playing mind games with me. Whether that was right or wrong, it was bothering me." [...] On August 22, Ripken finally signed a five-year, $30.5 million contract, the largest in baseball history at the time. Ripken's slumps continued, and he was even booed by Orioles' fans late in the season. He finished the year batting [...]251 with career-lows in home runs (14) and RBI (72). The Orioles contended for the playoffs much of the year, not getting eliminated until September 27. However, he did win his second Gold Glove Award.|$|E
500|$|Kesha {{explained}} that she wanted the song to become a pride anthem; [...] "I wanted to inspire people ... to be themselves. It's a celebration of any sort of quirks or eccentricities." [...] She elaborated, [...] "I was really affected by the suicides that have been happening, having been subject to very public hatred [...] I have absolutely no idea how these kids felt. What I'm going through {{is nothing compared to}} what they had to go through. Just know things do get better and you need to celebrate who you are. Every weird thing about you is beautiful and makes life interesting. Hopefully the song really captures that emotion of celebrating who you are ... <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>felt</b> like people hate because they don't understand or they're jealous, It's all coming from a very negative place and I really feel like people don't need to pay attention to that." ...|$|E

In an interview for MTV, Rihanna initially stated she was against recording a sequel: [...] "When I first heard the idea about doing a part two, I was just completely against it. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>felt</b> like you couldn't beat the 'original'. There's {{no way you can}} outdo that, so why compete with it?". She said when she first heard the original demo of the song in the studio with Eminem, sung by American singer-songwriter Skylar Grey, her reservations about recording it went away. While the demo was only accompanied by a piano, Rihanna and her team added drums and later vocals from Eminem.|$|E
500|$|Carter openly wept in {{the locker}} room after the game and was {{affected}} so badly by the loss that he considered retirement. [...] "Walking off that field and losing like that," [...] Carter reflected, [...] "I didn't even know if I wanted to play football anymore.

[...] Both Carter and fellow Hall of Fame member Randle believed that the 1998 Vikings team was their best chance at winning a Super Bowl; neither player would ever reach the Super Bowl in their careers.|$|R

500|$|The {{reunion of}} the band has been {{characterized}} as dysfunctional by both Barker and DeLonge. Hoppus commented on this era {{of the band}} in a later interview: [...] "Everything was always very contentious. There was always just a strange vibe. [...] I {{knew there was something}} wrong." [...] In his memoir, Can I Say, Barker claims DeLonge's behavior on tour was [...] "introverted" [...] until [...] "money started coming in," [...] after which [...] "he'd get excited about Blink." [...] He states DeLonge abruptly quit sometime in mid-2014, and rejoined the following day. The group planned to begin writing their seventh album in January 2015, which had continually seen delays. [...] "I'd do interviews and <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>felt</b> awful for fans because they were promised albums for years and we couldn't do it," [...] Barker later said. A record deal was finalized and sessions were booked before DeLonge's manager informed the band he intended to spend more time on [...] "non-musical activities" [...] and indefinitely depart the group. In his own statement, DeLonge remarked that he [...] "Never planned on quitting, just find it hard as hell to commit." [...] After these events, Barker summarized the band's reunion: [...] "Why Blink even got back together in the first place is questionable." ...|$|E

We did a lot of auditioning, but we had this meeting with Amy Adams and after that <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>felt</b> she was perfect for it." [...] Adams auditioned for the role three times: once for the unproduced Superman: Flyby, and the second time for Superman Returns before landing the current role. Adams was confirmed to play Lois Lane in March 2011. While announcing the role, Snyder said in a statement, [...] "We are excited to announce the casting of Amy Adams, one of the most versatile and respected actresses in films today.

[...] On portraying Lois Lane, Adams stated that the film would feature a Lois Lane who is an [...] "independent, feisty woman ... but set in a more identifiable world." [...] Adams said that [...] "She has become more of a free-ranging journalist, someone who likes to be hands-on. The nature of the newspaper business has changed so much. There is so much more pressure." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{tour of the}} United States faced various troubles. Ament {{said that}} the band and its crew had to [...] " [...] shows from the ground up, a venue {{everywhere}} we went." [...] In June 1995, the band was scheduled to play at San Francisco, California's Golden Gate Park in front of 50,000 people.

[...] Because of Vedder's health the band was forced to cancel the remaining dates of its tour of the United States. Some dates were reinstated while the rest were rescheduled for the fall. About canceling the dates, Vedder said, [...] "I think we all agreed that it had gotten insane, that it was no longer about the music." [...] Ament later said, [...] "We were so hardheaded about the 1995 tour. Had to prove we could tour on our own, and it pretty much killed us, killed our career." ...|$|E
