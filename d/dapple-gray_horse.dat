60|$|The Virginians {{have always}} been noted for their love of horses; a manly passion which, in those days of opulence, they indulged without regard to expense. The rich {{planters}} vied {{with each other in}} their studs, importing the best English stocks. Mention is made of one of the Randolphs of Tuckahoe, who built a stable for his favorite <b>dapple-gray</b> <b>horse,</b> Shakespeare, with a recess for the bed of the negro groom, who always slept beside him at night.|$|E
