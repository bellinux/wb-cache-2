40|$|<b>Flowsheet</b> {{testing was}} {{performed}} to further develop the nitric/glycolic/formic acid <b>flowsheet</b> {{as an alternative to}} the nitric/formic <b>flowsheet</b> currently being processed at the DWPF. This new <b>flowsheet</b> has shown that mercury can be removed in the Sludge Receipt and Adjustment Tank (SRAT) with minimal hydrogen generation. All other processing objectives were also met, including greatly reducing the Slurry Mix Evaporator (SME) product yield stress as compared to the baseline nitric/formic <b>flowsheet.</b> Eight runs were performed in total, including the baseline run. The baseline nitric/formic <b>flowsheet</b> run was extremely difficult to process under existing DWPF acceptance criteria with this simulant at the HM levels of noble metals. While nitrite was destroyed and mercury was removed to near the DWPF limit, the rheology of the SRAT and SME products were well above design basis and hydrogen generation far exceeded the DWPF limit. In addition, mixing during the SME cycle was very poor. In this sense, the nitric/glycolic/formic acid <b>flowsheet</b> represents a significant upgrade over the current <b>flowsheet.</b> In the nitric/glycolic/formic <b>flowsheet</b> runs, mercury was successfully removed with almost no hydrogen generation and the SRAT and SME products yield stresses were within process limits or previously processed ranges. It is recommended that DWPF continue to support development of the nitric/glycolic/formic <b>flowsheet.</b> Although experience is limited at this time, this <b>flowsheet</b> meets or outperforms the current <b>flowsheet</b> in many regards, including off-gas generation, mercury removal, product rheology and general ease of processing. Additional <b>flowsheet</b> testing will allow for a more thorough understanding of the chemistry and effectiveness of the <b>flowsheet</b> over a range of sludge compositions and formic/glycolic ratios. This testing will also show whether the REDOX and metal solubility concerns with this change in the <b>flowsheet</b> can be addressed by just adjusting the volumes of glycolic acid added. The outstanding issues regarding the glycolic/formic <b>flowsheet</b> include increasing understanding of the impact on glass REDOX control and increased metal solubility, particularly iron, during processing. Additionally, evaluations of the utility of the <b>flowsheet</b> over varying sludge compositions should be completed to ensure <b>flowsheet</b> robustness.

40|$|<b>Flowsheet</b> {{testing was}} {{performed}} to develop the nitric-glycolic-formic acid <b>flowsheet</b> (referred to as the glycolic-formic <b>flowsheet</b> {{throughout the rest of}} the report) as an alternative to the nitric/formic <b>flowsheet</b> currently being processed at the DWPF. This new <b>flowsheet</b> has shown that mercury can be removed in the Sludge Receipt and Adjustment Tank (SRAT) with minimal hydrogen generation. All processing objectives were also met, including greatly reducing the Slurry Mix Evaporator (SME) product yield stress as compared to the baseline nitric/formic <b>flowsheet.</b> Forty-six runs were performed in total, including the baseline run and the melter feed preparation runs. Significant results are summarized. The baseline nitric/formic <b>flowsheet</b> run, using the SB 6 simulant produced by Harrell was extremely difficult to process successfully under existing DWPF acceptance criteria with this simulant at the HM levels of noble metals. While nitrite was destroyed and mercury was removed to near the DWPF limit, the rheology of the SRAT and SME products were well above design basis and hydrogen generation far exceeded the DWPF SRAT limit. In addition, mixing during the SME cycle was very poor. In this sense, the nitric/glycolic/formic acid <b>flowsheet</b> represents a significant upgrade over the current <b>flowsheet.</b> Mercury was successfully removed with almost no hydrogen generation and the SRAT and SME products yield stresses were within process limits or previously processed ranges. The glycolic-formic <b>flowsheet</b> has a very wide processing window. Testing was completed from 100 % to 200 % of acid stoichiometry and using a glycolic-formic mixture from 40 % to 100 % glycolic acid. The testing met all processing requirements throughout these processing windows. This should allow processing at an acid stoichiometry of 100 % and a glycolic-formic mixture of 80 % glycolic acid with minimal hydrogen generation. It should also allow processing endpoints in the SRAT and SME at significantly higher total solids content and may be effective at acid stoichiometries below 100 %, although no testing was performed below 100 % acid stoichiometry. There are several issues related to the development of the glycolic-formic <b>flowsheet.</b> First, the measurement of anions using the new glycolate anion procedure likely needs to be optimized to improve the accuracy of the anions important to DWPF processing and REDOX prediction. Second, the existing REDOX equation with an added term for glycolate did not accurately predict the glass REDOX for the glycolic-formic <b>flowsheet.</b> Improvement of the anion measurement or modification of the REDOX methodology or equation may be necessary to improve the REDOX prediction. Last, the glycolic-formic <b>flowsheet</b> dissolves a number of metals, including iron. This leads to a thinner slurries but also dissolves up a portion of the iron, which is currently used for criticality control. It is recommended that DWPF continue to support development of the glycolic-formic <b>flowsheet.</b> This <b>flowsheet</b> meets or outperforms the baseline <b>flowsheet</b> in off-gas generation, mercury removal, product rheology and general ease of processing. Additional testing is in progress to demonstrate the effectiveness of the nitric-glycolic-formic <b>flowsheet</b> in processing a wide sludge processing window using the matrix sludge simulants...|$|R

The test {{had been}} carried out on a lead oxide ore (18. 57 % Pb) from Kazakhstan, which had a high {{oxidation}} ratio (above 95 %) and complexly intergrowed with plenty of alkaline gangue minerals such as calcite and dolomite. A joint <b>flowsheet</b> that combined the gravity separation with flotation was developed to recover the lead, during which <b>flowsheet,</b> a new effective slurry regulator was used. Compared with the joint <b>flowsheet,</b> the concentrates of the single gravity separation and the single flotation were achieved with a lower Pb recovery of 53. 80 % and 56. 06 %, and the Pb grade of 62. 00 % and 66. 28 %, respectively. Finally, a concentrate by the joint <b>flowsheet</b> was obtained with a Pb recovery of 89. 12 % and a Pb grade of 58. 90 %. The tailing from the joint <b>flowsheet</b> had a low Pb grade of 1. 59 %, {{with a loss of}} 5. 50 % of Pb.

Process <b>flowsheets</b> have been designed for testing in countercurrent experiments with centrifugal contractors.

40|$|A {{systematic}} procedure {{has been}} developed and a software code created to solve retrofit problems in continuous petrochemical plants. The procedure goes through a hierarchy of steps {{to determine what is}} the most economical method of retrofitting an existing chemical plant. The criterion used in determining the retrofit of a specific plant is either reducing operating costs (constant production rate) or increasing profits (unknown production rate). Refining this procedure and demonstrating that it is reasonable, by developing a general purpose software code, is the major contribution of this research. ^ The procedure is hierarchical and provides stopping points so that little work {{needs to be done to}} reject a poor project. It is structured in a way that first sets minimum targets for the retrofit project and uses an efficient <b>flowsheet</b> structure filter to look at only the subset of possible <b>flowsheet</b> structures that have the potential for being profitable. The procedure then decomposes the <b>flowsheet</b> evaluation problem into two parts. First the <b>flowsheet</b> is examined by neglecting the energy integration network. The best <b>flowsheet</b> found without considering the heat exchanger network is then examined using existing energy integration procedures and considering the existing heat exchanger area. ^ When analyzing a <b>flowsheet</b> the procedure always considers the entire <b>flowsheet</b> (with or without the energy integration network) and the constraints imposed by existing equipment. When constraints are found, a series of different policies are available to break those constraints by one or more alternative means. The user selects, for each piece of equipment, a default method to break constraints and the code uses that method whenever required. ^ We have implemented a simple method to tune equipment models to match equipment in an operating plant. This method will account for some systematic modeling errors (bad model parameter values) but not for significant shortcomings in the models. ...|$|R
