In their interview with TV Guide, the two remained ambiguous about the matter, though hinting at a recast. Barbara Esensten commented:It’s {{out there that we}} will probably lose her, and it certainly isn’t our choice. However, we’re still writing the show as if she’s not leaving. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> have to recast Babe, we’ll help the actor take over the part by writing specifically for the new actor like what we did with the Greenlee recast. We saw some little things in Sabine Singh (Greenlee), so we wrote for her accordingly, but you get into real trouble when you completely change the character for a recast. Luckily, Jim and I don’t have any trouble separating the actor from a character because the latter is really paramount in our eyes.|$|E

500|$|Several {{songs from}} the band's third album, Vitalogy, were premiered during this tour. The band's April 3, 1994 concert in Atlanta, Georgia at the Fox Theatre was {{broadcast}} live on the radio in the United States. A few days later, the body of Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain was found in his home in Seattle due to an apparent suicide, which deeply affected Vedder. At the band's April 8, 1994 concert in Fairfax, Virginia at the Patriot Center, Vedder proclaimed, [...] "I don't {{think any of us}} would be in this room tonight if it weren't for Kurt Cobain." [...] Vedder later said that [...] "the day that we found out about Kurt... I was just spinning. I was lost and didn't know <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> play, or <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> just go home, or <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> attend the services.

500|$|The court set out nine minimum standards. In {{response}} to the court's ruling, the General Assembly passed the 1990 Kentucky Education Reform Act, which radically altered Kentucky's school system, providing mechanisms to equalize funding among school districts and implementing {{some of the toughest}} accountability standards in the United States. Of the legislature's actions, Combs opined [...] "Kentucky has now, by reason of this legislation, decided to become educated—and we have embarked on a crusade for that purpose.

500|$|Lincoln's {{declared}} philosophy on court nominations {{was that}} [...] "we cannot ask a man {{what he will}} do, and <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>should,</b> and he should answer us, we should despise him for it. Therefore we must take a man whose opinions are known." [...] Lincoln made five appointments to the United States Supreme Court. Noah Haynes Swayne, nominated January 21, 1862, and appointed January 24, 1862, was chosen as an anti-slavery lawyer who was committed to the Union. Samuel Freeman Miller, nominated and appointed on July 16, 1862, supported Lincoln in the 1860 election and was an avowed abolitionist. David Davis, Lincoln's campaign manager in 1860, nominated December 1, 1862, and appointed December 8, 1862, had {{also served as a}} judge in Lincoln's Illinois court circuit. Stephen Johnson Field, a previous California Supreme Court justice, was nominated March 6, 1863, and appointed March 10, 1863, and provided geographic balance, as well as political balance to the court as a Democrat. Finally, Lincoln's Treasury Secretary, Salmon P. Chase, was nominated as Chief Justice, and appointed the same day, on December 6, 1864. Lincoln believed Chase was an able jurist, would support Reconstruction legislation, and that his appointment united the Republican Party.|$|E

2500|$|In the 1920s, as some {{elements}} within the AFL began to lower these barriers, while groups {{as diverse as the}} Urban League, the Socialist Party of America and Communist Party began to focus on the rights of black workers. Randolph himself was a prominent member of the Socialist Party. From its inception, the BSCP fought to open doors in the organized labor movement in the US for black workers, even though it faced staunch opposition and blatant racism. [...] As BSCP co-founder and First Vice President Milton Price Webster, put it, [...] "...any time we have an American institution composed of white people there is prejudice in it....In America, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> stay out of everything that's prejudiced we wouldn't be in anything." ...|$|E
2500|$|Holmes {{held against}} West Virginia's {{claim that the}} amount of debt should be reduced because the debt paid for {{improvements}} outside the boundaries of West Virginia. Although West Virginia was correct in observing that improvements were outside its boundaries, he wrote, the improvements were financed by state bonds and purchases of stock in corporations making the improvements. Since bond sales and stock purchases were made by the state on behalf of all citizens, all citizens shared in the risk and all citizens shared in the benefit. [...] "...we should be lost in futile detail <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> try to unravel in each instance the ultimate scope of the scheme. ... All the expenditures had the ultimate good of the whole state in view. Therefore we adhere to our conclusion that West Virginia's share of the debt must be ascertained in a different way," [...] Holmes concluded. Nor was ascertaining the amount of debt to be left solely to the West Virginia legislature. Holmes pointed out the danger and inequitable nature of such a scheme, and asserted the Court's jurisdiction over the case: ...|$|E
2500|$|Sir Alberico Gentili and Hugo Grotius {{based their}} philosophies of {{international}} law on natural law. In particular, his writings on freedom of the seas and just war theory directly appealed to natural law. About natural law itself, he wrote that [...] "even the will of an omnipotent being cannot change or abrogate" [...] natural law, which [...] "would maintain its objective validity even <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> assume the impossible, {{that there is no}} God or that he does not care for human affairs." [...] (De iure belli ac pacis, Prolegomeni XI). This is the famous argument etiamsi daremus (non esse Deum), that made natural law no longer dependent on theology. However, German church-historians Ernst Wolf and M. Elze disagreed and claimed that Grotius' concept of natural law did have a theological basis. In Grotius' view, the Old Testament contained moral precepts (e.g. the Decalogue) which Christ confirmed and therefore were still valid. Moreover, they were useful in explaining the content of natural law. Both biblical revelation and natural law originated in God and could therefore not contradict each other.|$|E

60|$|Thus {{ended the}} story of the coming of the Englishmen, and of how Ralph lost his wealth and rank.

2500|$|However, {{there were}} also some {{additions}} to the text, most noticeably some lines from True Tragedy. In Act 1, Scene 1, for example, four lines are added {{at the beginning of}} Henry's declaration that he would rather see civil war than yield the throne. Between lines 124 and 125, Henry states [...] "Ah Plantagenet, why seekest thou to depose me?/Are we not both Plantagenets by birth?/And from two brothers lineally descent?/Suppose by right and equity thou be king...". Also in Act 1, Scene 1, a line is inserted between lines 174 and 175. When York asks Henry if he agrees to the truce, Henry replies [...] "Convey the soldiers hence, and then I will." [...] In Act 2, Scene 6, a line is inserted between lines 7 and 8; [...] "The common people swarm like summerflies." [...] Most significant however is Act 5, Scene 1, where the entirety of Clarence's return to the Lancastrians is taken from True Tragedy, which completely replaces the depiction of the scene in 3 Henry VI. Others changes include the transferral of lines to characters other than those who speak them in the Folio text, particularly in relation to Clarence, who is given numerous lines {{in the early part of}} the play. For example, in Act 2, Scene 1, it is Clarence who says Edward's [...] "I wonder how our princely father scaped,/Or whether he be scaped away or no/From Clifford and Northumberland's pursuit" [...] (ll.1–3). Clarence also speaks Richard's [...] "Three glorious suns, each one a perfect sun,/Not separated with the racking clouds/But severed in a pale clear-shining sky" [...] (ll.26–28); Edward's [...] "Sweet Duke of York, our prop to lean upon/Now thou art gone, we have no staff, no stay" [...] (ll.68–69); and Richard's [...] "Great lord of Warwick, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> recount/Our baleful news, and at each word's deliverance/Stab poniards in our flesh till all were told,/The words would add more anguish than the wounds" [...] (ll.96–100). Also worth noting is that Elizabeth's son, the Marquess of Dorset, is introduced just after the marriage of Elizabeth and Edward (Act 4, Scene 1). In the text, Dorset doesn't appear until Richard III.|$|E
