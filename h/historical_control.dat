50|$|By {{the time}} of the Irish revolutionary period, the Big House had lost much of its <b>historical</b> <b>control</b> and {{influence}} over Irish society. Nonetheless, the houses remained an important symbol of a divided society and they were regarded with great hostility by of the native Irish. This resulted in the targeting of Big Houses during the Irish War of Independence and Irish Civil War by the Irish Republican Army. The War of Independence saw the destruction of approximately 275 'big' houses, with an estimated 199 of the houses being burnt and destroyed from 1920 to 1923. While much republican sentiment argued that these houses had to be burned because they symbolised Irish oppression, the levelling of the landed class was also meted out under socialist rhetoric. The Republican revolutionary Ernie O’Malley stated that “Under the Republic all industry will be controlled by the state for the workers’ and farmers’ benefit… all banks will be operated by the state… the lands of the aristocracy will be seized and divided”. Many of the Big House were abandoned after they had been attacked, and only a small minority were rebuilt or restored.|$|E
5000|$|Clear Lake is {{well-known}} among entomologists for the Clear Lake gnat (Chaoborus astictopus) and <b>historical</b> <b>control</b> efforts. This species of [...] "phantom midge" [...] (so called because the larvae are transparent and {{very difficult to}} see) measures less than 1/4" [...] long and resembles a tiny mosquito, but is non-biting. Clear Lake gnat hatches start anytime from March through June, depending on weather. Before pesticide use began in the 1940s (Refer to Rachel Carson's book Silent Spring, chapter 4), the gnat was so abundant around the lake in the summer that large piles of dead gnats appeared beneath streetlights, looking like dirty snow. The gnat swarms were so thick that people driving {{along the edge of}} the lake reported stopping every 1/4 mile to clean off the gnats off the windshields and headlights of their cars so they could see, and pedestrians tied kerchiefs over their faces to avoid inhaling the gnats. In 1949, as part of an effort to boost tourism and improve the local economy, DDD (dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane) was applied to the lake in heavy doses to eradicate the gnats that were driving summer tourists away from the lake. The treatment succeeded in controlling the gnats that year and for the following year, however in 1953 the gnat population rebounded, prompting another application in 1954. The final application of DDD to Clear Lake was made in 1957 (Cook 1963). Numbers of western grebe were found dead, their tissues containing high concentrations of DDD. The effects were devastating to the local ecology. From 1962 to 1975 carefully planned applications of methyl parathion were made for Clear Lake gnat control. The gnat still occurs in Clear Lake, but at much lower numbers than in the 1940s-1970s. The Clear Lake gnat's population is believed to be kept in check now by two introduced fish species (the threadfin shad and the inland silverside) that compete with the Clear Lake gnat for its preferred zooplankton for food.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{the study}} is to {{describe}} secular changes in mandibular growth comparing a historical group of non-treated subjects from AAOF legacy, used as control group in many cross-sectional studies on craniofacial skeletal growth, with a contemporary group of similar subjects. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The subjects group of <b>historical</b> <b>controls</b> from Bolton-Brush Growth Collection were matched for sex, age and race with subjects from a contemporary control group. Two examiners performed all of the cephalometric measurements at T 0 and T 1 (12 months later) according to Pancherz’s method using Dolphin Imaging 11. 0 software. Data were analysed by conventional descriptive statistics. RESULTS: The mandibular increment in contemporary group is significantly higher than in the historical group (p= 0. 03). The dental values are also statistically higher in contemporary group, whilst for the other values there is not a significant increase. DISCUSSION: The results confirm the secular trends in craniofacial growth already described by other authors using anthropometry and cephalometric analysis. Add to this, there are some limitations in using the <b>historical</b> <b>controls,</b> resulting from difficulty to make a diagnosis of skeletal class II having only cephalometric data. CONCLUSIONS: An increased growth trend in contemporary subjects compared with <b>historical</b> <b>controls</b> is confirmed. The clinical trials using as <b>controls</b> individuals from <b>historical</b> collection could not have validity.

40|$|The {{principles}} and methods of incorporating historical controls in four cases (C 1, stable control; C 2, rare occurrence of responses; C 3, small group size; C 4, <b>historical</b> <b>control</b> as a reference) are discussed.

Our aim was to evaluate if the incidence of overt HE (grade II or more according to WH) and the modifications of venous blood ammonia and psychometric tests during the first month after TIPS can be prevented by albumin infusion. Twenty-three patients consecutively submitted to TIPS were enrolled and treated with 1  g/Kg BW of albumin for the first 2  days after TIPS followed by 0, 5  g/Kg BW at day 4 th and 7 th and then once a week for 3  weeks.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the use of}} <b>historical</b> <b>control</b> data {{in the evaluation of}} tumor incidences from carcinogenicity studies in rodents. Although the most appropriate control group for interpretative purposes is always the concurrent control, there are instances in which the use of <b>historical</b> <b>control</b> information can aid an investigator in the overall evaluation of tumor incidence data. One example is rare tumors; another is a tumor that shows a marginally significant result relative to concurrent controls. However, before <b>historical</b> <b>control</b> data {{can be used in a}} formal testing framework, a number of important issues must first be considered. The nomen-clature conventions and diagnostic criteria for each study should be identical to insure unambiguous identification of all relevant tumors in the <b>historical</b> <b>control</b> database. Criteria should be established that will aid in determining whether a particular study should be included in the database. This will assure a homo-geneous set of studies upon which to base statistical comparisons. Since study-to-study variability in tumor rates may exceed what would be expected by chance alone, these sources of variability should be identified and controlled. Finally, statistical procedures should be employed that adjust for extra-binomial va r ia bi I i ty. This paper also summarizes tumor incidence data from untreated Fischer 344 rats and B 6 C 3 F 1 mice in the National Toxicology Program (NTP) <b>historical</b> <b>control</b> database.

We conducted post-transplant HB vaccine intervention in 38 allo-HSCT recipients with previous HBV infection. Firstly, we followed the recipients without any intervention (<b>historical</b> <b>control)</b> until 2003; hence we commenced HB vaccination. Out of the patients who underwent transplantation after 2003, 13 recipients were immunized by a standard 3 -dose regimen after immunosuppressant cessation (vaccine group), while 12 recipients were observed without any intervention (non-vaccine group). Eight of the 13 <b>historical</b> <b>control</b> group recipients and 3 of the 12 non-vaccine group recipients, {{but none of the}} 13 vaccine group recipients, suffered HBV-RS.

40|$|Obstacles {{sometimes}} limit {{enrollment in}} randomized clinical trials of an exper- imental product versus an active control, making it desirable {{to augment the}} ran- domized control group with <b>historical</b> <b>control</b> groups. However, bias between control groups {{with respect to the}} mean outcome could lead to spurious conclusions. Meth- ods are necessary that allow for the combination of control groups while controlling for bias. Pocock (1976) developed a Bayesian test to address this need, but it requires sub- jective specification of the variance of the bias between the randomized and <b>historical</b> <b>control</b> groups and is designed to include only a single <b>historical</b> <b>control</b> group. In the context of an actively controlled non-inferiority trial, we extend his method on three fronts. First, we replace subjective specification of the variance of the bias with empirically driven estimates. Second, we develop an adaptive design that re-powers a trial based on an interim estimate of the variance of the bias using observed data. Third, we modify the test to include multiple <b>historical</b> <b>control</b> groups. When including a single <b>historical</b> <b>control</b> group, simulations show that the true bias, if known, can be used in place of the variance of the bias, and that this estimate ivmaintains Type I Error with no loss in power as compared to using the true variance of the bias. Further, we show that using an empirical estimate of the bias to estimate the variance of bias may result in moderately inflated Type I Error, but that using a conservative estimate of the bias (the upper bound of a 90 % confidence interval) maintains Type I Error. Simulations also demonstrate that using an estimate of the bias at the interim and conclusion provides designed power but may result in moder- ately inflated Type I Error. Therefore, a conservative estimate of the bias should be used at trial end when using this approach. Lastly, it is shown that if an adequate number of multiple <b>historical</b> <b>control</b> groups are available, the modified test maintains Type I Error when using bias estimates. These methods provide objective guidance on parameter estimation, but further research is necessary in order to improve power...|$|E
