5|$|A {{temple was}} {{constructed}} in AD60–70, and a bathing complex was built up over the next 300years. Engineers drove oak piles into the mud to provide a stable foundation, and surrounded the spring with an irregular stone chamber lined with lead. In the 2nd century, the spring was enclosed within a wooden barrel-vaulted structure that housed the caldarium (<b>hot</b> <b>bath),</b> tepidarium (warm bath), and frigidarium (cold bath).|$|E
5|$|The baths {{have been}} {{modified}} on several occasions, including the 12th century, when John of Tours built a curative bath over the King's Spring reservoir, and the 16th century, {{when the city}} corporation built a new bath (Queen's Bath) {{to the south of}} the spring. The spring is now housed in 18th-century buildings, designed by architects John Wood, the Elder and John Wood, the Younger, father and son. Visitors drank the waters in the Grand Pump Room, a neo-classical salon which remains in use, both for taking the waters and for social functions. Victorian expansion of the baths complex followed the neo-classical tradition established by the Woods. In 1810 the hot springs failed and William Smith opened up the <b>Hot</b> <b>Bath</b> Spring to the bottom, where he found that the spring had not failed but had flowed into a new channel. Smith restored the water to its original course and the baths filled in less time than before.|$|E
5|$|The name Sulis {{continued}} to be used after the Roman invasion, leading to the town's Roman name of Aquae Sulis ("the waters of Sulis"). The temple was constructed in 60–70 AD and the bathing complex was gradually built up over the next 300 years. During the Roman occupation of Britain, and possibly on the instructions of Emperor Claudius, engineers drove oak piles to provide a stable foundation into the mud and surrounded the spring with an irregular stone chamber lined with lead. In the 2nd century it was enclosed within a wooden barrel-vaulted building, and included the caldarium (<b>hot</b> <b>bath),</b> tepidarium (lukewarm bath), and frigidarium (cold bath). After the Roman withdrawal from Britain {{in the first decade}} of the 5th century, these fell into disrepair and were eventually lost due to silting up, and flooding. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle suggests the original Roman baths were destroyed in the 6th century.|$|E

25|$|In {{the final}} step, the molded {{component}} and core are both demolded and the core is melted-out from the molding. This {{is done in}} a <b>hot</b> <b>bath,</b> via induction heating, or {{through a combination of}} the two. Hot baths usually use a tub filled with glycol or Lutron, which is a phenol-based liquid. The bath temperature is slightly higher than that of the core alloy’s melting point, but not so high that it damages the molding. In typical commercial applications the parts are dipped into the <b>hot</b> <b>bath</b> via an overhead conveyor. The advantage to using a <b>hot</b> <b>bath</b> is that it is simpler than induction heating and it helps cure thermoset moldings. The disadvantage is that it is uneconomically slow at a cycle time of 60 to 90 minutes and it poses environmental cleanup issues. Typically the <b>hot</b> <b>bath</b> solution needs cleaning or replacement every year or every half year when used in combination with induction heating.|$|E
25|$|Cores {{are used}} for complex {{injection}} moldings in the fusible core injection molding process. First, a core is made from a fusible alloy or low melting temperature polymer. It is then placed inside the injection mold's dies and the plastic is shot into the mold. The molding is then removed from the mold with the core still in it. Finally, the core is melted or washed out of the molding in a <b>hot</b> <b>bath.</b>|$|E
25|$|A 6th-century Byzantine {{church was}} {{discovered}} in 1999 by an Israeli archaeologist {{on the site of}} an IDF military installation in the northwestern tip of the Gaza Strip. The well-preserved 1,461-year-old church contains three large and colorful mosaics with floral-motifs and geometric shapes. The most impressive of these is a multi-colored medallion {{at the entrance to the}} church. Inscribed therein is the name of the church, St. John, (named for John the Baptist), the names of the mosaic's donors, Victor and Yohanan, and the date of the laying of the church's foundations (544 CE). Also found nearby were a Byzantine <b>hot</b> <b>bath</b> and artificial fishponds.|$|E

500|$|It is {{possible}} that when Ceawlin and Cuthwine took Bath, they found the Roman baths still operating to some extent. [...] Nennius, a ninth-century historian, mentions a [...] "Hot Lake" [...] {{in the land of}} the Hwicce, which was along the Severn, and adds [...] "It is surrounded by a wall, made of brick and stone, and men may go there to bathe at any time, and every man can have the kind of bath he likes. [...] If he wants, it will be a cold bath; and if he wants a <b>hot</b> <b>bath,</b> it will be hot".

500|$|Bath {{may have}} been the site of the Battle of Badon (500 AD), in which King Arthur is said to have {{defeated}} the Anglo-Saxons. The town was captured by the West Saxons in 577 after the Battle of Deorham; the Anglo-Saxon poem The Ruin may describe the appearance of the Roman site about this time. A monastery was founded at an early date– reputedly by Saint David although more probably in 675 by Osric, King of the Hwicce, perhaps using the walled area as its precinct. Nennius, a 9th-century historian, mentions a [...] "Hot Lake" [...] {{in the land of the}} Hwicce along the River Severn, and adds [...] "It is surrounded by a wall, made of brick and stone, and men may go there to bathe at any time, and every man can have the kind of bath he likes. If he wants, it will be a cold bath; and if he wants a <b>hot</b> <b>bath,</b> it will be hot". Bede described hot baths in the geographical introduction to the Ecclesiastical History in terms very similar to those of Nennius. King Offa of Mercia gained control of the monastery in 781 and rebuilt the church, which was dedicated to St. Peter.|$|E
500|$|After slaking their thirst from {{a nearby}} stream, the crew {{unloaded}} the James Caird and spent the first night on South Georgia in a cave. The next day, Shackleton announced his intention to walk overland to the Norwegian whaling station at Stromness Bay, {{on the other side}} of the island. The crew were too exhausted, and the James Caird too battered, for Shackleton to consider sailing around the island. [...] The trek to Stromness Bay was [...] and after resting for several days, he, along with Worsley and Tom Crean, set out on 19 May. The interior of South Georgia was mountainous and covered with glaciers. Their map of South Georgia showed only the coastline, and on several occasions, they were forced to backtrack when their route was found to be impassable. After a non-stop trek of 36 hours, the trio reached Stromness Bay and were taken to the manager of the whaling station. He was unable to recognise Shackleton, whom he had met during the expedition's stopover on the island nearly two years previously. [...] After a <b>hot</b> <b>bath</b> and a large meal, Worsley set out on a whaler to collect the three men left behind at King Haakon Bay. That night a strong blizzard struck the island. Had it developed while Worsley and the others were on their trek, it would have likely killed them. [...] They were fortunate the weather had been relatively good for their trek across the island. Later, all three trekkers would talk of a [...] "fourth presence" [...] that accompanied them. [...] In his account of the walk, Worsley would write [...] "...I again find myself counting our party—Shackleton, Crean, and I and—who was the other? Of course, there were only three, but it is strange that in mentally reviewing the crossing we should always think of a fourth, and then correct ourselves." ...|$|E
2500|$|For {{thermoplastic}} moldings {{induction heating}} {{of the core}} metal is required, otherwise the prolonged heat from a <b>hot</b> <b>bath</b> can warp it. Induction heating reduces the melt-out time to one to three minutes. The disadvantage is that induction heating does not remove all of the core material so it must then be finished off in a <b>hot</b> <b>bath</b> or be brushed out. Another disadvantage is that the induction coils must be custom built for each molding because the coils must be [...] from the part. Finally, induction heating systems cannot be used with moldings that have brass or steel inserts because the induction heating process can destroy or oxidize the insert.|$|E

The chiggers may be dislodged, but you will still have the stylostomes, causing the severe itch. Scratching deep to remove stylostomes can cause secondary infections. For temporary relief of itching, apply ointments of benzocaine, hydrocortisone, calamine lotion, New Skin, After Bite, or others recommended by your pharmacist or medical doctor. Some use Vaseline, cold cream, baby oil, or fingernail polish. (The sooner the treatment, the better the results.)....|$|E
