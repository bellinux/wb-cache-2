40|$|The berries of European elder {{are used}} in {{traditional}} German medicine for various complaints. Due to insufficient research data, elderberry fruit was not monographed by the German Commission E {{at the end of}} the last century. A comprehensive review of the literature was conducted to summarize the pharmacological and clinical effects of elderberry fruit. Several databases and other sources were searched to identify in vitro and animal studies, and clinical trials investigating elderberry <b>fruit</b> <b>preparations.</b> For the latter, the level of evidence was evaluated as described previously. Elderberry <b>fruit</b> <b>preparations</b> may provide antioxidant, antiviral and antiproliferative effects in vitro. One animal experiment and one clinical trial were able to back the antioxidative impact in terms of a weak antilipidemic effect. Antibacterial and antiinflammatory effects seem possible, but need further support. In rats, an aqueous elderberry fruit extract produced central depression and analgesia and an ethanol fruit extract improved acetic acid-induced colitis. Several in vitro studies together with two exploratory studies in humans and one open study in chimpanzees indicate that the aqueous elderberry extract SambucolR may be useful for the treatment of viral influenza infections. These promising effects of elderberry <b>fruit</b> <b>preparations</b> from experimental and clinical studies should be backed by more rigorous studies before these preparations are recommended in the prevention of diseases and in treatment schedules...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to gain insight into the effect of food {{formulation}} on aroma release and perception, both of which playing {{an important role in}} food appreciation. The quality and quantity of retronasal aroma released during food consumption affect the exposure time of olfactory receptors to aroma stimuli, which can influence nutritional and hedonic characteristics, as well as consumption behaviors. In yogurts, <b>fruit</b> <b>preparation</b> formulation can be a key factor to modulate aroma stimulation. In this context, the impact of size and hardness of fruit pieces in fat-free pear yogurts was studied. Proton Transfer Reaction-Mass Spectrometry (PTR-MS) was used to allow sensitive and on-line monitoring of volatile odorous compound release in the breath during consumption. In parallel, a trained panel used sensory profile and Temporal Dominance of Sensations (TDS) methods to characterize yogurt sensory properties and their dynamic changes during consumption. Results showed that the size of pear pieces had few effects on aroma release and perception of yogurts, whereas fruit hardness significantly influenced them. Despite the fact that yogurts presented short and similar residence times in the mouth, this study showed that <b>fruit</b> <b>preparation</b> could be an interesting formulation factor to enhance exposure time to stimuli and thus modify food consumption behaviors. These results could be taken into account to formulate new products that integrate both nutritional and sensory criteria...|$|E

Although bromocriptine was more effective to reduce serum prolactin levels into the normal range, the VAC preparation reduced mastalgia and PMS symptoms more efficiently than the synthetic dopamine agonist. While a small number of VAC treated women reported mild side effects (8.3 % experienced headache and 5.8 % nausea), such effects occurred more frequently in the bromocriptine treated women (21 % headache, 15.8 % nausea and 12.3 % constipation).|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} on aromatised fat-free stirred yoghurts and dealt with the influence of some thickeners andsweeteners on aroma compounds release and rheology. Thickeners (starch, pectin, locust bean gum and guar) and sweeteners (fructose, fructo-oligosaccahrides, aspartame andacesulfame) were added and mixed together in <b>fruit</b> <b>preparations,</b> which were then introduced in yoghurt. Different concentrationsof thickeners and sweeteners {{were used in the}} <b>fruit</b> <b>preparations</b> and were obtained with an experimental design. The headspacecomposition was assessed by solid-phase microextraction during shear conditions in a closed vessel. Rheological properties ofyoghurts were determined to obtain the flow behaviour index n and the consistency index K with the Ostwald law. The presence of pectin in yoghurts, tended to reduce the concentration of aroma compounds in the headspace of the samples. Weobserved also a significant decrease of aroma compounds in the headspace of yoghurt in the presence of starch. In the case of locustbean gum, a significant increase of flavour release was observed. Sweeteners and guar appeared to have no effect. We concluded thatrheological parameters did not explain the difference on aroma release and it seemed that during shear conditions, the compositionof <b>fruit</b> <b>preparations</b> showed a major role on aroma release. The influence of aroma compounds characteristics on the flavour releasewas observed, but experiments must be performed to highlight this observation...|$|R

40|$|Anthocyanins {{are one of}} the {{commonly}} used natural colorants for beverages, confectionary, <b>fruit</b> <b>preparation</b> and ice cream. Strong antioxidant activity of these anthocyanins has attracted great interest to the food industry. The instability of anthocyanins through the factors such as light, pH, temperature and oxygen has given problem during processing and storage of these compounds. One of the approaches to overcome this problem is by encapsulating the material using wall material. This study was conducted to investigate the efficiency of encapsulation of anthocyanins from red dragon fruit (Hylocereus polyrhizus (Weber) Britton & Rose) using microwave-assisted technique with different drying times and thermal stability of the encapsulated anthocyanins. Encapsulated anthocyanins were produced in form of powder using maltodextrin as the wall material. The encapsulation drying time were varied from 1 min to 3 min with fixed power, 330 W. The encapsulated anthocyanins were analyzed in effect of thermal heating (60 °C and 80 °C). The results indicated that, at different encapsulation drying time, 2 min capsule showed the highest yield of encapsulation where 3 min capsule showed the highest encapsulation efficiency followed by 2 min capsule with 4 % differences. From this study the encapsulation at 2 min drying time showed the most feasible encapsulation process. Thermal study at 60 °C and 80 °C showed that anthocyanins degraded faster at higher temperature, 80 °C for all capsule types...|$|E

In theoretical part individual low-molecular weight antioxidants and enzymes are described. The main causes of fruit decay and some possibilities of fruit preservation and storage are summarized. As biological material some common fruits were chosen - green and red apples, peaches, plums and white grapes. The fruits were stored in laboratory, cellar, in refrigerator and in freezer. In freezing experiments some ways of <b>fruit</b> <b>preparation</b> and processing were tested and their influence on fruit antioxidant status was compared. Shortened storage experiment was applied on blueberries, cranberries, raspberries and strawberries too. In fruits some group parameters – total antioxidant status, dry mass content, ascorbate level, total flavonoids and total phenolics were analyzed spectrophotometrically. Individual flavonoids and phenolics were determined by RP-HPLC/UV-VIS and on-line LC/PDA/ESI-MS. Antioxidant enzyme activities (superoxide dismutase SOD, catalase CAT, polyphenol oxidase PPO and lipoxygenase LOX) were measured by spectrophotometry. The surface microscopy and cultivation of moulds from fruit surface were performed too. Influence of storage conditions on biological activities is dependent on fruit sort. Freezing is the most suitable procedure for long-term storage without significant changes of active substance content. Long-term storage in controlled temperature conditions and/or atmosphere is usable for fruits with longer storage period. In these fruits stabile levels of antioxidant enzymes are stored for relatively long time. Some of enzymes act synergistically. Enzyme activities differed according to storage phase; at the beginning mainly high SOD and LOX activities were observed. CAT and PPO are probably activated as defence systems in rippened and/or damaged fruits. Levels of total {{as well as individual}} low molecular weight antioxidants varied during storage in all sorts, generally, increased course with longer storage period can be observed...|$|E

40|$|Conventional methods often impose {{difficulties}} when {{measuring the}} viscosity of fluids containing particles or fibres, e. g. tomato paste or <b>fruit</b> <b>preparations,</b> mainly {{due to the}} narrow gaps of the viscometer.
