25|$|NEDD4 {{has been}} shown to {{interact}} with and ubiquitinate the tumour suppressor protein PTEN in vitro, resulting in PTEN proteasomal degradation or trafficking. The in vivo role of NEDD4 in PTEN regulation is less clear. There is some evidence from NEDD4 deficient mice that NEDD4 does not target PTEN for degradation or trafficking. However, in other <b>in</b> <b>vivo</b> <b>models,</b> and in many human cancer cell lines, NEDD4 does appear responsible for the degradation of PTEN. NEDD4 regulation of PTEN may only occur in specific biological contexts.|$|E
25|$|Given the {{constant}} threat of bioterrorist related events, {{there is an}} urgent need to develop pulmonary protective and reparative agents {{that can be used}} by first responders in a mass casualty setting. Use in such a setting would require administration via a convenient route for e.g. intramuscular via epipens. Other feasible routes of administration could be inhalation and perhaps to a lesser extent oral – swallowing can be difficult in many forms of injury especially if accompanied by secretions or if victim is nauseous. A number of in vitro and <b>in</b> <b>vivo</b> <b>models</b> lend themselves to preclinical evaluation of novel pulmonary therapies.|$|E

A multiple baseline design across five children and within child across the two modeling conditions (video and <b>in</b> <b>vivo)</b> and across tasks was used. Each child was presented two similar tasks from his or her curriculum; one task was used for the video condition, while the other was used for the <b>in</b> <b>vivo</b> condition. Video <b>modeling</b> consisted of each child watching a videotape of models performing the target behavior, whereas <b>in</b> <b>vivo</b> <b>modeling</b> consisted of the children observing live models perform the target behavior. After the observations, children were tested for acquisition and generalization of target behaviors. Results suggest that video modeling led to faster acquisition of tasks than <b>in</b> <b>vivo</b> <b>modeling</b> and was effective in promoting generalization.

Several other studies, however, have indicated absence of estrogenic effects and compounds in black cohosh-containing materials. Recent findings suggest {{that some of the}} clinically relevant physiological effects of black cohosh may be due to [...] compounds that bind and activate serotonin receptors, and a derivative of serotonin with high affinity to serotonin receptors, Nω-methylserotonin, has been identified in black cohosh.

2500|$|Test {{articles}} passing muster {{in vitro}} can be evaluated {{in a number}} of <b>in</b> <b>vivo</b> <b>models</b> (usually in mice) of ALI including chlorine inhalation, intratracheal instillation of bleomycin and in transforming growth factor β1 (TGF β1) overexpressing transgenic mice exposed to high dose doxycycline. Acute exposure to high concentrations of chlorine gas induces pathological and functional changes in the lungs of rodents. Histological changes consist of epithelial necrosis and detachment, increase in the area of smooth muscle, epithelial regeneration and mucous cell hyperplasia. Most of these abnormalities resolve with time. Functional changes (increased RL and/or bronchial responsiveness to inhaled methacholine) last for mean intervals of 3 and 7 days after exposure, but can persist up to 30 and 90 days, respectively. The functional changes are related to the overall abnormal airway epithelial damage and there is a significant correlation between RL and bronchoalveolar lavage ( [...] BAL) neutrophilia. Bleomycin is an antineoplastic antibiotic drug isolated in 1966 from the actinomycete Streptomyces verticillus. Bleomycin forms a complex with oxygen and metals such as Fe2+, leading to the production of oxygen radicals, DNA breaks, and ultimately cell death. Doxycycline driven overexpression of TGF β1 in the lungs of transgenic mice result in a time-dependent inflammatory response characterized by massive infiltration of F4/80+ monocytic/macrophage-like cells and a wave of apoptotic pulmonary cell death. Mice that survive this initial onslaught go on to demonstrate an increase in lung collagen content, and decreased lung compliance. A large animal model of ALI is the ovine model of body surface burn + heated smoke inhalation. It has been established that combined burn and smoke inhalation injury impairs hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV), the vasoconstrictive response to hypoxia, thereby mismatching ventilation with perfusion. Gas exchange is affected by increases in the dispersion of both alveolar ventilation and cardiac output because bronchial and vascular functions are altered by injury-related factors, such as the effects of inflammatory mediators on airway and vascular smooth muscle tone. As a rule of thumb, all these models are characterized by high mortality, inflammation of the airways and pulmonary parenchyma, edema and flooding of the alveolar spaces by a proteinaceous exudate, sloughing of the airway and pulmonary epithelium, scarring and transition to airway and pulmonary remodeling.|$|E
