However, in PBMCs, only ECL 2 CCR 5 antibodies HGS 004 and HGS 101, but not 2 D 7, inhibited infection by MVC resistant HIV- 1 more potently with MVC-bound than with free CCR 5. In addition, HGS 004 and HGS 101, but not 2 D 7, restored the antiviral activity of MVC against resistant virus in PBMCs. In flow cytometric studies, CCR 5 binding by the HGS mAbs, but not by 2 D 7, was increased when PBMCs were treated with MVC, suggesting MVC increases exposure of the relevant epitope. Thus, HGS 004 and HGS 101 have antiviral mechanisms distinct from 2 D 7 and could help overcome MVC resistance...|$|R

40|$|We {{examined}} {{the ability of}} dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP), its cleavage products dimethyl sulfide (DMS) and acrylic acid (AA), and the oxidized form of DMS dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), to inhibit infection of Emiliania huxleyi virus 86 (EhV- 86). Infectivity was assessed by plaque assay of viral stock that {{had been exposed to}} these compounds. The initial concentrations of the compounds tested were 250 mmol L- 1 for DMSP, DMS, and AA, and 14 mmol L- 1 for DMSO. These are the maximum concentrations thought to occur in E. huxleyi and therefore the highest EhV- 86 might encounter. DMSP and DMSO had no effect on EhV- 86; however, both DMS and AA diminished viral titers. Further experiments established that both DMS and AA significantly reduced titers from a concentration of 100 mmol L- 1 and that they <b>had</b> a <b>greater</b> <b>antiviral</b> effect when applied in combination. The DMSP system in algae could function as a chemical defense against viral infection that would benefit the surviving cells in the population by reducing infective titers of progeny viruses and therefore decreasing the probability of infection of further cells...|$|R

40|$|The {{interferon}} (IFN) -related cytokine interleukin (IL) - 29 (also {{known as}} IFN-λ 1) inhibits virus replication by inducing a cellular antiviral response {{similar to that}} activated by IFN-α/β. However, because it binds to a unique receptor, this cytokine may function cooperatively with IFN-α/β or IFN-γ during natural infections to inhibit virus replication, and might also be useful therapeutically {{in combination with other}} cytokines to treat chronic viral infections such as hepatitis C (HCV). We therefore investigated the ability of IL- 29 and IFN-α or IFN-γ to cooperatively inhibit virus replication and induce antiviral gene expression. Compared with the individual cytokines alone, the combination of IL- 29 with IFN-α or IFN-γ was more effective at blocking vesicular stomatitis virus and HCV replication, and this cooperative antiviral activity correlated with the magnitude of induced antiviral gene expression. Although the combined effects of IL- 29 and IFN-α were primarily additive, the IL- 29 /IFN-γ combination synergistically induced multiple genes and <b>had</b> the <b>greatest</b> <b>antiviral</b> activity. Two different mechanisms contributed to the enhanced gene expression induced by the cytokine combinations: increased activation of ISRE promoter elements and simultaneous activation of both ISRE and GAS elements within the same promoter.

40|$|We {{previously}} {{found that}} scavenger receptor cysteine-rich gp- 340 (glycoprotein- 340), isolated from lung or saliva, directly inhibits human IAVs (influenza A viruses). We now show that salivary gp- 340 has broad antiviral activity against human, equine and porcine IAV strains. Although lung and salivary gp- 340 are identical in protein sequence, salivary gp- 340 from one donor <b>had</b> significantly <b>greater</b> <b>antiviral</b> activity against avian-like IAV strains which preferentially bind sialic acids in α(2, 3) linkage. A greater density of α(2, 3) -linked sialic acids was {{present on the}} salivary gp- 340 from this donor as compared with salivary gp- 340 from another donor or several preparations of lung gp- 340. Hence, the specificity of sialic acid linkages on gp- 340 is an important determinant of anti-IAV activity. Gp- 340 binds to SP-D (surfactant protein D), and we previously showed that lung gp- 340 has co-operative interactions with SP-D in viral neutralization and aggregation assays. We now report that salivary gp- 340 can, in some cases, strongly antagonize certain antiviral activities of SP-D. This effect was associated with greater binding of salivary gp- 340 to the carbohydrate recognition domain of SP-D {{as compared with the}} binding of lung gp- 340. These findings may relate to inter-individual variations in innate defence against highly pathogenic IAV and to effects of aspiration of oral contents on SP-D-mediated lung functions...|$|R

In this study, we synthesized a series of alkoxyalkyl esters of CDV or cyclic CDV with alkyl chains from 8 to 24 atoms and having linker moieties of glycerol, propanediol, and ethanediol. We also synthesized alkyl esters of CDV which lack the linker to determine if the alkoxyalkyl linker moiety is required for activity. The new compounds were evaluated in vitro against HCMV and murine CMV (MCMV). CDV or cyclic CDV analogs both with and without linker moieties were highly active against HCMV and MCMV, and their activities were strongly dependent on chain length. The most active compounds had 20 atoms esterified to the phosphonate of CDV. Both alkoxypropyl and alkyl esters of CDV provided enhanced antiviral activities against CMV in vitro. Thus, the oxypropyl linker moiety is not required for enhanced activity. CDV analogs having alkyl ethers linked to glycerol or ethanediol linker groups also demonstrated increased activity against CMV...|$|R
40|$|Reverse {{transcription}} is {{an important}} early step in retrovirus replication and is a key point targeted by evolutionarily conserved host restriction factors (e. g., APOBEC 3 G, SamHD 1). Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) reverse transcriptase (RT) is a major target of antiretroviral drugs, and concerns regarding drug resistance and off-target effects have led to continued ef-forts for identifying novel approaches to targeting HIV- 1 RT. Several observations, including those obtained frommonocyte-derived macrophages, have argued that ribonucleotides and their analogs can, intriguingly, impact reverse transcription. For example, we have previously demonstrated that 5 -azacytidine <b>has</b> its <b>greatest</b> <b>antiviral</b> potency during reverse transcription by enhancement of G-to-C transversionmutations. In the study described here, we investigated a panel of ribonucleoside analogs {{for their ability to}} affect HIV- 1 replication during the reverse transcription process. We discovered five ribonucleosides— 8 -azaadenosine, formycin A, 3 -deazauridine, 5 -fluorocytidine, and 2 =-C-methylcytidine—that possess anti-HIV- 1 activity, and one of these (i. e., 3 -deazauridine) has a primary antiviral mechanism that involves increased HIV- 1 mutational loads, while quanti-tative PCR analysis determined that the others resulted in premature chain termination. Taken together, our findings provide the first demonstration of a series of ribonucleoside analogs that can target HIV- 1 reverse transcription with primary antiretro-viral mechanisms that include premature termination of viral DNA synthesis or enhanced viral mutagenesis. Retroviruses are RNA viruses that replicate through a DNA in-termediate (1, 2). Reverse transcription is an essential step in retroviral replication, and evolutionarily conserved host restric...|$|R
40|$|Surfactant protein D (SP-D) plays {{important}} roles in innate defense against respiratory viruses [including influenza A viruses (IAVs) ]. Truncated trimers composed of its neck and carbohydrate recognition domains (NCRDs) bind various ligands; however, they have minimal inhibitory activity for IAV. We have sought {{to find ways to}} increase the antiviral activity of collectin NCRDs. Cross-linking of the SP-D NCRD with nonblocking monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) markedly potentiates antiviral activity. In the present report, we demonstrate that F(ab’) 2 [but not F(ab’) 1] fragments of a cross-linking mAb have similar effects. Hence, cross-linking activity, but not the Fc domain of the mAb, is needed for increased antiviral activity. In contrast, the Fc domain of the mAb was important for increasing viral uptake or respiratory burst responses of human neutrophils. Our NCRD constructs contain an S protein binding site. Herein, we show that a multivalent S protein complex caused cross-linking and also increased the antiviral activity of NCRDs. NCRDs of conglutinin and CL 43 <b>had</b> <b>greater</b> intrinsic <b>antiviral</b> activity than those of SP-D or mannose-binding lectin. Based on motifs found in these serum collectins, we have constructed mutant versions of the human SP-D NCRD that have increased antiviral activity. These mutant NCRDs also had potentiated activity after cross-linking with F(ab’) 2 fragments or S protein complexes. Hence, the antiviral activity of NCRDs can be increased by 2 distinct, complementary strategies, namely cross-linking of NCRDs through various means and mutagenesis of CRD residues to increase viral binding. These findings may be relevant for antiviral therapy...|$|R

Five supramolecular co-crystals, viz. nevirapine-saccharin (NVSC), nevirapine-DL-tartaric acid (NVTTA), nevirapine-maleic acid (NVMLE), nevirapine-glutaric acid (NVGLT) and nevirapine-salicylic acid (NVSLI) were reproduced and confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD). A pre-formulation study ensued to identify the most appropriate co-former candidate to formulate a tablet dosage form comparative to the proprietor brand, Viramune®. The co-crystals were synthesized by the co-precipitation and solvent-drop grinding techniques and identified by hot stage microscopy (HSM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), fourier transform infra-red spectrophotometry (FTIR), PXRD and single X-ray diffraction (SXRD). The solubility, dissolution and antiviral activity profiles of these co-crystals were assessed and compared to pure NV and NV:co-former mixtures in a 1 : 1 ratio. The preliminary dissolution analysis applied the BP 2005 rotating-basket method with water as dissolution medium. Initially, the dissolution samples were assayed with UV/VIS spectrophotometry {{which led to a}} more convincing quantitative approach where dissolution samples were assayed by HPLC. Solubility data revealed a fivefold increase in solubility of NV co-crystallized with maleic acid. Dissolution data, however revealed NVGLT as the best performing co-crystal with a 59 % NV drug release in water (dissolution media) with the remaining 4 co-crystals all indicating an enhanced aqueous solubility of NV. The antiviral activity of all 5 co-crystals performed by the National Institute of Communicable Diseases of South Africa determined whether the co-crystals had an improved antiviral activity against HIV- 1 compared to pure NV. The results indicated that NVSC and NVSLI <b>had</b> the <b>greatest</b> <b>antiviral</b> activity compared to pure NV and the remaining co-crystals. The pre-formulation results formed the basis for the selection of the best co-former candidate for a NV co-crystal tablet formulation by direct compression. All solid dosage form quality control tests according to the USP 364 was performed on the prototype co-crystal tablet and the Viramune® tablet. Comparative dissolution analysis to evaluate bioequivalence was conducted and assayed by HPLC. The dissolution analysis utilized 3 media, viz. HCl buffer (pH 1. 2), acetate buffer (pH 4. 5) and a phosphate buffer (pH 6. 8) which displayed no similarity in the dissolution profile of the prototype and the proprietor brand. Solution stability of NV in these buffered media was assessed after 4 weeks exposure of the dissolution samples to cold chain (2 - 8 °C, 0 % RH) and accelerated environmental conditions (40 °C, 75 % RH). The results indicated no significant degradation of NV in the prototype co-crystal tablet and the proprietor brand during the accelerated stability tests.

40|$|Beginning with 3 -cyclopenten- 1 -ylamine hydrochloride, the 5 '-nor {{derivatives}} of carbocyclic 2 '-deoxyguanosine (2), 2 '-deoxyadenosine (3), and 2, 6 -diaminopurine 2 '-deoxyribofuranoside (4) {{have been}} prepared. These compounds were evaluated for <b>antiviral</b> <b>potential</b> versus herpes simplex virus, varicella-zoster virus, cytomegalovirus, vaccinia virus, vesicular stomatitis virus, and {{human immunodeficiency virus}} and found to lack activity. Also, compounds 2 - 4 were virtually nontoxic toward the host (human diploid fibroblast ESM and HEL) cells. These biological properties {{may be due to}} the inability of 2 - 4 to be phosphorylated to the requisite nucleotide level that is likely to be necessary for biological activity by correlation to carbocyclic 2 '-deoxyguanosine (1), which possesses significant antiviral properties as a result of conversion to its 5 '-triphosphate derivative. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{very first}} TSAO {{derivative}} that lacks the 4 ''-amino {{group at the}} 3 '-spiro moiety (compound 3) has been prepared {{and the effect of}} this modification on the activity/resistance profile has been evaluated. This molecule proved HIV- 1 specific (NNRTI-characteristic). A mixture of wild-type and V 106 V/A or L 234 L/I mutations were found in the RT of some, but not all compound 3 -resistant virus strains. Compound 3 does not select for the TSAO-specific E 138 K mutation in the RT. However, the compound markedly lost its <b>antiviral</b> <b>potential</b> against a variety of virus strains that contain NNRTI-characteristic mutations in RT including E 138 K. The deaminated TSAO compound must fit differently in the HIV- 1 RT enzyme than its prototype TSAO-m(3) T. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{frequent}} {{emergence of}} new influenza viruses in the human population underlines {{the urgent need for}} antiviral therapeutics in addition to the preventative vaccination against the seasonal flu. To circumvent the development of resistance, recent antiviral approaches target cellular proteins needed by the virus for efficient replication. We investigated the contribution of the small GTPase Rac 1 to the replication of influenza viruses. Inhibition of Rac 1 by NSC 23766 resulted in impaired replication {{of a wide variety of}} influenza viruses, including a human virus strain of the pandemic from 2009 as well as highly pathogenic avian virus strains. Furthermore, we identified a crucial role of Rac 1 for the activity of the viral polymerase complex. The <b>antiviral</b> <b>potential</b> of NSC 23766 was confirmed in mouse experiments, identifying Rac 1 as a ne...|$|R

40|$|Viral-induced {{infectious}} diseases represent a major health threat and their control remains an unachieved goal, {{due in part}} to the limited availability of effective anti-viral drugs and measures. The use of natural products in drug manufacturing is an ancient and well-established practice. Marine organisms are known producers of pharmacological and anti-viral agents. In this study, a total of 20 extracts from marine microorganisms were evaluated for their antiviral activity. These extracts were tested against two mammalian viruses, herpes simplex virus (HSV- 1) and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), using Vero cells as the cell culture system, and two marine virus counterparts, channel catfish virus (CCV) and snakehead rhabdovirus (SHRV), in their respective cell cultures (CCO and EPC). Evaluation of these extracts demonstrated that some possess <b>antiviral</b> <b>potential.</b> In sum, extracts 162 M(4), 258 M(1), 298 M(4), 313 (2), 331 M(2), 367 M(1) and 397 (1) appear to be effective broad-spectrum <b>antivirals</b> with <b>potential</b> uses as prophylactic agents to prevent infection, as evident by their highly inhibitive effects against both virus types. Extract 313 (2) shows the most potential in that it showed significantly high inhibition across all tested viruses. The samples tested in this study were crude extracts; therefore the development of antiviral application of the few potential extracts is dependent on future studies focused on the isolation of the active elements contained in these extracts.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Integrase (IN) inhibitors are {{the newest}} class of {{antiretroviral}} agents {{developed for the}} treatment of HIV- 1 infections. Merck’s Raltegravir (RAL) (October 2007) and Gilead’s Elvitegravir (EVG) (August 2012), which act as IN strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs), were the first anti-IN drugs to be approved by the FDA. However, the virus develops resistance to both RAL and EVG, and there is extensive cross-resistance to these two drugs. New “ 2 nd-generation ” INSTIs are needed that will <b>have</b> <b>greater</b> efficacy against RAL- and EVG-resistant strains of IN. The FDA has recently approved the first second generation INSTI, GSK’s Dolutegravir (DTG) (August 2013). Our current article describes the design, synthesis, and evaluation of a series of 1, 8 -dihydroxy- 2 -oxo- 1, 2 -dihydroquinoline- 3 -carboxamides, 1, 4 -dihydroxy- 2 -oxo- 1, 2 -dihydro- 1, 8 -naphthyridine- 3 -carboxamides, and 1 -hydroxy- 2 -oxo- 1, 2 -dihydro- 1, 8 -naphthyridine- 3 -carboxamides. This resulted in the identification of noncytotoxic inhibitors that exhibited single digit nanomolar EC 50 values against HIV- 1 vectors harboring wild-type IN in cell-based assays. Importantly, some of these new inhibitors retain <b>greater</b> <b>antiviral</b> efficacy compared to that of RAL when tested against a panel of IN mutants that included Y 143 R, N 155 H, G 140 S/Q 148 H, G 118 R, and E 138 K/Q 148 K.
