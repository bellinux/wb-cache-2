2500|$|In August 2011 Ash {{collaborated with}} We Are Scientists {{to release a}} cover of the song [...] "Washington Parks" [...] by British {{songwriter}} Robert Manning, raising money and awareness for Multiple Sclerosis and The MS Society. The song was recorded between London and New York by the two bands and join a project already boasting releases from Ed Hardcourt and Emmy the Great. Chris Cain from We Are Scientists {{said in an interview}} [...] "We actually recorded a single [...] which <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> soon. It won't be too long until it's out and it's for a charity in England called the Multiple Sclerosis Society. It's a cover of a song called [...] "Washington Parks" [...] by I think Happy Monster but it's pretty sweet. The concept of the song is that if you listen to it on headphones or stereo the musicians of Ash are on the left channel and all the We Are Scientists guys are playing it in the right channel. We're playing the same song essentially but in different ways. I'm not playing the same bass line as Mark and Rick isn't playing the same drum pattern as Andy. I think Keith and Tim sing the same thing but in a different sort of harmony. What's interesting especially is that not only do we have a unison feel going on but you can also take off one headphone and hear one band and vice versa." ...|$|E

Of course, we have won some victories with ordinary pitchers, but the moment I heard that you had taken to twirling the sphere, I said to all my friends; 'This is the year that Brill <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> on top.' My dear Tubbs, I {{think we ought to}} get down on our knees, and thank you for doing this much for our college. I am sure the board of directors, when they hear of this, will certainly give you a vote of thanks, because success in baseball and other athletic sports is what makes a college in these days.

6000|$|An optimistic {{friend of}} mine tells me not to worry myself; tells me that it <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> all right in the end. Woman just now, he contends, is passing through her college period. The school life of strict {{surveillance}} is for ever done with. She is now the young Freshwoman. The bothering lessons are over, the bothering schoolmaster she has said good-bye to. She has her latchkey and is [...] "on her own." [...] There are still some bothering rules about being in at twelve o'clock, and so many attendances each term at chapel. She is indignant. This interferes with her idea that life is to be one long orgie of self-indulgence, of pleasure. The college period will pass--is passing. Woman will {{go out into the}} world, take her place there, discover that bothers were not left behind in the old schoolhouse, will learn that life has duties, responsibilities, will take up her burden side by side with man, will accomplish her destiny.|$|E

5000|$|Hornby {{has also}} {{developed}} {{a career as a}} screenwriter, and has said that he enjoys the challenge of working in film as opposed to writing novels.

5000|$|... "The Last Song" [...] {{begins with}} the sound of a radio in mid-tune, {{followed}} by a string arrangement that slips into a chugging guitar line {{with the help of an}} electronic segue. Ritter doesn't really know how or why he and Wheeler came up with the distinct structure that's unlike anything else on the album. [...] "it just comes out of nowhere," [...] and [...] "when two songwriters get into the studio, you don't know what the hell <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>out.</b> It's just one of the many surprises, like stuttering electronic beats, flourishes of majestic organs and a dance-inspired thump, that pepper the album." ...|$|E

There will be kids there who are fans of my electric guitar playing, and you see them there scratching their heads.But its something that I enjoy doing. I look at it more as an extension of my politics. Then again, some of the songs are not explicitly political. It really helped me grow as an artist and songwriter.
