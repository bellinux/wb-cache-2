40|$|New {{postgraduate}} students {{embark on}} their research journey typically {{with little or}} no <b>experience</b> <b>in</b> <b>doing</b> <b>research.</b> Supervisors and other more experienced student researchers might help them to find their feet during the first few weeks of their research by sharing their own experience of how they solved similar problems during their research. In this way each novice researcher can learn and benefit from other researchers´ ways of resolving problems. This paper discusses the real concerns that researchers reflected upon during a two-day research workshop, where researchers share problems, exchange ideas for overcoming them and learn from each other´s experiences of conducting research. The output from the workshop {{is in the form of}} hints and tips that can guide novice researchers when faced with initial problems. The paper can also be used by a department to induct a novice researcher into their environment...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThere {{is a need}} {{to prepare}} {{doctoral}} students with research skills before and during their research work at graduate level, especially in the writing of their thesis. Too often faculty assumed graduate students are prepared for embarking research, especially in using library or seeking knowledge through the use of information technology, the writing of the dissertation, to conduct literature review and the analysis or method of processing data. This paper will report the findings of a study regarding the preparedness of doctoral students to embark on their research studies. It was found that Graduate students generally felt they have yet to acquire the level of research skills in seeking information for their research and are deficient in analytical skills. Some of them have only attained low level information seeking skills, but they need higher level information skills to conduct a PhD research study. Most of them have no <b>experience</b> <b>in</b> <b>doing</b> <b>research</b> prior to their study, and thus require training, such as on analytical skills in processing data. Based on the above findings, a number of recommendations in overcoming these problems are provided in order to improve graduation time and the quality of students doctoral research. © 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd...|$|E
40|$|Rationale: Medical {{education}} research of communication {{in health care}} brings together two worlds of science. Like research on medical communication, research on medical education began just over three decades ago[1, 2]. While communication research is centred around care providers and patients and processes of care and outcomes, {{education research}} adds the student or trainee and teacher perspective, including educational processes and outcomes. The workshop aims to introduce participants, who have an interest and some <b>experience</b> <b>in</b> <b>doing</b> <b>research</b> on education of medical communication, into basic theoretical and methodological concepts of both fields. The workshop aims to meet personal interests of the participants as much as possible. Learning Objectives: • Making participants familiar with specific aspects related to researching medical education about communicating skills (e. g. context specificity, theoretical models, educational interventions, assessment, outcome measures, …) • Making participants experience the consecutive steps from formulating a research question and selecting an appropriate research design • Exchanging experiences and expertise with other participants Teaching Methods: Plenary work:: • 10 min: Introduction and gathering the expectations from participants • 20 min : Presentation of key concepts and theories of medical education research of communication Small group work: • 20 min : Formulating a research question Creative brainstorming about formulating research questions and assessing it’s quality • 20 min: Choosing the adequate method(s) for the research question Addressing the specific aspects related to medical education research about communication skills, sampling, blueprinting, data gathering methods, data analysis methods, relevant outcome measures and how to measure these (validity, reliability, context specificity,…) Evaluation: 20 min: Presenting results of small group work Preferred maximum number of participants: 20 References: [1] Norman G.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{organised}} {{as a case}} study of two rural local communities in Nord-Trøndelag, Inderøy and Frosta, and explores cultural entrepreneurship in a perspective of geographical local and regional development. The background for the thesis is the claim that the opportunities and limitations for entrepreneurship and innovation latently exists in space and place – and in people. In this thesis, to do research on cultural entrepreneurship in a rural Norwegian context, is {{to find out more about}} how one can use what is already in place of resources in new ways within cultural- and experience industries. This can provide part of the solution to difficult challenges with an economic stem, which the Norwegian society currently faces. An example of such a challenge is What will we do when the oil runs out in Norwegian areas? This thesis attempts to provide a nuanced reasoning which argues that such challenges must be met in different ways, and using what is already in place of resources alongside cultural entrepreneurship could be one of the ways in which to meet them. How such entrepreneurial ideas arise and develop in conjunction with motivation, collaboration and knowledge bases, as well as participants and structures, is the core of this thesis. On this basis, it has been particularly interesting to find out whether different aspects and experiences of the development of a successful cultural entrepreneurial project can be extrapolated and implemented on other conceivable cultural entrepreneurial development projects. For this reason, the most important keywords in this study are entrepreneurship, innovation, regional and local development and cultural- and experience industries. The analytical component of this thesis, and the results it discovered, demonstrates that knowledge sharing between cultural entrepreneurs is especially important in order to succeed with cultural entrepreneurship projects. There is also a need to develop a collaborative culture between the cultural entrepreneurs. In addition, the cultural entrepreneurs need to collaborate with the public sector, relevant organisations, and most important of all: The rural local community. Furthermore, the entrepreneurs need to be open and positive towards the rural local community, thusly contributing to a stimulating and innovative process in the community itself. This thesis is based on a qualitative study. The research challenges in this study refer to interpreting the statements of the informants as well as theoretical approaches. In other words, the challenges have lain in unifying real life with acknowledged theory, without making the research intersubjective. Thorough analytical work in the gradual-deductive inductive Method (stegvis-deduktiv induktiv metode) made this case study very interesting and educational work indeed, considering not only its thesis statement and research hypothesis, but also as an <b>experience</b> <b>in</b> <b>doing</b> <b>research...</b>|$|E

40|$|Why should {{researchers}} {{be interested}} in their feelings and emotions as they carry out research? Emotion {{is what it is}} to exist, to be human, and is present in every sphere of our lives. All activities are infused with emotion, even those that are constructed as ‘rational’, because rationality and emotionality are interpenetrated and entwined because all thinking is tinged with feeling, and all feeling is tinged with thinking. This book illuminates the emotional processes of doing social and organizational research, and the implications of this for the outcomes of research. With contributions from leading academics and research practitioners, it addresses the significant issue of the sometimes intense emotional <b>experiences</b> involved <b>in</b> <b>doing</b> <b>research</b> and the implications it has for the theory and practice of social research. By examining the nature of feelings and emotions, it explores how we might understand researchers’ emotions and experiences, and considers the often powerful feelings encountered in a variety of research contexts. Topics discussed include: power relations; psycho-social explanations of researcher emotions; paradoxical relations with research participants and the sometimes disturbing data that is gained; research supervision; the politics of research; gender; publishing, undergoing vivas and presenting at conferences. This book will therefore be a valuable companion to researchers and research students from the start of their career onwards...|$|R
40|$|The {{impact of}} a {{negative}} initial entrepreneurship experience may inhibit {{the emergence of an}} entrepreneurial identity and shut down a subsequent entrepreneurial career.

40|$|Mainstream {{transitional}} justice and peacebuilding practices tend to re-entrench gendered hierarchies by ignoring women or circumscribing their presence to passive victims {{in need of}} protection. As a consequence we have limited knowledge about the multifaceted ways women do justice and build peace.

The conceptual work that we undertake is underpinned by empirical mapping of the {{transitional justice}} spaces in post-conflict Bosnia-Herzegovina, where we point out instances of critical, creative, and transformative agency performed by women that challenge or negotiate patterns of gendered relations of domination. We collect women's oral narratives and explore new sets of questions to capture women's unique <b>experiences</b> <b>in</b> <b>doing</b> justice. Such <b>research</b> enables us to engage with the subjects of post-conflict peacebuilding and transitional justice processes directly and in their own spaces.

40|$|Our {{personal}} information, habits, {{likes and}} dislikes can be all deduced from our mobile devices. Safeguarding mobile privacy is therefore of great concern. Transparency and individual control are bedrock principles of privacy but making informed choices about which mobile apps to use {{has been shown to}} be difficult. In order to understand the dynamics of information collection in mobile apps and to demonstrate the value of transparent access to the details of mobile applications information access permissions, we have gathered information about 528, 433 apps on Google Play, and analyzed the permissions requested by each app. We develop a quantitative measure of the risk posed by apps by devising a ‘sensitivity score’ to represent the number of occurrences of permissions that read personal information about users where network communication is possible. We found that 54 % of apps do not access any personal data. The remaining 46 % collect between 1 to 20 sensitive permissions and have the ability to transmit it outside the phone. The sensitivity of apps differs greatly between free and paid apps as well as between categories and content rating. Sensitive permissions are often mixed with a large amount of low-risk permissions and hence are difficult to identify. Easily available sensitivity scores could help users making more informed decision about choosing an app that could pose less risk in collecting personal information. Even though an app is “self-described” to be suitable for a certain subset of users (i. e children) it might contain content ratings and permission requests that are not appropriate or expected. Our <b>experience</b> <b>in</b> <b>doing</b> this <b>research</b> shows that it is difficult to obtain information about how personal data collected from apps is used or analyzed. In fact only 0. 37 % (1, 991) of the collected apps show to have declared a “privacy policy”. Therefore, in order to make real control available to mobile users, apps distribution platforms should provide more detailed information about how their data if accessed is used. To achieve greater transparency and individual control, apps distribution platforms which do not currently make raw permission description accessible for analysis could change their design and operating policies to make this data available prior to installation...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{engages with}} critical realism to reassess {{the meaning of}} the dwelling for physically disabled individuals. Much of the existing literature on experiences of the dwelling for physically disabled individuals has explored functional design issues. <b>In</b> <b>doing</b> so a homogenous view of {{the meaning of the}} dwelling has been presented, one that has largely neglected the influences of both agency and physiology. To remedy this neglect this research seeks to explore the possibility for difference in the meaning of the dwelling and <b>in</b> <b>doing</b> so move beyond the explanations presented in the past. Drawing on the data generated through life history interviews with nineteen individuals {{with a wide range of}} physically disabilities, this thesis explores the range of events that can affect the meaning of the dwelling for physically disabled individuals. Moreover, by developing a critical understanding of critical realism, over the course of the thesis an analytical framework will be developed; a framework that can help explain the experiences of the nineteen participants in a non-reductionist fashion. Principally, this framework will highlight the impossibility of reducing experiences to just one cause and assert the need to recognise that a combination of structures, mechanisms and events co-determine the meaning of the dwelling. By taking an epistemological position influenced by critical realism it becomes possible to acknowledge experiential diversity in the form of: episodic issues; type of impairment; biographical accomplishment; emotional attachments; impact of care services etc. without disregarding all important issues of design or homogenising <b>experiences.</b> <b>In</b> <b>doing</b> so this <b>research</b> not only makes a contribution to the meaning of the home literature, but to disability and housing studies in general...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The goal of {{the study}} was to {{understand}} farmer literacy practices, and how farmer participants perceive the usefulness of Farmer Water School (FWS) training. Studying the farmer literacy practices was to help identify farmer friendly methods, and design effective messages for dissemination on crop choices, decisions, and sustainable groundwater management. To understand the usefulness of FWS training to farmers, a comparative study of FWS participants and non-FWS pa 11 icipants 2 ̆ 7 perceptions on crop-water management, crop choices, and agriculture practices was undertaken. The study focused on the farmers of Kurnool district of Andhra Pradesh, India. The research questions driving this study included: 1. How do farmers use literacy for crop-water management and crop choice ? 2. How do farmer completing the Farmer Water School training view the usefulness of information they learned about groundwater management? 3. How have farmers adapted the information in their daily lives that they learned in the Farmer Water School training? In Chapter One, I discuss the rationale of the research. I briefly present my <b>experiences</b> of working <b>in</b> two different settings. One, designing and implementing literacy programs for illiterate rural women and second, providing assistance in the implementation of Farmer Water Schools - a participatory approach to groundwater management. I also, discuss my assumptions about literacy and the rationale for undertaking this research. In Chapter Two, I discuss the research context. First, I discuss the literacy scenario in India and the literacy statistics at the national, state and the district level. I also dicuss the Indian agriculture scenario, farmers 2 ̆ 7 increasing dependence on groundwater, changing rainfall patterns, and the need for sustainable management of groundwater. Later on, I present the APF AMGS projects ongoing efforts to enhance the ability of farmers, water user groups, and communities to manage their groundwater resources in a judicious and sustainable manner. In Chapter Three, I discuss the use of case study research, data collection methods, field <b>experiences</b> <b>in</b> <b>doing</b> the <b>research,</b> and my location in the research. In Chapter Four, I use the findings to discuss the research questions. Chapter Five focuses on conclusions and implications. The findings can be summarized as follows: • Farmers use various means to record the transactions. Most of them calculate orally or mentally and can recollect transactions of the entire crop-sea on. Illiterate farmers seek the help of other literate members in their community to cope with the day-to-day needs. •Use of small learning groups in Farmer Water Schools (FWS) appears to have been an effective learning strategy to cope with the varied literacy levels of the farmer participants. • Farmer Water School (FWS) participants reported that they monitor water levels in their borewells and collect rainfall data to forecast water availability. They use this to make informed decisions about crop choices...|$|R
40|$|This thesis aims to {{understand}} {{the ways in which}} migrant people’s belonging is constituted in the contemporary transnationalised world. Through an investigation, based on in-depth interviews and participant observation, of Taiwanese expatriates’ everyday lives in the Yangtze River Delta, China, this research discerns the ways in which migrant belonging is grounded and constituted as part of their border-crossing practices. My analysis considers Taiwanese expatriates’ practices of belonging as outcomes shaped by their interactions in and with place. Therefore, it also contributes to a geographic understanding of migrant belonging. In particular, I foreground the role of place in mediating migrant belonging by attending to the spatiality of migrants’ everyday lives with special regard to their practices in domestic space, workplace and leisure space. In this regard, my research findings also confirm the stickiness of place in contemporary migrants’ activities and counteract the discourse of mobile peoples’ frictionless movement in the borderless world. The empirical study also establishes an understanding of migrant belonging in relation to the politics of identity. It highlights how migrants’ everyday practices of belonging are often informed and shaped by their (negotiations of) identities. As an overseas Chinese group, Taiwanese expatriates’ experiences and negotiations of cultural and ethnic identity integral to their practices of belonging can be considered within the broader scholarship of Chinese diaspora. However, this research challenges the idea of a homogenous Chinese identity through the case study of Taiwanese in Mainland China, drawing attention to the diversity of Chinese identities and how they are practised and <b>experienced.</b> <b>In</b> so <b>doing,</b> this <b>research</b> not only advances the understanding of Chinese transnationalism, but the focus on Taiwanese expatriates’ belonging as situated lived practices also contributes to enrich recent academic writings on the grounded form of transnationalism and middling transnationalism...|$|R
