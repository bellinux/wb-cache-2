5|$|Only {{purebred}} Mérens may {{be registered}} in the breed stud book. The selection of stallions is rigorous, based on tests {{at the age of}} three. The breeding goal is to produce horses with the ideal conformation and good character. The gaits are subject to particular observation in all stallions, and during the three-year-old inspections, they must perform a dressage test, a cross-country jumping test, a test on the longe line and a physical inspection. The Mérens {{has one of the most}} stringent <b>inspection</b> <b>procedures,</b> and breeders aim to achieve a steady increase in the quality of the breed. Mares are evaluated during a breed competition organized by the French National Stud.|$|E

25|$|Under President Lula da Silva (2003–2011), {{the nuclear}} program was revived. INB’s Nuclear Fuel Factory (Fábrica de Combustível Nuclear – FCN), a commercial-scale uranium {{enrichment}} facility, became operational in 2004. However, disagreements between Brazil and the IAEA regarding the <b>inspection</b> <b>procedures</b> delayed the full start of operations. Brazil {{was reluctant to}} grant IAEA inspectors full visual access to its centrifuges, which were hidden by 2-meter (6.6-foot) high panels, as Brazilian authorities argued that a superior centrifuge technology had been developed {{in the country and}} it was necessary to protect these industrial secrets. After months of impasse, Brazil agreed to allow increased – but not full – visual access to the centrifuges and other industrial equipment by reducing the size of the panels covering the machinery. As a member of the Ministry of Science and Technology reportedly said at that time, Brazil was lifting the skirt and lowering the top a little, but retaining its secrets.|$|E

500|$|Some smaller bridges have {{a weight}} limit (or gross weight load rating) {{indicated}} by a sign posted in a visible position {{in front of}} the bridge (hence the reference to a [...] "posted bridge"). These are necessary when the weight limit of the bridge is lower than the federal or state gross weight limit for trucks. Driving a truck over a bridge that is too weak to support it usually does not result in an immediate collapse. The bridge may develop cracks, which over time can weaken the bridge and cause it to collapse. Most of these cracks are discovered during mandated inspections of bridges. Most bridge collapses occur in rural areas, result in few injuries or deaths, and receive relatively little media attention. While the number varies from year to year, as many as 150 bridges can collapse in a year. About 1,500 bridges collapsed between 1966 and 2007, and most of those were the result of soil erosion around bridge supports. In 1987, the Schoharie Creek Bridge collapsed in upstate New York, due to erosion of soil around the foundation, which sparked renewed interest in bridge design in <b>inspection</b> <b>procedures.</b>|$|E

In order to prevent crystals from breaking because of internal residual stress, a quality control system based on optic inspection of interference fringe patterns was developed.
