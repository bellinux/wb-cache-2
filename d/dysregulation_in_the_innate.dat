40|$|Greater than 80 % of malaria-related {{mortality}} {{occurs in}} sub-Saharan Africa due to infections with Plasmodium falciparum. The majority of P. falciparum -related mortality occurs in immune-na&# 239;ve infants and young children, accounting for 18 % of all deaths before {{five years of}} age. Clinical manifestations of severe falciparum malaria vary according to transmission intensity and typically present as one or more life-threatening complications, including: hyperparasitemia; hypoglycemia; cerebral malaria; severe malarial anemia (SMA); and respiratory distress. In holoendemic transmission areas, SMA is the primary clinical manifestation of severe childhood malaria, with cerebral malaria occurring only in rare cases. Mortality rates from SMA can exceed 30 % in pediatric populations residing in holoendemic transmission areas. Since {{the vast majority of}} the morbidity and mortality occurs in immune-na&# 239;ve African children less than five years of age, with SMA as the primary manifestation of severe disease, this review will focus primarily on the innate immune mechanisms that govern malaria pathogenesis in this group of individuals. The pathophysiological processes that contribute to SMA involve direct and indirect destruction of parasitized and non-parasitized red blood cells (RBCs), inefficient and/or suppression of erythropoiesis, and dyserythropoiesis. While all of these causal etiologies may contribute to reduced hemoglobin (Hb) concentrations in malaria-infected individuals, data from our laboratory and others suggest that SMA in immune-na&# 239;ve children is characterized by a reduced erythropoietic response. One important cause of impaired erythroid responses in children with SMA is <b>dysregulation</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>innate</b> immune response. Phagocytosis of malarial pigment hemozoin (Hz) by monocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils is a central factor for promoting dysregulation in innate inflammatory mediators. As such, the role of P. falciparum -derived Hz (Pf Hz) in mediating suppression of erythropoiesis through its ability to cause dysregulation in pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, growth factors, chemokines, and effector molecules is discussed in detail. An improved understanding of the etiological basis of suppression of erythropoietic responses in children with SMA may offer the much needed therapeutic alternatives for control of this global disease burden. </p...|$|E

40|$|International audienceBecause {{cases of}} highly {{pathogenic}} influenza are rare, no systematic clinical studies have evaluated different therapeutic approaches. Instead, treatment recommendations {{are aimed at}} the alleviation of clinical signs and symptoms, especially the restoration of respiratory function, and at the inhibition of virus replication, assuming viral load is responsible for disease phenotype. Studies of highly pathogenic influenza in different animal models, especially nonhuman primates and ferrets, reproduce many of the key observations from clinical cases. Host-response kinetics reveal a delayed but broad activation of genes involved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>innate</b> and acquired immune responses (innate responses produce inflammatory responses), which continue after the virus has been cleared and may contribute importantly to the clinical signs observed.

40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>The</b> <b>innate</b> {{immune system}} is the only defense weapon that {{invertebrates}} have, {{and it is the}} fundamental defense mechanism for fish. <b>The</b> <b>innate</b> immune response is important in newly hatched flounders because it is closely involved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> initial feeding phase, which is why it is essential for survival during the juvenile period. The expression analysis of genes involved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>innate</b> immune response <b>in</b> <b>the</b> olive flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> days after hatching is incomplete. Therefore, we have begun to examine the expression patterns of genes specifically induced during the development of <b>the</b> <b>innate</b> immune system <b>in</b> newly hatched flounders. Microscopic observation showed that pronephron formation corresponded with the expression of perforin-encoding gene. These results suggest that perforin plays a vital role <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>innate</b> immunity of <b>the</b> kidney during developmental stages. Perforin expression was strong {{at the start of the}} development of <b>the</b> <b>innate</b> immune response, and continued throughout all the development stages. Our findings have important implications with respect to perforin’s biological role and the evolution of the first defense mechanisms in olive flounder. Further studies are required to elucidate <b>the</b> perforin-mediated <b>innate</b> immunity response and to decipher the functional role of perforin in developmental stages...|$|R

To improve our knowledge regarding the role of cathelicidin hCAP- 18 /LL 37 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>innate</b> {{immune response}} to tuberculosis infection, we used immunohistochemistry, immunoelectron microscopy, and gene expression to study the induction and production of <b>the</b> antimicrobial peptide <b>in</b> A 549 epithelial cells, alveolar macrophages (AM), neutrophils, and monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) after infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. We demonstrated that mycobacterial infection induced the expression and production of LL- 37 in all cells studied, with AM being the most efficient. We did not detect peptide expression in tuberculous granulomas, suggesting that LL- 37 participates only during early infection. Through the study of Toll-like receptors (TLR) in MDM, we showed that LL- 37 can be induced by stimulation through TLR- 2, TLR- 4, and TLR- 9.
