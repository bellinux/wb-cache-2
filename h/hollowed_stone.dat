50|$|Of that troublous period which {{extended}} {{to the time of}} Charlemagne and later until the beginning of Romanesque art, few monuments remain that give a clear conception of the window architecture then in vogue. According to Haupt's researches, the windows of the earliest Germanic churches had a round arch above, which was generally a <b>hollowed</b> <b>stone.</b> Towards the bottom these windows, strange to say, were frequently somewhat broader than above. It was not unusual in Spain, England, and France to finish the window-casement with a horseshoe arch, the upper part being formed by two stone shafts set obliquely, that is, like ribs of an arch. An example of this method is found at Deerhurst in England. The windows of this period are frequently very different on the inner and outer sides, the richer ornamentation being found on the inner side, as at Saint-Germain-des-Prés in France where there are engaged columns and ornamented archivolts.|$|E

5000|$|One of Elliott's early poems was [...] "Didymus on Saturday". Awarded {{first prize}} in the Newfoundland Arts and Letters Competition in 1954, it {{became one of}} the most anthologized {{contemporary}} Newfoundland poems. In it, Elliott portrays the apostle Thomas's disillusionment the day after the Crucifixion. An apparently simple narrative is complicated by language, which underscores the naked humanity of all the characters, and by point of view, which, in locating the monologue on the day between Christ's death and his resurrection, shows it to be time-limited. Having seen Christ walk to death between two thieves, [...] "A little man whose face was cracked with fear, / And a tall man whose eyes were dull with doom", Thomas is overcome with biting shame for having believed easily. The poem ends in abandonment and despair as Thomas resolves to leave [...] "this gray Jerusalem / where he lies sleeping in the <b>hollowed</b> <b>stone,</b> / Never to come into his kingdom now." ...|$|E
50|$|At {{the top of}} {{the road}} leading up from the lochside, 20 metres past Quarry Road (a single lane road {{accessing}} {{the top of the}} village), attached {{to the top of a}} wall on the left, is a small <b>hollowed</b> <b>stone</b> with a cross incised across its interior. This stone is a font or holy water stone from an ancient chapel, long demolished, dedicated to Saint Ciarán which once stood in or near the village, a probable early Christian site. A bronze plaque attached to the font was commissioned by the Marquess of Breadalbane to explain its history. The four cottages in the picture above are collectively called Dalchiarnan (a corruption of the Gaelic Dal Ciarán or Church of Saint Ciarán) although the second one from the camera is also now referred to as 'Grandad's Cottage' in recognition of its current owner's father who first purchased it as a weekend retreat in 1958.

There can be found there a pillar on three tiers commemorating those of the village lost in service during the world wars. The church has a stained glass window, by J.F. Gascoyne & Son of Nottingham, dedicated in 1920 as a war memorial. There is also a window on the north aisle, east of the north door, depicting the koepe towers and underground workings of Cotgrave Colliery, which was sunk in the 1960s and abandoned in the 1980s.

The following papers were read:— "Further Notes on the Habits of the Tasmanian Aborigines," by Fritz Noetling, M. A., Ph. D. "Notes on the Septum of Trichosurus canina," by Prof. T. T. Flynn, B. Sc. Mr. L. Rodway exhibited a specimen of a fungus new to Tasmania. It was known as Geoglossum hirsutum. and though it had been described from Australia, it had never previously been found in Tasmania. Mr. G. Brettingham-Moore exhibited a <b>hollowed</b> <b>stone,</b> which he thought showed traces of human handiwork. He had found it on Maria Island. Professor Flynn considered that the stone was purely a natural phenomenon, and was not due to human agency. Dr. Noetling exhibited a number of stones which showed traces of glacial action. NOVEMBER 14 th The ordinary monthly {{meeting of the}} Royal Society of Tasmania was held at the Museum last night. The chair was occupied by the President (His Excellency Sir Harry Barron). Application was made by the Field Naturalists' Club for the use of a room at the Museum. Dr. Fritz Noetling read a paper on "Gigantic Marsupials in Tasmania. " Professor T. T. Flynn was to lecture on the "Anatomy of Petanrus soinreus. " A paper entitled "Notes on Duterran's Reconciliation Picture" was read by Dr. Noetling, who said that nobody knew what has become of the picture. As it was a reconciliation between the blacks and whites, it was an extremely interesting one, and of some scientitic value. Mr. J. W. Beattie said that a Mrs. Lodge informed him that she recollected such a picture. There were two, a small one and a very large one. In reply to a question, she informed him that the large one was given to the Government, and was now probably in the vaults of the Legislative Council. Upon inquiry, he ascertained that the small one was framed by Hood's, of Hobart, for Mr. J. Walker, and. old by that gentleman in 1841 for £ 50. The large one, painted by Bock, was framed by the same firm in 1843, and was said to be also in the Legislative Council vaults...|$|E

50|$|According to the 19th century folklorist William Henderson, the dunter or powrie is {{distinct}} from the redcap.

If this sound goes on longer or louder than usual then it is considered an omen of death or misfortune. Popular tradition states that these Border castles were built by the Picts who bathed the foundation stones in human blood which often resulted in such hauntings. The suggestion is that dunters and redcaps may be the spirits of the original foundation sacrifices.|$|R
