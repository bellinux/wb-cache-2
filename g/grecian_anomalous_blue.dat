To establish a method to determine whether a given Pseudomonas spp. strain is responsible for the defect and study the evolution of the coloration under different storage conditions, we developed an in vitro system for the evaluation of blue coloration of Mozzarella cheese intentionally contaminated with strains of P. fluorescens. The purpose of the system was to determine whether P. fluorescens strains, isolated from Mozzarella cheese with <b>anomalous</b> <b>blue</b> coloration, were able to reproduce the blue coloration under controlled experimental conditions. Thirty-six trials of experimental inoculation of Mozzarella cheese in different preservation liquids were conducted using various suspensions of P. fluorescens (P. fluorescens ATCC 13525, P. fluorescens CFBP 3150, and P. fluorescens 349 field strain isolated from blue-colored Mozzarella cheese) at different concentrations and incubated at different temperatures. Growth curves of all tested P. fluorescens strains demonstrated that after 3 d of incubation the concentration was generally > 106 cfu/g of Mozzarella cheese incubated in either tryptic soy broth (control) or conditioning brine. Prolonged incubation for 5 d at either 20 °C or 8 °C led to concentrations up to 109 cfu/g of Mozzarella cheese incubated in tryptic soy broth and up to 108 cfu/g of Mozzarella cheese incubated in preservation liquid. All Mozzarella cheeses inoculated with the field strain of P. fluorescens, except those opened 1 h after packaging and stored at 8 °C, showed the characteristic <b>anomalous</b> <b>blue</b> coloration, which appeared from 1 to 72 h after opening the packaging, and was proportional to colony count, duration of storage, and storage temperature. With the proposed system, which enabled a larger number of samples to be analyzed under controlled experimental conditions and a large amount of data to be generated in a short time, we described precisely how and under which conditions the presence of P. fluorescens in Mozzarella cheese is responsible for the <b>anomalous</b> <b>blue</b> coloration. The system will help producers intercept contaminated batches and help consumers avoid the conditions under which the defect can appear.

40|$|We present new spectroscopic metal abundances for 74 RR Lyrae {{stars in}} omega Cen {{obtained}} with FLAMES. The well-known metallicity spread is visible among the RR Lyrae variables. The metal-intermediate (MInt) RR Lyrae stars ([Fe/H] ~ - 1. 2) are fainter than {{the bulk of}} the dominant metal-poor population ([Fe/H] ~ - 1. 7), in good agreement with the corresponding zero-age horizontal branch models with cosmological helium abundance Y = 0. 246. This result conflicts with the hypothesis that the progenitors of the MInt RR Lyrae stars correspond to the <b>anomalous</b> <b>blue</b> main-sequence stars, which share a similar metallicity but whose properties are currently explained by assuming for them a large helium enhancement.

50|$|A rather {{straightforward}} {{explanation of}} Pioneer anomaly {{can be achieved}} if one takes into account that the background spacetime is described by cosmological Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker metric that is not Minkowski flat. In this model of spacetime manifold, light moves uniformly {{with respect to the}} conformal cosmological time whereas physical measurements are performed with the help of atomic clocks that count the proper time of observer coinciding with the cosmic time. The difference between the conformal and cosmic times yields exactly the same numerical value and signature of the <b>anomalous,</b> <b>blue</b> Doppler shift effect that was measured in the Pioneer experiment. A small discrepancy between this theoretical prediction and the measured value of the Pioneer effect is a clear evidence of the presence of the thermal recoil that accounts up only to 10-20 percent of the overall effect. If the origin of the Pioneer effect is cosmological, it gives a direct access to measuring the numerical value of the Hubble constant independently of observations of the cosmic microwave background radiation or supernova explosions in distant galaxies (Supernova Cosmology Project).|$|R

The probe molecule exhibits a strong solventpolarity- dependent characteristic. The low-energy fluorescence band of DASQMI shows an <b>anomalous</b> 40 nm <b>blue</b> shift in water from that in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO); though in deuterium oxide the normal trend of red shift was observed. A marked increase in intensity of this band at 77 K {{and an increase in}} lifetime in viscous solvent point clearly to the intramolecular charge-transfer (ICT) character of the low-energy band. From the temperature-dependent emission and emission spectra in mixed solvents, the negative solvatochromism of DASQMI has been established, which means that the ICT state moves toward ground state with polarity and hydrogen-bond ability and beyond a critical dielectric constant coupled with protic nature of the solvent ground state gets further stabilized to show <b>anomalous</b> <b>blue</b> shift. In ethanol, below a critical temperature, 253 K, a blue shift starts due to greater solvent molecular polarization. A third long-lifetime component with dominant 75 % amplitude was observed only in aqueous solution and {{may be due to the}} cis-isomer of hydrophobic DASQMI, a stable form in the excited state predicted from polarizable continuum model (PCM) calculations in water with 6 - 31 G+(d,p) as basis set.

40|$|The layered dichalcogenide MoS 2 {{has many}} unique {{physical}} properties in low dimensions. Recent experimental Raman spectroscopies report an <b>anomalous</b> <b>blue</b> {{shift of the}} in-plane E 2 g 1 mode with decreasing thickness, a trend that is not understood. Here, we combine experimental Raman scattering and theoretical studies to clarify and explain this trend. Special attention is given to understanding the surface effect on Raman frequencies by using a force constants model based on first-principles calculations. Surface effects refer to the larger Mo-S force constants at the surface of thin film MoS 2, which results from a loss of neighbours in adjacent MoS 2 layers. Without surface effects, the frequencies of both out-of-plane A 1 g and in-plane E 2 g 1 modes decrease with decreasing thickness. However, the E 2 g 1 mode blue shifts while the A 1 g mode red shifts once the surface effect is included, {{in agreement with the}} experiment.

The phase transition in this system are marked by the splitting of phonon modes, appearance of new modes and anomalies in the frequency as well as linewidth of the phonon modes near transition temperature. In particular, we observed the splitting of symmetric (v(1)) and antisymmetric (v(3)) stretching vibrations associated with AsO 4 tetrahedra below transition temperature (T-c(*) similar to 110 K) attributed to the lowering of site symmetry of AsO 4 in orthorhombic phase below transition temperature. In addition, the step-up (hardening) and step-down (softening) of the AsO 4 bending vibrations (v(4) (S 9, S 11) and v(2) (S 6)) below transition temperature signals the rapid development of long range ferroelectric order and proton ordering.

40|$|We present time-series VI {{photometry}} of the metal-rich ([Fe/H] = - 0. 53) {{globular cluster}} NGC 6441. Our color-magnitude diagram {{shows that the}} extended blue horizontal branch seen in Hubble Space Telescope data exists in the outermost reaches of the cluster. The red clump slopes nearly parallel to the reddening vector. A component of this slope is due to differential reddening, but part is intrinsic. The blue horizontal branch stars are more centrally concentrated than the red clump stars. We have discovered about 50 new variable stars near NGC 6441, among them eight or more RR Lyrae stars which are very probably cluster members. Comprehensive period searches over the range 0. 2 - 1. 0 days yielded unusually long periods (0. 5 - 0. 9 days) for the fundamental pulsators compared with field RR Lyrae of the same metallicity. Three similar long-period RR Lyrae are known in other metal-rich globulars. With over ten examples in hand, it seems that a distinct sub-class of RR Lyrae is emerging. The observed properties of the horizontal branch stars are in reasonable agreement with recent models which invoke deep mixing to enhance the atmospheric helium abundance, while they conflict with models which assume high initial helium abundance. The light curves of the c-type RR Lyrae seem to have unusually long rise times and sharp minima. Reproducing these light curves in stellar pulsation models may provide another means of constraining the physical variables responsible for the <b>anomalous</b> <b>blue</b> horizontal branch extension and sloped red clump observed in NGC 6441.

40|$|Solvent effects, {{especially}} intermolecular hydrogen bonding, play {{a central}} role in the photophysics and photochemistry of aromatic ketones. To gain insight into the solute-solvent interactions and their implications for structure and reactivity, we studied xanthone (XT) in two different solvents of similar dipolarity: acetonitrile (ACN; aprotic) and methanol (MeOH; protic), using time-resolved resonance Raman (TR 3) spectroscopy in conjunction with time-dependent density functional theory calculations. Raman excitation profiles of XT in ACN followed the triplet-triplet absorption band with a shoulder at the blue end, but for MeOH, they followed the triplet-triplet absorption band quite closely; therefore, we propose that the resonance enhancement of Raman peaks are from two states in ACN and from a single state in the MeOH solvent. Furthermore, a resonance Raman peak at 614 cm(- 1) (a(2) symmetry) that appeared in ACN but not in the MeOH solvent has been identified as a vibronic active mode that could be involved in coupling the two lowest 1 (3) * (1 (3) A(1)) and 1 (3) n* (1 (3) A(2)) excited states. This was further confirmed by depolarization ratio measurements of some of the representative TR 3 peaks in ACN, which showed a depolarized intensity for the 614 cm(- 1) peak while the other peaks were polarized. Interestingly, we also observed blue shifting of some of the vibrational frequencies of XT in the 1 (3) * state compared with the ground state with increasing solvent polarity. This <b>anomalous</b> <b>blue</b> shift casts doubt on the general use of the resonance canonical structure to explain the structure of the excited states. In summary, we propose that the different hydrogen bonding mechanisms exhibited by the two lowest triplet states of XT separate them further in energy and that this can contribute to its low reactivity towards H atom abstraction in protic solvents.

40|$|We study {{physical}} {{consequences of}} the Hubble expansion of FLRW manifold on measurement of space, time and light propagation in the local inertial frame. We analyse the solar system radar ranging and Doppler tracking experiments, and time synchronization. FLRW manifold is covered by global coordinates (t,y^i), where t is the cosmic time coinciding with the proper time of the Hubble observers. We introduce local inertial coordinates x^a=(x^ 0,x^i) {{in the vicinity of}} a world line of a Hubble observer {{with the help of a}} special conformal transformation. The local inertial metric is Minkowski flat and is materialized by the congruence of time-like geodesics of static observers being at rest with respect to the local spatial coordinates x^i. We consider geodesic motion of test particles and notice that the local coordinate time x^ 0 =x^ 0 (t) taken as a parameter along the world line of particle, is a function of the Hubble's observer time t. This function changes smoothly from x^ 0 =t for a particle at rest (observer's clock), to x^ 0 =t+ 1 / 2 Ht^ 2 for photons, where H is the Hubble constant. Thus, motion of a test particle is non-uniform when its world line is parametrized by time t. NASA JPL Orbit Determination Program presumes that motion of light (after the Shapiro delay is excluded) is uniform with respect to the time t but it does not comply with the non-uniform motion of light on cosmological manifold. For this reason, the motion of light in the solar system analysed with the Orbit Determination Program appears as having a systematic blue shift of frequency, of radio waves circulating in the Earth-spacecraft radio link. The magnitude of the <b>anomalous</b> <b>blue</b> shift of frequency is proportional to the Hubble constant H that may open an access to the measurement of this fundamental cosmological parameter in the solar system radiowave experiments.

We demonstrate that P. aroaniensis (Brown, 1976) is not as widespread in the Balkans as was previously thought. In fact, it has a dot-like distribution range restricted to the Peloponnese Peninsula in South Greece. Polyommatus orphicus Kolev, 2005 is not as closely related to the Turkish species P. dantchenkoi (Lukhtanov &amp; Wiemers, 2003) as was supposed earlier. Instead, it is a Balkan endemic represented by two subspecies: P. orphicus orphicus (Bulgaria) and P. orphicus eleniae Coutsis &amp; De Prins, 2005 (Northern Greece). Polyommatus ripartii (Freyer, 1830) is represented in the Balkans by an endemic subspecies P. ripartii pelopi. The traditionally recognized P. admetus (Esper, 1783) is shown to be a heterogeneous complex and is divided into Polyommatus admetus sensu stricto (the Balkans and west Turkey) and P. yeranyani (Dantchenko &amp; Lukhtanov, 2005) (east Turkey, Armenia, Azerbaijan and Iran). Polyommatus nephohiptamenos (Brown &amp; Coutsis, 1978) is confirmed to be a species with a dot-like distribution range in Northern Greece.

Despite the persistence of this theory, however, there is widespread agreement about its empirical shortcomings (McCawley, 1968; Fodor, 1977). As an alternative, some critics of the Katz-Fodor theory (e. g. (Johnson-Laird, 1983)) have abandoned the treatment of selectional constraints as semantic, instead treating them as indistinguishable from inferences {{made on the basis of}} factual knowledge. This provides a better match for the empirical phenomena, but it opens up a different problem: if selectional constraints are the same as inferences in general, then accounting for them will require a much more complete understanding of knowledge representation and inference than we have at present. The problem, then, is this: how can a theory of selectional constraints be elaborated without first having either an empirically adequate theory of defining features or a comprehensive theory of inference? In this dissertation, I suggest that an answer to this question lies in the representation of conceptual knowledge. Following Miller (1990 b), I adopt a “differential” approach to conceptual representation, in which a conceptual taxonomy is defined in terms of inferential relationships rather than definitional features. Crucially, however, the inferences underlying the stored knowledge are not made explicit. My hypothesis is that a theory of selectional constraints need make reference only to knowledge stored in such a taxonomy, without ever referring overtly to inferential processes. I propose such a theory, formalizing selectional relationships in probabilistic terms: the selectional behavior of a predicate is modeled as its distributional effect on the conceptual classes of its arguments. This is expressed using the information-theoretic measure of relative entropy (Kullback and Leibler, 1951), which leads to an illuminating interpretation of what selectional constraints are: the strength of a predicate’s selection for an argument is identified with the quantity of information it carries about that argument. In addition to arguing that the model is empirically adequate, I explore its application to two problems. The first concerns a linguistic question: why some transitive verbs permit implicit direct objects (“John ate Ø”) and others do not (“*John brought Ø”). It has often been observed informally that the omission of objects is connected to the ease with which the object can be inferred. I have made this observation more formal by positing a relationship between selectional constraints and inferability. This predicts (i) that verbs permitting implicit objects select more strongly for (i. e. carry more information about) that argument than verbs that do not, and (ii) that strength of selection is a predictor of how often verbs omit their objects in naturally occurring utterances. Computational experiments confirm these predictions. Second, I have explored the practical applications of the model in resolving syntactic ambiguity. A number of authors have recently begun investigating the use of corpus-based lexical statistics in automatic parsing; the results of computational experiments using the present model suggest that many lexical relationships are better viewed in terms of underlying conceptual relationships. Thus the information-theoretic measures proposed here can serve not only as components in a theory of selectional constraints, but also as tools for practical natural language processing...|$|R
40|$|Histochemical {{techniques}} {{suitable for}} fluorescence microscopy {{have been developed}} for the detection of the principal chemical groupings and substances likely to be present in tissue sections. The mechanisms and specificities of the chosen reactions were confirmed wherever possible. The following methods were found to be the most satisfactory for the detection of: Amines An extremely intense green fluorescent product was produced in sites of proteins in tissue sections treated witha methanolic solution of pyridine containing a few drops of aqueous cyanogen bromide solution (the König-Sassi reaction). Treatment of sections with an alkaline solution of salicylaldehyde gave a thermolabile, green fluorescent conjugate. Tryptophane residues gave a characteristic purple fluorescence after reaction with a solution of dimethylaminobenzaldehyde in hydrochloric acid. The complex formed by mixing solutions of Solochrome dyes and alum fluoresced red after adsorption onto acidophilic primary and polymethyl amino groups. Chloraraine T oxidised the primary amine groups of α-amino-acid residues to aldehydes which were subsequently demonstrated as their blue fluorescent salicyloylhydrasones. The specificity of the preceding reactions were confirmed by the following deamination experiments. The diazotisation of amine groups with a cold solution of sodium nitrite and sulphuric acid, followed by diazotisation with warm ethanol was usually effective, out took some time to accomplish. Oxidative deamination with a dilute solution of sodium hypochlorite within the pH range 5. 5 - 7. 0 worked very efficiently and rapidly. Stable aldehydes were produced predominantly in nuclear sites provided the excess hypochlorite in the sections was destroyed by washing them in a neutral solution of ammonia containing a trace of copper sulphate. Cytophasmic proteins were probably converted to ketoacids. If sodium thiosulphate was used for destroying the excess hypochlorite, the induced aldehydes were destroyed. Instead strongly besophillc groupings, probably derivatives of sulphonic acids, were formed in both protoplasmic and nuclear proteins. Many of the reagents suggested by Danielli (1950) for blocking amine groups were found to be ineffective. Thiols Thiols condensed with N-ethyl maleimide (NEM) selectively to give a product containing an unconjugated ketone group. The zinc complex of the non-fluorescent hydrazone of the NEM-thiol conjugate derived from salicyloyl hydrazide fluoresced bluish-green. When all the basophilic substances and compounds containing hydroxyl groups were extracted from tissue sections by treating them with methanolic hydrochloric acid at 60 Â°- 90 Â° for several hours (drastic methylation), {{it was found that the}} remaining thiol groups could be converted to basophilic thiosulphonic acids by exposing dry sections afterwards to sulphuryl chloride vapour. These acid groups exhibited an <b>anomalous</b> bright <b>blue</b> fluorescence after the treated section had been stained in dilute solutions of auramine O or acridine yellow. Disulphides Oxidation with peracids yielded basophilic sulphinic acids which were unique in resisting methylation. Subsequent staining with coriphosphine gave an intense red fluorescence in the oxidised sites. Previous blocking of other basophilic materials with methanolic thionyl chloride and of thiols with iodoacetate was essential. Phenols Indirect method. Acidified solutions of 1 -nitroso- 2 -naphthol containing a trace of sodium nitrite coupled with tyrosine-rich sites to form an unstable green fluorescent conjugate. This test relied on the activating influence of the phenolic group on the ortho- and para- positions in the aromatic nucleus. The specificity of the reaction was confirmed by iodinating these positions. Direct method. Dinitrofluorobenzene reacted only with phenols and thiols (but not amines) at a pH below 5. 5. By blocking the latter with iodoacetate, only the former reacted. The nitro groups of the conjugate were reduced to amines, but unfortunately attempts to demonstrate these groups by fluorescent methods (1) were unsuccessful. Carboxylic acids C-terminal carboxyl groups have been converted to methyl ketones by treating them with a mixture of acetic anhydride and pyridine at 60 Â°. The ketones thus formed were demonstrated as the Blue fluorescent zinc complexes of their salicyloyl hydrazones. This, and other experimental evidence, vitiated the hypothesis put forward by Karnovsky and Fasman (1960) that the principal reaction here was the conversion of the side-chain carboxyl groups to mixed acid anhydrides. Sites containing side-chain carboxyl groups were detected by the changes in the colour of their fluorescence from blue to green in tissue sections stained with 0. 01 % solutions of coriphosphine at pH 2 - 3 and at PH 5. The interference of the C- terminal carboxyl groups was eliminated by previously converting then to their methyl ketones (5 a). RNA was also extracted beforehand with hot perchloric acid. Nucleic acids Zirconium ions had en affinity for the phosphate groups of both types of nucleic acid which were subsequently demonstrated as their greenish-yellow fluorescent complex with morin. DNA yielded an aldehyde after brief (Feulgen) hydrolysis which was subsequently detectable as its blue fluorescent salicyloyl hydrazone. Sulphates No direct chemical methods have been found, but the presence of this group (in acid mucopolysaccharides) was inferred from the following tests: Their basophilia (towards coriphosphine) when counterstained with the acid dye, thiazol yellow. Acid mucopolysaccharides, containing only acid groups, exhibited the brown or red fluorescence of coriphosphine, while the nucleic acids and proteins fluoresced a light yellow or blue as a result of the very strong interaction between their basic amino groups and the acid dye. Their basophilia (towards coriphosphine) after selective extraction of nucleic acids. Methylation and reduction of tissue sections with lithium aluminium hydride in hot dioxane removed phosphate groups selectively. Uronic acid groups and some protein carboxyl groups were reduced to primary alcohols. Subsequent saponification and staining showed a reddish-brown fluorescence in sites containing acid mucopolysaccharides which contrasted with the weak green fluorescence of the remainder of the section. Hot perchloric acid has been used for the selective extraction of RNA. Other mineral acids and nucleases were found to be unsatisfactory for the selective extraction of nucleic fields because acid mucopolysaccharides were removed at the same time. Mild methods of methylation (using methanolic thionyl chlorine or diazomethane) have been successfully used for both the temporary and permanent blocking of sulphate and other basophilic groups. The normal technique for methylating tissues, using hot methanolic solutions of hydrochloric acid (Fisher and Lillie, 195 U) were found to be unsatisfactory; much of the reactive material was extracted from tissue sections instead of being methylated. Sulphated acid mucopolysaccharides were desulphated to a limited extent by this reagent. Using published methods based upon iron mordants (Hicks and Mathaei, 1958; Hale, 1946), it was found that acid mucopolysaccharides did not always take up ferric ions whereas nucleic acids did. Experimental evidence has been collected to show that the results published previously were fortuitously successful and were not strictly specific. Uronic acids Sections were reduced with lithium aluminium hydride (7 b) to show that the non-fluorescent dye alcian blue had a selective affinity for this group. When sections were stained with coriphosphine, they were first stained with alcian blue so as to quench the potential fluorescence of coriphosphine adsorbed onto acid mucopolysaccharides which otherwise would have been difficult to distinguish from that of nuclei. An intense blue fluorescence and a visible purple colour was observed in sites known to contain uronic acid groups after immersing sections in concentrated sulphuric acid at 60 - 75 Â°. vic-Glycols 1, 2 -glycols were cleaved to "dialdehydes" by periodic acid. Those in neutral mucopolysaccharides and glycogen were oxidised completely within 10 minutes. Those in acid mucopolysaccharide required 24 hours or longer before they were oxidised significantly. The engendered dialdehydes have been conjugated with: solutions of homo- and heterocyclic amines (particularly aminoacridine dyes) containing dissolved sulphur dioxide (pseudo-Schiff reagents). Preliminary blocking with methanolic thionyl chloride of the basophilic substance initially present in tissue sections was essential for the observation of specific staining of the engendered dialdehydes. Protein thiol groups nevertheless still interfered with the specificity of the reaction for glycols. Evidence has been accumulated in favour of the following mechanism for this type of reaction which differs from that suggested by Kasten (1958); the engendered dialdehydes take up sulphur dioxide from the dye solution to form sulphenic acids which subsequently combine with the basic dye in a salt-like linkage. Apart from p-aminosalicylic acid, no potentially fluorescent amine has been found to condense with engendered aldehydes in situ, contrary to what Kasten (1958) conjectured and to the numerous reports of fluorescent anil formation of aldehydes in solution. Recent chemical work (Guthrie and Honeyman 1959) has indicated that hydrazines and hydrazides always react with engendered dialdehydes whereas Schiff-type reagents may not, particularly if the dialdehydes are converted to hemiacetal or hemialdol forms. This fact has been confirmed histochemically: salicyloyl hydrazide formed intensely blue fluorescent complexes reliably and more extensively with engendered dialdehydes than do pseudo-Schiff reagents. Moreover, salicyloyl hydrazides did not form any fluorescent artefacts with protein thiol groups after oxidation in periodic acid (Cf. 9 a). The phenylhydrazones of the dialdehydes formed in situ, unlike those in vitro, did not form formazans except with diazotised aniline in pyrnine. Hydroxyl groups The basophilic properties (towards azure A or coriphosphine) of this group after it had been sulphated were studied. The sulphating efficiencies of various Lewis base complexes of sulphur trioxide were investigated in both acid end basic media. The dioxan-sulphur trioxide dissolved in the weak base dimethylformamide (DMF) or sulphur trioxide dissolved in DMF were very efficient sulphating reagents, even for glycogen which could not be sulphated by acidic sulphating reagents. The amine groups of proteins were sulphated simultaneously by the DMF-sulphur trioxide complex. However, the N-sulphate groups, unlike O- sulphate groups, were easily hydrolysed off by methanolic hydrochloric acid at room temperature. If the amine groups were protected beforehand with suitable blocking reagents, the access of the sulphating complex to hydroxyl groups was completely hindered. Although glycogen in tissue sections can be sulphated normally by sulphuryl chloride vapour, the hydroxyl groups of neutral mucopolysaccharides were not sulphated in the same way: it is Relieved that in the latter, non-basophilic cyclic sulphate groups were formed. Primary hydroxyl groups The selective sulphation and subsequent basophilia (towards azure A or coriphosphine) of this group by the pyridine-sulphur trioxide complex in the DMF was investigated. Lipids Unsaturated lipids were oxidised by peracetic acid to aldehydes and subsequently condensed with salicyloyl hydrazide to form a blue fluorescent hydrazone. Lipids emitted a reddish-pink fluorescence when sections were stained with an acidified solution of protoporphyrin IX. Ketosteroids formed blue fluorescent salicyloyl hydrazones, most of whom, unlike aldehydo -salicyloylhydrazones, were stable towards alkalis. The interfering aldehydes originating from the autooxidation of lipids were blocked with sulphanilic acid. </ol...|$|R
