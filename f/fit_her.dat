The inspiration for the character comes from Bernardine Dohrn of the Weather Underground, although the writers acknowledge that several people <b>fit</b> <b>her</b> description.

25|$|After his death, Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche {{became the}} curator {{and editor of}} her brother's manuscripts, {{reworking}} Nietzsche's unpublished writings to <b>fit</b> <b>her</b> own German nationalist ideology while often contradicting or obfuscating his stated opinions, which were explicitly opposed to antisemitism and nationalism. Through her published editions, Nietzsche's work became associated with fascism and Nazism; 20th century scholars contested this interpretation of his work and corrected editions of his writings were soon made available. His thought enjoyed renewed popularity in the 1960s, and his ideas have since {{had a profound impact}} on 20th and early-21st century thinkers across philosophy—especially in schools of continental philosophy such as existentialism, postmodernism, and post-structuralism—as well as art, literature, psychology, politics, and popular culture.|$|E
25|$|Gerda, posing under several aliases {{including}} that of Mrs Albert Chapman, invited Sainsbury Seale to visit her, killed her, and took her identity; {{but she had to}} buy new shoes because those of Sainsbury Seale did not <b>fit</b> <b>her.</b> This is why the buckles on the shoes found on the corpse were dull, whereas the buckle of the woman whom Poirot met going into Morley's surgery was shiny: the fake Mabelle had newer shoes. The woman in the trunk could hardly have worn through a new pair of shoes in a single day. Ironically, the face of the corpse had been disfigured not because it wasn't Mabelle Sainsbury Seale, but because it was.|$|E

25|$|Fern was {{extremely}} successful in her lifetime as a columnist. She {{was said to}} <b>fit</b> <b>her</b> material and subject matter to the audience. Many readers of weekly literary papers were women, and Fern addressed them in a conversational style, often using interjections and exclamation points, while tackling topics that concerned the daily life of ordinary women. Her readers were wives and mothers who worried about their children, current fashions, difficult husbands, and aggravating relatives. Sometimes they felt oppressed, depressed, or stressed. Fern expressed their problems in plain language, addressing women's suffrage, the woman's right to her children in a divorce, unfaithful husbands, social customs that restricted women's freedom, and sometimes just having a bad day.|$|E
