30|$|In {{terms of}} the handle length l, a longer handle length {{contributes}} to less deformation along the Y direction, and the curvature has a local maximum when l is approximately 5 mm. For the fixation angle ϕ, a larger fixation angle contributes to larger curvature during deformation and does not affect deformation in the Y direction. Shorter fixation distance L' between the handle parts transfers the circular arc deformation along the Y direction. From {{the nature of this}} mechanism, the fixation parts must be placed closer to the face than the nob attach to the eyelid, and it is more difficult to attach the nob to the eyelid when deformation in the Y direction is larger. The fixation parts and the ELGM deformation loci must be closer in order to maintain contact with the eyelid. In this case, from the results of this deformation analysis and <b>exploratory</b> <b>prototyping,</b> we prepare a prototype with l = 5 mm, ϕ = 50 °, and L' = 38 mm for use in the following experiments.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. How do we conceptualize social awareness, {{and what}} support {{is needed to}} develop and {{maintain}} social awareness in flexible work settings? The paper begins by arguing the rele-vance of designing for social awareness in flexible work. It points out how social awareness is suspended {{in the field of}} tension that exists between the ephemerality and continuity of social encounters, exploring ways to construct identity through relationships by means of social encounters – notably those that are accidental and unforced. We probe into this issue through design research: In particular, we present three <b>exploratory</b> <b>prototyping</b> processes in an open office setting (examining the concepts of a shared calendar, personal panels, and ambient awareness cues). Field studies, conducted in parallel, have contributed to a conceptual decon-struction ofCSCWconcepts, resulting in a focus on cues to relatedness, to belonging, and to care. Analyzing these three prototypes in their microcosmic usage setting results in specific recom-mendations for the three types of applications with respect to social awareness. The experiences indicate that the metaphors a ‘shared mirror ’ and ‘breadcrumbs ’ are promising foundations on which to base further design. We present these analyses and suggest that the metaphors work because of their ability to map experiences from the physical space into conceptual experiences. We conclude that social awareness in flexible work must be constructed indirectly, presenting itself as an option, rather than as a consequence of being able to overhear and oversee. Key words: ‘new ’ offices, ambience, design research, flexibility, social awareness 1...|$|E
40|$|Wearable {{technologies}} {{have resulted in}} garments that ‘house’ product technologies rather than ‘embody’ them. The paper offers a new design paradigm in which the traditions of product design are replaced by a more effective and flexible ‘technology design’, which does not distinguish between hardware/software, views system and product as indistinguishable, and seeks to integrate previously isolated design territories. The paper details three original schematic models that build on current models of design interdisciplinarity but address the increasingly common phenomena of digital product archetypes, the emergence of ‘technology design’ as a new paradigm and the fusion of product and garment design. The paper is a comparative critique of industrial and fashion/textiles design, related to the dissolving boundaries between digital technologies, the body and wider communication networks. It demonstrates that even advanced notions of ‘wearable technology’ are restrictive and based on an obsolete interpretation of industrial design. The paper draws on the work with Baurley and Stead on the ‘Emotional Wardrobe’ project funded by the EPSRC/AHRC under the ‘Designing for the 21 st Century’ initiative, for which I was Principal Investigator. The paper uses data and insights recorded throughout the project, primarily {{from a series of}} collaborative expert workshops which engaged with <b>exploratory</b> <b>prototyping,</b> user testing and theoretical discourses around wearable technologies. It also documents the evolutionary chronology of wearable technology archetypes in order to identify further options for design practitioners seeking to purposefully integrate communications technologies with garment design. The project brought together a diverse cluster of researchers from fashion, technical textiles, sustainable design, wireless communications, HCI, affective/ubiquitous computing, psychology and social science.

An important theme is to shift the view point of the statistical variation in timing and power upstream from gate level CD distributions to a more deterministic set of sources of variations in characterized processes. Many of these nonidealities of manufacturing can be expressed at the mask plane in terms of lateral impact functions to capture effects not included in design rules.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{discusses}} {{the challenge of}} supporting digitally mediated citizengovernment collaboration in public service provision. With a vantage point in activity theory and the empirical data from three exploratory design cases, we derive a theoretical framework for understanding {{the way in which}} citizens share information with government. Through the proposed framework and the notion of Participatory Citizenship, we propose a set of central design challenges to supporting collaboration within this setting. We argue that civil servants and citizens have inherently different foci in the service provision process. Hence, we conclude that the focus of design should not be to support a shared motive for the overall service delivery, but to support a better common understanding of the case process in itself, i. e. the involved actors, their motives, and their mediating artifacts. Moreover, we argue that the aim of technological support for complex collaboration should not be leaner, more rational case processes, but improved citizen involvement in the configuration of service provision and the alignment of actor motives. Lastly, we exemplify how these design challenges can be met by discussing how a concrete <b>exploratory</b> <b>prototype</b> {{in the form of a}} web-based timeline addresses collaboration within a complex service provision setting...|$|R
40|$|The {{traditional}} {{software development}} paradigm, the waterfall life cycle model, is defective when used for developing real-time systems. This thesis puts forward an executable prototyping approach {{for the development}} of real-time systems. A prototyping system is proposed which uses ESML (Extended Systems Modelling Language) as a prototype specification language. The prototyping system advocates the translation of non-executable ESML specifications into executable LOOPN (Language of Object Oriented Petn Net) specifications so that ESML {{can be used as a}} graphical executable specification language for the prototyping of real-time systems. If the translation process is automatic then the user need not be aware of LOOPN. The ESML/LOOPN prototyping system defines an execution semantics for the ESML language in terms of LOOPN nets, a set of translation templates are supplied for the translation of ESML language specifications into LOOPN language specifications. The execution semantics are based on a set of execution rules (guidelines) which have been defined for ESML to allow prediction of the behaviour of ESML specifications over time. A C language program which can be run by the user as a prototype of the modelled system is generated automatically from the LOOPN specification.

One cause of these problems is poorly designed user interfaces. A good user interface can increase performance, reduce errors, and enhance user satisfaction. Advances in user interface technology coupled with the affordability of personal computers are motivating many organizations to redesign their outdated systems (Sawyer, 1995). In 1994, the Human-Computer Interaction Laboratory (HCIL) began working with the Maryland Department of Juvenile Justice (DJJ) in an effort to redesign the user interface of their current information system, ISYS (Information System for Youth Services).

40|$|The {{rapid growth}} of the Internet has served to intensify {{existing}} privacy concerns of the individual, {{to the point that}} privacy is the number one concern amongst Internet users today. Tools exist that can provide users with a choice of anonymity or pseudonymity. However, many Web transactions require the release of personally identifying information, thus rendering such tools infeasible in many instances. Since it is then a given that users are often required to release personal information, which could be recorded, it follows that they require a greater degree of control over the information they release. Hippocratic databases, designed by Agrawal, Kiernan, Srikant, and Xu (2002), aim to give users greater control over information stored in a data- base. Their design was inspired by the medical Hippocratic oath, and makes data privacy protection a fundamental responsibility of the database itself. To achieve the privacy of data, Hippocratic databases are governed by 10 key privacy principles. This dissertation argues, that asides from a few challenges, the 10 prin- ciples of Hippocratic databases can be applied to log ¯les. This argument is supported by presenting a high-level functional view of a Hippocratic log file architecture. This architecture focuses on issues that highlight the con- trol users gain over their personal information that is collected in log files. By presenting a layered view of the aforementioned architecture, it was, fur- thermore, possible to provide greater insight into the major processes that would be at work in a Hippocratic log file implementation. An <b>exploratory</b> <b>prototype</b> served to understand and demonstrate certain of the architectural components of Hippocratic log files.

One of the key advantages of an informal approach is to gain an intuitive insight to how it feels to use the application.|$|R
40|$|A {{practical}} application of computational humour The past 15 years {{has seen the}} development of a number of programs which perform tasks in the area of humour, but these have been <b>exploratory</b> research <b>prototypes,</b> usually on a very small scale, and none of them interacted with users. Amongst those which actually created humorous texts, the JAPE program was probably the most substantial, but even it was far from being useful for any practical purpose. We have developed a fully engineered riddle generator, inspired by the ideas in the JAPE system, which uses a large-scale multimedia lexicon and a set of symbolic rules to generate jokes. It has an interactive user interface, specially designed for children with complex communication needs (CCN), so that users can make choices to guide the riddle generator. The software is robust, stable, and responds sufficiently promptly that naive users can interact without difficulty. It has been tested over with real users (children with CCN), with highly positive results, and is publicly available for free download...|$|R
40|$|The Predictable Assembly from Certifiable Components (PACC) Initiative at the Software Engineering Institute (SEI) is {{developing}} methods and technologies for predictable assembly. A software development activity that builds systems from components is predictable if the runtime behavior of an assembly of components can be predicted from known properties of components and their patterns of interactions (connections), and if these predictions can be objectively validated. A component is certifiable if these known properties {{can be obtained}} or validated by independent third parties. The SEI 2 ̆ 7 s technical approach to PACC rests on prediction-enabled component technology (PECT). At the highest level, PECT is a scheme for systematic and repeatable integration of software component technology, software architecture technology, and design analysis and verification technology. This report describes {{the results of an}} <b>exploratory</b> PECT <b>prototype</b> for substation automation, an application area in the domain of power generation, transmission, and management. This report focuses primarily on the methodological aspects of PECT; the prototype itself was only a means to expose and illustrate the PECT method...|$|R
