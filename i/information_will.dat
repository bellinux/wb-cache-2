50|$|The {{existence}} of dissonance and consequent pressure to reduce {{it will lead}} to an active search of <b>information,</b> which <b>will</b> then lead people to avoid <b>information</b> that <b>will</b> increase dissonance.

If the subject expects the cognition to increase dissonance, they will avoid it. In the event that one's expectations are proven wrong, the attempt at dissonance reduction may result in increasing it instead. It may in turn lead to a situation of active avoidance.|$|R

25|$|Some {{implementations}} (e.g. Kad) do {{not have}} replication nor caching. The purpose {{of this is to}} remove old information quickly from the system. The node that is providing the file will periodically refresh the information onto the network (perform FIND_NODE and STORE messages). When all of the nodes having the file go offline, nobody will be refreshing its values (sources and keywords) and the <b>information</b> <b>will</b> eventually disappear from the network.|$|E
25|$|Once the {{transmission}} {{characteristics of a}} system are determined, telecommunication engineers design the transmitters and receivers needed for such systems. These two are sometimes combined to form a two-way communication device known as a transceiver. A key consideration {{in the design of}} transmitters is their power consumption as this is closely related to their signal strength. If the signal strength of a transmitter is insufficient the signal's <b>information</b> <b>will</b> be corrupted by noise.|$|E
