5|$|As Voyager {{installs}} the Isodesium, a ship is {{sent from}} the <b>Forge</b> <b>to</b> tear Voyager apart for resources. Tuvok leads the Hazard Team {{to a nearby}} derelict dreadnought gunship to use the gunship's weaponry to destroy the incoming ship, but is only successful in disabling it as it attaches to Voyager. Voyager is consequently swarmed by crab-like aliens intent on carrying off crew and cargo, although the crew manages to eliminate these aliens. Munro prompts the captain to counterattack, in order to destroy the dampening field projected by the station. The Hazard Team uses the Forge's ship to infiltrate the Forge and disable its defensive systems, allowing the Voyager crew to attack using shuttlecraft; however, Crewman Biessman is killed while waiting for Voyagers reinforcements. The Forge's power core is destroyed, thereby dropping the dampening field. Munro, however, learns of the species behind the Forge, the Vohrsoth, and the station's true purpose: to harvest the genetic features of those trapped by the <b>Forge</b> <b>to</b> create an army designed for conquering the galaxy. Munro disobeys orders to ensure the Vohrsoth cannot recreate the Forge and kills the Vohrsoth commander. With power restored, Voyager attacks the Forge and destroys the station, beaming Munro off {{in the last few}} moments. Voyager and other active ships in the area are freed, and Munro is promoted to lieutenant.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{experimental}} {{archaeology and}} history re-enactment have shown {{there is only}} a very short step from the Catalan <b>forge</b> <b>to</b> the true blast furnace, where the iron is gained as pig iron in liquid phase. Usually, obtaining the iron in liquid phase is actually undesired, and the temperature is intentionally kept below the melting point of iron, since while removing the solid bloom mechanically is tedious and means batch process instead of continuous process, it is almost pure iron and can be worked immediately. On the other hand, pig iron is the eutectic mixture of carbon and iron and needs to be described to produce steel or wrought iron, which was extremely tedious in the Middle Ages.|$|E

5|$|The Forge {{junction}} at Telford Town Centre {{was awarded}} relatively late, {{to the company}} Norwest Holst. The junction precipitated the construction of Telford Shopping Centre, and the central commercial area, as the exchange was upgraded to allow traffic from the motorway to join and exit in both directions. The <b>Forge</b> <b>to</b> Cluddley section, from junction 5 to junction 7, opened to traffic in December 1975. The Hilton Park to Forge section, from the M6 to junction 5, opened in November 1983. The motorway cost 65 million pounds to build, which when adjusted for inflation would come to approximately 150 million 2006 GBP.|$|E
5|$|The Spirit of Fire {{is sent to}} {{the ruined}} planet Harvest to {{investigate}} Covenant activity, where Cutter learns that the Covenant has excavated something at the planet's northern pole. When the UNSC's main outpost on Harvest is captured, Cutter orders <b>Forge</b> <b>to</b> retake it. Soon after, Forge scouts the Covenant excavation and discovers that they, {{under the direction of the}} Arbiter, have discovered a Forerunner facility. Forge's troops defeat the Covenant forces before they can destroy the installation, and Anders arrives. She determines that the facility is an interstellar map, and recognizes a set of coordinates that points to the human colony of Arcadia.|$|E
5|$|During {{the repair}} efforts, Yar becomes close to Castillo, but is unnerved by tense {{interactions}} with Guinan. Guinan reveals to Yar {{that she knows}} Yar dies a meaningless death in the other timeline, and that the two should never have met. Based on her discussion with Guinan, Yar requests a transfer to the Enterprise-C, which is granted by Picard. As the Enterprise-C prepares to return through the anomaly, three Klingon battlecruisers attack. With the anomaly becoming unstable, Picard orders the Enterprise-D to cover the Enterprise-C's withdrawal. The Enterprise-D suffers major crew losses under the Klingon barrage, including the death of Commander Riker, forcing Picard to man the tactical station himself. With the Enterprise-D {{on the brink of}} destruction, the Enterprise-C traverses the anomaly, triggering the return of Enterprise-D's original timeline. In the restored timeline, Guinan– the only one subtly aware of what has transpired– asks Geordi La <b>Forge</b> <b>to</b> tell her more about Yar.|$|E

Hephaestus' most beautiful creation is a brooch depicting a sea nymph and her lover; he threatens to destroy the brooch unless Thetis tells him {{who he is and}} how he came to live in the grotto. The goddesses resume their tales: Rhea and Zeus conspire to overthrow Cronus. The avenging children of Cronus defeat and imprison the Titans, sparing Rhea, Prometheus and Epimetheus.|$|E
25|$|While {{there are}} no plans to build motorway-standard flank of the ring road at {{national}} government level, Glasgow City Council have recently published new plans for what it calls the Glasgow East End Regeneration Route (EERR). This would appear not to be a motorway, but instead an urban corridor which will connect the M74 extension at Polmadie with the M8/M80 at Provan. While the Council has openly voiced its commitment to the plan, it will likely face considerable controversy since its path will dissect the suburbs of Bridgeton, Carntyne and Parkhead making use of derelict land and an abandoned railway embankment. As of summer 2013, phases 1 and 2 of the project from the M74 to Parkhead have been completed. Phase 3 from Parkhead <b>Forge</b> <b>to</b> the M80 at Provan is scheduled for completion in 2014.|$|E

25|$|As an X-Man she met Mephisto, Dr. Doom and the Fantastic Four, and the Horde. The X-Men later battled Freedom Force and the Adversary in Dallas, and, in a {{televised}} battle, sacrificed themselves to allow <b>Forge</b> <b>to</b> bind the Adversary; Roma secretly restored them to life, and gave Betsy the Siege Perilous, which they could use if they ever wanted to start new lives. The X-Men moved to the Reavers' Australian Outback base, from where they took on the Brood, Genoshan Magistrates, Mister Sinister and the Goblin Queen, M Squad, Mr. Jip and the Serpent Society, Master Mold and Nimrod, Nanny and the Orphan-Maker, and Zaladane and the Savage Land Mutates. As {{they were about to}} depart the Savage Land, Betsy had a precognitive flash of the Reavers killing the team. To prevent this, she sent them through the Siege Perilous.|$|E
25|$|Planning for today's {{expressway}} {{began in}} 1947, {{when the city}} of Philadelphia approved plans to develop a highway connecting the city with the terminus of the planned Philadelphia Extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike near Valley Forge. The highway was designed by engineers Michael Rapuano, who had previously aided {{in the design of}} the Garden State Parkway, and Bill Allen of Gannett Fleming. The new expressway largely followed the earlier planned parkway route from Valley <b>Forge</b> <b>to</b> Fairmount Park, while also extending into southern Philadelphia and across the Delaware River into New Jersey. Two alternatives were proposed south of University City: one routing would continue along the west bank of the river into Southwest Philadelphia to its confluence near Philadelphia International Airport, where it would tunnel underneath the Delaware to Paulsboro, New Jersey; the other would cross the Schuylkill south of University City and bisect South Philadelphia, crossing the Delaware into Gloucester City, New Jersey. Planned expansions of the airport in the path of the former proposal led to adoption of the routing through South Philadelphia.|$|E
25|$|NY190 was {{assigned}} {{as part of}} the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York to an east–west highway extending from NY374 in The <b>Forge</b> <b>to</b> US11 in Ellenburg by way of Ellenburg Center. On April1, 1980, ownership and maintenance of NY190 from NY374 eastward to its junction with Star Road southwest of Ellenburg was transferred from the state of New York to Franklin and Clinton counties as part of a pair of highway maintenance swaps {{between the state and the}} two counties. In return, the state assumed maintenance of Star Road, an east–west road linking NY374 in Brainardsville to NY190, and Military Turnpike, a highway connecting Ellenburg to NY3 in the town of Plattsburgh. Both highways became part of a reconfigured NY190, which now began in Brainardsville and ended west of the city of Plattsburgh. As a result of the realignment, NY190 no longer directly connected to US11 in Ellenburg; instead, the connection was now made by way of NY971L, an unsigned reference route. The former routing of NY190 west of Star Road is designated as CR54 in Franklin County and CR5 in Clinton County.|$|E

5000|$|Another {{possibility}} is that the Newark Holy Stones were <b>forged</b> <b>to</b> support a political viewpoint. Brad Lepper, of the Ohio Historical Society who has extensively studied the Hopewell culture, suggests that the artifacts might have been scientifically <b>forged</b> <b>to</b> help advance the theory on monogenism. [...] In 1860, slavery was a subject of poignant interest and heated debate that was reaching a critical point in American society. Anthropology {{and other forms of}} science were often used in defense or opposition. [...] Discussions promoting monogenism, for example, were often used to oppose slavery and segregation.|$|R
500|$|Washington had {{repeatedly}} petitioned the Continental Congress for badly needed provisions {{but with no}} success. Finally, on January 24, 1778, five Congressmen came to Valley <b>Forge</b> <b>to</b> examine {{the conditions of the}} Continental Army. Washington expressed the urgency of the situation, exclaiming, [...] "Something must be done. Important alterations must be made." [...] At this time, he also contended that Congress should take control of the army supply system, pay for its supplies, and promptly expedite them as they became necessary. In response to Washington's urgent appeal, Congress gave full support to funding the supply lines of the army, which also resulted in reorganizing the commissary department, which controlled gathering the supplies for the army. By late February, there were adequate supplies flowing throughout camp.|$|E
500|$|The Richmond and Alleghany Railroad, {{which ran}} from Clifton <b>Forge</b> <b>to</b> Richmond {{following}} the James River {{and the old}} James River and Kanawha Canal, was merged into the Chesapeake and Ohio in 1889. [...] On this line, trains descended nearly [...] in elevation to Richmond following {{the path of the}} river. The addition of the [...] "James River Line" [...] allowed the C to avoid the heavier grades of the old Virginia Central's line to the north and became the principal artery of eastbound coal transportation down to the present day, with the earlier Virginia Central line used for westbound empty hoppers. From the convergence of the lines in Richmond, both eastbound and westbound coal trains utilized the Peninsula Subdivision through Williamsburg to service the coal piers in the East End of Newport News.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} {{described}} as [...] "uneven" [...] and an [...] "inauspicious start to the second season" [...] by James Van Hise and Hal Schuster in their book The Complete Trek: The Next Generation. While the duo praised the addition of Muldaur and Goldberg, {{the lack of a}} follow-up to the episode was criticised as they felt that the events should have had some type of lasting effect on Troi. It was suggested that either she would want to have a child, or she would be wary of them in general due to the impact of the loss of Ian. Keith DeCandido pointed out several changes at the start of this season in [...] "The Child" [...] that would recur {{throughout the rest of the}} run of The Next Generation in his review for Tor.com. These included moving Geordi La <b>Forge</b> <b>to</b> become chief engineer, placing Miles O'Brien as transporter chief and Riker growing a beard. However, he criticised the fact that Worf's calling for Troi to have an abortion was never mentioned again, but added that it was discussed in a non-canon novel, A Rock and a Hard Place by Peter David.|$|E

500|$|Still underground, Picard discovers a {{computer}} terminal, which he activates, causing a hologram of the salesman to appear and explain they are witnessing {{a demonstration of}} an intelligent weapon system which is able to upgrade in response to any enemy threat. Picard surmises that the Minosians and the Drake were destroyed by the weapons. He unsuccessfully attempts to coerce the hologram to end the demonstration. Data is able to locate Picard, and determines that while the sentries could be set to destroy their own power source, the resulting explosion would probably take out the whole area, including the away-team. Picard finally tells the salesman he will buy the system, causing the salesman to disappear and the probes on the planet to shut down. Meanwhile, La Forge uses the planet's atmosphere to reveal {{the location of the}} space-born probe and destroys it. [...] The away team returns to the star-drive section, where Picard allows La <b>Forge</b> <b>to</b> stay in command until they rendezvous with the saucer section, remarking that he left him with the ship intact and would like it returned in the same condition.|$|E
500|$|Philippine Sea {{arrived in}} Korean waters on 1 August, and became {{flagship}} of Task Force 77 on 5 August. She immediately began launching {{air strikes against}} strategic targets, as the Battle of Pusan Perimeter began and United Nations and United States Army forces fought a defensive battle against the North Korean Korean People's Army. Her first strikes were against Iri, Mokpo, and Kunsan. The strikes were at first planned to target North Korean lines of communication but {{the intensity of the}} battle at Pusan Perimeter forced the carrier to fly primarily close air support missions for troops on the front lines. They also hit targets of opportunity, such as North Korean boats, bridges and dams spotted during missions. As many as 140 sorties a day were launched from the carrier. Except for brief rests to re-arm, refuel, or repair, Philippine Sea was in action continuously. She was put in a rotation of continuous action with Valley <b>Forge</b> <b>to</b> assure at least one was launching aircraft at all times. Following the beginning of The Great Naktong Offensive on 31 August, the two carriers launched 263 sorties to prevent the North Koreans from overrunning Pusan Perimeter. The ship sent sorties to defend Masan during the Battle of Masan, in spite of being [...] from the area. The ship steamed to the southern tip of the Peninsula at [...] on 1 September to support the Masan area more easily during the North Korean attacks.|$|E
500|$|Brütal Legend is a {{third person}} action/adventure game {{incorporating}} real time strategy elements. The game uses an open world that Tim Schafer has described as being approximately [...] in area. The player controls the protagonist Eddie Riggs, a roadie who one day finds himself transported into a heavy metal-themed fantasy world. Eddie acquires three tools that are used for combat and transportation: a broad axe called [...] "The Separator", his Flying V guitar [...] "Clementine" [...] from his own world which {{has the ability to}} cast magic spells in the heavy metal world, and a hot rod that Eddie builds called [...] "The Druid Plow", a.k.a. [...] "The Deuce". Spells, referred to as [...] "Solos", from Clementine are performed by playing a minigame akin to the note-matching aspect of Guitar Hero or Rock Band over a brief guitar riff; however, Eddie cannot use the metal generated by Clementine constantly, as prolonged usage of the guitar will cause it to overheat, and the player will have to wait for a cool-off period before using the guitar's power again. Eddie may also find more solos hidden throughout the world, ranging from support to offensive spells. The player can spend in-game currency called [...] "Fire Tributes", earned from completing missions, at the Motor <b>Forge</b> <b>to</b> gain new abilities and upgrades for each tool. These tools can be used in combination with each other to take out Eddie's foes; for example, the player can use his guitar Clementine to create pyrotechnics to launch a foe into the air and follow up by attack it with the Separator axe. In a case of a specific boss fight, the player must use the Deuce hot rod to lure the boss to a spiked gate held up by counterweights, and then play the [...] "Earthshaker" [...] move on Clementine to destroy the weights and sever the creature's head.|$|E
