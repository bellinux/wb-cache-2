5|$|On October10, another {{tropical}} depression formed {{further to the}} north of the previous storm. <b>It</b> <b>possibly</b> developed from the same tropical wave that spawned the previous depression, although they were not the same system. The depression maintained a general northward movement throughout its duration, dissipating on October12.|$|E
5|$|Orcadian {{folklore}} had {{a strong}} Scandinavian influence, {{and it may be}} that the nuckelavee is a composite of a water horse from Celtic mythology and a creature imported by the Norsemen. As with similar malevolent entities such as the kelpie, <b>it</b> <b>possibly</b> offered an explanation for incidents that islanders in ancient times could not otherwise understand.|$|E
5|$|Inquiries {{were made}} through {{official}} channels {{about the prospect of}} Murphy attending West Point upon his return to the United States, but he never enrolled. According to author Don Graham, Murphy suggested the idea and then dropped <b>it,</b> <b>possibly</b> when he realized the extent of academic preparation needed to pass the entrance exam. Murphy was one of several military personnel who received orders on 8 June 1945 to report to Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio, Texas, for temporary duty and reassignment.|$|E

5|$|The {{composition}} of the scene is a pastiche of the frontispiece of Andreas Vesalius's De humani corporis fabrica, and <b>it</b> <b>possibly</b> also borrows from Quack Physicians' Hall (c. 1730) by the Dutch artist Egbert van Heemskerck, {{who had lived in}} England and whose work Hogarth admired. An earlier source of inspiration may have been a woodcut in the 1495 Fasciculo di medicina by Johannes de Ketham which, although simpler, has many of the same elements, including the seated president flanked by two windows.|$|E
5|$|Another film {{purported to}} have been the highest-grosser is the 1972 pornographic film, Deep Throat. In 1984, Linda Lovelace testified to a United States Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on {{juvenile}} justice that the film had earned $600 million; this figure {{has been the subject of}} much speculation, since if it is accurate then the film would have made more money than Star Wars, and finished the 1970s as the highest-grossing film. The main argument against this figure is that it simply did not have a wide enough release to sustain the sort of sums that would be required for it to ultimately gross this amount. Exact figures are not known, but testimony in a federal trial in 1976—about four years into the film's release—showed the film had grossed over $25 million. Roger Ebert has reasoned <b>it</b> <b>possibly</b> did earn as much as $600 million on paper, since mobsters owned most of the adult movie theaters during this period and would launder income from drugs and prostitution through them, so probably inflated the box office receipts for the film.|$|E
5|$|Nico Ditch was {{constructed}} some {{time between the}} end of Roman rule in Britain in the early 5th century and the Norman conquest in 1066. Its original purpose is unclear, but it may have been used as a defensive fortification or as an administrative boundary. <b>It</b> <b>possibly</b> marked a 7th-century boundary for the expansionist Anglo-Saxons, or {{it may have been a}} late 8th or early 9th century boundary marker between the kingdoms of Mercia and Northumbria. In the early medieval period, the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms of Northumbria, Mercia and Wessex struggled for control over North West England, along with the Britons and the Danes. Whatever its earlier use, the ditch has been used as a boundary since at least the Middle Ages.|$|E

5|$|The mod {{received}} widespread media acclaim. Edge called DayZ the mod of the year. Wired UKs Quitin Smith said {{it could}} be the most terrifying game of 2012, and Rock Paper Shotgun's Jim Rossignol called it the best game he had played so far in 2012. PC Gamer stated the game {{was one of the most}} important things to happen to PC gaming in 2012 and included it in their 2012 list of the top five scariest PC games of all time. Metro called it one of the best games to ever to come out of PC modding and one of the single most impressive experiences available on the system. Eurogamer called it the best zombie game ever made and the break out phenomenon of PC gaming in 2012. Kotaku called <b>it</b> <b>possibly</b> the greatest zombie game of all time and the most interesting PC game of 2012. PC PowerPlay said DayZ was the most important thing to happen to PC gaming in 2012.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin of}} Iniki is unclear, but <b>it</b> <b>possibly</b> {{began as a}} {{tropical}} wave that exited the African coast on August 18. It moved westward across the unfavorable Atlantic Ocean and crossed Central America into the Pacific on the August 28. The wave continued rapidly westward and remained disorganized. Conditions slowly became more favorable, and, as the convection concentrated around a center, the wave was classified Tropical Depression Eighteen-E on September 5. At this time, the wave was located 1700miles (2700km) southwest of Cabo San Lucas or 1550miles (2500km) east-southeast of Hilo. Initially, the thunderstorm activity was not concentrated towards the center and thus the depression was not expected to intensify beyond minimal tropical storm strength. The depression continued quickly westward and remained weak until September 8, when it slowed enough to strengthen to a tropical storm.|$|E
5|$|This {{suggestion}} {{stemmed from}} the observation that many engineers relied on {{the basic principles of}} physics and mechanics to guide their work, and yet this often required inventors and engineers to become scientists as well to obtain experimental data—something that they were rarely qualified or resourced to do. Short of government funding of such research, Evans also attempted to create {{in the aftermath of the}} Steam Engineer's Guide what he called 'The Experiment Company', which would be a private research consortium to conduct reliable experiments and gather data for the benefits of subscribed members. The venture failed and Evans could find no paying stockholders to launch <b>it,</b> <b>possibly</b> due to Evans committing the new venture to developing a steam wagon of his own design. The Franklin Institute would be founded in Philadelphia a few years after Evans's death on similar principles.|$|E

5|$|As the Belgian forces, {{together}} with their French and British allies, were forced to retreat, Leopold decided that surrendering the army was the only viable course of action. On 24 May, as the government was leaving the country for exile in France, a group of ministers including Pierlot held a final meeting with Leopold at the Kasteel van Wijnendale. They called for him to {{follow the example of}} the Norwegian king, Haakon VII, and join them in exile as a symbol of continued resistance. Leopold refused, believing that as commander, he should surrender alongside his army, provoking real animosity. He also believed that, by leaving for France, the Belgian government would surrender its neutrality and become a puppet government. He also believed that, as a neutral power with no formal treaty of alliance with France or Britain, the Belgian army was not obliged to hold out as long as <b>it</b> <b>possibly</b> could if it incurred huge casualties and had no change of defending its own territory. On 28 May, after a brief attempt to form a new government of sympathetic politicians under Henri De Man and after denouncing Pierlot and his government, Leopold surrendered to the Germans and was made a prisoner of war.|$|E
5|$|In 1954, Takechi {{followed}} Susugigawa with a noh-kyōgen {{version of}} Junji Kinoshita's Yūzuru. Yūzuru {{is one of}} the most successful Japanese post-World War II plays, having received over a thousand performances at schools and theaters both within Japan and internationally since its debut in 1949. Composer Ikuma Dan wrote an opera version of the play in 1952. Since its premiere, Dan's opera has been performed more than 550 times, making <b>it</b> <b>possibly</b> the most popular opera written in Japanese. Dan was recruited to write the original music for Takechi's production of the play. Dan combined the noh-style solo vocal lines with a Western orchestra and chorus. On the same program as Yūzuru was another Takechi-directed kyōgen, Higashi wa Higashi (East is East), a parody of the kyōgen style. Among the innovations Takechi made in this play was the inclusion of a former Takarazuka actress in the usually all-male kyōgen cast. In the ultra-conservative noh and kyōgen communities, simply appearing in a rival school's production could result in an actor's excommunication from the profession. Because of the public attention drawn through Takechi's relentless publicity work and communication with the media, punitive actions against actors who worked with Takechi were avoided.|$|E
5|$|The {{navigation}} then {{passes to}} the east of Southampton Airport, while further east is the river channel and the Itchen Valley Country Park. Between the two waterways is Decoy Covert, a small wood which contained a duck decoy. The lock nearby is called Decoy Pond Lock, below which is Sandy Lock. There is little water in this section, since its main supply has been cut off, and although there are springs along this section, the channel is periodically blocked where occupation bridges have been replaced by earth embankments. Sandy Lock has much barbed wire in <b>it,</b> <b>possibly</b> dumped when the wartime defences of the airport were dismantled. The final lock on this section is Mans Bridge Lock, shortly after the modern crossing by the M27 motorway. The cut then rejoins the main river, and passes under the A27 road. The current bridge was constructed in 1975, and replaced a bailey bridge erected during the Second World War. Just below it is a single arched stone bridge dating from the early nineteenth century, which was the original course of the road. It has been restored and is used as a footbridge.|$|E
