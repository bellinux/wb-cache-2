5|$|Early {{spectral}} {{classification of}} the nuclei of the LIRGs that host hydroxyl megamasers {{indicated that the}} properties of LIRGs that host hydroxyl megamasers cannot be distinguished from the overall population of LIRGs. Roughly one third of megamaser <b>hosts</b> are classified as starburst galaxies, one quarter are classified as Seyfert 2 galaxies, and the remainder are classified as low-ionization nuclear emission-line regions, or LINERs. The optical properties of hydroxyl megamaser <b>hosts</b> and non-hosts are not significantly different. Recent infrared observations using the Spitzer Space Telescope are, however, able to distinguish hydroxyl megamaser <b>hosts</b> galaxies from non-masing LIRGs, as 10–25% of hydroxyl megamaser <b>hosts</b> show evidence for an active galactic nucleus, compared to 50–95% for non-masing LIRGs.|$|E

5|$|Ixodid ticks require three <b>hosts,</b> {{and their}} life cycle {{takes at least}} one year to complete. Up to 3,000 eggs are laid on the ground by an adult female tick. When the larvae emerge, they feed {{primarily}} on small mammals and birds. After feeding, they detach from their host and molt to nymphs on the ground, which then feed on larger <b>hosts</b> and molt to adults. Female adults attach to larger <b>hosts,</b> feed, and lay eggs, while males feed very little and occupy larger <b>hosts</b> primarily for mating.|$|E
5|$|Mites and {{nematodes}} feed on ticks, {{which are}} also a minor nutritional resource for birds. More importantly, they carry diseases as the primary <b>hosts</b> of pathogens such as spirochaetes, and without their agency, the organisms could not reach their secondary <b>hosts.</b> The diseases caused may debilitate their victims, and ticks may thus be assisting in controlling animal populations and preventing overgrazing.|$|E

40|$|Most herbivorous {{arthropods}} are <b>host</b> {{specialists and}} the question is which mechanisms drive the evolution of such specialization. The theory of antagonistic pleiotropy suggests that there is a trade-off between adaptation of herbivores to a novel <b>host</b> and their native <b>host.</b> The mutation accumulation hypothesis proposes that herbivores on a novel <b>host</b> lose their adaptation to the native <b>host</b> through the accumulation of mutations with negligible effects on performance on the novel <b>host.</b> Experimental evidence for either of the two hypotheses is scarce. We compared the fitness of two sympatric moth strains from an introduced <b>host</b> and a native <b>host.</b> The strain from the novel <b>host</b> did not perform better on this <b>host</b> than the strain from the native <b>host.</b> The strain from the novel <b>host</b> performed less well on the native <b>host</b> than did the strain from the native <b>host.</b> Hence, selection on the novel <b>host</b> did not result in noticeable gain in performance, but adaptation to the native <b>host</b> was lost. These results are more readily explained by the mutation-accumulation hypothesis than by the trade-off hypothesis...|$|R

To save the Doctor, Astrid uses a forklift to ram Max Capricorn and push him into the ship's engine. The forklift falls into the engine on top of him, seemingly killing Astrid as well.|$|E
