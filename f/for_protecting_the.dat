5|$|Calhoun's basic concern <b>for</b> <b>protecting</b> <b>the</b> {{diversity}} of minority interests {{is expressed in}} his chief contribution to political science—the idea of a concurrent majority across different groups as distinguished from a numerical majority. A concurrent majority is {{a system in which}} a minority group is permitted to exercise a sort of veto power over actions of a majority that are believed to infringe upon the minority's rights.|$|E
5|$|In {{gratitude}} <b>for</b> <b>protecting</b> <b>the</b> Christians in Nazareth and Acre, Napoleon III of France presented Aqil {{a gun and}} the Legion of Honor {{medal in}} April 1861 aboard his French vessel docked at Haifa Bay. Edward, Prince of Wales (later King of the United Kingdom) personally visited Aqil two years later to show his appreciation. Aqil offered Edward four Arabian horses, but Edward politely declined. As a token of his appreciation, Edward gave Aqil a revolver.|$|E
5|$|McKinley {{initially}} {{appeared to}} be recovering, but took {{a turn for the}} worse on September 13 as his wounds became gangrenous, and died early the next morning; Vice President Theodore Roosevelt succeeded him. After McKinley's assassination, for which Czolgosz was sentenced to death in the electric chair, Congress passed legislation to officially charge the Secret Service with the responsibility <b>for</b> <b>protecting</b> <b>the</b> President.|$|E

5|$|McKinley {{initially}} {{appeared to}} be recovering, but took {{a turn for the}} worse on September 13 as his wounds became gangrenous, and died early the next morning; Vice President Theodore Roosevelt succeeded him. Roosevelt was hiking near the top of Mt. Marcy, in New York State's Adirondack region, when a runner located him to convey the bad news. After McKinley's murder, for which Czolgosz was put to death in the electric chair, the United States Congress passed legislation to officially charge the Secret Service with the responsibility <b>for</b> <b>protecting</b> <b>the</b> president.|$|E
5|$|The {{military}} {{arm of the}} Polish Underground State consisted {{primarily of}} various branches of the Armia Krajowa (AK) and, until 1942, the Union of Armed Struggle. This arm of the state was designed to prepare the Polish society for a future fight for the country's liberation. Apart from armed resistance, sabotage, intelligence, training, and propaganda, the state's military arm was responsible for maintaining communication with the London-based government in exile, and <b>for</b> <b>protecting</b> <b>the</b> civilian arm of the state.|$|E
5|$|Royal bodyguards {{served as}} the closest members to the king at court and on the battlefield. They were split into two categories: the agema of the hypaspistai, a type of ancient special forces usually {{numbering}} in the hundreds, and a smaller group of men handpicked by the king either for their individual merits or to honor the noble families to which they belonged. Therefore, the bodyguards, limited in number and forming the king's inner circle, were not always responsible <b>for</b> <b>protecting</b> <b>the</b> king's life {{on and off the}} battlefield; their title and office was more a mark of distinction, perhaps used to quell rivalries between aristocratic houses.|$|E

5|$|The IJN {{continued}} to suffer losses and damage to its ships {{in attempting to}} keep the Japanese on Guadalcanal resupplied. One destroyer was sunk by American warships at the Battle of Tassafaronga on 30 November. Another destroyer plus a submarine were sunk and two destroyers damaged by American PT boat and CAF air attacks during subsequent resupply missions from 3–12 December. Compounding the navy's frustration, {{very few of the}} supplies carried on these missions actually reached Japanese army forces on the island. Combined Fleet leaders began telling their army counterparts the losses and damage to warships engaged in the resupply effort threatened future strategic plans <b>for</b> <b>protecting</b> <b>the</b> Japanese Empire.|$|E
5|$|The {{evacuation}} proceeded without {{interference from}} the PAVN. Aircraft flying air {{cover for the}} evacuation reported being tracked with surface to air radar {{in the vicinity of}} Bien Hoa Air Base (which had fallen to the PAVN on 25 April), but there were no missile launches. The Hanoi leadership, reckoning that completion of the evacuation would lessen the risk of American intervention, had apparently instructed General Dũng not to target the airlift itself. Members of the police in Saigon had been promised evacuation in exchange <b>for</b> <b>protecting</b> <b>the</b> American evacuation buses and control of the crowds in the city during the evacuation. Disgruntled ARVN troops repeatedly hit American helicopters with small arms fire throughout the evacuation, without causing serious damage. Despite receiving sporadic NVA AAA fire, USAF and USN aircraft made no attacks on AAA or SAM sites during the evacuation.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to following the main storyline, the player character will witness {{and can take}} part in random events they encounter as they explore the game world. These include public hangings, ambushes, pleas for assistance, encounters with strangers, ride-by shootings, and dangerous animal attacks. For example, if {{a group of people}} ride into town firing guns in the air, Marston can kill them, and will receive a bonus of honor and fame <b>for</b> <b>protecting</b> <b>the</b> town. The player character can also take part in optional side activities, most of which give the player money. These side activities include dueling, in which the player character must be a faster draw than their opponent; bounty hunting, where Marston can hunt down bounties on wanted posters; herb collecting, which involves gathering exotic plants from around the game map for town medics; gambling, where people can be found playing games such as poker and Five Finger Fillet; and hunting, in which the player can kill wild animals and skin their hides.|$|E

5|$|No.79 Squadron {{was formed}} at RAAF Station Laverton in Victoria on 26April 1943 {{under the command}} of flying ace Squadron Leader Alan Rawlinson. The squadron's {{intended}} role was to use Spitfire Vc fighters to provide 'high cover' escort for the RAAF's P-40 Kittyhawk-equipped units which were engaging Japanese forces in the New Guinea Campaign. This requirement was considered urgent, and the Chief of the Air Staff, Air Vice Marshal George Jones, directed that No.79 Squadron receive priority for the RAAF's limited stock of Spitfires. The squadron moved to Wooloomanata Aerodrome several days after it was formed, and received its first Spitfires on 3May. While at Wooloomanata No.79 Squadron undertook training exercises to prepare for combat. The allocation of 24 Spitfires to the squadron led to No. 1 Wing RAAF, which was stationed near Darwin and responsible <b>for</b> <b>protecting</b> <b>the</b> town against air attack, to suffer a shortage of these aircraft during June and July.|$|E
5|$|Throughout his rule, Aqil {{remained}} at least nominally {{in service to}} the Ottoman Empire, which paid him <b>for</b> <b>protecting</b> <b>the</b> roads of northern Palestine from Bedouin raids and for maintaining the security of this region. He also exacted his own tolls on the local population in return for ensuring their security. His friendly ties with the European governments were partially due to his protection of the local Christian and Jewish communities in Galilee, including his protection of Nazareth from the 1860 massacres that occurred in Ottoman Syria. Aqil's relationship with the authorities was generally tense and he rebelled directly or indirectly against their local representatives. As a consequence of this frayed relationship, Aqil's employment would frequently be terminated when his activities or influence perturbed the authorities and then reinstated when his services were needed. By {{the time of his}} death, his influence had declined significantly. He was buried in his Galilee stronghold of I'billin.|$|E
