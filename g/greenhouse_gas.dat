5|$|Food {{waste is}} {{generally}} considered to have a damaging effect on the environment; a reduction in food waste is considered critical if the UK is to meet obligations under the European Landfill Directive to reduce biodegradable waste going to landfill and favourable considering international targets on climate change, limiting <b>greenhouse</b> <b>gas</b> emissions. When disposed of in landfill, food waste releases methane, a relatively damaging <b>greenhouse</b> <b>gas,</b> and leachate, a toxin capable of considerable groundwater pollution. The food supply chain accounts for a fifth of UK carbon emissions; the production, storage and transportation of food to homes requires large amounts of energy. The effects of stopping food waste that can potentially be prevented has been likened to removing one in five cars from UK roads.|$|E

5|$|Climate models {{predict that}} {{increased}} <b>greenhouse</b> <b>gas</b> emissions cause a cooling of the mesosphere, which {{would lead to}} more frequent and widespread occurrences of noctilucent clouds.

40|$|We {{assess the}} roles of {{long-lived}} <b>greenhouse</b> <b>gases</b> and ozone depletion in driving meridional surface pressure gradients in the southern extratropics; these gradients are {{a defining feature of}} the Southern Annular Mode. Stratospheric ozone depletion is thought to have caused a strengthening of this mode during summer, with increasing long-lived <b>greenhouse</b> <b>gases</b> playing a secondary role. Using a coupled atmosphere-ocean chemistry-climate model, we show that there is cancelation between the direct, radiative effect of increasing <b>greenhouse</b> <b>gases</b> by the also substantial indirect—chemical and dynamical—feedbacks that <b>greenhouse</b> <b>gases</b> have via their impact on ozone. This sensitivity of the mode to greenhouse gas-induced ozone changes suggests that a consistent implementation of ozone changes due to long-lived <b>greenhouse</b> <b>gases</b> in climate models benefits the simulation of this important aspect of Southern Hemisphere climate...|$|R
