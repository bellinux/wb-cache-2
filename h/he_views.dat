5|$|This tell-all memoir {{was called}} {{entertaining}} but {{was met with}} generally mixed reviews. While it was valued as an insider account of a well-known institution, the author used the book to aggressively defend his views without relating to opposing views, and elaborate on what <b>he</b> <b>views</b> to be the CBC's deficiencies.|$|E
5|$|When <b>he</b> <b>views</b> the body, Frank gets various vivid {{visions of}} the crime. His {{knowledge}} of various details unknown to the others unsettles Bletcher. Frank and a fellow member of the Millennium Group named Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn) officially join the investigation.|$|E
50|$|In his {{capacity}} {{as chairman of}} the 2013 Knesset election committee, Rubinstein forced the removal of several television ads, one from Shas, which <b>he</b> <b>viewed</b> as insulting to Russian-speaking immigrants, and the others from Otzma LeYisrael, which <b>he</b> <b>viewed</b> as racist against Arabs.|$|R

5|$|Peter Hitchens, with {{particular}} reference to events which {{occurred in the}} Soviet Union, argues that his brother's verdict on religion is misguided, and that faith in God is both a safeguard against the collapse of civilisation into moral chaos and the best antidote to what <b>he</b> <b>views</b> as the dangerous idea of earthly perfection through utopianism. The Rage Against God received a mostly favourable reception in the media.|$|E
5|$|While not portraying Akira sympathetically, {{the film}} does offer a socio-political {{view on the}} origins and inevitability of such {{criminal}} types in society. The tenements in which the youths reside are depicted as inhospitable and sterile. Lacking education, proper role models and moral codes, critic Bryan Hartzheim posited, crime and base pleasures are their most open recourse. They seem aware of the injustices in their environments and rail against society at large. However, Akira is illustrated as being capable of innocent pleasure, particularly in one fleeting scene in which he and his black friend Gil (Chico Rolands), whom <b>he</b> <b>views</b> as a fellow outcast, frolic in the ocean.|$|E
5|$|Within the verse, Coleridge {{seeks to}} {{discover}} the environment that his friends are exploring because {{he is unable to}} join them. The poem links the lime-tree bower to the Quantocks where the Wordsworths, Lamb and Fricker were out walking. Although he is separated from them, the poet connects to his distant friends and they are able to share in a common view on life. The poem describes Coleridge's loneliness and solitude throughout, yet he is glad that his friends are able to experience nature. Because of this, he is able to tolerate his prison, which <b>he</b> <b>views</b> as merely physical rather than intellectual.|$|E

5|$|Initial {{writing for}} the first season was split between the Wachowskis and Straczynski. The Wachowskis wrote episodes one, two, three, seven and eight while Straczynski wrote episodes four, five, six, nine and ten. Then the Wachowskis rewrote Straczynski's scripts and vice versa. Straczynski said {{a good portion of}} the writing was done by just Lana and himself. Straczynski {{believes}} writing with the Wachowskis helped mask each other's weaknesses and also allowed each party to learn from the other. He recognizes action and plot as their biggest strengths but structure as their weakness. On the other hand, <b>he</b> <b>views</b> himself as really good on structure but weak on action. Straczynski said the way he works is by first developing the entire script in his head, from the first sentence to the last, before sitting down to write it, while the Wachowskis begin by writing the scenes they have already developed, leaving the others they haven't figured out yet for later, while they constantly move the pieces around to see in which way they work best.|$|E

25|$|Chomsky {{believes}} anarchism is {{a direct}} descendant of liberalism, perfecting the ideals of personal liberty and minimal government of the Enlightenment. <b>He</b> <b>views</b> libertarian socialism thus as the logical conclusion of liberalism, extending its democratic ideals into the economy, making anarchism an inherently socialist philosophy.|$|E
25|$|Ford {{disagrees with}} {{some aspects of}} {{traditional}} Adventist end-time beliefs. However, he still defends a conservative view of Scripture, the Seventh-day Sabbath, and a vegetarian lifestyle. <b>He</b> <b>views</b> the writings of Ellen G. White as useful devotionally, {{but not at the}} level of canon.|$|E
25|$|Cole {{tends to}} value {{multinational}} (and especially UN) initiatives over unilateral military ones. He favors multi-ethnic states over separatist movements. Given his {{background in the}} 1960s and 1970s religious counter-culture, <b>he</b> <b>views</b> Islam (along with other religions) as essentially good, but distorted by certain of its political appropriators (and critics).|$|E

25|$|Critiquing what <b>he</b> <b>views</b> as {{both sides}} feeling {{threatened}} by the narrative of the other, HaKohen frequently emphasizes the need for Israelis and Palestinians to open themselves up to understanding the narrative of the other {{in order to work}} towards constructing a larger narrative inclusive enough to encompass both ostensibly rival narratives.|$|E
25|$|Deputy Governor Thomas Danforth: The {{chief judge}} of the court. <b>He</b> <b>views</b> the {{proceedings}} {{as an opportunity to}} cement his power and influence, eagerly convicting anyone brought before him.
