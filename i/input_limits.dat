Unfortunately, it turns off and creates a high-impedance return path when trying to turn the transistor off. Although the base charge has been minimized, it is now more difficult to draw charge out of the base.|$|E

The calculation can be made at either the intersection of the two limits or at the point of optimum performance as the density and temperature are varied along the limiting boundaries. Two measures of performance are available for this purpose: the ignition margin or the confine-ment level required to achieve a prescribed ignition margin. The time-dependent calculation can be configured to yield either the evolution of plasma energy as a function of time or, via an iteration scheme, the amount of auxiliary power re-quired to achieve a desired final plasma energy...|$|E

40|$|Modal {{decoupling}} is {{a common}} approach in engineering to analyze the dynamic behavior of mechanical systems and simplify the controller design. By bringing the system dynamics into diagonal form, one obtains SISO systems for which independent feedback strategies can be implemented. Furthermore, there exist control laws that utilize the available control inputs up to their limits, e. g. optimization-based controllers. While these limits can be applied easily in original space, a still open question is which bounds are feasible in modal space, as one property of the (linear) decoupling transformation is that the actuator constraints become coupled. In this paper, we {{address the problem of}} finding the largest possible <b>input</b> <b>limits</b> in modal space that allow independent SISO control and meet the real actuator saturations at the same time. We identify how the controller structure influences the search for the modal constraints and find the limits via optimization.

40|$|Dual-stage {{actuator}} (DSA) servomechanisms {{have attracted}} considerable industrial {{applications for the}} benefits of both large working range, high positioning accuracy and fast response, which are typically difficult to achieve simultaneously by a single-stage actuator. However, the control design of such systems suffers from hard constraints due to actuator <b>input</b> <b>limits</b> and position output profile requirements. For setpoint tracking tasks, the controllers with the merit of easy implementation have been reported but come {{at the cost of}} performance limitations such as the risk of system instability due to ignoring constraints during the design process or the requirement of retuning the control parameters for different setpoints. This paper presents a model predictive control (MPC) method to obtain an universal DSA controller, which explictly considers the design constraints during the design optimization and does not require retuning for different setpoints. Simulations are studied to verify that the MPC can offer versatile trajectories for each actuator and achieve more robust tracking performance with respect to different setpoints in comparison with the conventional linear feedback-feedforward controller and the existing composite nonlinear feedback controller...|$|E

Instead of generating a single solution, they produce a sequence of incremental solutions corresponding to the input seen so far. An online algorithm's ignorance of future <b>inputs</b> <b>limits</b> its ability to produce optimal solutions. The incremental nature of its solutions is also an obstacle. The two factors can be differentiated by examining the corresponding incremental algorithm, which has knowledge of future inputs, but must still provide a competitive solution at each step.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Friction stir (FS) welding is a {{relatively}} new solid-state welding process that offers high levels of joint performance with minimal preparation and little post-weld dressing. The high levels of plastic work induced in the weld zone produce a very fine grain size in the stirred region of the weld (e. g. the nugget), while the low heat <b>input</b> <b>limits</b> residual stresses to a low fraction of the proof strength of the weld metal. These effects are generally beneficial to weld dynamic performance. The peculiar thermomechanical history in the FS weld region leads, however, to particular defects with some unusual effects on crack path, whose occurrence partly depends on crack speed, or growth rate. This paper presents observations regarding specific influences of the friction stir welding process on crack paths and dynamic performance for 5083 -H 321 and 5383 -H 321 aluminium alloys, and proposes an explanation for the observations in terms of the weld microstructures and thermomechanical history. The insights presented in this paper can be used to inform optimisation of the weld process parameters, through on-line feedback and control of tool geometry, force footprint, torque and temperature...|$|E
40|$|The {{output of}} the {{controller}} is said to exceed the <b>input</b> <b>limits</b> of the plant being controlled when a control system operates in a non-linear region. This process is called the windup phenomenon. The windup phenomenon is not preferable in the control system because it leads to performance degradation, such as overshoot and system instability. Many anti-windup strategies involve switching, where the integral component differently operates between the linear and the non-linear states. The range of state for the non-overshoot performance is better illustrated by the boundary integral error plane than the proportional–integral (PI) plane in windup inspection. This study proposes a PI controller with a separate closed-loop integral controller and reference value set {{with respect to the}} input command and external torque. The PI controller is compared with existing conventional proportional integral, conditional integration, tracking back calculation, and integral state prediction schemes by using ScicosLab simulations. The controller is also experimentally verified on a direct current motor under no-load and loading conditions. The proposed controller shows a promising potential with its ability to eliminate overshoot with short settling time using the decoupling mode in both conditions. ...|$|E
40|$|Windup {{refers to}} the {{phenomenon}} where a control system operates in a nonlinear region when the controller's output exceeds the <b>input</b> <b>limits</b> of the plant being controlled. Windup can lead to performance degradation in terms of overshoot, settling time and even system stability. Many anti-windup strategies involve switching and manipulating the integral control component in various ways when saturation occurs aiming to bring control back into the linear region. For better insight into windup, the proportional–integral (PI) plane is now used {{as a means to}} explain the phenomenon in terms of the controller's signals. A PI controller with a built-in closed-loop integral controller that has a reference set based on the input command and external torque is proposed. The performance for this proposed method is compared against existing conditional integration, tracking back calculation and integral state prediction schemes on second and third order systems using MATLAB/SIMULINK simulations of an induction motor and a DC motor respectively. The proposed controller showed promising potential with its ability to eliminate overshoot in both no load and full load conditions due to the decoupling of its parameters from its response and has the shortest settling time when compared against existing schemes, even in the presence of noise...|$|E
