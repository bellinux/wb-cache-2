5|$|Irregular <b>galaxies</b> <b>are</b> chaotic in appearance, and {{are neither}} spiral nor elliptical. About {{a quarter of}} all <b>galaxies</b> <b>are</b> irregular, and the {{peculiar}} shapes of such galaxies {{may be the result of}} gravitational interaction.|$|E
5|$|The largest <b>galaxies</b> <b>are</b> giant {{elliptical}}s. Many elliptical <b>galaxies</b> <b>are</b> {{believed to}} form {{due to the}} interaction of galaxies, resulting in a collision and merger. They can grow to enormous sizes (compared to spiral galaxies, for example), and giant elliptical <b>galaxies</b> <b>are</b> often found near the core of large galaxy clusters.|$|E
5|$|Irregular <b>galaxies</b> <b>are</b> {{galaxies that}} can not be readily {{classified}} into an elliptical or spiral morphology.|$|E
50|$|The <b>galaxy</b> <b>is</b> {{one of the}} {{brightest}} two galaxies in the IC 342/Maffei Group of galaxies, one of the <b>galaxy</b> groups that <b>is</b> closest to the Local Group. The <b>galaxy</b> <b>was</b> discovered by William Frederick Denning in 1895. Edwin Hubble first thought it to be in the Local Group, but later it was demonstrated that the <b>galaxy</b> <b>is</b> outside the Local Group.|$|R
5000|$|This spiral <b>galaxy</b> <b>is</b> notably asymmetric. The {{spiral arms}} {{on the south side}} of the <b>galaxy</b> <b>are</b> chaotic in {{appearance}}, whereas the spiral {{arms on the}} north side of the <b>galaxy</b> <b>are</b> very well-defined. Also, the spiral arms {{on the south side of}} the disk extend twice as far from the galaxy's nucleus as the spiral arms on the north side. [...] Because of the fragmentary appearance of some of the spiral arms, this <b>galaxy</b> <b>is</b> classified as a flocculent galaxy.|$|R
40|$|We present {{here the}} results based on {{analysis}} of broad band optical images of radio loud and radio quiet galaxies {{selected from a}} set of x-ray galaxies. Data reduction techniques, and surface photometry using the IRAF data reduction package are described. The radial surface brightness profile of each <b>galaxy</b> <b>is</b> obtained. The disc, bulge, and nucleus of the <b>galaxy</b> <b>are</b> modeled based on the estimated brightness profile. The model of the <b>galaxy</b> <b>is</b> constructed, which is subtracted from the observed image to enhance the small scale features in the galaxy. Color maps of the <b>galaxy</b> <b>are</b> obtained and {{compared with those of}} normal galaxies. The optical properties of the <b>galaxy</b> <b>are</b> compared with its x-ray and radio properties...|$|R
5|$|Peculiar <b>galaxies</b> <b>are</b> galactic {{formations}} {{that develop}} unusual properties due to tidal interactions with other galaxies.|$|E
5|$|<b>Galaxies</b> <b>are</b> {{categorized}} {{according to}} their visual morphology as elliptical, spiral, or irregular. Many <b>galaxies</b> <b>are</b> thought to have black holes at their active centers. The Milky Way's central black hole, known as Sagittarius A*, has a mass four million {{times greater than the}} Sun. As of March 2016, GN-z11 is the oldest and most distant observed galaxy with a comoving distance of 32 billion light-years from Earth, and observed as it existed just 400 million years after the Big Bang.|$|E
5|$|Interactions between <b>galaxies</b> <b>are</b> {{relatively}} frequent, {{and they}} {{can play an important}} role in galactic evolution. Near misses between galaxies result in warping distortions due to tidal interactions, and may cause some exchange of gas and dust.|$|E
50|$|The <b>galaxy</b> <b>was</b> first {{reported}} by James Dunlop on May 10, 1826 with his 9-inch reflector telescope and descripted it as exceedingly faint. The <b>galaxy</b> <b>was</b> also spotted by John Herschel and added {{it in the}} General Catalogue of Nebulae and Clusters as number 3572. The <b>galaxy</b> <b>is</b> located only 15 degrees from the galactic plane.|$|R
5000|$|This faint <b>galaxy</b> <b>is</b> {{located about}} 372 million light-years away from Earth. ESO-LV 2860520 {{calculated}} velocity is 8680 km/s. The <b>galaxy</b> <b>is</b> eitherÂ considered an Elliptical or a Lenticular.|$|R
50|$|The Ford <b>Galaxy</b> <b>was</b> {{reviewed}} by What Car?, {{and was given}} 4 out of 5 stars. They added that the <b>Galaxy</b> <b>was</b> more fun to drive than most MPVs.|$|R
5|$|Most <b>galaxies</b> <b>are</b> {{organized}} into distinct shapes {{that allow for}} classification schemes. They are commonly divided into spiral, elliptical and Irregular galaxies.|$|E
5|$|Seyfert <b>galaxies</b> <b>are</b> {{one of the}} {{two largest}} groups of active galaxies, along with quasars. They have quasar-like nuclei (very luminous, distant and bright sources of {{electromagnetic}} radiation) with very high surface brightnesses but unlike quasars, their host <b>galaxies</b> <b>are</b> clearly detectable. Seyfert galaxies account for about 10% of all galaxies. Seen in visible light, most Seyfert galaxies look like normal spiral galaxies, but when studied under other wavelengths, the luminosity of their cores is equivalent to the luminosity of whole galaxies the size of the Milky Way.|$|E
5|$|Starburst <b>galaxies</b> <b>are</b> {{the result}} of a galactic {{collision}} that can result in the formation of an elliptical galaxy.|$|E
50|$|The recessional {{velocity}} of a <b>galaxy</b> <b>is</b> usually {{calculated from the}} redshift observed in its emitted electromagnetic radiation. The distance to the <b>galaxy</b> <b>is</b> then estimated using Hubble's Law.|$|R
25|$|The Fornax Dwarf <b>galaxy</b> <b>is</b> a dwarf <b>galaxy</b> that <b>is</b> {{part of the}} Local Group of <b>galaxies.</b> It <b>is</b> {{not visible}} in amateur telescopes, despite its {{relatively}} small distance of 500,000 light-years.|$|R
5000|$|The {{first four}} S0 <b>galaxies</b> that <b>were</b> {{identified}} as polar-ring <b>galaxies</b> <b>were</b> NGC 2685, NGC 4650A, A 0136 -0801, [...] and ESO 415 -G26. [...] While these <b>galaxies</b> have <b>been</b> extensively studied, many other polar-ring <b>galaxies</b> have since <b>been</b> identified. Polar-ring S0 <b>galaxies</b> may <b>be</b> found around 0.5% of all nearby lenticular <b>galaxies,</b> and it <b>is</b> possible that 5% of lenticular galaxies {{may have had}} polar rings {{at some point during}} their lifetimes.|$|R
5|$|The Milky Way and Andromeda <b>galaxies</b> <b>are</b> {{expected}} to collide in ~4.5 billion years, merging {{to form a}} giant elliptical galaxy or a large disc galaxy.|$|E
5|$|According to SIMBAD, WASP-13 {{was first}} {{observed}} in 1997, {{when it was}} catalogued by astronomers measuring the proper motion of stars in regions of the sky where <b>galaxies</b> <b>are</b> detected. Between November 27, 2006, and April 1, 2007, the SuperWASP-North telescope in the Canary Islands observed WASP-13; {{analysis of the data}} suggested that a planet could be in the orbit of the star.|$|E
5|$|As {{the name}} suggests, an {{elliptical}} galaxy has the cross-sectional {{shape of an}} ellipse. The stars move along random orbits with no preferred direction. These galaxies contain little or no interstellar dust, few star-forming regions, and generally older stars. Elliptical <b>galaxies</b> <b>are</b> more commonly found {{at the core of}} galactic clusters, and may have been formed through mergers of large galaxies.|$|E
2500|$|The Andromeda <b>Galaxy</b> <b>is</b> {{claimed to}} be [...] "almost one million" [...] light years away, repeating the {{understandings}} of the 1920s, but the <b>galaxy</b> <b>is</b> now understood to be 2.5 million light years away.|$|R
5000|$|The Tadpole <b>Galaxy</b> <b>is</b> a {{disrupted}} barred {{spiral galaxy}} located 420 million light-years from Earth toward the northern constellation Draco. Its most dramatic feature is a massive trail of stars about 280,000 light-years long; {{the size of the}} <b>galaxy</b> has <b>been</b> attributed to a merger with a smaller <b>galaxy</b> that <b>is</b> believed to have occurred about 100 million years ago. [...] The <b>galaxy</b> <b>is</b> filled with bright blue star clusters.|$|R
50|$|CALIFA {{data are}} made public through regular {{releases}} (DR). DR1, containing 200 data cubes of 100 <b>galaxies,</b> <b>was</b> released 1 November 2012. DR2, containing 400 data cubes of 200 <b>galaxies,</b> <b>was</b> released on 1 October 2014.|$|R
5|$|Clusters {{of galaxies}} consist of {{hundreds}} {{to thousands of}} galaxies bound together by gravity. Clusters of <b>galaxies</b> <b>are</b> often dominated by a single giant elliptical galaxy, known as the brightest cluster galaxy, which, over time, tidally destroys its satellite galaxies and adds their mass to its own.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{prominence}} of large elliptical and spiral galaxies, most galaxies in the Universe are dwarf galaxies. These <b>galaxies</b> <b>are</b> relatively small when compared with other galactic formations, being about one hundredth {{the size of the}} Milky Way, containing only a few billion stars. Ultra-compact dwarf galaxies have recently been discovered that are only 100parsecs across.|$|E
5|$|Possibly {{related to}} active galactic nuclei (as well as starburst regions) are low-ionization nuclear {{emission}}-line regions (LINERs). The emission from LINER-type galaxies {{is dominated by}} weakly ionized elements. The excitation sources for the weakly ionized lines include post-AGB stars, AGN, and shocks. Approximately one-third of nearby <b>galaxies</b> <b>are</b> classified as containing LINER nuclei.|$|E
5|$|In 1950, radio {{emission}} from the Andromeda <b>Galaxy</b> <b>was</b> detected by Hanbury Brown and Cyril Hazard at Jodrell Bank Observatory. The first radio {{maps of the}} <b>galaxy</b> <b>were</b> made in the 1950s by John Baldwin and collaborators at the Cambridge Radio Astronomy Group. The core of the Andromeda <b>Galaxy</b> <b>is</b> called 2C 56 in the 2C radio astronomy catalog. In 2009, the first planet may have been discovered in the Andromeda <b>Galaxy.</b> This <b>was</b> detected using a technique called microlensing, which {{is caused by the}} deflection of light by a massive object.|$|R
50|$|The Sculptor Dwarf Irregular <b>Galaxy</b> (SDIG) <b>is</b> an {{irregular}} <b>galaxy</b> {{in the constellation}} Sculptor. The <b>galaxy</b> <b>was</b> discovered in 1976.|$|R
50|$|In the 19th century, {{the exact}} nature of <b>galaxies</b> <b>was</b> not yet understood, and the early catalogs simply grouped {{together}} open clusters, globular clusters, nebulas, and galaxies: the Messier catalog has 110 in total. The Andromeda <b>Galaxy</b> <b>is</b> Messier object 31, or M31; the Whirlpool <b>Galaxy</b> <b>is</b> M51. The New General Catalogue (NGC, J. L. E. Dreyer 1888) was much larger and contained nearly 8,000 objects, still mixing galaxies with nebulas and star clusters.|$|R
5|$|Spiral galaxies, {{like the}} Milky Way, produce new generations of stars {{as long as}} they have dense {{molecular}} clouds of interstellar hydrogen in their spiral arms. Elliptical <b>galaxies</b> <b>are</b> largely devoid of this gas, and so form few new stars. The supply of star-forming material is finite; once stars have converted the available supply of hydrogen into heavier elements, new star formation will come to an end.|$|E
5|$|The {{wealth of}} galaxies at {{different}} stages of their evolution also allowed astronomers to estimate the variation in the rate of star formation over the lifetime of the Universe. While estimates of the redshifts of HDF <b>galaxies</b> <b>are</b> somewhat crude, astronomers believe that star formation was occurring at its maximum rate 8â10 billion years ago, and has decreased by a factor of about 10 since then.|$|E
5|$|A {{spiral galaxy}} is {{organized}} into a flat, rotating disk, usually with a prominent bulge or {{bar at the}} center, and trailing bright arms that spiral outward. The arms are dusty regions of star formation within which massive young stars produce a blue tint. Spiral <b>galaxies</b> <b>are</b> typically surrounded by a halo of older stars. Both the Milky Way {{and one of our}} nearest galaxy neighbors, the Andromeda Galaxy, are spiral galaxies.|$|E
40|$|We present {{new data}} {{obtained}} with the Submillimeter Array for {{a sample of}} fourteen nearby luminous and ultraluminous infrared <b>galaxies.</b> The <b>galaxies</b> <b>were</b> selected to have distances DL 11. 4. The <b>galaxies</b> <b>were</b> observed with spatial resolutions of order...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the books}} and radio series, the President of the <b>Galaxy</b> <b>is</b> figurehead who is [...] "elected by that assembly". In the movie, however, the President of the <b>Galaxy</b> <b>is</b> a two-horse popular vote between Zaphod Beeblebrox and Humma Kavula.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "{{distance}}" [...] of a {{far away}} galaxy {{depends on what}} distance measurement you use. With a redshift of 3.77, light from this active <b>galaxy</b> <b>is</b> estimated to have taken around 11.7 billion years to reach us. [...] But since this <b>galaxy</b> <b>is</b> receding from Earth at an estimated rate of 274,681 km/s (the speed of light is 299,792 km/s), the present (co-moving) distance to this <b>galaxy</b> <b>is</b> estimated to be around 22.7 billion light-years (6947 Mpc).|$|R
