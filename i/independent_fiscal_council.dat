The governing parties do not have sufficient votes in the Chamber to have the bill passed alone, and require the support of TOP 09. While TOP 09 supports the Fiscal Compact, they have said they will only support ratification if the Czech Republic declares itself bound by all provisions of the treaty immediately, rather than once they adopt the euro. In February 2015 the Czech government introduced bills which would enact some provisions of the Fiscal Compact into Czech law. [...] A constitutional amendment was also proposed to embed the provisions in the Czech constitution. [...] The draft reform package would introduce a debt rule for the general government as a whole as well as separately for local governments, transpose into national legislation crucial elements of Council Directive 2011/85/EU on budgetary frameworks, implement a modified expenditure rule {{that is consistent with}} the Medium-Term Objective, establish an <b>independent</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>council</b> and provisions to improve transparency and fiscal data reporting.

40|$|There {{is growing}} {{interest}} {{in the role of}} independent fiscal institutions, or fiscal councils, in helping to improve fiscal performance. This article provides some guidance on the scope for improving fiscal performance through fiscal councils based on the available literature and the range of fiscal institutions in the OECD countries. The effectiveness of fiscal councils hinges on several factors, including having full autonomy within the scope of their mandates, active and unfettered dissemination of their analysis, and their credibility. Experience and empirical evidence suggest that delegating macroeconomic forecasting to an <b>independent</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>council</b> can indeed reduce forecasting bias. There is some empirical evidence that independent fiscal institutions can buttress a government’s capacity to comply with a numerical rule. Good fiscal institutions are a necessary condition for achieving disciplined fiscal performance. Experience demonstrates, however, that their existence is not sufficient. Without strong and sustained political commitment to a medium-term fiscal goal and, where relevant, to the mandate of a fiscal council, durable improvements in fiscal performance will remain elusive.

Herewith, policy rules are discussed as substitutes for democracy. We show for the monetary and fiscal policy case that democratic legitimacy and agency independence cannot be reconciled by obliging the independent agent to follow rules: Given data, model and goal uncertainty, respective ‘optimal ’ solutions adopted by experts can be derived for many different mental and cognitive constructions of economic causalities and preferences regarding economic policy goals. The respective agent will – with or without a rule – act according to the wise men’s belief.

40|$|Fiscal institutions, {{along with}} fiscal rules and {{budgetary}} procedures, are {{elements of the}} institutional environment of fiscal policy. Well pursued fiscal policy {{is reflected in the}} fiscal situation of a given country. The activities of many EU member countries and of Poland, done up till now, have been insufficient to keep the discipline in public finance. The effect of the lack of the discipline is a long-term budget deficit and public debt. According to the studies by the European Commission, the level of budgetary deficit in the countries with an independent fiscal institution was considerably lower than that in the countries without such an institution. Independent fiscal institutions in the European Union member countries and in the world differ according to their tasks, rights and responsibilities. It results predominantly from the political conditions, existing institutional arrangements and from the challenges facing fiscal policy in particular countries. The aim of the article is to indicate the possibility to create in Poland an independent institution which would support the maintaining discipline of public finance and increase the transparency of the fiscal policy pursued by the public authorities. The following hypothesis is stated in the article: in Poland there is a real opportunity for functioning of an <b>independent</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>council,</b> which would act as a guardian of the condition of public finance and as an advisor, and would watch the pursuing of a correct fiscal policy.  </p...|$|E
40|$|The Law on Fiscal Responsibility adopted late 2008 {{is a new}} {{element in}} Hungarian fiscal policy, {{although}} not without precedent. Under the law, the Parliament and the Government limit themselves to prevent high fiscal deficits and a further increase in public indebtedness, experienced in recent years. Budget planning turns into a three-year process, hardening over time. As a first step, the targeted primary (non-interest) budget balance {{is subject to the}} requirement that the stock of government debt cannot rise in real terms. However, ex post, the law allows for deviations in fiscal performance-including those reflecting the effect of so-called automatic stabilizers-attributable to factors beyond the control of the authorities. This means that the actual deficit is not necessarily equal to the deficit path consistent with the real debt limit, but it may fluctuate around this trend over the medium term. In addition, the law prescribes observance of the pay-go principle. Finally, it provides for the establishment of an <b>independent</b> <b>Fiscal</b> <b>Council</b> entrusted with monitoring compliance with the rules and with transparency standards. We evaluated the law according to the Kopits–Symansky criteria applied in the international literature. In most aspects, the law exhibits favourable properties, consistent with the criteria, although inevitably at the expense of simplicity. The assessment suggests that the law would benefit from extending coverage of the rules to local governments. Moreover, enforceability of the rules would be strengthened if the law were adopted by a qualified legislative majority. fiscal rules, budget planning, Fiscal Council. ...|$|E

30|$|Questions {{over the}} form of {{knowledge}} {{and the role of}} analysis in relation to policy making are varied and contentious [1]. Tensions in theory and practice exist between claims to objectivity and appeals to deliberative processes in the constitution of policy making [2]. Such tensions are exacerbated when policy making’s inherent orientation to the future is made explicit. Not only does policy’s concern with that which has not yet happened bring in to question the application of a range of orthodox forms of research [3, 4], but it also brings to the fore questions of how possible and preferred futures are to be identified, discussed and realised [5]. Such tensions regarding the role of knowledge and the nature of policy making are epitomised and can be explored through an examination of the status and operations of <b>independent</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>councils</b> (IFCs).

40|$|The {{crisis has}} hit central, eastern and {{south-eastern}} European countries (CESEE) hard, {{though there are}} significant differences within the region. • In many CESEE countries the private sector was behind credit booms that created vulnerabilities, but fiscal policy was also – {{and continues to be}} – pro-cyclical. This amplified both the pre-crisis boom and the bust during the crisis. • In combating the crisis, CESEE countries face direct fiscal impacts and changes in the international economic environment. With a few exceptions (such as Russia and other less-vulnerable countries), lack of scope for implementing Keynesian policies has also been an obstacle, though it is Keynesian policies that the crisis calls for. • Like previous emerging market crises, the current crisis should be an opportunity to introduce reforms to avoid future pro-cyclical fiscal policies, increase the budgeting quality, and raise credibility.

40|$|Conclusion] The {{overall picture}} of {{the current status of}} {{implementation}} of the Fiscal Compact into national law is rather ambiguous. On the one side, there are countries like Spain and Portugal, which have been severely affected by the Euro crisis, and appeared to have learned a lesson and implemented promising and strong fiscal rules. On the other side, it is worrisome that Greece, of all countries, has not put forward any draft bill so far and failed to meet the deadlines set by the MoU. The overall picture is also somewhat ambiguous because many countries have not anchored their budget rules into their constitution, but rely on simple laws instead. While the vast majority of countries have created the legal basis for the creation of an <b>independent</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>council,</b> only some have already appointed the members. There seems to be a general tendency towards staffing the councils with members who are rather not involved in politics but are academic economists, and in some cases even are recruited from other countries. This finding fuels the expectation that the fiscal councils are not only de jure but also de facto independent in their work. However, one also has to note that the appointing process for fiscal councils is still a much politicized procedure, with the parliament and the government being the key players. Thus, the question to what extent the independence of the fiscal councils will also be ensured in the long run, remains unanswered for the moment. In some countries the independence is not institutionally secured, for instance, by explicitly prohibiting the appointment of active (or recently active) politicians for the fiscal council...|$|E

40|$|Under {{the impact}} of the global {{economic}} crisis, the contemporary budget systems have been subject to extensive reforms. There is a growing number of scholars advocating the establishment of fully <b>independent</b> <b>fiscal</b> institutions which would be in charge of administering a sustainable fiscal policy. The bodies available in hitherto practice are <b>fiscal</b> <b>councils,</b> parliament committees on budgetary control or fiscal 'watchdogs'. The institutionalization of <b>fiscal</b> <b>councils</b> should provide for improving the quality of the public debate on fiscal policy and make the governments more fiscally accountable. The existing <b>fiscal</b> <b>councils</b> generally have an advisory role and they are expected to contribute to strengthening the role of national parliaments in scrutinizing the national budget. In fact, the establishment of <b>fiscal</b> <b>councils</b> ensues only after introducing the fiscal rules which serve as statutory limitations on the activities of the executive branch in the budget-related matters. The current economic crisis has substantially hindered the efficient application of these fiscal restrictions. Some states see the solution in establishing <b>independent</b> <b>fiscal</b> institutions which would control the compliance with these rules. As one {{of the participants in the}} budgetary process, <b>fiscal</b> <b>councils</b> are in a position to provide better information to the voters on the current state of affairs in public finances and (thus) increase the political costs of the government's fiscal unaccountability. In practice, there are several models for the organization of <b>fiscal</b> <b>councils</b> which primarily focus on ex ante or ex post review and assessment concerning whether the relevant institutions have observed the fiscal rules and accomplished the fiscal goals. Considering that their role is to eliminate the asymmetry of information in relations between the legislative and executive breach of government, <b>fiscal</b> <b>councils</b> should contribute to reinforcing the legitimacy of the budgetary process and strengthening the fiscal discipline. In the new European fiscal governance framework, these institutions become particularly important in the context of mending the consequences of the current economic crisis. In their hitherto activities, <b>fiscal</b> <b>councils</b> have encountered some difficulties: their competences have been challenged, their assessment and recommendations have been disregarded, and their financial resources (aimed at promoting their activities) have been significantly restricted. Relying on this analysis, we may conclude that the independence and responsibility of <b>fiscal</b> <b>councils</b> largely depends on the government's resolve to be fully accountable in administering a sustainable fiscal policy...|$|R

This requires disciplined consolidation efforts which are, however, supposed to come now {{at the wrong time}} with the economic recovery being fragile. The countries forming the G 20 need to make sure the long-term sustainability of public finances. Not least, this is indispensable in order to avoid a further spreading of the sovereign debt crisis. Against this background, we call for a global debt brake following the Swiss or German example which should be agreed upon in Cannes in early November 2011. The agreement on the debt brake should be binding – in contrast to previous expressions made at the G 20 -level to reduce government debt, as, for example, the Seoul Action Plan is lacking any binding character. Therefore, the debt brakes should be fixed in national constitutions and monitored by <b>independent</b> transnational <b>fiscal</b> <b>councils.</b> The <b>fiscal</b> <b>councils</b> could be located at the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and should conduct a regular evaluation of national budget plans {{in order to ensure that}} they meet the requirements stipulated by the debt brake. Through this global monitoring process, an early warning system could be developed with the aim to avoid sovereign debt crises and the resulting contagion risks among highly indebted countries in the future. In an economic and political environment which is characterized by large uncertainties concerning economic prospects and the fear of a potential spreading of the sovereign debt crisis, a global debt brake in combination with an independent transnational supervisory council would send a credible signal that a reduction of sovereign debt to sustainable levels is not further delayed into the future. Moreover, a well-designed debt brake ensures that the general government budget is balanced over the business cycle. Consequently, it is a more efficient instrument than the former Stability and Growth Pact for the Eurozone which in fact stipulated a ceiling for the budget deficit, but whose requirements regarding budget surpluses in good times were insufficient. This asymmetry is eliminated by those debt brakes which are in force in Switzerland and Germany. The new fiscal policy framework thus leaves enough room for discretionary fiscal policy and the workings of automatic stabilizers in an economic downturn. debt brake, <b>fiscal</b> <b>council,</b> G 20...|$|R
