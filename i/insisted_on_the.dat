5|$|Beginning in {{the late}} 1940s, Black wrote {{decisions}} relating to the establishment clause, where he <b>insisted</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> strict {{separation of church and}} state. The most notable of these was Engel v. Vitale (1962), which declared state-sanctioned prayer in public schools unconstitutional. This provoked considerable opposition, especially in conservative circles. Efforts to restore school prayer by constitutional amendment failed.|$|E
5|$|A new viceroy, Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros, {{arrived in}} July to replace Liniers, and the independentist {{group did not}} agree on how to react. Castelli {{proposed}} a resumption of Álzaga's idea of creating a governing Junta, but not headed by the Spanish. Belgrano <b>insisted</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> plan to appoint Charlotte as regent of a constitutional monarchy, and Rodriguez Peña proposed a military coup, with or without Liniers at the head. They finally accepted the perspective of Cornelio Saavedra, and delayed taking action until a better opportunity.|$|E
5|$|After the war, the {{military}} service of Hawaiians, including James Wood Bush and many others, was largely forgotten, disappearing from the collective {{memories of the}} American Civil War {{and the history of}} Hawaii. However, in recent years, Hawaiian residents, historians, and descendants of Hawaiian combatants in the conflict have <b>insisted</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> need to remember the legacy of the Hawaiians who fought. Renewed interest in the stories of these individuals and this particular period of Hawaiian-American history have inspired efforts to preserve the memories of the Hawaiians who served in the war.|$|E

5|$|Hindenburg reluctantly {{agreed to}} appoint Hitler as {{chancellor}} after two further parliamentary elections—in July and November 1932—had not {{resulted in the}} formation of a majority government. Hitler headed a short-lived coalition government formed by the NSDAP and Hugenberg's party, the German National People's Party (DNVP). On 30 January 1933, the new cabinet was sworn in during a brief ceremony in Hindenburg's office. The NSDAP gained three posts: Hitler was named chancellor, Wilhelm Frick Minister of the Interior, and Hermann Göring Minister of the Interior for Prussia. Hitler had <b>insisted</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ministerial positions as a way to gain control over the police in much of Germany.|$|E
5|$|In 1974, DARPA {{secretly}} requested {{answers from}} five aircraft manufacturers regarding two considerations. The first {{was about the}} signature thresholds at which an aircraft is virtually undetectable. The second point was whether these companies {{had the capacity to}} design and manufacture such an aircraft. Fairchild and Grumman declined to participate, while General Dynamics <b>insisted</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> use of electronic countermeasures. As a result, General Dynamics left the discussion. The remaining two companies, McDonnell Douglas and Northrop, were each awarded $100,000 for further research.|$|E

He also said that Jackson did not have insomnia and never asked him for narcotics. Treacy stated Jackson was in good physical health; he said Jackson always <b>insisted</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> presence of an anesthetist when Propofol was administered.|$|E

5|$|In early January 1915, {{it became}} known that British ships were {{conducting}} reconnaissance in the Dogger Bank area. Ingenohl was initially reluctant to destroy these forces, because the I Scouting Group was temporarily weakened while Von der Tann was in drydock for periodic maintenance. However, Konteradmiral Richard Eckermann, the Chief of Staff of the High Seas Fleet, <b>insisted</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> operation, and so Ingenohl relented and ordered Hipper to take his battlecruisers to the Dogger Bank.|$|E
5|$|The meeting {{attracted}} {{a large crowd}} of approximately six hundred participants. The bishop sent a delegation led by his vicar general, Johannes Fabri. Zwingli summarised his position in the Schlussreden (Concluding Statements or the Sixty-seven Articles). Fabri, who had not envisaged an academic disputation in the manner Zwingli had prepared for, was forbidden to discuss high theology before laymen, and simply <b>insisted</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> necessity of the ecclesiastical authority. The decision of the council was that Zwingli {{would be allowed to}} continue his preaching and that all other preachers should teach only in accordance with Scripture.|$|E

5|$|Baker, de Francisci, and Moore met in Washington on December 15. At that time, Baker, who {{hoped to}} start Peace dollar {{production}} in 1921, outlined the tight schedule {{for this to}} be accomplished, and requested certain design changes. Among these was the inclusion of the broken sword from the sculptor's alternate reverse design, to be placed under the eagle, on the mountaintop on which it stands, in addition to the olive branch. Baker approved the designs, subject to these changes. The revised designs were presented to President Harding on December 19. Harding <b>insisted</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> removal of a small feature of Liberty's face, which seemed to him to suggest a dimple, something he did not consider suggestive of peace, and the sculptor then did so.|$|E
5|$|During his lifetime, Morris {{produced}} {{items in}} a range of crafts, mainly those to do with furnishing, including over 600 designs for wall-paper, textiles, and embroideries, over 150 for stained glass windows, three typefaces, and around 650 borders and ornamentations for the Kelmscott Press. He emphasised the idea that the design and production of an item should not be divorced from one another, and that where possible those creating items should be designer-craftsmen, thereby both designing and manufacturing their goods. In the field of textile design, Morris revived a number of dead techniques, and <b>insisted</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> use of good quality raw materials, almost all natural dyes, and hand processing. He also observed the natural world first hand to gain a basis for his designs, and insisted on learning the techniques of production prior to producing a design.|$|E
5|$|For {{four to five}} years, Baba {{lived under}} a neem tree and often wandered for long periods in the jungle around Shirdi. His manner {{was said to be}} {{withdrawn}} and uncommunicative as he undertook long periods of meditation. He was eventually persuaded to take up residence in an old and dilapidated mosque and lived a solitary life there, surviving by begging for alms, and receiving itinerant Hindu or Muslim visitors. In the mosque he maintained a sacred fire which is referred to as a dhuni, from which he gave sacred ash ('Udi') to his guests before they left. The ash was believed to have healing and apotropaic powers. He performed the function of a local hakim and treated the sick by application of ashes. Sai Baba also delivered spiritual teachings to his visitors, recommending the reading of the Ramayan and Bhagavat Gita for Hindus and Qur'an for Muslims. He <b>insisted</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> indispensability of the unbroken remembrance of God's name (dhikr, and often expressed himself in a cryptic manner with the use of parables, symbols and allegories.|$|E

5|$|Fryderyk's father, Nicolas Chopin, was a Frenchman from Lorraine who had {{emigrated to}} Poland in 1787 {{at the age}} of sixteen. Nicolas tutored {{children}} of the Polish aristocracy, and in 1806 married Justyna Krzyżanowska, a poor relative of the Skarbeks, one of the families for whom he worked. Fryderyk was baptized on Easter Sunday, 23 April 1810, in the same church where his parents had married, in Brochów. His eighteen-year-old godfather, for whom he was named, was Fryderyk Skarbek, a pupil of Nicolas Chopin. Fryderyk was the couple's second child and only son; he had an elder sister, Ludwika (1807–55), and two younger sisters, Izabela (1811–81) and Emilia (1812–27). Nicolas was devoted to his adopted homeland, and <b>insisted</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> use of the Polish language in the household.|$|E
5|$|In 1282, {{war with}} Wales broke out again; {{this time it}} would not be simply a punitive campaign, but a {{full-scale}} war of conquest. Initially, the king wanted to fight the war with paid forces, but the nobility <b>insisted</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> use of the feudal summons. To men like Hereford, this was preferable, because as part of a feudal army the participants would have both a stake in the war and a justifiable claim on conquered land. In the end, although the earls won, none of them were paid for the war effort. Hereford jealously guarded his authority as hereditary Constable of England, and protested vigorously when the Gilbert de Clare, Earl of Gloucester was appointed commander of the forces in South Wales. In the post war settlement, however, neither Hereford nor Gloucester received any significant rewards of land, the way several other magnates did. Hereford fought again in Wales, in the suppression of the rebellion of 129495, when he again had to pacify the territory of Brecon before joining the king in the north.|$|E
5|$|In 1873 Reitz {{was asked}} to {{represent}} the district of Beaufort West in the Cape Parliament. The day he took his seat, 30 May, his father, who was the representative for Swellendam, announced his retirement from the Assembly. As so many of Reitz's activities up to that point, his parliamentary career was short-lived. Only two months later, President Johannes Brand of the Orange Free State offered Reitz the position of chairman of the newly formed Appellate Court of the Orange Free State, {{despite the fact that}} Reitz was not fully qualified (inter alia too young). Reitz refused the offer for this reason, but when another candidate also refused, Brand <b>insisted</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> nomination of Reitz, and convinced the Volksraad to appoint him.|$|E

5|$|In June 1988 the {{producer}} Tim Taylor invited Aston {{to work on}} a new four-episode television series for Channel 4 called Time Signs, broadcast in June and July 1991. The series focused on the historical development of the area about to be flooded by the Roadford Reservoir in Devon, making heavy use of archaeological data. Aston brought archaeologist Phil Harding into the project in order to explain techniques of experimental archaeology to the audience. Meanwhile, in August 1989, Aston was promoted to the position of Reader in Landscape Archaeology at Bristol University. He also continued to write on the subject, authoring the book Monasteries (1993); he had initially planned to title the volume Monasteries in the Landscape but his publisher, Batsford, had <b>insisted</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> shorter title.|$|E

5|$|Monastic reform {{inspired}} {{change in}} the secular Church. The ideals that it was based upon {{were brought to the}} papacy by Pope Leo IX (pope 1049–1054), and provided the ideology of the clerical independence that led to the Investiture Controversy in the late 11th century. This involved Pope Gregory VII (pope 1073–85) and Emperor Henry IV, who initially clashed over episcopal appointments, a dispute that turned into a battle over the ideas of investiture, clerical marriage, and simony. The emperor saw the protection of the Church as one of his responsibilities as well as wanting to preserve the right to appoint his own choices as bishops within his lands, but the papacy <b>insisted</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Church's independence from secular lords. These issues remained unresolved after the compromise of 1122 known as the Concordat of Worms. The dispute represents a significant stage {{in the creation of a}} papal monarchy separate from and equal to lay authorities. It also had the permanent consequence of empowering German princes at the expense of the German emperors.|$|E
