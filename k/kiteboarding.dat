40|$|AbstractPurpose of this investgation was the {{development}} of a calculation model for designing a <b>kiteboard.</b> The calculation model allows a prediction, if a <b>kiteboard</b> design withstands an introduced loading, or if not. Using the calculation results, weight can be reduced and reinforcements can be defined, if needed. Important characteristics of the <b>kiteboard</b> can be fixed before manufacturing the board. The main characteristics of a <b>kiteboard</b> are fixed because of the geometry, the buoyancy and the stiffness of the board. Therefore first part of the work was, to investigate the existing values of the geometry of the most commonly used <b>kiteboards</b> and the implemented materials. Loads, boundary conditions, and environmental conditions were listed and resulting requirements were concluded. Basically <b>kiteboards</b> had to be classified in directional- and bidirectional <b>kiteboards.</b> In {{the second part of the}} work a structural model (finite element model, FEM) for one bidirectional <b>kiteboard</b> was generated exemplarily. The main characteristics strength, stiffness (flex) and static buoyancy were calculated in accordance of geometry (main values for section area) and used materials. The finite element model was validated by an analytical calculation. A parameter study has been performed by varying cover- and core-materials of a sandwich lay-up. For one determinant load case the used materials have been justified regarding the structural behaviour, i. e. reserve factors have been calculated for mostly loaded areas considering published material properties and introduced loads. A test configuration with a ‘load equivalent test load’ has been developed to measure the stiffness (flex) of a <b>kiteboard.</b> With the used calculation model the stiffness (flex), static buoyancy and failure behaviour for determined materials and loading can be predicted. Geometry and materials can be chosen to withstand the introduced loads...|$|R

50|$|Laird Hamilton, a {{prominent}} {{figure in the}} invention of big wave tow-in surfing, later discovered the foilboard's capability to harness swell energy {{with the use of}} a jet ski, pulling the rider into a wave. Mango Carafino, a big wave tow surfing athlete and water sport instructor from the Hawaiian Island of Maui, was one of the early developers of the hydrofoil board design for stand-up hydro foil boarding (kitesurfing) applications. The stand-up design allows the rider to glide with the moving wave. Hydrofoil <b>kiteboards</b> allow the rider to achieve the same result {{with the use of a}} kite. The hydrofoil eliminates the effects of choppy or rough conditions. Due to the hydrofoil's underwater characteristics, the rider can angle higher into the wind than on traditional <b>kiteboards</b> which ride on the surface of the water.|$|R

50|$|Starting in 1999, kitesurfing {{became a}} {{mainstream}} sport with {{the entry of}} key windsurfing manufacturers namely Naish and Neil Pryde. Single direction boards derived from windsurfing and surfing designs became the dominant form of <b>kiteboard.</b> From 2001 onwards, twin-tip bi-directional boards became more popular for most flat water riders, with directional boards still in use for surf conditions.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Kiteboard,</b> a small composite, wooden, or foam board. There are now {{several types}} of kiteboards: {{directional}} surf-style boards, wakeboard-style boards, hybrids which can go in either direction but are built to operate better in one of them, and skim-type boards. Some riders also use standard surfboards, or even long boards, although without foot straps much of the high-jump capability of a kite is lost. Twin tip boards are the easiest to learn on and {{are by far the}} most popular. The boards generally come with sandal-type footstraps that allow the rider to attach and detach from the board easily; this is required for doing board-off tricks and jumps. Bindings are used mainly by the wakestyle riders wishing to replicate wakeboarding tricks such as KGBs and other pop initiated tricks. <b>Kiteboards</b> come in shapes and sizes to suit the rider's skill level, riding style, wind and water conditions.|$|R
