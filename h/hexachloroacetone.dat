The chiral auxiliary (menthol) can also be recovered unchanged. The simple and efficient protocol significantly expands the scope of our asymmetric Appel process. The crucial step in the preparation involves stereospecific reduction of intermediate diastereomeric alkoxyphosphonium salts, which are obtained in the reaction of phosphane, <b>hexachloroacetone,</b> and menthol. Thereby, reaction with LiAlH 4  or NaBH 4  gives the corresponding phosphanes or phosphane boranes, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Infrared {{spectra of}} acetone adsorbed at beam {{temperature}} on α-Fe 2 O 3 show that acetone can chemisorb on Lewis-acid sites and gives, at least partially, enolate anions; these, by aldolic condensation with {{molecules from the}} gas phase, produce a chemisorbed form of mesityl oxide. At 523 K acetate ions are formed. Two different forms of trichloroacetate ions are formed on the surface at beam temperature by the adsorption of <b>hexachloroacetone</b> and trichloroacetic acid. This behaviour indicates the presence of pairs of acid-base sites {{on the surface of}} haematite, and also shows that its surface hydroxy groups have a lower degree of nucleophilic character with respect to those of other oxides such as aluminas, SnO 2 and alkaline-earth oxides...|$|E
40|$|Two {{approaches}} {{have been used}} to determine the spin state(s) of 1, 4 - dehydrobenzenes produced in the solution reaction of diethynyl olefins. The first method relies on the "spin correlation effect" which postulates a relationship between the spin state of a caged radical pair and the ratio of cage and escape reactions (C/E) which may occur in the pair. When the 2, 3 -di-n-propyl- 1, 4 -dehydrobenzene biradical (4) abstracts hydrogen from 1, 4 -cyclohexadiene, a radical pair is generated. If a mixture of 1, 4 -cyclohexadiene-d{sub 0 } and -d{sub 4 } is employed it is possible, by performing a VPC-MS analysis, to determine the ratio C/E leading from the radical pair to the reduced product, o-dipropylbenzene 10. Applying this method to the reaction of Z- 4, 5 -diethynyl- 4 -octene (3), C/E was found to be 0. 6, independent of the concentration of 1, 4 -cyclohexadiene (between 0. 1 and 10 M) in the chlorobenzene reaction solution. This result suggests the presence of the singlet state of 4 in the reaction of 3. Independent support for this analysis came from the reaction of 3, 4 -dimethyl- 1, 5 -diyn- 3 -ene (11) in <b>hexachloroacetone</b> solvent in an NMR probe. The major product, 1, 4 -dichloro- 2, 3 -dimethylbenzene (12), obtained by chlorine abstraction from the solvent, showed CIDNP polarization (emission) in the aromatic protons. The interpretation of this result is straightforward and indicates solvent trapping of the singlet state of the intermediate 2, 3 -dimethyl- 1, 4 ~dehydrobenzene. Both of these experiments indicate that only the singlet state of 1, 4 -dehydrobenzenes is generated upon thermal reaction of diethynyl olefins. The failure to observe evidence for the triplet state of the 1, 4 -dehydrobenzenes under the reaction conditions requires that, if the triplet is the ground electronic state, the rate of intersystem crossing from the singlet must be < 10 {sup 9 } sec {sup - 1 }...|$|E
40|$|The {{technique}} of variable-angle, electron energy-loss spectroscopy {{has been used}} to study the electronic spectroscopy of the diketene molecule. The experiment was performed using incident electron beam energies of 25 eV and 50 eV, and at scattering angles between 10 ° and 90 °. The energy-loss region from 2 eV to 11 eV was examined. One spin-forbidden transition has been observed at 4. 36 eV and three others that are spin-allowed have been located at 5. 89 eV, 6. 88 eV and 7. 84 eV. Based on the intensity variation of these transitions with impact energy and scattering angle, and through analogy with simpler molecules, the first three transitions are tentatively assigned to an n → π* transition, a π - σ* (3 s) Rydberg transition and a π → π* transition. Thermal decomposition of chlorodifluoromethane, chloroform, dichloromethane and chloromethane under flash-vacuum pyrolysis conditions (900 - 1100 °C) was investigated by the {{technique of}} electron energy-loss spectroscopy, using the impact energy of 50 eV and a scattering angle of 10 °. The pyrolytic reaction follows a hydrogen-chloride α-elimination pathway. The difluoromethylene radical was produced from chlorodifluoromethane pyrolysis at 900 °C and identified by its X^ 1 A_ 1 → A^ 1 B_ 1 band at 5. 04 eV. Finally, a number of exploratory studies have been performed. The thermal decomposition of diketene was studied under flash vacuum pressures (1 - 10 mTorr) and temperatures ranging from 500 °C to 1000 °C. The complete decomposition of the diketene molecule into two ketene molecules was achieved at 900 °C. The pyrolysis of trifluoromethyl iodide molecule at 1000 °C produced an electron energy-loss spectrum with several iodine-atom, sharp peaks and only a small shoulder at 8. 37 eV as a possible trifluoromethyl radical feature. The electron energy-loss spectrum of trichlorobromomethane at 900 °C mainly showed features from bromine atom, chlorine molecule and tetrachloroethylene. <b>Hexachloroacetone</b> decomposed partially at 900 °C, but showed well-defined features from chlorine, carbon monoxide and tetrachloroethylene molecules. Bromodichloromethane molecule was investigated at 1000 °C and produced a congested, electron energy-loss spectrum with bromine-atom, hydrogen-bromide, hydrogen-chloride and tetrachloroethylene features. ...|$|E
