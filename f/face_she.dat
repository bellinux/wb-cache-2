25|$|As in {{the case}} of all Soul {{character}}s, Taki's character creation started with her weapon.

A cloth mask returns with Taki's primary costume in Soulcalibur, which is the only game in which her breasts are partially exposed. Taki has a demon-themed menpo iron mask with her blue-colored main costume in Soulcalibur III and a similar red costume is featured in Legends. Other demonic motifs have appeared on her armor since Soulcalibur.|$|E
