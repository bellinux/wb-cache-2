In this study, the tack coat design of the interface between an existing porous asphalt and a newly laid open graded course was developed.

50|$|Polymer mats are {{particularly}} effective {{due to their}} suppleness as they allow for more contact with serrations on shoes and wheels and can accommodate more particles while still remaining effective. An electrostatic potential adds {{to the effectiveness of}} this type of contamination control as it enables particles to be retained until the flooring is cleaned. This method of attracting and retaining particles is more effective than mats with an active adhesive coating which needs to be peeled and is often not as supple. As long as the tack level of the mat is greater than the donor's (such as a foot or a wheel), the contamination touching the surface will be removed. Very <b>high</b> <b>tack</b> surfaces pose a contamination threat because they are prone to pulling off overshoe protection. Polymeric flooring is produced to ensure a higher level of tackiness than the surfaces it comes into contact with, without causing discomfort and potentially damaging 'stickiness'.|$|E
50|$|Waterless {{printing}} is an offset {{lithographic printing}} process that eliminates {{the water or}} dampening system used in conventional printing. It uses silicone rubber coated printing plates and specially formulated inks, and typically a temperature-control system is integrated into waterless presses. Waterless offset presses do not use dampening solution to keep the plate's nonimage areas free of ink. These presses function because the plate's nonimage areas consist of a layer of silicon that repels ink. A waterless press resembles a conventional offset press, except the dampening system might be missing. A more common design, however, includes a dampening system to allow the press to function conventionally when needed. Direct imaging (digital) offset presses are waterless, with no dampening system.Waterless offset inks have a <b>higher</b> <b>tack</b> and viscosity (thickness) and are generally stiffer than conventional offset inks. The temperature of the inks must be strictly controlled to maintain the correct viscosity because the plate surface is designed to repel inks of a specific viscosity. This temperature distinction is achieved by running chilled water through tubing in the hollow cores {{of two or more}} vibrating rollers in the ink train on the printing press.|$|R

Although {{the influence of}} the addition of microcrystalline and Fischer-Tropsch waxes on the properties of ethylene-co-vinyl acetate (EVA) hot melts has been studied, the addition of polypropylene wax has not been considered yet. In this study, different polypropylene waxes (polypropylene wax – PP, – maleic anhydride grafted polypropylene wax – PPMA – copolymer of polypropylene and 10. 9 [*]wt. % polyethylene wax – PP-E) were added to EVA hot melts and they were characterized by Brookfield viscosity, softening point measurement, differential scanning calorimetry, thermal gravimetric analysis, dynamic mechanical thermal analysis, plate–plate rheology, tack, and single-lap shear adhesion. The viscosities of EVA hot melts containing polypropylene waxes were relatively high, the highest viscosity corresponded to the formulation containing PP-E wax which also showed pseudoplasticity. The change in viscoelastic properties (i. e., from dominantly viscous to dominantly elastic) was produced at lower temperature in EVA hot melt containing PP-E wax, this adhesive exhibited the <b>highest</b> <b>tack.</b> On the other hand, the addition of acrylic PPMA wax increased the adhesion of EVA hot melt but lower tack was obtained.

40|$|Copolymerizing an {{acrylic acid}} {{comonomer}} is often beneficial for the adhesive properties of waterborne pressure-sensitive adhesives (PSAs). Here, we demonstrate {{a new strategy}} in which poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) is distributed as a percolating network within a PSA film formed from a polymer colloid. A diblock copolymer composed of PAA and poly(n-butyl acrylate) (PBA) blocks was synthesized using reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization and adsorbed onto soft acrylic latex particles prior to their film formation. The thin adsorbed shells on the particles create a percolating network that raises the elastic modulus, creep resistance and tensile strength of the final film. When the film formation occurs at pH 10, ionomeric crosslinking occurs, and <b>high</b> <b>tack</b> adhesion is obtained in combination with high creep resistance.

40|$|Pressure {{sensitive}} adhesive (PSA) {{materials have}} significant {{negative impact on}} paper recycling. PSA materials are hard to remove in recycling and deposit on equipment and are retained in the product, severely hampering operations. This research had as an objective to evaluate if some PSA properties could be predictors of the removal of PSA materials with pressure screens in paper recycling. Several PSA materials were pulped, characterized for particle size and then subjected to a single slot screening experiment. The PSA materials properties of glass transition temperature, contact angle, yield strain, yield stress, and modulus were determined. Statistical modeling determined that the particle size after pulping was not significantly related to any individual PSA property. Statistical modeling determined that particle passage in a pressurized screen was negatively related to both yield stress and particle dimensions. A hot melt adhesive PSA had a very different screenability than did acrylate based adhesives. The hot melt adhesive was found to fold upon itself into a more spherical shape and to also to contain more attached fibers, in agreement with a <b>higher</b> <b>tack</b> for this adhesive than acrylate adhesives. The passage of the PSA adhesives particles could be modeled with moderate accuracy using a simple extrusion model. The model had yield stress as a fitting parameter and the calculated yield stress from the model was {{in agreement with the}} yield stresses measured for the PSA materials.

We report for the first time, the use of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) to study a series of hydrophobic and hydrophilic polymeric systems in order to correlate water-structuring behavior with adhesion strength. Adhesive bonding of the more hydrophobic variants was higher than that of a commercial-based control and a more hydrophilic polymer system in both lap shear and tensile configurations. Water-binding data suggested that increasing the hydrophobicity of the maleic acid copolymer substituents led to decreased levels of freezing water. In comparison, increasing the hydrophilic nature of the polymer backbone gave higher levels of freezing water within the hydrated samples. The results of this study emphasize the importance of varying the levels of hydrophobic and hydrophilic components within denture adhesive formulations, alongside the types of water present within the adhesive systems.

40|$|Several {{thermoanalytical}} {{methods were}} used to assess the compatibility of EBA (copolymer of ethylene and n-butyl acrylate) hot melts containing tackifiers of different nature (pentaerythritol rosin ester, polyterpene resin, aliphatic hydrocarbon resin, aromatic hydrocarbon resin, and cycloaliphatic-aromatic hydrocarbon resin). The influence of the compatibility of EBA hot melts on their rheological, viscoelastic, and adhesion properties to polar (aluminum foil) and nonpolar (polypropylene film) substrates were analyzed. The viscosity and shear thinning at 160 °C of EBA hot melts varied significantly by changing the tackifier nature; however, at 180 °C all EBA hot melts showed similar viscosities and shear thinning was absent because of the rupture of physical interactions between their components. EBA copolymer showed broad tackifier compatibility, even though aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon resins were less compatible. Compatibility was assessed by softening point and cloud point measurement, and dynamical mechanical thermal analysis. The most compatible EBA hot melts were obtained with rosin ester, polyterpene and cycloaliphatic-aromatic hydrocarbon tackifiers and they showed the highest tack and adhesion. On the contrary, the less-compatible EBA hot melts were obtained with aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbon tackifiers, and they showed the lowest adhesion. EBA containing aliphatic hydrocarbon tackifier was exceptional because of even being incompatible, it showed <b>high</b> <b>tack.</b> Financial support by REPSOL (Móstoles, Madrid, Spain) is acknowledged...|$|E
40|$|Interest in {{polyethylene}} and polypropylene bonding {{has increased}} in the last years. However, adhesive joints with adherends which are of low surface energy and which are chemically inert present several difficulties. Generally, their high degree of chemical resistance to solvents and dissimilar solubility parameters limit the usefulness of solvent bonding as a viable assembly technique. One successful approach to adhesive bonding of these materials involves proper selection of surface pre-treatment prior to bonding. With the correct pre-treatment {{it is possible to}} glue these materials with one or more of several adhesives required by the applications involved. A second approach is the use of adhesives without surface pre-treatment, such as hot melts, <b>high</b> <b>tack</b> pressure-sensitive adhesives, solvent-based specialty adhesives and, more recently, structural acrylic adhesives as such 3 M DP- 8005 ® and Loctite 3030 ®.

40|$|This degree project {{illustrates}} newsprint and waterless offset. A new news {{press was}} introduced at Drupa- 00, Cortina from KBA, {{which is the}} first news press dedicated the waterless technique. With actual statistics from the company in question an investigation was made whether their production fits this press. It came out in the investigation that the production of the company, from statistics, fits this press very good. A table was made where different timeschedules were accounted for the new press, with semi- and full automatic plate changing for present and to be added papers. The waterless technology is compared to conventional offset with the difference that the plate is based on a sort of laminatetechnology. Like conventional plates this plate has a base made of aluminium. Lightsensitive photopolymer isunited as a layer or coat on top of the aluminium and a 2 µm thin oleophobic siliconlayer is applied on top of the photopolymer. Considering the print, the waterless method has a higher qualitygrade than conventional offset. No water is emulsifiedin the ink, and therefore the printed dot gets a higher density. The loss of dampening solution and <b>higher</b> <b>tack</b> of the ink gives sharper dots. This makes the colourspace bigger why a greater range of colours can be printed. The loss of dampening solution gives a more stable dotgain, which contributes to that a higher screen can be used. The disadvantage is that the plate can't do as many rotations as the conventional plate. A waterless plate makes around 100 000 - 500 000 rotations before it needs to be removed owing to type- and manufacturer of the plate. The plate is also slightly more sensitive and expensive than conventional plates, around 1, 4 - 1, 7 × aluminium printing plates. A waterless system can be installed in a conventional printing press by degrees and when large editions are being printed a cooler needs to be installed in the oscillationrollers of the press, since an increase in temperature can make the oleophobic parts of the plate oleophilic. The Cortina is however equipped with a temperature controlsystem at the beginning. To avoid picking, caused by the tacky ink, a blanket with a high “quick release” should be used...|$|R
40|$|This project {{demonstrates}} a MEMS-based handheld device that stores and dispenses scented materials, allowing users to select and release {{a variety of}} combinations of stored scents. Small volume, low power consumption and low cost {{are the most important}} device constrains for consumer application, leading to a disposable burst pump design. The initial design consists of a 2 x 10 array of cylindrical sealed wells, each measuring 1 mm in diameter and 500 µm deep. The wells are designed to store a quantized amount of. 2 µL scent oil and alcohol. Wells are electrically addressable so that any combination of scents can be dispensed simultaneously. The dispense mechanism is rupturing the seal of the well by heat. Further design requirements are: a) The wells must sustain pressure of at least 5 psi for at least a month; b) The walls of the wells must be hydrophilic so scents are not absorbed by them; and c) The release time of quantized scents must be within 0. 5 s {{in order for them to}} mix in air.

The objective of this research study is to develop an optimized 4. 75 -mm NMAS Superpave mixture in Kansas. In addition, the study evaluated the residual tack coat application rate for the 4. 75 -mm NMAS mix overlay. Two, hot-in-place recycling (HIPR) projects in Kansas, on US- 160 and K- 25, were overlaid with a 15 - to 19 -mm thick layer of 4. 75 -mm NMAS Superpave mixture in 2007. The field tack coat application rate was measured during construction. Cores were collected from each test section for Hamburg wheel tracking device (HWTD) and laboratory bond tests performed after construction and after one year in service. Test results showed no significant effect of the tack coat application rate on the rutting performance of rehabilitated pavements. The number of wheel passes to rutting failure observed during the HWTD test was dependent on the aggregate source as well as on in-place density of the cores. Laboratory pull-off tests showed that most cores were fully bonded at the interface of the 4. 75 -mm NMAS overlay and the HIPR layer, regardless of the tack application rate. The failure mode during pull-off tests at the HMA interface was highly dependent on the aggregate source and mix design of the existing layer material. This study also confirmed that overlay construction with a <b>high</b> <b>tack</b> coat application rate may result in bond failure at the HMA interface. Twelve different 4. 75 -mm NMAS mix designs were developed using materials from the aforementioned but two binder grades and three different percentages of natural (river) sand.

Results show that rutting and moisture damage potential in the laboratory depend on aggregate type irrespective of binder grade. Anti-stripping agent affects moisture sensitivity test results.

This method was used to study the effect of pre-damp on ink tack measurements and on water interference mottle tendency in laboratory scale. The initial trials were focused on ink tack measurements without pre-damp in order to achieve knowledge about this type of measurement. The effect of different parameters used within the ink tack measurements was also investigated. The ink tack measurements were rather sensitive to the method of ink distribution procedure, the positioning of the tack disc and the fastening of the paperboard sample. Additionally, the printing speed, the printing pressure and the hold time affected the measurements. However, measurements in the cross direction and the machine direction of the paperboard were compared, and did not show a significant difference. Different levels of tackiness of the ink were also tested. For instance, an ink that previously had caused delamination failure in industrial offset printing showed a relatively <b>high</b> ink <b>tack.</b> Four different paperboard qualities were also compared. The small differences in ink tack between the samples were explained by the differences in coating characteristic resulting in different ink absorption. The same paperboard qualities were also used in an inter-comparison between different laboratories measuring ink tack (Iggesund, STFI and Imerys). The same machine settings and the same type of ink was used in the investigation. Although the four qualities always were ranged in the same order, both the level and the shape of the ink tack curve differed in between the three laboratories. One explanation given was that different tack discs were used in the investigation. The method developed for pre-damp application was based on condensation of a water film on a cooled down metal disc. The effect of the temperature on the metal disc surface (inside a fridge), the dwell time inside a desiccator and the time for condensation in a conditioned room on the amount of water developed on the disc surface was investigated. The amount of water developed and transferred could be related to the resulting print density or transferred ink amount. A lower print density or transferred ink amount implied a larger amount of water applied to the sample. The experiments showed that this procedure is rather uncertain and that the tests are difficult to reproduce. However, a lower temperature of the damp disc inside the fridge in general resulted in a larger amount of water developed onto the disc surface. The pre-damp application was used prior to printing and ink tack measurements. The maximum and the shape of the ink tack curve only changed slightly when using pre-damp in comparison to the measurements without pre- damp. In general, the ink tack curve in the later phase was lowered when using pre-damp, indicating a faster ink setting and drying. This may be attributed to that the viscosity of the ink decreases when blended with water. Another explanation given was that penetration of water into the substrate leads to swelling and consequently a rougher surface and a lower ink tack. A lower amount of ink transferred in some cases may be another explanation. The pre-damp was also applied prior to printing in Prüfbau in mottle evaluations, creating water interference mottle. Two paperboard samples with different levels of performance in industrial printing were compared. The sample with less good performance also appeared worse in this investigation with respect to mottle, both with and without pre-damp before printing. This sample had lower coat weight according to burn out pictures and also a lower contact angle in comparison to the better sample. A correlation was also achieved between the water interference mottle tendency obtained in laboratory printing and in a full scale printing trial, respectively. Only three qualities were included in this investigation. Further experiments must be performed to really see the correlation between these two methods. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R
40|$|Linting is {{considered}} to be a major print quality problem. It is defined as the removal of fibres and fines from the surface of uncoated paper during offset printing. The accumulation of lint on the blanket will eventually reduce the print quality and affect the pressroom efficiency. Although linting has been studied for many years, no measurement methods for characterizing lint have been standardized. Several major factors that contribute to the complexity in lint measurements are the very small amount of lint that is being removed from the paper surface, the interactions between different variables affecting linting and the lack of understanding on the dynamics of linting during printing. This work is focused on four main parts, which explore the dynamic measurement of linting. In the first part, Weibull statistics have been used to characterize the distribution of adhesion strength of lint particles to paper. Static tests were conducted to measure lint dynamics by repeatedly stopping the press during a run, washing and collecting multiple lint samples from different areas of the blanket. The effect of a change in the size distribution of lint particles with increasing number of copies was examined, in order to estimate relative removal from the blanket as a function of lint particle size. From the analysis, the removal rate of lint particles from the paper decreased with the increasing size of particles. Differences in the bond strength of the lint particle size to the paper substrate were suggested to be responsible for the change. The removal rate of particles from the printing blanket was found to be independent of particle size, indicating that both the adhesion force between the particles and blanket and the removal force due to ink tack are proportional to the particle area. The second part of this work presented the initial development of a dynamic lint measurement technique using a high speed video camera, together with image analysis, to measure the accumulation of lint on the blanket. The area distribution of lint measured from the lint camera was compared to the area distribution measured by washing the blanket. The percentage area covered by lint in dynamic images (when the press was running) was larger than in either the static (when the press was halted) images or the filtered samples. The lint particle size distribution from the static images shows similarities to the distribution of the lint removed from the blanket in filtered samples. The differences in the lint area distribution for the dynamic images were due to the blurring of images and agglomeration of particles. These results showed that the system needs to be improved before it could be used for routine quality control tests. The third part developed the lint camera system further so that it can measure lint dynamically and reproducibly with different colour printing inks. The results of the lint camera system were also validated against other measurements of lint. The correlation between the lint camera and the blanket tape pull method was very good, while the lint measured from the washed and filtered sample gave higher percentage area distribution at small particle sizes than the area distribution measured from the lint camera. The differences in the lint area distribution from the filtered sample at small particle sizes, is likely due to disaggregation of the agglomerated lint particles during the washing and filtering, and thus large particles are being measured as more smaller size particles. When the overall lint deposited and removed from the printing blanket are in equilibrium, there was approximately 5 % to 6. 5 % variation around the measured average number of lint particles, from image to image. This was due to random deposit and removal of lint particles. The final part of the work discussed the effects of the paper and of the printing press variables of printing tone and ink tack on the two rates of adhesion failure in linting, by using the lint camera system developed in part three and also by stopping the press repeatedly to wash the lint samples off the blanket. The first failure (k₁) is for the removal of lint particles from the paper surface to the blanket, while the second failure (k₂) is for the separation of the lint particles from the blanket. The key finding of this study was that these two rates of adhesion failure are generally correlated due to the combination forces of the free ink film, porous film flow in the printing nip and the ink film splitting force. The results showed that improved newsprint produced higher lint than standard newsprint for both small and large particles. The lowest tone of 20 % had the highest values of k₁ and k₂. The previous contradictory results from the literature of the maximum lint with tone are due to the different number of copies being printed when the measurements were conducted. Both k₁ and k₂ also increased with <b>higher</b> ink <b>tack</b> for small and larger particles. By conducting these studies, the dynamics of linting in offset printing can be better understood. A quality control system has been developed to measure lint migration from the paper or the printing blanket. The system also provides better correlation between paper measurements and the linting performance of paper products. Knowledge of the dynamics of linting will help paper mills and printers to assess whether the accumulation of lint on the blanket is caused by the paper or by the printing conditions...|$|R
