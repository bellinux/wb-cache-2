40|$|A double-label deoxyglucose {{technique}} {{was used to}} study orientation columns throughout visual cortex in awake behaving macaques. Four macaques were trained to fixate while contrastreversing, stationary gratings or one-dimensional noise of a single orientation or an orthogonal orientation were presented, during uptake of [14 C]deoxyglucose ([14 C]DG) or [3 H]DG, respectively. The two orthogonal stimulus orientations produced DG-labeled columns that were maximally separated in the two isotope maps (inter-digitated) in four areas: V 1, V 2, V 3 and VP. The topographic change from interdigitated to overlapping columns occurred abruptly rather than gradually, at corresponding cortical area borders (e. g. VP and V 4 v, respectively). In addition, the data suggest that orientation column topography systematically changes with retinotopic eccentricity. In V 1, the orientation columns systematically avoided the cytochrome oxidase blobs in the parafoveal representation, but converged closer to the blobs in the foveal representation. A control experiment indicated that this was unlikely to reflect eccentricity-dependent differences in cortical spatial frequency sensitivity. A similar eccentricity-dependent change in the topography of orientation columns occurred in V 2. In parafoveal but not foveal visual field representations of V 2, the orientation columns were centered on the thick cytochrome oxidase stripes, extended into the adjacent <b>interstripe</b> <b>region,</b> but were virtually absent in the thin stripes. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 1997 In {{visual area}} V 2, {{cytochrome}} oxidase (CO) histochemistry reveals {{a pattern of}} alternating densely labeled thick and thin stripes separated by lightly labeled <b>interstripe</b> <b>regions.</b> These stripe-like compartments have been related to three separate cortico-cortical pathways, which may be involved with different aspects of visual processing. In the first experiment, we examined whether the tangential distribution of cells projecting to the superior colliculus bear {{a relationship with the}} CO stripes in V 2. The cortico-tectal pathway is thought to be functionally specific, extending from magnocellular layers of the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). From previous evidence that V 2 thick stripes are closely associated with the magnocellular LGN layers, we predicted that V 2 neurons projecting to the superior colliculus would preferentially reside in thick stripe regions. Our results bore out this prediction. These data support the idea that the stripe-like compartments in V 2 represent separate functional pathways, and extend the notion of segregated cortico-cortical pathways to cortico-subcortical projections. In the second experiment, we compared the distribution of interhemispheric connections in V 2 with the pattern of CO stripes. We found that V 2 callosal connections tend to accumulate within a continuous band along the V 1 /V 2 border from which callosal cells cluster within finger-like extensions within thin and thick stripe regions in V 2 up to 7 - 8 mm from the V 1 border. Our findings extend the notion of segregated cortico-cortical pathways to interhemispheric connections. In addition, different from the pattern of intracortical connections, our results suggest that few cells within <b>interstripe</b> <b>regions</b> in V 2 send connections to V 2 or other extrastriate areas in the contralateral hemisphere. In the third experiment we examined the pattern of callosal linkages in V 2. Based on previous data on the visual field map in V 2, callosal connections could link representations of the visual field located away from the vertical meridian. We examined whether the pattern of V 2 callosal linkages supports this idea. The results demonstrate that callosal connections preferentially link corresponding regions between areas V 2. These data support the hypothesis that V 2 callosal connections mediate interactions between visual field representations located away from the vertical meridian...|$|R
40|$|In {{visual area}} V 2 of monkeys, {{cytochrome}} oxidase (CO) histochemistry reveals {{a system of}} stripe-like subregions where densely labeled thick and thin stripes and pale interstripes can be recognized. Several lines of evidence suggest that CO stripe-like subregions are associated with functional streams in the visual cortex. In the present study, the distribution of retrogradely labeled callosal cells in V 2 and the pattern of CO staining were correlated using tangential sections through the flattened cortex. Spectral and coherency analyses of the callosal and CO patterns were performed to assess quantitatively the degree of spatial correlation between these two patterns. The results showed that labeled callosal cells accumulated along the V 1 /V 2 border and in finger-like bands that protruded up to 7 - 8 mm into V 2. These callosal bands were in register with thick and thin CO stripes, with relatively few labeled callosal cells found in <b>interstripe</b> <b>regions.</b> This finding supports {{the notion that the}} distribution of callosal connections in the visual cortex is dictated not only by the topography of visual areas, but also by the arrangement of cortical functional streams. Further, these results extend to interhemispheric pathways the notion of functional specificity currently associated mainly with some visual intra-hemispheric pathways...|$|R
40|$|In {{addition}} to the major anatomical pathways from Vl into the temporal lobe, there are other smaller, “bypass ” routes that are poorly understood. To investigate the direct projection from Vl to V 4 (bypassing V 2) and from V 2 to TEO (bypassing V 4), we injected the fovea 1 and parafoveal representations of V 4 and TEO with different retrograde tracers in five hemispheres of four macaques and analyzed the distributions of labeled neurons in Vl and V 2 using flattened preparations of the cortex. In Vl, labeled neurons were seen after injections in V 4 but not TEO. The V 4 -projecting neurons were located in the fovea 1 representation of Vl, in both cytochrome oxidase (CO) -rich blobs and CO-poor interblob regions. In V 2, TEO-projecting neurons were intermingled with V 4 -projecting neurons, although the former were far sparser than the latter. Across the cases, 6 -l 9 % of the TEOprojecting neurons were double labeled, that is, also projected to area V 4. Both V 4 - and TEO-projecting neurons formed bands that ran orthogonal to the Vl IV 2 border, and both were located in CO-rich thin stripes and CO-poor <b>interstripe</b> <b>regions.</b> In some cases, a continuous band of V 4 projecting neurons was also found along the Vl /V 2 border in the fovea 1 representation of V 2. The {{results indicate that the}} pathways from Vl to V 4 and from V 2 to TEO involve anatomical subcompartments thought to be concerned with both color and form. These “bypass ” routes may allow coarse information about color and form to arrive rapidly in the temporal lobe. The bypass route from V 2 to TEO might explain the partial sparing of color and form vision that is seen after lesions of V 4. By analogy, given the bypass route from the fovea 1 representation of Vl to V 4, lesions of V 2 affecting the fovea 1 visual field would also be insufficient to block color and form vision.
