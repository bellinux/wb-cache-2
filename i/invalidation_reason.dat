As more smart electronic devices are getting connected to each other, the dependency on these devices are urging us to connect them with moving objects such as cars, buses, trucks etc. As such, safety and security issues related to automotive objects are becoming more relevant {{in the realm of}} internet connected devices and objects. In this thesis, we emphasize on certain factors that introduces security vulnerabilities in the implementation phase of Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). Input invalidation is one of them that we address in our work. We implement a security evaluation framework that allows us to improve security in automotive software by identifying and removing software security vulnerabilities that arise due to input <b>invalidation</b> <b>reasons</b> during SDLC. We propose to use this framework in the implementation and testing phase so that the critical deficiencies of software in security by design issues could be easily addressed and mitigated...|$|R
40|$|I first {{provide an}} {{analysis}} of Joel Feinberg’s anti-paternalism in terms of <b>invalidation</b> of <b>reasons.</b> <b>Invalidation</b> is the blocking of reasons from influencing the moral status of actions, {{in this case the}} blocking of personal good reasons from supporting liberty-limiting actions. Invalidation is shown to be distinct from moral side constraints and lexical ordering of values and reasons. I then go on to argue that anti-paternalism as invalidation is morally unreasonable on at least four grounds, none of which presuppose that people can be mistaken about their own good: First, the doctrine entails that we should sometimes allow people to unintentionally severely harm or kill themselves though we could easily stop them. Second, it entails that we should sometimes allow perfectly informed and rational people to risk the lives of themselves and others, though they are in perfect agreement with us on what reasons we have to stop them for their own good. Third, the doctrine leaves unexplained why we may benevolently coerce less competent but substantially autonomous people, such as young teens, but not adults. Last, it entails that there are peculiar jumps in justifiability between very similar actions. I conclude that as liberals we should reject anti-paternalism and focus our efforts on explicating important liberal values, thereby showing why liberty reasons sometimes override strong personal good reasons, though never by making them invalid...|$|R
40|$|Joel Feinberg’s anti-paternalism can be {{interpreted}} as a doctrine of <b>invalidation</b> of <b>reasons,</b> implying that reasons which concern a person’s good are excluded, on moral grounds, from influencing the moral status of actions that limit her liberty. Invalidation of this kind is distinct from moral side constraints and from lexical ordering of values and <b>reasons.</b> Anti-paternalism as <b>invalidation,</b> though a relatively favourable interpretation, is morally unreasonable on at least four grounds, even if we accept people’s view of their own good at face value. First, it entails that we should sometimes allow people to severely harm or kill themselves though we could easily stop them and they don’t intend to harm themselves. Second, it entails that we should sometimes disregard reasons that concern a person’s good, even if the person herself is in perfect agreement on the strength and validity of the reasons, and is judging and acting perfectly voluntary. Third, it entails that there are peculiar jumps in justifiability between very similar actions where one is barely sufficiently voluntary and the other not quite sufficiently voluntary. Fourth, it indirectly entails a disregard for the liberty of those who all agree should sometimes be coerced in their own interest, but who nevertheless are partially autonomous, such as people in their lower teens. For all of these reasons, we liberals should reject anti-paternalism and focus our efforts on explicating important liberal values, thereby showing why liberty reasons sometimes override strong personal good reasons, though never by making them invalid...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} an attempt to constructively {{interpret}} and critically evaluate the liberal doctrine that we may not limit a person’s liberty for her own good, and to discuss its implications and alternatives in some concrete areas of public health policy. The thesis starts theoretical and goes ever more practical. The first paper is devoted to positive interpretation of anti-paternalism with special focus on the reason component – personal good. A novel generic definition of paternalism is proposed, intended to capture, in a generous fashion, the object of traditional liberal resistance to paternalism – the invocation of personal good reasons for limiting of or interfering with a person’s liberty. In the second paper, the normative aspect of this resistance is given a somewhat technical interpretation in terms of <b>invalidation</b> of <b>reasons</b> – the blocking of reasons from influencing the moral status of actions according to their strength. It is then argued that normative anti-paternalism so understood is unreasonable, on three grounds: 1) Since the doctrine only applies to sufficiently voluntary action, voluntariness determines validity of reasons, which is unwarranted and leads to wrong answers to moral questions. 2) Since voluntariness comes in degrees, a threshold must be set where personal good reasons are invalidated, leading to peculiar jumps in the justifiability of actions. 3) Anti-paternalism imposes an untenable and unhelpful distinction between the value of respecting choices that are sufficiently voluntary and choices that are not. The third paper adds to this critique the fourth argument that none of the action types typically proposed to specify the action component of paternalism is such that performing an action of that type out of benevolence is essentially morally problematic. The fourth paper ignores the critique {{in the second and third}} papers and proposes, in an anti-paternalistic spirit, a series of rules for the justification of option-restricting policies aimed at groups where some members consent to the policy and some do not. Such policies present the liberal with a dilemma where the value of not restricting people’s options without their consent conflicts with the value of allowing people to shape their lives according to their own wishes. The fifth paper applies the understanding of anti-paternalism developed in the earlier papers to product safety regulation, as an example of a public health policy area. The sixth paper explores in more detail a specific public health policy, namely that of mandatory alcohol interlocks in all cars, proposed by the former Swedish government and supported by the Swedish National Road Administration. The policy is evaluated for cost-effectiveness, for possible diffusion of individual responsibility, and for paternalistic treatment of drivers. The seventh paper argues for a liberal policy in the area of dissemination of information about uncertain threats to public health. The argument against paternalism is based on common sense consequentialist considerations, avoiding any appeal to the normative anti-paternalism rejected earlier in the thesis. QC 2010071...|$|R
40|$|There are {{multiple}} fora {{at which a}} defendant can initiate proceedings to invalidate a patent. The estoppel effects {{of the validity of}} the patent itself and of the arguments brought forth during the proceedings vary. Part I of this paper is an introduction to patent invalidation after grant. Part II and III talk about the various points at which a patent can be invalidated, including the estoppel implications at each point, before and after the passage of the America Invents Act. In Parts III and IV, two lines of reform are offered based on the propositions that any one defendant should be given only one chance to fully and fairly litigate the validity of a patent, and that one forum should handle the entire <b>invalidation</b> process for <b>reasons</b> of efficiency. A uniform invalidation system needs to weigh the interests of recognizing the true inventor and encouraging settlements at litigation against a concern for the efficiency and certainty in the patent system. The first approach in Part III aims at moving all invalidation proceedings to the court. In such a system, the USPTO would only serve to 2 ̆ 2 bookmark 2 ̆ 2 a patent application {{and there would be no}} presumption of validity going into litigation. The second approach in Part IV tries to bring in all adversarial action within the scope of proceedings at the USPTO, which leaves the court to find only claims of infringement (similar to the present model in Germany). The biggest cause for concern with such a system is whether it would withstand a Seventh Amendment challenge. Under my proposed system, prior user rights are presented as a way to circumvent the shortcomings of possibly erroneously spotting true inventors. In order to incentivize settlement during litigation, the paper proposes improving certainty for the defendant by giving the patent owner fewer opportunities to change claim language in a purposeful lengthy prosecution or after the patent issues...|$|R
