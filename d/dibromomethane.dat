5000|$|The Nysted reagent is a reagent used {{in organic}} {{synthesis}} for the methenylation of a carbonyl group. It {{was discovered in}} 1975 by Leonard N. Nysted in Chicago, Illinois. It was prepared by reacting <b>dibromomethane</b> and activated zinc in THF. [...] The process is known as Nysted olefination. There is no confirmed mechanism but a proposed mechanism {{can be seen to}} bottom right.A similar reagent is Tebbe's reagent. [...] In the Nysted olefination, the Nysted reagent reacts with TiCl4 to methylenate a carbonyl group. The biggest problem with these reagents are that the reactivity has not been well documented. It is believed that the TiCl4 acts as a mediator in the reaction. Nysted reagent can methylenate different carbonyl groups in the presence of different mediators. For example, in the presence of BF3•OEt2, the reagent will methylenate aldehydes. On the other hand, in the presence of TiCl4, TiCl3 or TiCl2 and BF3•OEt2, the reagent can methylenate ketones. Most commonly, it is used to methylenate ketones because of their general difficulty to methylenate due to crowding around the carbonyl group. Nysted is able to get into the tight space and methylenate the carbonyl group easily.|$|E

Highest VSLS mixing ratios were found near the Mauritanian coast and close to Lisbon (Portugal). Air mass origins were calculated with 5 -day backward trajectories starting at the surface and at the boundary layer top. We identified predominantly air masses from the open North Atlantic with some coastal influence in the Mauritanian upwelling area, due to the prevailing NW winds. Maximum VSLS mixing ratios above the Mauritanian upwelling were 8. 92 ppt for bromoform, 3. 14 ppt for <b>dibromomethane</b> and 3. 29 ppt for methyl iodide, with an observed maximum diurnal variability up to 50 % for bromoform, 26 % for <b>dibromomethane</b> and 56 % for methyl iodide. A relationship {{was found between the}} marine atmospheric boundary layer (MABL) height and bromoform, <b>dibromomethane</b> and methyl iodide abundances. Lowest MABL heights above the Mauritanian upwelling area coincide with highest VSLS mixing ratios and vice versa above the open ocean. Significant high anti-correlations confirm this relationship for the whole cruise. We conclude that especially above oceanic upwelling systems MABL height variations are an important driver for VSLS mixing ratio variations and elevated atmospheric abundances and may explain the so far observed missing VSLS sources in this region...|$|E

The A-band resonance Raman spectra suggest the short-time dynamics are similar to other dihalomethanes that {{are known to have}} direct photodissociation reactions in the gas phase. Several power dependent A-band resonance Raman bands were tentatively assigned to the C - Br stretch overtone progression of the CH 2 Br radical which has a strong absorption band that is coincident with the A-band resonance Raman excitation wavelength. Two-color nanosecond time-resolved resonance Raman spectra (266. 0 nm pump/ 341. 5 nm probe) were obtained and comparison of the vibrational frequencies to the results for density functional theory calculations indicate that the iso-CH 2 Br - Br species is mainly responsible for the transient photoproduct absorption band ∼ 360 nm. Our preliminary results for A-band photoexcitation of <b>dibromomethane</b> in conjunction with previously reported diiodomethane results suggest that solvation effects (probably via recombination of the CH 2 Br and Br fragments within a solvent cage) lead to noticeable production of the isodibromomethane photoisomerization photoproduct observed in the nanosecond time-resolved resonance Raman spectra. © 2000 American Chemical Society. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Vanadium haloperoxidases differ {{strongly}} from heme peroxidases in {{substrate specificity}} and stability and {{in contrast to}} a heme group they contain the bare metal oxide vanadate as a prosthetic group. These enzymes specifically oxidize halides in the presence of hydrogen peroxide into hypohalous acids. These reactive halogen intermediates will react rapidly and aspecifically with many organic molecules. Marine algae and diatoms containing these iodo-and bromoperoxidases produce short-lived brominated methanes (bromoform, CHBr 3 and <b>dibromomethane</b> CH 2 Br 2) or iodinated compounds. Some seas and oceans are supersaturated with these compounds and they form an important source of bromine to the troposphere and lower stratosphere and contribute significantly to the global budget of halogenated hydrocarbons.

Here, we investigate the contribution of natural oceanic VSLS emissions to the marine atmospheric boundary layer (MABL) and their transport into the free troposphere (FT) over the tropical West Pacific. The study concentrates on bromoform, <b>dibromomethane</b> and methyl iodide measured on ship and aircraft during the SHIVA (Stratospheric Ozone: Halogen Impacts in a Varying Atmosphere) campaign in the South China and Sulu seas in November  2011. Elevated oceanic concentrations for bromoform, <b>dibromomethane</b> and methyl iodide of on average 19. 9, 5. 0 and 3. 8  pmol L − 1, in particular close to Singapore and to the coast of Borneo, with high corresponding oceanic emissions of 1486, 405 and 433  pmol m − 2  h − 1 respectively, characterise this tropical region as a strong source of these compounds. Atmospheric mixing ratios in the MABL were unexpectedly relatively low with 2. 08, 1. 17 and 0. 39  ppt for bromoform, <b>dibromomethane</b> and methyl iodide. We use meteorological and chemical ship and aircraft observations, FLEXPART trajectory calculations and source-loss estimates to identify the oceanic VSLS contribution to the MABL and to the FT.

Bromochloromethane, <b>dibromomethane</b> and 1 -bromo- 2 -chloroethane were utilized by strain GJ 10 in batch {{culture as a}} cosubstrate and sole carbon source. The rate of degradation of dihalomethanes by whole cells was {{lower than that of}} 1, 2 -dichloroethane, but a significant increase of the rate of dihalomethane biodegradation was observed when methanol or ethanol were added as a cosubstrate. Products of the degradation of several tested compounds by haloalkane dehalogenase were analyzed and a new metabolic pathway based on hydrolytic conversion to formaldehyde was proposed for the dihalomethanes. Strain GJ 10 growing on 1, 2 -dichloroethane converted 2 -fluoroethanol and 1 -chloro- 2 -fluoroethane to 2 -fluoroacetate, which was tolerated up to a concentration of 2. 5 mM. On the basis of the results from batch cultures an inert (dichloromethane), a growth-supporting (<b>dibromomethane)</b> and a toxic (1, 2 -dibromoethane) compound were selected for testing their effects on a continuous culture of strain GJ 10 growing on 1, 2 -dichloroethane.

40|$|During {{a cruise}} of R/V METEOR in December  2012 the oceanic sources and {{emissions}} of various halogenated trace gases and their mixing ratios {{in the marine}} atmospheric boundary layer (MABL) were investigated above the Peruvian upwelling. This study presents novel observations of the three very short lived substances (VSLSs) – bromoform, <b>dibromomethane</b> and methyl iodide – together with high-resolution meteorological measurements, Lagrangian transport and source–loss calculations. Oceanic emissions of bromoform and <b>dibromomethane</b> were relatively low compared to other upwelling regions, while those for methyl iodide were very high. Radiosonde launches during the cruise revealed a low, stable MABL and a distinct trade inversion above acting as strong barriers for convection and vertical transport of trace gases in this region. Observed atmospheric VSLS abundances, sea surface temperature, relative humidity and MABL height correlated well during the cruise. We used a simple source–loss estimate to quantify the contribution of oceanic emissions along the cruise track to the observed atmospheric concentrations. This analysis showed that averaged, instantaneous emissions could not support the observed atmospheric mixing ratios of VSLSs and that the marine background abundances below the trade inversion were significantly influenced by advection of regional sources. Adding to this background, the observed maximum emissions of halocarbons in the coastal upwelling could explain the high atmospheric VSLS concentrations in combination with their accumulation under the distinct MABL and trade inversions. Stronger emissions along the nearshore coastline likely added to the elevated abundances under the steady atmospheric conditions.

The effect of climate change on the oceanic emissions of these compounds is not well quantified. Based on present-day observed global oceanic and atmospheric concentrations, and historic and future data from three CMIP 5 models, past and future sea-to-air fluxes of these VSLS are calculated. The simulations are used to infer possible effects of projected changes of physical forcing on emissions in different oceanic regimes. CMIP 5 model output for 1979 – 2100 from the historical scenario and the RCP scenarios 2. 6 and 8. 5 are used as input data for the emission calculations. Of the parameters that have the main influence on the sea-to-air fluxes, the global sea surface temperatures show a steady increase during the twenty-first century, while the projected changes of sea surface wind speed is very small. The calculated emissions based on the historical CMIP 5 model runs (1979 – 2005) increased over the 26 year period and agree well with the emissions based on ERA-Interim data. The future sea-to-air fluxes of VSLS generally increase during the twenty-first century under the assumption of constant concentration fields in the ocean and atmosphere.

40|$|Natural {{sources of}} {{bromoform}} (CHBr 3) and <b>dibromomethane</b> (CH 2 Br 2), including oceanic emissions, contribute to stratospheric and tropospheric O 3 depletion. Convective transport over tropical oceans could deliver {{large amounts of}} these short-lived organic bromine species to the upper atmosphere. High mixing ratios of atmospheric CHBr 3 in air masses from the northwest African coast have been hypothesized to originate from the biologically active Mauritanian upwelling. During a cruise into the upwelling source region in spring 2005 the atmospheric mixing ratios of the brominated compounds CHBr 3 and CH 2 Br 2 {{were found to be}} elevated above the marine background and comparable to measurements in other coastal regions. The shelf waters were identified as a source of both compounds for the atmosphere. The calculated sea-to-air emissions support the hypothesis of a strong upwelling source for reactive organic bromine. However, calculated emissions were not sufficient to explain the elevated concentrations observed in the coastal atmosphere. Other strong sources that could contribute to the large atmospheric mixing ratios previously observed over the Atlantic Ocean must exist within or near West Africa...|$|E
