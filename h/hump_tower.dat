50|$|Galesburg is {{the home}} of the Railroad Days festival held on the fourth weekend of June. The festival began in 1977 as an open house to the public from the then Burlington Northern. Burlington Northern gave train car tours of their yards. The City of Galesburg started having street fairs to draw more people to town. In 1981, the Galesburg Railroad Museum was founded and opened during Railroad Days. For a while, the city and the {{railroad}} worked together on planning the annual celebrations. In 2002, the railroad backed out of the planning of the festival and there were no tours of the yards. In 2003 the city worked with local groups to revamp the festival and the Galesburg Railroad Museum resumed bus tours of the yards. The Galesburg Railroad Museum has continued to provide tours of the yards since then. In 2010, the Galesburg Railroad Museum started offering a VIP tour of the yards, in which a select group of riders would be allowed in the <b>Hump</b> <b>Towers</b> and Diesel Shop and see the BNSF at work. During the festival, One of the largest model railroad train shows and layouts in the U.S. Midwest happens during Railroad Days at the new Galesburg High School Fieldhouse.|$|R
50|$|Much of {{the yard}} is {{composed}} of side-by-side track, switches, <b>humps,</b> and control <b>tower</b> buildings. The yard is designed to take incoming trains and reorganize and rejoin the individual cars based on destination to create new departing trains. The yard operates 24 {{hours a day and}} handles over 1 million cars (loads and empties) per year. It has flat switching capability as well as both dual and single humps. In addition to car handling, other yard facilities include locomotive repair, car washing, and car repair. In one part {{of the yard}}, a CargoFlo terminal is used for transferring flowable bulk, dry bulk (plastics) commodities between rail cars to tanker trucks, as well as a small intermodal and RoadRailer operation.|$|R
