I was terrified and thought to myself, 'What would happen to our prisoners there if this story gets out?' Nevertheless, <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> must not be silent.... People say that these things happen in wartime {{and that there is}} loyalty to the army and loyalty among the troops, which causes these things to disappear beneath the carpet. But I believe that we are betraying our real responsibility, which is to take these skeletons out of the closet, even if we think that the enemy has more skeletons than us. We must not be silent. We are all part of this terrible conspiracy of silence, and it is eating us up inside." ...|$|E
2500|$|In August 1946, Cowles {{was hired}} as the head {{basketball}} coach at the University of Michigan, succeeding Bennie Oosterbaan. [...] Upon hiring Cowles, Michigan's athletic director Fritz Crisler said, [...] "In recommending Mr. Cowles, <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are very fortunate. [...] He is absolutely in my estimation the best possible man for the position we could select." [...] In {{his first year at}} Michigan, he led the team to a 12–8 record. [...] The following year, he led the 1947–48 Michigan Wolverines to a 16–6 (.727) record. [...] The team won the 1948 Big Ten Conference championship. [...] In February 1948, as Cowles led the Wolverines to a turnaround season, the press focused on Cowles' success in Ann Arbor. [...] The Toledo Blade sports editor wrote:"Win, lose or draw in the red hot scramble for the Western Conference basketball title, the University of Michigan team has done so surprisingly well this season that Coach Ozzie Cowles is getting as much applause on the Ann Arbor campus as came to Fritz Crisler after the football season. [...] Michigan for years has prided itself on its well rounded athletic program. ... But until Cowles was lured away from Dartmouth to take charge of the Wolverine cagers, basketball wasn't going too well at Michigan. ... Those who should know what they are talking about say that Michigan is winning this year, not because of any great supply of sterling cage performers, but because of the personality and coaching finesse of Cowles." ...|$|E

5000|$|Jastrun inspires interest, does Ginczanka, {{otherwise}} {{unknown to}} me: <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> instinctively <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are dealing {{here with a}} deeper nature, with poetry of a higher pedigree (rasowsza poezja); who is she? where is this lady coming from? ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Nor can I explain it, but {{it would}} be so. I shall always be very glad to see you, and <b>I</b> do <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> ought to be friends,--because I took such a liberty with you. But in this matter I cannot help you." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Then ask {{his black}} majesty," [...] said Peterkin, [...] "as quick as you please, for, to say truth, I'm rather anxious on this point. <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> should never get on without a good interpreter." ...|$|E

Even {{without the}} sound of the guns <b>I</b> should <b>feel</b> sure <b>that</b> <b>we</b> cannot at present be far out of that course. I noticed <b>that</b> as <b>we</b> came along you hardly had to use any helm, and that the {{strength}} on both sides was very evenly balanced. So that starting out as we did from the shore, we must be travelling pretty straight. Of course in the long run we should be sure to sweep round {{one way or the other}} and lose our bearings altogether were it not for the guns. Wilfrid, we will appoint you time-keeper." ...|$|R

60|$|I plead, then, that {{we should}} agree or {{disagree}} with these men. I plead {{that we should}} agree with them at least in having an abstract belief.

The first objection is easily stated.|$|E
6000|$|To this {{question}} Harry, {{for a long}} time, could give no answer.
