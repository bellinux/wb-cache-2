60|$|For {{what seemed}} hours Carthoris squatted upon {{the stone floor}} of his prison, {{his back against the}} wall in which was sunk the heavy <b>eye-bolt</b> that secured the chain which held him.|$|E
60|$|Hazard {{glanced at}} Gus {{and then put}} the flask back in his pocket. But when they pulled the doubled rope through the last <b>eye-bolt</b> and {{set foot on the}} Saddle, he again drew out the bottle.|$|E
60|$|Some seventy {{feet above}} them {{projected}} the first <b>eye-bolt.</b> The winter accumulations of ice had twisted and bent it down till {{it did not}} stand more than a bare {{inch and a half}} above the rock--a most difficult object to lasso as such a distance. Time and again Hazard coiled his lariat in true cowboy fashion and made the cast, and time and again was he baffled by the elusive peg. Nor could Gus do better. Taking advantage of inequalities in the surface, they scrambled twenty feet up the Dome and found they could rest in a shallow crevice. The cleft side of the Dome was so near that they could look over its edge from the crevice and gaze down the smooth, vertical wall for nearly two thousand feet. It was yet too dark down below for them to see farther.|$|E
6000|$|Excepting the ring-bolts, <b>eye-bolts,</b> and belaying-pins {{scattered}} about the decks, this bright-work, as it is called, is principally about the guns, embracing the [...] "monkey-tails" [...] of the carronades, the screws, prickers, little irons, and other things.|$|R
60|$|But {{we never}} bothered with the commissary. Our hustlers drew better rations from the farmers. Our new captain, however, doubted us. He never knew when he'd see the ten of us again, {{once we got}} {{under way in the}} morning, so he called in a {{blacksmith}} to clinch his captaincy. In the stern of our boat, one on each side, were driven two heavy <b>eye-bolts</b> of iron. Correspondingly, on the bow of his boat, were fastened two huge iron hooks. The boats were brought together, end on, the hooks dropped into the <b>eye-bolts,</b> and there we were, hard and fast. We couldn't lose that captain. But we were irrepressible. Out of our very manacles we wrought an invincible device that enabled us to put it all over every other boat in the fleet.|$|R
60|$|In {{the years}} which followed, many bold men took {{advantage}} of the huge rope ladder which he had put in place; but one winter ladder, cables and all were carried away by the snow and ice. True, most of the <b>eye-bolts,</b> twisted and bent, remained. But few men had since essayed the hazardous undertaking, and of those few more than one gave up his life on the treacherous heights, and not one succeeded.|$|R
60|$|Success vindicated Gus's contention. The second time, just as {{it seemed}} as if his slide would be repeated, he made a last supreme effort and gripped the coveted peg. By means of the rope, Hazard quickly joined him. The next peg was nearly sixty feet away; but for nearly half that {{distance}} the base of some glacier in the forgotten past had ground a shallow furrow. Taking advantage of this, it was easy for Gus to lasso the <b>eye-bolt.</b> And it seemed, as was really the case, that the hardest part of the task was over. True, the curve steepened to nearly sixty degrees above them, but a comparatively unbroken line of eye-bolts, six feet apart, awaited the lads. They no longer had even to use the lasso. Standing on one peg it was child's play to throw the bight of the rope over the next and to draw themselves up to it.|$|E
60|$|Within the ship, all was still. Here {{and there}} a lantern threw its {{wavering}} light around, but {{the shadows of the}} masts and guns, and other objects, rendered this relief to the night trifling. The lieutenant of the watch paced the weather side of the quarter-deck, silent but attentive. Occasionally he hailed the look-outs, and admonished them to be vigilant, also, and at each turn he glanced upward to see how the top-sail stood. Four or five old and thoughtful seamen walked the waist and forecastle, but most of the watch were stowed between the guns, or in the best places they could find, under the lee of the bulwarks, catching cat's naps. This was an indulgence denied the young gentlemen, of whom one was on the forecastle, leaning against the mast, dreaming of home, one in the waist, supporting the nettings, and one walking the lee-side of the quarter-deck, his eyes shut, his thoughts confused, and his footing uncertain. As Bluewater stepped on the quarter-deck-ladder, to descend to his own cabin, the youngster hit his foot against an <b>eye-bolt,</b> and fetched way plump up against his superior. Bluewater caught the lad in his arms, and saved him from a fall, setting him fairly on his feet before he let him go.|$|E
60|$|Ever {{since the}} vessel left the docks, {{there had been}} six sets of spars of a form so singular, lying among the booms, that they had often {{been the subject of}} {{conversation}} between the mates and myself, neither of the former being able to tell their uses. These sticks were of no great length, some fifteen feet at the most, of sound English oak. Two or three pairs were alike, for they were in pairs, each pair having one of the sides of a shape resembling different parts of the ship's bottom, with the exception that they were chiefly concave, while the bottom of a vessel is mainly convex. At one extremity each pair was firmly connected by a short, massive, iron link, of about two feet in length; and, at its opposite end, a large <b>eye-bolt</b> was driven into each stick, where it was securely forelocked. When the Walrus was stationary, we learned, for the first time, the uses of these unusual preparations. A pair of the timbers, which were of great solidity and strength, were dropped over the stern, and, sinking beneath the keel, their upper extremities were separated by means of lanyards turned into the eye-bolts. The lanyards were then brought forward to the bilge of the vessel, where, by the help of tackles, the timbers were rowsed up in such a manner that the links came close to the false keel, and the timbers themselves were laid snug against each side of the ship. As great care had been taken, by means of marks on the vessel, as well as in forming the skids themselves, the fit was perfect. No less than five pairs were secured in and near the bilge, and as many more were distributed forwards and aft, according to the shape of the bottom. Fore-and-aft pieces, that reached from one skid to the other, were then placed between those about the bilge of the ship, each of them having a certain number of short ribs, extending upwards and downwards. These fore-and-aft pieces were laid along the waterline, their ends entering the skids by means of mortices and tenons, where they were snugly bolted. The result of the entire arrangement was, to give the vessel an exterior protection against the field-ice, by means of a sort of network of timber, the whole of which had been so accurately fitted in the dock, as to bear equally on her frame. These preparations were not fairly completed before ten o'clock on the following morning, when Noah stood directly for an opening in the ice before us, which just about that time began to be apparent.|$|E
60|$|One day, {{a couple}} of clear-headed mountaineers had {{proceeded}} to insert iron <b>eye-bolts</b> into holes which they drilled into the rock every few feet apart. But when they found themselves three hundred feet above the Saddle, clinging like flies to the precarious wall with on either hand a yawning abyss, their nerves failed them and they abandoned the enterprise. So it remained for an indomitable Scotchman, one George Anderson, finally to achieve the feat. Beginning where they had left off, drilling and climbing for a week, he had at last set foot upon that awful summit and gazed down into the depths where Mirror Lake reposed, nearly a mile beneath.|$|R
6000|$|Still {{there was}} a good deal of general {{information}} flying about the schooner on stormy days, when they lay up in the fo'c'sle or sat on the cabin lockers, while spare <b>eye-bolts,</b> leads, and rings rolled and rattled in the pauses of the talk. Disko spoke of whaling voyages in the Fifties; of great she-whales slain beside their young; of death agonies on the black, tossing seas, and blood that spurted forty feet in the air; of boats smashed to splinters; of patent rockets that went off wrong-end-first and bombarded the trembling crews; of cutting-in and boiling-down, and that terrible [...] "nip" [...] of '71, when twelve hundred men were made homeless on the ice in three days--wonderful tales, all true. But more wonderful still were his stories of the cod, and how they argued and reasoned on their private businesses deep down below the keel.|$|R
50|$|This hull armor {{had been}} {{installed}} {{in just three}} days, {{more than a year}} before, while Kearsarge was in port at the Azores. It was made using 720 ft of 1.7 in single-link iron chain and covered hull spaces 49 ft long by 6 ft deep. It was stopped up and down in three layers to <b>eye-bolts</b> with marlines and secured by iron dogs. This was then concealed behind 1 in deal-boards painted black to match the upper hulls color. This chain cladding was placed along Kearsarges port and starboard midsection down to her waterline, for the purpose of protecting her engines and boilers when the upper portion of the cruiser's coal bunkers were empty. This armor belt was hit twice during the fight: First in the starboard gangway by one of Alabamas 32-pounder shells which cut the chain armor, denting the hull planking underneath, then again by a second 32-pounder shell that exploded and broke a link of the chain, tearing away a portion of the deal-board covering. Even if the shells had been delivered by Alabamas more powerful 100-pounder Blakely pivot rifle, the impacts were more than 5 ft above the waterline and would therefore have missed her vital machinery.|$|R
5000|$|The Berrima {{line was}} the home of two [...] "Tin Hares". The first entered service in the late 1920s, having been {{converted}} from a 1926-7 Chevrolet truck. It was used to convey the Medway Colliery Mine Manager and his deputy between the Cement Works and the mine. At weekends, the railcar was used by maintenance staff. The car could operate in the forward direction only. To enable the vehicle to be turned, a vertical steel bar, with an <b>eye-bolt</b> on the top, ran up through the cab. A gantry crane located at the colliery was used to lift and turn it at that end of the line, whilst an overhead travelling crane at the works performed the same job there.|$|E
6000|$|We had an {{ordinary}} run to Charleston, {{and began to}} prepare for the reception of our cargo. At this time, there were two French privateers on the southern coast, that did a great deal of damage to our trade. One went into Savannah, and got burned, for her pains; and the other came into Charleston, and narrowly escaped the same fate. A mob collected--made a fire-raft, and came alongside of our ship, demanding some tar. To own the truth, though then clothed with all the dignity of a [...] "Dicky," [...] [5] I liked the fun, and offered no resistance. Bill Swett had come in, in a ship called the United States; and he was on board the Sterling, at the time, on a visit to me. We two, off hatches, and whipped a barrel of tar on deck; which we turned over to the raftsmen, with our hearty good wishes for their success. All this was, legally, very wrong; but, I still think, it was not so very far from being morally just; at least, as regards the privateersmen. The attempt failed, however, and those implicated were blamed a great deal more than they would have been, had they burned up the Frenchmen's <b>eye-bolts.</b> It is bad to fail, in a legal undertaking; but success is indispensable for forgiveness, to one that is illegal.|$|R
60|$|Next morning {{men from}} the shore saw the Haliotis through a cloud, for {{it was as though}} the deck smoked. Her crew were chasing steam through the shaken and leaky pipes to its work in the forward donkey-engine; and where oakum failed to plug a crack, they {{stripped}} off their loin-cloths for lapping, and swore, half-boiled and mother-naked. The donkey-engine worked - at a price - the price of constant attention and furious stoking- worked long enough to allow a wire-rope (it was made up of a funnel and a foremast-stay) to be led into the engine-room and made fast on the cylinder-cover of the forward engine. That rose easily enough, and was hauled through the skylight and on to the deck, many hands assisting the doubtful steam. Then came the tug of war, for it was necessary to get to the piston and the jammed piston-rod. They removed two of the piston junk-ring studs, screwed in two strong iron <b>eye-bolts</b> by way of handles, doubled the wire-rope, and set half a dozen men to smite with an extemporised battering-ram {{at the end of the}} piston-rod, where it peered through the piston, while the donkey-engine hauled upwards on the piston itself. After four hours of this furious work, the piston-rod suddenly slipped, and the piston rose with a jerk, knocking one or two men over into the engine-room. But when Mr. Wardrop declared that the piston had not split, they cheered, and thought nothing of their wounds; and the donkey-engine was hastily stopped; its boiler was nothing to tamper with.|$|R

5000|$|Kearsarge's hull armor {{had been}} {{installed}} {{in just three}} days, {{more than a year}} before, while she was in port at the Azores. It was made using [...] of 1.7 in single link iron chain and covered hull spaces 49 ft long by 6 ft deep. It was stopped up and down to <b>eye-bolts</b> with marlines and secured by iron dogs. Her chain armor was concealed behind 1-inch deal-boards painted black to match the upper hull's color. This [...] "chaincladding" [...] was placed along Kearsarges port and starboard midsection down to the waterline, for additional protection of her engine and boilers when the upper portion of her coal bunkers were empty (coal bunkers played an important part in the protection of early steam vessels, such as protected cruisers). A hit to her engine or boilers could easily leave Kearsarge dead in the water and vulnerable, or even cause a boiler explosion or fire that could destroy the cruiser. Her armor belt was hit twice during the fight: First in the starboard gangway by one of Alabamas 32-pounder shells that cut the chain armor, denting the hull planking underneath, then again by a second 32-pounder shell that exploded and broke a link of the chain armor, tearing away a portion of the deal-board covering. If those rounds had come from Alabamas more powerful 100-pounder Blakely pivot rifle, they would have easily penetrated, but the likely result would not have been very serious, as both shots struck the hull a little more than five feet above the waterline. Even if both shots had penetrated Kearsarges side, they would have completely missed her vital machinery. However, a 100-pound shell could have done a great deal of damage to her interior and nearby crewmen; hot fragments could have easily set fire to the cruiser, one of the greatest risks aboard a wooden vessel. A little more than an hour after the first shot was fired, Alabama was reduced to a sinking wreck by Kearsarges powerful 11 in Dahlgrens, forcing Captain Semmes to strike his colors and to send one of his two surviving boats to Kearsarge to ask for assistance.|$|R
