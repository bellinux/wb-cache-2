40|$|MAMMARY cancer <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> {{has been}} <b>the</b> subject of {{intensive}} study throughout {{a long period}} of years and the frequency of metastatic spread to the bones probably equals if not exceeds the frequency of metastasis to lungs and liver (Haagensen, 1956).

25|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>Women</b> and Gender Equity Knowledge Network's Final Report to the WHO Commission on Social Determinants of Health in 2007, {{health systems}} in many {{countries}} were noted to {{have been unable to}} deliver adequately on gender equity in health. One explanation for this issue is that many healthcare systems tend to neglect the fact that men and women’s health needs can be very different. In the report, studies have found evidence that the healthcare system can promote gender disparities in health through the lack of gender equity in terms of the way women are regarded - as both consumers (users) and producers (carers) of health care services. For instance, healthcare systems tend to regard women as objects rather than subjects, where services are often provided to women as a means of something else rather on the well-being of women. In the case of reproductive health services, these services are often provided as a form of fertility control rather than as care for women's well-being. Additionally, although the majority of the workforce in health care systems are female, many of the working conditions remain discriminatory towards women. Many studies have shown that women are often expected to conform to male work models that ignore their special needs, such as childcare or protection from violence. This significantly reduces the ability and efficiency of female caregivers providing care to patients, particularly female ones.|$|E

500|$|Other {{parts of}} the story also derive from the author's life: Balzac once {{attended}} a feast held by the Marquis de Las Marismas, who planned to launch a newspaper– the same situation in which Valentin finds himself after expressing his first wish to the talisman. Later, Valentin visits the opera armed with a powerful set of glasses that allow him to observe every flaw <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>women</b> on stage (to guard against desire).

During Scherzinger's solo, she stands in a small area with the Pussycat Dolls logo to the left and a mirror to the right, with lights flashing. The Dolls then dance in the breakdown section with the logo behind them and the camera zooms out to reveal filming equipment and playback screens.|$|E

40|$|The {{numerous}} studies of Maxine Hong Kingston's touchstone work <b>The</b> <b>Woman</b> Warrior {{fail to take}} into account <b>the</b> stories <b>in</b> China Men, which were largely written together with those <b>in</b> <b>The</b> <b>Woman</b> Warrior but later published separately. Although Hong Kingston's decision to separate the male and female narratives enabled readers to see the strength of the resulting feminist point of view <b>in</b> <b>The</b> <b>Woman</b> Warrior, <b>the</b> author has steadily maintained that to understand the book fully it was necessary to read its male companion text. Maureen Sabine's ambitious study of <b>The</b> <b>Woman</b> Warrior and China Men aims to bring these divided texts back together with a close reading that looks for the textual traces of <b>the</b> father <b>in</b> <b>The</b> <b>Woman</b> Warrior and shows how the daughter narrator tracks down his history in China Men. She considers theories of intertextuality that open up the possibility of a dynamic interplay between the two books and suggests that <b>the</b> Hong family <b>women</b> and men may be struggling for dialogue with each other even when they appear textually silent or apart...|$|R
