When MacLeod {{revealed}} his immortality to Tessa in [...] "Counterfeit Part Two", she can show compassion instead of the fear or disgust he expects: [...] "I was just thinking how lonely you must be. Your parents, your friends... having them all die." [...] Tessa is a very empathic and understanding character, for example, in [...] "Saving Grace", she is jealous of MacLeod's former lover Grace; however, when MacLeod assures her {{that he no longer}} loves Grace, her response is simply that [...] "...that's all that need to be said. She's your friend and she's been hurt. You'll help her. I'd <b>expect</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> do no less." ...|$|E
500|$|The song's lyrics {{allude to}} his {{supposed}} relationship with Mariah Carey, the music video for [...] "Obsessed", and pictures and proof {{he claims to}} have of the couple. The song begins [...] "Only reason I dissed you in the first place is because you denied seeing me. Now I'm pissed off," [...] before describing Carey's impersonation of him in her video, [...] "Oh gee, is that supposed to be me in the video with the goatee?/ Wow Mariah, didn't <b>expect</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> go balls out." [...] Eminem continues describing a near-sexual encounter with the singer, threatening to release voice-mails and pictures he still has in his possession. Additionally, the song features a females voice, unknown whether or not Carey's, where she calls herself Mary Poppins, as well as several intervals of her laughter.|$|E
500|$|... "Unusual You" [...] is a midtempo electropop song, {{that has}} been {{described}} by Nekesa Mumbi Moody of the Associated Press as [...] "synth-centric". The song has been noted by John Murphy of musicOMH to be reminiscent of [...] "Gwen Stefani's quieter moments." [...] Ann Powers of the Los Angeles Times commented that [...] "Unusual You" [...] "goes for that shimmering waterfall mood first popularized by Janet Jackson rather than strict Madonna-style workouts." [...] According to Chris Richards of The Washington Post, Spears's vocals in the song are transformed into [...] "a spectral [...]" [...] Lyrically, [...] "Unusual You" [...] talks about an experienced woman finding unexpected love, with Spears voicing the lines, [...] "Didn't anyone tell you you're supposed to break my heart? / I <b>expect</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> / So why haven't you?." ...|$|E

500|$|After Lollapalooza, {{the band}} {{embarked}} on a worldwide tour, which was supported by Moby. Tensions continued to increase and {{when asked if the}} band hated touring, Cornell said, [...] "We really enjoy it to a point and then it gets tedious, because it becomes repetitious. You feel like fans have paid their money and they <b>expect</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> come out and play them your songs like the first time you ever played them. That's the point where we hate touring." [...] The band was criticized for its lack of energy while performing. Cornell said that [...] "after a number of years, you start to feel like you're acting. All those people who criticize us for not jumping around should shut the fuck up, and when they come to our shows they should jump around and entertain us for a while." [...] Thayil had an issue with how the band's audience had changed, stating that [...] "nowadays, you also have the kids and the housewives, the casual fans. With your casual fans, you say, 'Thanks for the money.' And they say, 'Thanks for the song.'" [...] The band's concerts in December 1996 were postponed for a week due to Cornell's throat problems.|$|E
500|$|The band took a slot on the 1996 Lollapalooza {{tour with}} Metallica, who {{had insisted on}} Soundgarden's {{appearance}} on the tour. After Lollapalooza, the band embarked on a world tour, and already-existing tensions increased during it. When asked whether the band hated touring, Cornell replied: [...] "We really enjoy it to a point, and then it gets tedious, because it becomes repetitious. You feel like fans have paid their money and they <b>expect</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> come out and play them your songs {{like the first time}} you ever played them. That's the point where we hate touring." [...] At the tour's last stop in Honolulu, Hawaii on February 9, 1997, Shepherd threw his bass into the air in frustration after suffering equipment failure, and then stormed off the stage. The band retreated, with Cornell returning to end the show with a solo encore. On April 9, 1997, the band announced it was disbanding. Thayil said, [...] "It was pretty obvious from everybody's general attitude {{over the course of the}} previous half year that there was some dissatisfaction." [...] Cameron later said that Soundgarden was [...] "eaten up by the business". The band released a greatest hits collection entitled A-Sides on November 4, 1997, composed of 17 songs, including the previously-unreleased [...] "Bleed Together," [...] which had been recorded during the Down on the Upside recording sessions.|$|E
500|$|A formal United States Navy {{board of}} inquiry, {{known as the}} Hepburn Investigation, {{prepared}} {{a report of the}} battle. The board interviewed most of the major Allied officers involved over several months, beginning in December 1942. [...] The report recommended official censure for only one officer, Captain Howard D. Bode of the Chicago, for failing to broadcast a warning to the fleet of encroaching enemy ships. The report stopped short of recommending formal action against other Allied officers, including Admirals Fletcher, Turner, McCain, and Crutchley, and Captain Riefkohl. Vice Admiral Ghormley was relieved not long afterward. [...] Vice Admiral Fletcher and Rear Admiral Noyes were relieved of their commands. The careers of Turner, Crutchley, and McCain do not appear to have been affected by the defeat or the mistakes they made in contributing to it. Riefkohl, however, never commanded ships again. Captain Bode, upon learning that the report was going to be especially critical of his actions, shot himself in his quarters at Balboa, Panama Canal Zone, on April 19, 1943, and died the next day. Crutchley was gazetted with the Legion of Merit (Chief Commander) in September 1944. Admiral Yamamoto signaled a congratulatory note to Mikawa on his victory, stating, [...] "Appreciate the courageous and hard fighting of every man of your organization. I <b>expect</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> expand your exploits and you will make every effort to support the land forces of the Imperial army which are now engaged in a desperate struggle." [...] Later on, though, when it became apparent that Mikawa had missed an opportunity to destroy the Allied transports, he was intensely criticised by his comrades. [...] Admiral Turner later assessed why his forces were so soundly defeated in the battle: ...|$|E
