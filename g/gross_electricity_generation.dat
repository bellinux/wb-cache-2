The ED is calculated as net imports divided by the sum of gross inland energy consumption plus bunkers. This study aims at obtaining numerical equations to estimate of Turkey's energy dependency based on basic energy indicators and sectoral energy consumption by using artificial neural network (ANN) technique. It seeks to contribute to the strategies necessary to preserve the supply-demand balance of Turkey. For this purpose, two different models were used to train the ANN approach. In Model 1, main energy indicators such as total production of primary energy per capita, total <b>gross</b> <b>electricity</b> <b>generation</b> per capita and final energy consumption per capita were used in the input layer of the ANN while sectoral energy consumption per capita was used in Model 2.

The R 2 values of ED were found to be 0. 999 for both models. In accordance with the analysis results, ED is expected to increase from 72 % to 82 % within 14 years of period.

40|$|With the {{incremental}} introduction of solar photovoltaic (PV) generators into existing power systems, and their fast-growing {{share in the}} <b>gross</b> <b>electricity</b> <b>generation,</b> system voltage stability has become a critical issue. One of the major concerns is voltage fluctuation, due to large and random penetration of solar PV generators. To suppress severe system voltage deviation, reactive power control of the photovoltaic system inverter has been widely proposed in recent works; however, excessive use of reactive power control would increase both initial and operating costs. In this paper, a method for efficient allocation and control of reactive power injection using the sparse optimization technique is proposed. Based on a constrained linearized model describing the influence of reactive power injection on voltage magnitude change, {{the objective of this}} study is formulated as an optimization problem, which aims to find the best reactive power injection that minimizes the whole system voltage variation. Two types of formulations are compared: the first one is the conventional least-square optimization, while the second one is adopted from a sparse optimization technique, called the constrained least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method. The constrained LASSO method adds ℓ 1 -norm penalty to the total reactive power injection, which contributes to the suppression of the number of control nodes with non-zero reactive power injection. The authors analyzed the effectiveness of the constrained LASSO method using the IEEE 39 -bus and 57 -bus power network as benchmark examples, under various PV power generation and allocation patterns. The simulation results show that the constrained LASSO method automatically selects the minimum number of inverters required for voltage regulation at the current operating point...|$|E
40|$|Power {{system losses}} {{have turned out}} to be a major {{challenge}} for electricity utilities worldwide and losses in electricity distribution represent dominant part in the overall power system losses. In the Sri Lankan context, losses in the distribution system are around 8. 5 % of <b>gross</b> <b>electricity</b> <b>generation</b> when the total losses in transmission and distribution amount to 10. 5 % in 2014. Though this can be viewed as a reasonably good level, when compared with the power system losses in rest of the developing countries in the region, country need long strides to reach the levels achieved by the developed countries. Before formulating strategies for loss reduction, it is essential to determine the losses at each level. Once losses are segregated, utility can clearly identify their priorities and launch effective programs to arrest losses. At present the CEB doesn’t have the data required to calculate the energy loss of the LV network and has only few basic information. Further collecting LV network data and calculating the LV loss by modeling the LV network is difficult to be done practically. So, the objective of this study was to build a suitable methodology to calculate the transformer wise energy loss using the available LV network data in CEB to identify the transformers with high technical energy loss and the areas with higher nontechnical loss. In this study, total transformers were divided into 3 groups according to the consumer mix and 6 sample transformers were selected. Then calculated the technical power loss of feeders after doing the synergy modeling for the each feeder that has been selected and a formula was built to calculate the feeder power loss based on the results obtained. The technical energy loss of each transformer is calculated after calculating the feeder wise technical power loss of the 20 transformers using the built formula. Based on the results of the 20 transformers a formula was built to calculate the technical energy loss. According to the results of this study, the technical energy loss of LV network in Ratmalana area is 2. 6 %. and it increases to 3. 12 %, when lines are consisted with 70 mm 2 ABC lines. Further, there are 10 % of transformers in this area with technical energy loss greater than 4 % and 50 % of the transformers has a value less than 1. 5 %...|$|E

The proposed system is composed of a rigid cylinder and thin plates at both ends.

In this system, vibration energy is converted into electrical energy via electromechanical coupling between the plate vibration and piezoelectric effect.
