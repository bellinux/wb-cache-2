40|$|Concepts in Design Yoram Reich Steven J. Fenves 1. Introduction Design is an ill-structured problem, {{in which}} there are often vague {{criteria}} for `success', the search space is ill-defined, and resources (e. <b>g.,</b> <b>time)</b> are <b>limited.</b> Building expert systems for design, henceforth called design systems, requires relevant domain knowledge and representation schemes that support the solution of this inherently ill-structured problem. However, manual knowledge acquisition has been a bottleneck in creating expert systems in general and design systems more specifically. One approach for alleviating some of the difficulties of knowledge acquisition is the introduction of learning into the development and maintenance stages of expert systems (Reich & Fenves, 1989; Steels & Van de Velde, 1986). Learning can assist in automatically building design systems as well as in understanding a specific design domain. 2 Y. Reich and S. J. Fenves The principal emphasis of this chapter is on the acquisition o [...] ...|$|R

In this study, 18 - to 39 -year-olds {{diagnosed with cancer}} during young adulthood were interviewed to identify the types of behavioral and psychosocial programs needed. These young adult cancer survivors {{were also asked to}} identify potential barriers to program utilization. Participants expressed interest in programs targeting physical activity, relaxation, emotional support, provision of cancer-related and other information, and nutrition/weight loss. Emergent themes included the importance of choice, flexibility, convenience, and similarity to other program participants. Barriers to participation included practical barriers (e. <b>g.,</b> <b>limited</b> <b>time),</b> lack of awareness of programs, health issues (e. g., fatigue), and psychosocial barriers (e. g., low motivation). Results highlight a range of unmet psychosocial and behavioral needs among young adult cancer survivors. This information can be used to develop {{interventions for}} this population.

40|$|Recent {{studies suggest}} that {{individual}} perceptions of informa-tion credibility are important determinants of knowledge utilization in government decisionmaking. This theory—credibility logic—has been mostly normative. One positive theory, cognitive response, is used along with credibility-logic arguments to predict evaluations of alternatives {{with varying degrees of}} net benefits and information credibility. Experimental results for 75 MPA students using a 3 x 3 repeated measures with Latin square design found mixed support for cognitive-response theory. Credibility was most important when it contradicted net benefit levels and for the evaluation of proposals reporting medium net benefits. One perplexing problem in public administration is how to get decisionmakers to use quality policy analysis. Explana-tions for this malaise based on the scientific status of policy analysis have proven inadequate (Dunn 1981; Schneider et al. 1982; Useem and Dimaggio 1978; Kahneman et al. 1982; Dror 1984). Alternative explanations include bounded rationality (e. <b>g.,</b> <b>limited</b> <b>time</b> and cognitive abilities in evaluating informa-tion; cf. Wright 1974), poor knowledge-transfer strategies (Bowman 1978; Glaser et al. 1983; Leviton and Hughes 1981), and differences in values, goals, and work styles between decisionmakers and policy analysts (Aronson and Sherwoo...|$|R
40|$|<b>Time</b> <b>Limit</b> for Tax Assessment The thesis {{deals with}} the <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> for tax {{assessment}} as it is regulated especially in the Tax Procedure Code (Act No. 280 / 2009 Coll.). The <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> for tax assessment represents {{a period of time}} during which it is possible to assess the tax. This <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> thus creates a time frame of the whole tax administration because tax decision is its aim, and in the case in which tax cannot be assessed {{there is no reason to}} proceed with any tax administration. Its main purpose consists in the establishment of certainty providing that after the lapse of the period of time, rights and duties relating to substantive tax law cannot be changed. The thesis is composed of two basic chapters. Chapter One is introductory and describes the phenomenon of <b>time</b> <b>limits.</b> It is subdivided into three parts. Part One focuses on the concept and categories of <b>time</b> <b>limits.</b> Part Two explains general aspects of the <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> for tax assessment. Part Three {{deals with the}} calculation of <b>time</b> <b>limits.</b> Chapter Two focuses on legal regulation of the <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> for tax assessment. Chapter Two is divided in ten parts. Part One defines the beginning of the <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> for tax assessment. Part Two looks at the extension of the <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> for tax assessment. Part Three deals with the interruption of time [...] ...|$|R

40|$|In {{the current}} study, we {{assessed}} whether undergraduate electronic gaming machine (EGM) gamblers {{would be more}} apt to set a <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> and spend less time gambling when asked to consider setting an explicit <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> prior to their gambling session. To this end, participants (N ¼ 43) {{were randomly assigned to}} a <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> pop-up condition or control condition, both of which involved gambling on an EGM in a virtual reality (VR) casino. In the <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> pop-up condition, participants were asked (via pop-up message) to consider setting a <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> on play and entering that limit in an available text box prior to commencing play. In the no <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> pop-up condition, participants engaged in play immediately upon accessing the EGM in the VR casino (i. e. they were not exposed to a <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> pop-up message). As predicted, participants who were explicitly asked to consider setting a <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> on their EGM play were signiﬁcantly more likely to do so and spent less time gambling than those who were not given such instructions. The results provide preliminary support for the contention that setting a <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> on EGM play is an effective responsible gambling strategy...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study is}} to develop an eco-friendly textiles to decrease environmental pollution and to be harmless for human health by investigating how the natural chorangak liquid treatment affects the changes of mechanical properties and the hand of silk fabrics according to different treatment conditions. Treatment was varied with various temperatures (85 ℃, 90 ℃, 95 ℃) for 90 seconds after degumming. The results were as follows: 1) The natural chorangak liquid is the most effective at the ratio of glacial acid 200 ml with eggshell 20 <b>g</b> minimizing the <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> and sludge reduction. Its treatment of silk fabrics is optimized at 90 ℃ for 90 seconds with 25 % conc. after degumming when considering tenacity and elongation. 2) After the treatment, tenacity and elongation of specimen are increased compared with those of degummed silk fabrics. 3) After analyzing the effect of the treatment on the characteristic values of basic mechanical properties of silk fabrics, mechanical properties (tensile, bending, shearing, compression, surface) are overall improved. The properties of thickness and weight are increased as well. 4) Based on the clear analysis on effects of the treatment on the mechanical properties and the hand of silk fabrics, the level of THV was enhanced from good to excellent. Therefore, chorangak liquid can be utilized satisfactorily as a new finishing agent for developing eco-friendly textiles...|$|R

40|$|A {{consensus}} {{has formed}} in the welfare reform literature suggesting that welfare eligible households (WEH) “bank ” benefits {{in the presence of}} <b>time</b> <b>limits,</b> either by delaying enrollment in welfare or exiting well before the <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> is reached. In this study, we use the standard labor-leisure lifetime utility to analyze the behavioral effects of imposing <b>time</b> <b>limits</b> on welfare use. Our approach is different from our predecessors (which model welfare participation) in that we model delayed enrollment in and early exit from welfare. Our results suggest that prior to <b>time</b> <b>limits,</b> WEH enroll in welfare as soon as eligibility is established and remain on assistance programs until their youngest children reach adulthood. Moreover, <b>time</b> <b>limits</b> do not alter this behavior in WEH with older children.

40|$|Land use {{management}} {{is the key}} to improving water quality. This is particularly true for nonpoint source pollution, which cannot be controlled solely with standard regulatory permitting and enforcement techniques. In many areas of the United States, land use decisions are made primarily at the local level by a combination of elected, professional, and volunteer municipal officials. Because the cumulative water quality impacts of these local decisions can be enormous, educating municipal officials about the relationship of land use to water quality is a critical step to watershed management. The current proliferation of laws, regulations, and technical guidance directed at nonpoint source management will further increase the need for education. As this wave of information cascades from federal to state to local agencies, the task of making this material understandable, or at least accessible, to municipal implementers has been given little consideration. Adding to these difficulties are the traditional problems associated with local volunteer decision makers (e. <b>g.,</b> the <b>limited</b> <b>time</b> that most people can devote to this one issue {{in the course of their}} routine responsibilities, and the high turnover rate in membership typically experienced by municipal commissions).

Thus, state <b>time</b> <b>limits</b> were directly linked with the provision ofjob services while sanction penalties were applicable to the entire caseload. In this paper, we examine the <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> and sanction effects on the duration of cash assistance for all families that entered the caseload from January 1997 to September 1999.
