40|$|<b>External</b> <b>plasticization</b> is {{a widely}} applied {{technique}} to improve PLA processability and toughness. Keys to successful plasticization of PLA are the miscibility of the plasticizer and its permanence in the polymer structure to ensure long-term stability of the material. To provide rules for successful plasticizing of PLA, a brief reminder of physicochemical mechanisms behind plasticization is given and the main theories allowing for the calculation of solubility parameters are summarized. To make use of this approach, a number of solubility parameters were gathered for potential PLA plasticizers. This chapter provides furthermore a comprehensive overview of literature results on glass transition temperatures and mechanical properties obtained for PLA and PLA nanocomposites mixed with monomeric and polymeric plasticizers. Additionally, physical and chemical long-term stability of plasticized materials is detailed. Finally, novel strategies of compounding PLA with additives derived from by-products of agriculture and food industries are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Cellulose acetate needs {{appropriate}} plasticization {{for proper}} processing and achieving suitable properties. At thermoplastic foam production via melt technologies rheological and thermal properties are key factors for {{the generation of}} high quality products. Therefore, the influence of <b>external</b> <b>plasticization</b> on rheological and thermal properties of cellulose acetate (CA) was investigated. Different types of plasticizers were used for this study. The influence on the properties depends largely {{on the type of}} plasticizer and its compatibility with CA. Glass transition temperature of CA decreased significantly with increasing plasticizer content whereas thermal stability of CA remains almost constant. Melt processing is enhanced due to broadening of the thermoplastic window. The rheological behavior of CA was significantly improved by increasing plasticizer content. Melt flow increases while melt viscosity decreases with an increase in plasticizer content. Also melt strength and drawability were considerably improved. As expected, plasticizer performance is closely linked to the miscibility and mutual compatibility of the plasticizer with CA...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is to get further knowledge on the <b>external</b> <b>plasticization</b> mechanisms of melt extruded polyhydroxyl- 3 -butyrate-co- 3 -valerate (PHBV) when combined with wheat straw fibers (WSF). Different types of biodegradable substances, all authorized for food contact according to the European regulation, i. e., acetyltributyl citrate (ATBC), glycerol triacetate (GTA) and (PEG) at different molecular weights, were tested at different percentages (5, 10 and 20 wt %). Thermal and mechanical characterization of PHBV/plasticizer blends showed that a significant plasticizing effect was obtained using hydrophobic substances such as ATBC and GTA, with an increase of the elongation at break from 1. 8 % up to about 6 % for an additive content of 10 wt %. However, the incorporation of WSF in plasticized PHBV led to a dramatic decrease in the elongation at break of composites, neutralizing the increase of this parameter {{by the addition of}} the plasticizers. The stress at break of plasticized films was also significantly decreased by the introduction of fibers. Such a loss of ductility was mainly explained by the occurrence of microscopic defects in the materials induced by the presence of fibers and to a poor adhesion at the fiber/matrix interface...|$|E
40|$|Irradiation of {{azobenzene}} induces isomerization {{between its}} trans- and cis forms. By introduction of azobenzene chromophores in polymers, {{it is possible}} to optically control a variety of polymer properties. The isomerization of azobenzene can be used to influence conformational, optical or surface properties of the poly mer material. The performance is dependent on the individual properties of the chromophore and the polymer, and on how the chromophore is attached to or otherwise dispersed in the polymer. The project has focused on how the polymer chain segments around the chromophore interacts or interferes with its isomerization reaction. It is well known that the isomerization of azobenzene chromophores in solid polymers is highly influenced by the free volume and mobility characteristics of the polymer environment. In order to study this, a number of poly(methyl methacrylate) copolymers with azobenzene chromophores in the side chain were synthe sized. The yield of the trans-cis photoisomerization and the reaction kinetics of the cis-trans thermal back- reaction of the copolymers were investigated. The copolymers differed with respect to the length of the side chain, the concentration of azobenzene side chains and the type of substituents on the azobenzene chromophores. In addition, the influence of physical ageing and <b>external</b> <b>plasticization</b> of the copolymers were investigated. The rate of the cis-trans thermal isomerization of the azo copolymers in solution was found to depend on the substituents on the azobenzene molecule. The isomerization kinetics in solid state was shown to be influenced by the glass transition temperature of the polymer, by the length of the azobenzene side chain and by the thermal history of the polymer. The isomerization proceeded with a distribution of rate constants that was shown to depend on the mechanical relaxation times of the surrounding polymer chain segments. Plasticization of the polymers resulted in narrower distribution of rate constants. The distribution of rate constants seemed to have a low-rate tail that was more pronounced for azobenzenes that were attached more closely to the polymer backbone. Physical ageing of the copolymers had only a small influence on the thermal isomerization that depended on the length of the azobenzene side chain...|$|E
