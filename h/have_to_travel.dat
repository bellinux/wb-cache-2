5|$|In 2010 the Crusaders had a {{very good}} start to the season before a poor finish with three losses in four games caused them to <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>travel</b> to Orlando Stadium, Soweto to face the Bulls. They lost the semi-final 39–24.|$|E
5|$|By Sept. 2, 1871, Polaris {{had reached}} her furthest north of 82°29'N. Tension flared {{again as the}} three leading {{officers}} could not agree on whether to proceed further or not. Hall and Tyson wanted to press north, to cut down the distance they would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>travel</b> to the Pole by dogsled. Budington {{did not want to}} further risk the ship, and walked out on the discussion. In the end, they sailed into Thank God Harbor (now called Hall Bay) on Sept. 10, 1871, and anchored for the winter on the shore of northern Greenland.|$|E
5|$|After {{entering}} Middlesex County, Route 18 continues {{north as}} a freeway, entering Old Bridge Township. After interchanging with U.S. Route 9 (exit 30), the freeway ends, and the route becomes an arterial highway through a mostly wooded commercial stretch of Old Bridge. The route crosses several roads in this area. It then passes under County Route 516 and County Route 527 (Old Bridge-Matawan Road), {{but has no}} northbound interchange to connect with them; motorists <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>travel</b> through a residential area to access these roads. On the southbound side, motorists can use a cloverleaf or Englishtown Road. Route 18 then enters East Brunswick, then interchanging with Middlesex County Route 615, which also connects to County Route 527.|$|E
50|$|At {{the start}} of the leg, teams <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>travel</b> <b>to</b> their next {{destination}} city: Bangkok, Thailand. Upon arrival, they <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>travel</b> <b>to</b> Mo Chit Bus Terminal and take a bus to Lopburi. Once there, teams made their way to Prang Sam Yot to find their next clue.|$|R
25|$|Traditionally, Nambudiri men wore a cloth {{around the}} waist called a mundu. When they <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>travel,</b> they wore a simple cloth {{around the waist}} called a thorthu (or thortumundu). When they <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>travel,</b> they wore two sets of cloth in {{addition}} known as a vasthram.|$|R
5000|$|In the game, {{the player}} <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>travel</b> <b>to</b> several {{different}} time periods of Earth, using time doors. The periods are the Time of Legends (a mythological period), Pangea (about 300 to 250 million years ago), B.C. (1423, [...] "before {{the dawn of}} civilization"), A.D. (1990), and the Aftermath (after 2112). The player also <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>travel</b> <b>to</b> space, where all the planets {{in the solar system}} can be visited.|$|R
5|$|Nike Zeus was {{originally}} {{intended to be a}} straightforward development of the earlier Hercules system giving it the ability to hit ICBM warheads at about the same range and altitude as the maximum performance of the Hercules. In theory, hitting a warhead is no more difficult than an aircraft; the interceptor does not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>travel</b> any further or faster, the computers that guide it simply have to select an intercept point farther in front of the target to compensate for the target's much higher speed. In practice, the difficulty is detecting the target early enough that the intercept point is still within range of the missile. This demands much larger and more powerful radar systems, and faster computers.|$|E
5|$|Spain {{discouraged}} {{manufacturing in}} its colonies and limited trade to Spanish goods handled by Spanish merchants and carried on Spanish vessels. Most of the ports, including {{all of those}} in Texas, were closed to commercial vessels {{in the hopes of}} dissuading smugglers. By law, all goods bound for Texas had to be shipped to Veracruz and then transported over the mountains to Mexico City before being sent to Texas. This caused the goods to be very expensive in the Texas settlements. Settlers were often forced to turn to the French for supplies, as the fort at Natchitoches was well-stocked and goods did not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>travel</b> as far. Without many goods to trade, however, the remaining Spanish missionaries and colonists had little to offer the Indians, who remained loyal to the French traders.|$|E
5|$|The BSAC {{established}} two forts to the north-west of Algoa in 1900, then a boma at Feira in 1902, bringing Mashukulumbwe under Company control. Harrison Clark {{said that}} his concessions gave him authority over the area and demanded that the Company pay him for them. The BSAC said Clark's documents were illegal and refused to deal with him. It offered him compensation, the form of which differs by source; Brelsford {{and a man who}} knew Clark personally during the 1920s, Colonel NO Earl Spurr, say that he was given farms as compensation, while a 1920s business acquaintance, AM Bentley, writes that the Company promised grants of land and the right to reserve some mining claims. Clark reluctantly accepted the compensation when he realised that to challenge the BSAC he would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>travel</b> a great distance, possibly to England, and invest heavily in a court case he would probably lose.|$|E
5|$|In {{cultural}} terms, telecommunication {{has increased}} the public's ability to access music and film. With television, people can watch films they have not seen before {{in their own home}} without <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>travel</b> <b>to</b> the video store or cinema. With radio and the Internet, people can listen <b>to</b> music they <b>have</b> not heard before without <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>travel</b> <b>to</b> the music store.|$|R

5|$|The Halifaxes and Horsas {{were moved}} to RAF Portreath in Cornwall, to shorten the {{distance}} they would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>travel.</b> Even so, they were left with a ten-hour flight to Sale airport in Morocco. On arrival at Sale the gliders were released to land on a sand-patch alongside the runway. Once on the ground each Horsa was fitted with the spare landing gear it carried inside, and the flight immediately took off again on the next leg of the journey, to Mascara in Algeria. Their journey did not end here; they left for the final destination, Kairouan Airfield in Tunisia, as soon as possible. During the flight the gliders were provided with three pilots, who had to change around every hour to relieve fatigue.|$|E
5|$|Around 9,000 years ago, {{the climate}} warmed, melting {{much of the}} polar ice caps and many glaciers, {{creating}} a wetter environment and submerging half the peninsular shelf. As Paleo-Indians now did not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>travel</b> as far to find water, their camps became more permanent, turning into villages. With evidence {{of a wide variety}} of tools constructed around this time, archeologists note the transition into Archaic people. The Archaic people made tools from bone, animal teeth, and antlers. They wove fibers from plants such as cabbage palms and saw palmettos. A few burial sites have been excavated—including the Windover Archaeological Site in Brevard County near Titusville—that provide evidence of burial rituals. Archaic peoples interred their dead in shallow peat marshes, which preserved much of the human tissue. Further climate change between 5,000 and 3,000 years ago led to the Middle Archaic period; evidence suggests that human habitation near the St. Johns River first occurred during this era. Populations of indigenous people increased significantly at this time, and numerous settlements near the St. Johns have been recorded from this era; the banks of the St. Johns and its arteries are dotted with middens filled with thousands of shells, primarily those of Viviparus georgianus—a freshwater snail—and oysters.|$|E
5|$|Based {{around the}} {{overflow}} of volunteers for the 1st Rhodesia Regiment, {{a core of}} personnel for a second Southern Rhodesian expeditionary unit was in place by November 1914. This was made into the 2nd Rhodesia Regiment (2RR) during December 1914 and January 1915. The 1st Rhodesia Regiment's lack of combat experience thus far influenced those men in Southern Rhodesia who were yet to enlist; many Rhodesian colonials were keen to fight on the front lines, and some resolved that they might <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>travel</b> to Europe {{to be sure of}} doing so. Aware of this competition with the Western Front for the colony's manpower, recruiters for the 2nd Rhodesia Regiment took great care to assure potential inductees that they would definitely see combat, in Africa, if they signed up for the new unit. The 2nd Rhodesia Regiment ultimately had a paper strength of 500 men, the same as the 1st. Thirty black scouts, recruited in Southern Rhodesia, were also attached to the regiment.|$|E

5000|$|In this Leg's Roadblock, {{one team}} member <b>had</b> <b>to</b> skydive 233 metres from the Macau Tower. In this Leg's Detour, teams <b>had</b> <b>to</b> choose between Pensler (Brushes) or Pinner (Sticks). In Pensler, teams <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>travel</b> <b>to</b> the Ruins of St. Paul where they <b>had</b> <b>to</b> learn to write [...] "The Amazing Race" [...] in Chinese {{characters}} using a brush. In Pinner, teams <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>travel</b> <b>to</b> the Senado Square where they <b>had</b> <b>to</b> transfer noodles, beans, and tofu to new plates using chopsticks.|$|R

In Through the Sight, teams <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>travel</b> <b>to</b> Valley Gun Club and shoot to six Flying Discs. In this Roadblock, one team member <b>had</b> <b>to</b> make a fast lap of two minutes into the Killarney Race Track.|$|R
5|$|Eruptive {{activity}} in the Mount Cayley volcanic field is typical of past volcanism elsewhere in the Garibaldi Belt. Large earthquakes would occur under the volcanic field weeks to years in advance as molten rock intrudes through the Earth's rocky lithosphere. The extent of earthquakes and the local seismographs in this region would warn the Geological Survey of Canada and possibly cause an upgrade in monitoring. While molten rock breaks through the crust, {{the size of the}} volcano vulnerable to an eruption would probably swell and the area would rupture, creating much more hydrothermal activity at the regional hot springs and the formation of new springs or fumaroles. Small and probably significant rock avalanches may result and could dam the nearby Squamish River for a limited amount of time, such as those that occurred in the past without seismic activity and deformation related to magmatic activity. At some point the subsurface magma will produce phreatic eruptions and lahars. At this time Highway 99 would be out of service and the residents of Squamish would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>travel</b> away from the eruptive zone.|$|E
5|$|Glee club {{director}} Will Schuester {{is informed}} that the school budget will not cover a handicap-accessible bus to transport the glee club to sectionals, which means that Artie Abrams (Kevin McHale) will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>travel</b> separately {{from the rest of}} the club. Will encourages the other club members to support Artie, not only by holding a bake sale to raise funds for a handicap bus, but also by spending time in wheelchairs to experience what life is like for him. Meanwhile, Quinn Fabray (Dianna Agron) is struggling to cover the medical expenses of her pregnancy, and threatens to break up with Finn Hudson (Cory Monteith) if he cannot pay her ultrasound bill. Puck (Mark Salling) fights with Finn, whom he feels is not doing enough to support Quinn. By including cannabis in the cupcakes, Puck ensures the bake sale is a success and offers Quinn the money raised. She apologizes for previously calling him a loser, but refuses to accept the money, and is relieved when Finn is able to find a job.|$|E
5|$|On paper, the edict ordered {{expulsion}} {{rather than}} a forced conversion, but it forbade nearly all possible destinations; in reality, the Castilian authorities preferred Muslims to convert than emigrate. Castile's western neighbor Portugal had already banned Muslims since 1497. The order explicitly forbade going to other neighboring regions, such as the Kingdoms of Aragon and Valencia, the Principality of Catalonia, and the Kingdom of Navarre. Of possible overseas destination, North Africa and territories of the Ottoman Empire were also ruled out. The edict allowed travel to Egypt, then ruled by the Mamluk Sultanate, but there were few ships sailing between Castile and Egypt in those days. It designated Biscay in the Basque country as the only port where the Muslims could depart, which meant that those from the south (such as Andalusia) would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>travel</b> {{the entire length of}} the peninsula. The edict also set the end of April 1502 as the deadline, after which Islam would become outlawed and those harboring Muslims would be punished severely. A further edict issued on 17 September 1502 forbade the newly converted Muslims to leave Castile within the next two years.|$|E

5|$|Whilst Tommy {{is under}} day-release, Toshiko (Naoko Mori) elects {{to keep him}} company. Whilst Toshiko spends time with Tommy, Jack (John Barrowman) and Gwen (Eve Myles) {{discover}} that the abandoned Cardiff hospital is showing signs of time distortion, with elements of the 1918 hospital appearing in the present. Meanwhile, Toshiko and Tommy grow closer; after an afternoon in the pub, he kisses her romantically. Later, Toshiko's colleague Owen (Burn Gorman) realises that Toshiko has developed feelings for Tommy and warns her to be careful as {{he does not want}} her to get hurt. Upon their return, Jack realizes that the present year is when Tommy will be needed: he will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>travel</b> back to 1918 and activate a Rift Key to close the connection between 1918 and the present and prevent disaster. As Tommy is due to be executed for cowardice three weeks after his return to 1918, Tosh initially refuses to let him go back. Jack persuades her of the necessity of Tommy's return.|$|E
