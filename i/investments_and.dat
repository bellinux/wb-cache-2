40|$|There {{are many}} studies that explore the {{connection}} between public <b>investment</b> <b>and</b> their effects on GDP and long run economic growth.

There is a positive long run relationship between public <b>investment</b> <b>and</b> GDP in all countries.

Her work on the gardens began in 1929 and became the biggest commission of her career. It was very fortuitously timed for her, as the Wall Street Crash of 1929 wiped out the fortunes of many of her clients and brought to an end the era of commissioning elaborate gardens for large country estates. Coffin had somewhat better luck with her <b>investments</b> <b>and</b> the enormous fortune of the du Ponts insulated the family from the worst of the Great Depression, permitting work on Winterthur to continue throughout the downturn.

We propose an explanation for these empirical findings, based on time-varying risk, i. e. stochastic volatility. In our model, firms finance investments using defaultable debt as well as equity issuance, and {{they are subject to}} standard profitability shocks as well as shocks to volatility. An increase in volatility leads to an increase in the probability of default and hence the credit spread, while reducing <b>investment</b> <b>and</b> increasing equity value. This shock hence generates a negative correlation between <b>investment</b> <b>and</b> credit spreads, <b>and</b> between <b>investment</b> <b>and</b> Q, helping the model match the data...|$|R

Thomas Wallace graduated in law, but never practised law. He owned some income-generating property, but bad <b>investments</b> <b>and</b> failed business ventures resulted in a steady deterioration of the family's financial position. His mother was from a middle-class English family from Hertford, north of London. When Wallace was five years old, his family moved to Hertford.

40|$|The {{presence}} of growth {{options in the}} value of the firm generates variability in firm value that is not driven by current cash flows. This variability di-minishes the correlation between <b>investment</b> <b>and</b> Tobin’s Q, while maintaining a positive correlation between <b>investment</b> <b>and</b> cash flow. By simulating the model, we show that there is also a high frequency negative relation between <b>investment</b> <b>and</b> cash flow shocks that can reverse these effects. Time aggrega-tion, however, restores the weak relationship between <b>investment</b> <b>and</b> Q, and a strong positive association between <b>investment</b> <b>and</b> cash flow, consistent with that found in empirical studies. Growth options also generate excess volatility of firm value relative to cash flows, similar to findings documented by Shiller (1981) and West (1988). ∗We thank Debbie Lucas for helpful suggestions. †Preliminary; please do not quote without permission. ...|$|R
