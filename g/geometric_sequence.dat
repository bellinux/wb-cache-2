Keywords: Sequences, Cross-Correlations, Partial Period Correlations, <b>Geometric</b> <b>Sequences,</b> Expectation and Variance. I Introduction In order for binary sequences to be usable in CDMA communication systems, {{it is essential that}} their partial period cross-correlation values be provably low, yet there are few such results (see [5] and [8] for surveys of known results up to 1985). In this paper we give explicit partial period cross-correlation estimates for certain pairs of binary pseudorandom <b>sequences,</b> <b>geometric</b> <b>sequences</b> whose underlying m-sequences are related by a linear decimation.
