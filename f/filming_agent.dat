40|$|Key words: Molecular film {{displacement}},enhanced oil recovery, oil displacement mechanism absorption and desorption, spontaneous imbibition diffusion. Abstract. Molecular film displacement {{is a new}} nanofilm EOR technique. A {{large number}} of experiments show that the mechanism of molecular film displacement is different from conventional chemical displacement (polymer, surfactant, alkali and ASP displacement etc). With water solution acting as transfer medium, molecules of the <b>filming</b> <b>agent</b> develop the force to form films through electrostatic interaction, with efficient molecules deposited on the negatively charged rock surface to form ultrathin films at nanometer scale. This change the properties of reservoir surface and the interaction condition with crude oil, making the oil easily be displaced as the pores swept by the injected fluid. Thus oil recovery is enhanced. The mechanism of molecular <b>filming</b> <b>agent</b> mainly includes absorption, wettability alteration, diffusion and capillary imbibition etc...|$|E

40|$|Formation {{behavior}} of PEO (Plasma Electrolytic Oxidation) films on AZ 31 Mg alloy was studied in aqueous solutions containing various concentrations of hydroxide ion (OH−) and silicate ion (SiO 3 2 −) by voltage-time curves, and corrosion {{resistance of the}} PEO film-covered specimen was investigated by immersion test in 0. 5 M NaCl solution. From the analyses of the voltage-time curves, {{it is suggested that}} two different types of anions are essentially needed for the formation of PEO films on AZ 31 Mg alloy: <b>film</b> formation <b>agent</b> and local <b>film</b> breakdown <b>agent.</b> SiO 3 2 − ion acts only as a <b>film</b> formation <b>agent</b> but OH- ion acts not only as a <b>film</b> formation <b>agent</b> but also <b>film</b> breakdown <b>agent.</b> The PEO <b>films</b> prepared on AZ 31 Mg alloy in alkaline silicate solution showed very good corrosion resistance without any pitting or filiform corrosions up to 480 h of immersion in 0. 5 M NaCl...|$|R
