5|$|Edinburgh {{had emerged}} as the capital <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fifteenth</b> century. It was the wealthiest and largest city in the kingdom and held the central law courts, {{parliament}} and royal residence at Holyrood Palace. After James VI left for London at the Union of Crowns in 1603, it continued to be the centre of government. Even after the Acts of Union in 1707 removed the parliament, it retained the exchequer and law courts.|$|E

5|$|One {{effect of}} Jagiello's {{measures}} {{was to be}} the advancement of Catholics in Lithuania at the expense of Orthodox elements; in 1387 and 1413, for example, Lithuanian Catholic boyars were granted special judicial and political privileges denied to the Orthodox boyars. As this process gained momentum, it was accompanied by the rise of both Rus' and Lithuanian identity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fifteenth</b> century.|$|E
5|$|Strand Inn, {{also called}} Chester Inn, was the {{shortest}} lived of the Inns of Chancery. Founded <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fifteenth</b> century it was pulled {{down in the}} 1540s by Lord Somerset {{in his role as}} Lord Protector so that he could build Somerset House. The students instead went to New Inn, and Strand Inn was absorbed into that Inn. Thomas Occleve was said to have studied at Strand Inn.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>fifteenth</b> century {{continental}} {{builders are}} known to have been working in Scotland. French master-mason John Morrow was employed at the building of Glasgow Cathedral and the rebuilding of Melrose Abbey, both considered fine examples of Gothic architecture. Compared with after the Reformation, the interiors of churches were often elaborate, with highly decorated sacrament houses, like the ones surviving at Deskford and Kinkell. The carvings at Rosslyn Chapel, depicting the progression of the seven deadly sins, were created in the mid-fifteenth century. They are considered some of the finest in the Gothic style. Late Medieval Scottish churches also often contained elaborate burial monuments, like the Douglas tombs in the town of Douglas.|$|E
40|$|The Late Middle Ages {{witnessed}} {{a change of}} perception regarding some health practices performed mostly by women. These practices, condemned over centuries by both ecclesiastical and secular elites, would acquire gradually a heretical and diabolical nature giving birth {{to the image of}} <b>the</b> witch <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early <b>fifteenth</b> century. <b>The</b> steps of this change are perceptible through the Catalan documentation; wich allows us to present a development that connects the actions against folk magic <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fourteenth century, the first witchcraft accusations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early <b>fifteenth</b> and <b>the</b> great persecutions <b>in</b> modern times...|$|R

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>fifteenth</b> century {{under the}} Stewart Dynasty, despite a {{turbulent}} political history, the crown gained greater political {{control at the}} expense of independent lords and regained most of its lost territory to approximately the modern borders of the country.

5|$|In the italic, the {{expansive}} ascenders of Tagliente's type were shortened and the curl {{to the right}} replaced with more conventional serifs. Monotype also cut italic capitals sloped to match the lower-case, whereas in the Renaissance italics were used with upright capital letters in the Roman inscriptional tradition. The bold (Monotype's invention, since Griffo and his contemporaries did not use bold type) is extremely solid, providing a very clear contrast to the regular styles, and Monotype also added lining (upper-case height) figures {{as well as the}} text figures (at lower-case height) used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fifteenth</b> and sixteenth centuries.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} Middle Ages the {{problems}} of schism in the Catholic Church allowed the Scottish Crown to gain greater influence over senior appointments and two archbishoprics had been established {{by the end of}} the fifteenth century. Historians have discerned a decline in traditional monastic life in the late Middle Ages, but the mendicant orders of friars grew, particularly in the expanding burghs, emphasised preaching and ministering to the population. New saints and cults of devotion also proliferated. Despite problems over the number and quality of clergy after the Black Death in the fourteenth century, and evidence of heresy <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fifteenth</b> century, the Church in Scotland remained stable before the Reformation in the sixteenth century.|$|E

5|$|Little {{is known}} of Æthelberht's life or reign, as very few East Anglian records have survived from this period. Mediaeval chroniclers have {{provided}} dubious accounts of his life, {{in the absence of}} any real details. According to Richard of Cirencester, writing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fifteenth</b> century, Æthelberht's parents were Æthelred I of East Anglia and Leofrana of Mercia. Richard narrates in detail a story of Æthelberht's piety, election as king and wise rule. Urged to marry against his will, he apparently agreed to wed Eadburh, the daughter of Offa of Mercia, and set out to visit her, despite his mother's forebodings and his experiences of terrifying events (an earthquake, a solar eclipse and a vision).|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{written record}} of Crewkerne {{is in the}} 899 will of Alfred the Great who left it to his youngest son Aethelweard. After the Norman conquest it was held by William the Conqueror and in the Domesday Survey of 1086 {{was described as a}} royal manor. Crewkerne Castle was possibly a Norman motte castle. The town grew up in the late mediaeval period around the textile industry, its wealth preserved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fifteenth</b> century Church of St Bartholomew. During the 18th and 19th centuries the main industry was cloth making, including webbing, and sails for the Royal Navy.|$|E
5|$|The word afternoon, which {{derives from}} after and noon, has been attested from {{about the year}} 1300; Middle English {{contained}} both afternoon and the synonym aftermete. The standard locative marking for the word was at afternoon <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fifteenth</b> and sixteenth centuries but has shifted to in the afternoon since then. In Southern U.S. and Midland American English, the word evening is sometimes used to encompass all times between noon and night. The Irish language contains four different words to mark time intervals from late afternoon to nightfall, this period being considered mystical. Metaphorically, the word afternoon refers to a relatively late period in the expanse of time or in one's life.|$|E

25|$|Polyphonic votive antiphons emerged <b>in</b> England <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{fourteenth century}} as a setting of a text honouring the Virgin Mary, but {{separate}} from the mass and office, often performed after compline. Towards the end of <b>the</b> <b>fifteenth</b> century they began to be written by English composers as expanded settings {{for as many as}} nine parts with increasing complexity and vocal range. The largest collection of such antiphons is <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late <b>fifteenth</b> century Eton choirbook.|$|R
5|$|A {{major source}} of income was the export of wool. However, the fourteenth century saw a change in fortunes: the Black Death, a {{worsening}} economic climate and poor administration left the abbey (like many others of its order) with sharply declining numbers of monks and saddled with major debt. The internal discipline and morals of the community declined too: in 1400–01 it was reported to the government that the abbot of Cleeve and three other monks were leading a group of 200 bandits and attacking travellers in the region. However, things improved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fifteenth</b> century and despite the vast expense caused by the extravagant building projects of the last abbots, better management, access to new resources (for instance from the profits from the right to hold markets granted by the crown) and a general improvement in the circumstances facing the house meant that {{just prior to the}} dissolution Cleeve was enjoying an Indian Summer of comfortable stability.|$|E
5|$|Alex {{was born}} on July 18, 1992. She grew up in Oakland, California, with her parents Michael and Sita. Her father was an {{alcoholic}} and physically abusive towards his wife. When Alex was in her pre-teenage years, Michael was killed during a violent episode against Sita. The police declined to press charges, unaware that Alex was responsible for Michael's death. Alex was then sent to live with Sita's family in Mumbai, India. Alex returned to the United States, where she enrolled at the FBI Academy in 2015. Unknown to the Bureau, Alex had discovered that {{her father was a}} former FBI agent and had applied to learn more about his past. Alex kept her activities a secret from Sita, telling her mother that she was starting graduate school.

5|$|Arable farming {{grew in the}} High Middle Ages and {{agriculture}} entered a period of relative boom between the thirteenth century and late fifteenth century. Unlike England, Scotland had no towns dating from Roman occupation. From the twelfth century there are records of burghs, chartered towns, which became major centre of crafts and trade. There are also Scottish coins, although English coinage probably remained more significant in trade, and {{until the end of}} the period barter was probably the most common form of exchange. Craft and industry remained relatively undeveloped before the end of the Middle Ages and, although there were extensive trading networks based in Scotland, while the Scots exported largely raw materials, they imported increasing quantities of luxury goods, resulting in a bullion shortage and perhaps helping to create a financial crisis <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fifteenth</b> century.|$|E
50|$|Beggars' badges were badges {{and other}} {{identifying}} insignia worn by beggars beginning <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early <b>fifteenth</b> century <b>in</b> Great Britain and Ireland.

5|$|As no {{description}} of the frieze survives from antiquity and many religious rituals involved secret symbolism and traditions left unspoken, so {{the question of the}} meaning of the sculpture has been a persistent and unresolved one. The first published attempt at interpretation belongs to Cyriac of Ancona <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fifteenth</b> century AD who referred to it as the “victories of Athens in the time of Pericles”. What is now the more accepted view of the piece, however, namely that it depicts the Greater Panathenaic procession from the Leokoreion by the Dipylon gate, to the Acropolis, was mooted by Stuart and Revett in the second volume of their Antiquities of Athens, 1787. Subsequent interpretations have built largely on this theory, even if they disallow that a temple sculpture could represent a contemporary event rather than a mythological or historical one. It has only been in recent years that an alternative thesis in which the frieze depicts the founding myth of the city of Athens instead of the festival pompe has emerged.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of this period the boundaries of Alba contained only a small proportion of modern Scotland. Even when these lands were added to in the tenth and eleventh centuries, the term Scotia was applied in sources only to the region between the River Forth, the central Grampians and the River Spey and only began to be used to describe all of the lands under the authority of the Scottish crown from {{the second half of the}} twelfth century. By the late thirteenth century when the Treaty of York (1237) and Treaty of Perth (1266) had fixed the boundaries with the Kingdom of the Scots with England and Norway respectively, its borders were close to the modern boundaries. After this time both Berwick and the Isle of Man were lost to England, and Orkney and Shetland were gained from Norway <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fifteenth</b> century.|$|E
5|$|From {{the end of}} the {{eleventh}} century universities had been founded across Europe, developing as semi-autonomous centres of learning, often teaching theology, mathematics, law and medicine. By the fifteenth century, beginning in northern Italy, universities had become strongly influenced by Humanist thinking. This put an emphasis on classical authors, questioned some of the accepted certainties of established thinking and manifested itself in the teaching of new subjects, particularly through the medium of the Greek language. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>fifteenth</b> century university colleges had been founded at St John's College, St Andrews (1418) and St Salvator's College was added in 1450. Glasgow was founded in 1451 and King's College, Aberdeen in 1495. St Leonard's College was added at St. Andrews in 1511. Initially, they were designed for the training of clerics, but they would increasingly be used by laymen who began to challenge the clerical monopoly of administrative posts in government and law.|$|E
