5|$|The {{potential}} impact of thiomersal on autism has been investigated extensively. Multiple lines of scientific evidence have shown that thiomersal does not cause autism. For example, the clinical symptoms of mercury poisoning differ significantly from those of autism. In addition, multiple population studies have found no association between thiomersal and autism, and rates of autism have continued to increase despite removal of thiomersal from vaccines. Thus, major scientific and medical bodies such as the Institute of Medicine and World Health Organization (WHO) as well as <b>governmental</b> <b>agencies</b> such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the CDC reject any role for thiomersal in autism or other neurodevelopmental disorders. In spite of the consensus of the scientific community, some parents and advocacy groups continue to contend that thiomersal is linked to autism.|$|E
5|$|This {{subfield}} {{of sociology}} studies, broadly, {{the dynamics of}} war, conflict resolution, peace movements, war refugees, conflict resolution and military institutions. As a subset of this subfield, military sociology aims towards the systematic study of the military as a social group {{rather than as an}} organization. It is a highly specialized sub-field which examines issues related to service personnel as a distinct group with coerced collective action based on shared interests linked to survival in vocation and combat, with purposes and values that are more defined and narrow than within civil society. Military sociology also concerns civilian-military relations and interactions between other groups or <b>governmental</b> <b>agencies.</b> Topics include the dominant assumptions held by those in the military, changes in military members' willingness to fight, military unionization, military professionalism, the increased utilization of women, the military industrial-academic complex, the military's dependence on research, and the institutional and organizational structure of military.|$|E
5|$|The course {{focuses on}} the {{strategic}} and political aspects of war and educationally prepares students for assignments as strategic leaders. The academic year runs from late June through late May. The ASLSP curriculum provides a comprehensive, multifaceted focus at the theater-strategic level across the spectrum of Joint and land force operations during peace, crisis, and war. The program includes classroom studies of strategy, regional studies, joint operations, strategic leadership, and twentieth-century conflict. Students also research and write a publishable-quality monograph of 10,000- 12,000 words on a suitable subject. ASLSP includes an extensive field studies program, with approximately eight weeks of TDY, to reinforce and expand classroom studies and meet with senior leaders across JIIM organizations. Field Studies include interactions with several agencies in the National Capital Region, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and CONUS-based combatant commands, and visits to various military and civilian <b>governmental</b> <b>agencies.</b> Normally, six US Army officers and the USMC, Canadian, and German officers remain for a second year to serve as seminar leaders as seminar leaders in the AMSP course, while one US Army officer joins {{the faculty of the}} ASLSP as the military faculty member. Graduates typically serve in a follow-on command assignment or work for a three- or four-star general officer as a member of his or her staff.|$|E

5|$|According to Russian {{psychiatrist}} Emmanuil Gushansky, psychiatry is {{the only}} medical specialty in which the doctor is given the right to violence {{for the benefit of}} the patient. The application of violence must be based on the mental health law, must be as much as possible transparent and monitored by representatives of the interests of persons who are in need of involuntary examination and treatment. While being hospitalized in a psychiatric hospital for urgent indications, the patient should be accompanied by his relatives, witnesses, or other persons authorized to control the actions of doctors and law-enforcement agencies. Otherwise, psychiatry becomes an obedient maid for administrative and <b>governmental</b> <b>agencies</b> and is deprived of its medical function. It is the police that must come to the aid of citizens and is responsible for their security. Only later, after the appropriate legal measures for social protection have been taken, the psychiatrist must respond to the queries of law enforcement and judicial authorities by solving the issues of involuntary hospitalization, sanity, etc. In Russia, all that goes by opposites. The psychiatrist is vested with punitive functions, is involved in involuntary hospitalization, the state machine hides behind his back, actually manipulating the doctor. The police are reluctant to investigate offences committed by the mentally ill. After receiving the information about their disease, the bodies of inquiry very often stop the investigation and do not bring it to the level of investigative actions. Thereby psychiatry becomes a cloak for the course of justice and, by doing so, serves as a source for the rightlessness and stigmatization of both psychiatrists and persons with mental disorders. The negative attitude to psychiatrists is thereby supported by the state machine and is accompanied by the aggression against the doctors, which increases during the periods of social unrest.|$|E
