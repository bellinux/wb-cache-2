50|$|Falls {{in older}} adults are a {{significant}} cause {{of morbidity and mortality}} and are an important class of preventable injuries. The cause of falling in old age is often multifactorial, and may require a multidisciplinary approach both to treat any injuries sustained and to prevent future <b>falls.</b> <b>Falls</b> include dropping from a standing position, or from exposed positions such as those on ladders or stepladders. The severity of injury is generally related to the height of the fall. The state of the ground surface onto which the victim falls is also important, harder surfaces causing more severe injury. Falls can be prevented by ensuring that carpets are tacked down, that objects like electric cords are not in one's path, that hearing and vision are optimized, dizziness is minimized, alcohol intake is moderated and that shoes have low heels or rubber soles.|$|E
50|$|The University of Washington School of Drama traces {{its origins}} to 1919 when Glenn Hughes, a recent {{graduate}} of Stanford University, joined {{the faculty of}} the Department of Dramatic Art, a part of the English Department. Though he came to the University of Washington as a poetry fellow, Hughes soon became determined to create a first-rate drama school. From 1930 to 1961 Hughes led the Department, which became the School of Drama (SoD) in 1941. He wrote more than 60 plays; wrote and edited various literary and scholarly publications; launched one of the West Coast’s first foreign film series; and established the drama program as the center of theatrical life in Seattle. Under Hughes’ leadership, the drama program became a center of Seattle’s theatrical life and a respected part of its cultural milieu. In 1961, Hughes retired and was succeeded by Gregory A. <b>Falls.</b> <b>Falls</b> created the Professional Actor Training Program (PATP), a prestigious BFA (now MFA) program that placed the School among the nation’s top professional acting conservatories and initiated the Ph.D. program in theatre history, theory and criticism. It was during this time that the stream of UW drama graduates began pooling in Seattle. Graduates and former faculty stayed in the city, founding their own theatres and forming the genesis of what is today one of the country’s most active and diverse theatre communities.|$|E

40|$|Background: {{the burden}} of falls and fall-related {{injuries}} among older adults is well established. Contention surrounds the effectiveness, and hence value, of multi-component fall prevention interventions delivered in the community. Objective: using consensus-based analytic guidelines rather than time-to-first fall as the primary endpoint, the objective {{was to examine the}} effectiveness of the Whitehorse NoFalls trial on all <b>falls,</b> <b>falls</b> resulting in injury and falls requiring medical care to be sought. Design, setting and participants: the study was a community-based randomised controlled trial, with 1, 090 participants assigned to one of eight groups, these being a combination of one or more of exercise, vision and or home hazard reduction or alternatively assignment to the control group. Methods: using negative binomial regression, the incidence of all <b>falls,</b> <b>falls</b> resulting in injury and those requiring medical care in the intervention groups were examined. Falls were reported using a monthly return calendar. Results: exercise alone and in combination with vision and/or home hazard reduction was associated with fewer falls. For falls resulting in injury and the subset requiring medical care, the vision plus exercise intervention was associated with fewer falls. Conclusions: the findings confirm the effectiveness of exercise in preventing falls among community-dwelling older adult...|$|E
