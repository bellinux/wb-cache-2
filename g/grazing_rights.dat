25|$|From {{as early}} as 1843 {{shepherding}} had been common around Burra, with pastoral pioneers such as James Stein and William Peter being granted <b>grazing</b> <b>rights</b> for their flocks on unsurveyed land. Over {{the life of the}} Burra Mine, most food was brought in as there was no freehold offered by SAMA on the land and no adjoining hundreds were declared until 1860. Agriculture was delayed by the slow surveying of hundreds, as until these had been done there was no freehold or leasehold land but only <b>grazing</b> <b>rights.</b> As Burra lies almost on Goyder's 1865 line it is rated at the edge of marginal land for farming. After mining the town became a pastoral centre, and South Australia's main sheep trading centre until the mid-20th century. The Baldina Run, a major sheep station of 50 square miles some 10 miles east of Burra, near Kooringa, was established by Henry Ayers in 1851, leased by J and C. B.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{institutional}} {{analysis of the}} grazing lands in Matsheng area, Kgalagadi District in Botswana and {{the purpose is to}} use the Institutional Analysis Development framework (IAD) in order to examine how the institutional arrangements affect the probability for cattle owners to successfully govern the grazing land. Grazing land is what Elinor Ostrom defines as a common pool resource and has been governed as a common property in Botswana. According to Garrett Hardin’s “The tragedy of the commons” this kind of resource and resource management are doomed to fail with the outcome of land degradation. Instead Hardin suggests that common property could be changed into either private or state owned property. This argument led to the implementation of the Tribal Grazing Land Policy in 1975. All land was zoned into three different areas: reserved land, commercial land, and communal land. Dividing the areas was assumed to relieve the grazing pressure in the communal lands. The government stressed that the traditional system of land tenure was structured {{in such a way that}} individuals lacked the incentives to conserve the common grazing land. The policy’s objectives were to stop degradation, promote economic equality and increase commercialization in the livestock industry. However, none of the policies objectives has been realized. Ostrom has a more optimistic view to common property and common pool resources and she believes that it is possible to overcome the “tragedy of the commons”. Ostrom had developed three sets of contextual variables that determine whether a resource will be used in a sustainable way or not. These three sets of variables: institutional arrangements, the physical attributes of the resource, and the attributes of the community are brought under the name “Institutional Analysis and Development Framework”, IAD. I have analyzed several factors by doing interviews with cattle owners in Hukuntsi and Lehututu and by using secondary data. I have found that the present resource management in Matsheng is not sustainable! The skewed income variance, the lack of indicators, and the ongoing degradation of water and land, are few factors that hinder cattle owners from investing in resource management. Also, the dual <b>grazing</b> <b>right</b> make few wealthy cattle owners benefit disproportionately which is maybe the greatest obstacle for a sustainable grazing management. Therefore, the government of Botswana needs to cancel the dual <b>grazing</b> <b>right</b> and help cattle owners to take good decisions by providing them information about the water and grazing condition.

25|$|King's Sedgemoor Drain is an {{artificial}} drainage channel which diverts the River Cary in Somerset, England {{along the southern}} flank of the Polden Hills, to discharge into the River Parrett at Dunball near Bridgwater.

There was opposition to drainage schemes from the local inhabitants, who feared that they would lose their common <b>grazing</b> <b>rights.</b> However, the main channel was constructed between 1791 and 1795, and despite some defects, brought some relief from flooding to the area.|$|E

But, Quanah changed his position and forged close relationships with a number of Texas cattlemen, such as Charles Goodnight and the Burnett family. As early as 1880, Quanah was working with these new associates in building his own herds. In 1884, due largely to Quanah’s efforts, the tribes received their first “grass” payments for <b>grazing</b> <b>rights</b> on Comanche, Kiowa and Apache lands.

25|$|Wilderness {{designation}} {{was opposed}} by the Oregon Cattleman's Association and a non-profit group devoted to trail access for OHVs. Among the groups that supported wilderness designation were the Oregon Natural Desert Association (ONDA), the Bend city commissioners, and a rancher named Ray Clarno, who held a grazing permit within the proposed wilderness area. Clarno, alleging that off-road riders cut his fences and left cattle gates open, promised to retire his <b>grazing</b> <b>rights</b> if OHVs were barred from the area. He followed through on this promise in 2005, when the BLM banned OHVs from the Badlands. ONDA estimated the cost of buying out grazing permits from {{a total of four}} affected ranchers at about $100,000.|$|E

Some full-blood Lakota complained {{of having been}} marginalized {{since the start of}} the reservation system. Most did not bother to participate in tribal elections, which led to tensions on all sides. There had been increasing violence on the reservation, which many attributed to Wilson's private militia, Guardians of the Oglala Nation (informally called the GOONs), attacking political opponents to suppress opposition.|$|E

40|$|The {{reindeer}} {{are kept}} in extensive pasture systems where the conditions {{are similar to those}} for wild reindeer. Since the reindeer have special demands on their pasture, it is difficult to keep them in intensive production systems where they cannot graze selectively. Too many reindeer on a small area will also facilitate spread of diseases. A selection program for reindeer needs special qualifications according to several different reasons. The purpose with this literature review is to summarize the factors needed for a reindeer selection program and the problems and possibilities included. Reindeer <b>grazing</b> <b>right</b> has a special meaning to the Sami and are reserved for them according to immemorial rights. Reindeer husbandry cannot be directly compared to the intensive systems of other meat producing animals and there are some additional factors to keep in mind when making a selection program for reindeer. The most important factors are the use of pasture (number of reindeer per area), herd structure (regulated by slaughter) and the genetic progress of each individual, which can be increased by selection. The genetic progress can not be maximized in a reindeer population in practice; predators, food resources and changes in climate and environment from one year to another will slow down the progress. It is important to let the reindeer husbandry remain a Sami right to keep their culture and language. At the same time modern tools to improve production and genetic progress in the herds should be used to keep the possibility to make a living on reindeer husbandry...|$|R
