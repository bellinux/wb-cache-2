5|$|However, {{the same}} {{processes}} that create hoodoos will also eventually destroy them. In {{the case of}} Bryce Canyon, the hoodoos' rate of erosion is 24feet (0.61.3m) every 100 years. As the canyon continues to erode to the west it will eventually capture (in perhaps 3 million years) the watershed of the East Fork of the Sevier River. Once this river flows through Bryce Amphitheater it will dominate the erosional pattern; replacing hoodoos with a V-shaped canyon and steep cliff walls typical of the weathering and erosional patterns created by rivers. A foreshadowing {{of this can be}} observed in Water Canyon while hiking the Mossy Cave Trail. A <b>diversion</b> <b>canal</b> has been taking a portion of the East Fork of the Sevier River through this section of the park for over 100 years.|$|E
25|$|The Canal du Midi {{still had}} {{shortcomings}} {{because it did}} not pass through Carcassonne nor Narbonne and did not join the Rhône. In addition, to reach Bordeaux, it was necessary to take the Garonne which has variable flow rates and violent floods. The Canal de Jonction or 'junction canal', built in 1776, gave access to Narbonne via the Canal de la Robine de Narbonne. The same year the Canal de Brienne allowed the bypass of Bazacle - the ford on the Garonne in Toulouse which blocked the river. The connection between the étang de Thau and the Rhone was also completed in 1808. In 1810 a <b>diversion</b> <b>canal</b> allowed Carcassonne to be connected. Finally in 1857 the Canal latéral à la Garonne was opened between Toulouse and Castets-en-Dorthe, completing the link between the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea that Riquet had dreamt of.|$|E

The published article is copyrighted by Springer {{and can be found}} at: [URL] hydropower plants divert part of the water from wide and physically complex stream channels with active hyporheic areas to narrow and hydraulically simple concrete canals, and thus, might affect nutrient dynamics. We compared nutrient uptake in <b>diversion</b> <b>canals</b> and in stream channels in the Leitzaran Stream (Basque Country, northern Spain). We hypothesized that simple morphology in <b>diversion</b> <b>canals</b> will result in lower nutrient uptake in canals than in stream channels. Periphytic chlorophyll and biomass did not differ significantly between reach types. Water was significantly deeper and faster in canals than in stream channels, but the transient storage zone did not differ significantly between reach types. There {{were no significant differences between}} uptake length for neither phosphate nor ammonium between reach types. Uptake length in both stream channels and <b>diversion</b> <b>canals</b> decreased with discharge, in a pattern similar to that previously described for pristine rivers across the world. Uptake velocity and uptake rate for phosphate did not differ significantly between reach types, but in the case of ammonium both retention metrics were significantly larger in the <b>diversion</b> <b>canals.</b> Results suggest that although hydropower schemes have minor effects on nutrient retention, these depend on the proportion of flow diverted...|$|R

500|$|One of the {{earliest}} water projects in the Colorado River basin was the Grand Ditch, a [...] <b>diversion</b> <b>canal</b> that sends water from the Never Summer Mountains, which would naturally have drained into {{the headwaters of the}} Colorado River, to bolster supplies in Colorado's Front Range Urban Corridor. Constructed primarily by Japanese and Mexican laborers, the ditch was considered an engineering marvel when completed in 1890, delivering [...] across the Continental Divide each year. Because roughly 75percent of Colorado's precipitation falls west of the Rocky Mountains while 80percent of the population lives east of the range, more of these interbasin water transfers, locally known as transmountain diversions, followed. While first envisioned in the late 19thcentury, construction on the Colorado-Big Thompson Project (C-BT) did not begin until the 1930s. The C-BT now delivers more than 11 times the Grand Ditch's flow from the Colorado River watershed to cities along the Front Range.|$|E

50|$|Saugers {{generally}} move upstream {{to spawn}} during March-May {{depending on where}} their home locations are. They move downstream to their home locations from April-July after their spawning period is over. Saugers {{have been known to}} travel between 10 and 600 km from their home to spawning location downstream. Habitat at spawning sites are less complex and diverse than home locations. Females prefer rocky substrate and pools to deposit their eggs. As females increase in length, egg quality and fecundity increase. However, it is thought that egg production begins to decline after age 6 in female sauger. Sexual maturity is reached between 2 and 5 years old. Other measures of sexual maturity are related to size. A sauger is considered to be an adult when it reaches 250-300 mm. Upon birth, larval saugers drift downstream before developing feeding tendencies and horizontal maneuverability. Juvenile saugers tend to develop in <b>diversion</b> <b>canals</b> and backwaters until autumn when they migrate upstream to their wintering habitat. Residing in <b>diversion</b> <b>canals</b> is a large source of mortality for juvenile saugers.|$|R

Two river <b>diversion</b> <b>canals</b> 500 m wide by 12 km long will be excavated. The canals would divert water from the main dam to the power plant. Belo Monte will flood a total area of 668 km2.

50|$|Saugers face many {{conservation}} issues {{because of}} migratory barriers, habitat loss, entrainment in irrigation canals, and overexploitation. Dams and <b>diversion</b> <b>canals</b> prevent spawning in upstream habitats. Altering flow regimes in rivers affects turbidity, formation of pools, and temperature. All {{of which are}} important for the timing and success of spawning saugers. Long migrations are the main reason why saugers struggle in dammed or diverted river systems. Low water levels in periods of drought are the most detrimental to sauger populations because it strands eggs during spawning and prevents larval sauger from reaching their downstream locations. High death rates that occur during spawning are related to degraded and fragmented river systems. Mortality rates in autumn are related to exploitation by fishermen.|$|R
