5|$|In {{the twentieth}} century, new {{building}} methods, particularly concrete and steel were used, and the exterior was essentially facing.

5|$|New London has an {{unconventional}} platform layout {{due to the}} State Street grade crossing and its location on a sharp curve.

5|$|A greater misfortune {{occurred}} {{at the onset of}} the southern winter when the Aurora, locked in an ice-floe which broke off from the main shelf, was torn from its moorings. The ocean currents then pulled ship <b>further</b> <b>away</b> from the sledding parties marooned on shore and drifted for over six months before breaking free of the ice. Sadly the Aurora's damaged rudder forced her to return to New Zealand rather than returning for the stranded shore party.|$|E

Friends of Maldives Sports Coordinator and Olympic Olympic rower Guin Batten successfully rowed across the Zero Degree Channel (Addoo Kandu) in the Maldives on 30 March 2010.

40|$|Previous {{evidence}} {{has shown that}} the number of L and M cones in retina varies significantly between subjects. However, {{it is not clear how}} the variation of L/M ratio changes the behavioral performance of the subject. A model of transformation of data from retina to visual cortex for evaluation of various L/M cones ratios is presented. While L/M cone ratios close to 1 brings the best performance for one of postreceptoral (magnocellular) channels, we showed that the performance in the second channel (parvocells) will improve when the ratio <b>furthers</b> <b>away</b> from 1. Effects of different ratios of S were also explored...|$|R

5|$|Although {{the closest}} scattered-disc objects {{approach}} the Sun at about 30–35AU, their orbits can extend well beyond 100AU. This makes scattered objects {{among the most}} distant and coldest objects in the Solar System. The innermost portion of the scattered disc overlaps with a torus-shaped region of orbiting objects traditionally called the Kuiper belt, but its outer limits reach much <b>further</b> <b>away</b> from the Sun and further {{above and below the}} ecliptic than the Kuiper belt proper.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{morphological}} features, the Alexandrine parakeet {{has been}} proposed as the founder population for all Psittacula species on Indian Ocean islands, with new populations settling during the species's southwards colonisation from its native South Asia. Features of that species gradually disappear in species <b>further</b> <b>away</b> from its range. Many endemic Mascarene birds, including the dodo, are descended from South Asian ancestors, and Hume has proposed that this {{may also be the}} case for all the parrots there. Sea levels were lower during the Pleistocene, so it was possible for species to colonise some of these less isolated islands.|$|E

Car parking is available at the visitor centre and Woodford Lodge, for which a charge is made, and a small amount of parking is available at points around the lake; some of these are restricted to those with fishing permits.|$|E

5|$|In fact, {{during the}} 1950s, many {{families}} would intentionally hang gandingans outside their houses so other neighbors could easily hear them play.

5|$|Increased {{traffic in}} the mid-1980s changed the politician's interests, and in 1988 Parliament voted {{to build a new}} main airport at Hurum, located {{on the same side of}} Oslo as Fornebu, but <b>further</b> <b>away.</b> However, new weather data showed that Hurum was unsuitable, and the {{location}} was discarded. There were accusations that the data was fabricated to manipulate the political decision. In 1992, parliament made a final vote that started construction of a new airport at Gardermoen and mandated the closure of Fornebu.|$|E

5|$|Linguistically, BASL {{differs from}} other {{varieties}} of ASL in its phonology, syntax, and vocabulary.

Signers of BASL also tend to prefer two-handed variants of signs, while signers of ASL tend to prefer one-handed variants.

5|$|Marking a {{high point}} in terms of sales, the last-of-the-series VL Commodore sold in record numbers, finally {{managing}} to outsell the Ford Falcon in the private sector. The 1986 VL represented a substantial makeover of the VK and {{would be the last}} of the mid-size Commodores. Designers distanced the Commodore <b>further</b> <b>away</b> from its Opel origins, by smoothing the lines of the outer body and incorporating a subtle tail spoiler. A thorough redesign of the nose saw the Commodore gain sleek, narrow headlamps and a shallower grille, while the Calais specification employed unique partially concealed headlamps.|$|E
