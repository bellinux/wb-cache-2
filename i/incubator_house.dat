40|$|The {{ability to}} {{replicate}} physiological hemodynamic conditions during in vitro tissue {{development has been}} recognized as an important aspect {{in the development and}} in vitro assessment of engineered heart valve tissues. Moreover, we have demonstrated that stud-ies aiming to understand mechanical conditioning require separation of the major heart valve deformation loading modes: flow, stretch, and flexure (FSF) (Sacks et al., 2009, "Bioengineering Challenges for Heart Valve Tissue Engineering, " Annu. Rev. Biomed. Eng., 11 (1), pp. 289 – 313). To achieve these goals in a novel bioreactor design, we uti-lized a cylindrical conduit configuration for the conditioning chamber to allow for higher fluid velocities, translating to higher shear stresses on the in situ tissue specimens while retaining laminar flow conditions. Moving boundary computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations were performed to predict the flow field under combined cyclic flexure and steady flow (cyclic-flex-flow) states using various combinations of flow rate, and media viscosity. The device was successfully constructed and tested for <b>incubator</b> <b>housing,</b> gas exchange, and sterility. In addition, we performed a pilot experiment using biodegradabl...|$|R

40|$|The task is {{to build}} a {{low-cost}} thermostat and design necessary elements to perform a study on water mixed glucose-impedance at different temperatures and cell growth in a temperature-controlled <b>incubator</b> <b>housing</b> a magnetic field of up to 3 mT. The incubator was designed in solidworks and made to fit petri dishes of two relevant sizes and necessary wiring. The coils designed to extend across the large of the incubator with six turns and a 4 A current to yield a sixth of the required magnetic field, as field strength increases linearly with current and turns increasing either of these is advised, and a large enough homogenous field was observed to create a suitable environment for the study. A thermistor, temperature sensitive resistance, was used to get reading and a modified wheatstone bridge was used with a multiplying op-amp to stabilize and improve accuracy of readings. Using an arduino microprocessor utilizing a PID library to calculate the power needed from thermistor readings of ambient temperature and an H-bridge controller by PWM from the Arduino a thermostat capable of driving a peltier-cell was produced capable of raising, lowering and maintaining predefined temperatures. ...|$|R

40|$|Random cell {{migration}} and actin organization in seven human primary, recurrent cutaneous, and metastatic melanoma cell lines were studied by time-lapse video recording and image analysis. The migration of over 800 randomly selected {{cells from the}} cell lines were recorded using an inverted microscope with an attached <b>incubator</b> <b>housing.</b> The fraction of cells with random migration rates greater than 10 microns/hour was 8 % in an established primary melanoma cell line, 2 % and 34 % in two recurrent cutaneous melanoma cell lines, and 5 %, 30 %, 31 %, and 60 % in four metastatic cell lines. The three metastatic cell lines with significantly higher mean migration rates (P less than 0. 001) were derived from lymph node metastases, whereas the fourth metastatic cell line was derived from a visceral metastasis. The cellular morphology and presence of cell nests in the original tissue correlated with in vitro cell morphology {{and the formation of}} colonies. The ability of cells to organize actin into stress fibers directly correlated with significantly higher random migration rates and lack of colony formation. Characterization of random migration rates and actin organization of human melanoma cells that are isolated from different stages of tumor progression may lend insight into metastasis...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to conduct an exploratory study of the information processing utilized by incubator-housed manufacturers during channel member selection. The study included the evaluation of the decision models used by the manufacturers as well as criteria used in the selection process. The study was specifically designed to achieve the following objectives. First, the research was to identify the evaluation modes used by the manufacturers as either compensatory or noncompensatory. Second, the study was to evaluate the effect of the task on the selection of the evaluation model(s) used during the channel member selection process. Third, the study was to evaluate the effect of the selected decision strategy on the amount of information used during the decision process. Finally, the study was to identify and examine the importance of the criteria used by the manufacturers in the selection process. The methodology in this study consisted of primary research using protocol analysis as the main data gathering technique. A ranking instrument was also mailed to the respondents prior to the protocol session. The population for the study was identified as all manufacturers located in publicly-sponsored business incubators. A total of 235 incubators were in existence with approximately 47 percent of them being publicly-sponsored. Approximately 42 percent of the <b>incubators</b> <b>house</b> at least one manufacturing firm. It was estimated that there were approximately 46 manufacturing firms located in public incubators. A sample of six was used in this study. The statistical analysis included frequencies, cross tabulations, correlations, paired comparisons, and measures of association. The findings {{of this study suggest that}} the incubator-housed manufacturers' choice of evaluation models was not affected by the task nor did the selected strategy influence the amount of information used by the manufacturers. The findings indicate a need for further research to evaluate the relationships brought forth in this study.

40|$|During {{the last}} decades, {{creative}} and cultural approaches {{have been implemented}} in regional and urban development strategies as key drivers for competitiveness and growth. However, research literature tends to focus mainly in big cities and metropolis, not recognizing the potential of small cities in intermediate and rural regions in fostering territorial cohesion. Nevertheless, public policies based on creativity and innovation are being experienced in non-metropolitan and rural contexts around Europe, Canada and USA focused on economic revitalisation, urban regeneration and reversing de-population trends. These approaches are mainly based on historic precedents (‘path dependency’), in the exploitation of distinctive local attributes and assets regarding culture, environment, lifestyle and quality of life, besides specific investments in infrastructures or support programmes (such as <b>incubators,</b> live-work <b>houses,</b> and specific financing systems), which intend to induce the attraction of talent {{and the development of}} creative businesses. The main aim of this investigation is to examine the recent approaches to cultural and creative economy that are being implemented by small and medium-sized cities in Europe that still remain largely unstudied. The objective is to establish a typology of creative-based strategies through the analysis of the definitions adopted by regional and local authorities as well as the justifications and planning instruments used that reflect different priority goals or purposes. The paper engages the debate on rural and urban relationships {{as well as on the}} regional interdependencies. It is also stressed the demand for adapting widespread development policies to local specificities and to build up innovative forms of governance for a fully engagement of the local actors at different levels, in search of a competitive but also cohesive society. As a result, it is our intention to contribute to the theoretical thinking about the crucial factors for the sustainability of small local economies in regional development. ...|$|R
