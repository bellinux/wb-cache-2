However, the affinity law calculations require using a point on the curve (hereafter {{referred to as the}} “basic point”) to determine the new speed. Most references regarding the Affinity Laws do not give a clear description of the method for determining the “basic point”, and improper selection of this point can affect the results considerably.

40|$|The {{degradation}} {{in efficiency}} of auxiliary components in heating/cooling systems when operating {{at part load}} is frequently reported. Through the use of variable speed components, the supplied capacity {{can be reduced to}} match the required load and hence reduce unnecessary energy consumption. However, for fan coil units, difficulties can arise when optimizing <b>fan</b> and <b>pump</b> speeds at part load. Practically locating optimal water and air flow rates from readily available information and for varying supplied capacities is necessary, {{in order to reduce the}} fan coil power consumption. This research attempts to identify whether optimal <b>fan</b> and <b>pump</b> speeds exist for a fan coil unit and how they can be implemented, in a practical manner, in a system control applications. Using an empirical <b>fan</b> coil and <b>pump</b> model, the total power consumption (<b>fan</b> and <b>pump)</b> for different combinations of <b>fan</b> and <b>pump</b> speeds over a range of capacities was calculated. It was observed that, for a given capacity, an optimal combination of <b>fan</b> and <b>pump</b> speeds exists and there was a significant change in power consumption for different combinations of <b>fan</b> and <b>pump</b> speeds supplying the same capacity. A control strategy is described that utilizes a simple fan coil capacity estimation model, coupled with air and water flow rates, along with nominal design data. The pump speed is optimized using PID control to maintain the space temperature at the chosen set-point, which matches the supplied capacity to the required capacity. At set-time intervals, the capacity estimation model is utilized to optimize the water and air flow rates for the required capacity. The control strategy is evaluated, using a full building simulation model for a daily load profile and is compared to two baseline conditions: for no control of the fancoils/pump combination and for PID circulation control of the pump only. The optimal <b>fan</b> and <b>pump</b> speed control resulted in a 43 % and 24 % decrease in power consumption with compared to the no control baseline and the PID controlled circulation pump strategy, respectively...|$|R
5000|$|Three-phase {{squirrel-cage}} induction motors {{are widely}} used in industrial drives because they are rugged, reliable and economical. Single-phase induction motors are used extensively for smaller loads, such as household appliances like fans. Although traditionally used in fixed-speed service, induction motors are increasingly being used with variable-frequency drives (VFDs) in variable-speed service. VFDs offer especially important energy savings opportunities for existing and prospective induction motors in variable-torque centrifugal <b>fan,</b> <b>pump</b> and compressor load applications.

50|$|From {{the machine}} chest stock is pumped {{to a head}} tank, {{commonly}} called a head box, whose purpose is to maintain a constant head (pressure) on the stock as it feeds the basis weight valve. The head box also provides a means allowing air bubbles to escape. The basis weight valve meters the stock to the recirculating stream of water that is pumped, by the <b>fan</b> <b>pump,</b> from a whitewater chest through to the flow box. On {{the way to the}} flow box the pulp slurry may pass through centrifugal cleaners, which remove heavy contaminants like sand, and screens, which break up fibre clumps and remove over-sized debris.|$|E
50|$|The {{consistency}} in the flow box is typically under 0.4% for most paper grades, with longer fibres requiring lower consistency than short fibres. Higher consistency causes more fibres to be oriented in the z direction, while lower consistency promotes fibre orientation in the x-y direction. Higher consistency promotes higher calliper (thickness) and stiffness, lower consistency promotes higher tensile and some other strength properties and also improves formation (uniformity). Many sheet properties continue to improve down to below 0.1% consistency; however, this is an impractical amount of water to handle. (Most paper machine run a higher headbox consistency than optimum {{because they have been}} sped up over time without replacing the <b>fan</b> <b>pump</b> and headbox. There is also an economic trade off with high pumping costs for lower consistency).|$|E

Where <b>fans</b> and <b>pumps</b> serve a varying process load, a simple way to vary the delivered quantity of fluid is with a damper or valve in the outlet of the <b>fan</b> or <b>pump,</b> which by its increased pressure drop, reduces the flow in the process. However, this additional pressure drop represents energy loss. Sometimes it is economically practical to put in some device that recovers this otherwise lost energy.

5000|$|The airship was {{assembled}} in Spencer's balloon shed at Crystal Palace, London, then a popular site for balloon ascents. The envelope of the airship measured some 75 feet (23 metres) {{in length and}} had a capacity of 20,000 cubic feet (566 cubic metres) of hydrogen. The gondola was an open framework of bamboo poles, on which was mounted a Simms petrol engine of {{three and a half}} horse power. There was only space for a single person. The engine drove a wooden propeller which worked in tractor configuration; previous airships had used a pusher configuration, which, being mounted at the back, ran the risk of igniting any escaping gas. A <b>fan</b> <b>pump</b> and valve designed by Spencer replaced any lost gas with air, to prevent the envelope from deforming. A further safety feature was that {{in the event of a}} catastrophic failure of the envelope, Spencer claimed that it was designed to collapse into the shape of a parachute. The completed airship was reported to have made its first flight some time in late June 1902. There followed a series of trial flights at the Crystal Palace polo ground. On 14 July, the airship was piloted by Spencer's wife, Rose, on a powered flight in a circuit around the ground, [...] "under perfect control" [...] according to one newspaper report. If the various press reports of the event are correct, this makes Mrs Spencer the first woman to pilot a powered aircraft. Although designed to be a single-seater, Spencer flew with his three-month-old baby daughter Gladys on at least one occasion, claiming that she was the first female to have flown in an airship.|$|E

40|$|Introduction By {{turbomachine}} we mean a <b>fan,</b> <b>pump,</b> compressor, or turbine {{that changes}} the energy level of a flowing fluid by means of momentum exchange. Sometimes the term rotordynamic machines is used for this class of machines to distinguish them from positive displacement devices. Turbomachines are second only to electric motors in their number and are wide-spread in practically all industries, ranging in power levels from a few watts to more than 100 MW. Because of the requirements of aircraft jet propulsion, new power plants (both steam and gas turbine) and rocket propulsion research, development continues actively in this field today. The present experimental turbomachine is an axial-flow fan powered by a three phase induction motor. The fan (details in the appendix) is used on the MD- 11 aircraft to cool electronic equipment in the cockpit. The fan consists of a rotor which receives axial non-swirling air from the inlet t...|$|E

40|$|Electric motor {{systems are}} widely used in China to power <b>fans,</b> <b>pumps,</b> blowers, air compressors, {{refrigeration}} compressors, conveyers, machinery, and many other types of equipment. Overall, electric motor systems consume more than 600 billion kWh annually, accounting for more than 50 % of China’s electricity use. There are large opportunities to improve the efficiency of motor systems. Electric motors in China are approximately 2 - 4 % less efficient on average than motors in the U. S. and Canada. <b>Fans</b> and <b>pumps</b> in China are approximately 3 - 5 % less efficient than in developed countries. Even more importantly, motors, <b>fans,</b> <b>pumps,</b> air compressors and other motor-driven equipment are frequently applied with little attention to system efficiency. More optimized design, including appropriate sizing and use of speed control strategies, can reduce energy use by 20 % or more in many applications. Unfortunately, few Chinese enterprises use or even know about these energy-saving practices. Opportunities for motor system improvements are probably greater in China than in the U. S. In order to begin capturing these savings, China is establishing a China Motor Systems Energy Conservation Program. Elements of this program include work to develop minimum efficiency standards for motors, a voluntary “green motor ” labeling program for high-efficiency motors, efforts to develop and promote motor system management guidelines, and a training, technical assistance and financing program to promote optimization of key motor systems...|$|R

Due to their importance, an overview of these factors is presented in this report. This study also describes the electricity use in the industrial and tertiary sectors and the {{electricity consumption}} associated with the different types of electric motors systems in the Member States of the European Union, as well as estimated future evolution until 2010. The studies for individual countries were carried out by the different partners of the motors study group at a previous stage. The study has found that {{there is a lack of}} accurate information about the motor electricity consumption, installed motor capacity and the motor market in almost all the European Union countries and only some general statistical sources are available. There is little field data, which is mainly available in Denmark, France, Italy and the Netherlands. Due to this lack of primary information, some common assumptions were made, based on the experience of the members of the study group. This lack of end-use characterisation data shows the need for improvement from the point of view of current knowledge. It is therefore recommended that further research is undertaken to arrive at more accurate figures. These could be the basis for a better understanding for motor use in practice and - as a consequence - for a more precise appraisal of potentials and barriers to energy efficiency. (orig.)

40|$|In {{its most}} basic step by step form, it sounds quite simple and logical. 1. Find an {{opportunity}} to improve efficiency. 2. Carry out the upgrade. 3. Realize the great energy savings that were obtained through the modification. 4. Lay claim to bragging rights {{as the one who}} obtained the most savings, the best Return on Investment (ROI), or the quickest payback. There's only one problem with this scenario. In most cases, the end results are so encumbered with other complex details of the operation or so difficult to prove that the most adequate response to a success story is "Oh, really?". Welcome to the world of unverified optimization projects and energy savings claims. The determination of energy savings involves a comparison of the energy use of a process, system or facility before an energy efficient measure is applied to the energy use after the measure is installed and operational. More accurately, the actual savings can be defined as the difference between "what is" and "what would have been". Since competition exists within organizations for limited capital resources, project approval is based on the principle that the short or long term benefits of a specific upgrade exceed the investment potential of other proposed expenditures. When a typical investment is made, one presupposes that the investor will be interested in tracking performance. When companies invest in energy efficient upgrades, it is assumed that an analysis of some sort will be conducted to provide managers with the data necessary for gauging success. However, in most cases, beyond the cursory and qualitative observations, meaningful analysis is simply not conducted and the true success remains forever as an unanswered question. The verification of a project's ultimate performance can be established through a number of means. The most objective approach involves the services of an independent third party {{with a high level of}} expertise in the specific technology employed in the upgrade. Popular targets for applying energy efficient upgrades are <b>fan,</b> <b>pump</b> and blower systems since they collectively represent the largest percentage of motor driven load.
