40|$|A 3 year {{research}} has been conducted on grapevine « Vernaccia » variety to evaluate the influence of some training systems on the flower failure percentage. Four training systems were compared: spur pruning, <b>horizontal</b> <b>cordon,</b> bilatera 1 Guyot, and Sylvoz. Observations were made each year on the flower number per inflorescence, and on the flower failure percentage. The resu 1 ts showed a great influence of the training system on the flower failure percentage, while the number of flowers per inflorescence was mainly related to the different seasons. The highest flower failure percentage was found in spur pruned trees, the lowest in Sylvoz trained trees, and the intermediate in horinzontal cordon and bilateral Guyot trained trees...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. A novel {{approach}} was devised to estimate vegetative growth and fruit mass (i. e., yield) in grapevines by continuously measuring {{the tension in}} the <b>horizontal</b> (<b>cordon)</b> support wire of the trellis. Load cells installed in−line with the cordon wire were connected to an automated data acquisition system, a major departure from the viticulture industry’s standard method of collect-ing fruit samples by hand two or three times per growing season. Each experimental row in the vineyard was calibrated to deter-mine the change in tension in that row in response to an increase in known mass on the cordon wire. The effects of temperature on wire tension were removed by post−processing with a regression−based empirical protocol, which corrected the raw data to a standard temperature. Because data were averaged over 15 min, wind gusts appeared to have little measurable effect on the tension measurement. A smoothing algorithm removed remaining transient disturbances in the data without masking signifi-cant events like crop thinning or harvest. Results to date suggest a linear relationship between wire tension and fruit mass that varies among rows, but not within a row, during a single season. Yields were between 4. 5 and 20. 2 t ha− 1 (2 to 9 t acre− 1) ...|$|E
40|$|Em experimento levado a efeito na Estação Experimental de Jundiaí, procurou-se verificar a conveniência ou não de corrigirem-se as falhas de brotação comumente observadas em videira da variedade Niágara Rosada, quando conduzida em espaldeira, no sistema denominado cordão esporonado. Consideraram-se quatro casos: plantas que apresentavam 5, 4, 3 e 2 esporões, as quais foram corrigidas para 6 esporões, número médio observado em videiras adultas, quando o espaçamento entre plantas é de 1 metro. Nos cinco biênios estudados, as produções médias das plantas corrigidas para 6 esporões superaram as das não corrigidas, que apresentavam 5, 4, 3 e 2 esporões, em 12, 26, 60 e 158 por cento, respectivamente. In {{the present}} paper, studies {{carried out to}} {{evaluate}} the effect of correction of prunning on the yield of old Niagara Rosada vines trained on unilateral <b>horizontal</b> <b>cordon</b> are reported. In a ten years old vineyard, a survey was made to check the number of spurs per plant. It {{was found that the}} number of living spurs varied from 2 to 5. In 1960, part of the plants was prunned in order to establish 6 two-bud spurs on each one. An equal number of plants was kept with the original number of spurs. The yield was recorded for ten years. The data obtained indicated that plants with 6 two-bud spurs produced 12, 26, 60 and 158 per cent more than plants with 5, 4, 3 and 2 two-bud spurs respectively...|$|E
40|$|The study {{examined}} the effect of four training systems on the adaptation of Pinot noir in the Friuli hills (northeastern Italy). Simple Guyot, double Guyot, <b>horizontal</b> spurred <b>cordon,</b> and vertical spurred cordon were assessed during four years (1992 through 1995). The training systems affected yield but showed little or no impact on grape and wine composition (sugars, grape and wine phenolics). Sensory analysis could not show relevant differences among training systems. Therefore, the selection of training system may be made according to the vineyard management choices and mechanization possibilities...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} was undertaken to improve knowledge of ‘Sangiovese’ and ‘Cabernet Sauvignon’ production behaviour at different planting densities in a vineyard trained to <b>horizontal</b> spur <b>cordon</b> and located on Tuscan coastal area. The trial was conducted during a four year period (1997 - 2000) in a vineyard {{set up in}} 1994, comparing four planting distances (2. 8 x 1. 2; 2. 0 x 1. 5; 2. 5 x 1. 0; 2. 0 x 0. 75) at a density ranging from a minimum of 2976 {{to a maximum of}} 6667 vines/ha. ‘Cabernet Sauvignon’ was more vigorous, produced smaller clusters, had higher bud fertility, a lower yield and Ravaz index than ‘Sangiovese’. The must of ‘Cabernet Sauvignon’ had less titratable acidity and higher pH and total soluble solids content than ‘Sangiovese’. In general yield and production of wood per square meter were positively related to the increase in planting density, while pruning wood per linear meter showed an opposite trend. In ‘Sangiovese’ both inter-row and along the row spacing had a marked influence on yield and vegetative performance while in ‘Cabernet Sauvignon’ the effect of the spacing along the row seems to be prevailing. The results of this research indicate that in the Tuscan coastal area, planting density had no significant influence on grape quality in both cultivars...|$|R
40|$|The main {{function}} attributed to rootstocks in grapevine-growing {{has so far}} been that of ensuring adequa 1 te resistance against phylloxera and tolerance of other limiting soil and climate factors such as active lime¬stone, aridity, soil compaction, sali¬nity and so forth. In recent years, however, there has been increasing awareness that the rootstock also plays an important role as an inte-gral part of a complex mechanism which can influence the physiologi¬cal activity of the entire plant, with particular effect on vigor and other quantitative and qualitative aspects of production. Choice of rootstock thus represents one of the agronomic factors that can notably affect the economic results of a vineyard. Research on rootstocks was conducted at the Villa Acquaviva estate at Montemerano, in the Morellino di Scansano Doc area. The vineyard was set up in 1994 with 'Sangiovese' grapevines graf¬ted onto thirteen rootstocks (101 - 14, 1103 P, UOR, 140 Ru, 161 - 49, 41 B, 420 A, 775 ?, 779 P, K 5 BB, S 04, Gravesac). Vines were trained to espalier and pruned to <b>horizontal</b> single <b>cordon.</b> Results obtained {{in the first two years}} of observation showed some differences in vegetati¬ve and production behavior. In par¬ticular, 41 B induced lower produc-tivity and elevated sugar levels while also maintaining good acidity levels, in contrast with virtually all the other rootstocks studied...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} {{planting}} density {{has been considered}} to be a major factor influencing production quality. The "Chianti Classico 2000 " Project has thus designed a study to investigate the relation between planting density and grapevine vegetative-productive behavior, with particular reference to grape quality. Research was conducted in two experimental vineyards established in 1989 with "Sangiovese", clone RIO on 420 A and 1103 P, at the estates of hole and Olena (Barberino Val d'Elsa -Firenze) and Badia a Coltibuono (Gaiole in CManti - Siena). Grapevines were spaced at various distances in order to obtain 4 planting densities, resepctively 2, 564, 5, 000, 7, 575 and 9, 803 grapevines/ha, and were trained to <b>horizontal</b> spurred <b>cordon,</b> staked up at roughly 60 cm from the ground. Bud load was roughly 30, 000 buds/ha, corresponding to the value generally adopted in the Chianti Classico area. Results obtained in six years of observations performed on vegetative, productive and phenologic parameters showed that the higher planting densities did not offer substantial advantages in vegetative-pro-ductive behavior and grape quality as compared to lower densities. This could be due to impairment of balance on account of a low number of buds per vine. Results concerning rootstocks showed that 1103 P induced greater vigor than 420 A. Overall, the density of 5, 000 grapevines/ha achieved the most balanced vine development and more restrained production, in line with general recommendations for Chianti Classico production...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this trial was {{to improve the quality}} of Merlot grapes, through the canopy management, to achieve better phenolic maturity without increasing the sugar content of the grapes. The vineyard located in Bolgheri (Tuscany-Italy) consisted of the cv. Merlot (clone 181 on 110 R) spaced at m 2. 0 x 0. 7, trained to <b>horizontal</b> spur <b>cordon,</b> pruned to 8 buds per vine, which were subjected to three types of canopy treatment on six randomized replications: FM) current farm management consisting of three shoot trimming (topping and hedging) made every 20 days, starting from the beginning of June (after fruit set); ELR) early basal shoot leaf removal at bloom followed by three shoot trimming every 20 days (like in treatment FM); NTD) None shoot trimming nor defoliation, rolling up the terminal part of the shoots, as adopted in biodynamic viticulture. The early defoliation determined a decrease in the number of berries per bunch (- 17 %) and the size of grapes at harvest (- 15 %) compared to the other thesis, moreover, did not affect the level of sugar at ripeness, leading to a significant increase of the phenol content (polyphenols, anthocyanins and total anthocyanins extracted). Instrumental analysis of phenol substances were perfectly compatible with those obtained by the of sensorial analysis panel which tested the berry maturity using a new method developed by our Department. More precisely a better cellular phenol maturity (skin and seed) and a greater attenuation of the bitter taste on berry sampled by the vines early defoliated were detected...|$|R
40|$|First Results on the Rio-Agronomic Behaviour of Six "Sangiovese" Clones in the "Morellino di Scansano" Wine Doc Production Zone. Choice of clone {{represents}} a cru¬cial technical aspect {{in setting up}} new vineyards. Clonal selection car¬ried out on "Sangiovese" during {{the last twenty years}} has provided grapevine-growers {{with a wide range of}} genetic material from which to choose. However, when operating within a specific vine¬yard, it is still difficult today to sin¬gle out the most appropriate clone for the given situation, since knowl¬edge on the vegetal-productive and qualitative behaviour of commer¬cially available clones is so far insuf¬ficient. A series of bio-agronomic observations was therefore under¬taken on six "Sangiovese" clones in one of the classic grapevine-growing areas of the Province of Grosseto, the Doc "Morellino di Scansano" production area. An experimental vineyard was set up with the follow¬ing' clones: SS-F 9 -A 5 - 48, M 42, Peccioli 1, R 24, VCR 4, R 1 O. The grapevines were established in win¬ter 1994 as cuttings grafted onto 420 A, spaced at 3 x 1 m and trained to espalier with <b>horizontal</b> single <b>cordon.</b> Results obtained from observations on vegetal-pro-ductive parameters and must qual¬itative characteristics highlight a number of interesting behavioural differences between the clones exam¬ined. Briefly, quantity of grapes per grapevine was greatest in clones SS-F 9 -A 5 - 48 and lowest in R 1 O, sugar concentration was highest in clones M 42 and Peccioli 1, and polyphenol and anthocyanin levels highest in clones Peccioli 1 and SS-F 9 -A 5 - 48. These results obtained from the first cycle of observations should be con¬sidered merely preliminary. Further research will be required in future years in order to obtain a sufficient number of values from adult grapevines before the outcome of research can be translated into practical applications available to wine estates...|$|R
