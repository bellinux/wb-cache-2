60|$|John Joiner smelt the pudding; but {{he regretted}} {{that he had}} not time to stay to dinner, because he had just {{finished}} making a wheel-barrow for Miss Potter, and she had ordered two <b>hen-coops.</b>|$|R
6000|$|He rose {{abruptly}} (we had seated {{ourselves on}} a couple of <b>hen-coops</b> under the break of the poop). [...] "You will excuse me. I have an order to give"; and he hurried {{up the steps to the}} quarter-deck.|$|R
60|$|In a {{few minutes}} the two <b>hen-coops</b> were placed face to face and lashed firmly together, despite the remonstrative poultry. Then the main-hatch was laid upon the top, and fixed there by means of the iron rings at its four corners.|$|R
6000|$|... "Your husband isn't in the house, I suppose?" [...] added Mr. Tulliver after a grave pause, {{during which}} four {{children}} had run out, like chickens whose mother has been suddenly in eclipse behind the <b>hen-coop.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "You may {{put me in}} a <b>hen-coop,</b> {{and keep}} me there a year, if you like. I won't fret, for I'm sure you know what is best for me," [...] said Jill, gayly, as {{she looked up at the}} good friend who had done so much for her.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hold hard! stern all!" [...] roared the mate, as we {{went flying}} down to leeward, and almost ran over the <b>hen-coop,</b> to which a human form was seen to be {{clinging}} with the tenacity of a drowning man. We had swept down so quickly that we shot past it. In an agony of fear lest my friend should be again lost in the darkness, I leaped up and sprang into the sea. Tom Lokins, however, had noticed what I was about; he seized me by the collar of my jacket, just as I reached the water, and held me with a grip like a vice till {{one of the men}} came to his assistance, and dragged me back into the boat. In a few moments more we reached the <b>hen-coop,</b> and Fred was saved! ...|$|E
60|$|A blue gauze {{of smoke}} floated over the chimney, as if {{somebody}} was living there; round towards the side some empty <b>hen-coops</b> were piled away; {{while under the}} hollies were divers frameworks of wire netting and sticks, showing that birds were kept here at some seasons of the year.|$|R
60|$|A happier little lass {{was seldom}} seen than Kitty when, {{dressed in her}} clean, blue check frock, and the old hat, with a faded ribbon, she rode away with Sam; and behind, among the <b>hen-coops,</b> was Miss Puss, much excited by the clucking and {{fluttering}} of her fellow-travellers.|$|R
60|$|Almost {{before her}} misgiving {{at the news}} could find time to shape itself she took, under her companion's direction, {{two of the most}} {{beautiful}} of the Hamburghs in her arms, and followed the maid-servant, who had likewise taken two, to the adjacent mansion, which, though ornate and imposing, showed traces everywhere on this side that some occupant of its chambers could bend to the love of dumb creatures--feathers floating within view of the front, and <b>hen-coops</b> standing on the grass.|$|R
6000|$|... "Bring me a <b>hen-coop,</b> Quin," [...] {{he said to}} the steward, who, {{having so}} far {{completed}} his morning work, and consumed his morning meal, was smoking his pipe, seated on the rail beside Tips. Tips was an admirer of the Irishman, and, in consequence, an imitator as far as he dared and was permitted.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not {{so much as}} a <b>hen-coop,</b> Sir Jarvy! We all {{wonders what}} has become of Captain Parker; no sign of him or of his ship is to be found on the briny ocean.

6000|$|Very pertinently it was {{demanded of}} Plato, why a picked chicken, which was clearly [...] "a biped without feathers," [...] was not, {{according}} to his own definition, a man? But I am not to be bothered by any similar query. Man is an animal that diddles, {{and there is no}} animal that diddles but man. It will take an entire <b>hen-coop</b> of picked chickens to get over that.|$|E
60|$|The deck was {{littered}} with wreckage and with <b>hen-coops,</b> in which the dead birds were washing about. The boats were gone, {{with the exception of}} one, the bottom of which had been stove, and it was certain that the crew had abandoned the vessel. The cabin was in a deck house, one side of which had been beaten in by a heavy sea. Allardyce and I entered it, and found the captain's table as he had left it, his books and papers--all Spanish or Portuguese--scattered over it, with piles of cigarette ash everywhere. I looked about for the log, but could not find it.|$|R
6000|$|A {{few minutes}} later and the raft struck on the shore. And well was it for the party that the weather chanced to be so fine, for {{if there had been}} {{anything}} like a breeze, their frail contrivance would inevitably have been dashed to pieces. Even a slight swell from the westward would have raised such a surf on that rugged shore {{that it would have been}} impossible for the best of swimmers to have landed without broken limbs, if not loss of life. As it was, they got ashore not only without difficulty, but even succeeded in hauling the raft up on the beach without much damage to its parts--though, of course, the unfortunate fowls in the <b>hen-coops</b> had all perished! ...|$|R
60|$|The only {{discordant}} {{sounds that}} met {{the ears of}} those who voyaged in the bark Ocean Queen were the cacklings of a creature in the <b>hen-coops</b> which had laid an egg, or thought it had done so, or wished to do so, or, having been sea-sick up to that time, perhaps, endeavoured to revive its spirits by recalling {{the fact that it}} once did so, and might perhaps do so again! By the way there was also one other discord, {{in the form of a}} pugnacious baby, which whimpered continuously, and, from some unaccountable cause, refused to be comforted. But that was a discord which, as in some musical chords, seemed rather to improve the harmony-- at least in its mother's ears.|$|R
60|$|The Sabbath is no {{ordinary}} day with the Tahitians. So far as doing any work is concerned, it is scrupulously observed. The canoes are hauled up on the beach; the nets are spread to dry. Passing by the <b>hen-coop</b> huts on the roadside, you find their occupants idle, as usual; but less disposed to gossip. After service, repose broods over the whole island; the valleys reaching inland look stiller than ever.|$|E
60|$|At {{the same}} moment he seized a light <b>hen-coop</b> and tossed it overboard, and the mate {{did the same with}} an oar in the {{twinkling}} of an eye. Almost without knowing what I did, or why I did it, I seized a great mass of oakum and rubbish that lay on the deck saturated with oil, I thrust it into the embers of the fire in the try-works and hurled it blazing into the sea.|$|E
60|$|Just {{now she was}} tossing on {{the bosom}} of a big ocean, with nothing to keep her afloat but a miserable wooden <b>hen-coop</b> that had a plank bottom and slatted sides, through which the water {{constantly}} splashed and wetted her through to the skin! And {{there was nothing to}} eat when she became hungry--as she was sure to do before long--and no fresh water to drink and no dry clothes to put on.|$|E
60|$|The Dawn's bows {{fell off}} until the ship lay {{broadside}} to the gale, {{which made her}} reel until her lee lower yard-arms nearly dipped. Then she overcame the cauldron of water that was boiling around her, and began to draw heavily ahead. Three seas swept athwart her decks, before she minded her helm in the least, carrying with them every thing that was not most firmly lashed, or which had not animal life to direct its movements, away to leeward. They swept off the <b>hen-coops,</b> and ripped four or five water-casks from their lashings, even, as if the latter had been pack-thread. The camboose-house went also, at the last of these terrific seas; and nothing saved the camboose itself, but its great weight, added {{to the strength of}} its fastenings. In a word, little was left, that could very well go, but the launch, the gripes of which fortunately held on.|$|R
6000|$|... "Son, I ain't {{given to}} preaching. This {{is the first}} time I ever come to the {{penitent}} form, and you put me there yourself--hard. I've seen a few in my time, and I ain't fastidious so as you can notice it. But let me tell you right not that I'm worth the devil alone knows how many millions, and that I'd sure give it all, right here on the bar, to turn down your hand. Which means I'd give the whole shooting match just to be back where I was before I quit sleeping under the stars and come into the <b>hen-coops</b> of cities to drink cocktails and lift up my feet and ride. Son, that's that's the matter with me, and that's the way I feel about it. The game ain't worth the candle. You just take care of yourself, and roll my advice over once in a while. Good night." ...|$|R
60|$|The Wild Wave {{was again}} {{fortunate}} in her weather {{during the early}} part of her voyage, but when off the Cape encountered a heavy gale. Jack had never before seen a storm at sea, and, accustomed as he was to the short choppy waves {{at the mouth of the}} Thames, he was astonished at the size of those he now beheld. They seemed to him as large in comparison to the size of the barque as those he had before seen were to that of the smack. For three days the vessel lay to. Fortunately the glass had given notice of the approach of the storm, and all the upper spars had been sent down and the vessel got under snug canvas before it struck her, and she therefore rode out the gale with no farther damage than the carrying away of part of her bulwarks, and the loss of some <b>hen-coops</b> and various other of her deck gear. As soon as the gale abated sail was made, and they continued on their course.|$|R
6000|$|... “I cannot save her,” he said, {{and raised}} a shout for Dimchurch. It was unanswered. “There,” he said, “the water is coming down; she will sink in a minute. I cannot save her—indeed she {{is as good as}} dead already—but I can save you,” and {{snatching}} the girl up he ran {{to the foot of the}} companion. The water was already pouring down, but he struggled up against it, and managed to reach the deck; but before he could cross to the side the vessel gave a sudden lurch and went down. He was carried under with the suck, but by desperate efforts he gained the surface just as his breath was spent. For a moment or two he was unable to speak, but he was none the less ready to act. Looking round he saw a <b>hen-coop</b> floating near, and, swimming to it, he clung to it with one arm while he held the girl’s head above water with the other. Then, when he had recovered his breath, he shouted “Dimchurch!” Fortunately the gig was not far away, and his hail was at once answered, and a moment later the boat was alongside the <b>hen-coop.</b>|$|E
6000|$|It was {{a little}} after midnight when these boats set out--two being meant to attack, and two to remain in support. They had seven miles of river to {{traverse}} before reaching the enemy, and it was {{while they were in}} the midst of their voyage that I chanced to meet them, clinging to my <b>hen-coop.</b> They came so straight at me that I was on the point of being run down by the leading boat, when I gave a sharp [...] "halloo!" ...|$|E
60|$|I stopped, for Lancey {{had already}} let go, {{and made a}} dash for the nearest ship. I heard him hail, and saw the {{flashing}} of lights for a moment, then all was dark again and silent, as I was hurried onward. The feeling of certainty {{that he could not}} have been saved with so rapid a current sweeping him past, filled my mind with intense anxiety. Just then I felt a shock. The <b>hen-coop</b> had been driven against another vessel, which I had not observed.|$|E
6000|$|... "This {{will never}} answer," [...] he said, [...] "Master Kilderkin--the king twice asked for sweetbreads, and fricasseed coxcombs, {{which are a}} {{favourite}} dish of his most Sacred Majesty, {{and they were not}} to be had, because Master Kilderkin had not supplied them to the clerk of the kitchen, as by bargain bound." [...] Here Kilderkin made some apology, brief, according to his own nature, and muttered in a lowly tone after the fashion of all who find themselves in a scrape. His superior replied, in a lofty strain of voice, [...] "Do not tell me of the carrier and his wain, and of the <b>hen-coops</b> coming from Norfolk with the poultry; a loyal man would have sent an express--he would have gone upon his stumps, like Widdrington. What if the king had lost his appetite, Master Kilderkin? What if his most Sacred Majesty had lost his dinner? O, Master Kilderkin, if you had but the just sense of the dignity of our profession, which is told of by the witty African slave, for so the king's most excellent Majesty designates him, Publius Terentius, Tanguam in specula--in patinas inspicerejubeo." ...|$|R
60|$|As {{this last}} {{expression}} was {{common in the}} mouths of the Americans of the day, having been used {{on the occasion of}} the existing war with France, I felt confident it would be understood. Marble made no answer, and I was permitted to move from the companion-way, and to take a seat on the <b>hen-coops.</b> My situation was sufficiently remarkable. It was still dark; but enough light fell from the stars to permit me to see all the swarthy and savage forms that were gliding about the decks, and even to observe something of the expression of the countenances of those, who, from time to time, came near to stare me in the face. The last seemed ferociously disposed; but it was evident that a master-spirit held all these wild beings in strict subjection; quelling the turbulence of their humours, restraining their fierce disposition to violence, and giving concert and design to all their proceedings. This master-spirit was Smudge! Of the fact, I could not doubt; his gestures, his voice, his commands, giving movement and method to everything that was done. I observed that he spoke with authority and confidence, though he spoke calmly. He was obeyed, without any particular marks of deference, but he was obeyed implicitly. I could also see that the savages considered themselves as conquerors; caring very little for the men under hatches.|$|R
6000|$|Nothing {{could be}} better suited to {{progress}} through the long village, which rises and sinks beside the shore like a landscape with its sea-legs on; and {{nothing could be more}} charming and friendly than this village. It is quite untainted as yet by the summer cottages which have covered so much of the coast, and made it look as if the aesthetic suburbs of New York and Boston had gone ashore upon it. There are two or three old- fashioned summer hotels; but the summer life distinctly fails to characterize the place. The people live where their forefathers have lived for two hundred and fifty years; and for the century since the baronial domain of Sir William was broken up and his possessions confiscated by the young Republic, they have dwelt in small red or white houses on their small holdings along the slopes and levels of the low hills beside the water, where a man may pass with the least inconvenience and delay from his threshold to his gunwale. Not all the houses are small; some are spacious and ambitious to be of ugly modern patterns; but most are simple and homelike. Their gardens, following the example of Sir William's vanished pleasaunce, drop southward to the shore, where the lobster-traps and the <b>hen-coops</b> meet in unembarrassed promiscuity. But the fish-flakes which once gave these inclines the effect of terraced vineyards have passed as utterly as the proud parterres of the old baronet; and Kittery Point no longer [...] "makes" [...] a cod or a haddock for the market.|$|R
60|$|The boys felt {{hostile to}} him; {{they were more}} {{interested}} in their own pursuits. He wandered back to the house to look for his mother. As he went round the back, he saw Miriam kneeling in front of the <b>hen-coop,</b> some maize in her hand, biting her lip, and crouching in an intense attitude. The hen was eyeing her wickedly. Very gingerly she put forward her hand. The hen bobbed for her. She drew back quickly with a cry, half of fear, half of chagrin.|$|E
60|$|The land, {{which they}} seemed to be rapidly approaching, since it grew more {{distinct}} every minute, was quite beautiful as viewed by the little girl in the floating <b>hen-coop.</b> Next to the water was a broad beach of white sand and gravel, and farther back were several rocky hills, while beyond these appeared a strip of green trees that marked the edge of a forest. But there were no houses to be seen, nor any sign of people who might inhabit this unknown land.|$|E
60|$|Phonny gladly {{agreed to}} this, {{and so the}} boys {{determined}} that the first thing {{for the next day}} should be, to put the shop and the tools all in complete order, and the next, to make the prettiest <b>hen-coop</b> they could contrive, {{in a corner of the}} yard. This they did, and Beechnut got the hen and the chickens down and put them into it. The brood was very large, there being twelve chickens in it, and they were all very pretty chickens indeed.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Marble had {{the middle}} watch that night, {{and of course}} I was on deck from midnight until four in the morning. It proved misty most of the watch, and for quite an hour we had a light drizzling rain. The ship, the whole time, was close-hauled, {{carrying}} royals. As everybody seemed to have {{made up his mind}} to a quiet night, one without any reefing or furling, most of the watch were sleeping about the decks, or wherever they could get good quarters, and be least in the way. I do not know what kept me awake, for lads of my age are apt to get all the sleep they can; but I believe I was thinking of Clawbonny, and Grace, and Lucy; for the latter, excellent girl as she was, often crossed my mind in those days of youth and comparative innocence. Awake I was, and walking in the weather-gangway, in a sailor's trot. Mr. Marble, he I do believe was fairly snoozing on the <b>hen-coops,</b> being, like the sails, as one might say, barely [...] "asleep." [...] At that moment I heard a noise, one familiar to seamen; that of an oar falling in a boat. So completely was my mind bent on other and distant scenes, that at first I felt no surprise, as if we were in a harbour surrounded by craft of various sizes, coming and going at all hours. But a second thought destroyed this illusion, and I looked eagerly about me. Directly on our weather-bow, distant perhaps a cable's length, I saw a small sail, and I could distinguish it sufficiently well to perceive it was a proa. I sang out [...] "Sail ho! and close aboard!" ...|$|R
6000|$|My {{old friend}} {{was too much}} {{affected}} to speak, for some little time. He shook hands with everybody, and seemed as much astonished as he was delighted at finding {{so many of us}} together again; but not a syllable did he utter for several minutes. I had his chest passed into the cabin, and then went and took my seat alongside of him on the <b>hen-coops,</b> intending to hear his story, {{as soon as he was}} disposed to give it. But, it was no easy matter to get out of ear-shot of my passengers. During the gale, they had been tongue-tied, and I had a little peace; but, no sooner did the wind and sea go down, than they broke out in the old spot, and began to do Boston, in the way they had commenced. Now, Marble had come on board, in a manner so unusual, and it was evident a secret history was to be revealed, that all three took post in the companion-way, in a manner to render it impossible anything material could escape them. I knew the folly of attempting a change of position on deck; we should certainly be followed up; and, people of this class, so long as they can make the excuse of saying they heard any part of a secret, never scruple about inventing the portions that happen to escape their ears. Consequently, I desired Marble and Talcott to follow me; and, incontinently, I led the way into the main-top. I was obeyed, the second-mate having the watch, and all three of us were soon seated with our legs over the top-rim, as comfortable as so many gossips, who had just finished their last cups, have stirred the fire, and drawn their heads together to open a fresh-budget. Neither Sarah nor Jane could follow us, thank God! ...|$|R
60|$|The outer rind of the Bamboo, {{split and}} shaved thin, {{is the strongest}} {{material}} for baskets; <b>hen-coops,</b> bird-cages, and conical fish-traps are very quickly made from a single joint, by splitting off the skin in narrow strips left attached to one end, while rings of the same material or of rattan are twisted in at regular distances. Water is brought to the houses by little aqueducts formed of large Bamboos split in half and supported on crossed sticks of various heights so as {{to give it a}} regular fall. Thin long-jointed Bamboos form the Dyaks' only water-vessels, and a dozen of them stand in the corner of every house. They are clean, light, and easily carried, and are in many ways superior to earthen vessels for the same purpose. They also make excellent cooking utensils; vegetables and rice can be boiled in them to perfection, and they are often used when travelling. Salted fruit or fish, sugar, vinegar, and honey are preserved in them instead of in jars or bottles. In a small Bamboo case, prettily carved and ornamented, the Dyak carries his sirih and lime for betel chewing, and his little long-bladed knife has a Bamboo sheath. His favourite pipe is a huge hubble-bubble, which he will construct in a few minutes by inserting a small piece of Bamboo for a bowl obliquely into a large cylinder about six inches from the bottom containing water, through which the smoke passes to a long slender Bamboo tube. There are many other small matters for which Bamboo is daily used, but enough has now been mentioned to show its value. In other parts of the Archipelago I have myself seen it applied to many new uses, and it is probable that my limited means of observation did not make me acquainted with one-half the ways in which it is serviceable to the Dyaks of Sarawak.|$|R
