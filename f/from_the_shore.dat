5|$|After {{waiting for}} the wind, Endeavour resumed her voyage on the {{afternoon}} of 5 August 1770, reaching the northernmost point of Cape York Peninsula fifteen days later. On 22 August, Cook was rowed ashore to a small coastal island to proclaim British sovereignty over the eastern Australian mainland. Cook christened his landing place Possession Island, and ceremonial volleys of gunfire <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>shore</b> and Endeavours deck marked the occasion.|$|E

5|$|Although NY18 {{is signed}} as east–west, it runs {{primarily}} north–south through the western portion of Niagara County. After leaving Niagara County, NY18 shifts farther south, gradually moving away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>shore</b> of Lake Ontario. In central Orleans County, NY18 meets the Lake Ontario State Parkway at the Lakeside Beach State Park. The parkway then becomes the lakeside road, and NY18 veers south {{to follow a}} more inland routing.|$|E
5|$|August 10, 1976– Prior to {{the arrival}} of Hurricane Belle from the south, 250,000 {{evacuate}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>shore</b> during the peak of the tourist season. While paralleling the coast just offshore, it causes winds of 65mph (105km/h) and gusts of up to 90mph (145km/h), along with a maximum rainfall total of 3.93inches (9.98cm) in Cape May Court House. In addition, the hurricane causes a storm surge of 8.85feet (2.70m) in Atlantic City. However, damage is less than expected, and no deaths occur.|$|E
5|$|Hatchlings {{can lose}} up to 20% {{of their body}} mass due to {{evaporation}} of water as they journey from nest to ocean. They initially use the undertow to push them five to 10 m away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>shore.</b> Once in the ocean, they swim for about 20 hours, taking them far offshore. An iron compound, magnetite, in their brains allows the turtles to perceive the Earth's magnetic field, for navigation.|$|E

5|$|Spending {{the autumn}} and {{winter in the}} open ocean of the cold {{northern}} seas, the Atlantic puffin returns to coastal areas {{at the start of}} the breeding season in late spring. It nests in clifftop colonies, digging a burrow in which a single white egg is laid. The chick mostly feeds on whole fish and grows rapidly. After about six weeks it is fully fledged and makes its way at night to the sea. It swims away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>shore</b> and does not return to land for several years.|$|E
5|$|The Earth's {{rotation}} {{causes the}} Coriolis effect, which bends currents {{to the right}} in the Northern Hemisphere {{and to the left}} in the Southern Hemisphere. When this bend brings the currents into more perpendicular contact with the shore, it can amplify the surge, and when it bends the current away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>shore</b> it has the effect of lessening the surge.|$|E
5|$|The {{battle is}} noted {{as the most}} {{significant}} defeat for the Royal Navy during the Napoleonic Wars. Not only had four frigates been lost with their entire crews, but 105 experienced sailors had been killed and 168 wounded {{in one of the}} bloodiest frigate encounters of the war. French losses were also heavy, with Duperré reporting 36 killed and 112 wounded on his squadron and among the soldiers firing <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>shore.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} morning, the Spanish {{sent the}} two ships with a shallower draught {{to find a}} safe approach through the shallows. The caravels anchored about one league <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>shore.</b> Ten large canoes powered by both sails and oars rowed out to meet the Spanish ships. Over thirty Maya boarded the vessels and mixed freely with the Spaniards. The Maya visitors accepted gifts of beads, and the leader indicated with signs that they would return to take the Spanish ashore the following day.|$|E

5|$|Harmless to humans, the puffadder shyshark can {{be easily}} caught by hand. Not {{targeted}} by commercial fisheries because of its small size, it is taken incidentally and discarded by bottom trawlers operating between Mossel Bay and East London, and by fishing boats in False Bay. Many are hooked by recreational anglers casting <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>shore,</b> who also generally discard or kill them as minor pests. Some local exploitation of this species does occur for lobster bait and the aquarium trade. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the puffadder shyshark as Near Threatened. Although it remains abundant, the small range of this shark lies entirely within a heavily fished region, and any increase in fishing activities or habitat degradation could potentially impact the entire population.|$|E

5|$|However, the Japanese retreated beyond Port Arthur's gunfire support range, and {{had been}} {{reinforced}} by main forces of six battleships. At 0850, Makarov turned around {{to head back to}} the harbor and join with three other battleships that had just left. After the squadron had united and turned back towards the enemy, about two miles <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>shore,</b> on 9.42 Petropavlosk detonated a Japanese-laid mine on her port side. Petropavlovsk sank, taking 27 officers and 652 men, including Admiral Makarov and war artist Vasily Vereshchagin with her. A monument was constructed in Saint Petersburg in 1913 to honor Stephan Makarov after Japanese divers identified his remains inside the wreck of Petropavlovsk and gave him a burial at sea.|$|E
5|$|In his frigate HMS Phoenix, Halstead {{was able}} to cut the Batavian frigate Argo off <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>shore</b> {{and bring it to}} battle, forcing it to {{surrender}} in just 20 minutes as other British ships closed with the combat. The remainder of the Batavian squadron had dispersed eastwards away from the frigates and Duncan's fleet, pursued by the frigate HMS Pegasus and brig-sloop HMS Sylph. After a lengthy chase, Phoenix caught the cutter Duke of York, Sylph seized the brig Mercury, while Pegasus succeeded in driving the other brigs, Echo and Gier ashore, where both were believed wrecked. Duncan's blockade of the Texel was instrumental in British control of the North Sea, and a year later it would achieve a decisive victory at the Battle of Camperdown.|$|E
5|$|ML254 {{then began}} slowly {{to leave the}} harbour mouth, {{carrying}} 38survivors of Vindictives 55crewmen huddled on deck, where they remained exposed to machine gun fire <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>shore.</b> As Drummond turned his boat seawards and proceeded back to the offshore squadron that was still engaged in an artillery duel with the German defenders, one of the missing launches, ML276 passed her, having {{caught up with the}} lost cruiser at this late stage. Drummond called to ML276s commander—Lieutenant Rowley Bourke—that he believed there were still men in the water and Bourke immediately entered the harbour to search for them. Drummond's launch proceeded to the rendezvous with the destroyer , overweighted and sinking, so severe was the damage she had suffered.|$|E

5|$|Pellew {{ordered his}} ships to give chase, as Thévenard fled towards the French coast before the British {{numerical}} supremacy. One British ship was {{faster than the}} others, the 38-gun HMS Artois under Captain Edmund Nagle cutting Révolutionnaire off <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>shore</b> and bringing the larger French ship to action. For 45 minutes Artois battled Révolutionnaire until support arrived, {{at which point the}} French frigate's crew surrendered their ship in defiance of their captain's orders. Casualties and damage were light on both sides, and Révolutionnaire was rapidly commissioned into the Royal Navy, joining the squadron that had captured her and subsequently capturing the French frigate Unité at the Action of 13 April 1796.|$|E
5|$|Returning to Île de France in December, Lhermitte steered for Port Louis but {{was intercepted}} by the British {{blockade}} squadron, comprising the 74-gun ship {{of the line}} HMS Tremendous and the 50-gun HMS Adamant. Unable to reach safety, Lhermitte evaded pursuit long enough to drive Preneuse onto a beach {{at the mouth of}} the Tombeau. After a brief exchange of fire the wrecked frigate was surrendered and British boarding parties in ship's boats rowed inshore to Preneuse, removed the survivors and burnt the remains. Watching <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>shore</b> as the last of his command burned on the beach, Sercey subsequently retired from military service.|$|E
5|$|Sperm {{whales are}} not the easiest of whales to watch, due to their long dive times and ability to travel long {{distances}} underwater. However, due to the distinctive look and large size of the whale, watching is increasingly popular. Sperm whale watchers often use hydrophones {{to listen to the}} clicks of the whales and locate them before they surface. Popular locations for sperm whale watching include the town of Kaikoura on New Zealand's South Island, Andenes and Tromsø in Arctic Norway; as well as the Azores, where the continental shelf is so narrow that whales can be observed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>shore,</b> and Dominica where a long-term scientific research program, The Dominica Sperm Whale Project, has been in operation since 2005.|$|E
