50|$|In the main, <b>equalizing</b> <b>basins</b> {{are small}} {{reservoirs}} located below a larger dam and reservoir system.|$|E
50|$|The {{water flowing}} {{out of the}} <b>equalizing</b> <b>basin</b> into the tailstream {{can be used in}} a run-of-river power station.|$|R

50|$|An <b>equalizing</b> <b>basin</b> (Ausgleichsbecken) or <b>equalizing</b> {{reservoir}} {{regulates the}} flow of water below an intermittently operated hydropower station or peaking power plant. This could be a part-load power station (Teillast-Durchfluss-Kraftwerk) or a storage power station. Also called a balancing reservoir.|$|R
50|$|The Vancouver Island Power Company {{completed}} {{construction of}} the Jordan River hydroelectric system in 1911.Water collects at Diversion Dam, runs 8.8 km (5.5 mi) down a wooden sluice to an <b>equalizing</b> <b>basin</b> and flows through a steel penstock for the last 330 vertical meters (1083 vertical feet).|$|R
5000|$|In general, therefore, {{the power}} station {{operator}} today {{is required to}} regulate the flow {{in order to ensure}} a specified minimum level of water flow into the tailwaters. During periods when the turbines are running (peak current generation) the <b>equalizing</b> <b>basin</b> fills up; during periods when the turbines are shut down, the basin drains gradually.|$|R
50|$|It {{is part of}} the Diemeltalsperre {{hydropower}} system (DiT) {{comprising the}} Diemel Dam, the <b>equalizing</b> <b>basin,</b> the power plant and the reservoir itself, owned by the Federal Waterway and Navigation Authority and managed by its Hann. Münden office. The Diemel Reservoir, along with the Edersee {{is part of the}} water regulation structure in the catchment area of the River Weser.|$|R
50|$|Downstream near Stall the Möll {{waters are}} again impounded into the Gößnitz Reservoir. At Obervellach the river course {{is joined by}} the {{parallel}} Tauern Railway line descending from Mallnitz and the southern Tauern Tunnel portal. Near Kolbnitz and its confluence with the Drava the Möll is once again dammed up to create the Rottau <b>equalizing</b> <b>basin.</b> From here some of the water is diverted to the lower stage of the Malta-Reisseck Power Plant in Möllbrücke.|$|R
40|$|Domestic {{wastewater}} treatment {{was needed for}} every towns. This domestic wastewater such as black water and grey water should treated for not polluted the environment. Magelang was one of town which has have domestic treatment plant with capacity of 20, 5 m 3 /day. This plant done by Dinas Pengendalian Lingkungan Hidup. It had many several series treatment unit consisted of <b>equalizing</b> <b>basin</b> unit, anaerobic lagoon, facultative lagoon, maturation lagoon and sludge drying bed. Further more, after having all of treatment steps, the treated effluent could safely discharged to surface water bodies without causing pollution problem...|$|R
40|$|The textile mill Schiesser Sachsen AG, Niederfrohna, {{installed}} {{a process for}} the purification and re-use of wastewater, which is suited {{for the treatment of}} 2. 500 m" 3 /d. The components of the process are: - Waste water treatment (heat recovery, <b>equalizing</b> <b>basin,</b> active coke supported biology, fluidized bed adsorption, precipitation/flocculation, filtration); - Treatment of the recycled water (sterilization, partial desalination, circular tour of sodium chloride solution); - Sludge treatment (dehydration, drying, thermal regeneration). This processing technique allows: - to change 60 % of the resulting colored effluent into recycled water, which is re-used in textile finishing processes; - to diminish the consumption of sodium chloride about 30 %; - to reduce the requirement of new adsorption material to 70 % by thermal regeneration of the used adsorption material and to reduce to 99, 5 % the space of the dumping ground required for sludge deposition. According to the statement of Schiesser Sachsen AG the savings of power, processing water and waste water fees lead to a depreciation of the installed waste water purifying and re-use process within 8 years, if this device works under full charge.
