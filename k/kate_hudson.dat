500|$|Originally, the American actress <b>Kate</b> <b>Hudson</b> {{was cast}} as Griet, having {{successfully}} pursued the role from the film's producers. In September 2001, however, Hudson pulled out four weeks before filming began, officially due to [...] "creative differences". Hudson's decision scuppered {{the production and}} led to the loss of financial support from the production company Intermedia.

Roxeanne and her sister Isabel (<b>Kate</b> <b>Hudson)</b> dispute the ownership of a painting by Georges de La Tour with the family of Henri's lover. Entertainment Weekly gave the film a [...] "C" [...] rating and lamented Watts' performance: [...] "I'm disappointed to report that Hudson and Watts have no chemistry as sisters, perhaps because Watts never seems like the expatriate artiste she's supposed to be playing".|$|E
500|$|Williams {{was cast}} over <b>Kate</b> <b>Hudson,</b> Scarlett Johansson, and Amy Adams as Marilyn Monroe in My Week with Marilyn, a British drama film {{based on two}} novels by Colin Clark, {{depicting}} {{the making of the}} film The Prince and the Showgirl (1957). Initially terrified of taking on the role, she turned down the offer. [...] "Physically and vocally, everything about her is different from me," [...] she explained. Eventually, she found the offer too good to pass up. Williams took vocal lessons so she could sing in the movie, as lip-syncing was uncomfortable.

During a preview of The 2nd Law on French site Jeuxactu, the song was said to resemble Depeche Mode and described as [...] "calm, languid and sweet". Matthew Bellamy stated that the song started as a personal reflection after a fight with his girlfriend <b>Kate</b> <b>Hudson,</b> and how, after {{she had gone to}} her mother's house, he began to realise [...] "yeah, she was right, wasn't she?" [...] In a separate interview, Bellamy stated the song was the band's attempt to strip down the sound of the album, and that the song has its roots in 12 bar blues with gospel, soul and R influences. He went on to conclude that, [...] "It's the song I'm probably most proud of on the album for sure." ...|$|E
500|$|The initial script of Enchanted, {{written by}} Bill Kelly, {{was bought by}} Disney's Touchstone Pictures and Sonnenfeld/Josephson Productions for a {{reported}} sum of $450,000 in September 1997. However, it {{was thought to be}} unsuitable for Walt Disney Pictures because it was [...] "a racier R-rated movie". To the frustration of Kelly, the screenplay was rewritten several times, first by Rita Hsiao and then by Todd Alcott. The film was initially scheduled to be released in 2002 with Rob Marshall as director but he withdrew due to [...] "creative differences" [...] between the producers and him. In 2001, director Jon Turteltaub was set to direct the film but he left soon after, later working with Disney and Jerry Bruckheimer on the National Treasure franchise.

Her performance was well received among critics; Salon.com wrote: [...] "This {{is the first time in}} which Tyler's acting is a match for her beauty (she's always been a bit forlorn). Altman helps her find some snap, but a relaxed, silly snap, as in the cartoon sound she makes when she takes a midday swig of bourbon. The lazy geniality of the movie is summed up by the way Emma [...] saunters off to take a swim with her cowboy hat and pint of Wild Turkey." [...] Entertainment Weekly also noted that Tyler is [...] "sweetly gruff as the tomboy troublemaker". In the romantic comedy, Dr. T & the Women, she played Marilyn, a gynecological patient of Richard Gere's character and the lesbian lover of his daughter, played by <b>Kate</b> <b>Hudson.</b>|$|E

He became familiar to audiences as one of the main character's co-workers in Apatow's well-reviewed buddy comedy directorial debut feature The 40-Year-Old Virgin (2005). Rogen also co-produced it and improvised all his dialogue. [...] " [...] hadn't done any screen work that indicated he could carry as memorable and convincing a performance as he does with the character Cal," [...] MTV's John Constantine wrote. The Boston Globe reviewer Wesley Morris wrote that Rogen, along with co-stars Rudd and Romany Malco, were each hilarious in their own right and Orlando Sentinel Roger Moore believed that Rogen had his moments in the film whereas Moira Macdonald of the Seattle Times said the actor was [...] "droopily deadpan."

[...] Daniel Brockman of Boston Phoenix writer perceived the song as an [...] "innocuous soft jam." [...] Stacey Anderson of Spin magazine was positive, noting that [...] "it's so well-delivered, in fact, that it's hard to hear." [...] Scott Shetler of Popcrush was receptive with the release of a down-tempo ballad, saying that [...] "it’s refreshing to hear a song built around her impressive voice." [...] Robert Copsey of Digital Spy gave the song four out of five stars, stating it [...] "may pull in the reins as far as the hectic dance beats and sado-masochistic lyrics go, but it's no less beefy and extravagant." [...] He also noted that [...] "he belts out in a range well beyond her natural vocal ability." [...] Thomas Conner of Chicago Sun-Times concluded that [...] "The acoustic strums of 'California King Bed' build to a cinematic, Diane Warren-sized breakup chorus." ...|$|E

She later breaks up with Brody after Santana reveals that he is a male escort and is stunned to find out Finn flew to New York just to beat him up.
