Typographically, they have the width of one CJK character cell (fullwidth form), and follow {{the direction of the}} text, being horizontal for <b>horizontal</b> <b>text,</b> and vertical for columnar.

2500|$|Both {{katakana}} and hiragana usually spell native long vowels {{with the}} addition of a second vowel kana. However, in foreign loanwords katakana instead uses a vowel extender mark, called a chōonpu ("long vowel mark"). This is a short line (ー) following the direction of the text, horizontal for yokogaki (<b>horizontal</b> <b>text),</b> and vertical for tategaki (vertical text). For example, メール mēru is the gairaigo for e-mail taken from the English word [...] "mail"; the ー lengthens the e. There are some exceptions, such as [...] (...) or (...) , where Japanese words written in katakana use the elongation mark, too.|$|E

40|$|Texts {{in natural}} scenes carry rich {{semantic}} information, {{which can be}} used to assist a wide range of applications, such as object recognition, image/video retrieval, mapping/navigation, and human computer interaction. However, most existing systems are designed to detect and recognize <b>horizontal</b> (or near-horizontal) <b>texts.</b> Due to the increasing popularity of mobile-computing devices and applications, detecting texts of varying orientations from natural images under less controlled conditions has become an important but challenging task. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm to detect texts of varying orientations. Our algorithm is based on a two-level classification scheme and two sets of features specially designed for capturing the intrinsic characteristics of texts. To better evaluate the proposed method and compare it with the competing algorithms, we generate a comprehensive dataset with various types of texts in diverse real-world scenes. We also propose a new evaluation protocol, which is more suitable for benchmarking algorithms for detecting texts in varying orientations. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our system compares favorably with the state-of-the-art algorithms when handling <b>horizontal</b> <b>texts</b> and achieves significantly enhanced performance on variant texts i...|$|R

40|$|Most {{state-of-the-art}} text {{detection methods}} {{are specific to}} <b>horizontal</b> Latin <b>text</b> and are not fast enough for real-time applications. We introduce Segment Linking (SegLink), an oriented text detection method. The main idea is to decompose text into two locally detectable elements, namely segments and links. A segment is an oriented box covering {{a part of a}} word or text line; A link connects two adjacent segments, indicating that they belong to the same word or text line. Both elements are detected densely at multiple scales by an end-to-end trained, fully-convolutional neural network. Final detections are produced by combining segments connected by links. Compared with previous methods, SegLink improves along the dimensions of accuracy, speed, and ease of training. It achieves an f-measure of 75. 0 % on the standard ICDAR 2015 Incidental (Challenge 4) benchmark, outperforming the previous best by a large margin. It runs at over 20 FPS on 512 x 512 images. Moreover, without modification, SegLink is able to detect long lines of non-Latin text, such as Chinese. Comment: To Appear in CVPR 201...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Horizontal</b> <b>text</b> {{came into}} Japanese in the Meiji era, when the Japanese began to print Western {{language}} dictionaries.

Because this was unwieldy, the idea of yokogaki came to be accepted. One of the first publications to partially use yokogaki was a German to Japanese dictionary ( [...] , Shūchinsōzu Dokuwa Jisho, [...] "pocket illustrated German to Japanese dictionary") published in 1885 (Meiji 18).|$|E

50|$|Baláž’s works {{brings the}} new {{possibilities}} {{at the field}} of post-conceptual and neo-conceptual text. The exhibition is divided in three segments, {{all of them are}} connected by the specific and authentic search of the possibilities in the conceptual Macaronic language.The first is created from the neo-conceptual horizontal/vertical texts, a part of Treptomachia, (WARTEZEIT, 2006, WARTERAUM, 2006 and How to domesticate the English language, 2006). The internal orientation of artworks, the search of art itself, the search of language and text brings the cracking of syntactic/semantic wholeness of graphems. The metatexts of initial prototext are distinguished by the colors (oil on canvas, 300 x 200 cm).In this regard Baláž's eff ort culminates by the diptych TREPTOMACHIA.EN-A / How to domesticate the English language and TREPTOMACHIA.DE-B / How to domesticate the German language (2006). Both are depicted on big-size canvas, within which the only dominating word with partial messages is replaced with newly defined optical language with tens of words. The colour decomposition of the grapheme creates a symptomatic background for language overlapping and the contamination, which creates the supreme moment of the author's Babylonian crossroads.Another, the second segment, black and white acryl-paintings enriches the former one, the artworks are created on principle of the structuralist analysis of text. It is a variant, which is called and named by author and curator the intext. By the segmentation of text the author discovers several lexis. These have a different lexical origin, five West-European, five East-European, and „dead“ language of Medieval Esperanto - Latin. Despite the cold artificiality of works, this segment has also the hidden sociocritical context, which is oscillated between phenomenons West and East, art and politics.The third segment is the most open and subjective. These <b>horizontal</b> <b>texts</b> are named by its author as the simultaneous texts. It is a different alternative in the post-conceptual Makaronian text, the melange is created by harmony of the initial and derivative text. Its ironic and attacking character replaces a cold aspect of the first two segments. Vajanský’s Suchá ratolesť (an ironic parallel of failing elits) is floundered by streams, the subject is named by the author as east rat in the age of 20-years of wandering a la democrazy, with a more complicated ambivalent reading. The fragility of ground - paper artworks, width 10 m raises the openness of statement, ODRBMADEMOKRATICKY, 2008 me over democratically, is predominative.|$|R
