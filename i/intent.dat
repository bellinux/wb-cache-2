5|$|John Koller {{explains}} {{the role of}} <b>intent</b> in Jainism with {{the example of a}} monk, who unknowingly offered poisoned food to his brethren. According to the Jain view, the monk is guilty of a violent act if the other monks die because they eat the poisoned food; but according to the Buddhist view he would not be guilty. The crucial difference between the two views is that the Buddhist view excuses the act, categorising it as non-intentional, since he was not aware that the food was poisoned; whereas the Jain view holds the monk to have been responsible, due to his ignorance and carelessness. Jains argue that the monk's very ignorance and carelessness constitute an <b>intent</b> to do violence and hence entail his guilt. So the absence of <b>intent</b> does not absolve a person from the karmic consequences of guilt either, according to the Jain analysis.|$|E

40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. A very {{important}} {{advantage of a}} feature-based modelling (FBM) system is claimed to be its ability to capture and carry designer’s <b>intents</b> (DI’s), although this last term is rarely clearly defined. Feature’s extra nongeometrical semantics, that {{are closely related to}} such designer’s <b>intents,</b> are used by many applications but never related back to designer’s <b>intents.</b> Therefore, adopting the approach of defining of designer’s <b>intents</b> helps define the role of features in the geometric design and, indeed, allows future feature-based modelling systems to better represent, store and reuse such information. Moreover, it allows a more formal approach for manipulating, verifying and maintaining DI’s throughout the design process, which is an invaluable support for really intelligent CAD systems. This paper presents Designer’s <b>Intents</b> in the feature-based modelling context and exposes a methodology used to effectivelly capture and manage and verify this extra information...|$|R

40|$|AbstractAs the Internet is {{widespread}} {{and there are}} many online shops in the Internet, many persons buy products in the online shops. Customer's behavior in the online shops is a sequence of customer driven activities intrinsically because his/her movement in an online shop occurs according to only his/her decision. Hence, to achieve satisfactory purchase experiments it is important how the shop supports them. Online shops have to predict visitors’ <b>intents</b> correctly to support them effectively. One of information resources the shops can use is an access log including information on customer's movement in the online shop. If they are histories of customer's behaviors in online shops and the behaviors depend on customer's <b>intents,</b> we can extract new knowledge on them from the access logs. Speaking concretely, we can predict customers’ <b>intents</b> from the access logs since their internal <b>intents</b> affect their activities. We can realized more appropriate recommendation service by changing recommendation strategy depending on customer's <b>intents.</b> In this paper, we propose a method to predict customer's <b>intents</b> from access logs in a real online shop.

The {{integration}} of daylighting {{from the beginning}} of the de-sign process can help designers to create buildings that respect their environment, benefit from the solar gain thus giving an answer to il-lumination and energy needs (Bodart et al, 2002). This paper proposes a declarative assistance method/tool designed for the early design phase. This method assists the designer in integrating the daylight and its energetic impact {{from the beginning of}} the architectural design process by means of <b>intents.</b> The <b>intents</b> are related to the daylight, energy and spatial configuration aspects of the architectural project. The method translates the designer’s <b>intents</b> into potential solutions. They are the first formal representation of the architect’s <b>intents</b> that could be customized and altered during the next architectural design phases...|$|R

In our approach, visual tasks describe presentation <b>intents</b> through their visual accomplishments, and suggest desired visual techniques through their visual implications. Therefore, we can characterize visual tasks by their visual accomplishments and implications. Through this characterization, visual tasks can guide the visual discourse synthesis process by specifying what presentation <b>intents</b> can be achieved and how to achieve them...|$|R

Search result diversification aims to solve this problem, by returning diverse results that can fulfill as many different information needs as possible.

In this paper, we introduce a new hierarchical structure to represent user <b>intents</b> and propose two general hierarchical diversification models to leverage hierarchical <b>intents.</b> Experimental results show that our hierarchical diversification models outperform state-of-the-art diversification methods that use traditional flat subtopics...|$|R
40|$|A {{significant}} portion of web search queries are name entity queries. The major search engines have been exploring various ways to provide better user experiences for name entity queries, such as showing “search tasks ” (Bing search) and showing direct answers (Yahoo!, Kosmix). In order to provide the search tasks or direct answers that can satisfy most popular user <b>intents,</b> we need to capture these <b>intents,</b> together with relationships between them. In this paper we propose an approach for building a hierarchical taxonomy of the generic search <b>intents</b> for a class of name entities (e. g., musicians or cities). The proposed approach can find phrases representing generic <b>intents</b> from user queries, and organize these phrases into a tree, so that phrases indicating equivalent or similar meanings {{are on the same}} node, and the parent-child relationships of tree nodes represent the relationships between search <b>intents</b> and their sub-intents. Three different methods are proposed for tree building, which are based on directed maximum spanning tree, hierarchical agglomerative clustering, and pachinko allocation model. Our approaches are purely based on search logs, and do not utilize any existing taxonomies such as Wikipedia. With the evaluation by human judges (via Mechanical Turk), it is shown that our approaches can build trees of phrases that capture the relationships between important search <b>intents...</b>|$|R

5|$|According to Theravada commentaries, {{there are}} five {{requisite}} factors that must all be fulfilled for an act to be both an act of killing and to be karmically negative.
