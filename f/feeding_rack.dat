The transportation was more complicated and took a longer time than originally thought, but all the animals recovered rapidly after the trip. The wisents were released into the larger fenced area after spending two weeks in the small paddock. They seemed to be able to eat anything, from carrots to old willow branches, dry grass and even pieces of the wooden <b>feeding</b> <b>rack.</b> Unfortunately, the wisents did not sufficiently acclimatize in the first months. They started to moult in November, when temperatures already were down to -30 °C (-35 °F) in Cherskii. The four juveniles died; only the adult bull survived. He is now fully acclimatized.

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} {{the effects of a}} delay (at 09 : 30 instead of 07 : 30 h) in Total Mixed Ration (TMR) delivery on the behaviour, milk yield, and haematological parameters in dairy cows. Twelve healthy Italian Holstein cows, divided into two homogeneous groups of six each, were involved. The TMR delay was applied either for one (on Tuesday; single delay, SD) or for three consecutive days (Tuesday to Thursday; repeated delay, RD) to one group at a time while the other acted as control. A week of pause was interposed between treatments and the order of the treatment was randomised. Behaviour was observed by instantaneous scan sampling every 2 min during seven half-hour periods on Tuesday and Thursday and blood samples were taken at 14 : 30 h on these days. Milk yield was recorded daily. Data were analysed by a mixed models for repeated measurements. The delay caused a marked increase in activities towards the <b>feeding</b> <b>rack</b> prior to feeding on day 1 when delay was applied both as SD (P< 0. 01) and RD (P< 0. 05). On the third day of delay, pre- and post-meal agonistic behaviour increased in delayed cows (P< 0. 01). Milk yield and blood parameters were not affected by the delay. Results suggest that a two hours delay in feeding can affect behaviour in cows, increasing behavioural patterns, which may be a sign of mild frustration...|$|E

40|$|During {{the last}} decades, many dairy farmers have {{actively}} advanced their farms toward automation. Automatic concentrate dispensers and automatic milking {{systems have been}} utilised for years, and several manufacturers have introduced automatic feeding systems (AFS). AFSs allow for the increase in frequency of feed distribution with significant advantages in terms of health and production. Furthermore, they provide a reduction of man labour related to preparation of feed, distribution, and propelling the ration closer to the <b>feeding</b> <b>rack.</b> The present research {{was focused on the}} monitoring of a dairy farm, located in the Veneto region of Italy, during the transition from a conventional feeding system (CFS), based on a tractor operated mixing wagon, to an automatic system equipped with stationary feeding hoppers, mixing unit, and distribution wagon operating on rail. The article reports a comparative analysis of the structural modifications required for the adoption of AFS, including an analysis of the AFS/CFS systems based on their functionality, energy, and man labour requirements. In the case study, AFS represented an affordable way to reduce covered area of the housings, {{as a result of the}} reduction in width of foraging lane and the reduction of manger front length. In addition, AFS demonstrated a reduction in labour requirements and improvement of quality and consistency of work when feeding total mixed ration. Finally, the research was addressed to study dairy cow behaviour. A method for monitoring the feeding, resting, and standing indexes was applied to the CFS farm.

40|$|The Welfare Quality® (WQ) {{protocols}} {{are increasingly}} used for assessing welfare of farm animals. These protocols are time consuming (about one day per farm) and, therefore, costly. Our {{aim was to}} assess the scope for reduction of on-farm assessment time of the WQ protocol for dairy cattle. Seven trained observers quantified animal-based indicators of the WQ protocol in 181 loose-housed and 13 tied Dutch dairy herds (herd size from 10 to 211 cows). Four assessment methods were used: avoidance distance at the <b>feeding</b> <b>rack</b> (ADF, 44 min); qualitative behaviour assessment (QBA, 25 min); behavioural observations (BO, 150 min); and clinical observations (CO, 132 min). To simulate reduction of on-farm assessment time, a set of WQ indicators belonging to one assessment method was omitted from the protocol. Observed values of omitted indicators were replaced by predictions based on WQ indicators of the remaining three assessment methods, resources checklist, and interview, thus mimicking the performance of the full WQ protocol. Agreement between predicted and observed values of WQ indicators, however, was low for ADF, moderate for QBA, slight to moderate for BO, and poor to moderate for CO. It was concluded that replacing animal-based WQ indicators by predictions based on remaining WQ indicators shows little scope for reduction of onfarm assessment time of the Welfare Quality® protocol for dairy cattle. Other ways to reduce on-farm assessment time of the WQ protocol for dairy cattle, {{such as the use of}} additional data or automated monitoring systems, should be investigated. © 2013 Universities Federation for Animal Welfare...|$|E
40|$|In alpine regions, {{cows are}} often {{equipped}} with bells during pasture season {{to ensure that}} farmers can locate them. Constant exposure to the chime of a bell may affect cows’ acoustic perception in general. The {{aim of this study}} is to test whether routine bell exposure affects the reactivity to a noise stimulus and might be associated with hearing impairment in cows. For the assessment, behavioral and cardiac indicators were used as indirect measures of hearing capacity. Cows that were either used to wearing a bell or not were exposed to a playback of low and high amplitude (=varying loudness). In addition, we tested whether wearing earplugs, mimicking hearing impairment, reduced the cows’ reactivity toward the playback. On 24 farms, half of them routinely using cowbells, 96 Brown Swiss cows were tested in a 2 [*]×[*] 2 factorial cross-over design (65 or 85 [*]dB, without or with earplugs) in a balanced order. The effects of bell experience, amplitude, and earplugs on the latency to the first behavioral and cardiac response to a 5 -s playback were analyzed using linear mixed-effects models, considering dependencies within the data set. Cows reacted faster without earplugs and when they were exposed to 85 [*]dB compared with 65 [*]dB. The proportion of cows leaving the <b>feeding</b> <b>rack</b> after onset of the playback was reduced by bell experience and earplugs and was increased when exposed to 85 [*]dB compared with 65 [*]dB. Exposure without earplugs to 85 [*]dB but not to 65 [*]dB increased heart rate. Heart rate and heart rate variability indicated increased sympathetic activation during the exposure to 85 [*]dB compared with 65 [*]dB. In general, behavioral and cardiac indicators did not indicate severe hearing impairment due to routine bell exposure. The 85 -dB stimulus increased arousal and avoidance compared with the 65 -dB stimulus, with bell experience and earplugs leading to a general decrease in avoidance of the stimulus. This may reflect an altered acoustic perception of the playback stimulus in dairy cows that are routinely exposed to bells...|$|E

These stables covered approximately 182,986 square feet, had floors sloped for drainage, and could contain about 480 horses.Free-standing stables began to be built from the 16th century. They were well built and placed near the house due to the value that the horses had as draught animals.

40|$|As {{part of a}} {{research}} project on feasibility of loose housing systems in The Netherlands, financed by the Dutch Dairy Board (PZ) and Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality (LNV), an international inventory on experiences {{with this kind of}} housing system for dairy cows took place. Data and experiences from Israël, United States of America, Germany, France and Ireland were included and are presented in this report. Sources of information were, scientific journals, applied agricultural papers, conferences, meetings and two trips to Israël and United States. The changes from free stall housing system to in Israel was driven by new regulation on slurry handling and prevention of slurry run off to surface water. The lying area has a surface of dried manure and provides a cow with up to 20 m 2. Twice a day this bedding is tilled to increase evaporation. Due to the arid climate in Israël the bedding becomes dry even when, as is done at some farms, the slurry from the feeding lane is put on the lying area. The changes in the USA were primarily initiated by farmers who wanted better production, well'being and health for their herds. The lying area is smaller (around 7 ' 10 m 2 per cow) and is a combination of sawdust and slurry. This bedding is tilled twice a day during milking and starts composting. The loose housing system in Germany is based on the system in the USA. The loose housing system in Ireland and France is called `out wintering pads¿ and is a alternative for either free stall housing or pasturing during winter. Out wintering pads are a fenced bedding area without roof. The bedding consist of wood chips with drainage underneath and a concrete walking lane behind the <b>feeding</b> <b>rack.</b> Manure is washed into the drainage system. For all different loose housing systems some data are available. The compost barns in the USA are monitored most intensively by the University of Minnesota. General outcomes of monitoring programs and experiences points to an improvement of animal well'being and health without negative effects on milk quality.

40|$|Human-animal {{relationships}} {{are essential for}} dairy farming. They affect work comfort and efficiency, as well as milk production. A poor human-animal relation- ship can result in stress and accidents to both animals and caretakers {{and needs to be}} improved. However, many studies have demonstrated the multifactorial- ity of these relationships. We aimed at assessing the relative importance of the various factors expected to be associated with poor human-animal relationships. On 118 dairy farms, we applied a standardized avoid- ance distance test to cows at the <b>feeding</b> <b>rack.</b> The sample of farms covered a wide range of situations: lowland versus highland, small versus medium size farms, cubicles versus deep-bedded systems, milking parlor versus automatic milking systems, and Holstein versus Montbéliarde breeds. We used Poisson regres- sion to analyze the links between the number of cows that accepted being touched, and farm characteristics, animals, management, and farmers’ attitudes. A mul- tivariate analysis yielded a final model that explained 32. 7 % of the variability between farms. Calving condi- tions (“Main calving location” and “Cleaning or adding litter after calving”) accounted for {{a significant part of the}} variability observed (respectively 25. 8 and 13. 6 % of variability explained by the model, SSB). Fewer cows accepted being touched on farms where the main calv- ing location was in the barn, and where farmers cleaned or added litter after calving. The proportion of cows that accepted being touched increased with the propor- tion of lean cows in the herd (18. 8 %), with worker/cow ratio on the farm (11. 7 %), when farmers considered “health” or “human-cow relationships” as most impor- tant issues for farm success (10. 4 %), and with farm- ers’ years of experience (10. 8 %). Farmers with more negative behavioral attitudes toward cows had a lower proportion of cows that accepted being touched (8. 9 %). In conclusion, the human-animal relationship was not found to be associated with farm characteristics (e. g., housing or milking system) but varied with farmers’ attitudes and management. We confirm that cows’ fear of people is linked to negative attitudes displayed by caretakers toward cows, and is reduced in farms where several caretakers are present. Our study also suggests further exploring the key role of factors linked to calv- ing conditions, as cows are more likely to be afraid of people when disturbed at calvin...|$|E
40|$|Feeding {{operations}} in dairy cow farms are of strategic {{importance for the}} economy of the farm. In addition to being strictly related to the productivity of the cows, feeding represents one of the greater costs for farms, considering that more than 25 % of labour time is dedicated to this operation. In a context characterized by the need for maintaining high production standards and of decreasing the costs, the adoption of automated systems for the preparation and distribution of the total mixed ration (TMR) can represent a valid solution, especially in specialized farms. Automatic Feeding Systems (AFS) allow for the increase in frequency of feed distribution with a consequent optimization of dry matter ingestion by the animals, and simultaneously, assist with maintaining a higher stability of ruminal pH along with significant advantages in terms of health and production. Furthermore, they provide a reduction of man labour related to preparation of feed, distribution, and to propel the ration closer to the <b>feeding</b> <b>rack.</b> The present research was focused on monitoring of a dairy farm, located in the Veneto region of Italy, during the transition from a conventional feeding system (CFS), represented by a tractor-operated mixing wagon, to an automatic system equipped with stationary feeding hoppers, a mixing unit and distribution wagon operating on rail. The paper reports a comparative analysis of the functionality of the two systems, including energy consumption and man labor, for preparation and distribution of the TMR. Despite the initial capital investment and maintenance, expenditures have not been taken into account in this study, AFS represent an innovative way to reduce the labour requirements and the improve quality and consistency of work when feeding TMR. In particular, labour was reduced from 2. 5 h·day- 1 related to the CFS to 1. 02 h·day- 1 needed for the management of the AFS. The AFS also demonstrated, to be of interest, with regard to an economic point of view, reducing the costs for preparation and distribution of the TMR. The CFS, in fact, showed a cost of 1. 44 EUR·m- 3 and 0. 16 EUR·cow- 1 per day, and the consumption of energy of 24. 66 kWh·m- 3 and 2. 74 kWh·cow- 1 per day, while the AFS revealed a cost of 0. 91 EUR·m- 3 of TMR and 0. 10 EUR·cow- 1 per day, and the specific energy consumption of 6. 81 kWh·m- 3 of TMR and 0. 76 kWh·cow- 1 per da...|$|E

40|$|Tooth wear {{is often}} {{suggested}} {{as an important}} factor limiting {{the life span of}} free-ranging wildlife. Given the frequent occurrence of poor dental health in captive animals reported in the literature, one would expect tooth health to be a limiting factor in captivity as well. Additionally, it could be assumed that brachydont (browsing) animals are more susceptible to dental health problems than are hypsodont (grazing) animals, given current indications for systematic increased tooth wear in some browsing species. A pilot survey of necropsy reports of adult captive wild ruminants (n = 294, 12 species) in one facility was performed in order to test these hypotheses and to calculate the incidence of irregular tooth wear. The overall incidence of irregular tooth wear was 20 %, with a very high proportion of reports that did not mention the teeth at all. In contrast to this study's hypotheses, animals with irregular tooth wear were older than animals that died from other causes, indicating that reaching above-average age was a prerequisite for the development of reported abnormalities in this data set. A grazing species (blackbuck, Antilope cervicapra) was most affected, whereas two browsing species were not affected. Affected species had been regularly fed on sandy soil, whereas browsers had received <b>feeds</b> from <b>racks,</b> indicating that husbandry practices are most important for dental health. There was a high proportion of reported serous fat atrophy in animals with irregular tooth wear, indicating the clinical relevance of the problem.

40|$|A {{system of}} {{wintering}} and calving beef cows on a sawdust cattle pad was {{compared with the}} traditional method of wintering unsupplemented cows on hill country pasture. Comparisons were made over four years, beginning in 1970. Two herds of Angus beef cows {{were used in the}} experiment. One herd was originally the Massey University Stud herd, which included approximately 50 cows aged from three to ten. Three-year-old replacements were added to this herd each year. This herd was designated the Stud herd. The other herd designated the Commercial herd, was based on 67 yearling heifers bought in 1969. These cows were all of the same age, and no replacements were added. In 1969 25 cows from this herd were mated to calve at two-years-of-age. The two herds were run together as one unit during the trial, distinction only being made for the purpose of statistical analysis. The pad consists of two yards with sawdust packed on top of tile drains. A concrete apron runs along the side where the <b>feeding</b> <b>racks</b> are situated. A stand of pampas grass protects the pad from the prevailing wind. Half gates were installed, and the bottom rails of the yard were removed to allow the calves to get out and creep feed on the adjoining pasture. Three weeks before calving begins cows were allotted to the pad or the hill treatment using a table of random numbers. In 1971, 1972, 1973 a switchover design was adopted, whereby some animals alternated between the two treatments in successive years, while others wintered on the same treatments. Over 1970 the cows were confined all the time. In 1971 the cows on pad I were allowed to break feed saved pasture over a week. In 1972 and 1973 the cows and calves were removed from the pad for three and four days after birth respectively. This enabled the calf to obtain colostrum without interference, allowed the cow to build up reserves of vitamin A, helped form a bond between the calf and its mother, and enabled the calf to have the benefit of a healthier environment for the first days of its life. This practice appeared to have some merit in reducing the incidence of calf scours. While confined the cows were fed hay, barley straw, and barley meal. In 1970 some experimentation in feeding levels was necessary, and in 1971, 1972 and 1973, 4. 3 kg hay, 2. 3 kg barley straw and 0. 6 kg of barley meal per head per day were fed. In 1972 and 1973 feeding once a day was compared with feeding the same ration once every second day. Before the cows were confined, the top three inches of sawdust was removed and the sawdust and timberwork sprayed with a 10 % solution Of formalin. In 1973 the concrete apron was scraped off weekly with a tractor and blade. Milk determinations were made by the weigh-nurse-weigh method following a 16 hour separation. The cows entered the pad about the second week in July, and remained there until the end of September, when they joined their contemporaries on the hill. Generally the cows wintered on the pad lost more weight than the cows grazed on the hill, although the magnitude of the weight lost varied considerably between years. Birth weights of the calves born on the pad were generally about 2 kg below that of the calves born on the hill. However, there were no clear differences between treatments for the weaning weights. Limited information gathered on the cow milk production indicated that although milk weights of the cows on the pad were lower during confinement, handicapping the growth of their calves, there appeared to be a surge of milk production in these animals upon their release to the hill pasture, in some years. This resulted in an increased growth rate of the calves from the pad at this time. Reproductive performance of the three-year-old and mature cows as measured by thoir calving interval was unaffected by the winter treatments. The performance of the first calving two-year-old heifers from the Commercial herd in 1970 was adversely affected by the pad treatment. Birth weights and weaning weights were reduced and 26. 5 % of the heifers failed to rebreed the following season. Nevertheless subsequent performance demonstrated no further effect of calving at two-years-of-age under adverse conditions. There was no effect on the calf performance of feeding everyday against feeding every second day. Neither was calf performance affected by any of the switching treatments imposed between years. Differences due to the effect of sex and age of dam were similar to those reported in the literature for birth weight and weaning weight. As the four-year-old dams performed surprisingly well in this study an age-of-dam x treatment interaction was suspected. There was an indeterminate effect of sex on the milk yield of the dam. Regressions involving the age of the calf on the weight at various points revealed a strong association of growth with climatic variables. Since the period under study included stormy weather and long droughts this complicated the evaluation of calf growth data. It was concluded that the pad system of wintering and calving beef cows can be operated as a commercial system in the manner described. A discussion of pad husbandry is given, and recommendations are made...|$|R

The dispersal of seed and establishment of plants within traditionally managed hay meadows is an important area of study because of the problems associated with attempts to re-create meadows in the Pennines and throughout the UK, an important goal of agri-environment schemes. Field, glasshouse and laboratory experiments are described which attempt to establish the viable seed content in samples of hay from botanically diverse meadows and how subsequent feeding to livestock affects the viable seed content of the farmyard manure produced. The experiments also explored the extent to which seed remained viable during the time that manure was stored prior to spreading, thus affecting its capacity to germinate once spread or to become incorporated into the soil seed bank. The spreading of farmyard manure has often been observed to create bare patches within the meadow vegetation. It was therefore hypothesised that these patches may be suitable niches for the germination of seeds from within the manure itself or from the soil seed bank, and this was investigated using field experimentation. Comparison of the original vegetation with the viable seed content of hay, manure and dung from cattle fed exclusively on meadow hay from two traditionally managed sources produced some interesting results. The meadow vegetation contained a range of prominent perennial herbs such as Geranium sylvaticum, Sanguisorba officinalis and Filipendula ulmaria which are considered to be important from a conservation management viewpoint. However, germination of the seed within the hay cut from these meadows failed to provide any evidence for the occurrence of such species within the hay. Either the typical mid July hay cut comes before these species produce ripe seed or the seed was lost from the hay during the turning and baling operations. Viable seeds of the early flowering annual herb Rhinanthus minor, which is also considered by ecologists to be desirable, were also absent from the hay. The most abundant species in the hay were generally grasses, with Poa trivialis especially prominent, and less important, often annual, herb species. The feeding of this hay to cattle and subsequent germination of seed within the dung showed that the digestive system of the cattle was extremely damaging to seed viability. Proportionally P. trivialis became even more dominant within the dung samples with many of the less common species in the hay failing to have any viable seed within the dung. In contrast to the dung, the fresh manure collected from the two farms contained a larger quantity of seed, and more species than the dung. These samples were in fact more comparable to the hay samples in terms of species composition although not quantity. This suggests that the majority of the viable seed which is incorporated into manure does not pass through the digestive tract of the livestock, but rather falls directly from <b>feed</b> <b>racks</b> onto the barn floor. Confirmation of the negative effect of the digestive processes of cattle on seed viability was achieved in a laboratory experiment. A three stage process was used to mimic the effects of chewing, rumen digestion and post ruminal digestion. Five species were tested; two grasses P. trivlalis and Anthoxanthum odoratum which occurred within the hay samples, the annual herb Myosotis arvensis which was found within hay samples and two perennial herbs F. ulmaria and S. officinalis which were absent from the hay samples. Whilst the effects of chewing and ruminal digestion varied between the five species tested the post ruminal digestion was extremely damaging in all five species. These results suggested that the prominence of P. trivialis in dung samples was due more to the high quantity of seed within the hay rather than to any increased ability to survive digestion. The perennial herbs, F. ulmaria and S. officinalis were able to survive digestion at least as well as P. trivialis and so given appropriate management of hay cut timing could become incorporated into manure for subsequent dispersal via this route. By comparing the viable seed content of fresh" manure with that in samples stored for 3 months, 6 months and 12 months it was clear that the seed content of the manure did not reduce until it had been stored for a period longer than 6 months. Once again those species with the greatest quantity of seed in fresh manure were the ones which were able to survive within the older manure samples. The burial in manure of known quantities of the same seeds as used in the laboratory digestion experiment confirmed this result, and also showed that herb species absent from the hay and manure are at least as capable of survival within manure heaps as species such as P. trivialis which dominated the manure samples collected from farms. In order to assess the role that manure application to meadows may have in supplying seed to the soil seed bank, soil cores were extracted from the meadows at the two farms used in the study and the seed content estimated by seed germination. The soil seed bank contained all of the species found within the manure samples as well as a range of earlier flowering species including the annual herb R. minor. Again the longer lived perennial herb species valued from a bio-diversity perspective were largely absent from the soil seed bank or only present in very low quantities. The species make up of the seed bank within these diverse hay meadow communities was found to be more akin to the species make up of species poor pasture communities. This suggests that seed set by many of the ecologically desirable species is not a regular occurrence within Pennine meadows. The large quantity of seed of certain species found within manure applied to the meadows means that it could play a significant role in the build up of seed within the soil seed bank, although these species may be expected to be recruited to the soil seed bank via other routes such as seed rain during the period of crop growth and the hay making operations. Field experimentation with observation of the colonisation of gaps created by farmyard manure application showed that vegetation colonising these gaps did not compare to the seed content of the manure or the soil seed bank, but rather the surrounding vegetation. Colonisation of these gaps did not give rise to vegetation containing a higher quantity of species indicative of the manure or soil seed content. Perennial herb species absent from both the manure and the soil seed bank were amongst the colonisers of the these gaps suggesting that vegetative re-growth is an important process in the maintenance of long term botanical diversity within such meadows. Whilst it remains possible that during years when the hay cut is later than usual, seed production and subsequent incorporation into the hay of more desirable later flowering herbs could occur, the overwhelming weight of evidence suggests that the farmyard manure from cattle fed meadow hay is not a significant contributor to the dispersal of ecologically valuable components of meadow vegetation.
