5|$|By {{the time}} of season two's nineteenth episode, the writers had decided Helen's fate. Originally, the {{character}} {{was going to die}} on her wedding night, but the creative team felt they could use her more in the mythology. Gough explains the idea Helen still had Clark's blood, she knew his secret, and her relationship with Lex was too good to write off. The creative team kept Helen's true motivations a secret to Vaugier, which the actress enjoyed because it allowed her to play the character as <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>no</b> ulterior motives.|$|E
5|$|By custom {{there were}} seven {{conditions}} where a man could divorce his wife. These were: (1) disobedience to parents-in-law, (2) barrenness (unable to continue family line), (3) adultery (mixing another clan's blood into the family), (4) jealousy (of concubines), (5) incurable disease (unable to continue family line), (6) loquacity (not getting along with brothers-in-law or sisters-in-law), and (7) theft. However, a husband {{was not allowed to}} divorce his wife if she had completed three years of mourning for one of his deceased parents, <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>no</b> living relatives in her father's family to return to, or if the husband's family was originally poor but became rich after marriage. Sometimes women were also able to initiate the divorce and remarry if the husband's family was in poverty, he was diseased, or his in-laws were too abusive. Although remarriage was frowned upon (especially since divorce meant a wife took away her dowry wealth from her ex-husband's family), it was nonetheless common amongst divorcees and widowers in all social groups.|$|E
5|$|By {{virtue of}} a Hindu belief that {{killing of a}} brahmin (Bramhatya) was a sin, capital {{punishment}} was not applicable to them. Upper caste kshatriyas (satkshatriya) were also exempt from capital punishment due to their higher position in the caste system. Severe crimes committed were punishable by the severing of a foot or hand. Contemporary literary sources reveal up to ten castes in the Hindu caste system; three among kshatriya, three among brahmin, two among vaishya and two among shudras. Family laws permitted a wife or daughter or surviving relatives of a deceased person to claim properties such as his home, land, grain, money etc. <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>no</b> male heirs. If no claimants to the property existed, the state took possession of these properties as Dharmadeya (charitable asset). Intercaste marriage, child marriage, marriage of a boy to maternal uncles daughter, Svayamvara marriage (where the bride garlands her choice of a groom from among many aspirants) were all in vogue. Memorials containing hero stones (virkal) were erected for fallen heroes and the concerned family received monetary aid for maintenance of the memorial.|$|E

25|$|Around {{the turn}} of the century, Boltzmann's science was being {{threatened}} by another philosophical objection.

This movement around 1900 deeply depressed Boltzmann since it could mean the end of his kinetic theory and statistical interpretation of the second law of thermodynamics.|$|E

Before the refurbishment program, the train's only power sockets for passengers were located in the conference compartment.|$|E
25|$|Israeli forces did on occsasion expel Palestinians. But this {{accounted}} for {{only a small fraction}} of the total exodus, occurred not within the framework of a premeditated plan but in the heat of battle, and was dictated predominantly by military ad hoc considerations (notably the need to deny strategic sites to the enemy <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>no</b> available Jewish forces to hold them).... Indeed, even the largest expulsions, during the battle for Lydda in July 1948, emanated from a string of unexpected developments on the ground and in no way foreseen in military plans for the capture of the town.|$|E
25|$|Real amplitudes differ considerably, {{not only}} because of depth {{variations}} and continental obstacles, but also because wave propagation across the ocean has a natural period of the same order of magnitude as the rotation period: <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>no</b> land masses, it would take about 30 hours for a long wavelength surface wave to propagate along the equator halfway around the Earth (by comparison, the Earth's lithosphere has a natural period of about 57 minutes). Earth tides, which raise and lower the bottom of the ocean, and the tide's own gravitational self attraction are both significant and further complicate the ocean's response to tidal forces.|$|E

25|$|A third {{model is}} the geoid, a more complex and {{accurate}} representation of Earth's shape coincident with what mean sea level would be <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>no</b> winds, tides, or land. Compared to the best fitting ellipsoid, a geoidal model would change the characterization of important properties such as distance, conformality and equivalence. Therefore, in geoidal projections that preserve such properties, the mapped graticule would deviate from a mapped ellipsoid's graticule. Normally the geoid is not used as an Earth model for projections, however, because Earth's shape is very regular, with the undulation of the geoid amounting to less than 100m from the ellipsoidal model out of the 6.3millionm Earth radius. For irregular planetary bodies such as asteroids, however, sometimes models analogous to the geoid are used to project maps from.|$|E
25|$|Over time, {{however, the}} {{pheromone}} trail starts to evaporate, thus reducing its attractive strength. The more {{time it takes}} for an ant to travel down the path and back again, the more time the pheromones have to evaporate. A short path, by comparison, gets marched over more frequently, and thus the pheromone density becomes higher on shorter paths than longer ones. Pheromone evaporation also has the advantage of avoiding the convergence to a locally optimal solution. <b>If</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>no</b> evaporation at all, the paths chosen by the first ants would tend to be excessively attractive to the following ones. In that case, the exploration of the solution space would be constrained. The influence of pheromone evaporation in real ant systems is unclear, but it is very important in artificial systems.|$|E
25|$|The {{propagation}} (as well as reflection coefficient) of {{the ordinary}} ray is simply described by no as <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>no</b> birefringence involved. However the extraordinary ray, as its name suggests, propagates unlike any wave in a homogenous optical material. Its refraction (and reflection) at a surface can be understood using the effective refractive index (a value in between no and ne). However {{it is in fact}} an inhomogeneous wave whose power flow (given by the Poynting vector) is not exactly {{in the direction of the}} wave vector. This causes an additional shift in that beam, even when launched at normal incidence, as is popularly observed using a crystal of calcite as photographed above. Rotating the calcite crystal will cause one of the two images, that of the extraordinary ray, to rotate slightly around that {{of the ordinary}} ray, which remains fixed.|$|E
