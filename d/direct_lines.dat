5|$|A long-distance {{communication}} system that used {{smoke and mirrors}} existed in the region, and <b>direct</b> <b>lines</b> of sight have been established between Pueblo Alto, Huérfano Mountain in northern New Mexico, and Chimney Rock Pueblo in southern Colorado. Messages could have been relayed between these three points within minutes. On the mesa behind Chaco Canyon is an ancient road that runs north from Chetro Ketl, then northward along {{the east side of}} Pueblo Alto before joining with the Great North Road. The Pueblo Alto road network functioned between 1050 and 1140. It facilitated access to watering holes, terraced farming areas, and enabled interaction between Pueblo Alto and great houses like Pueblo Bonito and Chetro Ketl. It also led to a community along Escavada Wash. It may have served an important function in the transport of household goods, construction timber, and people throughout the San Juan Basin. Several road segments appear to be related to a row of Chetro Ketl's exterior rooms, which are thought to have been community storage space.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} the localization of stiff <b>directed</b> <b>lines</b> with bending energy by a short-range random potential. Using perturbative arguments, Flory arguments, and a replica calculation, {{we show that}} a stiff <b>directed</b> <b>line</b> in 1 +d dimensions undergoes a localization transition with increasing disorder for $d> 2 / 3 $. We demonstrate that this transition is accessible by numerical transfer matrix calculations in 1 + 1 dimensions and analyze {{the properties of the}} disorder-dominated phase. On the basis of the two-replica problem, we propose a relation between the localization of stiff <b>directed</b> <b>lines</b> in 1 +d dimensions and of <b>directed</b> <b>lines</b> under tension in 1 + 3 d dimensions, which is strongly supported by identical free energy distributions. This shows that pair interactions in the replicated Hamiltonian determine the nature of <b>directed</b> <b>line</b> localization transitions with consequences for the critical behavior of the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation. Furthermore, we quantify how the persistence length of the stiff <b>directed</b> <b>line</b> is reduced by disorder. Comment: 5 pages, 4 figure...|$|R

In this {{paper we address}} the above questions characterizing partial <b>directed</b> <b>line</b> (PDL) graphs, i. e., partial subgraph of <b>directed</b> <b>line</b> graphs. We show that for such class of graphs a forbidden configuration criterion and a Krausz's like theorem are equivalent characterizations.

25|$|The main {{system can}} be traced back to 1891, when the {{northern}} line was built between San Juan (Martín Peña sector) and the town of Manatí. The system was expanded to include all the western coastal towns, providing a link which would allow passengers to travel between the northern and southern parts of the island in less than a day for the first time in its history.

500|$|Wolves are {{difficult}} to hunt because of their elusiveness, sharp senses, high endurance, and ability to quickly incapacitate and kill hunting dogs. Historic methods include killing of spring-born litters in their dens, coursing with dogs (usually combinations of sighthounds, bloodhounds and fox terriers), poisoning with strychnine, and [...] trapping. A popular method of wolf hunting in Russia involves trapping a pack within a small area by encircling it with fladry poles carrying a human scent. This method relies heavily on the wolf's fear of human scents, though it can lose its effectiveness when wolves become accustomed to the smell. Some hunters are able to lure wolves by imitating their calls. In Kazakhstan and Mongolia, wolves are traditionally hunted with eagles and falcons, though this practise is declining, as experienced falconers are becoming few in number. Shooting wolves from aircraft is highly effective, due to increased visibility and <b>direct</b> <b>lines</b> of fire, but is controversial. Several types of dog, including like the Borzoi, Irish wolfhound, and Kyrgyz Tajgan, have been specifically bred for wolf hunting.|$|E

On 19 August 1942 – {{only two days}} after Łomazy – 3,000 Jews were deported from Parczew (2,000 more, several days later); from Międzyrzec 11,000 Jews were sent to Treblinka on August 2526 amid gunfire and screams. From Radzyń 6,000 prisoners, then from Łuków (7,000), Końskowola (2,000 coupled with massacre at the hospital), Komarówka, Tomaszów; all those unable to move or attempting to flee were shot on the spot. At the end of August death transports were temporarily halted. After a brief respite, shootings of Jews resumed on 22 September in Serokomla, than in Talczyn and in the Kock ghetto four days later, by the Second Company. The treatment of condemned prisoners was getting increasingly more terrifying as the time went on. [...] In Izbica, the makeshift ghetto reached a breaking point packed by Gnade with Jewish inhabitants of Biała Podlaska, Komarówka, Wohyń, Czemierniki. The October and November deportations to Bełżec and Sobibór led to a week of mass killings at the cemetery beginning on 2 November 1942. Several thousand Jews (estimated at 4,500) from the transit ghetto were massacred by the Sonderdienst battalion of Ukrainian Trawnikis in an assembly-line-style and dumped in hastily excavated mass graves under total police control. All men drank heavily.|$|E
2500|$|In {{a direct}} {{response}} to Kroenig, Colin Kahl, Associate Professor in the Security Studies Program at Georgetown University's Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service, argues that war with Iran should be a last resort. Kahl notes that while the IAEA has [...] "documented Iranian efforts to achieve the capacity {{to develop nuclear weapons}} at some point…there is no hard evidence that Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has yet made the final decision to develop them," [...] making Kroenig’s claim of the urgent need to bomb Iran dubious. Kahl also notes that Kroenig conflates the supposed timelines to produce weapons-grade uranium and the actual construction of a nuclear bomb. He also takes serious issue with Kroenig's contention that the United States could manage the escalation in a war with Iran: [...] " [...] picture of a clean, calibrated conflict is a mirage. Any war with Iran would be a messy and extraordinarily violent affair, with significant casualties and consequences." [...] Kahl says that Kroenig's argument—that a nuclear-armed Iran would behave in a deeply irrational manner but remain cool and decide not to fully escalate in the face of U.S. airstrike—is ironic. The lack of <b>direct</b> <b>lines</b> of communication between Tehran and Washington, coupled with the usual fog of war, makes Kroenig's [...] "proscribed limits exceedingly difficult." [...] Kroenig’s biggest mistake, Kahl maintains, is harboring the same mindset of Iraq war advocates who ignored all postwar scenarios. Therefore, given the myriad of uncertainties, Kahl argues that war should be the last resort.|$|E

To begin with, they advised that the course should be laid so as to pass a short distance east of Astropalaia. This, they said, had long been one of the headquarters of piracy. It had, before the war began, been several times attacked by Turkish or European ships of war, the craft found there burnt, and the coast villages destroyed; but since then it was believed that it had again become the headquarters of pirates from some of the other islands, as its position was a favourable one for attack, lying in the <b>direct</b> <b>lines</b> of traffic between both Constantinople and Greece and the eastern trades with Rhodes, Cyprus, Syria, or Egypt.|$|E
60|$|We {{were now}} about 1000 leagues farther from home, than when at Bengal.

Upon these hopes, we resolved to continue; and, to divert ourselves, we took several little journies in the country. About ten days after we parted with the ship, we travelled to see the city of Nanquin. The city lies in latitude 30 degrees north of the line: it is regularly built, and the streets are exactly straight, and cross one another in <b>direct</b> <b>lines,</b> which sets it out to the greatest advantage. At our return, we found the priest was come from Macao, that was to accompany Father Simon to Pekin. That Father earnestly solicited me to accompany him, & I referred him to my partner.

60|$|The church {{stood in}} {{the centre of the}} highway, and near one end of the hamlet. In the {{exterior}} and ornaments of the important temple, the taste of the times had been fastidiously consulted, its form and simplicity furnishing no slight resemblance to the self-denying doctrines and quaint humors of the religionists who worshipped beneath its roof. The building, like all the rest, was of wood, and externally of two stories. It possessed a tower, without a spire; the former alone serving to betray its sacred character. In the construction of this edifice, especial care had been taken to eschew all deviations from <b>direct</b> <b>lines</b> and right angles. Those narrow-arched passages for the admission of light, that are elsewhere so common, were then thought, by the stern moralists of New-England, to have some mysterious connexion with her of the scarlet mantle. The priest would as soon have thought of appearing before his flock in the vanities of stole and cassock, as the congregation of admitting the repudiated ornaments into the outline of their severe architecture. Had the Genii of the Lamp suddenly exchanged the windows of the sacred edifice with those of the inn that stood nearly opposite, the closest critic of the settlement could never have detected the liberty, since, in the form, dimensions, and style of the two, there was no visible difference.|$|E
