Many problems concerning inequalities for the power <b>exponential</b> <b>functions</b> look so simple, but their solutions are not as simple as it seems. A lot of interesting results for inequalities with the power <b>exponential</b> <b>functions</b> have been obtained. The history and a literature review of inequalities with power <b>exponential</b> <b>functions</b> can be found for example in [1]. Some other interesting problems concerning stronger inequalities of power <b>exponential</b> <b>functions</b> can be found in [2]. In the paper, we study one inequality conjectured by Cîrtoaje [3]. Cîrtoaje, in [3], has posted the following conjecture on the inequalities with power <b>exponential</b> <b>functions.</b>|$|R
