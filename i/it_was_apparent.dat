5|$|The latter {{three were}} {{canceled}} {{before reaching the}} market. By 1997, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>apparent</b> that the IA-64 architecture and the compiler were {{much more difficult to}} implement than originally thought, and the delivery timeframe of Merced began slipping.|$|E
5|$|In 1996 Canberra {{became the}} first {{city in the world}} to set a vision of no waste, proposing an ambitious target of 2010 for completion. The {{strategy}} aimed to achieve a waste-free society by 2010, through the combined efforts of industry, government and community. By early 2010, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>apparent</b> that though it had reduced waste going to landfill, the ACT initiative's original 2010 target for absolutely zero landfill waste would be delayed or revised to meet the reality.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} years at Croydon, girls tended to be {{enrolled}} at an older age, typically over fourteen. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>apparent</b> that despite Marden's insistence, many parents viewed the College as a finishing school. As today, {{it was not a}} requirement for students to be Presbyterians, and early school records indicate {{there were a number of}} Roman Catholic and Jewish students. By 1900 the reputation of the school had spread, and pupils were starting to come from a wider geographic area, including New Caledonia, Fiji, New Zealand, the Northern Territory, Western Australia, Queensland and South Australia.|$|E
5|$|Mustelids {{have never}} colonised Stewart Island/Rakiura, but feral cats were present. During a survey, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>apparent</b> that cats killed kakapo {{at a rate}} of 56% per year. At this rate, the birds could not survive on the island and {{therefore}} an intensive cat control was introduced in 1982, after which no cat-killed kakapo were found. However, to ensure the survival of the remaining birds, scientists decided later that this population should be transferred to predator-free islands; this operation was carried out between 1982 and 1997.|$|E
5|$|The Danish cavalry, {{under the}} Duke of Württemberg-Neuenstadt (not to be {{confused}} with the Duke of Württemberg who fought with Eugene), had made slow work of crossing the Nebel near Oberglau; harassed by Marsin's infantry near the village, the Danes were driven back across the stream. Count Horn's Dutch infantry managed to push the French back from the water's edge, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>apparent</b> that before Marlborough could launch his main effort against Tallard, Oberglauheim would have to be secured.|$|E

5|$|The NK 2nd Division {{made a new}} effort {{against the}} 23rd Infantry's {{perimeter}} in the predawn hours of September 8, {{in an attempt to}} break through eastward. This attack, launched at 02:30 and heavily supported with artillery, penetrated F Company. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>apparent</b> that unless F Company's position could be restored the entire regimental front would collapse. When all its officers became casualties, First Lieutenant Ralph R. Robinson, adjutant of the 2nd Battalion, assumed command of the company.|$|E
5|$|By 9:00am <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>apparent</b> {{that the}} two gunmen possessed {{superior}} weapons and ample ammunition. The police officers in charge on the scene, Superintendent Mulvaney and Chief Superintendent Stark, contacted Assistant Commissioner Major Frederick Wodehouse at Scotland Yard. He telephoned the Home Office and obtained permission from Churchill {{to bring in a}} detachment of Scots Guards, who were stationed at the Tower of London. It {{was the first time that}} the police had requested military assistance in London to deal with an armed siege. Twenty-one volunteer marksmen from the Guards arrived at about 10:00am and took firing positions at each end of the street and in the houses opposite. The shooting continued without either side gaining any advantage.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{affection for}} Mary, Henry was deeply {{disappointed}} that his marriage had produced no sons. By the time Mary {{was nine years}} old, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>apparent</b> that Henry and Catherine would have no more children, leaving Henry without a legitimate male heir. In 1525, Henry sent Mary to the border of Wales to preside, presumably in name only, over the Council of Wales and the Marches. She was given her own court based at Ludlow Castle {{and many of the}} royal prerogatives normally reserved for the Prince of Wales. Vives and others called her the Princess of Wales, although she was never technically invested with the title. She appears to have spent three years in the Welsh Marches, making regular visits to her father's court, before returning permanently to the home counties around London in mid-1528.|$|E

5|$|In 1859 Francis D'Arcy-Osborne, the Duke of Leeds, died, leaving Conisbrough to his nephew, Sackville Lane-Fox, the Baron Conyers. The keep {{remained}} in good condition, but by 1884 <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>apparent</b> that repairs were needed and the antiquarian George Clark recommended urgent work {{to repair the}} stonework. If finances allowed it, he also urged the reinstallation of a roof and wooden floors. Limited repairs were subsequently approved by the trustees of Lord Conyers, although Clark's colleague, A. Ellis, expressed concerns that railings to protect the visitors who routinely {{climbed to the top}} of the keep had not been funded. A reported £500 was spent by the trustees renovating the castle ruins, including the construction of a lodge in the outer bailey for the castle keeper, completed in 1885, and improvements to the footpaths.|$|E
5|$|As the {{situation}} deteriorated, the Brazilian government mobilized army units from {{other regions of}} the Empire. On 1 January 1865, one brigade (composed of two infantry battalions and one artillery battalion) with 1,700 men from the Brazilian province of Rio de Janeiro disembarked and occupied the Uruguayan town of Fray Bentos. Paranhos, along with Tamandaré, met Flores in Fray Bentos and decided to launch a combined attack against Montevideo. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>apparent</b> that the Paraguayans would take too long to reach Uruguay and no help would come from Urquiza and his Argentine Federalists. Increasingly isolated, Aguirre hoped that the foreign powers could intervene, but when, on 11 January, he asked the diplomatic corps in Montevideo whether they would provide military assistance to him and his government, none responded positively. João Propício Mena Barreto sailed from Fray Bentos on 14 January with the Brazilian infantry, bound for a landing near the mouth of the Santa Lucía River near Montevideo. On the way, he occupied the Uruguayan town of Colonia del Sacramento, garrisoning it with 50 soldiers.|$|E
5|$|By mid-morning, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>apparent</b> {{that the}} failure of the New Zealanders to advance their section of the front exposed the left flank of the {{neighbouring}} 3rd Australian Division, which had secured its first objective and was pushing on to its second. Likewise, on the New Zealand Division's left, the 9th (Scottish) Division had managed to reach its final objective. Godley issued new instructions to the New Zealand Division; abandoning any hope of getting to the Green Line, it was to push on to the Blue Line in an attack timed for 3:00pm. However, by the early afternoon the flanking Scots had been pushed back while the Australians had failed to make further gains and were withdrawing due to enfilade gunfire on the flanks. Braithwaite, warned by his battalion commanders that capturing the Blue Line was impossible, twice pushed Russell for a cancellation of the attack. Russell's initial response was to instruct the Rifle Brigade to continue, but shortly before the attack was to begin, it was abandoned.|$|E

5|$|No {{detailed}} {{descriptions of}} Adams or its glaciers existed until Professor William Denison Lyman and Horace S. Lyman published descriptions of three of its glaciers and various other features of the southern flanks of the mountain in 1886. The White Salmon/Avalanche, Mazama, and Klickitat Glaciers were those described. They also postulated Adams {{to be the source}} of some of the Columbia River basalt flows. They thought that Adams was within what was originally an enormous caldera that was about one hundred miles across. The southern boundary of this enormous caldera was the anticline ridge that forms the southern border of the Glenwood Valley. Modern geology has since dismissed this theory. From information collected on an outing of the Mazamas in 1895, Professor Lyman expanded his descriptions of those three glaciers in 1896. Adams was finally properly surveyed in 1901, when Rusk led noted geologist/glaciologist Harry Fielding Reid to Adams' remote location. Reid conducted the first systematic study of the volcano and also named its most significant glaciers, Pinnacle, Adams, Lava, Lyman, and Rusk with suggestions from Rusk. He also named Castle Rock (The Castle), Little Mount Adams, and Red Butte. Reid noted that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>apparent</b> that the glaciers of Adams had been significantly larger during the Little Ice Age. The geologic history of Adams would have to wait another 80 years before it was fully explored.|$|E
5|$|Bolívar, {{learning}} about {{the collapse of the}} Cádiz expedition, spent the year 1820 preparing a liberating campaign in Venezuela. Bolívar was aided by Spain's new policy of seeking engagement with the insurgents, which Morillo implemented, renouncing to the command in chief, and returning to Spain. Although Bolívar rejected the Spanish proposal that the patriots rejoin Spain under the Spanish Constitution, the two sides established a six-month truce and the regularization of the rules of engagement under the law of nations on November 25 and 26. The truce did not last six months. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>apparent</b> to all that the royalist cause had been greatly weakened by the lack of reinforcements. Royalist soldiers and whole units began to desert or defect to the patriots in large numbers. On January 28, 1821, the ayuntamiento of Maracaibo declared the province an independent republic that chose to join the new nation-state of Gran Colombia. Miguel de la Torre, who had replaced Morillo as head of the army, took this to be a violation of the truce, and although the republicans argued that Maracaibo had switched sides of its own volition, both sides began to prepare for renewed war. The fate of Venezuela was sealed when Bolívar returned there in April leading an army of 7,000 from New Granada. At the Battle of Carabobo on June 24, the Gran Colombian forces decisively defeated the royalist forces, assuring control of Venezuela save for Puerto Cabello and guaranteeing Venezuelan independence. Bolívar could now concentrate on Gran Colombia's claims to southern New Granada and Quito.|$|E

25|$|While the Johnson v. Johnson fight {{had been}} {{billed as a}} world heavyweight title match, in many ways, it resembled an exhibition.
