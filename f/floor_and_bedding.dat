Knowing thatChinchilla has an inactive period of 71, 02 % from 24 h, they are resting 54, 05 % and 16, 97 % so-called sleeping in 24 h. From our studies results that most of inactive time(rest and sleeping) they are sitting on the dust bath tray, no matter the floor type.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Although {{research}} has shown that early life exposure to household endotoxin protects against development of allergies, studies are less clear on the relationship between household endotoxin exposure and prevalence of wheezing and asthma. We assayed 2, 552 house dust samples in a representative nationwide sam- ple to explore relationships between endotoxin exposures and risk factors for asthma, asthma symptoms, and medication use. METHODS: House dust was vacuum-sampled from five locations within homes and assayed for endotoxin. Health, demographic, and housing information was assessed through questionnaire and on-site evaluation of 2, 456 residents of 831 homes selected to represent the demographics of the United States. RESULTS: Endotoxin concentration (EU/mg) and load (EU/m(2)) were highly correlated (r = 0. 73 - 0. 79). Geometric mean endotoxin concentrations were as follows (in EU/mg) : bedroom floors, 35. 3 (5 th- 95 th percentile, 5. 0 - 260); bedding, 18. 7 (2. 0 - 142); family room floors, 63. 9 (11. 5 - 331); sofas, 44. 8 (6. 4 - 240); and kitchen floors, 80. 5 (9. 8 - 512). Multivariate analysis demonstrated significant relationships between increasing endotoxin levels and diagnosed asthma, asthma symptoms in the past year, current use of asthma medications, and wheezing among residents of the homes. These relationships were strongest for bedroom <b>floor</b> <b>and</b> <b>bedding</b> dust and were observed in adults only. Modeling the joint effect of bedding and bedroom floor endotoxin on recent asthma symptoms yielded an adjusted odds ratio of 2. 83 (95 % confidence interval, 1. 01 - 7. 87). When stratified by allergy status, allergic subjects with higher endotoxin exposure were no more likely to have diagnosed asthma or asthma symptoms than nonallergic subjects. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that household endotoxin exposure is a significant risk factor for increased asthma prevalence...|$|E
40|$|Group housing of sows during {{gestation}} {{is mandatory}} in the EU since 2013. Compared to housing in individual crates, group housing allows {{the animals to}} express normal activity and behavior. The present paper discusses the impact of group housing on health, with emphasis on lameness, aggression and possible spread of infectious diseases. The prevalence of lameness is generally higher in sows housed in group than in sows housed individually. Floor space per sow, group size, pen design and flooring are the main factors of group housing involved in lameness development. Especially floor characteristics are important, and particular attention should {{be paid to the}} type, building material and quality of the floor, hygiene and the use of bedding such as straw or rubber mats. Aggression between sows is another critical issue in group housing systems. It occurs predominantly because of competition for access to a limited resource, or to establish a social hierarchy. Key factors to prevent aggression in group housing include gradual familiarization of unfamiliar animals, sufficient space and pen structure during initial mixing, minimizing opportunities for dominant sows to steal food from subordinates, provision of a good quality floor, environmental enrichment and use of straw bedding. Very scarce evidence-based information is available on the relationship between group housing and infectious disease. Compared to individual housing, sows in group housing have more nose-to-nose contact, and they have more oral contact with feces and urine. These factors could contribute to a higher or faster transmission of pathogens, but so far, there is no evidence showing more disease problems in group housing systems. In conclusion, in group housing systems, particular attention should be paid to prevention of lameness and aggression. Management is crucial but also feeding strategies, <b>floor</b> <b>and</b> <b>bedding,</b> and design of housing are very important as relatively minor adjustments may exert major effects on the animals...|$|E

Materials and Methods: The study covered 50 homes of one- or two-year-old children in Poland.

Results: Average geometric concentrations (geometric standard deviation) of endotoxins, (1 → 3) -β-D-glucans, Der p 1, Fel d 1, Can f 1 and Bla g 1 in children homes were on the floor 42 166. 0 EU/g (3. 2), 20 478. 4 ng/g (2. 38), 93. 9 ng/g (6. 58), 119. 8 ng/g (13. 0), 288. 9 ng/g (3. 4), 0. 72 U/g (4. 4) <b>and</b> in their <b>beds</b> (only allergens) 597. 8 ng/g (14. 2), 54. 1 ng/g (4. 4), 158. 6 ng/g (3. 1) 0. 6 U/g (2. 9), respectively. When the floor was covered with the carpet, higher concentrations of endotoxins, (1 → 3) -β-D-glucans and allergens (each type) were found in the settled dust (p < 0. 05). The trend was opposite in case of allergens (except dog) analyzed from <b>bed</b> dust <b>and</b> significantly higher concentrations were found in the rooms with smooth floor (p < 0. 05). Conclusions: Among the analyzed factors only the type of floor significantly modified both the level of biological indicators and allergens. The results of this study could be the base for verifying a hypothesis that carpeting may have a protective role against high levels of cockroach, dog and cat allergens...|$|R

In this way, at the wire netting floor system we pursue the roughage (grass-clover hay) and the complete mixed pelleted forage consumption, collecting the rests bellow the cages, separated them in parts, and calculate the difference. At the bedded system we weight the rests every day, ad the difference were considered the consumption. After drawing and processing data’s we obtained a bigger pellet consumption at the adult animals kept on wire net floor with 48. 66 % comparing to the bedded cages system. In a case of youths the situation is exactly inverse, the weaned animals kept in bedded cages had bigger pellet consumption with 28. 93 % compared to the wire net floor system...|$|R

Methods All 38 CCCs were measured for Der 1 (sum of Der f 1 and Der p 1) concentrations on classroom <b>floors</b> <b>and</b> <b>bedding</b> before the intervention. Educational newsletters on children’s bedding control were sent to 21 CCCs by mail, and {{teachers were asked to}} distribute the newsletters to the parents of the children (intervention group). The remaining 17 CCCs were not sent newsletters (control group). The measurement of Der 1 concentrations in 38 CCCs was repeated after the intervention. Dust samples were collected with a vacuum cleaner and analyzed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay methods. Results The Der 1 concentrations on the bedding were significantly higher than those on the floors in 38 CCCs at baseline (p< 0. 05). Although changes of the Der 1 concentrations for the control group (n= 17) were not significant, Der 1 concentrations for the intervention group (n= 21) decreased significantly from 2077. 9 ng/g dust to 963. 5 ng/g dust on the <b>floors</b> <b>and</b> from 3683. 9 ng/g dust to 610. 4 ng/g dust on bedding (p< 0. 05).

La Jornada newspaper called the atmosphere of the place “real, tense, not with abundance and not always happy.” The complex was declared a historic monument in 1982. The house is small and common for a dwelling built in the early 20th century in the area. One notable exception is a tower topped by a bronze eagle of the type that Venustiano Carranza used during the Mexican Revolution. It is claimed that it was a gift from Carranza to the house’s former owner, a Mister Turatti. Bullet holes from the Siqueiros attack are still on the outer walls.
