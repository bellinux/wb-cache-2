It cost £29.95 and had the capability of saving data to cassette tape, ZX Microdrive, Opus Discovery (an external 3.5 <b>inch</b> disk <b>drive)</b> or Technology Research Beta (an interface that allowed 5.25 inch and 3.5 <b>inch</b> <b>drives</b> to be connected). The device worked on 128K Spectrums, {{but only if they}} were put in 48K mode. It featured a Kempston joystick port, and later revisions contained a switch that effectively 'hid' the device from software. Early versions had a composite video out port but this feature was later removed.|$|R

50|$|The server’s {{front panel}} offered two 3.5 <b>inch</b> <b>drive</b> bays. The hard disks were mounted in {{removable}} carriers, {{despite the fact}} that the server only supported cold swap. A single socket server, the processor on offer was the 2.4 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo processor. An intense cooling system was incorporated, with a large heatsink and an array of pipes, with three small fans addressing cooling needs. Despite the presence of three fans, the server’s noise levels were low. Power utilization was also low, with the server drawing 65W when idle and 94W at peak performance.|$|E

The latest operating system which can be installed in this PC is Windows 2000 or Windows ME. Windows XP can be installed, but the speed will be much slower than Windows 2000 or Windows ME, and it is nearly unoperable with Windows XP.|$|E

5000|$|There is one 5.25 <b>inch</b> <b>drive</b> made by Apple that is {{completely}} incompatible with all the drives named above. In 1987 Apple sought to better compete in the IBM dominated business market by offering a means of cross-compatibility. Alongside {{the release of the}} Macintosh SE & Macintosh II, Apple released the Apple PC 5.25" [...] Drive which required a separate custom PC 5.25 Floppy Disk Controller Card, different for each Mac model. It is the only 5.25" [...] drive manufactured by Apple that can be used by the Macintosh. This drive was for use with industry standard double-sided 5.25" [...] 360K formatted flexible disks. It was similar in appearance to the Disk IIc. Through the use of a special Macintosh Apple File Exchange utility shipped with it, the drive could read files from, and write files to, floppy disks in MS-DOS formats. Software [...] "translators" [...] could convert documents between WordStar and MacWrite, among others. Unfortunately, this drive is not just incompatible with all Apple II computers, but also with the Apple IIe Card for the Macintosh LC; it cannot be used to allow a Macintosh to read from or write to 5.25" [...] Apple II formatted disks either.|$|E
40|$|The Power Ratchet Tool (PRT) is a self contained, power-driven, 3 / 8 <b>inch</b> <b>drive</b> {{ratchet wrench}} {{which will be}} used by astronauts during Extravehicular Activities (EVA). This {{battery-powered}} tool is controlled by a dedicated electonic controller. The PRT was flown during the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Deployment Mission STS- 31 to deploy the solar arrays if the automatic mechanisms failed. The PRT is currently intended for use during the first HST Servicing Mission STS- 61 as a general purpose power tool. The PRT consists of three major components; the wrench, the controller, and the battery module. Fourteen discrete combinations of torque, turns, and speed may be programmed into the controller before the EVA. The crewmember selects the desired parameter profile by a switch mounted on the controller. The tool may also {{be used in the}} manual mode as a non-powered ratchet wrench. The power is provided by a silver-zinc battery module, which fits into the controller and is replaceable during an EVA. The original PRT did not meet the design specification of torque output and hours of operation. To increase efficiency and reliability the PRT underwent a redesign effort. The majority of this effort focused on the wrench. The original PRT drive train consisted of a low torque, high speed brushless DC motor, a face gear set, and a planocentric gear assembly. The total gear reduction was 300 : 1. The new PRT wrench consists of a low speed, high torque brushless DC motor, two planetary gear sets and a bevel gear set. The total gear reduction is now 75 : 1. A spline clutch has also been added to disengage the drive train in the manual mode. The design changes to the controller will consist of only those modifications necessary to accomodate the redesigned wrench. The battery design will be unaffected...|$|E

50|$|Metal in Gap (MIG) {{heads are}} ferrite heads {{with a small}} piece of metal in the head gap that {{concentrates}} the field. This allows smaller features to be read and written. MIG heads were replaced with thin film heads. Thin film heads were electronically similar to ferrite heads and used the same physics, but they were manufactured using photolithographic processes and thin films of material that allowed fine features to be created. Thin film heads were much smaller than MIG heads and therefore allowed smaller recorded features to be used. Thin film heads allowed 3.5 <b>inch</b> <b>drives</b> to reach 4GB storage capacities in 1995. The geometry of the head gap was a compromise between what worked best for reading and what worked best for writing.|$|R
