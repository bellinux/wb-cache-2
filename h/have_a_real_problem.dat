50|$|Early federal {{elections}} in Germany {{can only take}} place after {{the dissolution of the}} Bundestag by the President of Germany, since the constitution forbids the Bundestag to dissolve itself. The President can dissolve it only after the Chancellor loses a vote on a motion of confidence.

Many observers agree that Schröder met this requirement, since a number of left-wing SPD delegates had expressed great reservations about Chancellor Schröder's labour reform and welfare reform programme. However, only days before the vote, the coalition had passed a number of bills with no dissenters, indicating strong support for the Chancellor within the coalition.

40|$|The {{process of}} live sound spatialisation has many {{unpredictable}} parameters. Large numbers of loudspeakers with variable frequency responses, hastily configured routings, live and recorded audio sources that change between works, unforeseen technical requirements, compatibility issues, unfamiliar control interfaces, limited setup, rehearsal and change-over time, complex power and signal routing schemes, long cable runs and unpredictable venue acoustics are all issues familiar to performers of electroacoustic music. Unsurprisingly, {{the articulation of}} space in a live, multi-loudspeaker scenario can be problematic. Even 'simple' CD-only diffusion requires dexterity {{on the part of}} the performer and considerable technical planning.

40|$|Although {{it is true}} that {{discrimination}} against women is still present in several parts of life, there is a sharp difference between how women used to live before their liberation movement and how they can live now in Western European countries. Since they can earn their living, they are no longer “parasites” – as Betty Friedan used to describe them 6. Although today’s situation is not fabulous either, we have to admit that it is much better than in the Victorian era. Women can thank several things to feminism. They can study, they can work, they can choose their partners, own property, and much more opportunities are open to them in life. However, we cannot ignore the fact that these changes went {{hand in hand with the}} economic change that full-time mothering, due to financial reasons, is many times not attainable for those who would prefer that. Another major achievement of feminism is that they have the right to control their reproduction, but the night-side of this is the high number of abortions. Besides these, the fact that men have entered the private sphere is also a major result. But if we consider their taking part in family life – housework and the amount of time spent with their children – one has to admit that equality in this respect is not complete. Therefore, it is clear that a change in men’s way of thinking would be a key to create a better world for women. Mouna Naim’s article expresses this key issue well: “[t]he heart of the matter is that the majority of men <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> <b>problem</b> in the way they relate to women.
