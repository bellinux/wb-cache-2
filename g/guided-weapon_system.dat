40|$|The {{statistical}} {{nature of}} the input to a <b>guided-weapon</b> <b>system</b> (target information and noise) requires that the criterion of weapon performance be itself a statistical quantity. The criterion used in this paper is the mean square miss distance, the mean being taken over {{a large number of}} engagements, such that all,probable target and noise inputs are encountered, and it is shown that there exists an optimum realisable system for which this mean square miss distance is a minimum. For the derivation of the optimum system it is necessary to assume that the target and noise inputs, or appropriate functions of these inputs, may be considered to form a stationary (but not necessarily ergodic) ensemble for a short interval prior to collision. Account is taken {{of the fact that the}} system must include a missile, with its aerodynamic characteristics and limited available acceleration, and this leads to a number of optimum systems depending on these factors. The beam-riding system is shown to satisfy the main requirements of the analytical framework, so that this system may be identified with the optimum system. From this identification follows the definition of certain components of the beam-rider, and the optimisation of the latter requires the insertion of electrical networks in the ground tracker or in the missile, or both, depending on the sources of noise. Explicit formulae are derived for cases in which the noise spectral density is assumed to be constant wit...|$|E
