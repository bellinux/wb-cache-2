5|$|After the Austro-Prussian War in 1866, the Prussian-dominated North <b>German</b> Confederation {{adopted a}} tricolour of black-white-red as its flag. This flag {{later became the}} flag of the <b>German</b> Empire, formed {{following}} the unification of Germany under the Prussian king who became emperor in 1871, and was used until 1918 {{with the end of the}} First World War. Black, white, and red were reintroduced as the <b>German</b> national colours with the establishment of Nazi Germany under Adolf Hitler in 1933, replacing <b>German</b> republican colours with imperial colours until the end of World War II.|$|E
5|$|After the <b>German</b> reunification, the East <b>German</b> {{football}} association {{joined the}} DFB. The East <b>German</b> women's national football team had played only one official international match, losing 0–3 to Czechoslovakia {{in a friendly}} match on 9 May 1990. The unified <b>German</b> team defended their title successfully at the 1991 European Championship. After winning all games in the qualifying group, Germany again met Italy in the semi-final, this time winning 3–0. On 14 July 1991, the <b>German</b> team once more faced Norway in the final. The game went to extra time, during which Heidi Mohr and Silvia Neid scored for Germany and secured the 3–1 victory.|$|E

50|$|About 300,000 Russian <b>Germans</b> became {{subject to}} deportations to Siberia and the Bashkir steppe, of those 70,000-200,000 were <b>Germans</b> from Volhynia, 20,000 were <b>Germans</b> from Podolia, 10,000 were <b>Germans</b> from the Kiev area, and another 11,000 were <b>Germans</b> from the Chernihiv area.|$|R
5000|$|Many East <b>Germans</b> {{initially}} {{regarded the}} dissolution of the GDR positively. But this reaction soon turned sour. West <b>Germans</b> often acted as if they had [...] "won" [...] and East <b>Germans</b> had [...] "lost" [...] in unification, leading many East <b>Germans</b> (Ossis) to resent West <b>Germans</b> (Wessis). In 2004, Ascher Barnstone wrote, [...] "East <b>Germans</b> resent the wealth possessed by West Germans; West <b>Germans</b> see the East <b>Germans</b> as lazy opportunists who want something for nothing. East <b>Germans</b> find 'Wessis' arrogant and pushy, West <b>Germans</b> think the 'Ossis' are lazy good-for-nothings." [...] On a more fundamental level, unification and subsequent federal policies led to serious economic hardships for many East <b>Germans</b> that had not existed before the Wende. Unemployment and homelessness, which had been minimal during the communist era, grew and quickly became widespread; this, as well as the closures of countless factories and other workplaces in the east, fostered a growing sense that East <b>Germans</b> were being ignored or neglected by the federal government.|$|R
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the Soviet Tartu Operation, the ratio of Soviet to <b>German</b> strength was 4.3:1 for troops, 14.8:1 for artillery and 4.1:1 for armour. The <b>German</b> forces were mostly battle groups from various formations and smaller units from different branches. A significant proportion of the <b>German</b> side was constituted of Omakaitse militia battalions with poor weaponry and little fighting ability.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, Monsabert's attempt to {{liberate}} Marseille commenced. At first, a <b>German</b> force at Aubagne was defeated before French troops attacked the city directly. Unlike Toulon, the <b>German</b> commander at Marseille did not evacuate the civilian population, which became increasingly hostile. The resulting fighting with FFI troops further weakened the <b>German</b> units, which were exhausted from partisan fighting. The Wehrmacht {{was not able}} to defend on a broad front and soon crumbled into numerous isolated strongpoints. On 27August most of the city was liberated, with only a few small strongpoints remaining, and on 28August <b>German</b> troops issued the official surrender. The battle caused 1,825 French casualties, but 11,000 <b>German</b> troops were captured. In both harbours, <b>German</b> engineers had demolished port facilities to deny their use to the Allies.|$|E
5|$|Atrocities {{continued}} {{during the}} <b>German</b> retreat from Southern France as <b>German</b> soldiers plundered and burned down towns. French civilians were brought before ad-hoc military courts {{and sentenced to}} death because of alleged partisan activities. These atrocities did not help to subdue the French uprising. Instead, the <b>German</b> reprisals had the opposite effect and encouraged the French population to engage in partisan fighting.|$|E

5|$|By 20:00, Scheer {{ordered the}} <b>German</b> line to {{complete}} a 180-degree turn eastward to disengage from the British fleet. The maneuver, conducted under heavy fire, caused disorganization in the <b>German</b> fleet. Kaiserin had come too close to Prinzregent Luitpold {{and was forced to}} haul out of line to starboard to avoid a collision. The latter vessel came up alongside Kaiserin at high speed. As a result, Kaiserin had to remain out of line and could not return to her assigned position. The turn reversed the order of the <b>German</b> line; Kaiserin was now the seventh ship {{from the rear of the}} <b>German</b> line. At around 23:30, the <b>German</b> fleet reorganized into the night cruising formation. Kaiserin was the eleventh ship, in the center of the 24-ship line.|$|E

50|$|After World War II {{in summer}} 1945 the Potsdam Conference decided that Sudeten <b>Germans</b> {{would have to}} leave Czechoslovakia (see Expulsion of <b>Germans</b> after World War II). As a {{consequence}} of the immense hostility against all <b>Germans</b> that had grown within Czechoslovakia due to Nazi behavior, the overwhelming majority of <b>Germans</b> were expelled (while the relevant Czechoslovak legislation provided for the remaining <b>Germans</b> who were able to prove their anti-Nazi affiliation).|$|R

5|$|By {{the end of}} the war, {{for many}} Italians the name of Kesselring, whose {{signature}} appeared on posters and printed orders announcing draconian measures adopted by the <b>German</b> occupation, had become synonymous with the oppression and terror that had characterised the <b>German</b> occupation.

5|$|By {{the years}} of unification, <b>German</b> Jews played an {{important}} role in the intellectual underpinnings of the <b>German</b> professional, intellectual, and social life. The expulsion of Jews from Russia in the 1880s and 1890s complicated integration into the <b>German</b> public sphere. Russian Jews arrived in north <b>German</b> cities in the thousands; considerably less educated and less affluent, their often dismal poverty dismayed many of the Germanized Jews. Many of the problems related to poverty (such as illness, overcrowded housing, unemployment, school absenteeism, refusal to learn <b>German,</b> etc.) emphasized their distinctiveness for not only the Christian Germans, but for the local Jewish populations as well.|$|E
5|$|Chilembwe {{also sought}} {{support for his}} {{uprising}} from the <b>German</b> forces in <b>German</b> East Africa, on Nyasaland's far northern border, hoping that a <b>German</b> offensive from the north combined with a native insurrection in the south might force the British out of Nyasaland permanently. On 24 January, he {{sent a letter to}} the <b>German</b> Governor by courier through Portuguese East Africa. The courier was intercepted and the letter was never received. During the latter stages of the East African Campaign, after the <b>German</b> invasion of Portuguese East Africa, the <b>German</b> colonial army actually helped to suppress anti-Portuguese rebellions, among the Makombe and Barue peoples, worrying that African uprisings would destabilise the colonial order.|$|E
50|$|The first <b>Germans</b> {{arrived in}} Chicago in the 1830s. <b>Germans</b> {{arrived in the}} United States as Chicago began to develop in the mid-19th century. 1,000 <b>Germans</b> were in Chicago in 1845.|$|R
50|$|There were {{reportedly}} 500,000 ethnic <b>Germans</b> in Poland in 1998. Recent official figures show 147,000 (as of 2002). Of the 745,421 <b>Germans</b> in Romania in 1930, only about 60,000 remain. In Hungary {{the situation is}} quite similar, with only about 220,000. There are up to one million <b>Germans</b> in the former Soviet Union, mostly in a band from southwestern Russia and the Volga valley, through Omsk and Altai Krai (597,212 <b>Germans</b> in Russia, 2002 Russian census) to Kazakhstan (353,441 <b>Germans</b> in Kazakhstan, 1999 Kazakhstan census). Germany admitted approximately 1.63 million ethnic <b>Germans</b> from the former Soviet Union between 1990 and 1999.|$|R
5000|$|Sergi {{claimed the}} Nordics {{had made no}} {{substantial}} contribution to pre-modern civilization, noting that [...] "in the epoch of Tacitus the <b>Germans</b> ... remained barbarians as in prehistoric times". He claimed that the Romans were unable to Romanize the <b>Germans</b> because the <b>Germans</b> were averse to the Romans' civilizing influence. He rejected Germanic scholars' claims that <b>Germans</b> were the saviors of a decadent post-Roman Italy. Instead Sergi claimed that the <b>Germans</b> were responsible for bringing forward the Dark Ages in the Medieval period and that the <b>Germans</b> of the Medieval period were known for [...] "delinquency, vagabondage, and ferocity".|$|R
5|$|During the 1978 FIFA World Cup, held in Argentina, Rudel {{visited the}} <b>German</b> {{national}} football team in their {{training camp in}} Ascochinga. The <b>German</b> media criticized the <b>German</b> Football Association, and viewed Rudel's visit as being sympathetic to the military dictatorship that ruled Argentina following the 1976 Argentine coup d'état. During the 1958 FIFA World Cup in Sweden, he visited the <b>German</b> team at Malmö on 8 June 1958. There he was welcomed by team manager Sepp Herberger.|$|E
5|$|During the Channel Dash the Luftwaffe {{succeeded in}} {{defeating}} air {{attacks on the}} <b>German</b> ships during the operation, thus allowing them to reach <b>German</b> waters.

5|$|Following a mutiny in Kiel {{at the end}} of October, a wave of {{revolutions}} {{broke out}} among the <b>German</b> army. In occupied Belgium, soldiers of the Brussels garrison mutinied against their officers on 10 November 1918. The revolutionaries formed a Soldiers' Council (Soldatenrat) and flew the red flag over the Brussels Kommandantur while many officers, including the Governor-General, left the city for Germany. Fighting in the streets soon broke out between <b>German</b> loyalists and revolutionaries. With the <b>German</b> police no longer keeping order, anarchy broke out in the city which was only restored when Belgian troops arrived. The remaining <b>German</b> forces in Belgium began moving eastwards towards the <b>German</b> border, gradually evacuating more territory. The final <b>German</b> troops left the country on 23 November.|$|E
50|$|With the {{expulsion}} of the <b>Germans</b> in 1945, Czechoslovakia lost over one-fifth of its population. Some 165,000 <b>Germans</b> escaped deportation and remained scattered along the country's western border in the former Sudetenland. Through the mid-1970s, <b>Germans</b> represented a declining proportion of the population; younger <b>Germans</b> increasingly were assimilated into Czech society or emigrated to the West.

5|$|From the outset, West Germany and the Allies {{rejected}} East Germany's legitimacy. The {{creation of}} East Germany was deemed a communist/Soviet fait accompli, without a freely or fairly elected government. West Germany regarded <b>German</b> citizenship and rights as applying equally to East and West <b>German</b> citizens. An East <b>German</b> who escaped or was {{released to the}} West was automatically granted West <b>German</b> rights including residence, the right to work, and EEC freedom of movement; West <b>German</b> laws were deemed to be applicable in the East. East Germans thus had a powerful incentive {{to move to the}} West, where they would enjoy greater freedom and economic prospects.|$|E
