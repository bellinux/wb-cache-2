40|$|Abstract In this paper, {{we study}} a new {{approach}} to fault detection for autonomous robots. Our hypothesis is that hardware faults change the flow of sensory data and the actions performed by the control program. By detecting these changes, the presence of faults can be inferred. In order to test our hypothesis, we collect data from three different tasks performed by real robots. During a number of training runs, we record sensory data from the robots while they are operating normally and after a fault has been injected. We use back-propagation neural networks to synthesize fault detection components based on the data collected in the training runs. We evaluate the performance of the trained <b>fault</b> <b>detectors</b> in terms of number of false positives and time it takes to detect a fault. The results show that good <b>fault</b> <b>detectors</b> can be obtained. We extend the set of possible faults and go on to show that a single <b>fault</b> <b>detector</b> can be trained to detect several faults in both a robot’s sensors and actuators.

Detecting a high-resistance <b>grounding</b> <b>fault</b> proves a tough and challenging task for DC system safety. Traditionally, the methods of AC injection and DC leakage are widely used [84]. The method of AC injection monitors the <b>ground</b> <b>fault</b> through injecting a low frequency sine wave signal into the DC system, while the method of DC leakage directly inspects the <b>ground</b> <b>fault</b> with a DC leakage current. Reference [84] proposed a novel method of injecting different frequency signals. This method maintains both the advantages of high precision of the traditional AC injection method {{and it can be}} protected from the influence of the distributed capacitor in the DC system. A <b>ground</b> <b>fault</b> monitoring technique for an extra-low voltage direct current (ELVDC, up to a 60 V DC) distribution system was presented in [85]. A built environment equipotential property was applied in this technique. It is a good solution for <b>ground</b> <b>fault</b> detection when the DC leakage current is at a low level and not detectable.

40|$|Abstract—Existing {{approaches}} to diagnosing sensor networks are generally sink-based, which rely on actively pulling state information from all sensor nodes {{so as to}} conduct centralized analysis. However, the sink-based diagnosis tools incur huge communication overhead to the traffic sensitive sensor networks. Also, due to the unreliable wireless communications, sink often obtains incomplete and sometimes suspicious information, leading to highly inaccurate judgments. Even worse, we observe that it is always more difficult to obtain state information from the problematic or critical regions. To address the above issues, we present the concept of self-diagnosis, which encourages each single sensor to join the fault decision process. We design a series of novel <b>fault</b> <b>detectors</b> through which multiple nodes can cooperate {{with each other in}} a diagnosis task.

To mitigate these risks, AC-isolated, DC grounded PV systems in the United States use <b>Ground</b> <b>Fault</b> Protection Devices (GFPDs), e. g., fuses, to de-energize the PV system {{when there is a}} <b>ground</b> <b>fault.</b> Recently the effectiveness of these protection devices has come under question because multiple fires have started when <b>ground</b> <b>faults</b> went undetected. In order to understand the limitations of fuse-based <b>ground</b> <b>fault</b> protection in PV systems, analytical and numerical simulations of different <b>ground</b> <b>faults</b> were performed. The numerical simulations were conducted with Simulation Program with Integrated Circuit Emphasis (SPICE) using a circuit model of the PV system which included the modules, wiring, switchgear, grounded or ungrounded components, and the inverter. The derivation of the SPICE model and the results of parametric fault current studies are provided with varying array topologies, fuse sizes, and fault impedances. Closed-form analytical approximations for GFPD currents from <b>faults</b> to the <b>grounded</b> current carrying conductor-known as %E 2 % 80 % 9 Cblind spot%E 2 % 80 % 9 D ground faults-are derived to provide greater understanding of the influence of array impedances on fault currents. The behavior of the array during various <b>ground</b> <b>faults</b> is studied for a range of <b>ground</b> <b>fault</b> fuse sizes to determine if reducing the size of the fuse improves <b>ground</b> <b>fault</b> detection sensitivity.
