40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} herding {{behaviors}} and investment performance of foreign {{investors in the}} U. S. market. Little evidence is found of foreigners' herding behavior within one time period. However, there is strong evidence that foreign investors follow their past behavior {{into and out of}} the U. S. market over adjacent months. Foreigners' buy-side behavior of buying U. S. equities as a group is positively related to past high returns in the U. S. market and this buy-side behavior leads to superior investment performance. Evidence shows that independent of whether the U. S. market is up or down, foreign investors continue to increase their holdings of U. S. equities and these purchasing activities result in superior performance. When the U. S. market experiences <b>extreme</b> <b>ups</b> <b>and</b> <b>downs,</b> foreigners are net purchasers one month before and after the market moves and, in general, they perform well. ...|$|E

40|$|The paper aims at {{examining}} the herd {{behavior in the}} Jordanian equity market {{before and after the}} 2008 global financial crisis. The most common approaches [Christie and Huang (1995) (CH) and Chang et al. (2000) (CCK) ] are used to test for herding tendency of the financial and nonfinancial firms. By making use of the CH approach, estimated using the Ordinary Least Squares method (OLS), evidence of the absence of herding tendency is reported in extreme and normal market conditions. To investigate the tendency for herding further, the CCK approach is also implemented. The model of CCK is estimated using the OLS and the Quantile Regression (QR) methods. The results of CCK, using OLS, show evidence of the absence of linear herding for both types of firms before and after the crisis. But, only nonfinancial firms exhibit evidence of nonlinear herding in both sub-periods. In the <b>extreme</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> market, evidence of linear herding is only found after the crisis for both types of firms when market is trending up. For all firms at the median level, the results of QR provide evidence of linear herding after the crisis while no evidence is reported for nonlinear herding. Financial firms exhibit only nonlinear herding at median level before the crisis when the market is trending up. Nonfinancial firms do not exhibit linear and nonlinear herding at the median level in both <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> markets. The results of OLS and QR are different for both types of firms. However, for linear herding the results of CH and CCK are similar. Jordanian investors exhibit a tendency for linear herding in extreme and normal market conditions but cannot have enough power to convert into nonlinrear one. </p...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the presence of}} herd formation in equity markets by defining a new measure for equity return dispersion. We build on Christie and Huang (1995) results and analyze security returns for {{the same time period}} using a modified version of their dispersion measure. Our results contradict with theirs. We find evidence to herding by market participants during periods of unusually large upward and downward swings. We also find no evidence in favor of the so-called directional asymmetry which suggests that herd formation occurs only during extreme down markets. Both measures of security return dispersions that we utilize are consistently lower during periods of both <b>extreme</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>extreme</b> <b>down</b> market movements.

60|$|But {{we are all}} in {{the hands}} of the Gods; and Pip jumped again. It was under very similar {{circumstances}} to the first performance; but this time he did not breast out the line; and hence, when the whale started to run, Pip was left behind on the sea, like a hurried traveller's trunk. Alas! Stubb was but too true to his word. It was a beautiful, bounteous, blue day! the spangled sea calm and cool, and flatly stretching away, all round, to the horizon, like gold-beater's skin hammered out to the <b>extremest.</b> Bobbing <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> in that sea, Pip's ebon head showed like a head of cloves. No boat-knife was lifted when he fell so rapidly astern. Stubb's inexorable back was turned upon him; and the whale was winged. In three minutes, a whole mile of shoreless ocean was between Pip and Stubb. Out from the centre of the sea, poor Pip turned his crisp, curling, black head to the sun, another lonely castaway, though the loftiest and the brightest.|$|R

60|$|All {{that is in}} the man in {{the larger}} sense, what we call {{impression}} as well as what we call intuition, so far as my argument looks, we must accept. It is not wrong to desire food, or exercise, or beautiful surroundings, or the love of sex, or interest which is the food of the mind. All these are craved; all these should be craved; to none of these in itself does the soul demur; where there comes an undeniable want, we recognise a demand of nature. Yet we know that these natural demands may be superseded, for the demands which are common to mankind make but a shadowy consideration in comparison {{to the demands of the}} individual soul. Food is almost the first pre-requisite; and yet a high character will go without food to the ruin and death of the body rather than gain it in a manner which the spirit disavows. Pascal laid aside mathematics; Origen doctored his body with a knife; every day some one is thus mortifying his dearest interests and desires, and, in Christ's words, entering maim into the Kingdom of Heaven. This is to supersede the lesser and less harmonious affections by renunciation; and though by this ascetic path we may get to heaven, we cannot get thither a whole and perfect man. But there is another way, to supersede them by reconciliation, in which the soul and all the faculties and senses pursue a common route and share in one desire. Thus, man is tormented by a very imperious physical desire; it spoils his rest, it is not to be denied; the doctors will tell you, not I, how it is a physical need, like the want of food or slumber. In the satisfaction of this desire, as it first appears, the soul sparingly takes part; nay, it oft unsparingly regrets and disapproves the satisfaction. But let the man learn to love a woman as far as he is capable of love; and for this random affection of the body there is substituted a steady determination, a consent of all his powers and faculties, which supersedes, adopts, and commands the other. The desire survives, strengthened, perhaps, but taught obedience, and changed in scope and character. Life is no longer a tale of betrayals and regrets; for the man now lives as a whole; his consciousness now moves on uninterrupted like a river; through all the <b>extremes</b> <b>and</b> <b>ups</b> <b>and</b> <b>downs</b> of passion, he remains approvingly conscious of himself.|$|R
