40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the effects of carbon availability and intermittent aeration on nitrogen removal in a Sequencing Batch Biofilm Reactor (SBBR). The percentage of nitrogen removal in the SBBRs operating with <b>dump</b> <b>fill</b> and slow fill with optimum intermittent aeration was quite similar, 75. 7 % and 69. 2 %, respectively, indicating that intermittent aeration allowed a considerable energy saving without compromising significantly nitrogen removal.

40|$|Self-immobilized biofilms, or aerobic {{granules}} {{without the}} addition of carrier material, have only been reported in one suspended growth system, the Sequencing Batch Reactor (SBR) with a very short <b>fill</b> time (<b>dump</b> <b>fill).</b> The SBR utilizes intermittent feeding which creates a period of high load followed by starvation (often referred to as feast-famine). In this experiment, three identical SBRs were operated with different feeding conditions to determine the role of feast-famine on granule formation. All three SBRs were operated with a total volumetric load of 2. 4 kg/m 3. d. The 90 minute Fill phase was altered for each reactor, providing an increasing time of Aerated <b>Fill.</b> A <b>dump</b> <b>fill</b> condition was applied for one reactor, while the other two reactors were aerated for different times during Fill, resulting in a smaller COD load {{at the beginning of}} each React phase. Aerobic granules formed in all reactors, but the structural properties and content of filamentous organisms were clearly dependent on a high feast condition. Only the reactor with <b>dump</b> <b>fill</b> formed compact, stable granules.

40|$|Abstract Coastal {{reclamation}} {{has been}} carried out along the coastal areas near Shenzhen, China in a large scale since 1980 s by <b>dumping</b> <b>fill</b> materials over the marine mud at the sea bottom. Usually the area to be reclaimed is drained first and some of the mud is airdried for a few weeks before it is buried by fill. After reclamation, the terrestrial groundwater, which is relatively acidic and with high dissolved oxygen, gradually displaces the seawater, which is alkaline with high salinity. The changes in the burial conditions of mud and the properties of the pore water in the mud may induce the release of some heavy metals into the mud. Field survey confirms that the pH and salinity of the groundwater in the reclamation site are much lower than the seawater. Chemical analyses of mud and groundwater samples collected from the reclamation sites reclaimed in different years indicate that most of the heavy metals in the mud decrease gradually with time, but the heavy metals in the groundwater are increased. The release of heavy metals into pore water due to reactivation of heavy metals in the mud is of environmental concern. To understand why some of the heavy metals can be released from the mud mor...|$|R

40|$|In many coastal areas, {{land has}} been {{reclaimed}} by <b>dumping</b> <b>fill</b> materials into the sea. Land reclamation {{may have a}} significant effect on groundwater regimes, especially when the reclamation is at large scale. Analytical studies on the impact of land reclamation on steady-state ground water flow conditions were conducted previously, but transient analytical solutions are not yet available. Transient analytical solutions are derived to illustrate the temporal change of groundwater systems in response to land reclamation using two hypothetical models: a hillside aquifer and an oceanic elongated island. The analytical solutions show that when time is short, the water level in the reclaimed area increases significantly after reclamation while that in the original aquifer remains almost unchanged. When time is great, the change of water level in the reclaimed site becomes small but the increase of water level propagates into the original aquifer. For the specific parameters and aquifer geometry used in the examples, it takes at least over 100 years for the whole system to approach a new equilibrium. The island example demonstrates that land reclamation on one side of the island will eventually modify the groundwater regimes over the entire island, including the water level, water divide, and submarine groundwater discharge. The degree of the modification of the groundwater system and the time required for the system to approach a new equilibrium depend mainly on the hydraulic conductivity and storativity of the fill materials and the reclamation length. It is suggested that for a large reclamation project, the response of the groundwater regime to reclamation should be studied in detail to evaluate the long-term change of the flow system and the consequent environmental and engineering impacts.

40|$|The {{frequent}} {{occurrence of}} iron slag in excavation {{layers of the}} Hellenistic to Byzantine city of Sagalassos (SW Turkey), indicates continuous iron working from the 1 st to 7 th century AD. The slag samples are identified as smithing hearth bottoms and are found in <b>dump</b> <b>fills,</b> building foundations and road constructions. Though several smelting sites {{are present in the}} 1800 km² large territory of the city, the chemical signature of the smelting slag does not correspond to the characteristics of the smithing slag found in the city itself. The smithing slag does offer insight in the smithing techniques applied, which in turn provides information about the objects produced and production chain or “chaîne opératoire” followed for iron production in Sagalassos. Textural and mineralogical analyses reveal two main smithing techniques were applied throughout the 1 st to 7 th century AD. The most commonly applied smithing technique is used for the production of simple bulk materials, like hammers or anvils. Microscopic textures in the slag show mainly mechanical deformation at relatively high temperatures. The second, more sophisticated smithing technique shows the blacksmith treated the iron at different temperatures. The presence of high lime contents indicates the use of a flux and/or a protective agent against oxidation. This technique was applied to make more complex objects or objects with cutting edges. Based on the reconstruction of the smithing techniques, the iron production of Sagalassos produced mainly everyday bulk material. The current study demonstrates the importance of using the mineralogy of smithing slag in reconstructing the technological evolution of iron production. Microtextural and mineralogical studies and comparison with modern smithing techniques offer greater insight in the complex world of Roman blacksmithing. status: publishe...|$|R
