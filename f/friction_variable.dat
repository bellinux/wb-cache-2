40|$|This paper {{presents}} a multidisciplinary {{approach to the}} analysis of the fluctuation of cutting forces in the diamond turning of crystalline materials. The analysis is based on a microplasticity model for shear angle prediction and a cutting force model incorporating a <b>friction</b> <b>variable</b> which is estimated from the power spectrum analysis. The results reveal that the pattern of periodic fluctuation of the microcutting forces is not only due to the crystallographic orientation of the materials being cut but also to the friction between the chip and the tool face. The frictional effect is found to cause a change in the pattern and the periodicity of the fluctuation of the cutting force. The power spectrum predicted from the cutting force model incorporates a <b>friction</b> <b>variable</b> which can be chosen to match the experimental power spectrum, thus providing a new way to assess the frictional condition, and {{can be used as a}} diagnostic tool to monitor the tool wear and cutting conditions during diamond turning.

40|$|This study {{presents}} an experimental investigation of seismic {{control of a}} building complex using <b>variable</b> <b>friction</b> damper. The laboratory-scale building complex was composed of a 12 -story building and a three-story podium structure coupled in different configurations. The laboratory-scale <b>variable</b> <b>friction</b> damper was tailor made with a piezoelectric actuator. The performance test of the piezoelectric actuator was carried out to identify its characteristics. The performance test was then conducted on the piezo-driven <b>variable</b> <b>friction</b> damper under either constant or varying voltage to identify its motion-independent characteristics. Based on the characterization results, a close-loop operating scheme was proposed together with two classes of semiactive controllers: local-feedback controller and global-feedback controller, for real-time manipulation of the damper. The building complex was finally tested in uncoupled, rigid-coupled, passive damper-coupled, and semiactive damper-coupled configurations. The control performance of <b>variable</b> <b>friction</b> damper for the building complex was examined and compared with other cases.

40|$|The {{steady state}} {{characteristics}} of water lubricated journal bearings having multiple axial grooves are obtained theoretically. The novelty of these bearings {{is that the}} lubricant (water) is fed under pressure {{from one end of}} the bearing, through the multiple axial grooves (groove angles may vary). These bearings can use the process fluid as the lubricant, as in the case of feed water pumps. The Reynolds equation is solved numerically by the finite difference method satisfying the Jacobsson- Floberg-Olsson boundary conditions. Experimental results indicate that the pressure remains constant for a major portion of the groove, while theory predicts a linear pressure drop from inlet to exit. Comparison of load capacity, attitude angle, volume flow rate and <b>friction</b> <b>variable</b> for various bearing number and eccentricity ratios, assuming linear pressure drop along the groove, shows that there is a significant difference between those obtained by the Reynolds model and the Jacobsson-Floberg-Olsson model. The Jacobsson-Floberg-Olsson model takes into account continuity of flow at both cavitation and reformation boundaries and therefore gives a better prediction of bearing characteristics...|$|E

In this dissertation a comprehensive class of smart base isolated buildings, new control algorithms based on H 2 /LQG, Hinfinity and time-frequency methods are developed. The frequency content of the earthquakes is incorporated into the H 2 /LQG and H infinity controllers using newly developed weighting filters. The time-frequency content of the earthquakes is also estimated by new control algorithm developed based on time-frequency methods, for variable stiffness isolation systems. Novel semiactive variable <b>friction,</b> <b>variable</b> damping and variable stiffness control devices are developed and their behavior studied analytically and experimentally. The new control algorithms and semiactive devices developed in this study are inherently smooth and do not cause sharp increases in floor accelerations or interstory drifts, while achieving reductions in base displacements. The newly developed semiactive devices and control algorithms are implemented in linear and nonlinear multi degree of freedom two and three dimensional smart base isolated buildings, subjected to a suite of near field earthquakes, and shown to be effective in reducing the response. A new smart base isolated benchmark building is developed to demonstrate the feasibility of implementation of the newly developed semiactive devices and controllers in full scale three dimensional structures subjected to strong near field earthquakes...|$|E
40|$|Problem statement: Commodity Flow Survey (CFS) was {{launched}} to collect&# 13; comprehensive freight flow data throughout {{the kingdom of}} Thailand. The surveys database is the&# 13; most complete collection of commodity flow data in Thailand. The need to reveal interregional freight&# 13; characteristics using available data from the CFS led to the objectives of this research. Approach: An&# 13; origin destination matrix based on province was calibrated using a flexible Box-Cox function form. It&# 13; used maximum likelihood and the backward method for calibration and Root Mean Square Error&# 13; (RMSE) and Mean Relative Error (MRE) to verify the models performance. Independent variables&# 13; were classified into three groups: origin variable, destination variable and geographic variable. The&# 13; origin variable represented {{the behavior of the}} trip as generated at the place of origin. Some&# 13; consumption occurred at the origin. The employment and the average plant size variables were&# 13; selected for potential productivity while personal income per capita and total populations were&# 13; included to explain consumption behavior at the origin. Personal income per capita and total&# 13; populations were selected for destination variables which act as proxy for final demand at the&# 13; destination. The third category, distance, was the most conventional <b>friction</b> <b>variable</b> for geographical&# 13; variables. Results: The calibrated model revealed that origin income, origin average plant size and&# 13; origin population performed poorly. Therefore these variables were eliminated. The best developed&# 13; model included four strongly significant variables at a 5 % level: origin employment, destination&# 13; population, destination income per capita and distance. Conclusion: The results showed that the&# 13; selected variables and the Box-Cox functional form were successful in explaining behavior of&# 13; interregional freight transportation in Thailand. The developed model was the first interregional freight&# 13; transportation model to be calibrated against Thailand commodity flow survey data...|$|E

The mathematical model of a building complex with <b>variable</b> <b>friction</b> dampers under earthquake excitation is first established. A clipped control strategy is then developed to allow <b>variable</b> <b>friction</b> dampers to work effectively with linear quadratic Gaussian control algorithms as a global-feedback controller. Local-feedback controllers, which include viscous and Reid friction controllers, modulated homogeneous friction controllers, and non-sticking friction controllers, are also formulated for use with <b>variable</b> <b>friction</b> dampers. A building complex of a 20 -story main building and a 3 -story podium structure is finally used as a numerical example to demonstrate the effectiveness of semi-active coupling control and to compare the local-feedback controllers with the global-feedback controller. The control performance of each controller for the building complex with either single or multiple friction dampers under various ground motions is examined {{in terms of both}} story drifts and acceleration responses.

40|$|Side {{friction}} {{factors are}} defined as all those actions related to the activities taking place by {{the sides of the}} road and sometimes within the road, which interfere with the traffic flow on the travelled way. They include but not limited to pedestrians, bicycles, non-motorised vehicles, parked and stopping vehicles. These factors are normally very frequent in densely populated areas in developing countries, while they are random and sparse in developed countries making it of less interest for research and consequently there is comparatively little literature about them. The objective of this thesis is to analyze the effect of these factors on traffic performance measures on urban roads. To carry out this work, a research design was formulated including specific methods and prescribed limitations. An empirical case study methodology was adopted where Dar-es-salaam city in Tanzania was chosen as a representative case. The scope was limited to include only road-link facilities. A sample of these facilities including two-lane two-way and four-lane two-way roads were selected and studied. The study was conducted in two parts, of which each involved a distinctive approach. Part one involved a macroscopic approach where traffic and friction data were collected and analyzed at an aggregated level, whereas part two involved a microscopic approach where data of individual frictional elements were collected and analysed individually. Data collection was mainly performed by application of video method, which proved to be effective for simultaneous collection of traffic and side friction data. Data reduction was conducted chiefly by computer, using standard spreadsheet and statistical software packages, mainly SPSS and some computer macros. The analysis part was based on statistical methods, chiefly regression analysis. In the macroscopic approach, traffic and friction data from all sites were adjusted through a process called ‘normalization’, which enabled the data from the different sites to be merged, and consequently to obtain speed-flow curves for each road type. The individual friction factors through regression analysis were weighted and combined into one unit of measure of friction called "FRIC". The effect of "FRIC" on speed-flow curves was analyzed. The results showed significant impact on speed for both road types. Impact on capacity was identified on two-lane two-way roads while field data on four-lane two-way roads did not allow this. In the microanalysis approach, effect of individual side friction factors on speed was analyzed. The results showed that on two-lane two-way roads, all studied factors exhibited statistically significant impact on speed, while on four-lane two-way roads, only one factor showed the same. The results also identified impact values characteristic to the individual friction factors on some roads. Recommendations were made based on these results that highway capacity studies particularly in developing countries, should include the <b>friction</b> <b>variable,</b> though in the form suitable to their own particular circumstances. Further recommendations were made that these results should be applied to formulate management programs seeking to limit levels of side friction on high mobility urban arterial streets in order to improve traffic safety and operation efficiency.

The constant frictional model and this <b>variable</b> <b>friction</b> model were used in FE simulations of {{ring compression}}.

When we develop a simulation model for a full vehicle system, the characteristics of all com-ponents are generally properly simplified based on the understanding of each component’s purpose and interaction with other components. The friction coefficient between the brake disc and the pad used in simulations has been conventionally considered constant, {{and the effect of}} a <b>variable</b> <b>friction</b> coefficient is ignored with the assumption that the variability affects the performance of the vehicle braking very little. However, the friction coefficient of a disc pad changes significantly within a range due to environmental conditions, and thus, the friction coefficient can affect the performance of the brakes considerably, especially on the wheel slide.

40|$|This paper further {{examines}} {{the possibility of}} modelling landslide {{as a consequence of}} the unstable slip in a steadily creeping slope when it is subject to perturbations, such as those induced by rainfall and earthquakes. In particular, the one-state <b>variable</b> <b>friction</b> law used in the landslide analysis by Chau is extended to a two-state <b>variable</b> <b>friction</b> law. According to this state <b>variable</b> <b>friction</b> law, the shear strength (τ) along the slip surface depends on the creeping velocity (V) as well as the two state variables (θ 1 and θ 2), which evolve with the ongoing slip. For translational slides, a system of three coupled non-linear first-order ordinary differential equations is formulated, and a linear stability analysis is applied to study the stability in the neighbourhood of the equilibrium solution of the system. By employing the stability classification of Reyn for three-dimensional space, it is found that equilibrium state (or critical point) of a slope may change from a 'stable spiral' to a 'saddle spiral with unstable plane focus' through a transitional state called 'converging vortex spiral' (i. e. bifurcation occurs), as the non-linear parameters of the slip surface evolve with its environmental changes (such as those induced by rainfall or human activities). If the one-state <b>variable</b> <b>friction</b> law is used in landslide modelling, velocity strengthening (i. e. dτ(ss) /dV > 0, where τ(ss) is the steady-state shear stress) in the laboratory always implies the stability of a creeping slope containing the same slip surface under gravitational pull. This conclusion, however, does not apply if a two-state <b>variable</b> <b>friction</b> law is employed to model the sliding along the slip surface.

A more realistic and precise relationship between the fuel's chemical-energy and the heat leakage is derived through the resulting temperature. The variations in power output and thermal efficiency with compression ratio, and the relations between the power output and the thermal efficiency of the cycle are presented. The results show that the power output as well as the efficiency, for which the maximum power-output occurs, will rise with the increase of maximum cycle-temperature. The temperature-dependent specific heats of the working fluid have a significant influence on the performance. The power output and the working range of the cycle increase while the efficiency decreases with the rise of specific heats of working fluid. The friction loss has a negative effect on the performance. Therefore, the power output and efficiency of the Atkinson cycle decrease with increasing friction loss.

The behavior of semi-active devices is often highly non-linear and requires suitable and efficient control algorithm. This paper presents the comparative study and performance of <b>variable</b> semi-active <b>friction</b> dampers by using recently proposed predictive control law with direct output feedback. In this control law, the variable slip force of semi-active <b>variable</b> <b>friction</b> damper is kept slightly lower than the critical friction force, which allows the damper to remain in the slip state during an earthquake, resulting in improved energy dissipation capability. This control algorithm is able to produce a continuous and smooth slip forces for a <b>variable</b> <b>friction</b> damper.

In order to suppress {{the response of the}} isolated equipment in a severe earthquake or a near-fault earthquake, SIS is able to effectively reduce the acceleration of equipment, {{and at the same time}} prevent a large isolator displacement that may damage the underlying piping system of the equipment. This is usually can not be achieved by a conventional passive isolation system...|$|R
