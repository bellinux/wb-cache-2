50|$|The <b>D</b> <b>flip-flop</b> {{captures the}} value of the D-input at a {{definite}} portion of the clock cycle (such as the rising edge of the clock). That captured value becomes the Q output. At other times, the output Q does not change. The <b>D</b> <b>flip-flop</b> {{can be viewed as a}} memory cell, a zero-order hold, or a delay line.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>D</b> <b>flip-flop</b> {{is widely}} used. It {{is also known}} as a [...] "data" [...] or [...] "delay" [...] flip-flop.|$|E
5000|$|The circuit {{is closely}} related to the gated D latch as both the {{circuits}} convert the two D input states (0 and 1) to two input combinations (01 and 10) for the output SR latch by inverting the data input signal (both the circuits split the single D signal in two complementary S and R signals). The difference is that in the gated D latch simple NAND logical gates are used while in the positive-edge-triggered <b>D</b> <b>flip-flop</b> SR NAND latches are used for this purpose. The role of these latches is to [...] "lock" [...] the active output producing low voltage (a logical zero); thus the positive-edge-triggered <b>D</b> <b>flip-flop</b> can also {{be thought of as a}} gated D latch with latched input gates.|$|E
50|$|A {{master-slave}} <b>D</b> <b>flip-flop</b> {{is created}} by connecting two gated D latches in series, and inverting the enable input to one of them. It is called master-slave because the second latch in the series only changes {{in response to a}} change in the first (master) latch.|$|E
5000|$|The JK {{flip-flop}} augments {{the behavior}} of the SR flip-flop (J=Set, K=Reset) by interpreting the J = K = 1 condition as a [...] "flip" [...] or toggle command. Specifically, the combination J = 1, K = 0 is a command to set the flip-flop; the combination J = 0, K = 1 is a command to reset the flip-flop; and the combination J = K = 1 is a command to toggle the flip-flop, i.e., change its output to the logical complement of its current value. Setting J = K = 0 maintains the current state. To synthesize a <b>D</b> <b>flip-flop,</b> simply set K equal to the complement of J. Similarly, to synthesize a T flip-flop, set K equal to J. The JK flip-flop is therefore a universal flip-flop, because it can be configured to work as an SR flip-flop, a <b>D</b> <b>flip-flop,</b> or a T flip-flop.|$|E
5000|$|When T is held high, {{the toggle}} {{flip-flop}} divides the clock frequency by two; that is, if clock frequency is 4 MHz, the output frequency {{obtained from the}} flip-flop will be 2 MHz. This [...] "divide by" [...] feature has application in various types of digital counters. A T flip-flop can also be built using a JK flip-flop (J & K pins are connected together and act as T) or a <b>D</b> <b>flip-flop</b> (T input XOR Qprevious drives the D input).|$|E
5000|$|An {{efficient}} functional {{alternative to}} a <b>D</b> <b>flip-flop</b> {{can be made with}} dynamic circuits (where information is stored in a capacitance) {{as long as it is}} clocked often enough; while not a true flip-flop, it is still called a flip-flop for its functional role. While the master-slave D element is triggered on the edge of a clock, its components are each triggered by clock levels. The [...] "edge-triggered D flip-flop", as it is called even though it is not a true flip-flop, does not have the master-slave properties.|$|E
5000|$|... (Classification: {{asynchronous}} sequential logic)An {{arrangement of}} D flip-flops are a classic method for integer-n division. Such division is frequency and phase coherent {{to the source}} over environmental variations including temperature. The easiest configuration is a series where each <b>D</b> <b>flip-flop</b> is a divide-by-2. For {{a series of three}} of these, such system would be a divide-by-8. More complicated configurations have been found that generate odd factors such as a divide-by-5. Standard, classic logic chips that implement this or similar frequency division functions include the 7456, 7457, 74292, and 74294. (see List of 7400 series integrated circuits) ...|$|E
5000|$|... iCE65 and iCE40 {{devices are}} {{constructed}} as {{an array of}} programmable logic blocks (PLBs), where a PLB is a block of eight logic cells. Each logic cell consists of a four-input lookup table (sometimes called a 4-LUT or LUT4) with the output connected to a <b>D</b> <b>flip-flop</b> (a 1-bit storage element). Within a PLB, each logic cell {{is connected to the}} following and preceding cell by carry logic, intended to improve the performance of constructs such as adders and subtractors. Interspersed with PLBs are blocks of RAM, each four kilobits in size. The number of RAM blocks varies depending on the device.|$|E
5000|$|These {{flip-flops}} {{are very}} useful, as they {{form the basis}} for shift registers, which are an essential part of many electronic devices. The advantage of the <b>D</b> <b>flip-flop</b> over the D-type [...] "transparent latch" [...] is that the signal on the D input pin is captured the moment the flip-flop is clocked, and subsequent changes on the D input will be ignored until the next clock event. An exception is that some flip-flops have a [...] "reset" [...] signal input, which will reset Q (to zero), and may be either asynchronous or synchronous with the clock.|$|E
5000|$|An {{asynchronous}} (ripple) counter is {{a single}} d-type flip-flop, with its J (data) input fed from its own inverted output. This circuit can store one bit, and hence can count from zero to one before it overflows (starts over from 0). This counter will increment once for every clock cycle and takes two clock cycles to overflow, so every cycle it will alternate between a transition from 0 to 1 and a transition from 1 to 0. Notice that this creates a new clock with a 50% duty cycle at exactly half {{the frequency of the}} input clock. If this output is then used as the clock signal for a similarly arranged <b>D</b> <b>flip-flop</b> (remembering to invert the output to the input), one will get another 1 bit counter that counts half as fast. Putting them together yields a two-bit counter: ...|$|E
5000|$|For a positive-edge {{triggered}} master-slave <b>D</b> <b>flip-flop,</b> {{when the}} clock {{signal is low}} (logical 0) the [...] "enable" [...] seen by the first or [...] "master" [...] D latch (the inverted clock signal) is high (logical 1). This allows the [...] "master" [...] latch to store the input value when the clock signal transitions from low to high. As the clock signal goes high (0 to 1) the inverted [...] "enable" [...] of the first latch goes low (1 to 0) and the value seen at the input to the master latch is [...] "locked". Nearly simultaneously, the twice inverted [...] "enable" [...] of the second or [...] "slave" [...] D latch transitions from low to high (0 to 1) with the clock signal. This allows the signal captured at the rising edge of the clock by the now [...] "locked" [...] master latch {{to pass through the}} [...] "slave" [...] latch. When the clock signal returns to low (1 to 0), the output of the [...] "slave" [...] latch is [...] "locked", and the value seen at the last rising edge of the clock is held while the [...] "master" [...] latch begins to accept new values in preparation for the next rising clock edge.|$|E
5000|$|In Fig3, {{the circuit}} shows how data {{transition}} technique can {{be beneficial for}} power saving. The XNOR logical function is performed on the input of the <b>D</b> <b>Flip-Flop</b> and the output Q. When Q and D are equal, output of the logical XNOR will be zero thereby gating the internal clock and generating no internal clock. Referring to Fig3, {{we can see that}} the circuit can be broken down into 3 parts, namely data-transition look ahead, pulse generator, clock generator. The pulse generator output is given into the clock generator which is used to clock the D flip Flop. Based on the input and output signals, if {{there is a need to}} change the state of the D flop then the clock is allowed to switch to cause a transition else the clock is not allowed to transition. When the clock is not to make a transition, some time has been already spent in computing the logic and data from the D input may make it through the first stage of the D flop and some power is consumed. this power consumption is still less than what an ordinary flop would have consumed with a clock transition and no change in output. As it can be noticed the pulse generator is still generating pulse at every external clock edge. This too can be controlled and a technique that controls this part of the circuit is Clock On Demand.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we present}} a new {{approach}} for the extension of sequential logic functionality of <b>D</b> <b>flip-flop</b> in order to perform an additional Boolean function simultaneously along with its usual bit-storage function. We show that a combinational function of the form (a · b), (a + b), (a + b) or (a · b) which occurs frequently in a feed-forward path with a <b>D</b> <b>flip-flop</b> could be implemented efficiently by a <b>D</b> <b>flip-flop</b> with RESET or SET provision. Similarly, (a⊕b) or ((a·b) ⊕c) in the feedback loop with a <b>D</b> <b>flip-flop</b> could be implemented by a T flip-flop by suitable modification of the clock. The use of such extended sequential logic is found {{to result in a}} significant reduction in critical-path and saving in area-complexity over the direct implementation. Moreover, {{we present a}} simple approach for the construction of CMOS T flip-flop by modification of clock signal of <b>D</b> <b>flip-flop,</b> which is found to be more efficient than the T flip-flop derived from JK flip-flop. The extended sequential logic is used for the implementation of finite field multiplication over GF (2 m) and carry-save addition of real numbers. In both these cases, the use of extended logic is found to offer a substantial saving in area and time-complexity over the conventional implementations.

40|$|A <b>D</b> <b>flip-flop</b> circuit {{that works}} well with long rise and fall times of the clock is characterized. This {{property}} is important when we would like to, e. g., relax the constraints on the clock distribution network or {{reduce the amount of}} noise generated in a mixed-signal circuit. Since the use of the <b>D</b> <b>flip-flop</b> allows small clock driver circuits, the amount of simultaneous switching noise can be reduced. There is also a potential for power savings with the use of smaller drivers, assuming that the short-circuit current in the flip-flops can be kept low. Moreover, the high frequency content of the clock is reduced, causing the noise that is injected into the substrate to be more easy to suppress. This is important in a mixed-signal circuit where analog circuits are present on the same substrate.

40|$|This paper enumerates {{the design}} of low power and high speed double edge {{triggered}} True Single Phase Clocking (TSPC) D- flip-flop. The TSPC CMOS flip-flop uses only one clock signal that is never inverted and it eliminates the clock skew. The originally developed TSPC flip-flop {{are very sensitive to}} the clock slope and large portion of power is spent in pre-charging the internal nodes, which makes TSPC dynamic circuits less power efficient. In the conventional CMOS design, high leakage current is becoming a significant contributor to power dissipation.

30|$|<b>D</b> <b>Flip-Flop</b> as {{a digital}} circuit {{can be used}} as a timing element in many {{sophisticated}} circuits. Therefore the optimum performance with the lowest power consumption and acceptable delay time will be critical issue in electronics circuits.|$|E
30|$|In {{sequential}} circuits {{there are}} many Flip-Flops. Since changes in the data inputs of a gated D latch flip-flop have no effect unless the clock is asserted, the propagation delay is not considered when the data inputs are entered (Mohanram 2014). In combinational logic circuits the basic blocks are the gates while in sequential logic circuits the flip flops are principal building blocks. Flip-Flops are clock based devices. Each flip flop can store one bit. D Flip Flop is the best choice in Integrated Circuit design works (Elias 2014). The <b>D</b> <b>flip-flop</b> {{is also known as}} a “data” or “delay” flip-flop. It captures the value of the D-input at a definite portion of the clock cycle and then the captured value becomes output Q. The D flip–flip {{is one of the most}} common types of flip-flops. Like all Flip Flops, it has the ability to retain one bit of digital information. <b>D</b> <b>flip-flop</b> is applicable for synchronous circuits. In this paper NSGA, NSGA-II, and proposed FNSGA-II are employed to find the best channel widths and supply voltage in which the <b>D</b> <b>Flip-Flop</b> has the lowest average power and propagation delay of proposed dual edge-triggered static <b>D</b> <b>flip-flop</b> circuit. This study is the further research of the previous article which was the single objective optimization of JK Flip-Flop layout sizes based on single objective optimization algorithms such as Ant Colony Optimization in Real or continuous domain ACOR, Fuzzy-ACOR, Genetic Algorithm GA, and Fuzzy-GA in which one objective function, the average power, was considered for minimization (Keivanian et al. 2014 a).|$|E
