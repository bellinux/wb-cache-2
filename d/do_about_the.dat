5|$|One of {{the most}} {{contentious}} issues amongst islanders {{in the 21st century}} is what to <b>do</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> rodent situation. Rodents have only been on the island since a ship ran aground in 1918 and have wiped out several endemic bird species and were thought to have done the same to the Lord Howe Island stick insect. There is a plan to drop 42 tonnes of rat bait across the island but the community is heavily divided.|$|E

Indeed, he was able to do so because more radical and more racist parties had at that time been formed and stood in the election.|$|E

He wrote to his friend, noted science fiction writer Isaac Asimov for advice on what to <b>do</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> situation. They corresponded several times on the subject, and Asimov suggested several ideas to enhance Kirk's popularity. These included placing the character in disguises to make Kirk seem more fun, or to create situations where Spock must save Kirk's life to demonstrate who the more important character was.|$|E

When they meet later, Shae tells Tyrion that she will not continue their relationship once he marries Sansa.|$|E

Captain Hitchcock and Lieutenant Thornton were bruised, while several cadets suffered minor injuries, and Fitzgerald suffered a hand injury. Worth told Thayer that between fifty and ninety cadets {{had been involved}} in the mutiny. Later that day, Thayer met with Gouverneur Kemble, an ordnance manufacturer in Cold Spring, New York, to discuss different items, including the events at West Point. Kemble asked Thayer what he would <b>do</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> misconduct, to which Thayer replied he did not know.|$|E

25|$|From the {{beginning}} of his term, Bush faced the problem of what to <b>do</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> federal budget debt. At $2.8trillion in 1990, the deficit had grown to three times larger than it was in 1980. Bush was dedicated to curbing the deficit, believing that America could not continue to be a leader in the world without doing so. He began an effort to persuade the Democratic controlled Congress to act on the budget; with Republicans believing that the best way was to cut government spending, and Democrats convinced that the only way would be to raise taxes, consensus building proved difficult.|$|E
25|$|The {{incomplete}} {{success in}} stopping inflation created an extremely difficult policy conflict. Recovery could in principle be stimulated by more expansionary credit policies and lower interest rates, which would favor increased investment, depreciation {{of the currency}} to help producers compete against imports, and improved exports. But continuing inflation {{and the fear of}} accelerating its rate of increase argued instead for keeping a very tight rein on credit and thereby blocked the actions needed for recovery. This conflict became particularly acute over the question of what to <b>do</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> exchange note: the real exchange rate went in exactly the wrong direction for recovery by appreciating when depreciation was both expected and needed.|$|E
25|$|Before the 2004-2005 {{academic}} year, a few schools, {{most notably}} Trace Crossings Elementary, had almost, {{if not more}} than, 1,000 students, resulting {{in the building of}} Riverchase Elementary. After that, the case of overcrowding was resolved, with many students moving to the new school. However, a similar case has occurred with Bumpus Middle School, resulting in meetings at multiple district schools to discuss what to <b>do</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> case. For the 2011-2012 academic year, Bumpus Middle School and its students were moved to the former freshman center of Hoover High School, and the old Bumpus site became Brock's Gap Intermediate School, which serves 5th and 6th graders. Bumpus Middle School now serves 7th and 8th graders.|$|E

25|$|The defeat {{caused a}} great shift in policy {{for many other}} states, as well. States which had until now been neutral joined with Sparta, {{assuming}} that Athens's defeat was imminent. Many of Athens' allies in the Delian League also revolted, and although the city immediately began to rebuild its fleet, there was little they could <b>do</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> revolts for the time being. The expedition and consequent disaster left Athens reeling. Some 10,000 hoplites had perished and, though this was a blow, the real concern was {{the loss of the}} huge fleet dispatched to Sicily. Triremes could be replaced, but the 30,000 experienced oarsmen lost in Sicily were irreplaceable and Athens had to rely on ill-trained slaves to form the backbone of her new fleet.|$|E
25|$|The 7th Cavalry, Custer commanding, {{departed}} from Fort Abraham Lincoln on May 17, 1876, {{part of a}} larger army force planning to round up remaining free Indians. Meanwhile, {{in the spring and summer}} of 1876, the Hunkpapa Lakota holy man Sitting Bull had called together the largest ever gathering of Plains Indians at Ash Creek, Montana (later moved to the Little Bighorn River) to discuss what to <b>do</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> whites. It was this united encampment of Lakota, Northern Cheyenne, and Arapaho Indians that the 7th met at the Battle of the Little Bighorn in the Crow Indian Reservation created in old Crow Country. (In the Fort Laramie Treaty (1851), the valley of the Little Bighorn is in the heart of the Crow Indian treaty territory and accepted as such by the Lakota, the Cheyenne and the Arapaho). The Lakotas were staying in the valley without consent from the Crow tribe, which sided with the Army to expel the Indian invaders.|$|E
25|$|The central concept {{around which}} this play is built is {{the dilemma of}} what to do with Harry and Edna. Their {{situation}} is the focal point for all the characters, including Harry and Edna themselves. Albee uses this dilemma to cause emotions to rise. As his characters try to figure out what to <b>do</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Harry and Edna, they have a series of discussions or debates that slowly rise in emotional temperature. Each character has his or her definition of what the dilemma is, as well as a means for resolving it. The tension in the play rises with the rise of emotions as the characters move toward a climax or a moment of truth. This moment is played out most specifically by Tobias and Harry in the conversation that defines their friendship: one that is built on rights and responsibilities rather than love and affection. In the end, Harry and Edna decide to go back home, thus solving, or at least releasing some of the tension of the dilemma.|$|E

25|$|The UNESCO Expert Working Group on Afghan {{cultural}} projects convened {{to discuss}} what to <b>do</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> two statues between 3–4 March 2011 in Paris. Researcher Erwin Emmerling of Technical University Munich announced he believed {{it would be possible}} to restore the smaller statue using an organic silicon compound. The Paris conference issued a list of 39 recommendations for the safeguarding of the Bamiyan site. These included leaving the larger Western niche empty as a monument to the destruction of the Buddhas, a feasibility study into the rebuilding of the Eastern Buddha, and the construction of a central museum and several smaller site museums. Work has since begun on restoring the Buddhas using the process of anastylosis, where original elements are combined with modern material. It is estimated that roughly half the pieces of the Buddhas can be put back together according to Bert Praxenthaler, a German art historian and sculptor involved in the restoration. The restoration of the caves and Buddhas has also involved training and employing local people as stone carvers. The project, which also aims to encourage tourism to the area, is being organised by UNESCO and the International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS).|$|E
