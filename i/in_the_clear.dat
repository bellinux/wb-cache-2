The Allies took this coded response as non-acceptance of the terms.|$|E
5|$|In the {{run up to}} the 1911 Varsity Match, the Poulton–Geen {{partnership}} was {{a constant}} threat to opposition teams. Ten days before the Varsity Match, Oxford beat London Scottish 39–3. Twice Poulton put Geen <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>clear,</b> with the latter ending the day with four tries in total. On 12 December, Cambridge were favourites to win but Poulton captained Oxford to victory, {{in front of a}} crowd of 10,000. Geen's form coming into the game was suspect but he proved his worth. However, Poulton suffered a hamstring injury early on and his replacement Eric Thomas, a forward, lacked the speed and skills to combine effectively with Geen. Nevertheless, he came close to scoring, but, as he had done in the previous year's match, he dropped the ball over the tryline. He was to repeat the error the following year.|$|E

By publishing Strand’s work Stieglitz was hastening the end of the aesthetic vision he had championed for so long.|$|E

Without timely treatment, these new blood vessels can bleed, cloud vision, and destroy the retina. Fibrovascular proliferation can also cause tractional retinal detachment.
