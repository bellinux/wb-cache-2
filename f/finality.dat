5|$|Exclusion of {{judicial}} review has been attempted by the Parliament of Singapore to protect the exercise of executive power. Typically, this has been done though the insertion of <b>finality</b> or total ouster clauses into Acts of Parliament, or by wording powers conferred by Acts on decision-makers subjectively. <b>Finality</b> clauses are generally viewed restrictively by courts in the United Kingdom. The courts there have taken the view that such clauses are, subject to some exceptions, not effective in denying or restricting {{the extent to which}} the courts are able to exercise judicial review. In contrast, Singapore cases suggest that ouster clauses cannot prevent the High Court from exercising supervisory jurisdiction over the exercise of executive power where authorities have committed jurisdictional errors of law, but are effective against non-jurisdictional errors of law.|$|E
5|$|An ouster {{clause in}} a statute {{is an attempt}} by the {{legislature}} to prevent an act or decision by a public authority from being challenged before the courts. Such clauses thus serve as a signal to decision-makers that they may operate without fear of intervention by the courts at a later stage. One common kind of ouster clause is the total ouster or <b>finality</b> clause, which is inserted into a statute to indicate that the decision of a particular judge or tribunal is final and cannot be challenged by any court.|$|E
5|$|The fourth movement, in sonata form {{but with}} {{characteristics}} of a rondo, is replete with Haydnesque false recapitulations and conclusions. In one example, the music lands in the tonic {{at the end of}} the recapitulation and apparent coda, and is followed by two measures of complete silence, creating an illusion of <b>finality.</b> However, the main theme is then reprised, and the real conclusion to the work follows some 20 measures later.|$|E

5|$|Unlike a total ouster or <b>finality</b> clause {{which seeks}} to {{preclude}} judicial review entirely, a partial ouster or time limit clause specifies a restricted period of time after which no remedy will be available. Such clauses are generally effective, unless the public authority has acted in bad faith, {{in which case the}} decision impugned may be subject to judicial review even though the time permitted for challenging it has lapsed.|$|E
5|$|In {{describing}} the narrator's analysis of his surroundings, Gray employed John Locke's {{philosophy of the}} sensations, which argued that the senses were the origin of ideas. Information described {{in the beginning of}} the poem is reused by the narrator as he contemplates life near the end. The description of death and obscurity adopts Locke's political philosophy as it emphasises the inevitability and <b>finality</b> of death. The end of the poem is connected to Locke's An Essay Concerning Human Understanding in that the beginning of the poem deals with the senses and the ending describes how we are limited in our ability to understand the world. The poem takes the ideas and transforms them into a discussion of blissful ignorance by adopting Locke's resolution to be content with our limited understanding. Unlike Locke, the narrator of the poem knows that he is unable to fathom the universe, but still questions the matter.|$|E
5|$|More generally, the Report {{made the}} {{argument}} in favor of the sovereignty of the individual states, for which it is best known. The basic message was that the states were the ultimate parties constituting the federal compact, and that therefore the individual states were ultimate arbiters of whether the compact had been broken by the usurpation of power. This doctrine is known as the compact theory. It was the presence of this argument in the Resolutions that had allowed the Federalists to paint the Democratic-Republicans as leaning toward secession; in the amended Report the line is moderated, with an emphasis that it is the states as political societies of the people (and therefore, one reads in, not the state legislatures alone) which possess this power. Either formulation would help the Democratic-Republican cause by refuting the <b>finality</b> of any constitutional interpretation advanced by the Congress and federal judiciary, both of which were dominated by Federalists.|$|E

Like the narrator of Moby Dick (Melville,  1851),  I am convinced that the finest achievements of human beings have been left incomplete.

" Like Herman Melville (and Kierkegaard and Dostoievsky and Camus and Dewey)   I object to closed systems,  to fixities,  to <b>finalities.</b> Definitions of art are always open to questioning. Indeed,  an object,  an arrangement of sounds or movements, {{although}} labeled as a work of art,  does not serve as art for the individual unless it gives rise to an aesthetic experience. That means moving from an ordinary,  commonplace experience (walking to work,  calling a class to order)   to an extraordinary experience,  one involving perceptions,  insights,  feelings that highlight details of the surrounding world,  {{and moments}} of “unconcealment ”  that reveal unexpected lights and shadows that alter the familiar shape of things. I think of Jacob Lawrence's "Great Migration Series ”  (194041),  paintings of oppressed former slaves desperate to travel north to what they hope will be a better life. Pervading the works is a sense of terrible deficiency,  of lies and deprivation that call out for repair.

5|$|The Battle of Atlanta was {{a battle}} of the Atlanta Campaign fought during the American Civil War on July 22, 1864, just {{southeast}} of Atlanta, Georgia. Continuing their summer campaign to seize the important rail and supply center of Atlanta, Union forces commanded by William Tecumseh Sherman overwhelmed and defeated Confederate forces defending the city under John Bell Hood. Union Maj. Gen. James B. McPherson was killed during the battle. Despite the implication of <b>finality</b> in its name, the battle occurred midway through the campaign, and the city did not fall until September 2, 1864, after a Union siege and various attempts to seize railroads and supply lines leading to Atlanta. After taking the city, Sherman's troops headed south-southeastward toward Milledgeville, the state capital, and on to Savannah with the March to the Sea.|$|E
5|$|The {{debate among}} monks unfolds in the {{presence}} of their teachers, with a very well set rules of procedure for the defender and the questioners. The tradition of such debates is traced to the ancient ‘Hindu Orthodoxy’ in India and this practice permeated into Buddhist orthodoxy in Tibet in the eighth century. Such debates usually take place within the monastery’s precincts. The defender has the onus to prove his point of view on the subject proposed for debate. The debate opens with an invocation to Manjushri recited in a loud and high pitched tone. The roles of the debater and the questioner are well defined; the questioner has to succinctly present his case (all on Buddhism related topics) and the defender has to answer within a fixed time frame. The <b>finality</b> of the debate is with specific answers like: “I accept (do), the reason is not established (ta madrup) or there is no pervasion (Kyappa majung)”. Many a time, the questions mooted are meant to mislead the defender. If the defender does not reply within a time frame, an expression of derision is witnessed. In the Tibetan debating sessions, there is no role for a witness and there is normally no adjudicator. This leads to “conflicting opinions of participants and listeners.” When there is direct contradiction on the defenders part, the outcome is, however, formally decided.|$|E

25|$|On {{the other}} end of the spectrum, there is the green-light {{approach}} derived from the utilitarian school of thought associated with legal philosophers such as Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill. The green-light approach regards state involvement as an effective means to facilitate the delivery of communitarian goals. Hence, ouster clauses are regarded as useful devices to keep a conservatively inclined judiciary at bay. One such communitarian goal achieved by ouster clauses is that it results in consistency and <b>finality</b> in the implementation of policy considerations by encouraging specialist bodies to act as adjudicators in certain areas of administration.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the main}} sources of dispute during his {{lifetime}} and continuing since then is Ghulam Ahmad's use of the terms nabi ("prophet") and rasool (messenger) when referring to himself. Most non-Ahmadi Muslims consider Muhammad {{to be the last}} of the prophets and believe that Ghulam Ahmad's use of these terms is a violation of the concept of the <b>Finality</b> of Prophethood. His followers fall into two factions in this regards. The Ahmadiyya Muslim Community, which comprises by far the majority of Ahmadis, believes that Ghulam Ahmad's prophetic status does not in any way infringe the <b>finality</b> of Muhammad's prophethood – to which it is wholly subservient and from which it is inseparable – and is in accordance with scriptural prophecies concerning the advent of the Messiah in Islam. This group is currently headed by Ghulam Ahmad's fifth caliph, or successor, carrying the title of Khalifatul Masih, an institution believed to have been established soon after his death. The Lahore Ahmadiyya Movement, which comprises a small fraction of all Ahmadis and believes in an allegorical understanding of these terms with reference to Ghulam Ahmad, formed in 1914 when a number of prominent Ahmadis seceded from the main body soon after the election of Mirza Mahmud Ahmad as the second caliph. This group is administered by a body of people called the Anjuman Ishaat-e-Islam ("movement for the propagation of Islam"), headed by an Emir.|$|E
