40|$|In modern {{processors}} {{floating point}} divide operations often take 20 to 25 clock cycles, {{five times that}} of multiplication. Typically multiplicative algorithms with quadratic convergence are used for high-performance <b>divide.</b> A <b>divide</b> <b>unit</b> based on the multiplicative Newton-Raphson iteration is proposed. This <b>divide</b> <b>unit</b> utilizes the higher-order Newton-Raphson reciprocal approximation to compute the quotient fast, efficiently and with high throughput. The <b>divide</b> <b>unit</b> achieves fast execution by computing the square, cube and higher powers of the approximation directly and much faster than the traditional approach with serial multiplications. Additionally, the second, third, and higher-order terms are computed simultaneously further reducing the divide latency. Significant hardware reductions have been identified that reduce the overall computation significantly and therefore, reduce the area required for implementation and the power consumed by the computation. The proposed hardware unit is designed to achieve the desired quotient precision in a single iteration allowing the unit to be fully pipelined for maximum throughput. ...|$|R

40|$|A Multiplicative <b>divide</b> {{hardware}} <b>unit</b> {{based on}} the Newton-Raphson iteration is proposed. This <b>divide</b> <b>unit</b> utilizes higher order Newton-Raphson reciprocal approximations to compute the reciprocal fast, eciently and with high throughput. The divider achieves fast computation by utilizing parallel squaring and cubing units. These units compute {{the second and third}} order NewtonRaphson terms signicantly faster than the traditional approach using multipliers. Furthermore, the second and third order terms are computed in parallel further reducing the divide latency. The design space for a 24 -bit operand has been studied and signicant hardware reductions have been identied. The proposed hardware unit does not iterate to a solution, therefore, the implementation may be fully pipelined for high throughput.
