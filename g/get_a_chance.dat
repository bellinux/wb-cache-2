5|$|Over time, the game's {{mechanisms}} for contacting players grew more complex. Players were sent messages via email, called on their cell phones, and travelled to arranged meetings between players and characters. The game culminated by inviting {{players of the}} game to visit one of four cinemas where they could <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to play Halo 2 before its release and collect a commemorative DVD.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{decision}} to disband the Ranger units, the 2nd Ranger Company was deactivated on 1 August 1951 while it was still in Korea. Like many of the other Ranger units, most of the 2nd Ranger Company veterans were folded into the 187th RCT. As an airborne unit, it was believed that by sending the men to the 187th, their airborne skills could be used. Nevertheless, in the end it turned out that Operation Tomahawk was the last airborne jump of the war and as a result, the former Rangers did not <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to exercise these skills again.|$|E
5|$|I {{think we}} all know that we're going to hear {{announcements}} like this more often. A lot of people don’t seem to understand that we can’t keep producing records if you keep not paying for them. Bands are having to sell beautiful albums for €2.99, labels can’t give you as much support since they’re losing income too and our alternative radio stations* are practically non existent now, meaning so many wonderful bands will not <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to get played on radio as they’ll be competing with huge pop acts.|$|E

5|$|In 1934 Gandhi {{resigned}} from Congress party membership. He did not {{disagree with the}} party's position but felt that if he resigned, his popularity with Indians would cease to stifle the party's membership, which actually varied, including communists, socialists, trade unionists, students, religious conservatives, and those with pro-business convictions, and that these various voices would <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to make themselves heard. Gandhi also wanted to avoid being a target for Raj propaganda by leading a party that had temporarily accepted political accommodation with the Raj.|$|E
5|$|Many young enforcers need to {{establish}} their role early in their career to avoid losing their jobs. Due to the farm systems that most professional hockey leagues use, enforcers who <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> {{to play at the}} level above their current one (for example, an AHL player getting a chance to play in an NHL game) need to show other players, coaches, and fans that they are worthy of the enforcer role on the team.

5|$|Areola would <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> in Ligue 1, however, as Claude Makélélé's Bastia {{stepped in}} to sign him on loan for the 2014–15 Ligue 1 campaign, with the deal being {{completed}} on 26 July 2014. Signed as the replacement for the retired Mickaël Landreau, he made his debut for the club on 9 August in a 3–3 draw with Marseille. Areola ultimately made 39 appearances across all competitions for the club, keeping 13 clean sheets as Bastia ended the Ligue 1 season in 12th place and as runners-up in the Coupe de la Ligue. The Final, which took place on 11 April, was contested between Bastia and Areola's parent club PSG, with the match ending 4–0 in favour of the Parisians.|$|E

5|$|He was {{selected}} for the Commonwealth Bank Series, playing four games and scoring 96 runs {{at an average of}} 24 with a top score of 47. He also succeeded in taking 6 wickets at an average of 31.16; his best figures were 3/16. His strong performances led to his inclusion in the Asia Cup squad. He played three matches and did not <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to bat but he proved himself with the ball taking 4/32 in the first match of the series against Sri Lanka. He picked up two more wickets in the next two games. He was the part of the team touring South Africa for the one T20 played on 31 March 2012 where he had figures of 4–0–44–1 but was yet to bat. Pathan also played for the Delhi Daredevils the Indian Premier League in 2012, taking only 8 wickets from 17 matches with an average of 58.12.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} season, {{he played}} in the Country trials in Brisbane. He was selected for the Queensland Colts in 193233 and represented Queensland Country against Douglas Jardine's England cricket team during the Bodyline tour. In England's innings of 376, Tallon conceded only five byes and stumped Herbert Sutcliffe, {{regarded as one of the}} finest batsmen in Test history. He did not <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to display his batting prowess as the Bodyline spearhead Harold Larwood rattled him with a series of deliveries aimed at the throat, before bowling him for two. Tallon's fast and efficient skills behind the stumps further caught the eye of cricket officials in early 1933 at the Country Week Carnivals. Tallon distinguished himself with his tidy keeping to the express pace bowling of Eddie Gilbert, whose suspect action and indigenous heritage were later the subject of controversy.|$|E
5|$|The first Test {{match of}} the tour, on 24 December 1949 at Johannesburg, saw him score 14runs {{in the first}} innings before falling leg before wicket (LBW) to Cuan McCarthy, and taking three catches as South Africa were forced to follow on, Australia winning by an innings and 85 runs. In the Second Test at Cape Town, Saggers did <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to bat, with Australia declaring for 526 before he had the {{opportunity}} in the first innings. South Africa were forced to follow-on (bat twice in a row) and were defeated by eight wickets. He did, however, complete three stumpings in South Africa's first innings off the bowling of Colin McCool, along with four catches in the match. He also took two catches and completed one stumping in the Third Test, and made two runs in the first innings, {{though he did not}} bat in the second as Australia won by five wickets. The Fourth Test, again in Johannesburg, saw Saggers score five not out in the first innings and, though not being required to bat in the second innings as the match ended in a draw, taking two catches.|$|E

5|$|The {{separation}} of static and dynamic data to reduce write amplification {{is not a}} simple process for the SSD controller. The process requires the SSD controller to separate the LBAs with data which is constantly changing and requiring rewriting (dynamic data) from the LBAs with data which rarely changes and does not require any rewrites (static data). If the data is mixed in the same blocks, as with almost all systems today, any rewrites will require the SSD controller to garbage collect both the dynamic data (which caused the rewrite initially) and static data (which did not require any rewrite). Any garbage collection of data that would not have otherwise required moving will increase write amplification. Therefore, separating the data will enable static data to stay at rest and if it never gets rewritten it will have the lowest possible write amplification for that data. The drawback to this process is that somehow the SSD controller must still find a way to wear level the static data because those blocks that never change will not <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to be written to their maximum P/E cycles.|$|E
5|$|When Raghavan {{is about}} to leave his house for a {{marriage}} proposal, Sundaram comes there and describes the girl {{he was talking about}} to Raghavan.

Sundaram becomes a star after his debut film Appavi Kanavan ("Innocent Husband") becomes a success and believes that his stardom and popularity will help him in attaining his love. When Radha comes to Sundaram's house to congratulate him, he introduces her to Raghavan, who is present at that time. As Sundaram goes to prepare snacks for the two, Radha asks Raghavan why he did not show up for the marriage proposal. Raghavan states that he thought Radha loved Sundaram. Shocked, Radha informs Raghavan that she likes Sundaram for his innocence, although she does not love him. Raghavan is pleasantly surprised, but to ensure that Sundaram's film career does not suffer from discovering the truth, he asks Radha to keep it a secret.|$|E
