50|$|Cocaine is {{extensively}} metabolized, {{primarily in}} the liver, with only about 1% excreted unchanged in the urine. The metabolism is dominated by hydrolytic ester cleavage, so the eliminated metabolites consist mostly of benzoylecgonine (BE), the major metabolite, and other significant metabolites in lesser amounts such as <b>ecgonine</b> methyl ester (EME) and <b>ecgonine.</b> Further minor metabolites of cocaine include norcocaine, p-hydroxycocaine, m-hydroxycocaine, p-hydroxybenzoylecgonine (pOHBE), and m-hydroxybenzoylecgonine. If consumed with alcohol, cocaine combines with alcohol in the liver to form cocaethylene. Studies have suggested cocaethylene is both more euphoric, and has a higher cardiovascular toxicity than cocaine by itself.|$|E

50|$|Structurally, <b>ecgonine</b> is a cycloheptane {{derivative}} with a nitrogen bridge. It {{is obtained}} by hydrolysis of cocaine with acids or alkalis, and crystallizes with one molecule of water, the crystals melting at 198-199 °C.

50|$|Cocaethylene is the {{byproduct}} of concurrent {{consumption of alcohol}} and cocaine as metabolized by the liver. Normally, metabolism of cocaine produces two primarily biologically inactive metabolites—benzoylecgonine and <b>ecgonine</b> methyl ester. The hepatic enzyme carboxylesterase {{is an important part}} of cocaine's metabolism because it acts as a catalyst for the hydrolysis of cocaine in the liver, which produces these inactive metabolites. If ethanol is present during the metabolism of cocaine, a portion of the cocaine undergoes transesterification with ethanol, rather than undergoing hydrolysis with water, which results in the production of cocaethylene.|$|E
50|$|Radiolabelled {{forms of}} CFT {{have been used}} in humans and animals to map the {{distribution}} of dopamine transporters in the brain. CFT was found to be particularly useful for this application as a normal fluorine atom can be substituted with the radioactive isotope 18F which is widely used in Positron emission tomography. Another radioisotope-substituted analog 11CWIN 35,428 (where the carbon atom of either the N-methyl group, or the methyl from the 2-carbomethoxy group of CFT, has been replaced with 11C) is now more commonly used for this application, as it is quicker and easier in practice to make radiolabelled CFT by methylating nor-CFT or 2-desmethyl-CFT than by reacting methylecgonidine with parafluorophenylmagnesium bromide, and also avoids the requirement for a licence to work with the restricted precursor <b>ecgonine.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{pharmacologically}} {{active ingredient}} of coca is the cocaine alkaloid, which {{is found in}} the amount of about 0.3 to 1.5%, averaging 0.8%, in fresh leaves. Besides cocaine, the coca leaf contains a number of other alkaloids, including methylecgonine cinnamate, benzoylecgonine, truxilline, hydroxytropacocaine, tropacocaine, <b>ecgonine,</b> cuscohygrine, dihydrocuscohygrine, nicotine, and hygrine. When chewed, coca acts as a mild stimulant and suppresses hunger, thirst, pain, and fatigue. [...] Absorption of coca from the leaf is less rapid than nasal application of purified forms of the alkaloid (almost all of the coca alkaloid is absorbed within 20 minutes of nasal application, while it takes 2-12 hours after ingestion of the raw leaf for alkaline concentrations to peak.). When the raw leaf is consumed in tea, between 59 and 90% of the coca alkaloid is absorbed.|$|E
50|$|Urine {{drug test}} kits are {{available}} as on-site tests, or laboratory analysis. Urinalysis {{is the most}} common test type and used by federally mandated drug testing programs and is considered the Gold Standard of drug testing. Urine based tests have been upheld in most courts for more than 30 years. However, urinalysis conducted by the Department of Defense has been challenged for reliability of testing the metabolite of cocaine. There are two associated metabolites of cocaine, benzoylecgonine (BZ) and <b>ecgonine</b> methyl ester (EME), the first (BZ) is created by the presence of cocaine in an aqeous solution with a pH greater than 7.0, while the second (EME) results from the actual human metabolic process. The presence of EME confirms actual ingestion of cocaine by a human being, while the presence of BZ is indicative only. BZ without EME is evidence of sample contamination, however, the US Department of Defense has chosen not to test for EME in its urinalysis program.|$|E
40|$|A {{mixed culture}} that could utilize cocaine {{as the sole}} source of carbon and energy for growth was {{isolated}} by selective enrichment. The individual microorganisms within this mixed culture were identified as Pseudomonas fluorescens (termed MBER) and Comamonas acidovorans (termed MBLF). Each microorganism was shown to be unable to grow to any appreciable extent on 10 mM cocaine {{in the absence of}} the other. C. acidovorans MBLF was found to possess an inducible cocaine esterase which catalyzed the hydrolysis of cocaine to <b>ecgonine</b> methyl ester and benzoate. C. acidovorans was capable of growth on benzoate at concentrations below 5 mM but was unable to metabolize <b>ecgonine</b> methyl ester. P. fluorescens MBER was capable of growth on either benzoate as the sole source of carbon or <b>ecgonine</b> methyl ester as the sole source of carbon and nitrogen. P. fluorescens MBER was found to initiate the degradation of <b>ecgonine</b> methyl ester via <b>ecgonine,</b> pseudoecgonine, and pseudoecgonyl-coenzyme A. Subcellular studies resulted in the identification of an <b>ecgonine</b> methyl esterase, an <b>ecgonine</b> epimerase, and a pseudoecgonyl-coenzyme A synthetase which were induced by growth on <b>ecgonine</b> methyl ester or <b>ecgonine.</b> Further metabolism of the <b>ecgonine</b> moiety is postulated to involve nitrogen debridging, with the production of carbonyl-containing intermediates...|$|E
40|$|We have {{previously}} reported {{a method for}} the analysis of <b>ecgonine</b> together with other polar cocaine metabolites n postmortem blood (1). The findings in that manuscript and our subsequent experience (2, 3) have shown that <b>ecgonine</b> is consistently present in postmortem blood specimens; it origins, however, are usually open to debate and discussion (4 - 6). Application of the method in carefully preserved whole blood specimens fro cocaine addicts reporting to an emergency room have also shown <b>ecgonine</b> to be consistently present (3). This uggests hat at least in high doses, often chronic ocaine administration, <b>ecgonine</b> w ll be present during life also. Our intent in the work that led to our original publication was to investigate he utility of <b>ecgonine</b> as a potentially longer-lived marker than benzoylecgonine of past cocaine use. All our findings to date however have indicated that he detection windows for benzoylecgonine and cgonine are approximately th same, at least at our limit of detection (10 ng/mL) (1 - 3). Other workers have documented the instability ofboth cocaine and its monoester metabolites, benzoylecgonine a d <b>ecgonine</b> methyl ester, during in vitro storage of blood (4, 5). It is likely {{that at least some of}} the loss of these primary metabolites is via a secondary de-esterification to <b>ecgonine.</b> Consequently, the true value of an assay for <b>ecgonine</b> may be its ability to detect what is likely the final in vitro degradation product following cocaine use. <b>Ecgonine</b> would thus be the analyte of choice in cases in which a specimen has been collected without an enzyme-inhibiting preservative orat temperatures known to be inadequate for the preservation fcocaine or its primary monoester metabolites (4, 5) ...|$|E

In 13 of these patients, unique ethanol-related cocaine metabolites, cocaethylene and <b>ecgonine</b> ethyl ester (EEE), were detected in urine and serum. One was from a newborn baby whose mother's blood was positive for cocaine and negative for cocaethylene. In two other patients, isopropanol was also consumed with cocaine and ethanol. In one of these two, cocaisopropylene and <b>ecgonine</b> isopropyl ester (EPE) were identified in urine.

40|$|The {{two major}} {{metabolites}} of cocaine {{that are found}} in urine are benzoylecgonine (BE) and <b>ecgonine</b> methyl ester (EME) (1 - 3). Benzoylecgonine is the metabolite that is normally used to identify cocaine misuse (4). The determination f <b>ecgonine</b> methyl ester in urine, however, can provide valuable and important forensic information as {{to the source of}} BE (5 - 6). Laboratories should therefore be able to provide information on EME in addition to BE when requested. We present a rapid and sensitive procedure for the identification of the other major metabolite of cocaine in urine, <b>ecgonine</b> methyl ester. <b>Ecgonine</b> methyl ester hydrochloride was purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. To 2. 5 mL of urine (standard, control, unknown), 2. 5 mL of 0. 15 M borate buffer (pH 9. 2) was added and the mixture was vortexed. Five milliliters of chloroform/isobutanol (98 : 2, v/v) was added. The tubes were shaken for 3 min on a shaker at low speed and then centrifuged for 3 min. The upper aqueous layer was aspirated, and the lower layer was transferred to a small disposable tube and evaporated to dryness. The residue was reconstituted with 50 /zL of methanol, and 1 /zL was injected into a gas chromatograph with a nitrogen selective detector (NPD). A Hewlett-Packard 530 # megabore column, 10 m x 0. 53 mm i. d., 50 % phenylmethylsilicone, wasused for separating the compounds. Helium was used as carrier gas at a flow rate of 20 mL/min.

40|$|A {{simple and}} rapid {{procedure}} {{has been developed}} and validated for the simultaneous determination of benzoylecgonine and <b>ecgonine</b> methyl ester in human urine samples. After extraction and sample cleanup by solid-phase extraction (SPE), the extracts were derivatized with 50 uL of MTBSTFA and analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). The limit of detection (LOD) was 50 ng/mL for both metabolites. The recoveries were 81 % and 75. 3 % for benzoylecgonine and <b>ecgonine</b> methyl ester, respectively. The intra-assay precision (% relative standard deviation) at two different added amounts (200 and 1000 ng/mL) in urine matrix varied from 4. 8 to 8. 4 and from 4. 4 to 5. 7, respectively.

Urine EC concentrations peaked later than all other analytes and had longer detection times than the other minor metabolites. With a 50 ng/mL cutoff concentration and following low doses of 10 to 45 mg cocaine by multiple routes, detection times extended up to 98 h. Maximum concentrations (Cmax) were 6 – 14 mole % of those for benzoylecgonine, Cmax increased with dose, time to maximum concentration (Tmax) was independent of dose, and route of administration did not {{have a significant impact on}} Cmax or Tmax for metabolites. EC is an analyte to consider for identifying cocaine use due to its stability in urine and long detection times...|$|E
