5|$|The Albanian government, in {{agreement}} with the Commission, had the right to appoint and dismiss governors and upper rank officials, taking into account the demographic composition of the local religious communities. Other terms included the proportional recruitment of natives into the local gendarmerie, and the prohibition of military levies from non-indigenous people of the region. In Orthodox schools, the Greek language would be the sole medium of instruction, except <b>for</b> <b>grades</b> one through three. However, religious education would be exclusively in Greek. Moreover, Greek was also made equal to Albanian in all public affairs, including courts and elective councils.|$|E
5|$|As state superintendent, Paulus helped {{introduce}} statewide assessment testing <b>for</b> <b>grades</b> 3, 5, 8, and 11 in 1991. Other education reforms introduced {{that year}} were the Certificate of Initial Mastery (CIM) and Certificate of Advanced Mastery (CAM) {{that were designed}} to replace the high school diploma in Oregon. These were optional programs which {{were part of a}} broader program that included issuing a report card outlining the progress as a state, as required by a law the state legislature passed in 1991. Paulus also supported school to work initiatives for reforming public education while in office, which were part of the 1991 reforms. At the time Paulus was one of only ten women in the nation to hold the top education position in their state. She left the office on January 4, 1999, after two terms. In 2007, the Oregon Legislature eliminated the optional certificates from schools in the state.|$|E

5|$|Between 1986 and 1996, River Oaks Elementary School only {{admitted}} {{magnet school}} students {{from other areas}} of the city. The community was divided between the attendance zones of Wilson Elementary School (opened in 1925), the now closed Will Rogers Elementary School (opened in 1950, closed in summer 2006), and Poe Elementary School. By 1995 River Oaks Elementary {{became one of the most}} prestigious elementary schools in Houston and had a waiting list. By that year several new families had established themselves in River Oaks and many of them were interested in sending their children to public school. In 1995, several River Oaks parents petitioned HISD to re-establish the neighborhood program at River Oaks Elementary School which allows non-magnet students residing in the school's boundaries to attend. Some magnet parents opposed, believing that the River Oaks program would reduce racial diversity at the school. In 1996, HISD added a neighborhood program to the school <b>for</b> <b>grades</b> Kindergarten through 2nd, with grades 3 through 5 phased in over a subsequent three-year period.|$|E

40|$|To {{establish}} a cytological scoring {{system for the}} assessment of tumor grade in endometrial cancer, 11 cytological items were examined in 45 patients with this cancer. Four items (the cluster rate, cluster edges, anisokaryosis, and macronucleoli or irregular nucleoli) were shown to have value for determining the tumor grade, and a scoring system was created using these four items. Tumor grading was then performed in 109 patients with endometrial curettage, and the results were compared with the pathological tumor grade. The diagnostic accuracy of cytological tumor grading was 88 % <b>for</b> <b>grade</b> 1, 63 % <b>for</b> <b>grade</b> 2, and 82 % <b>for</b> <b>grade</b> 3 tumors, with an overall accuracy of 78 %.
