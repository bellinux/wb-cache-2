5|$|The Earth's {{crust is}} made of {{approximately}} 5% of heavy metals by weight, with iron comprising 95% of this quantity. Light metals (~20%) and nonmetals (~75%) make up the other 95% of the crust.

5|$|Caroline Island is {{believed}} to have originated from a volcanic hotspot which eroded and then became home to a coral reef which grew above the ocean surface. Although these <b>geological</b> <b>processes</b> are poorly understood, the orientation of the Line Islands (roughly north-south) suggests that they were formed more than 40 million years ago, before the Pacific Plate changed its direction of travel. The same hotspot more recently gave rise to the Tuamotu Archipelago.|$|E

5|$|The {{analysis}} of relative concentrations of samarium and neodymium isotopes 147Sm, 144Nd, and 143Nd allows {{the determination of}} the age and origin of rocks and meteorites in samarium–neodymium dating. Both elements are lanthanides and have very similar physical and chemical properties. Therefore, Sm–Nd dating is either insensitive to partitioning of the marker elements during various <b>geological</b> <b>processes,</b> or such partitioning can well be understood and modeled from the ionic radii of the involved elements.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, {{observations}} from Earth {{were made of}} Triton's limb as it passed in front of stars. These observations indicated {{the presence of a}} denser atmosphere than was deduced from Voyager 2 data. Other observations have shown an increase in temperature by 5% from 1989 to 1998. These observations indicate Triton is approaching an unusually warm summer season that happens only once every few hundred years. Theories for this warming include a change of frost patterns on Triton's surface and a change in ice albedo, which would allow more heat to be absorbed. Another theory argues the changes in temperature are a result of deposition of dark, red material from <b>geological</b> <b>processes.</b> Because Triton's Bond albedo is among the highest within the Solar System, it is sensitive to small variations in spectral albedo.|$|E
5|$|Many of Titan's craters or {{probable}} craters display {{evidence of}} extensive erosion, and all show {{some indication of}} modification. Most large craters have breached or incomplete rims, {{despite the fact that}} some craters on Titan have relatively more massive rims than those anywhere else in the Solar System. There is little evidence of formation of palimpsests through viscoelastic crustal relaxation, unlike on other large icy moons. Most craters lack central peaks and have smooth floors, possibly due to impact-generation or later eruption of cryovolcanic lava. Infill from various <b>geological</b> <b>processes</b> is one reason for Titan's relative deficiency of craters; atmospheric shielding also plays a role. It is estimated that Titan's atmosphere reduces the number of craters on its surface by a factor of two.|$|E

5|$|The longest-lived {{and most}} {{abundant}} (nearly 100%) naturally occurring isotope of protactinium, protactinium-231, has a half-life of 32,760 {{years and is}} a decay product of uranium-235. Much smaller trace amounts of the short-lived nuclear isomer protactinium-234m occur in the decay chain of uranium-238. Protactinium-233 results from the decay of thorium-233 {{as part of the}} chain of events used to produce uranium-233 by neutron irradiation of thorium-232. It is an undesired intermediate product in thorium-based nuclear reactors and is therefore removed from the active zone of the reactor during the breeding process. Analysis of the relative concentrations of various uranium, thorium and protactinium isotopes in water and minerals is used in radiometric dating of sediments which are up to 175,000 years old and in modeling of various <b>geological</b> <b>processes.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1796, Georges Cuvier {{published}} his {{findings on the}} differences between living elephants and {{those found in the}} fossil record. His analysis identified mammoths and mastodons as distinct species, different from any living animal, and effectively ended a long-running debate over whether a species could become extinct. In 1788, James Hutton described gradual <b>geological</b> <b>processes</b> operating continuously over deep time. In the 1790s, William Smith began the process of ordering rock strata by examining fossils in the layers while he worked on his geologic map of England. Independently, in 1811, Cuvier and Alexandre Brongniart published an influential study of the geologic history of the region around Paris, based on the stratigraphic succession of rock layers. These works helped establish the antiquity of the Earth. Cuvier advocated catastrophism to explain the patterns of extinction and faunal succession revealed by the fossil record.|$|E
5|$|The slight {{eccentricity}} of Europa's orbit, {{maintained by}} the gravitational disturbances from the other Galileans, causes Europa's sub-Jovian point to oscillate around a mean position. As Europa comes slightly nearer to Jupiter, Jupiter's gravitational attraction increases, causing Europa to elongate {{towards and away from}} it. As Europa moves slightly away from Jupiter, Jupiter's gravitational force decreases, causing Europa to relax back into a more spherical shape, and creating tides in its ocean. The orbital eccentricity of Europa is continuously pumped by its mean-motion resonance with Io. Thus, the tidal flexing kneads Europa's interior and gives it a source of heat, possibly allowing its ocean to stay liquid while driving subsurface <b>geological</b> <b>processes.</b> The ultimate source of this energy is Jupiter's rotation, which is tapped by Io through the tides it raises on Jupiter and is transferred to Europa and Ganymede by the orbital resonance.|$|E

50|$|Deposition is the <b>geological</b> <b>process</b> {{in which}} sediments, soil and rocks {{are added to}} a landform or land mass.

5|$|The energy {{provided}} by tidal flexing drives active <b>geological</b> <b>processes</b> within Europa's interior, {{just as they}} do to a far more obvious degree on its sister moon Io. Although Europa, like the Earth, may possess an internal energy source from radioactive decay, the energy generated by tidal flexing would be several orders of magnitude greater than any radiological source. Life on Europa could exist clustered around hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor, or below the ocean floor, where endoliths are known to inhabit on Earth. Alternatively, it could exist clinging to the lower surface of Europa's ice layer, much like algae and bacteria in Earth's polar regions, or float freely in Europa's ocean. If Europa's ocean is too cold, biological processes similar to those known on Earth could not take place. If it is too salty, only extreme halophiles could survive in that environment. In 2010, a model proposed by Richard Greenberg of the University of Arizona proposed that irradiation of ice on Europa's surface could saturate its crust with oxygen and peroxide, which could then be transported via tectonic processes into the interior ocean. Such a process could render Europa's ocean as oxygenated as our own within just 12 million years, allowing for the existence of complex, multicellular lifeforms.|$|E

In contrast, catastrophism is the theory that Earth's features formed in single, catastrophic events and remained unchanged thereafter.
