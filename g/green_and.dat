40|$|This article {{proposed}} four novel constructs green brand image, green satisfaction, <b>green</b> trust, <b>and</b> <b>green</b> brand equity, <b>and</b> {{explored the}} positive relationships between <b>green</b> brand equity <b>and</b> its three drivers green brand image, <b>green</b> satisfaction, <b>and</b> <b>green</b> trust. This research employed an empirical study {{by use of}} the questionnaire survey method. The questionnaires were randomly mailed to consumers who {{had the experience of}} purchasing information and Toyotavvti products. The results showed that green brand image, <b>green</b> satisfaction, <b>and</b> <b>green</b> trust are positively related to green brand equity. Furthermore, the positive relationship between <b>green</b> brand image <b>and</b> <b>green</b> brand equity is partially mediated by <b>green</b> satisfaction <b>and</b> <b>green</b> trust. Hence, investing on resources to increase green brand image, <b>green</b> satisfaction, <b>and</b> <b>green</b> trust is helpful to enhance green brand equity...|$|R

40|$|No prior {{literature}} {{explores the}} influence of green transformational leadership on green performance, thus, this study develops a novel research framework to fill the research gap. This study investigates {{the influence of}} green transformational leadership on <b>green</b> performance <b>and</b> discusses the mediation effects of <b>green</b> mindfulness <b>and</b> <b>green</b> self-efficacy by means of structural equation modeling (SEM). The results indicate that green transformational leadership positively influences green mindfulness, <b>green</b> self-efficacy, <b>and</b> <b>green</b> performance. Moreover, this study demonstrates that the positive relationship between <b>green</b> transformational leadership <b>and</b> <b>green</b> performance is partially mediated by the two mediators: <b>green</b> mindfulness <b>and</b> <b>green</b> self-efficacy. It means that green transformational leadership can not only directly affect green performance positively but also indirectly affect it positively through <b>green</b> mindfulness <b>and</b> <b>green</b> self-efficacy. Therefore, firms need to raise their green transformational leadership, <b>green</b> mindfulness, <b>and</b> <b>green</b> self-efficacy to increase their green performance...|$|R

Findings reveal that enhancing green consumption through green marketing depends on consumers' enthusiasm to engage in <b>green</b> practices <b>and</b> <b>green</b> behavioural influences. The research supports the need for qualitative research to provide rich insights into relationships between consumer behaviour, <b>green</b> marketing <b>and</b> <b>green</b> consumption <b>and</b> builds a stronger knowledge foundation by introducing social practice theory into the marketing discipline...|$|R

5|$|As {{a member}} of the tree frog family, the <b>green</b> <b>and</b> golden bell frog spends much time basking in the sun on vegetation, rocks, and reeds, usually near water, or hopping around between such places. Unlike most frog species, it is often active during the day. When handled, this species secretes a slimy acrid mucus, which {{consists}} of 17 aurein peptides. Thirteen of these show broad-spectrum antibiotic and anticancer activity. The secretion makes the frog slippery and hard to grip, and is poisonous to some other species of frogs, so it is a useful defensive tool for <b>green</b> <b>and</b> golden bell frogs. Males often fight one another if they come within 1 m of each other, frequently leading to injuries.|$|E
