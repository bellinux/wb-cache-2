2500|$|The {{degree to}} which {{adolescents}} are perceived as autonomous beings varies widely by culture, as do the behaviors that represent this emerging autonomy. Psychologists have identified three main types of autonomy: emotional independence, behavioral autonomy, and cognitive autonomy. [...] Emotional autonomy is {{defined in terms of}} an adolescent's relationships with others, and often includes the development of more mature emotional connections with adults and peers. [...] Behavioral autonomy encompasses an adolescent's developing ability to regulate his or her own behavior, to act on personal decisions, and to self-govern. Cultural differences are especially visible in this category because it concerns issues of dating, social time with peers, and time-management decisions. [...] Cognitive autonomy <b>describes</b> <b>the</b> <b>capacity</b> <b>for</b> an adolescent to partake in processes of independent reasoning and decision-making without excessive reliance on social validation. [...] Converging influences from adolescent cognitive development, expanding social relationships, an increasingly adultlike appearance, and the acceptance of more rights and responsibilities enhance feelings of autonomy for adolescents. [...] Proper development of autonomy has been tied to good mental health, high self-esteem, self-motivated tendencies, positive self-concepts, and self-initiating and regulating behaviors. [...] Furthermore, it has been found that adolescents' mental health is best when their feelings about autonomy match closely with those of their parents.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: With the {{development}} of new structural materials including FRP (fiber reinforced polymer), glass, stainless steel, the performance of structures have a great change from the steel and the steel reinforced concrete structures. The conventional ductility index that <b>describes</b> <b>the</b> inelastic deformation <b>capacity</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> traditional materials cannot longer suit the structures with new materials. A new term, "deformability", has been proposed to extend the concept of the ductility. In this paper, more than ten existing definitions of performance indices for the flexural members are reviewed. A new concept that is design-aimed state is defined relative to ultimate failure state after carrying out analysis based on the comparison in term of concepts and methodologies of the reviewed indices. A new approach to achieve the uniform performance indices and to determine the design-aimed state is proposed also. A set of uniform performance indices, including the deformability index D, the strength index S, the deformation energy index Y and the overall performance index F are presented. The moment-curvature curve of five type of flexural members, including steel beam, steel-reinforced concrete beam, prestressed concrete beam, FRP bars reinforced concrete beam and all-FRP beam, are analyzed using the suggested indices.

A combination of thermogravimetric experiments and breakthrough experiments {{have been carried out}} to elucidate the effect of steam on the CO 2 cyclic sorption capacity on a K-promoted hydrotalcite-based adsorbent. Different TGA cycles have been designed to study the mass change on sorbents exposed to different sequences of different CO 2 /H 2 O/N 2 mixtures. Because the complex sorption/desorption and replacement phenomena cannot be explained by TGA experiments only, additional information from breakthrough experiments in a packed bed reactor was used to correlate the observed total mass change in the TGA cycles to the phenomena prevailing on the sorbent. 3 ̆cbr/ 3 ̆e 3 ̆cbr/ 3 ̆eA mechanism has been developed which is able to <b>describe</b> <b>the</b> cyclic working <b>capacity,</b> <b>for</b> both CO 2 and H 2 O under different experimental conditions.

40|$|This study {{explored}} {{how women}} living in remote areas of north-west Queensland, Australia, achieve health and wellbeing. The challenges that people living in rural and remote areas face in accessing services and achieving health contribute to poorer health outcomes compared to people living elsewhere in Australia. These challenges can be exacerbated by exposure to climatic extremes, the adverse effects of economic restructuring and distance from population and service centres. The negative impact on health is most pronounced in remote areas. There is evidence from national surveys of women that, despite the challenges, {{women living in}} remote areas consider themselves to be healthy and have equivalent or even better mental health than urban women. Speculation as to {{why this is so}} has focused on the characteristics of the women themselves and the nature of rural and remote communities. There is very little empirical research aimed at developing a deeper understanding of how rural and remote women achieve health. The study addresses this gap by exploring the meaning of health and wellbeing and the conditions which create it from the perspective of women living in remote north-west Queensland. The Australian National Women‘s Health Policy 2010 is {{based on the premise that}} women's health can only be understood within the broader context in which women live and work. The research demonstrates an approach to operationalising this approach to women‘s health by studying remote women in their social and geographical context. This was a woman-centred, grounded theory study based on a constructivist epistemology and a critical ecological theoretical lens. The thesis begins with my positioning as a health practitioner with a disciplinary background in social work and a practice in health promotion in remote north-west Queensland. The research process proceeded through three phases. In phase one, a synthesis of a sample of six qualitative studies related to remote women's health using meta-ethnographic methods was conducted instead of a conventional literature review. The studies selected for synthesis were analysed using reciprocal translation methods consistent with a grounded theory approach. This phase identified sensitising concepts: belonging, isolation, coping with adversity and rural identity, which were utilised for analysing the data gathered in phase two of the study and for discussing the emergent theory in relation to the literature in phase three. In the thesis, a detailed account of the methodological decision-making that led to the selection of the methodology for the study is presented. Phase two of the study involved field work in locations geographically classified as remote. A combination of quota sampling, convenience sampling and theoretical sampling was used to recruit women to the study. In-depth interviews were conducted with twenty-three women over a twelve month period. Data was analysed using rigorous, systematic grounded theory methods. Phase three involved theorising and authenticating the emergent theory with reference to women's narratives and the health and social science literature. The study findings are presented as a grounded theory of <b>the</b> <b>capacity</b> <b>for</b> flourishing. Flourishing <b>describes</b> an optimum achievable state of health and wellbeing as that is defined by each woman. The theory delineates a dynamic, multidimensional, integrated and contextualised process of adjustment and change arising from the interaction between women and their environment. The process integrates two axes: a being and doing axis and a person and environment axis, and four dimensions of flourishing: control, connecting, belonging and identity. Individual, contextual and structural factors which enable and constrain flourishing are <b>described.</b> <b>The</b> <b>capacity</b> <b>for</b> flourishing is embedded in these factors. The grounded theory is positioned in relation to Australian and international literature relating to rural and remote women's health and wellbeing. The study contributes to the literature by proposing a theory of how women achieve health and wellbeing that is relational and created through the interaction between women and their environment. The study extends the literature by conceptualising holistic health as flourishing. The study affirms the relevance of a sense of belonging to remote women's health and wellbeing. The study extends the literature in relation to the importance of connectedness to health by delineating a process for making connections. The study findings challenge current discourses in relation to rural women's identity. They also highlight the lack of attention to the concept of control in the rural and remote women's health literature. The findings suggest the need to move towards more holistic, contextual and health promoting approaches to understanding and supporting remote women's health and wellbeing. Future research utilising the concepts of flourishing and place in different remote geographical contexts is recommended...|$|R

Advances in DNA sequencing can now provide a comprehensive view of benthic invertebrate diversity. The authors applied 454 pyrosequencing to examine the responses of benthic communities in microcosms exposed to sediments with elevated concentrations of triclosan, the endpoint being eukaryl communities that have successfully vertically migrated through the manipulated sediments. The biological communities associated with the 3 treatments (control triclosan, low triclosan [14 mg/kg], and high triclosan [180 mg/kg]) clustered into 3 groups: control/low (n= 6 controls and 4 low), moderate (n= 2 low), and high (n= 5 high). One sample was discarded as an outlier. The most pronounced change as a response to triclosan was the loss of number of metazoan operational taxonomic units (OTUs), indicative of the control/low and moderate groups, with this being most evident in the range of taxa associated with the classes Chromadorea and Bivalvia and the phylum Kinorhyncha. <b>The</b> authors also <b>describe</b> a range of other taxa that aided discrimination between the groups; compare findings with traditionally obtained meio- and macrofaunal communities obtained from the same experiment; and illustrate some of the advantages and limitations associated with both the molecular and traditional approaches. <b>The</b> <b>described</b> approach illustrates <b>the</b> <b>capacity</b> <b>for</b> amplicon sequencing to provide ecologically relevant information {{that can be used to}} strengthen an understanding of how sedimentary communities respond to a range of environmental stressors. 11 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Originally {{published}} in 1970 this title commemorates {{the men and}} ideas that started, inspired and established a pioneer institution in British psychiatry. Based on the impetus of Freudian and related innovations after the First World War, the Tavistock Clinic offered treatment, training and research facilities {{in the field of}} neurosis, child guidance and later on group relations. Dr Dicks, who had been associated for nearly forty years with the work and personalities that helped to develop <b>the</b> Tavistock venture, <b>describes</b> <b>the</b> struggles and <b>capacity</b> <b>for</b> survival of <b>the</b> clinic. He shows how, belonging neither to the older classical psychiatry nor to orthodox psychoanalysis, and suspect to both, the Clinic nevertheless became increasingly used {{by the rest of the}} profession as a psychotherapeutic resource. Dr Dicks <b>describes</b> <b>the</b> influence of the Tavistock on the medical, psychological and social work scene both before and after the Second World War, and assesses its achievements as a centre of psycho- and socio-dynamic thinking. The Tavistock is shown as a pioneer sui generis, launching psychosomatic research and initiating the exciting ventures in social psychiatry associated with the Army in the Second World War. As the Tavistock was the outcome of work with shell-shock victims in the first war, so its offspring, the Institute of Human Relations, was the natural continuation of the military effort in man-management, morale and group dynamic studies.

40|$|Replacement of a {{considerable}} {{part of the}} traditional, aqueous reaction medium in biotechnology by an organic medium is a promising technique to broaden the scope and range of biotechnological processes. This seems especially to be true for the conversion of non-polar substances. <b>The</b> high <b>capacity</b> of solvents <b>for</b> sparingly water-soluble substrates and products could reduce the required volume of the reaction mixture significantly, and may also lead to less substrate and/or product inhibition in the aqueous biocatalyst phase, when these mechanisms are involved. Furthermore, {{the use of an}} organic solvent could shift reaction equilibria favourably and facilitate down-stream processing. In chapter 1 a general review is presented of non-aqueous solvent systems in biocatalytic processes. Special attention is paid to two-liquid-phase systems, involving water-immiscible solvents. Several facets of these biphasic systems have been studied in this thesis using the epoxidation of propene by gel-entrapped Mycobacterium cells as a model. After the description of the throughout this work employed techniques of gas-analysis automatization and of substrate-level control (chapter 2), the far-reaching consequences of the solvent choice are treated in chapter 3. Many solvents cause rapid inactivation of the free, propene-epoxidizing cells. This appears also to be the case if the cells are immobilized in calcium alginate. However, the support material prevents direct cell-organic solvent contact and the associated aggregation and clotting of cells, mostly accompanied with loss of activity. High activity retentions of the immobilized cells relate to low polarities and high molecular weights of the used solvents. The polarity, as expressed by the Hildebrand solubility parameter, is also useful <b>for</b> <b>describing</b> <b>the</b> solvent <b>capacity</b> <b>for</b> one of <b>the</b> two substrates, oxygen, and for the product, propene oxide. <b>The</b> <b>capacity</b> <b>for</b> propene is less well <b>described</b> by <b>the</b> Hildebrand solubility parameter, but also less relevant, as <b>the</b> <b>capacity</b> of <b>the</b> solvents <b>for</b> propene is always about two orders of magnitude higher than that of water, and thus limitation of the rate by unsufficient supply of propene is less likely to occur. It is stressed that optimization of the solvent polarity is necessary, as the requirement of a high activity retention conflicts with the need for a high solvent <b>capacity</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> polar propene oxide. Optimization of the polarity will also be likely in case of other types of two-liquid-phase bioconversions. External and internal-diffusion limitations, which are to be expected when using cells entrapped in a hydrophilic: gel, are quantified in chapters 4 and 5. With negligible product inhibition, satisfactory predictions of the mass-transfer effects on the intrinsic Michaelis-Menten kinetics of the immobilized cells are obtained by using a simple pore-diffusion model (chapter 4). Internal diffusion is found to severely limit the epoxidation rate. A more complex model for the intrinsic epoxidation kinetics has been derived for modelling of mass-transfer rates in case of product inhibition (chapter 5). The microkinetic model defined in chapter 4 is integrated in a macrokinetic model to <b>describe</b> <b>the</b> behaviour of a packed-bed immobilized-cell reactor (chapter 6). Depletion of the limiting substrate, oxygen, {{along the length of the}} bioreactor can be prevented by using an organic solvent, n-hexadecane, as the transport medium. It is argued that this finding may eliminate the need for a separate gas phase in the fixed-bed reactor. Model predictions of the oxygen conversion in the bioreactor at various degrees of external and internal-diffusion limitation, at various liquid space times and with water or n-hexadecane as the continuous phase are in good agreement with experimentally obtained values. In chapter 7 some other, main limitations of the epoxide production in the packed-bed organic-liquid-phase/immobilized-cell reactor are quantified. Product inhibition is reduced by absorption of the inhibitory epoxide in a cold di-n-octyl phthalate phase. The stability of the immobilized cells is increased by supplying the cells alternately with propene and a co-substrate (ethene). About 50 g dry weight of cells in a 1. 7 dm 3 packed-bed reactor were used, which produced ~ 1. 5 g chiral propene oxide; two third of the epoxide was absorbed in the octyl phthalate phase. Finally, in the last chapter of this thesis a general discussion is presented. The significance of optimization of the solvent polarity and of the interphase polarity, i. e. the polarity of the phase between biocatalyst and organic solvent is underlined. In case of entrapment in prepolymers, the hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity balance of the gel can be optimized with respect to polarities of substrates and products. Several features of hydrophilic and hydrophobic gels are compared. A quantitative illustration is given concerning the design on a technical scale of a fixed-bed organic-liquid-phase/immobilized-cell reactor. The advantages of using solvents with a high substrate capacity (often oxygen in case of aerobic processes) are demonstrated...|$|R
