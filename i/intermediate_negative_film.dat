5000|$|In still photography, Kodak's Kodacolor brand {{has been}} {{associated}} with various color <b>negative</b> <b>films</b> (i.e., <b>films</b> that produce <b>negatives</b> for making color prints on paper) since 1942. Kodak claims that Kodacolor was [...] "the world's first true color negative film". More accurately, it was the first color <b>negative</b> <b>film</b> intended for making paper prints: in 1939, Agfa had introduced a 35 mm Agfacolor <b>negative</b> <b>film</b> for use by the German motion picture industry, in which the negative was used only for making positive projection prints on 35 mm film. There have been several varieties of Kodacolor <b>negative</b> <b>film,</b> including Kodacolor-X, Kodacolor VR and Kodacolor Gold.|$|R

40|$|Affective {{films are}} often used in emotion {{research}} and <b>negative</b> <b>films</b> are frequently used as an analogue for trauma (trauma film paradigm). However, different films are used with possibly distinct consequences. We aimed to investigate specific effects of four <b>negative</b> <b>films</b> covering distinct themes (physical, sexual, traffic and food), and tested neutral and positive films with matching content. Self-reported emotional responses and heart rate during the films were examined (immediate responses) as well as intrusions of the films in the subsequent week (delayed responses). Within each theme, <b>negative</b> <b>films</b> were rated as more unpleasant than the positive and neutral counterparts. They also evoked more negative emotions and more intrusive memories. Across themes, the four <b>negative</b> <b>films</b> {{did not differ in}} terms of valence and arousal, but clearly differed on immediate (e. g., disgust, embarrassment, heart rate) and delayed (intrusions) effects. Thus, we urge researchers to carefully select <b>negative</b> <b>films</b> for their studies, as different films seem to evoke distinct emotional responses. In addition, using positive films within the same themes is recommended in order to control for effects of arousal. In general, the specific film material should be considered when comparing effects across studies...|$|R

50|$|However, {{in a movie}} camera, it is {{done through}} a process by which a shutter opens exposing the <b>film</b> <b>negative</b> to light {{for a split second}} (the {{standard}} for regular motion in North America is 1/48 of a second, which corresponds to 180 degrees, but shutters with 200 degrees were popular back when the then-available color <b>negative</b> <b>film</b> had an ASA of 50; today's color <b>negative</b> <b>film</b> is available with an ASA of 500), then the shutter closes blocking light from reaching the negative. Once the shutter is completely closed, a claw pulls down the next frame of <b>negative</b> <b>film</b> by the sprocket holes into the film gate and the process begins again. A movie projector works in a similar way.|$|R
