30|$|It {{has been}} {{known for a long time}} that the <b>electrical</b> <b>compartment</b> of hair cells from various lower {{vertebrate}} species, e.g., birds, lizards, and frogs, exhibits damped oscillations in response to step current injections. This electrical resonance has been suggested as a contributing factor to frequency tuning in some inner ear organs [10 – 13]. Besides these passive oscillations, recent experimental studies in isolated [14, 15] and non-isolated [16] saccular hair cells have documented spontaneous self-sustained voltage oscillations associated with Ca 2 + and K+ currents. In particular, various regimes of spontaneous rhythmical activity were observed, including small-amplitude oscillations, large-amplitude spikes as well as bursting behavior [16].|$|E

An assessment of the masses of a conventional and a remotely controlled system, based on a VC 10 installation {{in which it is}} assumed that the latest lightweight cables and switchgear are used indicates that the remotely controlled system would be about 90 kg lighter. Additional saving might result from equipment specifically designed to be compatible with solid state remote control techniques. The effect on both systems of resiting the <b>electrical</b> <b>compartment</b> from the forward to a mid-aircraft position has been examined and it is concluded that a further saving of 36 kg would result with remote control. The redesigned system lends itself to, and has been arranged for, easy conversion to multiplexed data transmission.

40|$|Spines are {{neuronal}} protrusions, each {{of which}} receives input typically from one excitatory synapse. They contain neurotransmitter receptors, organelles, and signaling systems essential for synaptic function and plasticity. Numerous brain disorders are associated with abnormal dendritic spines. Spine formation, plasticity, and maintenance depend on synaptic activity and can be modulated by sensory experience. Studies of compartmentalization have shown that spines serve primarily as biochemical, rather than <b>electrical,</b> <b>compartments.</b> In particular, recent work has highlighted that spines are highly specialized compartments for rapid large-amplitude Ca(2 +) signals underlying the induction of synaptic plasticity...|$|R

40|$|Excitatory synapses in the {{mammalian}} brain {{are made}} on small protrusions of the postsynaptic cell called dendritic spines. Dendritic spines are highly variable in their morphology and in their microanatomy (e. g. presence of subsynaptic organelles). It is unclear whether and how variability in spine morphological and anatomical properties translates into differences in synaptic function. Using two photon imaging, we analyzed how spine properties can affect synaptic signals {{and the potential for}} synaptic plasticity at single identified spine synapses. We show that synaptic signals can be tightly regulated on the level of individual synapses and that differences in spine morphology and microanatomy regulate synaptic function. We also provide evidence for the existence of functionally distinct populations of synapses in regard to their potential for synaptic plasticity. The present thesis is subdivided into three main sections. The first section is dedicated to the analysis of the function of specialized subsynaptic organelles in regulating synaptic plasticity. In the second section we studied the impact of spine morphology on synaptic signals and in the third section we examined whether critical proteins can be tagged to individual synapses in response to plasticity inducing stimuli. In pyramidal cells, only a subset of dendritic spines contains endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Spine ER often forms a ‘spine apparatus’, a specialized organelle with unknown function. It is unclear whether these specialized subsynaptic structures can affect the function of the synapse on the spine head. The possible involvement of spine ER in shaping spine calcium transients, a key trigger for synaptic plasticity, raises the possibility that spine ER could modulate the potential of a given synapse to undergo activity dependent modifications. Using a genetic approach to label the ER in living neurons, we find that the ER preferentially localizes to spines containing strong synapses. We demonstrate that spine ER represents a specialized calcium signaling machinery required for the induction of metabotropic glutamate receptor dependent long term depression at individual synapses. We demonstrate that different subsets of synapses exist in regard to their potential to undergo specific forms of plasticity. Spine ER represents the anatomical correlate for a mechanism by which strong synapses can be retuned in an activity dependent manner. Dendritic spines are separated from their parent dendrite by a thin spine neck. The spine neck slows down diffusion of molecules from the spine head to the parent dendrite, allowing spine-specific action of second messengers and activated enzymes. The resistance of the spine neck is crucial in determining whether spines can also be considered <b>electrical</b> <b>compartments.</b> Only a high enough spine neck resistance leads to electrical compartmentalization and activation of voltage gated channels in the spine in response to synaptic stimulation. We show that spine neck resistance can change in an activity dependent manner. Using single spine calcium imaging as a reporter of NMDA receptor activation and spine head depolarization, we show that spines can indeed act as <b>electrical</b> <b>compartments.</b> Using pharmacological experiments and modeling, we demonstrate that different voltage dependent channels cooperatively participate in shaping spine head depolarization and spine calcium transients. We also show that in vivo the spine neck resistance is higher compared to the situation in acutely sliced brain tissue, demonstrating that in the living animal a higher fraction of spines can be considered <b>electrical</b> <b>compartments</b> compared to the in vitro situation. We provide strong evidence that the spine neck can profoundly affect synaptic calcium signals. Biochemical and electrical compartmentalization is dynamically regulated in an activity dependent way. Spine calcium signals can activate key signaling cascades responsible for the induction of synaptic plasticity. Long term potentiation (LTP) has been shown to require the activity of CaMKII, a serine/ threonine kinase. A chemical protocol leading to LTP has been shown to induce translocation of CaMKII to dendritic spines. It is however unclear whether this molecule acts at single synapses or whether it can spread and modulate neighboring synapses in response to more physiological protocols. Using a new optical approach to induce LTP at single visualized synapses, we show that LTP induction is accompanied by a long-lasting increase of CaMKII at the stimulated synapse. This increase was specific to the stimulated spine and did not spread to neighboring spines. We provide evidence that CaMKII acts locally, on the micrometer scale, to regulate plasticity. We show that the concentration of proteins involved in regulating synaptic plasticity can be tightly regulated at the level of single synapses...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} an electrical {{description of the}} generation of slow waves in the guinea-pig gastric antrum. A short segment of a circular smooth muscle bundle with an attached network of myenteric interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC-MY) and longitudinal muscle sheet was modelled as three <b>electrical</b> <b>compartments</b> with resistive connexions between the ICC-MY compartment {{and each of the}} smooth muscle compartments. The circular smooth muscle layer contains a proportion of intramuscular interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC-IM), responsible for the regenerative component of the slow wave. Hence the equivalent cell representing the circular muscle layer incorporated a mechanism, modelled as a two stage reaction, which produces an intracellular messenger. The first stage of the reaction is proposed to be activated in a voltage-dependent manner as described by Hodgkin and Huxley. A similar mechanism was incorporated into the equivalent cell describing the ICC-MY network. Spontaneous discrete transient depolarizations, termed unitary potentials, are detected in records taken from either bundles of circular smooth muscle containing ICC-IM or from ICC-MY. In the simulation the mean rate of discharge of unitary potentials was allowed to vary with the concentration of messenger according to a conventional dose–effect relationship. Such a mechanism, which describes regenerative potentials generated by the circular muscle layer, also simulated the plateau component of the pacemaker potential in the ICC-MY network. A voltage-sensitive membrane conductance was included in the ICC-MY compartment; this was used to describe the primary component of the pacemaker potential. The model generates a range of membrane potential changes with properties similar to those generated by the three cell types present in the intact tissue...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} fuel {{consumption}} of passenger vehicles has received increased attention by customers, the automotive industry, regulatory agencies and academia. One area which affect the fuel consumption is climate control systems. Twenty-one {{energy saving measures}} were evaluated regarding the total energy use for vehicle interior climate using simulation. Evaluated properties were heat flow into the passenger <b>compartment,</b> <b>electrical</b> and mechanical work. The simulation model included sub models of the passenger compartment, air handling unit, Air Conditioning (AC) system, engine and engine cooling system. A real-world representative test cycle, which included tests in cold, intermediate and warm conditions, was used for evaluation. In general, few single energy saving measures could reduce the energy use significantly. The measures with most potential were increased blower efficiency with a reduction of 46 % of the electrical work and increased AC-system disengage temperature with a reduction of 27 % of the mechanical work. These {{results show that the}} operation of the climate control system had a large effect on the energy use, especially compared to the required heating and cooling of the passenger compartment. As a result energy saving measures need to address how heating and cooling is generated before reducing the heat flow into the passenger compartment...|$|R
