The standard mandatory conscription is modified. Generally this means fewer conscripts, less service time for them and only those who choose so, will continue into the reaction <b>force</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
25|$|Considering the biomechanical <b>force</b> <b>system</b> {{generated}} by a cantilever, {{it is important to}} remember that a combination of a moment and a force is produced at the unit into which the cantilever is inserted, whereas only a single force is developed with respect to the point of force application of the other end. The magnitude of the two forces is equal and opposite, according to the third law of Newton, and the activation can be measured by a dynamometer.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} {{characteristic of}} the force systems generated by the cantilever, is their high degree of constancy over time and deactivation. In other words, the forces at its two ends, maintain their direction and decrease in a linear manner, proportionally to the cantilever deactivation. In addition, {{there is also a}} high degree of constancy of the MOMENT/FORCE ratio (with respect to the bracket). This means also a homogeneous dental movement. The <b>force</b> <b>system</b> being always directed towards the treatment goal, this is rapidly achievable, with a minimum of round tripping and iatrogenic damage.|$|E

We give some characterizations under which the <b>forced</b> <b>system</b> is time-reversible, and derive an estimate of the electrical current generated by the <b>forced</b> <b>system.</b> Moreover, applying Pesin entropy formula and Young dimension formula, we get several characterizations of the non-equilibrium steady state of the <b>forced</b> <b>system.</b> Comment: 19 page...|$|R

500|$|Post-war {{demobilisation}} {{had seen}} the disbandment of all the RAAF's operational training units, and conversion of new pilots to combat aircraft became the responsibility of front-line squadrons. This practice disrupted the squadrons' normal duties, {{and the advent of}} the Korean War and the introduction of jets exacerbated shortfalls in operational training. Cresswell recalled that as commanding officer of No.77 Squadron in Korea he had to send several replacement pilots back to Australia: [...] "I don't blame the pilots, but I do blame the Air <b>Force</b> <b>system.</b> We had no operational training units, no operational training system and, as a result, the pilots came to Korea poorly trained and without instrument ratings. They just couldn't operate in the area." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{cantilever}} is, in principle, {{any piece}} of wire, whose end is inserted, on one side, into a bracket or a tube, or included in the acrylic of a removable appliance, [...] while {{the other one is}} tied to another unit, with only a one-point contact. When using the cantilever, the orthodontist can easily estimate the <b>force</b> <b>system</b> [...] on both units, just measuring the length of the appliance and its force by means of a dynamometer -in the direction of its activation- and thereby predict the clinical result ...|$|E
2500|$|The load/deflection ratio {{delivered}} by a cantilever, should -as {{for all the}} active elements of the appliance- be as low as possible, leaving the <b>force</b> <b>system</b> {{with a high degree}} of constancy. This is another reason for generally [...] keeping the cantilevers long. In those cases where the cantilevers, for different reasons are short, the load/deflection rate can be lowered by the addition of one or more , or by using a smaller wire dimension. The latter does, however, also cause a problem, as the play between wire and bracket (tube) may become unacceptable. In this case, a composite cantilever could be advisable.|$|E

2500|$|The Navy {{had also}} been experimenting with a similar concept during this period, but using a {{different}} method to extract the timing. This system, later known as Loran-B, ran into significant problems (as did another Air <b>Force</b> <b>system,</b> Whyn). In 1953 the Navy took over the Cyclan system and began a wide series of studies ranging {{as far away as}} Brazil, demonstrating accuracy to about [...] The system was declared operational in 1957, and operations of LORAN and Cyclan were handed to the US Coast Guard in 1958. At that time, the original LORAN became Loran-A or standard LORAN, and the new system became Loran-C.|$|E
2500|$|A {{factor of}} extreme {{importance}} -when inserting a cantilever and determining its length- is [...] {{the point of}} force application where [...] the single point contact is made. The type of dental displacement which is produced, should be predicted {{on the basis of}} the <b>force</b> <b>system,</b> expressed as M/F ratio with respect to the [...] Center of Resistance (CR), and not to the bracket. A single force, perpendicularly applied to the long axis of the tooth at the bracket, produces both a moment and a force with respect to [...] the CR. If the moment has to be reduced, this can be obtained by displacing the point of force application closer to the CR, e.g. by means of a power arm.|$|E
