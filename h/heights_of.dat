5|$|As Hurricane Felix was looping {{offshore}} {{the eastern}} United States, it produced swells of 26ft (8m) along the Nova Scotia coast on an otherwise sunny day. Beaches were closed. Buoys near the Newfoundland coast recorded wave <b>heights</b> <b>of</b> 49ft (15m), while buoys farther offshore reported wave <b>heights</b> <b>of</b> 82ft (27.5m). The outer rainbands {{of the storm}} dropped light rainfall, peaking at around 3.43mm (87mm) in northern Newfoundland. Offshore Caithness in Scotland, waves from the remnants of Felix submerged an experimental wave power station, damaging it further after previous waves damaged the system.|$|E

5|$|Conventional {{defensive}} weapons {{included the}} anti-aircraft artillery piece. The three main types were the 4.5-inch, 3.7-inch and 3-inch guns. The first two were modern, and effective over 8000 metres (26,000 feet). The last was a First World War weapon effective only to 4,250 metres (14,000 feet). Usually batteries were sited in fours, with a range-finder and predictor which measured the speeds and <b>heights</b> <b>of</b> enemy aircraft while {{taking into account}} the time shell took to reach their intended targets, thus calculating when to detonate the fuse in the shell. As with most artillery weapons firing at aircraft, the higher the shell travelled the less effective it became. A shell fired to 1,500 metres (5,000 feet) would only be half as effective at 3,000 metres (10,000 feet) and a quarter as accurate at 4,500 metres (15,000 feet). The German bombers usually tried to fly around heavy concentrations of anti-aircraft guns, and if forced to fly through them, chose to fly at <b>heights</b> <b>of</b> around 4,500 metres (15,000 feet).|$|E

5|$|Following the {{completion}} of the Arlington Line, which was built several miles to the southwest of Fort Jackson, atop the <b>heights</b> <b>of</b> Arlington, the maintenance of Forts Jackson and Runyon was neglected.
