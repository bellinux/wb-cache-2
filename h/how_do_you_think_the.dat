40|$|Background: We used a {{computational}} method to quantitatively investigate {{the relationship between}} personality and written narratives of life events. Agentic (i. e., self- directedness), communal (i. e., cooperativeness), and spiritual (self-transcendence) traits were of special interest because they represent individual differences in intentional val- ues and goals, in contrast to temperament traits, which describe individual differences in automatic responses to emotional stimuli. We also investigated which pronouns were most common in relation to personality constructs that {{were significantly related to}} the narratives. Methods: Personality was assessed among 79 adolescents at one point in time using the NEO Personality Inventory—Revised (NEO-PI-R) and the temperament and char- acter inventory (TCI). Six months later, adolescents were asked to write down the most positive or the most negative event that had happened to them in the last 3 months. Adolescents were explicitly instructed to answer the following questions within their narratives: What happened? Who were involved? Why do you think it happened? How did you feel when it happened? <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> involved persons felt? The descriptions were quantified using a {{computational method}} in which the latent semantic analysis algorithm generates a semantic representation of the narratives. Results: Only self-directedness, cooperativeness, and self-transcendence were related to the semantic representation of the narratives. Moreover, cooperativeness and self- transcendence were associated with less frequent usage of singular pronouns (e. g., me respectively mine). Conclusions: Agentic, communal, and spiritual traits are involved when adolescents describe positive and negative life experiences. Moreover, high levels of communal and spiritual traits are related to less self-focused narratives.

40|$|This study {{explores the}} {{following}} research problem: given that knowledge influences our behaviour, how do the belief systems of elderly Xhosa elderly people about HIV/Aids influence their behaviour? The goal {{of the study was}} to explore and describe the belief systems of Xhosa-speaking people about HIV/Aids, specifically focusing on elderly people. The goal was also to reach conclusions about how these belief systems influence their knowledge. The objectives were threefold: firstly to conduct interviews with respondents; secondly to do a literature study with the aim of doing a literature control; and, thirdly, to reach conclusions about the belief systems of elderly Xhosa-speaking people. The research employed a qualitative paradigm and a phenomenological qualitative design. The research setting was defined as a township area that is situated in the south-eastern part of Johannesburg or Gauteng area. The researcher chose ten respondents who were all Xhosa-speaking and elderly, and the interviews were conducted individually. Non-probability or judgemental sampling, which is also known as convenience sampling, was used. The interviews were audio taped and transcribed verbatim, and field notes were also used as another method of collecting data. The data was analysed according to the eight steps of Tesch (1990) in Cresswell (1995 : 155). The process of data verification was done according to Guba’s Model of Trustworthiness (in Krefting, 1991 : 215 - 222). The actions taken to ensure trustworthiness included prolonged and varied engagement, triangulation, peer examination of research methodology, interviewing techniques and skills such as probing, clarifying, reframing and establishing the researcher’s authority. Seven themes and eleven categories with their sub-categories were drawn from the data obtained during the interviews. The first theme was: how do people contract the HIV/Aids virus? Under this theme, there were eight categories: contraceptives, cancer, sexual intercourse, witchcraft, sexually transmitted disease, blood transmission, sores and respect for cultural norms. The second theme was prevention and treatment, which included the following categories: condoms, one partner and trust, traditional herbs, medicine and prayer. Theme three was: how did HIV/Aids develop? Theme four was: how can people avoid getting HIV/Aids? Theme five was: who gets HIV/Aids? Theme six was: who brought HIV/Aids? Theme seven was: do you know anyone who has HIV/Aids and <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> person was infected? Specific conclusions were drawn based on these findings. Firstly, it was concluded that people contract the virus in many ways, as mentioned above – such as through unsafe sexual intercourse (see paragraph 2 above). Secondly, people like immigrants and drug injectors are more susceptible to spreading the Aids virus. Thirdly, the issue of cultural dominance also increases the spreading of the virus due to the failure to practise safe sex. Fourthly, people lack knowledge about the virus. Fifthly, HIV/Aids cannot be cured by medicine, traditional means or even the church. Instead, it can be treated by using drugs, such as neviropine, zidovidine and other medicines which can stop the virus from multiplying its cells in the person’s system. However, further research is needed before we draw conclusions, especially on the issue of cultural beliefs towards the virus. The conclusions were complemented by specific recommendations. Dr. E.

40|$|Supporting good traditions Cue: In {{many rural}} areas, forests and forest {{resources}} {{are protected by}} long-standing community traditions, which govern the times when people can harvest wood from the forest, and what types of tree {{can be used for}} which purposes. However these traditional arrangements are being increasingly threatened and when they fail, national or regional laws are often too weak to protect the forest. Our next report comes from Victoria Falls in Zimbabwe, an area where many trees are being cut to provide wood for the curio carving business. An NGO, Environment Africa has been working with local communities in the area, helping them to reach agreements on how to best use and protect their forest resources. Busani Bafana asked Namo Chuma about the management systems the communities had set up, and what effect a new Environmental Management Bill might have for natural resources management in Zimbabwe. The Bill, if it is passed, will hand over much more management responsibility and power to local people. Busani began by asking whether local communities really understood the concept of sustainable forest management. IN:		?The local communities do understand ? OUT:		? and re-green Zimbabwe. ? DUR?N	 4 ? 48 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Busani Bafana calling on Zimbabweans to restore their lost forests. Transcript Chuma	The local communities do understand the concept of sustainable utilisation of forests, but they understand it from a traditional perspective, from their cultural perspective. Bafana	By ?cultural perspective?, what do you actually mean? Chuma	I mean that the communities have set aside pieces of land or some forest, which are not accessed by members of the community during certain times of the year, like during the rainy season those areas are protected, and members of the communities are not allowed to go in there. They can only use those pieces of forest during the dry season. And also communities know which species of trees to harvest, and when to do it and how to do it. Bafana	Would you say these efforts have yielded any great benefits? Chuma	Yes I would say these efforts have actually yielded a lot of benefits to the communities themselves, particularly with certain species of trees which are protected in our traditional society. There are certain species of trees which we know, and when we grow up we are told you cannot use that piece of wood when you want to make fire, or you cannot use it when you want to build your homestead, and these trees have been protected. Bafana	As far as protecting the forests, which are not only a source of various products, but also a source of livelihood, what local solutions have the communities that you work with come up with? Chuma	Some communities have come together, and they have agreed that, when you want to go and harvest timber or wood in the forest, you are supposed to follow certain procedures. You are supposed to go through the head man, or through the kraal head, and only the kraal head can authorise the amount of wood {{that you are going to}} cut in that particular forest. And also, the head man, together with his community advisors, let communities know when certain forests will be open for them to go and cut wood for both carving and building their homes. Bafana	What problems have you encountered as far as trying to help the local people utilise the principles of sustainable forest management? Chuma	Yes, we have encountered some problems, particularly with people who want to go into commercial ventures using products from the forest in the communal lands. At the end of the day, you discover that the communities are not benefiting from these commercial ventures. It will be one or two people who are benefiting from these commercial ventures, and it becomes very difficult to control these people, because they don?t liase with the kraal heads, they don?t even have permits from the Hwange Rural District Council, which is the local authority in charge of these two wards where we are working. So we have had serious problems with such people. Bafana	<b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> government can support initiatives, such as those being implemented by Environment Africa? Chuma	If you look at legislation at the moment, if you are found cutting down trees the fine that you have to pay is not deterrent enough. You cut down a ?mukwa? tree that took about fifty years to mature, and you are only asked to pay a fine of fifteen dollars. And I also believe that the government should provide the resources to communities, so that communities are empowered to manage the resources in their localities, instead of having extension workers managing forests on behalf of communities. Bafana	What if at all will the impact of the Environmental Management Bill, if it is passed into law, have on sustainable management of forest by local people? Chuma	We welcome the introduction of the Environmental Management Bill. We believe that the moment it becomes law, it is going to empower communities to manage their resources. In one of the sections of the Bill, it is stated that the communities are going to be given appropriate authority status. And the moment the communities get appropriate authority status, which means they have the mandate, they have the power to manage resources in their localities, by so doing we will be empowering the communities and they are going to be associated with those resources, because they have the mandate to manage them. Bafana	And maybe just to round off, last month former South African president, Nelson Mandela, launched an initiative started by Environment Africa called ?Tree Africa?. What bearing does this have on the local efforts to manage forests? Chuma	As Environment Africa we realised that we are losing a lot of trees, and at a very fast rate. So we launched a campaign in March which is called ?Tree Africa?. Our aim is to plant about five million trees in two years. So we are calling on every Zimbabwean to be part of this campaign. Bafana	There you are, the campaign is on! Plant a tree and re-green Zimbabwe! End of track. Namo Chuma, of the NGO Environment Africa, explains how traditional arrangements have protected trees in Zimbabwe, and how a new piece of legislation could empower communities to protect their forests against illegal exploitation by commercial interests...|$|E
