5|$|Dopamine as a {{manufactured}} {{medication is}} sold under the trade names Intropin, Dopastat, and Revimine, among others. It {{is on the}} World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is most commonly used as a stimulant drug {{in the treatment of}} severe low blood pressure, slow heart rate, and cardiac arrest. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> <b>important</b> in treating these in newborn infants. It is given intravenously. Since the half-life of dopamine in plasma is very short—approximately one minute in adults, two minutes in newborn infants and up to five minutes in preterm infants—it is usually given in a continuous intravenous drip rather than a single injection.|$|E
5|$|Even a {{slightly}} dehydrated horse is {{at higher risk}} of developing impaction colic. Additionally, dehydration can lead to weight loss because the horse cannot produce adequate amounts of saliva, thus decreasing the amount of feed and dry forage consumed. Thus, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> <b>important</b> for horse owners to encourage their horses to drink {{when there is a}} risk of dehydration; when horses are losing a great deal of water in hot weather due to strenuous work, or in cold weather due to horses' natural tendency to drink less when in a cold environment. To encourage drinking, owners may add electrolytes to the feed, additives to make the water especially palatable (such as apple juice), or, when it is cold, to warm the water so that it is not at a near-freezing temperature.|$|E

25|$|In computing, exec is a {{functionality}} of {{an operating}} system that runs an executable file {{in the context}} of an already existing process, replacing the previous executable. This act is also referred to as an overlay. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> <b>important</b> in Unix-like systems, although other operating systems implement it as well. Since a new process is not created, the original process identifier (PID) does not change, but the machine code, data, heap, and stack of the process are replaced by those of the new program.|$|E
25|$|Biodiversity {{inventory}} – An interspecific O–A relationship {{implies that}} those species {{that have a}} restricted distribution (and hence will be important for conservation reasons) will also have low abundance within their range. Thus, when <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> <b>important</b> that a species be detected, that species {{may be difficult to}} detect. Gaston et al. note that because of this relationship, the intensiveness of a sampling scheme cannot be traded off for extensiveness. In effect, an intensive survey of a few sites will miss species with restricted distribution occurring at other sites, while an low-intensity extensive survey will miss species with low densities across most sites.|$|E
25|$|In {{spite of}} the {{stability}} brought by the civil code to the Argentine law system, it was subject to various modifications throughout its history, as was necessary to adequately regulate a society undergoing significant social, political and economical changes. The most important reform was Law 17.711 of April 22, 1968. Not only did the law change around 5% of the complete article, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> <b>important</b> due to the change in orientation regarding some regulated institutions. There were also other reform projects that were not implemented. Along with proposals to change institutions and methods, one of them proposed to merge the civil code with the commercial code, following {{the example of the}} Italian code.|$|E

25|$|The {{crucifix}} is {{a principal}} symbol for many groups of Christians, {{and one of the}} most common forms of the Crucifixion in the arts. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> <b>important</b> in the Latin Rite of the Roman Catholic Church, but is also used in the Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, Assyrian, and Eastern Catholic Churches, as well as by many Lutheran and Anglican churches. The symbol is less common in churches of other Protestant denominations, which prefer to use a cross without the figure of Jesus (the corpus). The crucifix emphasizes Jesus' sacrifice — his death by crucifixion, which Christians believe brought about the redemption of mankind. Most crucifixes portray Jesus on a Latin cross, rather than any other shape, such as a Tau cross or a Coptic cross.|$|E
25|$|In {{many parts}} of {{developing}} countries such as Pakistan, Iran and China, unreinforced {{or in some cases}} reinforced masonry is the predominantly form of structures for rural residential and dwelling. Masonry was also a common construction form {{in the early part of}} the 20th century, which implies that a substantial number of these at-risk masonry structures would have significant heritage value. Masonry walls that are not reinforced are especially hazardous. Such structures may be more appropriate for replacement than retrofit, but if the walls are the principal load bearing elements in structures of modest size they may be appropriately reinforced. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> <b>important</b> that floor and ceiling beams be securely attached to the walls. Additional vertical supports in the form of steel or reinforced concrete may be added.|$|E
25|$|In Ecuador the Day of the Dead is {{observed}} {{to some extent}} by all parts of society, though <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> <b>important</b> to the indigenous Kichwa peoples, who make up an estimated quarter of the population. Indigena families gather together in the community cemetery with offerings of food for a day-long remembrance of their ancestors and lost loved ones. Ceremonial foods include colada morada, a spiced fruit porridge that derives its deep purple color from the Andean blackberry and purple maize. This is typically consumed with guagua de pan, a bread shaped like a swaddled infant, though variations include many pigs—the latter being traditional {{to the city of}} Loja. The bread, which is wheat flour-based today, but was made with masa in the pre-Columbian era, can be made savory with cheese inside or sweet with a filling of guava paste. These traditions have permeated mainstream society, as well, where food establishments add both colada morada and gaugua de pan to their menus for the season. Many non-indigenous Ecuadorians visit the graves of the deceased, cleaning and bringing flowers, or preparing the traditional foods, too.|$|E

50|$|Coastal minehunters are {{ships that}} are {{designed}} to find, classify, and destroy moored and bottom mines from vital waterways. Coastal minehunters are generally smaller and with lower sea-keeping and endurance than oceangoing minehunters. They are usually tasked with keeping fixed high-value choke points clear of mines, such as the approaches to military ports and harbours. In a Cold War context <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>especially</b> <b>important</b> to protect those ports used by a nation's ballistic missile submarines.|$|R

When Schimmelmann sought after a trade surplus, he thought <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>especially</b> <b>important</b> for a country like Denmark, where fiat money was {{the only means of}} payment. Through trade, one could avoid a weakening (depreciation) of the currency compared to other countries. Besides, the development of trade would improve domestic wealth and thus also the tax revenue and state finances.|$|R
25|$|Proper {{nutrition}} {{is important}} for health and functioning, including the prevention of infectious diarrhea. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> <b>important</b> to young children {{who do not have}} a fully developed immune system. Zinc deficiency, a condition often found in children in developing countries can, even in mild cases, {{have a significant impact on}} the development and proper functioning of the human immune system. Indeed, this relationship between zinc deficiency and reduced immune functioning corresponds with an increased severity of infectious diarrhea. Children who have lowered levels of zinc have a greater number of instances of diarrhea, severe diarrhea, and diarrhea associated with fever. Similarly, vitamin A deficiency can cause an increase in the severity of diarrheal episodes. However, there is some discrepancy when it comes to the impact of vitamin A deficiency on the rate of disease. While some argue that a relationship does not exist between the rate of disease and vitamin A status, others suggest an increase in the rate associated with deficiency. Given that estimates suggest 127 million preschool children worldwide are vitamin A deficient, this population has the potential for increased risk of disease contraction.|$|E
500|$|The A6 {{motorway}} is {{a significant}} northsouth motorway in Croatia connecting the largest seaport of the country, Rijeka, to its hinterland and {{to the rest of}} the Croatian motorway network via the A1 motorway Bosiljevo2 interchange. The motorway follows a route through the Gorski Kotar region. Part of the road network of Croatia, the motorway is also part of European route E65 NagykanizsaZagrebRijekaZadarSplitDubrovnikPodgorica. The motorway is of major importance to Croatia in terms of development of the economy; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> <b>important</b> for tourism and as a transit transport route. The road serves tourist resorts in Istria and the Kvarner Gulf islands. Because of the link formed between Zagreb and Rijeka, tourism-related traffic originating from the countries neighbouring Croatia to the north flows via this road to the Adriatic coast on the south. The road also serves tourists originating in the northern inland areas of Croatia. The A6 route predominantly follows an eastwest orientation, but the motorway is locally regarded as a northsouth communication. The ultimate importance of the motorway as a transit route shall be achieved upon completion of the proposed expansion of Port of Rijeka and the [...] Rijeka transport node. The expansion is planned to encompass an enhancement of the cargo handling capacity of the Port of Rijeka; improved railroad links; and a new Rijeka bypass motorway linking the A6, via a new interchange, with the present routes of the A7 and A8 motorways. One of the aims of the project is to increase traffic along the A6 route. As of the June 1997 Pan-European Transport Conference in Helsinki, the motorway is a part of the Pan-European corridor Vb.|$|E
