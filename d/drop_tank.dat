5|$|The Mk. VI {{had a brief}} {{overseas}} career. One of {{the early}} units was experimentally fitted to a Hurricane Mk. IIc, and {{this led to a}} production of a single flight of such designs starting in July 1942. These conversions were given such a low priority that they were not complete until the spring of 1943. Some of these aircraft were sent to Calcutta where they claimed a number of Japanese bombers. An experimental fit on Hawker Typhoon iA R7881 was carried out, with the system packed into a standard underwing <b>drop</b> <b>tank.</b> This was available in March 1943 and underwent lengthy trials lasting into 1944, but nothing came of this work.|$|E
5|$|Nine {{days later}} Braham {{returned}} to Denmark. On this occasion a No. 305 Squadron RAF Mosquito was {{borrowed from the}} Polish. On the mission he encountered a He 111 near Esjberg. It was circling a lighthouse at 300 feet. Braham fired a three-second fusillade of fire. The He 111 caught fire and nose-dived into the sea, exploding on impact. A Focke-Wulf Fw 58 trainer followed as his second victory on this mission. Meanwhile, the Germans had tracked the Mosquito by radar. Two Messerschmitt Bf 109s {{appeared on the scene}} soon afterwards. The cloud base was only at 1,000 feet and he effected his escape by hiding in its folds. One of the Bf 109s fired some ineffectual bursts of fire at Braham and he also encountered some light ground fire. He few directly to Group HQ at Benson. He returned the Mosquito the following day. Some days later, Braham returned to 305 to pick up a Mosquito and joined No. 107 Squadron RAF in a raid against Paris even though he had no formal bomber pilot training. Nine days later near Poitiers, Braham was engaged in a ground attack mission. He spotted a Focke-Wulf Fw 190 carrying a <b>drop</b> <b>tank</b> and under-wing rockets at low-level. He fired at 600 yards as the enemy accelerated to escape. His fire slowed the Fw 190; catching up with it, the Fw 190 was hit again and crashed: its wreckage strewn over three fields. The Focke-Wulf was his 27th victory.|$|E

50|$|The {{aircraft}} {{is built}} with an inflight-refueling (IFR) probe {{and is able}} to carry three fuel <b>drop</b> <b>tanks.</b> The redesigned airframe also significantly increased internal fuel capacity in the dorsal spine and LERXs fuel tanks. These give the single-seat aircraft an operational range of 2,000 km with internal fuel, 3,200 km with three fuel <b>drop</b> <b>tanks,</b> and 6,000 km with three <b>drop</b> <b>tanks</b> and inflight refueling.|$|R
50|$|Usually {{the fuel}} in the <b>drop</b> <b>tanks</b> is {{consumed}} first, {{and only when}} all the fuel in the <b>drop</b> <b>tanks</b> has been used, the fuel selector is switched to the airplane's internal tanks.|$|R

25|$|Fw 190 G-2: The G-2 {{was renamed}} from Fw 190 A-5/U8 aircraft, {{similar to the}} G-1; the underwing <b>drop</b> <b>tank</b> racks were {{replaced}} with the much simpler V.Mtt-Schloß fittings, {{to allow for a}} number of underwing configurations.|$|E
25|$|RAF Mustangs (Mk Is, {{which were}} not <b>drop</b> <b>tank</b> capable) made history on October 22, 1942 when they escorted 22 Wellington bombers on a {{daylight}} raid to Germany, thus becoming the first RAF single-seat fighters to fly over the country during World War II.|$|E
50|$|The primary {{disadvantage}} with <b>drop</b> <b>tanks</b> is {{that they}} impose a drag penalty on the aircraft carrying them. External fuel tanks will also increase the moment of inertia, thereby reducing roll rates for air maneuvres. Some of the <b>drop</b> <b>tank's</b> fuel is used to overcome the added drag and weight of the tank itself. Drag in this sense varies with {{the square of the}} aircraft's speed. The use of <b>drop</b> <b>tanks</b> also reduces the number of external hardpoints available for weapons, reduces the weapon-carrying capacity, and increases the aircraft's radar signature.|$|R

The Fw 190 F-3/R1 it had two additional ETC 50 bomb racks under each wing. The F-3 could carry a 66-Imp gal (300 liter) <b>drop</b> <b>tank.</b> A total of 432 Fw 190 F-3s were built.|$|E
25|$|A P-38J {{was used}} in {{experiments}} with an unusual scheme for mid-air refueling, in which the fighter snagged a <b>drop</b> <b>tank</b> trailed on a cable from a bomber. The USAAF managed to make this work, but decided it was not practical. A P-38J was also fitted with experimental retractable snow ski landing gear, but this idea never reached operational service either.|$|E
25|$|Fw 190 A-3/U3 — The A-3/U3 was {{the first}} of the Jabo (Jagdbomber), using an ETC-501 {{centre-line}} bomb rack able to carry up to 500kg (1,100lb) of bombs or, with horizontal stabilising bars, one 300L (80US gal) standard Luftwaffe <b>drop</b> <b>tank.</b> The U3 retained the fuselage-mounted 7.92mm (.312in) MG 17s and the wing-mounted 20mm MG 151 cannon, with the outer MG FF being removed.|$|E
50|$|Even {{after such}} {{experience}} showed {{the necessity for}} <b>drop</b> <b>tanks,</b> inflexible thinkers such as 8th Air Force General Ira C. Eaker had to be transferred out of commanding positions (and replaced with Maj. Gen. Jimmy Doolittle) so that <b>drop</b> <b>tanks</b> and range extension plans could be widely implemented in 1944 for American escort fighters.|$|R

25|$|Fw 190 A-3/U4 — The A-3/U4 was a {{reconnaissance}} {{version with}} two RB 12.5 {{cameras in the}} rear fuselage and a EK 16 gun camera or a Robot II miniature camera in {{the leading edge of}} the port wing root. Armament was similar to the U3, however, and the ETC 501 was usually fitted with the standardized Luftwaffe 300 litre-capacity (80US gal) <b>drop</b> <b>tank.</b>|$|E
25|$|The G-6/U4 variant {{was armed}} with a 30mm (1.18in) MK 108 cannon mounted as a Motorkanone firing through the {{propeller}} hub instead of the 20mm MG 151/20. The G-6 was very often seen during 1943 fitted with assembly sets, used to carry bombs or a <b>drop</b> <b>tank,</b> {{for use as a}} night fighter, or to increase firepower by adding rockets or extra gondola-style, underwing gun pod mount ordnance.|$|E
25|$|The end of 1944 saw the 56th {{become the}} sole {{remaining}} group of P-47 Thunderbolts in the Eighth Air Force, as the 353rd FG converted to Mustangs on 2 October, the 356th FG on 20 November, and the 78th FG on 29 December. Beginning 3 January 1945, the 56th began receiving the P-47M, built {{to be the}} fastest Allied piston-driven fighter. Externally identical to the P-47D bubbletops, the P-47M had an up-powered R-2800-57C engine and also incorporated all the range-extending characteristics previously developed for the P-47, particularly use of a 215-gallon belly <b>drop</b> <b>tank.</b>|$|E

25|$|<b>Drop</b> <b>tanks,</b> {{external}} tanks, wing tanks, pylon tanks or belly {{tanks are}} all terms {{used to describe}} auxiliary externally mounted fuel <b>tanks.</b> <b>Drop</b> <b>tanks</b> are generally expendable and often jettisonable. External tanks are commonplace on modern military aircraft and occasionally found in civilian ones, although the latter {{are less likely to}} be discarded except in the event of emergency.|$|R
50|$|The Imperial Japanese navy design {{specification}} for {{what came to}} be the Japanese Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighter, included endurance with <b>drop</b> <b>tanks</b> of two hours at full power, or six to eight hours at cruising speed. <b>Drop</b> <b>tanks</b> were commonly used with the Zero, even on Combat Air patrol (CAP). The Zero entered service in 1940.|$|R
25|$|Production Phantoms {{incorporated}} {{a number of}} design improvements. These included provisions for a flush-fitting centerline <b>drop</b> <b>tank,</b> an improved gunsight, {{and the addition of}} speed brakes. Production models used Westinghouse J30-WE-20 engines with 1,600lbf (7.1kN) of thrust per engine. The top of the vertical tail had a more square shape than the rounder tail used on the prototypes, and a smaller rudder was used to resolve problems with control surface clearance discovered during test flights. The horizontal tail surfaces were shortened slightly, while the fuselage was stretched by 19in (48cm). The amount of framing in the windshield was reduced to enhance pilot visibility.|$|E
25|$|The G-1, {{produced}} from February 1942, {{was the first}} production version of the G-series and the first production Bf 109 with a pressurized cockpit. It could be identified by the small, horn-shaped air intake for the cockpit compressor just above the supercharger intake, on the left upper cowling. In addition, the angled armour plate for the pilot's head {{was replaced by a}} vertical piece which sealed-off the rear of the side-hinged cockpit canopy. Small, triangular armour-glass panels were fitted into the upper corners of this armour, although there were aircraft in which the plate was solid steel. Silica gel capsules were placed in each pane of the windscreen and opening canopy to absorb any moisture which may have been trapped in the double glazing. The last 80 G-1s built were lightweight G-1/R2. In these GM-1 nitrous oxide 'boost' was used, and the pilot's back armour was removed, as were all fittings for the long-range <b>drop</b> <b>tank.</b> A few G-1 flown by I./JG 1 are known to have carried the underwing 20mm MG 151/20 cannon gondolas.|$|E
25|$|The {{strategic}} bombing proponents {{within the}} USAAF, called the Bomber Mafia by their ideological opponents, had {{established in the}} early 1930s a policy against research to create long-range fighters, which they thought would not be practical; this kind of research was not to compete for bomber resources. Aircraft manufacturers understood {{that they would not}} be rewarded if they installed subsystems on their fighters to enable them to carry drop tanks to provide more fuel for extended range. Lieutenant Kelsey, acting against this policy, risked his career in late 1941 when he convinced Lockheed to incorporate such subsystems in the P-38E model, without putting his request in writing. It is possible that Kelsey was responding to Colonel George William Goddard's observation that the US sorely needed a high-speed, long-range photo reconnaissance plane. Along with a change order specifying some P-38Es be produced without guns but with photo reconnaissance cameras, to be designated the F-4-1-LO, Lockheed began working out the problems of <b>drop</b> <b>tank</b> design and incorporation. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, eventually about 100 P-38Es were sent to a modification center near Dallas, Texas, or to the new Lockheed assembly plant B-6 (today the Burbank Airport), to be fitted with four K-17 aerial photography cameras. All of these aircraft were also modified to be able to carry drop tanks. P-38Fs were modified as well. Every Lightning from the P-38G onward was drop tank-capable off the assembly line.|$|E
