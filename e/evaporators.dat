25|$|<b>Evaporators</b> are {{generally}} installed as a set, where two <b>evaporators</b> are coupled {{to a single}} distiller. For reliability, large ships will then have a pair of these sets. It is possible to arrange these sets of <b>evaporators</b> in either parallel or in series, for either maximum or most efficient production. This arranges the two <b>evaporators</b> so that the first operates at atmospheric pressure and high temperature (the maximum output case), but then uses the resultant hot output from the first evaporator to drive a second, running at maximum vacuum and low temperature (the maximum efficiency case). The overall output of feedwater may exceed the weight of steam first supplied, as up to 160% of it. Capacity is however reduced, to 72% of the maximum.|$|E
25|$|Solar stills can {{efficiently}} produce {{drinking water}} from ditch water or cistern water, especially high-efficiency multiple effect humidification designs, which separate the <b>evaporator(s)</b> and condenser(s).|$|E
25|$|<b>Evaporators</b> {{consume a}} great deal of steam, and thus fuel, in {{relation}} to the quantity of fresh water produced. Their efficiency is improved by working them at a partial vacuum, supplied by the main engine condensers. On modern diesel-powered ships, this vacuum can instead be produced by an ejector, usually worked by the output from the brine pump. Working under vacuum also reduces the temperature required to boil seawater and thus permits <b>evaporators</b> to be used with lower-temperature waste heat from the diesel cooling system.|$|E
50|$|The second mode {{of failure}} {{is due to the}} <b>evaporator</b> not being sealed properly. Often screws hold the <b>evaporator</b> into place from the inside of the refrigerator. If the screw heads are not sealed, water from inside the cabinet will flow by {{capillary}} action into the sealed <b>evaporator</b> space within the foam. Also, {{the back side of the}} <b>evaporator</b> has to be sealed so that ambient air cannot infiltrate the sealed <b>evaporator</b> space. When ambient air is allowed to come into contact with the <b>evaporator,</b> condensation results. The result for both of these issues is that water is trapped against the steel <b>evaporator</b> tubing, forming a galvanic cell which will rust a hole in the <b>evaporator,</b> resulting in premature fridge failure.|$|R
50|$|There are {{two main}} types of thermal {{expansion}} valves: internally or externally equalized. The difference between externally and internally equalized valves is how the <b>evaporator</b> pressure affects {{the position of the}} needle. In internally equalized valves, the <b>evaporator</b> pressure against the diaphragm is the pressure at the inlet of the <b>evaporator,</b> whereas in externally equalized valves, the <b>evaporator</b> pressure against the diaphragm is the pressure at the outlet of the <b>evaporator.</b> Externally equalized thermostatic expansion valves compensate for any pressure drop through the <b>evaporator.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>evaporator</b> tilt on the {{operating}} temperature of a loop heat pipe (LHP) without a secondary wick under terrestrial surroundings was investigated both experimentally and theoretically in this work. The experiments were conducted with the <b>evaporator</b> placed at three different tilts: (a) the <b>evaporator</b> was horizontal with the compensation chamber (CC), (b) the <b>evaporator</b> was vertically below the CC, and (c) the <b>evaporator</b> was a little higher than the CC with a tilt angle of 1. 80 °. Experimental {{results show that the}} <b>evaporator</b> tilt has significant effect {{on the operating}} temperature of the LHP: the operating temperature at <b>evaporator</b> tilt (c) was much higher than those at two other <b>evaporator</b> tilts. Theoretical analysis based on a two-zoned <b>evaporator</b> wick, i. e. a subcooled zone and a saturated zone, is conducted to explain the experimental results, indicating that the cooling effect of the returning liquid on the vapor region in the CC or the <b>evaporator</b> core is crucial in determining the operating temperature of LHPs, which should be well considered in the LHP design and applications...|$|R
25|$|Despite {{the obvious}} {{salinity}} of seawater, salt {{is not a}} problem for deposition until it reaches the saturation concentration. As this is around seven times that of seawater and <b>evaporators</b> are only operated to a concentration of two and a half times, this {{is not a problem}} in service.|$|E
25|$|In laboratories, a slurry of dry ice in {{an organic}} solvent {{is a useful}} {{freezing}} mixture for cold chemical reactions and for condensing solvents in rotary <b>evaporators.</b> Dry ice/acetone forms a cold bath of −78°C, {{which can be used}} for instance to prevent thermal runaway in a Swern oxidation.|$|E
25|$|Diesel-powered motorships {{do not use}} steam boilers as part {{of their}} main {{propulsion}} system and so may not have steam supplies available to drive <b>evaporators.</b> Some do, as they use auxiliary boilers for non-propulsion tasks such as this. Such boilers may even be heat-recovery boilers that are heated by the engine exhaust.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The <b>evaporator</b> is a {{critical}} component when using organic Rankine cycle (ORC) to recover waste heat from an internal combustion engine. Evaluating the amount of heat quantity that can be transferred in a designed <b>evaporator</b> {{is very important for}} a successful ORC system. In this paper, a finned tube <b>evaporator</b> used for recovering the exhaust waste heat of a diesel engine was presented. The mathematical model for the <b>evaporator</b> was set up according to the dimensions of the designed <b>evaporator</b> along with the specified working conditions of ORC. The <b>evaporator</b> performance was analyzed as the matched diesel engine operating at the rated power point. The results indicate that the heat transfer quantity of the designed <b>evaporator</b> can be reached at 76 kW, and the exhaust temperature at the <b>evaporator</b> exit can be reduced to 115 ℃...|$|R
25|$|Copper nickel is {{the group}} of alloys that are {{commonly}} specified in heat exchanger or condenser tubes in <b>evaporators</b> of desalination plants, process industry plants, air cooling zones of thermal power plants, high-pressure feed water heaters, and sea water piping in ships. The composition of the alloys can vary from 90% Cu–10% Ni to 70% Cu–30% Ni.|$|E
25|$|Other {{machinery}} includes nine {{heat recovery}} boilers, coupled with two oil-fired boilers to produce steam for heating fuel, domestic water, swimming pools, laundry equipment, and galleys. Four flash <b>evaporators</b> and a reverse-osmosis unit desalinate sea water to produce 1000 tons {{of fresh water}} daily. There is also a sanitation system and sewage disposal plant, air conditioning plant, and an electro-hydraulic steering system.|$|E
25|$|Mass Romantic is {{the debut}} album by Canadian indie rock {{supergroup}} The New Pornographers. Produced by David Carswell and band bassist John Collins, {{it was released}} on Mint Records on November 28, 2000. The album was {{three years in the}} making, with musicians A.C. Newman and Dan Bejar writing songs as early as 1998. With encouragement from peers, they recorded an album with other Canadian musicians from groups including The <b>Evaporators,</b> Zumpano, and Destroyer.|$|E
50|$|In a multi-effect <b>evaporator,</b> {{the vapor}} output of one {{phase of the}} <b>evaporator</b> is {{recycled}} as the heating medium for the next phase, reducing the overall consumption of steam for the <b>evaporator.</b>|$|R
50|$|Dehumidification (air drying) {{in an air}} {{conditioning}} system {{is provided by the}} <b>evaporator.</b> Since the <b>evaporator</b> operates at a temperature below the dew point, moisture in the air condenses on the <b>evaporator</b> coil tubes. This moisture is collected {{at the bottom of the}} <b>evaporator</b> in a pan and removed by piping to a central drain or onto the ground outside.|$|R

25|$|In the 90s, the {{proximity}} to Seattle's grunge scene spurred {{the popularity of}} bands like Maow, the Riff Randells, Cub, Gob, The Smugglers, Nardwuar the Human Serviette and his band The <b>Evaporators,</b> the New town Animals, and Thee Goblins which all happen {{to be on the}} same label, Mint Records. Moderate commercial success came to power-pop bands such as Age of Electric, Superconductor, Limblifter, Econoline Crush and Matthew Good. Other notable Vancouver residents (and sometimes Vancouver residents) include Grapes of Wrath, Odds, Art Bergmann, Spirit of The West, Moist, Sarah McLachlan, and Rose Chronicles.|$|E
25|$|Smaller {{diameter}} coils {{have better}} rates of heat transfer than conventional sized coils {{and they can}} withstand higher pressures required by {{the new generation of}} environmentally friendlier refrigerants. Smaller diameter coils also have lower material costs because they require less refrigerant, fin, and coil materials; and they enable the design of smaller and lighter high-efficiency air conditioners and refrigerators because the <b>evaporators</b> and condensers coils are smaller and lighter. MicroGroove uses a grooved inner surface of the tube to increase the surface to volume ratio and increase turbulence to mix the refrigerant and homogenize temperatures across the tube.|$|E
25|$|The first distilling {{plants that}} boiled a {{separate}} water supply {{from that of}} the main boiler, appeared around 1867. These were not directly heated by a flame, but had a primary steam circuit using main boiler steam through coils within a steam drum or evaporator. The distillate from this vessel then passed to an adjacent vessel, the distilling condenser. As these <b>evaporators</b> used a 'clean' seawater supply directly, rather than contaminated water from the boiler circuit, they could be used to supply both feedwater and drinking water. These double distillers appeared around 1884. For security against failure, ships except the smallest were fitted with two sets.|$|E
50|$|The main {{advantage}} of climbing/falling film plate <b>evaporator</b> is its short residence time. Since the liquid feed does not {{remain in the}} <b>evaporator</b> for long, this <b>evaporator</b> is suitable for heat/temperature sensitive material. Thus, this <b>evaporator</b> is used widely in food, beverages and pharmaceutical industries. Besides that, the colour, texture, nutritional content and taste of the liquid feed can be preserved too. Despite its functionality, this <b>evaporator</b> has a few drawbacks such as large energy consumption. Future development compromises installing large number of steam effects and recycle the steam where possible for better energy efficiency.|$|R
5000|$|For example, if the {{temperature}} in the <b>evaporator</b> increases, the pressure in the diaphragm increases causing the needle to lower. Lowering the needle allows more of the working fluid into the <b>evaporator</b> to absorb heat. The pressure at the inlet of the <b>evaporator</b> affects the position of the needle and prevents the working fluid from flowing back into the compressor. Since the pressure before the valve is higher than the pressure after the valve, the working fluid naturally flows into the <b>evaporator.</b> The pressure at the inlet of the <b>evaporator</b> acts on the diaphragm. There is also a spring providing a constant pressure closing the valve needle. The spring constantly restricts the amount of working fluid entering the <b>evaporator.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a heat dissipation device with a closed-loop heat-pipe effect, comprising a biphasic loop, consisting of: an <b>evaporator</b> (1) for vapourising a heat-transfer fluid; a condenser (2) for liquefying the heat-transfer fluid; a vapour supply line (31) between the <b>evaporator</b> and the condenser, said vapour supply line being arranged downstream of the <b>evaporator</b> and upstream of the condenser {{so as to}} allow {{the passage of the}} vapour heat-transfer fluid from the <b>evaporator</b> to the condenser; and a liquid supply line (32) between the condenser and the <b>evaporator,</b> said liquid supply line being arranged downstream of the condenser and upstream of the <b>evaporator</b> so as to allow the passage of the liquid heat-transfer fluid from the condenser to the <b>evaporator.</b> The invention is characterised in that the device also comprises a tank (4) connected between the vapour supply line and the liquid supply line, said tank comprising an adsorbent material for the adsorption/desorption of the heat transfer fluid...|$|R
25|$|Operation of an {{evaporator}} {{represents a}} costly consumption of main boiler steam, thus fuel. <b>Evaporators</b> for a warship {{must also be}} adequate to supply the boilers at continuous full power when required, {{even though this is}} rarely required. Varying the vacuum under which the evaporator works, and thus the boiling point of the feedwater, may optimise production for either maximum output, or better efficiency, depending on which is needed at the time. Greatest output is achieved when the evaporator operates at near atmospheric pressure and a high temperature (for saturated steam this will be at a limit of 100°C), which may then have an efficiency of 0.87kg of feedwater produced for each kg of steam supplied.|$|E
25|$|Citric acid is an {{excellent}} chelating agent, binding metals by making them soluble. It is used to remove and discourage the buildup of limescale from boilers and <b>evaporators.</b> It {{can be used to}} treat water, which makes it useful in improving the effectiveness of soaps and laundry detergents. By chelating the metals in hard water, it lets these cleaners produce foam and work better without need for water softening. Citric acid is the active ingredient in some bathroom and kitchen cleaning solutions. A solution with a six percent concentration of citric acid will remove hard water stains from glass without scrubbing. In industry, it is used to dissolve rust from steel. Citric acid can be used in shampoo to wash out wax and coloring from the hair.|$|E
25|$|From 23 December 1995 through 22 March 1996 Admiral Kuznetsov {{made her}} first 90-day Mediterranean {{deployment}} with 13 Su-33, 2 Su-25 UTG, and 11 helicopters aboard. The deployment was {{to allow the}} carrier, which {{was accompanied by a}} frigate, destroyer and oiler, to adapt to the Mediterranean climate and to perform continuous flight operations until 21:00 each day, as the Barents Sea only receives about one hour of sunlight during this time of year. This cruise marked the 300th anniversary of the Russian Navy celebrated in 1996. During that period the carrier lay at anchor off the port of Tartus, Syria. Her aircraft often made flights close to the Israeli shore line and were escorted by Israeli F-16s. During the deployment, a severe water shortage occurred due to <b>evaporators</b> breaking down.|$|E

30|$|In {{designing}} the decrease {{of the total}} thermal resistance (RWF) of an MNFHP, the major thermal resistance of the <b>evaporator</b> or condenser was reduced using MNFs with excellent thermal conductivity. The thermal resistance related with the MNF flowing between an <b>evaporator</b> and a condenser was accomplished by specifically configuring an MNFHP. Therefore, {{the improvement of the}} heat transfer in an <b>evaporator</b> or a condenser with magnetic fields was initially evaluated by testing the <b>evaporator</b> or condenser.|$|R
25|$|The unevaporated {{seawater}} in an evaporator gradually {{becomes a}} concentrated brine and, like the early steam boilers with seawater feed, this brine must be intermittently blown down every {{six to eight}} hours and dumped overboard. Early <b>evaporators</b> were simply mounted high-up and dumped their brine by gravity. As the increasing complexity of surface condensers demanded better feedwater quality, a pump {{became part of the}} evaporator equipment. This pump had three combined functions as a seawater feed pump, a fresh water delivery pump and a brine extraction pump, each of progressively smaller capacity. The brine salinity was an important factor in evaporator efficiency: too dense encouraged scale formation, but too little represented a waste of heated seawater. The optimum operating salinity was thus fixed at three times that of seawater, and so the brine pump had to remove at least one third of the total feedwater supply rate. These pumps resembled the steam-powered reciprocating feedwater pumps already in service. They were usually produced by the well-known makers, such as G & J Weir. Vertical and horizontal pumps were used, although horizontal pumps were favoured as they encouraged the de-aeration of feedwater. Electrically powered rotary centrifugal pumps were later adopted, as more efficient and more reliable. There were initial concerns whether these would be capable of pumping brine against the vacuum of the evaporator and so there was also a transitional type where a worm gear-driven plunger pump for brine was driven from the rotary shaft.|$|E
500|$|The {{outbreak}} of World War II {{made it impossible}} to remove her from service, and as a consequence she never received the scheduled modernisation afforded to other capital ships such as the battlecruiser [...] and several of the s. The ship's condensers were in such bad condition by this time that much of the output from the fresh-water <b>evaporators</b> was required to replenish the boiler feed water and could not be used by the crew to wash and bathe or even to heat the mess decks during cold weather as the steam pipes were too leaky. These problems also reduced her steam output so that she was unable to attain her designed speed.|$|E
500|$|To counter this, it was {{determined}} {{a top speed of}} between [...] was possible if the power plant from North Carolina could be reduced in size enough to fit in the tighter hull of South Dakota. In order to do so the boilers were positioned directly above the turbines in the same arrangement to have been used in the 1916 s. The boilers were then rearranged several times so they were staggered with the turbines, eventually ending directly alongside the turbines. The propulsion system was arranged as close together as possible, and the <b>evaporators</b> and distilling equipment were placed in the machinery rooms. This provided enough additional space behind the armored belt to add a second plotting room.|$|E
