40|$|International audienceBackground and Objective: Chlorella vulgaris is a multi-cellular edible algal {{species with}} {{abundant}} proteins. Extraction of high value protein fractions for pharmaceutical and nutritional applications can significantly increase the {{commercial value of}} microalga biomasses. There is no known report on the anticancer peptides derived from the Chlorella vulgaris abundant protein. Materials and Methods: This study examined the antimicrobial and anticancer effects of peptides from a hydrolyzed Chlorella vulgaris protein with 62 kDa molecular weight. Protein hydrolysis was done by pepsin as a <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>protease,</b> and was monitored through protein content measurement, sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and high performance liquid chromatography measurements. Inhibitory effect of the produced peptides on Escherichia coli cells and breast cancer cell lines was assayed. Results and Conclusion: Hydrolyzed peptides induced a decrease of about 34. 1 % {{in the growth of}} Escherichia coli, and the peptides of 3 to 5 kDa molecular weight had strong impact on the viability of breast cancer cells with IC 50 value of 50 mu g mu l(- 1). The peptide fractions demonstrating antimicrobial and anti-cancer activities have the potential for use as functional food ingredients for health benefits. These results demonstrate that inexpensive algae proteins could be a new alternative to produce anticancer peptides...|$|E
40|$|Proteomics is {{a rapidly}} {{emerging}} set of key {{technologies that are}} of major importance for proteins and drug development process, especially when mass spectrometry (MS) is being used for high-throughput characterization and identification of proteins. Since the safer and healthier angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are extremely concerned, many research groups have combed for novel ACE inhibitors from food components by different approaches. Here, shotgun proteomics technology aided with structure-activity analysis was applied to screen ACE inhibitory peptides from hydrolyzed red deer plasma. The peptides were analysed by mass spectrometry after primary separation with Sephadex G- 25 chromatography. 36 peptides were identified by searching red deer database and 165 peptide sequences derived were identified in mammalian database. Amino acid sequences of peptide and bioactivity relationship have been developed as a faster and useful way to predict and screen new inhibitors. Depending {{on the relationship of}} peptide structure and ACE inhibitory activity, a nonapeptide, VYNEGLPAP, was predicted with ACE inhibitory activity. The activity was verified by synthesized VYNEGLPAP and the 50 % inhibition concentration (IC(50)) was 3. 1 mu mol center dot L(- 1). VYNEGLPAP had good thermal stability, pH stability and strong enzyme-resistant properties against <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>protease.</b> Kinetic experiments demonstrated that inhibitory kinetic mechanism of this peptide was competitive. This study demonstrated the possibility of screening bioactive peptides from protein hydrolysates mixture based on shotgun proteomics technology, which will provide a potential convenient method to screening bioactive peptides from protein source...|$|E
40|$|Clostridium difficile is {{a leading}} cause of death from {{gastrointestinal}} infections in North America. Antibiotic therapy is effective, but the high incidence of relapse and the rise in hypervirulent strains warrant the search for novel treatments. Surface layer proteins (SLPs) cover the entire C. difficile bacterial surface, are composed of high-molecular-weight (HMW) and low-molecular-weight (LMW) subunits, and mediate adherence to host cells. Passive and active immunization against SLPs has enhanced hamster survival, suggesting that antibody-mediated neutralization may be an effective therapeutic strategy. Here, we isolated a panel of SLP-specific single-domain antibodies (VHHs) using an immune llama phage display library and SLPs isolated from C. difficile hypervirulent strain QCD- 32 g 58 (027 ribotype) as a target antigen. Binding studies revealed a number of VHHs that bound QCD- 32 g 58 SLPs with high affinity (K D 2 ̆ 009 = 2 ̆ 00932 ̆ 0136 nM) and targeted epitopes located on the LMW subunit of the SLP. The VHHs demonstrated melting temperatures as high as 75 0 C, and a few were resistant to the <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>protease</b> pepsin at physiologically relevant concentrations. In addition, we demonstrated the binding specificity of the VHHs to the major C. difficile ribotypes by whole cell ELISA, where all VHHs were found to bind 001 and 027 ribotypes, and a subset of antibodies were found to be broadly cross-reactive in binding cells representative of 012, 017, 023, and 078 ribotypes. Finally, we showed that several of the VHHs inhibited C. difficile QCD- 32 g 58 motility in vitro. Targeting SLPs with VHHs may be a viable therapeutic approach against C. difficile-associated disease. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|E

High levels of gluten exorphin A 5 (Gly–Tyr–Tyr–Pro–Thr) immunoreactive materials were detected in the pepsin–pancreatic elastase digest by a competitive ELISA. From this digest, gluten exorphin A 5, B 5 and B 4 were isolated. This means that these peptides are released in the gastrointestinal tracts after ingestion of wheat gluten. The yield of gluten exorphin A 5 in the pepsin–elastase digest was larger than that in the pepsin–thermolysin digest. The gluten exorphin A 5 sequence is found 15 times in the primary structure of the high molecular weight glutenin.

40|$|SummaryNew {{tools are}} needed for {{managing}} celiac sprue, a lifelong immune disease of the small intestine. Ongoing drug trials are also prompting a search for noninvasive biomarkers of gluten-induced intestinal change. We have synthesized and characterized noninflammatory gluten peptide analogs in which key Gln residues are replaced by Asn or His. Like their proinflammatory counterparts, these biomarkers are resistant to <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>proteases,</b> susceptible to glutenases, and permeable across enterocyte barriers. Unlike gluten peptides, however, they are not appreciably recognized by transglutaminase, HLA-DQ 2, or disease-specific T cells. In vitro and animal {{studies show that the}} biomarkers can detect intestinal permeability changes as well as glutenase-catalyzed gastric detoxification of gluten. Accordingly, controlled clinical studies are warranted to evaluate the use of these peptides as probes for abnormal intestinal permeability in celiac patients and for glutenase efficacy in clinical trials and practice...|$|R
40|$|Hypertension is a {{significant}} health problem worldwide, which carries a high risk factor for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease. It is estimated that about 20 % of the worldwide adult population suffers from this common serious chronic disease. Angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor {{is one of the}} antihypertensive drugs, such as captopril, alacepril and enalapril. ACE, which {{plays an important role in}} regulating blood pressure, catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin from an inactive decapeptide (angiotensinⅠ) to a potent vasoconstrictor octapeptide (angiotensinⅡ) and inactivates antihypertensive vasodilator bradykinin. Various ACE inhibitory drugs have been shown to result in an antihypertensive effect, but these artificially synthesized ACE inhibitors are believed to have certain side effects, such as cough, angioedema, taste disturbance and skin rashes. Therefore, bioactive peptides with ACE inhibitory activity derived from food proteins are considered to be safer and have no side effects for treatment of hypertension. The blood of deer is used as traditional Chinese medicine for a long time. In this study, a novel peptide with ACE inhibitory was stemmed from red deer plasma. Red deer plasma protein was precipitated by acetone and subsequently digested. The separation was performed with Sephadex G- 25 gel filtration chromatography. The fraction with highest ACE inhibitory activity was analyzed by electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS). ESI-MS/MS data and modeling structure information were used to search for ACE inhibitory peptides in red deer database. A novel inhibitory effect peptide with sequence VYNEGLPAP was firstly obtained from red deer plasma. The 50 % inhibition concentration (IC 50) was 3. 1 μM in vitro. Stability study for ACE inhibitory activity showed that this nonapeptide had the good heat and pH stability and strong enzyme-resistant properties against <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>protease.</b> Kinetic experiments demonstrated that inhibitory kinetic mechanism of this peptide was competitive. These results suggest that the nonapeptide and the hydrolysate from red deer plasma proteins may be potential source with antihypertensive effect.

40|$|Abstract: Defatted corn protein was digested using five {{different}} proteases, Alcalase, Trypsin, Neutrase, Protamex and Flavourzyme, {{in order to}} produce bile acid binding peptides. Bile acid binding capacity was analyzed in vitro using peptides from different proteases of defatted corn hydrolysate. Some crystalline bile acids like sodium glycocholate, sodium cholate and sodium deoxycholate were individually tested using HPLC to see which enzymes can release more peptides with high bile acid binding capacity. Peptides from Flavourzyme defatted corn hydrolysate exhibited significantly (p < 0. 05) stronger bile acid binding capacity than all others hydrolysates tested and all crystalline bile acids tested were highly bound by cholestyramine, a positive control well known as a cholesterol-reducing agent. The bile acid binding capacity of Flavourzyme hydrolysate was almost preserved after <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>proteases</b> digestion. The molecular weight of Flavourzyme hydrolysate was determined and most of the peptides were found between 500 – 180 Da.

Therefore, we performed phylogenetic {{analyses of the}} gastrointestinal microbiome in order to search for candidate InsP 6 phosphatases. We determined that prominent gut bacteria express homologs of the mammalian InsP 6 phosphatase (MINPP) and characterized the enzyme from Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (BtMinpp). We show that BtMinpp has exceptionally high catalytic activity, which we rationalize {{on the basis of}} mutagenesis studies and by determining its crystal structure at 1. 9  Å resolution. We demonstrate that BtMinpp is packaged inside outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) protecting the enzyme from degradation by <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>proteases.</b> Moreover, we uncover an example of cross-kingdom cell-to-cell signaling, showing that the BtMinpp-OMVs interact with intestinal epithelial cells to promote intracellular Ca 2 + signaling.

The hydrolysates showed higher antioxidative activities and scavenging activities against active oxygen {{species such as}} hydroxyl radical and superoxide anion radical. Moreover, these hydrolysates exhibited high angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitory activites that were similar or higher than those from various fermented foods such as fish sauce, sake, soy sauce, vinegar, miso and natto.

These responses were dependent on prior treatment with tissue transglutaminase. Α2-gliadin differs from the other α-gliadins, specifically because it contains an insert of 14 amino acids. This particular insertion creates 6 T-cell sites where, in the most similar gliadins, there are 2 or less sites. The sites belong to three [...] groups [...] "α-I", [...] "α-II", and [...] "α-III" [...] The insertion also creates a larger region of α-gliadin that is resistant to <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>proteases.</b> The smallest digest of trypsin and chymotrypsin for the region is a 33mer.

The simulated human digestion method {{was used to test}} if bioactive peptides could be derived from the gastrointestinal digestion of rice bran proteins. Crude rice bran protein, albumin, glutelin, globulin and prolamin of rice bran proteins were evaluated.

Regulation of <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>proteases</b> becomes particularly important when fish starved. In this work, tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus) were allotted to various treatments including starvation times (3, 5, and 7 d) and 1 d of re-feeding after various starvation times {{to test whether}} food deprivation causes changes in protease activities in the gastrointestinal tract. No significant differences in body weights were found among all groups. The relative stomach weights of the starved groups (3 and 5 d) {{were significantly higher than}} those of the control group. The relative intestinal weight of the starved group after 7 d of starvation was significantly higher than that of the control group. Additionally, re-feeding resulted in relative stomach and intestinal weight increases after 5 and 7 d of starvation, respectively. The activity of trypsin (T) in fish subjected to a short starvation period was lower than that in fish fed normally, whereas chymotrypsin (C) activity increased. The T/C ratio decreased with starvation time, indicating the possibility that the growth of tilapia is inhibited by starvation. Furthermore, re-feeding after starvation resulted in increased trypsin and chymotrypsin activities, and a decrease in the T/C ratio compared to before feeding. These data suggest that short-term starvation dampens trypsin activity and the T/C ratio in relation to the growth of tilapia, and that re-feeding consequently stimulates the activities of intestinal proteolytic enzymes in tilapia...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Coccidiosis {{caused by}} protozoans of genus Eimeria is a chicken {{parasitic}} disease of great economical importance. Conventional disease control strategies depend on vaccination and prophylactic use of anticoccidial drugs. Alternative solution {{to prevent and}} treat coccidiosis {{could be provided by}} passive immunization using orally delivered neutralizing antibodies. We investigated the possibility to mitigate the parasitic infection by feeding poultry with antibody expressing transgenic crop seeds. Results Using the phage display antibody library, we generated a panel of anti- Eimeria scFv antibody fragments with high sporozoite-neutralizing activity. These antibodies were expressed either transiently in agrobacteria-infiltrated tobacco leaves or stably in seeds of transgenic pea plants. Comparison of the scFv antibodies purified either from tobacco leaves or from the pea seeds demonstrated no difference in their antigen-binding activity and molecular form compositions. Force-feeding experiments demonstrated that oral delivery of flour prepared from the transgenic pea seeds had higher parasite neutralizing activity in vivo than the purified antibody fragments isolated from tobacco. The pea seed content was found to protect antibodies against degradation by <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>proteases</b> (> 100 -fold gain in stability). Ad libitum feeding of chickens demonstrated that the transgenic seeds were well consumed and not shunned. Furthermore, feeding poultry with shred prepared from the antibody expressing pea seeds led to significant mitigation of infection caused both by high and low challenge doses of Eimeria oocysts.

40|$|We {{set out to}} gain deeper {{insight into}} the {{potential}} of antibody light chain variable domains (VLs) as immunotherapeutics. To this end, we generated a na human VL phage display library and, by using a method previously shown to select for non-aggregating antibody heavy chain variable domains (VHs), we isolated a diversity of VL domains by panning the library against B cell super-antigen protein L. Eight domains representing different germline origins were shown to be non-aggregating at concentrations as high as 450 3 ̆bcM, indicating VL repertoires are {{a rich source of}} nonaggregating domains. In addition, the VLs demonstrated high expression yields in E. coli, protein L binding and high reversibility of thermal unfolding. A side-by-side comparison with a set of non-aggregating human VHs revealed that the VLs had similar overall profiles with respect to melting temperature (Tm), reversibility of thermal unfolding and resistance to <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>proteases.</b> Successful engineering of a non-canonical disulfide linkage in the core of VLs did not compromise the non-aggregation state or protein L binding properties. Furthermore, the introduced disulfide bond significantly increased their Tms, by 5. 5 - 17. 5 0 C, and pepsin resistance, although it somewhat reduced expression yields and subtly changed the structure of VLs. Human VLs and engineered versions may make suitable therapeutics due to their desirable biophysical features. The disulfide linkage-engineered VLs may be the preferred therapeutic format because of their higher stability, especially for oral therapy applications that necessitate high resistance to the stomach's acidic pH and pepsin. 9 2014 Landes Bioscience.

40|$|Angiotensin I {{converting}} enzyme (ACE) inhibitory peptides can induce antihypertensive effects after oral administration. By {{means of}} an ACE inhibitory peptide database, containing about 500 reported sequences and their IC 50 values, the different proteins in pea and whey were quantitatively evaluated as precursors for ACE inhibitory peptides. This analysis was combined with experimental data from the evolution in ACE inhibitory activity and protein degradation during in vitro gastrointestinal digestion. Pea proteins produced similar in silico scores and were degraded early in the in vitro digestion. High ACE inhibitory activity was observed after the simulated stomach phase and augmented slightly in the simulated small intestine phase. The major whey protein beta-lactoglobulin obtained the highest in silico scores, which corresponded {{with the fact that}} degradation of this protein in vitro only occurred from the simulated small intestine phase on and resulted in a 10 -fold increase in the ACE inhibitory activity. Whey protein obtained total in silico scores of about 124 ml/mg, compared to 46 ml/mg for pea protein, indicating that whey protein would be a richer source of ACE inhibitory peptides than pea protein. Although P-lactoglobulin is only partially digested, a higher ACE inhibitory activity was indeed found in the whey (IC 50 = 0. 048 mg/ml) compared to the pea digest (IC 50 = 0. 076 mg/ml). In silico gastrointestinal digestion of the highest scoring proteins in pea and whey, vicilin and albumin PA 2, and beta-lactoglobulin, respectively, directly released a number of potent ACE inhibitory peptides. Several other ACE inhibitory sequences resisted in silico digestion by <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>proteases.</b> Briefly, the quantitative in silico, analysis will facilitate the study of precursor proteins on a large scale and the specific release of bioactive peptides.

An in silico prediction method {{was used to test}} if bioactive peptides could be derived from the gastrointestinal digestion of gut endogenous proteins. Twenty six gut endogenous proteins and seven dietary proteins were evaluated. The peptides present after gastric and intestinal digestion were predicted based on the amino acid sequence of the proteins and the known specificities of the major <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>proteases.</b> The predicted resultant peptides possessing amino acid sequences identical to those of known bioactive peptides were identified. After gastrointestinal digestion (based on the in silico simulation), the total number of bioactive peptides predicted to be released ranged from 1 (gliadin) to 55 (myosin) for the selected dietary proteins and from 1 (secretin) to 39 (mucin- 5 AC) for the selected gut endogenous proteins. Within the intact proteins and after simulated gastrointestinal digestion, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) -inhibitory peptide sequences were the most frequently observed in both the dietary and endogenous proteins. Among the dietary proteins, after in silico simulated gastrointestinal digestion, myosin was found to have the highest number of ACE-inhibitory peptide sequences (49 peptides), while for the gut endogenous proteins, mucin- 5 AC had the greatest number of ACE-inhibitory peptide sequences (38 peptides).

These latter peptides can trigger pro-inflammatory T cell responses resulting in tissue remodeling, malnutrition {{and a variety of}} other complications. A strict lifelong gluten-free diet is currently the only available treatment to cope with gluten intolerance. Post-proline cutting enzymes have been shown to effectively degrade the immunogenic gluten peptides and have been proposed as oral supplements. Several existing digestive enzyme supplements also claim to aid in gluten degradation. Here we investigate the effectiveness of such existing enzyme supplements in comparison with a well characterized post-proline cutting enzyme, Prolyl EndoPeptidase from Aspergillus niger (AN-PEP). Five commercially available digestive enzyme supplements along with purified digestive enzymes were subjected to 1) enzyme assays and 2) mass spectrometric identification. Gluten epitope degradation was monitored by 1) R 5 ELISA, 2) mass spectrometric analysis of the degradation products and 3) T cell proliferation assays. The digestive enzyme supplements showed comparable proteolytic activities with near neutral pH optima and modest gluten detoxification properties as determined by ELISA. Mass spectrometric analysis revealed the presence of many different enzymes including amylases and a variety of different proteases with aminopeptidase and carboxypeptidase activity. The enzyme supplements leave the nine immunogenic epitopes of the 26 -mer and 33 -mer gliadin fragments largely intact. In contrast, the pure enzyme AN-PEP effectively degraded all nine epitopes in the pH range of the stomach at much lower dose. T cell proliferation assays confirmed the mass spectrometric data.

Through protein engineering, several Clostridium difficile toxin A-specific heavy chain antibody variable domains (V(H) Hs) were expressed with an additional disulfide bond by introducing Ala/Gly 54 Cys and Ile 78 Cys mutations. Mutant antibodies were compared to their wild-type counterparts with respect to expression yield, non-aggregation status, affinity for toxin A, circular dichroism (CD) structural signatures, thermal stability, protease resistance, and toxin A-neutralizing capacity. The mutant V(H) Hs {{were found to be}} well expressed, although with lower yields compared to wild-type counterparts, were non-aggregating monomers, retained low nM affinity for toxin A, albeit the majority showed somewhat reduced affinity compared to wild-type counterparts, and were capable of in vitro toxin A neutralization in cell-based assays. Far-UV and near-UV CD spectroscopy consistently showed shifts in peak intensity and selective peak minima for wild-type and mutant V(H) H pairs; however, the overall CD profile remained very similar. A significant increase in the thermal unfolding midpoint temperature was observed for all mutants at both neutral and acidic pH. Digestion of the V(H) Hs with the major <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>proteases,</b> at biologically relevant concentrations, revealed a significant increase in pepsin resistance for all mutants and an increase in chymotrypsin resistance for the majority of mutants. Mutant V(H) H trypsin resistance was similar to that of wild-type V(H) Hs, although the trypsin resistance of one V(H) H mutant was significantly reduced. Therefore, the introduction of a second disulfide bond in the hydrophobic core not only increases V(H) H thermal stability at neutral pH, as previously shown, but also represents a generic strategy to increase V(H) H stability at low pH and impart protease resistance, with only minor perturbations in target binding affinities.

30|$|The {{untreated}} {{high blood}} pressure {{is considered to be}} the central factor in stroke which accounts approximately 33 % deaths (Mark and Davis [2000]). There are several classes of pharmacological agents which have been used in the treatment of hypertension, and one class of antihypertensive drugs known as angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors is associated with a low rate of adverse side effects and is the preferred class of antihypertensive agents when treating patients with concurrent secondary diseases or cardiovascular diseases (Zaman et al. [2002]). ACE (peptidyldipeptide hydrolase, EC 3.4. 15.1) is a dipeptide-liberating Zn-containing exopeptidase, which removes a dipeptide from the C-terminus of angiotensin I to form angiotensin II, a very hypertensive compound. Several ACE inhibitory peptides were isolated from food proteins and exhibited generally to reduce blood pressures of SHRs (Martínez-Maqueda et al. [2012]). Fujita et al. ([2000]) found that the octapeptides of FFGRCVSP (IC 50 [*]=[*] 0.4  μM) and ERKIKVYL (IC 50 [*]=[*] 1.2  μM) were potent ACE inhibitors, but none of them were effective in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) to reduce the blood pressure. These potential ACE inhibitory peptides were further hydrolyzed by the rat’s <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>proteases</b> and then lose their antihypertensive effects on SHR in vivo. We reported that yam dioscorin and its peptic hydrolysates exhibited ACE inhibitory activity (Hsu et al. [2002]) and antihypertensive activity (Lin et al. [2006]) using SHRs as models, however, the active peptides are not really isolated until now. In this study, using angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition as preliminary screenings, two out of twenty-three synthesized peptides from a computer-aided simulation of pepsin hydrolysis of yam dioscorin were selected for further ex vivo and in vivo experiments and captopril was used for comparisons. It is suggested that KTCGY and KRIHF show vasodilating effects and can reduce SHR’s systolic blood pressure (SBP) which may contribute important roles in yam dioscorin for regulating blood pressure in vivo.|$|R

40|$|Clostridium difficile is {{a leading}} cause of {{nosocomial}} infection in North America and a considerable challenge to healthcare professionals in hospitals and nursing homes. The Gram-positive bacterium produces two exotoxins, toxin A (TcdA) and toxin B (TcdB), which are the major virulence factors responsible for C. difficile-associated disease (CDAD) and are targets for CDAD therapy. In this work, recombinant single-domain antibody fragments (VHHs) which target the cell receptor binding domains of TcdA or TcdB were isolated from an immune, llama phage display library and characterized. Four VHHs (A 4. 2, A 5. 1, A 20. 1, and A 26. 8) were potent neutralizers of the cytopathic effects of TcdA in an in vitro assay and the neutralizing potency was enhanced when VHHs were administered in combinations. Epitope mapping experiments revealed that some synergistic combinations consisted of VHHs recognizing overlapping epitopes, an indication that factors other than mere epitope blocking are responsible for the increased neutralization. Binding assays revealed TcdA-specific VHHs neutralized TcdA by binding to sites other than the carbohydrate binding pocket of the toxin. The TcdB-specific VHHs failed to neutralize TcdB, as did a panel of human VL antibodies isolated from a synthetic library. To enhance the stability of the C. difficile TcdA-specific VHHs for oral therapeutic applications, the VHHs were expressed with an additional disulfide bond by introducing Ala/Gly 54 Cys and Ile 78 Cys mutations. The mutant VHHs were found to be well expressed, were non-aggregating monomers, retained low nM affinity for TcdA, and were capable of in vitro TcdA neutralization. Digestion of the VHHs with the major <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>proteases,</b> at biologically relevant concentrations, revealed a significant increase in pepsin resistance for all mutants and an increase in chymotrypsin resistance for the majority of mutants without compromising inherent VHH trypsin resistance. Collectively, the second disulfide not only increased VHH thermal stability at neutral pH, as previously shown, but also represents a generic strategy to increase VHH stability at low pH and impart protease resistance. These are all desirable characteristics for the design of protein-based oral therapeutics. In conclusion, llama VHHs represent a class of novel, non-antibiotic inhibitors of infectious disease virulence factors such as C. difficile toxins...|$|R
40|$|Serine proteases {{from the}} circulation, {{inflammatory}} cells, digestive glands and microorganisms can signal to cells by cleaving protease-activated receptors (PARs), {{a family of}} four G-protein-coupled receptors. Proteases cleave PARs at specific sites to expose tethered ligand domains that bind to and activate the cleaved receptors. Despite this irreversible mechanism of activation, PAR signaling is tightly regulated to prevent the uncontrolled stimulation of cells. Although PARs are found in all organ systems, protease signaling is of particular interest in the <b>gastrointestinal</b> tract, where <b>proteases</b> regulate neurotransmission, secretion, motility, epithelial permeability and intestinal inflammation, and can thus contribute to disease...|$|R
40|$|The zinc {{metalloprotease}} EmpA is a virulence {{factor in}} the fish pathogen Vibrio anguillarum. Previous {{studies have shown that}} two strains of V. anguillarum regulate empA differently. Strain M 93 Sm exhibits protease activity only in the presence of fish <b>gastrointestinal</b> mucus, while <b>protease</b> activity is detected in NB 10 culture supernatant under all stationary-phase conditions. In this study, we use real-time reverse transcription-PCR to show that even in conditions where no protease activity is detected, empA transcription occurs. Western blot analysis revealed that EmpA is secreted as a ∼ 48 -kDa proenzyme and that activation occurs extracellularly by the removal of a ∼ 10 -kDa peptide. The presence of stable extracellular pro-EmpA in M 93 Sm culture supernatants suggests that activation of EmpA is not autolytic...|$|R
40|$|Bresaola is {{traditionally}} produced by curing and air-drying entire anatomic cuts of lean bovine hindquarters. Because of its low-fat and high-protein content, Bresaola is increasingly appreciated for the nutritional properties {{and has become}} one of the best known and exported Italian meat products. Both sarcoplasmic and myofibrillar protein fractions of Bresaola are extensively hydrolyzed by endogenous proteases, since the early post mortem, releasing a large variety of peptides many of which can exert several biological activities in human body. When ingested, Bresaola proteins and (poly) peptides are further degraded by <b>gastrointestinal</b> (GI) <b>proteases.</b> With the aim to identify bovine muscle-derived proteins and peptides surviving digestion, two Bresaola samples (one with and one without the Protected Geographical Indication label) were subjected to a static in vitro model of digestion that included the sequential oral, gastric and duodenal phases. The “digestomes” were characterized by mass spectrometry-based proteomic and peptidomic strategies. Aside from slight differences, probably related to the different nature of the raw material and to different technological processes, the great part of the peptides released at the end of digestion was common to the two samples. Sarcoplasmic proteins were promptly degraded, whereas myofibrillar chains require a previous proteolytic release and are not completely hydrolyzed by gastro-duodenal proteases even after prolonged hydrolysis. More than 170 peptides liberated from the major structural (actin, myosin) and sarcoplasmic muscle proteins were identified. Several among these peptides are or are precursor of potentially antihypertensive or antioxidant sequences...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>gastrointestinal</b> mucus on <b>protease</b> {{activity}} in Vibrio anguillarum was investigated. Protease activity {{was measured by}} using an azocasein hydrolysis assay. Cells grown to stationary phase in mucus (200 μg of mucus protein/ml) exhibited ninefold-greater protease activity than cells grown in Luria-Bertani broth plus 2 % NaCl (LB 20). Protease induction was examined with cells grown in LB 20 and resuspended in mucus, LB 20, nine-salts solution (NSS [a carbon-, nitrogen-, and phosphorus-free salt solution]), or marine minimal medium (3 M) (∼ 109 CFU/ml). Induction of protease activity occurred 60 to 90 min after addition of mucus and was ≥ 70 -fold greater than protease activity measured in cells incubated in either LB 20 or 3 M. Mucus was fractionated into aqueous and chloroform-methanol-soluble fractions. The aqueous fraction supported growth of V. anguillarum cells, but did not induce protease activity. The chloroform-methanol-soluble fraction did not support growth, nor did it induce protease activity. When the two fractions were mixed, protease activity was induced. The chloroform-methanol-soluble fraction did not induce protease activity in cells growing in LB 20. EDTA (50 mM) inhibited the protease induced by mucus. Upon addition of divalent cations, Mg 2 + (100 mM) was more effective than equimolar amounts of either Ca 2 + or Zn 2 + in restoring activity, suggesting that the mucus-inducible protease was a magnesium-dependent metalloprotease. An empA mutant strain of V. anguillarum did not exhibit protease activity after exposure to mucus, but did grow in mucus. Southern analysis and PCR amplification confirmed that V. anguillarum M 93 contained empA. These data demonstrate that the empA metalloprotease of V. anguillarum is specifically induced by gastrointestinal mucus...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} salmon <b>gastrointestinal</b> mucus on <b>protease</b> {{activity}} in Vibrio anguillarum M 93 Sm was investigated. Cells grown to stationary phase in nine salts solution plus mucus (NSSM) exhibited ninefold-greater protease activity than cells grown in Luria-Bertani broth plus 2 % NaCl (LB 20). Induction of protease activity in stationary phase cells occurred 60 min after addition of mucus and was ≥ 70 -fold greater than protease activity measured in cells incubated {{in any other}} condition. Southern analysis and PCR confirmed that V. anguillarum M 93 contained empA. An empA mutant of V. anguillarum did not exhibit protease activity after exposure to mucus, but did grow in mucus. Atlantic salmon challenged with V. anguillarum M 93 Sm and NB 10 resulted in mortality when administered by intraperitoneal injection (IP) or anal intubation (AIB). NB 12 (empA mutant) was avirulent via either route of infection. M 99 (empA mutant) virulence was attenuated by AIB, but fully virulent by IP. It is hypothesized that differences in virulence are {{due to differences in}} regulation of empA. Northern analysis of empA and quantification of protease activity from LB 20 or NSSM incubated cells or cells incubated in conditioned media demonstrate that expression of empA is differentially regulated in V. anguillarum strains NB 10 and M 93 Sm and requires σ S, quorum sensing molecules, and gastrointestinal mucus. ^ Autoinducer- 2 (AI- 2) is a non-AHL quorum sensing signal molecule that regulates bioluminescence in Vibrio harveyi. In an assay that measures luminescence, the V. harveyi sensor strain BB 170 detected AI- 2 activity in V. anguillarum culture supernatants during late-exponential growth phase and stationary phase. Southern analysis demonstrated the presence of a V. harveyi luxS (AI- 2 synthase) homolog in V. anguillarum. M 93 Sm cells incubated in conditioned LB 20 supernatants from a V. anguillarum luxS mutant, M 01, which did not contain AI- 2 activity, stimulated an earlier and greater level of protease activity than wild-type conditioned LB 20. Wild-type V. anguillarum survived better during starvation in NSS than the luxS mutant. Infection studies in Atlantic salmon revealed no decline in virulence of M 01 compared to M 93 Sm. It does not appear that the V. anguillarum LuxS quorum sensing system is important for growth or virulence, but may be important during starvation-survival. ...|$|R
