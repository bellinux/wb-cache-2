5|$|The {{riddle of}} water and {{nutrient}} transport through the plant remained. Physiologist Von Mohl explored solute transport and the theory of water uptake by the roots using the concepts of cohesion, transpirational pull, capillarity and root pressure. German dominance {{in the field of}} physiology was underlined by the publication of the definitive textbook on plant physiology synthesising the work of this period, Sach's e of 1882. There were, however, some advances elsewhere such as the early exploration of geotropism (the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>gravity</b> on growth) by Englishman Thomas Knight, and the discovery and naming of osmosis by Frenchman Henri Dutrochet (1776–1847).|$|E
5|$|Besides gyres, {{there are}} {{temporary}} surface currents that occur under specific conditions. When waves meet a shore at an angle, a longshore current is created as water is pushed along {{parallel to the}} coastline. The water swirls up onto the beach {{at right angles to}} the approaching waves but drains away straight down the slope under the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>gravity.</b> The larger the breaking waves, the longer the beach, and the more oblique the wave's approach, the stronger the longshore current is. These currents can shift great volumes of sand or pebbles, create spits, and make beaches disappear and water channels silt up. A rip current can occur when water piles up near the shore from advancing waves and is funnelled out to sea through a channel in the seabed. It may occur at a gap in a sandbar or near a man-made structure such as a groyne. These strong currents can have a velocity of , can form at different places at different stages of the tide, and can carry away unwary swimmers. Temporary upwelling currents occur when the wind pushes water away from the land and deeper water rises to replace it. This cold water is often rich in nutrients and creates blooms of phytoplankton and a great increase in the productivity of the sea.|$|E

A special sight for this gun was installed in the pilot's cockpit. This armament would be aimed by the pilot from a position below the aircraft attacked, {{in the manner of}} the Schräge Musik installation used by the Germans during WWII. However, the concept was based on the theory of no allowance sighting, which sought to install the gun at an angle at which the body lift of the projectile, due to the forward motion of the aircraft, would compensate for the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>gravity,</b> straightening the trajectory. The first firing trials resulted in several broken wing ribs, and a special rubber-spring shield was developed to protect the upper wing.|$|E
25|$|Although paraboloids are {{difficult}} to make from flat sheets of solid material, they can be made quite simply by rotating open-topped containers which hold liquids. The top surface of a liquid which is being rotated at constant speed around a vertical axis naturally {{takes the form of}} a paraboloid. Centrifugal force causes material to move outward from the axis of rotation until a deep enough depression is formed in the surface for the force to be balanced by the levelling <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>gravity.</b> It turns out that the depression is an exact paraboloid. (See Liquid mirror telescope.) If the material solidifies while it is rotating, the paraboloidal shape is maintained after the rotation stops, and can be used to make a reflector. This rotation technique is sometimes used to make paraboloidal mirrors for astronomical telescopes, and has also been used for solar cookers. Devices for constructing such paraboloids are known as rotating furnaces.|$|E

500|$|A {{combination}} of the rainfall and geology leads to an estimated average daily runoff from springs and boreholes of some 330,000m3 (72million imperial gallons). Bristol Waterworks Company (now Bristol Water) recognised {{the value of this}} resource and between 1846 and 1853 created a series of underground tunnels, pipes, and aqueducts called the [...] "Line of Works", which still carry approximately 18,200m3 (4million imperial gallons) of water a day to Barrow Gurney Reservoirs for filtration and then on to Bristol and the surrounding areas. This collection and conveyance of water from the Chewton Mendip and East and West Harptree areas is accomplished by the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>gravity</b> on the runoff. Water from the Mendips is also collected in Cheddar Reservoir, which was constructed in the 1930s and takes water from the springs in Cheddar Gorge.|$|E

2500|$|Another simple type {{of stress}} {{occurs when the}} {{material}} body is under equal compression or tension in all directions. [...] This is the case, for example, in a portion of liquid or gas at rest, whether enclosed in some container {{or as part of}} a larger mass of fluid; or inside a cube of elastic material that is being pressed or pulled on all six faces by equal perpendicular forces — provided, in both cases, that the material is homogeneous, without built-in stress, and that the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>gravity</b> and other external forces can be neglected.|$|E
2500|$|The strong {{equivalence}} principle suggests that gravity is entirely geometrical by nature (that is, the [...] metric alone determines the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>gravity)</b> {{and does not}} have any extra fields associated with it. If an observer measures a patch of space to be flat, then the strong {{equivalence principle}} suggests that it is absolutely equivalent to any other patch of flat space elsewhere in the universe. Einstein's theory of general relativity (including the cosmological constant) is thought to be the only theory of gravity that satisfies the strong equivalence principle. A number of alternative theories, such as Brans–Dicke theory, satisfy only the Einstein equivalence principle.|$|E
2500|$|As {{shown by}} Laplace, another {{possible}} Le Sage effect is orbital aberration due to finite speed of gravity. [...] Unless the Le Sage particles are moving at speeds {{much greater than}} the speed of light, as Le Sage and Kelvin supposed, there is a time delay in the interactions between bodies (the transit time). [...] In the case of orbital motion this results in each body reacting to a retarded position of the other, which creates a leading force component. [...] Contrary to the drag effect, this component will act to accelerate both objects away from each other. [...] In order to maintain stable orbits, the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>gravity</b> must either propagate much faster than the speed of light or must not be a purely central force. This has been suggested by many as a conclusive disproof of any Le Sage type of theory. In contrast, general relativity is consistent with the lack of appreciable aberration identified by Laplace, because even though gravity propagates {{at the speed of light}} in general relativity, the expected aberration is almost exactly cancelled by velocity-dependent terms in the interaction.|$|E

2500|$|More recently, Michell {{has become}} known for his letter to Cavendish, {{published}} in 1784, [...] on the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>gravity</b> on light. This paper was rediscovered in the 1970s and is now recognised as anticipating several astronomical ideas that had been considered to be 20th century innovations. Michell is now credited with being the first to study {{the case of a}} heavenly object massive enough to prevent light from escaping (the concept of escape velocity was well known at the time). Such an object, which he called a dark star, would not be directly visible, but could be identified by the motions of a companion star if {{it was part of a}} binary system. The classical minimum radius for escape assuming light behaved like particles of matter is numerically equal to the Schwarzschild Radius in general relativity. [...] Michell also suggested using a prism to measure what is now known as gravitational redshift, the gravitational weakening of starlight due to the surface gravity of the source. Michell acknowledged that some of these ideas were not technically practical at the time, but wrote that he hoped they would be useful to future generations. By the time that Michell's paper was rediscovered nearly two centuries later, these ideas had been reinvented by others.|$|E
