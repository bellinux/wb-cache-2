A negative cutter had butchered his film, not leaving enough negative frames to allow for hot splicing. One of her film professors asked Schoonmaker to help Scorsese; a close working relationship with him unfolded over the next thirty-five years. Schoonmaker edited Scorsese's first feature film, Who's That Knocking at My Door (1967).|$|E
25|$|Scorsese {{attended}} New York University's Tisch School of the Arts (B.A., English, 1964; M.F.A., film, 1966) {{making the}} short films What's a Nice Girl Like You Doing <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>Place</b> <b>Like</b> This? (1963) and It's Not Just You, Murray! (1964). His most famous {{short of the}} period is the darkly comic The Big Shave (1967), which features Peter Bernuth. The film is an indictment of America's involvement in Vietnam, suggested by its alternative title Viet '67. Scorsese has mentioned on several occasions that he was greatly inspired in his early days at New York University by his Armenian American film professor Haig P. Manoogian.|$|E
25|$|Emma, Mary Margaret, David, Regina, Mr. Gold, and Hook {{arrive in}} Neverland via the portal from the magic bean. Gold admonishes Emma {{for not having}} enough belief, which is {{essential}} to have <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>like</b> Neverland, and leaves the party to search for Henry on the island himself. Emma holds Mary Margaret and David accountable for what has happened, believing that she should never have broken the curse and simply left Storybrooke with Henry. Hook commiserates with her {{over the loss of}} Neal, but their mourning is interrupted by an attack on the Jolly Roger by mermaids. Mary Margaret and Emma catch one in a net, while Regina drives the others away with fire. The makeshift crew argues among themselves {{about what to do with}} the mermaid, who summons a storm with a conch shell. The storm continues to worsen, and Regina turns the mermaid into a wooden statue. Further arguing makes Mary Margaret finally release her years of rage against Regina and the two begin assaulting each other, prompting David to attempt to break it up and get drawn into a brawl with Hook. Emma realizes that their strife is causing the storm, echoing the mermaid's warning that they would kill themselves. In order to force them to cooperate, she dives overboard and is struck by a pulley that has fallen from the ship's rigging. The plan works as everyone puts aside their differences to help David get into the water to rescue her. The storm clears up and the Jolly Roger is able to approach the island. Despite Hook's earlier plan of making their way around the island and catching the Lost Boys by surprise, Emma elects to lead the crew on a direct assault route, declaring that they must believe in each other in order for them to succeed in Neverland.|$|E

500|$|The celebratory mood {{continued}} into the next preseason, when Adams sent the team for two weeks of training camp in Hawaii. Rymkus was upset by the distractions caused by the decision. [...] "We {{found it hard to}} think football around the palm trees", he said. [...] "A preseason camp has to be hard, and you have to work hard. You can't do it <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>like</b> Hawaii." [...] The team got off to a 1–3–1 start in 1961, and Adams fired him on October 14. Adams said the decision was [...] "based on the conclusion the material on hand has not been used to its fullest potential". Wally Lemm was given the head coaching job, but the shake-up prompted Speedie to resign. Under Lemm, the Oilers regrouped to win their second consecutive title.|$|E
500|$|The couple {{viewed the}} Loew's State {{engagement}} in 1937 as Skelton's big chance. They hired New York comedy writers to prepare {{material for the}} engagement, believing they needed more sophisticated jokes and skits than the routines Skelton normally performed. However, his New York audience did not laugh or applaud until Skelton abandoned the newly written material and began performing the [...] "Doughnut Dunkers" [...] and his older routines. The doughnut-dunking routine also helped Skelton rise to celebrity status. In 1937, while he was entertaining at the Capitol Theater in Washington, D.C., President Franklin D. Roosevelt invited Skelton to perform at a White House luncheon. During one of the official toasts, Skelton grabbed Roosevelt's glass, saying, [...] "Careful what you drink, Mr. President. [...] I got rolled <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>like</b> this once." [...] His humor appealed to FDR and Skelton became the master of ceremonies for Roosevelt's official birthday celebration for many years afterward.|$|E

2500|$|The {{design of}} the tower {{received}} {{a fair share of}} criticism.

2500|$|The Jubilee was {{culturally}} {{significant for}} giving millions of {{urban and suburban}} American viewers their first regular exposure to country music.

Nowadays, television takes us everywhere, and country music records and sheet music sell as well in large cities as anywhere else."

2500|$|Truman State University {{physicist}} Taner Edis, who {{was born}} in Turkey, says the secret to BAV's success is the huge popularity of the Harun Yahya books. [...] "They're fairly lavishly produced, on good-quality paper with full-color illustrations all over the place," [...] he says. [...] "They're trying to compete with any sort of science publication you can find in the Western world. And <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>like</b> Turkey, Yahya books look considerably better-published than most scientific publications." [...] Many of his books have been made into high-resolution videos which are freely downloadable on the Internet.|$|E
2500|$|Walden Twos {{title is}} a direct {{reference}} to Henry David Thoreau's book Walden. In the novel, the Walden Community is mentioned as having the benefits of living <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>like</b> Thoreau's Walden, but [...] "with company". It is, as the book says, 'Walden for two' - meaning a place for achieving personal self-actualization, but within a vibrant community, {{rather than in a}} place of solitude. Originally, Skinner indicated that he wanted to title it The Sun is but a Morning Star, a quote of the last sentence of Thoreau's Walden, but the publishers suggested the current title as an alternative.|$|E

Patton used {{to own a}} home in Bologna and speaks Italian. Regarding his close association with Italy, Patton stated, [...] "It happened after I got married. I married an Italian lady, and I had to get acquainted. Basically, it started with the language because her family and her parents didn't really speak English. I had to learn the language, so I did that. The longer you spend <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>like</b> that, it really sucks you in.

When Emma sees her mother torched by a fireball (something that would only happen <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>like</b> the Enchanted Forest), she realizes {{for the first time}} what she’d be giving up by moving to New York. It’s a crazy family, to be sure, but it’s hers, and the finale ends with Emma, who still thought of herself as an orphan as recently as Neverland, finally finding a home." ...|$|E
2500|$|Country music gained {{national}} television exposure through Ozark Jubilee on ABC-TV and radio from 1955 to 1960 from Springfield, Missouri.

As Webb Pierce put it in 1956, [...] "Once upon a time, {{it was almost impossible}} to sell country music <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>like</b> New York City. Nowadays, television takes us everywhere, and country music records and sheet music sell as well in large cities as anywhere else." [...] The late 1950s saw the emergence of Buddy Holly, {{but by the end of}} the decade, backlash as well as traditional artists such as Ray Price, Marty Robbins, and Johnny Horton began to shift the industry away from the rock n' roll influences of the mid-1950s.|$|E

Both of the Macnee/Leslie UK paperback titles were translated and published in Portugal in 1967 as 'Os Vingadores: O Dia Depois De Amanha' (deadline) and 'Os Vingadores: O Pato Morto' (dead duck) by Deaga. All four UK John Garforth Panther book paperbacks were translated and published by Roman in France (1967), a paperback omnibus edition was published in 1998 by Fleuve Noir. Three of the Garforth paperbacks were also translated and published by Heyne in Germany (1967/68) ('Heil Harris!' was not translated for obvious reasons.) and a German hardback omnibus edition of the three titles was published by Lichtenberg (1968), reprinted in paperback by Heyne in 1998.
