A typical radiation therapy room made of ordinary concrete was simulated using MCNPX Monte Carlo code. Gantry rotation was simulated at eight different angles around the isocenter.

The ratios of the maximum to the minimum values for neutron and capture <b>gamma</b> <b>dose</b> equivalents were 1. 9 and 1. 4, respectively.

40|$|International audienceTerrestrial <b>gamma</b> <b>dose</b> rates show {{important}} spatial {{variations in}} France. Previous studies resulted in maps of arithmetic means of indoor terrestrial <b>gamma</b> <b>dose</b> rates by “departement” (French district). However, numerous areas {{could not be}} characterized {{due to the lack}} of data. The aim of our work was to obtain more precise estimates of the spatial variability of indoor terrestrial <b>gamma</b> <b>dose</b> rates in France by using a more recent and complete data base and geostatistics. The study was based on the exploitation of 97 595 measurements results distributed in 17 404 locations covering all of France. Measurements were done by the Institute for Radioprotection and Nuclear Safety (IRSN) using RPL (Radio Photo Luminescent) dosimeters, exposed during several months between years 2011 and 2012 in French dentist surgeries and veterinary clinics. The data used came from dosimeters which were not exposed to anthropic sources. After removing the cosmic rays contribution in order to study only the telluric gamma radiation, it was decided to work with the arithmetic means of the time-series measurements, weighted by the time-exposure of the dosimeters, for each location. The values varied between 13 and 349 nSv/h, with an arithmetic mean of 76 nSv/h. The observed statistical distribution of the <b>gamma</b> <b>dose</b> rates was skewed to the right. Firstly, ordinary kriging was performed in order to predict the <b>gamma</b> <b>dose</b> rate on cells of 1 * 1 km 2, all over the domain. The second step of the study was to use an auxiliary variable in estimates. The IRSN achieved in 2010 a classification of the French geological formations, characterizing their uranium potential on the bases of geology and local measurement results of rocks uranium content. This information is georeferenced in a map at the scale 1 : 1 000 000. The geological uranium potential (GUP) was classified in 5 qualitative categories. As telluric gamma rays mostly come from the progenies of the 238 Uranium series present in rocks, this information, which is exhaustive throughout France, could help in estimating the telluric <b>gamma</b> <b>dose</b> rates. Such an approach is possible using multivariate geostatistics and cokriging. Multi-collocated cokriging has been performed on 1 * 1 km 2 cells over the domain. This model used <b>gamma</b> <b>dose</b> rate measurement results and GUP classes.

Conclusion The average outdoor <b>gamma</b> <b>dose</b> rate for Guilan determined in this study is significantly higher in comparison with values reported by UNSCEAR 2000 from different countries with the mean of 59 nSv although in comparison with many provinces of Iran, it is lower...|$|R
40|$|In densely {{populated}} {{cities such as}} Hong Kong where people {{live and work in}} high-rise buildings that are all built with concrete, the indoor <b>gamma</b> <b>dose</b> rate and indoor radon concentration are not wide ranging. Indoor <b>gamma</b> <b>dose</b> rates (including cosmic rays) follow a normal distribution with an arithmetic mean of 0. 22 ± 0. 04 μGy h- 1, whereas indoor radon concentrations follow a log-normal distribution with geometric means of 48 ± 2 Bq m- 3 and 90 ± 2 Bq m- 3 for the two main categories of buildings: residential and nonresidential. Since different occupations result in different occupancy in different categories of buildings, the annual total dose [indoor and outdoor radon effective dose + indoor and outdoor <b>gamma</b> absorbed <b>dose</b> (including cosmic ray) ] to the population in Hong Kong was estimated {{based on the number of}} people for each occupation; the occupancy of each occupation; indoor radon concentration distribution and indoor <b>gamma</b> <b>dose</b> rate distribution for each category of buildings; outdoor radon concentration and <b>gamma</b> <b>dose</b> rate; and indoor and outdoor cosmic ray dose rates. The result shows that the annual doses for every occupation follow a log-normal distribution. This is expected since the total dose is dominated by radon effective dose, which has a log-normal distribution. The annual dose to the population of Hong Kong is characterized by a log-normal distribution with a geometric mean of 2. 4 mSv and a geometric standard deviation of 1. 3 mSv. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{thermoluminescence}} (TL) {{properties of}} raw and annealed feldspar {{have been studied}} for their use in gamma dosimetry. The raw gamma exposed feldspar shows glow peaks at 120 °C and 319 °C. <b>Gamma</b> <b>dose</b> beyond 500 cGy can be measured without any significant fading even after 40 days of termination of expo-sure. The annealed feldspar shows a glow peak at 120 °C after gamma exposure. This peak {{can be used to}} measure <b>gamma</b> <b>doses</b> beyond 25 cGy when the TL is measured after 24 h from termination of exposure...|$|R
40|$|For {{safeguards}} measurements IAEA employs different detectors in high radiation environments. Therefore {{the sensitivity}} of silicon detectors was measured {{in a wide range}} of <b>gamma</b> <b>dose</b> rates. Saturation was observed only at dose rates clear above 250 Gy/h. For neutron measurements He- 3 detectors were characterized with regard to their neutron counting efficiency in intense mixed fields of neutron and gamma radiation. The absolute and relative neutron counting efficiency was determined. A complete separation of the neutron signals is possible up to <b>gamma</b> <b>dose</b> rates of 1. 3 Gy/h...|$|R
30|$|The {{challenge}} in adopting the TOT technique with plastic scintillators {{is due to}} the partial deposition of energy by <b>incident</b> <b>gamma</b> as they interact predominantly via Compton scattering. However, implementing the Multi-Voltage-Threshold (MVT) and probing the signal at four different thresholds help greatly in improving the energy loss resolution [5] of tomograph. In order to determine the relationship between TOT and energy loss, the data was collected using 22 Na source placed at the center of tomograph surrounded by porous material. The geometrical acceptance of J-PET offers the possibility to study the scattering of <b>incident</b> <b>gamma.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{environmental}} effective gamma-dose {{rate has}} been determined at the Mexican Storage Centre for Radioactive Waste (SCRW) and surrounding communities. Soil samples were analysed for 226 Ra, 235 U, 137 Cs and 40 K concentration activities. The outdoor effective <b>gamma</b> <b>dose</b> rate was higher at the SCRW where industrial radioactive sources and uranium ore piles were stored in the past. Some nearby locations, where {{the action of the}} rain on the piles promoted the transport and surface migration of 226 Ra, 235 U and 137 Cs, also showed an increased <b>gamma</b> <b>dose</b> rate. The <b>gamma</b> <b>dose</b> rate at distant communities (local background) was evaluated with data obtained along 10 years measurements. The additional effective external dose for the general public at the 200 m neighbouring zone of the site, was two times higher than that from the local background. The outdoor average external effective dose for workers due to the SCRW operation was 20 times than for the local background...|$|R
