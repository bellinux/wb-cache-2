5|$|As the {{libel suit}} against Marshall dragged on in Mercer County Circuit Court, Innes {{and his allies}} hired author William Littell to publish Innes' version of his {{interactions}} with Spain. Marshall countered by publishing his History of Kentucky in 1812. Although blatantly partisan, it became the most popular history of Kentucky at the time. When Street returned to Kentucky to give a deposition in the case in 1814, Innes swore out a writ against him to collect the <b>damages</b> <b>awarded</b> in his case against Street. Unable to pay, Street was imprisoned.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, Nine Inch Nails was {{involved}} in a much-publicized feud with TVT Records, the first record label to sign the band. Reznor objected to the label's attempted interference with his intellectual property. Ultimately, they entered into a joint venture with Interscope Records in which Reznor forfeited a portion of his publishing rights to TVT Music in exchange for the freedom of having his own Nothing Records imprint. In 2005, Reznor sued his former friend and manager John Malm, co-founder of Nothing, for fraud, breach of contract and fiduciary duty, and other claims. Their relationship was formally severed in a New York courtroom, with <b>damages</b> <b>awarded</b> to Reznor in excess of $3 million.|$|E
5|$|During the campaign, Bevin {{criticized the}} Affordable Care Act {{and called for}} {{repealing}} it in its entirety. His proposed alternatives included allowing insurance providers to compete across state lines, capping <b>damages</b> <b>awarded</b> for pain and suffering, allowing individuals to purchase health insurance with pre-tax earnings, and providing federal block grants to states {{to allow them to}} cover individuals with pre-existing conditions. He opposed tax increases and the allocation of federal earmarks. He called for massive spending cuts in the federal bureaucracy, specifically the Department of Education and the Veterans Administration, and for reforming eligibility requirements for entitlement programs, including raising age requirements, imposing means tests, and ending federal benefits to illegal immigrants. He opposed U.S. intervention in the Syrian Civil War and the disbursement of foreign aid to countries that deny basic freedoms to their citizens or are guilty of human rights violations. He opposed federal agribusiness subsidies and warantless federal surveillance and called for simplifying the child adoption process. Endorsed by Gun Owners of America, he pledged to resist any restrictions on the types of guns or ammunition that citizens could purchase. A supporter of congressional term limits, Bevin signed a pledge authored by the non-profit U.S. Term Limits stating that, if elected, he would co-sponsor and vote for a bill restricting individuals to three terms in the U.S. House of Representatives and two terms in the U.S. Senate.|$|E

40|$|The authors {{present the}} results of a {{comprehensive}} quantitative analysis of general <b>damages</b> <b>awards</b> issued by the Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario from 2000 to 2015. From the results, the authors argue that general <b>damages</b> <b>awards</b> continue to be too low to reflect the importance of the equality rights protected by the Ontario Human Rights Code. While many expected that general <b>damages</b> <b>awards</b> would increase as a result of amendments to the Code that took effect in 2008, the data reveals that the range of the vast majority of general <b>damages</b> <b>awards</b> has remained relatively unchanged following the legislative reforms. After adjusting for inflation, the data reveals that the range has decreased in real terms. The authors consider what steps the Ontario Human Rights Commission, the Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario, the Human Rights Legal Support Centre, the courts and the legislature might take to increase the size of general <b>damages</b> <b>awards.</b> The authors also argue that general damages need to be increased to reflect the magnitude of discriminatory harms and to promote a culture of human rights compliance...|$|R

40|$|In Exxon Shipping Co. v. Baker, the Supreme Court’s {{most recent}} opinion on punitive <b>damage</b> <b>awards,</b> the Court {{declared}} that the real problem with punitive <b>damage</b> <b>awards</b> is their “stark unpredictability. ” The Court abandoned all hope that common law jury instructions could produce predictable punitive <b>damage</b> <b>awards.</b> Instead, the Court suggested pegging punitive <b>damage</b> <b>awards</b> to compensatory <b>damage</b> <b>awards.</b> So far, analysis of the opinion has been minimal, likely due to the purported maritime law basis of the holding. Exxon should not be overlooked, however, as it signals a resurgence of procedural due process {{as a basis for}} challenging punitive damage awards—a type of challenge that the Court has not heard since the early 1990 s. Predictability of the amount is no different than fair notice of the likely severity of an award, which procedural due process requires. If common law jury instructions cannot produce predictable punitive <b>damage</b> <b>awards,</b> they also cannot produce awards consistent with the notice procedural due process requires. The Exxon Court’s pegging solution will not produce predictable awards (and ones that comply with procedural due process) because it relies on compensatory damages, which are inherently unpredictable. As an alternative, this Article suggests looking to restitution, a non-controversial punitive, civil remedy. Basing punitive damages on the defendant’s gain would produce predictable awards—as procedural due process requires...|$|R

25|$|NHTSA has {{produced}} models and guidance {{on the economic}} burden of traffic crashes on employers. Because public and private employers in the U.S. generally subsidize at least a portion of health insurance premium costs for employees and their dependents, employers bear some {{of the costs of}} crashes involving employees and families away from work in addition to at-work crashes. Employers are also liable for <b>damages</b> <b>awarded</b> in the courts for crashes for which employees are found to be at fault. In 1998-2000, motor vehicle crash injuries occurring on and off the job were estimated to cost employers nearly US $60 billion annually. On average, a fatality occurring on the job cost a business over $500,000 USD in direct and liability costs, and each nonfatal injury cost nearly $74,000 USDs. For on- and off-the-job crashes combined, the study estimated the cost of non-use of safety belts at more than $6 billion each year, and the cost of alcohol-related crashes at more than $9 billion each year.|$|E
25|$|Exxon {{recovered}} {{a significant portion}} of clean-up and legal expenses through insurance claims associated with the grounding of the Exxon Valdez. Also, in 1991, Exxon made a quiet, separate financial settlement of damages with a group of seafood producers known as the Seattle Seven for the disaster's effect on the Alaskan seafood industry. The agreement granted $63.75million to the Seattle Seven, but stipulated that the seafood companies would have to repay almost all of any punitive <b>damages</b> <b>awarded</b> in other civil proceedings. The $5billion in punitive damages was awarded later, and the Seattle Seven's share could have been as high as $750million if the damages award had held. Other plaintiffs have objected to this secret arrangement, and when it came to light, Judge Holland ruled that Exxon should have told the jury at the start that an agreement had already been made, so the jury would know exactly how much Exxon would have to pay.|$|E

40|$|More than 100 {{savings and}} loans are {{currently}} involved in supervisory goodwill litigation against the federal government, with total claims approach fifty billion dollars. These claims arise from {{a provision in the}} 1989 Financial Institutions Reform Recovery and Enforcement Act (FIRREA) that phased out the use of supervisory goodwill to satisfy bank capital requirements.

This paper uses a standard event-study analysis framework to estimate the abnormal returns to litigation interests issued by California Federal. Unlike equity shares in publicly-traded firms, the value of these litigation interests is determined solely by the <b>damage</b> <b>award</b> in the California Federal supervisory goodwill litigation.

40|$|The Supreme Courts {{decision}} in Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals placed federal judges {{in the role}} of gatekeepers empowered to screen out unreliable expert testimony.

We find that a sufficiently high probability of excluding biased testimony is essential for accurate <b>damages</b> <b>awards.</b> Otherwise, asymmetries in the judicial process lead to <b>damages</b> <b>awards</b> that are either insufficient or excessive relative to true damages. We explain the conditions leading to each outcome and demonstrate that excessive <b>damages</b> <b>awards</b> are more likely to occur in complex cases.
