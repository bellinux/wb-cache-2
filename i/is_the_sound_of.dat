Another legend says that the river must claim 3 lives every year in order for it to be 'pacified'. The bridge is a local accident black-spot, with 15 reported road-traffic accidents between 2008 and 2010.|$|E

The slam of Box’s dressing room door sends Cox scurrying back in, assuming it <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> someone knocking.

500|$|In The Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004), Roni Sarig felt that, strong rapping notwithstanding, the album's music [...] "suffers as the duo {{make their}} {{first attempt at}} self-producing" [...] and stated, [...] "Although ATLiens promised {{expanded}} vistas with its interstellar motif, the record delivered something of a sophomore slump... At best, ATLiens <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> an ambitious group searching for its voice." ...|$|E

500|$|Loaded's second album, Sick, was {{released}} on March 20, 2009 in Europe and April 7 in the US, peaking at number 43 on the Billboard Top Heatseekers chart. Sick sold 1,400 copies in the first week, while [...] "Flatline" [...] {{was chosen as the}} first single to go to radio. The album received generally positive reviews, with Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic stating [...] "Loaded <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> a working band working and an old rocker staying sober, kicking out some lead-heavy grooves and sculptured pieces of sleaze." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Rolling Stone, [...] "like Rock 'n' Roll, John Lennon's 1975 {{album of}} primal rock gems, Kisses on the Bottom <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> a {{musician}} joyfully tapping his roots; and like his former song writing partner, McCartney is better transforming influences than mirroring them. But it's fun, and touching, {{to hear him}} crooning {{his way through the}} great American songbook." [...] In a review of the album for BBC Music, writer Patrick Humphries referred to the collection as [...] "an album of neglected dishes from the great banquet of American popular music", before concluding that [...] "what McCartney accomplishes here, in the best possible sense, is an album ideally made for Easy Listening".|$|E
500|$|... "Listening to The Basement Tapes now, {{it seems}} to be the {{beginning}} of what is called Americana or alt.country," [...] wrote Billy Bragg. [...] "The thing about alt.country which makes it 'alt' is that it is not polished. It is not rehearsed or slick. Neither are The Basement Tapes. Remember that The Basement Tapes holds a certain cultural weight which is timeless—and the best Americana does that as well." [...] The songs' influence has been detected by critics in many subsequent acts. Stuart Bailie wrote, [...] "If rock'n'roll <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> a party in session, The Basement Tapes were the morning after: bleary, and a bit rueful but dashed with emotional potency. Countless acts—Mercury Rev, Cowboy Junkies, Wilco, The Waterboys—have since tried to get back to that place." ...|$|E

500|$|Bells were a {{theme of}} {{the opening day of}} the Olympics, {{starting}} at 8.12am with artist Martin Creed's , when bells were rung across the UK including forty strikes of Big Ben. [...] "The sound of bells <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> England", Boyle had told volunteers during rehearsal. Much of the music for the ceremony contained 'bell' references, linking to the large bell forged for the ceremony and evoking bells as [...] "the sound of freedom and peace". [...] Modified sequences based on the traditional British eight-bell peal underlaid [...] "And I Will Kiss" [...] and carried through into the [...] "Tubular Bells"/NHS section, with handbells and a tolling large bell featured on 'Caliban's Dream' and at key points in the ceremony. A handbell chime also played after the close, as the stadium emptied.|$|E
500|$|The {{critical}} reception to {{the record}} {{was the best of}} the band's career, with five-star reviews from State.ie, Mail on Sunday, the Star and Heinekenmusic.ie, and 4.5 stars from Entertainment.ie, and 4 stars from Hotpress, Irish Times, Irish Independent, Sunday Times, Metro, RTÉ guide, Goldenplec.ie and many more. It was described by entertainment.ie: “Little Sparks is not only an album which is Delorentos’ best work to date, but one of the finest Irish releases of recent times" [...] and by the Irish Times as [...] "Full of brave, bracing and emotionally direct songs, it’s the sound of a band who have found their musical and lyrical groove.", and by hotpress as “An early bid for Irish album of the year… Little sparks <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> a group striving to write the flab-free, solid-gold pop record of their lives, mission accomplished.” ...|$|E
500|$|Harry later said: [...] "The newspapers, television, theatres {{and radio}} were all run {{by people of}} a {{different}} generation who {{had no idea of}} what youngsters wanted. For decades they had manipulated and controlled them. Suddenly, there was an awareness of being young, and young people wanted their own styles and their own music, just at the time they were beginning to earn money, which gave them the spending power. Mersey Beat was their voice, it was a paper for them, crammed with photos and information about their own groups, which is why it also began to appeal to youngsters throughout Britain as its coverage extended to other areas." [...] Because of the employment situation in Liverpool at the time, The Daily Worker newspaper denounced the enthusiasm of younger people in Liverpool by saying [...] "The Mersey Sound <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> 30,000 people on the dole." ...|$|E

500|$|In November 2015, {{conductor}} Robert Ziegler, {{who worked}} with Radiohead on The King of Limbs, tweeted photos of the band recording with a string orchestra. The strings and choir sections were arranged by Greenwood and performed by the London Contemporary Orchestra with conductor Hugh Brunt; the orchestra had previously worked with Greenwood on his score for the 2012 film The Master. The strings were recorded at RAK Studios in London. Cellist Oliver Coates said: [...] "Nigel, Jonny and Thom all have this awesome relationship, and were so animated during the recording. I remember we were laying down the cello part {{at the end of}} 'Daydreaming' and Thom said, 'That's it – that <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> the record.'" [...] Greenwood had the cellists detune their cellos for the song, creating a [...] "growling" [...] sound. Additional string and choir parts were recorded but cut from the album.|$|E
500|$|... "Dual Spires" [...] is {{presented}} as an homage to Twin Peaks, and CNN writer Katie McLaughlin noted several allusions the episode makes to the series. In {{the beginning of the}} episode, there is a chocolate bunny on Shawn's desk. In Twin Peaks, Special Agent Dale Cooper (Kyle MacLachlan) delivered the famous line [...] "Diane, I'm holding in my hands a small box of chocolate bunnies." [...] Gus then asks, [...] "Since when <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> opening and closing shades so disruptive that it needs to be alleviated?" [...] The character Nadine Hurley in Twin Peaks attempted to patent her silent drape runner invention. Someone from a website by the name of UnderTheNail.com sends Shawn and Gus an e-mail that says, [...] "Who killed Paula Merral?" [...] Twin Peaks famed the catchphrase [...] "Who Killed Laura Palmer?" [...] The killer also purposely placed clues in his victims' fingernail beds. The victim's name itself is an anagram of [...] "Laura Palmer".|$|E
500|$|Jim Beaver made an {{appearance}} on [...] "Thirty-Eight Snub" [...] as Lawson, the gun vendor from the opening scene. Beaver previously starred in the HBO western drama series Deadwood along with Breaking Bad star Anna Gunn. He also previously appeared in [...] "Field Trip", a sixth season episode of The X-Files which was written by Breaking Bad creator Vince Gilligan. While Gilligan believed Beaver to be a talented actor, {{he had never met}} him during the filming of either show. The CW Network television series Supernatural, in which Beaver co-stars, was filming {{at the same time as}} [...] "Thirty-Eight Snub", so Beaver flew into Albuquerque for the Breaking Bad shoot and had only half a day to film the scenes. Mastras said he particularly enjoyed that the character tries to convince Walter to buy a gun legally because, [...] "I like the aspect that you've got this black market dealer who in an ironic way <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> morality here." ...|$|E

500|$|The album {{received}} an aggregate score of 86/100 at Metacritic, based on 12 reviews, signifying [...] "universal acclaim". Kerrang! editor James Mcmahon gave the album {{five out of}} five [...] "K"s, classing The Blackest Beautiful as a [...] "classic", praising the inclusion of producers Kit Walters and Stephen George. He wrote: [...] "What The Blackest Beautiful certainly is, though, <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> letlive. right here and right now. And right now, letlive. sound amazing. Get Down." [...] Metal Hammer writer Stephen Hill gave the album a nine out of ten, saying [...] "it's hard to pick out highlights when every track sounds so fresh, joyous and casually rule-book torching" [...] and that [...] "this {{is the kind of}} album that changes people's lives". Chris Hidden of Rock Sound also gave a nine out of ten, calling it a [...] "bold record" [...] and highlighting its fusion of [...] "staggering dynamics, brain-burrowing melodies and intelligent production".|$|E
500|$|At Stan's tenth {{birthday}} party, {{his present}} from Kyle {{is the latest}} CD from a [...] "tween wave" [...] band, but Sharon forbids Stan {{to listen to the}} CD and promptly takes it away, enraging him. After Randy argues with Sharon over the matter, he decides to sit down and listen to the CD (which, to the viewer and the adults, <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> drum beats and defecation). Randy claims to enjoy the CD, but Sharon does not believe him. As tween wave music becomes popular, Sharon and the other boys' parents forbid them from listening to any of it, and try to play for them The Police's song [...] "Every Breath You Take" [...] as an example of what they consider to be good music. To the boys and the viewer, however, it literally sounds like people defecating on the soundtrack, just as the [...] "tween wave" [...] music is presented as sounding to the adults. That night, Stan secretly listens to the confiscated music but discovers, to his confusion, that it now [...] "sounds like shit".|$|E
500|$|One of the {{simplest}} methods of assessing the heart's condition is {{to listen to it}} using a stethoscope. Typically, healthy hearts have only two audible heart sounds, called S1 and S2. The first heart sound S1, is the sound created by the closing of the atrioventricular valves during ventricular contraction and is normally described as [...] "lub". The second heart sound, S2, <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> the semilunar valves closing during ventricular diastole and is described as [...] "dub". Each sound consists of two components, reflecting the slight difference in time as the two valves close. S2 may split into two distinct sounds, either as a result of inspiration or different valvular or cardiac problems. Additional heart sounds may also be present and these give rise to gallop rhythms. A third heart sound, S3 usually indicates an increase in ventricular blood volume. A fourth heart sound S4 is referred to as an atrial gallop and is produced by the sound of blood being forced into a stiff ventricle. The combined presence of S3 and S4 give a quadruple gallop.|$|E

500|$|Blackman {{wrote the}} promotional {{piece for the}} album's press kit, and at Konietzko's request, wrote {{the first half of}} the promo as an {{insulting}} take down of the album rather than as a standard promo. The first letter of each line of the first section of the promo spelled out the phrase [...] "April Fools Day Fucker" [...] and included lines such as [...] "It's been 100 years and fifty albums for the German/American rock squad—are they running out of gas or what?" [...] and [...] "KMFDM can't suck hard enough", a quote from the track [...] "Inane". [...] The second half of the promo included phrases such as [...] "XTORT is a supersonic soundtrack" [...] and [...] "The new album <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> a band at the height of their powers." [...] Carrie Borzillo of Billboard stated KMFDM was [...] "poised to make a significant commercial breakthrough." [...] Konietzko said at the time there were no plans to tour in support of the album's release. [...] He later said this was due to the fact that the band as a touring unit had ceased to exist.|$|E
500|$|A {{number of}} reviewers found the album overly long, while others felt Feldmann {{was too much}} of an influence. Mike Damante at the Houston Chronicle said [...] "Feldmann's style is all over the record, as most tracks sound too formulaic, similar and run together. Other tracks are way too commercial, even for a band the size of blink.... California is {{ultimately}} a step back, rather a throwback." [...] David Anthony from The A.V. Club gave the album a C-, commenting, [...] "California <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> Blink-182 desperately trying to remain relevant by outsourcing its creativity. [...] is another homogenous addition to Feldmann's growing résumé. But this time he unintentionally removed the soul of pop-punk's clown princes in the process." [...] Nina Corcoran from Consequence of Sound was similarly negative: [...] "When not cranking the compression on the vocals, Feldmann ruins other songs with nonstop gimmicks: the piano interludes, the stiffened handclaps, the sappy title track." [...] Gwilym Mumford of The Guardian, focusing on the album's turbulent history regarding the departure of DeLonge, deemed the album [...] "a tired – and tiring – work." ...|$|E
500|$|Pitchfork writer Stuart Berman {{stated that}} [...] "The Hungry Saws {{temperate}} approach {{feels like the}} work of a band who are grateful for a new lease on life, but not sure exactly what to do with it," [...] noting how [...] "the record turns increasingly more restrained, as it reconciles the band's well-established soul affinities with a more pastoral presentation" [...] while praising its [...] "beautifully rendered" [...] ballads. In his review for PopMatters, Michael Keefe opined that while [...] "all of The Hungry Saw finds Tindersticks trekking through fairly familiar territory...they find new diversions along the way." [...] Writing for Record Collector, Jake Kennedy said that [...] "The Hungry Saw marks a wonderful coming of age for Tindersticks...this <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> pure rejuvenation." [...] In a less complementary review, Shannon Zimmerman of Spin found that [...] "the first half of Tindersticks' latest is a can't-miss proposition" [...] but that [...] "the disc's second half descends into a morass of half-finished, melancholic curios that mostly go nowhere slowly." [...] Uncut critic Sam Richards was similarly unimpressed, offering that [...] "Tindersticks have returned refreshed, but some of the old dissolute glamour is gone." [...] This opinion was not shared by Tiny Mix Tapes, whose reviewing writer said that [...] "ultimately, it’s another Tindersticks record, and they’re still good after all these years. It’s not an incredibly remarkable record, but when a band is this consistent for this long, it’s hard to fault it." ...|$|E
