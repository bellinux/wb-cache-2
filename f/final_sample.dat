500|$|A dance song of {{four minutes}} and twenty-two seconds in length, [...] "Since I Left You" [...] is {{primarily}} sample-based. The track features doo-wop vocal harmonies and employs various pieces of instrumentation, including organs, flutes and acoustic guitars. Its chorus, sampled from [...] "Everyday" [...] by the Main Attraction, features a woman singing about leaving her lover. The [...] "Everyday" [...] sample {{was the final}} element of [...] "Since I Left You" [...] to be added by Chater and Seltmann, and the former stated that its addition was a moment when they [...] "really succeeded in writing a pop song."

50|$|The Step 4 uses {{keys from}} Step 2 because {{we might have}} {{unbalanced}} data distribution on machines. For example, lets say k = 1, machine m1 only gets 1 item with weight 10 while machine m2 gets 2 items each with weight 100. Intuitively probability for items from m1 getting in <b>final</b> <b>sample</b> is 10/210. In Step 3, we will get 1 item from m1 as well as m2. If we recalculate keys in step 4 then the probability that item from m1 will be in <b>final</b> <b>sample</b> is 10/110 instead of required 10/210. Now observe that weighted reservoir sampling algorithm from previous section decreases max key value in priority queue as it processes more items. Therefore, items sampled from machine with larger chunk will have lower key values and thus higher chance of getting selected.|$|E

40|$|An {{investigation}} into the improvement of soil fertility of Korat soil series (Oxic Paleustults) using Khon Kaen municipal organic waste and Panicum maximum TD 58 grass was carried out at Khon Kaen University, Khon Kaen, Northeast Thailand. Municipal organic compost rates being used were 0, 12. 50, 25. 00, 37. 50, and 50. 00 tonnes/ha. The treatments consisted of organic compost alone and those {{with the growth of}} Panicum maximum TD 58 grass. The experiment was laid in a randomized complete block design with four replications. Soil analysis of the consecutive sampling periods was carried out for four times at six-month intervals. The results showed that an increase in municipal organic compost significantly increased organic matter percentages, %N, available P, and exchangeable K over the control treatment in all treated levels. However, after the second sampling period, %OM, %N, available P and exchangeable K slightly declined and became similar in all levels of organic compost added to the soil but significantly greater than the control treatment. Nevertheless, with the growth of Panicum maximum grass, soil analysis revealed that all levels of municipal organic compost added to the soil significantly increased %OM, %N, available P and exchangeable K over the control treatment. After the initial sampling period, %OM, %N, available P and exchangeable K decreased rapidly to the second sampling period and then significantly increased with time to the <b>final</b> <b>sampling</b> period in all treated levels. Municipal organic compost significantly increased soil pH value over the control treatment and later declined slowly with time to the <b>final</b> <b>sampling</b> period.

50|$|In some cases, {{several levels}} of cluster {{selection}} may be applied before the <b>final</b> <b>sample</b> elements are reached. For example, household surveys {{conducted by the}} Australian Bureau of Statistics begin by dividing metropolitan regions into 'collection districts' and selecting some of these collection districts (first stage). The selected collection districts are then divided into blocks, and blocks are chosen from within each selected collection district (second stage). Next, dwellings are listed within each selected block, {{and some of these}} dwellings are selected (third stage). This method makes it unnecessary to create a list of every dwelling in the region and necessary only for selected blocks. In remote areas, an additional stage of clustering is used, in order to reduce travel requirements.|$|E
50|$|Lee {{collected}} data across sixty Head Start classrooms in 2007 and 2008. A sample of 1,260 children ages {{three to four}} were selected as the <b>final</b> <b>sample.</b> Of these children, 446 had entered Head Start at age 3 and enrolled for a year (Group 1); 498 had been entered at age 4 and enrolled for a year (Group 2); and 316 children had been enrolled for 2 years, entering at age 3 (Group 3). Academic outcome measures in literacy, math and science were collected based on the Head Start and Early Childhood Program Observational Checklist rating on a 4-point scale (1 - not yet to 4 - excels. Family risk factor indicators (developed by the State Department of Education) included single parent, unemployed parent, teenage parent, parental loss (divorce/death), low parental school achievement, food insufficiency. Group 3 had higher literacy, math and science scores than the other groups. Children in the high-risk group had significantly lower literacy, math, and science scores {{than those who had}} three or fewer risk factors. Head Start is associated with significant gains in test scores. Head Start significantly reduces the probability that a child will repeat a grade.|$|E
5000|$|Furthermore, {{there are}} {{issues related to the}} {{taxonomy}} of insight problems. Puzzles and problems that are utilized in experiments to elicit insight may be classified in two ways. [...] "Pure" [...] insight problems are those that necessitate the use of insight, whereas [...] "hybrid" [...] insight problems are those that can be solved by other methods, such as the trial and error. As Weisberg (1996) points out, the existence of hybrid problems in insight research poses a significant threat to any evidence gleaned from studies that employ them. While the phenomenological experience of insight can help to differentiate insight-solving from non-insight solving (by asking the respondent to describe how they solved the problem, for example), the risk that non-insight solving has been mistaken for insight solving still exists. Likewise, issues surrounding the validity of insight evidence is also threatened by the characteristically small sample sizes. Experimenters may recruit an initially adequate sample size, but because of the level of difficulty inherent to insight problems, {{only a small fraction of}} any sample will successfully solve the puzzle or task given to them; placing serious limits on usable data. In the case of studies using hybrid problems, the <b>final</b> <b>sample</b> is at even greater risk of being very small by way of having to exclude whatever percentage of respondents solved their given puzzle without utilizing insight.|$|E
