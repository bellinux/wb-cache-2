5|$|Because of {{the great}} range of {{anatomical}} diversity among molluscs, many textbooks start the subject of molluscan anatomy by describing what is called an archi-mollusc, hypothetical generalized mollusc, or hypothetical ancestral mollusc (HAM) to illustrate the most common features <b>found</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> phylum.

Rice dishes are usually the main dish of Palestinian dinner, because they consist of a variety of ingredients commonly <b>found</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> Palestinian land. Rice is usually not served alone or as a side dish (see ruz ma lahma below), but rather it is incorporated within a larger dish or tabeekh (dish), that would include soups, vegetables, and meat (chicken or lamb). Meat is almost always present in Palestinian dishes.|$|E

5|$|The game's setting {{received}} positive responses. Carter {{thought that}} the verticality nature of the game's map created obstacles for players when they were traveling between places. However, he praised the interesting lore and wildlife <b>found</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> world, {{as well as the}} game's long draw distance. Harmon had similar comments, praising the game's graphics and Kyrat's culture. Harmon {{thought that the}} hilly landscape of the game's world gave players a sense of exploration, and hence made traversal enjoyable. Wilson thought, however, that the game's setting was not as compelling as the tropical setting of Far Cry 3. Nevertheless, she praised the Shangri-la section, which she thought had changed the game's landscape drastically. Matt Bertz from Game Informer praised the game's setting, which he thought was vibrant, varied and rich. Ludwig Kietzmann from Joystiq praised the content <b>found</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> world, and thought that the world itself was absorbing and interesting.|$|E
5|$|The main {{nitrogenous}} {{waste product}} is ammonia. Starfish have no distinct excretory organs; waste ammonia is removed by diffusion through the tube feet and papulae. The body fluid contains phagocytic cells, coelomocytes, {{which are also}} <b>found</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> hemal and water vascular systems. These cells engulf waste material, and eventually migrate to {{the tips of the}} papulae, where a portion of body wall is nipped off and ejected into the surrounding water. Some waste may also be excreted by the pyloric glands and voided with the faeces.|$|E
5|$|Yttrium has {{no known}} {{biological}} role, {{though it is}} found in most, if not all, organisms and tends to concentrate in the liver, kidney, spleen, lungs, and bones of humans.

Yttrium {{can be found in}} edible plants in concentrations between 20ppm and 100ppm (fresh weight), with cabbage having the largest amount.

5|$|Although little {{evidence}} of settlements {{has been found in}} the Rhondda that date between the Neolithic and Bronze Age periods, several cairns and cists have been discovered throughout the length of both valleys. The best example of a round-cairn was found at Crug yr Afan, near the summit of Graig Fawr, west of Cwmparc. The cairn consisted of an earthen mound with a surrounding ditch 28 metres in circumference and over 2 metres tall. Although most cairns discovered in the area are round, a ring cairn or cairn circle exists on Gelli Mountain. Known as the 'Rhondda Stonehenge' the cairn consists of 10 upright stones no more than 60cm in height encircling a central cist. All the cairns <b>found</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> Rhondda are located on high ground, many on ridgeways, and may have been used as waypoints.|$|E
5|$|Eliot {{began writing}} The Dry Salvages {{at the end}} of 1940 during air-raids on London, and managed to finish the poem quickly. The poem {{included}} many personal images connecting to Eliot's childhood, and emphasised the image of water and sailing as a metaphor for humanity. According to the poem, there is a connection to all of mankind within each man. If we just accept drifting upon the sea, then we will end up broken upon rocks. We are restrained by time, but the Annunciation gave mankind hope that {{it will be able to}} escape. This hope is not part of the present. What we must do is understand the patterns <b>found</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> past in order to see that there is meaning to be found. This meaning allows one to experience eternity through moments of revelation.|$|E
5|$|Observations {{during three}} flybys by Cassini on February 17, March 9, and July 14, 2005, {{revealed}} Enceladus' surface features in much greater detail than the Voyager 2 observations. The smooth plains, which Voyager 2 had observed, resolved into relatively crater-free regions filled with numerous small ridges and scarps. Numerous fractures were <b>found</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> older, cratered terrain, {{suggesting that the}} surface {{has been subjected to}} extensive deformation since the craters were formed. Some areas contain no craters, indicating major resurfacing events in the geologically recent past. There are fissures, plains, corrugated terrain and other crustal deformations. Several additional regions of young terrain were discovered in areas not well-imaged by either Voyager spacecraft, such as the bizarre terrain near the south pole. All of this indicates that Enceladus's interior may be liquid today, even though it should have been frozen long ago.|$|E
