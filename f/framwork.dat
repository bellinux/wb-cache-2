The system of Carroll and Rooth acquires subcategorization information but also lexical selection data. The system was tested on the Swedish SUC corpus consisting of approximately 80 000 words. For the experiment a context-free grammar and linguistic parameters (LP-rules and head category information) were developed in order to obtain subcategorization rules for verbs, nouns, adjectives and prepositions.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{carefully}} reexamine the various <b>framworks</b> existing {{in the field}} of relativistic thermodynamics. We scrutinize in particular the different conceptual foundations of notions like the relativistic work, heat force, moving heat and relativistic temperature. As to the latter notion we argue that, as in ordinary thermodynamics, relativistic absolute temperature should be introduced operationally via relativistic Carnot processes. We exhibit the more implicit or even hidden tacit preassumptions being made and point to a couple of gaps, errors and inconclusive statements in some of the existing literature. We show in particular that there is a wide-spread habit to draw general conclusions from the analysis of too restricted and special thermodynamic processes, e. g. processes with constant pressure, which is dangerous and sometimes leads to wrong results. Furthermore, we give a detailed analysis of the so-called zeroth law of relativistic thermodynamics {{with the help of a}} relativistic Carnot process. We rigorously show that, contrary to certain statements in the literature, thermodynamic systems at different relativistic temperatures, moving relative to each other, can thermally stably coexist provided that their respective temperatures obey a certain functional relation (given by the Lorentz factor). This implies however that their respective rest temperatures are the same. ...|$|R

Regarding the CDM, its Executive Board has reiterated that it has no mandate to investigate human rights impacts of the approved projects, but human rights concerns are at least implicit in some of the recommendations in the Report of the High-Level Panel on the CDM Policy Dialogue. As for the REDD+, human rights are present in three Guidelines applying to REDD+ projects. The mandate for the Board of the Green Climate Fund includes the establishment of two mechanisms; one to promote the input and participation of stakeholders and oneindependent redress mechanism.

Given that platform conventions are especially important for the user experience (UX) of mobile applications, the usage of a framework where the same code defines the behavior of the app in different platforms could have a negative impact in the UX. The objetive of this study is comparing the cross-platform and the native approach for being able to determine if the selected development approach has any impact on the users in terms of UX. To be able to set a base line under this subject, a study on cross-plataform frameworks was performed to select the most appropriate one from a UX point of view. In order to achieve the objetives of this work, two development teams have developed two versions of the same application; one using a framework that generates android and iOS versions automatically, and another team developing native versions of the same application. The alternative versions for each platform have been evaluated with 37 users with a combination of a laboratory usability test and a longitudinal study. The results show that differences ares minimal in the Android version, but in iOS, even if a reasonably good UX can be obtained with the usage of this framework by an UX-conscious design team, a higher level of UX can be obtained directly developing in native code...|$|R
40|$|Despite often {{superficial}} {{comparisons of}} British executive authority and American presidentialism {{over the past}} three decades, British politics has yet to develop anything approaching a sub-discipline of leadership or executive studies. Owing to the increased bifurcation of political and policy authority in Britain, whereby an increasing centralization-personalization of politics coexists with growing policy constraint, this paper argues that British politics could now benefit from incorporating theories and <b>framworks</b> developed in the American context for understanding prime ministerial power. The fragmentation of the governing environment in Britain, combined with a centralization of executive power, suggests that models of American presidential leadership can help explicate and improve our understanding of changing executive politics {{on this side of the}} Atlantic. This paper investigates the pertinence of theories of presidential leadership to Britain, arguing that the classic Neustadtian model of the 'politics of persuasion' possibly has greater resonance with British executive leadership than American owing to the more extreme polarization of presidential power in the United States. Bringing a leadership perspective to executive politics, we argue, invites scholars to pose a host of previously unexplored research questions that promise to provide a more differentiated, sophisticated and nuanced portrait of policy and political leadership in Britain than that offered by standard institutional perspectives that emphasize the strength of executive authority and thus 'black box' matters of leadership.

40|$|Design of {{targeted}} functional solid-state materials for desired applications remains a scientific challenge. To overcome this hurdle, numerous synthetic strategies have been devised. It {{has been shown}} that molecules and/or clusters with pre-selected shapes, molecular building blocks (MBBs), can be utilized as units of chemical construction toward a final structure composed of those units. Typically, in metal-organic structures metal-ligand directed assembly of the MBBs, via coordination chemistry in situ, leads to the final structure. The strength of the MBB formed and, consequently, the overall rigidity of the framework are essential in their use as porous materials for applications. Lack of rigidity, i. e. instability, will ultimately lead to the collapse of the open framework upon evacuation, resulting in inaccessible pores. This phenomenon has been demonstrated repeatedly in labile metal-organic materials (MOMs) constructed via flaccid metal-nitrogen coordination (MN[subscript]x) between nitrogen-based ligands and metal ions. The structures of simple metal-carboxylate clusters are welldocumented, but only recently have they been targeted for the construction of MOMs. They often possess multiple metal-oxygen coordination bonds (M(CO 2) [subscript]x) that result in the generation of rigid nodes with fixed geometry. Our research group has utilized heterofunctional organic linkers, taking advantage of both pyridine- and carboxylate-based functions (MN[subscript]y(CO 2) [subscript]z), which has allowed the construction of single-metal-ion-based MBBs resulting in stabile, rigid MOMs with targeted topologies. In this dissertation, I will discuss our single-metal-ion-based design strategy and the utilization of heterofunctional ligands for MN[subscript]y(CO 2) [subscript]z coordination of single-metal ions. I have employed this strategy to specifically target threeconnected MOMs from 3, 5 -pyridinedicarboxylate and MN[subscript]y(CO 2) [subscript]z coordination of various single-metal ions, especially chiral <b>framworks</b> such as (10, 3) -a. In addition, I have explored the MOM diversity that can be obtained via various ligand modifications, including isomerism, expansion, and functionalization. I also will show that other heterofunctional ligands can be utilized to target novel MOMs, specifically via M(CO) [subscript]y(CO 2) [subscript]z coordination, and, resultantly, I have achieved metal-ligand directed organic synthesis and mixed-metal MOMs with magnetic tunability. I have also explored applications for MOMs, including H 2 storage, and studied the barriers to rotation of the H 2 molecules inside MOMs using inelastic neutron scattering to better understand the MOM-H 2 interactions...|$|R
