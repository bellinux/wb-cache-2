40|$|Previous {{researchers}} have identified {{significant differences between}} laboratory and road cycling performances. To establish the ecological validity of laboratory time-trial cycling performances, the causes of such differences should be understood. Hence, {{the purpose of the}} present study was to quantify differences between laboratory- and road-based time-trial cycling and to establish to what extent body size [mass (m) and height (h) ] may help to explain such differences. Twenty-three male competitive, but non-elite, cyclists completed two 25 mile time-trials, one in the laboratory using an air-braked ergometer (Kingcycle) and the other outdoors on a local road course over relatively flat terrain. Although laboratory speed was a reasonably strong predictor of road speed (R 2 69. 3 %), a significant 4 % difference (P 5 0. 001) in cycling speed was identified (laboratory vs. road speed: 40. 4 + 3. 02 vs. 38. 7 + 3. 55 <b>km</b> <b>h</b> 71; mean + s). When linear regression was used to predict these differences (Diff) in cycling speeds, the following equation was obtained: Diff (<b>km</b> <b>h</b> 71) 24. 97 0. 0969 m 710. 7 h, R 2 52. 1 % and the standard deviation of residuals about the fitted regression line 1. 428 (<b>km</b> <b>h</b> 71).

40|$|This study {{investigated}} physiological and psychological correlates {{of the positive}} and negative components of a systems model in a well-trained male middle-distance runner. In the systems model, performance at any given point in time is seen as the difference between two antagonistic components, fitness and fatigue, which represent {{the positive and negative}} adaptation to training, respectively. Each component comprises a set of parameters unique to the individual, which were estimated by fitting model-predicted performance to performance measured weekly throughout a 12 -week training period. The model fitness component was correlated with extrapolated VO 2 max (ml. kg 1. min 1), running economy (RE) (VO 2 at 17 <b>km.</b> <b>h</b> 1), and running <b>speed</b> (<b>km.</b> <b>h</b> 1) at ventilatory threshold (VTRS). The model fatigue component was correlated with the fatigue subset of the profile of mood states (POMS). The fit between model and actual performance was signifi- cant (r 2 = 0. 92, P< 0. 01). In the case of fitness, both VTRS (r= 0. 94, P= 0. 0001) and RE (r= 0. 61, P= 0. 04) were significantly correlated with the model fitness component.

40|$|Many {{researches}} in {{the world}} deal with driving {{on the road to}} ensure optimum safety. In this context, several telecommunication technologies are often used to connect the vehicles via continuous wireless communication with the infrastructure, exchange data and information relevant to increase overall road safety and enable cooperative traffic management. These systems are not reliable for all situations and the difficulties encountered by the drivers. We have been proposed the Multi-band Orthogonal Frequency- Division Multiplexing system based on Ultra Wide Band (MB-OFDM UWB) as a good candidate to insure a Vehicle to Infrastructure (V 2 I) communication with high data rate and good performances in terms of Bit Error Rate (BER). However, Inter-Carrier Interference (ICI) resulting from Doppler shift phenomenon degrades MB-OFDM UWB system performance and raises a significant challenge in wireless mobile environment. In this study, V 2 I communication based on the MB-OFDM UWB technology is studied and analyzed for 200 Mbit/s, over multipath channel using the IEEE 802. 15. 4 a channel model with Doppler shift for different speeds. The theoretical formulas of BER in Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) and Rayleigh channels are calculated and are compared to the simulation results in MB-OFDM UWB system. The comparison shows that simulation results are consistent with theoretical formulas. The degradation in the performance of the proposed system solution becomes worse with a high <b>speed</b> 250 <b>Km</b> <b>h</b> - 1, so itâs necessary to use new receiver solutions.

Species that rely heavily on walking often have high capacities for aerobic metabolism relative to species that rely primarily on saltation. We tested the hypothesis of co-adaptation of gait and aerobic metabolism by investigating the locomotor energetics of Bufo boreas halophilus, a toad that walks, but does not hop. Rates of oxygen consumption during locomotion were measured in an enclosed variable-speed treadmill. The steady-state rate of oxygen consumption (V˙O•ss) increased linearly within a range of sustainable speeds [V˙O•ss (ml O 2 g 21 h 21) = 0. 93 3 <b>speed</b> (<b>km</b> <b>h</b> 21) + 0. 28]. The minimum cost of transport, Cmin (the slope of this relationship), varied significantly among individual toads. When expressed in units of oxygen consumed per distance travelled (ml O 2 km 21), Cmin scaled isometrically with body mass: Cmin = 0. 69 mass 1. 07. Consequently, mass-specific Cmin (ml O 2 g 21 km 21) was uncorrelated with body mass. Variation in Cmin was also unrelated to experimental temperature. Mass-specific Cmin estimates were similar to previous allometric predictions for terrestrial animals of similar size, which contrasts with previous findings for another toad species. Maximum rates of oxygen consumption measured in closed, rotating respirometers were significantly higher than the maximum rates achieved on the treadmill, but lower than those measured previously in other Bufo species. Our results indicate that walking is not necessarily a costly gait for toads and that high maximum rates of oxygen consumption are not associated with reliance on walking within the genus Bufo...|$|R

The heat dissipation capacity of the head and neck, estimated from measurements made at a wind <b>speed</b> (100 <b>km</b> <b>h</b> 21) corresponding to fast flight, was 9. 8 W, or 4. 5 times the resting heat production. Since the greater part of this capacity, about 8 W, was attributable to the inner surfaces of the mouth, ram ventilation of the buccal cavity appears to be an important mechanism for increasing evaporative heat loss during flight. Accordingly, wind-assisted mouth cooling should be utilized by resting pigeons, since exposure to a slight breeze (approximately 10 <b>km</b> <b>h</b> 21) could augment their dissipating power by an amount equivalent to their resting metabolic rate.

40|$|Vehicular {{emissions}} {{are the major}} sources {{of a number of}} air pollutants including nonmethane hydrocarbons (NMHCs) in urban area. The emission composition and emission factors of NMHCs from vehicles are currently lacking in Hong Kong. In this study, speciation and emission factors of NMHCs emitted from gasoline-fuelled private cars and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) -fuelled taxis at different driving speeds were constructed using a chassis dynamometer. Large variations in the contributions of individual NMHC species to total emission were observed for different private cars at different driving speeds. The variations of individual NMHC emissions were relatively smaller for taxis due to their relatively homogeneous year of manufacture and mileages. Incomplete combustion products like ethane, ethene and propene were the major component of both types of vehicles, while unburned fuel component was also abundant in the exhausts of private cars and taxis (i. e. i-pentane and toluene for private car, and propane and butanes for taxi). Emission factors of major NMHCs emitted from private cars and taxis were estimated. High emission factors of ethane, n-butane, i/n-pentanes, methylpentanes, trimethylpentanes, ethene, propene, i-butene, benzene, toluene and xylenes were found for private cars, whereas propane and i/n-butanes had the highest values for taxis. By evaluating the effect of vehicular emissions on the ozone formation potential (OFP), {{it was found that the}} contributions of olefinic and aromatic hydrocarbons to OFP were higher than that from paraffinic hydrocarbons for private car, whereas the contributions of propane and i/n-butanes were the highest for taxis.

At 1  AU, the magnetic cloud of this ICME had an average transit speed of 1910  km s− 1 and a peak magnetic field strength of 109 nT. This event has renewed interest {{in the study of}} extreme geomagnetic storms due to their potential impact on space- and ground-based technologies (Baker et al. 2013; Russell et al. 2013; Ngwira et al. 2013 a, b).

We studied the foraging movements of 14 Great Frigatebirds breeding on Aldabra Island (9. 4 S, 46. 4 E), the largest colony in the Indian Ocean. This colony {{is located at}} more than 500 km from the main fishing grounds of a very important industrial purse-seine fishery targeting surface-dwelling tunas. Despite their slow flight <b>speeds</b> (16 <b>km</b> <b>h</b> 1), frigatebirds are able to forage at more than 1000 km from the colonies when breeding, using 2500 – 4750 km long foraging loops over oceanic waters. All trips were directed {{to the north of}} the island up to the equator. Foraging bouts, indicated by reduced flight speeds, were rare and located throughout the trips. Foraging spots tended to be more frequent on higher surface chlorophyll concentration and in association with some cyclonic vortices. However, mesoscale activity is relatively weak between Aldabra and the equator and the chlorophyll variability is mostly the result of wind-mixing processes during the southwest monsoon. These results suggest that frigatebirds forage for widely distributed resources to the north of Aldabra. The northernmost foraging bouts were located in the vicinity of the purse-seine fishing grounds, but without a significant overlap between frigatebirds and tuna fleets. The results of the study are compared with those from another population at Europa Island (22. 3 S, 40. 3 E) where birds were foraging on predictable features, the edge of cyclonic eddies that are marked in the Mozambique Channel.

We investigate the propagation of high-speed chromospheric flows into coronal magnetic flux tubes and the possible production of emission in the EUV band. Methods. We simulated the propagation of a dense 104 K chromospheric jet upward along a coronal loop by means of a 2 D cylindrical MHD model that includes gravity, radiative losses, thermal conduction, and magnetic induction. The jet propagates in a complete atmosphere including the chromosphere and a tenuous cool (∼ 0. 8 MK) corona, linked through a steep transition region. In our reference model, the jet <b>initial</b> <b>speed</b> is 70 <b>km</b> s− 1, its initial density is 1011 cm− 3, and the ambient uniform magnetic field is 10 G. We also explored other values of jet speed and density in 1 D and different magnetic field values in 2 D, as well as the jet propagation in a hotter (∼ 1. 5 MK) background loop. Results. While the <b>initial</b> <b>speed</b> of the jet does not allow it to reach the loop apex, a hot shock-front develops ahead of it and travels to the other extreme of the loop. The shock front compresses the coronal plasma and heats it to about 106 K. As a result, a bright moving front becomes visible in the 171 Å channel of the SDO/AIA mission. This result generally applies to all the other explored cases, except for the propagation in the hotter loop. Conclusions.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was verify the use of {{critical}} velocity (CV) determined by three conventional models for prediction of the anaerobic threshold (AnT) in running. Thirteen Brazilian armed forces soldiers (age 24. 6 ± 6. 6 years; body mass 74. 4 ± 7. 6 Kg; and body fat 17. 8 ± 5. 2 %) participated of the study. The CV was measured through four different intensities of running accomplished until exhaustion (tlim), it pre-adjusted to occur between 2 and 10 minutes (<b>speed</b> between 15 <b>km.</b> h- 1 and 21 km. h- 1). The CV was determined by three mathematical models, two by linear relations (velocity versus inverse of time - VCVx 1 /tlim; and distance versus time relations - VCDxT) and one by hyperbolic relation (time versus velocity - VCH). The AnT was determined from incremental test on treadmill with <b>initial</b> <b>speed</b> at 7 <b>km.</b> h- 1 and increment of 1. 5 km. h- 1 at each 3 minutes until voluntary exhaustion. Immediately after each exercise stage were collect blood samples from ear lobe to measure of lactatemia. The AnT corresponded to abrupt increase of the lactate concentration response using bi-segmented linear regression (AnTBI). The three VC determinations corresponded to 13. 48 ± 0. 91 km. h- 1 (VCVx 1 /tlim), 13. 04 ± 1. 12 km. h- 1 (VCDxT) and 12. 83 ± 0. 78 km. h- 1 (VCH) and only the VCVx 1 /tlim showed statistically different of the AnTBI (12. 06 ± 1. 99 km. h- 1). However, these VC results overestimate the speedy of AnTBI in 11. 84 ± 1. 30 %, 7. 7 ± 1. 3 % and 5. 83 ± 1. 04 %, respectively. Significant correlation was not found among the three VC and the AnTBI. Thus, the CV determined by three conventional models seem not be a good tool for AnT prediction in armed forces soldiers at running...|$|R

40|$|Three {{weeks after}} the deadly Bohol {{earthquake}} of M w 7. 2, which claimed at least 222 victims, another disaster struck the Philippines. This time, Super Typhoon Haiyan, also known as Typhoon Yolanda in the Philippines, devastated the Eastern Visayas islands on 8 November 2013. Its classification as a super typhoon was based on its maximum sustained 1 min surface wind <b>speed</b> of 315 <b>km</b> <b>h</b> − 1, which is equivalent to a strong Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson scale. This {{was one of the}} deadliest typhoon events in the Philippines' history, after the 1897 and 1912 tropical cyclones. At least 6268 individuals have been reported dead and 1061 people are missing. In addition, a wide area of destruction was observed in the Eastern Visayas, on Samar and Leyte islands. The International Research Institute of Disaster Science (IRIDeS) at Tohoku University in Sendai, Japan, has deployed several teams for damage recognition, relief support and collaboration with regard to this disaster event. One of the teams, the hazard and damage evaluation team, visited the affected areas in the Eastern Visayas in mid-January 2014. In this paper, we summarize the rapid damage assessment from satellite imagery conducted days after the event and report on the inundation measurements and the damage surveyed in the field. Damage interpretation results by satellite images were qualitatively confirmed for the Tacloban city area on Leyte Island, the most populated city in the Eastern Visayas. During the survey, significant damage was observed from wind and storm surges on poorly designed housing on the east coast of Leyte Island. Damage, mainly from surface waves and winds, was observed on the east coast of Samar Island...|$|R
