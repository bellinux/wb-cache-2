6000|$|... "The last {{news from}} Paris {{has made the}} Baron anxious, as he has {{considerable}} sums in royal securities. He said to his wife: 'Listen, my friend; <b>if</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> on, I put down the carriage, I buy you a good cloak and a good parasol, {{and for the rest}} of our days we will bless the minister for ridding us of horses, lackeys, coachmen, ladies'-maids, cooks, great dinner-parties, false friends, tiresome bores, and all the other privileges of opulence.' And for my part I began to think, that for a man without a wife or child, or any of those connections that make us long for money, and never leave any superfluity, it would be almost indifferent whether he were poor or rich. This paradox comes of the equality that I discover among various conditions of life, and in the little difference that I allow, in point of happiness, between the master of the house and the hall-porter. If I am sound in mind and body, if I have worth and a pure conscience, if I know the true from the false, if I avoid evil and do good, if I feel the dignity of my being, if nothing lowers me in my own eyes, then people may call me what they will, My Lord, or Sirrah. To do what is good, to know what is true--that is what distinguishes one man from another; the rest is nothing. The duration of life is so short, its true needs are so narrow, and when we go away, it all matters so little whether we have been somebody or nobody. When the end comes, all that you want is a sorry piece of canvas and four deal boards. In the morning I hear the labourers under my window. Scarce has the day dawned before they are at work with spade and barrow, delving and wheeling. They munch a crust of black bread; they quench their thirst at the flowing stream; at noon they snatch an hour of sleep on the hard ground. They are cheerful; they sing as they work; they exchange their good broad pleasantries with one another; they shout with laughter. At sundown they go home to find their children naked round a smoke-blackened hearth, a woman hideous and dirty, and their lot is neither worse nor better than mine. I came down from my room in bad spirits; I heard talk about the public misery; I sat down to a table full of good cheer without an appetite; I had a stomach overloaded with the dainties of the day before; I grasped a stick and set out for a walk to find relief; I returned to play cards, and cheat the heavy-weighing hours. I had a friend of whom I could not hear; I was far from a woman whom I sighed for. Troubles in the country, troubles in the town, troubles everywhere. He who knows not trouble is not to be counted among the children of men. All gets paid off in time; the good by the evil, evil by good, and life is naught. Perhaps to-morrow night or Monday morning we may go to pass a day in town; so I shall see the woman for whom I sighed, and recover the man of whom I could not hear. But I shall lose them the next day; and the more I feel the happiness of being with them, the worse I shall suffer at parting. That is the way that all things go. Turn and turn and turn again; there is ever a crumpled rose-leaf to vex you."[204] ...|$|E

5000|$|... "The Show Must Go On" [...] {{is a song}} by the British {{rock band}} Queen, {{featured}} as the twelfth and final track on their 1991 album Innuendo. It is credited to Queen, but written mainly by Brian May. The song chronicles the effort of Freddie Mercury continuing to perform despite approaching {{the end of his}} life; he was dying from complications due to HIV/AIDS, although his illness had not yet been made public in spite of ongoing media speculation claiming that he was seriously ill. Mercury was so ill when the band recorded the song in 1990, that May had concerns as to whether he was physically capable of singing it. Recalling Mercury's performance, May states; [...] "I said, 'Fred, I don't know <b>if</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to be possible to sing.' And he went, 'I'll fucking do it, darling' — vodka down — and went in and killed it, completely lacerated that vocal." ...|$|E
5000|$|Gordon Murray the Formula 1 and Mclaren F1 designer, {{said when}} {{designing}} his new Murray T.25 city car:"I discovered why people didn't make {{what they call}} 'Sub A' segment cars, small city cars - you don't make any money on them. Because the tooling and development cost for a small car is almost {{the same as for}} a bigger car. So people would rather build larger cars and make more profit. That's when I started thinking, that <b>if</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to work {{there needs to be a}} new way of making the cars, that is cost effective. That high capital pressed components using low labour cost countries a long distance from developed world markets has a large environmental cost. Car manufacturers say that production emissions are small compared to tailpipe emissions, but in fact they are a very significant proportion of total emissions. We need to re-think the Henry Ford design of mass production." [...] Murray's solution is a laser cut tubular steel space-frame chassis built with an automated tube mill, braced with bonded low-cost composite sheets that would be a cheaper and greener means of production. Murray's 'iStream' simplifies each process with an eighty percent smaller factory with lower cost production, making light weight efficient cars. There are no sheet metal presses, spot welders or paint plants. It would be built local to its market. Murray is currently negotiating production licences. The T25 and T27 were expected to be available in 2016.|$|E

[...] He noted that the drop in viewers from the series premiere, which had [...] "some of the highest ratings in recent history" [...] for ABC, to the second episode was to be expected, but [...] "the fact that [...] can’t seem to hold steady in its fifth week is a sign that it may be charting troubled waters ... A rocky start is to be expected, but by this point in the season, most procedural dramas tend to have hit their pace both in structure and audience." [...] He remembered that much of the MCU films' large fanbase had been expected to watch the series and provide [...] "a healthy viewership", and how, <b>if</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to happen, [...] "enthusiasm seems to be waning" [...] among those fans now.|$|R

5000|$|The {{first game}} in the early {{learning}} software series JumpStart, JumpStart Kindergarten, was created in 1994 by independent developer Fanfare Software (founded 1988) and published by Knowledge Adventures (founded 1991). Fanfare developed two more games JumpStart Preschool and JumpStart 1st Grade before being acquired by Knowledge Adventure in August 9, 1995. Fanfare founder and chairman Barton Listick became vice president of Knowledge Adventure, while his staff relocated to Knowledge Adventure's headquarters in Glendale. Knowledge Adventure founder Bill Gross hoped the acquisition would allow the JumpStart series to expand into international markets, as well as multiple platforms, on-line, and the Internet, to supplement the home and school markets. Meanwhile, Listick was optimistic that the added resources of the larger organisation {{would allow him to}} create a [...] "JumpStart Elementary School" [...] of compelling and exciting children's software. Microtimes retrospectively wrote that the acquisition of the early learning products augmented Knowledge Adventure's strengths. In October, Steve Chadima, vice president of marketing services at Knowledge Adventure said that while JumpStart sales were strong, and the series was about to be extended with JumpStart Second Grade, he said: [...] "We're testing concepts for third grade to see if it is viable...I don't know <b>if</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to work with higher grade levels." [...] JumpStart Adventures 3rd Grade: Mystery Mountain would end up being released in 1996, and many higher grade games followed. According to Chicago Sun-Times, Knowledge Adventure [...] "started the baby trend when it introduced JumpStart Toddler in 1996". On February 3, 1997, the privately held Knowledge Adventure was acquired by CUC International, becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of the CUC Software division alongside Davidson, Blizzard Entertainment, and Sierra On-Line; CUC Software would be the label that marketed the JumpStart games. JumpStart Typing, JumpStart Spanish, JumpStart Kindergarten II, JumpStart 1st Grade Reading, JumpStart 1st Grade Math, JumpStart 2nd Grade Math and JumpStart 5th Grade were premiered at the 1997 E3.|$|E

3000|$|It’s {{possible}} {{to construct an}} ideology, and I’ve occasionally tried to, in which you combine {{the notion of the}} world as not controllable with the notion that you’re still going to act decisively. I attribute that to people like Don Quixote, but even more people to Chinese philosophy. The thread that runs through Chinese philosophy that fascinates me is the thread that says the leader should be decisive, but skeptical. They should act firmly, but not be very sure that he’s acting correctly. Westerners have great difficulty doing both of those. I used to call it optimism without hope (March 1999). You strike ahead forward, even though {{in the back of your}} head, you say, “I don’t have the vaguest idea <b>if</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to make any difference.” If you can do that, if you can combine those two, I think you’re closer to being able to survive well. Most of our training is that in order to have great action, you have to have great hopes. A lot of reasons I’m somewhat enthusiastic about that Chinese tradition is that it allows you to have great action without having great hope. “I’m going to charge, probably won’t make any difference, but that’s what I’m going to do.” [...]...|$|E
