Using the framework developed in Sutton (1991), I construct a model of supermarket competition where escalating investment in firm level distribution systems is driven by the incentive to produce a greater variety of products in every store. Employing a store level census and 51 <b>distinct</b> <b>geographic</b> <b>markets,</b> I demonstrate that the supermarket industry is a natural oligopoly in which a small number of firms (between 4 and 6) capture the majority of sales, regardless of market size. ...|$|R

Using the endogenous sunk cost (ESC) framework developed in Sutton (1991), I construct a model of supermarket competition where escalating investment in firm level distribution systems is driven by the incentive to produce a greater variety of products in every store. Using the observed networks of store and warehouse locations, I identify 51 <b>distinct</b> <b>geographic</b> <b>markets</b> covering nearly the entire United States and empirically verify their relative independence. Employing a dataset consisting of every supermarket operating in these markets, I establish the existence of a lower bound to concentration that remains strictly positive as market size expands. Furthermore, I am able to verify that this non-fragmentation result applies only to firms that have built their own distribution networks, as the model predicts. endogenous sunk costs, vertical product differentiation, oligopoly, retail, supermarkets, market concentration...|$|R
40|$|Economic Growth {{has been}} {{historically}} associated with nations that first {{made use of}} each new energy source. There {{is no doubt that}} Solar Power Satellites is high as a potential energy system for the future. A conceptual cost model of the economics value of space solar power (SSP) as a source of complementary power for in-space and ground applications will be discussed. Several financial analysis will be offered based on present and new technological innovations that may compete with or be complementary to present energy market suppliers depending on various institutional arrangements for government and the private sector in a Global Economy. Any of the systems based on fossil fuels such as coal, oil, natural gas, and synthetic fuels share the problem of being finite resources and are subject to ever-increasing cost as they grow ever more scarce with drastic increase in world population. Increasing world population and requirements from emerging underdeveloped countries will also increase overall demand. This paper would compare the future value of SSP with that of other terrestrial renewable energy in <b>distinct</b> <b>geographic</b> <b>markets</b> within the US, in developing countries, Europe, Asia, and Eastern Europe...|$|R

40|$|Competition law is an {{area which}} is going through changes over time, {{especially}} EC competition law {{in regard to the}} ongoing process of market integration. The definition of the relevant <b>geographic</b> <b>market</b> within EC competition law is of importance to define, both in case law and for undertakings and their businesses, as the law should be predictable. Before Article 82 of the EC Treaty, which prohibits abusive behaviour by undertakings, is applicable the relevant <b>geographic</b> <b>market</b> has to be defined. As is the case with the Merger Regulation, the relevant <b>geographic</b> <b>market</b> has to be defined to make an assessment of the undertakings’ activities. The definition of the <b>geographic</b> <b>market</b> is then used as a tool in the analysis of the assessment of competition and the effects of measures carried out by undertakings which restrain competition. Thus, the definition of the relevant <b>geographic</b> <b>market</b> is crucial for the purposes of Community competition law. The definition of the relevant <b>geographic</b> <b>market</b> can be said to be an area where “the objective conditions of competition applying to the product in question must be the same for all traders” as established in United Brands. In Deutsche Bahn it was clarified that “ [...] . the definition of the geographical market does not require the objective conditions of competition between traders to be perfectly homogenous”. It is enough if they are similar, therefore areas in which the objective conditions of competition are different, are not considered to be a uniform market. In the Commission Notice on the definition of relevant market for the purposes of Community competition law the Commission’s work to define the relevant <b>geographic</b> <b>market</b> is described as well as the evidence the Commission contemplates in its assessment. The substitutability test is relied on by the Commission. In case law from the European Court of Justice, the Court of First Instance, and the Commission, different factors are scrutinized to establish the relevant <b>geographic</b> <b>market.</b> Such factors are e. g., the undertakings’ activities, barriers to trade, and barriers to entry. The significance of the evidence and the factors used in the definition of the relevant <b>geographic</b> <b>market</b> are debatable. The factors considered vary on a case to case basis and they need to differ to make a correct assessment of the relevant <b>geographic</b> <b>market</b> in every case within EC competition law...|$|R

Because no standard approach to market definition exists, opposing parties in antitrust cases often disagree {{about the extent of}} the market. These differences have been particularly relevant in the hospital industry, where the courts have denied seven of eight merger challenges since 1994, due largely to disagreements over <b>geographic</b> <b>market</b> definition. We compare <b>geographic</b> <b>markets</b> produced using common ad hoc methodologies to a method that directly applies the “SSNIP test” to hospitals in California using a structural model. Our results suggest that previously employed methods overstate hospital demand elasticities by a factor of 2. 4 to 3. 4 and define larger markets than would be implied by the merger guidelines’s hypothetical monopolist test. The use of these methods in differentiated product industries may lead to mistaken <b>geographic</b> <b>market</b> delineation, and was likely a contributing factor to the permissive legal environment for hospital mergers. ...|$|R

Moreover, growth into new <b>geographic</b> <b>markets</b> {{appears to be more}} important than discovery of new export products in explaining export growth. Of particular importance is whether an exporting country succeeds in reaching more national markets that are already importing the product it makes. This <b>geographic</b> index of <b>market</b> penetration is a powerful explanatory variable of export performance. This suggests that governments should not focus solely or even primarily on the discovery channel, but also seek to identify and address market failures that are constraining exporters in subsequent phases of the export cycle.
