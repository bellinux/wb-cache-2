5|$|Iceland's {{financial}} position has steadily improved since the crash. The economic contraction and rise in unemployment {{appear to have}} been arrested by late 2010 and with growth under way in mid-2011. Three main factors have been important in this regard. First is the emergency legislation passed by the Icelandic parliament in October 2008. It served to minimise the impact of the financial crisis on the country. The Financial Supervisory Authority of Iceland used permission granted by the emergency legislation to take over the domestic operations of the three largest banks. The much larger <b>foreign</b> <b>operations</b> of the banks, however, went into receivership.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT <b>Foreign</b> <b>operation</b> modes {{and their}} use are of crucial {{importance}} to any company that operates in an international environment. The previous research on <b>foreign</b> <b>operation</b> modes has tended to view these modes from a rather simple, static perspective, which, arguably, does not necessarily reflect the reality of <b>foreign</b> <b>operation</b> mode use in many international companies. To better capture the nuances of the <b>foreign</b> <b>operation</b> mode use in contemporary international business environment, the newest research regarding <b>foreign</b> <b>operation</b> modes was reviewed in this study. It was seen that the new thinking of <b>foreign</b> <b>operation</b> modes significantly challenges the previous thinking on this field. This study offered further research on <b>foreign</b> <b>operation</b> mode topics that have been somewhat neglected in the previous research. This research provided further evidence of mode switching {{that has not been}} covered extensively in the literature previously. This study also shed some more light on mode stretching and mode combinations, which are topics that are quite novel in the field of <b>foreign</b> <b>operation</b> modes. This research did one’s bit in offering further research that has been called for by different scholars of <b>foreign</b> <b>operation</b> modes. To shed some more light on the more novel approaches to <b>foreign</b> <b>operation</b> modes, this study analyzed empirically the <b>foreign</b> <b>operation</b> mode strategies of a selected group of Finnish firms in South Korea. A special emphasis in this analysis was placed on mode switching, mode stretching and mode combination strategies. The analysis was guided by a theoretical framework that was developed in the theoretical part of this study. In the empirical analysis of the <b>foreign</b> <b>operation</b> mode strategies of a selected group of Finnish firms in South Korea, inter-mode switches turned out to be quite common. The inter-mode switches were mainly triggered by changes in the external environment of the studied case companies. Some evidence on mode combinations was received, although mode combinations did not turn out to be common among the case firms studied. Mode stretching was not common, either and intra-mode switches were very uncommon. The firms that did not change their <b>foreign</b> <b>operation</b> mode strategies mainly had their reasons in switching barriers and mode myopia. The paper was finalized with the discussion of recommendations for future research. Clearly, more research is needed on these rather underresearched aspects of <b>foreign</b> <b>operation</b> modes {{and their use}}...|$|R
40|$|Although {{the issue}} of {{switching}} costs does appear {{in some of the}} frameworks for choosing modes of <b>foreign</b> <b>operation,</b> the treatment of these costs is fairly cursory. In this article we propose a simple classification of switching costs which distinguishes between "take-down" costs and "set-up" costs. A distinction is also made between measurable and perceptual switching costs. The article outlines the assumptions regarding switching costs that are embedded in current theoretical approaches to the internationalization of firms, and discusses the possible effects of such costs on the choice and timing of <b>foreign</b> <b>operation</b> methods.
