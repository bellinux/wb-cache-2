30|$|The {{parameter}} ρ is also {{crucial for}} explaining {{the impact of}} υ (n) on both the total unpaid work (i.e. h[1 +υ (n)]) and paid work. We can distinguish three cases. If ρ < 1, {{an increase in the}} time spent rearing children per unit of <b>home</b> <b>labor</b> will raise the number of total unpaid hours worked and reduce that of paid hours. This is because the increase in the marginal cost of <b>home</b> <b>labor</b> cannot be offset with the rise in intermediate goods, given that c^x and h are close complements. Moreover, given that leisure does not depend on υ (n), the increase in υ (n) has the opposite effect on paid hours. If ρ = 1, the increase in υ (n) will have no effect on the total time devoted to unpaid labor, since households offset the rise of υ (n) with a proportional increase in intermediate goods. And if ρ > 1, a rise in υ (n) leads to a drop in the total number of unpaid hours because households substitute <b>home</b> <b>labor</b> for intermediate goods.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{deal with}} {{endogenous}} labor movements － internal and international labor movements caused by exogenous entrants of new workers － in a two-country macroeconomic model where each country has primary and secondary labor markets. To investigate the effects of new entrants into the <b>home</b> country's secondary <b>labor</b> market, we assume that internal movement occurs between primary and secondary markets in each country and international movement occurs between secondary markets of both countries due to differentials of expected real consumption wages. We show that an increase of new entrants into the <b>home</b> country's secondary <b>labor</b> market increases its full employment level, even though workers of the <b>home</b> country's secondary <b>labor</b> market are moving to a foreign country's secondary labor market and to its own primary labor market.

40|$|We {{propose a}} new {{explanation}} for differences {{and changes in}} labor supply by gender and marital status, and in particular for the increase in married women’s labor supply over time. We argue that this increase {{as well as the}} relative constancy of other groups’ hours are optimal reactions to outsourcing labor in home production becoming more attractive to households over time. To investigate this hypothesis,we incorporate heterogeneous agents into a household model of labor supply and allow agents to trade <b>home</b> <b>labor.</b> This model can generate the observed patterns in US labor supply by gender and marital status as a reaction to declining frictions on the market for home services. We provide an accounting exercise to highlight the role of alternative explanations for the rise in hours in a model where <b>home</b> <b>labor</b> is tradable.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the role of}} the doing-gender hypothesis versus traditional models of the household in explaining how the woman's share of <b>home</b> <b>labor</b> varies with relative earnings. The findings, using the 2002 - 3 Spanish Time Use Survey (STUS; Spanish Statistical Office 2003), support the doing-gender hypothesis in the case of housework: a woman's relative share of housework fails to decrease with her relative earnings beyond the point where her earnings are the same as her husband's. In contrast, a woman's share of childcare time displays a flat pattern over the distribution of her spouse's relative earnings. This last result is neither consistent with traditional theories of the household, nor with the doing-gender hypothesis. It can, however, still be interpreted in light of social norms, whereby women specialize in this type of caring activity regardless of their relative productivity or bargaining power.
