He saw her come down the aisle, with Arthur and a strange young man with a {{football}} mop of hair and eyeglasses, the sight of whom spurred him to instant apprehension and jealousy. He saw her take her seat in the orchestra circle, and little else than her did he see that night--a pair of slender white shoulders and a mass of pale gold hair, dim with distance. But there were others who saw, and now and again, glancing at those about him, he noted two young girls who looked back from the row in front, a dozen seats along, and who smiled at him with bold eyes. He had always been easy-going. It was not in his nature to give rebuff. In the old days he would have smiled back, and gone further and encouraged smiling. But now it was different. He did smile back, then looked away, and looked no more deliberately. But several times, forgetting the existence of the two girls, his eyes caught their smiles. He could not re-thumb himself in a day, nor could he violate the intrinsic kindliness of his nature; so, at such moments, he smiled at the girls in warm <b>human</b> <b>friendliness.</b> It was nothing new to him. He knew they were reaching out their woman's hands to him. But it was different now. Far down there in the orchestra circle was the one woman in all the world, so different, so terrifically different, from these two girls of his class, that he could feel for them only pity and sorrow. He had it in his heart to wish that they could possess, in some small measure, her goodness and glory. And not for the world could he hurt them because of their outreaching. He was not flattered by it; he even felt a slight shame at his lowliness that permitted it. He knew, did he belong in Ruth's class, {{that there would be no}} overtures from these girls; and with each glance of theirs he felt the fingers of his own class clutching at him to hold him down.|$|E

40|$|Many {{robotics}} tasks {{require a}} robot {{to share the}} same workspace with humans. In such settings, {{it is important that}} the robot performs in such a way that does not cause distress to humans in the workspace. In this paper, we address the problem of designing robot controllers which minimize the stress caused by the robot while performing a given task. We present a novel, data-driven algorithm which computes human-friendly trajectories. The algorithm utilizes biofeedback measurements and combines a set of geometric controllers to achieve <b>human</b> <b>friendliness.</b> We evaluate the comfort level of the human using a Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) sensor. We present results from a human tracking task, in which the robot is required to stay within a specified distance without causing high stress values. ...|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, an {{environmentally}} sound and human scale set of design principles, which values ideas like environmental <b>friendliness,</b> <b>human</b> comfort and locality, is formulated, examined and justified. These principles {{are inspired by}} experiences in Latin America and South Asia and their universal significance is illustrated through case studies from several countries around the world. In the design project, these principles are applied in a local setting, {{in this case a}} residential hall on the Ball State University campus in Muncie, Indiana. The design embraces a ‘green’ approach to campus facility renovation as part of the holistic movement to make the campus more sustainable. The design focus will be on the reuse and revitalization of materials thrown away on campus. Projects in which economic limitations enhance this specific creativity serve as role models. Through the reuse of material, the renovation process of campus facilities can be linked to the recycling program and the curriculum of the university. Department of ArchitectureThesis (M.

40|$|Abstract. Human {{interaction}} proofs (HIPs) {{have become}} common {{place on the}} internet due to their effectiveness in deterring automated abuse of online services intended for humans. However, there is a co-evolutionary arms race in progress and these proofs are becoming more difficult for genuine users while attackers are getting better at breaking existing HIPs. We studied various popular HIPs {{on the internet to}} understand their strength and <b>human</b> <b>friendliness.</b> To determine HIP strength, we adopted a direct approach of building computer attacks using image processing and machine learning techniques. To understand human-friendliness, a sequence of users studies were conducted to investigate HIP character recognition by humans under a variety of visual distortions and clutter commonly employed in reading-based HIPs. We found that many of the online HIPs are pure recognition tasks that can be easily broken using machine learning. The stronger HIPs tend to pose a combination of segmentation and recognition challenges. Further, the HIP user studies show that given correct segmentation, computers are much better at HIP character recognition than humans. In light of these results, we propose that segmentation-based reading challenges are the future for building stronger human-friendly HIPs. An example of such a segmentation-based HIP is presented with a preliminary assessment of its strength and human-friendliness. ...|$|E

Although it always competes against {{other means of}} waste heat harvesting, its advantages, such as flexibility (scalability and compactness), <b>human</b> <b>friendliness</b> (no noise and toxicity) and no moving parts (less wear), allow it {{plays an important role}} in global energy management. In order to implement thermoelectric devices in a wide utilization, material improvement based on cheap and abundant elements is essential. This PhD work focuses on the thermoelectric material ZnSb, which has the aforesaid advantages meanwhile the optimal output at moderate temperature for many of industry and transportation waste. This work was built upon an understanding of semiconductor transport. The methodological focus is on different synthesis techniques to produce nanostructured bulk material, microstructural characterization, as well as the investigation of thermoelectric transport properties. Doping was also introduced to modify the electronic structure and scattering mechanism. The property of the material was improved due to the reduced thermal conductivity by nanostructuring and the increased carrier concentrations by doping. Possible energy barrier at grain boundaries was verified. And many efforts have been made on the understanding of intrinsic defects and impurity band conduction, which led to a deeper knowledge of thermoelectrics...|$|E
40|$|In {{the coming}} {{advanced}} age society, an innovative technology {{to assist the}} {{activities of daily living}} of elderly and disabled people and the heavy work in nursing is desired. To develop such a technology, an actuator safe and friendly for human is required. It should be small, lightweight and has to provide a proper softness. We call such an actuator soft actuator. A pneumatic rubber artificial muscle is one of typical soft actuators, which is useful for the human assist technology. We have developed some types of pneumatic rubber artificial muscles and applied them to human friendly soft mechanisms and wearable power assist devices. Since these mechanism and devices directly act on the human body, the <b>human</b> <b>friendliness</b> is essentially important. A wearable power assist device is equipped to the human body to assist the muscular force, which supports activities of daily living, rehabilitation, heavy working, training and so on. In this paper, some types of rubber muscles developed and manufactured in our laboratory are introduced. A soft robot hand for wiping the human body and a parallel manipulator for the wrist rehabilitation are described as soft mechanisms. Further, a wearable power assist glove and a power assist splint for upper arm are shown. Some evaluations clarify the effectiveness of pneumatic soft actuator for an innovative human assist technology...|$|E
