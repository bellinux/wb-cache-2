50|$|Like most {{gasoline}} stoves, the Svea 123 uses {{an inverted}} bell-shaped burner {{topped with a}} flame spreader (sometimes called a “target burner” or “plate burner” design). As the vaporized fuel exits the jet, it shoots upward and strikes {{the bottom of the}} flame spreader, where it mixes with air that is drawn into the burner housing by convection and, more importantly at higher flow rates, by Bernoulli effect entrainment. The air/fuel mixture flows around the bottom of the flame spreader where it burns with a blue flame. In this type of burner design, flame efficiency depends on how fast the vaporized fuel strikes the flame spreader and on how well the air and vaporized fuel mixes beneath the flame spreader (i.e., the amount of turbulence in the air/fuel mixing zone). As a result, this design works best at high <b>fuel</b> <b>output</b> levels; efficient combustion is indicated by a blue flame. As the <b>fuel</b> <b>output</b> is decreased (i.e., when the control valve is turned down) the velocity with which the fuel exits the jet is also decreased, and fuel mixing (i.e., the amount of turbulence in the air/fuel mixing zone) is likewise decreased. At very low <b>fuel</b> <b>output</b> levels, the fuel will no longer exit with sufficient velocity to fully strike the flame spreader and combustion will consequently be very inefficient, usually indicated by a yellow flame.|$|E
