5|$|Pied currawongs are vocal birds, calling when {{in flight}} and at all times of the day. They are more noisy <b>early</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>and</b> in the evening before roosting, as well as before rain. The loud {{distinctive}} call has been translated as Kadow-Kadang or Curra-wong, akin to a croak. They also have a loud, high-pitched, wolf-like whistle, transcribed as Wheeo. The endemic Lord Howe Island subspecies has a distinct, more melodious call.|$|E
5|$|Like all Hindu Marathi {{people and}} to a varying degree with other Hindu Indians, Diwali is {{celebrate}}d over five days by the Deshastha Brahmins. Deshastha Brahmins celebrate this by waking up <b>early</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>and</b> having an Abhyangasnan. People light their houses with lamps and candles, and burst fire crackers {{over the course of}} the festival. Special sweets and savouries like Anarse, Karanjya, Chakli, Chiwda and Ladu are prepared for the festival. Colourful Rangoli drawings are made in front of the house. Marathi children make a replica mud fort in memory of Shivaji, the great Maratha king.|$|E

5|$|The group's Red Rocks {{concert was}} {{scheduled}} for 5 June 1983, but poor weather that day threatened to cancel the show. Torrential rain soaked the area, and flash flood warnings were issued. The weather {{made it difficult for}} the crew members to transport the band's gear and video equipment through the mountains to the amphitheatre. The conditions also caused many technical problems for the filming and concert crews, which hampered stage construction and endangered the safety of those setting up lighting and sound equipment. Crew members used squeegees to keep rain away from the wires, although the assistant of recording engineer Randy Ezratty still received an electrical shock while setting up a lighting truss. The fans that attended had to hike through the Rocky Mountains in the rain. Between 15 and 20 fans were already camped out in the venue's front rows <b>early</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning,</b> <b>and</b> lead singer Bono accommodated them by serving coffee and tea. The Alarm and Divinyls cancelled their opening sets for safety reasons, and many fans thought the entire concert had been cancelled. The show {{was scheduled for}} 6:00pm, and the band had until 1:00pm to decide whether to move the concert elsewhere or risk the weather worsening, which could have necessitated a cancellation.|$|E
5|$|Unlike other Novomessor species, workers forage <b>early</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>and</b> late {{afternoon}}, whereas N. cockerelli and N. albisetosus forage {{during the}} afternoon and evening. However, it is unknown {{whether or not these}} ants are active during the night. Foragers first emerge from their nests at 9 A.M. and return by 5 P.M. They are rarely seen {{during the middle of the}} day when temperatures reach 95–100°F (35–38°C), although the ground temperature is considerably higher. Workers are commonly seen foraging between 9 and 11 A.M. and 3 to 5 P.M. Most workers forage on the ground, but sometimes they can be seen walking on low herbage without feeding on the plants or collecting any seeds. Excavated nests showed no evidence that these ants collect seeds, and no workers were seen collecting them or carrying them back to the nest. N. ensifer ants are solitary foragers that work 25 ft (7 m) away from their home nest. N. ensifer predominately feeds on insects they prey on, consuming dead insects such as ichneumon wasps, bembicine wasps and small moths. When a worker discovers a dead insect, it will start to pull and carry it back to the nest immediately, and other nestmates will join once they detect it. Workers do not cooperate with each other and pull the insect from all directions, accidentally tearing it apart. However, the workers will eventually have a piece of the insect left and return it to the nest. The only known predator of N. ensifer is the giant horned lizard (Phrynosoma asio). Mites and Springtail arthropods are known to dwell inside nests, but their function or purpose within a colony is unknown.|$|E

25|$|Calling is a {{traditional}} wolf hunting method of Mongolia. The hunters go {{to the place where}} the pack is located <b>early</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>and</b> will imitate a wolf's howl.

25|$|The red Pierrot is a weak flier, and flutters about {{close to}} the ground. It flies in short bursts and settles often but not for very long. It basks with its wings half open, but prefers shade to sun, and jungle or {{undergrowth}} to open areas. It keeps on the wing almost till dark when it settles on the undersides of leaves and twigs often in company. It is sluggish <b>early</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>and</b> late in the evening.|$|E

25|$|Many {{churches in}} the American South still hold {{traditional}} sunrise services in cemeteries {{as a sign of}} recognition that Jesus no longer lay in the tomb on Easter morning. The service starts <b>early</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>and</b> is timed so that the attendants can see the sun rise when the service is going. Services usually loosely follow the format of the church's normal service and can include music (hymns or praise band), dramatic scenes and the Easter message. After the service, the church may serve a breakfast for the attendees.|$|E
25|$|Waller's {{attack was}} not unexpected, and Prince Maurice had made {{ready to meet}} him. Yet, the first rush of the rebels carried the entrenchments of Speen Hill. Speen itself, though stoutly defended, fell into their hands within an hour, Essex's {{infantry}} recapturing here some of the guns they had had to surrender at Lostwithiel. But meantime, Manchester, {{in spite of the}} entreaties of his staff, had not stirred from Clay Hill.

25|$|The Feast of San Gennaro, {{originally}} a one-day religious commemoration, {{is now an}} 11-day street fair held in mid-September in Manhattan's Little Italy. Centered on Mulberry Street, which is closed to traffic for the occasion, the festival generally features parades, street vendors, sausages and zeppole, games, and a religious candlelit procession which begins immediately after a celebratory mass at the Church of the Most Precious Blood. Another festival is held with the same attractions at New York's other Little Italy, in the Fordham/Belmont area in the Bronx. The streets are closed to traffic and the festivities begin <b>early</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>and</b> proceed late into the night.|$|E

Breslin also confirmed that, while only two were shown advancing in the final broadcast, four comics had been initially chosen {{to advance to the}} finals. Brian Lazanik, one of the two finalists who did not end up at the Vegas finals, has said that he was also chosen as a finalist in season 5's Toronto auditions, but was similarly cut. Producers for the show called his agent, urging him to try out again for season 6.|$|E
25|$|The {{foraging}} {{activities of}} Vespula vulgaris are generally highest in early mornings. There are three known reasons for such behavior. First is {{to satisfy the}} larval requirements. The workers fly off {{early in the morning}} to forage, as soon as their optimal light intensity is reached. They want to feed the larvae which have been starving during the night as soon as possible to reduce their chance of dying. The second reason is to maximize fluid foraging. Because dews and nectars are most abundant <b>early</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>and</b> are the best sources of fluids, the workers fly off early in the morning before the competition becomes severe. Last is the necessity to release excretory products such as trophallactic secretions from the larvae.|$|E
25|$|Most {{meteorological}} data was acquired {{all at once}} <b>early</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning,</b> <b>and</b> the rest of day's chasing was based on analysis and forecast gleaned from this; {{as well as on}} visual clues that presented themselves in the field throughout the day. Plotted weather maps were often analyzed by hand for manual diagnosis of meteorological patterns. Occasionally chasers would make stops at rural airstrips or NWS offices for an update on weather conditions. NOAA Weather Radio (NWR) could provide information in the vehicle, without stopping, such as weather watches and warnings, surface weather conditions, convective outlooks, and NWS radar summaries. Nowadays, storm chasers may use high-speed Internet access available in any library, even in small towns in the US. This data is available throughout the day, but one must find and stop at a location offering Internet access.|$|E

25|$|In the 1920s, Fry's {{mental health}} started to {{deteriorate}} severely. He had encountered {{mental health problems}} earlier in his life, experiencing a breakdown during his final year at Oxford, which meant that, although academically brilliant, he achieved a poor degree. In the late 1920s, he had a major breakdown and became deeply paranoid. He reached breaking point in 1928 {{during a visit to}} India, becoming convinced that an Indian had cast a spell on him. For the rest of his life, he dressed in bizarrely unconventional clothes. He did recover enough to become a popular writer on cricket and other sports, and even into his sixties he entertained hopes of becoming a Hollywood star. At one point when he was staying in Brighton he was supposed to have gone for a walk along the beach <b>early</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>and</b> suddenly shed all his clothes, trotting around stark naked.|$|E
25|$|A devadasi's {{life after}} {{dedication}} was obviously very different centuries ago. Nowadays After dedication {{of a girl}} to the temple, she has to take bath every day <b>early</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>and</b> should present herself at the temple during morning worship of Yellamma. She {{is not allowed to}} enter the sanctum sanctorum. But she will bow to the deity from outside. Thereafter she sweeps compound of the temple. Every Tuesday and Friday she goes for yoga along with senior jogatis (yoga teachers). During this period she learns innumerable songs in praise of Yellamma and her son Parashurama. If she shows some aptitude to learn playing instruments she will be given training by her elder jogatis. In Yellampura and other villages Devadasis do not dance but this is performed by eunuch companions. The main functions of Devadasis would be singing and playing stringed musical instruments and Jagate. They form a small group and go for joga, from house to house on every Tuesday and Friday (Jogan Shankar, 1990).|$|E
25|$|The 1951 All-Star Game had {{originally}} been awarded to the Phillies. However, the city of Detroit was celebrating the 250th anniversary of its founding in 1701 and requested to host the year's All-Star Game. The 1951 game was moved to Briggs Stadium, and the Phillies then hosted the 1952 Game. The home city was well represented on the All-Star teams. Phillies pitcher Curt Simmons started the game for the Nationals {{in front of the}} home crowd; Phillies shortstop Granny Hamner started and batted eighth; and A's pitcher Bobby Shantz pitched the fifth inning for the Americans and struck out Whitey Lockman, Jackie Robinson and Stan Musial in succession. It had rained all day, starting <b>early</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>and</b> keeping both teams from pre-game warm ups. Rain delayed the first pitch by 20 minutes and eventually caused the game to be called after the fifth inning.
