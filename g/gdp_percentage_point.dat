40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{cross-country}} {{variation of the}} fiscal stimulus and the exchange rate adjustment propagated by the global crisis of 2008 - 9, identifying the role of economic structure in accounting for the heterogeneity of response. We find that greater de facto fiscal space prior to the global crisis and lower trade openness were associated with a higher fiscal stimulus/GDP during 2009 - 2010 (where the de facto fiscal space is the inverse of the average tax-years {{it would take to}} repay the public debt). Lowering the 2006 public debt/average tax base from the level of low-income countries (5. 94) down to the average level of the Euro minus the Euro-area peripheral countries (1. 97), was associated with a larger crisis stimulus in 2009 - 11 of 2. 78 <b>GDP</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>points.</b> Joint estimation of fiscal stimuli and exchange rate depreciations indicates that higher trade openness was associated with a smaller fiscal stimulus and a higher depreciation rate during the crisis.

30|$|Furthermore, {{there are}} reasons to believe that the flow of funds table overstates the {{increase}} in household savings rate and the decline in household consumption rate. One reason is that the flow of funds table understates the rise in government income. For example, for the period of 2000 to 2007, the flow of funds table reports an increase in the share of net production tax in <b>GDP</b> of 1.1 <b>percentage</b> <b>points,</b> but the Yearbook of Fiscal Affairs reports an increase of 3.5 <b>percentage</b> <b>points.</b> The other reason is that it understates the decline in the labor income share and therefore the increase in the share of corporate disposable income in GDP. According to the flow of funds table, the labor income share dropped by only 2.7 <b>percentage</b> <b>points</b> between 2000 and 2007, while GDP account data by the income approach imply a drop of 5.3 <b>percentage</b> <b>points.</b> Both of these biases lead to an understatement of the decline in the share of household disposable income in GDP and therefore an overstatement of the decline in household consumption rate.|$|R

In addition, the process of liberalisation has affected export and import growth, almost by the same magnitude, although the export response is somewhat higher.

The financial crisis spread from Thailand to other Asian countries, subsequently to Russia and more recently to Brazil. Fortunately, timely and decisive action by the US Federal Reserve last autumn (instituting three successive reductions in interest rates) has enabled advanced countries to escape the crisis so far. Nevertheless it is estimated by the World Bank that as a consequence of the crisis the rate of growth of world <b>GDP</b> is 2 <b>percentage</b> <b>points</b> lower both in 1998 and in 1999 than it would otherwise have been. A rough calculation shows that this amounts to a huge loss over these two years of $ 120 per capita in production or income for each man, woman and child in the world. This also suggests indirectly that hundreds of millions of people in poor countries who live on a dollar a day or less are likely to have become considerably poorer still as a result of the crisis. ...|$|R

The inverse of unemployment rate is positively correlated with the index of prices. The causal relationship between inflation rate and unemployment rate is reciprocal. In the first period the index of prices evolution is explained only by changes in this variable. The inflation rate volatility is due mainly to the evolution of this indicator, the influence decreasing insignificantly in time, not descending under 88 %.

The objective {{of this study is to}} assess to what extent the observed growth and deepening international economic integration are related. It begins by discussing the concept of dynamic gains from trade. Narrowly defined, dynamic gains are trade-related changes in the long-run rate of productivity growth. Although there is no conclusive evidence that trade has dynamic effects in this narrow sense, there is robust evidence that open economies are richer and more productive than closed economies.
