5|$|The Maryland and Virginia Rifle Regiment {{consisted}} of nine companies—four <b>from</b> <b>Maryland</b> and five from Virginia. The two-state {{composition of the}} new unit precluded it from being managed through a single state government, and it was therefore directly responsible to national authority as an Extra Continental regiment.|$|E
5|$|A well-educated landowning aristocrat, Edwards {{deliberately}} cultivated {{the image}} of the natural leader. Thomas Ford writes that he continued to dress like an 18th-century gentleman long after such fashions had gone out of style, and that his public speaking was marked by showy eloquence. Edwards consciously positioned himself in the select class of men who dominated Kentucky and, later, Illinois politics. In 1803 in Russellville, Edwards married Elvira Lane, a relative <b>from</b> <b>Maryland.</b>|$|E

5|$|John Wilkes Booth (May 10, 1838 – April 26, 1865) was an American {{actor and}} assassin, who murdered President Abraham Lincoln at Ford's Theatre in Washington, D.C. on April 14, 1865. Booth {{was a member}} of the {{prominent}} 19th-century Booth theatrical family <b>from</b> <b>Maryland</b> and, by the 1860s, was a well-known actor. He was also a Confederate sympathizer, vehement in his denunciation of Lincoln, and strongly opposed to the abolition of slavery in the United States.|$|E
5|$|The {{script was}} written by Michael Arndt and was {{originally}} about an East Coast road trip <b>from</b> <b>Maryland</b> to Florida, but was shifted to a journey from New Mexico to California because of budget issues. Arndt started the script on May 23, 2000 and completed the first rough draft by May 26. He had initially planned on shooting the film himself by raising several thousand dollars and using a camcorder. Instead, he gave the screenplay to producers Ron Yerxa and Albert Berger who teamed up with Deep River Productions to find a potential director.|$|E
50|$|In 1868, Swann {{was elected}} to Congress <b>from</b> <b>Maryland's</b> 3rd congressional district, gaining {{re-election}} and serving until 1873.

5|$|Bobby Ross came <b>from</b> <b>Maryland</b> {{after winning}} three ACC titles over four years. Ross' first season at Tech {{experienced}} a severe talent vacuum after Curry's departure, {{and the players}} Ross inherited resisted the changes he demanded. The team only won two games, and Ross contemplated ending his coaching career after a humbling loss to Wake Forest in 1987. Ross decided to remain at Tech and continued to rebuild Tech's program. The turning point came in 1989 with the recruitment of Shawn Jones and several other key freshman. After two seasons and only five total wins, Jones helped the Jackets rebound {{at the end of}} the 1989 season.|$|E
5|$|Early {{approaches}} to preserving food used variants of traditional cold boxes {{to solve the}} problem of how to take small quantities of products short distances to market. Thomas Moore, an engineer <b>from</b> <b>Maryland,</b> invented an early refrigerator which he patented in 1803; this involved a large, insulated wooden box, with a tin container of ice embedded in the top. This refrigerator primarily relied upon simple insulation, rather than ventilation, but the design was widely adopted by farmers and small traders, and illegal copies abounded. By the 1830s portable refrigerator chests became used in the meat trade, taking advantage of the growing supplies of ice to use ventilation to better preserve the food. By the 1840s, improved supplies and an understanding of the importance of circulating air was making a significant improvement to refrigeration in the U.S.|$|E
5|$|I-35E was {{completed}} {{north of downtown}} Saint Paul in 1970. The first section to open ran north <b>from</b> <b>Maryland</b> Avenue in Saint Paul to I-694 in Little Canada; this {{was completed}} in the early 1960s, concurrently with I-694 west to old MN49 (Rice Street). Later that decade, I-35E was extended south to downtown Saint Paul, opening first to Pennsylvania Avenue and then to I-94, including the I-35E / I-94 concurrency (and I-94 in both directions). In 1970, I-35E was extended north along the I-35E / I-694 concurrency in Little Canada– Vadnais Heights and also extended northbound to its northern terminus at Columbus near Forest Lake; the adjacent sections of I-35, I-35W, and I-694 opened {{at about the same}} time.|$|E

5|$|In 1994, the Delaware General Assembly {{approved}} {{slot machines}} for the state's three racetracks, {{and the first}} racino opened in December 1995. This helped the horse racing industry in Delaware, as approximately 10 percent of all gross revenue is used to increase the purses. This drew competition away <b>from</b> <b>Maryland.</b> Rosecroft could not fill up a 12-race card for its opening night during the 1996 season. An estimated $80 million in wagering was lost in 1996 from the effect of Delaware's casinos. Throughout the years, various politicians tried to bring slot machines or table games to Rosecroft, but all were unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|In late August 1861, General John C. Frémont, the 1856 Republican presidential nominee, issued, without {{consulting}} his superiors in Washington, a proclamation {{of martial law}} in Missouri. He declared that any citizen found bearing arms could be court-martialed and shot, and that slaves of persons aiding the rebellion would be freed. Frémont was already under a cloud with charges of negligence in his command of the Department of the West compounded with allegations of fraud and corruption. Lincoln overruled Frémont's proclamation. Lincoln believed that Fremont's emancipation was political; neither militarily necessary nor legal. After Lincoln acted, Union enlistments <b>from</b> <b>Maryland,</b> Kentucky, and Missouri increased by over 40,000 troops.|$|E
5|$|Maryland {{was one of}} four {{dreadnought}} battleships of the Colorado {{class to}} be constructed. Her keel was laid down on 24 April 1917 by Newport News Shipbuilding Company of Newport News, Virginia. She was launched on 20 March 1920, and sponsored by Mrs. E. Brook Lee daughter-in-law of U.S. Senator <b>from</b> <b>Maryland</b> Blair Lee; she was commissioned on 21 July 1921, with Captain C.F. Preston in command.

5|$|Mathias' {{candidacy}} consideration did not endear him to {{the conservative}} wing of the Maryland Republican Party organization. In June 1976, he lost a vote by state Republicans to determine who would represent Maryland on the platform committee at the 1976 Republican National Convention. Instead, the group chose George Price, a conservative member of the Maryland House of Delegates from Baltimore County. At one point, Mathias was close to being denied attendance to the convention altogether as an at-large delegate, but a last minute compromise ensured all Republican congressional representatives seats as at-large delegates. Mathias maintained a low profile during the convention, and received harsh criticism {{from some of the}} conservative delegates <b>from</b> <b>Maryland</b> who attended.|$|E
5|$|Old Baltimore Pike is a {{road in the}} U.S. {{state of}} Delaware. The road, known as New Castle County Road 26, runs <b>from</b> <b>Maryland</b> Route 281 (MD 281) at the Maryland state line south of Newark, Delaware and {{continues}} east to Christiana, ending near Delaware Route 1 (DE 1). The road is paralleled by Interstate 95 (I-95, Delaware Turnpike) {{to the north and}} U.S. Route 40 (US 40, Pulaski Highway) to the south. The Old Baltimore Pike was built before 1720 and connected Elkton, Maryland to Christiana. It was a turnpike called the Elk and Christiana Turnpike between 1817 and 1838. In the past it served as a major connection between Philadelphia and Baltimore.|$|E
5|$|In 1984, Auerbach relinquished {{his general}} {{managing}} duties and became president and later vice-chairman of the Boston Celtics. In a surprising move after winning their 15th title, he traded popular guard Gerald Henderson, the game 2 {{hero in the}} finals against the Lakers, for Seattle's first round draft pick in 1986. Two years later, after the Celtics defeated Houston in the finals for their 16th championship, he used the second overall pick in the 1986 draft, the pick acquired from Seattle, to take college prodigy Len Bias <b>from</b> <b>Maryland,</b> arguably the most brilliant coup in Auerbach's stellar career. With the team's star players still in their prime, the defending champions appeared set to compete at the top for years. However, tragedy struck just two days later, when Bias died of a cocaine overdose. Several years later, Celtics star player Reggie Lewis died suddenly in 1993, and without any league compensation for either loss, the team fell into decline, not seeing another Finals in Auerbach's lifetime.|$|E
