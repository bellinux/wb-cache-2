2500|$|An {{avalanche}} transistor is a {{bipolar junction transistor}} designed for operation {{in the region of}} its collector-current/collector-to-emitter voltage characteristics beyond the collector-to-emitter breakdown voltage, called avalanche breakdown region. [...] This region is characterized by avalanche breakdown, which is a phenomenon similar to Townsend discharge for gases, and negative differential resistance. Operation in the avalanche breakdown region is called avalanche-mode operation: it gives {{avalanche transistor}}s the ability to switch very high currents with less than a nanosecond rise and fall times (transition times). Transistors not specifically designed for the purpose can have reasonably consistent avalanche properties; for example 82% of samples of the 15V <b>high-speed</b> <b>switch</b> 2N2369, manufactured over a 12-year period, were capable of generating avalanche breakdown pulses with rise time of 350ps or less, using a 90V power supply as Jim Williams writes.|$|E

50|$|For {{the next}} edition, {{an entirely new}} network has been designed. The new network is a routed network. Each field gets its own <b>high-speed</b> <b>switch</b> (HP Procure 9300 series) which are {{interconnected}} using 8 to 20 gigabit links. Every end-user switch has its own subnet so that network issues remain local problems and do not affect the entire network, as well as limiting unneeded broadcast traffic. Also, DHCP is used, removing the need to manually configure IP addresses. In order to allow for certain types of broadcast traffic, a custom-built system is used that relays certain packets (such as gameserver discovery packets) across the entire network. In addition, thanks to the high speeds at which fields are connected, every participant can use gigabit ethernet to connect their own PC to the network. Previously gigabit connections were available in few numbers and reserved for people who shared the link with several others. Altogether this should prove for a much more advanced, faster, more stable network.|$|E
5000|$|An {{application}} optimization solution, {{the role}} of distributed top-of-rack (DToR) is to expedite traffic flows between servers across multiple racks, as opposed to typical ToR switch deployments that direct these flows through multiple networking tiers. DToR switches traffic onto dedicated <b>high-speed</b> <b>switch</b> interconnects, avoiding aggregation or Core Switch tiers and reducing server-to-server latency, and improving application performance. DToR is supported on the Virtual Service Platform 7000 Series, and is deployable in two modes: Stack-mode DToR that leverages the FAST protocol from the Stackable Chassis technology to provide scalability up to 8 units, with a virtual backplane capability of 5.12 Tbit/s, and Fabric-mode DToR that leverages the SPB protocol from the Fabric Connect technology to the scale up to 500 units with a bandwidth of up to 280 Tbit/s. Thus, Stack-mode DToR supports up to 256 ports of 10 gigabit Ethernet in a single logical domain, while Fabric-mode DToR supports up to 16,000 ports.

Regarding that the switch which is consisting of a mobile copper disc, two fixed opening and closing coils, the computational method for the electromagnetic force is discussed, and also the dynamic mathematical model including circuit equation, magnetic field equation as well as mechanical motion equation is theoretically deduced. According to the mathematical modeling and calculation of characteristic parameters, a feasible design scheme is presented, and the high-speed switchâ€™s response time can be less than 0.5 Â ms. For that the modified SFCL is equipped with this <b>high-speed</b> <b>switch,</b> the SFCLâ€™s application in a 10 Â kV micro-grid system with multiple renewable energy sources are assessed in the MATLAB software.

Considering the practical application of switch technology {{in the field of}} SFCL, a <b>high-speed</b> <b>switch</b> based on electromagnetic repulsion mechanism (ERM) has received lots of attention from research scholars (Lim et al. 2010, 2014; He and Wang 2014).

30|$|The three {{revolute}} joints of each {{hind leg}} use six pneumatic muscles in total, and each pneumatic muscle {{is controlled by}} two <b>high-speed</b> <b>switch</b> valves. Thus, the entire hind limb requires 12 pneumatic <b>high-speed</b> <b>switch</b> valves. We consider the hip joint as an example to explain the working principle of the pneumatic circuit. The body and the thigh crank are connected with a joint shaft. Each end of the crank is hinged to the muscles, and the other ends {{are connected to the}} body frame. During muscle contraction and stretching, the crank (fixed with the thigh frame) rotates relative to the body. To reach the initial position, the charging valve 1 and discharging valve 2 are open, and the discharging valve 1 and charging valve 2 are closed. The recovery muscle then starts to contract, and the driving muscle stretches until the joint rotates clockwise to the preset position (FigureÂ  6). During the propulsive phase, the hip joint must rotate counterclockwise quickly, and thus the charging valve 1 and discharging valve 2 are close, and charging valve 1 and the discharging valve 2 are open. The recovery muscle of the hip joint then starts to stretch and the driving muscle contracts. The hip joint rotates counterclockwise quickly to a specific position.|$|E
