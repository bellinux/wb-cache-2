50|$|By {{the early}} 1970s, many {{users in the}} {{computer}} industry realized that an affordable video <b>data</b> <b>entry</b> <b>terminal</b> could supplant the ubiquitous punched cards and permit new uses for computers that would be more interactive. The problem was that the amount of memory needed to store the information on a page of text was comparable to the memory in low end minicomputers then in use. Displaying the information at video speeds was also a challenge and the necessary control logic took up a rack worth of pre-integrated circuit electronics. One company announced plans to build a video terminal for $15,000 and attracted a large backlog of orders, but folded when their engineering plans, which included fabricating their own ICs, proved too ambitious. Another approach involved the use of the storage tube, a specialized CRT developed by Tektronix that retained information written on it without the need to refresh.|$|E

40|$|Some {{clinical}} laboratory departments (such as microbiology) provide extensive reporting of text {{and other data}} not generated by instruments that can be interfaced to a laboratory information system. These data are usually entered into the laboratory information system manually by keyboard <b>data</b> <b>entry,</b> which can be cumbersome and time consuming. Bar codes, which are already used in laboratories to facilitate rapid entry of sample-identifying information, {{have the potential to}} be used much more broadly as a generalizable <b>data</b> <b>entry</b> technique. We developed a comprehensive system that takes advantage of several applications of bar coding to facilitate the work of our Clinical Microbiology Laboratory. Central to our system is the use of bar code "scripts" to meet many of our complex <b>data</b> <b>entry</b> requirements. Use of these scripts is transparent to the laboratory information system (ie, no special "drivers" are needed) because data are received {{as if they had been}} generated by typing the characters on the keyboard. The scripts consist of bar codes that encode the series of keystrokes needed to give the appropriate response at the series of prompts offered by the laboratory information system. Both alphanumeric and other keys, including carriage returns and special characters, can be converted into bar codes and incorporated into scripts. By creating and printing these scripts in the laboratory using standard wordprocessing software and bar code fonts for personal computers, laboratorians without specialized computer training have the tools to substantially improve the <b>data</b> <b>entry</b> efficiency of existing <b>data</b> <b>entry</b> <b>terminals</b> for a variety of laboratory information systems. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

40|$|In the {{information}} age, {{it is hard}} to imagine planning and production management without the support of information technologies, because the production process has become more complex and harder to control. Almost every company have a management information system for production monitoring, but for some companies, just monitoring is no longer sufficient, becouse they need more accurate determination of error causes and also need to track embedded products and materials The main objective of the thesis was to create an information solution for monitoring and tracking batches of products in discrete production, which would enable monitoring of input batches of materials and components, as well as other events, that occur in the production process. The module for tracking product lots is an upgrade of an existing information system for monitoring discrete production. Good knowledge of basic information system and manufacturing processes in the discrete production was therefore a prerequisite for making the module. Module for tracking lots is improving data capture and provides quality analysis of the production process. The practical part of the thesis was to design a solution for production tracking that enables <b>data</b> <b>entry</b> via <b>terminals,</b> and setting and reviewing them in a web application. Tracking lots in production makes it easier to discover the cause of bad products, consequently easier to eliminate these causes. Good tracking can eventually eliminate the negative factors of poor raw materials and components, and determine the origin of the material, which is the cause of bad lots. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe 2 -terminal one-to-any problem, which {{arises in}} the design of layout systems, is the problem of {{assigning}} wach one of n terminals positioned on the upper row of a channel (called <b>entry</b> <b>terminals)</b> to one of m terminals positioned on the lower row (called exit terminals) so that the resulting channel routing problem has minimum density. An optimal solution to this problem is known [1]. In this paper we consider a natural generalization, the 2 -color one-to-any problem, in which we have two types of <b>entry</b> <b>terminals,</b> red and blue ones, and exit terminals can be assigned to either type of <b>entry</b> <b>terminal.</b> Red and blue nets created by our algorithm are allowed to run {{on top of each other}} in the routing, and the density is defined as the larger of the red density and the blue density.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{was to determine the}} conditions under which Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) is an efficient choice for <b>data</b> <b>entry.</b> In particular the focus was on <b>data</b> <b>entry</b> tasks that are part of constructing military messages. The ADF Formatted Messaging System utilises a structured formatting system to constrain the semantics of a message but also includes a field for unlimited and unstructured text. Hence the <b>data</b> <b>entry</b> tasks involved range from form-filling to free dictation of short phrases. In the experiments, ASR and manual input modes are compared for three <b>data</b> <b>entry</b> tasks: textual phrase entry, selection from a list, and numerical <b>data</b> <b>entry.</b> To effect fair comparisons, the tasks minimised the transaction cycle for each input mode and data type and the main comparisons use only times from correct <b>data</b> <b>entry.</b> The results indicate that for inputting short phrases ASR only competes if the typist's speed is below 45 wpm. For selecting an item from a list, ASR offered an advantage only if the list length was greater than 15 items. For entering numerical data, ASR offered no advantage over keypad or mouse. The general conclusion for formatted <b>data</b> <b>entry</b> is that a keyboard/mouse interface designed to match the data to be entered will be more time efficient than any equivalent ASR interface...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Use of {{electronic}} health record (EHR) systems can place a considerable <b>data</b> <b>entry</b> burden upon {{the emergency department}} (ED) physician. Voice recognition <b>data</b> <b>entry</b> has been proposed as one mechanism to mitigate some of this burden; however, no reports are available specifically comparing emergency physician (EP) time use or number of interruptions between typed and voice recognition data entry-based EHRs. We designed this study to compare physician time use and interruptions between an EHR system using typed <b>data</b> <b>entry</b> versus an EHR with voice recognition. Methods: We collected prospective observational data at 2 academic teaching hospital EDs, one using an EHR with typed <b>data</b> <b>entry</b> {{and the other with}} voice recognition capabilities. Independent raters observed EP activities during regular shifts. Tasks each physician performed were noted and logged in 30 second intervals. We compared time allocated to charting, direct patient care, and change in tasks leading to interruptions between sites. Results: We logged 4, 140 minutes of observation for this study. We detected no statistically significant differences in the time spent by EPs charting (29. 4 % typed; 27. 5 % voice) or the time allocated to direct patient care (30. 7 %; 30. 8 %). Significantly more interruptions per hour were seen with typed <b>data</b> <b>entry</b> versus voice recognition <b>data</b> <b>entry</b> (5. 33 vs. 3. 47; p= 0. 0165). Conclusion: The use of a voice recognition <b>data</b> <b>entry</b> system versus typed <b>data</b> <b>entry</b> did not appear to alter the amount of time physicians spend charting or performing direct patient care in an ED setting. However, we did observe a lower number of workflow interruptions with the voice recognition <b>data</b> <b>entry</b> EHR. Additional research is needed to further evaluate the <b>data</b> <b>entry</b> burden in the ED and examine alternative mechanisms for chart entry as EHR systems continue to evolve.
