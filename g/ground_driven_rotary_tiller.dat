Following, the steering wheel of a tractor was manipulated so that the tractor was traveling straight while the <b>rotary</b> <b>tiller</b> was set at a certain angle to the tractor, while the front steering angle was measured simultaneously to investigate the effectiveness of the yaw angle of the <b>rotary</b> <b>tiller.</b> In addition, the compensatory rectilinear progress control system that controlled the yaw angle of the <b>rotary</b> <b>tiller</b> was tried to be constructed with an oscillatory type yaw rate sensor and a telescopic lower link {{in order to reduce the}} yaw attitude angle of the tractor.

40|$|The wear {{resistance}} of rotary plows {{operating in a}} clay loam soil was studied. The degree of damage caused to the soil {{and the amount of}} mass lost by the tools were determined in order to establish correlations between the physical properties of the soil and the wear mechanisms acting on the tribosystem. Field tests were carried out in 12 plots and a randomized experimental design with 4 levels, 3 replicas per level and 2 passes per plot was applied. The levels relate to the tillage implements employed: <b>rotary</b> <b>tiller,</b> <b>rotary</b> power harrow, small motorized <b>rotary</b> <b>tiller</b> and control (unaltered soil). The highest mass losses were measured in <b>rotary</b> <b>tiller</b> and <b>rotary</b> power harrow's tools, while the small motorized <b>rotary</b> <b>tiller's</b> tools showed generally lower levels of damage.

Debriddhi Devakul (M.R. stands for Mom Rajawong, meaning that his great-grandfather was the King of Thailand, and that he could be properly addressed as [...] "Prince"), head of the Engineering Division of the Thai Rice Department, of the Thai Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives. As the early 2WTs did not have steering clutches, longer handles were provided for turning and controlling the tractor more easily in fields. Initially the engines were taken from kerosene engine powered irrigation pumps, but as the popularity of the tractor became obvious (known as the [...] "Iron Buffalo"), three Japanese firms set up diesel engine factories in Thailand with agreements to progressively increase local content. Later, steering clutches were provided on many companies' models. The tractor gear box and chassis are made by many local industries (Samakkee Lohakij Ltd., Agri-Mechanics Co Ltd., Ayutthaya Tractor Factory, Cosmonoki Thai International Co. Ltd., C.R. Tractor Co Ltd, Inter Kankaset Co. Ltd, Jakpetch Tractor Co. Ltd., Jor Charoenchai Tractor, Kor Rungruang, Muileng Industry Ltd., Samakkee Lohakij Ltd., Siam Kubota Industry Co. Ltd., etc.). Initially, factories copied from one another, and competing for sales {{to the point that the}} tractor's chassis without engine has become very inexpensive, about one third to one half the cost of the engine. The [...] "Thai tractor" [...] eventually evolved into a more general standard [...] "NC" [...] type models with three gears forward, one reverse, and steering clutches. Attachments that are available are moldboard and disc plows, spiked tooth harrows, trailed-type (non-powered) rotary puddlers (lateral drums with protruding paddles), various types of levelers and simple trailers (usually without brakes or lights). Recently (2010), a new NC Plus model offered by Siam Kubota comes with a [...] (PTO) that can <b>drive</b> a <b>rotary</b> <b>tiller</b> and other attachments. Additionally many farmers use V-belts to connect the stationary tractor engine to power centrifugal pumps and axial flow pumps, rice threshers, maize shellers etc. Recently inexpensive Chinese-made NC models have come on the international market but attempts by Siam Kubota and others to keep them out of Thailand, Cambodia and elsewhere due to claims of copyright infringement. Through the 1980s and 1990s, more than 50,000 tractors were reportedly being produced and sold each year and by 2006 more than 70,000 were being produced and even more imported so that estimates of 2WT population is between 1.7 - 2.0 million 2WTs in Thailand.|$|R
