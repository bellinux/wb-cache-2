They then enter a queue which takes them farther into the station building, under a split-flap <b>departure</b> <b>board,</b> and past London-related advertisements, several stacks of suitcases and a shop selling food. After ascending a flight of stairs, passengers find themselves between signs for King's Cross Platform 9 and Platform 10. They can see those ahead of them walking through the [...] "wall" [...] forming the entrance to Platform [...] This effect uses the Pepper's ghost illusion. After continuing around several corners, guests arrive on Platform [...] itself to wait for the next train to arrive. After the Hogwarts Express has reversed into Platform [...] and the arriving passengers have disembarked, the next passengers enter one of the twenty-one compartments in the three passenger carriages.|$|E
