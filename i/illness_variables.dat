40|$|Objective: A cancer {{diagnosis}} {{may lead}} to the need to adjust personal goals. This study longitudinally investigates patients' use of goal adjustment strategies with goal characteristics over time. Whether and which goal adjustment strategies are used after cancer diagnosis may depend on the period studied (treatment period or follow-up period) and <b>illness</b> <b>variables</b> such as illness severity. MethodsNewly diagnosed colorectal cancer patients (n= 186) were asked about their personal goals during three assessments (within 1 month after diagnosis and 6 and 18 months after the first assessment). Eight goal adjustment strategies were assessed over the first 6 months (treatment period) and between 7 and 18 months (follow-up period) using goal characteristics. <b>Illness</b> <b>variables</b> were obtained from patients' medical records from the national cancer registry. ResultsMost patients used one strategy per period, and patients most often shifted their priorities across life domains. During the treatment period, more patients formed shorter-term goals than during the follow-up period, while during the follow-up period, more patients formed longer-term goals than during the treatment period. <b>Illness</b> <b>variables</b> were not related to the use of goal adjustment strategies.

40|$|AbstractObjectivesCognitive {{impairment}} {{is known}} to occur in bipolar disorder (BD), even in euthymic patients, with largest effect sizes often seen in Verbal Learning and Memory Tasks (VLT). However, comparisons between BD Type-I and Type-II have produced inconsistent results partly due to low sample sizes. MethodsThis study compared the performance of 183 BDI with 96 BDII out-patients on an adapted version of the Rey Verbal Learning Task. Gender, age, years of education, mood scores and age at onset were all used as covariates. Current medication {{and a variety of}} <b>illness</b> <b>variables</b> were also investigated for potential effects on VLT performance. ResultsBDI patients were significantly impaired relative to BDII patients on all five VLT outcome measures after controlling for the other variables [Effect Sizes=. 13 –. 17]. The impairments seem to be unrelated to drug treatment and largely unrelated to <b>illness</b> <b>variables,</b> although age of onset affected performance on three outcome measures and number of episodes of mood elevation affected performance on one. LimitationsThis study used historical healthy controls. Analysis of potential drug effects was limited by insufficient participants not being drug free. Cross-sectional nature of the study limited the analysis of the potential effect of <b>illness</b> <b>variables.</b> ConclusionsThis study replicates earlier findings of increased verbal learning impairment in BDI patients relative to BDII in a substantially larger sample. Such performance cannot be wholly explained by medication effects or <b>illness</b> <b>variables.</b> Thus, the cognitive impairment is likely to reflect a phenotypic difference between bipolar sub-types...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Genetic {{factors are}} {{important}} in the aetiology of psychotic disorders, but {{it is unclear how}} far they influence aspects of illness history within psychoses. AIMS: To investigate the extent, and type of familial aggregation for a range of <b>illness</b> history <b>variables</b> in psychosis. METHODS: Two-hundred-and-twenty-four proband-wise twin pairs (106 monozygotic, 118 same-sex dizygotic), where probands had psychosis, were ascertained from the Maudsley Twin Register in London. We investigated the following <b>illness</b> history <b>variables,</b> rated using the OPCRIT checklist: age at onset; chronicity of course; mode of onset; psychotic/affective predominance; pre-morbid social adjustment; and the presence of a psychosocial precipitant. We used Mx statistical modelling software to analyse correlations of variables within pairs of monozygotic twins concordant for psychosis; and relationships between variables in probands and risk of psychosis in monozygotic and dizygotic co-twins. RESULTS: There was a high monozygotic within-pair correlation for age at onset (intra-class correlation= 0. 9); moderate correlations for chronicity of course (polychoric correlation= 0. 4) and psychotic/affective predominance (polychoric correlation= 0. 5); and lower non-significant correlations for other variables. No variables consistently predicted risk of psychosis in co-twins. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Illness</b> history <b>variables</b> in psychosis show a broad range of familial aggregation.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Although classically conceptualised as a {{disorder}} of mood, a consensus is emerging {{that patients with}} bipolar disorder show cognitive deficits both during the acute phase of illness and during remission (Savitz et al., 2005). The cognitive dysfunction seen in bipolar disorder {{may also be a}} key to longterm disability, which in turn is likely to adversely affect psychosocial functioning, insight and treatment adherence. AIM To assess the executive functions in euthymic phase of bipolar affective disorder subjects and study the relationship between cognitive functions and <b>illness</b> <b>variables.</b> MATERIALS AND METHODS 30 BPAD patients were assessed in the euthymic phase for executive dysfunction on four tests- verbal fluency, Trail making tests, Stroop colour word tests and Wisconsin card sorting tests and compared with controls. An intragroup analysis was then done to determine the effect of <b>illness</b> <b>variables.</b> Statistical analysis of the data has been done using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences. RESULTS Executive function was significantly impaired in the bipolar group when compared to normal controls. On analysing the relation of executive dysfunction with <b>illness</b> <b>variables,</b> only number of episodes had a significant effect, that too on a subtest of Stroop.

40|$|Background: There {{are major}} health care {{implications}} of Quality of Life and Disability in long-standing {{disorders such as}} bipolar affective disorder and recurrent depressive disorder. Objectives: To compare the inter episode Quality of life (QOL) and Disability in patients with the diagnosis of Bipolar affective disorder or Recurrent depressive disorder in remission. Methods: The two groups were assessed cross-sectionally. Euthymic bipolar or recurrent depressive disor-der subjects {{were included in the}} study. QOL assessment was done using the World Health Organisation (WHO) QOL – Bref Kannada version. Disability was assessed using the Schedule for assessment of psychiatric disability (SAPD), which is an Indian modification of the WHO Disability assessment schedule-II. Results: There were 80 patients enrolled into the study. The mean QOL scores did not differ significantly in the two groups except for the RDD subjects experiencing higher environmental domain QOL (p=. 05). The mean disability scores in the BAD group was significantly more in ‘social role ’ (p<. 0001) and ‘overall behavior ’ (p=. 001) and in the RDD group it was more in ‘ home atmosphere’(p<. 0001) and ‘assets and/or liabilities’(p=. 001).

40|$|Asthma {{management}} in school-aged children, particularly controller medication use, is best conceptualized as parent-child shared management. Controller medication nonadherence is common, {{and leads to}} higher disease morbidity such as cough, sleep disruption, poor activity tolerance, and asthma exacerbation. The {{purpose of this study}} was to describe asthma illness representations of both school-aged children (6 - 11 years) with persistent asthma and their parents, and to examine their interdependence. The Common Sense Model of Self-regulation, modified to include Parent-Child Shared Regulation, provided the framework for this descriptive, cross-sectional study. Thirty-four parent-child dyads independently reported on asthma control, controller medication adherence, and asthma illness representations by completing the Childhood Asthma Control Test, Medication Adherence Report Scale for Asthma, Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire, and Beliefs about Medicines Questionnaire. Using intraclass correlations, moderate agreement was evident between the parent and child timeline (perceived duration) illness representation domain (ICC=. 41), and there was a weak association between the parent and child symptoms domain (ICC =. 13). The remaining controllability and consequences domains showed no agreement. Hierarchical regression analyses were used to test parent and child <b>illness</b> representation domain <b>variables</b> as predictors of parent or child estimates of medication adherence. With parent-reported medication adherence as the dependent variable, regression models used parent <b>illness</b> representation <b>variables</b> followed by the corresponding child variable. Parent beliefs about medication necessity versus concerns was a significant predictor of parent-reported treatment adherence (β =. 55, p <. 01). Child-reported treatment control was also predictive of parent-reported treatment adherence (β -. 50, p <. 01). When child-reported medication adherence was the dependent <b>variable,</b> the child <b>illness</b> representation <b>variable</b> was entered first followed by the parent variable. Child beliefs about medication necessity versus concerns was the only significant predictor of child-reported adherence (child β. 50, p <. 01), none of the parent variables reached significance. Findings from this study indicate that although there are similarities between parent and child asthma illness representations, parental illness representations do not predict children's estimation of controller medication adherence. These findings indicate that school-aged children develop illness representations somewhat independent from their parents and, therefore, are critical participants in both asthma care as well as research...|$|R

This study was aimed at assessing SS among elderly users of a primary healthcare unit in a poor and violent area of Rio de Janeiro City, and at verifying its association with depression, self-perceived health (SPH), marital status and chronic illnesses. Methods: A cross-sectional study was performed based on a convenience sample of 180 individuals aged 60 years or older. SS was measured with part of the Brazilian version of Medical Outcomes Study’s SS scale, and SPH and depression were assessed, respectively, through one question and the Brazilian version of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders. SS medians were calculated for the categories of SPH, depression, marital status and chronic <b>illnesses</b> <b>variables,</b> and differences were evaluated with the Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests. Additionally, Pearson’s chi-square test and logistic regression were employed to identify unadjusted and adjusted associations between SS and those variables.

Post-hoc analyses were subsequently performed using SPSS to examine {{the extent to which}} clinical and <b>illness</b> history <b>variables</b> and psychotropic medication contributed to GMV abnormalities in BPI in a priori and non-a priori regions has demonstrated by the above VBM analyses. BPI showed reduced GMV in bilateral posteromedial rectal gyrus (PMRG), but no abnormalities in amygdala GMV. BPI also showed reduced GMV in two non-a priori regions: left parahippocampal gyrus and left putamen. For left PMRG GMV, there was a significant group by gender by trait anxiety interaction. GMV was significantly reduced in male low-trait anxiety BPI versus male low-trait anxiety HC, and in high-versus low-trait anxiety male BPI. Our results show that in BPI there were significant effects of gender and trait-anxiety, with male BPI and those high in trait-anxiety showing reduced left PMRG GMV.

40|$|Introduction: Alcohol {{dependence}} is {{a chronic}} disorder, accompanied by neuropsychological deficits. Patients with alcohol dependence were evaluated {{to identify the}} cognitive dysfunctions. Method: The study followed descriptive design and recruited participants (N= 62) from inpatient services of the Department of Psychiatry and Mental Health by convenient sampling. Participants were evaluated with the Severity of Alcohol Dependence Questionnaire, Frontal Assessment Battery and PGI Memory Scale for the severity of alcohol dependence, executive impairments and memory dysfunctions respectively once they had completed alcohol detoxification. Results: Total duration of alcohol consumption was 13. 93 ± 8. 74 years, period of dependence was 2. 97 ± 2. 23 years and 56. 5 % had moderate level of dependence. 33. 9 % of the participants had executive impairments particularly in conceptualization, programming and mental flexibility. 38 % of variance in executive dysfunction was explained by <b>illness</b> <b>variables,</b> where period of alcohol dependence and education were significant predictors. 54. 8 % had significant memory dysfunction particularly in visual retention, remote memory, verbal retention of dissimilar pairs and delayed recall. Memory dysfunction differed significantly among the age groups (F= 10. 22, p< 0. 01) and age {{was a significant predictor}} (β=. 542, p< 0. 001). 19 % variance in memory dysfunction was explained by <b>illness</b> <b>variables,</b> where duration of alcohol consumption was a significant predictor (β =. 485, p< 0. 01). Conclusion: Findings indicate that cognitive dysfunctions are prevalent among patients with alcohol dependence. Hence, routine neuropsychological assessment is of particular importance for early detection and remediation of underlying deficits, which completes the treatment of alcohol dependence.

30|$|Various chronobiological {{disturbances}} {{have been}} reported in bipolar disorder, including characteristics associated with general activity levels, sleep, and rhythmicity. There is a paucity of research examining how these variables are interrelated and how they are collectively associated with clinical characteristics of the <b>illness.</b> <b>Variable</b> cluster analysis is a method for grouping variables based on the similarity of their characteristics and identifies the most representative variables in clusters. This statistical approach is a dimension reduction technique, similar in approach to principal component analysis. Variable cluster analysis not only identifies the interrelationships between variables, but also overcomes the problem of interpretation related to principal component analysis. The identification of subgroups via general cluster analysis is relatively common. For example, cluster analysis has been used to identify patient subgroups in affective disorders based on chronobiological characteristics in order to determine relationships with physiological markers of rhythmicity (Carpenter et al. 2017). However, no previous studies have used a variable cluster analysis approach to determine the most salient chronobiological characteristics among a large dimension of variables in association with mood state. While previous studies have focused on the individual relationships between affective state and chronobiological characteristics, {{to the best of our}} knowledge, no study has yet to assess how these different types of chronobiological disturbances may be interrelated in their association with mood state. The aim of this study was, therefore, to conduct a variable cluster analysis in order to ascertain how chronobiological traits collectively are associated with affect. Our goal in conducting a variable cluster analysis was also to reduce the number of related variables associated with mood state and to determine the chronobiological markers most representative of these relationships. Based on our previous study that demonstrated a relationship between a lower degree of robustness in the rhythmicity of psychomotor activity and the severity of mania (Gonzalez et al. 2014), we hypothesized that a greater degree of manic symptomatology is associated disturbances of rhythm.|$|R
