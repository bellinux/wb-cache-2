5|$|Since {{electrical}} energy cannot easily {{be stored in}} quantities large enough to meet demands on a national scale, at all times exactly as much must be produced as is required. This requires <b>electricity</b> <b>utilities</b> to make careful predictions of their electrical loads, and maintain constant co-ordination with their power stations. A certain amount of generation must always be held in reserve to cushion an electrical grid against inevitable disturbances and losses.|$|E
5|$|The {{resistive}} Joule {{heating effect}} employed in filament light bulbs also sees more direct use in electric heating. While this is versatile and controllable, {{it can be}} seen as wasteful, since most electrical generation has already required the production of heat at a power station. A number of countries, such as Denmark, have issued legislation restricting or banning the use of resistive electric heating in new buildings. Electricity is however still a highly practical energy source for heating and refrigeration, with air conditioning/heat pumps representing a growing sector for electricity demand for heating and cooling, the effects of which <b>electricity</b> <b>utilities</b> are increasingly obliged to accommodate.|$|E

30|$|Even {{though on}} service quality of <b>electricity</b> <b>utility</b> {{industries}} few researches have been done, still {{it is an}} important matter for research. By improving service quality, the development of utility industry will be possible. For the improvement of service quality in <b>electricity</b> <b>utility</b> industry, {{the most important thing is}} required to find the points on which the service quality failure occurs in Indian <b>electricity</b> <b>utility</b> industry. Thus, artificial neural network (ANN) is implemented to get those important points for improvement. After getting the cause of failure, the rectification is done by designing the system for the improvement of <b>electricity</b> <b>utility</b> industry. For designing/framing the new electricity industry, quality function deployment (QFD) is used. Then, interpretive structural modeling (ISM) method is used to find the correlation between the design requirements of <b>electricity</b> <b>utility</b> industry. Thus, in this paper, three techniques/tools QFD, ISM, and ANN are used.|$|R

2500|$|On June 1, 2010, the Chinese {{government}} announced a trial program to provide incentives for new energy vehicles {{of up to}} 60,000 yuan (~ in June 2011) for private purchase of new battery electric vehicles and 50,000 yuan [...] (~ in June 2011) for plug-in hybrids in five cities. The cities participating in the pilot program are Shanghai, Shenzhen, Hangzhou, Hefei and Changchun. The subsidies are paid directly to automakers rather than consumers, but the government expects that vehicle prices will be reduced accordingly. The amount of the subsidy will be reduced once 50,000 units are sold. <b>Electricity</b> <b>utilities</b> have been ordered to set up electric car charging stations in Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin.
