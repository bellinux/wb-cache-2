40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an overview of}} a parametric cost model that has been built at JPL to estimate costs of future, deep space, robotic science missions. Due to the recent dramatic changes in JPL business practices brought about by an internal reengineering effort known as develop new products (DNP), high-level historic cost data is no longer considered analogous to future missions. Therefore, the historic data is of little value in forecasting costs for projects developed using the DNP process. This has {{lead to the development}} of an approach for obtaining expert opinion and also for combining actual data with expert opinion to provide a cost database for future missions. In addition, the DNP cost model has a maximum of objective cost drivers which reduces the likelihood of model input error.

Despite numerous golf instructional books, no scientific study has assessed a golf coach's technical knowledge of the golf swing. Therefore, {{the purpose of this}} study was to identify the <b>key</b> <b>technical</b> <b>parameters</b> that professional golf coaches associate with a top level golf swing; with the intention of using the results to guide future golf biomechanics research and coaching technologies. Initially, sixteen professional golf coaches were individually observed coaching a highly skilled golfer after which they participated in a semi-structured interview regarding their technical analysis of the golf swing. QSR-NVivo analysis software was used to inductively analyse the data using the grounded theory approach. Line-by-line coding was followed by comparison of ‘meaning units’ to form a coding hierarchy with several <b>key</b> <b>technical</b> <b>parameters</b> identified. A successful golf swing was defined through three elements, with “body motion” affecting “club motion” and resulting “ball flight”. Several terms described these parameters including “consistent”, “powerful”, “accurate”, “simple” and “controlled” with the most prevalent being “repeatable”. “Body motion” was influenced by five intrinsically linked key technical parameters: “posture”, “body rotation”, “sequential movement”, “hand and arm action” and “club parameters” which were further sub categorised. To conclude, the <b>key</b> <b>technical</b> <b>parameters</b> have been identified which will be used to support future biomechanical research in this area and to be used to direct new technologies to aid golf coaching...|$|E

The simulation based optimisation takes into consideration temporal high-resolution consumer load and PV production profiles, technical and economical PV and battery system parameters {{as well as the}} regulatory framework in Germany.

The ratio of the installed PV peak power to the useable capacity of the battery was found to {{have a significant impact on}} self-consumption, autarky and economic efficiency of the overall system and is one of <b>technical</b> <b>key</b> <b>parameters</b> for a cost-optimised system sizing.

However, the individual taxation of revenues can lower the break-even costs significantly. Furthermore, the techno-economic analysis identifies a high sensitivity to regulation frame conditions and support schemes of PV and BESS for cost optimisation. Another key finding is that realistic load and production profiles must be used in order to allow for reliable statements concerning <b>technical</b> <b>parameters</b> and economic feasibility.

This would require dairy farms to produce 25 PJ per year, possibly {{by a combination of}} wind, solar and biogas. This paper focuses on biogas. To evaluate the project’s viability we estimated the expected technical and financial performance of 4 types of business models, i. e. “CHP-farm”, “CHP-large”, “green gas” and “central upgrading of green gas”. Data stem from among others 23 biogas plants in the Netherlands. Anticipating that CHP-models and green gas models occur with a likelihood of 40 % and 60 % respectively, the total number of biogas plants would amount to 232 (1 % of dairy farms), including a total of 5 million tons of manure per year (14 % of all cattle manure in the Netherlands) and annual government subsidies of Euro 295 million. Aggregated annual profits are expected to be positive, but over the project’s total life time there is an expected deficit of Euro 262. For this to change costs of feedstocks or digestate disposal costs would for instance have to go down. Also fully switching to green gas models dampens the deficit.

However, if the system concept includes optical links {{to the surface of the}} Earth, the limited availability due to clouds and other atmospheric impacts need to be considered to give a reliable estimate of the system performance. An OGS network is required for increasing the availability to acceptable figures. In order to realistically estimate the performance and achievable throughput in various scenarios, a simulation tool has been developed under ESA contract. The tool is based on a database of 5 years of cloud data with global coverage and can thus easily simulate different optical ground station network topologies for LEO- and GEO-to-ground links. Further parameters, like e. g. limited availability due to sun blinding and atmospheric turbulence, are considered as well. This paper gives an overview about the simulation tool, the cloud database, as well as the modelling behind the simulation scheme.

Although more than ten VSC-HVDC projects are under construction and many more are in operations globally, the testing criteria for HVDC XLPE cables are mainly referenced to test guideline TB 496 recommended by CIGRE. Due to the large stray capacitance of the VSC-HVDC cables, the switching impulse overvoltage stress of the cables is the main electrical parameter concerned, a unified overvoltage factor of 2. 1 p. u. being generally accepted. However, the switching impulse overvoltage stress of a VSC-HVDC cable system depends on not only the VSC topology but also the cable parameters and the volt-ampere characteristics of the dc cable surge arresters used. This paper studies the switching impulse overvoltage stresses for the dc cable system of a symmetrical monopole VSC-HVDC transmission system using the modular multilevel converter technology. The studies were performed according to the <b>key</b> <b>technical</b> <b>parameters</b> for a typical 1000 -MW/ 320 -kV VSC-HVDC transmission scheme, the XLPE dc cable links being assumed.

30|$|The {{metaphor of}} a {{trajectory}} usefully integrates key themes in recent {{work on the}} ethics of emerging technology.

The dilemma arises in connection with the fact that at the stages where one can have the most influence over the design and implementation of a technology, one cannot predict its effects. After the effects become known, many <b>key</b> <b>technical</b> <b>parameters</b> are “locked in.” Although a focus on trajectories does not eliminate the dilemma, it usefully indicates the way that some vague future is envisioned at each stage {{in the development of a}} technology.

In acknowledging the way that advocates or opponents of a technology work from a vaguely envisioned scenario for the future, the idea of a trajectory also connects well with recent work on the role of “imaginaries” in science and technology studies (Rabinow 1999; Mordini 2007). Indeed, because trajectories articulate the scenario that mobilizes scientists, engineers, investors and potential users into a network that will try to realize the development and implementation of a given technical means, they are “imaginaries” that script activity for individuals and groups integrated by the network to perform.|$|E

Stimulated Emission Depletion (STED) nanoscopy extends fluorescence imaging to nanometer resolutions. However, this method usually acquires an image by scanning small pixels in a sequential manner, {{which can lead}} to long acquisition times of several minutes. This limits the feasibility of many large-scale superresolution experiments, because faster acquisition times imply sacrificing either highest resolution, a good signal-to-noise ratio or a large image size. To unleash the full spatio-temporal resolving power potential of STED nanoscopy on a large imaging region, massively parallelized acquisition is therefore inevitable. In this thesis, I develop a comprehensive and quantitative description of parallelized STED and validate the derived findings by means of two experimental implementations. Investigating the <b>key</b> <b>technical</b> <b>parameters</b> and their interplay reveals the possibility of reducing the laser power by up to three orders of magnitude below the value required for serially acquiring STED systems. This eliminates a major bottleneck of previously reported attempts to parallelize STED nanoscopy, limiting them to tiny image sizes or inferior resolutions. Moreover, using a rather simple optical arrangement, I was able to enlarge the superresolved image area to 33 μm edge length (roughly the dimensions of a small cell), featuring a resolution down to 30 nm and a 13000 -fold degree of parallelization. While the implementations presented here should be viewed as prototypes, they prove the technical feasibility of massively parallelized STED nanoscopy.

In this paper, the Wufeng Fm–Longmaxi Fm shale gas wells in Changning Block were taken as the study object to provide technical reference for the development design of similar shale-gas horizontal wells. The technology combining geology with engineering, dynamic with static, and statistical analysis with simulation prediction was applied to quantify the main factors controlling shale-gas well productivity, develop the shale-gas well production prediction model, and optimize the <b>key</b> <b>technical</b> <b>parameters</b> of geologic target of shale-gas horizontal wells in the block (e. g. roadway orientation, location and spacing, horizontal section length and gas well production index).

40|$|Aircraft {{design is}} an example of complex {{engineering}} where dimensioning tools can be valuable for the designers and decision makers in the early stage of the development process. These tools can be in form of a database over key numbers for different components or technologies. One of the critical parts of an aircraft is the actuator system. Conventional hydraulic actuators are demanding regarding maintenance which implies high operation costs. Therefore in recent years the focus has been set on electro-hydrostatic and electro-mechanical actuators. The aim of this work is to build a platform which can make it easier for designers and decision makers to analyze, compare and optimize different technologies regarding the actuator system. For this reason a simplified quasi-static actuator model, including reactive power consumption has been developed. This model makes it possible to reduce the complexity of the actuator models to such extent that the resulting computional tool can be used for studies of the system performance during entire flight missions and/or for optimization. Power density, cost and weight of the actuator systems are some of the important key numbers for comparing purpose and as a platform for the dimensioning of the aircraft. The ambition is then to build up a database of different actuator solutions with the <b>key</b> <b>technical</b> <b>parameters</b> mentioned above, {{that can be used in}} modeling and dimensioning of an aircraft. In order to avoid time consuming finite element calculations when analyzing an electrical machine a reluctance network model can be used. The basic idea of the proposed network model is to divide the rotor and the stator into a grid of small reluctance elements and provide those that correspond to the permanent magnet and the air gap between the magnets with time varying reluctances. The suggested computationally approach constitute a fast way to evaluate permanent magnet electrical machines with the respect to their performance. A preferred electrical machine provided with balance teeth and concentrated windings showed good electromechanical and thermal behavior. A balance tooth is a tooth without winding between each adjacent phases that has a cooling effect on the nearest windings, resulting in less copper losses. The balance teeth increases the voltage-time area, leading to higher induced voltage and higher torque production. Another advantage of the chosen design is its redundancy and fault tolerance capabilities. The machine comprises two independent half machines that also offers a high level of redundancy with two separate power channels. QC 2010091...|$|E
