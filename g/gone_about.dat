5|$|Burnham {{was born}} on May 11, 1861 on a Dakota Sioux Indian {{reservation}} in Minnesota, to a missionary family living near the small pioneer town of Tivoli (now <b>gone),</b> <b>about</b> 20 miles (32km) from Mankato. His father, the Reverend Edwin Otway Burnham, was a Presbyterian minister educated and ordained in New York; {{he was born in}} Ghent, Kentucky. His mother Rebecca Russell Burnham had spent most of her childhood in Iowa, having emigrated with her family from Westminster, England at the age of three. In the Dakota War of 1862, Chief Little Crow and his Sioux warriors attacked the nearby town New Ulm, Minnesota; Burnham's father was in Mankato buying ammunition at the time, so when Burnham's mother saw Sioux approaching her cabin dressed in war paint, she knew she had to leave and could never escape carrying her baby. She hid Frederick in a basket of green corn husks in a corn field and fled for her life. Once the Sioux attack had been repulsed, she returned to find their house burned down, but the baby Frederick was safe, fast asleep in the basket with the corn husks.|$|E

500|$|For the 1997 American {{television}} showing, {{the film}} was broadcast virtually unedited. The telecast {{was the first to}} receive a TV-M (now TV-MA) rating under the TV Parental Guidelines that had been established earlier that year. Tom Coburn, then an Oklahoma congressman, said that in airing the film, NBC had brought television [...] "to an all-time low, with full-frontal nudity, violence and profanity", adding that it was an insult to [...] "decent-minded individuals everywhere". Under fire from both Republicans and Democrats, Coburn apologized, saying, [...] "My intentions were good, but I've obviously made an error in judgment in how I've <b>gone</b> <b>about</b> saying what I wanted to say." [...] He clarified his opinion, stating that the film ought to have been aired later at night when there would not be [...] "large numbers of children watching without parental supervision".|$|E

500|$|Once the Persian {{forces in}} Europe had largely been neutralised, the Athenians {{seem to have}} <b>gone</b> <b>about</b> {{starting}} to extend the League in Asia Minor. The islands of Samos, Chios and Lesbos seem to have become members of the original Hellenic alliance after Mycale, and presumably were also therefore original members of the Delian League. However, it is unclear exactly when the other Ionian cities, or indeed the other Greek cities of Asia Minor, joined the league, though they certainly did at some point. Thucydides attests the presence of Ionians at Byzantium in 478 BC, so {{it is possible that}} at least some of the Ionian cities joined the league in early 478 BC. The Athenian politician Aristides was said to have died in Pontus (c. 468 BC) whilst on public business. Given that Aristides was responsible for organising the financial contributions of each League member, this trip may have been connected with expansion of the League into Asia Minor.|$|E
500|$|After {{taking a}} five-month hiatus at the {{beginning}} of 2006, From Autumn to Ashes returned and played the length of the 2006 Vans Warped Tour, adding Rob Lauritsen in place of Cox. In September 2006, the band rented practice space and began writing material for what would become Holding a Wolf by the Ears. Brian McTernan was chosen as producer because he had previously worked with Mark and Newton on their side project Biology's album, and the members opted for this release to have a less refined feel than the last albums. As From Autumn to Ashes prepared to begin studio recording for the album, Mark noted that Perri [...] "never came out to any of the practices and he had no involvement. But that was also the way it was when we wrote Abandon Your Friends." [...] Perri had then declared that he would no longer {{be a part of the}} band. [...] As Mark explains, [...] "I thought there was a more considerate way he could have <b>gone</b> <b>about</b> leaving the band", but it was ultimately [...] "cool of him to recognize that he just didn't have the passion for the band anymore." [...] Deciding to move on without Perri as a member, Mark then became lead vocalist, providing both clean and screaming vocals in addition to his already recorded drums. [...] Mark, as the band's lyricist explained that he [...] "work very hard and writing and revising very personal lyrics" [...] and found that a part of him did not want to hand over the lyrics to another to sing, however, with Perri's departure and when Mark began recording vocal tracks, [...] "It immediately seemed like that’s the way things had been all along". Mark stated the bulk of the album's lyrics had been [...] "just about living" [...] and [...] "the idea that extremes are dangerous." [...] Recorded in about a month's time, Holding a Wolf by the Ears was named for the quotation by Thomas Jefferson, [...] "But as it is, we have the wolf by the ear, and we can neither hold him, nor safely let him go. Justice is in one scale, and self-preservation in the other." [...] Reviewer Drew Beringer of Absolute Punk had praised the change in the band's line up, stating that [...] "Mark is three times the front man Perri was", and gave [...] "passion that had been severely lacking while Perri was in the band." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{his sermon}} in , {{delivered}} {{in the house of}} Cornelius the centurion, [...] Apostle Peter gives an overview of the ministry of Jesus, and refers to what had happened [...] "throughout all Judaea, beginning from Galilee, after the baptism which John preached" [...] and that Jesus whom [...] "God anointed with the Holy Spirit and with power" [...] had <b>gone</b> <b>about</b> [...] "doing good".|$|E
2500|$|This stanza has led {{to various}} {{scholarly}} interpretations. The [...] "holy races" [...] have been considered variously as either humanity or the gods. The notion of humanity as [...] "Heimdallr's sons" [...] is otherwise unattested and has also resulted in various interpretations. Some scholars have pointed to the prose introduction to the poem Rígsþula, where Heimdallr {{is said to have}} once <b>gone</b> <b>about</b> mankind, slept between couples, and so doled out classes among them (see Rígsthula section below).|$|E
2500|$|This {{statement}} {{met with}} strong criticism, {{as the film}} deals mainly with the Holocaust. After heavy criticism, Coburn apologized [...] "to all those I have offended" [...] and clarified that he agreed with the movie being aired on television, but stated {{that it should have}} been on later in the evening. In apologizing, Coburn said that at that time of the evening there are still large numbers of children watching without parental supervision and stated that he stood by his message of protecting children from violence, but had expressed it poorly. He also said, [...] "My intentions were good, but I've obviously made an error in judgment in how I've <b>gone</b> <b>about</b> saying what I wanted to say." ...|$|E

2500|$|Wang's {{sighting}} {{was the key}} to {{the discovery}} of Mallory's body 24 years later in the same general area, though Wang's reported description of the body he found, face up, with a [...] "hole in cheek", is not consistent with the condition and posture of Mallory's body, which was face down, its head almost completely buried in scree, and with a golf-ball-sized puncture wound on his forehead. The 2001 research expedition discovered Wang's campsite location and made an extensive search of its surroundings. Mallory's remained the only ancient body in the vicinity. Some argue it must have been Mallory, not Irvine, that Wang had found in 1975, despite the variations in body posture. Zhang said that Wang had only been <b>gone</b> <b>about</b> 20 minutes but he had waited while dozing in his sleeping bag, so Wang's stroll could have been of longer duration. Conrad Anker now believes Wang did indeed find Irvine and not Mallory.|$|E
