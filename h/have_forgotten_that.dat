25|$|If {{you accept}} that James Moore {{believed}} he won the first bicycle race, then, as he surely cannot <b>have</b> <b>forgotten</b> <b>that</b> his race was at least scheduled to be {{the second of the}} day at St Cloud, there must have been either something different about the first race – e.g. it was not exclusively for pedal machines – or the order of the events was changed so that his race took place first. My hypothesis assumes the former proposition, and is only partly reliant on whether the rules stated that the front wheels of the velocipedes in the second race were to be precisely 1 metre diameter as stated in your article. My main argument, however, is that the word velocipede was used generically to include all types of machine including even hobby-horses for which it was originally coined. They would surely have had wheels of less than one metre diameter.|$|E

I spend 50 percent of my time working with David." [...] She had, in 1974, guest-starred in a two-part episode of Carradine's {{television}} series Kung Fu. She played, {{under the direction of}} Carradine, a love interest to his character, Kwai Chang Caine, during his time at the Shaolin temple. She also appeared in two of Carradine's independent directorial projects, You and Me (1975) and Americana (1983), both of which had been filmed in 1973. Her father, Arnold Herzstein, also appeared in Americana.|$|E

500|$|In 1997, Morrison {{released}} The Healing Game. The album received mixed reviews, {{with the}} lyrics being described as [...] "tired" [...] and [...] "dull", though critic Greil Marcus praised the musical {{complexity of the}} album by saying: [...] "It carries the listener into a musical home so perfect and complete {{he or she might}} <b>have</b> <b>forgotten</b> <b>that</b> music could call up such a place, and then populate it with people, acts, wishes, fears." [...] The following year, Morrison finally released some of his previously unissued studio recordings in a two-disc set, The Philosopher's Stone. His next release, 1999's Back on Top, achieved a modest success, being his highest charting album in the US since 1978's Wavelength.|$|E
500|$|In Doctor Who Magazine issue 460, Graham Kibble-White {{gave it a}} mixed review. He complimented {{the fact}} that [...] "the action kicks off early - very early - and then doesn't let up", and said the Ice Warrior {{redesign}} was [...] "the best reinvention so far of an old Doctor Who foe, although admitting {{he thought it was}} [...] "a shame to lose the tufts of hair around the joints", saying they gave the Ice Warriors [...] "a pleasing organic feel upon the shell." [...] He complained about the reference to the Ice Warriors' code of honour, claiming it to have always been [...] "damnably dull." [...] Additionally, he disliked the revelation of Skaldak's true form, claiming it to look like [...] "a not especially memorable CGI tortoise" [...] and saying the BBC seems to <b>have</b> <b>forgotten</b> <b>that</b> [...] "monsters are diminished when they're brought into the light", as well as worrying that it may have been [...] "breaking a taboo for the show".|$|E
500|$|Late in September, a British convoy {{consisting}} of 13 battered ships under Captain Sir James Saumarez appeared off the island. Survivors of the Battle of the Nile, {{they were in}} urgent need of repair and unable to directly assist in the siege. Nevertheless, Saumarez met {{with representatives of the}} Maltese and on 25 September, sent an offer of truce to Vaubois on their behalf. Vaubois replied [...] "Vous avez, sans doute, oublié que des Français sont dans la place. Le sort des habitans [...] ne vous regarde pointe. Quant à votre sommation, les soldats français ne sont point habitués à ce style" [...] ("You might <b>have</b> <b>forgotten</b> <b>that</b> the French hold this place. The fate of the inhabitants is none of your concern. As for your ultimatum, French soldiers are not accustomed to such a tone"). Unable to persuade the French to give in, Saumarez instead provided the Maltese forces with 1,200 muskets with which to continue the siege. Saumarez, unable to delay repairs any longer, sailed for Gibraltar {{at the end of the}} month.|$|E

500|$|Responses from {{critics have}} given mostly average {{reviews of the}} album. Polly Coufos from The Sunday Times {{considers}} Damien Leith as [...] "the most complete artist Australian Idol has yet uncovered". Coufos rated the album 3.5 stars, and comments that [...] "Leith uses that heavenly falsetto {{as often as possible}} without making himself appear a one-trick pony". Coufos, however says that the two cover songs, [...] "Songbird" [...] and [...] "Danny Boy" [...] are an [...] "unnecessary hedging of bets". Andrew Murfett from The Age notices the album's different arrangement from the previous Idol debuts and considers it to be better than those, but says that the album still contains too many ballad songs. Murfett remarks [...] "Songbird" [...] as a good choice for a cover song. Lauren Katulka from 'Oz Music Scene' compliments Leith's songwriting and composing, and says that Where We Land [...] "is a great indication of the potential of Australia's revamped Idol franchise". Lucy Tyler from the Sydney Anglican Network says that though the album is well-produced; it is unbalanced and bland, and [...] "its lack of variety means that it gives listeners little to think about". Tyler notes that Where We Land focuses on the melancholic aspects of life and remarks that [...] "Leith appears to <b>have</b> <b>forgotten</b> <b>that</b> life can sometimes be happy, too".|$|E
500|$|Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from gaming critics. Most critics acknowledged that Warriors of Rock {{was an attempt}} to distance itself from its competitor, the Rock Band series, and a return to the Guitar Hero series' roots. However, in the attempt to redefine the series, some critics thought Warriors of Rock failed to recapture the experience of playing the earlier Guitar Hero games. Arthur Gies of IGN felt the game was [...] "aimless", leaving him to question [...] "why Warriors of Rock is here". Tyler Cocke of 1UP.com commented that Warriors of Rock [...] "seems to <b>have</b> <b>forgotten</b> <b>that</b> music games are supposed to be all about having a good time". Ben Kurchera of Ars Technica considered that Warriors of Rock keeps the series [...] "treading water" [...] and lacks [...] "any real upward movement", and may have been a step back with how relaxed the game's timing windows have become compared to early Guitar Hero games. Others note that the game can be enjoyable, but only to those that are fans of the series, and is not well-suited to new or casual players. G4's Abbie Heppe found the game [...] "does an exceptional job of catering to the hardcore audience" [...] but warns the casual fan that may not enjoy the setlist to simply [...] "move along". Matt Helgeson of Game Informer postulated if Guitar Hero may have jumped the shark with the [...] "often stupid and frequently silly" [...] gameplay and visuals, but was still entertained in playing through the game.|$|E
500|$|On the film's Rotten Tomatoes listing, 57% {{of critics}} gave the film {{positive}} reviews from {{a total of}} 23 reviews. DVD Authority says [...] "After this one, the other Jaws movies seemed to just not be as good." [...] One review says: [...] "it's obviously not a patch on Spielberg's classic, but it's {{about as good as}} could be hoped for, with some excellent sequences, almost worthy of the original, several genuine shocks, a different enough story and some pretty decent characters." [...] The performances of Scheider, Gary and Hamilton are particularly praised. George Morris for the Texas Monthly preferred Jaws 2 over the original because it is [...] "less insidious in its methods of manipulation" [...] and [...] "because director Jeannot Szwarc streamlines the terror ... By crosscutting among the teenagers, Scheider, and the officials' efforts to rescue them, Szwarc works up enough suspense to keep the adrenaline going." [...] However, Morris' review is not entirely complimentary. He would have preferred the shark to have been seen less, positing [...] "producers and audiences alike seem to <b>have</b> <b>forgotten</b> <b>that</b> the greatest suspense derives from the unseen and the unknown, and that the imagination is capable of conceiving far worse than the materialization of a mere mechanical monster." [...] Similarly, John Simon felt that the [...] "shark's waning is caused by a decline in direction: Jeannot Szwarc has none of Steven Spielberg's manipulative cleverness. For one thing, he allows us close and disarming close-ups of the shark almost immediately..."Simon praises Scheider and Hamilton, but is less complimentary about Gary. A reviewer for the BBC complained that the additional screen time awarded to the shark makes it [...] "seems far less terrifying than its almost mystical contemporary". [...] The Radio Times was not pleased with Jaws 2, calling it a [...] "pale imitation of the classic original" [...] and stating that [...] "the suspense comes unglued because the film floats in all-too-familiar waters. You just know how everyone is going to react — from the stars to the director, and even the mechanical shark." ...|$|E

2500|$|However, the {{reception}} was, on the whole, lukewarm compared to some earlier works.

2500|$|In 2003, the Bush Administration {{attempted}} {{to create an}} agency to oversee Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The bill never made progress in Congress, facing sharp opposition by Democrats. In 2005, the Republican controlled House of Representatives passed a GSE reform bill (Federal Housing Finance Reform Act) which [...] "would have created a stronger regulator with new powers to increase capital at Fannie and Freddie, to limit their portfolios {{and to deal with}} the possibility of receivership". However, the Bush administration opposed the bill and it died in the Senate. Of the bill and its reception by the Bush White House, Ohio Republican Mike Oxley (the bill's author) said: [...] "The critics <b>have</b> <b>forgotten</b> <b>that</b> the House passed a GSE reform bill in 2005 that could well have prevented the current crisis. All the handwringing and bedwetting is going on without remembering how the House stepped up on this. What did we get from the White House? We got a one-finger salute." [...] The Bush economic policy regarding Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac changed during the economic downturn of 2008, culminating in the federal takeover of the two largest lenders in the mortgage market. Further economic challenges have resulted in the Bush administration attempting an economic intervention, through a requested $700 billion bailout package for Wall Street investment houses.|$|E
2500|$|On August 8, 2013, Lavabit, a Texas-based secure email service {{provider}} reportedly used by Snowden, abruptly {{announced it was}} shutting down operations after nearly 10 years of business. The owner, Ladar Levison, posted a statement online saying he would rather {{go out of business}} than [...] "become complicit in crimes against the American people." [...] He also said that he was barred by law from disclosing what he had experienced over the preceding 6 weeks, and that he was appealing the case in the U.S. Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. Multiple sources speculated that the timing of the statement suggested that Lavabit had been targeted by the US government in its pursuit of information about Snowden. The following day, a similar email service, Silent Circle, preemptively shut down in order to [...] "prevent spying". Snowden said about the Lavabit closure, [...] "Ladar Levison and his team suspended the operations of their 10-year-old business rather than violate the Constitutional rights of their roughly 400,000 users. The President, Congress, and the Courts <b>have</b> <b>forgotten</b> <b>that</b> the costs of bad policy are always borne by ordinary citizens, and it is our job to remind them that there are limits to what we will pay." [...] He said that [...] "internet titans" [...] like Google should ask themselves why they weren't [...] "fighting for our interests the same way small businesses are." ...|$|E
2500|$|For example, when Edward and Richard {{are urging}} York {{to break his}} oath to Henry, Edward says, [...] "But for a kingdom, any oath may be broken;/I would break a {{thousand}} oaths to reign one year" [...] (1.2.16–17), thus showing the attraction that power has for the characters, and what {{they would be willing}} to do to attain it. Later, echoing Warwick's statement about his reasons for joining the Lancastrians, Richard outlines why he has remained loyal to the Yorkists; [...] "I stay not for the love of Edward but the crown" [...] (4.1.125), again showing the attraction of power and the subversion of all other concerns, including familial relations. Another example is when Prince Edward is killed in Act 5, Scene 5. His death is brought about because he taunts the Plantagenet brothers, and they lose their temper with him, not because they are exacting revenge for an ongoing feud with his family. Similarly, when Richard kills Henry, his motives have nothing to do with the conflict between his family and Henry's. He murders him simply because Henry stands in the way of his attempts to gain the throne. As Michael Hattaway writes, [...] "family loyalties may have been the initial cause of the feuds, but an audience watching 3 Henry VI is likely to feel that individual ambition rather than family honour is what fuels the vendettas that inform the play. Both [...] seem to <b>have</b> <b>forgotten</b> <b>that</b> the quarrel between [...] originally was a dynastic one: their claims to legitimacy and authority in this play are now validated only by the forces they can muster" [...] As Jane Howell, director of the BBC Shakespeare adaptation argues, [...] "anarchy is loosed and you're left with a very different set of values – every man for himself. You're into a time of change in which there is no code except survival of the fittest – who happens to be Richard." ...|$|E
