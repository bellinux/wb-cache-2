25|$|Africa has {{significant}} resources for generating energy in several forms (hydroelectric, reserves of petroleum and <b>gas,</b> <b>coal</b> production, uranium production, renewable energy such as solar and geothermal). The lack {{of development and}} infrastructure means that little of this potential is actually in use today. The largest consumers of electric power in Africa are South Africa, Libya, Namibia, Egypt, Tunisia, and Zimbabwe, which each consume between 1000 and 5000 KWh/m2 per person, in contrast with African states such as Ethiopia, Eritrea, and Tanzania, where electricity consumption per person is negligible.|$|E
25|$|Along {{with other}} fossil fuels, coal {{is a major}} energy {{resource}} for the U.S. Most of the energy supplied by coal production is consumed by the electric power sector. Due to competition with renewable energy and natural <b>gas,</b> <b>coal</b> production has been declining since 2008. Currently the U.S. occupies five major basins or regions where coal is produced. The U.S. Energy Information Administration released coal production data of 2016 in January, reporting a 17% decrease from 2015 levels. As coal is projected to remain a key energy resource, regulations concerning environmental pollution increase.|$|E

25|$|A {{criticism}} {{is that the}} BRIC projections {{are based on the}} assumptions that resources are limitless and endlessly available when needed. In reality, many important resources currently necessary to sustain economic growth, such as oil, natural <b>gas,</b> <b>coal,</b> other fossil fuels, and uranium might soon experience a peak in production before enough renewable energy can be developed and commercialized, which might result in slower economic growth than anticipated, thus throwing off the projections and their dates. The economic emergence of the BRICs will have unpredictable consequences for the global environment. Indeed, proponents of a set carrying capacity for the Earth may argue that, given current technology, there is a finite limit to how much the BRICs can develop before exceeding the ability of the global economy to supply.|$|E
25|$|At {{the start}} of the war, in August 1914, Amiens had been the Advance Base for the British Expeditionary Force. It was {{captured}} by the German Army on 31 August 1914, but recaptured by the French on 28 September. The proximity of Amiens to the Western Front and its importance as a rail hub, made it a vital British logistic centre, especially during the Battle of the Somme in 1916. The city was to the immediate rear of the Allied front during most of the war. With 93,000 inhabitants at {{the start of}} the war, the population increased to 110,000 during the conflict because of the presence of Allied troops. The population and industries suffered heavy privations (<b>gas,</b> <b>coal,</b> bread, etc.), leading to several strikes, twenty-five alone in 1917. Facing regular bombings, the municipality implemented measures for the protection of historical monuments, such as the cathedral, as early as 1915.|$|E
