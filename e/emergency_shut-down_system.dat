Its geometrical complexity and (e. g., oblique Control Rods, Positive Void coefficient) required a developed and validated complex three dimensional (3 D) neutron kinetics (NK) coupled thermal hydraulic (TH) model. Reactor shut-down is obtained by oblique CRs and, during accidental conditions, by an <b>emergency</b> <b>shut-down</b> <b>system</b> (JDJ) injecting a highly concentrated boron solution (boron clouds) in the moderator tank, the boron clouds reconstruction is obtained using a CFD (CFX) code calculation.

Since all-ceramic turbine vanes would be a very large and risky development step, Westinghouse is considering to protect the leading edges of turbine vanes with high-performance ceramics. This might be done by either replacing the leading edge with a suitably shaped ceramic part, or by modifying the vanes such that they can accommodate ceramic inserts. Among the most important criteria for the success of ceramics in such applications are (a) thermodynamic compatibility with the turbine vane alloy, (b) sufficient thermal shock resistance to survive the thermal cycling during operation and in particular during <b>emergency</b> <b>shut-down,</b> and a design considering the thermal expansion mismatch of the metallic and ceramic components.

40|$|Thesis (MScEng (Mechanical and Mechatronic Engineering)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2010. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: A {{reactor cavity}} cooling system (RCCS) {{is used in}} the PBMR to protect the {{concrete}} citadel surrounding the reactor from direct nuclear radiation impingement and heat. The speci ed maximum operating temperature of the concrete structure is 65 ±C for normal operating conditions and 125 ±C for <b>emergency</b> <b>shut-down</b> conditions. A conceptual design of an entirely passive RCCS suitable for the PBMR was done by using closed loop thermosyphon heat pipes (CLTHPs) to remove heat from a radiation heat shield over a horizontal distance to an annular cooling dam placed around the PBMR. The radiation shield is placed in the air space between the Reactor Pressure Vessel (RPV) and the concrete citadel, 180 mm from the concrete citadel. A theoretical heat transfer model of the RCCS was created. The theoretical model was used to develop a computer program to simulate the transient RCCS response during normal reactor operation, when the RCCS must remove the excess generated heat from the reactor cavity and during <b>emergency</b> <b>shut-down</b> conditions, when the RCCS must remove the decay heat from the reactor cavity. The main purpose of the theoretical model is to predict the surface temperature of the concrete citadel for di erent heat generation modes in the reactor core and ambient conditions. The theoretical model assumes a 1 D geometry of the RCCS. Heat transfer by both radiation and convection from the RPV to the radiation heat shield (HS) is calculated. The heat shield is modelled as a n. The n e ciency was determined with the experimental work. Conduction through the n is considered in the horizontal direction only. The concrete structure surface is heated by radiation from the outer surface of the heat shield as well as by convection heat transfer from the air between the heat shield and the concrete structure surface. The modelling of the natural convection closed loop thermosyphon heat pipes in the RCCS is done by using the Boussinesq approximation and the homogeneous ow model. An experiment was built to verify the theoretical model. The experiment is a full scale model of the PBMR in the horizontal, or main heat transfer, direction, but is only a 2 m high section. The experiments showed that the convection heat transfer between the RPV and the HS cannot be modelled with simple natural convection theory. A Nusselt number correlation developed especially for natural convection in enclosed rectangles found in literature was used to model the convection heat transfer. The Nusselt number was approximately 3 times higher than that which classic convection theory suggested. An optimisation procedure was developed where 121 di erent combinations of n sizes and heat pipe sizes could be used to construct a RCCS once a cooling dam size was chosen. The purpose of the optimisation was to nd the RCCS with the lowest total mass. A cooling dam with a diameter of 50 m was chosen. The optimal RCCS radiation heat shield that operates with the working uid only in single phase has 243 closed loop thermosyphon heat pipes constructed from 62. 72 mm ID pipes and 25 mm wide atbar ns. The total mass of the single phase RCCS is 225 tons. The maximum concrete structure temperature is 62. 5 ±C under normal operating conditions, 65. 8 ±C during a PLOFC <b>emergency</b> <b>shut-down</b> condition and 80. 9 ±C during a DLOFC <b>emergency</b> <b>shut-down</b> condition. In the case where one CLTHP fails and the adjacent two must compensate for the loss of cooling capacity, the maximum concrete structure temperature for a DLOFC <b>emergency</b> <b>shut-down</b> will be 87. 4 ±C. This is 37. 6 ±C below the speci ed maximum temperature of 125 ±C. The RCCS design is further improved when boiling of the working uid is induced in the CLTHP. The optimal RCCS radiation heat shield that operates with the working uid in a liquid-vapour mixture, or two phase ow, has 338 closed loop thermosyphon heat pipes constructed from 38. 1 mm ID pipes and 20 mm wide atbar ns. The total mass of the two phase RCCS is 198 tons, 27 tons less than the single phase RCCS. The maximum concrete structure temperature is 60 ±C under normal operating conditions, 2. 5 ±C below that of the single phase RCCS. During a PLOFC <b>emergency</b> <b>shut-down</b> condition, the maximum concrete structure temperature is 62. 3 ±C, 3. 5 ±C below that of the single phase RCCS and still below the normal operating temperature of the single phase RCCS. By inducing two phase ow in the CLTHP, the maximum temperature of the working uid is xed equal to the saturation temperature of the working uid at the vacuum pressure. This property of water is used to limit the concrete structure temperature. This e ect is seen in the transient response of the RCCS where the concrete structure temperature increases until boiling of the working uid starts and then the concrete structure temperature becomes constant irrespective of the heat load on the RCCS. An increased heat load increases the quality of the working uid liquid-vapour mixture. Working uid qualities approaching unity causes numerical instabilities in the theoretical model. The theoretical model cannot capture the heat transfer to a control volume with a density lower than approximately 20 kg/m 3. This limits {{the extent to which the}} two phase RCCS can be optimised. Recommendations are made relating to future work on how to improve the theoretical model in particular the convection modelling in the reactor cavities as well as the two phase ow of the working uid. Further recommendations are made on how to improve the basic design of the heat shield as well as the cooling section of the CLTHPs. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: 'n Reaktor lug spasie verkoelingstelsel (RLSVS) word in die PBMR gebruik om die beton wat die reaktor omring te beskerm teen direkte stralingskade en hitte. Die gespesi seerde maksimum temperatuur van die beton is 65 ±C onder normale bedryfstoestande en 125 ±C gedurende die noodtoestand afskakeling van die reaktor. 'n Konseptuele ontwerp van 'n geheel en al passiewe RLSVS geskik vir die PBMR is gedoen deur gebruik te maak van geslote lus termo-sifon (GLTSe) om hitte van die stralingskerm te verwyder oor a horisontale afstand na 'n ringvormige verkoelingsdam wat rondom die reaktor geposisioneer is. Die stralingskerm word in die lug spasie tussen die reaktor drukvat (RDV) en die beton geplaas, 180 mm vanaf die beton. 'n Teoretiese hitteoordrag model van die RLSVS was geskep. Die teoretiese model was gebruik vir die ontwikkeling van 'n rekenaar program wat die transiënte gedrag van die RLSVS sal simuleer gedurende normale bedryfstoestande, waar die oorskot gegenereerde hitte verwyder moet word vanuit die reaktor lug spasie, asook gedurende noodtoestand afskakeling van die reaktor, waar die afnemingshitte verwyder moet word. Die primêre doel van die teoretiese model is om the oppervlak temperatuur van die beton te voorspel onder verskillende bedryfstoestande asook verskillende omgewingstoestande. Die teoretiese model aanvaar 'n 1 D geometrie van die RLSVS. Hitte oordrag d. m. v. straling asook konveksie vanaf die RDV na die stralingskerm word bereken. The stralingskerm word gemodelleer as 'n vin. Die vin doeltre endheid was bepaal met die eksperimente wat gedoen was. Hitte geleiding in die vin was slegs bereken in die horisontale rigting. Die beton word verhit deur straling vanaf die agterkant van die stralingskerm asook deur konveksie vanaf die lug tussen die stralingskerm en die beton. The modellering van die natuurlike konveksie GLTS hitte pype word gedoen deur om gebruik te maak van die Boussinesq benadering en die homogene vloei model. 'n Eksperiment was vervaardig om the teoretiese model te veri eer. Die eksperiment is 'n volskaal model van die PBMR in die horisontale, of hoof hitteoordrag, rigting, maar is net 'n 2 m hoë snit. Die eksperimente het gewys dat die konveksie hitte oordrag tussen die RDV en die stralingskerm nie met gewone konveksie teorie gemodelleer kan word nie. 'n Nusselt getal uitdrukking wat spesi ek ontwikkel is vir natuurlike konveksie in geslote, reghoekige luggapings wat in die literatuur gevind was, was gebruik om die konveksie hitteoordrag te modelleer. Die Nusselt getal was ongeveer 3 maal groter as wat klassieke konveksie teorie voorspel het. 'n Optimeringsprosedure was ontwikkel waar 121 verskillende kombinasies van vin breedtes en pyp groottes wat gebruik kan word om 'n RLSVS te vervaardig nadat 'n toepaslike verkoelingsdam diameter gekies is. Die doel van die optimering was om die RLSVS te ontwerp wat die laagste totale massa het. 'n Verkoelingsdam diameter van 50 m was gekies. Die optimale RLSVS stralingskerm, waarvan die vloeier slegs in die vloeistof fase bly, bestaan uit 243 GLTSe wat van 62. 72 mm binne diameter pype vervaardig is met 25 mm breë vinne. The totale massa van die enkel fase RLSVS is 225 ton. Die maksimum beton temperatuur is 62. 5 ±C vir normale bedryfstoestande, 65. 8 ±C vir 'n PLOFC noodtoestand afskakeling en is 80. 9 ±C vir 'n DLOFC noodtoestand afskakeling. In die geval waar een GLTS faal gedurende 'n DLOFC noodtoestand afskakeling en die twee naasgeleë GLTSe moet kompenseer vir die vermindering in verkoelings kapasiteit, is die maksimum beton temperatuur 87. 4 ±C. Dit is 37. 6 ±C laer as die gespesi seerde maksimum temperatuur van 125 ±C. Die RLSVS ontwerp kan verder verbeter word wanneer die vloeier in die GLTSe kook. Die optimale RLSVS stralingskerm met die vloeier wat kook, of in twee fase vloei is, bestaan uit 338 GLTSe wat van 38. 1 mm binne diameter pype vervaardig is met 20 mm breë vinne. The totale massa van die twee fase vloei RLSVS is 198 ton, 27 ton ligter as die enkel fase RLSVS. Die maksimum beton temperatuur is 60 ±C vir normale bedryfstoestande, 2. 5 ±C laer as die enkel fase RLSVS. Gedurende 'n PLOFC noodtoestand afskakeling is die maksimum beton temperatuur 62. 3 ±C, 3. 5 ±C laer as die enkel fase RLSVS en nogtans onder die maksimum beton temperatuur van die enkel fase RLSVS vir normale bedryfstoestande. Deur om koking te veroorsaak in die GLTS word die maksimum temperatuur van die vloeier vasgepen gelyk aan die versadigings temperatuur van die vloeier by die vakuüm druk. Hierdie einskap van water word gebruik om 'n limiet te sit op die maksimum temperatuur van die beton. Hierdie e ek kan gesien word in die transiënte gedrag van die RLSVS waar die beton temperatuur styg tot en met koking plaasvind en dan konstant raak ongeag van die hitte belasting op die RLSVS. 'n Toename in die hitte belasting veroorsaak net 'n toename in die kwaliteit van die vloeistof-gas mengsel. Mengsel kwaliteite van 1 nader veroorsaak numeriese onstabiliteite in die teoretiese model. The teoretiese model kan nie die hitteoordrag beskryf na 'n kontrole volume wat 'n digtheid het laer as ongeveer 20 kg/m 3. Hierdie plaas 'n limiet op die optimering van die twee fase RLSVS. Aanbevelings was gemaak met betrekking tot toekomstige werk aangaande die verbetering van die teoretiese model met spesi eke klem op die modellering van konveksie in die reaktor asook die modellering van twee fase vloei. Verdere aanbevelings was gemaak aangaande die verbetering van die stralingskerm ontwerp asook die ontwerp van die verkoeling van die GLTSe...|$|R

40|$|The areas {{reviewed}} {{in this section}} of the applicant's safety analysis report (SAR) include those instrumentation and control systems-associated with systems used to achieve and maintain a safe shutdown condition of the plant. To the extent that the engineered safety feature (ESF) systems are used to achieve and maintain safe shutdown, the review of these systems in this section is limited to those features which are unique to safe shutdown and not directly related to accident mitigation. Such features may involve individual component control for safe shutdown versus sytem level actuation for accident mitigation or system operating modes which involve considerations which differ for safe shutdown and accident mitigation. This SRP section also addresses the review of those systems required for safe shutdown which are not classified as ESF systems. The specific arrangement of these systems depends on the type of plant (pressurized water reactor, PWR; boiling water reactor, BWR; etc.) as well as on individual plant design features, and the conditions under. which the safe shutdown has to be achieved and maintained. The functional performance requirements of safe <b>shut-down</b> <b>systems</b> and essential auxiliary supporting systems are reviewed by other branches in accordance with the SRP sections which address these systems. There are two kinds of shutdown conditions: hot shutdown and cold shutdown. In either case, it is necessary that reactivity control systems maintain a sub-critical condition of the core and that residual heat removal systems operate to maintain adequate cooling of the core. For a precise definition of both shutdown conditions for a specific plant, see Chapter 16, "Technical Specifications, " in the applicant's safety analysis report (SAR).

40|$|Concurrent {{processing}} {{has become}} the default mode of operation in on-chip systems. Silicon has become cheap enough for having hardware facilities to support very large scale concurrent processing on chip. As a result the availability and applicability of power is becoming more of a limiting factor than logic for on-chip systems. However, the advantage of parallelism in reducing power consumption will soon become unrealistic because of the limited scope of reducing Vdd beyond threshold voltage, leaving the reduction of concurrency (through the partial <b>shut-down</b> of <b>system</b> blocks) as a realistic means of reducing power consumption when needed. A stochastic modelling approach is {{presented in this paper}} which can integrate the degree of concurrency as a parameter into power and latency analysis. This will facilitate a system design and management regime where the degree of concurrency is used as a means of control to achieve power and performance goals. 1...|$|R

The deposition and gelation of waxy oil pose great flow assurance risks, especially in submarine oil pipeline. Even though {{there have been a}} lot of studies and breakthroughs in understanding the wax precipitation and deposition in the past few years, there still continue to be some challenges that have remained unsolved. In order to well understand the rheological property of the crude oil, First of all, the issue need to be solved is study the wax precipitation property of the oil. In this paper, an accurate model of wax precipitation in laboratory condition undergoing a cooling process is established. And then we predicted the wax appearance temperature, pour point and the weight of the wax appearance about the oil sample. Here, the calculated results of model are much close to the experimental values, which shows that the model of wax precipitation developed is correct and reasonable. By accurate prediction the WAT, pour point, we can well understand the rheological property, which will help the operators make an impeccable flow restart plan for the planned or <b>emergency</b> production <b>shut-down</b> of waxy oil pipelines...|$|R

40|$|Deep water {{offshore}} wind is a vast, reliable and economical energy source. Floating {{offshore wind}} turbines are potential systems to capture this energy which {{need to be}} analysed and designed {{in order to achieve}} economic productions and deployments, reliable operation, and adequate service life. Application of floating offshore wind turbines has been limited to research area yet and there are still many challenges and questions that need to be answered by researchers and industries. The primary challenge is the electricity production cost, which needs to be lowered to make it competitive. This can be achieved by increasing the capacity factor, availability and reliability of the sub-systems and the total life-time of the system. In this regards floating offshore wind turbines have to be designed for all the normal and abnormal operational and environmental conditions. In the work presented in this thesis, the effects of two abnormal conditions on the performance and responses of a land-based and a spar-type floating wind turbines have been studied. These include: atmospheric icing as an abnormal environmental condition and malfunction in the controller sub-system as a system fault. The aero-hydro-servoelastic code HAWC 2 was used as a main analysis tool for this study. The NREL 5 -MW reference wind turbine was considered as a test case in this work. To study the first problem, the atmospheric ice accretion on the wind turbine blades was simulated with the NASA panel code LEWICE. A sensitivity analysis was performed to investigate the role of different atmospheric and system parameters on the ice profile geometry and ice mass distribution. A 24 -hours unsteady atmospheric ice accretion was simulated on the NREL 5 -MW wind turbine blades. The aerodynamic degradation of airfoil sections due to icing were estimated with the CFD code FLUENT. The numerical results for a few samples were validated against wind tunnel tests. The effect of atmospheric icing on the power production, load and responses and short-term fatigue damage of a land-based wind turbine were studied. Further the effect of atmospheric icing on the overall performance and extreme responses of a spar-type floating wind turbine, during power production, normal and <b>emergency</b> <b>shut-down,</b> extreme operation gust and survival conditions were studied. To address the second problem, the author has studied the published information on reliability analysis of different wind turbine sub-systems. The controller system is found {{to be one of the}} most unreliable sub-systems in a wind turbine. To evaluate the effect of controller malfunctions on the responses of the wind turbines, a few fault cases in the wind turbine controller system were modelled and the responses of both a land-based and a spar-type floating wind turbines were simulated under these fault conditions and compared. The faults include: three fault cases in the rotary encoders and two fault cases in the pitch actuator. Effects of faults on the wind turbine responses at different operational condition were studied. The extreme responses and fatigue damage under the fault conditions were compared with normal operational and extreme conditions defined in IEC 61400 - 3. The dissertation is based on articles published or accepted for publication or submitted in/to scientific conferences and journals, together with a synopsis explaining the background for the under taken research and methods used.

We focus on generator stator isolation inter-turn fault that can be characterized before triggering the safety device and applied for any type of generator used in wind turbines. A low complexity model predictive tracking controller is proposed to achieve very accurate flux modulation that prevents the fault propagation while power delivery under fault is deteriorated as less as possible compared to healthy machine conditions. Presented fault-tolerant control strategy is developed taking into account its modular implementation and installation in available control systems of existing wind turbines to extend their life cycle and energy production.
