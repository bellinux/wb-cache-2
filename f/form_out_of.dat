5|$|Miller's form {{mirrored}} {{the rest of}} the Hibs team as it went into a slump in 2010, leading to the departure of Hughes. New manager Colin Calderwood signed three new midfielders in January 2011 and left Miller out of the starting lineup for two games soon afterwards. Calderwood expressed hope that improved results would bring better <b>form</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Miller, who he described as a top-level player. Miller expressed a desire to stay at Hibs in March 2011, but the two parties did not agree a new contract, which allowed him to leave the club.|$|E

Around the seal was an inscription «Печать славного Війська Запорізького Низового» (The Seal of the glorious Zaporizhian Host). Palanka's and kurin's seals were either round or rectangular with images of lions, deers, horses, moon, stars, crowns, lances, sabers, and bows.|$|E

25|$|Hurricanes pose {{a severe}} threat during {{hurricane}} season, which lasts from June 1 to November 30, although some storms {{have been known}} to <b>form</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> season. Florida is the most hurricane-prone US state, with subtropical or tropical water on a lengthy coastline. From 1851 to 2006, Florida has been struck by 114 hurricanes, 37 of them major—category 3 and above. It is rare for a hurricane season to pass without any impact in the state by at least a tropical storm. For storms, category 4 or higher, 83% have either hit Florida or Texas. August to October is the most likely period for a hurricane in Florida.|$|E
25|$|The entire landmass of Southern California was {{subdivided}} {{according to}} the San Bernardino Meridian, which was first plotted {{as part of the}} Public Land Survey System in November 1852, by Col. Henry Washington. Base Line road, a major thoroughfare, today runs from Highland to San Dimas, intermittently along the absolute baseline coordinates plotted by Col. Washington. San Bernardino County was first formed out of parts of Los Angeles County on April 26, 1853. While the partition once included what is today most of Riverside County, the region is not as monolithic as it may sound. Rivalries between Colton, Redlands, Riverside and San Bernardino over the location of the county seat in the 1890s caused each of them to form their own civic communities, each with their own newspapers. On August 14, 1893, the state Senate allowed Riverside County to <b>form</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> land previously in San Bernardino and San Diego counties, after rejecting a bill for Pomona to split from L.A. County and become the seat of what would have been called San Antonio County.|$|E
25|$|It {{is common}} for two or more {{separate}} open clusters to <b>form</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the same molecular cloud. In the Large Magellanic Cloud, both Hodge 301 and R136 are forming from the gases of the Tarantula Nebula, while in our own galaxy, tracing back the motion through space of the Hyades and Praesepe, two prominent nearby open clusters, suggests that they formed in the same cloud about 600 million years ago. Sometimes, two clusters born {{at the same time}} will form a binary cluster. The best known example in the Milky Way is the Double Cluster of NGC 869 and NGC 884 (sometimes mistakenly called h and χ Persei; h refers to a neighboring star and χ to both clusters), but at least 10 more double clusters are known to exist. Many more are known in the Small and Large Magellanic Clouds—they are easier to detect in external systems than in our own galaxy because projection effects can cause unrelated clusters within the Milky Way to appear close to each other.|$|E

500|$|Critic Robert B. Stepto {{states that}} the poem [...] "One More Round", in And Still I Rise is heavily {{influenced}} by the work and protest songs of the past. The even-number stanzas in the eight-stanza poem create a refrain like those found in many work songs and are variations of many protest poems. Stepto is impressed with Angelou's {{creation of a new}} art <b>form</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> work and protest forms, but does not feel that she develops it enough. He places Angelou's work in the tradition of other Black poets, and compares the poems in And Still I Rise to the works of Langston Hughes, Gwendolyn Brooks, and Sterling Brown. Stepto also praises Angelou for borrowing [...] "various folk rhythms and forms and thereby buttresses her poems by evoking aspects of a culture's written and unwritten heritage". Despite Angelou's strong criticism of racism, she also asserted in all her writings what Hagen calls a recurring theme, that [...] "we are more alike than unalike".|$|E

2500|$|In the 1980s, white-collar criminals {{began to}} be perp-walked as well, as federal {{prosecutors}} saw the public-relations value of the practice. During his tenure as United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, Rudolph Giuliani often had Wall Street investment bankers perp-walked. Defendants such as Richard Wigton, a Kidder Peabody trader accused of insider trading, were arrested at their place of business and walked off a trading floor in handcuffs with a uniformed police escort, as Charlie Sheen's character Bud Fox is in Oliver Stone's 1987 film Wall Street. [...] "Rudy Giuliani made an art <b>form</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> [...] ", says Loyola Law School professor Laurie Levenson. Former Manhattan district attorney Robert Morgenthau agrees, calling Giuliani [...] "the master of the perp walk".|$|E
2500|$|At {{the end of}} {{this season}} Laurel Martyn left the company to <b>form,</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the {{original}} Melbourne Ballet Club, the Victorian Ballet Guild. Her choice of a small, experimental dance company over the glamorous professional stage highlighted the dilemma Borovansky faced. Borovansky had built a [...] "strong, commercially attractive operation {{on the basis of the}} school run by his wife and a keen sense of what the public would pay to see". However, as his company was funded by J. C. Williamson's, they dictated what the company could do. Borovansky's company had expanded and now included such dancers as Paul Hammond, Martin Rubinstein, Leon Kellaway, Peggy Sager, Kathleen Gorham, Vassilie Trunoff and Edna Busse. For the next 18 months, the company (now called the Borovansky Ballet) became the dance-chorus for two operettas and toured New Zealand a second time while also holding seasons of Coppélia and other favourites. The company was disbanded in 1948 due to lack of financial backing.|$|E
