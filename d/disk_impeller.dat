40|$|This study models a {{high shear}} {{granulation}} system, including both dense and dilute regions. The dense region is modeled using an approach {{in which the}} system is treated as a visco-plastic fluid and the rheology of such a fluid is evaluated. The dilute regions are modeled by the standard Kinetic Theory of Granular Flow (KTGF). The switching between the models is accounted for by using the dimensionless inertial number, defined as the ratio shear forces/pressure forces. The results compare favorably with experimental data for a <b>disk</b> <b>impeller</b> high shear granulator. Granular temperatures and volume fractions, in particular, are well captured by the aforementioned model.

40|$|Abstract. The turbo {{machinery}} {{design has}} evolved {{rapidly in the}} last 50 years. The development {{in the design of}} any turbo machinery involves interdisciplinary process, namely stress analysis, vibration analysis, fluid dynamics, thermodynamics and the material selection. One of the major and common analyses used in the development of any mechanical part subjected to dynamic loading is the modal analysis. In this paper, the dynamic characteristics of an impeller of a centrifugal pump were studied. The dynamics characteristics studied were limited to the natural frequencies and the mode shapes. The impeller chosen for the study was a single-entry impeller with radial vanes. Finite element method (FEM) was used since it has proven to be an alternative approach to the experimental method for the vibrational behavior analysis of a component or a system. Modeling and simulation of the impeller have been carried out using ANSYS Bladegen and ANSYS Workbench software, respectively. The eigenvalues and the eigenvectors were observed, and they represent the frequencies and the corresponding mode shapes of the impeller, respectively. The results showed that the varying number of impeller blades and impeller blade thickness had minimal effect on frequencies. However, the change to the <b>impeller</b> <b>disk</b> thickness had significant effects on the natural frequency of the impeller. ...|$|R

Therefore, this project aimed the design and production of a complex prototype pump impeller consisting of two parts to be assembled by sinter-joining. As this impeller has to operate in corrosive environment the basic material was the prealloyed austenitic PM steel Fe- 18. 0 per cent Cr- 10. 0 per cent Ni- 2. 0 per cent Mo- 0. 03 per cent C- 0. 8 per cent Si (similar to AISI 3161). By admixing of 0. 2 per cent Cu with 0. 3 and 0. 7 per cent P, respectively, the material was modified in order to control the shrinkage of the upper and lower <b>disks</b> of the <b>impeller</b> during sinter-joining. On one hand the feasibility of sinter-joining by these material compositions was proven first by manufacturing of upper and lower disks with interfering nozzles. On the other hand fatigue test under art ificial seawater were carried out with unnotched and notched specimen. These tests proved good corrosion fatigue resistance of the materials developed. The calculated stresses in the critical areas of the impellers had a high safety margin compared to the fatigue test results. Also the stress corrosion results showed that calculated maximum operational stresses of the impeller were far below critical values. The prototype impellers were machined from isostatically pressed disks after presintering. Finally the machined upper and lower disks were assembled and sinter-joined. The shrinkage and diffusion-bonding occured in the contact areas of the milled nozzles tightly fitted into the grooves of the opposite disk. The operational safety and hydraulic performance of the new impeller was proved in a closed pump test loop in tap and artificial seawater under normal conditions (1500 rpm) and overspeed (3600 rpm). The impeller survived a strong operational service simulation without any signs of corrosion fatigue and cracks.
