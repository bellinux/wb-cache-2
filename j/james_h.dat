5|$|Many arctiid moths make clicks when hunted by echolocating bats; {{they also}} often contain {{unpalatable}} chemicals. Some such as dogbane tiger moths (Cycnia tenera) have ears and conspicuous coloration, {{and start to}} make clicks when echolocating bats approach. An experiment by Canadian zoologists John M. Ratcliffe and <b>James</b> <b>H.</b> Fullard, using dogbane tiger moths and northern long-eared bats (Myotis septentrionalis), suggests the signals in fact both disrupt echolocation and warn of chemical defence. The behaviour of these insects is thus both deimatic and aposematic.|$|E

The injunction succeeded in ending the strike; however, tensions remained high between railroad workers and management for years.|$|E

5|$|Wilson was {{nominated}} by Hugh Cayley, {{a member of}} the Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories from Calgary, for speaker of the Assembly prior to the opening of the first session, on October 31, 1888. It was commonly assumed that <b>James</b> <b>H.</b> Ross would be the first speaker, but Wilson's name was mentioned for the position and it was decided to hold a vote. After the first three ballots ended in ties, Ross called upon his supporters to vote for Wilson, who was then elected unanimously.|$|E
5|$|First {{offered in}} 1946 in the Sandusky area and later {{expanded}} to serve Erie, Huron, Lorain, and Ottawa counties, extension programs established {{a foundation for}} BGSU Firelands, the university's regional campus.

In 2003, Cedar Point Center opened its doors on the Firelands campus. The facility houses a 450-seat divisible public meeting area, smaller conference rooms, a cyber cafe, multimedia classrooms, and two distance learning classrooms. In March 2011, BGSU Firelands unveiled a new master plan calling {{for the construction of}} three buildings to handle more students, more college/community partnerships; and expand the <b>James</b> <b>H.</b> McBride Arboretum to the entire campus.|$|E
5|$|In 1830, Wickliffe {{was chosen}} by his colleagues {{as one of the}} {{managers}} of the impeachment proceedings against Missouri District Court judge <b>James</b> <b>H.</b> Peck.

Of the sixty-nine votes needed to be elected to the seat, Wickliffe received forty-nine. Other candidates included John J. Crittenden (sixty-eight votes), John Breathitt (sixty-six votes), and Richard Mentor Johnson (sixty-four votes). After three days of balloting, the Assembly was still unable to fill the seat, and it was allowed to remain vacant until the next session.
