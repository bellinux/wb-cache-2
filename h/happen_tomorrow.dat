For instance, what would <b>happen</b> <b>tomorrow</b> if one hundred thousand tramps should become suddenly inspired with an overmastering desire for work? It is a fair question.

The judge on the bench, the pedestrian in the street, the housewife at the kitchen door, all unite in advising him to go to work.

But while {{the man on the}} island was oppressed by a bizarre sense of unreality affecting the very ground upon which he walked, the mind of the Capataz of the Cargadores turned alertly to the problem of future conduct. Nostromo's faculties, working on parallel lines, enabled him to steer straight, to keep a look-out for Hermosa, near which he had to pass, and to try to imagine what would <b>happen</b> <b>tomorrow</b> in Sulaco. To-morrow, or, as a matter of fact, to-day, since the dawn was not very far, Sotillo would find out in what way the treasure had gone. A gang of Cargadores had been employed in loading it into a railway truck from the Custom House store-rooms, and running the truck on to the wharf. There would be arrests made, and certainly before noon Sotillo would know in what manner the silver had left Sulaco, and who it was that took it out.|$|E
