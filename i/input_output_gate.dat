The long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture is particularly attractive because it addresses the vanishing gradient problem in standard RNNs, making them easier to train. Although recent {{studies have demonstrated that}} LSTMs can achieve significantly better performance on SPSS than deep feed-forward neural networks, little is known about why. Here we attempt to answer two questions: a) why do LSTMs work well as a sequence model for SPSS; b) which component (e. g., <b>input</b> <b>gate,</b> <b>output</b> <b>gate,</b> forget gate) is most important. We present a visual analysis alongside a series of experiments, resulting in a proposal for a simplified architecture.

40|$|SummaryConvergent {{evidence}} suggests that corticostriatal interactions act as a gate to select the input to working memory (WM). However, not all information in WM is relevant for behavior simultaneously. For this reason, a second “output gate” might advantageously govern which contents of WM influence behavior. Here, we test whether frontostriatal circuits previously implicated in <b>input</b> <b>gating</b> also support <b>output</b> <b>gating</b> during selection from WM. fMRI of a hierarchical rule task with dissociable <b>input</b> and <b>output</b> <b>gating</b> demands demonstrated greater lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) recruitment and frontostriatal connectivity during <b>output</b> <b>gating.</b> Moreover, PFC and striatum correlated with distinct behavioral profiles.

(For circuits having multiple outputs {{this is not necessarily}} the case; however, we will only be concerned with circuits having a single-bit <b>output.)</b> <b>Input</b> <b>gates</b> are labeled with bits of the input (in a one-to-one fashion); each non-input gate is labeled with a value from a given (finite) basis, where a basis may contain functions and/or families of functions.

40|$|It is {{now well}} {{established}} that most {{if not all}} enzymatic proteins display a slow stochastic dynamics of transitions between a variety of conformational substates composing their native state. A hypothesis is stated that the protein conformational transition networks, as just as higher-level biological networks, the protein interaction network, and the metabolic network, have evolved in the process of self-organized criticality. Here, the criticality means that all the three classes of networks are scale-free and, moreover, display a transition from the fractal organization on a small length-scale to the small-world organization on the large length-scale. Good mathematical models of such networks are stochastic critical branching trees extended by long-range shortcuts. Biological molecular machines are proteins that operate under isothermal conditions and hence are referred to as free energy transducers. They can be formally considered as enzymes that simultaneously catalyze two chemical reactions: the free energy-donating (input) reaction and the free energy-accepting (output) one. The far-from-equilibrium degree of coupling between the <b>output</b> and the <b>input</b> reaction fluxes have been studied both theoretically and by means of the Monte Carlo simulations on model networks. For single <b>input</b> and <b>output</b> <b>gates</b> the degree of coupling cannot exceed unity.

40|$|We {{propose a}} linear {{complexity}} method to estimate robust path delay fault coverage in digital circuits.

INTRODUCTION Two commonly used fault models are transition delay faults [5, 6, 10], which represent delay defects at <b>inputs</b> and <b>outputs</b> of <b>gates,</b> and path delay faults [9], which consider cumulative delays along combinational paths. The number of gate delay faults in a circuit is linearly proportional to the number of gates but the number of possible paths can be exponential making it impossible to enumerate all path delay faults in a large circuit. Still, many existing methods for computing fault coverage use some form of path enumeration. Storing of detected path delay faults [8] is [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The {{experiments}} {{in this thesis}} investigated the mechanisms controlling <b>input</b> and <b>output</b> <b>gating</b> of working memory. In chapter 3, accuracy and reaction time data from a precision/capacity working memory task with prospective and retrospective cues were analysed. The results suggest that retrocues boost performance by facilitating <b>output</b> <b>gating</b> from working memory. In chapter 4, the role of perceptual cortex in mediating the cue benefits in this task was investigated with magnetoencephalography (MEG). The pattern of alpha (8 - 12 Hz) power in visual cortex was modulated by cue direction following both precues and retrocues, but whilst this modulation was sustained following a precue (until presentation of the memory array) it was transient following a retrocue, suggesting that a memory representation was briefly retrieved or refreshed, but {{that there was not}} a sustained biasing of top-down input to visual cortex following retrocues. This argues against the standard model of working memory as sustained attention to internal representations, and in favour of a more dynamic view in which perceptual cortex is recruited transiently, and otherwise freed up for on-going processing. In chapter 5, the role of frontal networks in precueing and retrocueing was investigated. An fMRI meta-analysis identified control networks involved in preparatory and mnemonic selection: whilst the fronto-parietal network is recruited in both cases, the cingulo-opercular network is recruited only by retrocues. This spatial pattern was replicated with a source-space ROI analysis of MEG induced-responses. These data also characterised the time-course of control network activation shedding light on their functional roles. The fronto-parietal network was activated immediately following both precues and retrocues, consistent with a direct role in top-down influence over perceptual cortex. By contrast, the cingulo-opercular network was activated following retrocues only after the perceptual refreshing event was complete, suggesting a downstream role, perhaps in selecting representations to guide action. Chapter 6 investigated the role of reward associations in controlling access to working memory, testing behavioural predictions of two theories implicating the dopamine system and basal ganglia in control of working memory. The results supported a temporal gating account in which encountering reward associated items triggers a brief (This thesis is not currently available on ORA...|$|R

We also present a Reed-Muller based construction of these codes which obtains a worse γ but performs well at small sizes. Additionally, we present protocols based on checking the stabilizers of CCZ magic states at the logical level by transversal gates applied to codes; these protocols generalize the protocols of 1703. 07847.

Data transmission is orderly, and all <b>input</b> and <b>output</b> <b>gating</b> occurs at required time intervals. Events in nature do not always follow an ordered sequence, but data transmission requires the pattern and order found in a synchronous system. Today’s missiles and aircraft do not always have the nicety of synchronous systems. In many systems today, the PCM will run at one clock rate, while the navigational computer will be set to a second rate, the autopilot processor at a third and the weapons handling system at a forth. In the slower data use systems such as “ 1553 ", data can be stored, deleted, refreshed, and data buffers or memory used. Output data loss is not too important, since output data use rates are well below input data rates. However, research and development aircraft and missile test flight applications require real time or at least time-tagged data. Transient responses cannot be lost because of clock skips or phase differences between clocks. This paper will review and explain data loss through clock skips or phase differences. The paper will show causes and effects with real time flight systems that have flown recently.
