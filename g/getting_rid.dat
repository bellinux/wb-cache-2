5|$|Although Vainio {{himself did}} not consume alcohol, he was {{tolerant}} about others' alcohol use and could {{spend time with}} his friends even if they drank, keeping alcohol in his house in case his friends came over. He also began discussing the topic of drinking in his lyrics. <b>Getting</b> <b>rid</b> of his alcohol problem did not solve Vainio's domestic problems; he and Taina ended up divorcing.|$|E
5|$|Hurley {{confesses to}} Libby {{that he has}} an eating disorder, and shows her a stash of Dharma food. Hurley expresses {{interest}} in <b>getting</b> <b>rid</b> of it, and she encourages him to do so. Just after Hurley destroys his supplies, other survivors go into the jungle. Following them, Hurley and Libby see that an enormous package of food parachuted from the sky. After Hurley panics {{at the suggestion of}} again being in charge of the supplies, he sees Dave, and tries to follow him as he goes into the jungle.|$|E
60|$|BURGE. Nonsense! That notion {{about the}} Church being unprogressive {{is one of}} those shibboleths that our party must drop. The Church is all right essentially. <b>Get</b> <b>rid</b> of the establishment; <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> of the bishops; <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> of the candlesticks; <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> of the 39 articles; and the Church of England is just as good as any other Church; and I don't care who hears me say so.|$|R

5|$|In 1880, one John Holland of Cincinnati {{discovered}} {{the ability to}} melt and make castings of iridium by fusing the white-hot ore with phosphorus, and patented the process in the United States. He invoked the help of Dudley in <b>getting</b> <b>rid</b> of the phosphorus, who did so by repeated applications of lime at great heat. This was the first reported method of refining iridium. Dudley then found new applications for iridium, and formed the American Iridium Company with Holland. Dudley filed a patent on his method for iridium electroplating in 1887.|$|E
5|$|Leclerc heeded {{the advice}} {{he was given}} by United States General of the Army Douglas MacArthur to bring as many {{soldiers}} as possible. He broke the Vietminh blockade around Saigon, then drove through the Mekong delta and up into the highlands. This was possible because Ho feared Chinese domination far more than French colonialism, which he perceived to be in decline. Ho's first priority was <b>getting</b> <b>rid</b> of the Chinese, and for this he needed French help. Leclerc quickly perceived the necessity for a political solution to the conflict.|$|E
5|$|The prisoners {{believed}} {{that they would be}} rewarded by the Empress Anna for <b>getting</b> <b>rid</b> of the hated Apokaukos,. She, however, was so shocked and dismayed at the loss of her principal minister, that she gave Apokaukos's supporters, who were joined by the Gasmouloi, the fleet's marines, free rein to avenge their leader's death. As a result, all prisoners, some 200 in total, were massacred, even though some attempted to seek refuge in a nearby monastery.|$|E

In one story, a boy {{described}} his visits from the Churel.

5|$|A novel {{vaccine for}} dengue fever has been {{approved}} and is commercially available {{in a number of}} countries. Other methods of prevention are by reducing mosquito habitat and limiting exposure to bites. This may be done by <b>getting</b> <b>rid</b> of or covering standing water and wearing clothing that covers much of the body. Treatment of acute dengue is supportive and includes giving fluid either by mouth or intravenously for mild or moderate disease. For more severe cases blood transfusion may be required. About half a million people require admission to hospital a year. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen should not be used.|$|E
5|$|Knowing Superman {{could stop}} his plan, Luthor lures {{him to an}} {{underground}} lair, reveals his plan and exposes him to Kryptonite. As Superman weakens, Luthor further taunts him by revealing the first missile is headed toward Hackensack, New Jersey, as even Superman cannot stop both impacts. Eve Teschmacher, Luthor's accomplice, is horrified because her mother lives in Hackensack, but Luthor does not care and leaves Superman to a slow death. Knowing his reputation for keeping his word, Teschmacher rescues Superman on the condition he will deal with the New Jersey missile first. After Superman diverts the missile into outer space, the other one explodes near the San Andreas Fault. He mitigates {{the effects of the}} explosion, <b>getting</b> <b>rid</b> of the fallout and shoring up the crumbling Earth, but the aftershocks damage the Golden Gate Bridge and cause the Hollywood Sign and the Hoover Dam to collapse, endangering lives.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{method of}} {{controlling}} A. aegypti is by eliminating its habitats. This {{is done by}} <b>getting</b> <b>rid</b> of open sources of water, or {{if this is not}} possible, by adding insecticides or biological control agents to these areas. Generalized spraying with organophosphate or pyrethroid insecticides, while sometimes done, is not thought to be effective. Reducing open collections of water through environmental modification is the preferred method of control, given the concerns of negative health effects from insecticides and greater logistical difficulties with control agents. People can prevent mosquito bites by wearing clothing that fully covers the skin, using mosquito netting while resting, and/or the application of insect repellent (DEET being the most effective). However, these methods appear not to be sufficiently effective, as the frequency of outbreaks appears to be increasing in some areas, probably due to urbanization increasing the habitat of A. aegypti. The range of the disease appears to be expanding possibly due to climate change.|$|E

25|$|One then {{defines a}} number of {{different}} moves on topological representatives of φ that are all seen to either decrease or preserve the PerronFrobenius eignevalue of the transition matrix. These moves include: subdividing an edge; valence-one homotopy (<b>getting</b> <b>rid</b> of a degree-one vertex); valence-two homotopy (<b>getting</b> <b>rid</b> of a degree-two vertex); collapsing an invariant forest; and folding. Of these moves the valence-one homotopy always reduced the PerronFrobenius eigenvalue.|$|E
