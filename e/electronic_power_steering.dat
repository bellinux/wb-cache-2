An estimated 938,000 vehicles are included in the investigation. The investigation is ongoing. On May 27, 2015, Ford issued a recall for 2011-2012 Ford Fusions, Mercury Milans, and Lincoln MKZ's made in Mexico, along with 2011-2013 Ford Taurus, Ford Flex, Lincoln MKS and Lincoln MKT's built in Chicago or Oakville.

40|$|Nowadays, the <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> is a {{standard}} device in commercial vehicles. The electric <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> is becoming {{an alternative to the}} traditional hydraulic <b>power</b> <b>steering.</b> Right now, the electric drive commonly used in this application is the DC brush motor drive. Today, different electric drives are seen as a future option but the best candidate seems to be the permanent magnet synchronous motor drive. However due to its constructive simplicity, absence of permanent magnets and fault tolerance the switched reluctance motor drive is an alternative that should not be ignored. In this article a switched reluctance motor drive is presented for a rack-type electric <b>power</b> <b>steering</b> for midsize cars with a rack force 10 kN. The drive consists of a switched reluctance motor of four-phase with 8 stator poles and 6 rotor poles fed through an <b>electronic</b> <b>power</b> converter with Power MOSFETs switches, an incremental encoder and digital torque control to minimize torque ripple and to mitigate disturbances that appear when clearing a fault and the drive works with one or two open phases.

A 2.4-liter four-cylinder DOHC i-VTEC engine is available with direct injection mated to a dual-clutch transmission and Motion-Adaptive <b>Electronic</b> <b>Power</b> <b>Steering,</b> Precision All-Wheel Steer (P-AWS) through Integrated Dynamics System. The Honda designed dual clutch transmission {{is the first}} to use a torque converter, this is done to absorb transmission gear shift shock reducing NVH. The engine is rated at 206 hp with an EPA-estimated fuel economy of 24/35/28 mpg (city/highway/combined) compared to 22/31/26 from the previous TSX. Honda estimates it is 1.5 seconds faster from 0 to 60 mph, the 4-cylinder TLX will start at $31,890 or $360 more than the retiring TSX. Both the 4-cylinder TLX and 4-cylinder automatic TSX weigh the same.A 3.5-liter direct injected SOHC VTEC V-6 with cylinder deactivation (VCM) is mated to Honda's first time use of a 9-speed automatic transmission (sourced from ZF), it's available with either P-AWS or all-wheel drive (SH-AWD). The SH-AWD system uses hydraulic clutches instead of the electromagnetic clutch packs found on the previous TL which significantly cuts weight, size and cost. The engine is rated at 290 hp and front-wheel drive models deliver 21/34/25 mpg while all-wheel drive models are rated at 21/31/25 mpg. The V6 TLX will start at $36,115 or $810 less than the outgoing TL, SH-AWD models will come standard with the [...] "Technology Package" [...] costing $1,860 less than the previous SH-AWD TL equipped with the [...] "Technology Package".
