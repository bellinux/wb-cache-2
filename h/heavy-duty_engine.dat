40|$|Since the EURO V {{standards}} for <b>heavy-duty</b> <b>engines,</b> the European emissions legislation requires {{to verify the}} conformity of <b>heavy-duty</b> <b>engines</b> with the applicable emissions certification standards: these provisions are identified as “In Service Conformity” (ISC). It was considered impractical and expensive to adopt an ISC scheme for heavy-duty vehicles requiring the removal of engines from vehicles to test pollutant emissions against legislative limits. Therefore, it was proposed to develop a protocol for in-service conformity checking of heavy-duty vehicles based {{on the use of}} Portable Emission Measurement Systems (PEMS). As a result, ISC testing based on PEMS was introduced in the EURO V and the EURO VI standards. The corresponding administrative and technical provisions were formulated in the European Regulations 582 / 2011 and 64 / 2012. The above route was followed for non-road engines as well: preliminary research activities studied and confirmed the possibility to apply the methods developed for <b>heavy-duty</b> <b>engines</b> with minor modifications. The basis for the introduction of ISC provisions based on the PEMS approach into the European NRMM type-approval legislation has been established in several texts. The NRMM PEMS Pilot Program was launched to facilitate the introduction into the European NRMM emissions legislation of use of PEMS as a tool for ISC. This had to be achieved by improving the technical procedures (e. g. available from the heavy-duty scheme) and increasing the awareness of the different stakeholders about PEMS as a new regulatory tool.

40|$|For {{natural gas}} (NG) -diesel RCCI, a multi-zonal, {{detailed}} chemistry modeling approach is presented. This dual fuel combustion process requires further {{understanding of the}} ignition and combustion processes to maximize thermal efficiency and minimize (partially) unburned fuel emissions. The introduction of two fuels with different {{physical and chemical properties}} makes the combustion process complicated and challenging to model. In this study, a multi-zone approach is applied to NG-diesel RCCI combustion in a <b>heavy-duty</b> <b>engine.</b> Auto-ignition chemistry {{is believed to be the}} key process in RCCI. Starting from a multi-zone model that can describe auto-ignition dominated processes, such as HCCI and PCCI, this model is adapted by including reaction mechanisms for natural gas and NOx and by improving the incylinder pressure prediction. The model is validated using NG-diesel RCCI measurements that are performed on a 6 cylinder <b>heavy-duty</b> <b>engine.</b> For three different engine operating points, it is operated at various diesel injection timings and NG-diesel blend ratios. The validation is focused on variables that are relevant for engine control, such as CA 50, peak cylinder pressure, and engine-out NOx emissions. The validation shows that the multi-zone method with detailed chemistry reproduces the correct trends for important control parameters. From this validated model, real-time, map-based RCCI models are derived, which are considered to be an important step towards model-based NG-diesel RCCI control development...|$|E

With new sensors being developed, the opportunity opens to design the controller directly based on high-level objectives. In this paper, we propose to use model predictive control as a systematic way to go directly from high-level specifications to a control algorithm. The controller uses four actuator variables and five measured variables and is based on a model obtained through system identification. Experimental results on a six-cylinder <b>heavy-duty</b> <b>engine</b> around a fixed operating point demonstrate the potential of the control scheme. 1...|$|E
