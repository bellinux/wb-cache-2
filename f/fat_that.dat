5|$|Because he {{reported}} late, Berg {{spent the first}} three months of the season on the bench. In August, a series of injuries to catchers Ray Schalk, Harry McCurdy and Buck Crouse left the White Sox in need of somebody to play the position. Schalk, the White Sox player/manager, selected Berg, who did a fine job filling in. Schalk arranged for former Philadelphia Phillies catcher Frank Bruggy to meet the team at their next game, against the New York Yankees. Bruggy was so <b>fat</b> <b>that</b> pitcher Ted Lyons refused to pitch to him. When Schalk asked him whom he wanted to catch, Lyons selected Berg.|$|E
5|$|Pan frying (or shallow frying) {{requires}} {{a frying pan}} of sturdy construction {{and a source of}} <b>fat</b> <b>that</b> does not fully immerse the chicken. The chicken pieces are prepared as above, then fried. Generally the fat is heated to a temperature hot enough to seal (without browning, at this point) the outside of the chicken pieces. Once the pieces {{have been added to the}} hot fat and sealed, the temperature is reduced. There is debate as to how often to turn the chicken pieces, with one camp arguing for often turning and even browning, and the other camp pushing for letting the pieces render skin side down and only turning when absolutely necessary. Once the chicken pieces are close to being done the temperature is raised and the pieces are browned to the desired color (some cooks add small amounts of butter at this point to enhance browning). The moisture from the chicken that sticks and browns on the bottom of the pan become the fonds required to make gravy.|$|E

25|$|Moose are hunted {{as a game}} {{species in}} many of the {{countries}} where they are found. Moose meat tastes, wrote Henry David Thoreau in “The Maine Woods”, “like tender beef, with perhaps more flavour; sometimes like veal”. While the flesh has protein levels similar to those of other comparable red meats (e.g. beef, deer and elk), it has a low fat content, and the <b>fat</b> <b>that</b> is present consists of a higher proportion of polyunsaturated fats rather than saturated fats.|$|E
500|$|The {{origins of}} viruses are unclear: some may have evolved from plasmids—pieces of DNA that can move between cells—while {{others may have}} evolved from bacteria.

Viruses vary in shape from the simple helical and icosahedral to more complex structures.

500|$|According to {{one version}} of the story, while {{traversing}} the countryside, Radama and his men came across a wild zebu so exceptionally <b>fat</b> <b>that</b> the king {{decided to make a}} burnt offering of it. As the zebu flesh cooked, the enticing smell led Ralambo to taste the meat. He declared zebu meat to be fit for human consumption. In honor of the discovery, he decided to establish a holiday called fandroana that would be distinguished by the consumption of well-fattened zebu meat. [...] The holiday was to be celebrated on the day of his birth, which coincided with {{the first day of the}} year.

500|$|Porpoises {{are fully}} aquatic creatures. Females deliver a single calf after a {{gestation}} period lasting about a year. [...] Calving takes place entirely under water, with the foetus positioned for tail-first delivery {{to help prevent}} drowning. [...] Females have mammary glands, but {{the shape of a}} newborn calf's mouth does not allow it to obtain a seal around the nipple— instead of the calf sucking milk, the mother squirts milk into the calf's mouth. This milk contains high amounts of fat, which aids in the development of blubber; it contains so much <b>fat</b> <b>that</b> it has the consistency of toothpaste. The calves are weaned at about 11 months of age. [...] Males play no part in rearing calves. [...] The calf is dependent for one to two years, and maturity occurs after seven to ten years, all varying between species. This mode of reproduction produces few offspring, but increases the probability of each one surviving.|$|E
500|$|The berries of C.australis are {{enjoyed by}} bellbirds, tūī and pigeons. Māori {{sometimes}} planted groves of cabbage trees (pā tī) to attract pigeons {{which could be}} snared {{when they came to}} eat the berries. Reminiscing in 1903 about life in New Zealand sixty or more years earlier, George Clarke describes how such a tapu grove of cabbage trees would attract huge numbers of pigeons: [...] "About four miles from our house, there was a great preserve of wood pigeons, that was made as tapu as the native chiefs could devise. At a certain season, the pigeons came in vast flocks to feed on the white berries of the Ti tree (bracœna) [...] and got so heavy with <b>fat</b> <b>that</b> they could hardly fly from one tree to another. No gun was allowed in the place. The Maoris, with a long slender rod and a slip noose at the end, squatted under the leaves and noiselessly slipped the noose over the necks of the stupid pigeons as they were feeding." [...] As the native birds have vanished from much of New Zealand with the clearing of forests, it is now flocks of starlings which descend upon the fruit.|$|E
500|$|Whales {{are fully}} aquatic creatures, {{which means that}} birth and {{courtship}} behaviours {{are very different from}} terrestrial and semi-aquatic creatures. Since they are unable to go onto land to calve, they deliver the baby with the [...] fetus positioned for tail-first delivery. This prevents the baby from drowning either upon or during delivery. To feed the new-born, whales, being aquatic, must squirt the milk into the mouth of the calf. Being mammals, they have mammary glands used for nursing calves; they are weaned off at about 11 months of age. This milk contains high amounts of fat which is meant to hasten the development of blubber; it contains so much <b>fat</b> <b>that</b> it has the consistency of toothpaste. Females deliver a single calf with gestation lasting about a year, dependency until one to two years, and maturity around seven to ten years, all varying between the species. This mode of reproduction produces few offspring, but increases the survival probability of each one. Females, referred to as [...] "cows", carry the responsibility of childcare as males, referred to as [...] "bulls", play no part in raising calves.|$|E

2500|$|Accounts on {{the quality}} of the black bear's fur vary. According to Natural History of the Mammalia of India and Ceylon, [...] "Their skins are always poor and mangy, and {{generally}} so greasy that they are very difficult to keep until you can make them over to the dresser", which is corroborated by The great and small game of India, Burma, and Tibet, which states [...] "... the skins are never of any particular value, and in autumn, owing to the masses of yellow <b>fat</b> <b>that</b> are accumulated beneath them, are absolutely useless." [...] The first part of volume II of Mammals of the Soviet Union on the other hand states that Asian black bears yield fur, meat and fat of greater quality than those of brown bears. In British India, grease was the only practical use for black bear carcasses. Bears living near villages were considered the most ideal, as they were almost invariably fatter than their forest dwelling counterparts.|$|E

2500|$|A 2015 study, {{proposed}} {{naming the}} taste of fat as [...] "oleogustus". The main form of <b>fat</b> <b>that</b> is commonly ingested is triglycerides, which are composed of three fatty acids bound together. In this state, triglycerides are able to give fatty foods unique textures that are often described as creaminess. But this texture is not an actual taste. It is only during ingestion that the fatty acids that make up triglycerides are broken apart and {{the taste of}} fat is revealed. The taste is commonly related to other, more negative, tastes such as bitter and sour due to how unpleasant the taste is for humans. Richard Mattes, a co-author of the study, explained that low concentrations of these fatty acids can create an overall better flavor in a food, much like how small uses of bitterness can make certain foods more rounded. However, {{a high concentration of}} fatty acids in certain foods is generally considered inedible. To demonstrate that individuals can distinguish oleogustus from other flavors, the researchers separated volunteers into groups and had them try samples that also contained the other basic tastes. Volunteers were able to separate the taste of fatty acids into their own category, with some overlap with savory samples, which the researchers hypothesized was due to poor familiarity with both. The researchers note that the usual [...] "creaminess and viscosity we associate with fatty foods is largely due to triglycerides", unrelated to the taste; while the actual taste of fatty acids is not pleasant. Mattes described the taste as [...] "more of a warning system" [...] that a certain food should not be eaten.|$|E
