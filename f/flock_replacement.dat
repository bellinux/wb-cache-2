All animals were subjected to the identification of the prion protein PrP gene. The lower genetic diversity of alleles and genotypes of scrapie in stud rams (three genotypes and two alleles) and in rams for further breeding (five genotypes and three alleles) than in ewes of the foundation stock (eight genotypes and five alleles) and in <b>flock</b> <b>replacement</b> ewes (five genotypes and three alleles) was found. In case of <b>flock</b> <b>replacement</b> ewes, rams for further breeding and stud rams an increasing in the frequency of genotypes and alleles containing the ARR allele was observed as opposed to decreasing in the frequency of alleles: ARQ, AHQ and ARH. In foundation stock ewes during {{the first two years of}} research the not scrapie resistant allele VRQ was observed. In the third year of the study it was completely eliminated from the flock. The obtained results, especially for <b>flock</b> <b>replacement</b> ewes and rams for further breeding, indicate the legitimacy to conduct breeding work towards increasing the genotypes resistant scrapie. That indicates the validity of the development of breeding program for the Żelazna sheep breed...|$|E

Bibliography: leaves [157]- 163. ix, 163 l illus., tablesThe {{many changes}} taking place in the economy of Hawaii {{as well as in the}} {{industry}} itself lead to a questioning of the future of the industry in Hawaii. The major objective of the study was to evaluate the competitive position of the Hawaii egg industry with respect to California. A survey of 14 egg ranches on Oahu was conducted from which the cost of producing eggs in Honolulu county was determined. The information gathered provided the basis for studying production factors affecting the competitive position of the Hawaii industry. Four production factors were investigated in depth~ feed cost, <b>flock</b> <b>replacement</b> cost, labor cost, and the effect of increased flock size. Some of the facts uncovered by the study were: Feed and <b>flock</b> <b>replacement</b> costs are higher in Hawaii. Most of the differences in cost were due to transportation. Labor cost in Honolulu was significantly higher than the three California counties used for comparison. However, since local producers received higher prices for eggs and poultry meat, net farm income per layer was higher in Hawaii. Increased flock size could reduce production cost per layer, while the attrition of ranches with small flocks could add to the industry's competitive strength. Marketing factors affecting the competitive position of the egg industry were categorized under two groups~ the length and complexity of the marketing channel, and the competitive marketing actions of producers. It was found that transfer cost, which raises the price of production inputs, also raises the price of mainland eggs in Hawaii. The longer, more complex marketing channel of mainland eggs further increases the price of imported eggs. However, in spite of the higher marketing costs, mainland eggs can be sold at lower prices because of the lower cost of production. Current freight rates prohibit the importation of table eggs by air. While it may be physically possible to fly eggs in the cargo holds of the jumbo jets, it is doubtful that untreated shell eggs will be flown to Hawaii. The principal conclusion drawn from the available data is that competitive action by ranchers, advertising laws in Hawaii, and consumers' preferences for local eggs are factors which combine to maintain current competitive strength. Hawaii poultry ranchers will be able to maintain the 95 percent of the fresh egg market in Hawaii...|$|E
40|$|A {{deterministic}} model is developed {{to support the}} tactical and operational replacement decisions at broiler breeder farms. The marginal net revenue approach is applied to determine the optimal replacement age of a flock. The objective function of the model maximizes the annual gross margin over the flock’s production cycle. To calculate the gross margin, future egg production, fertility, or hatchability of the eggs, revenues and variable costs of a flock were estimated. For tactical decisions, the optimal laying length is {{the age at which}} the average gross margin of an average flock is maximal. For operational decisions, a flock should be replaced when the marginal gross margin of a replaceable flock is less than the average gross margin of an average flock. To demonstrate the model, a broiler breeder flock from a Dutch breeder farm was used. A sensitivity analysis showed that the optimal replacement decision, for both tactical and operational management, is sensitive to the decrease in the weekly egg production after the peak and the prices of feed and hatching eggs. The effect of the decrease in weekly fertility after the peak on the replacement decision is related to the payment system for hatching eggs.

Most <b>flocks</b> raised <b>replacement</b> lambs naturally with their dams until weaning and as a separate flock thereafter until lambing at one year of age.

40|$|A {{cross-sectional}} study with repeated sampling {{was conducted to}} investigate potential risk factors for Newcastle disease (ND) seropositivity and for incidence of ND virus (NDV) exposure in household flocks of backyard chickens in Eastern Shewa zone, Ethiopia. Data were collected from 260 randomly selected households in 52 villages in Adami Tulu Jido Kombolcha and Ada'a woredas (districts) using a structured questionnaire, and serum samples from chickens were tested for NDV antibodies using a blocking enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Sampling took place during September 2009 and the same households were again sampled in May 2010. Household-level seroprevalence and incidence of NDV exposure were estimated in various ways using serological results from the two samplings, flock dynamics, and farmers' reports of ND in their flocks. The risk factors were assessed using multivariable mixed-effects logistic regression models. Household-level seroprevalence at the two sampling times was 17. 4 % and 27. 4 %, respectively, and the estimated incidence of household-level NDV exposure during the intervening period ranged between 19. 7 % and 25. 5 %. At the first sampling, reduced frequency of cleaning of poultry waste was associated with increased odds of seropositivity (OR = 4. 78; 95 % CI: 1. 42, 16. 11; P = 0. 01) while hatching at home vs. other sources (buying in replacement birds, receiving as gift or buying fertile eggs) was associated with lower odds of seropositivity, both at the first sampling (OR = 0. 30; 95 % CI: 0. 11, 0. 82; P = 0. 02) and the second sampling (OR = 0. 23; 95 % CI: 0. 10, 0. 52; P < 0. 001). The risk of NDV exposure was shown to be higher with larger flock size {{at the beginning of}} the observation period (OR = 3. 6; 95 % CI: 1. 25, 10. 39; P = 0. 02). Using an open water source (pond or river) for poultry compared to closed sources (tap or borehole) was associated with increased risk of NDV exposure (OR = 3. 14; 95 % CI: 1. 12, 8. 8; P = 0. 03). The use of a grain supplement (OR = 0. 14; 95 % CI: 0. 03, 0. 69; P = 0. 03) and hatching at home for <b>flock</b> <b>replacement</b> (OR = 0. 23; 95 % CI: 0. 10, 0. 52; P = 0. 005) were associated with a lower risk of NDV exposure. Newcastle disease seroprevalence and incidence of NDV exposure were more heterogeneous between villages than between kebeles (aggregations of villages) and woredas in the study area. Further investigation of village-level risk factors would likely improve our understanding of ND epidemiology in backyard chickens. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E

Low seroprevalence in extensive flocks further supports previous indications that lactogenic MVV-infection is relatively inefficient and horizontal transmission is necessary to ensure long-term maintenance of MVV and this could explain that MVV has not been reported from countries with mainly extensively reared sheep such as Australia and New Zealand. Moreover, it indicates that MVV-control in extensive and semi-intensive flocks can be simple and inexpensive...|$|R
40|$|The {{prevalence}} of Haemophilus somnus in the prepuce of young rams was examined. Of 473 rams entering Record of Performance (ROP) stations at 50 days of age, 43 (9. 1 %) were positive. Average daily gain was {{not affected by}} Haemophilus status, but was influenced by breed of ram. Suffolks were predicted to gain 0. 515 kg daily compared to 0. 427 kg for a group combining all other breeds. Using logistic regression to identify risk factors for individual H. somnus infection, rams in 1989 were 0. 382 {{times as likely to}} be infected as rams in 1988, and Suffolks were 0. 314 times as likely to be infected as the other breeds group, but these factors were not significant at the flock level. Of 80 eligible flocks of origin, 22 (27. 5 %) were classified as infected with H. somnus, based on rams submitted to the ROP station. Infected flocks contributed 133 rams, 43 (32. 3 %) of which were positive. There was no association between H. somnus status and lambing percent of the percent of abortions and stillbirths, but there was a statistically significant association with the percent of ewes which failed to lamb. In the model developed, 6 % of the bred ewes in noninfected flocks failed to lamb, compared to a rate of 12 % in infected flocks. These results suggest H. somnus may influence ewe fertility earlier, rather than later in gestation.

40|$|This study {{reports on}} the {{development}} of a stochastic dynamic model to simulate a pastoral sheep enterprise. The event driven model was constructed using the iconic simulation package, ExtendTM. Events corresponded to the shifting of animals from one paddock to another. Each paddock was represented as a single entity with inherent attributes such as grazing area, sward characteristics and pasture production potential. The rotation sequence for grazing was determined by always allocating the flock of ewes, <b>flock</b> <b>replacements</b> or lambs to the paddock with the greatest pasture mass. Herbage mass was divided into three fractions: leaf, stem and dead. Pasture growth and senescence rates for individual paddocks were calculated from pasture leaf mass. A Micherlich-type function was used to relate leaf mass to total pasture growth. Senescence was assumed to increase linearly with herbage mass. Deterministic or stochastic pasture growth rate data can be generated by the model. Pasture responses to nitrogen were estimated dynamically and moderated for the farm by entering a user-defined response for a standard 50 kg/ha nitrogen application. Animal performance was calculated using average attributes for ewes, ewe hoggets and rams, but lambs were simulated individually. Lamb performance is affected by its date of birth and sex, and this information was generated by a sub-model for mixed-age ewe and ewe hogget reproduction. The potential herbage intake of the sheep was defined by their rumen fill and physiological energy demand, and herbage availability which was defined by pre-grazing green herbage mass and green herbage allowance for rotational grazing and leaf mass for continuous grazing. The grazing time spent in each paddock was derived from a linear interpolation of user-defined herbage allowances for each month of the year. The proportion of leaf, stem and dead material in the diet was calculated according to the proportion of these fractions in the sward and herbage availability. If animals were supplemented they consumed all of the material offered. This caused pasture substitution by decreasing the physiological energy demand and utilising rumen space otherwise taken up by grazed pasture. The partitioning of nutrients by animals was estimated from the ratio between energy intake and energy demand in an animal growth sub-model. This was driven by the DNA, protein and fat content of individual lambs and the average for animals in other sheep classes. Lambs were drafted for sale and graded according to user-defined threshold drafting weights. Carcass weight and fatness (GR) were generated from the live weight and sex of individuals lambs. A genetic optimisation algorithm was developed to optimise the systems control variables incorporated in the model. These were pasture allowance, supplement fed, nitrogen applied and lamb drafting weight. The model was evaluated against three New Zealand "farmlet" grazing experiments. This validation suggested re-parameterisation of the physiological intake limit is needed and that the British equation used to relate intake to leaf mass availability is overly sensible to the pasture conditions found in New Zealand. The model was also used to test the effects of pasture measurement errors on the profitability of a grazing system. Significant differences in profitability occurred when a CV of 40 % in measurement of pasture mass was assumed (Gross margin = $NZ 495 /ha vs. $NZ 542 /ha and $NZ 570 /ha for 20 and 0 % CV in measurement estimations and normal variability in pasture accumulation rates and Gross margin = $NZ 587 /ha, $NZ 576 /ha and $NZ 519 /ha, respectively for 40, 20 and 0 % CV in measurement estimates and no pasture accumulation rate variability). It was concluded that low gains in system performance can be expected by improving the accuracy of measuring pre-grazing herbage mass beyond the level (13 - 16 % CV) provided by the correct use of current measurement techniques...|$|R

Elimination of S.

40|$|We {{evaluated}} {{the efficiency of}} selection for body weight in a cooperative village breeding program for Menz sheep of Ethiopia under smallholder farming system. The design of the program involved organizing villagers in a cooperative breeding group to implement selective breeding of their sheep. The program was jump-started through a one-time provision of elite rams from a central nucleus <b>flock,</b> but subsequent <b>replacement</b> rams were selected from within the village flocks. We also evaluated body weight trends in a village where cooperative breeding was not implemented and individual farmers managed their flocks under traditional breeding practices. Under traditional breeding practices, genetic progress over 8 years either stagnated or declined in all the weights recorded. In the cooperative villages, selection differentials of 2. 44 and 2. 45 kg were achieved in 2010 and 2011 selection seasons, respectively. Birth weight, 3 -month weight and 6 -month weight increased, respectively, by 0. 49, 2. 29 and 2. 46 kg in the third-generation lambs over the base generation. Improved rams supplied from the central nucleus flock gave an initial genetic lift of 14. 4 % in the 6 -month weight. This was higher than the gain achieved from selection in the village flocks, which was 5. 2 %. Our results showed that village-based genetic improvement in body weights under smallholder conditions could be feasible if appropriate designs are adopted and that commencing with elite central nucleus rams help jump-start village-based programs...|$|R
40|$|Mycoplasma gallisepticum (MG) is the causative {{agent of}} chronic {{respiratory}} disease in layer chickens. The live MG vaccine strains that are available for use in layer chickens include F, ts- 11 and 6 / 85. The MG vaccine strains ts- 11 and 6 / 85 are safer than F and they {{have little or no}} potential of spreading from bird to bird. However, ts- 11 and 6 / 85 appear to be less efficacious than F-strain. Results from studies suggest that the use of MG vaccine strain F in <b>replacement</b> <b>flocks</b> {{over a period of time}} results in the displacement of the original field strain. Also, reports of MG breaks in layer flocks previously vaccinated with ts- 11 or 6 / 85 have resulted in revaccination of these flocks with F. The continued use of F-strain in displacement and revaccination regimens necessitates the development of more rapid and sensitive field tests that will differentiate between wild-type and vaccine strains of MG. In the present study, ts- 11 and F-strain whole cell extracts were analyzed by Western blotting and proteomic methodologies. Differentially expressed protein bands were excised, in-gel digested with trypsin, and analyzed by mass spectrometry. The proteins were identified as internal proteins and were predicted to be involved in such cellular processes as carbohydrate transport and metabolism, energy production and conversion, posttranslational modification, protein turnover, chaperone activity, transcription, and translation.

40|$|To analyse {{the disease}} {{dynamics}} in goat herds and {{to study the}} effect of control measures, a Q fever transmission model was developed by CVI. With such a model we can study questions like ‘What strategy can lower the incidence of Q fever in goats or even lead to disease extinction?’ and ‘Is vaccination a necessary component of a control strategy?’. For that purpose we first derived a deterministic model for the spread of Coxiella burnetii within a Dutch dairy goat herd housed in a deep litter stable. This model consists {{of a system of}} Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs). Parameter values were based on literature and on-going experimental work, and knowledge gaps were identified. This deterministic model was used to study the Q fever dynamics in the herd without control measures. A sensitivity analysis of the model was performed to study which parameters are most important for the model outcome. Subsequently, a stochastic version of the model was developed to study the effect of separate and combined control and management measures in detail. This was necessary because stochastic processes become important when infected animals in a herd are controlled to very low numbers. The output of that model was subsequently used by LEI to perform a cost-benefit analysis of the control and management strategies. The most important results of the Q fever modelling study are as follows: • Due to the synchronised lambing season in combination with most C. burnetii excretion at partus and abortion, Q fever prevalence shows a saw-tooth pattern within a year. From year to year, a peak is observed in number of infected animals, abortions and infection pressure in year 1 - 2 after introduction of C. burnetii in the herd. • The epidemiological analyses show that vaccination is effective in quickly reducing the prevalence in a dairy goat flock. Other control strategies have more impact on <b>flock</b> management (more <b>replacement</b> of animals); (re-) infections can than lead to greater outbreaks due to the higher number of susceptible animals in the flock. • When looking at the average time to extinction of the infection and at the infection pressure in a goat flock, the best control strategy is “Preventive vaccination” (i. e. yearly), followed by the reactive vaccination strategies “Vaccination after abortion storm” and “Vaccination after BTM (bulk tank milk) positive”. • When aiming at a fast reduction of the Q fever infection pressure to the environment (like bacterial spores in dust), the strategy “Culling of pregnant animals after abortion storm” is effective. Then, no peak is observed anymore in number of infected animals, abortions and infection pressure in the goat herd. However, Q fever will not go extinct by this measure. • Infected lactating goats excrete C. burnetii bacteria intermittently, and in different amounts. A Search&Destroy method by PCR of milk with a sensitivity of 50 % of detecting and culling infected goats, will not result in extinction of Q fever in the flock. This control measure was the worst of the six evaluated strategies. • Next to the reactive strategies, Q fever can be controlled by manipulating the frequency of pregnancy (and thus lambing) of goats. The herd management style “Every year pregnant” is always worse than the other two herd management styles “Every two year pregnant” and “First two years pregnant”. • C. burnetii can survive from breeding season to breeding season as intracellular bacterium in the goat (persistent infection). According to the model, these persistently infected goats are sufficient for the bacterium to survive from year to year in the flock. • The average lifetime of a goat in a Dutch dairy goat flock is 2. 7 year. If vaccination will be stopped, within a few years most of the animals in the flock are without immunity against C. burnetii. This susceptible population is very vulnerable for (re-) introductions of Q fever. • During the modelling study, gaps in knowledge were identified, and assumptions had to be made. ¿ The transmission rate, the fraction of infected pregnant animals to become persistently infected and the fraction of C. burnetii excretion targeted to dust could not be estimated with certainty from literature data. Therefore, the infection dynamics in the model was studied for a range of values for these parameters. The parameter values which achieved a high abortion peak in the second season and a lower disease incidence in later seasons were used in the default model. ¿ Infection pressure caused by non-pregnant goats. It is unknown what the effect is of an infection in non-pregnant goats and how many and how long C. burnetii bacteria will be excreted to the environment. Also unknown is the fraction of these goats which becomes immune after acute infection. ¿ Infection pressure caused by spores of bacteria. C. burnetii can survive from breeding season to breeding season as bacterial spore. However, the fraction of surviving spores after one year is unknown, and so is their contribution to the infection pressure from stable environment to the goat flock. De conclusions of the economic analysis are: • As the dairy goat vaccination programme continues, future expenses in maintaining the current protected status are relatively low. • For Q-fever infected goat farms in the Netherlands preventive vaccination is always the preferred control strategy compared to other analysed control strategies. This also holds for a partial analysis if only on-farm costs and benefits are accounted for. • Averted human health costs depend to a large extend on the number of infected human cases per infected farm or animal. However, much is yet unknown with respect to goat-human transmission rates. • Preventive vaccination on Q-fever free farms should also be considered if the probability of re-infection is estimated to be more frequent than once per 15 to 20 years. • Freedom of Q-fever disease in which the agent is absent in livestock and environment would enable a return to non-vaccinated herds. However, much is yet unknown with respect to the probability and mechanisms of re-infection...|$|R
