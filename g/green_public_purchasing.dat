40|$|Green Public Procurement (GPP) {{can be seen}} as a {{promising}} method to promote environmentally sound product design and motivate manufacturers to make products with reduced environmental impacts. For furniture, environmental impacts are quite limited during use but more associated with production and disposal. The requirements and criteria for furniture purchasing should be targeted to those environmental aspects that have the most influence and could, through eco-design, lead to the greatest environmental benefits. In order to do this, an RPS selection tool (Relevance-Potential-Steerability) is used. It is a tool developed for the assessment of the feasibility of eco-labelling criteria for a certain product group, and is applied in this study. The purpose of this paper is to recognize the major environmental aspects of furniture and to analyze to which extent they are taken into consideration in public purchasing, i. e., in the calls for tenders. The paper begins with describing the concepts of GPP and eco-design, as well as essential elements in this context such as the 'most economically advantageous' tender, the environmental aspects of furniture, eco-labels and eco-design strategies. The article continues with an analysis of 31 calls for tenders of furniture, including 15 Finnish and 16 Swedish calls for tenders. Finally, the paper discusses about the potential of GPP in promoting eco-design of furniture, i. e., what criteria are relevant from the view point of eco-design. The criteria that were presented in the studied calls for tenders seemed to be relevant from this perspective and subsequently may encourage eco-design among furniture manufacturers. <b>Green</b> <b>Public</b> <b>Purchasing</b> (GPP) Eco-design Furniture RPS method...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} impact of <b>green</b> <b>public</b> {{procurement}} (governments’ <b>purchases)</b> of certified wood in the EU. A spatial partial price equilibrium model is developed to analyse whether this policy impacts interregional trade flows of wood and other regions’ economic welfare. The model contains an innovative feature which allows the introduction of consumers’ willingness to pay for certified wood, and producers’ willingness to accept certified wood production {{in order to determine}} the share of certified wood in consumption and demand. The outcome of the analysis demonstrates that <b>green</b> <b>public</b> procurement of certified wood in one region can create a trade barrier for other regions and decrease other regions’ economic welfare.

40|$|Policy makers can employ {{different}} {{instruments to}} address environmentalpolicy objectives, and the guiding principles for a consistent system of environmentalpolicy are (1) the policies should be effective, (2) {{there should be}} oneobjective per instrument, and (3) multiple objectives and multiple policy instrumentsmust be mutually independent of each other.

As an illustrative example, theanalysis refers to the Swedish policy of using <b>public</b> <b>purchase</b> of organic foods as apolicy instrument to increase the certified organic agricultural area {{as a share of}} thetotal agricultural area. Our analysis shows that GPP fails to satisfy principles (1) and(3), {{and the only way to}} satisfy principle (2) is then to have just one objective withthe procurement, i. e., to run the operations.

40|$|Public {{procurement}} {{is officially}} {{regarded as a}} mean to bring about environmental improvements.

As a policy tool GPP offers a potentially flexible way of influence producers towards sustainable production, but can also have drawbacks in comparison with other environmental policy tools. In this paper we approach the question if GPP can function as a cost-efficient policy tool. Given this, it is also analyzed whether the implementation of GPP can, from a welfare perspective, deter or stimulate entry to the procurement auctions. As shown in the paper, both outcomes are plausible and although cost-efficiency can be achieved by GPP it is a complex environmental policy tool to implement...|$|R

40|$|<b>Green</b> <b>Public</b> Procurement (GPP) {{has been}} {{considered}} as an important policy instrument {{in the context of}} sustainable consumption and production. The state and progress of GPP has earlier been measured by questionnaires and interviews, both methods being based on the assessment by the purchaser, and questionnaires having low response rates. Recently, a new method was developed, analyzing the existence of environmental criteria in the calls for tenders. However, the studies have dealt neither with the progress in GPP, nor the statistical evidence of differences between countries. Our aim was to analyze more thoroughly whether the differences in the proportions of 'green' calls for tenders between the three Nordic countries, Denmark, Finland and Sweden, in 2003 and 2005 were real, and whether there had occurred any progress between the years concerned. The paper also presents the 'GPP-record' method, which enables more valid measurement of the environmental soundness of <b>public</b> <b>purchasing.</b> The statistical analyses were done using logit models with country, year and product group as the explanatory factors. It proved to be relevant {{to take into account the}} variation that occurred from the random existence of product groups in the samples of calls for tender. There were less environmental criteria in the calls for tenders in Finland than in Denmark and Sweden in 2003, but in 2005 no significant difference between Finland and Denmark was observed. Both Finland and Sweden saw progress in this area between 2003 and 2005. <b>Green</b> <b>Public</b> Procurement (GPP) Progress Calls for tenders Environment Statistical Logit models...|$|R

40|$|<b>Green</b> <b>public</b> {{procurement}} is {{a public}} procurement, which integrates environmental considerations into the public procurement process, and it {{is considered to be}} an appropriate tool seeking to reduce negative impacts on the environment. Therefore this paper aims to analyze results of <b>green</b> <b>public</b> procurement implementation in Lithuania over the 2008 – 2010 year period, considering its scope and possibilities for reducing environmental impacts. It is determined that practical implementation of <b>green</b> <b>public</b> procurement in Lithuania is not smooth and is far from achieving the objectives yet. In 2008 green procurement amounted to 8. 3 %, in 2009 – 6. 1 %, in 2010 – 5. 8 % {{of the total number of}} public procurements performed. The biggest share of performed <b>green</b> <b>public</b> procurement is applied for works (82 %), mainly related to the construction. However, some possibilities to reduce environmental impacts in terms of CO 2 have been missed. To compare to the benefit achieved, estimations show that in the case of personal computers, printers and vehicles, 126 - 150 tons of CO 2 could have been saved additionally per year, if environmental criteria had been applied to 50 % of particular performed procurements. Hence, it is especially important to speed up the development of <b>green</b> <b>public</b> procurement in Lithuania, ensuring not only lowering negative impact on the environment, but also developing the market for environment-friendly goods and services. <br /...|$|R
