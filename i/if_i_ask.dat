500|$|In his autobiography, Best {{stated that}} Epstein drove {{them both to}} Blackpool one evening where Epstein {{expressed}} his [...] "very fond admiration." [...] Epstein then supposedly said, [...] "Would you find it embarrassing <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> you {{to stay in a}} hotel overnight?" [...] Best replied that he was not interested, and the two never mentioned the incident again. There were reports of a brief sexual encounter between Lennon and Epstein during a four-day holiday in Barcelona, in April 1963. Lennon always denied the rumours, telling Playboy in 1980: [...] "Well, it was almost a love affair, but not quite. It was never consummated... but we did have a pretty intense relationship." [...] Lennon's first wife Cynthia also maintains that Lennon's relationship with Epstein was platonic. A fictionalised account of the Spanish holiday is featured in the 1991 film The Hours and Times.|$|E
500|$|In October 2014, PewDiePie began {{hinting at}} the {{possibility}} that he might not renew his contract with Maker Studios upon its expiration in December 2014. Reports that covered this information also added that PewDiePie expressed his frustrations with the studio's parent company, Disney; PewDiePie was quoted saying, [...] "The fact that Disney bought Maker Studios doesn't really change anything for me. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> for help, they reply, but that's all the contact we have. We'll see what happens." [...] Rather than re-sign with Maker, PewDiePie has mulled the option of launching his own network, although he has declined to provide in-depth details on the subject. However, in light of news outlets reporting his disinterest with Maker, PewDiePie tweeted, [...] "I feel like I was misquoted in the WSJ and I'm really happy with the work that Maker has been doing for me." [...] PewDiePie ultimately continued creating videos under Maker; his relationship with the network has seen Maker establish an official PewDiePie website, app, and online store to sell Bro Army merchandise, while PewDiePie promotes Maker's media interests and gives the network a share of his YouTube ad revenue.|$|E
2500|$|Occasionally, by the way, I get {{a letter}} from someone who is in [...] "contact" [...] with an {{extraterrestrial}} who invites me to [...] "ask anything". And so I {{have a list of}} questions. The extraterrestrials are very advanced, remember. So I ask things like, [...] "Please give a short proof of Fermat's Last Theorem." [...] Or the Goldbach Conjecture. And then I have to explain what these are, because extraterrestrials will not call it Fermat's Last Theorem, so I write out the little equation with the exponents. I never get an answer. On the other hand, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> something like [...] "Should we humans be good?" [...] I always get an answer. I think something can be deduced from this differential ability to answer questions. Anything vague they are extremely happy to respond to, but anything specific, where there is a chance to find out if they actually know anything, there is only silence.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>asked</b> Aunt Alice to beg {{you to come}} here. I {{was afraid}} you wouldn't <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> you.|$|R
5000|$|<b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> you Q in {{your current}} mental state, {{would you say}} ja? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How daring," [...] Maggie murmured, [...] "and how wonderfully original! What {{should you}} say, now, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> you <b>if</b> my nose wanted powdering?" ...|$|R
60|$|As {{compared}} with other actual Universities, then, Aberdeen, may, perhaps, be well satisfied with itself. But do not think me an impracticable dreamer, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> you not to rest and be thankful in this state of satisfaction; <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> you to consider awhile, how this actual good stands related to that ideal better, towards which both men and institutions must progress, if they would not retrograde.|$|E
6000|$|... "Would {{you feel}} insulted <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> whether your breakfast {{is to be}} sent up, or kept waiting till you choose to come down?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The journey {{will put}} you to some expense," [...] the {{merchant}} replied. [...] "Pardon me <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> the question bluntly. Have you money?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> {{you to go}} in thither yourself, and try the mettle and {{the luck}} which, they say, never failed Hereward yet?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, they'd go {{quick enough}} <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> them {{up here in}} the country. Etiquette don't count with them when they're on a vacation." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You {{look very}} comfortable, dear Mr. Lomas,' she retorted. 'Would you mind very much <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> {{you to put}} my {{footstool}} right for me?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All right," [...] he answered, rather taken aback. [...] "But <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> Edgar, he'll {{always come}} with us, {{and then they}} can say nothing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{will not}} think me foolish <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> you to wait here while I go in there"--she {{pointed to the}} ominous thicket near them--"alone?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh no;--not to stay. Of course I {{must ask}} my husband. I'm sure he'll {{let me go}} <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> it, but not to-morrow. Why to-morrow?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I don't care. I {{think he}} ought to see Lucy, and since he'd refuse <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> him, I'm not going to give him the chance.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll be {{frivolous}} enough {{later on}} this evening. I've been wondering if you'd think it impertinent <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> {{you to tell me}} about your guardian." ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{girl looked}} at him steadily. “I have trusted you, Mr. Appleby. Would it be too much <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> you to take me into your confidence?” ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You {{know what}} I mean,' said Alethea, 'and pray {{do not be}} displeased <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> you not to make it {{difficult}} for Marianne to behave properly.' ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{drew closer}} to him, her hands upon his shoulders. [...] "Yet <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> you--I, your wife?" [...] she pleaded, and almost won {{him to her}} will.|$|E
6000|$|... "And you won't {{leave me}} alone?" [...] she begged--"not even <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> {{to be left}} alone? You see--I can't make you understand--but I don't even trust myself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Pray do {{not answer}} me <b>if</b> <b>I</b> go too far. But I know that Lord Arthur Sibthorpe {{has applied for}} Tangier. Would it be a liberty <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> you what chance he has?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Do you remember, <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> you a {{question}} before I went away? You refused to marry me then, but {{you told me that}} <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> again when <b>I</b> came back, the answer might be different.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{the other}} eagerly assented. [...] "I was told, at your county seat, that I could learn {{all about it}} <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> for Squire Braile, here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I thank you, no. I am not thirsty. Ice-water is not {{necessary}} to my happiness. You will pardon me <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> to be left alone--with my nerves." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{girl did}} as he suggested, and his smile faded. [...] "Now," [...] he went on, [...] "you won't be {{astonished}} <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> if you will marry me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Certainly {{it is very}} considerable,' Merton said, after a {{few minutes}} passed in arithmetical calculation. 'Am I too curious <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> what is the source of this opulence?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But couldn't {{she make}} a will in my favour? I know she'd do it <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> her--if <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> her now--now she's going off, you know. I'm sure she'd do it. Don't {{you think she}} would?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I suppose," [...] said Conolly, looking {{round at}} her in surprise, [...] "I should have {{answered}} her question--told her what she was wanted for. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> you to do anything, and you enquired why, you would be extremely annoyed <b>if</b> <b>I</b> answered, 'because <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> you.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|Desmond {{looked hard}} at him--but {{it was already}} almost dark. [...] "Well," [...] he said, [...] "we're rather old friends. Would it be too much <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> you why?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{see very}} little to criticise," [...] I said, [...] "from your point of view; but I hope you won't think it indiscreet <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> a few questions?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Once I {{was eager}} to persuade {{you to come to}} church to hear me; will you think it strange <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> you not to come on this occasion?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{will not}} think me foolish <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> you to wait here while I go in there"--she {{pointed to the}} ominous thicket near them--"alone?" [...] She was quite white.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{afraid he}} wouldn't," [...] replied Mary, doubtfully, [...] "and I think he'd only laugh <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> him. He seemed glad {{when he thought}} he had escaped the celebration." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I {{guess my}} father might {{give me one}} or two <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> 'em," [...] Harvey replied. He had been too busy to think much of his family till then.|$|R
6000|$|... "Jealousy!" [...] he cried. [...] "Jealousy! Just as though--Can't I have {{letters about}} things you don't understand--that you won't understand? <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> {{you to read}} them you wouldn't--It's just because--" ...|$|R
