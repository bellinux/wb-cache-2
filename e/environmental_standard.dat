Consumers concerned about overfishing and its consequences are increasingly able to choose seafood products that have been independently assessed against the MSC's <b>environmental</b> <b>standard.</b> This enables consumers to play a part in reversing the decline of fish stocks. As of February 2012, over 100 fisheries around the world have been independently assessed and certified as meeting the MSC standard. Their [...] page lists the currently available certified seafood. As of February 2012 over 13,000 MSC-labelled products are available in 74 countries around the world.

It also compares and contrasts the strategic equilibrium <b>environmental</b> <b>standards</b> and levels of pollution, local and global, with the world optimum levels. It shows that, in case of open economies, <b>environmental</b> <b>standards</b> can be either strategic substitutes or strategic complements. On the contrary, in case of closed economies, <b>environmental</b> <b>standards</b> are always strategic substitutes. It also shows that the strategic equilibrium <b>environmental</b> <b>standards</b> in case of open economies are higher than the world optimum in certain situations.

This study discusses <b>environmental</b> <b>standards</b> and their economic impacts. As an introduction, we discuss the overview and definition of <b>environmental</b> <b>standards.</b> Moreover, we perform a typology of existing <b>environmental</b> <b>standards.</b> In addition, we theoretically analyze the effects of introducing <b>environmental</b> <b>standards</b> on company production.

40|$|We {{explore the}} effects of {{domestic}} <b>environmental</b> <b>standards</b> when a domestic firm and a foreign rival compete in the domestic market. We focus on {{a situation where the}} introduction of <b>environmental</b> <b>standards</b> forces the foreign product out of the domestic market because it does not meet the standards. Such prohibitive standards may induce the foreign firm to produce an environmentally friendly good through R&D or licensing obtained from the domestic firm. However, this does not guarantee that the product, which now complies with the <b>environmental</b> <b>standards,</b> will improve the environment. In the case of licensing, governments may intervene to shift the rent from the domestic firm. In certain circumstances, the shifted rent could exceed the amount paid by the foreign firm for licensing.
