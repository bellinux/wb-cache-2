40|$|The {{drawback}} of {{lean burn}} with ethanol is reduced power output. Lean operation of <b>ethanol</b> <b>fuelled</b> <b>engines</b> has additional drawbacks. Lean mixtures {{are hard to}} ignite, despite the mixture being above the low fire (point) limit of the fuel. This results in misfire, which increases unburned hydrocarbon emissions, reduces performance and wastes fuel. Hydrogen {{can be used in}} conjunction with ethanol provided it is stored separately. Mixing hydrogen with a oxygenated hydrocarbon fuel such as ethanol reduces all of these drawbacks. The low ignition energy limit of hydrogen combined with a high burning speed makes the hydrogen-ethanol mixture easier to ignite, reducing misfire and thereby improving emissions, performance and fuel economy. The current study involved generating simulation software that provides the mole fraction of each of the exhaust species when hydrogen is combusted with ethanol. The proportion of hydrogen in the hydrogen–ethanol blend affecting the mole fraction of the exhaust species is also simulated. The program code developed gave reasonably good results for the present hydrogen-ethanol dual fuel. At low and high percentages of hydrogen, and during transition between ethanol and hydrogen, the model predictions are not very clear. The best results were obtained for a combination of 80...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{depicts the}} main topics of the {{experimental}} investigation on alcohol engine development field, aiming at the engineering targets for the emission levels. The {{first part of this}} study was focused on engine design optimization for running on ethanol mexed with poly-ethylene glycol (PEG) as ignition improver. It was shown that some design changes in compression ratio, turbine casing, injector nozzle configuration and exhaust pressure governor (EPG) activation, lead to a better engine thermodynamics and thermochemistry. The second objective of this study was the investigation of engine performance and enmission levels, when the ignition improver diethyl ether (DEE) would be generated on board via catalyticallly dehydration of ethanol, and used directly as soluble mixture or separately fumigated. Both alternatives: ether fumigation technique and dissolved ether in alcohol fuel application were conceptually analyzed, and a stand up system based on DEE fumigation was used to determine the optimum DEE-ethanol ratio at any engine operating range. The heat release investigation, when the engine was run on neat ethanol and optimum fumigated DEE, has been indicated earlier combustion, and very short ignition delay. Verified possibilities for using DEE as ignition improver, would lead to a proper version of the on board ether reactor design, which would bring to another solution for <b>ethanol</b> <b>fuelled</b> <b>engines...</b>|$|E
40|$|Compression ignited (CI) engines, {{commonly}} known as diesel engines, are widely used power sources with complex emissions used in on-road and nonroad applications. To find out the impact of diesel exhaust emissions on health and the environment, both regulated and unregulated exhaust gas properties have to be evaluated. Especially, emissions obtained with new fuels and new exhaust gas aftertreatments have to be examined properly to avoid an increased impact of emissions of harmful substances. This thesis deals with {{the issue in the}} following papers: In Paper I, a mixture of acetal and diesel has been investigated in a 9 - liter Scania diesel engine. A marked decrease in particle number emissions and the estimated particle mass was obtained when acetal was blended into regular Swedish diesel fuel. A small penalty in engine power was observed, but the net effect was, nevertheless, a reduction in the emission of carbon dioxide per ESC cycle. Emissions of HC, CO, NOX, some aldehydes and hydrocarbons were only slightly affected by the new fuel composition. An exception was the emission of acetaldehyde, which was almost quadrupled, probably reflecting the decomposition and oxidation of acetal to acetaldehyde. In Papers II-IV, the potential to obtain low emissions of particles and NOX from a CI engine, running on ethanol and equipped with exhaust gas recirculation, EGR, catalyst and diesel particle filter, DPF, are investigated. Results obtained from a CI engine running on ethanol with the ignition improver Beraid were compared with results from a CI engine running on diesel. Both engines were 9 -liter Scania CI engines from the same engine family. Paper II covers differences originating from the fuel, together with effects from EGR, catalyst and the DPF. It was concluded that the emission control system shows a large potential for reducing particles and NOx and that these features could probably be further improved if the system is optimized for the <b>ethanol</b> <b>fuelled</b> CI <b>engine.</b> In paper III, the fuels influence on various particle properties was investigated, e. g., particle size and distribution, particle shape, composition and morphology. It was shown that the <b>ethanol</b> <b>fuelled</b> CI <b>engine</b> emitted lower particle mass, particles of smaller sizes and approx. the same or greater number emissions than the diesel <b>fuelled</b> <b>engine.</b> It was also revealed that the solid particles emitted from the ethanol engine are composed mainly of carbon and that the carbon has the same crystallite structure as carbon particles emitted from engines running on diesel. Furthermore, it was also confirmed that agglomerated particles were dependent upon speed, fuel and emission control. The purpose of Paper IV was to investigate the fuels as well as the influence of EGR, the catalyst and DPF on four specific aldehydes and 14 individual hydrocarbons. There were both quantitative and qualitative differences between the emitted compounds from the engines running on ethanol and diesel fuel, respectively. The emissions of aldehydes decreased between 56 % and 95 % when the <b>ethanol</b> <b>fuelled</b> CI <b>engine</b> was equipped with exhaust gas aftertreatment. The corresponding decrease for the diesel <b>fuelled</b> CI <b>engine</b> was between 74 % and 94 %. The summarized levels of analyzed emitted hydrocarbons were higher for the diesel <b>fuelled</b> <b>engine</b> compared to the levels emitted from the <b>ethanol</b> <b>fuelled</b> <b>engine.</b> However, the reduction, when connecting the exhaust gas after treatment system to diesel <b>fuelled</b> CI <b>engine</b> was larger, 90 %, than the 47 % reduction obtained when the system was connected to the <b>ethanol</b> <b>fuelled</b> CI <b>engine.</b> The exhaust gas aftertreatment system worked more effectively when coupled to the diesel engine. A general conclusion, therefore, is that {{it should be possible to}} adjust this system better to reach lower emission levels for the <b>ethanol</b> <b>fuelled</b> CI <b>engine.</b> Paper V describes how the <b>ethanol</b> <b>fuelled</b> CI <b>engine</b> in Papers II-IV was optimized with different EGR scenarios and tested, both according to stationary (ESC) and transient conditions (ETC). A second DPF was also tested together with an oxidation catalyst. Particles were clearly affected by the EGR settings and the tested exhaust gas aftertreatment. In fact, when the DPF was used, particulate emissions were lower than stipulated for on–road regulations, Euro V and EEV. An efficient reduction of NOX emission levels was obtained by applying EGR; depending on exhaust gas aftertreatment, setting and test cycle used, the reductions of NOX were between 73 % and 33 %. Unfortunately, the high reduction of NOX was followed by a concomitant increase of CO, HC and particulate matter, PM, together with fuel penalty. The remedy for the higher emission levels of HC, CO and PM was an oxidation catalyst and a DPF. A humid air motor system (HAM) for reduction of NOX was investigated in paper VI. Earlier studies have demonstrated that the system has a capacity to lower NOX emissions from heavy duty diesel <b>fuelled</b> CI <b>engines.</b> The study aimed to investigate the HAM system´s influence on the emissions of particles, which generally increased, contrary to aldehyde emissions, which decreased and also to monitor essential engine parameters, water consumption, and also to verify the reducing ability. The NOX reduction capability was verified to be 51 % without any optimization. The complex nature of exhaust gas makes it impossible to analyze all properties of the exhaust. The work in this thesis has been focused on particles, particle properties and emissions of unregulated compounds, in order to elucidate aspects exhaust of other than the one obtained when measuring regulated emissions.

A comparative study based on the first and second laws of thermodynamics are discussed here. The key parameters for analysis are considered as mean effective pressure (MEP), power, torque, exergetic efficiency, second law efficiency, and irreversibility. Air standard assumptions were taken consideration for the analyses. MEP, power output and torque for all alternative <b>fuelled</b> <b>engines,</b> are higher compared to that of a gasoline engine. Exergy due to heat and work are also discussed here. For heat exergy, only hydrogen exceeds gasoline while other alternative fuels have lower heat exergy than gasoline. But work (mechanical) exergy for all the alternative <b>fuelled</b> <b>engines</b> are higher than the gasoline engine. The Irreversibility or losses for the alternative <b>fuelled</b> <b>engines</b> are significantly lower than a gasoline engine. Alternative fuel engines have lower specific fuel consumption than the gasoline engine.

The compressed hydrogen at 20 MPa has been introduced to the engine adopted to operate on gaseous hydrogen by external mixing. Two regulators {{have been used to}} drop the pressure first to 300 kPa, then to atmospheric pressure. The variations of torque, power, brake thermal efficiency, brake mean effective pressure, exhaust gas temperature, and emissions of NOx, CO, CO 2, HC, and O 2 versus engine speed are compared for a carbureted SI engine operating on gasoline and hydrogen. Energy analysis also has studied for comparison purpose. The test results have been demonstrated that power loss occurs at low speed hydrogen operation whereas high speed characteristics compete well with gasoline operation. Fast burning characteristics of hydrogen have permitted high speed engine operation. Less heat loss has occurred for hydrogen than gasoline. NOx emission of hydrogen <b>fuelled</b> <b>engine</b> is about 10 times lower than gasoline <b>fuelled</b> <b>engine.</b> Finally, both first and second law efficiencies have improved with hydrogen <b>fuelled</b> <b>engine</b> compared to gasoline engine.
