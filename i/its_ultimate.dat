5|$|Over time {{intervals}} of around 30 trillion years, the Sun will undergo a close encounter with another star.

5|$|Rolling Thunder {{had begun}} as a {{campaign}} of psychological and strategic persuasion, but it changed very quickly to interdiction, a tactical mission. <b>Its</b> <b>ultimate</b> failure had two sources, both of which lay with the civilian and military policy-makers in Washington: first, neither group could ever conceive that the North Vietnamese would endure under the punishment that they would unleash upon it. The civilians, moreover, did not understand air power {{well enough to know}} that their policies might be crippling it; second, the American military leadership failed to initially propose and develop, or later to adapt, an appropriate strategy for the war.|$|E

5|$|Wang Mang {{initiated}} {{a series of}} major reforms that were ultimately unsuccessful. These reforms included outlawing slavery, nationalizing land to equally distribute between households, and introducing new currencies, a change which debased the value of coinage. Although these reforms provoked considerable opposition, Wang's regime met <b>its</b> <b>ultimate</b> downfall with the massive floods of c. 3 AD and 11 AD. Gradual silt buildup in the Yellow River had raised its water level and overwhelmed the flood control works. The Yellow River split into two new branches: one emptying {{to the north and}} the other to the south of the Shandong Peninsula, though Han engineers managed to dam the southern branch by 70 AD.|$|E

5|$|Several {{suggestions}} {{have been}} made {{for the history of}} the Great Stone. There was a succession of plagues in Manchester from the 14th century onwards, and during the Great Plague of 1655–56 the holes {{in the top of the}} stone were filled with vinegar or holy water, through which coins were passed in the belief that would halt the spread of the disease. But the holes are probably too deep for that to have been the stone's original purpose. It may have been a marker on the Roman road between Northwich and Manchester, or some kind of boundary marker. The Great Stone is also thought to have been the base of an Anglo-Saxon cross shaft. A local legend had it that the stone was slowly sinking into the earth, and that <b>its</b> <b>ultimate</b> disappearance would mark the end of the world.|$|E
5|$|The Church of Scientology depicts Hubbard in hagiographic {{terms and}} draws on his legacy as <b>its</b> <b>ultimate</b> source of {{doctrine}} and legitimacy. The Danish historian of religions Dorthe Refslund Christensen notes that {{many aspects of}} the official version of Hubbard's early life parallel more conventional religious narratives, notably the life of Jesus. Many details of Hubbard's early life remain disputed; critics of Scientology cast doubt on whether he had the educational and personal background claimed by the Church. According to James R. Lewis and Olav Hammer, in Scientology, this hagiographic “construction of Hubbard as a religious ideal implies the construction of Scientology’s texts as humanity’s most important treasure and vice versa.” Religious tradition in Scientology is based on two essential things, Hubbard’s individuality and texts written by him.|$|E
5|$|The Inn {{is run by}} Pension, <b>its</b> <b>ultimate</b> {{governing}} body. The name is {{peculiar to}} Gray's Inn—at Lincoln's Inn the governing body is called the Council, and at the Inner and Middle Temples {{it is called the}} Parliament. The name was used for the governing bodies of three of the Inns of Chancery—Barnard's Inn, Clement's Inn and New Inn. In Gray's Inn the Readers, when they existed, were required to attend Pension meetings, and other barristers were at one point welcome to, although only the Readers would be allowed to speak. Pension at Gray's Inn is made up of the Masters of the Bench, and the Inn as a whole is headed by the Treasurer, a senior Bencher. The Treasurer has always been elected, and since 1744 the office has rotated between individuals, with a term of one year.|$|E

5|$|Although <b>its</b> <b>ultimate</b> {{aim was to}} help {{defeat the}} {{communist}} forces in the Soviet Union, the Corps was used almost exclusively to fight the Partisans in areas of occupied Yugoslavia, initially in a defensive role. At its maximum strength, it was composed of one cavalry regiment and four infantry regiments. Between the autumn of 1941 and the spring of 1944, the Corps was primarily responsible for protecting weapons factories, mines, roads, and railroads throughout occupied Serbia in accordance with priorities established by the German High Command. The Corps never operated as a unified force, the regiment being its largest operational unit. The regiments were later assigned to act as auxiliaries to German or Bulgarian occupying forces. During its existence, it was reinforced with younger émigrés and former Soviet prisoners-of-war (POW). Russian émigrés living in Bulgaria, the Axis puppet Independent State of Croatia (NDH) and Hungary also came to Belgrade to join the force. It was armed by the Germans with weapons captured from the Royal Yugoslav Army, and its command language was Russian. Throughout its existence it maintained {{good relations with the}} Nedić administration.|$|E
5|$|Jennings won {{nine more}} games before his streak {{came to an}} end on November 30, 2004. He had {{extended}} his record total to $2,520,700 {{at the time of his}} defeat, after which he was awarded an additional $2,000 for finishing in second place per Jeopardy! rules. Shortly after Jennings' defeat, Jeopardy! decided to see how he would fare in tournament play. On February 9, 2005, the show launched <b>its</b> <b>Ultimate</b> Tournament of Champions, inviting back 144 other past champions to compete over the next three months in a five-round single-elimination tournament with a $2,000,000 grand prize. The field included the highest-winning five-time champions and winners of some previous tournaments, though not all invitees were able to participate. Jennings received a bye into the finals of the tournament, where he faced semi-final winners Jerome Vered and Brad Rutter in a three-game, cumulative total match. Vered had set a single-day scoring record during his appearance on the show in 1992, while Rutter had won the 2001 Tournament of Champions and the 2002 Million Dollar Masters tournament and was the show's highest-earning contestant of all-time before Jennings.|$|E
5|$|The Allies' {{failure to}} secure a bridge over the Lower Rhine spelled the end of Market Garden. While all other {{objectives}} had been achieved, the failure to secure the Arnhem road bridge over the Rhine meant that the operation failed in <b>its</b> <b>ultimate</b> objective. Field Marshal Montgomery claimed that the operation was 90% successful and the Allies did possess a deep salient into German occupied territory that was quickly reinforced. Milton Shulman observed that the operation had driven a wedge into the German positions, isolating the 15th Army north of Antwerp from the First Parachute Army {{on the eastern side}} of the bulge. This complicated the supply problem of the 15th Army and removed the chance of the Germans being able to assemble enough troops for a serious counterattack to retake Antwerp. Chester Wilmot agreed with this, claiming that the salient was of immense tactical value for the purpose of driving the Germans from the area south of the Maas and removing the threat of an immediate counterattack against Antwerp. Kershaw views the situation differently, observing that the north flank of the west wall was not turned and the 15th Army was able to escape. Dr. John Warren of the American Historical Division of the United States Air Force believed that the Allies now controlled a salient leading nowhere. John Waddy is of the belief that the strategic and tactical debate of Market Garden will never be resolved.|$|E
