25|$|I {{have written}} this letter {{to you on}} a happy day to me, {{which is also the}} last day of my life. <b>For</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been {{attacked}} by a painful inability to urinate, and also dysentery, so violent that nothing can be added to the violence of my sufferings. But the cheerfulness of my mind, which comes from the recollection of all my philosophical contemplation, counterbalances all these afflictions.

25|$|A {{great number}} of proverbs and sayings have {{developed}} around the activity of eating. From the innocent child's thank you: Săru-mâna pentru masă, c-a fost bună şi gustoasă, şi bucătăreasa frumoasa ("Thank you for the meal, it was good and tasty, and the cook was beautiful"), to the more philosophical Mulţumescu-ţi ţie Doamne, c-am mâncat şi iar mi-e foame ("Thank you Lord, <b>for</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> eaten, but I am hungry again"), Dragostea trece prin stomac ("Love passes through the stomach"), the simple Pofta vine mâncănd ("Appetite comes while eating"), the sarcastic Porcul mănâncă orice, dar se-ngraşă pentru alţii ("The pig would eat anything but it gets fat for others"), or the expression of total fulfillment, Mâncat bine, băut bine, dimineaţa sculat mort ("Ate well, drank well, in the morning woke up dead").|$|E
25|$|Winthrop {{also studied}} {{astronomy}} with his 3½ foot refracting telescope. In 1664, {{he wrote a}} letter to Sir Robert Moray regarding a “fifth satellite of Jupiter” that he believed he observed. This was only fifty years after Galileo discovered the first four moons of Jupiter. His letter was cautious since he thought it may be a faint star in close proximity to the other satellites. Winthrop requested that his observations be validated by Lawrence Rooke, Professor of Astronomy at Gresham College, but nothing was verified. Dr. Edward Emerson Barnard, who was credited for discovering Amalthea, Jupiter’s fifth moon, wrote “It makes me feel specially humiliated just now, <b>for</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> only caught the feeblest glimpses of the 5th satellite with the 40-inch during the past two years. Winthrop’s telescope must have been specially good for him to see this faint object with his imperfect instrument in 1664.” Although today it is assumed that Winthrop probably did see a faint star, he is still credited for being a dedicated and vigilant observer of natural phenomenon.|$|E
500|$|The Gospels relate {{that on the}} eve of his Crucifixion, Jesus Christ ate a {{meal with}} his disciples. [...] After the meal, it is {{recorded}} that Jesus washed their feet, and gave them the following mandatum or command: [...] "If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet, ye also ought to wash one another's feet. [...] <b>For</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> given you an example, that ye should do as I have done unto you." [...] Mandatum is the derivation of the word [...] "Maundy", and the Royal Maundy service evolved from Jesus' command to his disciples.|$|E

500|$|Emperor Francis [...] died on 18 August 1765, {{while he}} and the court were in Innsbruck celebrating the wedding of his second son, Leopold. Maria Theresa was devastated. Their eldest son, Joseph, became Holy Roman Emperor. Maria Theresa {{abandoned}} all ornamentation, had her hair cut short, painted her rooms black and dressed in mourning {{for the rest of}} her life. She completely withdrew from court life, public events, and theater. Throughout her widowhood, she spent the whole of August and the eighteenth of each month alone in her chamber, which negatively affected her mental health. She described her state of mind shortly after Francis's death: [...] "I hardly know myself now, <b>for</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> become like an animal with no true life or reasoning power." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Bertram Davis, [...] "For {{every person}} who remembers Sir John Hawkins {{as the author of}} the first {{full-length}} biography of Samuel Johnson, many remember him as the man Johnson once described as 'unclubable'." [...] Although [...] "unclubable" [...] reflects Hawkins's relationship with others of Johnson's circle, Johnson and Hawkins had a close friendship as Miss Reynolds describes: [...] "As we were returning from the meadows that day, I remember we met Sir John Hawkins, whom Dr. Johnson seemed much rejoiced to see; and no wonder, <b>for</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> often heard him speak of Sir John in terms expressive of great esteem and much cordiality of friendship" [...] Their relationship began around 1739 and they were both involved with The Gentleman's Magazine. Later, Hawkins was, in 1749, a member of Johnson's first club: the Ivy Lane club.|$|E
500|$|According to Maxwell's papers, {{when news}} of the {{destruction}} of the sandstone slab reached Bengal, James Prinsep asked the Governor of the Straits Settlements, Colonel William John Butterworth, to secure any legible fragments that might still exist and to send them to the Royal Asiatic Society's museum. Butterworth replied: [...] "The only remaining portion of the stone you mention, except what Colonel Low may have, I have found lying in the verandah of the Treasury at Singapore, where it was used as a seat by the Sepoys of the guard and persons in waiting to transact business. I lost no time in sending it to my house, but, alas! not before the inscription was nearly erased. Such as the fragment was then however – i.e., in 1843 – it is now; <b>for</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> preserved the stone with much care, and shall have much pleasure in sending it for your museum, having failed to establish one, as I hoped to have done, in Singapore." ...|$|E

60|$|Nay farther, {{the common}} motive of foreign adventures {{was taken away}} in me; <b>for</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> no fortune to make, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> nothing to seek: if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> gained ten {{thousand}} pounds, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been no richer; <b>for</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> already sufficient <b>for</b> me, and <b>for</b> those <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to leave it to, and that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> was visibly increasing; for having no great family, I could not spend the income of what <b>I</b> <b>had,</b> unless <b>I</b> would set up for an expensive way of living, such as a great family, servants, equipage, gaiety, and the like, which were things <b>I</b> <b>had</b> no notion of, or inclination to; so that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> nothing indeed to do, but to sit still, and fully enjoy what <b>I</b> <b>had</b> got, and see it increase daily upon my hands.|$|R

500|$|At {{four o'clock}} in the morning of 21 October Nelson ordered the Victory to turn towards the {{approaching}} enemy fleet, and signalled the rest of his force to battle stations. He then went below and made his will, before returning to the quarterdeck to carry out an inspection. Despite having 27 ships to Villeneuve's 33, Nelson was confident of success, declaring {{that he would not be}} satisfied with taking fewer than 20 prizes. He returned briefly to his cabin to write a final prayer, after which he joined Victory’s signal lieutenant, John Pasco. Mr Pasco, I wish to say to the fleet [...] "England confides that every man will do his duty". You must be quick, <b>for</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> one more signal to make, which is for close action. Pasco suggested changing confides to expects which, being in the Signal Book, could be signalled by the use of a single code (using three flags), whereas confides would have to be spelt out letter by letter. Nelson agreed, and the signal was hoisted.|$|E
500|$|In a 6 September 1777 letter, Johnson told Thrale to be [...] "punctual in annexing the dates. Chronology {{you know}} is the eye of history". However, the system of Ana allowed Thrale to group items by theme instead of by topics, like [...] "Odd medical Stories", to {{organize}} anecdotes, quotations, and stories. When Henry Thrale died while Thrale was writing Volume Three, the work became a diary for Thrale to discuss her thoughts and feelings after her loss. This volume soon began to describe Thrale's feelings for Gabriel Piozzi. Throughout the Thraliana, Thrale examines how others view her, which reveals her anxieties that she had about how she was perceived. This is especially true when she writes: [...] "Life has been to me nothing but a perpetual Canvass carried on {{in all parts of}} the World - not to make Friends neither - <b>for</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> certainly found very few - but to keep off Enemies". Thrale initially did not want to write in the sixth volume of the Thraliana, but did so because [...] "Johnson said that Pleasure might one day be made from such Nonsense, so I'll e'en finish this last Volume of Anecdote & store up no more Stuff". However she did not stop journal writing after she finished but continued to write for the remainder of her life.|$|E
500|$|Presiding {{over the}} trial was Sir William Chapple, a senior and {{respected}} judge in his early sixties. [...] The prosecution was directed by King's Counsel Thomas Place and Richard Crowle (brother of George), and proceedings were recorded by a York resident, Thomas Kyll. [...] Turpin had no defence barrister; {{during this period of}} English history, those accused had no right to legal representation, and their interests were cared for by the presiding judge. [...] Among the seven witnesses called to testify were Thomas Creasy, and James Smith, the man who had recognised Turpin's handwriting. [...] Turpin offered {{little in the way of}} questioning his accusers; when asked if he had anything to ask of Creasy, he replied [...] "I cannot say anything, <b>for</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> not any witnesses come this day, as I have expected, and therefore beg of your Lordship to put off my trial 'till another day", and when asked about Smith, he claimed not to know him. [...] When questioned himself, Turpin told the court that he had bought the mare and foal from an inn-keeper near Heckington. [...] He repeated his original story of how he had come to use the pseudonym Palmer, claiming that it was his mother's maiden name. [...] When asked by the judge for his name before he came to Lincolnshire, he said [...] "Turpin". [...] Without leaving the courtroom the jury found Turpin guilty of the first charge of stealing the mare and foal, and following further proceedings, guilty of stealing the gelding. [...] Throughout the trial Turpin had repeatedly claimed that he had not been allowed enough time to form his defence, that proceedings should be delayed until he could call his witnesses, and that the trial should be held at Essex. [...] Before sentencing him, the judge asked Turpin if he could offer any reason why he should not be sentenced to death; Turpin said: [...] "It is very hard upon me, my Lord, because I was not prepar'd for my Defence." [...] The judge replied: [...] "Why was you not? [...] You knew the Time of the Assizes as well as any Person here." [...] Despite Turpin's pleas that he had been told the trial would be held in Essex, the judge replied: [...] "Whoever told you so were highly to blame; and as your country have found you guilty of a crime worthy of death, it is my office to pronounce sentence against you", sentencing him to death.|$|E
