Once the target is known, the team {{does not have to}} worry about setting a winnable score. The team <b>just</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> limit the opposition to a low score, and bat well to successfully chase the target.

25|$|In figure 2, the process-data {{diagram of}} the {{delivery}} phase within CCU is depicted. This way of modeling was invented by Saeki (2003). On the left side {{you can see the}} meta-process model and on the right side the meta-data model. The two models are linked to each other by the relationships visualized as dotted lines. The meta-data model (right side) shows the concepts involved in the process and how the concepts are related to each other. For instance it is visible that a package consists of multiple parts, being the: software package, system description, manual, and license and management information. The numbers between the relations indicate in what quantity the concepts are related. For example the “1..1” between package and software package means that a package has to contain at least 1 software package and at the most 1 software package. So in this case a package <b>just</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> contain 1 software package. On {{the left side of the}} picture the process-data model is depicted. This consists of all the activities within the delivery process. This article is based on this process-data model. The meta-process model (left side of the process-data diagram) is divided into several parts which are presented along with the corresponding paragraphs throughout the article to make it easier to understand.|$|E

Roosevelt ran for an unprecedented fourth presidential term in 1944, Cooper campaigned for Thomas E. Dewey and criticized Roosevelt for being dishonest and adopting [...] "foreign" [...] ideas. In a radio address that {{he paid for}} himself {{just prior to the}} election, Cooper said, [...] "I disagree with the New Deal belief that the America all of us love is old and worn-out and finished—and has to borrow foreign notions that don't even seem to work any too well where they come from ...

500|$|Rhys forces Erin {{to miss a}} {{class and}} Barber {{revealed}} that Rhys feels no guilt about what he has done. He quipped [...] "His plan is falling into place perfectly. You'll see that Kate later tries to tell Erin what Rhys is up to. But the guy is a charmer {{and is able to}} make Erin believe that Kate is the one with the problem." [...] Rhys manages to convince Erin that Kate is a jealous ex-girlfriend and that he does not want her place on the program. Rhys charms Erin [...] "into his bed", but he is put out when she calls time on their relationship to focus on her studies. Rhys later learns Erin has turned up late for surgery and during dinner together, he spills wine on Erin's top. When she turns up at the hospital, she smells of alcohol. Rhys then implies to Karl that she has a drinking problem. Barber explained [...] "Rhys <b>just</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> plant the seed of doubt, fake some concern for his colleague, and rumour and innuendo does the rest..." [...] Erin quits the program, giving Rhys the chance to successfully apply for her place.|$|E

[...] However, he accidentally drenches Lois with boiling oil. While she is recovering, Child Protection Services take away Peter's custody of Meg, Chris, and Stewie {{on the grounds that}} Peter is mentally unfit to look after them. The three are placed in the care of Cleveland. When Brian tells Peter that he <b>just</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> show that he is a good parent, Peter thinks {{that the best way to}} do that is to show what a bad parent Cleveland is, so he brings seven prostitutes into Cleveland’s house. This does not work as Agent Jessup sees through the plot and Cleveland orders Peter and five of the prostitutes out. In a last attempt, he appeals to the court for custody of the children, but he is denied and avoids imprisonment only because the judge forgets that prisons exist.|$|E

500|$|In April 1997, {{the band}} convened at Buck's Kauai {{vacation}} home to record demos of material {{intended for the}} next album. The band sought to reinvent its sound and intended to incorporate drum loops and percussion experiments. Just as the sessions were due to begin in October, Berry decided, after months of contemplation and discussions with Downs and Mills, to tell {{the rest of the}} band that he was quitting. Berry told his bandmates that he would not quit if they would break up as a result, so Stipe, Buck, and Mills agreed to carry on as a three-piece with his blessing. Berry publicly announced his departure three weeks later in October 1997. Berry told the press, [...] "I'm just not as enthusiastic as I {{have been in the past}} about doing this anymore [...] [...] [...] I have the best job in the world. But I'm kind of ready to sit back and reflect and maybe not be a pop star anymore." [...] Stipe admitted that the band would be different without a major contributor: [...] "For me, Mike, and Peter, as R.E.M., are we still R.E.M.? I guess a three-legged dog is still a dog.

500|$|The {{producers}} of Enough wanted Lopez {{to write a}} new song for the film. According to Lopez, writing a song is something that cannot be forced; [...] "It kinda <b>just</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> happen". While on their honeymoon in October 2001, Cris Judd played Lopez a melody that he had written on the piano. She thought that the melody was [...] "really beautiful" [...] {{and that it would}} make a [...] "wonderful song". Lopez felt that a [...] "little bit of it sounded like the movie, a little haunting". When she heard the melody, Lopez said to herself: [...] "I can write something to that right now. And we can use it in Enough". She then began to think about the film and the character that she portrays and what she had been through. In addition, she also thought about the things that she had gone through in her own life. According to Lopez, it was easy to be inspired by the melody Judd had written, [...] "and just kind of that grateful feeling, to just be here [...] And keeping it simple. Because life can get so crazy and everything. And then you realize, it's all just kinda about the simplicity of being here, and being healthy. And being alive. So that's where the song came from." ...|$|E

[...] As far as live albums go, this is a job well done." [...] Stephen M. Deusner from Pitchfork gave a negative review for the album, stating [...] "Madonna herself is mostly to blame. On stage, she draws from a deep well of amazing pop songs and has the money and power to reinvent this sort of traveling circus. So why not try to break down the wall between performance and audience and hold a gigantic rave? [...] Åkerlund gives you everything you don't want from a concert film: incessant quick cuts that you give you no sense of space or stage, overdubbed music and vocals that give you no sense of performance, and only a few shots of the audience to gauge their excitement." [...] Mini Anthikad-Chhibber The Hindu commented that [...] "Madonna pulls out all stops in this effort turn the world into a dance floor and one <b>just</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> doff one's hat to her energy."

[...] Swift later {{contacted}} her management and asked if she could write a song with Caillat. They confirmed Caillat would be available due to a then upcoming concert in Nashville, Tennessee and, coincidentally, on the same day, Swift had a vacation day. According to Swift, [...] "Breathe" [...] is about having to depart from a someone, however, not blaming anyone. Swift believed the scenario was one of the most difficult goodbyes, [...] "when it's nobody's fault. It <b>just</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> end." [...] Swift explained, [...] "It was total therapy because I came in and I was like look, 'One of my best friends, I'm gonna have to not see anymore and it's not gonna be part of what I do. It's the hardest thing to go through. It's crazy listening to the song because you would think it's about a relationship and it's really about losing a friend and having a fallout." [...] Caillat and Swift said one of the beauties of the song was that many people would be able to relate to it because it is never specific as why the departure is occurring or whose fault it was.|$|E
500|$|Spears was {{credited}} with leading the revival of teen pop. The Daily Yomiuri reported that [...] "critics have hailed her as the most gifted teenage pop idol for many years, but Spears has set her sights a little higher-she is aiming for the level of superstardom that has been achieved by Madonna and Janet Jackson." [...] Rolling Stone wrote: [...] "Britney Spears carries on the classic archetype of the rock & roll teen queen, the dungaree doll, the angel baby who <b>just</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> make a scene." [...] Rami Yacoub who co-produced Spears's debut album with lyricist Max Martin commented, [...] "I know from Denniz Pop and Max's previous productions, when we do songs, there's kind of a nasal thing. With N' Sync and the Backstreet Boys, we had to push for that mid-nasal voice. When Britney did that, she got this kind of raspy, sexy voice." [...] Chuck Taylor of Billboard observed, [...] "Spears has become a consummate performer, with snappy dance moves, a clearly real-albeit young-and funkdified voice... "(You Drive Me) Crazy", her third single... demonstrates Spears' own development, proving that the 17-year-old is finding her own vocal personality after so many months of steadfast practice." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic referred to her music as a [...] "blend of infectious, rap-inflected dance-pop and smooth balladry." [...] Sputnikmusic writer Amanda Murray noted the album [...] "offers a marker for Spears' progression as an artist, as a celebrity, and as a woman." [...] In 2010, the album {{was included in the}} book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.|$|E
500|$|Dr. Impossible {{is used as}} an {{archetype}} or stock character supervillain. He {{is characterized}} as an evil genius or mad scientist who continually attempts {{to take control of}} the world's population. This is seen as a sub-type of the hero's journey and his calm deconstruction of his own futile, repetitive and self-destructive behaviours is compared to existentialist literature. The supervillains, especially Dr. Impossible, are portrayed as sympathetic characters afflicted with [...] "Malign Hypercognition Disorder", a psychological condition which makes highly intelligent people use their advantages to perform non-virtuous, or evil, actions. Grossman explained that from Dr. Impossible's point of view, he is not inherently evil but rejects societal norms: [...] "it's a matter of integrity — he's sticking to his principles, doing science his own way, pursuing his goals — even if it means the entire world is against him, even if he looks ridiculous in his costume, even if he knows he's going to lose. The superheroes are taking the conformist path, and getting all the applause." [...] From the literary point of view, Grossman believes the supervillains are more interesting characters, [...] "they are usually the most dynamic characters and the most creative. ... Their plans usually start with a great invention, which gives the story all its color and energy. The hero <b>just</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> come in and smash it up." [...] Grossman admitted that much of the Dr. Impossible character was inspired by his feelings as a graduate student, [...] "On the one hand, you're supposed to be really smart, and on the other hand, it's a humiliating experience. You're psyched about your intellect and kind of arrogant, but at the same time, you're [...] in the eyes of the world." ...|$|E

[...] An article published by Time in 2007 included the Gremlin as one of [...] "The 50 Worst Cars of All Time", describing it as an AMC Hornet with the rear end whacked off, and criticizing its exterior proportions, with a long low snout, long front overhang and a truncated tail, [...] "like the tail snapped off a salamander".|$|E
2500|$|One of Radwańska's main {{weaknesses}} is {{her lack}} of power in her serve. Her serve, especially her second serve, is generally slow and vulnerable to attack. Her shots sometimes lack penetration on court, posing little threat to power hitters. [...] "I don't think I can ever serve 200 kilometers per hour, it's just not my body," [...] Radwańska said. [...] "I {{have to do something}} else. I was just born to play like this. I have so many ideas. In your mind it's like, 'OK, I go down the line, then crosscourt, maybe drop shot.' But you have just one second, or even not one second, it <b>just</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> be automatic." [...] Radwańska merely exhales when she strikes the ball, rather than loudly grunting like many of her peers. She bounces the ball no more than four times before serving. She says she can play with any racket and likes to use one for an entire match, unlike most players, who routinely grab frames with fresh strings.|$|E
2500|$|The {{following}} season, Rypien {{made the}} Canucks' line-up out {{of training camp}} {{for the first time}} in his career. After scoring two goals in the first five games in 2008–09, he suffered a sports hernia on October 19, 2008. Upon recovering, he was granted an indefinite leave of absence for personal reasons. The Canucks organization alluded to Rypien's history of injuries as the main reason for him not returning to the team. Assistant general manager Lorne Henning stated that [...] "It's just wearing on him now - it's frustrating for him. He <b>just</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> deal with the injuries … and wrap his head around it." [...] It was later made known, following his death, that Rypien was struggling with clinical depression. He returned after a 70-game absence on March 31, 2009, in a contest against the Minnesota Wild. He appeared in 12 games for the Canucks in 2008–09, recording three goals and no assists. The season marked Vancouver's return to the playoffs after failing to qualify the previous season. After eliminating the St. Louis Blues in the first round, they were defeated in six games by the Chicago Blackhawks. Rypien appeared in all ten Canucks playoff games and recorded two points (both assists) while playing on the fourth-line alongside Darcy Hordichuk and Ryan Johnson. He recorded his first playoff point in Game 4 of the second round against Chicago, assisting on a Hordichuk goal with a spin-o-rama pass.|$|E
