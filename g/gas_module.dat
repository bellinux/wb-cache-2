40|$|Abstract. The paper {{develops}} <b>gas</b> detection <b>modules</b> for {{the intelligent}} building. The <b>modules</b> use many <b>gas</b> sensors to detect {{environment of the}} home and building. The gas sensors of the detection modules are classified two types. One is competitiveness <b>gas</b> detection <b>module,</b> and uses the same sensors to detect gas leakage. The other is complementation <b>gas</b> detection <b>module,</b> and uses variety sensors to classify multiple gases. The paper uses Bayesian estimation algorithm to be applied in competitiveness <b>gas</b> detection <b>module</b> and complementation <b>gas</b> detection <b>module,</b> and implement the proposed algorithm to be nice for variety gas sensor combination method. In the competitiveness <b>gas</b> detection <b>module,</b> we use two gas sensors to improve the proposed algorithm to be right. In the complementation <b>gas</b> detection <b>module,</b> we use a NH 3 sensor, an air pollution sensor, an alcohol sensor, a HS sensor, a smoke sensor, a CO sensor, a LPG sensor and a nature gas sensor, and can classify variety gases using Bayesian estimation algorithm. The controller of the two <b>gas</b> detection <b>modules</b> is HOLTEK microchip. The modules can communicate with the supervised computer via wire series interface or wireless RF interface, and cautions the user by the voice module.

40|$|AbstractAt {{the end of}} a CO 2 capture {{process the}} gas mixture {{composition}} can vary considerably incorporating components such as O 2, N 2, SOx, H 2 S, NyOx, H 2, CO, Ar at various concentration levels. These impurities, even if their concentrations are not significant from a health perspective, could lead to significant chemical reactivity towards reservoir or caprock minerals and well materials. Potential processes and impacts are not well documented yet. However, in the near future, it will be crucial for both operators and regulators to rely on numerical reactive-transport simulations able to model the behavior of these complex systems and consequently able to ensure the long-term stability of storage sites. Furthermore, numerous modeling studies have shown how limiting it could be to consider simple assumptions for gases such as “dissolved gases only” or “infinite sources of gas”, and also {{how important it is to}} correctly handle the gaseous phase. Recently, within the GAZ ANNEXES project funded by the ANR (French national research agency), we developed gas modules for both the geochemical code CHESS and the coupled reactive/transport code HYTEC. These advances make it now possible to simulate water/gas/rock interactions accurately. Within this project, some of the potential co-injected impurities were experimentally studied, highlighting their influence on the geochemical reactivity of some carbonate rocks involved in CCS. In this paper, the new <b>gas</b> <b>module</b> of CHESS is presented as well as its ability to reproduce these experimental results giving an important help to study both qualitatively and quantitatively the impact of co-injected gases. One key result for the experiments involving a gas mixture (82 %mol CO 2 (g), 6 % Ar(g), 4 % N 2 (g), 4 % SO 2 (g) and 4 % O 2 (g)), which are the closest to real operations: both experimental and numerical results indicate a relative low reactivity of the rock...|$|E
40|$|Currently 52 % of the world's {{population}} {{resides in}} urban areas and as a consequence, approximately 70 % of fossil fuel emissions of CO 2 arise from cities. This fact in combination with large uncertainties associated with quantifying urban emissions {{due to lack of}} appropriate measurements makes it crucial to obtain new measurements useful to identify and quantify urban emissions. This is required, for example, for the assessment of emission mitigation strategies and their effectiveness. Here we investigate the potential of a satellite mission like Carbon Monitoring Satellite (CarbonSat), proposed to the European Space Agency (ESA) – to retrieve the city emissions globally, taking into account a realistic description of the expected retrieval errors, the spatiotemporal distribution of CO 2 fluxes, and atmospheric transport. To achieve this we use (i) a high-resolution modeling framework consisting of the Weather Research Forecasting model with a greenhouse <b>gas</b> <b>module</b> (WRF-GHG), which is used to simulate the atmospheric observations of column averaged CO 2 dry air mole fractions (XCO 2), and (ii) a Bayesian inversion method to derive anthropogenic CO 2 emissions and their errors from the CarbonSat XCO 2 observations. We focus our analysis on Berlin in Germany using CarbonSat's cloud-free overpasses for one reference year. The dense (wide swath) CarbonSat simulated observations with high-spatial resolution (approx. 2 km × 2 km) permits one to map the city CO 2 emission plume with a peak enhancement of typically 0. 8 – 1. 35 ppm relative to the background. By performing a Bayesian inversion, it is shown that the random error (RE) of the retrieved Berlin CO 2 emission for a single overpass is typically less than 8 to 10 MtCO 2 yr− 1 (about 15 to 20 % of the total city emission). The range of systematic errors (SE) of the retrieved fluxes due to various sources of error (measurement, modeling, and inventories) is also quantified. Depending on the assumptions made, the SE is less than about 6 to 10 MtCO 2 yr− 1 for most cases. We find that in particular systematic modeling-related errors can be quite high during the summer months due to substantial XCO 2 variations caused by biogenic CO 2 fluxes at and around the target region. When making the extreme worst-case assumption that biospheric XCO 2 variations cannot be modeled at all (which is overly pessimistic), the SE of the retrieved emission is found to be larger than 10 MtCO 2 yr− 1 for about half of the sufficiently cloud-free overpasses, and for some of the overpasses we found that SE may even be on the order of magnitude of the anthropogenic emission. This indicates that biogenic XCO 2 variations cannot be neglected but must be considered during forward and/or inverse modeling. Overall, we conclude that CarbonSat is well suited to obtain city-scale CO 2 emissions as needed to enhance our current understanding of anthropogenic carbon fluxes and that CarbonSat or CarbonSat-like satellites should be an important component of a future global carbon emission monitoring system...|$|E
