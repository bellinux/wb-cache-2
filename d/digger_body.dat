50|$|Grave Digger's origins, {{the imagery}} {{associated}} with the truck, and the truck's wild reputation, are all {{considered part of the}} mystique of the truck and have contributed to its continued popularity. Although originally a Ford, the 1950 Chevy Panel Van body is now considered the traditional Grave <b>Digger</b> <b>body</b> style and {{is not likely to be}} changed in the foreseeable future. Likewise, the paint scheme, combining green flames, letters dripping blood, a foggy graveyard scene with tombstones bearing names of competitors, a haunted house silhouetted by a full moon, and a giant skull shaped ghost, is considered a part of what Grave Digger is and, although being tweaked over the years, has not strayed far from the first incarnation of the paintwork from 1986.|$|E

50|$|In {{the summer}} of 1747, a peat <b>digger</b> {{unearthed}} the <b>body</b> of a woman through roughly six feet of peat moss. The man quickly fled after his shovel struck a shoe with partial remains of a human foot still inside. The following October, Dr. George Stovin, after hearing of the discovery set out with his team to finish the excavation. Dr. Stovin concluded that the woman's body was bent so her head and feet were close to touching. Stovin described the skin of corpse to be strong. With the body, {{a pair of shoes}} were found, one of which was damaged by the shovel of its discoverer. The sandals were said to have tawny color and to be pliable. The bones of the woman's foot were found inside of the sandals, as the bones of the arms and thighs were found inside of the skin. The hand and fingernails were described to have been well preserved, however, they had been lost when they were sent for study.|$|R
