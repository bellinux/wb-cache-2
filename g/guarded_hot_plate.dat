40|$|The {{objective}} of this research work {{was to develop a}} thin film thermal conductivity probe for measuring thermal property of construction materials. This probe was developed based on the line heat sourceprinciple. The thermal conductivity can be determined from the slope of linear relation between the temperature differences ΔT and logarithm of time ln(t). The probe was tested by measuring the thermal conductivityof three kinds of specimens comprising of polystyrene foam (PS), autoclaved aerated concrete (ACC) and gypsum board (GB) The range of electrical power supply rate for the probe was varied from 0. 15 to 1. 59 W. The thermal conductivity values obtained with this method were greater compared to the results obtained using the ASTM C 177. The difference of thermal conductivity between line two methods decreasedwith the increase of the power supply rate. The mean difference for PS, ACC and GB was 4. 33 %, 6. 15 % and 42. 34 % respectively. According to the restriction of minimum thickness requirement of specimen for testingwith the <b>guard</b> <b>hot</b> <b>plate</b> apparatus (ASTM C 177), it was necessary to overlay one GB slab on another.

40|$|The {{effect of}} aging (oxidation) of {{aluminum}} <b>hot</b> <b>plates</b> in ambient air at 550 oC {{and the surface}} roughness of <b>hot</b> <b>plates</b> was studied to investigate the correlation between <b>hot</b> <b>plate</b> emissivity and wafer temperature at low temperatures (200 – 500 oC). Four different types of wafers (i. e. p- Si, p++ Si, GaAs and quartz) and <b>hot</b> <b>plates</b> with three different surface conditions were tested. As aging time elapsed, the emissivity gradually increased and approached specific saturated values depending on its surface roughness. The <b>hot</b> <b>plate</b> with rougher surface resulted in a larger emissivity value than a plate with smoother surface. There was good correlation between the emissivity of the aluminum <b>hot</b> <b>plate</b> and wafer temperature.

The measuring apparatus, a Wind Box which has been designed and developed at the Department of Building Physics is described. This apparatus is a prototype; its main difference from a traditional <b>guarded</b> <b>hot</b> <b>plate</b> apparatus is its large measuring area (0. 6 x 1. 2 m) over which the material can be installed up to a thickness of 0. 5 m and its thermal resistance when exposed to an upwards heat flux determined. In designing the measuring process, calculation of the maximum systematic error has been a control parameter; this is less than 6 %. The study includes a review of the literature, measurements in a horizontal <b>guarded</b> <b>hot</b> <b>plate</b> apparatus, measurements in the Wind Box and calculations with a recently developed simulation program (CONVBOX) for three-dimensional convection problems.

Also, the <b>hot</b> <b>plate</b> test yields significant results for only certain analgesics. Non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have an analgesic effect in humans.

30|$|The {{testing methods}} and {{procedure}} for {{the measurement of}} the TCC are also complicated and time-consuming. In general, there are three methods of measuring the TCC: the two-linear parallel probe method, the plane heat source method, and the <b>hot</b> <b>guarded</b> <b>plate</b> method (Morabito 1989; Carslaw and Jaeger 1959; Nevile 1995). All the three methods based on similar basic principles require additional efforts to cut the specimen thin and firmly place the thermal probe on/in the specimen, as well as long time control of the dependent and independent variables during the entire testing. Moreover, the conditions of concrete structures exposed to real environmental conditions might differ from those experimentally controlled. Therefore, {{for the evaluation of}} temperature distributions and thermal behaviors in the current state of concrete structures, an accurate prediction {{of the value of the}} TCC that can account for all these characteristics of the concrete is essential but very complex. For this reason, to investigate the complexity and influences of numerous factors on the TCC, we have employed a back-propagation neural algorithm that emerged as a new alternative to complicated pattern recognition in many fields such as the medical and biochemistry field.|$|R
