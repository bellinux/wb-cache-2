The majority of the gift related <b>inscriptions</b> are for land endowments, followed by goods, cash endowments, cows and oil for lighting lamps. The town of Tiruvannamalai was at a strategic crossroads during the Vijayanagara Empire, connecting sacred centers of pilgrimage and military routes.

The cave <b>inscriptions,</b> deciphered in 1966, have been dated to the 2nd century BC and record the gift of a monastery by Pandyan king Nedunj Cheliyan to a Jain monk. These <b>inscriptions</b> are also the oldest Jain <b>inscriptions</b> in South India and among the oldest in all of India.
