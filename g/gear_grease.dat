5000|$|<b>Gear</b> <b>greases</b> {{consist of}} rosin oil, {{condensed}} with lime and stirred with mineral oil, with some percentage of water. Special-purpose greases contain glycerol and sorbitan esters. They are used, for example, in low-temperature conditions. Some greases are labeled [...] "EP", which indicates [...] "extreme pressure". Under high pressure or shock loading, normal grease {{can be compressed}} {{to the extent that}} the greased parts come into physical contact, causing friction and wear.|$|R

40|$|Effects of hydrocarbon-based greases on {{specific}} rapid prototype (RP) materials used to fabricate grease retention shrouds (GRS) were explored in this study. Grease retention shrouds are being {{considered as a}} way to maintain adequate grease lubrication at the gear mesh in a prototype research transmission system. Due to their design and manufacturing flexibility, rapid prototype materials were chosen for the grease retention shrouds. In order {{to gain a better understanding}} of the short and long term effects grease pose on RP materials, research was conducted on the interaction of hydrocarbon-based grease with RP materials. The materials used in this study were durable polyamide (nylon), acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), and WaterClear 10120. Testing was conducted using Mobilgrease 28 and Syn-Tech 3913 G <b>grease</b> (<b>gear</b> coupling <b>grease).</b> These greases were selected due to their regular use with mechanical components. To investigate the effect that grease has on RP materials, the following methods were used to obtain qualitative and quantitative data: Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), interference profilometer measurements, digital camera imaging, physical shape measurement, and visual observations. To record the changes in the RP materials due to contact with the grease, data was taken before and after the grease application. Results showed that the WaterClear 10120 RP material provided the best resistance to grease penetration as compared to nylon and ABS RP materials. The manufacturing process, and thus resulting surface conditions of the RP material, played a key role in the grease penetration properties and resilience of these materials...|$|R

When further hits failed to materialise, he subsequently became better known as a session guitarist, appearing and recording with Bryan Ferry, Roxy Music, Elton John, Brian Eno, Jack Bruce, Nick Mason, Art Garfunkel, Typically Tropical, Katie Melua, and Ginger Baker, amongst others. During the mid-1970s, he even {{took part in the}} Wombles' UK tour in full furry costume, whilst wielding his trademark Gibson Flying V. His own album Chris Spedding (1975) was produced by Mickie Most. Spedding recorded a version of the American singer-songwriter Garland Jeffreys' song, [...] "Wild in the Streets", on his own Hurt album. The song has since been covered by the Circle Jerks and is featured on Tony Hawk's American Wasteland.|$|R
40|$|Lubricating grease is {{commonly}} applied to lubricate e. g. rolling bearings, seals and <b>gears.</b> <b>Grease</b> has some clear advantages over lubricating oil. It is a semi-solid material, which prevents it from flowing/leaking {{out from the}} lubricated system and gives it sealing properties, protecting the system against contaminants. Unlike oil, grease has a much more complicated rheology, which {{makes it more difficult}} to model and understand grease flow. Grease acts as a lubricant reservoir, and understanding grease flow is essential in order to model and predict how grease is transported within e. g., a rolling element bearing housing, a sealing arrangement or replenishment of a <b>gear</b> mesh. Three <b>greases</b> with different rheological behaviors (NLGI 2 grease, NLGI 1 grease and NLGI 00 grease) have been used in two kinds of test rigs: a straight channel with different restrictions and a rotating shaft with two narrow gap sealing-like restrictions. In the first test rig two types of flow restrictions were applied into a straight channel in order to simulate flow of grease near a sealing pocket. In the case of a single restriction, the distance required for the velocity profile to fully develop when going from a wide to a narrow gap is approximately the same as the initial height of the channel. In the corner pocket before and after the restriction, the velocity is very low and part of the grease is stationary. For the channel with two flow restrictions, this effect is even more pronounced in the “pocket” between the restrictions. Clearly, {{a large part of the}} grease is not moving since the yield stress of the grease is not exceeded. This condition particularly applies to the cases with a low-pressure gradient and where high consistency grease is used. In practice this means that grease is not replaced in such “pockets” and that some aged/contaminated grease will remain there. A test rig comprising of a rotating shaft with two narrow gap sealing-like restrictions (a so called Double Restriction Seal, DRS) was designed to simulate the a labyrinth type of seal. Two different gap heights in the DRS have been designed to compare grease flow. It is shown that partially yielded grease is detected in the large gap geometry and fully yielded grease in the small gap geometry. Grease shear thinning behavior and wall slip effects have been detected and discussed. For the small gap geometry, it is shown that three distinct grease flow regions are present: a slip layer close to the stationary wall, a bulk flow layer, and a slip layer near the rotating shaft.

40|$|Lubricating grease is {{commonly}} applied to lubricate e. g. rolling bearings, sealsand <b>gears.</b> <b>Grease</b> has some clear advantages over lubricating oil: it is a semisolidmaterial, which prevents it from flowing/ leaking {{out from the}} bearingsystem and gives it sealing properties, and it also protects the system fromcontaminants and corrosion. Due to its consistency, lubricating grease has manyadditional advantages over lubricating oil: {{it does not require}} pumps, filters andsumps. However, the rheology of grease makes it more difficult to measure andstudy its flow dynamics. This study focuses on the influence of rheology ongrease flow in different geometries involving a straight channel with restrictions,concentric cylinder geometry, and free-surface flow on a rotating disc. To better understand grease flow in bearings and seals, two types of flowrestrictions were applied into the straight channel in order to simulate the flowof grease near a seal pocket. In the case of a single restriction, the horizontaldistance required for the velocity profile to fully develop is approximately thesame as the height of the channel. In the corner before and after the restriction,the velocities are very low and part of the grease is stationary. For the channelwith two flow restrictions, this effect is even more pronounced in the narrowspace between the restrictions. Clearly, {{a large part of the}} grease is not moving. This condition particularly applies in the case of a low-pressure gradient andwhere high-consistency grease is used. In practice this means that grease may belocally trapped and consequently old/contaminated grease will remain in theseal pockets. A configuration comprising a rotating shaft and two narrow gap sealing-likerestrictions (also called Double Restriction Seal, DRS) was designed to simulatea sealing contact. Two different gap heights in the DRS have been used tocompare the grease flow. It is shown that partially yielded grease flow isdetected in the large gap geometry and fully yielded grease flow in the small gapgeometry. For the small gap geometry, it is shown that three distinct grease flowregions are present: a slip layer close to the stationary wall, a bulk flow layer,and a slip layer near the rotating shaft. The shear thinning behaviour of thegrease and its wall slip effects have been determined and discussed. Free-surface flow of grease occurs in a variety of situations such as during relubrication and inside a rolling element bearing which is filled to about 30 %with grease in order to prevent heavy churning. Here the reflow of lubricant tothe bearing races is a key point in the lubricant film build-up, and centrifugalforces have a direct impact on the amount of available grease. Understanding ofthe free-surface flow behaviour of grease is hence important for theunderstanding of the lubrication mechanism. Adhesion and mass loss aremeasured for greases with different rheology on different surfaces andtemperatures. It is shown that the critical speed at which the grease starts tomove is mostly determined by grease type, yield stress and temperature ratherthan surface material. A developed analytical model covers a stationary analysisof the flow resulting in solutions for the velocity profile of the grease as well as asolution for the thickness of the viscous layer remaining on the disc.

5000|$|The main use of ZDDP is in {{anti-wear}} additives to lubricants such as <b>greases,</b> <b>gear</b> oils, {{and motor}} oils, which usually contain from 600ppm for some modern energy conserving low viscosity oils to 2000ppm of this additive in some racing oils. It {{has been reported}} that zinc and phosphorus emissions may damage catalytic converters and standard formulations of lubricating oils for gasoline engines now have reduced amounts of the additive due to the API limiting the concentration of this additive in new API SM and SN oils, however this only affects 20 and 30 grade [...] "ILSAC" [...] oils, 40 and higher grades have no regulation regarding the concentration of ZDDP except for diesel oils meeting the API CJ-4 specification which have had the level of zddp reduced slightly, although most diesel Heavy Duty Engine oils still have a higher concentration of this additive. [...] Crankcase oils with reduced ZDDP have been cited as causing damage to, or failure of, classic/collector car flat tappet camshafts and lifters which undergo very high boundary layer pressures and/or shear forces at their contact faces, and in other regions such as big-end/main bearings, and piston rings and pins. Roller camshafts/followers are more commonly used to reduce camshaft lobe friction in modern engines. There are additives, such as STP(R) Oil Treatment, and some racing oils such as PurOl, Brad Penn and Valvoline VR-1, which are available in the retail market with the necessary amount of ZDDP for engines using increased valve spring pressures. The same ZDDP compounds serve also as corrosion inhibitors and antioxidants.|$|R
