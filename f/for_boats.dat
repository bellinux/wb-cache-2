5|$|St Kilda has an {{extensive}} marina with floating moorings for about 50 boats, two boat ramps and a sheltered channel {{out into the}} Barker Inlet, part of Gulf St Vincent. Recently expanded the marina now has hard stands <b>for</b> <b>boats</b> and some slipping facilities.|$|E
5|$|In 1976, the BWB decided after {{a meeting}} with local councils that the Forth and Clyde Canal, {{fragmented}} by various developments, was to have its remaining navigability preserved by building new bridges with sufficient headroom <b>for</b> <b>boats</b> and continuing to maintain the existing locks. Restoration of sea-to-sea navigation was deemed too expensive at the time, but {{there were to be}} no further restrictions on its use. A 1979 survey report documented 69 obstructions to navigation, and sought the opinions of twenty interested parties to present the Forth and Clyde Local (Subject) Plan in 1980.|$|E
5|$|On October1, a {{day before}} the {{hurricane}} moved ashore, the U.S. Weather Bureau issued northeast storm signals from Key West, Florida to Norfolk, Virginia. Similar warnings were issued in the hours preceding the hurricane moving ashore. The advisories were credited with saving dozens of lives {{and millions of dollars}} in shipping cargo, due to advance warning <b>for</b> <b>boats</b> to remain ashore.|$|E

5|$|The docking-pit is a drydock-like port {{isolated}} from the lower canal basin by means of watertight gates and kept dry by means of water pumps. When the wheel stops with its arms in the vertical position it is possible <b>for</b> <b>boats</b> to enter and exit the lower caisson when the gates are open without flooding the docking-pit. The space below the caisson is empty.|$|E
5|$|The {{loss of the}} Levin J. Marvel {{during the}} {{hurricane}} prompted the United States Congress {{to pass a law}} in 1956, which allowed the Coast Guard to inspect all vessels with more than six passengers; the previous law only allowed inspections <b>for</b> <b>boats</b> of more than 700tons, greatly higher than the 183tons that the Marvel weighed. A federal courthouse charged the inexperienced captain with negligence, giving him a one-year probation.|$|E

5|$|During the Second World War, the Albert Dock was requisitioned by the Admiralty {{serving as}} a base <b>for</b> <b>boats</b> of the British Atlantic Fleet. The complex was damaged during air raids on Liverpool, notably during the May Blitz of 1941. In the {{aftermath}} of the war, the financial problems of the owners and the general decline of docking in the city meant that the future of the Albert Dock was uncertain. Numerous plans were developed for the re-use of the buildings but none came to fruition and in 1972 the dock was finally closed. Having lain derelict for nearly ten years, the redevelopment of the dock began in 1981, when the Merseyside Development Corporation was set up, with the Albert Dock being officially re-opened in 1984.|$|E
5|$|In {{the city}} centre of Bath it passes under various bridges {{including}} the Midland Bridge which was originally {{built by the}} Midland Railway Company to allow the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway access to and from its Green Park Terminus Station. In November 2011 the navigation between Bath and Bristol was closed because of safety concerns about Victoria Bridge. Weston Lock {{on the outskirts of}} Bath is in what now forms the Newbridge. Weston Cut is a man made channel, opened in 1727, <b>for</b> <b>boats</b> to approach and pass through Weston Lock, which created an island between the cut and the river weir, which became known as Dutch Island after the owner of the brass mill established on the riverside in the early 18th century.|$|E
5|$|Modern day native {{groups such}} as the Yurok, Tolowa, Karok, Chilula, and Wiyot all have {{historical}} ties to the region, and some Native American groups still live in the park area today. Archaeological study shows they arrived in the area as far back as 3,000 years ago. An 1852 census determined that the Yurok were the most numerous, with 55 villages and an estimated population of 2,500. They used the abundant redwood, which with its linear grain was easily split into planks, as a building material <b>for</b> <b>boats,</b> houses, and small villages. For buildings, the planks would be erected side by side in a narrow trench, with the upper portions bound with leather strapping and held by notches cut into the supporting roof beams. Redwood boards were used to form a shallow sloping roof.|$|E

Due to the presence of the Intracoastal Waterway, the bridge is required to frequently open <b>for</b> <b>boat</b> traffic to pass through.|$|R
5|$|Passage through Hull {{had long}} been difficult, {{because of the number}} of ships which used the river for loading and {{unloading}} goods. In 1794, the merchants of Beverley had advocated the building of docks at Hull, with a separate entrance, so that traffic to the upper river would not be impeded, while the Driffield Navigation had unsuccessful attempted to get a clause inserted into the Act of Parliament which the Hull Dock Company obtained in 1840, to ensure free passage for vessels, and the removal of tolls <b>for</b> <b>boats</b> not using the docks. The Navigation Company also received complaints from the Beverley and Barmston Drainage Commissioners, who believed that water levels were being kept at a higher level than was good for drainage.|$|E
5|$|River {{traffic and}} {{railroad}} traffic were increasingly {{in competition with}} each other. In October 1879 a disaster was narrowly avoided when a seven-coach passenger train with 800 people on board approached the open swing bridge too fast and was barely able to stop in time, ending up with its front wheels hanging off the approach road over the river. Meanwhile, boats on the river were getting larger and finding {{it increasingly difficult to}} navigate the bridges {{at the mouth of the}} north branch, so the Army Corps of Engineers ordered the clearing of three swing bridges near Kinzie Street that were obstructing river traffic. Therefore, in 1907 construction started on a new bascule bridge that would allow more space <b>for</b> <b>boats</b> to pass by on the river.|$|E
5|$|Until {{the twentieth}} century, access to Padstow's harbour was via a narrow channel between the Doom Bar and the cliffs at Stepper Point, a {{difficult}} passage for sailing ships to navigate especially in north-westerly gales when the cliffs would {{cut off the}} wind. Many ships were wrecked on the Doom Bar, despite the installation of mooring rings and capstans on the cliffs and quarrying away part of Stepper Point to improve the wind. In {{the early twentieth century}} the main channel moved away from the cliffs, and continued dredging has made it much safer <b>for</b> <b>boats,</b> but deaths have occurred on the bar as recently as 1997.|$|E

5|$|The first {{prototype}} pylon {{was developed}} by Martin Jehart of Bellutti Protection Systems, an Austrian engineering firm specializing in the manufacturing of technical materials and tarpaulin. They initially used a latex balloon for crash tests and aerodynamic studies and after many tests and research settled {{on the use of}} a combination of different materials, the crucial component being spinnaker ripstop nylon, an extremely lightweight and flexible material used for making sails <b>for</b> <b>boats.</b> This would prove to be a breakthrough {{in the development of the}} Air Gates producing a pylon that would rip instantaneously when hit by a plane. Over 70 tests of the pylon were carried out on the ground using a car with a wing strapped on the roof before they were ready to undergo tests with a real plane. Eight different cars were used in these tests as well as a trailer and truck. Hungarian pilot, Péter Besenyei worked closely with the team and attempted the first deliberate pylon hit in early 2003 with positive results. The first Air Gates, which were cylindrical, were finally ready to be used at the very first Red Bull Air Races held in Austria and Hungary later that year.|$|E
