40|$|The {{isolation}} of individual enantiomers of drugs {{is an important}} subject {{of interest in the}} pharmaceutical and medical fields, because stereochemistry can {{have a significant effect on}} the biological activity of the drug. Therefore, it is important to develop enantiomeric separation methods for the determination of the optical purity of drugs, since the undesired enantiomer is regarded as one of the impurities. The available single isomer anionic cyclodextrins (CD) can resolve the enantiomers of only a few weakly acidic analytes. To rectify this problem, the chloride salts of heptakis(6 -deoxy- 6 -morpholinio) -cyclomaltoheptaose (HMBCD), and mono(6 - deoxy- 6 -N,N,N r,N r,N r-pentamethylethylenediammonio) -cyclomaltoheptaose (PEMEDA-BCD), the first members of the permanently charged, single-isomer cationic cyclodextrin family, have been synthesized.

Contrary to expectation, the multiply charged HMBCD showed poor complexation with the newly synthesized strong electrolyte test analytes. The weak binding between the analytes and HMBCD resulted in separation of enantiomers of only three strong electrolyte analytes. Strong complexation was observed between PEMEDA-BCD and the anionic and nonionic analytes in both low and high pH buffers, though complexation was stronger in the high pH buffer.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to rationalise {{retention}} behaviour of a chiral solute on molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) HPLC stationary phases in terms of variation of the mobile phase. It is generally held that the most important interaction governing the separation of enantiomers on such materials is H-bonding, and that retention times increase with decreasing H-bonding potential of the mobile phase. Previous studies have largely concerned mobile phases containing chloroform with acetic acid as a polar modifier. Boc-L-Phenylalanine (Boc-L-Phe-OH) MIPs were prepared, processed, and packed into HPLC columns, which were then used to investigate the retention characteristics of Boc-L-Phe-OH and Boc-D-Phe-OH with a range of mobile phases. The main observations were as follows: (1) in chloroform-based mobile phases there was generally a linear relationship between the H-bond donator factor of the polar modifier and capacity (K′). Results also indicated a hydrogen bond donor parameter value for a polar modifier at which retention became concentration independent; (2) For given values of K′L, K′D varied depending on the polar modifier, indicating that <b>enantiomer</b> <b>resolution</b> was solvent dependent; (3) Using mobile phases based on solvents of lower polarity/H-bonding potential than chloroform, substantial increases in K′ were observed, although enantioselectivity was greatly reduced...|$|E

The {{structures of the}} new selectors were designed to limit the interactions between the L-valine derivative and cyclodextrin by removing the amino acid moiety from the cyclodextrin cavity {{by means of an}} amide linkage on mono- 6 -amino permethylated β-CD or the insertion of a carboxymethyl group. The accessibility of the amino acid group moiety was thus facilitated. The new mixed selectors exhibited better enantioselectivity than Chirasil-L-Val for half (selector based on mono- 6 -amino permethylated β-CD) or more (selector with the carboxymethyl group) of the 41 amino acid derivatives. Molecular modeling confirmed that these results could be attributed to an increase in the distance between the chiral center of the amino acid and the cyclodextrin cavity allowing better access of the amino acid moiety. These new mixed chiral selectors demonstrated a novel enantioselective capability with the successful separation of more than 90 racemic mixtures among the 105 chiral compounds tested. These mixed selectors exhibited enhanced enantioselectivity in comparison to binary selectors previously described with respect to both <b>enantiomer</b> <b>resolution</b> and the number of separated chiral compounds.

40|$|An {{increased}} demand for enantiopure compounds has induced a significant effort {{in the development of}} enantiomer separation technologies. The conventional path to obtain homochiral products at a preparative scale is diastereoisomer crystallization. Disadvantages of this separation process are costly scale-up and have a high energy requirement. An alternative can be ultrafiltration (UF) of enantioselective micelles, which is an easily scalable process with a low energy requirement. The micelles preferentially form a complex with one of the enantiomers. Only unbound enantiomers can pass the membrane during the UF process. The work described in this paper aims at the description of the complexation of phenylalanine enantiomers by cholesteryl- -glutamate anchored in nonionic micelles of nonyl-phenyl polyoxyethylene [E 10] ether (NNP 10). The description of this model system is used to develop a separation process capable of complete <b>enantiomer</b> <b>resolution</b> from their racemic mixtures. The influence of membrane rejection and of non-selective complexation on the apparent selectivity is investigated. Both statistical analyses of complexation models and UF experiments {{in the absence of a}} chiral selector show that membrane rejection and non-selective complexation are not significant compared to enantioselective complexation. It is concluded that the complexation can be described by straightforward competitive multicomponent Langmuir isotherms. The apparent enantioselectivity appears to be constant over a wide concentration range and equals 1. 4. Only at extremely low total enantiomer concentrations the selectivity increases to a value of 4. 5. A multi-stage separation process is required in order to separate a racemate for 99. 9 %.

40|$|Spin {{selective}} MQ-SQ correlation {{has been}} demonstrated by either selective pulses in homo-nuclear spin systems in isotropic and weakly orienting chiral media or by nonselective pulses in hetero-nuclear spin systems in strongly aligned media. As {{a consequence of the}} spin selective correlation, the coherence transfer pathway from MQ to SQ is spin state selective. This two dimensional approach enables the utilization of the passive couplings (remote couplings) to break a complex one dimensional spectrum into many sub spectra. Each sub spectrum contains fewer transitions and hence fewer couplings (active couplings). The role of the passive couplings is to displace the sub spectra and measurement of the displacements taking into account their relative tilt provides the magnitude of the passive couplings along with relative signs. Further possibility of a spin state selective MQ-SQ resolved experiment to determine very small remote couplings otherwise buried within linewidth in one dimensional spectrum {{has been demonstrated}}. The resolution of the multiple quantum spectrum in indirect dimension has also been exploited to separate the sub spectra. The technique renders the analysis of complex spectrum in isotropic system much simpler. The potentialities of the technique have also been demonstrated for discrimination of optical enantiomers and derivation of the residual dipolar couplings from very complicated spectrum. The second order spectrum in strongly aligned media restrict selective excitation, however in hetero-nuclear spin system the nonselective pulses on protons do not interact with the hetero-nuclear spins. Thus the weakly coupled part of a strongly coupled spectrum has been exploited for simplifying the second order spectrum and thereby its analysis. Thus several methodologies derived from spin selective correlation has been demonstrated. Enantiopure spectrum has been recorded from a mixture of R and S enantiomers by a novel pulse scheme called Double Quantum Selective Refocusing Experiment. The dipolar coupled methyl protons in weakly orienting media are utilized. The selective excitation of double quantum coherence reduces the three spin system into a two spin system and remote couplings are refocused which otherwise leads to broadening. The sum of passive couplings being different for the <b>enantiomers</b> <b>resolution</b> in the DQ dimension is enhanced and thereby their discrimination.

The determination of all the spectral parameters by the analyses of such intricate NMR spectra poses challenges,such as, unraveling of the resonances for each <b>enantiomer,</b> spectral <b>resolution,</b> and simplification of the multiplet pattern.

HAMS has been used as chiral resolving agent for the CE separation of a set of nonionic, weak base and strong acid enantiomers in pH 2. 5 background electrolytes. Rapid separations with satisfactory peak resolution values were obtained for the enantiomers of most of the nonionic and weak base analytes.

The results indicated that the butyl substitution of 6 -hydroxyl and the methyl substitution of 2 - and 3 -hydroxyl were the most promising for the enantiomeric separation. Using Capillary Electrophoresis (CE), the trimers and monomers of PM-β-CDs were compared for enantiomeric resolution, as well as comparing the cationic PMMA-β-CD with the anionic HS-β-CD. In these studies the trimer did not show an improved resolution for mepivacaine, when compared to the equimolar concentration of the monomer. The cationic CD gave increased resolution values for ibuprofen when compared to the anionic CD. A scheme for reversing enantiomeric elution order of both the basic propranolol and acidic ibuprofen is also presented, with the aim of facilitating the detection of impurities in a high sample loading. The detection of 1 % of each enantiomer of propranolol, and 1 % of R(-) -ibuprofen, was demonstrated, with elution prior to the tailing peak of the corresponding enantiomer.

40|$|As the {{production}} of new chiral products such as drugs continually increases, the currently available CSPs are not guarantees to provide adequate enantioseparation for new products. With the increased demand from drug regulatory agencies for drug manufacturers to provide safety data by way of enantiomeric purity, {{there is a need}} for the development of more chiral selectors for application in gas chromatography (GC) or liquid chromatography (LC) stationary phases for the analysis of chiral drug products. Given that GC is one of the preferred methods of chiral analysis recommended by drug regulatory agencies, it is important to have a range of GC stationary phases which possess diverse physical and chemical properties to allow researchers to conduct not only routine chiral analysis but provide a selection of stationary phases with the appropriate properties required to conduct specialised enantioselective analysis experiments. Ionic liquids have been identified as good candidates for application as stationary phases in GC. Their negligible vapour pressure, good thermal stability, multiple solvation interaction and their tuneable physical and chemical properties make them ideal candidates for application in the design of new stationary phases. In this work the design, synthesis, and testing of novel chiral ionic liquids (ILs), for enantioselective capability in GC stationary phases is presented. First, new chiral cis- and trans- 2, 4, 5 -triphenylimidazolinium ILs are synthesised as well as their achiral 2, 4, 5 -triphenylimidazolium IL counter parts. Following which the asymmetrical N-derivatisation of trans- 2, 4, 5 -triphenylimidazoline with various amino acids is described, which upon alkylation with an alkylhalide served as precursors for the synthesis of novel chiral ILs. We also describe the synthesis of new asymmetrical chiral imidazolinium ILs with various side groups from simple amino acids, permitting the incorporation of various functional groups at positions 2, 3, 4, and 5 on the imidazoline moiety, allowing for {{the production}} of a wide range of imidazolinium ILs with tunable physical and chemical properties.

A selection of chiral ILs incorporated into capillary columns as chiral selectors diluted in OV- 1701, and their phase polarities and their enantioselective capabilities evaluated.

40|$|Generally, in {{chemical}} synthesis of chiral systems a racemic mixture is produced, {{that is a}} 50 : 50 mixture of both <b>enantiomers.</b> The <b>resolution</b> of racemic mixtures are difficult, because the chemical and physical properties of the enantiomers are identical except for the interaction with linear polarized light and other chiral substances. An effective and comparatively cheap technology for enantioseparation is preferential crystallisation (or resolution by entrainment) [1]. Unfortunately, its application is limited up-to-now to conglomerate forming systems, which cover only 5 to 10 % of the chiral substances [2]. However, the major part of chiral systems belong to compound forming systems. The aim of this work is to demonstrate {{the applicability of the}} preferential crystallisation principle to compound forming systems for example mandelic acid. The motivation of this work is base {{on the fact that the}} ternary solubility diagram of a compound forming system exhibits two three-phase regions, where it should be possible to perform preferential crystallisation. Analogous to the conglomerate applications, the start solution should have an enantiomeric composition similar to the eutectic composition in the chiral system. As products alternatively the desired enantiomer or the racemate will be obtained. In Figure 1 the application of preferential crystallisation in cyclic operation mode is shown for a racemic compound forming systems. Such a preferential crystallization step could be integrated in a hybrid process, where at first an established separation technique is applied to reach a certain enantiomeric enrichment and subsequently preferential crystallisation is used to produce finally the desired pure enantiomer and the racemate as by-product. The racemate could be recycled to the enrichment step again. In the presentation the applicability of preferential crystallisation for separation of mandelic acid enantiomers will be demonstrated. Online monitoring of this separation process is performed with help of a combination of polarimetry and density measurement. The experiments were planned ton the basis of available ternary solubility and metastable zone width data. The feasibility of preferential crystallisation and the influence of different experimental conditions like initial supersaturation, initial enantiomeric composition, seed amount and scale will be shown. Further, experimental results of several cycles producing alternatively the pure enantiomer and the racemic compound are presented. Crystallisation trajectories, the product purity, the product mass gained and the productivity will be discussed. In order to derive general conclusions, the separation of further chiral substances will be studied in future work. [1] J. Jacques, A. Collet, S. H.

40|$|Chirality {{is not a}} rare {{phenomenon}} in metabolomes. Nevertheless, common metabolomics approaches still detect enantiomers as a single signal. However, they are individual metabolites due to different stereospecific enzymes catalyzing their metabolism. The here presented methods consider the configuration of chiral metabolites {{in the interpretation of}} metabolomics data to investigate the following biomedical hypotheses. D-Amino acids (D-AAs), albeit much lower abundant than their antipodes, are potential diagnostic markers for diseases affecting the liver, the gut and the gut flora. The other assumption of this thesis was that the comprehensive resolution of stereoisomers from metabolomes, providing more detailed metabolic fingerprints than conventional approaches, would facilitate the differentiation of groups. In order to investigate the former hypothesis two different GC-MS techniques were used for the implementation, optimization and validation of quantitative AAE analysis, primarily in urine and serum. The GC-qMS method using MeOH/Methylchloroformate (MCF) derivatization and a gamma-CD derivative for enantiomer separation was chosen, among several tested derivative/chiral selector combinations, in my diploma thesis as the most effective GC-qMS method for quantitative amino acid enantiomer (AAE) analysis with respect to the number of baseline separated proteinogenic AAE pairs and peak intensities. Sample preparation was optimized to allow the accurate quantification of exclusively free AAEs. In addition injection parameter and IS contents were optimized to decrease LLOQs and the method was validated by comparison to a non-chiral GC-qMS method for AA quantification. Finally, the method was subjected to biomedical applications that underlined the potential of D-AAs as diagnostic markers due to changed D-AA levels found in mouse serum and mouse liver tissues as a consequence of pathological changes of the liver. The method separated ten pairs of AAEs, but it failed to separate Phe enantiomers, D-Ile/L-Leu, L-Thr/L-Asp, and L-Ser/D-Met. For L-Thr, L-Asp and D-Met a specific m/z enabled their accurate quantification in SIM mode but the quantification of the other coeluting enantiomers was impeded. Moreover, not each D-AA that was baseline separated from its antipode could be quantified in all samples of interest due to insufficient LLOQs. Thus, the potential of comprehensive GC×GC-TOFMS was tested for quantitative AAE analysis in urine and serum. The same derivative/chiral selector combination was used and a ZB-AAA column provided best AAE resolution as the second dimension selector from two different selectors tested. Upon optimization of the temperature program, baseline separation was accomplished for all detected AAEs except for Phe enantiomers. The method was validated by comparison to the chiral GC-qMS method and pros and cons of both approaches were discussed. The application of chiral GC×GC-TOFMS revealed increased D-AA serum levels in patients with liver cirrhosis when compared to respective serum levels of healthy individuals. Finally, performing a chiral fingerprinting approach, it was demonstrated that comprehensive <b>enantiomer</b> <b>resolution</b> assisted with the differentiation of different NAFLD stages in the analysis of urine samples from respective mouse models. There was observed a clear group separation of the three investigated groups after PCA of differentiating features and D-Val, D- 2 -Hydroxyglutaric acid and D-allo-Ile levels significantly differentiated NASH from hepatic steatosis. There were identified further enantiomers of hydroxydiacids and AA derivatives that significantly differentiated the diseased groups from controls and besides D-Val six other separated AAEs differentiated the experimental groups. This chiral GC-qMS based fingerprinting approach introduced a new field of investigation that I named ‘chiralomics’ as it expanded metabolomics to the chiral dimension...|$|E
40|$|Die vorliegende Dissertation befasst sich mit der systematischen Aufklärung von zwischenmolekularen Wirt-Gast-Wechselwirkungen von Arzneistoffen mit Cyclodextrinen. In einem sich trichterförmig verengenden Erkenntnisprozeß wird im ersten Schritt eine breite Datenbasis von Kapillarelektrophorese-Daten von 86 chiralen Arzneistoffen mit 3 nativen CDs (alpha, beta und gamma) sowie 11 CD-Derivaten gewonnen. Sowohl die Trennfaktoren der Enantiomeren (alpha_m) als auch die Retardierungsfaktoren (R_m) zeigen eine charakteristische Abhängigkeit von der molekularen Struktur der Arzneistoffe. Statistische Auswertungen werden durch künstliche Neuronale Netze, insbesondere Selbstorganisierende Karten vom Kohonen-Typ, ergänzt. Sechs besonders aussagefähige Arzneistoffe werden in Gegenwart von nativem alpha-, beta- oder gamma-CD physikalischen Messungen unterworfen. Die Kernresonanzspektroskopie liefert Komplexstöchiometrien und ortsaufgelöste Bindungskonstanten K. Die Mikrokalorimetrie liefert exaktere K-Werte, sowie die thermodynamischen Daten -Delta_H_ 0, T_Delta_S_ 0 und -Delta_G_ 0. Mit alpha-CD dominiert die Bindungsenthalpie -Delta_H_ 0, mit gamma-CD die (positive) Bindungsentropie T_Delta_S_ 0, und mit beta-CD liegen die Daten dazwischen. Der Mechanismus mit gamma-CD ist mit biomolekularen Vorgängen an Enzymen und Rezeptoren vergleichbar. Im System [Oxomemazine + Cyclodextrin (alpha, beta bzw. gamma) + 138 Wassermoleküle] bestätigen MD-Simulationen die zuvor aufgestellten mechanistischen Hypothesen. Dabei werden je nach Ringgröße des CD unterschiedliche Bindungsgeometrien beobachtet. Diese Vielzahl an experimentellen Befunden kann nur mit molekülgraphischen Datenbanken verwaltet werden. Die sehr umfangreiche Studie des Wirt-Gast-Systems in wäßrigem Puffer wird ergänzt durch gaschromatographische Enantiomerentrennungen von 15 Arzneistoffen an einer aprotischen polysiloxangebundenen Cyclodextrinphase. Außerdem wird die Synthese eines trägergebundenen Reagens auf der Basis des "Noe-Lactols" beschrieben, das als "chiraler Schwamm" fungieren kann. The thesis {{deals with}} a {{systematic}} investigation of intermolecular host-guest-interactions between drugs and cyclodextrins. In a concise process of narrowing down a flood of data into the essential information, we started with a myriad of data on the capillary electrophoresis of 86 different chiral drugs {{in the presence of}} either one of three native CDs (alpha, beta and gamma, respectively) and 11 derivatives thereof. Both the separation factors of the enantiomers (alpha_m) and the retardation factors (R_m) showed characteristic patterns related to the molecular structure of the drug molecules. Statistical analyses were supplemented by Artificial Neural Networks, in particular, Self-Organizing Maps of the Kohonen type. Six drugs of particular interest were selected, and investigated further in the presence of native alpha-, beta- and gamma-CD, respectively. Nuclearmagnetic Resonance Spectroscopy delivered complex stoichiometry and proton-related binding constants K. Microcalorimetry furnished more precise K-values, and also thermodynamic parameters of interaction, such as -Delta_H_ 0, T_Delta_S_ 0 and -Delta_G_ 0. In the presence of alpha-CD, the interaction is dominated by the enthalpy term, whereas with gamma-CD the entropy term becomes the driving force; with beta-CD, the situation lies in between of the aforementioned. The mechanism with gamma-CD compares to biomolecular interactions encountered in enzymes and receptors, respectively. The system [Oxomemazine + cyclodextrin (alpha, beta and gamma, respectively) + 138 H 2 O molecules] was investigated by Molecular Dynamics Simulations, hereby confirming all preliminary hypotheses. For each ring size of cyclodextrin, a different model of interaction was observed. All experimental data were stored and processed by molecular graphics databases. This detailed and profound study of the given host-guest-system in aqueous buffer was complemented by the <b>enantiomer</b> <b>resolution</b> by gas chromatography of 15 chiral drugs on an aprotic polysiloxane-bound cyclodextrin phase. Moreover, the synthesis of a solid phase chiral agent on basis of "Noe-Lactol", functioning as a "chiral sponge", was described...|$|E
40|$|The {{relationship}} between the structure and chromatographic properties of silica is discussed and the preparation and properties of chemically-bonded stationary phases based on silica are reviewed. A detailed account is given {{of the history of}} the development of carbohydrate-based stationary phases, including microcrystalline cellulose, other polysaccharides and monosaccharides and their ester and carbamate derivatives, with emphasis on their utility for the chromatographic resolution of enantiomers. Mechanisms of chiral discrimination by these and other types of chiral HPLC phases are discussed in terms of the interactions between functionalitles in the stationary phase and solute enantiomers. An overview is given of literature methods for the preparation of oligosaccharide derivatives with suitable reactive groups, such as an isothlocyänate function, for linkage to the surface of aminopropylated silica. In the experimental part, the thesis describes work carried out to study the effects of stationary phase support properties on the chromatographic behaviour and <b>enantiomer</b> <b>resolution</b> capability of carbohydrate carbamate phases. These phases were prepared by the exhaustive reaction of free hydroxyl groups in carbohydrates, such as cellulose and amylose, with aryl isocyanates, such as phenyl isocyanate and 3, 5 -dimethylphenyl isocyanate. The resulting carbamates were characterised by 1 H nmr and microanalysis and were coated onto aminopropyl silica supports by evaporation from organic solvents. It was shown that the retention of solutes by these phases correlated directly with the w/w phase loading, whilst both the separation factor and resolution for various enantiomers displayed a more complex relationship. The influence of changing pore diameter of the aminopropylated silica, with concomitant changes in pore volume and surface area, were evaluated for a series of materials at constant w/w phase loading. Whilst it is currently common practice to use very wide pore (up to 4000 Angstrom) silicas as supports for carbohydrate carbamate phases, it was concluded from the present work that there is little or no justification for using such supports and that good chromatographic performance and effective chiral discrimination can be achieved on much smaller pore (e. g. 500 Angstrom), higher surface area materials. Carbamate derivatives of cellulose were prepared a using phenyl, 3, 5 -dimethylphenyl and 1 -naphthyl isocyanates and of amylose using the first two of these reagents and were shown to have close to the theoretical maximum levels of substitution. Their chiral discriminating abilities were investigated using a test panel of five racemic analytes: trans-stilbene oxide, 2, 2, 2 -trifluoro-l-(9 '- anthryl) -ethanol, 1 -phenylethanol, benzoin and trogers base. The naphthyl carbamate phase showed no resolving ability for any of these racemates and this appeared to correlate with the presence of N-H bands in the it spectrum which were indicative of severe disruption of the organised, H-bonded 3 -dimensional structure necessary for chiral discrimination. The other four carbamate phases all showed resolving ability, each with its own specific pattern of solute selectivity. The difference in behaviour of the corresponding, identically subsituted cellulose and amylose phases, differing only in the configeration of the C-O linkage at the anomeric carbon on each glucose ring, illustrates the importance of long-range stereochemical properties: chiral discrimination must result not only from local interactions with individual carbamate groups and the adjacent chiral centres on the glucose rings, but also from the influence of the organisation of the polymer chains at the macromolecular level, leading to the creation of "chiral ravines" which display an intrinsic shape selectivity. A series of malto-oligosaccharides with from 2 to ' 9 glucose units was obtained, the higher members of the series being separated from a commercially available oligosaccharide mixture by preparative HPLC on an aminopropyl silica column. Each oligosaccharide, and also the phenyl carbamate and 3, 5 - dimethylphenyl carbamate derivatives prepared from glucose, maltose and maltotriose, were characterised by FAB-MS and LSIMS and the fragmentation patterns of the carbamates were analysed In detail and shown to provide considerable structural information. The glucose penta(phenylcarbamate) was converted Into the 1 -isothiocyanato-tetra(phenylcarbamate) by successive reactions with HBr and a thiocyanate salt. After spectroscopic characterisation to confirm its structure, it was reacted with aminopropyl silica and the conditions for achieving optimum surface coverage established. Use of a longer spacer chain was also investigated, but did not appear to offer advantages over aminopropyl silica. A model reaction with n-propylamine gave the expected N-n-propyl urea. The silica-bonded glucosyl carbamate phase was examined chromatographically using a test panel of racemic solutes and was found to give some resolution of certain racemates, but only when very low concentrations of polar modifier (isopropanol) were present in the hexane mobile phase. Some work was carried out to try to extend the above chemistry to enable carbamate derivatives of the malto-oligosaccharides to be linked to silica through the anomeric position of the first glucose ring. A satisfactory procedure has not yet been established, major experimental difficulties encountered being solubility problems with the higher homologues and a lack of reproducibility in the introduction of the anomeric bromine and its displacement by isothiocyanate. Once these problems have been overcome, the methodology developed should provide a novel series of immobilised oligosaccharide carbamates with potential utility for the resolution of enantiomers...|$|E

On-line UV detection was simultaneously used. Method optimization was performed by studying the effect of cyclodextrin and BGE concentration as well as sheath liquid composition on analyte migration time and enantiomeric resolution. The cyclodextrin showed stereoselective complexation towards baclofen <b>enantiomers,</b> allowing chiral <b>resolution</b> at low concentration. The CE capillary protrusion from the ESI needle relevantly affected the chiral resolution and the analyte migration time.

40|$|The {{resolution}} of chiral compounds {{has been of}} enormous interest to pharmaceutical, agricultural and food industries. The need for efficient techniques {{for the production of}} enantiomerically pure compounds is increasing due to the recent high demand for single <b>enantiomers</b> [1]. <b>Resolution</b> of racemates can be realized by using various methods such as kinetic resolution (chemical catalysis and biocatalysis), diastereomeric salts formation, (preparative) chromatography, preferential crystallization, and enantioselective membranes (molecularly imprinted polymeric membranes). In this work, a new approach for chiral separation based on enantioselective crystallization using chiral solvents will be presented. In principle, it is expected that a chiral solvent can create some selective interactions which will enable differentiation between the two single enantiomers. This differentiation can be used for the {{resolution of}} racemates. The chiral solvents are classified into two main groups that are a) classical chiral solvents and b) non-classical chiral solvent (ionic liquids and liquid crystals). In literature a few work do exist in the field of classical chiral solvents [2], but none for using chiral ionic liquids for enantioselective crystallization. However, recently Reichert and co-workers reviewed the general possibilities and the potential of ionic liquids as solvents in crystallization processes [3]. The work to be presented is concerned with studying the potential of both classical chiral solvents and chiral ionic liquids in enantioselective crystallization on the example of two selected pharmaceutical model systems. The effect of the used chiral solvent on thermodynamics and crystallization kinetics will be shown. The results obtained for each of the systems will be discussed and comparatively evaluated...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The photodeconjugation of {{conjugated}} esters and lactones in {{the presence}} of small amounts of chiral catalysts is enantioselective. The enantio-meric excess is very sensitive to the conditions of the reaction. When chiral amino alcohols are used as chiral catalysts a synergism is observed between the effect of the amino and hydroxyl groups on the optical purity of the deconjugated molecules. The chiral discrimination between the two diastereoiso-meric transitions states leading to the R and S configuration of the product is caracterized by its t LH # and t A model which explains the results is proposed and some examples of generalisation of these studies are described. Optically active molecules are very important in nature and the preparation of pure <b>enantiomers</b> either by <b>resolution</b> of racemates or more recently by asymmetric synthesis has become a challenge of high practical importance for the organic chemist. New very efficient methodologies such as the Sharpless oxidation allowing the synthesis of almost pure enantiomers have been proposed by organic chemists.
