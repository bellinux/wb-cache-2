40|$|IntroductionPromoting {{oral hygiene}} and {{stimulating}} patient's responsibility for his/her personal health remain challenging objectives. The presence of dental <b>hygienists</b> {{has led to}} delegation of preventive tasks. However, in some countries, such as Belgium, this profession is not yet legalized. The aim of this exploratory study was to compare the attitude towards oral-hygiene instructions and patient motivational actions by dental <b>hygienists</b> and by general practitioners/periodontists in a context without dental <b>hygienists.</b> Materials and MethodsA questionnaire on demographics (six items), oral-hygiene instructions (eight items) and patient motivational actions (six items) was distributed to 241 Dutch dental <b>hygienists,</b> 692 general practitioners and 32 periodontists in Flanders/Belgium. Statistical analysis included Fisher's exact-test, Pearson's chi-square test and multiple (multinomial) logistic regression analysis to observe the influence of profession, age, workload, practice area and chair-assistance. ResultsSignificant variance was found between general practitioners and dental <b>hygienists</b> (in 13 of 14 items), between general practitioners and periodontists (in nine of 14 items) and between dental <b>hygienists</b> and periodontists (in five of 14 items). In addition to qualification, chair-assistance was also identified as affecting the attitude towards preventive oral care. ConclusionThe present study identified divergence in the application of, and experienced barriers and opinions about, oral-hygiene instructions and patient motivational actions between dental <b>hygienists</b> and general practitioners/periodontists in a context without dental <b>hygienists.</b> In response to the barriers reported {{it is suggested that}} preventive oriented care may benefit from the deployment of dental <b>hygienists</b> to increase access to qualified preventive oral care...|$|R

40|$|The {{number of}} active dentists in Sweden will fall {{sharply in the}} next decade and will {{partially}} be countered by an increased number of dental <b>hygienists.</b> The acceptance of this transition to primary oral health care by <b>hygienists</b> will be dependent on many factors; among them will be the perceived service quality offered by the dental <b>hygienists,</b> which may depend on how their professional status is perceived. Aim To find out whether the professional status of Swedish dental <b>hygienists</b> is such {{that it is possible to}} meet the demands from the population. Methods The professional status of Swedish dentists and dental <b>hygienists</b> was analysed by the variables suggested by Greenwood (1957). [Greenwood E. Social Work. 1957 2 : 45 - 55. ] Results The variables used point to shortcomings in the professional status of Swedish dental <b>hygienists.</b> Dentists in Sweden constitute a strong profession, while dental <b>hygienists</b> are emerging as a profession. They lack a coherent and systematic theory in their academic education. Their fields of expertise are not exclusive to their group and that further weakens their professional status. They will probably not meet the service quality that is presently expected by the population. Many factors will have to be combined to make possible the necessary transition from dentists to dental <b>hygienists</b> as primary providers of oral health care. One of them is that the expected level of service must be adjusted to the available personnel. Conclusions The professional status of the dental <b>hygienists</b> needs to be consolidated and strengthened by a more homogenous curriculum.

5|$|Discoloration {{of teeth}} {{may result from}} {{bacteria}} stains, tobacco, tea, coffee, foods {{with an abundance of}} chlorophyll, restorative materials, and medications. Stains from bacteria may cause colors varying from green to black to orange. Green stains also result from foods with chlorophyll or excessive exposure to copper or nickel. Amalgam, a common dental restorative material, may turn adjacent areas of teeth black or gray. Long term use of chlorhexidine, a mouthwash, may encourage extrinsic stain formation near the gingiva on teeth. This is usually easy for a <b>hygienist</b> to remove. Systemic disorders also can cause tooth discoloration. Congenital erythropoietic porphyria causes porphyrins to be deposited in teeth, causing a red-brown coloration. Blue discoloration may occur with alkaptonuria and rarely with Parkinson's disease. Erythroblastosis fetalis and biliary atresia are diseases which may cause teeth to appear green from the deposition of biliverdin. Also, trauma may change a tooth to a pink, yellow, or dark gray color. Pink and red discolorations are also associated in patients with lepromatous leprosy. Some medications, such as tetracycline antibiotics, may become incorporated into the structure of a tooth, causing intrinsic staining of the teeth.|$|E
5|$|The Nazi {{reproductive}} {{policies were}} {{a significant factor}} behind their anti-tobacco campaign.

Werner Huttig of the Nazi Party's Rassenpolitisches Amt (Office of Racial Politics) said that a smoking mother's breast milk contained nicotine, a claim that modern research has proven correct. , a prominent physician during the Third Reich, opined that smoking by pregnant women resulted in a higher rate of stillbirths and miscarriages. This opinion was also supported by well-known female racial <b>hygienist</b> Agnes Bluhm, whose book published in 1936 expressed the same view. The Nazi leadership was concerned over this because they wanted German women to be as reproductive as possible. An article published in a German gynecology journal in 1943 stated that women smoking three or more cigarettes per day were more likely to remain childless compared to nonsmoking women.|$|E

40|$|Aims: Attitudes of dentists {{and dental}} <b>hygienists</b> towards {{extended}} scope and independent dental hygiene practice {{are described in}} several studies, but the results are heterogenous. The purpose of this systematic review was to compare the attitudes of dentists and dental <b>hygienists</b> towards extended scope and independent dental hygiene practice. Methods: PubMed, AMED and CINAHL were screened by two independent assessors to identify relevant studies. Only quantitative studies that reported the percentages of dentists' and dental hygienists' attitude towards extended scope and independent dental hygiene practice were included. The random-effects model was used to synthesise possible heterogenous influences. Results: Meta proportions with regard to a positive attitude towards extended scope of practice are 0. 54 for dentists and 0. 81 for dental <b>hygienists.</b> Meta proportions of a positive attitude towards independent practice are 0. 14 for dentists and 0. 59 for dental <b>hygienists.</b> A meta analysis with regard to negative attitudes could only be performed on extended scope of practice and did not reveal {{a difference between the}} two professions. We obtained homogeneous outcomes of the studies included regarding negative attitudes of dentists. A minority of dentists hold negative attitudes towards extended scope of dental hygiene practice. Study outcomes regarding negative attitudes of dental <b>hygienists</b> were heterogeneous.

40|$|Background: Recent {{literature}} has identified that musculoskeletal disorders (MSD) {{are a significant}} occupational health issue for both dentists and dental <b>hygienists.</b> Research on the occupational health of dental <b>hygienists</b> is lacking in Australia, which is of particular concern given {{that it is a}} rapidly growing field in this country. The aims of this research are to investigate the prevalence of MSD and correlating regions of pain among Australian dental <b>hygienists.</b> A self-reporting questionnaire was distributed to all registered dental <b>hygienists</b> in Australia. The questionnaire was a modified version of a validated tool, used previously among health practitioners and students. Results: A total of 624 dental <b>hygienists</b> responded to the questionnaire, achieving a response rate of 42 %. MSD were frequently reported by dental <b>hygienists</b> in the neck (85 %), shoulder (70 %), and lower back (68 %). Of those reporting pain, over two thirds reported that the pain lasted for longer than two days, for all body regions. Logistic regression analysis revealed that there is a correlation between reports of MSD in the neck, shoulder and lower back regions. Conclusions: Overall, this study suggests that MSD are a reasonably common problem for Australian dental <b>hygienists,</b> and that they often need to seek medical treatment for these problems. It is concerning that there is a correlation between reports of MSD in the neck, shoulder and lower back regions; further studies are needed to establish the epidemiological patterns of MSD in this profession...|$|R

Nicotine & Tobacco Research, 14, 1040 - 1047. ] is available online at: [URL] <b>hygienists</b> are well placed to assist their patients to quit smoking. Smoking affects oral health and dental treatments, and <b>hygienists</b> report greater time with patients than dentists with more focus on prevention. However, there has been little research into the extent to which <b>hygienists</b> assist patients to quit smoking, and strategies to support them in this role. Methods. A two stage survey of Australian dental <b>hygienists</b> was conducted. The first survey measured potential predictors of asking patients about smoking and assisting patients to quit smoking using the Theory of Planned Behaviour as a framework. The second survey measured these behaviours in the past week. Structural equation modelling was used to examine predictors of the two behaviours. Results. A total of 362 <b>hygienists</b> returned the first questionnaire. Intentions to ask and assist patients were high. The 273 <b>hygienists</b> who returned the second questionnaire assisted an estimated total of 1, 394 patients to quit smoking in one week. Predictors within the Theory of Planned Behaviour framework explained significant variance in asking (11 %) and assisting (29 %) behaviours, with self-efficacy the most critical predictor in both cases (β =. 27,. 32 respectively). Conclusions. Dental <b>hygienists</b> may be a viable and willing avenue for addressing smoking. <b>Hygienists</b> may be best supported in this role through increasing skills and confidence around asking sensitively about smoking, building rapport, and assisting patients to quit smoking.. Incorporation of smoking status into general history taking and adoption of organisational policies on assisting patients to quit smoking could also be encouraged...|$|R
