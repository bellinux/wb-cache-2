5|$|Stars {{are created}} within galaxies from a reserve of cold gas that forms into giant {{molecular}} clouds. Some galaxies {{have been observed}} to form stars at an <b>exceptional</b> <b>rate,</b> which {{is known as a}} starburst. If they continue to do so, then they would consume their reserve of gas in a time span less than the lifespan of the galaxy. Hence starburst activity usually lasts for only about ten million years, a relatively brief period in the history of a galaxy. Starburst galaxies were more common during the early history of the Universe, and, at present, still contribute an estimated 15% to the total star production rate.|$|E

One triplane was used as a testbed for an experimental Schwade gear-driven supercharger.|$|E
2500|$|The Lightning {{is powered}} by two Rolls-Royce Avon {{turbojet}} engines in a unique staggered stacked installation in the fuselage. The Lightning was initially designed and developed as an interceptor to defend the V bomber airfields [...] from attack by anticipated future nuclear-armed supersonic Soviet bombers such as what emerged as the Tupolev Tu-22, but it was subsequently also required to intercept other bomber aircraft such as the Tupolev Tu-16, Tupolev Tu-95, and thus the Lightning has <b>exceptional</b> <b>rate</b> of climb, ceiling, and speed; pilots have described flying it as [...] "being saddled to a skyrocket".

40|$|It is {{generally}} {{assumed that the}} Quaternary {{was a period of}} heightened diversification in temperate vertebrate organisms. Previous molecular systematics studies have challenged this assertion. We re-examined this issue in north temperate birds using log-lineage plots and distributions of sister-taxon distances. Log-lineage plots support earlier conclusions that avian diversification slowed during the Quaternary. To test plots of empirical sister-taxon distances we simulated three sets of phylogenies: constant speciation and extinction, a pulse of recent speciation, and a pulse of recent extinction. Previous opinions favour the model of recent speciation although our empirical dataset on 74 avian comparisons failed to reject a distribution derived from the constant and extinction models. Hence, it does not appear that the Quaternary was a period of <b>exceptional</b> <b>rates</b> of diversification, relative to the background rate...|$|R
40|$|The {{process of}} {{urbanisation}} {{has historically been}} associated with both socioeconomic development and social strain.

In order to improve urban security in the years ahead, the underlying risk factors must be addressed, including urban poverty, inequality, and fragile political institutions.

5000|$|The first EF4 tornado of 2017 {{began at}} 01:51 UTC on March 1 (7:51 p.m. CST on February 28) {{to the west}} of Perryville in Perry County, Missouri, where it snapped the trunks of several {{hardwood}} trees and caused EF1 damage to homes. An outbuilding was destroyed at EF2 intensity near the intersection of Country Road 810 and North Highway. The tornado then continued to the northeast and intensified at an <b>exceptional</b> <b>rate,</b> causing EF4 damage as it impacted a small subdivision of large homes {{on the west side of}} Interstate 55. Multiple two-story homes along Kyle Lane were completely leveled. One person was killed in their vehicle as the tornado crossed Interstate 55, and least a dozen cars were mangled and destroyed after being thrown 200 - 300 yd from a nearby salvage yard. The tornado then moved across a series of open pastures before crossing U.S. Route 61 and impacting the northwestern outskirts of Perryville at EF4 intensity. A residential subdivision along Moore Drive in this area sustained devastating damage, with many homes completely leveled, a few of which were swept clean from their foundations. Numerous trees in this area were snapped and denuded, and several vehicles were flipped and tossed. One home in this area was anchor-bolted to its foundation with its wall studs toe-nailed at both the top and bottom, and was completely swept away with only the basement left behind. Despite the high-quality construction, the overall context surrounding this home was not indicative of an intensity greater than mid-range EF4, and maximum winds along this segment of the path were estimated to have peaked at 180 mph (290 km/h).|$|E
