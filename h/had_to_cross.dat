5|$|By 1846, {{the station}} was already very busy, {{handling}} trains from Wigan and the south, Bolton, Fleetwood, Blackpool, Lancaster and the north, and Blackburn. There were no footbridges; passengers <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> the lines escorted by station staff. North of {{the station was}} a network of goods lines {{around the end of}} the Lancaster Canal. The coal yards and sidings here continued to operate long after the canal had fallen into commercial disuse.|$|E
5|$|Overhill Cherokee was {{the term}} for the Cherokee people located in their {{historic}} settlements {{in what is now}} the U.S. state of Tennessee in the Southeastern United States, {{on the west side of}} the Appalachian Mountains. This name was used by 18th-century European traders and explorers from British colonies along the Atlantic coast, as they <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> the mountains to reach these settlements.|$|E

5|$|The {{opening in}} 1885 of the Saint-Louis–Dakar railway {{increased}} the traffic over the bridge. The railway reached {{all the way}} to Sor and all the goods hauled between the coast and the railway station <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> over the bridge. To prevent the breakdown of the bridge a special decree was given so that the maximum weight for a vehicle that crosses the bridge to be less than one and a half tonnes. With all its difficulties the bridge remained in service 32 years, until 1897 when it was dismantled.|$|E
5|$|At 1200, Mott {{was brought}} to the {{position}} of L Company commander Captain George F. Sharra. Mott ordered Sharra to take command and organize a retreat. Sharra ordered his three platoons to withdraw. A battalion of North Korean soldiers began moving down the pass towards the American positions. Men of I Company were forced to withdraw through rice paddies south of the pass, being strafed by mortar and machine gun fire in the process. They also <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> a -wide stream in the retreat, and some drowned in the process. Most of the Americans were forced to discard weapons, equipment and clothing in the retreat. Many of the men of L Company, {{as well as some of}} the wounded, were able to evacuate by truck.|$|E
5|$|During the {{training}} expedition, Shaw's group came to Walla Brook at a crossing near Watern Tor in the north-east of Dartmoor. According to evidence given at Shaw's inquest in 2009, the group believed they <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> because the alternative route would add {{at least four}} miles to the trek. Another {{member of the group}} got into difficulties crossing the stream, which, due to heavy rain, had swollen to approximately five times its normal size. The other group member removed her rucksack and passed it to Shaw. As Shaw, the last member of the group on her side of the stream, was throwing the rucksack across, she slipped and fell into the water.|$|E

5|$|The Crusaders {{defeated}} the Sharks 36-8 in the qualifier round. For the semi-final the Crusaders <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> the Indian Ocean to Cape Town {{to play the}} Stormers. Despite travelling 11,000km the Crusaders {{defeated the}} Stormers 29-10 in a convincing display. The Crusaders faced the Reds in the Final and yet more travel. The Crusaders and Reds were matched evenly at 13-13 after exchanging a try apiece and two penalty's. However, Will Genia scored a crucial try for the Reds in the 68th minute to help them to an 18–13 win. The Crusaders lost the final to the Queensland Reds at the Suncorp Stadium. Despite not winning the title in 2011, the trials the Crusaders overcame to even make the final, made this season one of the Crusaders finest.|$|E
5|$|The {{campaign}} {{was preceded by}} an amphibious landing by troops from the Australian 9th Division east of Lae on 4 September 1943. This was followed by an advance west along the coast towards the town where they were to link up with 7th Division advancing from Nadzab. Meanwhile, Australian and US forces mounted diversionary attacks around Salamaua. Heavy rain and flooding slowed the 9th Division's advance, which <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> several rivers along the way. The Japanese rear guard also put up a stiff defence and, as a result, Lae did not fall until 16 September, when troops from the 7th Division entered it ahead of the 9th, and {{the main body of}} the Japanese force escaped north. Less than a week later, the Huon Peninsula {{campaign was}} opened as the Australians undertook another amphibious landing further east, aimed at capturing Finschhafen.|$|E
5|$|A {{recovered}} propeller {{showed that}} the engine had been running at near-cruising speed {{at the time of}} the impact. Additionally, the condition of the wheels proved that the undercarriage was still retracted, suggesting controlled flight into terrain rather than an attempted emergency landing. During the final portion of Star Dust flight, heavy clouds would have blocked visibility of the ground. It has therefore been suggested that, in the absence of visual sightings of the ground due to the clouds, a large navigational error could have been made as the aircraft flew through the jet stream—a phenomenon not well understood in 1947, in which high-altitude winds can blow at high speed in directions different from those of winds observed at ground level. If the airliner, which <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> the Andes mountain range at , had entered the jet-stream zone—which in this area normally blows from the west and south-west, resulting in the aircraft encountering a headwind—this would have significantly decreased the aircraft's ground speed.|$|E

To prevent them from being killed, volunteers may place low fences along roads which the animals <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>cross.</b> On short distances, dry pitfall traps are then placed along the fences to collect the animals, which subsequently are manually transferred {{to the other side}} of the road, thus preventing massive roadkill.|$|R
5|$|At Devil's Gate {{the rescue}} party {{unloaded}} the baggage {{carried in the}} wagons of the Hodgett and Hunt wagon companies that had been following the Martin Company so the wagons {{could be used to}} transport the weakest emigrants. A small group led by Daniel Webster Jones remained at Devil's Gate over the winter to protect the property. On November 4 the company <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> the Sweetwater River, which was about 2 feet (0.6 m) deep and 90 to 120 feet (27 to 37 m) wide. The stream was clogged with floating ice. Some of the men of the rescue party spent hours pulling the carts and carrying many of the emigrants across the river. However, many members of the company crossed the river themselves, some even pulling their own handcarts across. The severe weather forced the Martin Company to halt for another five days at Martin's Cove, a few miles west of Devil's Gate.|$|E
5|$|Faced {{with these}} constraints, the Spanish {{expedition}} <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> the river {{several times and}} fight at each ford against stiff opposition. The bulk of the Inca army confronted the Spaniards from a set of terraces overlooking a plain by the Urubamba River. Several Spanish assaults against the terraces failed against a shower of arrows, slingshots and boulders {{coming down from the}} terraces as well as from both flanks. To hinder the efforts of the Spanish cavalry the Incas flooded the plain using previously prepared channels; water eventually reached the horses' girths. The defenders then counterattacked; some of them used Spanish weapons captured in previous encounters such as swords, bucklers, armor and even a horse, ridden by Manco Inca himself. In a severely compromised situation, Hernando Pizarro ordered a retreat; under the cover of darkness the Spanish force fled through the Urubamba valley with the Incas in pursuit and reached Cusco the next day.|$|E
5|$|In Stjørdal, {{controversy}} arose {{over the}} route. The river of Stjørdalselva creates a barrier {{just north of}} Hell, which made it cheaper to build the line on the south shore of the river to Hegra. However, the major population center was located at Stjørdalshalsen, {{on the north shore}} of the river. Locally, there were many protests against the line bypassing such a large town, but the cost of the bridge made Parliament choose the southern alternative. This gave residents in the town a considerably longer route to the train, since they <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> the river to get access to the railway. This decreased the railway's ability to compete with the steam ships and thus the overall profitability of the line. With the arrival of the railway, transport to Trondheim became much easier than to Stjørdalshalsen and Levanger, helping Trondheim grow as a regional center.|$|E

5|$|The {{amount of}} land in Poulton owned by St. Mary's Priory {{increased}} during the 12th and 13thcenturies and caused conflict with local landowners over whose land the tenants and monks of the priory <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>cross.</b> In 1276, Sir Adam Banastre and his supporters assaulted the prior, Ralph de Truno, as he travelled to Poulton. He and his attendants were taken by Banastre, beaten and imprisoned in Thornton. An investigation into the incident was instigated by the king; no record survives. In 1330, a compromise was made when two roads were built through Banastre's land which enabled the prior and his tenants to travel freely to Poulton. During the 13th and 14thcenturies, much of the land at Poulton was given to Cockersand Abbey in Lancaster and rented back to local farm workers. Much {{of the land in}} the Fylde was donated either to Cockersand Abbey or Whalley Abbey. To efficiently manage and farm these lands, granges were built at Singleton and Staining. When the alien priories (those under control of religious houses abroad) were dissolved in 1415, the church at Poulton was conveyed to the Abbey of Syon in Middlesex.|$|E
5|$|The tanks had {{difficulty}} {{keeping up with}} the advance. One obstacle was mines. On the first day, the 2/7th Field Company lifted fourteen mines but a tractor broke a track running over a mine. On 7 December, two more tanks were damaged by mines, one beyond repair. The sappers then cut a new track which they corduroyed. To support the attack on Lakona, the tanks <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> a creek with steep coral banks, swollen by a torrential downpour. While efforts were made to bring up a compressor, tanks fired into banks and holes were packed with explosives and detonated. On the evening of 16 December, the infantry were joined by five Matilda tanks, and overran the Japanese positions. They counted 47 Japanese dead; and killed another 17 in mopping-up operations the next day. On 20 December, aided by four Matilda tanks and 750 rounds from the 25-pounders, the 4th Infantry Brigade occupied the Fortification Point area. Between 5 and 20 December, the4th Infantry Brigade reported 65 killed and 136 wounded. Japanese casualties were 420 killed and 136 found dead, victims of disease, malnutrition and suicide. Only six Japanese prisoners were taken.|$|E
5|$|To enter Northern Greece, the German army <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> the Rhodope Mountains, {{which offered}} few river valleys or {{mountain}} passes capable of accommodating {{the movement of}} large military units. Two invasion courses were located west of Kyustendil; another was along the Yugoslav-Bulgarian border, via the Struma river valley to the south. Greek border fortifications had been adapted for the terrain and a formidable defence system covered the few available roads. The Struma and Nestos rivers cut across the mountain range along the Greek-Bulgarian frontier and both of their valleys were protected by strong fortifications, {{as part of the}} larger Metaxas Line. This system of concrete pillboxes and field fortifications, constructed along the Bulgarian border in the late 1930s, was built on principles {{similar to those of the}} Maginot Line. Its strength resided mainly in the inaccessibility of the intermediate terrain leading up to the defence positions.|$|E

5|$|Willaumez {{made no move}} to {{challenge}} Stopford or Gambier, although he had successfully united with the Rochefort squadron of three ships of the line, two frigates and an armed storeship, the captured British fourth rate ship Calcutta, commanded by Commodore Gilbert-Amable Faure. Together the French fleet, now numbering 11 ships of the line, withdrew from the relatively open Basque Roads anchorage into the narrow channel under the batteries of the Île-d'Aix known as the Aix Roads. These waters offered greater protection from the British fleet, but were also extremely hazardous; on 26 February, as the French manoeuvred into the shallower waters of their new anchorage the 74-gun Jean-Bart grounded on the Palles Shoal off Île Madame, and was wrecked. The channel in which Willaumez chose to position his fleet formed a strong defensive position: an assailant <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> the open Basque Roads and advance past the long and dangerous Boyart Shoal hidden just below the surface. On entering the channel, an attacking force would then come under fire from fortified gun batteries on Île-d'Aix before finally encountering the French fleet. The anchorage had been successfully attacked before, such as during the Raid on Rochefort in 1757, but more recent efforts in 1803, and 1807 had ended in failure.|$|E
5|$|The {{defining}} {{factor in}} the geography of Scotland is {{the distinction between the}} Highlands and Islands in the north and west and the Lowlands in the south and east. The Highlands are further divided into the Northwest Highlands and the Grampian Mountains by the fault line of the Great Glen. The Lowlands are divided into the fertile belt of the Central Lowlands and the higher terrain of the Southern Uplands, which included the Cheviot hills, over which the border with England came to run {{by the end of the}} period. Some of these regions were further divided by mountains, major rivers and marshes. The Central Lowland belt averages about 50 miles in width, and because it contains most of the good quality agricultural land and has easier communications, could support most of the urbanisation and elements of conventional Medieval government. The Southern Uplands, and particularly the Highlands were economically less productive and much more difficult to govern. This provided Scotland with a form of protection, as minor English incursions <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> the difficult Southern Uplands; two major attempts at conquest by the English, under Edward I and then Edward III, were unable to penetrate the Highlands, from where potential resistance could reconquer the Lowlands. But it also made those areas problematic to govern for Scottish kings and much of the political history of the era after the wars of independence centred on attempts to resolve problems of entrenched localism.|$|E
