25|$|As it was then, this {{election}} is still today shrouded in controversy, and there exist two popular stances <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>discussion.</b> On one hand, some people argue {{that there was a}} resolve in favor of independence, as there actually was a factual majority for secession, even if it was a small one. On the other hand, other people argue that the majority was far too small, as there were in fact only 161 more votes for independence, and this side specifically argues that only a qualified majority can be large enough grounds to pass a vote of such social and political consequence.|$|E
25|$|The Sants–La Sagrera tunnel {{links the}} Sants station in Barcelona through the Eixample {{with the future}} La Sagrera station. The tunnel passes under the streets of Provença and Mallorca, using a short part of the Diagonal to link between these streets. In the Carrer de Mallorca, the tunnel passes {{directly}} in front of Gaudí's masterpiece, the basilica of the Sagrada Família, and in the Carrer de Provença, another Gaudí work, the Casa Milà. In a long campaign against this route, the Board of the Sagrada Família and other parties argued that the tunnel would damage the church, whose construction is still in progress. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>discussion</b> about different routes, the one now built is also called the Provença tunnel because part of its route passes under this street.|$|E

25|$|There {{have also}} been {{multiple}} international groups that have issued reports addressing issues in special education. The United Nations on “International Norms and Standards relating to Disability” in 1998. This report cites multiple conventions, statements, declarations, and other reports such as: The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, The Salamanca Statement, the Sundberg Declaration, the Copenhagen Declaration and Programme of Action, and many others. One main point that the report emphasizes is the necessity for education {{to be a human}} right. The report also states that the “quality of education should be equal to that of persons without disabilities.” The other main points brought up by the report discuss integrated education, special education classes as supplementary, teacher training, and equality for vocational education. The United Nations also releases a report by the Special Rapporteur that has a focus on persons with disabilities. In 2015, a report titled “Report of the Special Rapporteur to the 52nd Session of the Commission for Social Development: Note by the Secretary-General on Monitoring of the implementation of the Standard Rules on the Equalization of Opportunities for Persons with Disabilities” was released. This report focused on looking at how the many countries involved, with a focus on Africa, have handled policy regarding persons with disabilities. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>discussion,</b> the author also focuses on the importance of education for persons with disabilities as well as policies that could help improve the education system such as a move towards a more inclusive approach. The World Health Organization has also published a report addressing people with disabilities and within this there is a discussion on education in their “World Report on Disability” in 201. Other organizations that have issued reports discussing the topic are UNESCO, UNICEF, and the World Bank.|$|E

When they complained that a fee was charged for attending his lecture at the University and that, hitherto, lectures by visiting scholars had been free-of-charge, Friedman replied that previous lectures had not been free-of-charge in a meaningful sense: lectures always have related costs. What mattered was whether attendees or non-attendees covered those costs. Friedman {{thought that it was}} fairer that only those who attended paid. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>discussion</b> Friedman also stated that he did not receive any money for delivering that lecture.|$|E

[...] He explained in 1997: [...] "It's part of what we Buddhists call bad sexual conduct. Sexual organs were created for reproduction between the male element and the female element — and everything that deviates from that is not acceptable from a Buddhist point of view," [...] while penis-vagina non-procreative sex is not considered to be sexual misconduct. The Dalai Lama admitted that {{there is a difference between}} the views of believers and unbelievers: [...] "From a Buddhist point of view, men-to-men and women-to-women is generally considered sexual misconduct. From society's point of view, mutually agreeable homosexual relations can be of mutual benefit, enjoyable and harmless." ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>discussion</b> Ptolemy makes a {{point that}} was to be called upon by many later astrological writers, that [...] "the lesser cause always yields to the stronger". [...] He sees an {{individual}} as unable to resist the greater cycles of change which happen to the wider community, so even a man whose horoscope indicates gain may perish at a time that his community is struck by natural disaster or pestilence. However, Ptolemy also maintains that disastrous events will only follow a natural course if no counter action is taken to avert the problem, as when [...] "future happenings to men are not known, or if they are known and the remedies are not applied". [...] He takes a balanced position in the argument of fate versus free will in writing that certain things, because their effective causes are numerous, become inevitable, whilst others are able to be averted by the act of astrological prediction. The astrologer's position is compared to that of the physician, who must be able to recognise beforehand which ailments are always fatal, and which admit of aid.|$|E

2500|$|Indeed, {{the fourth}} dispute asserts that {{judgment}} {{is coming in}} the form of a messenger who [...] "is like refiner's fire and like fullers' soap [...] [...] [...]" [...] (3:2). Following this, the prophet provides another example of wrongdoing in the fifth dispute – that is, failing to offer full tithes. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>discussion,</b> Malachi has Yahweh request the people to [...] "Bring the full tithe [...] [...] [...] [...] see if I will not open the windows of heaven for you and pour down on you an overflowing blessing" [...] (3:10). This request offers the opportunity for the people to amend their ways. It also stresses that keeping the Lord's statutes will not only allow the people to avoid God's wrath, but will also lead to God's blessing. In the sixth dispute, the people of Israel illustrate the extent of their disillusionment. Malachi has them say [...] "'It is vain to serve God [...] [...] [...] Now we count the arrogant happy; evildoers not only prosper, but when they put God to the test they escape'" [...] (3:14–15). Once again, Malachi has Yahweh assure the people that the wicked will be punished and the faithful will be rewarded.|$|E
2500|$|The {{origin of}} the term {{is in the works}} of Aristotle. The most {{well-known}} such case is De Anima Book III, chapter 2, especially at line 425a27. The passage is about how the animal mind converts raw sense perceptions from the five specialized sense perceptions, into perceptions of real things moving and changing, which can be thought about. According to Aristotle's understanding of perception, each of the five senses perceives one type of [...] "perceptible" [...] or [...] "sensible" [...] which is specific (Greek: idia) to it. For example, sight can see colour. But Aristotle was explaining how the animal mind, not just the human mind, links and categorizes different tastes, colours, feelings, smells and sounds in order to perceive real things in terms of the [...] "common sensibles" [...] (or [...] "common perceptibles"). <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>discussion</b> [...] "common" [...] (koinos) is a term opposed to specific or particular (idia). The Greek for these common sensibles is ta koina, which means shared or common things, and examples include the oneness of each thing, with its specific shape and size and so on, and the change or movement of each thing. Distinct combinations of these properties are common to all perceived things.|$|E
2500|$|The 1956 {{document}} couches {{the violence}} and occupation of the island of Ireland in {{a long history of}} armed resistance to occupation. [...] The first Chapter is entirely taken up with providing this history from the viewpoint of the organisation. [...] It provides information on the Kerne, the battle of the Yellow Ford, Owen Roe O'Neill, the 1798 Rebellion and United Irishmen, James Fintan Lalor, and the [...] "Tan War". All are described as being within the context of legitimate resistance to the occupation of Ireland. [...] This discussion is largely romanticised and aimed at demonstrating a lineage of [...] "armed struggle" [...] from which the IRA assumes its legitimacy in the fight against [...] "occupying forces in Ireland". [...] One entry <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>discussion</b> {{is the fact that the}} efforts of IRA guerrillas were the direct cause in ending the British occupation of the 26 counties of Ireland—the territory that would become the Irish Free State, and later the Republic of Ireland. [...] The 1956 manual also implies that the bulk of the IRA's work in [...] "freeing Ireland from occupation" [...] is over. This indicates both a [...] "southern" [...] perspective on Irish independence and an underestimation of the resistance they would encounter during the Border Campaign, that was aimed at the end of British rule in Northern Ireland. With the publication of the 1977 edition this assumption of an easy victory in ending partition had been dropped and the [...] "Long War" [...] strategy adopted.|$|E
