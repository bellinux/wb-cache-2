25|$|The americium-241 in {{ionizing}} {{smoke detectors}} poses a potential environmental hazard, albeit {{a very small}} one. Disposal regulations and recommendations for smoke detectors vary from region to region. The amount of radioactive material contained in ionizing smoke detectors is very small and thus doesn't represent a significant radiological hazard. If the americium is left in the ionization chamber of the alarm the radiological risk is insignificant because the chamber acts as a shield to the alpha radiation. A person would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>open</b> the sealed chamber and ingest or inhale the americium for the risk to be significant. The radiation risk of exposure to an ionic smoke detector is much smaller than natural background radiation under normal operation.|$|E
25|$|With {{the victory}} over Providence, the Phantoms were {{back to the}} Calder Cup Finals {{for the first time}} since 1998 and would meet the Chicago Wolves, another {{powerhouse}} team that up until that point had breezed through the playoffs including a sweep of the Manitoba Moose in the Western Conference Finals. While both teams had plenty of scoring power, it was expected to be a battle of two stellar Finnish goaltenders—the Phantoms' Niittymaki and the Wolves' Kari Lehtonen—who had both been stellar performers all season long. Even though the Phantoms had finished the regular season with 103 points on a record of 48–25–3–4, for the first time in the 2005 post-season they would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>open</b> a series on the road, as Chicago had finished with 105 points (49–24–5–2) and had lost just seven times at home all season.|$|E
500|$|On August 7, 2013, the Libertarian Party filed {{a lawsuit}} stating that they were denied access to have their {{candidate}} on the ballot due to a conflict between state law and the state constitution. State law provided for ten days to obtain ballot petition signatures, while the state constitution provided for fifteen days. On August 12, Colorado District Court Judge Robert McGahey ruled that the state constitution's provisions had to be followed, and that prospective candidates had until August 26 to turn in their petitions. The Colorado Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal. The ruling meant that election officials {{would be unable to}} conduct the election by mail, as is usual for Colorado, and would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>open</b> up polls for in-person voting. Morse stated that not voting by mail was [...] "bad for everybody." ...|$|E

2500|$|Mark Gardner pitched nine no-hit {{innings in}} a July 26, [...] game before losing 1–0 in the 10th inning to the Los Angeles Dodgers. [...] Two days later, also in Los Angeles, Dennis Martínez {{achieved}} a rare feat, throwing the 13th official perfect game in Major League Baseball history (based on MLB's 1991 redefinition {{of a perfect}} game), winning 2–0. Dave Van Horne's iconic call of [...] "El Presidente, El Perfecto!" [...] following the final out became a hallmark of Expos lore. Martinez's catcher, Ron Hassey, also caught Len Barker's perfect game ten years earlier and remains the only player to catch two perfect games in MLB history. The euphoria of the pitching feats did not last, as the Expos were rendered homeless for the final month of the season after a 50-ton beam collapsed from Olympic Stadium's structure and fell nine metres onto a public concourse hours before a motocross event on September 13. [...] The Expos hinted that they would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>open</b> the 1992 season elsewhere unless Olympic Stadium was certified safe. [...] While the stadium itself was given {{a clean bill of}} health by engineers in November, it took longer to get one for the roof since it had been badly ripped in a June windstorm. [...] Ultimately, it was decided to keep the roof closed at all times; it had only been opened 88 times in a little more than four years.|$|E
