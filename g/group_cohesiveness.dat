5|$|Team {{effectiveness}} (also {{referred to}} as group effectiveness) is the capacity a team has to accomplish the goals or objectives administered by an authorized personnel or the organization. A team {{is a collection of}} individuals who are interdependent in their tasks, share responsibility for outcomes, and view themselves as a unit embedded in an institutional or organizational system which operates within the established boundaries of that system. Teams and groups have established a synonymous relationship within the confines of processes and research relating to their effectiveness (i.e. <b>group</b> <b>cohesiveness,</b> teamwork) while still maintaining their independence as two separate units, as groups and their members are independent of each other's role, skill, knowledge or purpose versus teams and their members, who are interdependent upon each other's role, skill, knowledge and purpose.|$|E
25|$|Since Woolley et al.'s {{results do}} not show any {{influence}} of group satisfaction, <b>group</b> <b>cohesiveness,</b> or motivation, they, at least implicitly, challenge these concepts regarding the importance for group performance in general and thus contrast meta-analytically proven evidence concerning {{the positive effects of}} group cohesion, motivation and satisfaction on group performance.|$|E
25|$|As the {{workplace}} is changing to include more group-based systems, researching motivation within these groups is of growing importance. To date, {{a great amount of}} research has focused on the Job characteristic theory and the Goal-setting Theory. While more research is needed that draws on a broader range of motivation theories, research thus far has concluded several things: (a) semi-autonomous groups report higher levels of job scope (related to intrinsic job satisfaction), extrinsic satisfaction, and organizational commitment; and (b) developmentally mature teams have higher job motivation and innovation. Further, voluntarily formed work teams report high work motivation. Though research shows that appropriate goal-setting influences group motivation and performance, more research is needed in this area (group goals, individual goals, cohesiveness, etc.). There are inseparable mediating variables consisting of <b>group</b> <b>cohesiveness,</b> commitment, and performance. As {{the workplace}} environment calls for more and more teams to be formed, research into motivation of teams is ever-pressing. Thus far, overarching research merely suggests that individual-level and team-level sources of motivation are congruent with each other. Consequently, research should be expanded to apply more theories of motivation; look at group dynamics; and essentially conclude how groups can be most impacted to increase motivation and, consequently, performance.|$|E

50|$|A {{symbolic}} cue is a word, phrase, slogan, or a nonverbal sign or {{gesture that}} works to trigger previously shared fantasies and emotions.

50|$|Another {{perspective}} {{emphasizes the}} importance of emotional attraction in group settings. It defines group emotion as members' desire to be together, and finds that emotional ties are a type of glue which holds groups together and influences the <b>group's</b> <b>cohesiveness</b> and the commitment to the task. This perspective focuses on the positive emotions of liking the other group members and the task at hand.|$|R
2500|$|According to Thomas Ambrosio, [...] "like other {{societal}} interest groups, {{ethnic identity}} groups establish formal organizations devoted to promoting <b>group</b> <b>cohesiveness</b> and addressing group concerns." [...] While many formal organizations established by ethnic identity groups are apolitical, others are created explicitly for political purposes. [...] In general, groups {{who seek to}} influence government policy on domestic or foreign issues {{are referred to as}} lobby groups or 'interest groups'. [...] Those groups established by ethnic identity groups are referred as to ethnic interest groups.|$|E
2500|$|I/O {{psychologists are}} also {{concerned}} with organizational change. This effort, called organizational development (OD). Tools used to advance organization development include the survey feedback technique. The technique involves the periodic assessment (with surveys) of employee attitudes and feelings. The results are conveyed to organizational stakeholders, who {{may want to}} take the organization in a particular direction. Another tool is the team building technique. Because many if not most [...] tasks within the organization are completed by small groups and/or teams, team building is important to organizational success. In order to enhance a team's morale and problem-solving skills, I/O psychologists help the groups to build their self-confidence, <b>group</b> <b>cohesiveness,</b> and working effectiveness.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Group</b> <b>cohesiveness</b> {{is another}} {{variable}} {{that can affect}} the helping behaviour of a bystander. As defined by Rutkowski et al., cohesiveness refers to an established relationship (friends, acquaintances) between two or more people. Experiments have been done to test the performance of bystanders {{when they are in}} groups with people they have been acquainted with. According to Rutkowski et al., the social responsibility norm affects helping behavior. The norm of social responsibility states that [...] "people should help others who are in need of help and who are dependent on them for it." [...] As suggested by the research, the more cohesive a group, the more likely the group will act in accordance to the social responsibility norm. To test this hypothesis, researchers used undergraduate students and divided them into four groups: a low cohesive group with two people, a low cohesive group with four people, a high cohesive group with two people, and a high cohesive group with four people. Students in the high cohesive group were then acquainted with each other by introducing themselves and discussing what they liked/disliked about school and other similar topics. The point of the experiment was {{to determine whether or not}} high cohesive groups were more willing to help a hurt [...] "victim" [...] than the low cohesive groups. The four member high cohesive groups were the quickest and most likely groups to respond to the victim who they believed to be hurt. The four member low cohesive groups were the slowest and least likely to respond to the victim.|$|E
50|$|Employee {{perceptions}} in {{the workplace}} may create an atmosphere in which an individual feels the freedom to use their creativity and unique skills. Workers may welcome this freedom to increase motivation and develop a deeper liking towards their job. If individuals feel a deeper connection with their job, {{it is thought that}} individuals will then ultimately take more pride in their work. Participatory management can have a positive perception on some, while on others it could lead to egotistic behaviors, and ultimately disrupt the <b>group's</b> <b>cohesiveness.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Janis {{emphasized}} that cohesiveness {{is the main}} factor that leads to groupthink. <b>Groups</b> that lack <b>cohesiveness</b> can of course make bad decisions, {{but they do not}} experience groupthink. In a cohesive group, members avoid speaking out against decisions, avoid arguing with others, and work towards maintaining friendly relationships in the <b>group.</b> If <b>cohesiveness</b> gets to such a high level where there are no longer disagreements between members, then the group is ripe for groupthink.|$|R
50|$|Group {{relationship}} {{is important and}} has effects on employees' absenteeism and turnover rate. Cohesive groups increase job satisfactions. Mann and Baumgartel state that the sense of group belongingness, group pride, group solidarity or group spirit relates inversely to the absenteeism rate. Among the target groups, <b>group</b> with high <b>cohesiveness</b> tend to have low absenteeism rate while <b>group</b> with low <b>cohesiveness</b> tend to have higher absenteeism rate.|$|R
50|$|Similarity {{of group}} members has {{different}} influences on <b>group</b> <b>cohesiveness</b> {{depending on how}} to define this concept. Lott and Lott (1965) who refer to interpersonal attraction as <b>group</b> <b>cohesiveness</b> conducted an extensive review on the literature and found that individuals' similarities in background (e.g., race, ethnicity, occupation, age), attitudes, values and personality traits have generally positive association with <b>group</b> <b>cohesiveness.</b>|$|E

50|$|Symbolic {{convergence}} theory (SCT) is {{a communication}} theory developed by Ernest Bormann where people share common fantasies and these collections of individuals are {{transformed into a}} cohesive group. SCT offers {{an explanation for the}} appearance of a <b>group's</b> <b>cohesiveness,</b> consisting of shared emotions, motives, and meanings. Through SCT, individual can build a community or a group consciousness which grow stronger if they share a cluster of fantasy themes. Symbolic convergence theory provides a description of the dynamic tendencies within systems of social interaction that cause communicative practices and forms to evolve. This theory allows theorists and practitioners to anticipate or predict what will happen and explain what did happen. One thing SCT does not do is allow for prediction and control of human communication. It attempts to explain how communication can create and sustain group consciousness through the sharing of narratives or fantasies.|$|R

In the current case study, we propose an alternative potential form of groupthink in which the <b>group’s</b> <b>cohesiveness</b> results from the shared pursuit of a collective goal rather than from strong interpersonal bonds between members. Our model, recognizing the multifaceted nature of cohesion, assumes that a group whose members are united {{in pursuit of a}} valued collective goal while guided by a directive leader may experience breakdowns in the decision process. Specifically, drawing on reviews of personal accounts, media descriptions, online interviews, and past empirical papers, we propose that the May 1996 Mount Everest disaster can be understood in part from a groupthink perspective. Applications for the proposed model are discussed, along with implications for leaders seeking to improve organizational decision-making practices...|$|R
50|$|On {{the other}} hand, from the {{perspective}} of social attraction as the basis of <b>group</b> <b>cohesiveness,</b> similarity among group members is the cue for individuals to categorize themselves and others into either an ingroup or outgroup.

5000|$|Other theorists {{believe that}} {{attraction}} to {{the group as a}} whole causes group cohesion. This concept of being attracted to the group itself is reminiscent of the social identity theory. According to Hogg (1992), <b>group</b> <b>cohesiveness</b> is based on social attraction, which refers to [...] "attraction among members of a salient social group" [...] (p. 100). Hogg uses self-categorization theory to explain how <b>group</b> <b>cohesiveness</b> develops from social attraction. The theory states that when looking at others' similarities and differences, individuals mentally categorize themselves and others as part of a group, in-group members, or as not part of a group, out-group members. From this type of categorizing, the stereotypes of their group becomes more prominent in the individual's mind. This leads the individual to think and behave according to group norms, thus resulting in {{attraction to the}} group as a whole. This process is known as depersonalization of self-perception. The social attraction (as used in Hogg's theory) refers to the liking of depersonalized characteristics, the prototype of the group, which is distinct from interpersonal attraction among individuals within the group. It is also important to note that <b>group</b> <b>cohesiveness</b> is more associated with group attraction than with attraction to individual members.|$|E
40|$|People's {{tendency}} to be more generous toward identifiable victims than toward unidentifiable or statistical victims {{is known as the}} Identifiable Victim Effect. Recent research has called the generality of this effect into question, showing that in cross-national contexts, identifiability mostly affects willingness to help victims of one's own "in-group. " Furthermore, in inter-group conflict situations, identifiability increased generosity toward a member of the adversary group, but decreased generosity toward a member of one's own group. In the present research we examine the role of group-cohesiveness as an underlying factor accounting for these divergent findings. In particular, we examined novel groups generated in the lab, using the minimal group paradigm, as well as natural groups of students in regular exercise sections. Allocation decisions in dictator games revealed that a <b>group's</b> <b>cohesiveness</b> affects generosity toward in-group and out-group recipients differently, depending on their identifiability. In particular, in cohesive groups the identification of an in-group recipient decreased, rather than increased generosity...|$|R

The group dynamics, longevity and effectiveness strongly depend on group's ability to attract new members and keep them engaged in group activities. It was shown that high heterogeneity of scientist's engagement in conference activities of the specific scientific community depends on the balance between the numbers of previous attendances and non-attendances and is directly related to scientist's association with that community. Here we show that the same holds for leisure groups of the Meetup website and further quantify individual members' association with the group. We examine how structure of personal social networks is evolving with the event attendance. Our results show that member's increasing engagement in the group activities is primarily associated with the strengthening of already existing ties and increase in the bonding social capital.

The therapeutic or curative quality of patient-therapist interaction has long been a focus in psychotherapy research.

The therapist-researcher most associated with the study of curative factors in group therapy is Irvin Yalom.
