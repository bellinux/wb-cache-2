40|$|ABSTRACT Among the {{agricultural}} environments of traditional communities, <b>home</b> <b>gardens</b> are frequently cited as high agrobiodiversity sites. However, the agrobiodiversity of <b>home</b> <b>gardens</b> along a rural-urban gradient demands study {{in order to}} identify possible influences of urbanization and to support mitigation of impacts. The present work investigated the role <b>home</b> <b>gardens</b> play in the in situ agrobiodiversity conservation of plants in quilombola communities with different degrees of urbanization. The study found that more urbanized communities have larger <b>home</b> <b>gardens,</b> but the average richness of plant species in these areas was not statistically different among the communities. Furthermore, the abundance of plant species was similar. Medicinal and food plants were mainly found in <b>home</b> <b>gardens</b> of the communities with high to intermediate levels of urbanization, while ornamental plants were more common in rural community <b>home</b> <b>gardens.</b> It is believed that crop exclusivity in <b>home</b> <b>gardens</b> of the more urbanized communities highly influenced the results, increasing the role <b>home</b> <b>gardens</b> play in maintaining traditional practices.

The {{aim of this}} thesis was to explore how rural households with HIV and AIDS in Ghana are employing <b>home</b> <b>garden</b> management strategies to enhance food and nutrition security and also to examine the seasonal dimension of coping with food insecurity in these rural households through documentation of the frequency and severity of the food–related coping behaviours adopted during periods of peak seasonal food shortages. In Sub-Saharan Africa, <b>home</b> <b>garden</b> cultivation {{is considered to be}} a potential strategy for rural households with HIV and AIDS to cope with labour constraints and to improve food and nutrition security. However, existing research that has addressed the relationship between HIV and AIDS, <b>home</b> <b>gardens</b> and food security focused on predictions; there is severe dearth of empirical evidence. Qualitative and quantitative research methodologies were used in this study. Data collection methods included focus group discussions, interviews with key informants, a questionnaire-based survey, in-depth interviews in case studies and participant observations. A 24 -hour qualitative dietary recall was used to assess dietary intake of households studied and the Coping Strategy Index was used to assess the severity of household food-related coping behaviours. Data on biophysical aspects of the <b>home</b> <b>gardens</b> was obtained through a <b>home</b> <b>garden</b> survey. The results showed that when labour constraint reduced field cultivation in rural households with HIV and AIDS, labour input in <b>home</b> <b>garden</b> significantly increased; rural households did not cultivate a greater diversity of plant species in <b>home</b> <b>gardens,</b> but rather relatively more food items of the essential food groups were consumed from <b>home</b> <b>gardens.</b> This contributed significantly to dietary diversity. Uncovering the effect of the interaction between household HIV status and gender of the household head on <b>home</b> <b>garden</b> biodiversity indicated that female-headed households with HIV and AIDS depended more on <b>home</b> <b>gardens</b> than their counterparts without HIV and AIDS in producing crops for sustenance and dietary diversity. Exploring the biodiversity in <b>home</b> <b>gardens</b> of rural households with HIV and AIDS when <b>home</b> <b>garden</b> cultivation is also meant to generate cash income revealed that rural households experiencing HIV and AIDS illness in cultivating commerce-oriented <b>home</b> <b>gardens</b> cultivated a dual purpose <b>home</b> <b>garden</b> that provided cash income and also supplied subsistence food. Assessing the frequency and severity of the food-related coping behaviours adopted by farm households with HIV and AIDS during the post-harvest period and in the lean season showed that farm households with HIV and AIDS were more vulnerable to food insecurity in both the post-harvest and lean season; this vulnerability was also reflected in their poverty, family care burdens (larger number of dependents and ill persons), lower education level and meagre income earning opportunity. It is essential that concerted efforts are made to improve the general well-being of farm households with HIV and AIDS by empowering rural households with HIV and AIDS in terms of capacity building, access to livelihood assets and access to finance.    ...|$|R

Most of these <b>home</b> <b>gardens</b> rely on rain for survival, i. e., rainfed systems. At present <b>home</b> <b>gardens</b> are being neglected due to social and environmental problems. Among these issues, the scarcity of water during cropping seasons is the most important issue that adversely affects crop production from <b>home</b> <b>gardens.</b> This is mainly due to the occurrence of unexpected dry periods during the cropping seasons, and the requirement to have a water source at the farmer’s residence to irrigate the <b>home</b> <b>garden</b> during the dry spells (to capture and conserve roof runoff in the <b>home</b> <b>gardens</b> for subsequent use) is an appropriate green option to mitigate this situation. Microlevel rainwater tanks are promoted to be used to collect roof runoff water during wet periods enabling the farmer to irrigate his <b>home</b> <b>garden</b> crops during dry periods. Field experiments were carried out at Mapalana Research Farm in Sri Lanka to obtain the roof runoff coefficients from commonly used roof types; namely: asbestos, tiles, and thatched (either straw or woven coconut leaves). The objective of the case study is to develop a methodology to estimate the optimum size of a rainwater tank based on the roof size, roof cover, climatic conditions, and the irrigation requirement for <b>home</b> <b>garden</b> irrigation.

Results found 96 speciesbelonged to 85 genera and 36 families of useful plants in UKI <b>home</b> <b>gardens.</b> Those plants used for shading area,fruits and ornamental plants. Arecaceae and Euphorbiaceae are families with {{the highest number of}} species (11 and 9), respectively. The similarity index of plants was 0. 07 to 0. 49 in each location...|$|R
40|$|Biodiversity {{consists}} of wide range diversity such as genetic diversity, species diversity and ecosystem diversity. Nowadays, agrobiodiversity conservation is one {{the most important}} aspects of sustainable agriculture. In this research, agrobiodiversity in farmlands, <b>gardens</b> and <b>home</b> <b>garden</b> systems was assessed and compared. In addition the role of <b>home</b> <b>gardens</b> as an effective strategy in In-situ conservation was evaluated. Needed information was obtained by questionnaire method in eight villages in east of Tehran province (Jajrood basin). The questionnaires were completed by 30 percent of households in the area during 2009 and 2010. The result showed that, richness and Shannon indices which were indicators of spices diversity in <b>home</b> <b>gardens</b> were more in farmlands and horticulture ecosystems Results also revealed that in some villages like Siahsang which lots of farmland and garden ecosystems had been disappeared, <b>home</b> <b>gardens</b> were the only conservative systems of species, which indicate the important function of <b>home</b> <b>gardens</b> species conservation. In this study Maranak and Khosroabad villages with 7 and 12 species, respectively in farmland and gardens show had the highest species richness index in agricultural ecosystems...|$|R
40|$|<b>Home</b> <b>gardens</b> are {{considered}} as vital units for enhancing food security particularly {{in developing nations}} of South Asia, such as Sri Lanka. Although the yam crop Dioscorea spp. constitute a popular but still minor component in Sri Lankan <b>home</b> <b>gardens,</b> they have the potential of producing large quantities of edible material with minimal inputs. However, their real value in South Asian <b>home</b> <b>gardens</b> is not yet reported. Hence, this study was carried out to get insights into <b>home</b> <b>garden</b> characteristics, gardener demography as well as current management practices within 300 Sri Lankan <b>home</b> <b>garden</b> systems that are located along a climatic gradient. By using interviews and field observations, gardeners, who cultivated in particular Dioscorea species, were studied within 10 of the 25 administrative districts distributed in the wet, intermediate and dry climatic zone of Sri Lanka. Furthermore, current management practices of yams cultivation were analyzed on local scale and compared afterwards with management recommendations published in the year 2006 by the Department of Agriculture. Dioscorea species were found in a majority of <b>home</b> <b>gardens,</b> especially in wet and intermediate zones of Sri Lanka. D. alata was the most prominent species and was managed at a subsistence level and not as per recommendations developed by the Department of Agriculture. Our results revealed that Dioscorea alata is {{an essential component of}} Sri Lankan <b>home</b> <b>gardens</b> in rural areas and can yield substantial quantities of edible tubers with low input, especially during times of food scarcities, and has therefore the potential to enhance food security and rural development...|$|R

40|$|<b>Home</b> <b>gardens</b> {{are defined}} as less complex agroforests which look like and {{function}} as natural forest ecosystems but are integrated into agricultural management systems located around houses. Investigations were carried out in 187 households. The aim {{of the study was}} to identify the different types of banana <b>home</b> <b>gardens</b> existing in the periurban zone of Ngaoundere town. The results showed that the majority of <b>home</b> <b>gardens</b> in the area were very young (less than 15 years old) and very small in size (less than 1 [*]ha). Eleven types of <b>home</b> <b>gardens</b> were found in the periurban area of Ngaoundere town. The different <b>home</b> <b>garden</b> types showed important variations in all their structural characteristics. Two local species of banana are cultivated in the systems, Musa sinensis and Musa paradisiaca. The total banana production is 3. 57 tons per year. The total quantity of banana consumed in the periurban zone was 3. 54 tons (93. 5 %) whereas 1. 01 tons were sold in local or urban markets. The main banana producers belonged to <b>home</b> <b>gardens</b> 2, 4, 7, and 9. The quantity of banana offered to relatives was more than what the farmers received from others. Farmers, rely on agroforests because the flow of their products helps them consolidate friendship and conserve biodiversity at the same time...|$|R
40|$|Growing food locally, through {{community}}-supported agriculture, community <b>gardens,</b> and <b>home</b> <b>gardens,</b> {{can increase}} availability, accessibility, and affordability {{of fruits and}} vegetables. Although numerous studies have demonstrated the potential associations between local food production and healthy diets within the community garden context, fewer {{studies have focused on}} the role of the <b>home</b> <b>garden</b> and whether it is amenable to intervention. In a predominantly low-income and Latino community in west Denver, Re:Vision International aims to promote the use of <b>home</b> <b>gardens</b> to improve diet, activity, blood pressure, weight status, and overall health. In partnership with Re:Vision, we conducted a post-hoc analysis of survey data to understand the associations between participation in the <b>home</b> <b>garden</b> program and diet, self- reported health, exercise, body mass index, and blood pressure (n= 37). After adjusting for income, marital status, gender, age, and neighborhood attachment, no statistically significant relationships were observed. These analyses are severely limited by a small sample size. However, the direction, dose response relationship, and biological significance suggest that further investigation of <b>home</b> <b>gardens</b> and population health outcomes are warranted. Although no definite conclusions can be drawn, the literature and the direction of the results suggests that participation in a community-based intervention to <b>home</b> <b>gardening</b> may have the potential to change resident’s diet and blood pressure. Further research is needed to confirm these postulations...|$|R
40|$|Ethnobotanical {{survey was}} {{conducted}} in 101 randomly selected <b>home</b> <b>gardens</b> of Phong My commune, central Vietnam, situated in the buffer-zone of Natural Reserve. Data were collected through semi-structured questionnaires and direct observation. Sixty-seven species belonging to 35 families were identified {{to be used for}} various purposes. For each species the botanical and vernacular names, plant parts used and main purposes of use are given. The major use categories reported for plant species were food (86 %), medicine (32 %) and firewood (32 %), however, seventy-seven percent of all inventoried plants have multiple uses. The species Artocarpus heterophyllus Lam., Citrus grandis Osbeck, Citrusreticulata Blanco, Ipomoea batatas (L.) Lam. and Musa spp. were identified as the main sources of plant foods consumed within the households. Statistical analyses indicated by Shannon-Wiener and Margalef indices have shown that local species diversity and richness is affected by <b>home</b> <b>garden</b> size. On the contrary, no relationship between diversity and <b>home</b> <b>garden</b> age was found. On the basis of a cluster analysis of plant species diversity, five <b>home</b> <b>garden</b> types were differentiated. In comparison to previously reported studies on tropical <b>home</b> <b>gardens,</b> the diversity in Phong My is lower, probably due to market-oriented strategy. Nevertheless, based on the results achieved, we can conclude that useful plants cultivated in local <b>home</b> <b>gardens</b> provide valuable foods complementing daily diet and subsequently contributing to socioeconomic status of the households...|$|R
40|$|The Brahmaputra is {{the largest}} river system in {{northeast}} India. Its valley, in the State of Assam, {{is home to the}} Assamese people, indigenous Mishing and Karbi tribes, and Kaziranga National Park. A spectacular array of wildlife shares the floodplain including the endangered Asian elephant, tiger, one-horned rhinoceros and wild buffalo. The fertile floodplain and tea estates have attracted immigrants from within India and from neighboring countries. Migration has been linked to Assam 2 ̆ 7 s high population density and agriculture expansion. Based on household surveys in 37 villages in the park 2 ̆ 7 s periphery, we compared <b>home</b> <b>garden</b> productivity and economic return among residents and immigrants of different ethnic groups and explored the hypothesis that residents had an advantage over immigrants in maximizing gains from <b>home</b> <b>gardens</b> resources. The results indicated that, although resident <b>home</b> <b>gardens</b> were larger, production from immigrant <b>home</b> <b>gardens</b> was over four times higher and their economic returns were greater. Immigrants, who tended to live in low-lying areas close to the park and whose land tenure was less certain, were at higher risk of crop damage by wildlife and floods. They compensated in part by maximizing productivity of <b>home</b> <b>gardens</b> and by choosing crops that yielded greater economic return. We conclude that <b>home</b> <b>gardens</b> provide a basis for distinguishing between resident and immigrant land use practices...|$|R
