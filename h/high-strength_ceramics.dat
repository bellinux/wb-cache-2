40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the {{mechanical}} behavior of <b>high-strength</b> dental <b>ceramics,</b> lithium disilicate glass ceramics (LDGC) using nanoindentation and in situ scanning probe microscopy (SPM). The nanoindentation hardness and Young's moduli of LDGC were measured {{as a function of}} the applied indentation load. The indentation load/size effect (ISE) was analyzed for both measured nanoindentation hardness and Young's moduli. The true hardness, i. e., the load-independent hardness, was determined based on the proportional specimen resistance (PSR) model. Nanoindentation-induced plasticity in LDGC was characterized by in situ SPM imaging of the indented volumes and by measuring pile-up heights of indented cross-sections. The results show that both nanoindentation hardness and Young's modulus are load-dependent following the expended Meyer's law using a power series. At the nanoindentation loads, indented LDGC can be mainly plastically deformed by limiting cracking events. This unusual behavior, for nominally brittle materials, influences the mode of contact damage in applications such as machining, polishing, wear, impact damage and hardness testing for dental restorations...|$|R

The modified diatomite particles had reduced particle size, narrower size distribution, and were well dispersed, with good adsorption of nano-ZrO 2. To determine the optimum addition levels for nano-ZrO 2, ceramics containing 0, 20, 25, 30, and 35 wt% nano-ZrO 2 were sintered and characterized by the three-point bending test and microhardness test.

A few implant superstructures were screw-retained, whereas all remaining restorations were cemented on natural teeth or zirconia implant abutments. Clinical examination included biologic (probing depths, bleeding on probing) and esthetic (Papilla Index) parameters, as well as technical complications. No implant was lost or caused any problems, but two teeth were lost after horizontal fracture. Overall, the periodontal parameters were favorable. Fractures of frameworks or implant abutments were not observed. Abutment-screw loosening occurred once for one premolar single crown. Furthermore, five implant crowns in the posterior region exhibited chipping of the porcelain veneering material.

40|$|Reported {{clinical}} {{success rates}} of all-ceramic fixed partial dentures (FPDs) made of <b>high-strength</b> oxide <b>ceramics</b> range between 82. 5 % and 100 %. The {{main cause of}} all-ceramic FPD failure is fracture in the connector area. There is, however, no consensus on what connector dimensions are adequate. The aim of this in-vitro study was, therefore, to compare the fracture strength of four-unit Y-TZP FPD cores designed with different connector diameters. A total of 40 four-unit FPD cores supported by end abutments and having two pontics were manufactured in Procera Zirconia. Five groups of FPD cores with connector dimensions of 2. 0, 2. 5, 3. 0, 3. 5 and 4. 0 mm were produced. All FPD cores underwent a firing programme according to the manufacturer's recommendations for the veneering porcelain, a cyclic preload, thermocycling and finally, load until fracture. Fracture strength was significantly higher for each increase in connector diameter except for the 2. 0 -mm and 2. 5 -mm diameters where all fractures occurred during preload. All FPD cores fractured in the connector area. Within the limitations of this in-vitro study, a minimum diameter of 4. 0 mm is recommended for all-ceramic zirconia-based FPDs with long spans or replacing molars.

40|$|An {{additive}} manufacturing technique for <b>high-strength</b> oxide <b>ceramics</b> is presented. Based on {{selective laser melting}} (SLM), a new approach has been developed that allows for tool-less manufacturing of complex shaped ceramic components directly from CAD data. Components are built layer by layer in a powder bed. In the new approach, a purely ceramic powder is completely melted by a laser beam. The powder does not contain any binder or glassy or metallic additives. This way, a density of the ceramic component of almost 100 % is achieved directly by the SLM process, without any post-sintering, and thus without any shrinkage. The ceramic component is created by solidification from melt. In order to avoid crack formation, the ceramic is preheated to a temperature above 1600 °C during the whole build-up process. Using a zirconia-alumina (ZrO 2 - Al 2 O 3) material, a fine-grained microstructure can be achieved and specimens with a flexural strength of more than 500 MPa have been manu factured. Complex shaped ceramic components have been manufactured for demonstration purposes. The build-up rate is {{comparable to that of}} SLM for metallic materials.

40|$|Purpose - The purpose {{this paper}} is to develop an {{additive}} manufacturing (AM) technique for <b>high-strength</b> oxide <b>ceramics.</b> The process development aims at directly manufacturing fully dense ceramic freeform-components with good mechanical properties. Design/methodology/approach - The selective laser melting of the ceramic materials zirconia and alumina has been investigated experimentally. The approach followed up is to completely melt ZrO 2 /Al 2 O 3 powder mixtures by a focused laser beam. In order to reduce thermally induced stresses, the ceramic is preheated to a temperature of at least 1, 600 degrees C during the build up process. Findings - It is possible to manufacture ceramic objects with almost 100 percent density, without any sintering processes or any post-processing. Crack-free specimens have been manufactured that have a flexural strength of more than 500 MPa. Manufactured objects have a fine-grained two-phase microstructure consisting of tetragonal zirconia and alpha-alumina. Research limitations/implications - Future research may focus on improving the surface quality of manufactured components, solving issues related to the cold powder deposition on the preheated ceramic, further increasing the mechanical strength and transferring the technology from laboratory scale to industrial application. Practical implications - Potential applications of this technique include manufacturing individual all-ceramic dental restorations, ceramic prototypes and complex-shaped ceramic components that cannot be made by any other manufacturing technique.

Plastic deformation appears between 2 - 3 km/s, while the SPT emerges above 3 km/s, when the induced pressure reaches over 90 GPa. Plastic deformation in this cubic crystalline material is marked by extensive deformation twinning while at high pressure the original low pressure zinc blend structure is transformed into the more compact rocksalt structure.

Lower second premolar and second molar teeth were placed at 11 mm apart in acrylic resin block. The teeth were prepared to be abutments of FPD. The result of the FEA showed that the FPD could tolerate the force exceeded the maximum normal bite force on molar region in human.

40|$|<b>High-strength</b> {{polycrystalline}} <b>ceramics</b> {{are increasingly}} being used for armor applications because of their light weight and superior ballistic performance over conventional armor steels. However, accurate material modeling needed in ceramic armor design remains a challenge because of their complex behavior under impact loading. A ceramic may display extremely high strength during rapid compression but lose tensile strength when the load reverses from compression to tension. A good understanding of the mechanisms governing the deformation and failure of ceramics under high-stress impact and a capability to accurately predict the resulting effective strengths of both intact and damaged ceramics are critically needed. To this end, a computational methodology for micromechanical analysis of polycrystalline materials has been developed. It combines finite element analysis with microstructural modeling based on the Voronoi polycrystals, and material modeling that considers nonlinear elasticity, crystal plasticity, intergranular shear damage during compression and intergranular Mode-I cracking during tension. ^ Using this method, simulations {{have been carried out}} on polycrystalline α- 6 H silicon carbide and α-phase aluminum oxide to determine if microplasticity is a viable mechanism of inelastic deformation in ceramics undergoing high-pressure uniaxial-strain compression. Further, the competing roles of in-grain microplasticity and intergranular microdamage during a sequence of dynamic compression and tension have been studied. The results show that microplasticity is a more plausible mechanism than microcracking under uniaxial-strain compression. The deformation by limited slip systems can be highly heterogeneous so that a significant amount of grains may remain elastic and thus result in high macroscopic compressive strength. On the other hand, the failure evolution during dynamic load reversal from compression to tension can be well predicted by intergranular Mode-I microcracking. It is found that microplasticity-induced heterogeneity may cause extremely heterogeneous local release process as the confining pressure decreases during unloading giving rise to local tensile stress or even cracking before the completion of macroscopic unloading. The result is a significant reduction in the material 2 ̆ 7 s effective tensile strength. It is also found that the effective tensile strength decreases with the rate of unloading. ...|$|R

Sixteen crowns of each material were fabricated and veneered with glass-ceramic as recommended by the manufacturers. Crown and root dimensions were measured, and 8 crowns of each system were adhesively bonded or conventionally cemented. After the crowns were artificially aged in a simulated oral environment (1, 200, 000 mechanical loads with 50 N; 3, 000 thermal cycles with distilled water between 5 °C and 55 °C; 2 minutes per cycle), fracture resistance and fracture patterns were determined and defect sizes investigated.
