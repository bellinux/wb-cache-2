5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, Nine Inch Nails was {{involved}} in a much-publicized feud with TVT Records, the first record label to sign the band. Reznor objected to the label's attempted interference with his intellectual property. Ultimately, they entered into a joint venture with Interscope Records in which Reznor forfeited a portion of his publishing rights to TVT Music in exchange for the freedom of having his own Nothing Records imprint. In 2005, Reznor sued his former friend and manager John Malm, co-founder of Nothing, for fraud, breach of contract and <b>fiduciary</b> <b>duty,</b> and other claims. Their relationship was formally severed in a New York courtroom, with damages awarded to Reznor in excess of $3 million.|$|E
5|$|The tribe then {{appealed the}} case to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The appellate court found that various federal laws {{required}} the DOI and BIA to maintain historic buildings and to maintain Indian trust properties, but that they did not authorize monetary damages. The court then looked to the 1960 act and determined that this act did create a trust relationship that could be enforced with monetary damages. This was based on common law, with the court referencing the Restatement (Second) of Trusts to outline that a trust requires a trustee (the United States), a beneficiary (the tribe), and a trust body (the land and buildings). The court noted that both parties agreed that there was a trust, but not that damages were authorized. The court held that where the United States had control over the use and maintenance of the buildings to the exclusion of the tribe, a <b>fiduciary</b> <b>duty</b> was created that authorized the tribe to seek monetary damages. The court then reversed and remanded the decision of the trial court. The United States appealed, and the Supreme Court granted certiorari.|$|E

25|$|Therefore, it is {{said the}} {{fiduciary}} has a duty {{not to be in}} a situation where personal interests and <b>fiduciary</b> <b>duty</b> conflict, a duty not to be in a situation where his <b>fiduciary</b> <b>duty</b> conflicts with another <b>fiduciary</b> <b>duty,</b> and not to profit from his fiduciary position without express knowledge and consent.

25|$|Lawyer/client; A {{solicitor}} {{is presumed}} to have a <b>fiduciary</b> <b>duty.</b>|$|E
25|$|A fiduciary's duty {{must not}} {{conflict}} with another <b>fiduciary</b> <b>duty.</b> Conflicts between one <b>fiduciary</b> <b>duty</b> and another <b>fiduciary</b> <b>duty</b> arise most often when {{a lawyer or}} an agent, such as a real estate agent, represent more than one client, {{and the interests of}} those clients conflict. This would occur when a lawyer attempts to represent both the plaintiff and the defendant in the same matter, for example. The rule comes from the logical conclusion that a fiduciary cannot make the principal's interests a top priority if he has two principals and their interests are diametrically opposed; he must balance the interests, which is not acceptable to equity. Therefore, the conflict of duty and duty rule is really an extension of the conflict of interest and duty rules.|$|E

This article starts with the widely accepted assumption that corporate <b>fiduciary</b> <b>duties</b> are valuable assets. Thus, we assume that all stakeholders, including non-shareholder constituencies, benefit from being the subject of the corporate <b>fiduciary</b> <b>duties</b> owed by directors.

40|$|Since 1977, the {{popularity}} of the limited liability company (“LLC”) has grown tremendously, overtaking the corporation and the partnership as the preferred business structure in many jurisdictions. Amidst this growth in popularity, a legal debate has sparked concerning the existence, nature, and extent of the <b>fiduciary</b> and contractual <b>duties</b> owed in the LLC context. Drafters of LLC agreements can adjust fiduciary “norms” through limitation or, in certain jurisdictions like Delaware, through complete elimination of <b>fiduciary</b> <b>duties.</b> However, the implied contractual covenant of good faith and fair dealing (the “Implied Covenant” or the “Covenant”) remains and cannot be waived by the parties. This delicate balance between waivable duties and an unwaivable covenant begs two key questions: What, if any, is the relationship between <b>fiduciary</b> <b>duties</b> and the Implied Covenant, and where is the boundary between the two? Further, how is the scope of the Implied Covenant affected when an LLC agreement eliminates <b>fiduciary</b> <b>duties?</b> The answers to these questions are critical in separating permissible acts under an LLC agreement from acts giving rise to causes of action for breach of contract. The relationship between <b>fiduciary</b> <b>duties</b> and the Implied Covenant is marked by an inherent tension that the Delaware courts have yet to properly resolve. Rather, these courts have structured an extremely narrow view of the Covenant, and have sometimes conflated the Covenant with <b>fiduciary</b> <b>duties,</b> thereby reducing the effectiveness of the Covenant as an independent means of enforcing behavioral norms arising from contractual relationships. Consequently, parties to LLC agreements have been left to question whether the Implied Covenant has any significance independent of <b>fiduciary</b> <b>duties.</b> This Article attempts to shed light on this dilemma, but cautions that, in this unique context, protection under the Covenant appears to be illusory when <b>fiduciary</b> <b>duties</b> are no longer in play...|$|R
