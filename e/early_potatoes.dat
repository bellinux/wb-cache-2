40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the effect of}} non-woven polypropylene covers on plant growth and development, frost protection, tuber yield and quality and the economic effectiveness in <b>early</b> <b>potato</b> production. A high income from <b>early</b> <b>potato</b> production is possible under conditions assuring early setting and rapid gain of tuber yield and its marketing when the price is highest. The application of non-woven polypropylene covers accelerates plant emergence by 28 days and the growth and development of plants in the later period, and results in an <b>earlier</b> new <b>potato</b> harvest by up to 2 - 3 weeks. It also increases the tuber yield and reduces the yield variability in all years. Accelerating plant growth using non-woven polypropylene covers affects not only tuber yield quantity, but also contributes to improvement of the tuber quality, especially {{by an increase in}} dry matter, potassium and phosphorus content of tubers and decrease nitrate concentration. Such a method of potato production requires higher incurred input. Increasing the production inputs is effective when the value of the tuber yield increase obtained as a result of plant covering is higher than the costs incurred. A higher productive effect of covering is usually obtained in years with a cold spring and a very <b>early</b> <b>potato</b> harvest date. A considerable tuber yield increase in cultivation under non-woven polypropylene cover results in decreased unit costs and, consequently, the cost-effectiveness of production is higher than without covering. In conditions favouring rapid potato growth, the production costs of 1 kg tuber under cover are higher, which makes production less profitable than cultivation without plant covering...|$|R

60|$|To the {{employment}} thus secured {{for the poor}} in the mines and fisheries is to be added, as an advantage, the cheapness of rent and living in Cornwall. Good cottages are let at from fifty shillings, to between three and four pounds a-year--turf for firing grows in plenty on the vast tracts of common land overspreading the country--all sorts of vegetables are abundant and cheap, {{with the exception of}} potatoes, which so decreased in 1849, in consequence of the disease, that the winter stock was imported from France, Belgium, and Holland. The <b>early</b> <b>potatoes,</b> however, grown in May and June, are cultivated in large quantities, and realize on exportation a very high price. Corn generally sells a little above the average. Fish is always within the reach of the poorest people. In a good season, a dozen pilchards are sold for one penny. Happily for themselves, the poor in Cornwall do not partake the senseless prejudice against fish, so obstinately adhered to by the poor in many other parts of England. A Cornishman's national pride is in his pilchards--he likes to talk of them, and boast about them to strangers; and with reason, for he depends for the main support of life on the tribute of these little fish which the sea yields annually in almost countless shoals.|$|E

40|$|When a {{traceability}} system takes place, either when mandatory or voluntary, {{many questions}} arise {{that need to}} be addressed and answered. One of the firsts concerns whether it introduces new costs with no gain in efficiency or, on the contrary, the system efficiency increases lowering costs and, as a consequence, market price of the good in hand. Among others, another issue that only rarely is addressed regards the effect of a price change on the final market. The objective of this paper was to simulate the effect on fresh Italian vegetables market of prices change due to a newer traceability procedure, focusing on <b>early</b> <b>potato.</b> Reasons why <b>early</b> <b>potato</b> was the main object of our study will be explained in detail later in the paper. Moreover, this study concerns a demand system estimation that has, as main goal, the measurement of own and cross price elasticities as well as expenditure elasticities. Such estimations are not strictly related with traceability because they measure any change in quantity demanded due to price changes due to any market perturbation. However, since <b>early</b> <b>potato</b> is experiencing a peculiar market and chain change in Italy, our simulation is meant to reason in terms of a “what if” approach, formally simulating the effect of any change in price due to an hypothesis of traceability system involved. In order to estimate a demand system, real household consumption data (3, 000 observations) of a statistically representative sample of the Italian population of households was taken into account. Relevant measures of market variables were estimated by means of a Linear Almost Ideal Demand System implementing a large set of fresh vegetables: <b>potato</b> split in <b>early</b> and late, cabbage, salad, mushrooms, fruits vegetables, roots, asparagus, onion, tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers, beans, zucchinis and others. </span...|$|R

The {{boundary}} that developed, known as the Landsker Line, follows the January isotherm (contour line) of 32 degrees Fahrenheit. Below this line the milder winters promote the growth of winter crops. This means that farmers can grow new grass earlier in the year than other parts of the county. It also means that early new potatoes can become an important cash crop, subject to competition from earlier crops of potatoes imported from the Mediterranean and elsewhere.The main crops are <b>early</b> <b>potatoes,</b> winter brassicas and root vegetables with the harvesting period being between end of October and mid-May. South Pembrokeshire is [...] "known for wonderful root vegetables" [...] which until recently [...] "gained minimal culinary recognition", although dishes such as creamed swede have become fashionable and have helped change perceptions of the crop. Other Pembrokeshire crops include cauliflower, asparagus and summer fruit The cauliflower is said to be [...] "perhaps one of the most prized vegetables" [...] and requires a frost free climate when the curd is developing. The mild climate of Pembrokeshire means it is an important supplier of this vegetable to national markets.Central Pembrokeshire, from the River Cleddau estuary to the west coast, grows cereals for cattle", while most coastal farms are laid down to 50% arable and with 40% under short ley farming, with 10% permanent pasture close to the farm. The arable rotation often included <b>early</b> <b>potatoes,</b> in the first and second years, sometimes with sugar beet or broccoli in the same year, when the potatoes are taken out in June, then three corn crops, the last under sown with a three-years ley, the sequence may be varied, depending on the price of <b>early</b> <b>potatoes,</b> broccoli and sugar beet. Oats are the most popular crop, followed by <b>early</b> <b>potatoes,</b> barley for seed, wheat and sugar beet.|$|E

The field experiment was carried out on podzolic soil in mid-eastern Poland during 2005 – 2007. The study showed a greater beneficial effect of HydroComplex and Nitrophoska Blue Special on the growth of very <b>early</b> <b>potato</b> cultivars than that of Viking 13 and Polimag S. The application of HydroComplex and Nitrophoska Blue Special resulted in greater above-ground plant biomass and assimilation leaf area compared with single-nutrient fertilizers; the leaf area index (LAI) was higher by 0. 28 and 0. 32, respectively. The differences were smaller and not statistically confirmed with the use of Polimag S and Viking 13. When the multi-nutrient complex fertilizers were applied, leaf weight ratio (LWR), leaf area ratio (LAR) and specific leaf area (SLA) were similar to the single-nutrient fertilizers. Of the multi-nutrient complex fertilizers, only Nitrophoska Blue Special resulted in higher tuber yield, on average by 2. 40 t × ha - 1, compared with the single-nutrient fertilizers. The studied cultivars showed a similar response to applied fertilizers. LAI for ‘Gloria’ was higher than for ‘Aster’ and ‘Fresco’, with smaller LAR found in ‘Gloria’. LWR for ‘Fresco’ was smaller than for ‘Aster’ and ‘Gloria’, with higher SLA found in ‘Fresco’. The tuber yield of ‘Aster” (24. 04 t × ha - 1) was higher on average by 3 t × ha - 1 than for ‘Fresco’ and ‘Gloria’...|$|R
