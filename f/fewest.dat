40|$|The {{expressions}} <b>few</b> and a <b>few</b> {{are typically}} {{considered to be}} separate quantifiers. I challenge this assumption, showing that with the appropriate definition of <b>few,</b> a <b>few</b> can be derived compositionally as a + <b>few.</b> The core of the analysis is a proposal that <b>few</b> has a denotation as a one-place predicate which incorporates a negation operator. From this, argument interpretations can be derived for expressions such as <b>few</b> students and a <b>few</b> students, differing only in the scope of negation. I show that this approach adequately captures the interpretive differences between <b>few</b> and a <b>few.</b> I further show that other such pairs are blocked by a constraint against the vacuous application of a. ...|$|R
