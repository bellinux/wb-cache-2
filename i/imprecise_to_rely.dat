40|$|A crucial {{aspect of}} evidential {{reasoning}} in crime investiga-tion involves comparing {{the support that}} evidence provides for alternative hypotheses. Recent work in forensic statis-tics has shown how Bayesian Networks (BNs) can be em-ployed for this purpose. However, the specification of BNs requires conditional probability tables describing the uncer-tain processes under evaluation. When these processes are poorly understood, it is necessary <b>to</b> <b>rely</b> on subjective prob-abilities provided by experts, which are difficult to describe {{in a manner that}} is both accurate and precise. Recent work in qualitative reasoning has developed methods to perform this type of reasoning using coarser representations. However, the latter types of approaches are too <b>imprecise</b> <b>to</b> compare the likelihood of alternative hypotheses. This paper examines the shortcomings of the qualitative approaches when applied to the aforementioned problem, and identifies and integrates techniques to refine them...|$|R

50|$|The data error, however, {{is quite}} large: about 0.5 mag, {{rendering}} the effect too <b>imprecise</b> <b>to</b> significantly improve the cosmic distance ladder. Another limitation {{comes from the}} fact that the measurement of W0 in distant stars is very challenging, requires long observations at big telescopes. Sometimes the emission feature in the core of the K line is affected by the interstellar extinction. In these cases an accurate measurement of W0 is not possible.|$|R

Work is currently being undertaken to improve the measurement, monitoring and management of systemic risk. That requires it to be defined, which is unproblematic, and operationalized, which is not. While promising methods to measure risk exist, the data demands are so pronounced that statistical risk monitoring will remain an imprecise science for years to come...|$|R
50|$|Absolute radiometric dating {{requires}} a measurable fraction of parent nucleus {{to remain in}} the sample rock. For rocks dating {{back to the beginning of}} the solar system, this requires extremely long-lived parent isotopes, making measurement of such rocks' exact ages <b>imprecise.</b> <b>To</b> be able to distinguish the relative ages of rocks from such old material, and to get a better time resolution than that available from long-lived isotopes, short-lived isotopes that are no longer present in the rock can be used.|$|R

Our implementation includes the computation of (may and must) side effects and optimizations like pruning definitions with simple linear-time algorithms. This paper also provides comprehensive test results and statistics for a large test suite. 1...|$|R

50|$|One of the more-challenging {{problems}} tackled by Hooke was {{the measurement}} of the distance to a star (other than the Sun). The star chosen was Gamma Draconis and the method to be used was parallax determination. After several months of observing, in 1669, Hooke believed that the desired result had been achieved. It is now known that Hooke's equipment was far too <b>imprecise</b> <b>to</b> allow the measurement to succeed. Gamma Draconis was the same star James Bradley used in 1725 in discovering the aberration of light.|$|R
50|$|The {{experiments}} {{suggested by}} Newton are too <b>imprecise</b> <b>to</b> measure an absolute rotation, if any, of the Earth. French physicist Georges Sagnac conducted an experiment that {{was similar to}} the Michelson-Morley experiment, but was intended to observe the effects of rotation. The Sagnac experiment and later similar experiments showed that a stationary object {{on the surface of the}} Earth will rotate once every rotation of the Earth when using stars as a stationary reference point. Rotation was thus concluded to be absolute rather than relative.|$|R

30|$|Although, the {{integrated}} methodology and the software prototype are introduced for ETL software selection problem, {{it can also}} be applied for any other software selection problem involving multiple and conflicting criteria. For further studies, different techniques of MCDM, such as ELECTRE, MACBETH, PROMETHEE, can be used and comparison of the results can be explored. Probably, the pair-wise comparison of the proposed methodology seems insufficient and too <b>imprecise</b> <b>to</b> capture exactly the judgments of decision-makers, which is serious limitation.

5000|$|Leibniz's {{concept of}} infinitesimals, long {{considered}} <b>to</b> be too <b>imprecise</b> <b>to</b> {{be used as}} a foundation of calculus, was eventually replaced by rigorous concepts developed by Weierstrass and others. Consequently, Leibniz's quotient notation was re-interpreted to stand for the limit of the modern definition. However, in many instances, the symbol did seem to act as an actual quotient would and its usefulness kept it popular {{even in the face of}} several competing notations. In the modern rigorous treatment of non-standard calculus, justification can be found to again consider the notation as representing an actual quotient.|$|R
