The <b>reproductive</b> <b>capacity</b> of {{the female}} rat as {{determined}} by cyclic behaviour, ovulation rate and number of viable foetuses after 19 days of pregnancy has been studied in relation to nutrient intake. <b>Reproductive</b> <b>capacity</b> decreased with increase {{in the degree of}} nutrient restriction imposed, but unrestricted feeding for 12 hr immediately before the estimated time of ovulation significantly increased the ovulation rate (P< 0 =. 5) though not the number of viable foetuses of underfed rats...|$|R

40|$|Twelve Merino sheep were {{experimentally}} {{shown to}} be susceptible to infection with Trichinella spiralis or T. pseudospiralis by feeding on infected carcasses of mice or by oral intubation with recovered muscle larvae. The larvae recovered from the sheep showed variable tissue distribution. The diaphragm and tongue were most affected. The viability of the recovered larvae was confirmed by successful passage in mice. The <b>reproductive</b> <b>capacity</b> of T. spiralis in sheep was {{higher than that of}} T. pseudospiralis, and also higher than its <b>reproductive</b> <b>capacity</b> in C 57 BL/ 6 J mice. The <b>reproductive</b> <b>capacity</b> of T. pseudospiralis in sheep at a lower dose was higher than that observed in mice. However at higher doses, it was significantly lower than that in mice. Therefore, it may be concluded that the sheep may be considered a suitable host for both species of Trichinella...|$|R

40|$|Given the {{rationale}} that pond systems are likely {{the most cost-effective}} system for large-scale production of P. monodon broodstock, this project aimed to determine whether pond-rearing poses a significant risk for broodstock production. The <b>gross</b> <b>reproductive</b> development of males reared in low-density broodstock ponds was found comparable to sibling males reared in controlled-environment tanks. Furthermore,none of the environmental ‘stressors’ and dietary manipulations examined impacted on male reproductive tract development. Thus, {{within the boundaries of}} the parameters tested, we can state that rearing of male broodstock in low-density ponds does not pose inherent risks of <b>gross</b> <b>reproductive</b> tract impairment. Given the typically lower costs of constructing and managing broodstock in large-scale pond systems, as compared to smaller raceway and tank systems, the incorporation of a pond-rearing phase in broodstock production could clearly increase cost-effectiveness of broodstock production at a commercial scale...|$|R

40|$|In {{the study}} of life tables, {{scientists}} usually begin with a single cohort and record survival, development, and fecundity until the death of all individuals. Because it is extremely time-consuming, the replication of life table studies is generally impractical. To estimate the variability of life table statistics, jackknife and bootstrap techniques are usually used. However, the biological meaning of these statistical procedures is not yet fully understood. In this paper, we assessed {{the use of the}} jackknife and the bootstrap in estimating the variability of the net <b>reproductive</b> rate and <b>gross</b> <b>reproductive</b> rate. Life table data for the melon fly, Bactrocera cucurbitae (Diptera: Tephritidae) reared on cucumber, sponge gourd, and carrot medium were used as examples.

40|$|The {{effects of}} molluscicides exposure, {{metaldehyde}} and niclosamide, {{on the behavior}} and <b>reproductive</b> <b>capacity</b> of Radix quadrasi was studied under laboratory conditions. R quadrasi were exposed to different concentration-rates of niclosamide: 0, 0. 045, 0. 058 and 0. 075 mg/L, and of metaldehyde: 0, 100, 112 and 130 mg/L. The symptoms of poisoning of treated snails were observed closely throughout {{the duration of the}} experiment. Observations were made three times: at the beginning of treatment (0 hour), 12 hours, and 24 hours after exposure. The surviving R. quadrasi were maintained for one month to determine their <b>reproductive</b> <b>capacity.</b> Results indicated that there was immediate reaction of the snails to molluscicide exposure. Lower concentration-rates of molluscicide triggered water-leaving behavior. Such behavior occurred in all of the low and medium concentration-rates of niclosamide and metaldehyde, as well as in some snails from the control group. By contrast, higher concentration-rates caused almost instantaneous immobility. Niclosamide and metaldehyde also significantly reduced the <b>reproductive</b> <b>capacity</b> of R. quadrasi. The number of egg masses and eggs laid varied with the treatments. However, the incubation period of the treated eggs was not statistically different from the treated ones. This study showed that both niclosamide and metaldehyde significantly affected the behavior and <b>reproductive</b> <b>capacity</b> of the R. quadrasi.

40|$|THERE {{has been}} an {{increasing}} amount of interest in inbreeding and hybridizing chickens which has become an important phase in many poultry breeding programs. The effect of inbreeding on the <b>reproductive</b> <b>capacity</b> of chickens in-fluences the decision concerning the fol-lowing: number {{and size of the}} inbred lines, ways of testing inbred lines, rates and ultimate levels of inbreeding and eventual commercial use of the surviving lines.

On the other hand, if <b>reproductive</b> <b>capacity</b> is greatly reduced, selection within lines would be emphasized instead of selection between lines.
