5|$|As a judge, Parker was {{notable for}} {{independently}} researching each {{case that he}} heard. He was {{generally considered to be}} pro-labor and was an active supporter of social reform legislation, for example upholding a maximum-hours law as constitutional. In the 1902 decision Roberson v. Rochester Folding Box Co, Parker found against a woman whose <b>face</b> <b>had</b> been used in advertisements without her permission, ruling that this use did not violate her common law privacy rights. The decision was unpopular in the press and led to the passage of a privacy law by the New York State Legislature the following year. In the same year, Parker upheld the death sentence given to convicted murderer Martha Place, who became the first woman to be executed by electric chair.|$|E
5|$|Details of Carol's death were {{revealed}} in the post mortem. There were severe injuries to the skull, and {{it was said that}} her <b>face</b> <b>had</b> been smashed by multiple blows. It was later found in court that the murder weapon had been an ice axe. The body was found to be in a foetal position, which suggested that the body had been dealt with within a few hours of death, before rigor mortis could settle in. It has since been said that the investigators failed to acknowledge that rigor mortis passes in a 24‑to48‑hour time period, and that the body could feasibly have been trussed once rigor mortis had passed. Many unusual knots were used to tie the body, and the same knots were said to be used in Gordon Park's house and boat. This was one of the key pieces of evidence used against Gordon in the trial.|$|E
5|$|In November 2014, Adam is {{revealed}} to be recovering from multiple facial reconstruction surgeries, {{and is in the}} care of Sage Warner (Kelly Sullivan). When Adam is told of Chelsea and Billy's new relationship, he attempts to leave his current dwelling, with Sage assuring him that he is not ready and that any attempt to leave would only compromise the progress of the surgeries he'd recently had. Adam eventually recovers enough to have the bandages removed from his face; after the bandages are removed it {{is revealed}} that his <b>face</b> <b>had</b> been replaced by Gabriel Bingham; the man who died saving Adam's life, he returns to Genoa City with Sage, he comes across the people he knows, but none of them recognize Adam or get the feeling that they know him somehow. Adam, under the alias of Gabriel, would pose as being married to Sage, in a ruse to claim Gabe's inheritance from Constance, however, they would later divorce in April 2015. He would reconnect with Chelsea, whom he confessed his true identity, and would slowly begin to piece their life back together, with plans to relocate to Paris, until Victor stepped in to sue for custody of Connor, keeping them in Genoa City. In October 2015, Adam's true identity was revealed and would help Sage deliver his nephew in Chancellor Park, following a heated confrontation between the two. Adam would stand trial for his role in Delia's death. He was sentenced for ten years, and upon leaving the courthouse, was run over by an unknown assailant. Christine found out that the car is found at the south lake motel. The car was found out to be a rental and Kevin found a surveillance picture that showed that Chloe was behind the pedal to the metal. Adam regains consciousness after the surgery, and expresses no ill will towards Chloe.|$|E

25|$|By {{the time}} Pre-Millennium Tension was {{released}} in 1996, Tricky was increasingly irritated with the press, particularly articles written in The Face magazine.

25|$|On {{the morning}} of July 15, 1982, gravedigger George Kise {{discovered}} the body of Princess Doe {{in the rear of}} Cedar Ridge Cemetery in Blairstown, New Jersey. The body was found lying on its back just over a steep bank that leads to a creek below. The victim's <b>face</b> <b>had</b> been beaten beyond recognition with a yet-to-be-determined object. Due to the condition of her body, her eye color could not be discerned.|$|E
25|$|In 1994, {{the mayor}} of Conteville in Normandy, André Dubreuil, noted that during land {{rehabilitation}} of the old quarry of Pierre de Caen, dinosaur bones had surfaced. He secured a partial skull and some ribs and notified the Paris Muséum national d'Histoire naturelle. However, professional excavations only started in 1998 when the rock of the collapsed quarry <b>face</b> <b>had</b> already been spread by a bulldozer over a considerable surface. It proved necessary to dig up and sieve many cubic metres of rubble over several years, ultimately salvaging about two thousand bone fragments, varying in size between one and ten centimetres. From these scraps a more complete skeleton had to be reassembled.|$|E
25|$|On 10 September 1990, the IRA {{attempted}} to kill Air Chief Marshal Sir Peter Terry at his Staffordshire home. Terry {{had been a}} prime target since his days as Governor of Gibraltar, where he signed the documents allowing the SAS to pursue IRA members. The attack took place at 9pm at the Main Road house. The gunman opened fire through a window hitting Sir Peter at least nine times and injuring his wife near one of her eyes. The couple's daughter {{was found to be}} suffering from shock. Terry's <b>face</b> <b>had</b> to be rebuilt as the shots shattered his face and two high-velocity bullets were within millimetres of his brain.|$|E

25|$|Princess Doe is {{the name}} given to an {{unidentified}} homicide victim found in Blairstown, New Jersey, United States, in 1982. The body was a young white female {{between the ages of}} 15 and 20, although she has also been stated to be as young as 14. Her <b>face</b> <b>had</b> been bludgeoned beyond recognition. The approximate height of the victim was 5 feet 2 inches (157 cm) and her weight was 110lbs (50 kg). The body was discovered at the Cedar Ridge Cemetery in Blairstown early on the morning of 15 July 1982. She was the first unidentified decedent to be entered in the National Crime Information Center.|$|E
25|$|While {{his sexual}} {{orientation}} {{was known to}} friends, colleagues and constituents, in 1987 the News of the World ran an issue that attempted to 'out' Mandelson as gay. Mandelson preferred to keep his personal life private, and did not respond. In 1998, again, Mandelson was outed by Matthew Parris in 1998 on the BBC programme Newsnight. This led to press harassment of his partner, Reinaldo Avila da Silva, with the Daily Express sending a reporter {{to take pictures of}} him while he was at his languages course. An internal investigation later found that the photos had been obtained without Avila da Silva's consent, and images of him attempting to cover his <b>face</b> <b>had</b> been secretly deleted.|$|E
25|$|In 1933, the National Park Service took Mount Rushmore {{under its}} jurisdiction. Julian Spotts {{helped with the}} project by {{improving}} its infrastructure. For example, he had the tram upgraded so it could reach the top of Mount Rushmore for the ease of workers. By July 4, 1934, Washington's <b>face</b> <b>had</b> been completed and was dedicated. The face of Thomas Jefferson was dedicated in 1936, and the face of Abraham Lincoln was dedicated on September 17, 1937. In 1937, a bill was introduced in Congress to add the head of civil-rights leader Susan B. Anthony, but a rider was passed on an appropriations bill requiring federal funds be used to finish only those heads {{that had already been}} started at that time. In 1939, the face of Theodore Roosevelt was dedicated.|$|E

25|$|Milivi Adams was a {{girl from}} Vieques who {{developed}} and died of cancer and became a symbol {{in the battle against}} the presence of the military. Her <b>face</b> <b>had</b> appeared many times on the covers of Puerto Rican newspapers and magazines, and there were posters with her picture on them on many of Vieques' street corners. The daughter of Zuleyka Calderon and Jose Adams, Milivi was diagnosed with cancer at the age of two years. Although many people blamed the military's bomb testings in Vieques as the source of her cancer, this has not been proven. Given a month to live at the age of three, her cancer went into remission, but at the age of four reappeared, in her brain. She was flown to the United States by her parents, in hopes that treatment would help her; she fought infections, and after the last one, doctors told her parents that her body would not resist another infection treatment. She returned to Puerto Rico, where she died on the morning of November17, 2002.|$|E
25|$|Between 5 and 8 March, {{police would}} find six further bodies of young females at 25 Cromwell Street. Each victim had been {{extensively}} mutilated, and each body bore evidence {{of having been}} subjected to extreme sexual abuse prior to the act of murder. For example, the third set of remains discovered in the cellar was found with a length of cloth wrapped around the skull, and an oval of adhesive tape 16 inches in circumference found with the remains had likely been used to gag this victim, whose ankles and wrists were also bound with a large section of rope. Also found in this grave was a large, serrated knife. The second set of remains was found with a section of tubing twisted into a U-shape alongside her severed limbs, and her skull was found encased in adhesive tape which had been wrapped around the section where her <b>face</b> <b>had</b> been 11 or 12 times, with a narrow plastic tube inserted where the nasal cavities had been in an obvious effort to facilitate her breathing prior to her murder. Each set of remains was missing numerous bones, particularly phalange bones, although when questioned as to this ominous paradigm, Fred refused to divulge the reason or whereabouts of the bones missing from each set of remains.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, {{a team of}} {{scientists}} examined numerous points among the feathers of an extremely well preserved Anchiornis specimen in the Beijing Museum of Natural History to survey the distribution of melanosomes, the pigment cells that give feathers their color. By studying the types of melanosomes and comparing them with those of modern birds, the scientists were able to map the specific colors and patterning present on this Anchiornis when it was alive. Though this technique had been used and described for isolated bird feathers and portions of other dinosaurs (such as the tail of Sinosauropteryx), Anchiornis became the first Mesozoic dinosaur for which almost the entire life coloration was known (note that the tail of this specimen was not preserved). The study found that most of the body feathers of this Anchiornis specimen were gray and black. The crown feathers were mainly rufous with a gray base and front, and the <b>face</b> <b>had</b> rufous speckles among predominantly black head feathers. The forewing and hindwing feathers were white with black tips. The coverts (shorter feathers covering the bases of the long wing feathers) were gray, contrasting the mainly white main wings. The larger coverts of the wing were also white with gray or black tips, forming rows of darker dots along mid-wing. These took the form of dark stripes or even rows of dots on the outer wing (primary feather coverts) but a more uneven array of speckles on the inner wing (secondary coverts). The shanks of the legs were gray other than the long hindwing feathers, and the feet and toes were black.|$|E
