It operated 2,840 stores in Germany with an approximate 27,000 employees and about 1,200 stores {{in several other}} European countries. The retail model was to sell low-cost groceries with no expense incurred for display or marketing of products. Groceries were stored in the <b>shipping</b> <b>cartons</b> they came in, rather than being stacked on shelves. In German advertising, the name [...] "Plus" [...] {{was used as a}} backronym for [...] "Prima leben und sparen" [...] (approximately [...] "top-notch living and saving"), featuring animated [...] "little prices" [...] (also sold as plush puppets) as their mascot.|$|R
5000|$|Within {{months of}} the No Name launch, Loblaw opened a {{prototype}} No Frills store in East York. Also known as a 'box store,' since items were not individually shelved but left in their cardboard <b>shipping</b> <b>cartons,</b> usually with the front cut away, the new store advertised [...] "the lowest overall prices in Toronto." [...] Though customers had to pack their own groceries, bring their own bags or pay 3cent apiece, and contend with a limited selection of only 500 items, shoppers crowded the store on opening day. [...] Customers gave up other standardconveniences, such as full-service meat or dairy departments, sincerefrigeration units had been removed to cut costs. In spite of the limited selection and minimal service, the first No Frills store proved a success and within months the company converted two more Loblaws locations to the new deep discount format.|$|R

This thesis suggests a novel means of solving these problems involving the precise measurement of signals whose wavelengths are comparable {{to the size of a}} building. It is shown that this "mid-field" frequency regime can provide useful propagation characteristics with very little fixed infrastructure. Using a wavelength of 150 m, over 4000 amplitude and differential carrier phase measurements were taken in the Wiesner Building. Least-squares power law fits to that data over paths of up to 30 m yield meter-class position estimates at 1 KHz acquisition rates. The contributions of this thesis include detailed indoor propagation measurements, as well as candidate empirical and theoretical models for that data. (cont.) Additionally, new types of high precision measurement instrumentation and high efficiency RF power amplifiers have been created to enable these measurements. by Matthew Stephen Reynolds. Thesis (Ph.

5000|$|Months earlier, Loblaw had {{successfully}} launched {{a line of}} generic products called [...] "No Name" [...] that consisted of 16 unbranded items in very basic yellow and black packaging. The new line was promoted as offering savings of between 10 and 40 percent over comparable national brands. [...] As No Name sales exceeded the company’s own projections, Loblaws Supermarkets president Dave Nichol predicted the day when “limited line stores” would offer a complete assortment of No Name groceries [...] While the first No Frills (originally branded no frills) featured the new generic product line, most items were still national brands. Though the European model typically offered dry goods, Loblaw promoted “fresh produce at the lowest possible price” [...] {{as a way of}} attracting customers.In order to reduce costs as much as possible, No Frills customers had to forego some of the conveniences that North American supermarket shoppers had come to expect. Customers were required to pack their own groceries as well as bring their own shopping bags or pay three cents for each. Whereas shopping carts are unlocked at Loblaws stores, No Frills locations require the deposit of a coin for unlocking, reducing the number of stray carts in parking lots and the amount of labour required to retrieve them. The prototype store had only four checkout counters and operated on a “low labour” principle of minimal staffing. [...] Product displays were purely functional with items left in their cardboard boxes with the front cut away. Produce, normally washed and stacked, was left unwashed in its <b>shipping</b> <b>carton.</b> The original store did not offer fresh meat since refrigeration units had been removed in order to cut costs and instead of the 8,000 items normally carried by the average supermarket, only 500 were available, usually represented by one brand and in only one size. Instead of each item individually marked, prices were displayed overhead and customers provided with a price list. Cashiers, who underwent three weeks of training, were required to memorize all prices throughout the store. Meanwhile, Loblaws president Dave Nichol promoted the minimalism of the new operations as a way to save money in a difficult economy. “We took all the frills out. We think Canadians are ready for a little belt tightening.” ...|$|R

5|$|In Pennsylvania, washed-out {{rail lines}} {{prevented}} operation along the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad for several weeks, and lines reopened after about two months. The expense of reopening, {{and the loss}} of being closed, led to the railroad merging with the Erie Railroad to become the Erie Lackawanna Railway in 1960. One stranded train along the line prompted a helicopter to rescue 235people. Flooding along the Lehigh River destroyed 15industrial plants, which left more than 15,000people near Allentown, Pennsylvania without work temporarily. The mayor of Scranton {{declared a state of emergency}} due to the floods, ordering all businesses to close. United States Army soldiers provided water to residents after the town lost its water supply. Elsewhere, the Pennsylvania National Guard was on duty on streets in damaged towns, including 50 to prevent looting in Upper Black Eddy, which was one of the hardest hit towns. Helicopters assisted in discovering bodies at Camp Davis, where many deaths occurred during the storm. Statewide, thousands of people were left homeless. In Stroudsburg, there was a food shortage, and officials enacted a curfew, after reports of looting. In the same city, water was <b>shipped</b> in milk <b>cartons</b> to the flood victims, which later inspired a Federal Civil Defense Administration proposal to use water packaged in milk containers in the event of a nuclear attack. The state government implemented a tax on cigarettes to help pay for storm damage, which lasted for about two years; this was partially due to a lack of significant funding from the federal government. Pennsylvania also enacted an increase in the gasoline tax that was later made permanent to pay for the Interstate Highway System. The two taxes, each an increase of 1penny, totaled $71million, a part of which was set aside for future disasters. The experience of the storm's aftermath provided the basis for the aftermath for Hurricane Agnes in 1972. In New Jersey, Governor Robert B.

40|$| {{attempt was}} made in the present study to {{establish}} the resting levels for the physiological variables surveyed. In a number of experiments, "control" groups have been studied and used as reference points to monitor changes accompanying exposure to a range of environmental conditions. The data pertaining to these different groups revealed a variability for most of the variables surveyed, suggesting that it would be hazardous to assume that these animals were undisturbed and to state with confidence that the values recorded for the variables surveyed would represent resting levels. The physiological responses of lobsters subjected to chilling procedures was investigated and significant physiological changes were identified. Short chilling procedures (3 and 6 min) were conducive of a dramatic reduction of the behavioural responses to handling, a reduction in pH values ranging between 0. 13 and 0. 24 of a unit, a rise in haemolymph lactate concentration by 1 to 2. 6 mmol L(subscript) - 1, a 20 to 100 % increase in haemolymph glucose titre, a 35 to 75 % decrease in phosphagen concentration. Extending the chilling period for up to 24 hrs resulted in a progressive return to control levels for most of the physiological variables surveyed. However, physiological signs of disturbance remained perceptible between 2 to 15 hours, as demonstrated by elevated lactate concentrations, lowered ATP and AP concentrations and lowered ATP/ADP values. Lobster body core temperature (CBT) reduction resulting from immersion in chilled water suggested that limited cooling ++effects were achieved by using the standard chilling procedures currently used by the WRL industry. Using "A" size lobsters (395 - 453 gr), a reduction of the CBT by 0. 5 to 0. 8 degrees celsius was recorded after 1 and 3 min immersion in 12 degrees celsius water, highlighting the limited low temperature effect exerted by these procedures in lowering the overall temperature of the mass of the product to be packed into export cartons. A study of the general physiological responses of lobsters to simulated live transport conditions in export cartons was conducted, investigating the effects of the period spent by the animals in export cartons, the effects of environmental temperature and the impact of chilling regimes. No {{attempt was made}} to duplicate exactly the conditions of <b>cartons</b> <b>shipped</b> overseas, that is carted by trucks to the airport and then transported by air to foreign markets. This study revealed that during the first 4 hours of transit, the animals exhibited physiological changes probably related to delayed responses to handling, disturbance and chilling procedures, as demonstrated by a decline in pH (0. 1 to 0. 3 of a unit), a rise in haemolymph ammonia (0. 5 to 1 mmol L(subscript) - 1) and glucose (0. 5 mmol L(subscript) - 1) titres, an increase in muscle lactate concentration (0. 5 to 1 mu mol g(subscript) - 1, a decrease in ATP concentration (1. 5 mu mol g(subscript) - 1, and a partial replenishment of the phosphagen reserve. These changes were less pronounced for those lobsters which underwent intermediate (30 min) chilling treatments. The subsequent periods (to 48 hours) were characterised, for all the treatments, by a rise in lactate concentration in the muscle tissues, this response being delayed for those lobsters which underwent a " 6 min" or " 30 min" chilling treatment. The data suggested that moderate changes in haemolymph lactate titre resulted from the increase ++in muscle lactate concentration, up to values ranging between 6 and 8 mu mol g(subscript) - 1, beyond which levels, haemolymph lactate rose dramatically, to reach values up to 19. 98 mmol L(subscript) - 1. The ATP concentration remained relatively constant up to 18 - 26 hours, after which a steep decline was recorded to reach values below or close to 4 mu mol g(subscript) - 1 after 42 hours, suggesting that the adenylate pool was maintained, probably through aerobic and anaerobic pathways of energy generation and by the "buffering" role played by the phosphagen reserve. After 24 to 36 hours, all the lobsters exhibited signs of energy depletion, as demonstrated by the changes in ATP/ADP ratio. A concomitant increase in lactate ion concentration and a decrease in haemolymph glucose titre was recorded, suggesting that anaerobic metabolism had become the major component of energy production. Simultaneously, a marked increase in the internal carton temperature was identified, which probably induced an increase in the metabolic rate of the lobsters. This "temperature effect" was delayed for up to 32 - 38 hrs transit, for those lobsters which underwent intermediate (30 min) and extended (24 hrs) chilling treatments. The changes in haemolymph pH and calcium titre suggest that the initial decline in pH identified at the completion of the first 4 hours of transit was, at least partially, compensated after 26 - 32 hours. A 30 to 40 % increase in haemolymph calcium titre was recorded after 4 hours of transit, suggesting that bicarbonate ions were released in order to buffer the pH of the haemolymph. However, a decrease in pH (0. 1 to 0. 3 of a unit) was recorded during the subsequent periods suggesting that the bicarbonate buffering capacity did not suffice to match the recorded massive rise in lactate titre. By extending the duration of the chilling procedures and by using refrigerated ++material (wood-shaving fillers, ice-bottles), lower temperatures were achieved inside the packaging cartons and these were maintained for longer periods of transit (up to 20 hours), delaying the effect of the external environment on the temperature changes recorded inside the cartons and the concomitant metabolic responses of the animals. This effect was also achieved by maintaining the cartons in controlled temperature environments ([less than] 20 degrees celsius) and, to a lesser extent, by improving the insulation capacity of the polystyrene cartons. This study constitutes an overview of the physiological responses of Panulirus cygnus to post-harvest handling procedures currently used by the WRL industry. It revealed that an improved return for the Industry could be achieved by reducing the debilitating effects exerted on the lobsters by handling, exposure to air and elevated environmental temperature. It provides direction for future research, aimed at improving the quality and hence, the financial return in the live export of WRL...|$|R
