40|$|The Piano Key Weir (PKW) is a {{new type}} of <b>free</b> <b>weir,</b> similar to a {{labyrinth}} weir, showing appealing performance to release high discharges under limited head levels in the upstream reservoir. Because of the PKW geometric specificities, its hydraulic capacity remains difficult to predict without using experimental techniques. Wolf 1 D PKW numerical model has been developed at the Research Unit HACH at the University of Liege to model the flow over a PKW. It is based on a 1 D modelling of the PKW main elements separately (the inlet and the outlet), with a single upstream reservoir and interactions between both flows by exchange of mass and momentum along the lateral crest...|$|E
40|$|Within the {{framework}} of updating the release and storage capacities of existing reservoirs, the use of piano key weirs (PKW) can be an interesting alternative either to increase the discharge of a <b>free</b> <b>weir</b> without changing the weir width on the dam crest nor the reservoir level, or to increase the threshold reservoir level before releasing water while keeping the weir width {{and the level of}} safety. Results of first experiments on scale models have shown the high efficiency of PKW in terms of discharge capacity. But, even if PKW projects start to be developed on real structures, lacks persist in the understanding of the flow behavior on this new type of weir, in the characterization of their hydraulic potential and in the availability of design guidelines. This paper presents the results of several research projects, based on both numerical and physical modeling, carried out on this topic at the Laboratory of Engineering Hydraulics of the University of Liege. The researches rely on physical experiments on scale models of idealized PKW elements or real structures, as well as on numerical modeling with specifically developed solvers. The paper presents an overview of these projects, emphasizing the most important results regarding PKW design and performance. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The present {{research}} follows {{a previous study}} led by Erpicum et al. in 20112. The main {{purpose of this study}} is to affirm by experiments the theory, which states that in some particular cases, using a piano key weir (PKW) at the top of a stepped spillway instead of a standard ungated spillway with an equal length would result in an increased dissipation of energy. Another way to present this theory is to show that specific geometrical dimensions of the piano key weir can be determined to reach an uniform flow for reduced dimensions of stepped spillways (compared to standard ungated weir). The second goal is to set up analytical methods enabling the evaluation of the energy dissipation on this kind of construction using basic data’s (ex. inclination and geometry of the spillway, geometry of the steps on the spillway, flow,…). In order to reach those objectives, a series of experiments has been executed on a facility at the HECE laboratory. The tests allowed us to acquire different hydraulic parameters that have been used to calculate the energy dissipation on the reduced bench test. It is important to notice that we used an experimental analyzing method for signals. First of all, we have been able to prove the validity of the initial theory using the results of the tests on the facility. Secondly, the analyze and interpretation of the results led us to define criteria’s indicating the apparition of the uniform or non uniform flow depending of the kind of weir used on the spillway. Finally, using the results of the tests we established some analytical formulas for each kind of flow on a <b>free</b> <b>weir</b> and a PKW. Those analytical formulas present a correlation with experiments moreless accurate depending on the interpolation choosen and the set of bench tests realized...|$|E

To evaluate the stability and safety of the structure, {{it is necessary to}} ascertain the shape and dimensions of the scour generated downstream from the dam. We studied the scour, due to the operation of the free surface spillway (700 m 3 /s) and half-height outlets (1760 m 3 /s), with three complementary procedures: empirical formulae obtained in models and prototypes, semi-empirical methodology based on pressure fluctuations-erodibility index and computational fluid dynamics simulations. The <b>free</b> surface <b>weir</b> could generate a scour around 21 m, while the intermediate outlet could reach the intact rock, located 34 m below the initial river bed.

30|$|MNPs can induce toxicity, {{not only}} by {{activating}} cells in a direct way as discussed above, but also indirectly by excessive tissue accumulation of <b>free</b> metal ions (<b>Weir</b> et al. 1984). It was shown that reactive oxygen species (ROS) are generated by the cells {{as a result of}} leached ions after exposure to an acidic environment, such as lysosomes (pH 4.5) (Albrecht et al. 2004). In general, most cells can tolerate a certain amount of ROS, whereas higher levels of ROS persist over a longer time and may result in cell damage and subsequent induction of toxic effects (Wang et al. 2007). Since the toxicity of the NPs is affected by the level of induced ROS, the surface must be stable against degradation to limit the quantity of free metal ions.|$|R

The same architect designed a smaller flint and brick chapel at Gloucester Place in 1904; its symmetrical façade was spoiled by wartime bomb damage to the miniature flanking towers. Strict Baptists meet at the starkly plain Neoclassical Galeed Chapel (1868). Methodist church designs include Romanesque Revival (the Grade II-listed Hove Methodist Church, by John Wills in 1895 and featuring a prominent rose window), Early English Gothic Revival (E.J.

The first boat was launched on the Torrens Lake by Gordon Watts in 1935. It was a 25 ft boat, built {{on the banks of the}} Torrens to hold up to 20 passengers and named Popeye 1. Watts purchased a former Glenelg cruise boat in 1948 and placed it in service as Popeye 2. Over the next two years three new jarrah hulled boats were built at Port Adelaide; carrying 40 passengers each they were numbered Popeye 3 through Popeye 5. Trips on the Popeyes from Elder Park to the zoo became a treasured family outing and the boats hosted weddings and other events. In March 1962 Keith Altman, owner of riverside eatery [...] "Jolley's Boathouse", took over the Popeyes and introduced recreational paddle boats to the river. The Popeyes had a brush with royalty in March 1977 with Popeye 5 ferrying Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip followed by a choir in Popeye 4. Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser officially launched three new fibreglass models named Popeyes I, II and III in 1982 as the wooden boats' replacements.|$|R
40|$|Gradually {{expanding}} {{channels and}} abrupt enlargement channels are integrated as expanding channels. Aiming at the energy dissipation efficiency {{difference between the}} two channels, this study proceeds <b>free</b> overfall through <b>weir</b> channel tests to verify the theoretical formulas of conjugate depth ratio ϕ, relative energy loss ∆E/E_i and energy dissipation efficiency of free overfall hydraulic jump η. Forty eight sets of experiments with various weir height(H_d= 14. 2 ~ 52. 5 cm), weir width(b= 5 ~ 18. 2 cm), and unit flow discharge (q= 0. 00632 ~ 0. 0717 cms/m) are conducted to verify the theory. Sensitivity analysis for the effects among various hydraulic parameters are also performed. Finally, three cases are selected to illustrate {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} the energy dissipation of expanding channels, which can be used as references for engineering design. In terms of sensitivity analyses, the conjugate depth ratio ϕ and side pressure correction factor C_p of gradually expanding channels are more affected by the channel width ratio μ before and after hydraulic jump, with positive and negative correlations, respectively. The Froude number at the beginning of hydraulic jump F_i appears to have a larger effect on the conjugate depth ratio ϕ of abrupt enlargement channels, showing positive correlation. Relative energy losses ∆E⁄E_i for both channels are highly affected by the Froude number at the beginning of hydraulic jump F_i, presenting positive correlation. The relative water depth at the beginning of jump ψ affects the energy dissipation efficiency of free overfall hydraulic jump η the most, revealing positive correlation. Moreover, from the case studies, abrupt enlargement channels present better energy dissipation efficiency than gradually expanding channels do. However, the engineering design of abrupt enlargement channels requires a larger hinterland. That the design of gradually expanding channels could be utilized to achieve an optimal energy dissipation efficiency. 漸擴形渠道及突擴形渠道合稱為變擴形渠道，本文旨在探討此兩種不同渠道形式之消能效益差異。藉由理論推導獲致共軛水深比ϕ、相對能量損失∆E/E_i及投潭水躍消能效益η等理論式，並配合堰壩投潭渠槽試驗，分別改變堰壩高度(H_d= 14. 2 ~ 52. 5 cm) 、堰壩寬度(b= 5 ~ 18. 2 cm) ，以及單寬流量(q= 0. 00632 ~ 0. 0717 cms/m) ，共進行 48 組試驗以驗證之。文中同時以敏感度分析各項水力參數間影響程度，進而分別舉三案例說明變擴形渠道投潭消能之優劣，以期做為工程設計上一項參考依據。 依敏感度分析結果，獲致漸擴形渠道中共軛水深比(ϕ) 及側壓力修正係數(C_p) 受水躍後前渠道寬度比(μ) 影響較大，且分別為正相關及負相關。突擴形渠道共軛水深比(ϕ) 受躍前福祿數(F_i) 影響較大，屬正相關。兩者之相對能量損失(∆E⁄E_i) 皆受躍前福祿數(F_i) 影響較大，呈正相關；投潭水躍消能效益(η) 則受相對躍前水深(ψ) 之影響最大，亦呈正相關。由案例說明發現突擴形渠道較漸擴形渠道有較佳之消能效果，若受限於工程現地之環境，可改選用漸擴形渠道設計，以達綜合之最佳消能效果。誌謝 [...] .
