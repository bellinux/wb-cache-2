40|$|The paper {{highlights}} the importance of successful financial performance for companies, and provides for a brief review of foreign expert opinions on the most important factors that influence the financial performance of enterprises. Linear and quadratic discriminate analyses and a logistic regression analysis were applied to a sample file of 233 annual data from 3 countries (Czech Republic, Slovak Republic, Ukraine) for a period of 2008 - 2012 concerning quarries extracting building materials. These methods provided for distributing the sample file quarries into two classes of profitable and loss-making enterprises. Their financial performance had been known, which enabled to assess the classification accuracy of individual method applications. The average classification accuracy was about 86 % and {{there were no significant differences}} in the specific method applications. The linear discriminate analysis calculations are the simplest ones in comparison with two other applied methods. The linear discriminate analysis also made possible to identify the most influential discriminators that contributed to the classification into the specific groups.

40|$|ABSTRACT OBJECTIVE To {{estimate}} the investments to implement and operational {{costs of a}} type I Oral Health Care Team in the Family Health Care Strategy. METHODS This is an economic assessment study, for analyzing the investments and operational costs of an oral health care team {{in the city of}} Salvador, BA, Northeastern Brazil. The amount worth of investments for its implementation was obtained by summing up the investments in civil projects and shared facilities, in equipments, furniture, and instruments. Regarding the operational costs, the 2009 - 2012 time series was analyzed and the month of December 2012 was adopted for assessing the monetary values in effect. The costs were classified as <b>direct</b> <b>variable</b> <b>costs</b> (consumables) and direct fixed costs (salaries, maintenance, equipment depreciation, instruments, furniture, and facilities), besides the indirect fixed costs (cleaning, security, energy, and water). The Ministry of Health&# 8217;s share in funding was also calculated, and the factors that influence cost behavior were described. RESULTS The investment to implement a type I Oral Health Care Team was R$ 29, 864. 00 (US$ 15, 236. 76). The operational costs of a type I Oral Health Care Team were around R$ 95, 434. 00 (US$ 48, 690. 82) a year. The Ministry of Health&# 8217;s financial incentives for investments accounted for 41. 8 % of the implementation investments, whereas the municipality contributed with a 59. 2 % share of the total. Regarding operational costs, the Ministry of Health contributed with 33. 1 % of the total, whereas the municipality, with 66. 9 %. Concerning the operational costs, the element of heaviest weight was salaries, which accounted for 84. 7 %. CONCLUSIONS Problems with the regularity in the supply of inputs and maintenance of equipment greatly influence the composition of costs, besides reducing the supply of services to the target population, which results in the service probably being inefficient.

40|$|This paper {{gives an}} {{overview}} of the position and functions of the Estonian ‘lad mag” Di, and most of all focuses on the economic aspects of the aforementioned. In order to do that, one needs to give a brief overview of the typology and the historical development of the genre of men’s magazines and their in the world and in Estonia more precisely. A posteriori the market situation and the business models of Di and Estonian magazines' market is analyzed. The thesis ends with estimation of the market policies and the evaluation of future perspectives of the magazine Di First men´s magazines were founded {{at the end of the}} 17 th century. One of the first ones was The Gentleman`s Journal, that was first published in 1692. Despite the fact that early men’s magazines like The Gentleman´s Magazine and Blackwood´s Magazine circled in high-class men’s clubs already in the 19 th century, the origin of men’s magazines does not go back very far. Most of the early men’s magazines simply focused on masculine interests like photography and film, sports and cars and the emphasis on masculinity was absent - it was taken self-evident. One of the most important predecessors of today’s men’s magazines was Esquire which was founded in USA in the 1930 ’s and focused primarily on male readers’ interests. The niche of men’s magazines in the journalism market started to develop fast in the 1990 ’s. Their sales increased rapidly between 1991 and 1996 : the growth was a whole 400 percent. Men’s magazines can be divided as follows: 1. general male audience magazines, 2. sports magazines, 3. ‘lad mags’, 4. skin magazines, 5. gay lifestyle magazines, 6. gay pornographic magazines, 7. ethnic men’s magazines. Estonian scene of men’s magazines is shaped by the following: 1. Maarja/Maaja (skin magazine, 1989 - [...] .), 2. Mees (general male audience magazine, 1995 - 1997), 3. Diivan-Di (‘lad mag’, 1996 - [...] .), 4. Mees ja Maailm: M (general male audience magazine, October-December 2001), 5. Eeva, Lilith, Lilith Hard, Tabu, Pille (skin magazines, 2001 - 2005), 6. For Him Magazine Eesti (lad mag, 2004 - [...] .). The business model of magazine Di can be shortly described as follows: Costs - <b>direct</b> <b>variable</b> <b>costs</b> (2, 1 million EEK in 2005); direct fixed costs (1, 4 million EEK); direct general costs (71 000 EEK); indirect general costs (755 000 EEK). Producing resources and bases - editorial rooms shared by the personal and assistant personal of 9 magazines, workers’ experience, publisher’s know-how, relationships with partners. Material and immaterial basic property - 460 728 EEK and 327 549 EEK at the end of 2004. Business activities - compilation and subscribing materials, ad-sales, making up and printing materials, distribution, marketing Distribution resources - long term relations with Eesti Post Creating content - editorial staff (3 - 4 people, photographer, several co-workers) Structure of business - board, management, editorial stuff, assistant stuff Additional financing - firms publications earning profits, loans from owners, raising equity Aim of the magazine - to create an entertainment magazine for men Target audience - 20 - 40 years old men, whose income and education are above the average How does magazine differentiate from others - contains only domestic materials Profits - to owners, to investments Essential aim - stability of format (arrogant, masculine, entertaining) Possible "bottlenecks" - new competitors, modern technologies, limited availableness of specific ads Possible changes - new competitors (development of modern technologies), demand for new investments Profits - stable selling of ads The business model of Di`s internet-version is rather undeveloped, product has just a short webpage, that contains no ads except self-promotion Several aspects characteristic to magazines’ business models, portrayed by Picard (2003) based on the magazine market in the USA, were in accordance with the Estonian market and Di’s business model. Yet, some points did not coincide. From this, one can draw the conclusion that the aforementioned business model is applied only partially. This means that lots of changes of characteristics is yet to come. The domain of advertising in Di was rather unstable during the year 2005. The difference between ad revenues in January and May was 23 -fold. Therefore, the magazine should concentrate more on continuous creation and development of additional values and trying to expand the target-group. Selling ads should be more stable and disjointed. Most of Di`s readers are permanent-readers but not disjointed readers. Several readers found that Di`s best features are: domestic materials, high-quality text- and photo materials. As Di has positioned itself as a domestic quality-entertainment magazine, the readers have noticed it and the magazine’s conception works. Brief readers-study also found, that marketing and promotion of the magazine does not work as well as it should. About 25 % of Di’s readers are its subscribers. Magazine’s publisher should raise marketing costs and try to increase the number of subscribers. Most of Di’s readers found that the price of the magazine is not high - when necessary, it could be raised. The web page of the magazine needs thorough development, because lots of the readers have never even heard about it or find it empty. The development of the internet environment should be one of the magazine’s priorities, especially when concidering the threats of the modern technologies...|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION Dexmedetomidine {{was shown}} in two European {{randomized}} double-blind double-dummy trials (PRODEX and MIDEX) to be non-inferior to propofol and midazolam in maintaining target sedation levels in mechanically ventilated intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Additionally, dexmedetomidine shortened the time to extubation versus both standard sedatives, suggesting that it may reduce ICU resource needs and thus lower ICU costs. Considering resource utilization data from these two trials, we performed a secondary, cost-minimization analysis assessing the economics of dexmedetomidine versus standard care sedation. METHODS The total ICU costs associated with each study sedative were calculated {{on the basis of}} total study sedative consumption and the number of days patients remained intubated, required non-invasive ventilation, or required ICU care without mechanical ventilation. The daily unit costs for these three consecutive ICU periods were set to decline toward discharge, reflecting the observed reduction in mean daily Therapeutic Intervention Scoring System (TISS) points between the periods. A number of additional sensitivity analyses were performed, including one in which the total ICU costs were based on the cumulative sum of daily TISS points over the ICU period, and two further scenarios, with declining <b>direct</b> <b>variable</b> daily <b>costs</b> only. RESULTS Based on pooled data from both trials, sedation with dexmedetomidine resulted in lower total ICU costs than using the standard sedatives, with a difference of € 2, 656 in the median (interquartile range) total ICU costs-€ 11, 864 (€ 7, 070 to € 23, 457) versus € 14, 520 (€ 7, 871 to € 26, 254) -and € 1, 649 in the mean total ICU costs. The median (mean) total ICU costs with dexmedetomidine compared with those of propofol or midazolam were € 1, 292 (€ 747) and € 3, 573 (€ 2, 536) lower, respectively. The result was robust, indicating lower costs with dexmedetomidine in all sensitivity analyses, including those in which only <b>direct</b> <b>variable</b> ICU <b>costs</b> were considered.

We developed a Pulmonologist-led Chronic Lung Disease Program (CLDP) for patients with severe asthma and COPD and analyzed its impact on healthcare utilization and predictors of its effectiveness. MethodsCLDP elements included clinical evaluation, onsite pulmonary function testing, health education, and self-management action plan along with close scheduled and on-demand follow-up. Patients with ≥ 2 asthma or COPD exacerbations requiring emergency room visit or hospitalization within the prior year were enrolled, and followed for respiratory related ER visits (RER) and hospitalizations (RHA) over the year (357  ±  43 days) after CLDP interventions. ResultsA total of 106 patients were enrolled, and 104 patients were subject to analyses. During the year of follow-up after CLDP enrollment, there was a significant decrease in mean RER (0. 56  ±  1. 48 versus 2. 62  ±  2. 81, p <  0. 0001), mean RHA (0. 39  ±  0. 08 versus 1. 1  ±  1. 62, p <  0. 0001), and 30 day rehospitalizations (0. 05  ±  0. 02 versus 0. 28  ±  0. 07, p <  0. 0001). Reduction of healthcare utilization was strongly associated with GERD and sinusitis therapy, and was independent of pulmonary rehabilitation. <b>Direct</b> <b>variable</b> <b>cost</b> analyses estimated annual savings at $ 1. 17 million. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed lack of spirometry utilization as an independent risk factor for severe exacerbations.

50|$|In economics, average <b>variable</b> <b>cost</b> (AVC) is a firm's <b>variable</b> <b>costs</b> (labor, electricity, etc.) {{divided by}} the {{quantity}} of output produced. <b>Variable</b> <b>costs</b> are those costs which vary with the output. where VC = <b>variable</b> <b>cost,</b> AVC = average <b>variable</b> <b>cost,</b> and Q = quantity of output produced.|$|R

30|$|More specifically, we regress the log {{of profits}} on the log of {{marginal}} <b>variable</b> <b>costs</b> year effects, firm-specific fixed effects, {{and with a}} time-varying coefficient on log <b>variable</b> <b>costs.</b> Marginal <b>variable</b> <b>costs</b> are defined as <b>variable</b> <b>costs</b> over turnover. We use information on all firms that file annual accounts for the whole year from January to December, except those firms that can be assumed not to maximise profits such as non-profit associations. We identify outliers as firms with <b>variable</b> <b>costs</b> over turnover below or above the 5 th and 95 th percentile of the distribution and we use the same criterion for profits over total assets.|$|R
50|$|Outsourcing {{a product}} or service is a method used to change the ratio of fixed <b>costs</b> to <b>variable</b> <b>costs</b> in a business. Outsourcing {{can be used to}} change the balance of this ratio by {{offering}} a move from fixed to <b>variable</b> <b>cost</b> and also by making <b>variable</b> <b>costs</b> more predictable.|$|R
50|$|The {{level of}} <b>variable</b> <b>cost</b> is {{influenced}} by many factors, such as fixed cost, duration of project, uncertainty and discount rate. An analytical formula of <b>variable</b> <b>cost</b> {{as a function of}} these factors has been derived. It can be used to assess how different factors impact <b>variable</b> <b>cost</b> and total return in an investment.|$|R
