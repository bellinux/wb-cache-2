25|$|Gastroscopy (<b>endoscopic</b> <b>examination</b> of the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum) is {{performed}} {{in patients with}} established cirrhosis to exclude the possibility of esophageal varices.

25|$|Colonoscopy is the <b>endoscopic</b> <b>examination</b> of {{the large}} {{intestine}} and the distal part of the small bowel with a CCD camera or a fiber optic camera on a flexible tube passed through the anus. It can provide a visual diagnosis (e.g. ulceration, polyps) and grants the opportunity for biopsy or removal of suspected colorectal cancer lesions. Colonoscopy can remove polyps as small as one millimetre or less. Once polyps are removed, they can be studied {{with the aid of}} a microscope to determine if they are precancerous or not. It takes 15 years or less for a polyp to turn cancerous.|$|E
40|$|Colorectal {{endoscopy}} {{is important}} for the early detection and treatment of colorectal cancer and is used worldwide. A computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system that provides an objective measure to endoscopists during colorectal <b>endoscopic</b> <b>examinations</b> would be of great value. In this study, we describe a newly developed CAD system that provides real-time objective measures. Our system captures the video stream from an endoscopic system and transfers it to a desktop computer. The captured video stream is then classified by a pretrained classifier and the results are displayed on a monitor. The experimental results show that our developed system works efficiently in actual <b>endoscopic</b> <b>examinations</b> and is medically significant. Comment: 9 pages, 8 figure...|$|R
40|$|AbstractGastrointestinal {{endoscopy}} and {{the acquisition}} of tissue samples are essential for the {{diagnosis and treatment of}} various diseases of the digestive system. However, given the differences between the recommendations and the clinical practice, the inexorable increase of requests for <b>endoscopic</b> <b>examinations</b> and the financial burden associated with it, it is crucial that we concentrate on the challenge that endoscopic biopsies represent. In this review we describe the available evidence in the literature, including the more recent published guidelines, on when or not to perform endoscopic biopsies in upper and lower endoscopy, focusing on the precise diagnosis of the most common gastrointestinal diseases that motivate <b>endoscopic</b> <b>examinations</b> and on the rational use of available resources without compromising proper management of patients...|$|R
30|$|In 22 {{patients}} {{we found}} bladder or colic wall thickening suspicious for cancer; <b>endoscopic</b> <b>examinations</b> {{were conducted in}} our hospital on nine of these cases, confirming the diagnosis of malignancy in seven patients (four bladder cell transitional carcinoma, two colorectal cancers and one prostatic cancer extended to the bladder).|$|R
25|$|If {{there is}} a {{suspicion}} of cancer, biopsy is performed, usually under general anaesthetic. This provides histological proof of cancer type and grade. If the lesion appears to be small and well localised, the surgeon may undertake excision biopsy, where an attempt is made to completely remove the tumour {{at the time of}} first biopsy. In this situation, the pathologist will not only be able to confirm the diagnosis, but can also comment on the completeness of excision, i.e., whether the tumour has been completely removed. A full <b>endoscopic</b> <b>examination</b> of the larynx, trachea, and esophagus is often performed at the time of biopsy.|$|E
25|$|EIPH is most {{commonly}} diagnosed by <b>endoscopic</b> <b>examination</b> of the trachea and larger bronchi, with the optimal timing for endoscopy being 60–90 minutes after hard exercise. This post-exercise delay allows time for blood within the lungs {{to travel to}} the trachea. Blood can usually be detected in the trachea or bronchi for 1–3 days after an episode of EIPH, but may be present for up to a week. The amount of blood visible in the trachea at the time of examination is {{most commonly}} graded on a scale of 0 (no blood) to 4 (airways awash with blood). In some mildly-affected horses, endoscopy must be performed on multiple occasions to confirm a diagnosis of EIPH.|$|E
25|$|EIPH reduces a horse's racing performance. Severe EIPH (epistaxis) shortens a horse's racing career. Moderate {{to severe}} EIPH is {{associated}} with a worsened finishing position in a race, and finishing farther behind the winner. Horses with mild EIPH earn more prize money than those with more severe EIPH. While single bouts of EIPH may not even be apparent to the rider, owner or trainer of a horse unless an <b>endoscopic</b> <b>examination</b> is undertaken, the effect on performance within a single race appears to be significant but relatively subtle. In a 2005 study, horses finishing races with grade 4 EIPH were on average 6 metres behind those finishing with grade 0. However, the effect of repeated bouts of EIPH that occur with daily training may lead to more significant changes and a greater degree of tissue damage over time with consequent loss of lung function.|$|E

2500|$|Exercise-Induced Pulmonary Hemorrhage (EIPH), {{also known}} as [...] "bleeding" [...] or a [...] "bleeding attack", refers to the {{presence}} of blood in the airways of the lung in association with exercise. EIPH is common in horses undertaking intense exercise, but it has also been reported in human athletes, racing camels and racing greyhounds. Horses that experience EIPH may also be referred to as [...] "bleeders" [...] or as having [...] "broken a blood vessel". In the majority of cases EIPH is not apparent unless an <b>endoscopic</b> <b>examination</b> of the airways is performed following exercise. However, a small proportion of horses may show bleeding at the nostrils after exercise, which is known as epistaxis.|$|E
2500|$|Unless a horse has severe EIPH, {{with blood}} {{present at the}} {{nostrils}} (known as epistaxis), the main sign is usually poor athletic performance; other signs are generally subtle and not easy to detect. Frequent swallowing and coughing in the immediate post-exercise recovery period, and poor appetite post-performance may be suggestive of EIPH. A definitive diagnosis can only be made by <b>endoscopic</b> <b>examination</b> of the trachea. In the case where no blood is visible in the trachea, EIPH in the small airways may still be present and can be confirmed by a bronchoalveolar lavage. [...] Impaired arterial blood gas (oxygen) tensions during intense exercise, increased blood lactate, and rarely death have been noted (likely due to ruptured chordae tendinae or a different mechanism of lung hemorrhage). Epistaxis is diagnosed when blood is visible at either or both nostrils during or following exercise. [...] To confirm whether the blood {{is coming from the}} upper or lower airway requires further examination by endoscopy, although in some cases {{it is not possible to}} determine the location. [...] In the majority of epistaxis cases, the blood originates from the lung. [...] Epistaxis during or following exercise can less commonly occur as a result of upper airway hemorrhage, for example following head trauma, subepiglottic cysts, atrial fibrillation, or guttural pouch mycoses.|$|E

40|$|A giant gastric angiodysplasia causing {{recurrent}} {{gastrointestinal bleeding}} {{was found in}} a 51 -year-old woman who had been treated with repeated blood transfusions for severe anemia. At first, no active bleeding source was seen on upper or lower GI endoscopy. The only abnormality found on gastroendoscopy was an irregular, flat, reddish mucosal lesion on the posterior wall of the antrum, which was mistaken for superficial gastritis. Subsequent <b>endoscopic</b> <b>examinations</b> were done because of intermittent gastrointestinal bleeding and revealed a 4 x 6 cm, irregular, mildly elevated, bright-red vascular lesion on the posterior wall of the antrum. This giant lesion had spontaneous oozing of fresh blood and was suspected to be a gastric angiodysplasia. An upper abdominal CT scan showed relative thickening of the antral wall. Because of the difficulty of treating such a large posterior antral lesion endoscopically, the patient underwent a subtotal gastrectomy. Pathologic examination revealed gastric angiodysplasia. The postoperative course was uneventful, and there was no recurrent bleeding. We present this case to remind clinicians of the importance of repeated <b>endoscopic</b> <b>examinations</b> in cases of obscure gastrointestinal bleeding, especially when active bleeding is occurring.
