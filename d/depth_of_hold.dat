60|$|The pipe palpitated as {{it further}} {{straightened}} itself, {{and now a}} hole opened in the oily water, and half-seen things {{came up with a}} rush from the <b>depths</b> <b>of</b> the flooded <b>hold.</b> Hundreds <b>of</b> little black kernels whirled and sank in the swing of the eddy, which grew wider as a deep, resonant hum descended from the deck above.

5000|$|As {{the city}} of Auckland grew, it found that well water was not sufficient.

30|$|We take an {{alternate}} approach, and describe {{in this section}} an algorithm that performs LTL trace validation on event traces directly using the MapReduce computing paradigm. The algorithm evaluates an LTL formula in an iterative fashion. At the first iteration, all the states where ground terms are true are evaluated. In the next iteration, these results are used to evaluate all subformulæ directly using one of those ground terms. More generally, {{at the end of}} iteration i of the process, the events where all subformulæ <b>of</b> <b>depth</b> i <b>hold</b> are computed. It follows that, in order to evaluate an LTL formula <b>of</b> <b>depth</b> n, the algorithm will require exactly n MapReduce cycles. Each MapReduce cycle effectively acts as a form of temporal tester [30] processing a trace made of the evaluation of lower-level testers.|$|R

The general appearance of the vessel is shown by the side elevation and plan, Figs. 1 and 4, while in Figs. 2 and 3 are given, respectively, a longitudinal section and sectional plan, which show clearly {{the arrangement of the}} torpedo machinery. The length of the vessel over all is 84 ft 2 in (25.7 m), and her length from the after edge of her stern post to the forward edge of the gate frame is 73 ft 11 in (22.5 m), while her breadth was 20 ft 8 in (6.3 m). The <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> her <b>hold</b> is 9 ft 11½ in (3.04 m), and her draft when launched with 10 tons of torpedo machinery and 2½ tons of her propelling engines on board was 4 ft. When fully equipped, this draft was increased to 7 ft 5½ in (2.27 m), and, by pumping water into compartments provided for the purpose, as will be explained presently, this draft can be increased to 9 ft 1 in (2.8 m) when the vessel is going into action. At this latter draft the water is about level with the gunwale, but, owing to the arched form of the deck, the vessel has still under such circumstances 207 tons of displacement.|$|R
