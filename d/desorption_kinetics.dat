40|$|A {{mathematical}} model utilizing ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST) and micropore size distribution (MPSD) concept {{to describe the}} adsorption equilibrium and surface energetic heterogeneity is used to predict the <b>desorption</b> and displacement <b>kinetics</b> of mixed gases in activated carbon. The model {{takes into account the}} intraparticle diffusion in both pore volume and adsorbed phase. The driving force for surface diffusion is the chemical potential gradient, and the apparent surface diffusivity {{is a function of the}} adsorbed concentration. The adsorbate-adsorbent interaction energy is related to the micropore size by the Lennard-Jones potential, and the matching energies between different species in the adsorbed phase are therefore described by this adsorbate-pore interaction mechanism in both equilibrium and diffusion of the adsorbed species. The overall adsorption isotherm and the diffusion flux of the adsorbed species are the integrals of their corresponding local values over all MPSD range accessible by the adsorbate molecules. The size exclusion effect is taken into account in the competition of the different gases for the given pore. The model parameters are obtained using only information of pure gas equilibrium and mass transfer. The model predictions are tested with the <b>desorption</b> and displacement <b>kinetics</b> data of binary gases on Ajax activated carbon and found to be in good agreement with the experimental data.

The variation of the dispersed Nb fraction and the Nb clusterization was followed by extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), while the progressive Mg nanostructuring was monitored by x-ray diffraction. The presence of vacancylike defects and their evolution was studied using positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy and Doppler broadening spectroscopies. It was found that, with successive H 2 sorption cycles: (i) the H 2 <b>desorption</b> <b>kinetics</b> progressively becomes slower until stationary conditions are reached and (ii) the Nb dopant atoms, dispersed in the nanocrystalline Mg layers, aggregate, forming nanoclusters. Our {{results show that the}} progressive Nb aggregation drives the H 2 <b>desorption</b> <b>kinetics.</b> EXAFS analysis show that fast <b>desorption</b> <b>kinetics</b> is due to the presence of small (˜ 1 nm) Nb aggregates rather than Nb atoms dispersed into the Mg matrix.

40|$|Results are {{presented}} from modeling of extensive methyl methacrylate seeded emulsion polymerization data. Both chemically initiated and γ radiolysis initiated experiments were modeled; {{in the latter}} type of experiments the system {{is removed from the}} γ-source, thereby providing kinetic data which are particularly sensitive to termination processes. While the data cannot be fitted consistently and meaningfully with conventional termination models, all are fitted in a unified way using the description of Russell et al. (Macromolecules 1992, 25, 2459). Fitting completely without adjustable parameters gives quite acceptable agreement with these sensitive experimental data, and exact accord is obtained with minor, and physically reasonable, parameter changes. The model description is applicable to free-radical polymerizations at intermediate and high conversion (i. e., above c**). Its main feature is that it takes full account of the dependence of termination rate coefficients on radical chain length, while still requiring only modest computational resources. The most important model parameters are therefore experimental diffusion coefficients for monomer as a function of weight fraction polymer, and exponents for the scaling of oligomeric and polymeric diffusion coefficients with degree of polymerization. For emulsion systems, <b>desorption</b> (exit) <b>kinetics</b> are included, and the theory of Maxwell et al. (Macromolecules 1991, 24, 1629) for the rate of chemical initiation is found to be accurate. The modeling indicates that the predominant mode of termination above c** and prior to the glass transition involves a short free radical, usually one formed by transfer, and a long entangled macroradical; above the glass transition, this dominant model involves two long entangled macroradicals encountering as a result of propagation ("reaction diffusion").

As a reference we use the CO-Oxidation between 415 - 465 K and at 1. 0 x 10 ^(- 6) mbar total pressure to identify the crucial processes in the transient and steady state oxidation behavior. These experiments provide the activation energy for the CO oxidation and <b>desorption.</b> The oxidation <b>kinetics</b> show a significant dependence on the particle size and morphology. The methanol oxidation is performed at similar conditions (425 - 465 K, 2. 0 x 10 ^(- 6) mbar). It is found that coadsorbed oxygen inhibits the dissociation of methanol. The adsorption, desorption and dissociation of methanol are systematically investigated by using thermodesorption and IR-spectroscopy between 90 - 465 K. C [...] O bond breakage and the active site of this process are identified. All experiments are supported by mean-field and Monte-Carlo simulations. The influence of defect sites on the reaction kinetics and the role of oxygen diffusion are intensely discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{interaction}} between MgH 2 and LiBH 4 was studied {{to determine the}} resultant effects on hydrogen <b>desorption</b> and absorption <b>kinetics</b> for potential use as a hydrogen storage material. It is found that the addition of LiBH 4 in small molar ratios results in improved kinetics of the same order as those observed for mechanically milled magnesium. The mixture of MgH 2 + LiBH 4 in ratios at and below 4 : 1, once reacted, is a highly reversible material at 300 °C and {{it is observed that}} the kinetics improve upon the process of hydrogen cycling. This improvement is partially attributed to a refinement in microstructure that results in highly porous particle agglomerates and it is this feature that is likely to have a large effect on the kinetics of hydrogenation due to the rate limiting step of the reaction being hydrogen diffusion into the particles of Mg which can be coated in MgH 2 phase, through which H 2 does not diffuse easily. Additionally it is observed via Raman spectroscopy that a new bonding structure exists in the H 2 cycled mixture after desorption which might improve the rehydrogenation of the sample and reduce the enthalpy of decomposition through an intermediate reaction pathway.
