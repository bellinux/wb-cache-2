30|$|In the SRI {{method of}} rice cultivation, {{irrigation}} {{was done by}} alternate wetting and drying method. Such a system of irrigation favors soil microbial and biological activities and enhances the availability of mineral nutrients compared to rice grown by <b>flooded</b> <b>cultivation</b> methods (Uphoff et al. 2009; Gopalakrishnan et al. 2012 b). In the present investigation, soil biological activities including microbial biomass carbon, nitrogen and dehydrogenase and mineral nutrients including available P, total N and % organic carbon {{were found to be}} higher in the five Streptomyces inoculated plots over the un-inoculated control plots. Similar results were found in SRI rhizospheres compared with those of the same variety of rice plants grown conventionally (Gayathry 2002). Hence, it can be concluded that the five Streptomyces strains survived in the rice rhizosphere and enhanced the soil health conditions. In the present investigation, although roots were not checked for colonization, the data on agronomical (including roots), yield, biological and mineral nutrition studies indicate that the five Streptomyces strains had multiplied and colonized the rice roots. Hence, it can be concluded that the five Streptomyces strains used in this study were apparently well adapted to the rice and sorghum rhizosphere environments and enhanced the soil health and plant growth conditions. Significant increases in growth and yield of agronomically important crops in response to inoculation with PGP microbes have been repeatedly reported (Biswas et al. 2000; Asghar et al. 2002; Silva et al. 2006). PGP microbes are thought to stimulate plant growth by two mechanisms: (1) by altering hormone balance in the host plant and increasing mineral nutrient solubilization (direct effects); (2) by antagonism towards plant pathogens (indirect effects; Glick 1995). In the present investigation, the five Streptomyces strains were found to have both mechanisms, having PGP traits in rice and sorghum (direct effects) and biocontrol traits, against Fusarium wilt, in chickpea (indirect effects; Gopalakrishnan et al. 2011 b). Broad spectrum PGP and biocontrol agents offer potentially effective novel strategies for controlling multiple pathogens and insect pests. A few of the available biocontrol agents, mostly belonging to Pseudomonas spp., have shown broad spectrum antifungal activity (Hass and Keel 2003; Viji et al. 2003; Kishore et al. 2005). Actinomycetes and other bacteria are also reported in the literature as broad spectrum PGP and biocontrol agents for soil-borne fungal plant pathogens and insect-pests, such as Helicoverpa armigera and Spodoptera litura (El-Tarabily and Sivasithamparam 2006; Sadeghi et al. 2012).|$|E
40|$|Rice {{cultivation}} {{has long}} been considered to have originated from seeding of annual types of wild rice somewhere in subtropics, tropics or in the Yangtze River basin. That idea, however, contains a fatally weak point, {{when we consider the}} tremendous difficulty for primitive human to seed any cereal crop in the warm and humid climate, where weed thrives all year round. Instead of the accepted theory, we have to see a reality that vegetative propagation of edible plants is a dominant form of agriculture in such regions. The possibility is discussed that Job's tears and rice, two cereal crops unique to the region, might have been developed via vegetative propagation to obtain materials for medicine or herb tea in backyard gardens prior to cereal production. This idea is supported by the fact that rice in temperate regions is still perennial in its growth habit and that such backyard gardens with transplanted taro can still be seen from Yunnan Province of China to Laos. Thanks to detailed survey of wild rice throughout China for 1970 – 1980, it is now confirmed that a set of clones of wild rice exist in shallow swamps in Jiangxi Province, an area with severe winter cold. In early summer ancient farmers may have divided the sprouting buds and spread them by transplanting into flooded shallow marsh. Such way of propagation might have faster improved less productive rice through a better genetic potential for response to human interference than quick fixation in seed propagation, because vegetative parts are heterogeneous. Obviously, such a primitive manner of rice cultivation did include the essential parts of rice farming, i. e., nursery bed, transplanting in flooded field of shallow marsh like. Transfer from the primitive nursery to true nursery by seed may have later allowed rice cultivation to be extended to northern regions. In thus devised <b>flooded</b> <b>cultivation</b> there were a series of unique advantages, i. e.; continuous cropping of rice in a same plot, no soil erosion, slow decline of soil fertility, availability of minerals, and resulting in high yield per unit area, which have collectively attained the highly productive cereal cultivation in the warm and humid region. Rice cultivation in marsh is also favorable to raise fish culture, both of which constituted a nutritionally balanced base. Development of irrigation technology to construct flooded farms gave strong bases for stable rice-cultivating society, which in the end formulated the rise of ancient kingdoms of Yue and Wu in China in BC 6 th - 5 th centuries. They were direct descendents of those people who had developed the unique rice cultivation from the era of Hemudu culture, which is dated back to 5 000 BC. Their movement to the south is considered to have established rice-cultivating communities in South China and Southeast Asia, while to the north it transferred the rice-based technology to ancient Korea and Japan and had established there a base for a civilized society...|$|E

The total SOC after two croppings was 16. 50, 20. 88 and 19. 35 ton C ha- 1 in the M, R and RM treatments, respectively. The effects of these short-term cropping changes were observed at both the aggregate level and in the humic substances of soil organic matter. The majority of SOC (ca. 65 %) was present in association with the macro-aggregate (> 250 m), of which the fraction size of 250 - 500 m contained the highest carbon concentration. After two croppings, the 13 C values of SOC and humic substances were shifted towards the 13 C values of rice straw when soil was incorporated with rice straw. The shift of 13 C values towards maize straw’s 13 C values was also observed in cases when maize straw was incorporated into soil.

The amount of Fe 2 + released by the soil at day 58 {{and the increase in}} oxalate-extractable Fe (Feo) upon incubation in vials were larger on average for the Inceptisols than for the Vertisols.

Paradoxically, the Tonga people in Southern Zambia responded positively to the introduction of modern methods of cultivation, exhibiting resilience by adapting and adopting the cultivation of hybrid maize and the ox-drawn plough. They also began to transform their land tenure system from being communal to become increasingly individualised. At independence in 1964, the UNIP government intervened strongly in promoting rural development (1964 - 1990), by subsidising maize production and by implementing protectionist policies to maintain communal tenure. However, food security could not be guaranteed, and the policies led to over dependence of small-scale farmers on government and on maize {{at the expense of other}} food crops. The introduction of neo-liberal policies (from 1991 to 2001) by the MMD government coupled with adverse weather conditions, made food production systems rather vulnerable to both policy and environmental shocks. However, efforts are being made (from 2001 - to date) with the assistance of cooperating partners or the international community, the United Nations System and Non Governmental Organisations (NGOs), to continue with land tenure empowerment policies to ensure secure land tenure for both men and women, and make targeted interventions with partial subsidies to rebuild the resilience of rural society, so as to promote national and household food security...|$|R
40|$|Rockwool is an {{excellent}} growing medium for the hydroponic production of tomato; however, the standard size rockwool blocks [4 x 4 x 2. 5 inches (10 x 10 x 6. 3 cm) or 3 x 3 x 2. 5 inches (7. 5 x 7. 5 x 6. 3 cm) ] are expensive. The following experiments were conducted with less expensive minirock wool blocks (MRBs), on rayon polyester material (RPM) as a bench top liner, to reduce the production cost of tomatoes (Lycopersicon esculentum) grown in a limited-cluster, ebb and <b>flood</b> hydroponic <b>cultivation</b> system. Fruit yield for single-cluster plants growing in MRBs [2 x 2 x 1. 6 inches (5 x 5 x 4 cm) and 1. 6 x 1. 6 x 1. 6 inches (4 x 4 x 4 cm) ] was {{not significantly different from}} plants grown in larger sized blocks (3 x 3 x 2. 5 inches). When the bench top was lined with RPM, roots penetrated the RPM, and an extensive root mat developed between the RPM and the bench top. The fruit yield from plants on RPM was significantly increased compared to plants without RPM due to increases in fruit size and fruit number. RPM also significantly reduced the incidence of blossom-end rot. In a second experiment, single- and double-cluster plants were grown on RPM. Fruit yield for double-cluster plants was 40 % greater than for single-cluster plants due to an increase in fruit number, although the fruit were smaller in size. As in the first experiment, fruit yield for all plants grown in MRBs was not significantly different from plants grown in the larger sized blocks. MRBs and a RPM bench liner are an effective combination in the production of limited-cluster hydroponic tomatoes...|$|R
5000|$|In Polk County, {{the storm}} left light {{property}} damage in Lakeland, reaching under $5,000, {{which included the}} school building being deroofed. Damage to crops was mostly limited to grapefruit and oranges, with losses estimated to have been less than 10%. In the rural communities outside Lakeland, several small building suffered damage. This was considered the worst tropical cyclone in the area since 1897. Lake County experienced sustained winds of 70 mph and 12 to 15 in of rain in some areas. Much of the impact was confined to large trees being uprooted and ornamental vines suffering damage. A number of trees fell on electrical wires, causing power outages and disruptions to telephone service. Additionally, {{it is possible that}} a tornado touched down, based on some pine trees being [...] "splintered from top to bottom and curled up like molasses candy." [...] Damage to citrus crops was light, with losses conservatively estimated at less than 5%. Strong winds in Orange County left the entire city of Orlando without electricity, disrupting commerce. Citrus crops suffered no more than 5% in losses in the county. In St. Augustine, wind downed wires, some of which caused small fires in the business district. A steamship capsized between Jacksonville and Miami and there were reports of damage to several other small boats offshore. Agricultural damage from the hurricane was high, reaching over $2 million, with more than $1 million incurred to crops and the remainder to fertilizer and other materials. Citrus crops were especially hard hit, with 800,000 to 1,000,000 boxes of fruit lost. Salt water, caused by coastal <b>flooding,</b> prevented <b>cultivation</b> of soil in some areas, though rainfall eventually washed away the salt. In all, the hurricane left at least eight people dead and about $10 million in damage.|$|R
40|$|Ultisols are soils {{formed in}} the {{intensive}} leaching of bases, acid soil reaction, with relatively good soil drainage causing of acid soil pH and increased levels of Al/Fe-free, thus exacerbating the toxicity of Al/Fe and phosphate fixation. Ultisols <b>flooding</b> for rice <b>cultivation</b> can change the equilibrium behavior of the surface charge constituent soil minerals, particularly {{in relation to the}} reactivity of the phosphate anion. From various research results, it is evident that the flooding caused changes Ultisols redox potential values (Eh) becomes smaller and the soil pH near neutral, so the impact on the change in equilibrium behavior of nutrients, especially Al, Fe, Mn, N, P, K, S, Zn, Cu, and Si. Flooding can increase the availability of P in soil solution, due to decreasing redox potential (Eh), soil pH increased and decreased reactivity and ferol aluminol groups of surface mineral Kaolinite, Gibsite and Goetite the phosphate anion.

40|$|Desertification is an {{accumulative}} {{outcome of}} unsustainable land use practices along with deforestation, inappropriate farming practices, intensive agriculture, overgrazing, landslides and <b>floods,</b> and shifting <b>cultivation.</b> These factors destabilize ecosystems, accelerate silting of reservoirs and other water bodies, and change hydrological regime resulting in land degradation process. Sericulture {{has a positive}} impact on the environment, since it encourages the plantation of mulberry plants, and increases vegetation and green land, which in turn bring about the positive effect towards preventing or reversing desertification. As roots of mulberry plants are very profuse and robust, they are very helpful in holding soil firmly and preventing soil erosion. Honeybees and beekeeping combat desertification through pollination of valuable plant species, which contribute to soil conservation, control erosion, and provide valuable resources for wildlife. Through beekeeping, communities are empowered to utilize the natural resources that are in their environment and they learn how to manage, take care of and earn money through utilizing the resources. It is a valuable conservation tool, instigating people to derive economic benefit not only from indigenous forests but also from other floral resources in a non-destructive way, ensuring local participation in conservation efforts...|$|R
40|$|Although {{floods in}} {{watersheds}} {{have been associated}} with land-use change since ancient times, the dynamics of flooding is still incompletely understood. In this paper we explored the relations between rainfall, groundwater level, and cultivation to explain the dynamics of floods in the extremely flat and valuable arable lands of the Quinto river watershed, in central Argentina. The analysis involved an area of 12. 4 million hectare during a 26 -y period (1978 – 2003), which comprised two extensive flooding episodes in 1983 – 1988 and 1996 – 2003. Supported by information from surveys as well as field and remote sensing measurements, we explored the correlation among precipitation, groundwater levels, flooded area and land use. Flood extension was associated to the dynamics of groundwater level, but these two variables displayed a poor association with rainfall, being particularly decoupled from it during the rainy periods. Correlations between groundwater level and flood extension were positive in all cases, but while highly significant relations (P&lt; 0. 01) were found in highlands, non significant relations (P&gt; 0. 05) predominate in lowlands. Our analysis supports the existence of a cyclic mechanism driven by the reciprocal influence between cultivation and groundwater levels in highlands. This cycle would involve the following stages: (a) cultivation boosts the elevation of groundwater levels through decreased evapotranspiration; (b) as groundwater level rises, floods spread causing a decline of land cultivation; (c) flooding propitiates higher evapotranspiration favouring its own retraction; (d) cultivation expands following the retreat of <b>floods.</b> Thus, <b>cultivation</b> would trigger a destabilizing feedback self affecting future cultivation in the highlands. It is unlikely that such sequence can work in lowlands. The results suggest that rather than responding directly and solely to the same mechanism, floods in lowlands may be the combined result of various factors like local rainfall, groundwater level fluctuations, surface and subsurface lateral flow, and water-body interlinking. Although the hypothetical mechanisms proposed here require additional understanding efforts, they suggest a promising avenue of environmental management in which cultivation could be steered in the region to smooth the undesirable impacts of floods...|$|R
40|$|Flood {{events are}} often {{inundated}} rice fields {{and can cause}} flooding to surrounding areas (the lower reaches of the river) {{should not be underestimated}} (just blame the rainfall factor alone), but should be seen also internal factors of the techniques of rice cultivation in paddy fields. The purpose of research/study was to analyze the effect of <b>flooding</b> on the <b>cultivation</b> of paddy rice to infiltration and provide alternative solutions cultivation techniques to reduce flooding. The research method in this study is a survey method with the quantitative approach. Techniques flooding in paddy rice cultivation, especially irrigated cropping pattern rice 3 times a year have resulted in the formation of plow layer tread that is waterproof (hardpan). Waterproof coating that forms on the floor of paddy (rice surface) cannot infiltrate rainwater so {{that if there is a}} high-intensity rainfall in the rainy season, rice cannot hold the rain water will overflow and cause flooding to the area around the rice fields. Techniques inundation in lowland rice <b>cultivation</b> resulted in <b>flooded</b> paddy rice growth period in a rather long time (over 2 months), so that the aggregate soil is loose and prone to erosion and landslide potential. Anticipation of floods caused by wetland can be done by making the high rice fields higher than the height of the floodwaters that ever happened to the rice field and lowering the height of standing water in the paddy fields...|$|R
