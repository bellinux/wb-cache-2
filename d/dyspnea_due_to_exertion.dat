40|$|Abstract Background Rapid and {{accurate}} diagnosis and management can be lifesaving {{for patients with}} acute dyspnea. However, making a differential diagnosis and selecting early treatment for patients with acute dyspnea in the emergency setting is a clinical challenge that requires complex decision-making {{in order to achieve}} hemodynamic balance, improve functional capacity, and decrease mortality. In the present study, we examined the screening potential of rapid evaluation by lung-cardiac-inferior vena cava (LCI) integrated ultrasound for differentiating acute heart failure syndromes (AHFS) from primary pulmonary disease in patients with acute dyspnea in the emergency setting. Methods Between March 2011 and March 2012, 90 consecutive patients (45 women, 78. 1 [*]±[*] 9. 9 [*]years) admitted to the emergency room of our hospital for acute dyspnea were enrolled. Within 30 [*]minutes of admission, all patients underwent conventional physical examination, rapid ultrasound (lung-cardiac-inferior vena cava [LCI] integrated ultrasound) examination with a hand-held device, routine laboratory tests, measurement of brain natriuretic peptide, and chest X-ray in the emergency room. Results The final diagnosis was acute <b>dyspnea</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> AHFS in 53 patients, acute <b>dyspnea</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> pulmonary disease despite a history of heart failure in 18 patients, and acute <b>dyspnea</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> pulmonary disease in 19 patients. Lung ultrasound alone showed a sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, and positive predictive value of 96. 2, 54. 0, 90. 9, and 75. 0 %, respectively, for differentiating AHFS from pulmonary disease. On the other hand, LCI integrated ultrasound had a sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, and positive predictive value of 94. 3, 91. 9, 91. 9, and 94. 3 %, respectively. Conclusions Our study demonstrated that rapid evaluation by LCI integrated ultrasound is extremely accurate for differentiating acute <b>dyspnea</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> AHFS from that caused by primary pulmonary disease in the emergency setting. </p...|$|R

50|$|Blood tests {{routinely}} performed include electrolytes (sodium, potassium), {{measures of}} kidney function, liver function tests, thyroid function tests, a complete blood count, and often C-reactive protein if infection is suspected. An elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) {{is a specific}} test indicative of heart failure. Additionally, BNP {{can be used to}} differentiate between causes of <b>dyspnea</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> heart failure from other causes of dyspnea. If myocardial infarction is suspected, various cardiac markers may be used.|$|R

30|$|A 53 -year-old male (height 163  cm, weight 60  kg) who {{developed}} <b>dyspnea</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> left pleural effusion 2  months before and underwent pleural fluid aspiration. Video-assisted empyema curettage was scheduled because empyema was not improved. The patient had <b>dyspnea</b> at rest <b>due</b> <b>to</b> pleural effusion and cardiac dysfunction (EF around 30 %) after cardiotomy 2  years ago. Consequently, he required support with dobutamine (DOB) after admission. General anesthesia with one-lung ventilation was viable based on preoperative cardiopulmonary function, but had {{the possibility of}} induction of postoperative cardiopulmonary insufficiency. Based on a discussion with the surgeon, the surgical wounds {{were expected to be}} small and the operative time short. Therefore, sedation with DEX and regional anesthesia were chosen.|$|R

40|$|Hypoxia is a well-recognized {{consequence}} of venous admixture resulting {{from right to}} left intracardiac shunting. Right to left shunting is usually associated with high pulmonary artery pressure or alteration in the direction of blood flow <b>due</b> <b>to</b> an anatomical abnormality of the thorax. Surgical or percutaneous closure remains controversial; however it is performed frequently for patients presenting with clinical sequela presumed to be resulting from paradoxical embolization secondary to right to left shunting. We report two patients with hypoxia and <b>dyspnea</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> right to left shunting through a patent foramen ovale (PFO) and venous admixture in the absence of elevated pulmonary artery pressures or other predisposing conditions like pneumonectomy or diaphragmatic weakness. Percutaneous closures of the PFOs with the self-centering Amplatzer device resulted in resolution of hypoxia and symptoms related to it...|$|R
40|$|A 52 -year-old {{woman with}} Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease {{presented}} with severe <b>dyspnea</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> bilateral diaphragmatic paralysis severely compromising respiratory function.

Postoperatively, she demonstrated very good symptomatic relief supported by objective evidence, including improvement in lung function tests. We describe our management of this difficult condition, including the surgical and anesthetic considerations, and would recommend bilateral diaphragmatic plication as an effective option in patients with this unfortunate disease...|$|R
40|$|A 70 -year old woman, with {{a history}} of recent thromboembolic stroke, was {{admitted}} to our hospital because of sudden <b>dyspnea</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> pulmonary thromboembolism.

Because her cerebral status contraindicated surgical intervention, medical therapy with heparin and warfarin was started. Follow-up transthoracic echocardiography, performed 3 weeks after the initiation of therapy, revealed complete resolution of the thrombus. Medical therapy can be an alternative to surgical therapy in high-risk patients who have entrapped thrombi...|$|R
40|$|Both leukocytoclastic {{vasculitis}} and metastatic pulmonary calcification are {{conditions that}} rarely occur {{during the course}} of multiple myeloma. We present a multiple myeloma patient that had severe <b>dyspnea</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> metastatic pulmonary calcinosis, and ulceronecrotic skin lesions caused by leukocytoclastic vasculitis. After 3 courses of standarddose chemotherapy all skin and pulmonary lesions disappeared. Autologous peripheral stem cell transplantation was performed and during 1 year of follow-up the patient was in complete remission; after 1 year, laboratory test results indicated disease relapse. Although the patient was treated with bortezomib and dexamethasone, the disease progressed. Non-myeloablative allogeneic stem cell transplantation was performed, but despite of all treatment the patient died <b>due</b> <b>to</b> disease progression. ...|$|R
40|$|Dental {{foreign body}} {{aspiration}} is a known complication {{in patients with}} maxillofacial trauma. Although diagnosis may be delayed, especially in elderly people with radiolucent dental appliances, clinician {{must be aware of}} dental tracheobronchial aspiration to minimize potentially serious consequences.

40|$|We {{describe}} {{the usefulness of}} magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for differential diagnosis of intraoral tumor in neonates. We present two neonates who suffered from <b>dyspnea</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> intraoral tumor since bith. In both cases, computed tomogra- phy (CT) failed to reveal the communication between the intraoral tumor and intracranial organs. In Case 1, the intraoral tumor communicating with sella turcica through a cranio- pharyngeal canal was identified by MRI and then, a diagnosis of transsphenoidal meningoencephalocele was established. In Case 2, a diagnosis of solitary cyst in the oropharynx was established by MRI. MRI was very useful in the differential diagnosis of intraoral tumor in neonates...|$|R
40|$|A 49 -year-old woman visited our {{emergency}} department because of exertional <b>dyspnea</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> severe left ventricular functional failure.

40|$|Interstitial {{lung disease}} (ILD) is an {{increasingly}} recognized complication of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) contributing to significantly increased morbidity and mortality. Diagnosis {{can be challenging}} since patients are unlikely <b>to</b> report <b>dyspnea</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> an overall decrease in physical activity with advanced arthritic symptoms. Additionally, infections, drug toxicity, and environmental toxins can mimic ILD, creating significant diagnostic dilemmas for the clinician. In this paper we will explore an effective clinical algorithm for the diagnosis of RA-ILD. We will also discuss features of drug-related toxicities, infections, and environmental toxins that comprise the main entities in the differential diagnosis of RA-ILD. Finally, we will explore the known and experimental treatment options that may have some benefit {{in the treatment of}} RA-ILD...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Introduction Primary {{malignant}} pericardial mesothelioma is a {{very rare}} pericardial tumor of unknown etiology. Case presentation A 61 -year-old Caucasian woman was admitted to our hospital complaining of exertional <b>dyspnea</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> a large pericardial effusion. Intrapericardial fluid volume declined after repeated pericardiocentesis, but the patient progressively developed a hemodynamically relevant pericardial constriction. Pericardiectomy revealed a pericardial mesothelioma. Subsequently, four cycles of chemotherapy (dosage according to recently published trials) were administered. The patient remained asymptomatic, {{and there was no}} recurrence of the tumor after three years. Conclusion Pericardial mesothelioma should be considered and managed appropriately in non-responders to pericardiocentesis, and in patients who develop constrictive pericarditis late in their clinical course. </p...|$|R
40|$|Ectopic {{pancreas}} {{located in}} the mediastium is an extremely rare anomaly. We present a case of an ectopic pancreas located in a giant mediastinal cyst in an 18 -year-old man. He presented with symptoms of <b>dyspnea</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> external compression of the cyst on the left main bronchus. Complete surgical resection was performed through median sternotomy, with relief of the bronchial compression postoperatively. Literature review showed 20 previously reported cases.

50|$|In humans, {{sweating}} {{is primarily}} a means of thermoregulation, {{which is achieved by}} the water-rich secretion of the eccrine glands. Maximum sweat rates of an adult can be up to 2-4 liters per hour or 10-14 liters per day (10-15 g/min·m²), but is less in children prior to puberty. Evaporation of sweat from the skin surface has a cooling effect <b>due</b> <b>to</b> evaporative cooling. Hence, in hot weather, or when the individual's muscles heat up <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>exertion,</b> more sweat is produced. Animals with few sweat glands, such as dogs, accomplish similar temperature regulation results by panting, which evaporates water from the moist lining of the oral cavity and pharynx.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Lung volume {{reduction}} (LVR) {{surgery is}} an effective and organ-preserving treatment option for patients suffering from severe <b>dyspnea</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> endstage emphysema. METHOD: Resection of functionally inactive lung parenchyma reduces over-inflation and restores the elastic recoil of the lungs. Thus it results in improvement of dyspnea, mobility and pulmonary function. Patient selection is crucial. Of simliar importance is pulmonary rehabilitation, as well as sufficient expertise {{in the treatment of}} endstage chronic respiratory failure. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The in-hospital morbidity and mortality after LVR are acceptable (0 to 5 %) and the good results seem to last at least 18 to 24 months. LVR can be offered to selected patients either as an alternative or as bridge to lung transplantation...|$|R
40|$|The present {{case report}} {{describes}} a 44 -year-old woman who presented with <b>dyspnea</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> diffuse interstitial lung disease. High-resolution computed tomography showed features of usual interstitial pneumonia, but the lung biopsy obtained by video-assisted thoracoscopy {{was consistent with}} a histological pattern of nonspecific interstitial pneumonia. Following the procedure, the patient developed progressive respiratory distress and died on postoperative day 13 with a clinical picture of acute interstitial pneumonia. The autopsy showed evidence of diffuse alveolar damage superimposed on the background pattern of nonspecific interstitial pneumonia. The present case report supports the notion that patients {{with a variety of}} subtypes of idiopathic interstitial pneumonias may be at risk of exacerbation of their underlying disease following thoracic procedures, including video-assisted thoracoscopic lung biopsy...|$|R
50|$|The {{clinical}} {{course of}} HCM is variable. Many patients are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic. The symptoms {{and signs of}} HCM include shortness of breath (<b>dyspnea)</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> stiffening and decreased blood filling of the ventricles, exertional chest pain (sometimes known as angina) <b>due</b> <b>to</b> reduced or restricted blood flow (ischemia) to the coronary arteries, uncomfortable awareness of the heart beat (palpitations) <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the aforementioned ischemia, as well as disruption of the electrical system running through the abnormal heart muscle, lightheadedness, fatigue, fainting (called syncope) and sudden cardiac death. As mentioned, <b>dyspnea</b> is largely <b>due</b> <b>to</b> increased stiffness of the left ventricle (LV), which impairs filling of the ventricles, but also leads to elevated pressure in the left ventricle and left atrium, causing back pressure and interstitial congestion in the lungs. Symptoms are not {{closely related to the}} presence or severity of an outflow tract gradient. Often, symptoms mimic those of congestive heart failure (esp. activity intolerance and dyspnea), but treatment of each is different. Beta blockers are used in both cases, but treatment with diuretics, a mainstay of CHF treatment, will exacerbate symptoms in hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy by decreasing ventricular preload volume and thereby increasing outflow resistance (less blood to push aside the thickened obstructing tissue).|$|R
40|$|Two healthy cats {{underwent}} elective {{surgical procedures}} under general anesthesia. One developed severe esophagitis leading to esophageal rupture, mediastinitis, and pyothorax. The other cat developed esophageal stricture, diverticulum formation, and suspected iatrogenic perforation. Both cats had signs of dysphagia and regurgitation beginning {{a few days}} after anesthesia. The first cat also had severe <b>dyspnea</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> septic pleural effusion and pneumomediastinum. In the second cat, endoscopy revealed diffuse esophagitis, an esophageal stricture, and a large esophageal diverticulum. Rupture of the esophageal wall occurred while inflating the esophagus for inspection. <b>Due</b> <b>to</b> the poor prognosis, both cats were euthanized. Necropsy revealed severe esophageal changes. Postanesthetic esophagitis has been previously described in dogs and cats; however, severe life-threatening esophageal injuries rarely occur as a sequel to general anesthesia. To the authors' knowledge, esophageal rupture secondary to perianesthetic reflux has never been reported in cats...|$|R

40|$|A {{case of a}} {{perforated}} black esophagus {{treated with}} minimal invasive surgery is presented. A 68 -year-old women underwent a right-sided hemihepatectomy and radio frequency ablation of two metastasis in the left liver lobe. Previous history revealed a hemicolectomy for an obstructive colon carcinoma with post-operative chemotherapy. Postoperatively she developed severe <b>dyspnea</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> a perforation of the esophagus with leakage to the pleural space. Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) to adequately drain the perforation was performed. Gastroscopy revealed a perforated black esophagus. The black esophagus, acute esophageal necrosis or Gurvits syndrome is a rare entity with an unknown aetiology {{which is likely to}} be multifactorial. The estimated mortality rate is high.
