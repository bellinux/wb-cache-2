5|$|After the First World War {{the canal}} {{remained}} {{in a state}} of limbo – with minimal maintenance by the railway company – and was the haunt of fishermen and walkers. The Conservators continued their annual <b>inspections,</b> <b>and</b> the infrastructure remained in remarkably good order, compared to many other closed canals. The section near Creech St Michael was even used for swimming lessons for the local school children in the 1930s.|$|E

The roster of field and staff officers was fundamentally {{the same as their}} previous nine month term of service. They departed on July 20 for Washington, reaching the city on July 22. They were posted on Arlington Heights in Fort C.F. Smith. Their month of service there was mundane, consisting of regular drills, <b>inspections</b> <b>and</b> fatigue duty.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} promote the {{scientific}} and normalized work of the <b>inspection</b> <b>and</b> quarantine, limited <b>inspection</b> <b>and</b> quarantine resources have {{to be used for}} efficient management of limitless <b>inspection</b> <b>and</b> quarantine objects, which requires the screening of the background conformity conditions of <b>inspection</b> <b>and</b> quarantine. Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) is a methodology for potential reliability analysis and safety assessment, and has been widely applied to the protection system of accident prevention. It is of great significance to use FMEA to assess risk in the field of <b>inspection</b> <b>and</b> quarantine. This paper provides an approach for risk occurrence assessment according to actual needs of <b>inspection</b> <b>and</b> quarantine work, based on risk elements analysis in <b>inspection</b> <b>and</b> quarantine work...|$|R
40|$|In this research, a risk-based {{shutdown}} <b>inspection</b> <b>and</b> {{maintenance interval}} optimization for a processing facility is proposed. Often <b>inspection</b> <b>and</b> maintenance activities can’t be performed until the processing unit or plant is taken into a non-operational state, generally known as “shutdown”. Extensive work on <b>inspection</b> <b>and</b> maintenance interval estimation modeling {{is available in}} the concerned literature however, no to very limited application on shutdown <b>inspection</b> <b>and</b> maintenance modeling is observed for a continuous operating facility. Majority of the published literature deals to optimize individual equipment <b>inspection</b> <b>and</b> maintenance interval without considering the overall impact of plant unavailability due to shutdown. They all deal to optimize individual equipment <b>inspection</b> <b>and</b> maintenance interval considering cost, risk, availability and reliability. The efforts towards finding an optimal <b>inspection</b> <b>and</b> maintenance interval is not considered in these studies especially when it requires unit or plant to be in shutdown state from an operational state for performing <b>inspection</b> <b>and</b> maintenance. This topic is selected to bridge the existing gap in the available literature and to provide a means to develop a methodology to estimate the shutdown <b>inspection</b> <b>and</b> maintenance interval for a continuous processing unit or plant, rather an <b>inspection</b> <b>and</b> maintenance interval for each piece of equipment considering the overall asset availability, reliability and risk. A component failure due to wear or degradation is a major threat to asset failure in a processing facility. A carefully planned <b>inspection</b> <b>and</b> maintenance strategy not only mitigate the effects of age-based degradation and reduce the threat of failure but also minimize the risk exposure. Generally failure caused by wear or degradation is modeled as a stochastic process. For an effective <b>inspection</b> <b>and</b> maintenance strategy, the stochastic nature of failure has to be taken into consideration. The proposed methodology aims to minimize the risk of exposure considering effect of failure on human life, financial investment and environment by optimizing the interval of process unit shutdown. Risk-based shutdown <b>inspection</b> <b>and</b> maintenance optimization quantifies the risk to which individual equipment are subjected and uses this as a basis for the optimization of a shutdown <b>inspection</b> <b>and</b> maintenance strategy...|$|R

On 23 December the Road Bridge reopened for all traffic except heavy goods vehicles (HGVs). On 4 February, it was announced this had been pushed back to March, due to further problems with the truss end link pins in the southern towers, which required additional remedial work.|$|E
5|$|Eisenhower {{would leave}} office with an {{agreement}} out of reach, as Eisenhower's technical advisors, upon whom he relied heavily, became {{mired in the}} complex technical questions of a test ban, driven {{in part by a}} strong interest among American experts to lower the error rate of seismic test detection technology. Some, including Kistiakowsky, would eventually raise concerns about the ability of <b>inspections</b> <b>and</b> monitors to successfully detect tests. The primary product of negotiations under Eisenhower was the testing moratorium without any enforcement mechanism. Ultimately, the goal of a comprehensive test ban would be abandoned in favor of a partial ban due to questions over seismic detection of underground tests.|$|E

5|$|Many {{superficial}} inspections {{were performed}} on the locomotive in 1980 and it {{was found to be}} in relatively sound mechanical condition. There wasn't a significant amount of deterioration noted in these early <b>inspections,</b> <b>and</b> when the wheels were jacked off the rails, as they had been 50 years earlier, the axles were found to be freely operable. One morning in January 1980, before the museum opened to the public, museum officials used compressed air to power the cylinders and move the wheels through the connecting rods {{for the first time since}} its last semi-operation. After the compressed air blew some dirt and debris out of the locomotive's exhaust stack, it was soon running smoothly.|$|E

Most of the hypogea were excavated jointly by the Polish expedition and the Syrian Directorate, while the area of Efqa was excavated by Jean Starcky and Jafar al-Hassani. The Palmyrene irrigation system was discovered in 2008 by Jørgen Christian Meyer who researched the Palmyrene countryside through ground <b>inspections</b> <b>and</b> satellite images. Most of Palmyra still remains unexplored especially the residential quarters {{in the north and}} south while the necropolis has been thoroughly excavated by the Directorate and the Polish expedition. Excavation expeditions left Palmyra in 2011 due to the Syrian Civil War.|$|E
5|$|February saw the issuing of {{equipment}} and the commencement of training, however, this was punctuated by medical <b>inspections</b> <b>and</b> dental treatment as well as ceremonial duties surrounding the commemoration of the Treaty of Waitangi. A lack of previous experience in technical trades also hampered the training of the battalion, as the unit was short of men {{who were able to}} serve in roles such as clerks, drivers and signallers because the majority of personnel were drawn from mainly rural backgrounds. Consequently, men for these roles had to be trained from scratch. The organisation of the battalion was finally completed in March, when the men were allocated to their respective companies, and on 13 March 1940 the 28th (Māori) Battalion was declared on active service. After 14 days leave, the battalion conducted a five-week concentration period before embarking on 1 May 1940. The battalion's strength at this time was 39 officers and 642 other ranks.|$|E

5|$|Three {{days before}} {{scheduled}} services were to start, {{permission to use}} the trains had still not been granted by the Norwegian Railway Inspectorate. The inspectorate had a series of safety concerns, including follow-up on the safety terms for the wheels and axles; lack of documentation of the crew's training; denying NSB's request to have fewer <b>inspections</b> <b>and</b> less maintenance on the trains; lack of consideration of critical events deemed to have a high probability to occur but have a low consequence; lack of a safety inspector for operations and maintenance; and that the trains were so heavy that they would exceed the permitted axle load of the lines. Det Norske Veritas (DNV) warned against a possible weakness in the axles. NSB wanted to use an expert from Deutsche Bahn to perform the necessary tests, but limited availability of the expert resulted in the Norwegian National Rail Administration granting a half-year delay of the inspections.|$|E
5|$|Transport Canada {{released}} its report on July 30, 2008. It blamed weather conditions, but also focused on driver fatigue and driver error. It cited several breaches of provincial law regarding {{the operation of}} commercial vehicles. The coach had been on duty for sixteen hours when the collision happened, contravening the law that one cannot drive {{if they have been}} working more than fourteen consecutive hours. The report also identified inadequate pre-trip <b>inspections</b> <b>and</b> log book keeping, and the lack of a contingency plan in the event of poor weather. Transport Canada stated that although they put an added emphasis on some factors, their report was consistent with the RCMP's. They concurred that the vehicle would have failed an inspection in its pre-collision state because of worn tires and brakes.|$|E
5|$|The Minister of the Household (Guangluxun 光祿勳), {{also known}} as Superintendent of the Household and Supervisor of Attendants, was {{originally}} titled the Prefect of the Gentlemen of the Palace (Lang zhongling 郎中令) before 104 BC. He {{was responsible for the}} emperor's security within the palace grounds, external imperial parks, and wherever the emperor made an outing by chariot. However, to ensure that the emperor's entire safety was not entrusted to a single officer, the subordinates of the Minister of the Guards were given sole right to patrol the palaces' entrances and walls while the eunuchs guarded the emperor's private apartments and harem. Three of the five cadet corps commanded by the Minister of the Household were actually armed civilian nominees serving a period of probation before appointment to a government office; the other two corps were composed of imperial bodyguards who were never appointed to civilian offices. The former were often recommended by commandery-level Administrators as Filial and Incorrupt, while others could be relatives of high officials in central government. The Minister of the Household oversaw subordinate court advisors (Yi Lang /议郎） who advised the emperor and engaged in scholarly debates. They were allowed to openly criticize the emperor, participate in provincial <b>inspections,</b> <b>and</b> conduct mourning ceremonies for recently deceased kings and marquesses while installing their successors. Internuncios (Yezhe 謁者), led by a Supervisor of the Internuncios (Yezhe puye 謁者僕射), were subordinates of the Minister of the Household who participated in state ceremonies, condoled on behalf of the emperor for recently deceased officials, inspected public works and military camps along the frontiers, and acted as diplomats to the semi-autonomous fiefs and non-Han-Chinese peoples along the borders.|$|E
