5|$|Una Aue / Frau Von Üxküll – Una Aue is Maximilien's twin sister. She {{is married}} to the aristocrat Berndt von Üxküll, and {{although}} she appears only briefly in person, she dominates Aue's imagination, particularly his sexual <b>fantasies</b> <b>and</b> hallucinations. She lived with her husband on his estate in Pomerania, but apparently moved to Switzerland with him {{towards the end of}} the war. Like her husband, she is critical of Germany's National Socialist regime which, along with his hatred of their mother and stepfather, and his attraction to her, led to her being estranged from Aue following the war.|$|E
5|$|Jonne Valtonen and Roger Wanamo, the arrangers for the Symphonic <b>Fantasies</b> <b>and</b> Symphonic Legends concerts, {{returned}} {{as the lead}} arrangers for the concert. Additional arrangements were made by Jani Laaksonen and Masashi Hamauzu, and Mikko Laine served as the lyricist for the choral components of the concert. Uematsu {{was not involved in}} any aspect of the production, even song selection, as he wanted to be surprised by the result. The style of arrangements followed {{in the tradition of the}} shows preceding Symphonic Odysseys, featuring a number of rich, sophisticated suites structured for melodic storytelling. A focus was put on presenting a balanced mix of fan favorites as well as lesser known material that was not commonly performed in orchestra concerts based on video game music. Böcker styled the concert to be a mix of Shades and Fantasies, in that there was a mix of shorter pieces with longer suites. The titles chosen to be featured in the concert were the Final Fantasy series, King's Knight, Chrono Trigger, the SaGa series, The Last Story, Blue Dragon, and Lost Odyssey. Additionally, Uematsu composed an original fanfare to open the concert, which was arranged by Jonne Valtonen.|$|E

5|$|Rumours that Prince Albert Victor {{may have}} committed, or been {{responsible}} for, the Jack the Ripper murders were first mentioned in print in 1962. It was later alleged, among others by Stephen Knight in , that Albert Victor fathered {{a child with}} a woman in the Whitechapel district of London, and either he or several high-ranking men committed the murders in an effort to cover up his indiscretion. Though such claims have been repeated frequently, scholars have dismissed them as <b>fantasies,</b> <b>and</b> refer to indisputable proof of the Prince's innocence. For example, on 30 September 1888, when Elizabeth Stride and Catherine Eddowes were murdered in London, Albert Victor was over 500miles (over 800km) away at Balmoral, the royal retreat in Scotland, in the presence of Queen Victoria, other family members, visiting German royalty and a large number of staff. According to the official Court Circular, family journals and letters, newspaper reports and other sources, he could not have been near any of the murders. Other fanciful conspiracy theories are that he died of syphilis or poison, that he was pushed off a cliff on the instructions of Lord Randolph Churchill or that his death was faked to remove him from the line of succession.|$|E

25|$|Insight-oriented psychotherapies {{focus on}} {{revealing}} or interpreting unconscious processes. Most commonly referring to psychodynamic therapy, of which psychoanalysis {{is the oldest}} and most intensive form, these applications of depth psychology encourage the verbalization of all the patient's thoughts, including free associations, <b>fantasies,</b> <b>and</b> dreams, from which the analyst formulates the nature of the past and present unconscious conflicts which are causing the patient's symptoms and character problems.|$|E
25|$|Women {{can stimulate}} {{themselves}} sexually by crossing their legs tightly and clenching {{the muscles in}} their legs, creating pressure on the genitals. This can potentially be done in public without observers noticing. Thoughts, <b>fantasies,</b> <b>and</b> memories of previous instances of arousal and orgasm can produce sexual excitation. Some women can orgasm spontaneously by force of will alone, although this may not strictly qualify as masturbation as no physical stimulus is involved.|$|E
25|$|Psychoanalysis, a psychotherapeutic {{approach}} to behavior change developed by Sigmund Freud and modified by his followers, has also offered {{an explanation of}} substance abuse. This orientation suggests {{the main cause of}} the addiction syndrome is the unconscious need to entertain and to enact various kinds of homosexual and perverse <b>fantasies,</b> <b>and</b> {{at the same time to}} avoid taking responsibility for this. It is hypothesised specific drugs facilitate specific <b>fantasies</b> <b>and</b> using drugs is considered to be a displacement from, and a concomitant of, the compulsion to masturbate while entertaining homosexual and perverse fantasies. The addiction syndrome is also hypothesised to be associated with life trajectories that have occurred within the context of traumatogenic processes, the phases of which include social, cultural and political factors, encapsulation, traumatophilia, and masturbation as a form of self-soothing. Such an approach lies in stark contrast to the approaches of social cognitive theory to addiction—and indeed, to behavior in general—which holds human beings regulate and control their own environmental and cognitive environments, and are not merely driven by internal, driving impulses. Additionally, homosexual content is not implicated as a necessary feature in addiction.|$|E

25|$|In Europe, an {{organization}} called ReviseF65 has worked to remove sadomasochism from the ICD. In 1995, Denmark became the first European Union country to have completely removed sadomasochism from its national classification of diseases. This was followed by Sweden in 2009, Norway in 2010 and Finland 2011. Recent surveys on the spread of BDSM <b>fantasies</b> <b>and</b> practices show strong variations {{in the range of}} their results. Nonetheless, researchers assume that 5 to 25 percent of the population practices sexual behavior related to pain or dominance and submission. The population with related fantasies is believed to be even larger.|$|E
25|$|Psychiatry, {{like most}} medical {{specialties}} has a continuing, has significant need for research into its diseases, classifications and treatments. Psychiatry adopts biology's fundamental belief that disease and health are different elements of an individual's adaptation to an environment. But psychiatry also {{recognizes that the}} environment of the human species is complex and includes physical, cultural, and interpersonal elements. In addition to external factors, the human brain must contain and organize an individual's hopes, fears, desires, <b>fantasies</b> <b>and</b> feelings. Psychiatry's difficult task is to bridge the understanding of these factors {{so that they can be}} studied both clinically and physiologically.|$|E
25|$|There {{has been}} {{considerable}} research {{in recent times}} {{on the role of}} cognitive variables among the set of factors that can lead to rape. A detailed conceptual analysis shows that objectification might underlie denial of agency and personhood that leads to rape. Sexually violent men {{have been shown to be}} more likely to consider victims responsible for the rape and are less knowledgeable about the impact of rape on victims. Such men may misread cues given out by women in social situations and may lack the inhibitions that act to suppress associations between sex and aggression. They may have coercive sexual <b>fantasies,</b> <b>and</b> overall are more hostile towards women than are men who are not sexually violent. In addition to these factors, sexually violent men are believed to differ from other men in terms of impulsivity and antisocial tendencies. They also tend to have an exaggerated sense of masculinity. Sexual violence is also associated with a preference for impersonal sexual relationships as opposed to emotional bonding, with having many sexual partners and with the inclination to assert personal interests at the expense of others. A further association is with adversarial attitudes on gender, that hold that women are opponents to be challenged and conquered.|$|E

25|$|The {{maintenance}} and {{improvement of quality}} of life during the menopausal period {{is at the core}} of estrogen and progestin-based hormone therapy. Both HRT and estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) have been shown to enhance sexual desire in a significant percent of women; however, as with all pharmacological treatments, not all women have been responsive, especially those with preexisting sexual difficulties. ERT restores vaginal cells, pH levels, and blood flow to the vagina, all of which deterioration are associated with the onset of menopause. Dyspareunia (due to vaginal dryness) appears to be the most responsive component of menopausal women’s sexuality to ERT. It also has been shown to have positive effects on the urinary tract and atrophy and may initially improve libido or sexual sensitivity. Other improvements in areas such as sexual desire, arousal, <b>fantasies,</b> <b>and</b> frequency of coitus and orgasm have also been noted. However, the effectiveness of ERT has been shown to decline in some women after long-term use. A number of studies have found that the combined effects of estrogen/androgen replacement therapy can increase a woman’s motivational aspects of sexual behaviour over and above what can be achieved with estrogen therapy alone. Findings on a relatively new form of HRT called tibolone— a synthetic steroid with estrogenic, androgenic, and progestogenic properties— suggest that it has the ability to improve mood, libido, and somatic symptoms of surgically menopausal women to a greater degree than ERT. In various placebo-controlled studies, improvements in vasomotor symptoms, emotional reactions, sleep disturbances, somatic symptoms, and sexual desire have been observed. However, while this is and has been available in Europe for almost two decades, this has not been approved for use in North America at this point.|$|E
