5|$|The Eretrian {{strategy}} was to defend their walls, and undergo a siege. Possibly {{this was the only}} plan that could be agreed on, or became the <b>default</b> <b>option</b> when no plan was agreed. At any rate, since the Persian army had only suffered two defeats in the last century, and since a Greek army had never successfully fought the Persians, this was probably a sensible strategy. Since the Persians arrived by ship, it is probable they had little siege equipment, and indeed, they had already been foiled in the siege of Lindos earlier in the expedition.|$|E

We show that in some settings libertarian paternalism may decrease welfare because <b>default</b> <b>options</b> slow information aggregation in the market. We also analyze what happens when the government acquires imprecise information about individuals, and characterize its incentives to avoid full disclosure of its information to the market, even when it has perfect information. Finally, we consider a market in which individuals can sell their information to others and show that the presence of <b>default</b> <b>options</b> causes the quality of advice to decrease, which may lower social welfare. ...|$|R

The menu can be resized, and expanded into a full-screen display, which is the <b>default</b> <b>option</b> in Tablet mode. A new virtual desktop system was added. A feature known as Task View displays all open windows and allows users to switch between them, or switch between multiple workspaces. Windows Store apps, which previously could be used only in full screen mode, can now be used in self-contained windows similarly to other programs. Program windows can now be snapped to quadrants of the screen by dragging them to the corner. When a window is snapped {{to one side of the}} screen, Task View appears and the user is prompted to choose a second window to fill the unused side of the screen (called [...] "Snap Assist"). Windows' system icons were also changed.|$|E
500|$|There are two ground vehicles, a jeep and a tank, and {{an armored}} {{personnel}} carrier is added by the Operation: Broken Mirror expansion. There are two air vehicles, the Warhawk and Nemesis (which are only cosmetically different), {{both of which}} can use nine weapons, {{an example is the}} AS-3 Tow Missile system. That weapon is the only weapon in the game where the player guides the weapon, the players screen is devoted to guiding the missile and leaving the player open to getting hit. But the upside is that it does massive damage and is the largest explosion in the game. The Omega Dawn expansion adds a dropship, and the Fallen Star expansion adds a jetpack. There are three turrets available to the player (anti-air missile turret, anti-air flak turret, and the [...]50 caliber anti-infantry machine gun). The game uses the PlayStation 3 Sixaxis and DualShock 3 controllers. The game can be set to make use of these controllers' motion sensing function to allow the players to control aircraft and ground vehicles by tilting the controller in different directions rather than the more conventional methods of using the D-pad or analog sticks. However, a traditional control scheme is the <b>default</b> <b>option.</b> Warhawk offers online and offline multiplayer play. Offline allows for 1-4 players splitscreen (without bots). [...] Online features up to 32-player battles, with the ability to have up to 4 players use one PlayStation 3 in split screen mode (on non-ranked servers that permit it). Players 2-4 can enter or exit the game while a match is in progress.|$|E

40|$|The {{behavioral}} {{relevance of}} non-binding <b>default</b> <b>options</b> is well established. While most {{research has focused}} on decision makers' responses to a given default, we argue that this individual decision making perspective is incomplete. Instead, a comprehensive understanding of the foundation of default effects requires taking account of the strategic interaction between default setters and decision makers. We provide a theoretical framework to analyze which <b>default</b> <b>options</b> arise in such interactions, and which defaults are more likely to affect behavior. The key drivers are the relative level of information of default setters and decision makers, and their alignment of interests. We show that default effects are more pronounced if interests of the default setter and decision makers are more closely aligned. Moreover, decision makers are more likely to follow <b>default</b> <b>options</b> the less they are privately informed about the relevant decision environment. In {{the second part of the}} paper we experimentally test the main predictions of the model. We report evidence that both the alignment of interests as well as the relative level of information are key determinants of default effects. An important policy relevant conclusion is that potential distortions arising from <b>default</b> <b>options</b> are unlikely if decision makers are either well-informed or reflect on the interests of default setters...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Modeling {{defaults}} {{is critical}} to pricing debt portfolio deriva-tives such as credit <b>default</b> <b>options,</b> collateralized debt obligation tranches and credit default swaps written on those tranches. However, corre-lated defaults have proven difficult to model. Improper or non-existent modeling of default correlations has caused multi-billion-dollar losses at numerous financial firms. I propose statistical approximations to model correlated defaults. The approximations are consistent and follow from a structural risk factor approach. This approach can price credit <b>default</b> <b>options,</b> such as those currently trading on exchanges, and swaps with an assumption of loss given default. It also yields metrics characteriz-ing portfolio default risk and improving upon a currently-used metric of loan portfolio diversification...|$|R

40|$|Background: Advance {{directives}} (ADs) {{are a way}} {{for patients}} to state their wishes for care in the case that {{they are unable to}} express them. Within the US healthcare system, in the absence of ADs or other legal orders, the default is often to sustain life until no longer medically possible. This systematic review analyzes studies that seek to learn how patients 3 ̆e 50 years old make decisions for their care on ADs and if <b>default</b> <b>options</b> on the AD form itself could affect their choices. Methods: Exhaustive search of MEDLINE-PubMed, CINAHL, and Web of Science, using the terms “advance directive” and “default. ” Relevant studies were assessed for quality using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) tool. Results: Two randomized control trials met eligibility criteria. One trial randomly assigned 3 versions of real ADs to seriously ill patients 3 ̆e 50 years old. One trial version had a comfort-care default, the other trial had a life-extending care default, and the third was a standard AD control without <b>default</b> <b>options.</b> The other trial randomly assigned 3 versions of surveys about ADs to patients 3 ̆e 65 years old. The 3 groups were similar, with an implicit comfort-care default, an implicit life-extension default, and a control without a default. Both studies found that <b>default</b> <b>options</b> affected the way that patients made choices for end-of-life care. Conclusion: Patients 2 ̆ 7 decisions for end-of-life care may be affected by <b>default</b> <b>options.</b> Providers, healthcare systems, and states must be aware of this phenomenon when structuring forms and conversations around this subject...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effect of}} <b>default</b> <b>options</b> on choice behavior in experience-based decisions. To this end, we designed the "radio-button" experimental paradigm, in which participants are asked to set <b>default</b> <b>options</b> that remain effective until they decide to change them, and the outcomes from active and inactive options are determined and presented to participants every two seconds. Comparison of behavior in six basic decision problems run under the "clicking" and "radio-button" experimental paradigms reveals an unexpected result. We find that, although the basic properties of decisions from experience are robust to the option to rely on self-set defaults, the introduction of defaults reduces the tendency to prefer the status quo. We dub this behavioral pattern as the "do something" effect. © 2012 Elsevier B. V. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
