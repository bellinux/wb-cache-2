40|$|Radiation {{cross-linking}} of polyamide 66 with electron beams {{alters the}} material’s characteristics. This {{leads to a}} varied relationship amongst the process, structure, and properties for <b>infrared</b> <b>welding</b> cross-linked polyamide 66. A threedimensional network of covalent bonds results in an impeded melt flow and altered welding characteristics. Compared to non-cross linked polyamide, a changed energy input in the weld during infrared heating and a reduced meltdown can be observed. Such thermal developments and a reduced meltdown affect the resulting weld strengths. Welding factors of almost 60 % of base material strengths can be achieved. A clear influence of the heating time on the weld strength can be observed. The {{scope of this article}} is to investigate the influence of radiation cross-linking on the material characteristics and, by extension, the resulting processing and welding characteristics. Mechanical and optical investigations serve to highlight the influence of radiation cross-linking on the <b>infrared</b> <b>welding</b> process of polyamide 66...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{there is}} a growing {{interest}} in joining techniques for thermoplastic composites as an alternative to adhesive bonding. In this manuscript, a fusion bonding process called hot-tool welding is investigated for this purpose and the used material is a carbon fabric reinforced polyphenylene sulphide. The quality of the welds is experimentally assessed using a short three-point bending setup, which has an interesting distribution of interlaminar shear stresses. It can be concluded that although the hot-tool welding process shows high short-beam strengths, it has some drawbacks. Therefore, a design of an <b>infrared</b> <b>welding</b> setup is presented...|$|E

40|$|High {{performance}} composites, such as carbon-fibre {{reinforced plastics}} (CFRP), {{are increasingly being}} used in high engineering industries. Their wide acceptance introduces an issue regarding the bonding of these materials and their mechanical behaviour. As this reinforced thermoplastic is not easily bonded with adhesives due to the chemical inertness, the fusion bonding process {{could be used to}} make a structural bond. In this paper, the interlaminar fracture behaviour of <b>infrared</b> <b>welded</b> bonds was investigated based on experimental analysis. The material used, is a 5 -harness satin-weave (5 HS) carbon fabric-reinforced polyphenylene sulphide (PPS). Laminates were <b>welded</b> using <b>infrared</b> light and a delamination was introduced by a Kapton film. Welding parameters were first optimized using lapshear tests, then mode I and mode II tests were conducted to determine the fracture toughness behaviour of the welded bonds. Tests under mode I loading were carried out using double cantilever beam (DCB) specimens whereas for mode II loading, three-point end notched flexure (ENF) specimens were considered. Crack growth under mode I and mode II loading conditions was observed to be unstable resulting in a sawtooth like load-displacement response, but nevertheless, values for the fracture toughness were derived...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn this study, {{the effects}} of the welding {{temperature}} field developed during the infrared assembly process on the joining properties of glass fiber reinforced polycarbonate/unreinforced polycarbonate with carbon black were investigated. The temperature field and the contact time govern together the quality of the adhesion at the welding interface. The effect of the semi-transparent glass fiber reinforced polycarbonate composite/unreinforced polycarbonate composite with carbon black interface was quantified in term of quadratic distance of diffusion or diffusion depth through the welding interface. First, an experimental setup for the temperature measurement was performed using infrared camera, during <b>infrared</b> <b>welding</b> of materials joints. Then, numerical simulations using commercial FEM software COMSOL Multiphysics (R) allows simulating the temperature field by implementing a developed 3 D heat source, {{in order to determine the}} generated heat source at the welding interface and the variation of the temperature field during the <b>infrared</b> <b>welding</b> process. The microstructural characterizations were investigated in order to inspect the welding zones quality and to observe their failure modes. The diffusion theory has then been applied to calculate the variation of the quadratic distance of diffusion versus time at different locations. The complete self-diffusion is supposed occurring only at temperature above the polycarbonate glass transition temperature (140 degrees C) and with a quadratic distance of diffusion superior to the mean square end-to-end distance. At the welding interface, the calculation of the quadratic distance of diffusion showed that a complete self-diffusion has not yet been reached. A perfect cohesion was not established.

40|$|This study {{assesses the}} use of <b>infrared</b> <b>welding</b> for a carbon fabric {{reinforced}} polyphenylene sulphide. Infrared light is used in order to melt the thermoplastic matrix of the two components, after which they are joined together under pressure. Welding parameters such as power of the infrared lights, heating time, contact pressure and consolidation time are optimised. Next, a series of joints is fabricated and the interlaminar behaviour of the weld is characterised. For the mode I behaviour, the Double Cantilever Beam test (DCB) is considered, whereas for mode II crack growth, the End Notch Flexure test (ENF) is used. Results are compared to the interlaminar behaviour of the base material. It can be concluded that the infrared process proves very interesting for the material under study and that joints can be manufactured with fracture toughness values equal or higher to the base material, both for mode I and mode II, but that a slightly different failure behaviour manifests itself...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{near-infrared}} radiation to weld plastics {{has been well}} documented over the last 10 years [1, 2, 3]. One of the most common modes of laser welding of plastics is through-transmission <b>infrared</b> <b>welding</b> (TTIr). TTIr is based on the idea of passing light/laser radiation with a wavelength (λ) between 800 and 1100 nm through one plastic component and designing the second component to absorb the laser light, see Figure 1. This wavelength is selected so that the laser light can pass through one of the components being welded. That is to say, most unfilled polymers are relatively transparent at these wavelengths. By adding a small amount of absorbing additive (such as 0. 01 to 1 % carbon black) to the second component, absorption of the light is promoted at the interface. This absorption results in heating and melting of the interface and with the application of a controlled clamp force, the interface is welded...|$|E

An initial group of 5 welded modules containing Phase 2 developmental 5. 9 x 5. 9 cm cells were subjected to cyclical temperatures of + or 80 C {{at a rate of}} 120 cycles per day. Anomalies were noted in the adhesion of the cell contact metallization; therefore, 5 additional modules were fabricated and tested using available Phase I cells with demonstrated contact integrity. Cycling of the later module type through 12, 000 cycles indicated the viability of this type of lightweight flexible array concept. This project demonstrated acceptable use of an alternate interconnect copper in combination with large area wraparound cells and emphasized the necessity to implement weld pull as opposed to solder pull procedures at the cell vendors for cells that will be interconnected by welding...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{experimental}} {{measurements are}} performed {{to confirm the}} global analytical model (refraction and absorption phenomena) presented in the previous work. Initially, an experimental approach to the estimation of the laser beam spread in a semi-transparent composite and at interface (width of the output beam) subjected to an incident heat flux, was presented. This parameter represents a fundamental input data for the global analytical model (refraction and absorption) during the numerical simulation of transmission <b>infrared</b> <b>welding.</b> Then, an experimental setup for the temperature measurement is performed using infrared camera, during infrared transmission welding of materials joints to validate the welding simulation results (a transient numerical model, based both on conduction and radiation mode heat transfer) with the developed analytical model. The commercial FEM software COMSOL Multiphysics (R) is used to compute temperature distribution by implementing a radiative source term. Numerical simulations are compared with experimental data. The agreement between simulations and experiments is fair, which gives confidence to use the developed model with acceptable accuracy. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Continuous fibre-reinforced {{thermoplastics}} {{often are}} offered as impregnated and consolidated semi-finished products which {{are known as}} organic sheets. The thermoplastic matrix leads to several advantages including the thermoformability and weldability. Parts made of organic sheets are frequently produced by forming the semi-finished product into half-shells and stiffening those shells {{in the course of}} the process e. g. by the injection moulding of ribs. Larger and more complex parts with hollow body structures can be manufactured e. g. by forming the semi-finished products into half-shells and joining the half-shells. However, the currently available manufacturing technologies for parts made of organic sheets have cap profile shaped joints which prevent the use of the reinforcing fibres across the joint plane. Investigations have proven that overlapping weld joints in organic sheets show much higher strengths than cap profile shaped joints which can be explained by the fibre use across the joint plane. Furthermore, the <b>infrared</b> <b>welding</b> technology was verified as an appropriate process for the welding of organic sheets since no need for additional welding material is given, short heating times can be realized and no contact of the infrared emitters to the joining parts is required. Therefore, the present study shall reveal the high potential of the overlapping welding of organic sheets. Influences on the weld strengths of infrared welded organic sheets are described and potential improvements concerning the materials to be welded as well as the welding process are shown...|$|E
40|$|Large-scale {{laminated}} {{safety glass}} is increasingly used in {{the public and private}} sector for example museums, jewelers or villas. Special safety is provided by these glasses in layered combination with polycarbonate sheets. Due to the low weight and its high tensile elongation comparing glass of the same thickness, highly transparent polycarbonate is suitable for safety-relevant components. Because of the dimensional limitation in the extrusion process, joining polycarbonate compounds are necessary for large-area joint of this {{laminated safety glass}}. According to the present state of the art, a transparent weld joint of polycarbonate is not possible. Within the scope of the project, polycarbonate joints were produced by <b>infrared</b> <b>welding</b> and adhesive bonding. The transparency of the joints was realized by varying the process parameters, for example the heating time. Additionally the present study focusses on a new innovative light intensity measurement, because conventional optical test methods can only subjectively assess the transparency and quality of the compound and the welding seam. The principle is based on the transmission of the welded and polished polycarbonate sample by means of a laser and the measurement of the current at the connected photoelectric cell, which is proportional to the intensity of the laserlight. This enables a qualitative evaluation of the joining dimension and -quality such as structural changes over the entire sample width. The results of this objective method correlate with the width of the stress distribution around the joining level, which are made visible with the photoelasticity using a polariscope and thus contribute to a better process understanding...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{the many}} {{attractive}} properties of conjugated polymers, their practical applications are often {{limited by the}} lack of a simple, scalable, and nondisruptive patterning method. Here, a direct, scalable, high-resolution patterning technique for conducting polymers is demonstrated that does not involve photoresists, masks, or postprocessing treatment. Complex, well-defined patterns down to sub-micrometer scales can be created from nanofibrous films {{of a wide variety of}} conducting polymers by photothermally welding the nanofibers using a low-energy <b>infrared</b> laser. The <b>welding</b> depth, structural robustness, and optical properties of the films are readily controlled. In addition, the electrical properties such as conductivity can be precisely tuned over a 7 -order of magnitude range, while maintaining the characteristic tunable electronic properties in the nonwelded polyaniline regions. 2011 American Chemical Society...|$|R
50|$|Infrared {{wavelengths}} {{longer than}} 750 nm can produce {{changes in the}} lens of the eye. Glassblower's cataract {{is an example of a}} heat injury that damages the anterior lens capsule among unprotected glass and iron workers. Cataract-like changes can occur in workers who observe glowing masses of glass or iron without protective eyewear for many hours a day. Another important factor is the distance between the worker and the source of radiation. In the case of arc <b>welding,</b> <b>infrared</b> radiation decreases rapidly as a function of distance, so that farther than three feet away from where welding takes place, it does not pose an ocular hazard anymore but, ultraviolet radiation still does. This is why welders wear tinted glasses and surrounding workers only have to wear clear ones that filter UV.|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} conducted sheds {{a light on}} the question why robust in-process monitoring and adaptive control are not fully implemented in the welding industry. In the research project FaRoMonitA, the possibilities to monitor the weld quality during welding have been investigated. Research conducted in this area has merely focused on technical issues investigated in a laboratory environment. To advance the research front and release some barriers related to industrial acceptance, the studies conducted in this paper have been both quantitative and qualitative in form of experiments combined with an interview study. The quality property weld penetration depth was chosen for in-process monitoring to evaluate the industrial relevance and applicability. A guaranteed weld penetration depth is critical for companies producing parts influenced by fatigue. The parts studied were fillet welds produced by gas metal arc welding.
