5|$|Internationally, Burnet was a {{chairman}} of the Papua New Guinea Medical Research Advisory Committee between 1962 and 1969. At the time, Papua New Guinea was an Australian territory, and Burnet had first travelled there as his son was posted there. His role on the committee allowed him to explore his interest in <b>human</b> <b>biology.</b> He was particularly interested in kuru (laughing sickness), and lobbied the Australian government to establish the Papua New Guinea Institute of <b>Human</b> <b>Biology.</b> Burnet later helped oversee the institute's contribution to the Anglo-Australian participation in the International Biological Programme in the Field of Human Adaptability.|$|E
5|$|The Swedish Wasa {{station and}} the Finnish Aboa station {{together}} make up the Nordenskiöld Base, and cooperate in research and logistics. Research carried out includes geodesy/mapping, glaciology, <b>human</b> <b>biology,</b> meteorological observations, geology and geophysics.|$|E
5|$|Following his {{resignation}} from the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, Burnet was offered an {{office at the}} University of Melbourne in the School of Microbiology. While at the university, he wrote 13 books {{on a variety of}} topics including immunology, ageing and cancer, and <b>human</b> <b>biology.</b> He also wrote an autobiography entitled Changing Patterns: An Atypical Autobiography, which was released in 1968. In all, he wrote a further 16 books after his retirement from the Hall Institute. He was known for his ability to write quickly, often without a final draft, and his ability to convey a message to readers from a wide spectrum of backgrounds, but he was himself sceptical that his opinions had much influence. In 1969 he published Cellular Immunology, considered his magnum opus on immunity, attempted to show how various phenomena could be predicted by the clonal selection theory. The following year, he wrote Immunological Surveillance, which expounded his established opinion that mammals could immunise themselves through their ability to detect foreign patterns in the body. He continued to maintain an intense and focused work schedule, often shunning others to keep up a heavy writing load.|$|E

25|$|Biogerontologist Marios Kyriazis {{suggested}} that biological immortality in humans is an inevitable consequence of natural evolution.

25|$|Many {{proteins}} {{important in}} <b>human</b> <b>biology</b> were first discovered by studying their homologs in yeast; these proteins include cell cycle proteins, signaling proteins, and protein-processing enzymes.

25|$|Later that year, Rainer {{retired from}} teaching, having {{reached the age}} limit.

25|$|Canine compulsions {{are more}} common in some breeds and {{behavioral}} dispositions are often shared within the same litter. This {{suggests that there is}} a genetic factor to the disorder. A questionnaire to dog owners and a blood sample of 181 dogs from four breeds, miniature and standard bull terriers, German shepherds, and Staffordshire bull terriers showed these to be more susceptible to compulsive and repetitive behaviors. It is suggested that the more we learn through studying OCD in dogs, the more we can to understand <b>human</b> <b>biology</b> and the genetics involved in the heredity of susceptibility to disorders such as OCD.|$|E
25|$|In 2015, {{multiple}} studies {{attempted to}} systematically disable each individual human gene, {{in an attempt}} to identify which genes were essential to <b>human</b> <b>biology.</b> Between 1,600 and 1,800 genes passed this test—of the 20,000 or so known human genes. Such genes are more strongly activated, and unlikely to carry disabling mutations. They {{are more likely to have}} indispensable counterparts in other species. They build proteins that unite to form larger collaborative complexes. The studies also catalogued the essential genes in four cancer-cell lines and identified genes that are expendable in healthy cells, but crucial in specific tumor types and drugs that could target these rogue genes.|$|E
25|$|Biomedical Scientists are not {{confined}} to NHS laboratories. Biomedical Scientists along with scientists in other inter-related medical disciplines seek out to understand human anatomy, genetics, immunology, physiology and behaviour at all levels. This is sometimes achieved {{through the use of}} model systems that are homologous to various aspects of <b>human</b> <b>biology.</b> The research that is carried out either in Universities or Pharmaceutical companies by Biomedical Scientists has {{led to the development of}} new treatments for a wide range of degenerative and genetic disorders. Stem cell biology, cloning, genetic screening/therapies and other areas of biomedical science have all been generated by the work of Biomedical Scientists from around the world.|$|E

25|$|Most {{aspects of}} <b>human</b> <b>biology</b> involve both genetic ({{inherited}}) and non-genetic (environmental) factors. Some inherited variation influences {{aspects of our}} biology that are not medical in nature (height, eye color, ability to taste or smell certain compounds, etc.). Moreover, some genetic disorders only cause disease {{in combination with the}} appropriate environmental factors (such as diet). With these caveats, genetic disorders may be described as clinically defined diseases caused by genomic DNA sequence variation. In the most straightforward cases, the disorder can be associated with variation in a single gene. For example, cystic fibrosis is caused by mutations in the CFTR gene, and is the most common recessive disorder in caucasian populations with over 1,300 different mutations known.|$|E
25|$|In a paper {{delivered}} to the Australasian Society for <b>Human</b> <b>Biology</b> in 2009, Colin Groves and Catharine FitzGerald compared the Flores bones with those of ten people who had had cretinism, focusing on anatomical features which are typical of the disease. They found no overlap, and stated that they had put the claim to rest. However, an article by Oxnard, Obendorf and Kefford rejects Groves and FitzGerald's argument and revives the cretinism hypothesis. Oxnard and colleagues also criticise the cladistic analysis of Argue et al. (2009), stating {{that it is not}} logically possible for the analysis to conclude that the Liang Bua remains represent a separate species and not a pathology because the cladistics analysis assumes that they do not represent a pathology.|$|E
25|$|This {{process is}} {{distinct}} {{from the use of}} imaging to delineate targets and organs in the planning process of radiation therapy. However, there is clearly a connection between the imaging processes as IGRT relies directly on the imaging modalities from planning as the reference coordinates for localizing the patient. The variety of medical imaging technologies used in planning includes x-ray computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and positron emission tomography (PET) among others. The precision of IGRT is significantly improved when N-localizer technology is used in conjunction with these medical imaging technologies. Through advancements in imaging technology, combined with a further understanding of <b>human</b> <b>biology</b> at the molecular level, the impact of IGRT on radiotherapy treatment continues to evolve.|$|E
