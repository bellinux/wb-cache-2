Media Factory-owned anime {{has been the subject of}} debate over the validity of <b>fansubbing</b> practice. Proponents believe School Rumble would have more quickly received an English license had fansubs been allowed to circulate more freely, generating viewer interest.|$|E
5000|$|However, {{with the}} digital age {{at the start of}} 2000, each step of the <b>fansubbing</b> process was made easier and cheaper with a {{dramatic}} improvement to the visual standards of fansubs. Lee described English <b>fansubbing</b> as having been rapidly globalized over the years in terms of viewership. Lee states that it was the rise of peer-to-peer file sharing software BitTorrent that [...] "put <b>fansubbing</b> on the map internationally". Lee states that while other language communities exist, the English language <b>fansubbing</b> community has the greatest pull. US publishers traditionally found <b>fansubbing</b> useful for testing demand and broadening their fanbase, whereas Japanese publishers treat <b>fansubbing</b> as something remote and insignificant. Lee states that some Japanese producers even praise fansubber's efforts at promoting their work overseas. However {{at the turn of the}} new millennium in the face of fans' demands for greater immediacy, temporal and spatial disparity in overseas licensing, English as the internationally preferred medium for fansubs, and the increasingly globalized membership of the English <b>fansubbing</b> community, <b>fansubbing</b> groups are becoming less and less willing to follow the unspoken rule. Some fansubbers state that they don't want to abandon the rest of the world because someone bought the region 1 license.|$|E
50|$|On December 7, 2004, a Tokyo {{law firm}} {{representing}} Media Factory sent letters and e-mails to the anime BitTorrent directory AnimeSuki and fansub groups Lunar Anime and Wannabe Fansubs requesting that they halt the <b>fansubbing</b> and hosting of all {{current and future}} <b>fansubbing</b> productions. AnimeSuki and Lunar Anime complied, and shortly after, other fansub groups such as Solar and Shining Fansubs followed suit. Despite the request, Wannabe Fansubs {{and a handful of}} other <b>fansubbing</b> groups continued to produce fansubs of MFI anime series. To date, this has been one of the few legal actions taken by a Japanese anime company against <b>fansubbing.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Hatcher {{states that}} {{copyright}} {{law does not}} condone <b>fansubs.</b> The Berne Convention, international copyright treaty, states that its signatories—including Japan—grant authors exclusive right to translation. Hatcher states that <b>fansubs</b> could [...] "potentially" [...] be legal within Japan {{given the nature of}} Japan's domestic copyright laws, however since the target audience of <b>fansubs</b> are the non-Japanese market. However Hatcher states that copyright law in the United States—the frame of reference for most online discussions of <b>fansub</b> legality—construes translations as derivative, and <b>fansubs</b> infringe on the author's right to prepare derivative works and to reproduction by copying original source material.|$|R
50|$|Larger clubs {{can have}} {{multiple}} viewing rooms. Usually one room features localized anime {{and the other}} <b>fansubs.</b> The <b>fansub</b> room can also {{be known as the}} 'divx' room, named after the popular video codec.|$|R
50|$|In the mid-2000s, most <b>fansubs</b> were {{distributed}} through IRC channels, file hosting services and BitTorrent. In recent years most groups have shifted from using IRC to being primarily BitTorrent. BitTorrent trackers dedicated to anime <b>fansub</b> releases allow fans to easily find the latest releases, and individual <b>fansub</b> groups often {{use their own}} websites to inform fans of new releases. Because of an almost complete de-emphasis on CD-R and DVD-R distribution, file size standards are less frequently followed.|$|R

5000|$|Fan {{translation}} of audiovisual material, particularly <b>fansubbing</b> of anime, {{dates back to}} the 1980s. O'Hagan (2009) argues that <b>fansubbing</b> emerged as a form of protest over [...] "the official often over-edited versions of anime typically aired in dubbed form on television networks outside Japan" [...] and that fans sought more authentic translated versions in a shorter time frame.|$|E
50|$|The {{internet}} {{allows for}} highly collaborative <b>fansubbing,</b> and {{each member of}} a fansub team may only complete one task. Online <b>fansubbing</b> communities are able to release a fully subtitled episode (including elaborate karaoke with translation, kana, and kanji for songs, as well as additional remarks and translations of signs) within 24 hours of an episode's debut in Japan.|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 1990s and early 2000s, <b>fansubs</b> in {{electronic}} form were primarily distributed like VHS and Beta tapes: via mailed CD-Rs. Many fans {{did not have}} high speed Internet and were unable to download large files. Many of the early digital <b>fansubs</b> were made from regular tape subs.|$|R

5000|$|Odex's {{subtitling}} {{has been}} criticized by the Singapore anime community for having font with lower quality and sometimes inaccurate translations, as compared to <b>fansubs</b> or imports. Allegations {{were made by the}} online community that Odex had passed off <b>fansubs</b> as its own work. Sing admitted that this was partially true as Odex had hired anime fans to do subtitling in 2004 who had taken [...] "the easy way out and copied word for word the subtitles on <b>fansubs</b> they downloaded". Sing explained that when Odex released its anime, the company did not realise what the anime fans had done, and it has been [...] "paying for this mistake ever since". It was reported {{at the same time that}} all of Odex's translation and subtitling was now done [...] "in house". However, Odex's release of The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya in September 2007 was found to contain translations strongly resembling an earlier unauthorised <b>fansub</b> release.|$|R

50|$|The {{first known}} fansub {{documented}} at the Rising Sun {{chapter of the}} C/FO was in 1986 of a Lupin III episode produced the Commodore Amiga, marking {{the introduction of the}} formula for the process of <b>fansubbing.</b> However <b>fansubbing</b> was extremely expensive at this time (on the order of $4000 in 1986 and over one hundred hours). There were a few ventures into subtitling in the late 1980s; Leonard labels the fansub of the first two episodes of Ranma 1/2 in May 1989 as the earliest, widely distributed fansub.|$|E
50|$|In 2003, a <b>fansubbing</b> {{group known}} as Anime Junkies was {{involved}} in a conflict with the licensor and co-producer of the Ninja Scroll TV, Urban Vision's even provided the pitch to Madhouse to create the series. Urban Vision sent a letter asking for Anime Junkies to stop hosting the licensed material, but Anime Junkies did not comply with the request and responded negatively to Urban Vision. Christopher Macdonald, an editor at Anime News Network, highlighted the ethics code of the <b>fansubbing</b> community and asked that fans not support Anime Junkies {{as a result of their}} actions.|$|E
5000|$|Intellectual {{property}} lawyer Jordan Hatcher situates <b>fansubs</b> on {{the boundary}} between the desirable dojinshi fan culture and the [...] "massive online file trading so vilified by the recording and motion picture industries". Legal scholar Lawrence Lessig states that the re-working of culture—remix—is necessary to cultural growth and points to doujinshi in Japan {{as an example of how}} permitting more remix can contribute to a vibrant cultural industry. However Hatcher states that <b>fansubs</b> do not match this type of remix because their aim is to remain faithful to the original. Furthermore, Hatcher states that <b>fansubs</b> compete with the original cultural product since they have the potential to replace the market need for official translations and thus resemble the debate over peer-to-peer file trading.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Fansub</b> opposers {{claim that}} Japanese {{licensors}} have reportedly grown discontent with fansubbers because {{the ease of}} access with which their works are obtained has begun to affect foreign licensees' willingness to license a series, {{as evidenced by the}} Western market's sharp drop in new acquisitions in 2005. They also suggest that anime fans in Japan have reportedly begun to turn to English <b>fansubs</b> which often appear days after a show's release, affecting sales in their home market. Indeed, Japanese companies have banded together to form JASRAC, a copyright holders' rights company, which has frequently taken YouTube to task for providing content which domestic Japanese viewers often use, which includes <b>fansubs,</b> as seen on their official site. A growing anti-fansub stance has been taken by US distributors, as seen in Geneon and ADV's comments at the State of the Industry Panel at Anime Boston, as well as recent comments by Matt Greenfield of ADV Films at Anime Central: ...|$|R
50|$|The {{practice}} of making fansubs is called <b>fansubbing</b> and {{is done by}} a fansubber. Fansubbers typically form groups and divide the work up. The first distribution media of fansubbed material was VHS and Betamax tapes.|$|E
50|$|Henry Jenkins {{states that}} <b>fansubbing</b> has a {{positive}} impact on the anime industry through its function as publicity. However, as the internet grew in availability and speed, fansub groups were able to host and distribute fansubs online easily. The advent of BitTorrent as opposed to IRC has been pointed to as a key ingredient in the current <b>fansubbing</b> scene. It has been argued that this prompted fans to ignore official releases altogether, and some websites started charging for easier downloading rates. Many anime shows make their debut outside of Japan's shores in electronic format, and it is rare that a popular anime will go without fansubs.|$|E
5000|$|Aegisub [...] {{is a free}} {{open-source}} cross-platform subtitle editing program. It is extensively used in <b>fansubbing,</b> {{the practice}} of creating or translating unofficial, noncommercial subtitles for visual media by fans. It is the successor of the original SubStation Alpha and Sabbu.|$|E
5000|$|The {{production}} of a <b>fansub</b> typically begins with obtaining the unsubtitled source video called a [...] "raw" [...] that typically comes from DVDs, VHS tapes, television broadcasts, peer-to-peer networks, and directly from Japanese-based contacts. Then a translator watches the video and produces a time-stamped text file of the screenplay with any relevant notes. The same series or episode may be subtitled by multiple groups with independent translations of varying quality. <b>Fansub</b> groups sometimes translate other already translated <b>fansubs</b> that {{are more susceptible to}} more errors. Translated text is assigned with start and end times in a process known as timing to ensure subtitles appear when dialogue is spoken and disappear with the silence. [...] An editor and a translation checker reads over the script to ensure that English is natural and coherent while still retaining the original meaning. A typesetter then appearance for the dialogue, signs, translator notes, etc. Then groups perform quality control to catch any final errors.|$|R
50|$|Typically anime clubs exhibit {{shows in}} their {{original}} Japanese language track with English subtitles. Dependent upon policy of the club, anime <b>fansubs,</b> official subtitling, or localized dubs can be shown.|$|R
50|$|Crunchyroll {{started in}} 2006 as a for-profit video upload and {{streaming}} site that specialized in hosting East Asian video content. Some {{of the content}} hosted on Crunchyroll included <b>fansubbed</b> versions of East Asian shows.|$|R
50|$|Early <b>fansubbing</b> and fandubbing efforts {{involved}} {{manipulation of}} VHS tapes, which was time-consuming and expensive. The first reported fansub {{produced in the}} United States was Lupin III, produced in the mid-1980s, which required an average of 100 hours per episode to subtitle.|$|E
50|$|In <b>fansubbing</b> terms, Aegisub is {{used for}} translating, timing, editing, typesetting, quality checking, karaoke timing and karaoke effecting. Although, many groups use {{different}} tools {{for some of those}} steps, such as Adobe After Effects for typesetting, or a simple text editor for translation.|$|E
50|$|The Combined Community Codec Pack, more {{commonly}} referred to as the CCCP, is a collected archive of codecs (video compression filters) packed for Microsoft Windows, designed originally for the playback of anime fansubs. The CCCP is developed and maintained by members of various <b>fansubbing</b> groups.|$|E
25|$|The {{industry}} has been subject to both praise and condemnation for <b>fansubs,</b> the addition of unlicensed and unauthorized subtitled translations of anime series or films. <b>Fansubs,</b> which were originally distributed on VHS bootlegged cassettes in the 1980s, have been freely available and disseminated online since the 1990s. Since this practice raises concerns for copyright and piracy issues, fansubbers tend to adhere to an unwritten moral code to destroy or no longer distribute an anime once an official translated or subtitled version becomes licensed. They also try to encourage viewers to buy an official copy of the release once it comes out in English, although <b>fansubs</b> typically continue to circulate through file sharing networks. Even so, the laid back regulations of the Japanese animation industry tends to overlook these issues, allowing it to grow underground and thus increasing the popularity {{until there is a}} demand for official high quality releases for animation companies. This has led to an increase in global popularity with Japanese animations, reaching $40 million in sales in 2004.|$|R
5000|$|All {{versions}} of the anime releases have been extensively reviewed, beginning with an undated prerelease <b>fansub</b> review. [...] The reviews range from [...] "D-" [...] for the story, to [...] "B" [...] for the art and music.|$|R
50|$|On August 19, 2008 Funimation, on the {{behalf of}} d-rights, sent {{cease and desist}} orders to the <b>fansub</b> groups who were {{subtitling}} the series, to prevent copyright infringement, although the company did not have licensing rights at the time.|$|R
5000|$|The One Piece film {{at issue}} was a fansub, an {{unauthorized}} copy distributed with fan-produced, translated subtitles. Soon after {{the lawsuit was}} abandoned, Funimation {{was reported to have}} long been deriving dubs from fansubs. Funimation nevertheless maintains that <b>fansubbing</b> is harmful to the anime industry, stating [...] "The practices of illegal downloads and <b>fansubbing</b> are very harmful to our Japanese partners and ... we have been asked to monitor and take action against unauthorized distribution of these titles. Because we believe that this will benefit the industry, we have agreed to do so." [...] Sites which distribute fansubs or separate fan-created subtitles remain a frequent target of civil actions by Funimation and other anime companies, as well as criminal prosecution in at least one case.|$|E
50|$|<b>Fansubbing</b> - The {{subtitling}} of movies, television programs, {{video games}} and other audiovisual media by a network of fans. For many languages, the most popular fan subtitling is of Hollywood movies and American TV dramas, while fansubs into English are largely of East Asian entertainment, particularly anime and tokusatsu.|$|E
50|$|Recently, a few titles such as Street Fighter Alpha: Generations were prelicensed, {{meaning that}} they were {{released}} simultaneously in Japan and North America, {{in an effort to}} negate the need for fansubs. However, some <b>fansubbing</b> of such titles still occurs, as some people prefer fansubs over commercial releases.|$|E

5000|$|After MFI's {{request was}} made public, only Genshiken, whose <b>fansubs</b> had been {{completed}} before the notifications, and Kimi ga Nozomu Eien were licensed in the US. MFI's other major projects, including Pugyuru and Akane Maniax, were not picked up by American distributors. The lack of buzz that surrounded these titles has been linked by <b>fansub</b> supporters to MFI's suppression of fan distribution. They argue that by cutting off this means of [...] "free advertisement," [...] MFI has alienated fans who would normally buy their products after they were licensed and kept the shows from being as widely exposed as they might otherwise be. The end result, say <b>fansub</b> supporters, is a reduced interest from American anime companies {{and a loss of}} revenue for the studio. However, in August 2006, School Rumble was finally licensed by Funimation thanks to popularity of the series garnered from its manga release by Del Rey. It took the series over 2 years to be licensed, which was normal for anime licenses around 2002. Since MFI's legal action against fansubbers, their number of licenses secured is below the industry average.|$|R
