40|$|This article {{discusses}} some of {{the changes}} in the connections of the <b>European-Latin</b> <b>American</b> migration system over the past decades. First, we analyse the changing trends and re-routing of the flows between the two ends of the system. Then, we address the complex rearrangements of immigration policies, which in both spaces are again beginning to turn inwards. Lastly, we briefly review the partnerships that are being established between Europe and Latin America via Spain. Within this framework, we wonder whether we are entering a new phase of the globalisation of migration, the dynamic of which is a pendulum with global and regional effects. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} whether the dynamic integration across a large set of developed and emerging Islamic stock markets allows potential diversification benefits in tranquil and turmoil periods. Using the multivariate cointegration test, we find the presence of long-run equilibrium relationship among Islamic stock markets of similar economic grouping. While, Islamic stock markets from different economic grouping are partially segmented. Empirical results of estimated Vector Error Correction Model provide a lowest level of short run integration among the economic grouping of European-Asian emerging markets, MENA-Latin <b>American</b> and <b>European-Latin</b> <b>American</b> Islamic stock markets. In addition, the level of integration and causality relations among Islamic stock markets tends to change over time, mainly during periods characterized by financial crises. Overall, our results suggest that Shariah compliant stocks could offer potential diversification benefits by considering different economic grouping such as that in developed and emerging countries...|$|R

40|$|The {{growth of}} fast internet, {{including}} the recent advance on using PLC (Power Line Communication) for reaching rural and remote areas in Brazil, and the state-of-the-art of image compression methods allowed rapid teleconsultations and medical training based on medical images. At the present time, {{one of the}} challenging problems in telemedicine is the real-time teleconsultation in case of emergency and for the medical training at remote regions where the internet access is precarious. In this paper, we present the kick-off of the applied project PO@Health, which merges the <b>European-Latin</b> <b>American</b> T@lemed Project (telemedicine based on ultrasound images) and the Brazilian PLC Restinga Project (communication via Power Line in a remote district). The platform used for medical teleconsultations and residents training is able to perform both on-line (in real-time) and off-line image-based teleconsultations over the Internet connection. For the ultrasound cases, the platform is being adapted {{to work with the}} DICOM medical images synchronized with the physician hand position images of the examination in order to increase the diagnosis precision. In addition, we describe the hybrid network over PLC that is being used by the telemedical platform...|$|R
