The band favoured the idea of setting up a makeshift studio in a condemned warehouse in Fortitude Valley, affectionately named [...] "The Dirty Room" [...] by the band. In contrast with their rock-oriented works of the past, the band moved on with a more electronic and pop based sound on their second <b>effort</b> <b>Unit.</b> The band openly acknowledged their stylistic change with the album's opening track, ironically titled [...] "I Like Your Old Stuff Better Than Your New Stuff". The band released [...] "Everyday Formula" [...] as the first single, with Yeomans and Magoo later admitting it was a conscious decision to ease their fans into the new sound with a heavier track. The single made a lacklustre impact compared with the following pop and keyboard style of the following singles, which were instant hits. From this album, [...] "Polyester Girl", [...] "! (The Song Formerly Known As)" [...] (an homage to 1980s era Prince_), and [...] "Black Bugs" [...] (an homage to 1980s synth pop) all gained significant amounts of airplay. Unit is Regurgitator's most commercially successful album, going platinum three times in Australia. Whilst it no doubt increased the popularity of the band, fans of their first generation of work are still divided in their responses to it. It is also considered to be ahead of its time due to heavy 1980s referencing, well ahead of the popularisation of 1980s aesthetics which occurred post-2000. Unit won 5 ARIA Music Awards in 1998, including Best Album and Producer of the Year.

40|$|Value {{achieved}} {{from time}} spent at sea {{is a central}} driver of fishing decisions and fishing behaviors. Value per unit effort (VPUE) is an important indicator of economic performance in itself and a useful metric within integrated mixed fisheries models. A time series of Irish first sale prices and total per trip landings values (VPT) highlight heterogeneity in fish prices and VPTs achieved by the Irish fleet spatially and temporally, as well as variability with species targeting. This investigation compared models to standardize fishing trip VPUE accounting for species targeting (métier groupings), engine power (a kW proxy for vessel size), seasonal and annual variability, fishing effort, and individual vessels (encompassing variability in vessel characteristics and skipper effects). Linear mixed effects models incorporating random vessel effects and within-group variance between métier groupings performed best at describing the variability in the dataset. All investigated factors were important in explaining variability, and thus important in standardizing VPUE. Models incorporating fishing days (days with reported fishing activity) and engine power as separate variables resulted in improved AIC values. Therefore, fishing days {{were considered to be}} the most appropriate effort measure to generate VPUE.

40|$|Con el fin de obtener una aproximación a la estructura del ensamblaje de peces cartilaginosos extraídos por la flota de arrastre camaronero en la costa norte de Colombia, se evaluó la composición y abundancia de tiburones y rayas descartados en dos sectores del Caribe colombiano, entre agosto y noviembre de 2004. Mensualmente se analizaron lances de la flota de arrastre camaronero al {{interior}} de cada sector (norte: La Virgen y Portete; sur: Barú, cabo Tiburón, Cascajal, Cispatá, Morrosquillo, Ceycén, Mestizo, río Cedro, Tigua y Tortuguilla). Observadores a bordo de la flota comercial de arrastre camaronero muestrearon 1 / 5 de la captura previamente homogenizada, tomada al azar de una de las cuatro redes de la embarcación. En 30 lances se registró la presencia de 47 peces cartilaginosos, correspondientes a seis familias y ocho especies. La mayor Captura por Unidad de Esfuerzo (CPUE) en términos de biomasa se registró en ambas zonas durante septiembre, la menor en noviembre en la zona sur; el mayor valor del número de individuos se presentó en septiembre en la zona sur y el menor en noviembre, lo cual puede atribuirse a la mayor disponibilidad del recurso objetivo que está asociado al periodo de mayores lluvias que enriquece las aguas de los ambientes costeros y son usados como hábitat y zonas de alimentación por los peces cartilaginosos. In {{order to}} have an approximation to the cartilaginous fishes assemblage structure exploited by commercial shrimp trawlers from the north coast of Colombia, composition and abundance of the discarded sharks and rays on two zones of theColombian Caribbean, between August and November of 2004 were evaluated. Each month, a number of trawls were analyzed in each zone (north: La Virgen and Portete; south: Barú, Cabo Tiburón, Cascajal, Cispatá, Morrosquillo, Ceycén, Mestizo, Cedro river, Tigua and Tortuguilla). Observers were placed on board commercial shrimp trawlers, sampling 1 / 5 from the total  capture, previously homogenized, which was randomly taken {{from one of the}} four nets of the vessel. Within 30 trawls, there were 47 cartilaginous fishes registered, belonging to six families and eight species. The largest capture per <b>effort</b> <b>unit</b> (CPUE) in biomass was registered on September in both zones,whereas the smallest happened on November in the south one.

40|$|The {{management}} of combustion dynamics in gas turbine combustors {{has become more}} challenging as strict NOx/CO emission standards have led to engine operation in a narrow, lean regime. While premixed or partially premixed combustor configurations such as the Lean Premixed Pre-vaporized (LPP), Rich Quench Lean burn (RQL), and Lean Direct Injection (LDI) have shown a potential for reduced NOx emissions, they promote a coupling between acoustics, hydrodynamics and combustion {{that can lead to}} combustion instabilities. These couplings can be quite complex, and their detailed understanding is a pre-requisite to any engine development program and for the development of predictive capability for combustion instabilities through high-fidelity models. ^ The overarching goal of this project is to assess the capability of high-fidelity simulation to predict combustion dynamics in low-emissions gas turbine combustors. A prototypical lean-direct-inject combustor was designed in a modular configuration so that a suitable geometry could be found by test. The combustor comprised a variable length air plenum and combustion chamber, air swirler, and fuel nozzle located inside a subsonic venturi. The venturi cross section and the fuel nozzle were consistent with previous studies. ^ Test pressure was 1 MPa and variables included geometry and acoustic resonance, inlet temperatures, equivalence ratio, and type of liquid fuel. High-frequency pressure measurements in a well-instrumented metal chamber yielded frequencies and mode shapes as a function of inlet air temperature, equivalence ratio, fuel nozzle placement, and combustor acoustic resonances. The parametric survey was a significant effort, with over 105 tests on eight geometric configurations. A good dataset was obtained {{that could be used for}} both operating-point-dependent quantitative comparisons, and testing the ability of the simulation to predict more global trends. ^ Results showed a very strong dependence of instability amplitude on the geometric configuration of the combustor, i. e., its acoustic resonance characteristics, with measured pressure fluctuation amplitudes ranged from 5 kPa (0. 5 % of mean pressure) to 200 kPa (~ 20 % of mean pressure) depending on combustor geometry. The stability behavior also showed a consistent and pronounced dependence on equivalence ratio and inlet air temperature. Instability amplitude increased with higher equivalence ratio and with lower inlet air temperature. A pronounced effect of fuel nozzle location on the combustion dynamics was also observed. Combustion instabilities with the fuel nozzle at the throat of the venturi throat were stronger than in the configuration with fuel nozzle 2. 6 mm upstream of the nozzle. ^ A second set of dynamics data was based on high-response-rate laser-based combustion diagnostics using an optically accessible combustor section. High-frequency measurements of OH*-chemiluminescence and OH-PLIF and velocity fields using PIV were obtained at a relatively stable, low equivalence ratio case and a less stable case at higher equivalence ratio. PIV measurements were performed at 5 kHz for non-reacting flow but glare from the cylindrical quartz chamber limited the field of view to a small region in the combustor. ^ Quantitative and qualitative comparisons were made for five different combinations of geometry and operating condition that yielded discriminating stability behavior in the experiment with simulations that were carried out concurrently. Comparisons were made on the basis of trends and pressure mode data as well as with OH-PLIF measurements for the baseline geometry at equivalence ratios of 0. 44 and 0. 6. Overall, the ability of the simulation to match experimental data and trends was encouraging. Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) analysis was performed on two sets of computations - a global 2 -step chemistry mechanism and an 18 -step chemistry mechanism - and the OH-PLIF images to allow comparison of dynamic patterns of heat release and OH distribution in the combustion zone. The DMD analysis was able to identify similar dominant unstable modes in the combustor. ^ Recommendations for future work are based on the continued requirement for quantitative and spatio-temporally resolved data for direct comparison with computational efforts to develop predictive capabilities for combustion instabilities at relevant operating conditions. Discriminating instability behavior for the prototypical combustor demonstrated in this study is critical for any robust validation <b>effort</b> <b>Unit</b> physics based scaling of the current effort to multi-element combustors along with improvement in diagnostic techniques and analysis efforts are recommended for advancement in understanding of the complex physics in the multi-phase, three dimensional and turbulent combustion processes in the LDI combustor. ...|$|E
