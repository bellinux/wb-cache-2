40|$|Nickel based {{superalloys}} have superior {{high temperature}} mechanical strength, corrosion and creep resistance in harsh environments and found {{applications in the}} hot sections as turbine blades and turbine discs in jet engines and <b>gas</b> <b>generator</b> <b>turbines</b> in the aerospace and energy industries. The efficiency of these turbine engines depends on the turbine inlet temperature, which {{is determined by the}} high temperature strength and behavior of these superalloys. The microstructure of nickel based superalloys usually contains coherently precipitated gamma prime (?) Ni 3 Al phase within the random solid solution of the gamma () matrix, with the ? phase being the strengthening phase of the superalloys. How the alloying elements partition into the and ? phases and especially in the site occupancy behaviors in the strengthening ? phases {{play a critical role in}} their high temperature mechanical behaviors. The goal of this dissertation is to study the site substitution behavior of the major alloying elements including Cr, Co and Ti through first principles based calculations. Site substitution energies have been calculated using the anti-site formation, the standard defect formation formalism, and the vacancy formation based formalism. Elements such as Cr and Ti were found to show strong preference for Al sublattice, whereas Co was found to have a compositionally dependent site preference. In addition, the interaction energies between Cr-Cr, Co-Co, Ti-Ti and Cr-Co atoms have also been determined. Along with the charge transfer, chemical bonding and alloy chemistry associated with the substitutions has been investigated by examining the charge density distributions and electronic density of states to explain the chemical nature of the site substitution. Results show that Cr and Co atoms prefer to be close by on either Al sublattice or on a Ni-Al mixed lattice, suggesting a potential tendency of Cr and Co segregation in the ? phase...|$|E

This document describes the design, installation, {{and operation of}} an improved measurement system for the aerothermodynamic flow path states in an Allison T 63 -A- 700 (C 250 - 18 civilian designation). Temperature measurements for the <b>gas</b> <b>generator</b> <b>turbine</b> and exhaust state points were evaluated and average values were calculated. The measurement uncertainty for airflow, fuel flow, and output power {{has been reduced to}} less than 3 %. State points match installation design data within 3 %. The digital scanning array has improved the accuracy of the pressure measurements and added the ability to measure pressure differences over time. The added bellmouth pressure sensors provide a redundant pressure measurement that is more accurate than the dynamometer system. The <b>gas</b> <b>generator</b> <b>turbine</b> inlet and exhaust temperature profiles have been measured and show that the temperature profile becomes less symmetrical with increasing air and fuel flow. The measurement values for the <b>gas</b> <b>generator</b> inlet temperature have been consolidated into a single value that is about 50 degrees different from expected values. The temperature profile at the power turbine inlet shows how the hot spot at the <b>gas</b> <b>generator</b> <b>turbine</b> inlet is affected by the swirl produced by the power turbine stages. The time resolved fluctuations in pressure between the compressor and <b>gas</b> <b>generator</b> <b>turbine</b> have been measured and show that compressor discharge and <b>gas</b> <b>generator</b> <b>turbine</b> inlet pressures are similar.

50|$|Turboshaft {{engines are}} often used to drive {{compression}} trains (for example in gas pumping stations or natural gas liquefaction plants) and are used to power almost all modern helicopters. The primary shaft bears the compressor and the high speed turbine (often {{referred to as the}} Gas Generator), while a second shaft bears the low-speed turbine (a power turbine or free-wheeling turbine on helicopters, especially, because the <b>gas</b> <b>generator</b> <b>turbine</b> spins separately from the power turbine). In effect the separation of the <b>gas</b> <b>generator,</b> by a fluid coupling (the hot energy-rich combustion gases), from the power turbine is analogous to an automotive transmission's fluid coupling.

40|$|It {{is pointed}} out that in certain {{emergency}} situations it may be desirable to obtain power from a helicopter engine at levels greater than the maximum rating. Yost (1976) has reported studies concerning methods of power augmentation in the one engine inoperative (OEI) case.

40|$|Because {{of their}} {{superior}} high-temperature properties, <b>gas</b> <b>generator</b> <b>turbine</b> airfoils made of single-crystal, nickel-base superalloys are fast becoming the standard equipment on today's advanced, high-performance aerospace engines.

However, the previously developed methodologies for life-prediction models are based on experience with polycrystalline alloys and may not be applicable to single-crystal alloys under certain operating conditions. One of the main areas where behavior differences between single-crystal and polycrystalline alloys are readily apparent is subcritical fatigue crack growth (FCG).

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{performance evaluation}} {{was made of}} two movable sidewall variable area radial turbines. The turbine designs were representative of the <b>gas</b> <b>generator</b> <b>turbine</b> of a variable flow capacity rotorcraft engine. The first turbine was an uncooled design while the second turbine had a cooled nozzle but an uncooled rotor. The cooled nozzle turbine was evaluated both with and without coolant flow.

Peak efficiencies of the second turbine with and without nozzle coolant were 86. 5 and 88 percent respectively. These values are comparable to pivoting vane variable geometry turbines; however, the decrease in efficiency as the flow was varied from the design value was much less for the movable wall turbine. Several design improvements which should increase the turbine efficiency one or two more points are identified. These design improvements include reduced leakage losses and relocation of the vane coolant ejection holes to reduce mainstream disturbance...|$|R

40|$|For the {{development}} of a Heavy Lift Launch Vehicle (HLLV) several engines with different operating cycles and using LOX/Hydrocarbon propellants are presently being examined. Some concepts utilize hydrogen for thrust chamber wall cooling followed by a <b>gas</b> <b>generator</b> <b>turbine</b> drive cycle with subsequent dumping of H 2 /O 2 combustion products into the nozzle downstream of the throat. In the Space Transportation Booster Engine (STBE) selection process the specific impulse {{will be one of the}} optimization criteria; however, the current performance prediction programs do not have the capability to include a third propellant in this process, nor to account for the effect of dumping the gas-generator product tangentially inside the nozzle. The purpose is to describe a computer program for accurately predicting the performance of such an engine. The code consists of two modules; one for the inviscid performance, and the other for the viscous loss. For the first module, the two-dimensional kinetics program (TDK) was modified to account for tripropellant chemistry, and for the effect of tangential slot injection. For the viscous loss, the Mass Addition Boundary Layer program (MABL) was modified to include the effects of the boundary layer-shear layer interaction, and tripropellant chemistry.
