To date, these instruments have provided qualitative descriptions of aerosols, {{in part because the}} fraction of particles actually present in the atmosphere that is detected by these instruments has not been known. In this work, the particle <b>detection</b> <b>efficiencies</b> of three ATOFMS instruments are determined under ambient sampling conditions from the results of colocated sampling with more conventional reference samplers at three locations in southern California.
