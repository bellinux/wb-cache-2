5|$|A Chebyshev {{response}} {{simultaneously in}} the passband and stopband is possible, such as Cauer's equal ripple <b>elliptic</b> filter.|$|E
5|$|Darlington relates that {{he found}} in the New York City library Carl Jacobi's {{original}} paper on <b>elliptic</b> functions, published in Latin in 1829. In this paper Darlington {{was surprised to find}} foldout tables of the exact <b>elliptic</b> function transformations needed for Chebyshev approximations of both Cauer's image parameter, and Darlington's insertion-loss filters.|$|E
5|$|<b>Elliptic</b> {{filters are}} filters {{produced}} by the insertion-loss method which use <b>elliptic</b> rational functions in their transfer function as an approximation to the ideal filter response {{and the result is}} called a Chebyshev approximation. This is the same Chebyshev approximation technique used by Cauer on image filters but follows the Darlington insertion-loss design method and uses slightly different <b>elliptic</b> functions. Cauer had some contact with Darlington and Bell Labs before WWII (for a time he worked in the US) but during the war they worked independently, in some cases making the same discoveries. Cauer had disclosed the Chebyshev approximation to Bell Labs but had not left them with the proof. Sergei Schelkunoff provided this and a generalisation to all equal ripple problems. <b>Elliptic</b> filters are a general class of filter which incorporate several other important classes as special cases: Cauer filter (equal ripple in passband and stopband), Chebyshev filter (ripple only in passband), reverse Chebyshev filter (ripple only in stopband) and Butterworth filter (no ripple in either band).|$|E
5|$|Partial {{differential}} equations {{can be classified}} by considering the matrix of coefficients of the highest-order differential operators of the equation. For <b>elliptic</b> partial {{differential equations}} this matrix is positive definite, which has decisive influence {{on the set of}} possible solutions of the equation in question.|$|E
5|$|The {{spore print}} is {{cinnamon}} or rusty brown. The spores are <b>elliptic,</b> smooth-walled, nonamyloid (not absorbing iodine when stained with Melzer's reagent), and measure 6.6–8 by 3.7–4.4μm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, and four-spored, with dimensions of 16–25 by 5–7μm.|$|E
5|$|Hilbert spaces {{allow for}} many <b>elliptic</b> partial {{differential}} equations to be formulated {{in a similar}} way, and the Lax–Milgram theorem is then a basic tool in their analysis. With suitable modifications, similar techniques {{can be applied to}} parabolic partial differential equations and certain hyperbolic partial differential equations.|$|E
5|$|Hilbert spaces form a basic tool in {{the study}} of partial {{differential}} equations. For many classes of partial differential equations, such as linear <b>elliptic</b> equations, it is possible to consider a generalized solution (known as a weak solution) by enlarging the class of functions. Many weak formulations involve the class of Sobolev functions, which is a Hilbert space. A suitable weak formulation reduces to a geometrical problem the analytic problem of finding a solution or, often what is more important, showing that a solution exists and is unique for given boundary data. For linear <b>elliptic</b> equations, one geometrical result that ensures unique solvability for a large class of problems is the Lax–Milgram theorem. This strategy forms the rudiment of the Galerkin method (a finite element method) for numerical solution of partial differential equations.|$|E
25|$|Besides the Legendre form given below, the <b>elliptic</b> {{integrals}} {{may also}} be expressed in Carlson symmetric form. Additional insight into {{the theory of the}} <b>elliptic</b> integral may be gained through the study of the Schwarz–Christoffel mapping. Historically, <b>elliptic</b> functions were discovered as inverse functions of <b>elliptic</b> integrals.|$|E
25|$|Incomplete <b>elliptic</b> {{integrals}} are {{functions of}} two arguments; complete <b>elliptic</b> integrals are functions {{of a single}} argument. These arguments are expressed {{in a variety of}} different but equivalent ways (they give the same <b>elliptic</b> integral). Most texts adhere to a canonical naming scheme, using the following naming conventions.|$|E
25|$|The {{modularity}} theorem – if proved for semi-stable <b>elliptic</b> curves – {{would mean}} that all semistable <b>elliptic</b> curves must be modular.|$|E
25|$|By definition, {{these are}} the {{surfaces}} X with constant curvature +1. The Riemann sphere C ∪ {∞} is the only example. (<b>Elliptic</b> functions are examples of parabolic Riemann surfaces. The naming comes from the history: <b>elliptic</b> functions are associated to <b>elliptic</b> integrals, which in turn show up in calculating the circumference of ellipses).|$|E
25|$|Example: If E is an <b>elliptic</b> {{curve and}} B is a curve of genus at least 2, then E×B is an <b>elliptic</b> surface of Kodaira {{dimension}} 1.|$|E
25|$|With Bott, Atiyah {{found an}} {{analogue}} of the Lefschetz fixed-point formula for <b>elliptic</b> operators, giving the Lefschetz number of an endomorphism of an <b>elliptic</b> complex {{in terms of}} a sum over the fixed points of the endomorphism. As special cases their formula included the Weyl character formula, and several new results about <b>elliptic</b> curves with complex multiplication, some of which were initially disbelieved by experts.|$|E
25|$|Given a {{composite}} integer n, {{the task of}} providing one (or all) prime factors {{is referred to as}} factorization of n. <b>Elliptic</b> curve factorization is an algorithm relying on arithmetic on an <b>elliptic</b> curve.|$|E
25|$|<b>Elliptic</b> curves can {{be defined}} over any field K; the formal {{definition}} of an <b>elliptic</b> curve is a non-singular projective algebraic curve over K with genus 1 with a given point defined over K.|$|E
25|$|An <b>elliptic</b> surface whose base curve B is of genus {{at least}} 2 always has Kodaira {{dimension}} 1, but the Kodaira dimension can be 1 also for some <b>elliptic</b> surfaces with B of genus 0 or 1.|$|E
25|$|Atiyah and Singer's first {{published}} proof used K-theory rather than cobordism. If i is any inclusion of compact manifolds from X to Y, they defined a 'pushforward' operation i! on <b>elliptic</b> operators of X to <b>elliptic</b> operators of Y that preserves the index. By taking Y {{to be some}} sphere that X embeds in, this reduces the index theorem {{to the case of}} spheres. If Y is a sphere and X is some point embedded in Y, then any <b>elliptic</b> operator on Y is the image under i! of some <b>elliptic</b> operator on the point. This reduces the index theorem to the case of a point, where it is trivial.|$|E
25|$|<b>Elliptic</b> curves {{carry the}} {{structure}} of an abelian group with the distinguished point as {{the identity of the}} group law. In a plane cubic model three points sum to zero in the group if and only if they are collinear. For an <b>elliptic</b> curve defined over the complex numbers the group is isomorphic to the additive group of the complex plane modulo the period lattice of the corresponding <b>elliptic</b> functions.|$|E
25|$|<b>Elliptic</b> curves over finite {{fields are}} notably applied in {{cryptography}} {{and for the}} factorization of large integers. These algorithms often {{make use of the}} group structure on the points of E. Algorithms that are applicable to general groups, for example the group of invertible elements in finite fields, F*q, can thus be applied to the group of points on an <b>elliptic</b> curve. For example, the discrete logarithm is such an algorithm. The interest in this is that choosing an <b>elliptic</b> curve allows for more flexibility than choosing q (and thus the group of units in Fq). Also, the group structure of <b>elliptic</b> curves is generally more complicated.|$|E
25|$|The {{index of}} an <b>elliptic</b> {{differential}} operator obviously vanishes if the operator is self adjoint. It also vanishes if the manifold X has odd dimension, {{though there are}} pseudodifferential <b>elliptic</b> operators whose index does not vanish in odd dimensions.|$|E
25|$|Curves with closed-form {{solutions}} for arc length include the catenary, circle, cycloid, logarithmic spiral, parabola, semicubical parabola and straight line. The {{lack of a}} closed form solution for the arc length of an <b>elliptic</b> arc {{led to the development}} of the <b>elliptic</b> integrals.|$|E
25|$|<b>Elliptic</b> curves are {{especially}} important in number theory, and constitute a major area of current research; for example, they {{were used in the}} proof, by Andrew Wiles, of Fermat's Last Theorem. They also find applications in <b>elliptic</b> curve cryptography (ECC) and integer factorization.|$|E
25|$|<b>Elliptic</b> {{geometry}} is a geometry {{in which}} Euclid's parallel postulate does not hold. <b>Elliptic</b> geometry is studied in two, three, or more dimensions. The appearance of this geometry {{in the nineteenth}} century stimulated the development of non-Euclidean geometry generally, including hyperbolic geometry.|$|E
25|$|For example, in {{the nineteenth}} century there was much {{interest}} in hyperelliptic integrals that may be expressed in terms of <b>elliptic</b> integrals. This comes down to asking that J is a product of <b>elliptic</b> curves, up to an isogeny.|$|E
25|$|Using {{the theory}} of <b>elliptic</b> functions, it can be shown that <b>elliptic</b> curves defined over the complex numbers {{correspond}} to embeddings of the torus into the complex projective plane. The torus is also an abelian group, and in fact this correspondence is also a group isomorphism.|$|E
25|$|Complex multiplication, {{a theory}} of <b>elliptic</b> curves.|$|E
25|$|The Atiyah–Singer theorem {{applies to}} <b>elliptic</b> pseudodifferential {{operators}} {{in much the}} same way as for <b>elliptic</b> differential operators. In fact, for technical reasons most of the early proofs worked with pseudodifferential rather than differential operators: their extra flexibility made some steps of the proofs easier.|$|E
25|$|In a work titled Euclides ab Omni Naevo Vindicatus (Euclid Freed from All Flaws), {{published}} in 1733, Saccheri quickly discarded <b>elliptic</b> geometry {{as a possibility}} (some others of Euclid's axioms must be modified for <b>elliptic</b> geometry to work) and set to work proving {{a great number of}} results in hyperbolic geometry.|$|E
25|$|Compared with a Chebyshev Type I/Type II filter or an <b>elliptic</b> filter, the Butterworth filter has {{a slower}} roll-off, and thus {{will require a}} higher order to {{implement}} a particular stopband specification, but Butterworth filters have a more linear phase response in the pass-band than Chebyshev Type I/Type II and <b>elliptic</b> filters can achieve.|$|E
25|$|In the {{specific}} situation {{of a number}} field and an <b>elliptic</b> curve with semi-stable reduction over it, IUT deals with various hyperbolic curves associated to the <b>elliptic</b> curve, over the number field and its completions, and with the full Galois and fundamental groups of associated objects, {{as well as with}} related enhanced categorical structures called Hodge theaters.|$|E
25|$|This {{integral}} is an <b>elliptic</b> integral of {{the second}} kind.|$|E

25|$|An {{important}} {{class of}} varieties, not easily understood directly from their defining equations, are the abelian varieties, {{which are the}} projective varieties whose points form an abelian group. The prototypical examples are the <b>elliptic</b> curves, which have a rich theory. They were instrumental in the proof of Fermat's last theorem and are also used in <b>elliptic</b> curve cryptography.|$|E
25|$|Around 1955, Japanese mathematicians Goro Shimura and Yutaka Taniyama {{observed}} a possible link between two apparently completely distinct branches of mathematics, <b>elliptic</b> curves and modular forms. The resulting modularity theorem (at the time {{known as the}} Taniyama–Shimura conjecture) states that every <b>elliptic</b> curve is modular, meaning {{that it can be}} associated with a unique modular form.|$|E
25|$|The Kolmogorov–Arnold–Moser (KAM) theorem {{gives the}} {{behavior}} near an <b>elliptic</b> point.|$|E
25|$|<b>Elliptic</b> {{regularity}} {{can now be}} used {{to deduce}} that f is smooth.|$|E
