40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to design a generalized architecture for polyphase <b>code</b> <b>identification</b> used in RADAR signal processing applications. The proposed VLSI architecture will identify the type of a given polyphase code, amount of phase change and number of phase changes. RADAR signal processing applications require a set of sequences with individually peaky autocorrelation and pair wise cross correlation. Obtaining such sequences is a combinatorial problem. This paper aims at implementation of an efficient VLSI system for the design of polyphase <b>codes</b> <b>identification</b> useful for RADAR applications. The VLSI system is implemented on the field programmable gate array as it provides the flexibility of reconfigurability and reprogrammability and it is a real time signal processing solution which identifies the polyphase codes. The simulation results and the FPGA implementation shows the successful <b>code</b> <b>identification,</b> amount of phase, number of phase changes for a given input sequence...|$|R
