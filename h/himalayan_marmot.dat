2500|$|After {{journeys}} to India and Pakistan, French ethnologist Michel Peissel {{claimed to}} have discovered an animal species that may illuminate {{one of the most}} bizarre passages in Herodotus's Histories. In Book 3, passages 102 to 105, Herodotus reports that a species of fox-sized, furry [...] "ants" [...] lives in one of the far eastern, Indian provinces of the Persian Empire. This region, he reports, is a sandy desert, and the sand there contains a wealth of fine gold dust. These giant ants, according to Herodotus, would often unearth the gold dust when digging their mounds and tunnels, and the people living in this province would then collect the precious dust. Peissel reports that, in an isolated region of northern Pakistan on the Deosai Plateau in Gilgit–Baltistan province, there is a species of marmot – the <b>Himalayan</b> <b>marmot,</b> a type of burrowing squirrel – that may have been what Herodotus called giant ants. The ground of the Deosai Plateau is rich in gold dust, much like the province that Herodotus describes. According to Peissel, he interviewed the Minaro tribal {{people who live in the}} Deosai Plateau, and they have confirmed that they have, for generations, been collecting the gold dust that the marmots bring to the surface when they are digging their underground burrows. Later authors such as Pliny the Elder mentioned this story in the gold mining section of his Naturalis Historia. [...] Peissel offers the theory that Herodotus may have confused the old Persian word for [...] "marmot" [...] with the word for [...] "mountain ant". Research suggests that Herodotus probably did not know any Persian (or any other language except his native Greek) and was forced to rely on many local translators when travelling in the vast multilingual Persian Empire. Herodotus did not claim to have personally seen the creatures which he described. Herodotus did, though, follow up in passage 105 of Book 3 with the claim that the [...] "ants" [...] are said to chase and devour full-grown camels.|$|E

Smaller mammals include <b>Himalayan</b> <b>marmots</b> (Marmota himalayana), weasels, and pikas.|$|R
5000|$|An {{increase}} {{in some small}} animal populations has led to some grasslands being degraded. [...] These animals include the <b>Himalayan</b> <b>marmots,</b> the Brandt’s and plateau vole, and the plateau pika and zokor. They damage this environment mainly through their burrowing {{into the ground and}} gnawing at the grass and other plants. Both of these actions encourage soil erosion and {{make it more difficult for}} plants to firmly ground themselves to this poor terrain. [...] Hence grass has a tougher time growing and the terrain becomes spottily doused with grass.However, there are those who do not think that these animals contribute to grassland degradation. [...] They claim that such burrowing aids in the recycling of nutrients in the soil and that the rise in population is only normal since grazing levels in these areas have also risen.|$|R
50|$|A perhaps {{surprisingly}} high {{balance of}} mammalian foods consists of rodents or similar smallish mammals, as {{about half of}} the species consumed by brown bears weigh less than 10 kg on average. These may include hares (Lepus ssp.), pikas (Ochotona ssp.) marmots (Marmota ssp.), ground squirrels, chipmunks, mice, rats, lemmings and voles. Due to their propensity for digging, brown bears are able to smell out active subterranean burrows of these small mammals and either wait quietly or furiously dig away until the animals are either displaced and lunged at or are cornered in their burrows. Not only do they consume the small mammals, but they also feed on their caches, as has been recorded in grizzly bears attacking voles and northern pocket gophers (Thomomys talpoides). In some areas, caches may be the primary target when bears dig at these animal's burrows, as may be the case with Siberian chipmunks (Eutamias sibiricus), whose hoards can contain up to 20 kg of food, with the chipmunks themselves only being caught occasionally. With particular regularity, tundra-dwelling grizzlies will wait at burrows of Arctic ground squirrels (Spermophilus parryii) hoping to pick off a few of the 1 kg rodents. Ground squirrel hunting is most successful in September and October, when early snow may impede the rodents’ rocky escape routes. In Denali National Park, Arctic ground squirrels represent about 8% of the year-round diet of grizzly bears and are the most consistent source of animal protein for grizzlies there. An even more important dietary relationship with a small mammal occurs in the Tibetan blue bear, which is apparently the most completely carnivorous brown bear race, foraging most regularly for plateau pikas (Ochotona curzoniae), a species about one-sixth the weight of an Arctic ground squirrel. As many as 25 pikas have been found in a single bear's stomach and in Changtang, 60% of the diet consisted of pikas. Where plateau pikas are absent, as in the Mustang region of Nepal, <b>Himalayan</b> <b>marmots</b> (Marmota himalayana) become the dietary staple of the bear, occurring in about half of nearly a thousand scats. Large rodents such as beavers (Castor spp.) and North American porcupines (Erethizon dorsatum) are rare prey items, mostly due to differing habitat preferences, as well as the obvious defenses of the latter. Up to five species of cetacean have been recorded as a food source in the coastal regions of Alaska, the Central Arctic and (formerly) California when beached.|$|R

50|$|The <b>Himalayan</b> <b>marmot</b> (Marmota himalayana) is a marmot {{found in}} alpine grasslands {{throughout}} the Himalayas {{and on the}} Tibetan Plateau at elevation from 3500 to 5200 m. It lives in colonies and excavates deep burrows that colony members share during hibernation.|$|E
50|$|Like all vultures, the {{cinereous vulture}} eats mostly carrion. The cinereous vulture feeds on carrion {{of almost any}} type, from the largest mammals {{available}} to fish and reptiles. In Tibet, commonly eaten carcasses can include both wild and domestic yaks (Bos grunniens), Bharal, Tibetan gazelles (Pseudois nayaur), kiangs (Equus kiang), woolly hares (Lepus oiostolus), <b>Himalayan</b> <b>marmots</b> (Marmota himalayana), domestic sheep (Ovis aries), and even humans, mainly those at their celestial burial grounds. Reportedly in Mongolia, Tarbagan marmots (Marmota sibirica) comprised the largest part of the diet, although that species is now endangered as it is preferred in the diet of local people, wild prey ranging from corsac fox (Vulpes corsac) to Argali (Ovis ammon) may be eaten additionally in Mongolia. Historically, cinereous vultures in the Iberian Peninsula fed mostly on European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) carcasses, but since viral hemorrhagic pneumonia (VHP) devastated the once abundant rabbit population there, the vultures now rely on the carrion of domestic sheep, supplemented by pigs (Sus scrofa domesticus) and deer. In Turkey, the dietary preferences were argali (Ovis ammon) (92 carrion items), wild boar (Sus scrofa) (53 items), chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus) (27 items), gray wolf (13 items) and red fox (Vulpes vulpes) (13 items). Unusually, {{a large amount of}} plant material was found in pellets from Turkey, especially pine cones. Among the vultures in its range, the cinereous is best equipped to tear open tough carcass skins thanks to its powerful bill. It can even break apart bones, such as ribs, to access the flesh of large animals. It is dominant over other scavengers in its range, even over other large vultures such as Gyps vultures, bearded vulture or fierce ground predators such as foxes. While noisy Gyps vultures squawk and fly around, the often silent cinereous will keep them well at bay until they are satisfied and have had their own fill. A series of photos taken recently show a cinereous vulture attacking a Himalayan griffon in flight for unknown reasons, although the griffon was not seriously injured. Cinereous vultures frequently bully and dominate steppe eagles (Aquila nipalensis) when the two species are attracted to the same prey and carrion while wintering in Asia. A rare successful act of kleptoparasitism on a cinereous vulture was filmed in Korea when a Steller's sea eagle (Haliaeetus pelagicus) stole from a vulture.|$|R

40|$|Background: After the {{earthquake}} on 14, April 2010 at Yushu in China, a plague epidemic hosted by <b>Himalayan</b> <b>marmot</b> (Marmota himalayana) {{became a major}} public health concern during the reconstruction period. A rapid assessment {{of the distribution of}} <b>Himalayan</b> <b>marmot</b> in the area was urgent. The aims of this study were to analyze the relationship between environmental factors and the distribution of burrow systems of the marmot and to predict the distribution of marmots. Methods: Two types of marmot burrows (hibernation and temporary) in Yushu County were investigated from June to September in 2011. The location of every burrow was recorded with a global positioning system receiver. An ecological niche model was used to determine the relationship between the burrow occurrence data and environmental variables, such as land surface temperature (LST) in winter and summer, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) in winter and summer, elevation, and soil type. The predictive accuracies of the models were assessed by the area under the curve of the receiving operator curve. Results: The models for hibernation and temporary burrows both performed well. The contribution orders of the variables were LST in winter and soil type, NDVI in winter and elevation for the hibernation burrow model, and LST in summer, NDVI in summer, soil type and elevation in the temporary burrow model. There were non-linear relationships between the probability of burrow presence and LST, NDVI and elevation. LST of 14 and 23 degrees C, NDVI of 0. 22 and 0. 60, and 4100 m were inflection points. A substantially higher probability of burrow presence was observed in swamp soil and dark felty soil than in other soil types. The potential area for hibernation burrows was 5696 km(2) (37. 7 % of Yushu County), and the area for temporary burrows was 7711 km(2) (51. 0 % of Yushu County). Conclusions: The results suggested that marmots preferred warm areas with relatively low altitudes and good vegetation conditions in Yushu County. Based on these results, the present research is useful in understanding the niche selection and distribution pattern of marmots in this region...|$|E

40|$|Plague, a Yersinia pestis infection, is a fatal {{disease with}} {{tremendous}} transmission capacity. However, {{the mechanism of}} how the pathogen stays in a reservoir, circulates and then re-emerges is an enigma. We studied a plague outbreak caused by {{the construction of a}} large reservoir in southwest China followed 16 -years' surveillance. The results show the prevalence of plague within the natural plague focus is closely related to the stability of local ecology. Before and during the decade of construction the reservoir on the Nanpan River, no confirmed plague has ever emerged. With the impoundment of reservoir and destruction of drowned farmland and vegetation, the infected rodent population previously dispersed was concentrated together in a flood-free area and turned a rest focus alive. Human plague broke out after the enzootic plague via the flea bite. With the construction completed and ecology gradually of human residential environment, animal population and type of vegetation settling down to a new balance, the natural plague foci returned to a rest period. With the rodent density decreased as some of them died, the flea density increased as the rodents lived near or in local farm houses where had more domestic animals, and human has a more concentrated population. In contrast, in the <b>Himalayan</b> <b>marmot</b> foci of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in the Qilian Mountains.

Our recent studies showed that PNA, a prodrug of 2 ′, 3 ′-dideoxyguanosine (ddG), exhibited lower mitochondrial toxicity in long-term cultures of HepG 2 cells. In the current study, we examined the long-term effects of PNA on mitochondrial toxicity in Marmota himalayana (<b>Himalayan</b> <b>marmot).</b> Himalayan marmots were treated daily with oral PNA (50 or 100 mg/kg), ziduvidine (AZT) (100 mg/kg), or water (control) for 90 days. PNA treatment did not alter the body weight or plasma lactate acid level. In livers from the animals treated with PNA at 100 mg/kg/day, histopathology showed mild steatosis or small focal liver cell necrosis. Electron microscopy also showed minor proliferation and partial mitochondrial swelling with crista reduction. Measurement of respiratory chain complex enzyme activity and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) content revealed no significant differences in skeletal muscle, liver, and kidney tissues between animals treated with PNA and controls. In contrast, in Himalayan marmots treated with AZT we observed delayed toxicity, including lactic acidosis, severe hepatic steatosis, obvious mitochondrial damage, and significant decreases in respiratory chain complex enzyme activity and mtDNA content. This is similar to the delayed toxicity syndrome observed previously in animals and humans. In summary, PNA treatment did not alter mitochondrial enzyme activity or mtDNA content. This suggests that PNA could pose a very low risk for adverse mitochondrion-related effects. However, long-term hepatotoxic effects of PNA were observed, and this indicates a need for continued monitoring of PNA-associated hepatotoxicity in clinical trials...|$|E

Impact {{of climate}} change on human-wildlife-ecosystem interactions in the Trans-Himalaya region of Nepal. Theoretical and Applied Climatology. Advance online publication. doi: 10. 1007 /s 00704 - 013 - 0902 - 4 This thesis evaluates prey-predator, climate change, and human-wildlife interactions in the Nepalese Himalayas and contains 12 scientific papers which were prepared from 2009 - 2012 to explain these interactions. The content of this thesis is categorised into four broad themes; wildlife ecology, human-wildlife conflict, the influence {{of climate change}} on human-wildlife interactions, and recommendations for developing strategies to balance wildlife conservation and human needs in Nepal. The findings summarized below based on their relevant themes.  In the study of human wildlife conflict in the upper Mustang region, Nepal, I recorded a total of 1, 347 km 2 of pasture land utilised by the local people from six village development committees, 706 livestock animals were killed {{during the study period}} by predators (equivalent to US$ 44, 213 every two years), and 75 % of the total livestock predation was attributed to snow leopards. I also found that the movement of livestock drives the snow leopards to lower elevations and into closer proximit to villages.  Rangelands are considered to be critical ecosystems in the Nepalese Himalayas and provide multiple ecosystem services that support local livelihoods. This study analyses the conflict over the use of rangeland by two villages in Mustang, Nepal. The conflict suggests that excessive demand for limited rangelands motivates local villagers to gain absolute control of the resources. In such contexts, external support should focus on enhancing the management and production of local foraging resources, which requires the establishment of local common property institutions to facilitate sustainable rangeland management.  The northern Barandabhar Forest Corridor (BFC) in southern Nepal, which consists of 10, 644 ha with 15 community forestry (3, 184 ha) that connects Chitwan National Park to the Mahabharat range, was studied. BFC has the potential to contribute to the improvement of Nepal’s ecological integrity. We propose that the northern BFC should be managed via a 5 new participatory scheme, the Barandabhar Forest Management Council, to foster ecological integrity of the area while providing forest products to communities.  The presence of brown bears in the Manasalu Conservation Area and Annapurna Conservation Area of Nepal, was confirmed. Results showed that brown bears are potentially distributed between 3800 m and 5500 m in the high mountainous region of Nepal, across an area of 4037 km 2. Small mammals were the preferred prey of brown bears (75 %) with marmots (Marmota himalayana; 46 %) being the largest contributor to brown bear diet. Finally, a three stage brown bear conservation programme is recommended: (a) detailed research activities both inside and outside protected areas of Nepal (b) livelihood and conservation awareness support at local and national level (c) strengthening of the local capacity and a reduction in human-wildlife conflict in the region.  The Nepalese Himalayas provide habitat for the endangered snow leopard (Panthera uncia) and its principal prey species, the blue sheep (Pseudois nayaur). A total of 939 Blue sheep were recorded at altitudes ranging from 3209 to 5498 m on slopes with gradients of 16 – 60 ° and aspects of 40 °NE to 140 °SE. The upper Mustang had the lowest population density of blue sheep recorded within their distribution range in Nepal (0. 86 blue sheep/km 2). It is estimated that the existing blue sheep population biomass of approximately 38, 925 kg in the upper Mustang region could support approximately 19 snow leopards (1. 6 snow leopards/ 100 km 2).  Habitat suitability analyses of snow leopards in Annapurna Conservation Area (ACA), Nepal indicated that an area of 3248 km 2 was suitable for snow leopards. Genetics analysis of the collected scats were successfully genotyped (62 %) using 6 microsatellite markers, and identified as having originated from five different individuals and suggested minimum home ranges of 89. 4 km 2 (male) and 59. 3 km 2 (female). Microhistological analysis of scats (n= 248) 6 revealed that blue sheep are the primary prey species (63 %) and that livestock contributed 18 % of the snow leopard diet.  The Hispid hare (Caprolagus hispidus) is one of the least studied endangered small mammal species in the world. The diet and habitat use of the hispid hare was studied at Shuklaphanta Wildlife Reserve (SWR), Nepal. The population density of the hispid hare was 5. 76 individuals/km 2. Hispid hares mostly prefer grasses (Saccharum spontaneum and Imperata cylindrica) and more that nineteen plants were indentified in their pellets.  The <b>Himalayan</b> <b>marmot</b> (Marmota himalayana) was found to inhabit warmer valleys close to water resources in areas between 3200 m and 5300 m above sea level. Plant diversity was higher in the marmot habitat. Seventeen of plants were recorded in marmots scats over three seasons (summer, autumn and spring). Soil pH, organic matter and organic carbon were not significantly different in habitat occupied by marmots compared to area where marmots were absent. Phosphorus (P 2 O 5) levels were significantly higher and potash (K 2 O) levels significantly lower in marmot burrow habitat.  I found that the average annual temperature in the upper Mustang region has increased by 0. 13 °C per year over the last 23 years. A predictive model suggested that the mean annual temperature will double by 2161 to reach 20 °C in the upper Mustang region. A reduction in suitable agricultural, grassland, and forest land was recorded. Furthermore, grasses and many shrub species are no longer found in abundance at higher elevations and consequently blue sheep move to forage at lower elevations which attracts snow leopard (Panthera uncia) from their higher elevation habitats to lower sites, where they encounter and depredate livestock. Increased crop raiding by blue sheep and depredations of livestock by snow leopards have adversely impacted the livelihood of local people...|$|E
