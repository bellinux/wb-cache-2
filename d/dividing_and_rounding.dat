40|$|Background and Aim: The lack {{of balance}} between job needs and workers {{physical}} capacity {{may lead to}} work-related musculoskeletal disorders (Wises). WMSDs {{are one of the}} most important occupational health problems in developing countries. These problems are due to risk factors such as poor work postures, excessive force applied, repetitive movements, vibration, prolonged work duration, and psychological factors, leading, ultimately, to disorders ranging from mild low back pain to severe disabilities. This study aimed at determining the prevalence of WMSDs in different body regions, assessing posturing, and detecting ergonomic and individual risk factors causing musculoskeletal disorders, in Araki bakery workers in Arak, Iran. Methods and Materials: In this cross - sectional study 233 randomly selected bakery workers in Arak were included, and the prevalence of symptoms of musculoskeletal disorders and their risk factors, with particular emphasis on work posture, was determined in them. The method used was OWAS and the NMQ Questionnaire. Results: The highest prevalences of musculoskeletal disorders were in the knees (62. 2 %), low back (58. 8 %), legs (53. 9 %) and shoulders (44. 6 %) of the workers. Low back and shoulder injuries in Shaaters (workers in charge of baking the bread) and elbow, thigh and low back disorders in Choongeers (workers in charge of <b>dividing</b> <b>and</b> <b>rounding</b> the dough) were more prevalent than in other occupations. There is a positive association between type of occupation and these disorders (p< 0 / 05). According to the OWAS classification, the distribution of bakery workers working postures was as follows: 58. 5 % in the action category 1 (natural posture), 34. 7 % in the action category 2 (stress posture), 4 % in the action category 3 (harmful posture), and 2. 5 % in the action category 4 (very harmful posture). There was a significant relation between work service record and neck, elbow, shoulder, and knee disorders (p< 0 / 05). Conclusion: This study revealed that the working postures of 42. 2 % of Aaraki bakery workers were slightly to very harmful postures; in addition, there was a high prevalence of WMSDS in different body regions of the workers. Ergonomic interventions are essential to improve the situation and protect better the health of the workers...|$|E

Thick tortillas were prepared using low pressure and long dwell time. Thin and larger diameter tortillas were prepared using higher pressure and/or longer press times. Volume and opacities were similar except when extreme low or high dwell times and pressures were utilized. Thicker tortillas corresponded to shorter shelf stability. The effects of the rates of reaction of several leavening acids and 4 grades of sodium bicarbonate (NBC) on flour tortillas were determined. An increase in dough and tortilla pH was observed in treatments with the same acid but faster NBC, indicating that smaller particle size NBC dissolves and reacts earlier in processing. Tortillas with increased volume also had increased height, diameter and opacity. Tortillas with more volume or height had shorter shelf stabilities. Higher opacities were observed in tortillas containing fine NBC and lower opacities with coated NBC. Some combinations of the acid with NBC enhanced tortilla attributes. Treatments with coated citric acid were unique because they were thick, and had increased diameter, opacity, volume, and shelf stability. SALP with coarse NBC yielded unique tortillas with decreased height and increased diameter and opacity. Slower acids dissolved some during mixing and nucleated the dough with gas bubbles sufficiently to yield opaque tortillas. During dough resting, <b>dividing</b> <b>and</b> <b>rounding,</b> some insoluble leavening compounds need to be retained to allow for later chemical neutralization and reaction during baking. The gas produced early during baking was not completely retained as evidenced by less opaque tortillas. The effects of the amount of leavening (optimum, 33 % less than optimum, and 50 % more than optimum) on tortilla properties were evaluated. Tortilla height increased with the amount of leavening. Increased leavening increased opacity with the high amount of leavening resulting in the most opaque tortillas for all the acids. Greater amounts of leavening, however, adversely affected storage stability. Increased amounts of leavening resulted in tortillas with increased opacity, decreased diameter, shorter shelf-life and less rollable tortillas; while decreased amounts of leavening resulted in tortillas with decreased height, volume and opacity...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} {{hardware}} architecture for all building blocks re-quired in polynomial ring based fully homomorphic schemes {{and use it}} to instantiate the somewhat homomorphic encryption scheme YASHE. Our implementation is the first FPGA implementation that is designed for evaluating functions on homomorphically encrypted data (up to a certain multiplicative depth) and we illustrate this capability by evaluating the SIMON- 64 / 128 block cipher in the encrypted domain. Our implemen-tation provides a fast polynomial operations unit using CRT and NTT for multiplication combined with an optimized memory access scheme; a fast Barrett like polynomial reduction method; an efficient <b>divide</b> <b>and</b> <b>round</b> unit required in the multiplication of ciphertexts and an efficient CRT unit. These building blocks are integrated in an instruction-set co-processor to execute YASHE, which can be controlled by a computer for evaluating arbitrary functions (up to the multiplicative depth 44 and 128 -bit security level). Our architecture was compiled for a single Virtex- 7 XC 7 V 1140 T FPGA, where it consumes 23 % of registers, 53 % of LUTs, 53 % of DSP slices, and 38 % of BlockRAM memory. The implementation evaluates SIMON- 64 / 128 in approximately 171. 3 s (at 143 MHz) and it processes 2048 ciphertexts at once giving a relative time of only 83. 6 ms per block. This is 24. 5 times faster than the leading software implemen-tation on a 4 -core Intel Core-i 7 processor running at 3. 4 GHz...|$|R

30|$|The {{model of}} the SHEAR {{protocol}} assumes a set of homogeneous, immobile, and power constrained sensor nodes coexisting with a BS that has an abundant power supply and is capable of transmitting with high enough energy to the entire network. The groups of sensor nodes are distributed arbitrarily within a defined region of interest and the BS is situated statically at a remote location, away from the sensor field. The network is dynamically partitioned into sub-zones called clusters. The network functions are divided in two phases in SHEAR, namely, the cluster setup phase and the communication phase. In the former phase, different clusters are formed each with an elected CH and, in the latter phase, the communication of sensed data from nodes to CHs and from CHs to BS takes place using a least energy cost path. The operation of SHEAR is <b>divided</b> into <b>rounds</b> <b>and</b> each <b>round</b> consists of both the cluster setup and communication phases, as detailed below.|$|R
30|$|The {{operation}} of the router is strictly time-triggered <b>and</b> <b>divided</b> into <b>rounds</b> of activity. The underlaying ACROSS MPSoC [22] provides a generic timer service {{which is used to}} synchronously trigger activity rounds in all CISes. The trigger-period (2 − 15 s≡ 30.52 μ s) is faster than the minimum interarrival time of CAN messages at 1 Mbps. Within one activity cycle each CIS checks if a newly arrived CAN message at the CAN port has to be processed, then it processes this message according to the associated routing configuration, and forwards the message to the TTNoC. Additionally, the CIS checks if it received a message from the TTNoC (i.e., this message was originally sent in the last activity cycle), and if this is the case, it processes the message and finally sends the message with the highest priority to the destination CAN bus.|$|R
30|$|XRF {{analysis}} revealed that {{in the majority of}} blues used in the Flora Graeca paintings copper and cobalt were present, suggesting the use of either smalt or a copper blue (such as blue bice, verditer or azurite) (Fig.  4 i). It is likely however, that the source of the cobalt in this instance was from the paper substrate itself. Under in situ microscopic examination at ×  400, {{it was clear that the}} particle morphology of Bauer’s blue pigments was not consistent with smalt, while that of the blue pigment within the paper structure was. Bauer’s blue pigment appears as small, finely <b>divided,</b> <b>rounded</b> <b>and</b> semi-opaque particles, in contrast with smalt (amorphous, conchoidally-fractured, angular and transparent particles). As noted above, particles matching this description and containing cobalt were clearly visible within the fibres in all instances of Bauer’s papers examined under microscopy, suggesting that the source of the cobalt was likely the paper itself, rather than the blue pigment.|$|R
