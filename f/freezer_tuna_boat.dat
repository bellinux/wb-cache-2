5000|$|In February 1991, {{representatives of}} a <b>tuna</b> <b>boat</b> in the Pacific south of Mexico {{said that they}} had been rammed by Sea Shepherd II. Sea Shepherd accused it of {{catching}} and killing dolphins in its tuna nets and confirmed its ship had dealt the <b>tuna</b> <b>boat</b> a [...] "glancing blow." [...] They had originally planned to destroy the fishermen's small boat used to lay nets, but called the plan off because the fishermen were too close. They also turned a fire hose on the fishermen's helicopter (used to herd the dolphins) in order to ensure costly repairs.|$|R

The article also reviews alternative general theories of the impact of economic growth on income distribution, and considers evidence from a socio-economic survey of two fishing villages in the Republic of Maldives on the impact of motorization on income distribution.

On February 16, 1942, San Diego Port Director Commander W.J. Morcott called a meeting of tuna skippers and crews at the Naval Armory Reserve telling the men “The Navy needs men to man the clippers — experienced men, like yourselves. Needless to say, duty in the war zones will be hazardous.” Six hundred <b>tuna</b> <b>boat</b> men volunteered to join their boats in the navy. The boats were painted navy grey and had their names replaced with numerical designations. The ships patrolled the coasts of the United States, the Panama Canal and served in several battles of the South Pacific, particularly the Battle of Guadalcanal.|$|R

Tuna fishing {{plays an important role in}} the development of the Maldives. In this article various policy instruments available to the Maldivian tuna fishery authorities are reviewed in order to select those best suited for the economically efficient exploitation of tuna within the range of operation of the domestic <b>tuna</b> <b>boats.</b> In the Maldivian context, price control is selected as the appropriate policy instrument, even though licensing of <b>tuna</b> <b>boats</b> is also a possibility in the short-run. Price control is based on levying a tax on catches and is oriented towards economic efficiency. The article explains the methodology used in determining the optimal tax which would maximize the economic benefit of the fishery to the Maldivian society...|$|R

2500|$|In 1972 Funafuti was in {{the path}} of Cyclone Bebe during the 1972–73 South Pacific cyclone season. Cyclone Bebe was a {{pre-season}} tropical cyclone that impacted the Gilbert, Ellice Islands, and Fiji island groups. First spotted on October20, the system intensified and grew in size through October22. At about 4 p.m. on Saturday 21 October sea water was bubbling through the coral on the airfield with the water reaching a height of about 4–5 feet high. Cyclone Bebe continued through Sunday 22 October. The Ellice Islands Colony's ship Moanaraoi {{was in the}} lagoon and survived, however 3 <b>tuna</b> <b>boats</b> were wrecked. Waves broke over the atoll. Five people died, two adults and a 3 month old child were swept away by waves, and two sailors from the <b>tuna</b> <b>boats</b> were drowned. Cyclone Bebe knocked down 90% of the houses and trees. The storm surge created a wall of coral rubble along the ocean side of Funafuti and Funafala that was about [...] long, and about [...] thick at the bottom. The cyclone submerged Funafuti and sources of drinking water were contaminated {{as a result of the}} system's storm surge and fresh water flooding.|$|R

The Tuvalu Overseas Seamen's Union (TOSU) is the only registered trade union in Tuvalu. It represents workers on foreign ships. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) estimates that 800 Tuvaluan men are trained, certified and active as seafarers. The ADB estimates that, at any one time, about 15% of the adult male population works abroad as seafarers.

2500|$|According to the U.S. Consumers Union, Earth Island and U.S. dolphin safe labels {{provide no}} {{guarantee}} that dolphins are not harmed during the fishing process because verification is neither universal nor independent. Still, <b>tuna</b> fishing <b>boats</b> and canneries operating under any of the various U.S. labeling standards are subject to surprise inspection and observation. [...] For US import, companies face strict charges of fraud for any violation of the label standards, while Earth Island Institute (EII), an independent environmental organization, verifies the standards are met by more than 700 tuna companies outside the U.S through inspections of canneries, storage units, and audits of fishing logs. [...] It {{should be noted that}} Earth Island Institute receives donations from the companies it verifies; and EII has never had an external scientific audit of its labeling program, a best practice for eco-labels. International observers are increasingly part of the Dolphin Safe verification process, being present on virtually purse seine <b>tuna</b> <b>boats</b> in the Eastern Pacific Ocean.|$|R
40|$|Reasons {{are given}} why spatial {{differences}} in travel costs for <b>tuna</b> <b>boats</b> {{fishing in the}} same region may be of little significance in the Maldives. Claims are made that the fishing ground concept is of limited value {{in the case of}} a migratory species such as tuna and that there are practical difficulties in implementing the Campbell and Lindner tax/subsidy scheme, which in practice could give rise to a deadweight social loss. Furthermore, in the absence of empirical quantification, Campbell and Lindner give no real guide to optimal fishing effort policy in the Maldives.

50|$|In {{fisheries}} issues, the United States claims jurisdiction for {{the management}} of coastal fisheries up to 200 mile (370 km) from its coast, but excludes highly migratory species; Ecuador, on the other hand, claims a 200-mile (370-km) territorial sea, and imposes license fees and fines on foreign fishing vessels in the area, making no exceptions for catches of migratory species. In the early 1970s, Ecuador seized about 100 foreign-flag vessels (many of them U.S.) and collected fees and fines of more than $6 million. After a drop-off in such seizures for some years, several U.S. <b>tuna</b> <b>boats</b> were again detained and seized in 1980 and 1981.|$|R
