50|$|In {{the first}} half of the twentieth century, {{although}} the unaccompanied figure of the woman in the street was seen increasingly frequently in Fashion photographs she often remained bound by the feminine pursuits of a bourgeois existence, with the reality of the street a beautifying prop to the unreal fantasy of high-end fashion. As an object of gaze, her position contrasted with that of the flaneur and the male privileged code of visual spectatorship. It was until the Post-war period, with the emergence of style-conscious magazines aimed at men that the image of the flaneur, somewhat melded with the more modern notion of the “man about town”, began to be visualised in fashion photography. Metropolitan masculinity was shown to be influenced by the <b>industrial</b> <b>atmosphere</b> of the metropolis. This is well illustrated by Terence Donovan (photographer)`s grainy black and white photographs of sharply suited men in ”Spy Drama” for the October 1962 issue of Town which became famous as the visual influence for the filmic interpretation of James Bond. In this period, the representation of the woman in the street was radicalised by the emergence of youth as a social category and its claiming of street culture as its primary context.|$|E

50|$|The Design hub {{engages with}} {{contrasting}} eras, with the classic history of Shrine of remembrance in Street Kilda road which marks {{the other end}} of Melbourne public axis as well as its neighbouring buildings. The vantage point from the roof of the Design Hub provides a clear view of Swanston Street, North of Latrobe Street as well as the Shrine which gives all the more reason for its occupants to go the roof. Minimalism is the main design factor for the exterior facade, which consist of circular cells achieving a dynamic design. Inspiration for the lucid discs with its steel cylindrical structure came from the beer business that once ran on the CUB Brewery site. The intent for the facade however, is to encourage further use and research into solar energy. It is because of this that each solar panel can be replaced with innovated panels as the technology continues to develop. Research groups can now use this building to experiment and develop the technology, using its northern facade, dedicated to this research. The interior of the hub is designed to encourage the various research groups to ‘cross pollinate’ ideas with each other, regardless of the relevance between each other’s fields of practice. This therefore provides a learning environment which should create innovation in design for years to come.

SummersSubject: GEP'Dirty' Industries: Just {{between you}} and me, shouldn't the World Bank be {{encouraging}} MORE migration of the dirty industries to the LDCs Developed Countries? I can think of three reasons:1) The measurements {{of the costs of}} health impairing pollution depends on the foregone earnings from increased morbidity and mortality. From this point of view a given amount of health impairing pollution should be done in the country with the lowest cost, which will be the country with the lowest wages. I think the economic logic behind dumping a load of toxic waste in the lowest wage country is impeccable and we should face up to that.2) The costs of pollution are likely to be non-linear as the initial increments of pollution probably have very low cost. I've always thought that under-populated countries in Africa are vastly UNDER-polluted, their air quality is probably vastly inefficiently low compared to Los Angeles or Mexico City. Only the lamentable facts that so much pollution is generated by non-tradable industries (transport, electrical generation) and that the unit transport costs of solid waste are so high prevent world welfare enhancing trade in air pollution and waste.3) The demand for a clean environment for aesthetic and health reasons is likely to have very high income elasticity. The concern over an agent that causes a one in a million change in the odds of prostratesic cancer is obviously going to be much higher in a country where people survive to get prostratesiccancer than in a country where under 5 mortality is 200 per thousand. Also, much of the concern over <b>industrial</b> <b>atmosphere</b> discharge is about visibility impairing particulates. These discharges may have very little direct health impact. Clearly trade in goods that embody aesthetic pollution concerns could be welfare enhancing. While production is mobile the consumption of pretty air is a non-tradable.The problem with the arguments against all of these proposals for more pollution in LDCs (intrinsic rights to certain goods, moral reasons, social concerns, lack of adequate markets, etc.) could be turned around and used more or less effectively against every Bank proposal for liberalization.

40|$|Maintenance and {{the related}} costs in the life time of {{existing}} structures are an ever growing problem and bridges are no exception to this rule. Much of the maintenance costs are related to corrosion of steel members. Especially when steel and composite bridges are built in aggressive environments (e. g. close to seawater or in <b>industrial</b> <b>atmospheres)</b> these costs become of major importance. However also concrete bridges are concerned as the re-bars in concrete decks may be subjected to corrosion caused by chloride ingress from de-icing salt or seawater.

The authors of this work have taken advantage of the opportunity to use different natural atmospheres in the Ibero-American region to study the behaviour of new water-borne, high-solids and powder paint systems, with and without pre-treatment. The study has involved coatings exposure in 7 natural atmospheres and different laboratory accelerated tests. It was completed with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations, energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS) analysis, and adhesion, water up-take and electrochemical measurements. It has been concluded that water-borne acrylic paint systems incorporating primers pigmented with zinc phosphate and others show deficient behaviour in marine atmospheres, but better behaviour in <b>industrial</b> <b>atmospheres.</b> In marine atmospheres, water-borne epoxy paint systems, including zinc-rich primers, together with epoxy and epoxy-polyurethane high-solids paint systems, present the most efficient anti-corrosive behaviour. The coatings obtained with epoxy and epoxy-polyester powder paints only show good behaviour, when applied on an adequate pre-treatment, in atmospheres of low to medium corrosivity category (C 2 -C 3). Finally, the best correlation was observed between the results of natural exposure in marine atmospheres, salt spray and water up-take measurements. It was not possible to verify good correlation between natural exposure and prohesion, adhesion and electrochemical tests. The latter are highly sensitive to the chemical nature of coatings, and seem to be significantly more useful when comparing coatings with more identical nature. © WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH, 2001.
