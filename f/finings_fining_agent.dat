40|$|Glass melting is {{significantly}} influenced by two processes: {{the dissolution of}} particles and the fining of glass. Because these processes are time- and energy-consuming in industry, <b>fining</b> <b>agents</b> are used. Although much literature has been reported {{about the use of}} <b>fining</b> <b>agents,</b> no extensive overview of such literature has yet been published. In this paper, we provide such a review, targeting articles that describe the influence of <b>fining</b> <b>agents</b> on (i) the dissolution of particles, (ii) the bubble nucleation and removal, (iii) colour of glass at reduced melting conditions, and (iv) the foaming of glass. We cover the history of <b>fining</b> <b>agent</b> usage from the earliest research in the field to the most recent cutting-edge discoveries. The advantages and disadvantages of all the traditional <b>fining</b> <b>agents</b> are described, with attention paid to the most widely used agent, sodium sulphate. In addition, sodium sulphate is considered as a surface-active compound and colouring substance. Furthermore, we include the influence of redox conditions on the process of fining.

Faculdade de CiênciasCurrently, {{wine fining}} {{is still a}} common practice, in which, the {{mechanisms}} and consequences are not entirely defined. Considering {{the complexity of the}} phenomena and the difficulties related to the analysis of the main compounds involved (colloids, tannins, proteins), only a few authors cited proposed theories that explain these mechanisms. The main goal is the clarification and decrease of phenolic compounds, regarding in particular the excess of astringency in wines. Protein <b>fining</b> <b>agents</b> used in Enology present a varied physico-chemical composition subsequently, the distribution of molecular weight and charge density influence their properties. Meanwhile, the incresing problems during the 90 s (last century) with the BSE desease, led the oenological industry, to a certain deal of concern, regarding the products used, particularly in <b>fining</b> <b>agents</b> used in wines. As a result, the subject of plant proteins for collage in wines followed the phases imposed by the OIV, Portuguese and European regulations. The present work studied the effect of <b>fining</b> <b>agents</b> from vegetable and microbiological proteins on the physico-chemichal composition in wines, in particular anthocyanins. The results were compared with the ones obtained by using bentonite and egg albumin. In the laboratory the following analyses had been made: measurements on the physico-chemical parameters of color, using Somers method, and assays of high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC), to verify the effect of the finning treatment on total amount of anthocyanins. In all <b>fining</b> <b>agents</b> used, there was a decrease in color intensity, total anthocyanins, colored anthocyans and tannins, although was more pronounced in non-traditional <b>fining</b> <b>agents.</b> For the chromatograms it was verified a decrease in the anthocyanin concentrations.

40|$|Mestrado Vinifera EuroMaster - Instituto Superior de AgronomiaThe {{treatment}} of wine with <b>fining</b> <b>agents</b> {{is a common}} practice in the wine industry which aims to achieve wine’s clarity and improves its stability along the time. The objective of this work {{was to examine the}} influence of various animal proteins used as <b>fining</b> <b>agents</b> on the anthocyanins’ profile. For this experiment, two Portuguese varieties, Touriga Nacional and Trincadeira have been used in which two different concentrations have been applied for each fining product. The <b>fining</b> <b>agents</b> are commercial <b>fining</b> products widely used in the wine industry such as Egg Albumin, Isinglass, PVPP, Gelatin, Casesol. These proteins were added in the wines in order to perceive the effect of the adding protein and other <b>fining</b> <b>agents</b> on the wine’s anthocyanidins final composition, since that these monomeric anthocyanins have an important function on the sensory characteristics of wines, such as colour. The clarification process lasted 7 days for each fining product. At the end of each clarification period, monomeric anthocyanin analysis was carried out by HPLC. By the analysis in the HPLC, we perceived that in general the biggest impact from all the <b>fining</b> <b>agents</b> is displayed to the acylated and coumarylated derivatives of the monomeric anthocyanins rather than the 3 -glucoside antocyanidins. Having this as a fact and learning through the initial analysis that Touriga Nacional is richer in these two groups rather than in glucoside derivatives we are able to explain why Touriga Nacional was more affected in all the fining treatments compared to Trincadeira that is poorer in acylated derivatives and in general it was less influenced by the <b>fining</b> <b>agents.</b> Moreover, further analysis have been carried out in order to examine the influence of the <b>fining</b> <b>agents</b> on the concentration of pigments, the quantity of condensed tannins {{as well as on the}} chromatic characteristics of the wine after fining. For the quantity of condensed tannins after fining, the results have shown that all the <b>fining</b> <b>agents</b> promoted a reduction on the final quantity of tannins after the treatments whereas for the pigments and colour intensity the impact was notably lower compared with the tannins. Regarding the impact on the colour anthocyanins, Casesol promoted the greatest influence on their quantity. In addition, the general tendency indicates that the fining products in high concentrations provoke a bigger decrease on the amount of total anthocyanins compared with the small concentration...|$|R

50|$|Wineries {{might use}} animal-derived {{products}} as finings.

2500|$|In winemaking, fining is {{the process}} where a {{substance}} (<b>fining</b> <b>agent)</b> {{is added to the}} wine to create an adsorbent, enzymatic or ionic bond with the suspended particles, producing larger molecules and larger particles that will precipitate out of the wine more readily and rapidly. Unlike filtration, which can only remove particulates (such as dead yeast cells and grape fragments), fining can remove soluble substances such as polymerized tannins, coloring phenols and proteins; some of these proteins can cause haziness in wines exposed to high temperatures after bottling. The reduction of tannin can reduce astringency in red wines intended for early drinking. Many substances have historically been used as <b>fining</b> <b>agents,</b> including dried blood powder, but today there are two general types of <b>fining</b> <b>agents</b> [...] organic compounds and solid/mineral materials.|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Fermentation of smoke-affected grapes {{can lead}} to wines that exhibit {{objectionable}} smoke-related sensory attributes, i. e. smoke taint. Fining agents are routinely used {{at different stages of}} the winemaking process to address constituents that are considered to adversely affect juice or wine quality. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of commercial <b>fining</b> <b>agents</b> in reducing the concentration of volatile phenols and the intensity of sensory attributes associated with smoke-tainted wine. METHODS AND RESULTS: Smoke-affected wines were treated with a range of <b>fining</b> <b>agents,</b> two of which, an activated carbon and a synthetic mineral, were found to appreciably ameliorate the taint. Treated wines contained a significantly lower level of smoke-derived volatile phenols and exhibited less intense ‘smoke’ and ‘cold ash’ aromas, ‘smoky’ flavour and ‘ashy’ aftertaste, compared with that of untreated (control) wines; with little or no impact on wine colour. CONCLUSIONS: Selected <b>fining</b> <b>agents</b> can ameliorate smoke taint in wine. Whereas most <b>fining</b> <b>agents</b> showed poor specificity towards the wine components responsible for smoke taint, some, an activated carbon in particular, were highly effective. SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY: This research identifies a treatment {{that can be used to}} mitigate the impact of grapevine exposure to smoke on wine composition and sensory properties. A. L. Fudge, M.

40|$|Background and Aims There is {{a growing}} {{interest}} in finding alternative wine <b>fining</b> <b>agents</b> to replace potentially allergenic 8 animal- and plant-derived proteins. In this context, the potential use of grape-derived <b>fining</b> <b>agents</b> would be beneficial as they would not introduce additional potentially allergenic products to the finished wine. In this project, grape seed flour, a by-product of the grape oil seed industry, {{has been used to}} prepare a grape seeds extract (GSE) to be tested as a novel wine <b>fining</b> <b>agent.</b> Methods and Results: The fining performances of GSE were compared with those of patatin, pea protein, PVPP, K 14 caseinate (in a white and in a rosè wines), ovalbumin and gelatin (in a red wine). Turbidity reduction, effects on wine color, polyphenolic content, browning potential and wine sensory attributes were determined. GSE was effective in decreasing white wine turbidity when compared to K-caseinate. In red wine, GSE removed some anthocyanins and proanthocyanins, while wine colour was only slightly affected. The greatest GSE effect was observed on the organoleptic properties of the treated wines, as it drastically reduced the vegetal notes on the rosé wine and improved the overall taste of the red wine {{as a result of the}} reduction in both acidity and astringency. Conclusions: GSE can be considered a valid allergen-free alternative to the most common wine <b>fining</b> <b>agents...</b>|$|R
40|$|In Europe, wine is {{estimated}} to be the second source, after cereals, of ochratoxin A (OTA), {{one of the most important}} mycotoxin found in food and feed products [1]. Its chemical structure consists of a chlorine-containing dihydro-isocoumarin linked through the 7 -carboxyl group to L [...] phenylalanine. In wine, this fungal metabolite represents a severe risk for consumer health. According to the European Commission Regulation (EC) No. 123 / 2005 the maximum limit for OTA in wine is 2 g/Kg [2]. Therefore, it is important to prevent and control their occurrence in wines. With the purpose to remove this toxin, several chemical, microbiological and physical methods were described in the literature [1, 3, 4]. Consequently, the aim of this work is to understand the interaction of different types of <b>fining</b> <b>agents</b> on OTA removal from wine. To evaluate their effectiveness, eleven commercial <b>fining</b> <b>agents,</b> including mineral, synthetic, animal and vegetable proteins were used to get new approaches on OTA removal from wine. Trials were performed in wines added of OTA. Most effective <b>fining</b> <b>agent</b> in removing OTA was a commercial formulation that contains activated carbon, a well-known adsorbent of mycotoxins. Reductions between 10 and 30 % were also obtained with potassium caseinate, yeast cell walls and pea protein. However, with bentonites, carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), polyvinylpolypyrrolidone (PVPP) and chitosan no considerable reduction of OTA was verify. Also, the influence of these <b>fining</b> <b>agents</b> on the physicochemical wine characteristics, namely wine color, total phenolic compounds, flavonoids and non-flavonoids were studied. Final results could provide important information to the wine industry to select treatments based on <b>fining</b> <b>agents</b> to remove OTA, in order to reduce toxicity and consequently to improve wine safety and preserving wine quality.
