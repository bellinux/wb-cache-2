Scholarly inquiry into household studies began in the 1960s with research emphasis upon a micro-scale analysis of social groups. Households are {{commonly referred to as}} the most basic social unit.

50|$|Family {{and kinship}} are {{the core of}} social life in Bangladesh. A family group {{residing}} in a bari functions as the basic unit of economic endeavor, landholding, and social identity. In the eyes of rural people, the chula defined the effective household—--an extended family exploiting jointly-held property and being fed from a jointly operated kitchen. A bari might consist {{of one or more}} such functional households, depending on the circumstances of family relationship. Married sons generally live in their parents' household during the father's lifetime. Although sons usually build separate houses for their nuclear families, they remain under their fathers' authority, and wives under their mothers-in-law's authority. The death of the father usually precipitates the separation of adult brothers into their own households. Such a split generally causes little change in the physical layout of the bari, however. Families at different stages of the cycle display different configurations of <b>household</b> <b>membership.</b>|$|E
40|$|Household {{formation}} {{analysis is}} both a multidimensional economical and statistical problem of great complexity. Since most of the literature tries to incorporate multiple economic aspects, there is, considering the extraordinary practical relevance of the problem, a remarkable gap between theory and application in this field. This paper tries to diminish this gap by a comprehensive treatise on the statistical site of the problem. Thus, we develop a model of household composition, where {{the evolution of the}} <b>household</b> <b>membership</b> rates is captured by a logit link-function and a multinomial distribution, which automatically fulfills the non-negativity and adding-up restrictions of the underlying probabilities. We use a varying-coefficients procedure by polynomially smoothing the <b>household</b> <b>membership</b> rates over age for every household size class and assuming a linear predictor in other variables. As an application we estimated and extrapolated the distribution of household sizes of an autonomous region using population register data. Our sample consisted of approximately 450, 000 people living in about 170, 000 households, grouped into nine different household size classes and classified into age classes from 0 to 90. The data covers a time span of 12 years, from 1986 to 1997. Empirical results show the robustness of the procedure even in case of low cell frequencies.

Therefore, the main study objective was to assess factors that influence the level of CHF household enrollment. To achieve the objectives, a cross-sectional descriptive study, which was also partially analytic, was adopted. The study findings revealed that: the level of CHF awareness at the household level was sub-optimal.

40|$|The authors empirically {{estimate}} {{the impact of}} social capital on household welfare in Bolivia [...] where they found 67 different types of local associations. They focus on <b>household</b> <b>memberships</b> in local associations as being especially relevant to daily decisions that affect household welfare and consumption. On average, households belong to 1. 4 groups and associations: 62 percent belong to agrarian syndicates, 16 percent to production groups, 13 percent to social service groups, and 10 percent to education and health groups. Smaller numbers belong to religious and government groups. Agrarian syndicates, created by government decree in 1952, are now viewed mainly as community-initiated institutions to manage conmunal resources. They have been registered as legal entities {{to work closely with}} municipalities to represent the interests and priorities of local people in municipal decisionmaking. The effects of social capital operate through (at least) three mechanisms: sharing of information among association members; the reduction of opportunistic behavior; and better collective decisionmaking. The effect of social capital on household welfare was found to be 2. 5 times that of human capital. Increasing the average educational endowment of each adult in the household by one year (about a 2. 5 -percent increase) would increase per capita household spending 4. 2 percent; a similar increase in the social capital endowment would increase spending 9 to 10. 5 percent. They measured social capital along six dimensions: density of memberships, internal heterogeneity of associations (by gender, age, education, religion, etc.), meeting attendance, active participation in decisionmaking, payment of dues (in cash and in kind), and community orientation. The strongest effect came from number of memberships. Active membership in an agrarian syndicate is associated with an average 11. 5 percent increase in <b>household</b> spending. <b>Membership</b> in another local association is associated with a 5. 3 -percent higher spending level. Empirical results partly confirm the hypothesis that social capital provides long-term benefits such as better access to credit and a higher level of trust in the community as a source of assistance in case of need.

40|$|The author empirically {{estimates}} {{how social}} capital affects household welfare and poverty in Indonesia. His focus: <b>household</b> <b>memberships</b> in local associations, {{an aspect of}} social capital especially relevant to daily household decisions that affect welfare and consumption. The data suggest that households with higher social capital spend more per capita. They also have more assets, more savings, and better access to credit. To estimate how social capital contributes to household welfare, the author uses a reduced-form model of household welfare, which controls for relevant household and location characteristics. He measures social capital along six dimensions: density of memberships, internal heterogeneity of associations (by age, gender, education, religion, and so on), meeting attendance, active participation in decision-making, payment of dues, and community orientation. The strongest effects come from: A) Number of memberships. Each additional membership (an average of 20 percent increase) raises per capita household spending 1. 5 percent. B) Internal heterogeneity. An increase of 20 percent in the heterogeneity index correlates with 3. 3 percent more spending. C) Active participation in decision making. An increase of 20 percent in the participation index correlates with 3. 2 percent more spending. The author also estimates structural equations and uses instrumental variable estimation and historical data to address the possible endogeneity of the social capital variable and {{to demonstrate that the}} causality runs from social capital to household welfare.
