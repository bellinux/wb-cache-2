40|$|Studies {{assessing}} {{the structure of}} coral reef fish assemblages have focused on shallow reefs {{and the importance of}} coral cover. However, the ecology of reef fish communities varies with depth, although trends in diversity, community structure and reliance on corals have seldom been described. Deeper reef habitats may provide refuge from shallow water disturbances, depending on the depth distributions of species and patterns of habitat specialisation with depth. We examined fish communities down to the bottoms of reefs at 20 m. Communities comprised species with preferences for shallow water and others with broader depth ranges, which were more abundant at greater depths. Diversity exhibited linear declines with depth. Species that were common around the mid-point of the depth gradient had the greatest depth ranges, whereas depth ranges were more restricted at the shallow and deep <b>extremes.</b> Niche <b>breadth</b> decreased with increasing mean depth of occurrence, suggesting that deeper species were more specialised. Unexpectedly, there was a higher association with branching corals in the deepest strata, suggesting a greater reliance on coral habitat at the patchy reef edge. Clearly, there are dramatic changes in the ecology of reef fishes and their habitat between 0 and 20 m, and a variety of physical and biological factors that are likely to be important. Although coral-associated species found deeper may occupy a refuge from shallow water disturbances, the narrow distributions of species at deeper depths and the high reliance on corals are unlikely to contribute to long-term resilience in relation to widespread reef degradation...|$|R

The bones surrounding the large openings for the nostrils formed deep pockets around the openings.

The skull roof was flat and lacked a bony crest, and the quadrate bone that formed the articulation with the lower jaw was distinctly curved. The lower jaw was long and straight, lacking the downward curve seen in other hadrosaurids, and possessing a heavy ridge running its length. The predentary was wide and shovel-like. The ridge on the lower jaw may have reinforced the long, slender structure.|$|R

Daumier became more and more the political spirit of the Charivari, or at least the political pencil, for M. Philipon, the breath of whose nostrils was opposition--one perceives from here the little bilious, bristling, ingenious, insistent man--is to be credited with a suggestive share in any enterprise in which he had a hand. This pencil played over public life, over the sovereign, the ministers, the deputies, the peers, the judiciary, the men and the measures, the reputations and scandals of the moment, with a strange, ugly, extravagant, but none the less sane and manly vigor. Daumier's sign is strength above all, and in turning over his pages to-day there is no intensity of force that the careful observer will not concede to him. It is perhaps another matter to assent to the proposition, put forth by his greatest admirers among his countrymen, that he is the first of all caricaturists. To the writer of this imperfect sketch he remains considerably less interesting than Gavarni; and/or a particular reason, which it is difficult to express otherwise than by saying that he is too simple. Simplicity was not Gavarni's fault, and indeed to a large degree it was Daumier's merit. The single grossly ridiculous or almost hauntingly characteristic thing which his figures represent is largely the reason why they still represent life and an unlucky reality years after the names attached to them have parted with a vivifying power. Such vagueness has overtaken them, for the most part, and to such a thin reverberation have they shrunk, the persons and the affairs which were then so intensely sketchable. Daumier handled them with a want of ceremony which would have been brutal were it not for the element of science in his work, making them immense and unmistakable in their drollery, or at least in their grotesqueness; for the term drollery suggests gayety, and Daumier is anything but gay.

[FN#1] Not {{more than}} {{one-quarter of the}} pilgrims who appear at Arafat go on to Al-Madinah: the expense, the hardships, and {{the dangers of the}} journey account for the {{smallness}} of the number. In theology it is “Jaiz,” or admissible, to begin with the Prophet’s place of burial. But those performing the “Hajjat al-Islam” are enjoined to commence at Meccah. [FN#2] When respectable married men live together in the same house, a rare occurrence, except on journeys, this most ungallant practice of clearing the way is and must be kept up in the East. [FN#3] I offer no lengthened description of the town of Meccah: Ali Bey and Burckhardt have already said all that requires saying. Although the origin of the Bayt Ullah be lost in the glooms of past time, the city is a comparatively modern place, built about A.D. 450, by Kusay and the Kuraysh. It contains about 30,000 to 45,000 inhabitants, with lodging room for at least treble that number; and the material of the houses is brick, granite, and sandstone from the neighbouring hills. The site is a winding valley, on a small plateau, half-way “below the Ghauts.” Its utmost length is two miles and a half from the Mab’dah (North) to the Southern mount Jiyad; and three-quarters of a mile would be the <b>extreme</b> <b>breadth</b> between Abu Kubays Eastward,—upon whose Western slope the most solid mass of the town clusters,—and Jabal Hindi Westward of the city. In the centre of this line stands the Ka’abah. I regret being unable to offer the reader a sketch of Meccah, or of the Great Temple. The stranger who would do this should visit the city out of the pilgrimage season, and hire a room looking into the quadrangle of the Harim. This addition to our knowledge is the more required, as our popular sketches (generally taken from D’Ohsson) are utterly incorrect. The Ka’abah is always a recognisable building; but the “View of Meccah” known to Europe is not more like Meccah than like Cairo or Bombay. [FN#4] It is curious that the Afghans should claim this Kuraysh noble as their compatriot. “On one occasion, when Khalid bin Walid was saying something in his native tongue (the Pushtu or Afghani), Mohammed remarked that assuredly that language was the peculiar dialect of the damned. As Khalid appeared to suffer from the observation, and to betray certain symptoms of insubordination, the Prophet condescended to comfort him by graciously pronouncing the words “Ghashe linda raora,” i.e., bring me my bow and arrows. (Remarks on Dr. Dorn’s Chrestomathy of the Pushtu or Afghan Language. Trans. Bombay As. Society, 1848.) [FN#5] See the ninth building of the Ka’abah, described in chap. iv. [FN#6] It requires not the ken of a prophet to foresee the day when political necessity—sternest of [Greek]!—will compel us to occupy in force the fountain-head of Al-Islam. [FN#7] Good acts done at Meccah are rewarded a hundred-thousand-fold in heaven; yet it is not auspicious to dwell there. Omar informs us that an evil deed receives the punishment of seventy. [FN#8] It must be remembered that my predecessor visited Meccah when the Egyptian army, commanded by Mohammed Ali, held the town. [FN#9] In another place I have ventured a few observations concerning the easy suppression of this traffic. [FN#10] The act is called “Tashrit,” or gashing. The body is also marked, but with smaller cuts, so that the child is covered with blood. Ali Bey was told by some Meccans that the face-gashes served for the purpose of phlebotomy, by others that they were signs that the scarred was the servant of Allah’s house. He attributes this male-gashing, like female-tat[t]ooing, to coquetry. The citizens told me that the custom arose from the necessity of preserving children from the kidnapping Persians, and that it is preserved as a mark of the Holy City. But its wide diffusion denotes an earlier origin. Mohammed expressly forbad his followers to mark the skin with scars. These “beauty marks” are common to the nations in the regions to the West of the Red Sea. The Barabarah of Upper Egypt adorn their faces with scars exactly like the Meccans. The Abyssinians moxa themselves in hetacombs for fashion’s sake. I have seen cheeks gashed, as in the Holy City, among the Gallas. Certain races of the Sawahil trace around the head a corona of little cuts, like those of a cupping instrument. And, to quote no other instances, some Somalis raise ghastly seams upon their chocolate-coloured skins. [FN#11] Sayrafi, money-changer; Sarraf, banker; the Indian “Shroff,” banker, money-changer, and usurer. [FN#12] When speaking of the Meccans I allude only to the section of society which fell under my observation, and that more extensive division concerning which I obtained notices that could be depended upon. [FN#13] The editor of Burckhardt’s “Travels in Arabia” supposes that his author’s “sect of light extinguishers” were probably Parsees from Surat or Bombay. The mistake is truly ludicrous, for no pious Parsee will extinguish a light. Moreover, infidels are not allowed by law to pass the frontiers of the Sanctuary. The sect alluded to is an obscure heresy in Central Asia; and concerning it the most improbable scandals have been propagated by the orthodox. [FN#14] It is strange how travellers and linguists differ upon the subject of Arabic and its dialects. Niebuhr compares their relation to that of Provençal, Spanish, and Italian, whereas Lane declares the dialects to resemble each other more than those of some different counties in England. Herbin (Grammar) draws a broad line between ancient and modern Arabic; but Hochst (Nachrichten von Marokos und Fez) asserts that the difference is not so great as is imagined. Perhaps the soundest opinion is that proposed by Clodius, in his “Arabic Grammar”: “dialectus Arabum vulgaris tantum differt ab erudita, quantum Isocrates dictio ab hodierna lingua Græca.” But it must be remembered that the Arabs divide their spoken and even written language into two orders, the “Kalam Wati,” or vulgar tongue, sometimes employed in epistolary correspondence, and the “Nahwi,” or grammatical and classical language. Every man of education uses the former, and can use the latter. And the Koran is no more a model of Arabic (as it is often assumed to be) than “Paradise Lost” is of English. Inimitable, no man imitates them. [FN#15] Safi Ullah—Adam. [FN#16] The legend that Abraham was the “Son of Fire” might have arisen from his birthplace, Ur of the Chaldees. This Ur (whence the Latin uro) becomes in Persian Hir; in Arabic Irr or Arr. It explains the origin of “Orotalt” better than by means of “Allahu Ta’ala.” This word, variously spelt Ourotalt, Orotalt, and Orotal (the latter would be the masculine form in Arabic), is Urrat-ilat, or the goddess of fire, most probably the Sun (Al-Shams) which the Semites make a feminine. Forbiggen translates it Sonnen-gott, an error of gender, as the final consonant proves. The other deity of pagan Arabia, Alilat, is clearly Al-Lat. May not the Phoenicians have supplied the word “Irr,” which still survives in Erin and in Ireland? even so they gave to the world the name of Britain, Brettainke, Barrat et Tanuki ([Arabic lettering]), the land of tin. And I should more readily believe that Eeran is the land of fire, than accept its derivation from Eer (vir) a man. [FN#17] Captain C. F. Head, author of “Eastern and Egyptian Scenery,” was, as late as A.D. 1829, pelted by the Badawin, because he passed the Eastern gate of Jeddah in a Frankish dress. [FN#18] The best way would be to rush, if possible, into a house; and the owner would then, for his own interest, as well as honour, defend a stranger till assistance could be procured. [FN#19] Future pilgrims must also remember that the season is gradually receding towards the heart of the hot weather. For the next fifteen years, therefore, an additional risk will attend the traveller. [FN#20] Pliny is certainly right about this useful quadruped and its congeners, the zebra and the wild ass, in describing it as “animal frigoris maxime impatiens.” It degenerates in cold regions, unless, as in Afghanistan and Barbary, there be a long, hot, and dry summer. Aden, Cutch, and Baghdad have fine breeds, whereas those of India and South-Eastern Africa are poor and weak. The best and the highest-priced come from the Maghrib, and second to them ranks the Egyptian race. At Meccah careful feeding and kind usage transform the dull slave into an active and symmetrical friend of man: he knows his owner’s kind voice, and if one of the two fast, it is generally the biped. The asses of the Holy City are tall and plump, with sleek coats, generally ash or grey-coloured, the eyes of deer, heads gracefully carried, an ambling gait, and extremely sure-footed. They are equal to great fatigue, and the stallions have been known, in their ferocity, to kill the groom. The price varies from 25 to 150 dollars. [FN#21] Such is the popular version of the tale, which differs in some points from that recorded in books. Others declare that here, in days gone by, stood the house of another notorious malignant, Abu Jahl. Some, again, suppose that in this place a tyrannical governor of Meccah was summarily “lynched” by the indignant populace. The first two traditions, however, are the favourites, the vulgar—citizens, as well as pilgrims—loving to connect such places with the events of their early sacred history. Even in the twelfth century we read that pilgrims used to cast stones at two cairns, covering the remains of Abu Lahab, and the beautiful termagant, his wife. [FN#22] Certain credulous authors have contrasted these heaps with the clear ground at Muna, for the purpose of a minor miracle. According to them this cairn steadily grows, as we may believe it would; and that, {{were it not for the}} guardian angels, the millions of little stones annually thrown at the devils would soon form a mass of equal magnitude. This custom of lapidation, in token of hate, is an ancient practice, still common in the East. Yet, in some parts of Arabia, stones are thrown at tombs as a compliment to the tenant. And in the Somali country, the places where it is said holy men sat, receive the same doubtful homage. [FN#23] It is called in books Al-Tanim (bestowing plenty); a word which readers must not confound with the district of the same name in the province Khaulan (made by Niebuhr the “Thumna,” “Thomna,” or “Tamna,” capital of the Catabanites). Other authors apply Al-Tanim to the spot where Abu Lahab is supposed to lie. There are two places called Al-Umrah near Meccah. The Kabir, or greater, is, I am told, in the Wady Fatimah, and the Prophet ordered Ayishah and her sister to begin the ceremonies at that place. It is now visited by picnic parties and those who would pray at the tomb of Maimunah, one of the Prophet’s wives. Modern pilgrims commence always, I am told, at the Umrah Saghir (the Lesser), which is about half-way nearer the city. [FN#24] Some assume the Ihram garb at this place. [FN#25] We had still the pretext of my injured foot. When the Sai rite is performed, as it should be, by a pedestrian, he mounts the steps to about the height of a man, and then turns towards the temple. [FN#26] I will not trouble the reader with this Niyat, which is the same as that used in the Tawaf rite. [FN#27] Almost every Mutawwif, it must be remembered, has his own set of prayers. [FN#28] “Safa” means a large, hard rock; “Marwah,” hard, white flints, full of fire. [FN#29] In former times a devastating torrent used to sweep this place after rains. The Fiumara bed has now disappeared, and the pillars are used as landmarks. Galland observes that these columns are planted upon the place which supported Eve’s knees, when, after 300 years’ separation, she was found by Adam. [FN#30] This house is called in books Rubat al-Abbas. [FN#31] Here once stood “As’af” and “Naylah,” two idols, some say a man and a woman metamorphosed for stupration in the Temple. [FN#32] Koran, chap. ii. [FN#33] Ibn Jubayr gives 893 steps: other authorities make the distance 780 short cubits, the size of an average man’s forearm. [FN#34] The ceremony of running between Safa and Marwah is supposed to represent Hagar seeking water for her son. Usually pilgrims perform this rite on the morning of visiting the Ka’aba.|$|E

Few examples of the broad, relativistic iron line profile have been found by XMM-Newton, although in MCG - 6 - 30 - 15, the <b>extreme</b> <b>breadth</b> of the broad line component may imply a Kerr metric for the central black hole. Generally, relativistic Fe K line profiles are not required {{in a number of other}} Seyfert 1 X-ray spectra.

40|$|Abstract. We report Keck {{high-resolution}} echelle spectroscopic {{observations of}} two very cool field dwarfs {{discovered by the}} near-IR photometric survey DENIS. DENIS-P J 1228. 2 - 1547 shows a conspicuous LiI resonance line that confirms it as an incontrovertible brown dwarf (BD). From the presence of Li, and its low surface temperature, we estimate from theoretical models a mass and an age upper limit of ∼ 60 jupiters and ∼ 10 9 years. The other DENIS object shows no detectable LiI line in our data, and thus we infer a mass ≥ 60 jupiters for it. It could be a high-mass BD or very low-mass star. Both objects have modest radial velocities that suggest they are kinematically young. They show the strongest and broadest resonance line profiles from low ionization species ever seen. The <b>extreme</b> <b>breadth</b> of the KI lines are good further indicators of the expected high gravity in very low-mass dwarfs. We suggest a new spectral class, “L”, for objects cooler than M-type (as these are) that do not show TiO molecular bands. The confirmation {{of at least one}} field BD in only ∼ 1 % of the final DENIS survey is a strong indication of the presence of a numerous population of these objects in the solar neighborhood...|$|E
40|$|The 4 E 10 {{antibody}} displays an <b>extreme</b> <b>breadth</b> of HIV- 1 neutralization {{and therefore}} constitutes a suitable model system for structure-guided vaccine design and immunotherapeutics against AIDS. In this regard, {{the relevance of}} autoreactivity with membrane lipids for the biological function of this antibody is still a subject of controversy. To address this dispute, herein we have compared the membrane partitioning ability of the 4 E 10 antibody and several of its variants, which were mutated at {{the region of the}} paratope surface in contact with the membrane interface. We first employed a physical separation approach (vesicle flotation) and subsequently carried out quantitative fluorescence measurements in an intact system (spectroscopic titration), using 4 E 10 Fab labeled with a polarity-sensitive fluorescent probe. Moreover, recognition of epitope peptide in membrane was demonstrated by photo-cross-linking assays using a Fab that incorporated the genetically encoded unnatural amino acid p-benzoylphenylalanine. The experimental data ruled out that the proposed stereospecific recognition of viral lipids was necessary for the function of the antibody. In contrast, our data suggest that nonspecific electrostatic interactions between basic residues of 4 E 10 and acidic phospholipids in the membranes contribute to the observed biological function. Moreover, the energetics of membrane partitioning indicated that 4 E 10 behaves as a peripheral membrane protein, tightening the binding to the ligand epitope inserted in the viral membrane. The implications of these findings for the natural production and biological function of this antibody are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} self-concentration and intermolecular packing on the {{dynamics}} of polyisoprene (PI) /polystyrene (PS) blends is examined by extensive atomistic simulations. Direct information on local structure of the blend system allows a quantitative calculation of self- and effective composition terms at various length scales that are introduced to proposed models of blend dynamics. Through a detailed statistical analysis, the full distribution of relaxation times associated with reorienation of carbon-hydrogen bonds was extracted and compared to literature experimental data. A direct relation between relaxation times and local effective composition is found. Following an implementation of a model involving local composition as well as concentration fluctuations the relevant length scales characterizing the segmental dynamics of both components were critically examined. For PI the distribution of times becomes narrower for the system with the lowest PS content and then broadens as more PS is added. This {{is in contrast to}} the slow component (PS), where an <b>extreme</b> <b>breadth</b> is found for relaxation times in the 25 / 75 system prior to narrowing as we increase PI concentration. The chain dynamics was directly quantified by diffusion coefficients as well as the terminal (maximum) relaxation time of each component in the mixed state. Strong coupling between the friction coefficients of the two components was predicted that leads to very similar chain dynamics for PI and PS, particularly for high concentrations of PI. We anticipate this finding to the rather short oligomers (below the Rouse regime) studied here {{as well as to the}} rather similar size of PI and PS chains. The ratio of the terminal to the segmental relaxation time, τterm/τseg,c, presents a clear qualitative difference for the constituents: for PS the above ratio is almost independent of blend composition and very similar to the pure state. In contrast, for PI this ratio depends strongly on the composition of the blend; i. e. the terminal relaxation time of PI increases more than its segmental relaxation time, as the concentration of PS increases, resulting into a larger terminal/segmental ratio. We explain this disparity, based on the different length scales characterizing dynamics. The relevant length for the segmental dynamics of PI is about 0. 4 - 0. 6 nm, smaller than chain dimensions which are expected to characterize terminal dynamics, whereas for PS associated length scales are similar (about 0. 7 - 1. 0 nm) rendering a uniform change with mixing...|$|E
40|$|Vertical {{distributions}} and spectral {{characteristics of}} Titan's photochemical aerosol and stratospheric ices are determined between 20 and 560 per centimeter (500 - 18 micrometers) from the Cassini Composite Infrared Spectrometer (CIRS). Results are obtained for latitudes of 15 N, 15 S, and 58 S, where accurate temperature profiles can be independently determined. In addition, estimates of aerosol and ice abundances at 62 N relative to those at 15 S are derived. Aerosol abundances are comparable {{at the two}} latitudes, but stratospheric ices are approximately 3 times more abundant at 62 N than at 15 S. Generally, nitrile ice clouds (probably HCN and HC 3 N), as inferred from a composite emission feature at approximately 160 per centimeter, appear to be located over a narrow altitude range in the stratosphere centered at approximately 90 km. Although most abundant at high northern latitudes, these nitrile ice clouds extend down through low latitudes and into mid southern latitudes, {{at least as far}} as 58 S. There is some evidence of a second ice cloud layer at approximately 60 km altitude at 58 S associated with an emission feature at approximately 80 per centimeter. We speculate that the identify of this cloud may be due to C 2 H 6 ice, which in the vapor phase is the most abundant hydrocarbon (next to CH 4) in the stratosphere of Titan. Unlike the highly restricted range of altitudes (50 - 100 km) associated with organic condensate clouds, Titan's photochemical aerosol appears to be well-mixed from the surface to the top of the stratosphere near an altitude of 300 km, and the spectral shape does not appear to change between 15 N and 58 S latitude. The ratio of aerosol-to-gas scale heights range from 1. 3 - 2. 4 at about 160 km to 1. 1 - 1. 4 at 300 km, although there is considerable variability with latitude, The aerosol exhibits a very broad emission feature peaking at approximately 140 per centimeter. Due to its <b>extreme</b> <b>breadth</b> and low wavenumber, we speculate that this feature may be caused by low-energy vibrations of two-dimensional lattice structures of large molecules. Examples of such molecules include polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and nitrogenated aromatics. Finally, volume extinction coefficients N chi EPSILON derived from 15 S CIRS data at a wavelength of lambda = 62. 5 micrometers are compared with those derived from the 10 S Huygens Descent Imager/Spectral Radiometer (DISR) data at 1. 583 micrometers. This comparison yields volume extinction coefficient ratios N chi EPSILON (1. 583 micrometers) /N chi EPSILON (62. 5 micrometers) of roughly 70 and 20, respectively, for Titan's aerosol and stratospheric ices, The inferred particle cross-section ratios chi EPSILON(1. 583 micrometers) /chi EPSILON (62. 5 micrometers) appear to be consistent with sub-micron size aerosol particles, and effective radii of only a few microns for stratospheric ice cloud particles...|$|E
