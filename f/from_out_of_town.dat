500|$|The {{building}} {{now used}} as the White Spring Temple was originally a Victorian-built well house, erected by the local water board in 1872. Around that time, an outbreak of cholera in the area caused great concern and the natural caves were dug out, and a stone collection chamber was constructed to ensure the flow of a quality water supply. Study {{of the flow of}} water into the collection chamber has shown that the builders also tapped into other springs, besides the White Spring and judging from the high iron content of one of these springs, it appears that a small offshoot of Chalice Well finds its way under Well House Lane to emerge beside the White Spring.

Later in the same rally another Reform Party supporter stood up and said “Let them [...] go.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} extent to which office {{activity}} contributes to travel-related CO 2 emission. Travel accounts for 32 % of UK CO 2 emission and commuting and business travel accounts for a fifth of transport-related CO 2 emissions, equating to 6. 4 % of total UK emissions. Figures from the Department for Transport (2006) report that 70 % of commuting trips were made by car, accounting for 73 % of all commuting miles travelled. In assessing the environmental performance of an office building, the paper questions whether commuting and business travel-related CO 2 emission is being properly assessed. For example, are office buildings in locations that are easily accessible by public transport being sufficiently rewarded? The de facto method for assessing the environmental performance of office buildings in the UK is the Building Research Establishment’s Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM). Using data for Bristol, this paper examines firstly whether BREEAM places sufficient weight on travel-related CO 2 emission in comparison with building operation-related CO 2 emission, and secondly whether the methodology for assigning credits for for travel-related CO 2 emission efficiency is capable of discerning intra-urban differences in location such as city centre and out-of-town. The results show that, despite CO 2 emission per worker from building operation and travel being comparable, there is a substantial difference in the credit-weighting allocated to each. Under the current version of BREEAM for offices, only a maximum of 4 % of the available credits can be awarded for ensuring the office location is environmentally sustainable. The results also show that all locations within the established city centre of Bristol will receive maximum BREEAM credits. Given the parameters of the test there is little to distinguish one city centre location <b>from</b> another and <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>town</b> only one office location receives any credits. It would appear from these results that the assessment method is not able to discern subtle differences in the sustainability of office locations. transport, CO 2, real estate, environmental performance...|$|R
