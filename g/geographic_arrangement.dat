40|$|The {{theory of}} {{ecological}} speciation suggests that adaptation to different habitats promotes {{the formation of}} new species (speciation), but debates persist {{about the extent to}} which this can occur when populations are in geographic contact and exchange genes (i. e. gene flow). Multilocus genetic analysis (using multiple genes) can inform this debate by comparing levels of genetic divergence between taxa (groups such as species) at different points in the speciation process and with differing <b>geographic</b> <b>arrangements.</b> For example, taxa undergoing less gene flow are predicted to exhibit stronger genetic divergence than taxa undergoing more gene flow. Furthermore, multilocus data can be used to test for genealogical discordance—a scenario where different genes tell different evolutionary histories, due to being differentially affected by evolutionary processes such as selection, mutation, and gene flow. The present study uses multilocus genetic data (four nuclear genes and a mitochondrial gene) to compare the genetic structure of sic populations of herbivorous Timema walking-sticks with different geographic relationships: two diverging host-associated ecotypes (phenotypically and ecologically different groups) of T. cristinae in parapatry (geographic contact) and allopatry (geographic separation), and two closely related species, T. californicum and T. poppensis, in parapatry and allopatry. As expected, we observe that species are generally more genetically differentiated than ecotypes. Interestingly, however, allopatric populations are not always significantly more differentiated than parapatric populations. Also genealogical discordance was observed. Mitochondrial differentiation among allopatric T. cristinae population was stronger than nuclear differentiation. In contrast, mitochondrial differentiation between T. californicum and T. poppensis was weak, whereas nuclear genes were differentiated to the point of reciprocal monophyly, indicative of genetically distinct species. While these data strongly suggest differing levels of gene flow among genes and taxa, further analyses using coalescent-based models should be done to estimate gene flow specifically...|$|R

We also document temporal patterns of change in dominant benthic functional groups that have taken place over the past 15 years at selected sites on this isolated Pacific island.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{evaluate}} the supply of markers for the identification of syringes distributed by pharmacy needle exchanges and to determine if this product and service delivery offers a feasible method of marking syringes to promote the reduction of accidental sharing of syringes and needles amongst injecting drug users (IDU) and thereby reduce the risk of transmission of blood borne viruses (BBVs) and other related infections. This study involves the assessment, implementation and evaluation of syringe markers as a pilot study within three community pharmacy sites in Glasgow. The secondary aims of the study were to identify whether the supply of syringe markers from community pharmacy needle exchanges was acceptable to IDU and if it enabled them to mark their syringes. The literature review demonstrates that providing a means of identification of personal injecting equipment has been proposed as a viable option that should be promoted to prevent the inadvertent accidental sharing of syringes within a group setting. Needle exchanges (NEX) are important component parts of the harm reduction responses designed to reduce the physical health harms caused to individuals through injecting drug use. The literature is reviewed on BBV transmission and the historical, legal and policy context associated with the development of NEXs. Community pharmacies act as a source of health advice and can help to facilitate access to treatment services for those attending the NEX. However the specific {{aim of this}} study is not to investigate the totality of the benefits of a NEX but to examine the supply of a potential means of reducing accidental and unintentional sharing of all injecting equipment and thereby contribute to minimising some of the health harms linked to injecting drug use. Three established community pharmacies were identified as suitable sites to pilot the supply of syringe markers. A number of criteria were used to select the sites. These included an assessment of the <b>geographic</b> locations, staffing <b>arrangements,</b> NEX attendances and transactional activity and the availability of private consultation facilities. The health board central database which holds records on a range of factors including, the characteristics of those who attend NEX and detailed information on all transactions, was used to identify the most suitable sites to pilot the new intervention. This indicated that the characteristics of those who attended the three chosen sites were broadly similar to the wider NEX attending population. The evaluation was conducted in two separate periods. The first 4 week period was the supply phase where markers were distributed over this period to all patients receiving NEX packs from the 3 pharmacies. The second data collection phase was undertaken in the following 4 week period. Data was collected by means of a structured questionnaire. In order to reduce the potential interviewer bias it was decided to incorporate the use of peer researchers in the administration of the questionnaire. The Scottish Drugs Forum (SDF) was approached and agreement was reached to use members of the Service User Involvement Group (SUIG) to assist with the design and administration of the questionnaire.

40|$|Graduation date: 2013 Recent {{climate change}} {{forecasts}} have aroused {{growing interest in}} the influence of water scarcity and climate on agricultural production and irrigation practice. However, it is common in the economic literature to aggregate disparate crops when modeling irrigation choices. That approach confounds the crop-specific effects of climate and water scarcity that govern such choices. Given the sensitivity of agricultural production to water scarcity and climate, understanding their influence on irrigation choices is a key contribution to policy evaluation. This paper addresses the impact of water scarcity and climate on irrigation choices through estimated models of cropland proportion irrigated (PI), and crop-specific irrigation technology choice (TC) and water application rates (AR). This approach is applied to agricultural production data for major crops (orchard/vineyard, vegetable, wheat, alfalfa, hay, and pasture) on the West Coast (California, Oregon, and Washington). Crop-specific modeling provides information about the distributional impacts of agricultural policy and climate change. This advantage is particularly important for the diverse agricultural landscape of the West Coast, where the distributional impacts of policy can be complex. The most important policy implications that are found involve asset heterogeneity and the distributional impacts of agricultural policy. Several findings provide valuable information about how irrigators would respond and adapt to climate change. The current findings also lead to commonly advocated revisions to federal water subsidy policies. Some key differences between the irrigation choices of higher- and lower-value crops are also identified. Identifying these differences sheds further light on the distributional consequences of agricultural policy. Many findings from this research are crop-specific and will have {{a high degree of}} policy relevance to irrigation districts or other agricultural jurisdictions that cultivate some of the West Coast's major crops. Furthermore, the data used in this research has a large degree of variation in water scarcity and climate, making the findings applicable to other Mediterranean climates in the world. It is found that specific crops have a proclivity for certain irrigation technologies that can mitigate particular climatic stressors (i. e., frost damage and heat stress). For example, the results indicate that water pricing policies will tend not to encourage water conservation by technology adoption for many orchards, vineyards, and vegetable farms, thereby imposing pure costs to these producers. In essence, climate heterogeneity limits options available to farmers and reduces the set of production technologies that a farm can use. This finding exemplifies that with climate heterogeneity, the distribution of water policy impacts depends on prior land allocation decisions such as crop choices. Heterogeneity in land quality is also found to have important influences on TC. The effects of temperature on irrigation choices are found to be more profound than the effects of precipitation. Because of the large study region used, the effects of temperature and precipitation on irrigation choices are often found to be quadratic-like. These quadratic-like relationships reveal thresholds where irrigators begin to respond very differently to climate. However, {{this was not the case}} for all crops. Thus, it is demonstrated that the effects of climate on irrigation choices are crop-dependent. The results indicate that for several crops, the discontinuance of irrigation water (i. e., water supply or price uncertainty) creates an option value that delays and discourages adoption of water-saving technologies. The discontinuance of irrigation water is also shown to reduce water demand at the farm-level extensive proportion (i. e., PI) and crop-level intensive margin (i. e., AR). Water price is found to impact all three irrigation choices as well. Well depth is found to facilitate adoption of water-saving technologies for several crops. This paper demonstrates that irrigation choices are highly dependent on water scarcity and climate. Institutional <b>arrangements,</b> <b>geographic</b> qualities of the farm, and demographic characteristics of the farmer also exhibit important influences on irrigation choices. By using crop-specific equations, quadratic climate variables, and a study region with large variation in climate conditions, this research resolves many inconsistent findings regarding the determinants of irrigation choices. Furthermore, this study establishes a research agenda for crop-specific analysis of irrigation choices. Some of the estimated results warrant verification with further studies. Future crop-specific irrigation choice studies would benefit from panel micro data with improved land quality variables, and seasonal or monthly climate variables that are better able to identify the effects of climate stress (e. g., heat stress and frost damage) on irrigation choices...|$|R

In such insects, divergent selection between host plants might occur for cryptic colouration (camouflage to evade visual predation), physiology (to detoxify plant chemicals), or both of these niche dimensions.

Biologists estimate annual loss of species at 1, 000 times or more greater than historic rates, and linguists predict that 50 – 90 % of the world’s languages will disappear {{by the end of}} this century. Prior studies indicate similarities in the <b>geographic</b> <b>arrangement</b> of biological and linguistic diversity, although conclusions have often been constrained by use of data with limited spatial precision. Here we use greatly improved datasets to explore the co-occurrence of linguistic and biological diversity in regions containing many of the Earth’s remaining species: biodiversity hotspots and high biodiversity wilderness areas.

Moreover, the languages involved are frequently unique (endemic) to particular regions, with many facing extinction. Likely reasons for co-occurrence of linguistic and biological diversity are complex and appear to vary among localities, although strong geographic concordance between biological and linguistic diversity in many areas argues for some form of functional connection.

40|$|Understanding the geographic, geologic, and climatic forces {{responsible}} for generating current patterns of biodiversity {{has been a}} central objective of phylogeography. To develop {{a better understanding of}} these processes in the North American arid lands, I used DNA sequence data and species distribution modeling to conduct three phylogeographic assessments incorporating four species of arid-adapted scorpions:Hadrurus arizonensis, H. jedediah, H. spadix,and Paruroctonus becki. In an assessment of H. arizonensis, phylogeographic patterns indicate that Pleistocene climate cycles and associated glacial refugia {{played a central role in}} structuring the genetic diversity of this species in the Mojave and Sonoran deserts, mostly supporting predictions from a recent model of historical biotic assembly for these regions. However, the phylogeography of H. arizonensis also revealed a potential glacial refugium along the Lower Colorado River Valley that had not been considered in previous evaluations. To assess the impact that Pleistocene climate fluctuations had in other North American arid lands, I then compared phylogeographic patterns from H. jedediah and H. spadix, to those from H. arizonensis. Since these three species are closely related and morphologically similar, effects from phylogenetic signal and divergent phenotypes should have been minimal, so differences in phylogeographic patterns should reflect the relative influence of Pleistocene climates in different regions. Under this assumption, comparative phylogeography of these three species suggest that the impact of glacial climates was most pronounced for the biotas of the Great Basin and Snake River Plain, over those in the Colorado Plateau, and Mohave and Sonoran deserts. Finally, I conducted a phylogeography of P. becki, an unrelated species that spans the Mojave Desert and western Great Basin. Phylogenetic analyses identified five mitochondrial lineages in P. becki. The timing and <b>geographic</b> <b>arrangement</b> of these lineages supports a vicariant origin associated with the tectonically dynamic Eastern California Shear Zone. In association with these deeper patterns, demographic analyses indicated that a lineage in the Great Basin had undergone a recent post-glacial expansion, which according to predictions from climate-based models and a landscape interpolation of genetic distances, probably occurred from refugial areas in the northwest Great Basin. In general, phylogeographic assessments of North American arid land scorpions support phylogeographic inferences from co-distributed organisms, but add a novel glacial refugium in the Mojave Desert and a unique pattern of post-glacial expansions from an area within the Great Basin...|$|E
40|$|Many new and {{renewable}} forms of electricity generation are small scale and geographically {{constrained by the}} resource they use. They are connected into the local electricity distribution network rather than the national transmission network and are known as Distributed Generators (DGs). The developers (or owners) of such DG choose the location and capacity of their plant to maximise the economic benefit that arises. However, the distribution network was not planned and designed to accommodate such DG and various problems can arise such as voltage magnitude disturbance, excessive power flow in certain lines, excess fault levels, reverse power flows through the Grid Supply Point (GSP) transformers and increased power losses. For this reason, the Distribution Network Operator (DNO) may limit the capacity of plant built or constrain its output under certain operating conditions. Such constraints clearly affect the economic case for the plant. Traditionally, the economic and technical aspects of DG plant planning {{have been carried out}} sequentially and not in an integrated fashion. This thesis investigates how to combine the two sets of analysis such that both sets of influences are brought to bear in one process in choosing an optimum plant capacity. By using the proposed methodology, the interests of both the DG owner and the DNO are served. The proposed Techno-Economic assessment tool has been developed for an example case of a biomass fuelled generator. The key factors considered in the economic analysis are biomass yield density, transportation costs, capital costs of plant and the value of unit electricity. An economically optimum plant can be found based on the optimum radius of collection area. The issue of network constraints have been investigated by using load flow analysis techniques with various case study networks. The networks are real examples from the UK distribution network, chosen to give a variety of meshed and radial structures and load densities. From the load flow analysis,indications of breaches of network constraints are generated and sensitivity indices are produced which allow the proposed DG plants within the area to be constrained in various ways depending on the optimisation objectives chosen. Conclusions are also drawn {{on the extent to which}} the network structure and the <b>geographic</b> <b>arrangement</b> of load in a network affect the siting and sizing of the optimal DG plant. Further factors that affect the economics of a biomass plant are also considered. These include an analysis of the effect of the physical shape as well as the location of the collection area. Other potential sources of revenue in addition to the sale of electrical energy, include incentives for renewable energy including carbon trading and Renewable Obligation Certificates (ROCs) and the potential to provide various ancillary services to the network. The effect that these additional sources of revenue may have on the Techno-Economic feasibility analysis have also been investigated. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|The urban {{landscape}} is an interspersed mixing of residences, shops, theaters, parks, natural areas, and {{a multitude of}} other uses. From {{the early days of}} the central markets, to the planned downtown, to the heavily planned super-regional shopping complexes, commercial landscapes evolve. There has been considerable research conducted on analyzing the commercial structure of urban environments in an attempt to better understanding the nature of retailing and its resultant impacts on the geography of the city. This research has three broad goals: a) to develop a technique that makes operational, in a systematized and objective manner, an approach to analyzing the structure of the commercial environment; b) to apply the approach within a GIS environment, and; c) to develop a generalized typology of urban commercial structure. The systematized analysis is a series of guidelines and statistics which can be applied in an objective manner. The development of the nearest commercial neighbor as a statistical measure of proximity to other commercial operations was the foundation of the approach to clustering commercial operations in to retail areas. To achieve the overall goals, three census metropolitan environments (Sudbury, Kitchener and Ottawa) were used as study areas. These cities represent small, medium and large census metropolitan environments, respectively, within Canada. Commercial locations for each city were extracted from a national database of locations and mapped in a GIS environment. For each study area, the nearest commercial neighbor values were generated and the appropriate statistics extracted. Commercial clusters were generated by using the average nearest commercial neighbor value and multiples of the median commercial neighbor value. These nearest neighbor and median values were inputted into a buffering routine as the buffer size. The resulting clusters were then compared to ortho-imagery and in the case of Kitchener, land use planning documents. Two approaches for cluster generation were employed; 1) Point-only where all individual addresses were used on the clustering, and; 2) Point plus Polygon where those commercial operations that existed within polygons (malls and central business districts) were removed from the dataset, the remaining points were then clusters and the polygons added back to the results. Finally the results from both clustering approaches were compared to land use parcels to assess accuracies of the technique. The results indicated that the overall method proposed was effective in determining commercial zones, and that the 2 x iteration of the median nearest commercial neighbor technique yielded the most accurate results. Moreover, three main conclusions were drawn. The first was that there was a difference, and in some cases significant differences, between the land use planned commercial areas and areas that have grown larger through agglomeration. Secondly, there are density variations between core and suburban areas that, at times, resulted in a larger definition of a commercial area within the core because the lesser dense suburban areas having an impact on the nearest commercial neighbor values. Thirdly, there was considerable over-capturing of commercial areas when the buffer multiples were greater than 3 x. In addition, the point plus polygon clustering technique indicated that while the defined areas were more accurate when the polygons were used, it was only in areas where those polygons were the main commercial cluster. In mixed areas, there was no discernable advantage to using the polygons. Furthermore, the removal of points had a strong impact of the nearest commercial neighbor values generated. Lastly, when dealing with polygons, the <b>geographic</b> <b>arrangement</b> of the commercial type became important. Based on the findings of the commercial zone analysis, a typology of commercial development was detailed. This typology contained three main geographic components, namely the core, suburb and gateway areas of the urban environment. Within each geographic location, a series of commercial forms were identified. This new typology allowed for the inclusion of historical remnants of landscapes and consequently allows for a comparison against older typologies. The typology employed a three part urban classification system which is applicable to any type of urban environment and, finally, the focus on geographic form removes the impact of store changes and the changes in the nature of commercial zones over time. This research has operationalized a systematic and replicable method of examining urban commercial location data for the purpose of determining commercial structure. This technique can be applied to future datasets easily and objectively allowing for a readily updatable typology; thus rendering it less static than previous typologies. It is the use of the technology, namely GIS, that adds this dynamism to the analyses. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that the potential exists for using GIS to analyze commercial location data. This research has contributed to this evolution by analyzing the geography of commercial development during a snapshot in time. However, by developing a series of operational and repeatable techniques that focus on the geographical organization of commercial locations, it is hoped that the results will function as the conceptual and practical framework for commercial structural analysis of urban environments for future studies...|$|E
