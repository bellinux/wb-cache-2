25|$|The late 20th century saw {{a wave of}} {{winemaking}} {{innovation and}} the popularization of several winemaking techniques.

By stirring the lees, the dead yeast come into greater contact with the wood-based tannins and pigments that are usually extracted into the wine. The lees act {{as a sort of}} buffer between the wines and the oak elements, allowing the wine to maintain its color and not become too harsh and tannic. In the late 1990s, more Muscadet producers started extending {{the amount of time that}} the must spends in contact with the grape skins prior to fermentation. This extended maceration allowed the wine to leach more phenolic compounds from the skin which can add complexity to the wine.|$|R

Membrane distillation technology replaces the dryer to enrich the glutamic acid neutralizer, and improves the concentration of sodium glutamate in the glutamic acid neutralizer. The membrane distillation flux of glutamic acid neutralizer changes along the concentration multiple curve. It shows that with concentration up to 60 %，the glutamic acid neutralizer will supersaturate when crystal comes up and the membrane distillation can't go on. The color and conductivity of product water suggest that some volatile substances are formed. Peak time difference between glutamate filtrate gas chromatography and product water of the membrane distillated glutamic acid neutralizer does not exceed 0. 1 min, and thus indicates that four volatile substances from product water are derived from glutamic acid filtrate.

50|$|A {{byproduct}} of the energy created during fermentation is heat which raises {{the temperature of the}} fermenting must as the yeast work. When temperatures near 104°F (40°C), activity slows and yeast start to die. If temperatures stay high and the yeast stop reproducing then the fermentation is at grave risk of getting stuck. Even if the must is cooled back down, fermentation will be very difficult to restart due to a chemical compound released by the dying yeast that serves as an inhibitor to the growth of future yeast cells in the batch. Modern winemaking equipment includes temperature control mechanisms such as stainless steel <b>fermenting</b> <b>tanks</b> with a cooling jacket to help regulate temperatures. Another potential cause is a combination of lack of oxygen and yeast nutrients found in the lipids suspended in grape solids. In the absence of oxygen, yeast will seek out the lipids in grape solid as a source of nutrients to sustain its activity. If the wine is lacking grape solids (such as if the wine's been clarified) then the yeast are at risk of starving and causing the fermentation to get stuck. This risk is lower for red wines which are often fermented with their skins in open air containers or oak wine barrels which provide plenty of oxygen and grape solids for the yeast to feed on.|$|R

40|$|The Thi 8 s {{abattoir}} in Senegal is {{no longer}} a source of environmental pollution. The solid waste from slaughtered animals is <b>fermented</b> in a <b>tank.</b> This produces compost and biogas, the biogas being used to provide power to the abattoir. The waste water is purified by a lagoon system. Vast pastoral regions stretch across the Sahel and the huge number of animals slaughtered causes serious pollution problems around the region's abattoirs. More than 15, 500 tonnes of animal waste pile up each year in the areas surrounding the cities causing pollution and, because they produce methane, intensifying the greenhouse effect. Furthermore, 570, 000 cubic metres of waste water are released every year into water systems, such as the Hann Bay in Dakar, the Niger River at Niamey or the Abidjan lagoon, which are often already over-saturated by pollutants. Specialists addressing this problem have rejected the use of traditional purifying stations primarily on the grounds of cost, but also because abattoir waste is rich in organic matter which could be put to good use. Since 1989 the Soci 9 t 9 d'exploitation des ressources animales au S 9 n 9 gal (SERAS), together with the Centre de coop 9 ration internationale en recherche agronomique pour le d 9 veloppement (CIRAD), has been operating a pilot scheme for the treatment of animal waste from the abattoir in Thi 8 s, Senegal's second city. The results of this project will be transferred from Thi 8 s to the Dakar slaughterhouse, where 43, 000 tonnes of untreated waste are dumped in the Hann Bay annually, not counting the water used for rinsing the hides, which is full of extremely toxic substances such as arsenic. A solution to this problem was long overdue especially since Senegal, in common with most other countries across Africa, is now considering bringing in regulations for the disposal of animal waste products and introducing taxes on pollution. Fermenting and composting the solid waste The waste which once polluted the environment of Thi 8 s (stomach contents, blood, faecal and visceral matter) is nowadays put in a large tank, the Transpaille fermenter, where it decomposes. 2000 t of carcasses and 480 t of waste products produce 55 t of compost. 'The chemical and biological fertility of cultivated land is hard to maintain, especially in tropical regions, and organic enrichment is necessary. The compost produced by treating abattoir waste is a new and high-quality form of fertilizer,' explains ClRAD's Jean-Luc Farinet. There are no difficulties in finding outlets for this compost near Niayes, where there are 10, 000 ha of market gardens. The only problem is the price, which at 42 FCFA per kg gross is considerably higher than the 15 FCFA charged for groundnut powder, the fertilizer traditionally used in Senegal. To offset this disadvantage the Thi 8 s abattoir has launched a range of garden-ready seedlings in soil packs which are composed of 75...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MSc (Wine Biotechnology)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2009. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: Fermentation is {{a complex}} process in which raw {{materials}} are transformed into high-value products, in this case, grape juice into wine. In this modern and economically competitive society, it is increasingly important to consistently produce wine to definable specifications and styles. Process management throughout the production stage is therefore crucial to achieve effective control over the process and consistent wine quality. Problematic wine fermentations directly impact on cellar productivity {{and the quality of}} wine. Anticipating stuck or sluggish fermentations, or simply being able to foresee the progress of a given fermentation, would be extremely useful for an enologist or winemaker, who could then take suitable corrective steps where necessary, and ensure that vinifications conclude successfully. Conventional methods of fermentation monitoring are time consuming, sometimes unreliable, and the information limited to a few parameters only. The current effectiveness of fermentation monitoring in industrial wine production can be much improved. Winemakers currently lack the tools to identify early signs of undesirable fermentation behaviour and to take preventive actions. This study investigated the application of Fourier transform mid infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy in transmission mode, for the quantitative and qualitative monitoring of alcoholic fermentation during industrial wine production. The major research objectives were firstly to establish a portfolio of quantitative calibration models suitable for quantification of the major quality determining parameters in fermenting must. The second major research objective focused on a pilot study aimed at exploring the use of off-line batch multivariate statistical process control (MSPC) charts for actively fermenting must. This approach used FT-IR spectra only, for the purpose of qualitative monitoring of alcoholic fermentation in industrial wine production. Towards these objectives, a total of 284 industrial-scale, individual, actively <b>fermenting</b> <b>tanks</b> of the seven major white cultivars and blends, and nine major red cultivars, of Namaqua Wines, Vredendal, South Africa, were sampled and analysed with FT-IR spectroscopy and appropriate reference methods during vintages 2007 to 2009. For the quantitative strategy, partial least squares regression (PLS 1) calibration models for determination of the classic wine parameters ethanol, pH, volatile acidity (VA), titratable acidity (TA) and the total content of glucose plus fructose, were redeveloped to provide a better fit to local South African samples. New PLS 1 models were developed for the must components glucose, fructose and yeast assimilable nitrogen (YAN), all of which are frequently implicated in problem fermentations. The regression statistics, that included the standard error of prediction (SEP), coefficient of determination (R 2) and bias, were used to evaluate the performance of the redeveloped calibration models on local South African samples. Ethanol (SEP = 0. 15 %v/v, R 2 = 0. 999, bias = 0. 04 %v/v) showed very good prediction and with a residual predictive deviation (RPD) of 30, rendered an excellent model for quantitative purposes in fermenting must. The models for pH (SEP = 0. 04, R 2 = 0. 923, bias = - 0. 01) and VA (SEP = 0. 07 g/L, R 2 = 0. 894, bias = - 0. 01 g/L) with RPD values of 4 and 3 respectively, showed that the models were suitable for screening purposes. The calibration model for TA (SEP = 0. 35 g/L, R 2 = 0. 797, bias = - 0. 004 g/L) with a RPD of 2, proved unsatisfactory for quantification purposes, but reasonable for screening purposes. The calibration model for the total content of glucose plus fructose (SEP = 0. 6. 19 g/L, R 2 = 0. 993, bias = 0. 02 g/L) with a RPD of 13, showed very good prediction and can be used to quantify total glucose plus fructose content in fermenting must. The newly developed calibration models for glucose (SEP = 4. 88 g/L, R 2 = 0. 985, bias = - 0. 31 g/L) and fructose (SEP = 4. 14 g/L, R 2 = 0. 989, bias = 0. 64 g/L) with RPD values of 8 and 10 respectively, also proved fit for quantification of these important parameters. The new calibration models of ethanol, total glucose plus fructose; and glucose and fructose individually, showed an excellent relation to local South African samples and can be easily implemented by the wider wine industry. Two calibration models were developed to determine YAN in fermenting must by using different reference methods, namely the enzyme-linked spectrophotometric assay and Formol titration method, respectively. The results showed that enzyme-linked assays provided a good quantitative model for white fermenting must (SEP = 14. 10 mg/L, R 2 = 0. 909, bias = - 2. 55 mg/L, RPD = 6), but the regression statistics for predicting YAN in red fermenting must, were less satisfactory (data not shown). The Formol titration method could be used successfully in both red- and white fermenting must (SEP = 16. 37 mg/L, R 2 = 0. 912, bias = - 1. 01 mg/L, RPD = 4). A minor, but very important finding was made with respect to the storage of must samples that were taken from tanks, but that could not immediately be analysed with FT-IR spectroscopy or reference values. Principal component analysis (PCA) of frozen samples showed that must samples could be stored frozen for up to 3 months and still be used to expand the calibration sample sets when needed. Therefore, samples can be kept frozen to a later stage if immediate analyses are not possible. For the purpose of the pilot study that focused on the use of FT-IR spectroscopy for qualitative off-line monitoring of alcoholic fermentation, a total of 21 industrial-scale fermentation tanks were monitored at 8 - or 12 -hourly intervals, from the onset of fermentation to complete consumption of the grape sugars. This part of the work excluded quantitative data, and only used FT-IR spectra. MSPC charts were constructed on the PLS scores of all the FT-IR spectra taken at the various time intervals of the different batches, using time as the y-variable. The primary aim of this research objective was to evaluate if the PLS batch models could be used to discriminate between normal and problem alcoholic fermentations. The models that were constructed clearly showed the variations in patterns over time, between red- and white wine alcoholic fermentations. One Colombar <b>tank</b> that was <b>fermented</b> at very low temperature in order to achieve a specific wine style, was characterised by a fermentation pattern that clearly differed form the rest of the Colombar fermentations. This atypical fermentation was identified by the batch models constructed in this study. PLS batch models over all the Colombar fermentations clearly identified the normal and problem fermentations. The results obtained in this study showed that FT-IR spectroscopy showed great potential for effective quantitative and qualitative monitoring of alcoholic fermentation during industrial wine production. The work done in this project resulted {{in the development of a}} portfolio of calibration models for the most important quality determining parameters in fermenting must. The quantitative models were subjected to extensive independent test set validation, and have subsequently been implemented for industrial use at Namaqua Wines. Multivariate batch monitoring models were established that show good discriminatory power to detect problem fermentations. This is a very useful diagnostic tool that can be further developed by monitoring more normal and problem fermentations. Future work in this regard, will focus on further optimisation and expansion of the quantitative and qualitative calibration models and implementation of these in the respective wineries of Namaqua Wines. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Fermentasie is ‘n komplekse proses waartydens rou material getransformeer word na produkte van hoë waarde, in hierdie geval, druiwesap na wyn. In die huidige ekonomies-kompeterende samelewing, is dit al hoe meer belangrik om volhoubaar wyn te produseer wat voldoen aan definieerbare spesifikasies en style. Goeie prosesbestuur tydens die wynproduksie stadium is baie belangrik om herhaalbaarheid en gehaltebeheer te verseker. Problematiese wynfermentasies het ’n direkte impak op beide kelderproduktiwiteit en wynkwaliteit. Die voorkoming van slepende- of steekfermentasies, of selfs net om probleme te voorsien, sou uiters bruikbaar wees vir ‘n wynkundige of wynmaker, wat dan die toepaslike regstellende stappe kan neem waar nodig, om te verseker dat die wynbereiding suksesvol voltooi word. Konvensionele metodes van monitering van alkoholiese fermentasie is tydrowend, soms onbetroubaar en die inligting beperk tot ‘n paar parameters. Die huidige effektiwiteit van fermentasie monitering in industriële wynproduksie kan heelwat verbeter word. Wynmakers ervaar tans ’n behoete aan tegnologië wat die vroeë tekens van ongunstige fermentasiepatrone kan identifiseer, en hul doeltreffendheid om moontlike regstellende aksies te neem, is dus beperk. Hierdie studie het die toepassing van Fourier transformasie mid-infrarooi (FT-IR) spektroskopie in transmissie, ondersoek met die oog op kwantitatiewe en kwalitatiewe monitering van alkoholiese gisting tydens industriële wynproduksie. Die vernaamste navorsingsdoelwitte was eerstens om ’n portefeulje van kwantitatiewe kalibrasiemodelle te vestig, wat geskik is om die belangrikste kwaliteitsbepalende parameters in gistende mos te kwantifiseer.
