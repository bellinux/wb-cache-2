60|$|Calls of men {{and cries}} of {{encouragement}} came sharply to them from close at hand, and they halted. There was an eager yelping, a scratching of feet, {{and a string of}} ice-rimed wolf-dogs, with hot-lolling tongues and dripping <b>jaws,</b> <b>pulled</b> up the slope and turned into the path ahead of them. On the sled, a long and narrow box of rough-sawed spruce told the nature of the freight. Two dog-drivers, a woman walking blindly, and a black-robed priest, made up the funeral cortege. A few paces farther on the dogs were again put against the steep, and with whine and shout and clatter the unheeding clay was hauled on and upward to its ice-hewn hillside chamber.|$|R
25|$|However, later {{research}} {{indicated that}} forward and sideways jaw movement was possible, the skull {{being able to}} withstand considerable forces. Euoplocephalus {{appears to have been}} able to make more complex movements. Tooth wear and jaw articulations (within the lower jaw and at the lower jaw-quadrate joint) suggest that the lower <b>jaws</b> were <b>pulled</b> back during feeding, and also slightly pivoted inward. This action would have sheared food.|$|R
5|$|The Texas {{pocket gopher}} avoids {{emerging}} {{onto the surface}} to feed by seizing the roots of plants with its <b>jaws</b> and <b>pulling</b> them downwards into its burrow. It also practices coprophagy. The African pouched rat forages on the surface, gathering anything that might be edible into its capacious cheek pouches until its face bulges out sideways. It then returns to its burrow to sort through the material it has gathered and eats the nutritious items.|$|R
50|$|All bits {{should be}} {{flexible}} {{so that the}} horse, as he would in a stiff bit, can not take hold of it in his <b>jaws</b> and <b>pull.</b> With a loose bit, the horse will keep a softer mouth as {{he has nothing to}} grab, and will drop the bit from his bars. Xenophon goes on to describe a flexible bit as one with broad and smooth junctions, which bend easily, and with several parts fitted around the axles that are not closely packed. A stiff bit would be one in which the parts do not easily slide, but push into each other.|$|R
40|$|Objective To {{describe}} a simple protocol for ventilator-assisted preoxygenation (VAPOX) prior to rapid sequence intubation in the ED using a Hamilton T 1 ventilator {{in an effort}} to further reduce the incidence of transient and critical hypoxaemia. Methods Ventilator-assisted preoxygenation includes the following steps; preparation for rapid sequence intubation as per institutional protocols, including departmental checklists. Hamilton T 1 ventilator is setup in non-invasive spontaneous/timed mode with settings as described. The patient is optimally positioned and nasal cannula applied with an oxygen flow rate of 15 [*]L/min. A face mask is applied with the <b>jaw</b> <b>pulled</b> forward using a two-handed thenar eminence grip and the ventilator is started. Preoxygenation occurs for 3 [*]min. Drugs including neuromuscular blockers are administered, while the operator ensures the airway remains patent. The ventilator transitions into Pressure Controlled Ventilation once apnoea ensues. Nasal oxygen continues until endotracheal tube is successfully secured. Results We {{describe a}} case series of the first eight consecutive adult patients on who VAPOX was applied. All eight patients were clinically deemed at high risk of oxygen desaturation. No clinically significant hypoxia occurred, and the lowest oxyhaemoglobin desaturation was 92 %. Conclusion Preoxygenation using a ventilator with an open valve system may allow safe combination of non-invasive ventilation, pressure controlled ventilation and apnoeic oxygenation using nasal cannula. VAPOX may be the technique of choice to preoxygenate and apnoeic oxygenate many patients who undergo rapid sequence intubation in the ED equipped with these ventilators...|$|R
50|$|At extreme temperatures, Cranwell's frogs enter {{a period}} of estivation, {{developing}} {{a thick layer of}} protective skin to trap moisture and aid in respiration. When estivation is complete, the frog uses its front and hind legs to help shed the protective layer. In many cases, the frog uses its <b>jaws</b> to help <b>pull</b> the skin over its back, often eating the skin in the process.|$|R
5000|$|Meanwhile, Ben's sister, Angie (Amy Smart) {{is killed}} by her {{reflection}} as it grips its <b>jaw</b> and slowly <b>pulls</b> its mouth apart, {{causing her to}} bleed profusely. Ben is distraught when he finds her body. In anger, he attempts to destroy the mirrors at the Mayflower, but they are impervious to damage. He demands {{to know what the}} mirrors want, and cracks appear on one of the mirrors, spelling out the word [...] "ESSEKER".|$|R
5000|$|In Angel's dream, Fred says, [...] "Let’s take a {{look under}} the hood.” She cuts open Angel’s chest and starts pulling out his {{internal}} organs, including his “dried-up little walnut” of a heart. Fred also pulls out a strand of beads (which she puts on), some raisins (which she eats), and a license plate (which causes her to ask, “Came up the gulf stream, huh?” a la <b>Jaws).</b> She <b>pulls</b> out a fishbowl, calling the dead goldfish inside it Angel’s soul, and says that they’ll have to flush it {{and hands it to}} the bear standing next to her. Fred turns back to Angel and tells him that she can’t find anything wrong with him [...] "...except that you’re empty. Just a shell. I think I can hear the ocean in there." ...|$|R
40|$|The {{object of}} the {{invention}} {{is to provide a}} mechanical force actuator which is lightweight and manipulatable and utilizes linear motion for push or pull forces while maintaining a constant overall length. The mechanical force producing mechanism comprises a linear actuator mechanism and a linear motion shaft mounted parallel to one another. The linear motion shaft is connected to a stationary or fixed housing and to a movable housing where the movable housing is mechanically actuated through actuator mechanism by either manual means or motor means. The housings are adapted to releasably receive a variety of <b>jaw</b> or <b>pulling</b> elements adapted for clamping or prying action. The stationary housing is adapted to be pivotally mounted to permit an angular position of the housing to allow the tool to adapt to skewed interfaces. The actuator mechanisms is operated by a gear train to obtain linear motion of the actuator mechanism...|$|R
5000|$|The hangman's knot or hangman's noose (also {{known as}} a collar during the Elizabethan era) is a {{well-known}} knot most often associated with its use in hanging a person. For a hanging, the knot of the rope is typically placed under or just behind the left ear, although the most effective position is {{just ahead of the}} ear, beneath the angle of the left lower <b>jaw.</b> The <b>pull</b> on the knot {{at the end of the}} drop levers the jaw and head violently up and to the right, which combines with the jerk of the rope becoming taut to wrench the upper neck vertebrae apart. This produces very rapid death, whereas the traditional position beneath the ear was intended to result in the mass of the knot crushing closed (occluding) the neck arteries, causing cessation of brain circulation. The knot is non-jamming but tends to resist attempts to loosen it.|$|R
30|$|Meanwhile, in hoopoe and {{the common}} moorhen, the movable naso-frontal hinge gives {{flexibility}} for depression of the upper <b>jaw</b> by <b>pulling</b> the palatine bone during the contraction of the pterygoid muscle. During depression of upper jaw in the common moorhen, the force transferred to curve the anterior portion of the palatine bone “maxillary process of the palatine bone”. This force enables bird to widen the choana. Morphologically, widening of choana may lead to increase air-flow that drain to the buccal cavity during closing of the mouth after catching prey or {{may be related to}} the uptake of large food items. In the hoopoe, the anatomical structure of the palatine bone maxillary process of the palatine bone is none allowable to change the diameter of choana. In fact, the hoopoe catches small insects and worms in no need to change the diameter of choana like that of kestrel which feeds on small items cutting before by their beak.|$|R
60|$|A {{little before}} the sale commenced, a short, broad, muscular man, in a checked shirt {{considerably}} {{open at the}} bosom, and pantaloons much the worse for dirt and wear, elbowed {{his way through the}} crowd, like one who is going actively into a business; and, coming up to the group, began to examine them systematically. From the moment that Tom saw him approaching, he felt an immediate and revolting horror at him, that increased as he came near. He was evidently, though short, of gigantic strength. His round, bullet head, large, light-gray eyes, with their shaggy, sandy eyebrows, and stiff, wiry, sun-burned hair, were rather unprepossessing items, it is to be confessed; his large, coarse mouth was distended with tobacco, the juice of which, from time to time, he ejected from him with great decision and explosive force; his hands were immensely large, hairy, sun-burned, freckled, and very dirty, and garnished with long nails, in a very foul condition. This man proceeded to a very free personal examination of the lot. He seized Tom by the <b>jaw,</b> and <b>pulled</b> open his mouth to inspect his teeth; made him strip up his sleeve, to show his muscle; turned him round, made him jump and spring, to show his paces.|$|R
5000|$|Tourney {{horses are}} meant {{to look like a}} person riding a small horse that is wearing a long cloth coat or caparison (as seen in medieval {{illustrations}} of jousting knights at a tourney or tournament). A circular or oval frame is suspended around their waist, or chest, with a skirt draped over it hanging down to the ground. The frame has a carved wooden head, often with snapping <b>jaws</b> (operated by <b>pulling</b> a string) attached to it at one end, and a tail at the other. The [...] "rider" [...] may wear a cape or other flowing costume to help cover the frame. In the most elaborate versions, fake legs, meant to be those of the rider, hang down the sides of the skirt, though this seems to be a fairly recent development.|$|R
60|$|Scenes and characters:--A young country fellow, {{twenty or}} thereabouts, decently dressed, pained with the toothache. A doctor, passing on horseback, with his black leather saddle-bags behind him, a thin, frosty-haired man. Being asked to operate, {{he looks at}} the tooth, lances the gum, and the fellow being content to be dealt with on the spot, he seats himself in a chair on the stoop with great heroism. The doctor {{produces}} a rusty pair of iron forceps; a man holds the patient's head; the doctor perceives that, it being a difficult tooth to get at, wedged between the two largest in his <b>jaws,</b> he must <b>pull</b> very hard; and the instrument is introduced. A turn of the doctor's hand; the patient begins to utter a cry, but the tooth comes out first, with four prongs. The patient gets up, half amazed, pays the doctor ninepence, pockets the tooth, and the spectators are in glee and admiration.|$|R
50|$|In February 2013, Goto made a {{challenge}} towards {{former high school}} classmate Katsuyori Shibata, {{which led to a}} tag team match on February 10, where he and Wataru Inoue were defeated by Shibata and Kazushi Sakuraba. Afterwards, Goto and Shibata had a heated confrontation, building to a future singles match between the two. In March, Goto once again made it to the finals of the New Japan Cup, before losing to Kazuchika Okada. Goto and Shibata finally faced off in a singles match on May 3 at Wrestling Dontaku 2013, which ended in a draw. A rematch between the two took place on June 22 at Dominion 6.22, where Shibata was victorious. A third match between the two on July 20 ended in another draw. During early August, Goto participated in the 2013 G1 Climax. On August 8, however, it was revealed that Goto had suffered a fractured <b>jaw</b> and was <b>pulled</b> from the tournament. He was leading the A block with four wins (which included a big win over IWGP Heavyweight Champion Kazuchika Okada) and two losses and had three matches left when he was pulled from the G1.|$|R
