5|$|In January 2009, Continental Airlines used a {{sustainable}} biofuel to power a commercial aircraft {{for the first}} time in North America. This <b>demonstration</b> <b>flight</b> marks the first sustainable biofuel <b>demonstration</b> <b>flight</b> by a commercial carrier using a twin-engined aircraft, a Boeing 737-800, powered by CFM International CFM56-7B engines. The biofuel blend included components derived from algae and jatropha plants. The algae oil was provided by Sapphire Energy, and the jatropha oil by Terasol Energy.|$|E
5|$|At the 8 August 1993 Fairchild air show, Holland {{once again}} {{commanded}} the B-52 <b>demonstration</b> <b>flight.</b> The demonstration profile once again included bank angles greater than 45°, low-altitude passes, and another high pitch climbing maneuver, {{this time in}} excess of 80° nose high. The climb was so steep that fuel flowed out of the vent holes from the aircraft's wing tanks. The new wing commander, Brigadier General James M. Richards, and the new DO, Colonel William E. Pellerin, both witnessed the demonstration, but neither took any action.|$|E
5|$|On 10 October 1984, GG1001 {{crashed in}} South Korea on a <b>demonstration</b> <b>flight,</b> killing Northrop pilot Darrell Cornell. An {{investigation}} cleared the F-20 of mechanical or design faults; it concluded Cornell had blacked out due to excessive g-forces. GI1001 crashed in May 1985 at Goose Bay, Labrador, killing Northrop pilot Dave Barnes. Again the crash was blamed on G-LOC; Barnes had been practicing his aerobatic routine for the Paris Air Show.|$|E
40|$|The Data Analysis Plan (DAP) {{describes}} {{the data analysis}} that the C 3 Work Package (WP) will perform {{in support of the}} Access 5 Step 1 C 3 <b>flight</b> <b>demonstration</b> objectives as well as the processes that will be used by the Flight IPT to gather and distribute the data collected to satisfy those objectives. In addition to C 3 requirements, this document will encompass some Human Systems Interface (HSI) requirements in performing the C 3 <b>flight</b> <b>demonstrations.</b> The C 3 DAP will be used as the primary interface requirements document between the C 3 Work Package and Flight Test organizations (Flight IPT and Non-Access 5 Flight Programs). In addition to providing data requirements for Access 5 flight test (piggyback technology <b>demonstration</b> <b>flights,</b> dedicated C 3 technology <b>demonstration</b> <b>flights,</b> and Airspace Operations <b>Demonstration</b> <b>flights),</b> the C 3 DAP will be used to request flight data from Non- Access 5 flight programs for C 3 related data product...|$|R

5|$|Many other {{applications}} were envisaged for the Gemini spacecraft {{at various stages}} before, during, and after the two years {{in which it was}} used by NASA for manned spaceflight. Although none of these proposals ever made it into operation, many were considered seriously, and in some cases flight hardware was constructed prior to cancellation. In the case of the Manned Orbital Laboratory, a Gemini spacecraft was launched on a suborbital <b>demonstration</b> <b>flight</b> in support of the program. In some cases technology developed in the Advanced Gemini program has been reintegrated into other programs, such as components from the Titan IIIM, which was to have launched MOL, being used to upgrade other Titan rockets.|$|E
5|$|The article {{explains}} {{the sequence of}} events of this August 4 New York City <b>demonstration</b> <b>flight</b> of 1895. When the reporter was all positioned and ready in the sky-cycle he gave word to the ground crew {{to let go of the}} ropes that held the hydrogen balloon back and it immediately lifted the sky-cycle into the air. The airship drifted up slowly at first, going towards the factory roof peaks. The driver-reporter immediately dropped one of the sandbag weights and the sky-cycle airship rose up sharply, avoiding the building roofs. When the airship was about a thousand feet high the attached balloon propeller revolved and the sky-cycle airship flew over the East River. The steamships and tugs that spotted the sky-cycle floating above tooted their whistles.|$|E

25|$|The Solar Challenger was a solar-powered {{electric}} aircraft {{designed by}} Paul MacCready's AeroVironment. The aircraft {{was designed as}} an improvement on the Gossamer Penguin, which in turn was a solar-powered variant of the human-powered Gossamer Albatross. It was powered entirely by the photovoltaic cells on its wing and stabilizer, without even reserve batteries, {{and was the first}} such craft capable of long-distance flight. In 1981, it successfully completed a 163-mile (262km) <b>demonstration</b> <b>flight</b> from France to England.|$|E
25|$|In 2011, SpaceX began {{development}} of the Falcon Heavy, a heavy-lift rocket configured using a cluster of three Falcon 9 first stage cores with a total 27 Merlin 1D engines and propellant crossfeed. The first stage {{would be capable of}} lifting 63,957 kilograms (141,100lb) to LEO with the 27 Merlin 1D engines producing 22,819kN of thrust at sea level, and 24,681kN in space. When SpaceX finishes development and the rocket is launched, the Falcon Heavy will be the world's most powerful rocket in operation. SpaceX is aiming for the first <b>demonstration</b> <b>flight</b> of the Falcon Heavy in November 2017.|$|E
25|$|HTV-1, {{also known}} as the HTV <b>Demonstration</b> <b>Flight</b> or HTV Technical Demonstration Vehicle, was the first Japanese Space Agency (JAXA) H-II Transfer Vehicle, {{launched}} in September 2009 to resupply the International Space Station and support the JAXA Kibo (きぼう, Kibō?, Hope) laboratory or JEM. It was an unmanned cargo spacecraft carrying a mixture of pressurised and unpressurised cargo to the space station. After a 52-day successful mission, HTV departed the ISS on 31 October 2009 after being released by the station's robotic arm. The spacecraft re-entered the Earth's atmosphere on 2 November and disintegrated on re-entry as planned.|$|E

25|$|The first {{aircraft}} {{to operate in}} Bergen was a <b>demonstration</b> <b>flight</b> by Carl Gustav Cederström on 25 September 1911. The first airport in the Bergen area was Flatøy Air Station, built by the Royal Norwegian Navy Air Service {{on the island of}} Flatøy. The water aerodrome was established in 1919, it remained in use until 1940. Norway's first scheduled airline service was started by Det Norske Luftfartsrederi between Bergen, Haugesund and Stavanger in 1920, and operated out of Bergen Airport, Sandviken, a water aerodrome just north of the city center. The aerodrome became the Bergen base for both Norwegian Air Lines and Vestlandske Luftfartsselskap.|$|E
25|$|On January 23, 1939, {{the sole}} {{prototype}} Douglas 7B twin-engine attack bomber, {{designed and built}} as a company project, suffered loss of vertical fin and rudder during <b>demonstration</b> <b>flight</b> over Mines Field, flat spun {{into the parking lot}} of North American Aviation, burned. Another source states that the test pilot, in an attempt to impress the Gallic passenger, attempted a snap roll at low altitude with one engine feathered, resulting in the fatal spin. Douglas test pilot Johnny Cable bailed out at 300 feet, chute unfurled but did not have time to deploy, killed on impact, flight engineer John Parks rode the airframe in and died, but 33-year-old French Air Force Capt. Paul Chemidlin, riding in aft fuselage near top turret, survived with broken leg, severe back injuries, slight concussion. Presence of Chemidlin, a representative of foreign purchasing mission, caused a furor in Congress by isolationists over neutrality and export laws. Type was developed as Douglas DB-7.|$|E
25|$|While {{holding the}} command of the Middle East, he had laid out an airway from Cairo to South Africa, {{clearing}} a chain of aerodromes in Central Africa. His idea was to send a <b>demonstration</b> <b>flight</b> or flights of RAF aircraft across Africa, thus providing the link of which Cecil Rhodes had dreamed in a Cape-to-Cairo railway. Salmond contemplated flights by both landplane and flying-boat. He was not destined to put his idea into execution, though his airway was used by Sir Pierre van Ryneveld and Sir Sir Christopher Brand on their first flight to South Africa. He was appointed a Grand Officer of the Egyptian Order of the Nile on 9 November 1918, a Companion of the Order of the Bath in the 1919 New Year Honours, and a Grand Commander of the Greek Order of the Redeemer on 5 April 1919. He was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George on 3 June 1919 and mentioned in despatches {{on account of his}} services in the Middle East on 28 June 1919.|$|E
