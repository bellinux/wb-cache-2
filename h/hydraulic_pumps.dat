A compressed air (later nitrogen) system was provided for emergency undercarriage lowering.|$|E
5|$|During his lifetime, Leonardo was valued as an engineer. In {{a letter}} to Ludovico il Moro, he claimed {{to be able to}} create all sorts of {{machines}} both for the protection of a city and for siege. When he fled to Venice in 1499, he found employment as an engineer and devised a system of moveable barricades to protect the city from attack. He also had a scheme for diverting the flow of the Arno river, a project on which Niccol√≤ Machiavelli also worked. Leonardo's journals include a vast number of inventions, both practical and impractical. They include musical instruments, a mechanical knight, <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pumps,</b> reversible crank mechanisms, finned mortar shells, and a steam cannon.|$|E

Devices such as pumps and waterwheels {{have been used to}} change liquid motion into mechanical work since ancient times. Oils are forced through <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pumps,</b> which transmit this force to hydraulic cylinders. Hydraulics can be found in many applications, such as automotive brakes and transmissions, heavy equipment, and airplane control systems. Various hydraulic presses are used extensively in repair and manufacturing, for lifting, pressing, clamping and forming.|$|E
25|$|To {{the east}} of the canal entrance, behind a viaduct arch is the {{octagonal}} tower of a hydraulic accumulator, 1869, replacing an earlier and pioneering structure dating from the 1850s by William George Armstrong, engineer and inventor. This regulated the hydraulic pressure of the extensive network of hydraulic mains around the basin supplying the coal-handling machinery. The associated steam raising plant and <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pumps</b> have been removed. The building was converted by Dransfield Owens de Silva for the London Docklands Development Corporation to function as a viewing platform. It (and the basin itself) is now owned by the British Waterways Board; and is a Grade II listed building, and is open every year during Open House Weekend, usually the third weekend in September.|$|E

Power assistance required for steering is inversely proportional to the vehicle speed so the constant load on the engine from a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pump</b> reduces fuel efficiency. More modern designs improve fuel efficiency by only activating the power assistance when needed; this is done by using either direct electrical power steering assistance or an electrically powered <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pump.</b>|$|R

25|$|Another major {{contribution}} of Henry IV was the construction between 1578 and 1608 of La Samaritaine, an enormous hydraulic water pump, {{powered by a}} water wheel under the Pont Neuf, which lifted water up from the Seine to a reservoir near Saint-Germain-l'Auxerois, {{for use in the}} Louvre Palace and the Tuileries Gardens. Two more pumps were added in 1673. Thanks to the pumps and the new aqueduct, by 1673 Paris, with an estimated population of 500,000 people, had 16 fountains on the Right bank fed by aqueducts, 14 fountains on the Left Bank fed by the new Aqueduct of Arcueil, and twenty one new fountains along the Right and Left banks of the river, fed by the new <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pumps.</b>|$|E

On {{the first floor}} is a standby generator and switchgear should the mains supply to the wheel fail. The second floor houses a pair of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pumps</b> that drive the hydraulic motors in the chamber above. Power is supplied directly to the axle with 10 hydraulic motors, which also double as brakes. Connected to each motor is a 100:1 gear system to reduce the rotation speed.|$|E
500|$|Details of the {{inclined}} planes {{have been}} the subject of some speculation, largely because contemporary documents from the time of their construction are unknown. A local writer called Ap Huw stated that [...] "the inclined planes were manipulated by <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pumps</b> which were considered to be great discoveries". He also noted that only two of the inclines were used, but whether this was because Hirwaunissa was unfinished or because there was no traffic on the upper section is not clear. The railway engineer W. Robinson described [...] "balance caissons with hydraulic brakes apparatus to check the barges in their descent and to arrange that the full ones coming down pull the empty ones up". The Colliery Guardian carried an eye-witness report of their operation, in which they were described as self-acting inclines, and it is stated that all three were in operation at the time.|$|E

An {{electric}} excavator consumes battery {{energy to}} drive {{an electric motor}} attached to a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pump</b> to generate <b>hydraulic</b> power. In a conventional hydraulic excavator, the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pump</b> is controlled by regulators, which are used to optimize the diesel engine efficiency. Because {{of a lack of}} battery energy capacity, an electric excavator controller should consider not only the electric motor efficiency but also the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pump</b> efficiency. Thus, electric motor and <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pump</b> efficiency maps were constructed. An optimal operating map (OOM) was created based on the most efficient operating points under each input condition. An integrated control algorithm controlled the speed of the electric motor and displacement of the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pump</b> according to the OOM. To confirm the utility of this algorithm, a model-in-the-loop simulator for the algorithm with an electric excavator was established.

In this article, a novel method based on high-frequency harmonic local characteristic-scale decomposition sub-signal separation and discrete cosine transform high-order singular entropy is proposed. In order to reduce noises and other disturbances, the vibration signal is processed by the local characteristic-scale decomposition modified by the high-frequency harmonic. Sub-signal with sensitive information is obtained by blind source separation of the selected intrinsic scale components. Furthermore, the discrete cosine transform high-order spectral analysis algorithm is proposed to extract singular entropies of Shannon and Tsallis to be the degradation features of the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pump.</b> Analysis of the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pump</b> experiment demonstrates that the proposed method is feasible and effective in indicating the performance degradation of the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pump...</b>|$|R

Gibbs built the tank from steel rather than aluminum or fiberglass because it would allow the realistically suspensionless vehicle to endure the rocky surfaces. Unlike its historical counterpart, which had only the two side guns, the tank had a turret gun added as well. It took four months to build and was transported to Almer√≠a on a Short Belfast plane and then a low loader truck.|$|E
500|$|The main {{changes were}} to {{increase}} the beam by [...] and widen Reed's armoured breastwork to cover the full width of the hull; this increased the ship's freeboard amidships which improved buoyancy and stability and provided additional, badly needed accommodation for the crew. In addition, the maximum thickness of the armour was increased from , it was extended {{all the way to}} the bow and reinforced the ram. Barnaby and White's initial plan was to extend the breastwork fore and aft, almost to the ends of the ship, but this was changed to run {{all the way to the}} ends after the results of 's sea trials in 1873‚Äì74 revealed that her low bow caused major problems in head seas. Other changes was the substitution of more economical inverted vertical compound-expansion steam engines for Reed's original horizontal, low-pressure engines, more powerful [...] guns for the [...] ones first chosen, and the fitting of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pumps</b> to work the gun turrets.|$|E

Three minutes later, nine Avengers attacked from both sides of the ship, scoring three torpedo hits on the port side. One hit abreast Turret No. 1, the second flooded a hydraulic machinery room forcing the main turrets to switch over to auxiliary <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pumps,</b> and the third flooded another engine room.
