40|$|Fourier {{transform}} infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy {{is examined}} as a rapid alternative to wet chemistry methods {{for the detection}} of adulteration of <b>freeze-dried</b> <b>instant</b> <b>coffees.</b> Spectra have been collected of pure coffees, and of samples adulterated with glucose, starch or chicory in the range 20 - 100 g kg(- 1). Two different FTIR sampling methods have been employed: diffuse reflectance, and attenuated total reflectance. Three different statistical treatments of the spectra were carried out. Firstly, the spectra were compressed by principal component analysis and a linear discriminant analysis performed. With this approach, a 98 % successful classification rate was achieved. Secondly, a simultaneous partial least square regression was carried out for the content of three added carbohydrates (xylose, glucose and fructose) in order to assess the potential of FTIR spectroscopy for determining the carbohydrate profile of <b>instant</b> <b>coffee.</b> Lastly, the discrimination of pure from adulterated coffee was performed using an artificial neural network (ANN). A perfect rate of assignment was obtained. The generalization ability of the ANN was tested on an independent validation data set; again, 100 % correct classifications were achieved...|$|R
40|$|Two {{species of}} coffee bean have {{acquired}} worldwide economic importance: these are, Coffea Arabica and Coffea Canephora variant Robusta. Arabica beans are valued most highly by the trade, {{as they are}} considered to have a finer flavor than Robusta. In this work, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy is explored as a rapid alternative to wet chemical methods for authentication and quantification of coffee products. Principal component analysis (PCA) is applied to spectra of <b>freeze-dried</b> <b>instant</b> <b>coffees,</b> acquired by DRIFT (diffuse reflection infrared Fourier transform) and ATR (attenuated total reflection) sampling techniques, and reveals clustering according to coffee species. Linear discriminant analysis of the principal component scores yields 100 % correct classifications for both training and test samples. The chemical origin of the discrimination is explored through interpretation of the PCA loadings. Partial least squares regression is applied to spectra of Arabica and Robusta blends to determine the relative content of each species. Internal cross-validation gives a correlation coefficient of 0. 99 and a standard error of prediction of 1. 20 % (w/w), illustrating {{the potential of the}} method for industrial off-line quality control analysis...|$|R
50|$|The {{presence}} of oil (a hydrophobic agent) can significantly accelerate the collapsing process localized {{reduction in the}} foam elasticity, resulting {{in the creation of}} a lighter foam with average bubble diameter larger than 4 mm. This is the reason it is not possible to make a good frappé in many countries, unless one can find spray-dried coffee (which is actually generally less expensive than <b>freeze-dried</b> <b>instant</b> <b>coffee).</b> The utilization of a hand mixer makes possible the creation of finer bubbles which increases the time that the foam can last. The best frappé coffees are often held to be those with the smallest bubbles and a thickness of about 1.5 inches to 2 inches (30 mm to 50 mm) of foam.|$|E

40|$|The oil {{obtained}} from Brazilian roasted coffee by supercritical CO 2 extraction shows considerable aromatic properties, mainly composed by five aromatic compounds, 2 -methylpyrazine; 2 -furfurylalcohol, 2, 5 -dimethylpyrazine; &# 947;-butyrolactone and 2 -furfurylacetate. Sensory analyses {{were used to}} verify {{the influence of a}} mixture of these important classes of aromatic coffee compounds (pyrazines, furans and lactones) and of the roasted coffee aromatic oil on the coffee aroma and flavour of black instant freeze and spray-dried coffee beverages. In the acceptance evaluation of the aroma, the samples prepared with <b>freeze-dried</b> <b>instant</b> <b>coffee</b> without the mixture of volatile compounds (sample 4) were not significantly different from the <b>freeze-dried</b> <b>instant</b> <b>coffee</b> in which the aromatic coffee oil was added (sample 5) and from the sample prepared with freeze-dried coffee in which the mixture of the five volatile was added (sample 3), coincidentally from the same drying process. Therefore, sample (3) did not differ from samples prepared with spray dried instant coffee without (sample 1) and to which (sample 2) the mixture of volatile was added. Therefore, with respect to this attribute, the addition of this mixture did not interfere in this drink acceptance. Taking into consideration the flavor, samples prepared with <b>freeze-dried</b> <b>instant</b> <b>coffee</b> in which the aromatic coffee oil was added (5) and the samples with (3) and without (4) the mixture of the five volatile was added did not differ significantly, however sample (4) did not differ from samples (1) and (2).

5000|$|When {{they arrived}} they were {{disappointed}} with the appalling quality of the local coffee. By the time Howell had left Berkeley, West Coast coffee pioneer Alfred Peet was already successfully established in the Bay Area and had already inspired Starbucks founders Jerry Baldwin, Zev Siegl and Gordon Bowker {{to start their own}} high-quality coffee store further north in Seattle. Howell and his wife had developed a taste for the strong, flavorful coffee available around San Francisco. But the East Coast was different. He has said that [...] "Boston was a desert of stale, brown-painted wooden pellets and liquified ground saw dust." [...] Though high-quality coffees had been popular in the United States at earlier points in its history, Americans' taste for strong, flavorful coffee declined during World War II. Severe rationing of coffee supplies at home and the wide consumption of the newly developed <b>instant,</b> <b>freeze-dried</b> <b>coffee</b> among soldiers caused American coffee palates to devolve. Though espresso or [...] "Italian coffee" [...] did emerge as a micro-niche product in Beatnik bars of the 1950s, weak-tasting, cheap canned coffee made in percolators and on diner hot plates was the rule of the day until Alfred Peet started his company and began to elevate tastes in the late 1960s.|$|R

O óleo do café torrado Brasileiro obtido através de extração com CO 2 supercrítico mostrou consideráveis propriedades aromáticas, constituído principalmente por cinco compostos aromáticos: 2 -metilpirazina; 2 -furfuril álcool, 2, 5 -dimetilpirazina; &# 947; -butirolactona e 2 -furfuril acetato. Análises sensoriais foram usadas para verificar a influência da mistura destas importantes classes de compostos aromáticos de café (pirazinas, furanos e lactonas) e do óleo aromático de café torrado no aroma e sabor de bebidas preparadas com café solúvel instantâneo liofilizado e seco por spray dryer. Na análise da aceitação do aroma, a amostra preparada com café liofilizado sem a mistura de compostos voláteis (amostra 4) não diferiu da amostra de café liofilizados com adição de óleo (amostra 5) nem tão pouco da amostra de café liofilizado com adição da mistura dos cinco voláteis (amostra 3), coincidentemente oriundas do mesmo processo de secagem. Entretanto a amostra 3 não diferiu das amostras preparadas com café seco por spray dryer sem (amostra 1) e com (amostra 2) a mistura de voláteis. Indicando que a adição desta mistura, com relação a este atributo não interfere na aceitação desta bebida. Na avaliação do sabor, as amostras preparadas com café solúvel liofilizado enriquecida com óleo aromático (5) e as amostras com (3) e sem (4) a mistura dos cinco voláteis não diferiram significativamente, entretanto a amostra (4) não diferiu das amostras (1) e (2). Para este atributo, a adição do óleo aromático de café torrado ou da mistura de voláteis nas amostras de café liofilizado fez com que tivessem uma melhor aceitação que aquelas secas por spray dryer (1) e (2). Desta forma, o enriquecimento das bebidas com o óleo aromático de café torrado, ou mesmo com a mistura dos cinco componentes não influenciou a aceitação do consumidor com relação ao aroma, mas exerce influência com relação ao sabor...|$|E

The <b>Instant</b> <b>Coffee</b> brand evokes feelings of conviviality; it’s self-aware but fun. This brand identity is the result of collective’s consistent production of art-related events in which the distinction between artwork and audience is blurred. This strong emphasis on the social aspect of art connects <b>Instant</b> <b>Coffee</b> to the broader artworld trend of relational aesthetics. Often an <b>Instant</b> <b>Coffee</b> event consists of works made in a single format that flies below the radar of medium specificity, such as the bumper sticker or stencil, to allow a broad range of artists, and the artistically-inclined, to participate. The Urban Disco Trailer, a retrofitted camping trailer, was an early platform used to present artworks in this mode. In more recent projects, the collective has focused on creating a participatory environment for its audience. The <b>Instant</b> <b>Coffee</b> Bass-Bed, contained a subwoofer connected to a sound system that made the bed vibrate. <b>Instant</b> <b>Coffee’s</b> Nooks created four moveable replicas of a kitchen nook, complete with window, inside of which audiences could sit and enjoy a series of art-related events.
