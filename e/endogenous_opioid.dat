25|$|Psychoactive {{drugs are}} often {{prescribed}} to manage pain. The subjective experience of pain is primarily regulated by <b>endogenous</b> <b>opioid</b> peptides. Thus, pain {{can often be}} managed using psychoactives that operate on this neurotransmitter system, also known as opioid receptor agonists. This class of drugs can be highly addictive, and includes opiate narcotics, like morphine and codeine. NSAIDs, such as aspirin and ibuprofen, are also analgesics. These agents also reduce eicosanoid-mediated inflammation by inhibiting the enzyme cyclooxygenase.|$|E
25|$|Other analgesics work {{peripherally}} (i.e., not on {{the brain}} or spinal cord). Research is starting to show that morphine and related drugs may indeed have peripheral effects as well, such as morphine gel working on burns. Recent investigations discovered opioid receptors on peripheral sensory neurons. A significant fraction (up to 60%) of opioid analgesia can be mediated by such peripheral opioid receptors, particularly in inflammatory conditions such as arthritis, traumatic or surgical pain. Inflammatory pain is also blunted by <b>endogenous</b> <b>opioid</b> peptides activating peripheral opioid receptors.|$|E
25|$|The CB1 {{receptor}} {{is found}} {{primarily in the}} brain and mediates the psychological effects of THC. The CB2 receptor is most abundantly found on cells of the immune system. Cannabinoids act as immunomodulators at CB2 receptors, meaning they increase some immune responses and decrease others. For example, nonpsychotropic cannabinoids {{can be used as a}} very effective anti-inflammatory. The affinity of cannabinoids to bind to either receptor is about the same, with only a slight increase observed with the plant-derived compound CBD binding to CB2 receptors more frequently. Cannabinoids likely have a role in the brain’s control of movement and memory, as well as natural pain modulation. It is clear that cannabinoids can affect pain transmission and, specifically, that cannabinoids interact with the brain's <b>endogenous</b> <b>opioid</b> system and may affect dopamine transmission.|$|E

While acute stress has been shown to enhance immune responses, chronic stress often leads to immunosuppression. Among many criteria examined upon exposure to chronic stress, the reduction in lymphocyte mitogenic response and lymphocyte cellularity are commonly assessed. We have reported that chronic restraint stress could induce lymphocyte reduction, an effect dependent on <b>endogenous</b> <b>opioids.</b> Interestingly, the effect of <b>endogenous</b> <b>opioids</b> was found to be exerted through increasing the expression of a cell death receptor, Fas, and an increased sensitivity of lymphocytes to apoptosis.

25|$|It is long acting, lipophilic, and metabolised hepatically by {{oxidative}} pathways. It acts on benzodiazepine receptors in {{the brain}} which are associated with the GABA receptors, causing an enhanced binding of GABA to GABAA receptors. GABA is a major inhibitory neurotransmitter {{in the brain}}, involved in inducing sleepiness, muscular relaxation, and control of anxiety and seizures, and slows down the central nervous system. The mechanism of action of nitrazepam is the same as other benzodiazepine drugs and zopiclone. The anticonvulsant properties of nitrazepam and other benzodiazepines may be in part or entirely due to binding to voltage-dependent sodium channels rather than benzodiazepine receptors. Sustained repetitive firing seems to be limited by benzodiazepines effect of slowing recovery of sodium channels from inactivation in mouse spinal cord cell cultures. The muscle relaxant properties of nitrazepam are produced via inhibition of polysynaptic pathways in the spinal cord of decerebrate cats. It is a full agonist of the benzodiazepine receptor. The <b>endogenous</b> <b>opioid</b> system {{may play a role in}} some of the pharmacological properties of nitrazepam in rats. Nitrazepam causes a decrease in the cerebral contents of the amino acids glycine and alanine in the mouse brain. The decrease may be due to activation of benzodiazepine receptors. At high doses decreases in histamine turnover occur as a result of nitrazepam's action at the benzodiazepine-GABA receptor complex in mouse brain. Nitrazepam has demonstrated cortisol-suppressing properties in humans.|$|E

50|$|<b>Endogenous</b> <b>opioids</b> are {{types of}} opioids {{produced}} by the body specifically to modulate pain. They include endorphins, enkephalins, dynorphins and endomorphins.

It has been found that <b>endogenous</b> <b>opioids</b> are at least partially responsible for phenomena like “Runner's high”, hypoalgesia in the fight-or-flight response, and even for the analgesic effects of acupuncture therapy.

40|$|Rationale <b>Endogenous</b> <b>opioids</b> {{could play}} a major role in the mesocorticolimbic {{dopamine}} (DA) responses to stress challenge. However, there is still no direct evidence of an influence of <b>endogenous</b> <b>opioids</b> on any of these responses. Objective We assessed whether and how <b>endogenous</b> <b>opioids</b> modulate fluctuations of mesocortical and mesoaccumbens DA tone in rats during a first experience with restraint stress. Method We first evaluated the effects of systemic naltrexone (NTRX) on DA outflow in the medial prefrontal cortex (mpFC) and in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) through dual-probe microdialysis. Second, we assessed the effect of perfusion, through reverse microdialysis, of direct DA receptor agonists in mpFC on NAc DA outflow in NTRX-pretreated stressed rats. Finally, we tested the effects of ventral tegmental area (VTA) perfusion of NTRX, the selective mu 1 antagonist naloxonazine and the selective delta antagonist naltrindole on mpFC and NAc DA outflow in stressed rats, with multiple probe experiments. Results Systemic NTRX, at behaviorally effective doses, selectively prevented the increase of mpFC DA levels and the reduction of NAc DA levels observable during prolonged restraint. Local co-perfusion of D 1 and D 2 agonists in mpFC recovered inhibition of NAc DA in NTRX-pretreated restrained rats. Finally, intra-VTA perfusion of either NTRX or the mu 1 antagonist, but not the delta antagonist, mimicked the effects of systemic NTRX. Conclusion During prolonged experience with a novel unavoidable/uncontrollable stressor, <b>endogenous</b> <b>opioids,</b> through stimulation of mu 1 receptors in the VTA, elevate mesocortical DA tone thus reducing DA tone in the NAc DA. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|R

2500|$|Amongst analgesics {{there are}} {{a small number of}} agents which act on the central nervous system but not on the opioid {{receptor}} system and therefore have none of the other (narcotic) qualities of opioids although they may produce euphoria by relieving pain—a euphoria that, because of the way it is produced, does not form the basis of habituation, physical dependence, or addiction.

40|$|The opioid receptors {{were among}} the first {{pharmacologically}} described brain receptors. These opioid receptors have thereafter been shown to mediate effects on proliferation and differentiation in both the embryonal and adult central nervous system. The aim of this thesis was to investigate if cultured hippocampal progenitors from the adult rat brain expressed opioids and opioid receptors and to investigate a possible regulation by opioids on proliferation, differentiation and gene expression in these cultures. Furthermore, we wanted to extend the results and investigate if <b>endogenous</b> <b>opioids</b> regulated hippocampal proliferation in vivo by using opioid receptor antagonists in both non-running and voluntary running rats, a situation associated with increased levels of <b>endogenous</b> <b>opioids.</b> Hippocampal progenitors were found to release b-endorphin that bound to mu- (MOR) and delta- (DOR) but not kappa- (KOR) opioid receptors in vitro. Incubation with MOR or DOR antagonists reduced proliferation whereas stimulation with b-endorphin increased proliferation in these cultures, respectively. The opioid-induced proliferation involved both intracellular calcium and phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase that stimulated phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Incubation with naloxone for ten days increased neurogenesis and reduced astrogliogenesis and oligodendrogenesis whereas stimulation with b-endorphin increased oligodendrogenesis but had no effect on astrogliogenesis. Using cDNA arrays, the levels of <b>endogenous</b> <b>opioids</b> were found to regulate gene expression for several cell cycle and oligodendrocyte-specific proteins. Stimulation with b-endorphin also increased Id 1, but not Id 3 mRNA levels. Down-regulation of Id 1 protein using antisense oligonucleotides was suggested to antagonize the opioid-induced oligodendrogenesis. Using bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), we observed a five-fold increase in hippocampal proliferation after nine days of wheel running in spontaneously hypertensive rats, a rat strain known to run voluntary. This increased BrdU labelling was reduced by peripheral administration of a preferential MOR, but not a DOR antagonist. In non-running rats, MOR and DOR antagonists increased hippocampal proliferation. In non-running, but not in running rats, the opioid receptor antagonists reduced adrenal gland weights and plasma levels of corticosterone. This stress hormone is known to reduce hippocampal neurogenesis. Running rats had three-fold higher levels of hippocampal Met-enkephalin-Arg-Phe levels compared to non-running rats, indicating increased opioid activity in hippocampus during running. These findings demonstrate that the levels of <b>endogenous</b> <b>opioids,</b> acting on MORs and DORs, regulate proliferation of adult rat hippocampal progenitors both in vitro and in vivo. <b>Endogenous</b> <b>opioids</b> were also shown to regulate differentiation and gene expression in cultures of hippocampal progenitors.
