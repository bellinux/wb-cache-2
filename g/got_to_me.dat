5|$|Pokiri success {{elevated}} Mahesh to super-stardom {{and brought}} recognition to Jagannadh {{as a writer}} and director. The sequences featuring Brahmanandam as a software engineer, the comedy track of Ali and Brahmanandam, Mahesh asking D'Cruz to give him upma at the railway station were acclaimed. The fashion trend of wearing doctor sleeves increased in Andhra Pradesh after Mahesh sported them and they continue to influence fashion even today. After the film's release, many films were released subsequently that had titles bordering on cuss words including Jagannadh's next film Desamuduru (2006). Mahesh revealed that he became confused after the film's success:It was such a huge hit, that if someone came to me with a script, I would approach the result of the film before approaching the character. I only wanted to act in movies that were like Pokiri, I think that was a mistake. It all <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> and I felt that I needed a break from films itself. Initially, I wanted just a seven-month break. I signed Khaleja after nine months, but it just kept getting delayed and the break ended up becoming a two-year-long holiday. But I didn't freak out... I relaxed {{for the first time in}} life.|$|E

[...] At the time, he said: [...] "The pressure finally <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> [...] Not the kind that comes from outside. [...] Not from my bosses or the fans. [...] I mean the pressure that builds up inside a head coach whether he wins or loses." [...] After Oosterbaan quit as football coach he was succeeded by Bump Elliott. [...] In 1959, Oosterbaan became Michigan's director of athletic alumni relations and held that position until he retired in 1972.|$|E

500|$|By late June, senior {{counter-terrorism}} official Richard Clarke and CIA director George Tenet were [...] "convinced {{that a major}} {{series of}} attacks was about to come", although the CIA believed that the attacks would likely occur in Saudi Arabia or Israel. In early July, Clarke put domestic agencies on [...] "full alert", telling them that [...] "Something really spectacular {{is going to happen}} here... soon." [...] He asked the FBI and the State Department to alert the embassies and police departments, and the Defense Department to go to [...] "Threat Condition Delta." [...] Clarke would later write that [...] "Somewhere in CIA there was information that two known al Qaeda terrorists had come into the United States... in [...] FBI there was information that strange things had been going on at flight schools in the United States... They had specific information about individual terrorists... None of that information <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> or the White House." ...|$|E
500|$|On November 30, 1961 he {{was traded}} to the San Francisco Giants along with Don Larsen in {{exchange}} for four players (three of them pitchers) who had spent most or all of 1961 in the minor leagues. Giants manager Alvin Dark declared his intent to use Pierce as the ace of a young pitching staff that included developing talents such as Juan Marichal, Gaylord Perry and Mike McCormick. Unlike the White Sox, the Giants featured a powerful offense which included Willie Mays, Willie McCovey and Orlando Cepeda, and Pierce took advantage of the improved run support with his new team, winning his first eight starts before suffering a 4–3 loss on June 7. His first start on April 13 was a deeply rewarding one, after a rough spring training in which he recorded a 16.45 ERA. Facing the Cincinnati Reds, he retired the first 13 batters and allowed only two hits in 7⅓ innings. The crowd of 23,755 gave him a roaring ovation, and he later said, [...] "The cheers really <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> inside. Fans nowhere could have been more wonderful. I felt it way down deep." ...|$|E

Abramowitz explained the creative decision of his staff by saying that [...] "...someone {{once told me that}} death was an aphrodisiac. It's a thing that pushes you to life and the greatest thing in life, that's 'seize life', is sex." [...] Lineberger wrote in his review of [...] "Eye For An Eye", [...] "This one caused an uproar— one I feel is justified. [...] gave a defense (in my opinion a weak one) (...) I have a high tolerance for insensitive guy stuff, but this <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> When Duncan rolled into Annie's arms, part of me smirked in appreciation of Duncan's magnetic charm. But the rest of me found his actions cruel to the viewers." [...] Abramowitz confirmed that [...] "...the fans hated it. And the women wanted to string me up. I was a 'cad' and a 'card'..."

2500|$|Arthur being 'sent down' {{ended up}} being a {{favourable}} outcome for Bill Treacher, as it allowed him time to recuperate.

Treacher said [...] "The breakdown story really <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> One night I came home, had a drink and just started weeping.

2500|$|In the San Francisco Chronicle, Walter Addiego stated, [...] "I {{fought hard}} against the emotionalism of In America [...] [...] [...] but I lost. There's no {{questioning}} the director's ability to wring moving moments from potentially sentimental and decidedly familiar material: the story of penniless immigrants {{trying to make it}} in Manhattan. It <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> I'm still trying to decide whether I was won over or worn down— but why not give Sheridan the benefit of the doubt? [...] [...] [...] [...] is clearly drawing on deep personal reserves for this picture, and despite a few sequences when the creative hand seems intrusive, does well by his subject. When you see a director going for that lump-in-the-throat mood, instinct takes over and you want to dig in your heels. Sometimes it's best just to let yourself be swept away." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1987 Powell joined {{other music}} greats for a jazz festival on the cruise ship SS Norway, playing {{alongside}} Benny Carter, Howard Alden, Milt Hinton, and Louie Bellson and others. One performance {{has been documented}} on the CD The Return of Mel Powell (Chiaroscuro Records). The recording includes 20 minutes of Powell discussing {{his life and his}} reasons for leaving jazz. In an interview with The New Yorker magazine jazz critic Whitney Balliett, Powell said: [...] "I have decided that when I retire I will think through my decision to leave jazz – with the help of Freud and Jung. At the moment, I suspect it was this: I had done what I felt I had to do in jazz. I had decided it did not hold the deepest interest for me musically. And I had decided that it was a young man's music, even a black music. Also, the endless repetition of material in the Goodman band – playing the same tunes day after day and night after night – <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> That repetition tended to kill spontaneity, which is the heart of jazz and which can give a lifetime's nourishment." ...|$|E
