50|$|Over {{the whole}} period of its existence, the Committee had made only four public {{statements}} (Ukraine being the fourth country {{with respect to}} which the statement was made). It is, however, the first country to be publicly reprimanded for its failure to collaborate {{for the improvement of}} situation in the penitentiary institutions. Our country is really an <b>exception</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>sense,</b> as usually the Committee is very cautious addressing the issues of torture in the penitentiary institutions. More often such reprimands are made with reference to militia and its departments. The Report, however, describes and highlights the tortures in the correctional facilities. CPT pointed out that the treatment of inmates held in Oleksiivka CF #25 and Stryzhava CF #81 is tantamount to the torture. The finding of a row and bats, wrapped in paper and plastic and used to beat the inmates in Stryzhava CF #81, was an unprecedented occasion for the Committee delegation.|$|E
30|$|The ACTN 3 R 577 X (rs 1815739) {{polymorphism}} is an <b>exception</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>sense,</b> {{since it}} is a well-studied functional polymorphism. The human ACTN 3 gene encodes α-actinin- 3, an actin-binding protein with a structural role at the sarcomeric Z-line in glycolytic (type II, fast-twitch) muscle fibers, and plays an increasingly evident role in the regulation of muscle metabolism [2]. A common genetic single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at codon 577 of the ACTN 3 results in the replacement of an arginine (R) with a stop codon (X) [3]. The R allele is a normal functional version of the gene, whereas the X allele contains a sequence change that completely stops production of functional α-actinin- 3 protein [3]. Therefore, XX homozygotes do not express ACTN 3 at all in their muscles [2]. In the knockout mouse, {{it is clear that}} ACTN 3 deficiency alters skeletal muscle function [2].|$|E
40|$|This paper gives a {{comparative}} overview of inter-generational mobility in 7 countries of Central and Eastern Europe, including Serbia, {{at an early}} stage of postsocialist transformation. The analysis was based upon surveys organized in these countries in 1993. Basic findings show that a great social and economic transformation does not lead to a great structural mobility. The processes of formation and reproduction of the strata of political and economic managers and small entrepreneurs to some extent make an <b>exception</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>sense.</b> These processes are marked by higher openness as compared to other strata. In such {{a comparative}} framework Serbia appears to be structurally the most closed one, more closed even than other countries that could be classified as countries with a blocked transformation (Bulgaria and Russia). Very high self-reproduction of managerial and middle strata make an essence of the low mobility of the Serbian society...|$|E

40|$|Although {{there is}} an ongoing {{controversy}} in philosophy of science about so called ceteris paribus laws that is, roughly, about laws with exceptionsóa fundamental question about those laws has been neglected (ß 2). This {{is due to the}} fact that this question becomes apparent only if two different readings of ceteris paribus clauses in laws have been separated. The first reading of ceteris paribus clauses, which I will call the epistemic reading, covers applications of laws: predictions, for example, might go wrong because we do not know all the relevant factors which are causally effective in relevant situation. The second reading, which I will call the metaphysical reading, is concerned with the laws themselves and their possible exceptions (ß 3). It is this latter readingóand the funda- mental question associated with itówhich has been neglected due to the confusion of the two readings (ß 4) : if we leave epistemic issues aside is there at all conceptual space left for a notion of laws of nature which allows the laws themselves to have exceptions? I call a law with <b>exceptions</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>sense,</b> if such there is, a real ceteris paribus law. To tackle this question, I distinguish grounded laws from non-grounded laws (ß 5). A grounded law is, roughly, a law about structured entities where the properties of the parts of that structure figure themselves in laws of nature (ß 6). I will claim that, since the substructure of such an entity can be damaged, grounded laws themselves can face exceptions. Hence, they are candidates to be real (metaphysical) ceteris paribus laws in the sense of my central question. I will discuss grounded laws and their <b>exceptions</b> <b>in</b> detail (ß 7, ß 8, ß 9). For reasons of space, the further question whether we can even have a notion of fun- damental (non-grounded) laws that allows for exceptions cannot be discussed here. I will, however, give a positive answer and also outline how I have argued for that claim elsewhere (ß 10) ...|$|R
40|$|These {{are only}} a few of the many {{problems}} experienced in the world today. Day after day, the system generates deeper social, political and economic destructions. Until now, I have described only one side of a coin. On the other side, since Hegel, it is explicitly known that each fact or situation reveals its own contradiction. Social processes are not <b>exceptions.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>sense,</b> destruction can only exist with opportunities for recreation. Almost in all regions, local or extensive protests emerge against several problems. Some are taking the form of political reaction, others are as movement organizations or spontaneous street movements. The literature on social movements or relevant issues is dominated by the discussions on why and how these movements emerge and survive or fade. In such a world filled with inequality, a world becoming more destructive for crowds on behalf of a few group of people's interest, there is another relevant aspect of the same discussion: Why the crowds are not able to change this situation? Although there are many organized movements today, why are these organizations poor <b>in</b> stopping <b>this</b> destructive process? Accordingly, not only the existence of movements but also the absence of them is significant. Moreover, a broader analysis of social movements requires to examine them as complementary. Although the structural conditions are significant to compare these two, I prefer to focus also on relational aspect. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>sense,</b> I use micro-structural approach. Communication processes are bridging perspective for micro and macro levels and network theory is at the center of the discussions <b>in</b> <b>this</b> thesis. Correspondingly, social movements are considered as products of communication processes. The network mechanism has been criticized being local in construction. On the contrary, previous studies show the capacity of <b>this</b> mechanism <b>in</b> explaining many global phenomena. Several examples are discussed in the first chapter. Also, the basic definitions and representations used in the rest of the study are introduced <b>in</b> <b>this</b> chapter. The second chapter turns to social movements. The traditional theories of the social movements are reviewed from a critical perspective. The current developments on the subject are discussed. In fact, the necessity of a new perspective has been discussed in the plenty of current studies. The search of a new perspective is also the main motivation of <b>this</b> thesis. <b>In</b> the light of this, the second chapter discusses why network theory is promising as a new methodology for social movements. The existence of conflicting identities rests at the heart of the analysis. At the end of the chapter, a general perspective is introduced. I construct two different models in the following two chapters so as to study different aspects. The first one examines the possible network structures in case of the interaction of conflicting identities. In the third chapter, a standard communication network is modified by including heterogeneity in benefits received from direct connections. Moreover, benefits of indirect connections also modified. The extension includes the differentiation on benefit one gets from an indirect connection depending on the type of connector. It is found that, like standard connection model, the network externalities generate discrepancy between stability and efficiency. The fourth chapter is an application of the mechanism described in the second chapter. I discuss the structures under which agents are willing to use interaction as a resource for action against opposition. Information dominance and size dominance are introduced as two main tools for the decision-making process. Whenever various and complex identity structures exist, multilayer analysis is necessary. The network structures generating mobilization acts are examined under the definition of mobilization as a value transfer between opposites. The thesis is concluded with a brief summary of main findings and a discussion on further analysis. This thesis is an attempt to contribute to growing literature using a network approach to analyze social movements. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>sense,</b> I present a general mechanism on how to use the network approach to analyze social conflicts and movements. Furthermore, as far as we know, it is one of the few studies working network theory with a dialectic methodology...|$|R
40|$|John Fowles’s love {{of nature}} is {{illustrated}} by the great variety of landscapes and flowers present everywhere throughout his fiction. His interest goes well beyond that of a mere admirer of flowers as it is proved by his knowledge of their names and species and by his great ability to describe and use them as symbols, as carriers of meaning. In all his six novels, Fowles makes extensive references to flowers and their symbolism and The French Lieutenant’s Woman is no <b>exception</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>sense.</b> The present article aims to prove that the language of flowers as a form of symbolic communication was very much used in the Victorian era, which Fowles reconstructs minutely. At the same time, the close analysis of the text will reveal that the novelist uses flowers as a symbolic code of communication with his readers so as to disclose the hidden nature of his characters. The focus is placed on decoding the language of flowers, as there is no systematic approach to it in the critical writings on Fowles’s fiction...|$|E

40|$|The {{majority}} of the anti-inflammatory drugs routinely used nowadays are COX (cyclo-oxygenase) inhibitors.  The important role of this enzyme, once known as prostaglandin synthase, in inflammation came {{a consequence of the}} discovery by the Nobel prize winner John Vane with his path-breaking discovery that aspirin and similar drugs exert their action by blocking the biosynthesis of the prostaglandin group of lipid mediators.  John R. Vane, Nobel Lecture, Dec. 8, 1982 and refs. cited therein, {{in the last five years}} it has become clear that there are two such enzymes involved.  One of the "cyclo-oxygenases", called COX 1 is responsible for making prostaglandins, which among other things, protect the stomach and kidney from damage.  It is now clear that inhibition of COX 1 accounts for the unwanted side effects of aspirin-like drugs such as gastric irritation and renal damage.  The other enzyme, COX 2, is induced by inflammatory stimuli and it is prostaglandins made by this enzyme that contribute to the inflammation in diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis.  However, concerning inflammation-related targets, one should not limit the interest to COX and PLA 2 enzymes.  In recent years, it has steadily become more clear, that modulation in the expression of genes underlies most cellular responses, and inflammation is certainly not an <b>exception</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>sense.</b>  It does not come as surprise that mols. showing ability to interfere with factors involved in the modulation of genes expression, such as NF-κB, have also to be considered potential anti-inflammatory agents.  Also in this respect, marine natural products (MNP) have brought a collection of novel mol. entities displaying ability to target COX 1 /COX 2, NF-κB or acting through mol. mechanisms yet-to-be-discovered.  Following, the marine natural products accounted for within this review will be grouped on the basis of their bio-mol. targets.  Chem. synthesis of particular relevant mols. will be also discussed, esp. in those cases where the natural products can be considered as lead compds. for the development of simplified derivs. or analogs of potential pharmaceutical interest...|$|E
