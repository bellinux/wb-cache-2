One day, Sean meets [...] "Duke" [...] Wayne (George Wendt), who introduces Sean to his boss, a shady developer named Ray Matthews (Daniel Baldwin). Ray hires Sean as a spy, and orders him to follow Eric Gatley (Ron Livingston), an accountant who has been investigating Ray's company. Problems start when Ray, while drunk, offers Sean $13,000 to kill Eric. Sean accepts his offer and, although ambivalent, ends up killing Gatley by breaking into his house and beating him to death. When Sean goes to collect his pay, however, he is double-crossed and when he insists that they pay him, he is kidnapped and taken to Ray's secluded farm. It emerges that Matthews never had any intention of paying Sean for the killing, for he only wanted to use and eliminate him. But Sean survives from having a bullet put in his head then reveals that he had taken Gatley's work file of evidence and hidden it along with his <b>documentation</b> <b>of</b> <b>events</b> leading to the murder.|$|E
5000|$|On 27 November 2011, veteran investigative {{journalist}} Edward Jay Epstein presented a minute-by-minute <b>documentation</b> <b>of</b> <b>events,</b> published in The New York Review of Books, which involved the alleged assault, making {{a number of}} new allegations. An analysis of hotel door key and phone records tracing links to Strauss-Kahn's potential political rivals appeared to suggest the possibility that he had been set up. However the hotel where the alleged assault took place firmly rebuffed Epstein's suggestions of a conspiracy theory, denying a number of assertions in the report. The New York Review of Books subsequently corrected one of its allegations, reporting that a [...] "dance of celebration" [...] between two Sofitel employees lasted 13 seconds, not the 3 minutes originally reported, an issue that had been raised by Amy Davidson in her The New Yorker examination of Epstein's piece. Epstein later wrote that Strauss-Kahn now accepts that his enemies did not set up his encounter with Diallo, but believes they did play a role, through intercepted phone calls, in making sure that the hotel maid went to the police, turning a private tryst into a public scandal.|$|E

5000|$|Magda Bielesz art {{is about}} {{subjects}} such as promise of happiness, life vitality, but also the problems of impaired body, old age - subjects not present in society communication, thus excluded. In terms of the artist, they regain {{their place in the}} natural cycle of life. In the Magdy Bielesz works, there is the hope and joy of life, often revealed in the children's fairy tale stylization. In her works she is dating back to the memories and dreams, relationships, health-illness relation. She would like to find and fix all the deficiencies and damages.Delving into the world of childhood improves memory, which often differ from the actual situation. Referring to childhood, she creates a kind of un growing mythology. The most recognizable series are: Maszyny, Lekcja pływania i Dzieci. As Bielesz sayes: In every area of my life I try to take from reality just as much as I need at the moment. I paint what I always missed, through my paintings fulfilling my dreams. Her paintings are very clean - one item or a single person on a white background. Joining to one another, creating an endless spatial arrangement. Often it goes beyond the image - a series of children on jumping ropes seems to jump out of the images.In the Room project, she made the first intervention in the architectural space of her studio (Night of Museums, 2009), and then in the extended version in spaces of Laznia Centre for Contemporary Art in Gdansk (2010). Thanks to the black line, new architectural elements are appearing, which she considered as missing, thus invites the viewer's imagination to run, crossing the physical barriers and symbolic passing through the wall. Bielesz also creates video works that are very similar to painting. Videos can be divided into two groups: one is a <b>documentation</b> <b>of</b> <b>events,</b> images that she records (Dobro, 100 obrazków, Chwilami nierealności), the other is as she says are paintings that are moving (Lekcja pływania, Złość piękności szkodzi, Gimnastyka).From Magda images raises fascination on the states that she is not able experience. On her paintings she often marks objects and characters by depriving them of light and shade and putting them on a neutral white background. This creates the illusion of their own lives, outside of context meanings, which they originated. This latter also applies to objects - talismans, which {{play an important role in}} her work. Bielesz creates them in short bursts: Poduszki do pływania we śnie, Universal memory (sachets of plant seeds), Universal dreams [...] (sachets of seeds of plants), Universal Wish (sachet of pills: Meet ET, Sing as Johnny Cash, be lucky, change sperm taste - carrot, be born again, clone yourself etc.), KLOCKI, czyli zestaw do kreatywnego spędzania czasu and Crystal.|$|E

40|$|The {{developmental}} {{trajectory of}} multiple method research is a somewhat curious one. Combining methods {{is at least}} as old as Thucydides’ account of the Peloponnesian wars, in which the speeches constituting a quarter of the History offer insight into the Greek political mind, the motives of contemporaries, and the arguments they used, so that, blended with the descriptive chronicle, the work balances detailed <b>documentation</b> <b>of</b> <b>events</b> with insights into what they meant to those involved. However, the modern origin of methodological combination is commonly dated to Campbell's ‘multi-trait, multi-method matrix’ in psychology (Campbell and Fiske, 1959), which rendered the concept in highly formal terms. Methodological combination was to be systematic and carefully orchestrated. Approaches following Campbell's inspiration were based on ‘triangulation’, an objective aiming to test and prove relationships. The goal was causal explanation with predictive adequacy and the mechanism was ‘convergent validation’...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Computer {{technology}} {{enables the}} creation of detailed documentation about the processes that create or affect entities (data, objects, etc.). Such documentation of the past {{can be used to}} answer various kinds of questions regarding the processes that led to the creation or modification of a particular entity. The answer to such questions are known as an entity’s provenance. In this paper, we derive a number of principles for documenting the past, grounded in work from philosophy and history, which allow for provenance questions to be answered within a computational context. These principles lead us to argue that an interaction-based model is particularly suited for representing high quality documentation of the past. History is important: in order to make progress in the future, it is important to learn the lessons of the past. History, therefore, becomes a vital resource for progressive societies. History is based on evidence or <b>documentation</b> <b>of</b> <b>events</b> that occurred in the past. Computer technology enables documentation to b...|$|E
40|$|The {{history of}} {{psychoanalysis}} in Brazil during the civilian-military dictatorship (1964 - 1985) {{has come under}} increasing scrutiny {{in recent years as}} an instance of institutional complicity with authoritarian rule. The case of Amilcar Lobo in Rio de Janeiro is now well known. However, there is less <b>documentation</b> <b>of</b> <b>events</b> in São Paulo, leading to a misrepresentation of the Brazilian Psychoanalytical Society of São Paulo as having passed relatively unscathed through the dictatorial period. This paper confronts this misrepresentation by documenting the case of a psychoanalyst from São Paulo who was involved with the torture regime. A detailed account is presented of claims made to the authors about the actions of this psychoanalyst in relation to a political prisoner of the period, and some parallels are made with material in two published works by him. It is suggested that this particular psychoanalyst’s behaviour reflects attitudes prevalent in the Brazilian Psychoanalytical Society of São Paulo at the time, including its support for the view that political resistance was a sign of psychological ‘immaturity’ or pathology...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Much {{of modern}} {{software}} development consists of building on older changes. Older periods provide the structure (e. g., functions and data types) on which changes in future periods will build. Given a particular {{period in the}} lifetime of a project, one can determine prior periods on which it builds, and future periods which build on it. Using this knowledge, managers can identify foundational periods in the lifetime of a project, which provide the structural foundation for {{a large number of}} future periods. A good understanding and detailed <b>documentation</b> <b>of</b> <b>events</b> and decisions in such foundational periods is essential for the smooth evolution of a project. This paper examines how changes build on older changes by measuring the time dependence between code changes. Using our approach, we can create time dependence relations between periods and study the characteristics of such dependence relations. We apply our approach on two large open source projects, PostgreSQL and FreeBSD. We find that foundational periods are periods with huge restructurings, important new features or large imports of external source code. We also find that a project, as it ages, either progressively depends on older periods or cycles between depending on old and new periods...|$|E
