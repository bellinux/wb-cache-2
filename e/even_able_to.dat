5|$|Being cold-blooded, frogs have {{to adopt}} {{suitable}} behaviour patterns to regulate their temperature. To warm up, {{they can move}} into the sun or onto a warm surface; if they overheat, they can move into the shade or adopt a stance that exposes the minimum area of skin to the air. This posture {{is also used to}} prevent water loss and involves the frog squatting close to the substrate with its hands and feet tucked under its chin and body. The colour of a frog's skin is used for thermoregulation. In cool damp conditions, the colour will be darker than on a hot dry day. The grey foam-nest tree frog (Chiromantis xerampelina) is <b>even</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> turn white to minimize the chance of overheating.|$|E
5|$|Elephants exhibit mirror self-recognition, an {{indication}} of self-awareness and cognition that has also been demonstrated in some apes and dolphins. One study of a captive female Asian elephant suggested the animal was capable of learning and distinguishing between several visual and some acoustic discrimination pairs. This individual was <b>even</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> score a high accuracy rating when re-tested with the same visual pairs a year later. Elephants are among the species known to use tools. An Asian elephant has been observed modifying branches and using them as flyswatters. Tool modification by these animals is not as advanced as that of chimpanzees. Elephants are popularly thought of as having an excellent memory. This could have a factual basis; they possibly have cognitive maps {{to allow them to}} remember large-scale spaces over long periods of time. Individuals appear {{to be able to keep}} track of the current location of their family members.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of more advanced electronic systems in the 1980s allowed manufacturers to produce snow groomers which could work on and replicate a much wider range of terrains, with the most modern <b>even</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> produce half-pipes and ramps for snowboarding. Snow groomers are also {{used in conjunction with}} snow cannons, to ensure that the snow produced is spread evenly across the resort. However, snow groomers have a detrimental effect on the environment within the resort. Regular pressure from the grooming vehicle increases the infiltration rate of the soil while decreasing the field capacity. This increases the rate at which water can soak through the soil, making it more prone to erosion.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{their return}} on Oct 24, 1871, Hall {{suddenly}} fell ill after drinking {{a cup of}} coffee. His symptoms started with an upset stomach, then progressed to vomiting and delirium the following day. Hall accused several of the ship's company, including Bessels, of having poisoned him. Following these accusations, he refused medical treatment from Bessels, and drank only liquids delivered directly by his Inuit friend Tookoolito. He seemed to improve for a few days, and was <b>even</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> go up on deck. Bessels had prevailed upon Bryan, the ship's chaplain, to convince Hall to allow the doctor to see him. By November 4, Hall relented, and Bessels resumed treatment. Shortly after, Hall's condition began to deteriorate, and he suffered vomiting and delirium, and collapsed. Bessels diagnosed apoplexy, and Hall finally died on November 8. He was taken ashore and given a formal burial.|$|E
5|$|At the time, {{the death}} of the monarch {{required}} fresh elections and, in the general election of 1830, Wellington's Tories lost ground to the Whigs under Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey, though the Tories still had the largest number of seats. With the Tories bitterly divided, Wellington was defeated in the House of Commons in November, and Lord Grey formed a government. Grey pledged to reform the electoral system, which had seen few changes since the fifteenth century. The inequities in the system were great; for example, large towns such as Manchester and Birmingham elected no members (though they were part of county constituencies), while small boroughs, known as rotten or pocket boroughs—such as Old Sarum with just seven voters—elected two members of Parliament each. Often, the rotten boroughs were controlled by great aristocrats, whose nominees were invariably elected by the constituents—who were, most often, their tenants—especially since the secret ballot was not yet used in Parliamentary elections. Landowners who controlled seats were <b>even</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> sell them to prospective candidates.|$|E

25|$|The {{last years}} {{of the reign of}} the ailing king saw the disorder, lawlessness, {{factional}} infighting and anarchy overcoming the Commonwealth. The monarch was not <b>even</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> control the feud between his wife Marie Casimire and their son Jakub. John III's death in 1696 commenced the longest, most contentious and corrupted interregnum in the country's history.|$|E
25|$|After {{the rise}} of Christianity, {{many of the most}} {{important}} philosophers were Christians. The second-century Christian apologist Justin Martyr, who wrote exclusively in Greek, made extensive use of ideas from Greek philosophy, especially Platonism. Origen of Alexandria, the founder of Christian theology, also made extensive use of ideas from Greek philosophy and was <b>even</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> hold his own against the pagan philosopher Celsus in his apologetic treatise Contra Celsum.|$|E
25|$|Bavaria's {{entry into}} the German Empire changed from jubilation over France's defeat to dismay shortly {{afterward}} because of the direction Germany took under the new German Chancellor and Prussian Prime Minister, Otto von Bismarck. The Bavarian delegation under Count Otto von Bray-Steinburg had secured a privileged status for the Kingdom of Bavaria within the German Empire (Reservatrechte). The Kingdom of Bavaria was <b>even</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> retain its own diplomatic body and its own army, which would fall under Prussian command only in times of war.|$|E

If the MiG-21 was a significant threat to the Phantoms, it was an even bigger threat to its main target, the comparatively sluggish F-105 Thunderchief fighter-bombers that carried out {{the bulk of the}} attack and bombing missions in the North Vietnamese interior during Operation Rolling Thunder.|$|E

25|$|The {{measures}} of the emergency regime was able to halt the economic trouble of the early to mid-1970s, which had been marred by harvest failures, fiscal contraction, and {{the breakdown of the}} Bretton Woods system of fixed exchanged rate; the resulting turbulence in the foreign exchange markets being further accentuated by the oil shock of 1973. The government was <b>even</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> exceed the targeted growth figure with an annual growth rate of 5.0–5.2% over the five-year period of the plan (1974–79). The economy grew at the rate of 9% in 1975–76 alone, and the Fifth Plan, became the first plan during which the per capita income of the economy grew by over 5%.|$|E
25|$|Harrison {{intended}} to use the company as scouts and foragers. He {{put them in a}} wide formation around {{the main body of the}} army where they kept watch for enemies and gathered wild game to bring back to the main army. The company was successful and was <b>even</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> find beehives and bring back ten gallons of honey. On October 3 the army reached the site of modern Terre Haute, a strategic location on the Wabash River. The company continued to scout the countryside and forage while the rest of the army constructed Fort Harrison. A small detachment of mounted men under the command of Lieutenant Thomas Berry was added the Yellow Jackets.|$|E
25|$|Total depravity is {{the fallen}} state of {{man as a}} result of {{original}} sin. The doctrine of total depravity asserts that people are by nature not inclined or <b>even</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> love God wholly with heart, mind, and strength, but rather all are inclined by nature to serve their own will and desires and to reject the rule of God. Even religion and philanthropy are wicked to God to the extent that these originate from a human imagination, passion, and will and are not done to the glory of God. Therefore, in Reformed theology, if God is to save anyone He must predestine, call, elect individuals to salvation since fallen man does not want to, indeed is incapable of choosing God.|$|E

25|$|There was {{a similar}} {{disagreement}} between the PDU and Bukovina's Germans. The Romanian party claimed {{that it had}} supported {{the creation of a}} German constituency, but that the Germans, being spread out between villages, were ungroupable. The National German Council, resentful of early Romanianization attempts, refused to sign for an alliance with Nistor. In this case as well, the PDU was able to enlist a dissident German, Norbert Kipper (Chiper), among its own candidates for the Assembly. The party was <b>even</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> affiliate two Ukrainians, Vasily Snyatynchuk of Orășeni (Coțmani) and the Mayor of Ocna. Stanisław (Stanislaus) Kwiatkowski, the first Bukovina Pole to serve in Parliament, was also close to Nistor and, after taking his seat, became a PDU member.|$|E
25|$|With the {{deregulation}} of the handling market from 1999, competitors with lower costs took over {{a substantial portion of}} the market. Novia failed to retain its profits and lost DKK80 million from 1999 to 2001. The CAA sold its stake in 2001 to Aviapartner, with Maersk weaving its right of first refusal. The cooperation between the two owners was poor. Maersk Air tried to either sell their stake to Aviapartner or by the other half, but in the end the two companies were not <b>even</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> speak together. Novia continued to lose money and had to receive DKK65 million in new share capital in 2001. Maersk Air eventually let the company be file for bankruptcy. The cargo handling was sold to SAS in 2003, while the remaining assets were sold for DKK1.|$|E
25|$|By that time, Drake sails and rigging {{had been}} reduced to tatters by Ranger broadsides, and even the masts and yardarms were seriously damaged; in the light wind, the sloop was more or less immobilised, not <b>even</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> turn to aim a broadside. Unable to load fast enough, the small-arms fighters had retreated to cover, so only about a dozen people were left on Drake main deck. A few minutes after the captain died, the two {{remaining}} petty officers on deck went to the master and advised him that they should strike their colours and surrender; after further consultation, he agreed. The colours had already been shot away, so Mr. Walsh had to shout and wave his hat instead. According to John Paul Jones's records, the duel lasted one hour and five minutes.|$|E
