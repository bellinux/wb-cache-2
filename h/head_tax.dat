5|$|Beginning in {{the late}} 1850s, the {{immigration}} of Chinese into the Colony of Vancouver Island and Colony of British Columbia peaked {{with the onset of}} the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush. The Chinese Immigration Act of 1885 eventually placed a <b>head</b> <b>tax</b> on all Chinese immigrants, in hopes of discouraging Chinese immigration after completion of the Canadian Pacific Railway.|$|E
5|$|With {{relatives}} in the United States, Babcock paid the $7 <b>head</b> <b>tax</b> and moved there in 1921. He received a Canadian Army pension that totaled $750 shortly after the conflict and took advantage of veteran vocational training in his native country to become an electrician. He ran a small light plant in his home neighborhood of Sydenham, and later had a career as an industrial supply salesman in the United States.|$|E
50|$|The Immigration Act of 1882 was {{the first}} major federal {{legislation}} describing a framework for regulation of immigration. The Act allowed for <b>head</b> <b>taxes</b> on certain arriving migrants, and allowed the use of this to fund a federal immigration bureaucracy.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. There is a {{gap between}} the {{predictions}} of capital tax competition models and the reality they purport to describe. In a standard capital-tax model, with <b>head</b> <b>taxes,</b> capital-importing regions tax capital and capital-exporting regions subsidize capital. In the real-world, competing regions appear to subsidize capital {{whether or not they are}} capital importers. We show that by relaxing the standard assumption of constant returns to scale symmetric regions in a Nash equilibrium may all subsidize capital. We also prove that any ine¢ciencies in a non-symmetric Nash equilibria arise entirely from regions’ incentives to manipulate the terms of trade, and not from increasing returns. We also compare our results to those in captial tax competition models without <b>head</b> <b>taxes...</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{modern era}} redress {{movement}} may {{be traced back}} to 1984, when Vancouver Member of Parliament (MP) Margaret Mitchell raised in the Canadian House of Commons the issue of repaying the Chinese <b>Head</b> <b>Tax</b> for two of her constituents. Over 4,000 other <b>head</b> <b>tax</b> payers and their family members then approached the Chinese Canadian National Council (CCNC) and its member organizations across Canada to register their <b>Head</b> <b>Tax</b> certificates and ask CCNC to represent them to lobby the government for redress. The redress campaign included holding community meetings, gathering support from other groups and prominent people, increasing the media profile, conducting research and published materials, making presentations at schools, etc.|$|E

50|$|The Chinese Immigration Act of 1885 carried great {{weight as}} a result of it being {{the first of its kind}} in Canadians history and {{subsequently}} laying down the foundations for future further exclusionary policies and acts.

25|$|The Chinese <b>head</b> <b>tax</b> was a {{fixed fee}} charged to each Chinese person {{entering}} Canada. The <b>head</b> <b>tax</b> was first levied after the Canadian parliament passed the Chinese Immigration Act of 1885 and {{was meant to}} discourage Chinese people from entering Canada {{after the completion of}} the Canadian Pacific Railway. The tax was abolished by the Chinese Immigration Act of 1923, which stopped all Chinese immigration except for business people, clergy, educators, students, and other categories.|$|E

50|$|Chinese was {{the only}} {{immigrant}} group being legally restricted by immigration policy, in which an act was passed to prohibit Chinese immigration through <b>head</b> <b>taxes</b> from 1885 until the late 1940s. Labors with low pay and appalling working conditions were the only kinds of job opportunity available for Chinese immigrants due to the anti-Asian endemic towards them as well.|$|R
50|$|<b>Head</b> <b>taxes</b> were {{important}} sources of revenue for many governments from ancient times until the 19th century.

25|$|Responding to anti-immigration {{sentiment}} in British Columbia, the federal parliament passed in 1885 the Chinese Immigration Act, which stipulated that all Chinese entering Canada must first pay a $50 fee, later {{referred to as}} a <b>head</b> <b>tax.</b> This was amended in 1887, 1892, and 1900, with the fee increasing to its maximum of $500 in 1904. Not all Chinese arrivals had to pay the <b>head</b> <b>tax,</b> however; some were presumed to return to China after from Canada because of their transitory occupation or background (students, teachers, missionaries, merchants, members of the diplomatic corps) and were therefore exempt from paying this fee.|$|E
50|$|Germany began levying <b>head</b> <b>taxes</b> in 1898, and {{relied heavily}} on forced labor to build roads and {{accomplish}} various other tasks. In 1902, Carl Peters ordered villages to grow cotton as a cash crop (for export). Each village was charged with producing a quota of cotton. The headmen of the village were left in charge of overseeing the production, which set them against {{the rest of the}} population.|$|R

5000|$|A {{poll tax}} {{is a tax}} of a portioned, fixed amount applied to an {{individual}} {{in accordance with the}} census (as opposed to a percentage of income). <b>Head</b> <b>taxes</b> were important sources of revenue for many governments from ancient times until the 19th century. The word poll is an English word that once meant [...] "head" [...] - and still does, in some specialised contexts - hence the name poll tax for a per-person tax.|$|R
25|$|But as {{the nature}} of {{parliament}} headed towards a minority situation, all political parties needed votes from all sectors of the Canadian electorates.

25|$|Beyond laws, {{new taxes}} were imposed on colonies. One of these taxes was the <b>Head</b> <b>Tax</b> in the British and French colonial empires.

25|$|At other times, {{and unlike}} future viceroys, the Governor General's {{influence}} expanded more blatantly into government policy: Grey opposed the <b>head</b> <b>tax</b> {{imposed by the}} Chinese Immigration Act of 1885 on Chinese immigrants to Canada and, at one point, was invited to visit the province of British Columbia, but declined in protest of what he thought to be exclusionary measures implemented by the provincial cabinet under premier Richard McBride. Grey also initially supported Asian immigration to Canada, though, following the Japanese victory in the Russo-Japanese War, he became concerned about the so-called Yellow Peril and worked with the federal Cabinet to explore alternatives to the <b>head</b> <b>tax</b> as a restriction on Asian immigration. He was nevertheless appalled by the 1907 anti-Asian riots in Vancouver, organised by the Asiatic Exclusion League, and, later in the same year, arranged a visit to Canada by Prince Fushimi Sadanaru of the Empire of Japan.|$|E
40|$|The research’s main thrust was to {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of the presumptive tax system in Zimbabwe, case study –Zimra Region One. The research looked at the implementation of the <b>tax</b> <b>head,</b> setting of <b>tax</b> rates, collection of revenue and the views of various stakeholders. In this study 100 ZIMRA staff members, 180 informal traders and 20 local authority staff members formed the main research participants. It was established that the presumptive <b>tax</b> <b>head</b> has not been fully implemented and administered. This has seen it contributing 60 % to the gross domestic product against a 3 % contribution to revenue compared with other <b>tax</b> <b>heads.</b> The principal findings were that many players in the informal sector are oblivious of the existence and objective of the presumptive <b>tax</b> <b>head.</b> In addition, the absence of involvement of the concerned stakeholders in determining tax rates has resulted in spirited resistance. ZIMRA has its own shortcomings which include lack of follow ups and inadequate awareness campaigns. The study revealed that effective implementation and administration of the <b>tax</b> <b>head</b> has the potential of increasing the revenue base. This means there is room for improvement on implementation and administering of the presumptive tax...|$|R

40|$|The"new view" of the {{property}} tax is reformulated {{within the context of}} a model with interjurisdictional competition, endogenous local public services, individuals who are segregated into homogeneous communities according to tastes for local public services, a simple form of land use zoning, and a political or constitutional constraint on the use of <b>head</b> <b>taxes</b> by local governments. Expressions for the "profits tax" and"excise tax" effects of {{the property}} tax are derived.

25|$|After {{the main}} gold rush, miners began laboriously {{reworking}} the goldfields. About 5,000 European miners remained in 1871, joined {{by thousands of}} Chinese miners invited by the province to help rework the area.

25|$|Nothing in the Sixteenth Amendment or in Brushaber (and {{the other}} cases {{interpreting}} the tax {{provisions of the}} U.S. Constitution) changes the general rule that direct taxes are still required to be apportioned among the states by population.

50|$|Around 775, {{the land}} and <b>head</b> <b>taxes</b> yielded an {{estimated}} 1,600,000 nomismata annually for the empire. Commerce during this period slumped, therefore only contributing 200,000 nomismata annually. The expenditures of the period were quite large {{when compared to the}} annual revenues. Approximately 600,000 nomismata went to the payroll of the army annually while other military costs took another 600,000 nomismata annually. Supporting the Byzantine bureaucracy needed 400,000 nomismata. Also, imperial largess cost the treasury 100,000 nomismata every year. All of these expenses meant that the Byzantine government had only about 100,000 nomismata in surplus revenue each year for treaties, bribes, or gifts.|$|R
