Four types of greenhouses with reflecting walls were considered with increasing efficiency of insolation.

SPATRAM is a multi-purpose UV-Vis-scanning spectrometer (250 - 950 nm) and it is installed at the Observatory of the CGE, in Evora, since April 2004. A brief description of the instrument is given, highlighting the technological innovations with respect to the previous version of similar equipment. The need for such measurements automatically taken on a routine basis in south-western European regions, specifically in Portugal, has encouraged the development and installation of the equipment and constitutes a major driving force for the present work. The main features and some improvements introduced in the DOAS (Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy) algorithms are discussed. The results obtained applying DOAS methodology to the SPATRAM spectrometer measurements of <b>diffused</b> spectral <b>sky</b> <b>radiation</b> are presented in terms of diurnal and seasonal variations of nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) and ozone (O- 3). NO 2 confirms the typical seasonal cycle reaching the maximum of (6. 5 +/- 0. 3) x 10 (+ 15) molecules cm(- 2) for the sunset values (PM), during the summer season, and the minimum of (1. 55 +/- 0. 07) x 10 (+ 15) molecules cm(- 2) for the sunrise values (AM) in winter.

Mirrored coatings can be made any color by the manufacturer for styling and fashion purposes. The color of the mirrored surface is irrelevant to the color of the lens. For example, a gray lens can have a blue mirror coating, and a brown lens can have a silver coating. Sunglasses of this type are sometimes called mirrorshades.

However, tropical diffuse radiation regimes are poorly described, and to date there are few or no site-based or regional diffuse radiation datasets.

Radiation regimes for diffuse and total radiation were characterised for each site, and the variation in clear <b>sky</b> <b>diffuse</b> <b>radiation</b> fraction between wet and dry season demonstrated and quantified, {{as well as the}} dependence of diffuse radiation on cloud amount. Using high frequency measurements of diffuse and total solar radiation data from the two sites, and estimated top of the canopy clear-sky radiation, a number of alternative models to predict diffuse radiation fraction from cloud fraction were formulated and tested. Results showed that cloud fraction can be approximated using the relationship between observed and calculated top of canopy radiation, after which diffuse radiation can then be predicted from cloud fraction. We also demonstrate that satellite cloud data (from the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project) can be used as inputs to the diffuse radiation model to provide estimates of annual and monthly diffuse radiation proportion.

40|$|Hemispherical {{photographs}} (hemiphots) {{taken from}} the ground {{looking up at the}} forest canopy provide a record of the canopy. They can be analysed to compute either relative or, more usefully, absolute measures of solar radiation for the sample point, taking account of the contributions of direct (beam or sun) and indirect (<b>diffuse</b> or <b>sky)</b> <b>radiation.</b> Hemiphots can be obtained more easily and cheaply than instrumental measurements especially in remote areas. After explaining the geometry and terminology of hemiphots and solar radiation this paper describes the methods of computing absolute amounts of radiation, dealing with direct and indirect radiation separately and summing for the total as a final step. The first method uses the product of measured radiation incident above the canopy and site factors computed from the hemiphot. Site factors are a relative measure of radiation defined as the fraction of incident radiation that reaches the ground. Direct and indirect site factors must each be calculated with appropriate weighting for the angular distribution of radiation. The second method is based on the known, constant amount of solar radiation available above the earth's atmosphere (the solar constant) and its attenuation by the atmosphere. Unfortunately, only direct radiation can be computed in this way. Neither method of computing solar radiation from hemiphots is completely independent of instrumental measurements or estimates of incident radiation for the site. The use of hemiphots (or instrumental measurements) for mapping radiation on the ground is discussed. Interpolation between sample points is a sound procedure only for long-term average radiation and where the canopy is homogeneous, having small holes uniformly distributed. In other circumstances there are unpredictable discontinuities in the amount of radiation which make mapping unreliable. Hemiphots are an invaluable tool in forest ecology but they require some instrumental measurements to be able to compute absolute amounts of radiation. Checklists of steps in computation and sources of error are given. Because of the relatively low precision of field measurements of radiation close agreement is not to be expected between computed and measured values. Attention is drawn to the assumptions that must be made in computing radiation from hemiphots as these should always be clearly stated, and tested where possible. </p...|$|R
