40|$|International audienceTo {{increase}} {{the flexibility of}} the aircraft equipments and to reduce the possession and operating costs of the aircrafts, the main aircraft manufacturers want to change fluidic systems by electrical systems. However, this evolution induces a high increase of the number of wires. Reducing the amount of wiring also allows decreasing the construction and the maintenance costs, and the polluting emissions. The other interest is improving the reliability of aircraft equipment such as allowing monitoring of power cables (telemetry). To limit the number wires, we proposed to use power line communication (PLC) for flight control systems (FCS) on the high voltage <b>direct</b> <b>current</b> <b>network</b> (HVDC), between a calculator unit and a power inverter.

In modern power systems, {{the widespread use of}} power electronics, storage devices, and automation is driving power engineers to focus on the use of direct current networks. This new focus requires specific tools for the optimal planning and operation of these networks in order to increase energy efficiency and reduce operating costs. This paper is focused on the improvements in the efficiencies of direct current networks, which are characterized by the presence of loads, units for the generation of renewable power, and storage devices. Based on the calculus of variations, an original matrix formulation which starts with the nodal representation of the <b>direct</b> <b>current</b> <b>network</b> is proposed. Two attractive closed-form solutions are presented for minimizing power losses, i. e., (1) a solution based on the approximation of considering the voltage constant at all the network's busses and (2) a solution based on the linear approximation of the load flow. In both cases, the goal is to minimize losses over a given time horizon (e. g., the daily cycle). The formulation of the problem allows {{an analytical}} solution to be obtained that represents a suitable tool for the purpose of designing storage. In addition, the proposed approach can be applied and extended to the optimal sizing of storage systems. The proposed sizing procedure, which uses an analytical approach, is formulated in a general manner {{that can be used for}} various storage technologies.

Despite significant cost reductions in solar panels, these options can still be cost-prohibitive mainly due over-sizing of generation assets corresponding {{with a lack of}} ability to actively manage electricity demand. The main contribution shared is the methodology and optimization approach of least-cost combinations of generation asset sizes, in solar panels and batteries, subject to meeting reliability constraints; these results are based on a techno-economic modeling approach constructed for assessing decentralized micro-grids with demand-side management capabilities. The software model constructed is implemented to represent the technical characteristics of a low-voltage, <b>direct</b> <b>current</b> <b>network</b> architecture and computational capabilities of a power management device. The main use-case of the model presented is based on serving representative, aggregated, household-level load profiles combined with simulated power output from solar photovoltaic modules and the kinetic operating constraints of lead-acid batteries at hourly timesteps over year-long simulations. The state-space for solutions is based on available solar module and battery capacities from distributors in Jharkhand, India. Additional work presented also extends to real-time operation of such isolated micro-grids with requisite local computation. First, for load disaggregation and forecasting purposes, clustering algorithms and statistical learning techniques are applied on quantitative results from inferred load profiles based on data logged from off-grid solar home systems. Second, results from an optimization approach to accurately parametrize a lead-acid battery model for potential usage in real-time field implementation are also shared. Economic results, sensitivity analyses around key technical and financial input assumptions, and comparisons in cost reductions due to the optimization of solar and battery assets for decentralized micro-grids with demand-side management capabilities are subsequently presented.

Variable speed wind turbines and other low-carbon generators or loads that are connected through inverters do not inherently contribute to the inertia of AC grids. A coordinated control scheme for frequency support from multi-terminal VSC-HVDC (MTDC) scheme was designed to transfer additional power to AC grids from the kinetic energy stored in the wind turbine rotating mass and the active power transferred from other AC systems. The wind turbine inertia response limited {{the rate of change}} of AC grid frequency and the active power transferred from the other AC system reduced the frequency deviation. The wind turbines recovered back to their original speed after their inertia response and transferred a recovery power to the AC grid. An alternative coordinated control scheme with a frequency versus active power droop controller was designed for frequency support from MTDC schemes, in order to transfer the recovery power of wind turbines to other AC systems. This prevented a further drop of frequency on the AC grid. The effectiveness of the alternative coordinated control scheme was verified using the PSCAD simulation tool and demonstrated using an experimental test rig. A scaling method was demonstrated for a multi-terminal DC test rig to represent the equivalent steady state operation of different VSC-HVDC systems.

Hyperlinked release notes can be found here: [URL] This release contains some minor new features and a few minor but important API changes. * There is a new component Global Constraints for implementing constraints that effect many components at once (see also the LOPF subsection Global constraints). Currently only constraints related to primary energy (i. e. before conversion with losses by generators) are supported, the canonical example being CO 2 emissions for an optimisation period. Other primary-energy-related gas emissions also fall into this framework. Other types of global constraints will be added in future, e. g. “final energy” (for limits on the share of renewable or nuclear electricity after conversion), “generation capacity” (for limits on total capacity expansion of given carriers) and “transmission capacity” (for limits on the total expansion of lines and links). This replaces the ad hoc network. co 2 _limit attribute. If you were using this, instead of network. co 2 _limit = my_cap do network. add("GlobalConstraint", "co 2 _limit", type="primary_energy", carrier_attribute="co 2 _emissions", sense="<=", constant="my_cap"). The shadow prices of the global constraints are automatically saved in network. global_constraints. mu. * The LOPF output network. buses_t. marginal_price is now defined differently if network. snapshot_weightings are not 1. Previously if the generator {{at the top of}} the merit order had marginal_cost c and the snapshot weighting was w, the marginal_price was cw. Now it is c, which is more standard. See also Nodal power balances. * network. pf() now returns a dictionary of pandas DataFrames, each indexed by snapshots and sub-networks. converged is a table of booleans indicating whether the power flow has converged; error gives the deviation of the non-linear solution; n_iter the number of iterations required to achieve the tolerance. * network. consistency_check() now includes checking for potentially infeasible values in generator. p_{min,max}_pu. * The PyPSA version number is now saved in network. pypsa_version. In future versions of PyPSA this information will be used to upgrade data to the latest version of PyPSA. * network. sclopf() has an extra_functionality argument that behaves like that for network. lopf(). * Component attributes which are strings are now better handled on import and in the consistency checking. * There is a new generation investment screening curve example showing the long-term equilibrium of generation investment for a given load profile and comparing it to a screening curve analysis. * There is a new logging example that demonstrates how to control the level of logging that PyPSA reports back, e. g. error/warning/info/debug messages. * Sundry other bug fixes and improvements. * All examples have been updated appropriately. Thanks to Nis Martensen for contributing the return values of network. pf() and Konstantinos Syranidis for contributing the improved network. consistency_check() ...|$|R
