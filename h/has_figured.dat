5|$|Chopin <b>has</b> <b>figured</b> {{extensively}} in Polish literature, both in serious critical studies {{of his life}} and music and in fictional treatments. The earliest manifestation was probably an 1830 sonnet on Chopin by Leon Ulrich.

There are numerous biographies of Chopin in English (see bibliography for some of these).|$|E

They were a substantial and increasingly vibrant presence in Cluj in the modern era, contributing significantly to the town's economic dynamism and cultural flourishing in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Although the community comprised a significant share of the town's population during the interwar era—between 13 and 15 percent—this figure plummeted {{as a consequence of the}} Holocaust and emigration; by the 1990s only a few hundred Jews remained in Cluj-Napoca.|$|E

After breaking through the building's defenses, Delsin confronts Augustine and reveals to her that he <b>has</b> <b>figured</b> out she staged the Conduit escape at Akomish to instill fear in the population and give the D.U.P. a reason to continue their regime. Augustine lets Delsin absorb her powers, and tells him that she wants to save the Conduits by imprisoning and protecting them from the population. Delsin battles and eventually defeats Augustine with his new concrete powers.|$|E

Because of the small size of Belize's population and the intimate scale of social relations, the social distance between the rich and the poor, while significant, is nowhere as vast as in other Caribbean and Central American societies, such as Jamaica and El Salvador. Belize lacks the violent class and racial conflict that <b>has</b> <b>figured</b> so prominently in the social life of its Central American neighbours.|$|E

Clinton considered Harkin in 1992 because of his ties to labor and strong support {{after he left the}} presidential race. In 2000, Harkin was considered a running mate by then-Vice President Al Gore. However, Harkin's age was one reason he was not considered as strongly this time. In 2004, as Senator John Kerry (D-Massachusetts) looked at Harkin as a running mate among other Senate colleagues, though Harkin promoted his protege, then-Governor Tom Vilsack (D-Iowa).|$|E

Lawrence was destroyed in the 2006 TV Series Jericho.|$|E

During the late Middle Ages, {{cities such as}} Ghent, Bruges, Antwerp and Brussels made {{it one of the}} richest and most urbanized parts of Europe, weaving the wool of neighbouring lands into cloth for both domestic use and export. As a consequence, a very sophisticated culture developed, with impressive achievements in the arts and architecture, rivaling those of northern Italy. Belgium was one of the centres of the 19th century industrial revolution but Flanders was at first overtaken by French-speaking Wallonia. In {{the second half of the}} 20th century, however, Flanders' economy modernised rapidly, and today Flanders is significantly more wealthy than its southern counterpart and in general one of the most wealthy regions in Europe and the world.|$|E

500|$|During {{his senior}} year, Petoskey started all eight games at left {{end for the}} 1933 Michigan Wolverines {{football}} team, as Michigan won its second consecutive national championship, and Petoskey was again named an All-American. [...] Although Petoskey was principally an end, Coach Kipke played Petoskey at fullback in some games in 1933. [...] An October 1933 newspaper story reported on his versatility: [...] "Ted Petoskey, Michigan's brilliant right end was moved into the backfield for last night's practice ... This {{is the second time}} Petoskey <b>has</b> <b>figured</b> in such a shift. [...] Last fall he was converted into a fullback before the Illinois game and proved a capable ground gainer. [...] Monday he was given a trial as a forward passer, and made an impressive showing." [...] In his final game for the Michigan football team, Petoskey also kicked a 35-yard field goal against Northwestern, representing the final points scored for Michigan in its 1933 championship season.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Entertainment Weekly gave [...] "Syzygy" [...] an A, describing the episode as [...] "another uproarious send-up, {{this time of}} teen venom, B-movie paranoia, and our agents' painfully restrained rapport", with praise to the villains and the discussion on why Mulder always drives, considered [...] "one of Mulder's and Scully's funniest exchanges". Todd VanDerWerff [...] of The A.V. Club gave a B-, describing it as [...] "an entertaining hour that never rises {{to the level of}} those other episodes" [...] like [...] "Humbug" [...] and [...] "War of the Coprophages". VanDerWerff argued that [...] "Syzygy" [...] was an attempt by Carter to try and emulate the writing style of Darin Morgan's scripts, without success; he noted [...] "the laughs here are emptier than they were the week before in 'Coprophages'"—and adding that [...] "every time you think the episode <b>has</b> <b>figured</b> out a way to plant its foot firmly in comedic territory, there's a horribly judged moment of 'drama,' like Mulder's final monologue." [...] Connie Ogle of Popmatters listed Margi and Terri among the best monster-of-the-week characters of the series, describing [...] "Syzygy" [...] as a [...] "hilarious send-up of Heathers".|$|E

500|$|Richard Schickel of Time {{magazine}} praised Zorro as {{a summer}} blockbuster which paid tribute to the classical Hollywood swashbuckler films. [...] "The action in this movie, most of which {{takes the form of}} spectacular stunt work performed by real, as opposed to digitized, people," [...] Schickel stated, [...] "is motivated by simple, powerful emotions of an old-fashioned and rather melodramatic nature." [...] Zorro exceeded Roger Ebert's expectations, who was surprised by the screenplay's display of traditional film craftsmanship. [...] "It's a reminder of the time when stunts and special effects were integrated into stories, {{rather than the other way}} around." [...] Ebert later called The Mask of Zorro [...] "probably the best Zorro movie ever made." [...] Despite giving credit to Anthony Hopkins for his masculine portrayal of an older Zorro, Mick LaSalle, writing in the San Francisco Chronicle, found that the actor's [...] "performance presents a slight problem: The film asks us to believe that no one <b>has</b> <b>figured</b> out that Zorro and his real-life persona are the same person, even though they are the only guys in Mexico who talk with a British accent." ...|$|E
