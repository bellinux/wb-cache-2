The purpose of this project is to provide the first year <b>school</b> <b>psychologist</b> a handbook of relevant information pertaining to the primary issues facing them in their first year of professional practice. It is intended to increase the job success of the beginning <b>school</b> <b>psychologist.</b> The selection of topics included in the handbook came from various sources including professional literature on legal and ethical influences, as well as best practices in consultation, supporting families, and preventing burnout.

[...] Best practice proposes that school climate is first described and measured before a plan of action is developed and implemented. While efforts to improve school climate can be implemented at the national level with large-scale reform, or on a smaller scale at the individual school or district level, the strategies used to improve school climate need to be based on the individual strengths and weaknesses of each school.
