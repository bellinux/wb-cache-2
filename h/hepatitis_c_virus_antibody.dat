Chronic HCV infection constitutes a serious health challenge in places where prevalence is substantial. In Nigeria, {{there is a high}} risk because donor blood is not routinely screened for HCV. Patients with sickle cell anaemia (SCA) are considered a subset of the population at higher risk of acquiring the virus, due to their frequent needs for transfusion of blood and its products. However, the magnitude of HCV infection has not been adequately measured in our general population and specific data on HCV in SCA patients are scanty, hence a prospec-tive case controlled study to determine the prevalence of HCV antibodies in transfused SCA patients at-tending the sickle cell anaemia clinic in the University of Ilorin Teaching Hospital (UITH), Ilorin was taken.

40|$|Coinfection {{with other}} {{hepatitis}} viruses modifies the viral profile in serum {{and leads to}} more liver damage and more rapid progression {{during the course of}} <b>hepatitis</b> <b>C</b> <b>virus</b> infection. The viral interference is not only carried out by virus-virus or by virus-cell interactions but also by an enhanced immune response. A superinfecting viral infection does not crossactivate protective immune responses to the pre-existing virus albeit the latter can become undetectable. The induced cytokine stimulation might enhance the hepatic inflammation. Moreover, hepatitis B virus coinfection increases the risk of development of hepatocellular carcinoma in <b>hepatitis</b> <b>C</b> <b>virus</b> patients through common necro-inflammatory pathways or by direct oncogenic activity of hepatitis B virus. Viral interaction also complicates the management of the coinfection because <b>hepatitis</b> <b>C</b> <b>virus</b> impairs the humoral response to hepatitis A virus and hepatitis B virus vaccines, and because pharmacological suppression of <b>hepatitis</b> <b>C</b> <b>virus</b> endangers dually infected patients with reactivation of coinfected hepatitis B virus. Optimized strategies and follow-up are thus necessary in the treatment of infection with multiple viruses. It seems thus necessary to look for markers of hepatitis B virus and/or hepatitis D virus infection in chronic hepatitis patients positive for <b>hepatitis</b> <b>C</b> <b>virus</b> <b>antibodies</b> but negative for <b>hepatitis</b> <b>C</b> <b>virus</b> RNA, and equally well to search for <b>hepatitis</b> <b>C</b> <b>virus</b> RNA in HBsAg-negative/anti-HBc-positive patients with a low level of serum hepatitis B virus DNA. status: publishe...|$|R

METHODS: We have previously described 127 long-term-studied and well-characterized {{patients with chronic}} non-A, non-B hepatitis (NANBH). Ninety-one (71. 7 %) were positive for <b>hepatitis</b> <b>C</b> <b>virus</b> <b>antibodies</b> (anti-HCV) in a first-generation anti-HCV enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). We now reanalyzed {{the same group of}} patients and added a third-generation anti-HCV ELISA and recombinant immunoblot assay and, in negative patients, also polymerase chain reactions for <b>hepatitis</b> <b>C</b> <b>virus</b> RNA, <b>hepatitis</b> GBV-C RNA, and hepatitis B virus DNA. Additional tests for autoimmune hepatitis types 2 and 3 were also included. RESULTS: Anti-HCV were detected in 114 of the 123 evaluable patients (92. 7 %). Of the remaining nine anti-HCV-negative patients one had misdiagnosed primary biliary cirrhosis, and two had autoimmune hepatitis type 3.

However, the magnitude of HCV infection has not been adequately measured in our general population and specific data on HCV in SCA patients are scanty, hence a prospective case controlled study to determine the prevalence of HCV antibodies in transfused SCA patients attending the sickle cell anaemia clinic in the University of Ilorin Teaching Hospital (UITH), Ilorin was taken. Objective: To determine the prevalence of Hepatitis C virus antibodies among transfused children with SCA in Ilorin. Subjects and Method: Eighty two transfused SCA children aged 6 months to 14 years were recruited consecutively from February 2008 to January 2009 while eighty four non transfused SCA children of the same age range recruited over the same period served as controls. <b>Hepatitis</b> <b>C</b> <b>virus</b> <b>antibody</b> screening was done using a second generation ELISA method. Results: The overall prevalence of HCV antibody was 3. 0 %, while it was 3. 7 % and 2. 4 % in the transfused and non transfused SCA patients respectively (χ 2 = 0. 23, p = 0. 68). The patients were also comparable across the social class when sub categorized into high and low social class (χ 2 = 0. 37, p = 1. 00 (subjects), χ 2 = 0. 42, p = 1. 00 (controls).

Preexistent viral hepatitis {{was significantly associated with}} liver dysfunction (65 % in patients positive for hepatitis B core antibody and patients positive for <b>hepatitis</b> <b>C</b> <b>virus</b> <b>antibodies).</b> Our study confirmed the association of liver dysfunction with IVMP during and after treatment. It suggests that, in patients with GO, evaluation of preexisting risk factors—including viral hepatitis—and careful weekly monitoring of liver function during IVMP therapy and monthly thereafter for 12 months are warranted...|$|R
40|$|Background: Hepatocellular {{carcinoma}} is {{the most}} frequent primary tumor of the liver. It is associated to chronic liver diseases and has a high prevalence in some regions of Africa and Asia. Aim: To describe the clinical characteristics of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, admitted to two hospitals of the IX region of southern Chile. Material and methods: Prospective study of 29 consecutive patients admitted to two hospitals in Temuco, Chile. Clinical features, laboratory values and viral markers were analyzed. Results: Eighteen patients were male and ages ranged from 29 to 75 years old. The most frequent presenting symptom was abdominal pain in 21 patients. Seven subjects {{had a history of}} alcoholism. Serum bilirubin values ranged from 0. 1 to 15. 8 mg/dl, alkaline phosphatases ranged from 171 to 3476 U/l, ASAT from 24 to 5400 U/l and alpha feto protein from 1. 4 to 350 ng/ml. Two patients had a positive hepatitis B surface antigen and all had negative <b>hepatitis</b> <b>C</b> <b>virus</b> <b>antibodies.</b> Mean tumoral diameter was 9. 6 cm and the most common presentation was nodular. Mean survival after the diagnosis was 6. 3 months. Conclusions: These patients with hepatocellular carcinoma have a low frequency of positive viral markers and tumors of large sizes on presentation.

40|$|The {{prevalence}} of <b>hepatitis</b> B and <b>C</b> <b>virus</b> infections was studied in 70 patients {{diagnosed as having}} hepatocellular carcinoma. In addition to viral serological markers, serum hepatitis B <b>virus</b> DNA and <b>hepatitis</b> <b>C</b> <b>virus</b> RNA were determined with a nested polymerase chain reaction assay. Twelve patients (17 %) were HBsAg positive, 26 (37 %) had antibodies to HBs, HBc or both and 32 (46 %) were negative for all hepatitis B virus serological markers. Prevalence of the <b>antibody</b> to <b>hepatitis</b> <b>C</b> <b>virus</b> was 63 % (44 patients). Hepatitis B virus DNA was detected in 24 of the 66 tested patients (36 %). Twelve of these hepatitis B virus DNA-positive patients were HBsAg negative (seven were positive for antibody to HBs, antibody to HBc or both and five were negative for all hepatitis B <b>virus</b> serological markers). <b>Hepatitis</b> <b>C</b> <b>virus</b> RNA was found in 42 of 68 patients (62 %). A high correlation (95 %) existed between <b>hepatitis</b> <b>C</b> <b>virus</b> RNA and <b>hepatitis</b> <b>C</b> <b>virus</b> <b>antibodies.</b> Nevertheless, two patients without <b>antibody</b> to <b>hepatitis</b> <b>C</b> <b>virus</b> had serum <b>hepatitis</b> <b>C</b> <b>virus</b> RNA sequences. Coinfection by the two viruses was detected in nine subjects (14 %), but no clinical {{differences were found between}} these {{and the rest of the}} patients. We conclude that nearly 90 % (62 of the 70 patients studied) of cases of hepatocellular carcinoma in our geographical area are related to hepatitis virus infections (detected by serological or molecular studies). <b>Hepatitis</b> <b>C</b> is more prevalent than hepatitis B virus in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, and the infection is still active when the tumor is diagnosed...|$|R
