40|$|Styrene {{metabolism}} in styrene-degrading Pseudomonas putida CA- 3 cells {{has been}} shown to proceed via <b>styrene</b> <b>oxide,</b> phenylacetaldehyde, and phenylacetic acid. The initial step in styrene degradation by strain CA- 3 is oxygen-dependent epoxidation of <b>styrene</b> to <b>styrene</b> <b>oxide,</b> which is subsequently isomerized to phenylacetaldehyde. Phenylacetaldehyde is then oxidized to phenylacetic acid. <b>Styrene,</b> <b>styrene</b> <b>oxide,</b> and phenylacetaldehyde induce the enzymes involved in the degradation of styrene to phenylacetic acid by P. putida CA- 3. Phenylacetic acid-induced cells do not oxidize <b>styrene</b> or <b>styrene</b> <b>oxide.</b> Thus, <b>styrene</b> degradation by P. putida CA- 3 can be subdivided further into an upper pathway which consists of <b>styrene,</b> <b>styrene</b> <b>oxide,</b> and phenylacetaldehyde and a lower pathway which begins with phenylacetic acid. Studies of the repression of styrene degradation by P. putida CA- 3 show that glucose has no effect on the activity of styrene-degrading enzymes.

40|$|In {{the first}} step of the styrene catabolic and {{detoxification}} pathway styrene is transformed to <b>styrene</b> <b>oxide,</b> a biochemical alkylating agent and carcinogen. <b>Styrene</b> <b>oxide</b> isomerase [EC 5. 3. 99. 7] performs the critical role of catalyzing the isomerization of <b>styrene</b> <b>oxide</b> to phenylacetaldehyde.

The enzyme was assayed by SDS-PAGE, and its presence was verified by mass spectrometry. An enzyme-coupled assay with phenylacetaldehyde dehydrogenase was developed to indirectly monitor the activity and kinetically characterize the enzyme. In this way, the steady-state kinetic parameters were determined at pH 8. 0 and 25 ??C with little <b>styrene</b> <b>oxide</b> stereoselectivity.

It catalyzes the isomerization of <b>styrene</b> <b>oxide</b> to phenylacetaldehyde. In this study a styC gene, which encodes the SOI of Rhodococcus opacus 1 CP, was optimized for optimal expression in Escherichia coli BL 21 (DE 3) pLysS. The expression of this synthetic styC was investigated and subsequently optimized. Highly active biomass was obtained yielding an SOI activity of 44. 5 ± 8. 7 Umg− 1 after 10 h. This represents the highest SOI activity reported for crude cell extracts of SOI-containing bacterial strains.

40|$|In {{order to}} design a {{biocatalyst}} {{for the production of}} optically pure <b>styrene</b> <b>oxide,</b> an important building block in organic synthesis, the metabolic pathway and molecular biology of styrene degradation in Pseudomonas sp. strain VLB 120 was investigated. A 5. 7 -kb XhoI fragment, which contained on the same strand of DNA six genes involved in styrene degradation, was isolated from a gene library of this organism in Escherichia coli by screening for indigo formation. T 7 RNA polymerase expression experiments indicated that this fragment coded for at least five complete polypeptides, StyRABCD, corresponding to five of the six genes. The first two genes encoded the potential carboxy-terminal part of a sensor, named StySc, and the complete response regulator StyR. Fusion of the putative styAp promoter to a lacZ reporter indicated that StySc and StyR together regulate expression of the structural genes at the transcriptional level. Expression of styScR also alleviated a block that prevented translation of styA mRNA when a heterologous promoter was used. The structural genes styA and styB produced a styrene monooxygenase that converted <b>styrene</b> to <b>styrene</b> <b>oxide,</b> which was then converted to phenylacetaldehyde by StyC. Sequence homology analysis of StyD indicated a probable function as a phenylacetaldehyde dehydrogenase. To assess the usefulness of the enzymes for the production of enantiomerically pure <b>styrene</b> <b>oxide,</b> we investigated the enantiospecificities of the reactions involved. Kinetic resolution of racemic <b>styrene</b> <b>oxide</b> by <b>styrene</b> <b>oxide</b> isomerase was studied with E. coli recombinants carrying styC, which converted <b>styrene</b> <b>oxide</b> at a very high rate but with only a slight preference for the S enantiomer.

40|$|Electrochemical biosensors {{for rapid}} and {{inexpensive}} toxicity screening of chemicals have been developed. Chemically induced DNA {{damage caused by}} lipophilic pollutants and drugs metabolized by mammalian liver cytochrome P 450 enzymes represents a major toxicity pathway. In many cases, the mechanism of causing diseases involves the damage of DNA and other essential biomolecules. Therefore, methods for detecting such DNA damage could serve as effective screens in vitro for the toxicity of new chemicals {{at an early stage}} in their commercial development. ^ The first generation of such biosensors was achieved by casting a mixture of double stranded (ds) -DNA and ionomer (Eastman AQ) on pyrolytic graphite (PG) electrodes. The sensor was evaluated with the model carcinogen <b>styrene</b> <b>oxide.</b> DNA damage caused by incubation of the sensor films with <b>styrene</b> <b>oxide</b> was detected with derivative square wave voltammetry (d-SWV). ^ The sensitivity of the detection method was significantly improved in a second generation sensor {{with the use of a}} metal complex probe, tris(2, 2 ′-bipyridyl) cobalt(III) [Co(bpy) 33 +] that binds reversibly to ds-DNA and with a weaker binding to damaged DNA. A layer-by-layer technique was used to build the sensor films in this method. DNA damage by <b>styrene</b> <b>oxide</b> can be detected with significant signals after only 2 -min incubation, roughly corresponding to 0. 05 % damage or 5 damaged bases per 10000 in polyion/DNA films by square wave voltammetry (SWV). ^ A great leap was accomplished with third generation sensors.

The research undertaken involved the use of deuterium labelling studies working with enantio-enriched epoxides. Chapter One reviews previous literature and the results of previous mechanistic studies into the Lewis acid catalysed rearrangements of epoxides. Chapter Two describes the development of new methodology for the measurement of the relative amounts of hydrogen and deuterium in each position of the aldehyde produced by hydride or deuteride migration in the rearrangement of <b>styrene</b> <b>oxide.</b> The method consisted of reduction of the aldehyde to an alcohol and subsequent reaction of the alcohol with a chiral acid chloride {{in the presence of a}} chiral shift reagent [Yb(hfc) 3 or Eu(hfc) 3] to measure the diastereomeric/enantiomeric excess in the aldehyde product mixture. The diastereomeric/enantiomeric excess thus determined, can be correlated back to determine the full stereochemical course of the initial epoxide rearrangement. De-convolution of overlapping peaks by mathematical modelling was sometimes necessary. Chapter Three describes the enantiose 1 ective synthesis of several undeuterated and deuterated <b>styrene</b> <b>oxides</b> that were then used as substrates to study their BF 3. OEt 2 and LiClO 4 rearrangement to give aldehydes. In Chapter Four the BF 3. OEt 2 catalysed rearrangement of enantioenriched deuterated analogues of <b>styrene</b> <b>oxide</b> are investigated.
