50|$|The P.139B was {{the result}} of design work from the former Blackburn Aircraft design team. In 1962, when they set out on the AEW project, they looked {{primarily}} at three scanner configurations - a ventral radome, as with the Skyraider and Gannet; a dorsal radome like the E-1 Tracer; and a Fore Aft Scanner System (FASS) that used a pair of radar scanners mounted at the front and rear of the airframe. Having studied all three in detail, it was determined that the FASS was the one that gave the best performance. This led, in 1963, to the P.139 proposal. The P.139 design was not dissimilar to the Lockheed S-3 Viking in being a relatively short, high-wing monoplane with a pair of high-bypass turbofan engines under the wings; the wings were planned to be hinged so that they would fold next to the engines. To accommodate the FASS system, the design had a tailplane initially planned as cruciform, before eventually graduating to a full t-tail plan. The plan was for the Frequency Modulated <b>Interrupted</b> <b>Continuous</b> <b>Wave</b> (FMICW) radar system to be installed with a scanner in the nose and one in the tail, giving it a bulbous appearance, which ended up being suspect in wind tunnel tests. The aircraft was also considered for the Carrier Onboard Delivery role, which would have seen the scanners removed, and the nose faired in, while the tail scanner was removed and replaced with a cone shaped freight door to give access to the internal space for freight or passengers.|$|E

40|$|Ground wave radar is {{emerging}} as an important tool for routine monitoring of ocean surface conditions and for ship and sea-ice surveillance at ranges well beyond the line-of-sight horizon that limits conventional systems. A major Canadian advance in this field is the recent development of a long-range ground wave radar facility at Cape Race, Newfoundland. Owned and operated by the Northern Radar Systems Limited, this short-based radar system can monitor ocean surface conditions over a 120 ° sector out {{to a range of}} 200 km for sea state and to a range of 300 km for ocean surface currents. The near-real-time surface wave parameters are extracted from the Doppler spectra of the frequency-modulated <b>interrupted</b> <b>continuous</b> <b>wave</b> ground wave radar system. This paper presents a brief overview of the radar system and discusses the process of extracting the one-dimensional wave spectrum and significant wave height from the Doppler spectra. The latter involves both the direct inversion of the HF (high frequency) radar cross section of the ocean surface as well as the least square fitting of modeled UF spectra. The ground wave radar facility at Cape Race was used in the measurement of wave parameters during the SAR (synthetic aperture radar) wave spectra validation experiments, offshore Newfoundland during November 1991. The SAR is one of the sensors aboard the European Space Agency's Remote Sensing Satellite (ERS- 1) launched in June 1991. The wave parameters deduced by the ground wave radar were evaluated against buoy measurements as well as against hindcast values from the operational wave model, Canadian Spectral Ocean Wave Model. The radar-deduced wave heights were also evaluated against wave height charts prepared routinely by the Meteorology and Oceanography Centre at Halifax, Nova Scotia. Overall, a very good agreement was obtained. The utility of the radar for nearshore wave analysis and nowcasting, as well as for offshore surveillance, is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Through-The-Wall-Detection (TTWD) {{techniques}} {{can improve the}} situational awareness of police and soldiers, and support first responders in search and rescue operations. A variety of systems for TTWD based on different waveforms have been developed and presented in the literature, e. g. radar systems based on pulses, noise or pseudo-noise waveforms, and frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) or stepped frequency continuous wave (SFCW) waveforms. Ultra wide band signals are normally used as they provide suitable resolution to discriminate different targets. A common problem for active radar systems for TTWD is the strong backscattered signal from the air-wall interface. This undesired signal can overshadow the reflections from actual targets, especially those with low radar cross section like human beings, and limit the dynamic range at the receiver, which could be saturated and blocked. Although several techniques {{have been developed to}} address this problem, frequency modulated <b>interrupted</b> <b>continuous</b> <b>wave</b> (FMICW) waveforms represent an interesting further approach to wall removal, which can be used as an alternative technique or combined with the existing ones. FMICW waveforms have been used in the past for ionospheric and ocean sensing radar systems, but their application to the wall removal problem in TTWD scenarios is novel. The validation of the effectiveness of the proposed FMICW waveforms as wall removal technique is therefore the primary objective of this thesis, focusing on comparing simulated and experimental results using normal FMCW waveforms and using the proposed FMICW waveforms. Initially, numerical simulations of realistic scenarios for TTWD have been run and FMICW waveforms have been successfully tested for different materials and internal structure of the wall separating the radar system and the targets. Then a radar system capable of generating FMICW waveforms has been designed and built to perform a measurement campaign in environments of the School of Engineering and Computing Sciences, Durham University. These tests aimed at the localization of stationary targets and at the detection of people behind walls. FMICW waveforms prove to be effective in removing/mitigating the undesired return caused by antenna cross-talk and wall reflections, thus enhancing the detection of targets...|$|E
