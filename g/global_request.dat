We analyze the distributed architecture of a VoD system to design <b>global</b> <b>request</b> handling and admission control strategies and evaluate them using global metrics. The performance evalua-tion methodology developed in this paper helps in determining effi-cient ways of using all resources in the VoD architecture within the constraints of providing guaranteed high quality service to each re-quest. For instance, our simulation results show that request han-dling policies based on limited redirection of blocked requests to other resources perform better than load sharing policies. We also show that request handling policies based on redirection have sim-pler connection establishment semantics than load sharing policies and, therefore, are easily incorporated into reservation or signaling protocols.

Since {{the network is}} mobile and often sparse in terms of node contacts, nodes store messages in their buffers, carrying them, and forwarding them upon node encounters. This form of communication leads {{to a set of}} challenging issues that we investigate: congestion, transfer ordering, and resilience. Congestion occurs in opportunistic networks when a node's buffers becomes full. To be able to receive new messages, old messages have to be evicted. We show that buffer eviction strategies based on replication statistics perform better than strategies that evict messages based on the content of the message. We show that transfer ordering has {{a significant impact on the}} dissemination of messages during time limited contacts. We find that transfer strategies satisfying <b>global</b> <b>requests</b> yield a higher delivery ratio but a longer delay for the most requested data compared to satisfying the neighboring node's requests. Finally, we assess the resilience of opportunistic networks by simulating different types of attacks. Instead of enumerating all possible attack combinations, which would lead to exhaustive evaluations, we introduce a method that use heuristics to approximate the extreme outcomes an attack can have. The method yields a lower and upper bound for the evaluated metric over the different realizations of the attack. We show that some types of attacks are harder to predict the outcome of and other attacks may vary in the impact of the attack due to the properties of the attack, the forwarding protocol, and the mobility pattern.

Most studies have tested these products in short-term experiments, but little information is available on their effect on plants at the maturity stage of growth.

Owing to content control and other issues, some video-on-demand systems attempt to prevent downloading and peer-to-peer content delivery. Instead, such systems rely on server replication, such as via third-party Content Distribution Networks, to support video streaming (or pseudo-streaming) to their clients. A major issue with such systems is the cost of the required server resources. By synchronizing the video streams for clients that make closely-spaced requests for the same video, from the same server, server costs (such as for retrieval of the video data from disk) can be amortized over multiple requests. A fundamental tradeoff then arises, however, with respect to server selection. Network delivery cost is minimized by selecting the nearest server, while server cost is minimized by directing closely-spaced requests for the same video to a common server. This paper compares classes of server selection policies within the context of a simple system model. We conclude that (i) server selection using dynamic system state information (rather than only proximities and average loads) can yield large improvements in performance, (ii) deferring server selection for a request as late as possible (i. e., until just before streaming is to begin) can yield additional large improvements, and (iii) within the class of policies using dynamic state information and deferred selection, policies using only “local ” (rather than <b>global)</b> <b>request</b> information are able to achieve most of the potential performance gains...|$|E
