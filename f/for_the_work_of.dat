5|$|Millbank is a {{district}} by the River Thames, east of Pimlico. It is {{the location of}} Tate Britain and the Chelsea College of Arts.

5|$|During {{the coming}} decades, however, the {{suitability}} of the tower <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> the department came into question. The condition of the roof remained problematic, and steel girders had {{to be added to}} support the main timbers. Increasing traffic levels around the tower led to subsidence and high levels of vibration, effecting the operation of the delicate instruments, and worsened after the opening of Lambeth Bridge in 1932. Some of the department's work was transferred to their Bushy House facility in Teddington in the 1920s, and in 1938 the department relinquished the tower altogether.|$|E
5|$|Gellibrand {{was sent}} to the AIF Depots in the United Kingdom as Brigadier General, General Staff (BGGS) to Major General James Whiteside McCay. McCay was known as a hard task master, but he had nothing but praise <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> Gellibrand, who helped him {{overhaul}} the organisation and the training syllabus. Likewise, Gellibrand held McCay in high regard. Gellibrand returned to the Western Front on 14 November 1917, taking over command of the 12th Infantry Brigade vice Brigadier General James Campbell Robertson, who was returning to Australia on leave. He soon placed his own distinctive stamp on his new command. In April 1918, the brigade was committed to battle {{in the path of the}} advancing German Army in the Battle of Dernancourt. The brigade held and defeated the German advance.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} twentieth century notable {{photographic}} work in Scotland included that of visiting artists, such as Alvin Langdon Coburn (1882–1966), whose produced illustrations <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> Robert Louis Stevenson and Paul Strand (1890–1976), as well as atmospheric depictions of Hebridean landscapes. There was also the record of the Gorbals in Glasgow made by Bert Hardy (1913–95), Joseph MacKenzie (b. 1929) and Oscar Marzaroli (1933–88), but, having pioneered photography in the late nineteenth century, the artistic attainment of native photographers was not high in {{the early twentieth}} century.|$|E
5|$|Euler proved Newton's identities, Fermat's little theorem, Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares, {{and he made}} {{distinct}} {{contributions to}} Lagrange's four-square theorem. He also invented the totient function φ(n), the number of positive integers {{less than or equal}} to the integer n that are coprime to n. Using properties of this function, he generalized Fermat's little theorem to what is now known as Euler's theorem. He contributed significantly to the theory of perfect numbers, which had fascinated mathematicians since Euclid. He proved that the relationship shown between perfect numbers and Mersenne primes earlier proved by Euclid was one-to-one, a result otherwise known as the Euclid–Euler theorem. Euler also conjectured the law of quadratic reciprocity. The concept is regarded as a fundamental theorem of number theory, and his ideas paved the way <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> Carl Friedrich Gauss.|$|E
5|$|Robert {{wrote his}} Life and Miracles of St Thomas of Canterbury around 1173 to 1174. Though lost, {{it is one}} of the main sources for an Icelandic saga on Becket {{entitled}} Thómas saga Erkibyskups, which survives in a copy dating from the first half of the 14th century. This saga preserves a number of otherwise unknown details about Becket's life and remains one of the main sources for Becket studies. Robert's life also was a source <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> Benet of St Albans, another biographer of Becket. A modern historian partially reconstructed Robert's biography from these sources. A major source for Robert's work on Becket was the writings of John of Salisbury. A modern biographer of Becket, Frank Barlow, speculates that Robert's biography was lost because it favoured the king's side of the story, rather than Becket's.|$|E

5|$|The British recaptured the East Indiamen Ceylon, Charlton and United Kingdom, {{which the}} French were using as prison ships. Among the {{hundreds}} of prisoners released were {{the survivors of the}} Battle of Grand Port and the crews and passengers from the Indiamen captured over the previous year. Among the French prisoners, were discovered 12 deserters from the British Army or Royal Navy (at least 40 successfully passed as Frenchmen and were repatriated to France). These 12 were put on trial on their return to Britain: two were later hanged and five transported. Rewards were forthcoming, particularly for Bertie, who was made a baronet. This created a scandal when Admiral Drury accused Bertie of taking credit <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> others (principally Drury himself). Mauritius, unlike Île Bourbon, remained in British hands {{after the end of the}} war in 1814 and was retained as part of the British Empire until granted independence in 1968.|$|E
