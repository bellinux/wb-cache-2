40|$|Conventional wisdom {{holds that}} the punitive <b>damages</b> <b>class</b> action is {{susceptible}} not only to doctrinal restraints imposed on class actions but also to constitutional due process limitations placed on punitive damages. Thus, {{it would seem that}} the prospects for punitive <b>damages</b> <b>classes</b> are even grimmer than for class actions generally. This conventional picture misunderstands the role of punitive damages and, in particular, the relationship between class actions and punitive damages. It either ignores or underestimates the distinctly societal element of punitive damages, which makes them especially conducive to aggregate treatment. Furthermore, punitive <b>damages</b> <b>classes</b> offer a solution to the constitutional due process problem of juries awarding “classwide” damages in a single-plaintiff case. Courts’ conceptualization of punitive damages as either individualistic or societal dictates how they decide the certification question. My survey of recent case law reveals that courts taking the plaintiff-focused individualistic view of punitive damages tend to deny class certification, while courts embracing the defendant-focused societal view are more likely to certify a punitive <b>damages</b> <b>class,</b> all else being equal. Therefore, the viability of the punitive <b>damages</b> <b>class</b> depends upon the persuasiveness of the societal conception of punitive damages. Based on this empirical grounding, I discuss two possibilities for reform. First, state legislatures and courts could affirmatively define the collectivized, societal rationale for punitive damages. Such state legislative measures would likely withstand constitutional scrutiny under Philip Morris USA v. Williams, given the U. S. Supreme Court’s reaffirmation of the primacy of the state’s role in defining the legitimate purposes of punitive damages. Second, federal courts — in the absence of definitive guidance from authoritative sources on state substantive law — could consider the underlying societal rationale for punitive damages in the course of their certification decisions. To do so would not only be permitted, but indeed warranted, by the Rules Enabling Act...|$|R

50|$|Combat {{involves}} two dice rolls {{for each}} of the combatants: accuracy vs. evade and strike vs. defense. Accuracy determines whether the attack hits; for ranged attacks (firearms, crossbows, etc.) it also determines the damage. Strike determines the amount of damage done by melee attacks if the attack succeeds. Evade is used by the person being attacked to dodge the blow entirely; it is rolled against accuracy. If the attack hits, the target can roll defense to absorb {{some or all of the}} damage. Damage (accuracy, strike) and damage absorption (defense) are tiered. Each tier multiplies the base damage or armor soak class. A character wielding a firearm with <b>damage</b> <b>class</b> 6 who gets a tier 3 accuracy will deal 18 damage if it successfully hits.

40|$|The BP {{oil spill}} {{litigation}} and subsequent settlements {{provide an opportunity}} to explore a novel societal economic deterrence rationale for classwide supra-compensatory damages. Judge Jack Weinstein was a pioneer in the field of punitive <b>damages</b> <b>class</b> certification. In In re Simon II, he certified a nationwide punitive-damages-only class in a multijurisdiction, multidefendant tobacco lawsuit. Using Judge Weinstein’s innovations in In re Simon II as an analytical lens, the Article evaluates the future prospects for classwide punitive damages claims. Specifically, the Article considers how private litigants might adopt a societal damages approach in negotiating and achieving class action settlements. Class action settlements readily accommodate the “public law” dimension of societal damages, as demonstrated by the classwide punitive damages settlement with BP’s co-defendant Halliburton. Indeed, on closer inspection, even the BP compensatory <b>damages</b> <b>class</b> settlement has a surrounding aura of societal damages. For even that ostensibly purely compensatory arrangement included an unusual (and mostly overlooked) feature: a provision for supra-compensatory multipliers applicable to certain claimants. This Article advances the new idea that these supra-compensatory multipliers are a form of classwide societal damages embedded within the settlement, and, in turn, a potential blueprint for nascent punitive <b>damages</b> <b>classes</b> of the future...|$|R

30|$|We apply our window {{detection}} system to rectified {{images of the}} chosen structures’ facades to determine their opening-ratios. Since we presuppose a facade completely filling the image we infer the opening-ratio of a facade from the ratio of detection areas to the image area. Similar to the evaluation in section “Results” for each facade, we provide a distribution of opening-ratios over the classification threshold additionally to the particular responses of our system {{in case of a}} calibrated classifier. As the calibrated classifier misses some windows but yields reasonably low false positives rates its results can be interpreted as the minimum opening-ratio a facade definitely possesses. By means of the distribution we identify a range within which the actual opening-ratio lies. This facilitates the categorization of facades into their most probable <b>damage</b> <b>class.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{union of}} punitive <b>damages</b> and <b>class</b> actions can be aptly {{described}} with Samuel Johnson’s famous quotation regarding marriage: “The triumph of hope over experience. ” By most conventional wisdom, {{there is little}} future for plaintiffs or defendants who desire to resolve punitive damages claims globally using the procedural vehicle of a class action. From a conceptual perspective, however, there are circumstances under which the union could function. This Article explores those possibilities, not {{in the spirit of}} normative support, but in the spirit of exploring theories that may have some prospective vitality. Notwithstanding the chilly reception that punitive <b>damages</b> <b>class</b> actions have received from appellate courts, there are several approaches at the micro and macro levels of analysis suggesting that “hope” is still persistent. By disaggregating the United States Supreme Court punitive damages jurisprudence, it is possible to identify a limited number of factual scenarios where a class action for punitive damages could be successful. These micro-level observations can constitute a road map for navigating the current seemingly insurmountable barriers that have severely limited the use of class actions in punitive damages claims. At the macro level, there are two observations {{that could lead to a}} revision of punitive <b>damages</b> <b>class</b> actions: the seemingly undaunted, pragmatic desire on the part of trial judges to resolve similar cases collectively, and the powerful support for an economic vision of punitive damages that leads inevitably to a global, rather than individual, procedural approach...|$|R

40|$|Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI) multi-spectral and {{panchromatic}} {{images were}} acquired in July 1992 over two forest plots infested by the balsam woolly adelgid (Adelges piceae) in western Newfoundland. A panchromatic image (pixel size approximately 25 cm) {{was used as}} a georeference for the coarser resolution multi-spectral data which were resampled to 1 m and 0. 5 m, then carefully tied to a detailed plot plan showing the locations of 159 trees. Field observations for each of these trees included a ranking for adelgid <b>damage</b> <b>class</b> according to a standard Forest Insect and Disease Survey (FIDS) scheme. A discriminant analysis of the multi-spectral CASI imagery (together with semi-variance parameters and texture derivations) indicated that damage caused by the balsam woolly adelgid on balsam fir (Abies balsamea) trees could be detected and separated into severity classes with a range of accuracy between 40 - 76 per cent depending on the classification scheme and the type of remote sensing variables available to perform discrimination. The 'best' discriminant results obtained were based on a single pixel sample extracted from a 0. 5 m multi-spectral image comprised of six bands centred on 454, 550, 590, 662, 836, and 895 nm.

30|$|Many seismic {{assessment}} {{methods for}} buildings {{have been developed}} in recent years (ATC 1996; FEMA 1998, 2000); however, those methods seldom mention re-evaluating the seismic residual of earthquake-damaged buildings. Di Ludovico et al. (2013) proposed the experiment-based expressions of modification factors for stiffness, strength and displacement capacity {{as a function of}} the rotational ductility demand. Additionally, the proposed expressions can be introduced to modify the moment-rotation plastic hinges of RC columns in the buildings of Mediterranean regions with design characteristics non-conforming to present-day seismic provisions. However, how to apply the modification factors for stiffness, strength and displacement capacity in the seismic performance assessment is not mentioned clearly in the paper. The guidelines developed by JBDPA (2001, 2015) for evaluating the residual seismic performance of earthquake-damaged buildings can be used to determine the <b>damage</b> <b>class</b> of a building; however, the procedure is only suitable for the preliminary seismic performance assessment. Restated, a preliminary seismic performance assessment does not provide sufficient data for engineers or users to make decisions on earthquake-damaged buildings. Additionally, for the detailed seismic performance assessment of low-rise RC building structures in Taiwan, engineers need to use the nonlinear static analysis method, which is different with the method proposed in the JBDPA guidelines (2001, 2015). Therefore, a post-earthquake detailed assessment method of seismic performance is needed to evaluate the residual seismic performance of an earthquake-damaged RC building for the post-earthquake maintenance strategy.|$|E
40|$|Upon {{inoculation}} into AKR mice, mink cell focus-forming {{murine leukemia}} virus (MCF MLV) accelerates thymic lymphoma formation. During the preleukemic phase of disease, we observed the induction of apoptosis in thymic lymphocytes. A similar induction of apoptosis was observed for cultured mink epithelial cells after MCF 13 MLV infection. In this study, the relevance of viral pathogenicity to cell killing was determined by testing the susceptibility of various cell types from different species to lymphomagenic MLVs. We observed that the cytopathic effect of lymphomagenic MLVs was restricted to mink cells. Southern blot analysis of MLV-infected cells revealed an accumulation of the linear form of unintegrated viral DNA, particularly in mink cells after MCF 13 MLV infection. Thus, a strong correlation was observed between viral superinfection, which re-sults in the accumulation of high levels of unintegrated viral DNA, and cell killing. Immunoblot analysis for MCF 13 MLV-infected mink epithelial cells did not show {{a significant change in}} total p 53 levels or its phos-phorylated form at Ser- 15 compared with that in mock-treated cells. Moreover, a time course analysis for mink epithelial cells infected with MCF 13 MLV did not reveal mitochondrial depolarization or a significant change in Bax levels.
