25|$|On {{the day of}} Sachiko's {{birth and}} death, the curse on her weakens and she gets 24 hours to {{celebrate}} her birthday as someone closer to the girl she was before her death. She uses the timeloops as established in Corpse Party: Book of Shadows to force all survivors at that point to participate in activities she has set up. Given it's <b>either</b> <b>that</b> <b>or</b> die horribly again, something all are aware that they've already experienced but can't remember in full, they go along with her demands. The game features almost all characters from the previous games and some new ones. While a pseudo-horror spin-off at best, {{it is part of}} the storyline, setting up a few details to prepare for Corpse Party: Blood Drive.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} {{was shot at}} the end of May 2010, in Málaga, Spain and later premiered 26 June on the group's {{official}} website. Of the video shoot, the group said [...] "Every time we'd turned round, our dresses would get stuck to our legs! That was a nightmare. It was <b>either</b> <b>that</b> <b>or</b> slipping over." [...] The video was shot by director Chris Cottam.|$|E

500|$|Dowd, however, had two {{problems}} during the recording. [...] "What'd I Say" [...] lasted over {{seven and a}} half minutes when the normal length of radio-played songs was around two and a half minutes. Furthermore, although the lyrics were not obscene, the sounds Charles and the Raelettes made in their calls and responses during the song worried Dowd and the producers. A previous recording called [...] "Money Honey" [...] by Clyde McPhatter had been banned in Georgia and Ahmet Ertegun and Wexler released McPhatter's song despite the ban, risking arrest. Ray Charles was aware of the controversy in [...] "What'd I Say": [...] "I'm not one to interpret my own songs, but if you can't figure out 'What I Say', then something's wrong. <b>Either</b> <b>that,</b> <b>or</b> you're not accustomed to the sweet sounds of love." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1966, Wilson {{said that}} the highest note he could sing was D5. Starting with the 1970 {{sessions}} for the Surf's Up album, engineer Stephen Desper remembers the emerging corrosive effects of Wilson's incessant chain smoking and cocaine use: [...] "He could still do falsettos and stuff, but he'd need Carl to help him. <b>Either</b> <b>that</b> <b>or</b> I'd modify the tape speed-wise to make it artificially higher, so it sounded like the old days." ...|$|E
2500|$|When some of {{the iconic}} hills were asphalted, cycling fans and {{organizers}} were alarmed by the disappearance of cobbles. Organizer Van Wijnendaele could no longer rely {{on many of the}} traditional roads as they were not difficult enough. His staff began searching for alleys and footpaths in maps and talked to people in bars who knew the local roads. [...] "It was <b>either</b> <b>that</b> <b>or</b> risk the race ending in a mass sprint, and that's the last thing organizers wanted," [...] said Van Laere. Most back roads {{happened to be in the}} low hills between Ronse and Geraardsbergen, the region that became the heart of the race.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the time}} of the picture's release, Laughlin's company, Billy Jack Enterprises, had plans for a new Montessori school funded by his own foundation, a record label, an investigative magazine, books, a {{distribution}} company and more message-laden movies, including a special subsidiary to produce films for children. He told People magazine at the time, [...] "Three years from today, we'll be the new United Artists. <b>Either</b> <b>that,</b> <b>or</b> we'll be out on our butt on the street." [...] In 1976, Laughlin announced that he was more than $7million in debt and blamed the financial troubles on unethical behavior by Warner Bros. Pictures, which he said had illegally sold the television rights to his films.|$|E
2500|$|Back in Seattle {{the battle}} {{continued}} throughout the fall. Blind orator J.B. Osborne was arrested twice more attempting to speak, running his arrest count to 3, and the Seattle Socialists {{and their supporters}} paying out $270 in fines by {{the first week of}} October. Further expense was in the offing, as three of Osborne's Police Court cases were headed for appeal by jury trial in County Court. The party telegraphed its next move, publishing in dark type in the pages of The Socialist an appeal for [...] "Volunteers for Jail." [...] "Spring bed Socialism is past in Seattle," [...] the announcement declared: [...] "It means cement floor in jail from now on. <b>Either</b> <b>that</b> <b>or</b> cowardly surrender." [...] Civil disobedience was in the wind.|$|E
2500|$|It {{is claimed}} that Shane Warne invented {{this type of}} delivery. However, this is inaccurate. The Australian spinner Peter Philpott used the {{technique}} in the 1960s, calling it simply an orthodox backspinner, while Australian all - rounder and captain Richie Benaud used what he called his 'sliding topspinner' which appears again to have been similar. [...] Since he was taught the technique by Doug Ring, {{it may be more}} accurate to suggest that Ring is the originator. [...] <b>Either</b> <b>that,</b> <b>or</b> the ball is one of those deliveries with no easily identifiable point of origin. However Shane Warne's use of the delivery in the 2005 Ashes brought the variation once more into the public consciousness. His dismissal of Ian Bell lbw with the delivery was a classic piece of spin bowling; Bell played for the turn of a normal leg break, but the delivery skidded straight into his front pad without turning.|$|E

2500|$|Because {{the drums}} were {{recorded}} {{prior to the}} guitars, Bart had to write his guitar riffs {{so that they would}} compliment the drums and not vice versa. Bart elaborated, [...] "Following the September sessions I went back to work out the harmonies and write {{a whole new set of}} guitars trying to see them from a different point of view. The main challenge was to stay within the parameters of the drums - <b>either</b> <b>that</b> <b>or</b> we would have to re-record them again. So I had to be very creative to make the songs interesting without introducing new sections or tempo changes. This is why there are so many harmonies and counter melodies. It was challenging - often I would just jam to the recorded tracks for a long time trying to find a different vibe then that already recorded... this is best apparent on To the Bitter End or Tunnel Effect. If you listen to both guitars, they're doing widely different things yet compliment each other really well." ...|$|E
