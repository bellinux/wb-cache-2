5|$|A plain {{soldier and}} {{business}} man. I am no politician, nor have I {{any desire to}} be one. In {{the course of my}} commercial career it has been my fate to have had much experience of politicians and their ways. What <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> in the course of that experience has given me little respect either for the professional politician or his methods. I am desirous of seeing this country governed in the ways of clear common sense and good sound business principles, and I think that desire of mine is heartily share by {{the vast majority of the}} population.|$|E
5|$|The Brooksville Tunnel is {{the most}} {{difficult}} work of the kind, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> any record of: at the Western entrance, the pressure of the big slides actually causes the bottom to surge up, as is sometime the case in coal mines; in view of the sliding tendency and immense pressure of this ground, it will be advisable to enter on that side with an invested arch to prevent a collapse...This work is vastly more difficult than the Greenwood Tunnel was, though it was not, by any means, an easy safe job.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> it--and, after a moment's doubt, <b>I</b> said <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> it.|$|R
60|$|But <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen.</b> Yes; <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> {{more than}} that. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> Captain West's face a {{transparent}} white, while his eyelids fluttered down {{and his lips}} moved noiselessly. Then the eyelids raised, the lips set again with their habitual discipline, and the colour slowly returned to his face. It {{was as if he}} had been away for a time and just returned. But <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen,</b> and guessed her secret.|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{never before}} <b>seen</b> Agnes cry. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> {{tears in her}} eyes when <b>I</b> <b>had</b> brought new honours home from school, and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> them there when we last spoke about her father, and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> her turn her gentle head aside when we took leave of one another; but <b>I</b> <b>had</b> never <b>seen</b> her grieve like this. It made me so sorry that I could only say, in a foolish, {{helpless}} manner, 'Pray, Agnes, don't! Don't, my dear sister!' ...|$|R
5|$|The rest of {{this edition}} I have not read, but, from the little that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen,</b> I think it not {{dangerous}} to declare that, in my opinion, its pomp recommends it more than its accuracy. There is no distinction made between the ancient reading, and the innovations of the editor; {{there is no reason}} given for any of the alterations which are made; the emendations of former editions are adopted without any acknowledgement, and few of the difficulties are removed which have hitherto embarrassed the readers of Shakespeare.|$|E
25|$|Richie Benaud has a fine team; he {{inspired}} them in {{the field}} and the team brought off some wonderful catches, and generally I thought Australia's out-cricket was some of the best <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen.</b>|$|E
25|$|June 12.— After we had dined with Mr. Pageatt, {{where we}} had a neat dinner and strawberries, longest that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen,</b> {{we went to a}} house called Dole-hoof, where we saw the {{pictures}} made in wax most liveyly...|$|E
60|$|I did not argue. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> the {{mechanism}} of the primitive fighting beast, and I was as strongly impressed as if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> the engines of a great battleship or Atlantic liner.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> {{moonlight}} and daylight together before, but <b>I</b> <b>had</b> not <b>seen</b> {{daylight and}} black night elbow to elbow before. At least <b>I</b> <b>had</b> not <b>seen</b> the daylight resting upon an object sufficiently close at hand, before, {{to make the}} contrast startling and at war with nature.|$|R
6000|$|Well {{might he}} ask. That name--Pagliano--had stirred my memory so violently, {{that of a}} sudden as in a flash <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> again the strange vision that visited my delirium; <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> again the {{inviting}} eyes, the beckoning hands, and heard again the gentle voice saying, [...] "Come to Pagliano! Come soon!" ...|$|R
25|$|The confession-book, I suppose, has disappeared. It is {{twenty years}} since <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> one. As a boy I told some {{inquisitive}} owner what was my favourite food (porridge, I fancy), my favourite hero {{in real life}} and in fiction, my favourite virtue in woman, and so forth.|$|E
25|$|I met Laughton only once, at a party. Of all {{the actors}} <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen,</b> I {{think he would}} have come closest to doing Nero Wolfe perfectly. A motion picture {{producer}} (I forget who) asked him to do a series of Nero Wolfe movies, and he had said he would agree to do one but would not commit himself to a series.|$|E
25|$|To watch every {{ball of the}} 1974/75 Ashes {{battle was}} to see {{excitement}} and controversy at its height {{in the game of}} cricket: an Australian fast-bowling pair to rank with the greatest ever to pull on a pair of boots, catching the equal or better of anything <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> in Test cricket, batting and captaincy to match anything Australian sides have produced since the war.|$|E
60|$|Murder was {{a common}} word in those days, but <b>I</b> <b>had</b> not at that time grasped its meaning; <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> no murder done, nor any person killed in a fight; I only knew {{that it must be}} {{something}} wicked and horrible. Nevertheless, the shock <b>I</b> <b>had</b> received passed away in the course of that first morning in a new world; but what <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> in the barn was not forgotten: the image of that young man tied to the post, his bent head and downward gaze, and ghastly face shaded by lank black hair, is as plain to me now as if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> him but yesterday.|$|R
60|$|He smiled, more sweetly and pleasantly than <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> {{him smile}} yet.|$|R
60|$|Eve flashed upon me {{the first}} angry glance <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> from her.|$|R
25|$|Lindwall's drag of {{his right}} foot has often brought him under the fire of those who claimed that he was over the line before he {{released}} the ball...As {{a matter of fact}} Ray's right foot is well behind the crease when he starts to bring his arm over, but he releases the ball later in his swing than any other bowler <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen.</b>|$|E
25|$|In one {{department}} {{however the}} 1974–75 combination excelled any other that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen.</b> They {{were the best}} fielding combination I have ever witnessed on the cricket field... everyone chased like demons, caught like angels, and, unfortunately, occasionally swore like troopers. Looking back at the Perth Test , I still {{find it difficult to}} believe that some of the catches that were taken were even in the bounds of possibility.|$|E
25|$|Sivanath Sastri wrote {{extensively}} {{throughout his}} life. Amongst his publications are – History of the Brahmo Samaj, New Dispensation and the Sadharan Brahmo Samaj, Men <b>I</b> <b>Have</b> <b>Seen,</b> The Mission of the Brahmo Samaj, Theistic Churches in India, Puspamalya (poetry), Mejo Bou (novel), Jatived, Pushpanjali (poetry), Nirbasiter Bilap (poetry), Pushpamala (poetry), Himadrikusum (poetry), Chhayamoyee Parinay, Jugantar (novel), Nayantara (novel), Upakatha, Bidhabar Chhele,Raghubansa (English and Bengali translation of Kalidasa), Dharmajibon, Ramtanu Lahiri O Tatkalin Bangasamaj, Atmacharit, Atmapariksha, Englander Diary, and Chhotoder Galpo.|$|E
60|$|Although at {{that time}} <b>I</b> <b>had</b> never <b>seen</b> a gorilla in the flesh, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> a {{coloured}} picture of the brute, and if that picture had been photographed on the flower the likeness {{could not have been}} more perfect.|$|R
60|$|And {{the same}} man <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> upon the dock in Brooklyn came forward.|$|R
60|$|It was {{a startling}} likeness, and {{necessarily}} had a startling look. The painter hadn't made the scar, but I made it; {{and there it}} was, coming and going; now confined to the upper lip as <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> it at dinner, and now showing the whole extent of the wound inflicted by the hammer, as <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> it when she was passionate.|$|R
25|$|Now {{and then}} I am asked by colleagues, students, and journalists: who, in my opinion, {{are the most}} respectable critics of my {{position}} on the race-IQ issue? The name James R. Flynn {{is by far the}} first that comes to mind. His book, Race, IQ and Jensen (1980), is a distinguished contribution to the literature on this topic, and, among the critiques <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> of my position, is virtually in a class by itself for objectivity, thoroughness, and scholarly integrity.|$|E
25|$|Brown and Bedser {{deserved}} {{at least}} two day's rest – but the whole English side {{was in and out}} while the sun was still shining. One of the saddest sights <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> on a cricket field was the weary Bedser trudging out to bat less than two hours after his marathon bowling effort...Bailey batted one handed and Wright did not bat. It was a sickening blow for the Englishmen, to lose by an innings after such heroic efforts by the bowlers, but Iverson was just too good.|$|E
25|$|I {{have found}} that in the {{composition}} of the human body as compared with the bodies of animals, the organs of sense are duller and coarser... <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> in the Lion tribe that the sense of smell is connected with part of the substance of the brain which comes down the nostrils, which form a spacious receptacle for the sense of smell, which enters by a great number of cartilaginous vesicles with several passages leading up to where the brain, as before said, comes down.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> both, {{looking at}} us round the stem of a cocoa-nut tree, where the moon struck them. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> that Sambo Pilot, with one hand laid on the stem of the tree, drawing {{them back into the}} heavy shadow. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> their naked {{cutlasses}} twinkle and shine, like bits of the moonshine in the water that had got blown ashore among the trees by the light wind. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> it all, in a moment. And I saw in a moment (as any man would), that the signalled move of the pirates on the mainland was a plot and a feint; that the leak had been made to disable the sloop; that the boats had been tempted away, to leave the Island unprotected; that the pirates had landed by some secreted way at the back; and that Christian George King was a double-dyed traitor, and a most infernal villain.|$|R
60|$|After the {{excitement}} was over, Runi, who had maintained a dignified calm, made some roundabout remarks, apparently with {{the object of}} eliciting an account of what <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> and heard in the forest of evil fame. I replied carelessly that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> a great many birds and monkeys--monkeys so tame that <b>I</b> might <b>have</b> procured one if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> had a blow-pipe, {{in spite of my}} never having practiced shooting with that weapon.|$|R
60|$|I {{perceived}} but one {{change in}} the Lodger's miserable room, since <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> it last.|$|R
25|$|Congratulations to Australia, {{they were}} the better team...I felt that with Laker not fit we had to gamble on the first morning. I thought {{this was the best}} way to win the match, but it did not come off. Richie Benaud has a fine team; he {{inspired}} them in the field and the team brought off some wonderful catches, and generally I thought Australia's out-cricket was some of the best <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen.</b> We never got the starts we would have liked and injuries on the tour generally affected the batting, but I have no excuses to offer.|$|E
25|$|Students {{began to}} prepare for {{defensive}} operations in other institutions. They put on a much stronger resistance when {{the police and the}} army tried to occupy the Polytechnic campuses of Zacatenco and Santo Tomas. The battle lasted from 17:00 hours on September 23 to the early hours of September 24. The physician Justo Igor de León Loyola wrote in his book, La Noche de Santo Tomás (Santo Tomas' night): Today <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> bloodier fights, unequal battles: Both sides are armed... but what a difference in the weapons, handguns caliber 22 against military rifles M-1, bazookas against Molotov bombs.|$|E
25|$|Race kallaura, Moore. Of {{this form}} <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> {{only a few}} specimens. Judging by the types, which {{are now in the}} {{collection}} of the British Museum, it differs less from the typical form than do any of the other races. As in N. soma, the markings are small and narrow; the subbasal band of the hindwing is, however, attenuated at each end, and not of even width, underside: ground colour very much paler and somewhat ochraceous, the anterior and posterior sets of spots of the discal series closer together respectively; the postdiscal band on the hindwing equal in width to the subbasal band. Recorded only so far from Travancore.|$|E
60|$|Now she laughed; it was {{the first}} time <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> her laugh for several moons.|$|R
60|$|The visitor {{looked a}} little surprised, as <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> many do, at my father's accent.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> it but a {{few days}} before, and could not help telling them of the fancy <b>I</b> <b>had</b> about it.|$|R
