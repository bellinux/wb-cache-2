30|$|The optimal {{solution}} search using the FWA algorithm is a sequential {{process in which}} the explosion of the <b>firework</b> is followed by selection of sparks for the next explosion based on the number and distance between sparks associated with the <b>firework</b> explosion. The good <b>firework</b> selected for next round of explosion denotes the feasible optimal location of the optimization problem in the search space defined. The characteristics of the FWA which aid in selection of sparks for the next generation are given below.|$|R

5|$|The {{recognised}} metalloids {{have either}} pyrotechnic applications or associated properties. Boron and silicon are commonly encountered; they act somewhat like metal fuels. Boron {{is used in}} pyrotechnic initiator compositions (for igniting other hard-to-start compositions), and in delay compositions that burn at a constant rate. Boron carbide {{has been identified as}} a possible replacement for more toxic barium or hexachloroethane mixtures in smoke munitions, signal flares and <b>fireworks.</b> Silicon, like boron, is a component of initiator and delay mixtures. Doped germanium can act as a variable speed thermite fuel. Arsenic trisulfide As2S3 was used in old naval signal lights; in <b>fireworks</b> to make white stars; in yellow smoke screen mixtures; and in initiator compositions. Antimony trisulfide Sb2S3 is found in white-light <b>fireworks</b> and in flash and sound mixtures. Tellurium has been used in delay mixtures and in blasting cap initiator compositions.|$|E
