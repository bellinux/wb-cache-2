40|$|AstroStat is an easy-to-use {{tool for}} {{performing}} statistical analysis on data. It {{has been designed}} to be compatible with Virtual Observatory (VO) standards thus enabling it to {{become an integral part of}} the currently available collection of VO tools. A user can load data in a variety of formats into AstroStat and perform various statistical tests using a menu driven interface. Behind the scenes, all analyses are done using the public domain statistical software—R and the output returned is presented in a neatly <b>formatted</b> <b>form</b> to the user. The analyses performable include exploratory tests, visualizations, distribution fitting, correlation & causation, hypothesis testing, multivariate analysis and clustering. The tool is available in two versions with identical interface and features—as a web service that can be run using any standard browser and as an offline application. AstroStat will provide an easy-to-use interface which can allow for both fetching data and performing power statistical analysis on them...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- Problem {{tracking}} {{in large}} software systems {{is a time}} consuming and difficult task. To do the Root-Cause-Analysis (RCA) of an issue occurred in a system, typically the concerned person {{has to go through}} different log files and event data. The complexity and size of the logs makes it often difficult for human operators and administrators to track the problem and perform root cause analysis. A big challenge in this area is to provide the necessary tools and techniques for the user to focus on specific parts of the data logs thus reducing the complexity of the analysis process. So in this paper, a model is proposed to tackle this issue. A better analysis of log files can be done, if aimed logs are specified in unique format and filtered to focus on specific logs so that flow of events or faults can be tracked. More specifically, the proposed framework provides simplified interface to user by displaying logs of specified type in <b>formatted</b> <b>form</b> in chronological order in single pane...|$|E

This paper reports an investigation of potential gender related effects on sixth-graders of an explicitly stated problem-solving plan. Two versions of the test were given: the <b>formatted</b> <b>form,</b> containing the seven steps of a problem-solving plan on each of the pages, with space for student work; and the unformatted form, containing only the word problems. Three classes of students (n= 73) were administered the formatted test first, followed by the unformatted version. The remaining three classes of students (n= 82) were administered the unformatted version first, followed by the formatted version. Females and males did equally well on both forms of a four-item problem-solving test. Students scored significantly higher on posttests that included the problem-solving plan. It was concluded that females benefited from free exploration of problem situations followed by an organized exploration. Contains 24 references.

40|$|Semantic data {{modelling}} {{has been a}} traditional abstract way of representing data and relationships between data for database systems. Recently database designers and developers have been looking to object oriented modelling methods which incorporate the modelling of behaviour as well as data and their relationships. Databases {{can also be considered}} to be functional structures. All operations on databases are functional in that they return values. Transaction and update operations return {{a new version of the}} database; queries return values contained in the database; and reports return values from the database in some strictly <b>formatted</b> <b>form.</b> This thesis firstly develops an extended version of the Entity-Relationship model, called the Entity-Relationship-Object model (ERO model) that incorporates object oriented concepts including behaviour. Secondly, a methodology is defined for mapping this model directly to the functional.. programming language, Haskell, where all Entity and Relationship objects are implemented as abstract data types and all attributes and methods are implemented as functions. The modularity and polymorphism of the proposed models and their implementation allow for easy schema extension and modification. Lazy evaluation in the implementation allows for a simple form of persistent data store...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} the determination of the incidence of culture-proven postoperative endophthalmitis and probable sources of infection. Materials and Methods: It was a prospective study on the microbiology, incidence and probable sources of infection in patients with postoperative infectious endophthalmitis carried out in a tertiary care eye hospital. Consecutive patients diagnosed with postoperative infectious endophthalmitis during the years 2000 - 2007 were investigated for the causative infective agent and possible sources of infection. The surgical data and microbiological data including the investigations performed to trace the source were recorded in a specific <b>formatted</b> <b>form</b> and were gathered and compiled for analysis. Results: Data of analysis showed that 98 (0. 042 &#x 0025;) out of 2, 31, 259 patients who underwent intra-ocular surgery developed infectious endophthalmitis. Among these, 70 (0. 053 &#x 0025;) occurred after cataract, 10 (0. 5 &#x 0025;) after penetrating keratoplasty (PK) and 18 (0. 018 &#x 0025;) following other types of intra-ocular surgeries. The predominant infectious agents isolated were bacteria (89. 7 &#x 0025;), with equal proportions of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Polymicrobial infection was noted in four and fungi in seven patients. Occurrence of postoperative endophthalmitis was sporadic and not related to any specific part of period in a year. Sources of infection were donor corneal rim in six post-PK patients and phaco probe in one who had postphacoemulsification endophthalmitis Conclusions: Overall incidence of postoperative endophthalmitis over an 8 -year period was quite low. The sources of infection could be established in six post-PK endophthalmitis patients and in a postcataract surgery...|$|E

40|$|Competence tests within {{large-scale}} assessments usually contain various task formats {{to measure}} the participants’ knowledge. Two response formats that are frequently used are simple multiple choice (MC) items and complex multiple choice (CMC) items. Whereas simple MC items comprise a number of response options with one being correct, CMC items consist of several dichotomous true-false subtasks. When incorporating these response formats in a scaling model, they are mostly assumed to be unidimensional. In empirical studies different empirical and theoretical schemes of weighting CMC items in relation to MC items have been applied to construct the overall competence score. However, the dimensionality of the two response formats and the different weighting schemes have only rarely been evaluated. The present study, thus, addressed two questions of particular importance when implementing MC and CMC items in a scaling model: Do the different response <b>formats</b> <b>form</b> a unidimensional construct and, if so, which of the weighting schemes considered for MC and CMC items appropriately models the empirical competence data? Using data of the National Educational Panel Study, we analyzed scientific literacy tests embedding MC and CMC items. We cross-validated the findings on another competence domain and on another large-scale assessment. The analyses revealed that the different response <b>formats</b> <b>form</b> a unidimensional measure across contents and studies. Additionally, the a priori weighting scheme of one point for MC items and half points for each subtask of CMC items best modeled the response formats’ impact on the competence score and resembled the empirical competence data well. ...|$|R
