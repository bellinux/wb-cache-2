5|$|Reagan's {{campaign}} {{relied on}} a strategy crafted by campaign manager John Sears of winning a few primaries early to damage the inevitability of Ford's likely nomination. Reagan won North Carolina, Texas, and California, but the strategy failed, as he ended up losing New Hampshire, Florida, and his native Illinois. The Texas campaign lent renewed hope to Reagan, when <b>he</b> <b>swept</b> all 96 delegates chosen in the May 1 primary, with four more awaiting at the state convention. Much {{of the credit for}} that victory came from the work of three co-chairmen, including Ernest Angelo, the mayor of Midland, and Ray Barnhart of Houston, whom Reagan as President would appoint in 1981 as director of the Federal Highway Administration.|$|E
5|$|Born in Hodgenville, Kentucky, Lincoln {{grew up on}} {{the western}} {{frontier}} in Kentucky and Indiana. Largely self-educated, he became a lawyer in Illinois, a Whig Party leader, and was elected to the Illinois House of Representatives, in which he served for eight years. Elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1846, Lincoln promoted rapid modernization of the economy and opposed the Mexican–American War. After a single term, he returned to Illinois and resumed his successful law practice. Reentering politics in 1854, he became a leader in building the new Republican Party, which had a statewide majority in Illinois. As part of the 1858 campaign for US Senator from Illinois, Lincoln took part in a series of highly publicized debates with his opponent and rival, Democrat Stephen A. Douglas; Lincoln spoke out against the expansion of slavery, but lost the race to Douglas. In 1860, Lincoln secured the Republican Party presidential nomination as a moderate from a swing state, though most delegates originally favored other candidates. Though he gained very little support in the slaveholding states of the South, <b>he</b> <b>swept</b> the North and was elected president in 1860.|$|E

25|$|Bush {{performed}} {{very strongly}} among suburban voters, perhaps owing {{to his campaign}} themes of law and order, punctuated by his criticisms of the Massachusetts furlough program. This was a boon in several swing states. In Illinois, Bush won 69% in DuPage County and 63% in Lake County, suburban areas which adjoin Chicago's Cook County. In Pennsylvania, <b>he</b> <b>swept</b> the group of suburban counties that surround Philadelphia, including Bucks, Delaware, Chester, and Montgomery. Bush also won most of the counties in Maryland. New Jersey, known at the time for its many suburban voters and its moderate Republicanism, went easily for Bush.|$|E
25|$|In late 1953, Kramer, then a {{temporarily}} retired player (due to {{his back}} troubles), signed Gonzales (a seven-year contract) {{to play in a}} 1954 US tour also featuring Pancho Segura, Frank Sedgman and Donald Budge (the latter being replaced in March 1954 by Carl Earn for the last weeks of the tour). In the subsequent matches Gonzales beat Segura 30-21 and Sedgman by the same score. After this tour Gonzales won the U.S. Pro where all the best, except Pails, were present. Then the American played in a Far East tour (September–October 1954). He barely won over Segura and Kramer, who made his come-back in singles after a 14-month retirement. Then Gonzales had major success: <b>he</b> <b>swept</b> the Australian Tour in November–December 1954 by beating Sedgman 16-9, McGregor 15-0, and Segura, 4-2. Although Pancho was beaten by the Australian Pro Pails in the last competition of the year, Gonzales had clearly established himself as the top player in the world in 1954.|$|E
25|$|James Wyatt was an {{architect}} who often employed the neo-classical style, but at Wilton for reasons {{known only to}} architect and client he used the Gothic style. Since {{the beginning of the}} 20th century his work at Wilton has been condemned by most architectural commentators. The negative points of his 'improvements' to modern eyes are that <b>he</b> <b>swept</b> away the Holbein porch, reducing it to a mere garden ornament, replacing it with a new entrance and forecourt. This entrance forecourt created was entered through an 'arc de triumph' which had been created as an entrance to Wilton's park by Sir William Chambers circa 1755. The forecourt was bounded by the house on one side, with wings of fake doors and windows extending to form the court, all accessed by Chambers's repositioned arch, crowned by a copy of the life-size equestrian statue of Marcus Aurelius. While not altogether displeasing as an entrance to a country house, the impression created is more of a hunting estate in Northern France or Germany.|$|E

25|$|In October 1834, {{he entered}} {{as a student}} at St Bartholomew's Hospital, in London. Here he is noted to have {{described}} the first journal club. Medical students in those days were left very much to themselves; there was no close supervision of their work, but Paget probably gained rather than lost by having to fight his own way. <b>He</b> <b>swept</b> the board of prizes in 1835, and again in 1836; in his first winter session, he discovered the pathogen for trichinosis, a parasitic disease caused by Trichinella spiralis, a minute roundworm that infests the muscles of the human body, and which is usually acquired by eating infected pork. In May 1836, he passed his examination at the Royal College of Surgeons, and became qualified to practice. The next seven years (1836–1843) were spent in London lodgings, and were a time of poverty, for he made only 15 pounds a year by practice, and his father, having failed in business, could not give him any help. He managed to keep himself by writing for the medical journals, and preparing the catalogues of the hospital museum and of the pathological museum of the Royal College of Surgeons. In 1836, he had been made curator of the hospital museum, and in 1838, demonstrator of morbid anatomy at the hospital, but his advancement there was hindered by the privileges of the hospital apprentices, and because he had been too poor to afford a house-surgeoncy, or even a dressership.|$|E
25|$|A week later, at the {{beginning}} of March, Stevenage won their second away game on the bounce; beating Eastbourne Borough 60. Captain Mark Roberts gave Stevenage the lead just before the break, following a well-worked free-kick involving both Joel Byrom and Scott Laird. After the interval, Stevenage doubled their lead when David Bridges headed in Joel Byrom's cross. It was three shortly after following a mistake from Eastbourne goalkeeper Danny Knowles, Chris Beardsley blocked the goalkeepers clearance and slid the ball into an empty net. It got worse for the home side ten minutes from time when Beardsley chased a long through ball and was hauled down by Darren Baker just inside the area - the defender being shown a straight red. Substitute Mitchell Cole slotted the penalty home, before adding another after good work from Eddie Odhiambo. Cole completed his hat-trick moments later slotting home Stacy Long's through ball. A third successive victory followed in a 20 win at home to Crawley Town. In a tight game, Stevenage took the lead just after the interval thanks to a rasping effort from Michael Bostwick after a well-worked corner. A second goal came deep into injury-time, Chris Beardsley countering and setting up Lee Boylan to slide the ball into the net. Three days later, Stevenage beat Barrow 40 to ensure a fourth consecutive win. In a tight first half, the home side took the lead through Yemi Odubade. Borough doubled their lead shortly before the interval; left-back Scott Laird firing the ball home. Odubade then scored his second after countering a Barrow corner, and subsequently completed his hat-trick late on with an effort drilled high into the net. Stevenage recorded their fifth straight win, beating Histon 10 at Broadhall Way. Jon Ashton scored the only goal of the game when <b>he</b> <b>swept</b> home Stacy Long's corner.|$|E
25|$|Bill Lawry (52) and Bobby Simpson (38) {{weathered}} the early storm of Fred Trueman and Brian Statham, edging a few through the slips and Trueman bowling out-swingers which moved {{just past the}} edge of the bat. Len Coldwell (2/58) came on the bowl his in-swingers, off which the openers managed to steal a few singles, until he managed to move the ball the other way and caught the edge of Simpson's bat for a catch behind at 62/1. Norm O'Neill came in until lunch when Australia went in on 93/1 off 22 overs in two hours, a total somewhat less than 15 overs an hour promised by Ted Dexter {{at the start of the}} tour. After lunch Lawry edged a ball from Statham between the wicket-keeper Alan Smith and Tom Graveney at first slip, the ball cutting back after it hit the turf. O'Neill was caught by Graveney off Statham (1/83), distracted by the loud racing commentary on a radio in the stands, Neil Harvey was bowled by Coldwell for a duck and Lawry by Trueman (3/83) and Australia lost three wickets for 1 run to be left 112/4. The rest of the innings was a grinding match as Dexter rested his fast bowlers and set defensive field until they returned and while all of the remaining Australian batsmen reached double figures none reached 50. Fred Titmus took his new best Test figures of 4/43 as he wheeled his way through the afternoon, trapping Peter Burge lbw for 23 when <b>he</b> <b>swept</b> once too often and having Brian Booth caught by Ken Barrington for 27 trying to repeat a fine glance to leg. Alan Davidson (40) and Ken Mackay (49) added 73 for the eighth-wicket and Mackay and Richie Benaud (36) 52 runs into the next day as they tried to wear down the bowlers. Titmus dismissed them both in the end, Benaud sweeping the ball the Barrington and Mackay lbw after some deliberation by Umpire Smyth. Trueman removed Garth McKenzie (16) after a last-wicket stand of 22 and Australia were all out for 316 with Barry Jarman on 10 not out.|$|E

500|$|During Bomar's {{senior season}} (when {{he moved to}} halfback), the Commodores tied the Quantico Marines 13–13. Bomar, picking up a fumble, ran 84 yards for a touchdown. According to a {{newspaper}} account, [...] "It was Lynn Bomar's gigantic figure that broke up {{what looked like a}} Marine cakewalk. After receiving the kickoff, the Marines drove steadily to Vanderbilt's 10-yard line as Goettge repeatedly completed short passes. At the 10, Groves dropped back. The pass from center was low. He missed it. He reached for the ball. It trickled off his fingers. The Commodores were boring in. Wakefield was in there. Then Bomar came charging through. He picked up the ball and with a twist was out of Groves' grasp. He came out of the bunch with a long, charging run. Then he seemed a little undecided. One fleeting glance behind him and he struck out. Up came his free arm to brush off his headgear. His thin, yellow hair stood out. On <b>he</b> <b>swept</b> like a thundercloud of vengeance across the goal. Bedlam broke loose." [...] Captain and guard Tuck Kelly was injured during the game, making Bomar the interim captain two weeks later against the Georgia Bulldogs.|$|E
500|$|... "The Wind Cries Mary" [...] is {{the first}} ballad {{recorded}} by the Experience; Hendrix wrote the lyrics after an argument with his girlfriend, Kathy Etchingham, whose middle name is Mary. She explained: [...] "I smashed plates on the floor, [...] <b>he</b> <b>swept</b> them up. He locked me in the bathroom for absolutely ages and... eventually Chas's girlfriend Lotta let me out... I ran out to get a taxi and was standing under the traffic lights, and I had red hair and a red dress. I went back after I'd cooled down and he'd already written it." [...] The song featured a chord progression inspired by Curtis Mayfield and lyrics that reflected Hendrix's admiration of Bob Dylan. [...] "Stone Free" [...] expressed Hendrix's desire to preserve his personal freedom, demurring the concepts of conformity and long-term relationships. He revisited this theme in [...] "51st Anniversary" [...] and [...] "Highway Chile". Omitted from the American version of the album, [...] "Red House" [...] would not see an official release in US until the 1969 compilation Smash Hits. An unusual feature of the recording {{is that it does}} not include a bass guitar track; Redding instead played rhythm guitar with his equalization set strongly in favor of bass tones. It is Hendrix's only original twelve-bar blues.|$|E
500|$|... 1928 was {{the first}} year of Cochet's hegemony of the world rankings. He was listed first {{followed}} by René Lacoste and Bill Tilden. This was the result of his overall season, that as usual commenced on the French Riviera. Prior to that he was drafted into a Queen's Club – Sporting Club de Paris warm-up team challenge. He contributed to the Parisian victory with two mixed and a singles win. The following month <b>he</b> <b>swept</b> almost all available Riviera titles from February to March. He kicked off the tour by winning his first mixed New Courts L.T.C title with his U.S. Championships partner Eileen Bennett. In February he successfully defended his Métropole Club and Gallia L.T.C. singles titles by defeating Henry Mayes twice in a row. In the Monaco Cup at the La Festa Country Club Cochet turned the tide from two sets down against two-times reigning champion Béla von Kehrling, the first meeting of a rivalry that continued onward into the year. They both reached the mixed doubles final, which remained unplayed and the prize was divided. The Cochet – Brugnon pair also won the Butler Cup there (reserved for doubles of the same nationality). At the Nice Lawn Tennis Club tournament they met again for the singles contest and Cochet won in straight sets. Cochet completed his second triple crown there. In Menton at the official Riviera Championships eventual singles victor Von Kehrling and former Danish Champion Erik Worm warded off Cochet and Count Salm in the doubles final. In the mixed Von Kehrling and Cilly Aussem beat the seasoned duo Cochet–Bennett. His third Côte d'Azur trophy was granted to him after Otto Froitzheim traveled home before the final and gave him a walkover. One week later at the 50th Cannes Championships he reached the final to face Henry Mayes again, but due to misunderstandings he was 10 minutes late and had been defaulted from the tournament. Subsequently, he lost the mixed doubles match alongside Phyllis Satterthwaite and only found his form in the doubles with Jack Hillyard at the expense of their opponents Count Salm and Worm. In April at the Biarritz tournament Cochet routed compatriot Roger George in four sets. He was victorious in Marseilles versus Emmanuel Du Plaix and in the mixed with Cilly Aussem. The Miramar L.T.C. tournament in Juan-les-Pins resulted in a three set final between René Gallèpe of Monaco and Cochet and ended in favor of the Frenchman.|$|E
