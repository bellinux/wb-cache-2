5|$|The {{final step}} of {{drinking}} water treatment is <b>disinfection</b> to ensure that final drinking water is free from infectious microorganisms. As suspended particles (turbidity) can provide a growth substrate for microorganisms and can protect them from <b>disinfection</b> treatment, it is extremely important that the water treatment process achieves a good level of removal of suspended particles.|$|E
5|$|When used at {{specified}} {{levels for}} water <b>disinfection,</b> {{the reaction of}} chlorine with water {{is not a major}} concern for human health. Other materials present in the water may generate <b>disinfection</b> by-products that are associated with negative effects on human health.|$|E
5|$|Many small {{communities}} obtain their drinking water from diverse sources (lakes, streams, springs and groundwater wells). Levels of treatment vary widely, from rudimentary systems with coarse screening or settling followed by <b>disinfection</b> (usually chlorination), to more sophisticated systems using a filtration step. It {{should be noted}} that unless a high quality source is used, such as secure groundwater, <b>disinfection</b> alone is unlikely to guarantee that drinking water is safe from protozoa such as Giardia and Cryptosporidium, which are relatively resistant to standard disinfectants and which require additional removal steps such as filtration.|$|E
5|$|A further {{point to}} note is that drinking-water {{treatment}} commonly involves {{the addition of}} treatment chemicals such as aluminium sulfate or ferric chloride as flocculants, lime for pH adjustment, chlorine for <b>disinfection</b> and fluoride compounds for dental health.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{of the dam}} {{started in}} 1919 and was {{finished}} in 1923, with the first water delivered in 1934 after numerous delays. From 1935–38 the dam was raised to increase its capacity for water supply and power generation. The dam, aqueduct and appurtenant hydroelectric systems are collectively known as the Hetch Hetchy Project. Deriving from a largely wild and pristine area of the Sierra Nevada, the Hetch Hetchy supply {{is some of the}} cleanest municipal water in the US, requiring only primary filtration and <b>disinfection.</b>|$|E
5|$|Solar water <b>disinfection</b> (SODIS) {{involves}} exposing water-filled plastic {{polyethylene terephthalate}} (PET) bottles to sunlight for several hours. Exposure times {{vary depending on}} weather and climate from a minimum of six hours to two days during fully overcast conditions. It is recommended by the World Health Organization as a viable method for household water treatment and safe storage. Over two million people in developing countries use this method for their daily drinking water.|$|E
5|$|The 2007 Bernard Matthews H5N1 {{outbreak}} was an {{occurrence of}} avian influenza in England {{caused by the}} H5N1 subtype of Influenza virus A that began on 30 January 2007. The infection affected poultry at one of Bernard Matthews' farms in Holton in Suffolk. It was the third instance of H5N1-subtype detected in the United Kingdom {{and a range of}} precautions were instituted to prevent spread of the disease including a large cull of turkeys, the imposition of segregation zones, and a <b>disinfection</b> programme for the plant.|$|E
5|$|Volcanic ashfall {{is likely}} to have major effects on these systems. Ash will clog intake structures, cause {{abrasion}} damage to pumps and block pipes, settling ponds and open filters. High levels of turbidity are very likely to interfere with <b>disinfection</b> treatment and doses may have to be adjusted to compensate. It is essential to monitor chlorine residuals in the distribution system.|$|E
5|$|Production of both {{bulbs and}} cut flowers {{takes place in}} open fields in beds or ridges, often in the same field, {{allowing}} adaptation to changing market conditions. Narcissi grow best in mild maritime climates. Compared to the United Kingdom, the harsher winters in the Netherlands require covering the fields with straw for protection. Areas with higher rainfall and temperatures {{are more susceptible to}} diseases that attack the crops. production is based on a 1 (UK) or 2 (Netherlands) year cycle. Optimal soil pH is 6.0–7.5. Prior to planting <b>disinfection</b> by hot water takes place, such as immersion at 44.4°C for three hours.|$|E
5|$|Quantitatively, of all {{elemental}} chlorine produced, about 63% {{is used in}} the manufacture of organic compounds, and 18% in the manufacture of inorganic chlorine compounds. About 15,000 chlorine compounds are used commercially. The remaining 19% of chlorine produced is used for bleaches and <b>disinfection</b> products. The most significant of organic compounds in terms of production volume are 1,2-dichloroethane and vinyl chloride, intermediates in the production of PVC. Other particularly important organochlorines are methyl chloride, methylene chloride, chloroform, vinylidene chloride, trichloroethylene, perchloroethylene, allyl chloride, epichlorohydrin, chlorobenzene, dichlorobenzenes, and trichlorobenzenes. The major inorganic compounds include HCl, Cl2O, HOCl, NaClO3, chlorinated isocyanurates, AlCl3, SiCl4, SnCl4, PCl3, PCl5, POCl3, AsCl3, SbCl3, SbCl5, BiCl3, S2Cl2, SCl2, SOCI2, ClF3, ICl, ICl3, TiCl3, TiCl4, MoCl5, FeCl3, ZnCl2, and so on.|$|E
5|$|The first mass exterminations at Auschwitz {{took place}} in early September 1941, when 900 inmates were killed by {{gathering}} them {{in the basement of}} Block 11 and gassing them with Zyklon B. This building proved unsuitable for mass gassings, so the site of the killings was moved to the crematorium at Auschwitz I (Crematorium I, which operated until July 1942). There, more than 700 victims could be killed at once. In order to keep the victims calm, they were told they were to undergo <b>disinfection</b> and de-lousing. They were ordered to undress outside and then were locked in the building and gassed. After its decommissioning as a gas chamber, the building was converted to a storage facility and later served as an air raid shelter for the SS. The gas chamber and crematorium were reconstructed after the war using the original components, which remained on site. Some 60,000 people were killed at Crematorium I.|$|E
5|$|Epidemiology is used {{to break}} the chain of {{infection}} in populations during outbreaks of viral diseases. Control measures are used {{that are based on}} knowledge of how the virus is transmitted. It is important to find the source, or sources, of the outbreak and to identify the virus. Once the virus has been identified, the chain of transmission can sometimes be broken by vaccines. When vaccines are not available, sanitation and <b>disinfection</b> can be effective. Often, infected people are isolated {{from the rest of the}} community, and those that have been exposed to the virus are placed in quarantine. To control the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in cattle in Britain in 2001, thousands of cattle were slaughtered. Most viral infections of humans and other animals have incubation periods during which the infection causes no signs or symptoms. Incubation periods for viral diseases range from a few days to weeks, but are known for most infections. Somewhat overlapping, but mainly following the incubation period, there is a period of communicability — a time when an infected individual or animal is contagious and can infect another person or animal. This, too, is known for many viral infections, and knowledge of the length of both periods is important in the control of outbreaks. When outbreaks cause an unusually high proportion of cases in a population, community, or region, they are called epidemics. If outbreaks spread worldwide, they are called pandemics.|$|E
25|$|Techniques include boiling, filtration, {{activated}} charcoal absorption, chemical <b>disinfection,</b> ultraviolet purification, ozone water <b>disinfection,</b> solar water <b>disinfection,</b> solar distillation, homemade water filters.|$|E
25|$|US EPA {{drinking}} water quality standards limit chloramine concentration for public water systems to 4 {{parts per million}} (ppm) based on a running annual average of all samples in the distribution system. In order to meet EPA-regulated limits on halogenated <b>disinfection</b> by-products, many utilities are switching from chlorination to chloramination. While chloramination produces fewer regulated total halogenated <b>disinfection</b> by-products, it can produce greater concentrations of unregulated iodinated <b>disinfection</b> byproducts and N-nitrosodimethylamine. Both iodinated <b>disinfection</b> by-products and N-nitrosodimethylamine {{have been shown to}} be genotoxic.|$|E
25|$|<b>Disinfection</b> using UV {{radiation}} {{is commonly used}} in wastewater treatment applications and is finding an increased usage in municipal drinking water treatment. Many bottlers of spring water use UV <b>disinfection</b> equipment to sterilize their water. Solar water <b>disinfection</b> has been researched for cheaply treating contaminated water using natural sunlight. The UV-A irradiation and increased water temperature kill organisms in the water.|$|E
25|$|The {{purpose of}} <b>disinfection</b> in the {{treatment}} of waste water is to substantially reduce the number of microorganisms in the water to be discharged back into the environment for the later use of drinking, bathing, irrigation, etc. The effectiveness of <b>disinfection</b> depends {{on the quality of the}} water being treated (e.g., cloudiness, pH, etc.), the type of <b>disinfection</b> being used, the disinfectant dosage (concentration and time), and other environmental variables. Cloudy water will be treated less successfully, since solid matter can shield organisms, especially from ultraviolet light or if contact times are low. Generally, short contact times, low doses and high flows all militate against effective <b>disinfection.</b> Common methods of <b>disinfection</b> include ozone, chlorine, ultraviolet light, or sodium hypochlorite. Chloramine, which is used for drinking water, is not used {{in the treatment}} of waste water because of its persistence. After multiple steps of <b>disinfection,</b> the treated water is ready to be released back into the water cycle by means of the nearest body of water or agriculture. Afterwards, the water can be transferred to reserves for everyday human uses.|$|E
25|$|Full mouth <b>disinfection</b> {{protocols}} are favoured by some clinicians. There is {{no evidence}} that full mouth <b>disinfection</b> or full mouth scaling protocols improve the outcome when compared to standard mechanical scaling and root planing.|$|E
25|$|Portable water {{purification}} devices and methods {{are available for}} <b>disinfection</b> and treatment in emergencies or in remote locations. <b>Disinfection</b> is the primary goal, since aesthetic considerations such as taste, odor, appearance, and trace chemical contamination do not affect the short-term safety of drinking water.|$|E
25|$|UV water {{treatment}} devices {{can be used}} for well water and surface water <b>disinfection.</b> UV treatment compares favorably with other water <b>disinfection</b> systems in terms of cost, labor, and the need for technically trained personnel for operation. Water chlorination treats larger organisms and offers residual <b>disinfection,</b> but these systems are expensive because they need special operator training and a steady supply of a potentially hazardous material. Finally, boiling of water is the most reliable treatment method but it demands labor, and imposes a high economic cost. UV treatment is rapid and, in terms of primary energy use, approximately 20,000 times more efficient than boiling.|$|E
25|$|Reservoir {{water is}} treated through {{chemical}} coagulation, rapid gravity filtration and <b>disinfection.</b>|$|E
25|$|Drinking {{abundant}} {{quantities of}} alcohol following the cauterization or <b>disinfection</b> {{of the wound}} area.|$|E
25|$|Human health effects: excess nitrate in {{drinking}} water (blue baby syndrome); <b>disinfection</b> by-products {{in drinking}} water.|$|E
25|$|While Cryptosporidium {{is highly}} {{resistant}} to chlorine <b>disinfection,</b> with high enough concentrations and contact time, Cryptosporidium will be inactivated by chlorine dioxide and ozone treatment. The required levels of chlorine generally preclude {{the use of}} chlorine <b>disinfection</b> as a reliable method to control Cryptosporidium in drinking water. Ultraviolet light treatment at relatively low doses will inactivate Cryptosporidium. Water Research Foundation-funded research originally discovered UV's efficacy in inactivating Cryptosporidium.|$|E
25|$|Modern {{technologies}} such as reverse osmosis and ultraviolet <b>disinfection</b> are commonly used when reclaimed water will be mixed with the drinking water supply.|$|E
25|$|Other pioneers include Danish {{physician}} Peter Anton Schleisner, who in 1849 related {{his work}} on the prevention of the epidemic of neonatal tetanus on the Vestmanna Islands in Iceland. Another important pioneer was Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis, who in 1847 brought down infant mortality at a Vienna hospital by instituting a <b>disinfection</b> procedure. His findings were published in 1850, but his work was ill-received by his colleagues, who discontinued the procedure. <b>Disinfection</b> did not become widely practiced until British surgeon Joseph Lister 'discovered' antiseptics in 1865 in light of the work of Louis Pasteur.|$|E
25|$|Sanitary {{control points}} are {{functioning}} {{in the border}} crossing places, including airports and railway stations. They have been provided with additional special equipment and <b>disinfection</b> means, he added.|$|E
25|$|Ultraviolet (UV) {{light can}} be used instead of chlorine, iodine, or other {{chemicals}}. Because no chemicals are used, the treated water has no adverse effect on organisms that later consume it, as {{may be the case}} with other methods. UV radiation causes damage to the genetic structure of bacteria, viruses, and other pathogens, making them incapable of reproduction. The key disadvantages of UV <b>disinfection</b> are the need for frequent lamp maintenance and replacement and the need for a highly treated effluent to ensure that the target microorganisms are not shielded from the UV radiation (i.e., any solids present in the treated effluent may protect microorganisms from the UV light). In the United Kingdom, UV light is becoming the most common means of <b>disinfection</b> because of the concerns about the impacts of chlorine in chlorinating residual organics in the wastewater and in chlorinating organics in the receiving water. Some sewage treatment systems in Canada and the US also use UV light for their effluent water <b>disinfection.</b>|$|E
25|$|When an UV {{light is}} used, this lamp should be checked and changed as well. UV lights {{decrease}} in power over time, resulting in diminished <b>disinfection</b> {{of the working}} area.|$|E
25|$|The {{first modern}} piped water system in Japan was {{completed}} in 1887 in the port city Yokohama, using surface water treated by a sand filter. By 1900, seven cities had piped water supply and by 1940 about {{one third of the}} population was connected to piped water systems. The incidence of water-borne diseases such as cholera, dysentery and typhoid remained high until after the Second World War when <b>disinfection</b> was introduced by the Americans and became mandatory in 1957. Through the increase of piped water supply, <b>disinfection</b> and sanitation the incidence of waterborne diseases dropped sharply during the 1960s and 70s.|$|E
25|$|Solar water <b>disinfection</b> is a {{low-cost}} method of purifying water that {{can often be}} implemented with locally available materials. Unlike methods that rely on firewood, it has low impact on the environment.|$|E
25|$|In 2000, 80% {{of urban}} water supply systems used <b>disinfection</b> measures. In urban areas, 43 {{companies}} that provided {{information to the}} regulator complied with the norms for residual chlorine in the network.|$|E
25|$|Treatment is {{not usually}} required, as most warts {{eventually}} regress spontaneously. Surgical removal is possible but may lead to recurrence. <b>Disinfection</b> with formaldehyde of stalls, fence posts and other environmental virus reservoirs can prevent transmission.|$|E
25|$|Ultraviolet light (UV) is very {{effective}} at inactivating cysts, in low turbidity water. UV light's <b>disinfection</b> effectiveness decreases as turbidity increases, {{a result of}} the absorption, scattering, and shadowing caused by the suspended solids. The main disadvantage to the use of UV radiation is that, like ozone treatment, it leaves no residual disinfectant in the water; therefore, it is sometimes necessary to add a residual disinfectant after the primary <b>disinfection</b> process. This is often done through the addition of chloramines, discussed above as a primary disinfectant. When used in this manner, chloramines provide an effective residual disinfectant with very few of the negative effects of chlorination.|$|E
25|$|Ozone (3) is {{generated}} by passing oxygen (2) through a high voltage potential resulting in a third oxygen atom becoming attached and forming 3. Ozone is very unstable and reactive and oxidizes most organic material it comes in contact with, thereby destroying many pathogenic microorganisms. Ozone {{is considered to be}} safer than chlorine because, unlike chlorine which has to be stored on site (highly poisonous {{in the event of an}} accidental release), ozone {{is generated}} on-site as needed. Ozonation also produces fewer <b>disinfection</b> by-products than chlorination. A disadvantage of ozone <b>disinfection</b> is the high cost of the ozone generation equipment and the requirements for special operators.|$|E
25|$|For {{many types}} of reuse {{applications}} wastewater must pass through numerous sewage treatment process steps {{before it can be}} used. Steps might include screening, primary settling, biological treatment, tertiary treatment (for example reverse osmosis), and <b>disinfection.</b>|$|E
25|$|Chlorine's {{bleaching}} properties {{were eventually}} {{turned into an}} industry by Berzelius, and became {{the foundation of a}} second industry of <b>disinfection</b> and deodorization of putrefied tissue and wounds (including wounds in living humans) in the hands of Labarraque, by 1824.|$|E
