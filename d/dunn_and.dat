5|$|Dunn's {{training}} facility, Bud Dunn Stables, (later Bud <b>Dunn</b> <b>and</b> Son Stables) was in Florence, Alabama, on a ten-acre property. Dunn {{moved to}} north Alabama from Georgia in the 1950s, and bought out another trainer who was quitting the horse business. By the mid-1980s, Dunn had over 50 horses in training at a time, and had several full-time employees. He also judged Tennessee Walking Horse shows, including the Spring Celebration, an annual Tennessee Walking Horse show in Shelbyville, Tennessee that is traditionally popular with trainers {{who hope to}} enter horses in the National Celebration later in the year.|$|E

5|$|Against Third Division Luton Town in the quarter-final, Everton won comfortably. The match {{remained}} scoreless {{for half}} an hour, but after Stein opened the scoring for Everton the match became one-sided, and ended 6–0. Stein and Johnson both scored twice, along with a goal each for <b>Dunn</b> <b>and</b> Dean, the latter maintaining his record of scoring in every round. By this time Everton were viewed as favourites to win the competition. In the semi-final they played West Ham at Molineux, Wolverhampton. Everton {{took the lead in}} the sixth minute. A corner kick by Stein was headed on by Johnson, and then headed into the net by Dunn. Everton had the better of the play in the first half, but Vic Watson scored for West Ham just before half-time. In the second half West Ham's Woods missed an open goal from six yards (5.5m). Everton then capitalised on their reprieve. With seven minutes remaining, a mistake by Jim Barrett allowed Edward Critchley to go clear on goal and score the winner.|$|E
5|$|During the 2016 NBA Summer League, Jones {{was named}} MVP of the league. He led Minnesota to four {{consecutive}} wins during the tournament {{to advance to}} the NBA Summer League's Championship game after losing the opening three games in Las Vegas. In seven games in Las Vegas, Jones averaged 19.4 points on 45.7 percent shooting to go with 6.3 assists, 4.0 rebounds and 1.3 steals per game. Nonetheless he began the season behind Rubio and Kris Dunn on the team depth chart. He made his season debut on November 1 with 6 assists in the Timberwolves' third game against Memphis when Rubio was lost indefinitely to a sprained elbow. On November 8, Jones posted career highs with 12 points and 5 steals as well as a career-high tying 5 rebounds to go along with a game-high 7 assists against the Brooklyn Nets. When Rubio did not play in the April 12, 2017 regular season finale against the Houston Rockets, Timberwolves point guards Kris <b>Dunn</b> <b>and</b> Jones both set new career highs with 16 assists and 17 points, respectively.|$|E

5|$|In 1994, {{the label}} removed Herndon and Thomas from the group, which was renamed Terry McBride & the Ride. McBride {{remained}} lead singer, {{while the other}} members were replaced with Keith Edwards (drums), Kenny Vaughan (electric guitar), Gary Morse (steel guitar), Jeff Roach (keyboards), and Randy Frazier (bass guitar), formerly of the band Palomino Road. Roach and Vaughan were respectively replaced by Rick Gerken and Bob Britt shortly before their fourth album (1994's Terry McBride & the Ride), after which McBride & the Ride disbanded. During the hiatus, MCA issued a compilation called Country's Best, while McBride and Herndon wrote singles for other artists. McBride, Thomas, and Herndon reunited as McBride & the Ride in 2000, releasing Amarillo Sky on Dualtone Records in 2002 before splitting up again. McBride later joined the backing band for the duo Brooks & <b>Dunn</b> <b>and</b> continued to write singles for other artists, while Herndon self-released a solo album, and Thomas joined The Time Jumpers.|$|E
5|$|In a 1990 {{morphological}} phylogenetic study, Kiyonori Nishida {{concluded that}} the deepwater stingray and the sixgill stingray (Hexatrygon bickelli) were the most basal stingrays (suborder Myliobatoidei). Therefore, he moved this species to its own genus, Plesiobatis, and family, Plesiobatidae; the name {{is derived from the}} Greek plesio ("primitive") and batis ("ray"). Subsequent morphological studies have corroborated the basal position of Plesiobatis, but disagreed on its relationships to nearby taxa. John McEachran, Katherine <b>Dunn,</b> <b>and</b> Tsutomu Miyake in 1996 could not fully resolve the position of Plesiobatis, thus they assigned it provisionally to the family Hexatrygonidae. McEachran and Neil Aschliman in 2004 found Plesiobatis to be the sister taxon of Urolophus, and recommended that it be placed in the family Urolophidae. Until the phylogeny is better-resolved, authors have tended to preserve the family Plesiobatidae.|$|E
5|$|Ramírez pitched for Scranton/Wilkes-Barre for the {{remainder}} of the International League season, finishing with a Class AAA record of 1–5 with a 3.19 ERA in 29 games. Ramírez was promoted to the Yankees when MLB rosters expanded on September 1. He remained with the Yankees for September; along with fellow call-ups Jonathan Albaladejo, David Robertson, Mike <b>Dunn</b> <b>and</b> Mark Melancon, Ramírez was expected to absorb some of the workload in the bullpen, helping to spare the overworked Alfredo Aceves, Phil Hughes, Phil Coke, and Dámaso Marte. Towards the end of the season, he was only used on blowout games as a result of his ineffectiveness. Ramírez finished the season with a 5.73 ERA, allowing fourteen earned runs in 22 innings; though he did strike out exactly one batter per inning, he also issued too many walks as he struggled with consistency. Though Ramírez did not appear in the 2009 postseason with the Yankees, the organization did present him with a 2009 World Series ring.|$|E

5|$|The {{award was}} {{introduced}} following the conference's first season in 1980, {{in which it}} was presented to John Duren of Georgetown. Patrick Ewing (Georgetown), Richard Hamilton (Connecticut), Troy Bell (Boston College), Troy Murphy (Notre Dame) and Kris Dunn (Providence) each won the award twice, and Chris Mullin (St. John's) won three consecutive times from 1983 through 1985. Three award winners have been inducted as players to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. Ewing, who shared the award in 1984 and 1985 with Mullin, was inducted in 2008 after playing 17years in the National Basketball Association between 1985 and 2002. Mullin followed in 2011 after a 16-year NBA career (1985–2001). Most recently, Georgetown's 1992 Player of the Year Alonzo Mourning entered the Hall in 2014 following a 16-year NBA career (1992–2008). There have been seven ties; the most recent instance was that between <b>Dunn</b> <b>and</b> Ryan Arcidiacono of Villanova in 2015.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{their return}} to the WWF, Well Dunn had a short series of matches against WWF Tag Team Champions The Headshrinkers, {{including}} a match televised on WWF Wrestling Challenge. Well Dunn became involved in a storyline in which Adam Bomb, who was also managed by Wippleman, turned on the manager and began wrestling as a face. On the August 13 episode of WWF Superstars, Well wrestled a singles match against Bomb; Dunn interfered, and Bomb attacked Well <b>Dunn</b> <b>and</b> Wippleman after the match. This led to a blow off match one week later, in which Bomb teamed with The Smoking Gunns to defeat Kwang (another of Wippleman's wrestlers) and Well Dunn. On August 17, the team also served as lumberjacks in a lumberjack match between Bret and Owen Hart.|$|E
5|$|June had offseason foot {{surgery in}} February 2008. During the opening {{game of the}} season, Brooks {{suffered}} a hamstring injury and removed himself from {{the game in the}} third quarter, which fueled speculation during the following week that he would miss the first start of his fourteen-year career and that June would start on the weakside. Brooks, however, made his 194th-consecutive start the following week. In a story not published until four weeks later, Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson claims that June attempted to injure him in a November 16 game. June made his first interception of the season and second as a Buccaneer on a Drew Brees pass that was tipped by Ronde Barber in the twelfth game of the season as Tampa earned its fourth consecutive victory to improve its record to 93 on November 30 against the New Orleans Saints. After the Buccaneers lost their final four games to miss the playoffs, the Buccaneers replaced Jon Gruden and Bruce Allen with Raheem Morris and Mark Dominik as head coach and general manager. The team subsequently released five veteran players in a move that was said to be unrelated to the salary cap. June was released by the Buccaneers on February 25, 2009 along with Derrick Brooks, Ike Hilliard, Warrick <b>Dunn</b> <b>and</b> Joey Galloway. The transaction avoided a $2million roster bonus for June.|$|E
