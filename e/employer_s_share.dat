40|$|There {{have been}} a number of studies {{analyzing}} the impact of unions on labor 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>share</b> of income. Most have relied on either time series or cross-section data. The purpose of this paper is to determine the impact of unions on labor 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>share</b> of income in the U. S. This study adds to the understanding of this topic by developing an analytical model of imperfect competition and estimating the model using panel data for the manufacturing sector. This study finds that unions have a positive impact on labor 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>share</b> of income. Specifically, this paper finds that labor 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>share</b> declined 17. 9 percent between 1997 and 2006 whereas, if unionization density had remained at its 1997 level, labor 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>share</b> would have declined only 13. 9 percent. Thus, the decline in unionization explains about 29 percent of the decline in labor 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>share</b> of income. This paper is important for three reasons. First, this paper sheds light on whether social and institutional forces play an important role in determining the distribution of income between labor and capital.

Finally, we have studied how the share of value added in the value of production in Finnish manufacturing sectors has changed between the 1970 s and 2005.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} two chapters. The first chapter addresses the role of trade barriers in explaining differences in the relative prices of tradables across countries. The second chapter assesses the quantitative importance of changes in comparative advantage in explaining {{the changes in the}} compositions of exports and output in South Korea during its growth miracle. In the first chapter I quantitatively address the role of trade barriers in explaining the cross-country distribution of the price of nontradables relative to tradables. Relative prices of nontradables are higher in rich countries than in poor countries. The standard explanation for this is due to Balassa (1964) and Samuelson (1964), where, in each country, the relative price of nontradables is equal to the inverse of relative productivity, and relative productivity is higher in poor countries. I construct a multi-country model of trade in which countries face asymmetric trade barriers. There are many tradable goods and trade barriers determine the cross-country pattern of specialization across tradable goods. The realized pattern of specialization determines measured productivity in the tradables sector, which determines relative prices. Existing trade barriers account for half of the difference in relative prices between rich and poor countries. In the second chapter, I explore how the evolution of comparative advantage can explain the changes in the compositions of exports and output that occurred in South Korea during its growth miracle. From 1960 to 1995 manufacture 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>share</b> in both exports and output increased. I embed a dynamic, multi-country model of trade into a three-sector model of structural change where agriculture, manufactures, and services are complementary in both consumption and production. I measure productivity growth, in each sector for each country, using a growth accounting procedure. I feed the productivity growth rates into the model and find that the increase in manufacture 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>share</b> in exports and output are explained by a shift in comparative advantage. The model also matches other aspects of the compositions: the declines in both agriculture 2 ̆ 7 s and service 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>share</b> in exports, and the decline in agriculture 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>share</b> in output. Finally, the model tracks the composition of output for other countries...|$|R

Four of the seven human A 3 s restrict HIV by ‘hypermutating’ the reverse-transcribed viral genomic DNA. HIV Virion Infectivity Factor (Vif) counters this restriction by targeting A 3 s to proteasomal degradation. However, there is no apparent correlation between catalytic activity, Vif binding, and sequence similarity between A 3 domains. Our comparative structural analysis reveals features required for binding Vif and features influencing polynucleotide deaminase activity in A 3 proteins. All Vif-binding A 3 <b>s</b> <b>share</b> a negatively charged surface region that includes residues previously implicated in binding the highly-positively charged Vif.
