25|$|Because banks hold {{reserves}} in amounts {{that are less}} than the amounts of their <b>deposit</b> <b>liabilities,</b> and because the <b>deposit</b> <b>liabilities</b> are considered money in their own right, fractional-reserve banking permits the money supply to grow beyond {{the amount of the}} underlying base money originally created by the central bank. In most countries, the central bank (or other monetary authority) regulates bank credit creation, imposing reserve requirements and capital adequacy ratios. This can slow down the process of money creation that occurs in the commercial banking system, and helps to ensure that banks are solvent and have enough funds to meet demand for withdrawals. However, rather than directly controlling the money supply, central banks usually pursue an interest rate target to adjust the rate of inflation and bank issuance of credit.|$|E
25|$|Fractional-reserve banking is the {{practice}} whereby a bank accepts deposits, makes loans or investments, but {{is required to}} hold reserves equal to {{only a fraction of}} its <b>deposit</b> <b>liabilities.</b> Reserves are held as currency in the bank, or as balances in the bank's accounts at the central bank. Fractional-reserve banking is the current form of banking practiced in most countries worldwide.|$|E
25|$|In most legal systems, a {{bank deposit}} {{is not a}} bailment. In other words, the funds {{deposited}} {{are no longer the}} property of the customer. The funds become the property of the bank, and the customer in turn receives an asset called a deposit account (a checking or savings account). That deposit account is a liability on the balance sheet of the bank. Each bank is legally authorized to issue credit up to a specified multiple of its reserves, so reserves available to satisfy payment of <b>deposit</b> <b>liabilities</b> are less than the total amount which the bank is obligated to pay in satisfaction of demand deposits.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the efficiency of}} money creation by banks and {{the principles of the}} central bank issuance to improve over it. The ability to issue <b>deposit</b> <b>liability</b> as a means of payment enlarges banks lending capacities and subjects them to fiercer competition. In curcumstances where banks issue too much money, interest-rate policy may help. In circumstances of a credit crunch, quantitative- easing policy helps, under which the central bank lends its issues to all banks. These issues are unbacked by taxation and purely nominal. The optimal quantity of the central bank's lending is unique and implements the first-best allocation...|$|R
25|$|The reserve {{requirement}} (or cash reserve ratio) {{is a central}} bank regulation employed by most, but not all, of the world's central banks, that sets the minimum amount of reserves that must be held by a commercial bank. The minimum reserve is generally determined by the central bank to be no less than a specified percentage {{of the amount of}} <b>deposit</b> <b>liabilities</b> the commercial bank owes to its customers. The commercial bank's reserves normally consist of cash owned by the bank and stored physically in the bank vault (vault cash), plus the amount of the commercial bank's balance in that bank's account with the central bank.|$|E
25|$|Banking {{institutions}} in the United States are required to hold reservesamounts of currency and deposits in other banksequal to {{only a fraction of}} the amount of the bank's <b>deposit</b> <b>liabilities</b> owed to customers. This practice is called fractional-reserve banking. As a result, banks usually invest the majority of the funds received from depositors. On rare occasions, too many of the bank's customers will withdraw their savings and the bank will need help from another institution to continue operating; this is called a bank run. Bank runs can lead to a multitude of social and economic problems. The Federal Reserve System was designed as an attempt to prevent or minimize the occurrence of bank runs, and possibly act as a lender of last resort when a bank run does occur. Many economists, following Milton Friedman, believe that the Federal Reserve inappropriately refused to lend money to small banks during the bank runs of 1929.|$|E

2500|$|In the United States, {{a reserve}} {{requirement}} (or liquidity ratio) is a minimum value, {{set by the}} Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, of the ratio of required reserves to a category of <b>deposit</b> <b>liabilities</b> (called the [...] "Net Transaction Accounts" [...] or [...] "NTAs") owed by depository institutions to their customers (e.g., owed by commercial banks including U.S. branches of a foreign bank, savings and loan association, savings bank, credit union). The deposit liability categories currently subject to reserve requirements are mainly checking accounts. There is no reserve requirement on savings accounts and time deposit accounts owned by individuals. The total amount of all NTAs held by customers with U.S. depository institutions, plus the U.S. paper currency and coin currency held by the nonbank public, is called M1.|$|E

50|$|By {{transferring}} {{the ownership of}} deposits from one party to another, banks can avoid using physical cash {{as a method of}} payment. Commercial bank deposits account for most of the money supply in use today. For example, if a bank in the United States makes a loan to a customer by depositing the loan proceeds in that customer's checking account, the bank typically records this event by debiting an asset account on the bank's books (called loans receivable or some similar name) and credits the <b>deposit</b> <b>liability</b> or checking account of the customer on the bank's books. From an economic standpoint, the bank has essentially created economic money (although not legal tender). The customer's checking account balance has no dollar bills in it, as a demand deposit account is simply a liability owed by the bank to its customer. In this way, commercial banks are allowed to increase the money supply (without printing currency, or legal tender).|$|R

40|$|The study {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} financial deepening and economic growth in Tanzania. The ratio of bank <b>deposit</b> <b>liability</b> to nominal gross national product {{is used as a}} measure of financial deepening and modelled for relationship with real per capita income. The static ordinary least squares (SOLS) and the dynamic ordinary least squares (DOLS) estimation methods are used. The model examines the periods of financial repression and of financial liberalization. The results suggest that though the real interest rate has insignificant impact overall, it is mixed for the two periods under consideration. Whereas, its impact on financial deepening is negative during the period of financial repression, it exerts a small but positive impact on financial development during the period of financial liberalization. The relationship between financial deepening and economic growth appears to be surprisingly negative and significant overall and during the period of financial liberalization but insignificant during financial repression. The results from the tests for causality suggest that financial deepening and economic growth are however independent in Tanzania. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley and Sons, Ltd...|$|R

40|$|The study {{examined}} the relationship between banking sector development and economic growth in Nigeria for the period 1977 to 2010. Banking sector development is represented by changes in Trade Openness (TO), Credit to Private Sector (PCR), Domestic Credit (DC), <b>Deposit</b> <b>Liability</b> (DL) and Interest Rate (INT) while economic growth is represented by Real Gross Domestic Product (RGDP). The study used causal comparative research design methodology and utilizes econometric techniques such as Augmented Dickey Fuller (ADF) and Phillips Perron (PP) Unit Root tests as well as Johansen Co-integration, followed by Error Correction Model (ECM) tests to analyze secondary data collected from the Central of Nigeria (CBN) annual reports for a period of thirty three years. The result of the study revealed that TO, DC and INT have positive relationship with RGDP while PCR and DL have negative relationship with RGDP. The result of the study therefore lends very strong support to the existence of a short and long-run relationship between banking sector development and economic growth in Nigeria. The study therefore, recommended amongst others that banking sector reforms should be sustained so as to enhance economic growth in Nigeria...|$|R
