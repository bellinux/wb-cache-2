5|$|During World War II, CAP {{was seen}} as a way to use America's {{civilian}} aviation resources to aid the war effort instead of grounding them. The organization assumed many missions including anti-submarine patrol and warfare, border patrols, and courier services. During World War II CAP's coastal patrol flew 24 million miles, found 173 enemy U-boats, attacked 57, hit 10 and sank two, <b>dropping</b> <b>a</b> total of 83 bombs and depth charges throughout the conflict. By the end of the war, 64 CAP members had lost their lives in the line of duty.|$|E
5|$|In {{the grass}} season warm-ups, Federer, Djokovic, and Murray played while Nadal rested for Wimbledon. Federer lost his opening match of the Stuttgart Open to Tommy Haas, but later {{went on to}} win the 2017 Halle Open without <b>dropping</b> <b>a</b> set. This title saw Federer once again equal Nadal for the record of most ATP 500 titles won with 18. Djokovic won his first non-major grass title at the 2017 Eastbourne International, while Murray lost in his opening match in the 2017 Queens Club Championship.|$|E

5|$|As {{the final}} {{was held in}} England, at Wembley, Liverpool were clear favourites to retain the European Cup. Brugge were without {{a number of key}} players, such as Raoul Lambert, whose {{inclusion}} in the Brugge squad was rumoured before the final but never materialised. Liverpool were also without a few players. Tommy Smith, who had scored in the previous season's final, was out after <b>dropping</b> <b>a</b> pick-axe on his foot and breaking a toe. Striker David Johnson was also absent. He had strained knee ligaments during a match against Leicester City, an injury that ruled him out {{for the rest of the}} season.|$|E
5|$|At Wimbledon, Del Potro won against Albert Ramos, Jesse Levine, and Grega Žemlja before {{advancing}} {{past the}} fourth round {{for the first}} time in his career, thanks to a win over Andreas Seppi. He then played David Ferrer and, despite slipping badly during the fifth point of the match and aggravating a pre-existing leg injury, requiring over five minutes of treatment and by his own admission being close to forfeiting the match, he recovered to defeat Ferrer in straight sets to advance to his first Grand Slam semifinal since the 2009 US Open without <b>dropping</b> <b>a</b> set. On 5 July, Djokovic defeated him in five sets in 4 hours and 43 minutes, making it the longest semifinal in the history of Wimbledon men's singles.|$|E

5|$|Cagney became {{president}} of the Screen Actors Guild in 1942 for a two-year term. He took a role in the Guild's fight against the Mafia, which had begun to take an active interest in the movie industry. His wife, Billie Vernon, once received a phone call telling her that Cagney was dead. Cagney alleged that, having failed to scare off the Guild and him, they sent a hitman to kill him by <b>dropping</b> <b>a</b> heavy light onto his head. Upon hearing of the rumor of a hit, George Raft made a call, and the hit was supposedly canceled.|$|E
5|$|He {{defeated}} Andy Murray and Novak Djokovic {{in straight}} sets {{to win the}} Cincinnati Masters for the seventh time. This {{marked the first time}} that Federer had beaten the top 2 players in the world at the same tournament. At the US Open, he advanced to his first final there since 2009 without <b>dropping</b> <b>a</b> set, including a win over Stan Wawrinka in the semifinals. In the final, he was once again defeated by top seed Djokovic in four sets. At the Swiss Indoors tournament in Basel, Federer won his sixth singles title of the year, and his 88th ATP title, defeating his old rival Rafael Nadal in the final. It was the seventh time he had captured his hometown tournament.|$|E
5|$|In 1966, Stella North was at {{the centre}} of a legal case in which three men were found guilty of {{conspiracy}} to defraud after {{trying to sell the}} CEGB poor quality coal when contracted to deliver high quality coal. The three men involved were D.C.P. Brooksbank, a salesman for a coal firm; J.W. Patterson, a sampler at the power station, and M. Ridley, a contractor. Their scheme was for Patterson to substitute samples of reasonably good coal for the samples of poor coal taken from the lorries. However they were found out only two days after starting the scheme, when a foreman at the station saw Patterson <b>dropping</b> <b>a</b> bag of cement into the sampling bin, and reported the incident. Ridley was found to have planned the fraud, and was jailed for a year, while Brooksbank was fined £150 and Patterson £75.|$|E

5|$|The Phillies {{opened the}} season against the Washington Nationals at home on March 31. They failed to win any of their first three series, losing two of three against the Nationals and New York Mets, with a four-game split against the Cincinnati Reds between those series. The Phillies won their next two series against the Chicago Cubs and the Houston Astros. After <b>dropping</b> <b>a</b> second series to the Mets, the Phillies {{finished}} the month with 15wins and 12losses. They did not achieve a three-game sweep against any team in the opening month, nor were they swept. By winning at least one game in each series, the Phillies were able to achieve their first winning April in several seasons, and only their fourth since their last World Series appearance in 1993.|$|E
5|$|The VB series {{retained}} 96percent of {{the preceding}} HZ Kingswood's interior space, despite being 14percent smaller in overall dimensions, although fivepercent larger than the Torana. With the Commodore <b>dropping</b> <b>a</b> full class below the Kingswood and its Ford Falcon competitor, the smaller Commodore was predictably more fuel-efficient. This downsizing was first seen as a major disadvantage for Holden, as they had effectively relinquished the potential of selling Commodores to the fleet and taxi industries. These sales losses {{were thought to be}} unrecoverable; however, the 1979 energy crisis saw Australian oil prices rise by 140percent, putting substantial strain on the automotive industry to collectively downsize, a change that Holden had already done.|$|E
5|$|The film's scathingly bad {{reviews and}} poor word-of-mouth {{led to a}} precipitous falling-off in its grosses. Having earned $11,548,898 from 3,307 screens on its opening weekend, its take {{collapsed}} by 67 percent to $3,924,921 the following weekend, giving an average take of $1,158 per screen. The film made 85 percent of its entire domestic gross in its first 10 days and flatlined thereafter, with earnings <b>dropping</b> <b>a</b> further 75 percent {{by the end of}} its third week to $1million. The following week, facing earnings of just $205,745, Warner Bros. attempted to cut its losses by slashing the number of screens at which the film was being shown. The number was reduced from 2,587 to 641. By its sixth weekend on release, the film was showing on 95screens and had made $18,993 in a week – less than $200 per screen.|$|E

5|$|After the Australian Open, {{he participated}} in the 2011 SAP Open in San Jose, where he was {{accepted}} into the main draw via protected ranking (PR). He reached the semifinals without <b>dropping</b> <b>a</b> set, however he lost to top seed Fernando Verdasco in straight sets. Del Potro's next scheduled tournament was the 2011 Regions Morgan Keegan Championships and the Cellular South Cup, where he was accepted into the main draw via wildcard. Here, he made his second consecutive ATP semifinal, where he lost to top seed, world No. 8, and eventual champion Andy Roddick. To continue preparing for his first ATP Masters event since 2009, del Potro entered the 2011 Delray Beach International Tennis Championships.

In the final, he defeated an erratic Janko Tipsarević in two sets {{to get back in}} the winners circle.|$|E

The next day, while the Master and Mistress are at a show and the other workers are off on holiday, Sonya's father starts to beat her for accidentally <b>dropping</b> <b>a</b> heavy basket. Lad comes to her rescue and they retreat to the veranda where she pets him while he sleeps. When Sonya goes to the barn, her father is waiting for her and closes the door. Somehow she senses Lad beside her, which gives her the courage {{to stand up to}} her father. The man imagines he sees Lad beside her and runs away in fear. Unknown to both, Lad had died in his sleep and the Master and Mistress were crying over his body on the veranda.|$|E
5|$|At the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells, Murray lost at the quarterfinal {{stage to}} Juan Martín del Potro in three sets. At the Miami Masters, Murray {{made it through}} his first four matches without <b>dropping</b> <b>a</b> set, and after {{overcoming}} Richard Gasquet in the semifinals, faced David Ferrer in the final. After losing the first set, and facing match point in the decider at 5–6, Murray eventually took the match in a third set tiebreaker to win his second Miami Masters title, and leapfrog Roger Federer into {{second place in the}} rankings, ending a near-decade long time period in which neither Federer or Rafael Nadal were ranked in the top two. Murray briefly fell back to No. 3 in the world, following a third round defeat by Stanislas Wawrinka in Monte-Carlo, but reclaimed the No. 2 ranking as a result of Federer failing to defend his title at the Mutua Madrid Open. Later, Murray lost at the quarterfinal stage to Tomáš Berdych in straight sets.|$|E
