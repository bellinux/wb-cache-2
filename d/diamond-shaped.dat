5|$|Six hatchments hang in St Chad's {{in memory}} of 18th century members of the Hesketh-Fleetwood family. These hatchments are <b>diamond-shaped</b> {{representations}} of individual coats of arms, painted for their funeral processions and then hung in the parish church.|$|E
5|$|According to the 1995 presidential decree, the {{national}} flag {{is to be}} used on a staff that is colored gold (ochre). Other parts of the protocol specify the finial (the metal ornament on a flag pole) as <b>diamond-shaped</b> and colored in a yellow metal. In this diamond there is a five-pointed star (similar to that used in national emblem). The diamond-pattern represents another continuation of Soviet flag-traditions.|$|E
5|$|The {{main body}} of the fort {{consisted}} of a <b>diamond-shaped</b> structure made up of two flanks and two faces. The two faces and the right flank originally had embrasures, but they were dismantled in the late 19th century by the British. A blockhouse, with courtyards on either side, was located in the centre of the fort.|$|E
5|$|The YF-23 was an unconventional-looking aircraft, with <b>diamond-shaped</b> wings, {{a profile}} with {{substantial}} area-ruling to reduce aerodynamic drag at transonic speeds, and an all-moving V-tail. The cockpit was placed high, near {{the nose of}} the aircraft for good visibility for the pilot. The aircraft featured a tricycle landing gear configuration with a nose landing gear leg and two main landing gear legs. The weapons bay was placed {{on the underside of the}} fuselage between the nose and main landing gear. The cockpit has a center stick and side throttle.|$|E
5|$|The letter M in {{the state}} highway numbers is an {{integral}} part of the designation and included on the <b>diamond-shaped</b> reassurance markers posted alongside the highways. The state's highways are referred to using an M-n syntax as opposed to Route n or Highway n, which are common elsewhere. This usage dates from 1919, when Michigan's state trunklines were first signed along the roadways, and continues to this day in official and unofficial contexts. Michigan is one of only two states following this syntax, the other one being Kansas.|$|E
5|$|The shield is {{the normal}} device for {{displaying}} {{a coat of}} arms. Clergy have used less-military shapes such as the oval cartouche, but the shield {{has always been a}} clerical option. Clergy in Italy often use a shield shaped like a horse's face-armor. Clergy in South Africa sometimes follow the national style using a Nguni shield. Women traditionally display their coats of arms on a <b>diamond-shaped</b> lozenge; abbesses follow this tradition or use the cartouche.|$|E
5|$|Reaching {{a length}} of at least , the Tasmanian {{numbfish}} has a trowel-shaped pectoral fin disc with a short, blunt snout and concave leading margins. The medium-sized eyes are followed by smaller, nearly circular spiracles with smooth rims. A pair of large electric organs are located {{on either side of}} the head. There is a curtain of skin between the nostrils with a three-lobed posterior margin. The narrow, highly protrusible mouth is encircled by a deep groove. The teeth are small and <b>diamond-shaped</b> with pointed tips; they are arranged with a quincunx pattern into bands, which remain exposed when the mouth is closed. There are five pairs of gill slits beneath the disc.|$|E
5|$|The club's {{original}} crest was a quartered <b>diamond-shaped</b> crest {{topped by}} the Crown of Aragon and the bat of King James, {{and surrounded by}} two branches, one of a laurel tree {{and the other a}} palm. In 1910, the club held a competition among its members to design a new crest. The winner was Carles Comamala, who at the time played for the club. Comamala's suggestion became the crest that the club wears today, with some minor variations. The crest consists of the St George Cross in the upper-left corner with the Catalan flag beside it, and the team colours at the bottom.|$|E
5|$|The {{pectoral}} fin disc of the pink whipray is <b>diamond-shaped</b> and thick at the center, measuring about 1.1–1.2 times wider than long. The outer {{corners of the}} disc are angular. The snout forms a very obtuse angle, with the tip barely protruding. The small, widely spaced eyes are followed by larger spiracles. There is a short and broad curtain of skin with a finely fringed posterior margin between the long, thin nostrils. The mouth is fairly small and surrounded by prominent furrows; the lower jaw has a small indentation in the middle. There are two large central and two tiny lateral papillae {{on the floor of}} the mouth. The teeth are small and arranged into pavement-like surfaces. Five pairs of gill slits are located beneath the disc. The pelvic fins are small and narrow.|$|E
5|$|The {{pectoral}} fin disc {{of the plain}} maskray is thin and <b>diamond-shaped</b> with narrowly rounded outer corners, measuring 1.1–1.3 times longer than wide. The leading margins of the disc are gently concave and converge at a broad angle to the pointed tip of the snout. The small eyes are placed close together, and behind them are the spiracles. The nostrils are elongated and have a skirt-shaped flap of skin between them. The small mouth bears prominent furrows at the corners and contains two slender papillae on the floor. Small papillae are also found around {{the outside of the}} mouth. There are five pairs of gill slits. The pelvic fins are fairly large and pointed.|$|E
5|$|The sparsely-spotted stingaree, white-spotted stingaree, or Dixon's stingaree (Urolophus paucimaculatus) is {{a species}} of {{stingray}} in the family Urolophidae, common off the southern Australian coast. Preferring sandy flats and seagrass beds, this benthic ray can be found from close to shore {{to a depth of}} at least , and tends to occur deeper in the northern portion of its range. Reaching a length of , this species has a broad, <b>diamond-shaped</b> pectoral fin disc that is typically plain gray in color above with a V-shaped marking between the eyes. Individuals from southerly waters also generally exhibit a smattering of small, dark-edged white spots. This ray is further characterized by a distinctively bell-shaped curtain of skin between the nostrils. Its tail has a skin fold running along either side and a leaf-shaped caudal fin, but no dorsal fin.|$|E
5|$|Heavily {{built and}} {{characteristically}} smooth, the pectoral fin disc of the short-tail stingray has a rather angular, rhomboid shape and is slightly wider than long. The leading {{margins of the}} disc are very gently convex, and converge on a blunt, broadly triangular snout. The eyes are small and immediately followed by much larger spiracles. The widely spaced nostrils are long and narrow; between them is a short, skirt-shaped curtain of skin with a fringed posterior margin. The modestly sized mouth has an evenly arched lower jaw, prominent grooves at the corners, and 5–7 papillae (nipple-like structures) on the floor. Additional, tiny papillae are scattered on the nasal curtain and outside the lower jaw. The teeth are arranged with a quincunx pattern into flattened surfaces; each tooth is small and blunt, with a roughly <b>diamond-shaped</b> base. There are 45–55 tooth rows in either jaw. The pelvic fins are somewhat large and rounded at the tips.|$|E
5|$|St Mary's {{is built}} of ashlar buff and red {{sandstone}} quarried locally at Alderley Edge, and {{the roof is}} of Kerridge stone slates. Its plan consists of a tower at the west end, a four-bay nave with north and south aisles, a chancel with a vestry to its north, and a south porch. Over the north aisle is a dormer window. The tower has diagonal buttresses. Its west door has 14th-century mouldings and above the door is a three-light window. The stage above this contains ringers' windows on {{the north and west}} faces and a <b>diamond-shaped</b> clock on the south face. Above these the belfry windows on all faces have two lights. The top of the tower is embattled and contains the bases of eight pinnacles. Below the parapet is a string course with large grotesque gargoyles. At the west end of the nave roof is a bellcote. The Stanley pew projects to the east of the south porch. In the porch are grooves which were cut where arrows were sharpened.|$|E
5|$|The bluntnose {{stingray}} has a <b>diamond-shaped</b> {{pectoral fin}} disc about a sixth wider than long, with broadly rounded outer corners. The leading {{margins of the}} disc are nearly straight and converge {{at the tip of}} the snout at up to a 130° angle; the anterior disc shape distinguishes this species from the similar Atlantic stingray (D.sabina), which has a longer, more acute snout. The mouth is curved, with a central projection on the upper jaw that fits into an indentation on the lower jaw. There is a row of five papillae across the floor of the mouth, with the outermost pair smaller and set apart from the others. There are 36–50 upper tooth rows; the teeth have quadrangular bases and are arranged with a quincunx pattern into flattened surfaces. The tooth crowns are rounded in females and juveniles, while those of males in breeding condition are triangular and pointed. The pelvic fins are triangular with rounded tips.|$|E
5|$|The dorsal and pelvic fins are angular, {{with the}} first dorsal fin larger than the second. The {{pectoral}} fins are narrow, pointed, and falcate (sickle-shaped); their shape separates this species from the similar-looking nurse shark. The origin of the first dorsal fin is about even with {{the origin of the}} pelvic fins, while the origin of the anal fin is even with or somewhat behind the origin of the second dorsal fin. The caudal fin has a shallow upper lobe and barely present lower lobe, comprising {{about a quarter of the}} total length in adults. The dermal denticles are <b>diamond-shaped,</b> bearing 45 faint ridges radiating from a blunt point. Tawny nurse sharks are yellowish, reddish, or grayish brown above and off-white below, and are capable of slowly changing their color to better blend with the environment. Young sharks have starkly white lower eyelids.|$|E
5|$|The first {{dorsal fin}} is {{relatively}} small and usually originates behind the free rear tip of the pectoral fins. No ridge exists {{between the first and}} second dorsal fins. The pectoral fins are moderately short, narrow, and falcate (sickle-shaped). The body is densely covered with <b>diamond-shaped</b> dermal denticles with seven (rarely five) shallow horizontal ridges. The coloration is gray above, sometimes with a bronze sheen, and white below, with a faint white band on the sides. Young individuals have unmarked fins; the tips of the second dorsal fin, pectoral fins, anal fin, and lower caudal fin lobe (and sometimes the other fins, as well) are black in larger individuals. The spinner shark differs from the blacktip shark in that its first dorsal fin is slightly more triangular in shape and is placed further back on the body. Adults can also be distinguished by the black tip on the anal fin.|$|E
5|$|The large {{pectoral}} fins measure around one-fifth {{as long as}} the body, {{and have}} a falcate (sickle-like) shape tapering to a point. The first dorsal fin is of moderate size and somewhat falcate, with a pointed apex and a strongly concave rear margin; its origin lies over the pectoral fin free rear tips. The second dorsal fin is much smaller and is positioned about opposite the anal fin. A low dorsal ridge is present between the dorsal fins. The caudal fin is large and high, with a well-developed lower lobe and a ventral notch near the tip of the upper lobe. The dermal denticles are <b>diamond-shaped</b> and closely set, each bearing five horizontal ridges leading to teeth on the posterior margin. This species is bronzy to bluish gray above and white below, which extends onto the flanks as a faint lighter stripe. The fins, particularly the underside of the pectoral fins and the lower caudal fin lobe) darken towards the tips; this is more obvious in juveniles.|$|E
5|$|The {{pectoral}} fin disc of the reticulate whipray is <b>diamond-shaped</b> and wider than long, with the leading margins almost straight and the snout and outer corners angular. In juveniles, the disc {{is about as}} wide as long, with a more obtuse snout and rounded corners. The eyes are small and immediately followed by the spiracles (paired respiratory openings). A short and wide curtain of skin with a minutely fringed rear margin is present between the long, thin nostrils. The mouth is relatively small, with a deep concavity {{at the center of}} the lower jaw and shallow furrows at the corners extending onto the lower jaw. A row of 4–5 papillae (nipple-like structures) is found across the floor of the mouth. There are 26–40 upper tooth rows and 27–44 lower tooth rows. The pelvic fins are small and triangular. The tail is whip-like and extremely thin, measuring 3–3.5 times as long as the disc when intact, and lacks fin folds. Usually one serrated stinging spine is located on the upper surface on the tail, some distance from the base.|$|E
5|$|The {{peppered}} maskray has a thin, <b>diamond-shaped</b> {{pectoral fin}} disc roughly 1.2 times wider than long, with slightly concave leading margins and narrowly rounded outer corners. The snout forms an obtuse angle {{and has a}} pointed tip. The small, closely spaced eyes are followed by crescent-shaped spiracles. The nostrils are elongated and have a skirt-shaped curtain of skin between them; the posterior margin of the curtain is fringed and forms two lobes. The small mouth is surrounded by papillae and bears prominent furrows at the corners. There are two papillae {{on the floor of}} the mouth. The teeth number 33–38 rows in the upper jaw and 31–40 rows in the lower; the teeth are small and vary from pointed to blunt. The five pairs of gill slits are S-shaped. The pelvic fins are medium-sized and triangular with angular corners.|$|E
5|$|The sparsely-spotted {{stingray}} {{has a more}} or less <b>diamond-shaped</b> {{pectoral fin}} disc wider than long, with rounded outer corners. The anterior margins of the disc are nearly straight and converge at an obtuse angle on the fleshy snout, the tip of which barely protrudes from the disc. The small eyes are immediately followed by comma-shaped spiracles with angular or rounded posterior rims. The outer rim of each nostril is enlarged into a knob towards the back. Between the nostrils is a bell-shaped curtain of skin with a finely fringed trailing margin; only the Kapala stingaree (U.kapalensis) has a similarly shaped nasal curtain. The small mouth contains five or six papillae (nipple-like structures) on the floor, most of which have forked tips. Additional small papillae are present {{on the outside of the}} lower jaw. The teeth in both jaws are small with roughly oval bases, and are arranged in a quincunx pattern. The five pairs of gill slits are short. The pelvic fins are small and rounded.|$|E
5|$|Elephants {{usually have}} 26 teeth: the incisors, {{known as the}} tusks, 12 {{deciduous}} premolars, and 12 molars. Unlike most mammals, which grow baby teeth and then replace them with a single permanent set of adult teeth, elephants are polyphyodonts that have cycles of tooth rotation throughout their lives. The chewing teeth are replaced six times in a typical elephant's lifetime. Teeth are not replaced by new ones emerging from the jaws vertically as in most mammals. Instead, new teeth grow in {{at the back of}} the mouth and move forward to push out the old ones. The first chewing tooth on each side of the jaw falls out when the elephant is two to three years old. The second set of chewing teeth falls out when the elephant is four to six years old. The third set is lost at 9–15 years of age, and set four lasts until 18–28 years of age. The fifth set of teeth lasts until the elephant is in its early 40s. The sixth (and usually final) set must last the elephant the rest of its life. Elephant teeth have loop-shaped dental ridges, which are thicker and more <b>diamond-shaped</b> in African elephants.|$|E
5|$|Following {{this the}} commandos were used mainly as highly trained {{infantry}} units {{for the rest}} of their involvement in the North African campaign and for the majority of this time they were attached to the 36th Infantry Brigade. Over the course of the next five months the commandos were involved in a number of costly attacks and periods of static defence, in between which they carried out aggressive fighting patrols. Indicative of the nature of the fighting during this time was No. 6 Commando's attack on the Green Hill feature on 30 November 1942. The main attack was launched at 4:00am, as three troops—Nos. 3, 4 and 6 Troops—attacked from the north and west, while No. 5 Troop conducted a diversionary attack from the flank. As soon as the main force left its line of departure it came under intense oblique fire from interlocking medium and heavy machine guns positioned in a <b>diamond-shaped</b> perimeter on top of the hill. The fire was so intense that the troop providing support by fire on the flank was unable to suppress it and the attack was temporarily postponed until the afternoon when it was hoped that artillery support could be utilised.|$|E
5|$|The 2/48th Battalion {{was raised}} on 9 August 1940 at the Wayville Showgrounds, in Adelaide, {{under the command}} of Lieutenant Colonel Victor Windeyer, a former Militia officer who had {{previously}} commanded the Sydney University Regiment. A unit of the all-volunteer Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF), the 2/48th Battalion was formed specifically for service overseas and recruited mainly from the state of South Australia. The battalion's headquarters staff began arriving early in the month, with many of the key personnel having served previously in South Australian Militia units, including the 27th Battalion (South Australian Scottish Regiment). At the end of August, a large draft of recruits arrived from the 2nd Infantry Training Depot, and rudimentary individual training was undertaken in the nearby park lands. The colours initially chosen for the battalion's Unit Colour Patch (UCP) were the same as those of the 48th Battalion, a unit which had served during the First World War before being raised as a Militia formation in 1921. These colours were white over dark blue, in a circle shape, although a <b>diamond-shaped</b> border of gray was added to the UCP to distinguish the battalion from its Militia counterpart; this was later changed, though, following the unit's involvement in the fighting at Tobruk, when it adopted a 'T'-shaped UCP.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{surviving}} {{art from}} the Mesolithic period in Scotland, probably because the mobile peoples of the period would have made this on perishable organic items. Probably the oldest surviving portable visual art from Scotland are carved stone balls, or petrospheres, that date from the late Neolithic era. They are a uniquely Scottish phenomenon, with over 425 known examples. Most are from modern Aberdeenshire, {{but a handful of}} examples are known from Iona, Skye, Harris, Uist, Lewis, Arran, Hawick, Wigtownshire and fifteen from Orkney, five of which were found at the Neolithic village of Skara Brae. Many functions have been suggested for these objects, most indicating that they were prestigious and powerful possessions. Their production may have continued into the Iron Age. The complex carved circles and spirals on these balls can be seen mirrored in the carving on what was probably a lintel from a chambered cairn at Pierowall on Westray, Orkney, which seem {{to be part of the}} same culture that produced carvings at Newgrange in Ireland. Similarly, elaborately carved maceheads are often found in burial sites, like that found at Airdens in Sutherland, which has a pattern of interlocking <b>diamond-shaped</b> facets, similar to those found across Neolithic Britain and Europe.|$|E

25|$|Warning {{signs are}} <b>diamond-shaped</b> {{with a yellow}} {{background}} for permanent warnings, and an orange background for temporary warnings. They are somewhat more pictorial than their American counterparts. This is also true for Canadian signage.|$|E
25|$|Nearika {{are highly}} {{decorated}} ceremonial objects {{that can be}} circular or <b>diamond-shaped.</b> When Carl Lumholtz did his writing on the Huichol, he named the circular ones “frontal shields” and the <b>diamond-shaped</b> ones as “eyes” and giving rise {{to the concept of}} the “God's eyes,” applied to a Huichol cross. Nearika are tablets of wood or bamboo which are heavily decorated placed into certain sacred areas. Often they focus on a face of a sun, moon or person. From these the new tradition of yarn paintings developed, and the most traditional of these still show the round face of Tau, the Sun, in the middle.|$|E
25|$|Line-side signals give {{instructions}} or {{warnings to}} tram drivers. To distinguish them from normal road signs, they are <b>diamond-shaped.</b> The most common are speed restrictions {{which are in}} miles per hour. These are particularly necessary on road-running where trams travel along with road traffic.|$|E
25|$|Immediately to {{the north}} of the {{cantonment}} of Khaqan 'Urtuj was a second, <b>diamond-shaped</b> area. This cantonment is tentatively identified as al-Waziriyya, containing the Waziri palace built by Abu al-Wazir. Like the cantonment of Khaqan 'Urtuj, it may have served as housing for the caliphal servants.|$|E
25|$|Warning {{signs are}} very similar to warning signs in United States. They are yellow <b>diamond-shaped</b> with a black symbol (the yellow colour is changed to an orange colour in areas under construction).
