The <b>gas-lifted</b> oil wells may be open-loop unstable. The regulatory layer stabilizes the system by cascade control of wellhead pressure measurements without needing bottom hole sensing devices. An economic Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) based on the Multiple Shooting (MS) formulation is applied for optimization of the network operations. The optimization layer thus provides optimal settings for the regulatory controllers. The control structure has been validated by using the realistic OLGA simulator as the process, and using simplified models for Kalman filtering and the NMPC design.

50|$|In the United States, {{gas lift}} {{is used in}} 10% of the oil wells that have {{insufficient}} reservoir pressure to produce the well. In the petroleum industry, the process involves injecting gas through the tubing-casing annulus. Injected gas aerates the fluid to reduce its density; the formation pressure is then able to lift the oil column and forces the fluid out of the wellbore. Gas may be injected continuously or intermittently, depending on the producing characteristics of the well and {{the arrangement of the}} <b>gas-lift</b> equipment.|$|E

These confirmed {{the presence of a}} large accumulation, estimated at that time to be similar to today’s figure at around 900 MMstb in-place. Attempts to <b>gas-lift</b> the 9/3-1 well failed due to the viscous nature of the Bentley crude, whilst an attempt to flow 9/3-2A using a downhole pump failed due to mechanical reasons.|$|E

This {{is a growing concern}} as offshore wells are drilled thousands of meters below the ocean floor in extreme temperature and pressure conditions and repair and monitoring become more difficult. Gas lift valves and oil well systems have been modeled but system failure modes are not well understood. In this paper a quasi-steady-state fluid-mechanical model is constructed to study failure modes and sensitivities of a <b>gas-lifted</b> well system including the reservoir, two-phase flow within the tubing, and gas lift valve geometry. A set of three differential algebraic equations of the system is solved to determine the system state. Gas lift valve, two-phase flow, and reservoir models are validated with well and experimental data. Sensitivity analysis is performed on the model and sensitive parameters are identified. Failure modes of the system and parameter values that lead to failure modes are identified using Monte Carlo simulation.

50|$|The terms {{acid egg}} and {{montejus}} (or monte-jus) are sometimes used interchangeably {{to refer to}} a device with no moving parts formerly used instead of a pump in order to transfer difficult liquids. The principle is that a strong vessel containing the liquid is pressurized with gas or steam, forcing the liquid into a pipe (usually vertical upwards) thereby causing flow. When the liquid has been transferred, the pressure is released and more liquid is put in via gravity. It is thus cyclic in operation. The same principle has been used to lift water and called an air displacement pump or intermittent <b>gas-lift</b> pump, and has been applied to pumping oil up from the formation.Its use has largely been superseded by modern pumps, but it is still used sometimes for special tasks.|$|E

40|$|In <b>gas-lifted</b> oil fields, high {{pressure}} gas is injected {{at the bottom}} of the well production tubing to artificially lift oil up to surface facilities. Lift-gas should enter each well at a given mass flow and pressure, giving rise to the problem of deciding which compressors (facilities) should be installed and how they should supply the demands of the wells (clients). This compressor scheduling problem is a mixed-integer, nonconvex, nonlinear program-ming problem that generalizes the facility location problem. By piecewise-linearizing the performance curve of each compressor—a function relating output mass flow and discharge pressure, the problem is recast as a mixed-integer linear program.

40|$|Optimal {{production}} in oil fields entails allocating a limited rate of high-pressure gas to <b>gas-lifted</b> wells, while respecting injection bounds and activation precedence constraints. This task {{gives rise to}} the lift-gas allocation problem under precedence constraints. Despite the long interest in lift-gas allocation problems, most of the literature lacks rigor and does not deliver global optimization algorithms, to a great extent due to the non-linear response of oil wells to lift-gas injection and the discrete decisions on the activation of the wells. This paper contributes to the literature by proposing a piecewise-linear reformulation, thereby rendering a mixed-integer linear programming problem that allows the application of powerful integer programming algorithms. Following a comprehensive literature review, the paper develops valid and facet-defining inequalities from knapsack covers, for which exact and approximate lifting procedures are developed.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Gas lift {{allocation}} can {{be modeled}} as a nonlinear programming problem in which adjusting optimum gas injection rates and compressor pressure maximize the oil rate or other objective functions. This study describes a nonlinear programming approach to maximize daily cash flow of some <b>gas-lifted</b> wells in an uncertain condition for oil price. First, some solution points of each well are obtained by employing a production simulation software. Then, {{by use of}} nonlinear optimization, a model is developed for gas lift performance in each well. Then these functions are used to develop a model under capacity, pressure and other real constraints for the cash flow of production from these wells. Oil price is assumed as a triangle risk function in this model. Results show {{a significant increase in}} cash flow in comparison with old case due to appropriate gas injection parameters. Sensitivity analysis on this problem shows that oil price, compression cost and water−oil ratio variations should be considered in the long term optimization. 1...|$|R
40|$|Production {{optimization}} of <b>gas-lifted</b> {{oil fields}} under facility, routing, and pressure constraints has {{attracted the attention}} of researchers and practitioners for its scientific challenges and economic impact. The available methods fall into one of two categories: nonlinear or piecewise-linear approaches. The nonlinear methods optimize simulation models directly or use surrogates obtained by curve fitting. The piecewise-linear methods represent the nonlinear functions using a convex combination of sample points, thereby generating a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problem. The nonlinear methods rely on compact models, but can get stuck in local minima, whereas the piecewise-linear methods can reach globally optimal solutions, but their models tend to get very large. This work combines these methods, whereby piecewise-linear models are used to approximate production functions, which are then composed with convex-quadratic models that approximate pressure drops. The end result is a Mixed-Integer Convex Programming (MICP) problem which is more compact than the MILP model and for which globally optimal solutions can be reached...|$|R

40|$|Master's thesis in Petroleum engineeringThe J-shaped <b>gas-lift</b> well showed complex dynamic phenomena. The {{downward}} inclination of the J-shaped well introduces periodic waves {{over time}} {{as a result of}} mixing gas and liquid. This behavior introduces periodic fluctuations of the superficial gas and liquid velocities along tubing. The velocity fluctuation is due to the accumulation of liquid in the heel of the inclined section of J-shaped well and the development of reservoir gas pressure to overcome the accumulated liquid column making the J-shaped <b>gas-lift</b> well to be prone to production under slugging regime. The investigation here is addressing two aspects with the objective to optimize the <b>gas-lift</b> performance.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} mainly {{investigates the}} occurrence {{and characteristics of}} density-wave instability in <b>gas-lift</b> wells. The investigation {{is based on a}} simplified <b>gas-lift</b> system, in which water and air are used as producing fluid and lifting gas respectively, and heat transfer effect is neglected. To carry out the investigation, both linear stability analysis and numerical simulation are performed. The linear stability analysis is based on a homogenous two-phase flow model and the numerical simulation is done by using a commercial available dynamic multiphase flow simulator. In this way, a crosscheck between the two methods can be made in order to gain confidence about the results. Both two methods are validated against casing heading problem before they are applied to density-wave instability study. The results show that it is possible for density-wave instability to occur in those <b>gas-lift</b> wells producing from depleted reservoirs. The linear stability analysis and numerical simulation give the similar parametric trend in characterizing the instability. Within the normal <b>gas-lift</b> operation parameter range, increasing reservoir pressure and gas injection rate increases stability, but increasing tubing diameter, productivity index and system pressure decreases stability. The instability may occur only when the well loses its capability of natural flowing. Dynamic simulation also shows that the average production rate could be significantly reduced due to the unstable <b>gas-lift</b> compared with the steadystate prediction. An attempt of using feedback control to stabilize the <b>gas-lift</b> system is also tested by using the simulator.

30|$|This paper {{presents}} an integrated approach for scheduling and forecasting {{oil and gas}} production by integrating models of the entire value chain, from the reservoirs to the sales points. The methodology ensures maximum oil production at each time step of the reservoir simulator while honoring all operational constraints of the system. The proposed method is applied to a small North Sea offshore field consisting of two oil reservoirs with API gravities of 37 and 39. 3 <b>gas-lifted</b> wells are producing in each reservoir. They are arranged in a production network connected to a surface process. Control variables include individual well choke opening (early stage) and gas lift injection rate (later stage). The system is subject to numerous operational constraints (e.g., maximum field liquid production, maximum gas lift injection rate). The proposed solution is built in a commercial IAM platform that connects the models and orchestrates the software execution and optimization. The optimization problem is formulated as a Mixed Integer Linear Program. The well and flowline performance curves are approximated with piecewise linear functions. Results show that such an integrated approach can significantly affect the production profile (up to 15 % difference against traditional “silo” approach). The proposed integrated solution is two-to-three times faster than traditional non-linear optimization methods, guarantees convergence towards the global maximum and it represents with an appropriate level of accuracy the original black-box model. This allows to run a lot of different scenarios making it a suitable tool for field development and planning optimization. The proposed method is used to optimize the field design and schedule. Optimal surface capacities are determined by brute force exploration of net present value function.|$|R

One failure mode occurs when the GLV check valve fails and product passes into the well an-nulus, potentially reaching the wellhead. This is a growing con-cern as offshore wells are drilled thousands of meters below the ocean floor in extreme temperature and pressure conditions and repair and monitoring become difficult. The authors have pre-viously developed a thermally-actuated safety valve to prevent product backflow into the annulus {{in the event of}} check valve failure. The safety valve uses shape memory alloy (SMA) wires to translate a temperature change into a displacement and, based on commercially available SMA wire material properties, re-quires a 6 ◦C temperature change to fully actuate. In some wells, however, check valve failure may result in less than 6 ◦C tem-perature change. In this paper a new concept is developed to sharpen the austenitic phase change in SMA actuators. The concept has broad practical implications because it will allow thermally-activated devices, such as fluid control valves, to be-come much more precise, i. e., translating a small temperature change into a large displacement. The new concept uses the fact that SMA transition temperatures are stress dependent. By specifically controlling stress in the wire, the temperature differ-ence required for austenitic transition can be decreased. This is achieved with a negative-differential spring- a spring that ex-erts a decreasing amount of force as it is displaced. The concept is tested experimentally by conductively and electrically heating SMA wires connected to a negative-differential spring.

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. This experimental study investigates the effects of inclination angle and fluid viscosity on zero net liquid flow (ZNLF). Predicting liquid holdup under ZNLF conditions is necessary in several types of petroleum industry operations. These include the estimation of bottomhole pressures in pumping oil wells, design and operation of <b>gas-lifted</b> wells, and the design of compact Gas-Liquid Cylindrical Cyclone (?GLCC) separators. The flow distribution coefficient, C[], draws special attention to the research because its behavior influences flow pattern transitions in multiphase flow and in ZNLF. Data was collected using a 2 -inch diameter, 10 -foot swiveling transparent pipe. A test matrix was constructed where a series of gas flow rates at low pressures were investigated for the following inclination angles: 90 ?, 70 ?, and 50 ?. These tests were repeated for all the angles for a fluid of 1, 40, and 124 cps. The results indicate a tendency of decreasing ZNLF liquid holdup as the inclination angle is lowered below 70 ? for higher viscosities. The trend suggests that the flow distribution coefficient, C[], varies with fluid viscosity and inclination angle, therefore affecting the liquid holdup in the pipe. A new model is proposed to take into account these factors and its performance estimates zero net liquid holdup with a 23 % maximum percentage error. Further study is recommended in order to establish the results for inclination angles below 50 ?...|$|R
40|$|The {{contributions}} of this thesis {{are in the}} area of control of systems with nonlinear dynamics. The thesis is divided into three parts. The two first parts are similar {{in the sense that they}} both consider output feedback of rather general classes of nonlinear systems, and both approaches are based on mathematical programming (although in quite different ways). The third part contains a state feedback approach for a specific system class, and is more application oriented. The first part treats control of systems described by nonlinear difference equations, possibly with uncertain terms. The system dynamics are represented by piecewise affine difference inclusions, and for this system class, piecewise affine controller structures are suggested. Controller synthesis inequalities for such controller structures are given in the form of Bilinear Matrix Inequalities (BMIs). A solver for the BMIs is developed. The main contribution is to the output feedback case, where an observer-based controller structure is proposed. The theory is exemplified through two examples. In the second part the output feedback problem is examined in the setting of Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC). The state space formulation of NMPC is inherently a state feedback approach, since the state is needed as initial condition for the prediction in the controller. Consequently, for output feedback it is natural to use observers to obtain estimates of the state. A high gain observer is applied for this purpose. It is shown that for several existing NMPC schemes, the state feedback stability properties ``semiglobally'' hold in the output feedback case. The theory is illuminated with a simple example. Finally, a state feedback controller for a class of positive systems is proposed. Convergence of the state to a certain subset of the first orthant, corresponding to a constant ``total mass'' (interpreting states as masses) is obtained. Conditions are given under which convergence to this set implies asymptotic stability of an equilibrium. Simple examples illustrate some properties of the controller. Furthermore, the control strategy is applied to the stabilization of a <b>gas-lifted</b> oil well, and simulations on a rigorous multi-phase dynamic simulator of such a well demonstrate the controller performance. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|R
40|$|This thesis covers {{methods for}} {{optimization}} of oil production in three time-scales. In the long-term perspective, years, it is desired {{to maximize the}} economic return of the field operation, or alternatively, it is desired to maximize the oil recovery factor. In the middleterm perspective, days, optimal scheduling and allocation of the production facilities are desired. In the short-term perspective, minutes, it is desired to maintain the process operating at a stable optimal set-point. The integration of the optimization solutions that tackle each of the layers independently is a formidable challenge. This requires the development of mathematical models and efficient optimization algorithms to deliver solutions in real-time. This research focuses on efficient optimization algorithms and suitable simulation models for oil production optimization. The {{emphasis is on the}} integration of the decision process for different time-scales. To this end, this research studies each individual time-scale and proposes tools that lead to the desired integration. The work is divided into five parts. Chapter 2 formulates and solves the reservoir control optimization problem applying the direct multiple shooting (MS) method. This method divides the prediction horizon into smaller intervals which can be evaluated in parallel. Further, output constraints are easily established on each interval boundary and as such hardly affect computation time. This opens new opportunities to include state constraints on a much broader scale than what is common in reservoir optimization today. However, multiple shooting deals with a large number of variables since it decides on the boundary state variables of each interval. Therefore, we exploit the structure of the reservoir simulator to conceive a variable reduction technique to solve the optimization problem with a reduced sequential quadratic programming algorithm. We discuss the optimization algorithm building blocks and focus on structure exploitation and parallelization opportunities. To demonstrate the method’s capabilities to handle output constraints, the optimization algorithm is interfaced to an open-source reservoir simulator. Then, based on a widely used reservoir model, we evaluate performance, especially related to output constraints. The performance of the proposed method is qualitatively compared to a conventional method. Chapter 3 solves a black-oil reservoir optimal control problem with MS. The black-oil fluid model, considering volatile oil or wet gas, requires a change of primary variables for simulation. This is a consequence of the absence of a fluid phase due to dissolution or vaporization. Therefore, reservoir simulators parametrize the states with an augmented vector and select primary variables accordingly. However, the augmented state vector and the corresponding change of primary variables are not suitable for the application of MS because the optimization problem formulation must change according to the change of variables. Thus, we propose a minimal state-space variable representation that prevents this shortcoming. We show that there is a bijective mapping between the proposed state-space representation and the augmented state-space. The minimal representation is used for optimization and the augmented representation for simulation, thereby keeping the simulator implementation unchanged. Therefore, the proposed solution is not invasive. Finally, the application of the method is exemplified with benchmark cases involving live oil or wet gas. Both examples emphasize the requirement of output constraints which are efficiently dealt by the MS method. The production life of oil reservoirs starts under significant uncertainty regarding the actual economical return of the recovery process {{due to the lack of}} oil field data. Consequently, investors and operators make management decisions based on a limited and uncertain description of the reservoir. Chapter 4 proposes a new formulation based on MS for robust optimization of reservoir well controls. This formulation exploits coherent risk measures, a concept traditionally used in finance, to deal with the uncertainty. A variable elimination procedure allows to solve this problem in a reduced space and an active-set method helps to handle a large set of inequality constraints. Finally, we demonstrate the application of constraints to limit the risk of water production peaks on a standard test case. Chapter 5 addresses the middle-term perspective and develops a framework for integrated production optimization of complex oil fields such as Petrobras’ Urucu field, which has a gathering system with complex routing degree of freedom, limited processing capacity, pressure constraints, and wells with gas-coning behavior. The optimization model integrates simplified well deliverability models, vertical lift performance relations, and the flowing pressure behavior of the surface gathering system. The framework relies on analytical models which are history matched to field data and simulators tuned to reflect operating conditions. A Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problem is obtained by approximating these models with piecewise-linear functions. Procedures are developed to obtain simplified piecewise-linear approximations that ensure a given accuracy with respect to complex and precise models. Computational experiments show that the integrated production optimization problem can be solved sufficiently fast for real-time applications. Further, the operational conditions calculated with the simplified models during the optimization process match the precise models. Chapter 6 studies the short-term problem and presents control and optimization of a network consisting of two <b>gas-lifted</b> oil wells, a common pipeline-riser system and a separator. The <b>gas-lifted</b> oil wells may be open-loop unstable. The regulatory layer stabilizes the system by cascade control of wellhead pressure measurements without needing bottom hole sensing devices. An economic Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) based on MS is applied for optimization of the network operations. The optimization layer thus provides optimal settings for the regulatory controllers. The control structure has been validated by using the realistic OLGA simulator as the process, and using simplified models for Kalman filtering and the NMPC design. The simplified models are implemented in Modelica and fit to the OLGA model to represent the main dynamics of the system. The proposed two-layer controller was able to stabilize the system and increase the economical outcome...|$|R
