2500|$|In 2007, Sharpton said {{he would}} handle the case the same today, with the only {{difference}} being {{that he would not}} have made it so personal against Pagones. He said that he still felt Brawley had a good case to go to trial, saying in an interview: [...] "I disagreed with the grand jury on Brawley. I believed there was enough evidence to go to trial. Grand jury said there wasn't. Okay, fine. <b>Do</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> right to disagree with the grand jury? Many Americans believe O.J. Simpson was guilty. A jury said he wasn't. So I have as much right to question a jury as they do. Does it make somebody a racist? No! They just disagreed with the jury. So did I." ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{a social}} visit to Cardiff in 1982, he was {{introduced}} to a pharmacy on City Road and {{decided that he would}} rather run his own business rather than work for someone else. Resigning from Boots, he bought this first shop. Over the next decade, Aggarwal built up a chain of six pharmacies, and a significant business, in and around Cardiff. In 2008 Central Pharmacy, which Aggarwal still owns and operates, was awarded the Best in UK Clarins Gold Salons Award. He believes the key to good business is in customer service, telling Pharmacy Business (9 March 2011): [...] "I enjoy what I <b>do.</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> lot of happiness in what we achieve. I've always had a strong head for business and I enjoy leadership and keeping customer service levels high. We want to make customers feel how we would want to feel." ...|$|E
2500|$|Giladi relates that {{he became}} politicized after an {{experience}} at the Socialist/Zionist party headquarters. He had received a letter asking for help with their Arabic newspaper, and {{when he showed up}} at the headquarters and tried to show them the letter, he was dismissively told to report to the [...] "Department for Jews from Islamic Countries" [...] by many people who had not even looked at his letter to see why he had been invited. He says that he [...] "was disgusted and angry. Either I am a member of the party or I'm not. <b>Do</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> different ideology or different politics because I am an Arab Jew? It's segregation, I thought, just like a Negroes' Department. I turned around and walked out. That was the start of my open protests. That same year I organized a demonstration in Ashkelon against Ben-Gurion's racist policies and 10,000 people turned out." ...|$|E

[...] "Blame my blindness, dear, don't blame me. If I could only see--! Ah, how can I make you {{understand}} me, you who don't live in the dark?"

6000|$|... "Heavens and earth, no!" [...] cried Arthur in a {{storm of}} passion. [...] "Not for the wide world will I consent to any {{mutilation}} of her dead body.

6000|$|... "Do not let us wrangle of this matter," [...] said Deleroy. [...] "A man who {{mixes with}} the world like yourself, Master merchant, will know that women in a trap rarely lack excuses. Still if it be {{admitted}} that this marriage did not fulfil all formalities, then {{so much the better}} for Blanche and myself. If she be your lawful wife and not mine, you, I learn, have signed a writing in her favour under which she will inherit your great wealth. That indenture I think you can find no opportunity to dispute, and if you <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> promise that the property of a certain traitor shall pass to me, the revealer of his treachery.

6000|$|Again Hawtrey {{showed a}} certain embarrassment.

6000|$|... "You think I {{write these}} letters--these short stories, these three-act plays--on purpose to annoy you. Do {{let me try}} to get the idea out of your head.

I may jump before I am blown up. But I don’t see that it makes much difference what I <b>do.</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> fair chance of life either way. If our dingy gets shot to pieces we shall then try to swim for the beach right under Morro Castle. We shall keep together at all hazards. Then we may be able to make our way alongside, and perhaps get back to the ship. We shall fight the sentries or a squad until the last, and shall only surrender to overwhelming numbers, and our surrender will only take place as a last and almost uncontemplated emergency.” ...|$|E
