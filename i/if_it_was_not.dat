Any proposed motion could be vetoed by a tribune, and <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> vetoed, it was then turned into a final senatus consultum.

5|$|By {{the time}} Rosenborg had {{qualified}} for the 1995–96 UEFA Champions League, UEFA had for security reasons introduced restrictions which reduced Lerkendal's capacity to 12,200 spectators. In addition, a total ban on standing places would be introduced from 1997. In 1995, a debate arose between Rosenborg and Trondheim Municipality regarding {{the construction of a}} new grandstand, to be located on the north side of the stadium. Rosenborg's Nils Skutle stated that <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> built ahead of the 1997–98 season, Rosenborg would only be allowed to sell 2,800 tickets to their home Champions League matches, and that they instead would be forced to play their games at Ullevaal Stadion in Oslo. The new grandstand cost 32 million, and opened in 1996 season. The upgrades also included a new floodlight and public announcement system.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the success}} of Halloween, Yablans and Akkad began working on Halloween II. There was initial {{discussion}} about filming Halloween II in 3-D, but the idea never came to fruition. After Halloween II was released, Carpenter and Hill were approached about creating a third Halloween film, but they were reluctant to pledge commitment. The pair {{agreed to participate in}} the new project only <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> a direct sequel to Halloween II, which meant no Michael Myers. Most of the filming for Halloween III took place on location in the small coastal town of Loleta in Humboldt County, California. Familiar Foods, a milk bottling plant in Loleta, served as the Silver Shamrock Novelties factory, but all special effects involving fire, smoke, and explosions were filmed at Post Studios.|$|E

5|$|In 2000, Ullevaal Stadion AS {{bought the}} West Stand, {{including}} the commercial areas. In March 2001, NFF gave Lyn a loan for NOK12.5 million, {{on the condition}} that <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> paid back within two years, NFF would take over Lyn's ownership in the stadium. This made it possible for Lyn to pay their investment company back the debt for the loan, which had increased to this amount in five years, and to purchase the stadium and secure NFF the right of pre-emption. On 4 July 2002, Lyn and NFF announced that NFF would make a private placement of NOK27 million in Ullevaal Stadion AS {{and at the same time}} terminate Lyn's debt. In exchange, Lyn's ownership was reduced to 15%.|$|E
5|$|With Jacksonville's {{future as}} host in doubt, representatives from Charlotte, North Carolina, Tampa, Florida, and Jacksonville visited the ACC offices to lobby {{to host the}} 2008 game. Orlando, Florida, which had been an early {{contender}} to host the 2008 game, was eliminated from consideration before the meetings took place. As kickoff drew closer, the Gator Bowl Association expressed displeasure with the poor ticket sales, saying that nearly 20,000tickets remained unsold as of {{the week of the}} game and that <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> a sellout, the game would likely not remain in Jacksonville.|$|E

An example of an error of this nature {{can be found in the}} United Kingdom case White & Collins v. Minister of Health (1939). In that case, under the relevant statute, the authority could only issue a compulsory purchase order affecting the applicants' land <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> part of, among other things, a park. A minister confirmed the purchase order but the Court of Appeal of England and Wales held that it should be quashed, finding that the minister could not exercise power to acquire the land since it was part of a park. Whether the land was or was not a park was {{a precedent}} fact, and the minister had committed an error concerning this fact.|$|E

5|$|General Douglas MacArthur, the {{commander}} of Allied forces in the SWPA, decided on 6June to postpone the Selaru operation until after Allied forces landed in the Philippines. This was not communicated to No.80 Wing, however, and Caldwell continued to develop plans for its involvement in the Selaru operation until late August. The effective cancellation of the operation left No.80 Wing without a clear mission, and its pilots were left {{with nothing to do}} other than train. In September Air Commodore Alan Charlesworth, {{the commander}} of North-Western Area, reported to Bostock that the wing's morale could drop <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> either given an active role or transferred to southern Australia. During the same period No.80 Wing's pilots observed that No.1 Wing's Spitfires were making occasional strafing attacks on Japanese positions in the NEI and sought approval to conduct similar operations. Caldwell did not agree to this, however, as be believed that the risks associated with flying Spitfires to the edge of their range to attack unimportant targets outweighed any benefits to morale.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, the Ramones {{released}} ¡Adios Amigos!, their fourteenth studio album, {{and announced}} that they planned to disband <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> successful. Its sales were unremarkable, garnering it just two weeks on {{the lower end of}} the Billboard chart. The band spent late 1995 on what was promoted as a farewell tour. However, they accepted an offer to appear in the sixth Lollapalooza festival, which toured around the United States during the following summer. After the Lollapalooza tour's conclusion, the Ramones played their final show on August 6, 1996, at the Palace in Hollywood. A recording of the concert was later released on video and CD as We're Outta Here!. In addition to a reappearance by Dee Dee, the show featured several guests including Motörhead's Lemmy, Pearl Jam's Eddie Vedder, Soundgarden's Chris Cornell, Numskull's Ralph Foster and Rancid's Tim Armstrong and Lars Frederiksen.|$|E
5|$|In September 1944, Cole handed NWA over to Air Commodore Alan Charlesworth. At {{this stage}} of the war, the Allies were {{advancing}} north and the tempo of operations in the Darwin area had decreased. Charlesworth raised concerns regarding No.80 Wing, warning higher command that its morale would drop <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> either given {{a more active role in}} the war or transferred to southern Australia for rest. By October, the wing had received orders to depart NWA for Morotai to join the First Tactical Air Force; this left NWA with twelve squadrons at its disposal, including one Liberator unit and three other Spitfire squadrons. In the meantime, NWA supported the assault on Leyte with attacks on enemy ports, oil facilities, and shipping in the Dutch East Indies using Beaufighters, Mitchells, and Liberators. These operations continued through November and December. By then, NWA headquarters staff numbered 651, including 156 officers.|$|E

5|$|Jun Maeda, {{the main}} {{scenario}} writer of Air, commented {{that in the}} early stages of Air production, it was already decided that it was to be an adult game, and he further assumes that <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> at least first released with adult content, that it would not have been as commercially successful. Maeda also commented that he wanted to write Air to give players the chance to experience the entire story as a whole rather than just a sum of differing parts as typical bishōjo games do, including Kanon. While attempting to do this, Maeda also tried to simultaneously make it seem similar to typical visual novels in the same genre as Air to give the game appeal to the players who often play such games. As such, while the game incorporates stories from several characters, they are all of varying lengths.|$|E
5|$|The Expendables 2 {{contains}} approximately 1,547 {{digital effect}} shots. The main effects studio was Worldwide FX (WWFX), which produced 1,186 of the shots, and a further 800 shots which were discarded {{in response to}} changes to the film's story. Several other studios, including El Ranchito, Malditochrome, Tata Elxsi, Reliance Mediaworks, and , also produced effects shots for the film through WWFX. Digital effect pre-production began in July 2011 and was completed one year later. WWFX's primary facility is situated in Sofia, allowing them to have constant access to the production, and model assets of the sets before their practical versions were built; this enabled WWFX to raise issues relating to the designs early and develop an optimised construction plan. Anything that was considered to potentially need a computer generated double was photographed and digitally modeled even <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> scheduled {{to appear in the}} film, which later served useful as the film's story was adjusted, requiring WWFX to rebuild entire scenes.|$|E
5|$|During {{the night}} of May19 there were further discussions at Rodríguez Peña's house. Saavedra, called by Viamonte, joined the meeting, which {{involved}} military and civilian leaders. They arranged that Belgrano and Saavedra would meet with Juan José de Lezica, the senior alcalde (municipal magistrate), while Castelli would meet with the procurator Julián de Leiva, to ask for their support. They asked the Viceroy to allow an open cabildo, and said that <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> freely granted {{the people and the}} criollo troops would march to the Plaza, force the Viceroy to resign by any means necessary, and replace him with a patriot government. Saavedra commented to Lezica that he was suspected of betrayal because of his constant requests for cautious and measured steps. This comment was designed to pressure Lezica into speeding up the legal system to allow the people to express themselves, or otherwise risk a major rebellion. Lezica asked for patience and time to persuade the Viceroy, and leave a massive demonstration as a last resort. He argued that if the Viceroy was deposed in that way, it would constitute a rebellion, which would turn the revolutionaries into outlaws. Manuel Belgrano gave the following Monday as the deadline to confirm the open cabildo before taking direct action. Leiva would later act as a mediator, being both a confidante of Cisneros and a trusted negotiator for the more moderate revolutionaries.|$|E

5|$|From {{before midnight}} on 27 March, the tired 12th Brigade {{had been holding}} the railway line between Albert and Dernancourt, having {{relieved}} the 9th (Scottish) Division. The forward positions of the salient held by the 12th Brigade were along the railway line, which ran along a series of embankments and cuttings, up to but not including a railway bridge immediately northwest of Dernancourt where the Dernancourt–Laviéville road passed under the railway. A mushroom-shaped feature known as the Laviéville Heights overlooked the railway line, which curved around its foot. This was difficult ground to defend, particularly where the railway line curved and skirted the northwestern corner of Dernancourt, as if the line there was overrun, the enemy {{would be able to}} fire into the rear of the troops lined out along the railway in both directions. Despite this, the Australian commanders considered it important to hold the railway line; <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> garrisoned, the enemy could assemble in the dead ground behind the embankment. A further difficulty arose from the fact that if an attack occurred during daylight, it would be almost impossible to move troops down the exposed slopes to reinforce the railway line without crippling losses, and troops withdrawing from the railway line would be similarly exposed. To afford them some protection along the railway line, the forward posts dug one-man niches in the near side of the embankment, but the only way for them to fire was to climb up and lie on top of the embankment, thus exposing themselves to enemy fire.|$|E
5|$|The balloon {{had carried}} {{a lot of}} food, of a kind adapted more for a balloon voyage than for travels on foot. Andrée had {{reasoned}} that {{they might as well}} throw excess food overboard as sand, if losing weight was necessary; and <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not,</b> the food would serve if wintering in the Arctic desert did after all become necessary. There was therefore less ballast and large amounts of heavy-type provisions, 767kg (1690lb) altogether, including 200liters of water and some crates of champagne, port, beer, etc., donated by sponsors and manufacturers. There was also lemon juice, though not as much of this precaution against scurvy as other polar explorers usually thought necessary. Much of the food was in the form of cans of pemmican, meat, sausages, cheese, and condensed milk. By the time they crashed, they had thrown some of it overboard. The three men took most of the rest with them on leaving the crash site, along with other necessities such as guns, tent, ammunition, and cooking utensils, making a load on each sled of more than 200kg (440lb). This was not realistic, as it broke the sleds and wore out the men. After one week, they sorted out and left behind a big pile of food and non-essential equipment, bringing the loads down to 130kg per sled. It became more necessary than ever to hunt for food. They shot and ate seals, walruses, and especially polar bears throughout the march.|$|E
