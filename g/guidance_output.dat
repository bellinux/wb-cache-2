40|$|Onboard {{trajectory}} generation dispenses {{with the}} pre-defined trajectories used. in Reusable Launch Vehicle (RLV) guidance {{since the early}} days of the Shuttle era. This shift, enabled by a new breed of algorithms harnessing modern computer power, offers improvements in performance, robustness, operational cost, and safety. This thesis develops a set of algorithms providing onboard trajectory generation for low lift-over-drag gliding RLVs in subsonic flight below 40, 000 ft. The NASA/Orbital Sciences X- 34 is used as a representative model for which feasible trajectories are designed over a range of initial conditions without human intervention. In addition to being autonomous, the <b>guidance</b> <b>output</b> of the onboard trajectory generator differs from current Shuttle-based approaches, providing a realistic "future history" in a propagated plan, rather than output commands reacting to perceived instantaneous vehicle needs. Hence, this approach serves an enabling role in a larger research effort to develop a next generation guidance system using an integrated control function. To assess feasibility, the onboard trajectory generator is benchmarked against traditional X- 34 guidance for a drop test scenario. The results match in basic form, with differences showcasing the autonomous algorithms' preference for maximum robustness. The true strength of the onboard trajectory generator lies in its ability to handle off-nominal conditions. A series of test cases highlight the ability of the algorithms to effectively cope with anomalous initial drop conditions, reach the desired terminal states, and provide maximum late-trajectory robustness. Computation time is sufficiently brief to suggest a real-time application, after straightforward improvements are made. by André R. Girerd. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|There {{has been}} a steep growth, {{throughout}} the World, in civilian UAV applications. UAVs offer cost effective alternatives for many applications, as they enable objectives be carried out without the risk to pilots. In terms of crop surveillance, they offer a cheap alternative to satellite and manned aerial imagery. These current techniques are limited due to cloud cover, and poor image capture resolution. By flying a UAV at low altitudes, these limitations may be greatly reduced. With the recent financial commitment from the Queensland State Government, to the funding of a UAV research and development facility, the future of UAV technology and its potential market is being recognized. Current UAV navigation and guidance packages on the market are prohibitively expensive. This paper describes the design and implementation of a cheap navigation and user interface for the specific purpose of carrying out surveillance over a pre-determined flight path in a UAV. The system has been designed assuming a suitable automatic flight control system is available, for receipt of the <b>guidance</b> <b>outputs...</b>|$|R
40|$|Onboard {{trajectory}} generation capability greatly increases {{an autonomous}} reusable launch vehicle's capacity for recovering from unexpected disturbances or anomalous conditions. Such capability dispenses with {{the routine of}} pre-defined, mission specific trajectories and contingencies, {{which has been in}} use {{since the early days of}} the Shuttle. Newer guidance techniques, employing modem computing power and faster algorithms, can therefore provide savings in both operational cost and design time, while enhancing both mission robustness and efficiency. Weaknesses in the current Terminal Area Energy Management phase guidance scheme are identified and shown to be remedied with an onboard trajectory generator. Subsequently, new methodologies are presented as well as an approach to attaining onboard trajectory generation capability using the NASA/Orbital X- 34 gliding reentry vehicle as the representative testbed model. The approach utilizes the full nonlinear equations of motion to rapidly generate 3 - degrees-of-freedom descent trajectories for a low lift over drag, gliding reusable launch vehicle from any portion of the Terminal Area Energy Management flight regime to the AutoLanding Interface. Full coupling of the longitudinal and lateral aspects, as well as actual vehicle dynamic capabilities and constraints, will result in <b>guidance</b> <b>outputs</b> that are both realistic and flyable. Key technology components are identified and preliminary results and comparisons are presented. by Andrew C. Grubler. Thesis (S. M.)

In order to deliver C-IED capability, coherent and supporting Lines of Development (LoD) are required. Not least C-IED efforts must be appropriately organized, interoperable with other military allies and the host nation law enforcement, manned, equipped, sustained, educated in doctrine, and trained in tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to the level required for their operational role. This capability is developed from a mix of the military commander’s <b>guidance,</b> the <b>outputs</b> of the residual experience in the operational area, the lessons process, and technology and contributions from the other C-IED pillars. Commanders ideally ensure that intelligence on IEDs and related adversary TTPs are quickly disseminated and that friendly TTPs can be modified to be as up-to-date, appropriate and effective as possible.|$|R

[...] Development was by a team that included Donald H. Falkingham (who was awarded the Air Medal)http://www.worldwar2pilots.net/AAF-B-Falkingham-A20-1.htm that modified radar plotting to transmit control commands to the pilot direction indicator (bomb release was eventually automated from the ground radar). Similar to the ground training configuration in the US for bombardiers with the Norden bombsight, in a tent near the SCR-284 radar a bombsight was automatically positioned over a large map by the plotting signals converted from the radar track's spherical coordinates from the SCR-284 ranging and antenna pointing circuits. The <b>guidance</b> signals <b>output</b> from the moving bombsight as it viewed the map were then relayed to the aircraft as if the bombsight were on board (e.g., to a 1945 AN/ARA-17 Release Point Indicator).|$|R

40|$|This paper proposes an {{automatic}} {{traffic sign recognition}} method based on saliency-enhanced feature and SVMs. As when human observe a traffic sign, a two-stage procedure is performed by first locating the region of sign according to its unique shape and color, and second paying attention to content inside the sign. The proposed saliency feature extraction attempts to resemble these two processing stages. We model the first stage via extracting salient regions of signs from detected bounding boxes contributed by sign detector. Salient region extraction is formed as an energy propagation process on local structured graph. The second stage is modeled by exploiting a non-linear color mapping under the <b>guidance</b> of the <b>output</b> of the first stage. As results, salient signature inside a sign is popped up and can be directly used by subsequent SVMs for classification. The proposed method is validated on Chinese traffic sign dataset that is incrementally built...|$|R
40|$|Curative factors or {{therapeutic}} events {{beneficial to}} group members {{are a major}} concern in group psychotherapy. Yalom (1975) writes extensively on curative factors in his well-known text. Corsini and Rosenberg (1955), {{in their study of}} 300 pre- 1955 articles, identified 175 statements which they subsumed under nine categories, or curative factors. Yalom and his colleagues (Liebermann et al., 1972; Yalom et al., 1967, 1975) researched the relative importance of curative factors as perceived by group members. Based partly on these works, Yalom identified 60 curative items which he clustered into 12 curative factor categories: altruism, group cohesiveness, uni-versality, interpersonal learning (input), interpersonal learning (<b>output),</b> <b>guidance,</b> catharsis, identification, family reenact-ment, self-understanding, instillation of hope, and existential factor. Subjects in the Yalom et al. study (1975) were well-educated, middle-socioeconomic-class outpatients in long-term therapy. Using the 60 items and a Q-sort method, group members ranked interpersonal learning (input), catharsis, and cohesiveness as the three important curative factors, and family reenactment, guidance, and identification as least important. Other researchers using Yalom’s method have reported similar findings with various kinds of groups in variou...|$|R

Left to right: the input chair model, Chopper’s partition (with a printing volume shown as a reference), printed parts, and assembled chair. 3 D printing technology is rapidly maturing and becoming ubiquitous. One of the remaining obstacles to wide-scale adoption is that the object to be printed must fit into the working volume of the 3 D printer. We propose a framework, called Chopper, to decompose a large 3 D object into smaller parts so that each part fits into the printing volume. These parts can then be assembled to form the original object. We formulate a number of desirable criteria for the partition, including assemblability, having few components, unobtrusiveness of the seams, and structural soundness. Chopper optimizes these criteria and generates a partition either automatically or with user <b>guidance.</b> Our prototype <b>outputs</b> the final decomposed parts with customized connectors on the interfaces.

40|$|The Drosophila midline is a {{critical}} intermediate target for navigating axons in the developing central nervous system. Several conserved families of guidance cues and their receptors, including the attractive cues Netrins and their DCC/Fra receptors and the repulsive cues Slits and their Robo receptors, regulate axon guidance at the midline. At the Drosophila midline, the Robo receptor functions to prevent ipsilateral axons from crossing the midline, and also to prevent post-crossing contralateral axons from re-crossing the midline. The Rho family GTPases—Rac, Rho and Cdc 42 —are key regulators of actin cytoskeletal reorganization during axon <b>guidance.</b> A major <b>output</b> of Robo downstream signaling is Slit mediated up-regulation of Rac activity. However, the link between Robo signaling and Rac activation remains unknown. In this thesis I identify CrossGAP (CrGAP), a Rac-specific GAP, as {{a link between the}} Robo receptor and Rac activation. I demonstrate that CrGAP is recruited to the plasma membrane by the Robo receptor and that Slit stimulation down-regulates the interaction between CrGAP and Robo. Our data suggest that Slit signaling down-regulates CrGAP function by regulating the subcellular localization of CrGAP, thereby up-regulating Rac activity to mediate axon repulsion. ...|$|R
50|$|For example, if an IMU {{installed}} in an aeroplane moving along a certain direction vector were to measure a plane's acceleration as 5 m/sec^2 for 1 sec, {{then after that}} 1 sec the guidance computer would deduce that the plane must be traveling at 5 m/sec and must be 2,5 m from its initial position (assuming v0=0 and known starting position coordinates x0, y0, z0). If combined with a mechanical paper map or a digital map archive (systems whose output is generally known as a moving map display since the <b>guidance</b> system position <b>output</b> is often taken as the reference point, resulting in a moving map), the guidance system could use this method to show a pilot where the plane is located geographically in a certain moment, as with a GPS navigation system — but without the need to communicate with or receive communication from any outside components, such as satellites or land radio transponders, though external sources are still used in order to correct drift errors, and since the position update frequency allowed by inertial navigation systems can be higher the vehicle motion on the map display can be perceived as smoother. This method of navigation is called dead reckoning.|$|R

The Microsoft' Health Common User Interface (MSCUI) programme, developed by Microsoft and the National Health Service (NHS) was born out of this need and creates guidance and controls designed to increase patient safety and clinical effectiveness through consistent interface treatments. Objective The Microsoft Health Patient Journey Demonstrator is a prototype tool designed to provide exemplar implementations of MSCUI guidance on a Microsoft platform. It is a targeted glimpse at a visual interface for the integration of health-relevant information, including electronic medical records. Method We built the demonstrator in Microsoft SilverlightTM 2, our application technology which brings desktop functionality and enriched levels of user experience to health settings worldwide via the internet. We based the demonstrator on an easily recognisable clinical scenario which offered us the most scope for demonstrating MSCUI <b>guidance</b> and innovation. <b>Output</b> The demonstrator is structured in three sections (administration, primary care and secondary care) each of which illustrates the activities associated within the setting relevant to our scenario.

40|$|This report {{outlines}} the findings and recommendations {{resulting from a}} national Quality Development Fund (QDF) project commissioned by the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) in July 2002. The aim {{of the project was}} to produce a development and training programme aimed at information advice and <b>guidance</b> (IAG) staff. <b>Outputs</b> from the project include a staff development framework on compact disk (CD), detailing the skills and knowledge required in various work areas within the IAG initiative and correlating these with specific training and development opportunities. This report also lists eight recommendations for further improvement put forward by the project team. This report is of interest to IAG managers and coordinators in local Learning and Skills Councils (local LSCs), IAG partnerships and other IAG organisations. The absence of a prescribed IAG staff development and competence model has meant that local partnerships have been empowered to come up with their own definitions of ‘competence’ and ‘experience’ locally. This flexibility has been enhanced by the promulgation of the matrix standard and its predecessor which state that ‘staff competence and the support they are given are sufficient to deliver the service’ but intentionally does not define what competencies are required to deliver IAG. The aim of this project was to develop a comprehensive competence-based training pack for IAG delivery staff, front-line and support staff in delivery organisations, IAG coordinators/ managers and LSC staff involved in the initiative...|$|R

This creates a problem, though. As the recurrent weights and topology are now separated from {{adapting to the}} task, there is a burden on the reservoir designer to construct an effective network that happens to produce state vectors that can be mapped linearly into the desired <b>outputs.</b> <b>Guidance</b> in forming a reservoir can be {{through the use of}} some established metrics which link a number of theoretical properties of the reservoir computing paradigm to quantitative measures {{that can be used to}} evaluate the effectiveness of a given design. We provide a comprehensive empirical study of four metrics; class separation, kernel quality, Lyapunov’s exponent and spectral radius. These metrics are each compared over a number of repeated runs, for different reservoir computing set-ups that include three types of network topology and three mechanisms of weight adaptation through synaptic plasticity. Each combination of these methods is tested on two time-series classification problems. We find that the two metrics that correlate most strongly with the classification performance are Lyapunov’s exponent and kernel quality. It is also evident in the comparisons that these two metrics both measure a similar property of the reservoir dynamics. We also find that class separation and spectral radius are both less reliable and less effective in predicting performance...|$|R
40|$|As {{part of the}} Serithi {{project a}} {{longitudinal}} study of HIV positive women diagnosed during pregnancy, support groups for HIV-positive women were established in Mamelodi and Atteridgeville (Tshwane). Eighty-eight women participated in these groups during 2005, with the groups being facilitated by Masters Psychology students. This study explores therapeutic processes in these support groups. Yalom’s therapeutic factors were used as the underlying theory. These are factors that Yalom advances as therapeutic processes in understanding group psychotherapy. The process notes of the Masters Student facilitators, together with the interviews that were conducted with the women after the support group experience, were analysed to identify therapeutic processes that manifested themselves in the support group experience. Qualitative methods were used to collect data and thematic analysis was utilised to analyse the data. The research results revealed that support groups are therapeutic, {{in the sense that}} ten of the twelve therapeutic factors advanced by Yalom proved to have been made manifest, or demonstrated, within these groups. These are: altruism, group cohesion, interpersonal learning input, interpersonal learning <b>output,</b> <b>guidance,</b> identification, family re-enactment, instillation of hope and existential factors. The women reported having felt a sense of relief from being {{part of a group of}} people who experienced similar issues. They also reported that they learnt from each other. This gave them hope and an understanding that, even though there may be people going through the same problems as they are, they still need to face life alone. The women reported feeling a sense of self-worth from helping others, which contributed to rebuilding their self-esteem. These results indicate that support groups can be therapeutic for the people involved. They can be used to guide support group facilitators with regards to what to look for when facilitating groups. They can also assist policy makers in developing guidelines for the facilitation of support groups in order for the participants to obtain maximum benefit from their support group experience.

40|$|The first {{paper of}} this thesis (Chapter 2) explores how {{expectations}} of inflation and output {{are influenced by}} central bank forward guidance within a learning [...] to [...] forecast laboratory macroeconomic environment. Subjects are incentivized to forecast the output gap and inflation. An automated central bank forms projections about the economy assuming subjects form expectations following the REE solution. The central bank communicates output and/or inflation projections, interest rate projections, or no information. Communicating about future output or inflation generally reduces {{the degree to which}} subjects rely on lagged information and increases their reliance on the REE solution. Interest rate projections, by contrast, do not significantly alter subjects 2 ̆ 7 forecast accuracy or disagreement. Central bank credibility significantly decreases when the central bank makes larger forecast errors when providing forward <b>guidance</b> about either <b>output</b> and inflation, but not when they provide a dual projection. Our findings suggest that expectations are best coordinated and stabilized by communicating output and inflation forecasts simultaneously. The second paper of this thesis (Chapter 3) evaluates the central bank communication of its future inflation and output expectations to reduce economic variations {{in the event of a}} demand or cost [...] push shock. Four communication strategies are tested: no communication, communicating output, communicating inflation, and communicating output and inflation. Two Taylor rules are considered: (a) central bank interest rate responds to inflation and output (flexible inflation targeting [IT]), and (b) central bank responds only to inflation (strict IT). We find that with a demand shock, communicating future inflation reduces output variations and increases inflation and interest rate variations; however, communicating output stabilizes inflation and interest rates and destabilizes output (the interest rate rule did not matter qualitatively). With a cost [...] push shock, communicating future output decreases inflation and interest rate variability, irrespective of Taylor rule qualitatively. In order to stabilize output, a central bank should be uncommunicative under flexible IT but should communicate future inflation under strict IT. The third paper of this thesis (Chapter 4) studies the effect of the degree of information observability on bank runs in a sequential laboratory environment. We conduct an experiment with ten depositors in a queue who are randomly ranked to submit their decisions. The depositors decide between withdrawing their deposit or waiting and leaving their deposit in a common experimental bank. Two treatments are considered: a sequential high-information treatment, and a sequential low [...] information treatment. In both treatments, depositors who are in the front of the queue tend to withdraw more than those at the back of the queue. Moreover, depositors are responsive to the information about the preceding withdrawals within a period. We find that in the sequential high [...] information treatment the possibility of observing preceding withdrawals increases the likelihood of bank runs compared to a sequential-low information treatment...|$|R
