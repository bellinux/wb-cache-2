In its exploration, the thesis focuses on articulation of the above standard in the context of availability of information regarding the target company or enterprise, which commonly takes form of a due diligence.

5|$|Although {{the five}} spans {{of the current}} bridge are far wider than the {{nineteen}} spans of the original bridge, Battersea Bridge's location on a sharp bend in the river still presents a hazard to navigation. In 1948, the MV Delta jammed under the bridge, and its master Hendrikus Oostring suffered broken arms {{and needed to be}} rescued from the smashed wheelhouse. On 23 March 1950, the collier John Hopkinson collided with the central pier, causing serious structural damage, leaving the tram tracks as the only element holding the bridge together. The London County Council was concerned that the entire structure would collapse and closed the bridge until January 1951. Tram services in the area were withdrawn on 30 September 1950, so when the bridge was reopened the tram tracks were lifted. Another serious incident took place on 21 September 2005, when the James Prior, a 200-ton barge, collided with the bridge, causing serious structural damage costing over £500,000 to repair. The bridge was closed to all motor vehicles other than buses while repairs were carried out, causing severe traffic congestion; it eventually reopened on 16 January 2006. Brian King, the master of the James Prior, was formally cleared of navigating without <b>due</b> <b>care</b> and attention in 2008, when the judge in the case injured his back and was unable to proceed, and prosecutors decided not to re-present the case.|$|E

Mills suffered crushed ribs, a punctured lung, and the loss of her left leg 6inches below the knee; a metal plate was later attached to her pelvis. In October 1993, she had another operation that further shortened her leg. Mills was awarded £200,000 by the police authority as recompense for her injuries, even though the police motorcyclist, PC Osbourne, was later cleared by magistrates of driving without <b>due</b> <b>care</b> and attention. After the accident, Mills sold her story to the News of the World, and gave other interviews, saying she earned £180,000. She used the money to set up the Heather Mills Health Trust (existed 2000–2004) which delivered prosthetic limbs to people, particularly children, who had lost limbs after stepping on landmines. Mills often shows people her prosthetic leg, once taking it off during an interview on the American talk show Larry King Live, in 2002.|$|E

25|$|As can be noted, {{liability}} {{is generally}} not extended to the acts of independent contractors. Though such a distinction has been criticised, there are several circumstances in which an employer may be liable for the acts of contractors. If an employer commissions a tort, this will render the employer a joint tortfeasor. Additionally, where an employer is negligent in selecting a competent third party contractor, liability may be imposed. The broadest exception however is where a non-delegable duty is imposed upon an employer, either by statute or through common law, to prevent the harm of others. Where a duty is imposed by statute, either to carry out work in a certain way, or to take <b>due</b> <b>care</b> in carrying out work, then this is non-delegable. Common law duties may arise in several exceptional circumstances. One such is where an activity is being undertaken which is especially hazardous, and involves obvious risks of damage. This duty was recognised in Honeywill and Stein Ltd v Larkin Brothers Ltd, where photographers who negligently photographed {{the interior of a}} theatre set alight to the building. Their employers were found vicariously liable, as the dangerous methods of photography created a fire hazard. Additionally, where work is being undertaken on a highway, a non-delegable duty is created not to endanger any road users. Lastly, occupiers are liable in full where an independent contractor, through negligence, allows fire to spread to neighbouring land.|$|E
