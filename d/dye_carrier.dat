40|$|Disturbances of {{the cardiac}} {{conduction}} system constitute a major risk after surgical repair of complex cases of congenital heart disease. Intraoperative {{identification of the}} conduction system may {{reduce the incidence of}} these disturbances. We previously developed an approach to identify cardiac tissue types using fiber-optics confocal microscopy and extracellular fluorophores. Here, we applied this approach to investigate sensitivity and specificity of human and automated classification in discriminating images of atrial working myocardium and specialized tissue of the conduction system. Two-dimensional image sequences from atrial working myocardium and nodal tissue of isolated perfused rodent hearts were acquired using a fiber-optics confocal microscope (Leica FCM 1000). We compared two methods for local application of extracellular fluorophores: topical via pipette and with a <b>dye</b> <b>carrier.</b> Eight blinded examiners evaluated 162 randomly selected images of atrial working myocardium (n = 81) and nodal tissue (n = 81). In addition, we evaluated the images using automated classification. Blinded examiners achieved a sensitivity and specificity of 99. 2 ± 0. 3 % and 98. 0 ± 0. 7 %, respectively, with the <b>dye</b> <b>carrier</b> method of dye application. Sensitivity and specificity was similar for dye application via a pipette (99. 2 ± 0. 3 % and 94. 0 ± 2. 4 %, respectively). Sensitivity and specificity for automated methods of tissue discrimination were similarly high. Human and automated classification achieved high sensitivity and specificity in discriminating atrial working myocardium and nodal tissue. We suggest that our findings facilitate clinical translation of fiber-optics confocal microscopy as an intraoperative imaging modality to reduce the incidence of conduction disturbances during surgical correction of congenital heart disease...|$|E

40|$|Fiber-optics {{confocal}} microscopy (FCM) is {{an emerging}} imaging technology with various applications in basic research and clinical diagnosis. FCM allows for real-time in situ microscopy of tissue at sub-cellular scale. Recently FCM {{has been investigated}} for cardiac imaging, in particular, for discrimination of cardiac tissue during pediatric open-heart surgery. FCM relies on fluorescent dyes. The current clinical approach of dye delivery is based on systemic injection, which is associated with high dye consumption and adverse clinical events. In this study, we investigated approaches for local dye delivery during FCM imaging based on <b>dye</b> <b>carriers</b> attached to the imaging probe. Using three-dimensional confocal microscopy, automated bench tests, and FCM imaging we quantitatively characterized <b>dye</b> release of <b>carriers</b> composed of open-pore foam only and foam loaded with agarose hydrogel. In addition, we compared local dye delivery with a model of systemic dye delivery in the isolated perfused rodent heart. We measured the signal-to-noise ratio of images acquired in various regions of the heart. Our evaluations showed that foam-agarose <b>dye</b> <b>carriers</b> exhibited a prolonged dye release versus foam-only <b>carriers.</b> Foam-agarose <b>dye</b> <b>carriers</b> allowed reliable imaging of 5 - 9 lines, which is comparable to 4 - 8 min of continuous dye release. Our study in the living heart revealed that the SNR of FCM images using local and systemic dye delivery is not different. However, we observed differences in the imaged tissue microstructure with the two approaches. Structural features characteristic of microvasculature were solely observed for systemic dye delivery. Our findings suggest that local dye delivery approach for FCM imaging constitutes an important alternative to systemic dye delivery. We suggest that the approach for local dye delivery will facilitate clinical translation of FCM, for instance, for FCM imaging during pediatric heart surgery...|$|R

40|$|The paper industry's {{experiences}} with PCBs were chronologically reviewed {{at a recent}} "PCB Workshop " sponsored by the Grocery Manufacturers of America, Inc. (1). This history goes back somewhat over a year, at which time two paperboard manufacturers were apprised {{of the presence of}} PCBs in folding cartons for packaging dried fruit. These two manufacturers immediately began searching for the source of the PCB contamination, screening all converting materials used in making cartons from the paperboard. These materials, including printing inks, varnishes and adhesives, proved not to be the source of the contamination. Examination of the fibrous materials used in the paperboard showed the source of PCB contamination to be some of the paperstocks used in manufacturing the paperboard. Certain high quality white and colored paperstock grades, such as ledger papers, were found to contain carbonless carbon papers which were the source of the PCBs. PCBs at that time were used as one component of the <b>dye</b> <b>carrier</b> in the carbonless carbon paper system. The American Paper Institute, the industry association, alerted the paper industry to this source of PCB contamination. Combination paperboard manufacturers, those who use recycled fibers in paperboard manufacture, immediately adopted operating procedures to eliminate the use of carbonless carbon papers and thus to minimize the PCBs in the paperboard.

This work appraised whey protein/ maltodextrin (WM) and soy protein/maltodextrin (SM) blends as alternative carriers for spray drying of grape juice and encapsulation of anthocyanins. The effects of carrier agent concentration (CAC) and ratio protein/carrier agent (R) on grape juice powder properties were evaluated. The grape juice powders presented good solubility, low water content and high anthocyanin retention. WM blends resulted in higher yields and higher anthocyanin retention (from 77. 9 to 94 %) than SM blends, whereas SM blends leaded to higher encapsulation efficiency (> 97 %). Increasing CAC and R resulted in brighter powders, but reconstituted juices presented color parameters {{similar to those of}} fresh juice. WM and SM were suitable for encapsulating anthocyanins of grape juice, resulting in powders with potential applications in food industry. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS The grape cultivar BRS violeta contains high levels of anthocyanins and is an alternative to produce antioxidant-rich and highly colored grape juice. Spray drying is applied for producing powdered grape juice with high anthocyanin content. In this technique, the addition of whey and soy proteins blended with maltodextrin as carrier agents avoid problems such as stickiness, which is negative to process yield and product quality. Moreover, the use of carrier agents in spray drying promotes the microencapsulation of bioactive compounds, allowing their protection and preservation during processing and storage. The grape juice powder from cv.

40|$|AbstractEvaluation of the {{existence}} of superoxide radicals (O⋅− 2), the site of generation and conditions required for one-e− transfer to oxygen from biological redox systems is a prerequisite for the understanding of the deregulation of O 2 homeostasis leading to oxidative stress. Mitochondria are increasingly considered the major O⋅− 2 source in a great variety of diseases and the aging process. Contradictory reports on mitochondrial O⋅− 2 release prompted us to critically investigate frequently used O⋅− 2 detection methods for their suitability. Due to the impermeability of the external mitochondrial membrane for most constituents of O⋅− 2 detection systems we decided to follow the stable dismutation product H 2 O 2. This metabolite was earlier shown to readily permeate into the cytosol. With the exception of tetramethylbenzidine none of the chemical reactants indicating the presence of H 2 O 2 by horseradish peroxidase-catalyzed absorbance change were suited due to solubility problems or low extinction coefficients. Tetramethylbenzidine-dependent H 2 O 2 detection was counteracted by rereduction of the <b>dye</b> through e− <b>carriers</b> of the respiratory chain.

Good NR-lipid interaction requires using a low NR/cell ratio; the NR concentration must be between 0. 25 μg/mL and 2. 0 μg/mL, and the cell concentration > 5 × 10 4 cells/mL. In order to have the maximum and stable NR fluorescence, {{it is necessary to}} scan the excitation/emission wavelengths for up to a 40 -min of incubation time. We outline a five-step method to customize the Nile Red protocol to a specific strain: 1) Evaluate the strain's suitability by checking for the presence of neutral lipid, 2) Select of the best excitation/emission wavelength, 3) Optimization of incubation time, stain <b>carrier,</b> <b>dye</b> concentration, and temperature, 4) Prepare single-strain algal cultures with different lipid contents to calibrate NR fluorescence with neutral-lipid content, and 5) Correlate NR fluorescence intensity to neutral lipid content for the same strain. Once the protocol is customized, the NR method allows for rapid and reliable monitoring of neutral lipid content of a microalgae strain. </p...|$|R
