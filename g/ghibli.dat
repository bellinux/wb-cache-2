5|$|Level-5 {{collaborated with}} Studio <b>Ghibli</b> {{to produce the}} game's {{animated}} sequences, and the game features graphics and visuals replicating the traditional animation style of Studio <b>Ghibli</b> films. The collaboration began when musician Naoya Fujimaki, who had previously worked with both companies, introduced Level-5 president Akihiro Hino to Studio <b>Ghibli</b> president Toshio Suzuki. At the time, Studio <b>Ghibli</b> had completed work on Ponyo (2008), and the animation team had no ongoing projects, which influenced Suzuki's decision to collaborate with Level-5. Another influencing factor of the collaboration was witnessing Hino's passion for the project. Studio <b>Ghibli</b> approached the production process {{in the same way}} that they would create an animated film. Work on the animation began in July 2008, and took much longer than the predicted three months.|$|E
5|$|Pixar representatives {{have also}} {{assisted}} in the English localization of several Studio <b>Ghibli</b> films, mainly those from Hayao Miyazaki.|$|E
5|$|In September 2013, Miyazaki {{announced}} that he was retiring from the production of feature films due to his age, but wished to continue working on the displays at the Studio <b>Ghibli</b> Museum. Miyazaki was awarded the Academy Honorary Award at the Governors Awards in November 2014. He is currently developing Boro the Caterpillar, a computer-animated short film which was first discussed during pre-production for Princess Mononoke. It will be screened exclusively at the Studio <b>Ghibli</b> Museum in July 2017. He is also working on an untitled samurai manga. In August 2016, Miyazaki proposed a new feature-length film, titled How Do You Live?. He began animation work on the project without receiving official approval. He hopes to complete the film by 2019, though Suzuki predicts a 2020–2021 release.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{its premiere}} on July 12, 1997, Princess Mononoke was {{critically}} acclaimed, {{becoming the first}} animated film to win the Japan Academy Prize for Picture of the Year. The film was also commercially successful, earning a domestic total of ¥14 billion (US$148 million), and becoming the highest-grossing film in Japan for several months. Miramax Films purchased the film's distributions rights for North America; {{it was the first}} Studio <b>Ghibli</b> production to receive a substantial theatrical distribution in the United States. While it was largely unsuccessful at the box office, grossing about US$3 million, it was seen as the introduction of Studio <b>Ghibli</b> to global markets.

5|$|Miyazaki co-founded Studio <b>Ghibli</b> in 1985. He {{directed}} several {{films with}} <b>Ghibli,</b> including Castle in the Sky in 1986, My Neighbor Totoro in 1988, Kiki's Delivery Service in 1989, and Porco Rosso in 1992. The films {{were met with}} commercial and critical success in Japan. Miyazaki's film Princess Mononoke was the first animated film to win the Japan Academy Prize for Picture of the Year, and briefly became the highest-grossing film in Japan following its release in 1997; its distribution to the Western world greatly increased Ghibli's popularity and influence outside Japan. His 2001 film Spirited Away became the highest-grossing film in Japanese history, winning the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature at the 75th Academy Awards and considered among the greatest animation films of all time. Miyazaki's later films—Howl's Moving Castle, Ponyo, and The Wind Rises—also enjoyed critical and commercial success. Following the release of The Wind Rises, Miyazaki announced his retirement from feature films, however he returned {{to work on a}} new feature film in 2016.|$|E
5|$|Ni no Kuni II: Revenant Kingdom was {{announced}} at PlayStation Experience on December 5, 2015. It {{will be released}} for the PlayStation 4 and Microsoft Windows on January 19, 2018.

5|$|The {{studio is}} praised {{primarily}} for its original and innovative productions, {{and it has}} gretely affected the animated film history over the last decades. Disney studios take inspiration {{from some of the}} other studios such as Studio <b>Ghibli</b> and Madhouse because the production team feels that many of the Japan's studios are ahead of them and capable of making better animation, which is the reason why they get inspiration from what those studios produce.|$|E

5|$|In early 2009, Miyazaki {{began writing}} a manga called , {{telling the story}} of Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighter {{designer}} Jiro Horikoshi. The manga was first published in two issues of the Model Graphix magazine, published on February 25 and March 25, 2009. Miyazaki later co-wrote the screenplay for Arrietty (2010) and From Up on Poppy Hill, directed by Hiromasa Yonebayashi and Gorō Miyazaki, respectively. Miyazaki wanted his next film to be a sequel to Ponyo, but Suzuki convinced him to instead adapt Kaze Tachinu to film. In November 2012, Studio <b>Ghibli</b> announced the production of The Wind Rises, based on Kaze Tachinu, to be released alongside Takahata's The Tale of Princess Kaguya.|$|E

5|$|Studio <b>Ghibli</b> set up its {{headquarters}} in Koganei, Tokyo in August 1992. In November 1992, two television spots directed by Miyazaki were broadcast by Nippon Television Network (NTV): Sora Iro no Tane, a 90-second spot loosely based on the illustrated story The Sky Blue Seed by Reiko Nakagawa and Yuriko Omura, and commissioned to celebrate NTV's fortieth anniversary; and Nandarou, aired as one 15-second and four 5-second spots, centered on an undefinable creature which ultimately became NTV's mascot. Miyazaki designed the storyboards and wrote the screenplay for Whisper of the Heart (1995), directed by Yoshifumi Kondō.|$|E
5|$|The {{animated}} sequences for Dominion of the Dark Djinn and Wrath of the White Witch {{were produced}} by Studio <b>Ghibli,</b> {{and the original}} score was composed by Joe Hisaishi and Rei Kondoh. The artwork was also greatly inspired by Studio Ghibli's other productions. The character development—particularly that of Oliver and his friends—was a large focus of development, and was intended to make children empathize with the characters and for adults to relive their adolescence. The developers chose to initially develop for the Nintendo DS due to its suitability for gameplay, and later used {{the power of the}} PlayStation 3 to its full potential to render the world with great detail.|$|E
5|$|The {{music for}} the {{role-playing}} video game series Ni no Kuni, developed by Level-5 and published in Western regions by Bandai Namco Entertainment, was composed by the team of Joe Hisaishi and Rei Kondoh, and performed by the Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra. Hisaishi, known for his previous work on Studio <b>Ghibli</b> films, agreed {{to work on the}} games after witnessing the development team's passion for the project. He wrote 21 tracks for the games across seven days, and was continually encouraged by the complexity of his compositions. Hisaishi aimed to make the music reflect the fantasy genre, creating a compatibility between the soundtrack and the game world.|$|E
5|$|Studio <b>Ghibli's</b> Yoshiyuki Momose {{served as}} the {{director}} of animation, drawing character designs and storyboards. Hino wished Dominion of the Dark Djinn and Wrath of the White Witch to have a heartwarming feel; the artwork and character movements was greatly inspired by Studio <b>Ghibli's</b> work, particularly due to their attention to detail, as well as their talent in creating storyboards and utilizing camera control. The development team constantly watched Studio <b>Ghibli's</b> films during development. The team wanted the theme of the game to resonate with children; they initially considered the idea of expressing adventure and dreams. They later explored the concept of a child's greatest influence, their mother, and the possibility of losing them. The game's main playable character, Oliver, is a 13-year-old boy. The team decided to make him a child as they wished to showcase a coming of age story. They wanted children to empathize with Oliver's development, and adults to relive the excitement of their adolescence.|$|R

5|$|In 1987, Studio <b>Ghibli</b> {{acquired}} {{the rights to}} create a film adaptation of Eiko Kadono's novel Kiki's Delivery Service. Miyazaki's work on My Neighbor Totoro prevented him from directing the adaptation; Sunao Katabuchi was chosen as director, and Nobuyuki Isshiki was hired as script writer. Miyazaki's dissatisfaction of Isshiki's first draft led him to make changes to the project, ultimately taking the role of director. Kadono was unhappy with {{the differences between the}} book and the screenplay. Miyazaki and Suzuki visited Kadono and invited her to the studio; she allowed the project to continue. The film was originally intended to be a 60-minute special, but expanded into a feature film after Miyazaki completed the storyboards and screenplay. Kiki's Delivery Service premiered on July 29, 1989. It earned ¥2.15 billion at the box office, and was the highest-grossing film in Japan in 1989.|$|E
5|$|In December 2008, {{the film}} was {{released}} on Blu-ray in Japan. Its video format is MPEG-4 AVC and its digitally-remastered audio is improved over that of the DVD, but contains no English audio or subtitle options despite being in Region A format. Years later, a new HD digital remaster was produced and Cagliostro was given a limited theatrical re-release in Japan on 9 May 2014. The remaster was released both individually {{and as part of}} The Collected Works of Hayao Miyazaki, a box set containing all of Miyazaki's movies. Both these newer releases were released by Studio <b>Ghibli</b> in conjunction with Disney. StudioCanal released a Blu-ray and DVD bundle of the film on 12 November 2012 in the UK. The StudioCanal release is of superior quality with its new high definition transfer, but the credits for the film are absent.|$|E
5|$|In May 1995, Miyazaki took a {{group of}} artists and animators to the ancient forests of Yakushima and the {{mountains}} of Shirakami-Sanchi, taking photographs and making sketches. The landscapes in the film were inspired by Yakushima. In Princess Mononoke, Miyazaki revisited the ecological and political themes of Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind. Miyazaki supervised the 144,000 cels in the film, about 80,000 of which were key animation. Princess Mononoke was produced with an estimated budget of ¥2.35 billion (approximately US$23.5 million), making it the most expensive film by Studio <b>Ghibli</b> at the time. Approximately fifteen minutes of the film uses computer animation: about five minutes uses techniques such as 3D rendering, digital composition, and texture mapping; the remaining ten minutes uses digital ink and paint. While the original intention was to digitally paint 5,000 of the film's frames, time constraints doubled this.|$|E
50|$|Eight of Studio <b>Ghibli's</b> {{films are}} among the 15 highest-{{grossing}} anime films made in Japan, with Spirited Away (2001) being the second highest, grossing over US$290 million worldwide. Many of their works have won the Animage Anime Grand Prix award, and four have won the Japan Academy Prize for Animation of the Year. Five of Studio <b>Ghibli's</b> films received Academy Award nominations in the United States. Spirited Away won a Golden Bear in 2002 and an Academy Award for Best Animated Feature Film in 2003.
