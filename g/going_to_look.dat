25|$|When Eileen Letchworth, who portrayed Margo Flax Martin, {{contemplated}} a facelift, {{she talked}} {{it over with}} Nixon. Not only was Letchworth going to need time off, she was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> significantly different {{when she returned to}} the show. Nixon approved and worked the facelift into a storyline. Margo wanted to impress the somewhat younger Paul Martin (William Mooney). Margo's facelift in 1974 {{became one of the first}} major storylines on television discussing plastic surgery and its psychological effects.|$|E
25|$|Produced by Manilow, Bette Midler Sings the Rosemary Clooney Songbook was {{released}} on September 30, 2003. It {{was the first time}} that the pair had worked together in more than twenty years. The album went gold, and they collaborated again in 2005 on Bette Midler Sings the Peggy Lee Songbook. On December 3, 2003, A aired A Barry Manilow Christmas: Live by Request, his second of two concerts for the series. The two-hour special had Manilow taking requests for Christmas songs performed live with a band and an orchestra. Manilow told the audience that he was what Clay Aiken was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> like in thirty years, thus acknowledging an ongoing comparison between the two. Also on the special were guests Cyndi Lauper, José Feliciano, and Bette Midler (Midler, busy preparing her own tour in Los Angeles, appeared only in a pre-taped segment).|$|E

500|$|... "I have to confess," [...] wrote retired FBI chief {{investigator}} Ralph Himmelsbach in his 1986 book, [...] "if I [...] <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> for Cooper, I would {{head for}} the Washougal." [...] The Washougal Valley and its surroundings have been searched repeatedly by private individuals and groups in subsequent years; to date, no discoveries directly traceable to the hijacking have been reported. Some investigators have speculated that the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens may have obliterated any remaining physical clues.|$|E
500|$|For the {{performance}} of [...] "Paparazzi", Gaga had collaborated with her Haus of Gaga creative partner Matthew [...] "Matty Dada" [...] Williams. She had a different vision {{for it in the}} beginning. Dada thought that Gaga should wear her hair braided, which Gaga had never done before. Dada's explanation for the concept was the look of Rapunzel, the fairy-tale character. He felt that [...] "it's something people deeply understand. And when you're wearing sunglasses on a scaffolding piece with a giant alien dancing behind you, I promised [...] it's not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> like Rapunzel.'" ...|$|E
500|$|The Silver Samurai, {{rendered}} by Weta Digital, {{was based}} on a model that had been 3D printed and chrome painted using electrolysis. Stunt performer Shane Rangi, wearing a motion capture suit, stood on stilts while filming as the Silver Samurai. Rangi's performance was then used to animate the digital character. Hill said the main challenge was creating the Silver Samurai's highly reflective surface, [...] "He's pretty much chrome. We were worried that he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> incredibly digital and {{that it was going to}} be very hard to make him look solid and real and not just like a mirrored surface." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I don't {{like you}} for one thing, Roger," [...] said Laura, half reproachfully. [...] "I don't like {{this idea of}} Dave <b>going</b> off <b>to</b> <b>look</b> for that lost mine." ...|$|R

500|$|It's {{almost as}} if, as broadcasters, we are glorying his death. The context a show is {{presented}} in will have {{a huge impact on}} how it is received, and it's always been our policy to swim against the tide and resist the policy to conform. It seems ironic—and depressing—to me that after deliberately avoiding the [...] "obvious" [...] approach in my script we are now facing a very [...] "obvious" [...] approach to the scheduling. If Victor dies at Christmas it's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> like a naked push for ratings. The opposite is true: I want Victor's departure to be significant, but stripped of sensationalism.|$|E
500|$|Actress Jasika Nicole, {{who plays}} junior FBI agent Astrid Farnsworth, {{described}} the episode in a May 2009 interview, [...] "It's about spontaneously combusting. This is the episode I get {{to get out}} of the lab. I remember thinking I can't wait to see what the set's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> like and how they will make it look when the spontaneous combusting takes place. And we get there and it's just smoke on the walls, like a kitchen fire. I thought that was so funny because I thought there were going to be body parts everywhere, like a small explosion. But it's a really good episode, which leads you into the coolest parts of the finale episode." ...|$|E
500|$|The series {{begins with}} opening credits that depict {{traditional}} Roman myths, such as Romulus and Remus, the city's foundation mythos. For inspiration, visual effects and design company A52 explored museums, {{read the script}} and researched Roman history. They created the opening sequence entirely in-house. VFX artist Kirk Balden said of production, [...] "On many projects, you start off with storyboards and everyone has {{a good idea of}} what it's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> like when it's completed. This project was very experimental right to the very end. The tone of it is pretty much unlike anything we've done and most of what any of us here have seen. There's a lot there that creatively sets the stage for the series." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said March; [...] "and I was <b>going</b> out <b>to</b> <b>look</b> up Lindau this morning. I've inquired at Maroni's, and he hasn't {{been there}} for several days. I've some idea perhaps he's sick. But they gave me his address, and I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> see." ...|$|R
6000|$|No, it isn't asleep, Sylvie said, timidly <b>going</b> nearer <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at it: it's {{eyes are}} open. Is it--is it--her voice dropped to an awestruck whisper, is it dead, do you think?" ...|$|R
500|$|Duke University {{basketball}} {{head coach}} Mike Krzyzewski, {{who had just}} completed his first season as Duke coach, was in town to evaluate Johnny Dawkins in a 1981 Washington D.C. summer league game, but was convinced {{to stay for a}} second game to see Amaker play. Krzyzewski met Amaker's mother and said, [...] "Mrs. Amaker, your son is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> great in Duke blue." [...] At the time, Amaker had wanted to play for the Maryland Terrapins because his sister Tami went to the University of Maryland, College Park and Amaker idolized Maryland star guard John Lucas. [...] He was recruited eventually to Duke by assistant coach Chuck Swenson, who would later become an assistant coach during Amaker's first five seasons at Michigan from 2001 to 2006.|$|E
500|$|In 40 years, nearly 100 million Sindy dolls {{were sold}} in Britain alone, and in 2003, Sindy was relaunched for her 40th birthday. Her figure was changed to more closely {{resemble}} the girls the doll is marketed towards. Denise Deane, the head of design and development at New Moons, the new Sindy manufacturer, said, [...] "She's lost the big breasts and very long legs, and we've completely changed her face. She's totally unrecognisable. Sindy's still very popular, but she has been neglected {{over the last few}} years, and we don't think people are identifying with that look. She's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> like a 15-year-old, and we've designed her to wear trainers." [...] The doll was released in two versions: six-inch and full-size.|$|E
500|$|James Madigan, {{the visual}} effects supervisor, {{approached}} the series as a feature film, observing that [...] "every {{aspect of the}} production took meticulous care with every detail, the costumes, the set dressing, the acting, and the attention to historical fact. As you worked on it, you really got the feeling that Rome was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> like something we had never seen on TV before, so our vfx approach very much wanted to respect that." [...] Madigan attempted to seamlessly mesh the visual effects with the physical sets and depend less on CGI. A friend told Madigan that after seeing the pilot, [...] "he didn’t see any vfx shots, {{even though there are}} dozens of shots throughout episode 1. That means we did our job well." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No wonder," [...] {{returned}} Neale, and he {{felt suddenly}} the fiery grip of his old state of mind toward all the engineering obstacles. [...] "I'm <b>going</b> out <b>to</b> <b>look</b> over the ground." ...|$|R
5000|$|Clinton {{laid out}} the stakes as such: [...] "If people don’t believe that {{democracy}} and free markets deliver, then they’re <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be <b>looking</b> elsewhere for models that more readily respond to their daily needs." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I did {{not tell}} you before, Nan, but Dutton was <b>going</b> to-day <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at a poor little {{unclaimed}} child's body that {{had been found in}} the Thames. He knew him better than I, so he went.' ...|$|R
500|$|Although {{officials}} {{downplayed the}} level of threat the trio presented to Obama, they said they planned further investigations into how a gang of supposedly small-time criminals collected such a massive arsenal. Authorities believed the men had at least some white supremacist involvement, although experts at the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks the radical right, said no evidence existed linking any of them to a white supremacist group. Nevertheless, the possible connections prompted FBI officials, who originally considered the threat [...] "relatively minor", to develop stronger concerns about whether the motives from the three plotters could have been connected to a larger organization. The FBI stated that with an African American candidate for president, [...] "you are certainly <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at the general threat picture against any candidate and factor in the threats posed by those who preach hate and racism." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{cast and}} crew were unhappy with the rock prop used in the episode. Visual effects {{supervisor}} Glenn Neufeld strapped Visitor's feet to the stage {{in order to ensure}} that the crystal didn't move. Different versions of the crystal were then applied for different scenes, with the larger versions incorporating a seat for the actress so that she could relax inside the prop between takes. The prop caused problems for Visitor due to her claustrophobia, which was the second time during season three that a Wolfe scripted episode had caused her these types of problems after [...] "". She also didn't like how it appeared on screen: [...] "I thought it was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> like my body turning to stone. Instead I looked like a big old hot fudge sundae, and my head was the cherry on top." ...|$|E
500|$|Henn {{revealed}} that {{he was drawn to}} [...] "Mulan's story [...] was so unique and compelling that it just captivated me from the beginning". Animating the characters' distinct emotions using the traditional Chinese style turned out to be somewhat challenging for Henn. The animator explained, [...] "We don't create realism in the sense that if you're doing a human character, it's not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> realistic... the balance is finding an appealing way of drawing using the visual tools that you have in the design to convey the believable emotions that you want to get across." [...] In addition to Mulan, Henn was also responsible for animating Fa Zhou, Mulan's elderly father. He described the complex relationship between the two characters as [...] "the emotional heart of the story". Fathering one daughter himself, Henn drew inspiration from his own emotions as well as past personal experiences while animating several intimate scenes shared by the two characters.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Alton. [...] "When a man goes round {{borrowing}} {{he finds}} out that the folks who have got the dollars like to keep them. That's why I'm <b>going</b> up <b>to</b> <b>look</b> for Jimmy's silver mine." ...|$|R
6000|$|The girl {{shook her}} head. [...] "I haven't any home. I'm just a shop girl {{out of work}} at present, and I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> Pembroke <b>to</b> <b>look</b> for some." ...|$|R
6000|$|Alice Deringham {{said nothing}} for a space, and then her voice was different. There was no shade of {{expression}} in it. [...] "And you are <b>going</b> back <b>to</b> <b>look</b> for the silver tomorrow? I hope you will be successful." ...|$|R
500|$|According to her suicide note, Alcorn {{had felt}} [...] "like a girl {{trapped in a}} boy's body" [...] since she was four, and came to {{identify}} as a transgender girl {{from the age of}} fourteen, when she became aware of the term. According to her note, she immediately informed her mother, who reacted [...] "extremely negatively" [...] by claiming that it was only a phase and that God had made her a male, so she could never be a woman. She stated that this made her hate herself, and that she developed a form of depression. Her mother sent her to Christian conversion therapists, but Alcorn later related that here she only encountered [...] "more Christians" [...] telling her that she was [...] "selfish and wrong" [...] and [...] "should look to God for help." [...] Aged sixteen, she requested that she be allowed to undergo transition treatment, but was denied permission: in her words, [...] "I felt hopeless, that I was just <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> like a man in drag {{for the rest of my}} life. On my 16th birthday, when I didn't receive consent from my parents to start transitioning, I cried myself to sleep." ...|$|E
500|$|Opening in 2,362 theaters on March 2, 2007, {{the film}} grossed US$13.3 {{million in its}} opening weekend, placing second and posting a per-theater average of $5,671. The film was outgrossed by fellow opener Wild Hogs and saw a decline of over 50% in its second weekend, losing out to the record-breaking 300. It grossed $33 million in North America and $51 million {{in the rest of}} the world, {{bringing}} its current total to $84 million, above its estimated $65 million production budget. In an interview with Sight & Sound magazine, Fincher addressed the film's low gross at the North American box office: [...] "Even with the box office being what it is, I still think there's an audience out there for this movie. Everyone has a different idea about marketing, but my philosophy is that if you market a movie to 16-year-old boys and don't deliver Saw or Seven, they're going to be the most vociferous ones coming out of the screening saying 'This movie sucks.' And you're saying goodbye to the audience who would get it because they're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at the ads and say, 'I don't want to see some slasher movie.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Sasha began DJing with Ableton Live in his live act as well, {{using it}} in tandem with turntables. Having {{explored}} its functionality, Sasha found that he could perform entirely through Ableton Live. He then co-developed the Maven controller, which he uses as a physical interface to the Live software. [...] (DJing with a mouse alone, he has said, is [...] "not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> right or feel right".) [...] Fundacion NYC was the first album on which he regularly used the Maven controller. [...] During DJ sets, clubbers often believe Sasha is playing new, unheard remixes; in fact, he is often playing modifications of tracks created in Ableton. [...] Sasha most often uses the built-in Ableton plugins, preferring their superior stability and performance over third party plugins. [...] For the first public performance of Involver material, he used a PowerBook running Ableton, but has since shifted to a setup that includes an iMac G5 and Ableton Live. [...] Despite Sasha's insistence that Ableton Live allows for greater creativity and spontaneity, [...] "vinyl purists" [...] have accused him of taking much of the challenge and mystique out of DJing by using software in performances.|$|E
