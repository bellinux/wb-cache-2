5|$|At any time, {{there are}} four or five people working at the control center: two monitor the ATC system, one {{monitors}} passenger information, and one is responsible for secondary systems, such as power supply. In case of technical problems, {{there is always a}} team of linemen that can be dispatched to perform repairs. Although the trains are not equipped with drivers, there are stewards at stations and on most trains that help passengers, perform ticket controls and assist in <b>emergency</b> <b>situations.</b>|$|E
5|$|CTLS-4TAC – Designed {{for export}} under Lend-Lease, {{a total of}} 420 were produced, {{originally}} intended for China. Six hundred 4TACs and 4TAYs were sent to China after Pearl Harbor. The remaining 240 were dispersed for <b>emergency</b> <b>situations,</b> like in Alaska. The armor was doubled and the armament consisted of three 7.62mm (.30 cal) machine guns, {{one of which was}} mounted in a 240° traverse, hand-cranked turret. Under OCM 18526, the CTLS-4TAC was labeled Light Tank T16. All vehicles were scrapped in 1943.|$|E
5|$|In 1998, the Marine Racecar Board of the National Academy of Science {{conducted}} a survey of industry experts regarding {{the pros and cons}} of double-hull design. Some of the advantages of the double-hull design that were mentioned include ease of ballasting in <b>emergency</b> <b>situations,</b> reduced practice of saltwater ballasting in cargo tanks decreases corrosion, increased environmental protection, cargo discharge is quicker, more complete and easier, tank washing is more efficient, and better protection in low-impact collisions and grounding.|$|E

5|$|RSI {{may also}} be used in prehospital <b>emergency</b> <b>situations</b> when a patient is {{conscious}} but respiratory failure is imminent (such as in extreme trauma). This procedure is commonly performed by flight paramedics. Flight paramedics often use RSI to intubate before transport because intubation in a moving fixed-wing or rotary-wing aircraft {{is extremely difficult to}} perform due to environmental factors. The patient will be paralyzed and intubated on the ground before transport by aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The filming {{was done}} at two hospitals, the Northwick Park Hospital in Middlesex and the North Hampshire Hospital in Basingstoke. This {{presented}} a problem because the show had to work around the real-life hospitals, with their actual doctors, patients and <b>emergency</b> <b>situations.</b> In one scene in the final episode in series one, Guy (Mangan) was hitting squash balls behind him, and nearly hit a patient. However, some scenes, {{such as those in}} Sue's and Alan's offices, were filmed in a studio.|$|E
5|$|Ultrasound is {{commonly}} used {{in the evaluation of}} people who have sustained physical trauma, for example with the FAST protocol. Ultrasound may be more sensitive than chest X-rays in the identification of pneumothorax after blunt trauma to the chest. Ultrasound may also provide a rapid diagnosis in other <b>emergency</b> <b>situations,</b> and allow the quantification {{of the size of the}} pneumothorax. Several particular features on ultrasonography of the chest can be used to confirm or exclude the diagnosis.|$|E

5|$|It {{is carried}} out in the manner of an {{informal}} enquiry, using a combination of open and closed questions, supplemented by structured tests to assess cognition. The MSE can also be considered part of the comprehensive physical examination performed by physicians and nurses although it may be performed in a cursory and abbreviated way in non-mental-health settings. Information is usually recorded as free-form text using the standard headings, but brief MSE checklists are available for use in <b>emergency</b> <b>situations,</b> for example by paramedics or emergency department staff.|$|E
5|$|Tracheal {{intubation}} in {{the emergency}} setting can be difficult with the fiberoptic bronchoscope due to blood, vomit, or secretions in the airway and poor patient cooperation. Because of this, patients with massive facial injury, complete upper airway obstruction, severely diminished ventilation, or profuse upper airway bleeding are poor candidates for fiberoptic intubation. Fiberoptic intubation under general anesthesia typically requires two skilled individuals. Success rates of only 83–87% have been reported using fiberoptic techniques {{in the emergency}} department, with significant nasal bleeding occurring in up to 22% of patients. These drawbacks limit the use of fiberoptic bronchoscopy somewhat in urgent and <b>emergency</b> <b>situations.</b>|$|E
5|$|Governor Ann-Kristin Olsen {{traveled}} to Barentsburg on 30 August {{to inform the}} communities about the accident, and distributed ample written information in Russian about the then-known details about the crash. Later in the day, a Russian aircraft arrived with Deputy Minister Aleksandr Petrovich of the Ministry of <b>Emergency</b> <b>Situations</b> along {{with a team of}} 11 rescue workers, and representatives from the Interstate Aviation Committee (IAC), the Embassy of Ukraine in Moscow, the Federal Air Transport Agency and Vnukovo Airlines. In a meeting that evening, the Governor accepted Russia assistance, while it was confirmed by international agreement that the investigation would be led by the authorities in the country where the accident occurred, Norway. On 31 August, Minister of Justice Grete Faremo visited the Russian settlements as a representative from the Government of Norway.|$|E

5|$|The {{most common}} repairs are the {{grinding}} of the wheels; more complicated repairs {{are made by}} replacing entire components that are sent to the manufacturer. By having components in reserve, trains can have shorter maintenance times. The center also has the system's work trains, including a diesel locomotive that can fetch broken trains. At any time, there are four people working at the control center. Two monitor the ATC system, one monitors passenger information, while the last is responsible for secondary systems, such as power supply.

5|$|The vast {{majority}} of tracheal intubations involve {{the use of a}} viewing instrument of one type or another. The modern conventional laryngoscope consists of a handle containing batteries that power a light and a set of interchangeable blades, which are either straight or curved. This device is designed to allow the laryngoscopist to directly view the larynx. Due to the widespread availability of such devices, the technique of blind intubation of the trachea is rarely practiced today, although it may still be useful in certain <b>emergency</b> <b>situations,</b> such as natural or man-made disasters. In the prehospital emergency setting, digital intubation may be necessitated if the patient is in a position that makes direct laryngoscopy impossible. For example, digital intubation may be used by a paramedic if the patient is entrapped in an inverted position in a vehicle after a motor vehicle collision with a prolonged extrication time.|$|E
5|$|Security on the Delhi Metro {{is handled}} by the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), who have been {{guarding}} the system ever since they took over from the Delhi Police in 2007. Closed-circuit cameras are used to monitor trains and stations, and feed from these is monitored by both the CISF and Delhi Metro authorities at their respective control rooms. Over 3500 CISF personnel have been deployed to deal with law and order issues in the system, in addition to metal detectors, X-ray baggage inspection systems, and dog squads which are used to secure the system. About 5,200 CCTV cameras have been installed, which cover every nook and corner of each Metro station. Each of the underground stations has about 45 to 50 cameras installed while the elevated stations have about 16 to 20 cameras each. The monitoring of these cameras {{is done by the}} CISF, which is in charge of security of the Metro, as well as the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation. Intercoms are provided in each train car for emergency communication between the passengers and the train operator. Periodic security drills are carried out at stations and on trains to ensure preparedness of security agencies in <b>emergency</b> <b>situations.</b>|$|E

40|$|An <b>emergency</b> <b>situation</b> in a {{continuous}} transport system is an undesirable phenomenon during which the continuity of production or technological processes is seriously endangered. This situation can be brought about by various factors. In technological equipment of environmental continuous belt conveyor systems and pipe conveyors various adverse critical conditions may arise, which may result {{in the creation of}} an <b>emergency</b> <b>situation.</b> In particular, both conveyor and supporting rollers being the most significant components of the conveyor belt can substantially contribute to the onset of an <b>emergency</b> <b>situation.</b> Any damage to them can lead to a reduction or a complete standstill of the continuous transport process, which impedes upon the subsequent production operations. This contribution describes the possibility of the measurement and assessment of normal contact forces, which are applied by the conveyor belt to the supporting rollers on the hexagonal idler roller support of the pipe conveyors. This allows an early prediction of the critical condition and thus any developing <b>emergency</b> <b>situation</b> can be forestalled...|$|R
40|$|In Indian four-lane express highway, {{millions}} of vehicles are travelling every day. Accidents are unfortunate and frequently occurring in these highways causing deaths, increase in death toll, and damage to infrastructure. A mechanism {{is required to}} avoid such road accidents at the maximum to reduce the death toll. An <b>Emergency</b> <b>Situation</b> Prediction Mechanism, a novel and proactive approach, is proposed in this paper for achieving the best of Intelligent Transportation System using Vehicular Ad Hoc Network. ESPM intends to predict the possibility of occurrence of an accident in an Indian four-lane express highway. In ESPM, the <b>emergency</b> <b>situation</b> prediction {{is done by the}} Road Side Unit based on (i) the Status Report sent by the vehicles in the range of RSU and (ii) the road traffic flow analysis done by the RSU. Once the <b>emergency</b> <b>situation</b> or accident is predicted in advance, an Emergency Warning Message is constructed and disseminated to all vehicles in the area of RSU to alert and prevent the vehicles from accidents. ESPM performs well in <b>emergency</b> <b>situation</b> prediction in advance to the occurrence of an accident. ESPM predicts the <b>emergency</b> <b>situation</b> within 0. 20 seconds which is comparatively less than the statistical value. The prediction accuracy of ESPM against vehicle density is found better in different traffic scenarios...|$|R
