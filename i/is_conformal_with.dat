Classical solutions of (2 + 1) -Gravity [1] with dynamical matter have recently been found [2, 3] in a (regular) conformal gauge which allows instantaneous propagation of the longitudinal gravitational field. This gauge is characterized by a vanishing York time [4], and by a conformal factor which is of Liouville type, even when arbitrary matter sources are introduced. Although the pointlike matter described so far is characterized by a non-compact conical geometry at space infinity, corresponding to a total mass of an open universe, in this note I suggest that the method can be extended to some compact cases. Furthermore, I will argue, it may describe proper matter sources as well, possibly combining a non-compact structure with higher topologies...|$|E
40|$|When using {{accelerator}} beams {{for cancer}} therapy, the three-dimensional freedom afforded by a gantry helps the treatment planner {{to spread out}} surface doses, avoid directions that intercept vital organs and irradiate a volume that <b>is</b> <b>conformal</b> <b>with</b> the tumour. The general preference is for an iso-centric gantry turning 360 ° in the vertical plane around the patient bed with sufficient space {{to be able to}} orientate the patient through 360 ° in the horizontal plane. For hadrontherapy, gantries are impressive structures of the order of 10 m in diameter and 100 tons in weight and to date only proton gantries have been demonstrated to operate satisfactorily. The increased magnetic rigidity of say carbon ions will make ion gantries more difficult and costly to build. For this reason, exo-centric gantries and, in particular the so-called 'Riesenrad' gantry with a single 90 ° bending magnet, merit further attention. The power consumption is reduced and the heavy magnets with their counterbalance weight are reduced and are kept close to the axis. The treatment room, which is lighter, is positioned at a larger radius, but only the patient bed requires careful alignment. An optics module called a 'rotator' is needed to match an incoming dispersion vector to the gantry in order to have an achromatic beam at the patient. A practical design is described that assumes the beam is derived from a slow-extraction scheme in a synchrotron and that the beam sizes are controlled by modules in the transfer line.

40|$|Structural {{design and}} {{identification}} are two import aspects in engineering practice. The former aims at enhancing the functional performance based on optimizing the rational design objective. The latter is commonly employed {{in determining the}} health status, i. e., the occurrence, location and severity of damage in the structure monitored. In reality, these efforts are inevitably influenced by various uncertainties, i. e., modelling error, measurement noise, and environmental/operational variation etc. In order to achieve effective and robust structural design and identification based on the dynamic responses, in this dissertation a series of inter-related tasks are undertaken, including: A robust design optimization approach in the mean of intentional substructural mistuning to mitigating the negative consequence of random uncertainty in nominally periodic structures, e. g., engine bladed disks, is formulated. Structural dynamic behaviours are often sensitive with respect to surface geometry variation. Based on the NURBS finite element which in theory <b>is</b> <b>conformal</b> <b>with</b> the underlying NURBS geometry, an efficient sensitivity analysis-based inverse optimization is formulated. To further enable NURBS finite element based forward- and inverse- analyses for very large scale structures, a new model order-reduction technique based on the component mode synthesis strategy is formulated. At the presence of uncertainty/variation, model identification/updating, which {{plays an important role}} in design and structural health monitoring, should be carried out in the probabilistic sense. In this part of dissertation, Bayesian inference is integrated with Gaussian process to enable the direct updating of structural finite element model within commercial package by using measurement data. Under certain scenarios, system identification has to be performed with minimal baseline information. An improved mass-response method is formulated, which can identify the supporting stiffness of a bridge-type structure without a priori knowledge To fundamentally enhance the probabilistic prediction efficiency, in the final part of the dissertation a two-level Gaussian process based updating of order-reduced model is synthesized. In summary, in this dissertation a suite of intelligent inference algorithms are devised to address the challenges in structural design and identification problems under uncertainty...|$|E

Flexible copper based fabrication is widely available commercially providing conformance, but not simultaneously stiffness. As a result, these systems are susceptible to reliability problems if repeatedly bent or stretched. The integration of Additive Manufacturing (AM) combined with Direct Print (DP) micro-dispensing can produce shapes of arbitrary and complex form that also allows for 1) miniature cavities for insetting electronic components and 2) conductive traces for electrical interconnect between components. The fabrication freedom introduced by AM techniques such as stereolithography, ultrasonic consolidation (UC), and fused deposition modeling (FDM) have only recently been explored {{in the context of}} electronics integration. Advanced dispensing processes have been integrated into these systems allowing for the introduction of conductive inks to serve as electrical interconnect within intricately-detailed dielectric structures.

The evolution of the coupling constant with lattice spacing is measured at the finite-temperature chiral transition to determine if this theory is asymptotically free and hence QCD-like. The lattice spacing is varied by changing the number of lattice sites, $N_t$, in the Euclidean time direction. QCD with 3 flavours is studied for comparison. Since this theory is expected to <b>be</b> <b>conformal,</b> <b>with</b> an infrared fixed point, the coupling constant at the chiral transition should approach a non-zero value as $N_t$ becomes large. Our earlier simulations on lattices with $N_t= 4 $ and $N_t= 6 $ exhibited {{a significant decrease in}} coupling at the chiral transition as $N_t$ was increased. We have now extended these simulations to $N_t= 8 $, and performed additional simulations at $N_t= 6 $ to measure the coupling constant at the chiral transition more precisely. These indicate that while there is an appreciable decrease in coupling between $N_t= 6 $ and $N_t= 8 $, this is much smaller than that between $N_t= 4 $ and $N_t= 6 $. Thus we are hopeful that we are approaching the large-$N_t$ limit. However, further simulations at larger $N_t$(s) are needed. Comment: 17 pages, 6 figures, LaTeX with postscript figure...|$|R

For the former type of variations, a series of clock genes are operative, giving alternating stimulatory and inhibitory signals to cells. The interplay between external light through a master clock in the brain and cyclic changes in the body due to multiple peripheral cellular clocks in the organs has recently been elucidated. As example of a peripheral clock we have recently shown that the expression of clock genes in both mouse and human hematopoietic stem cells undergoes significant circadian variations.
