40|$|It is {{a common}} {{impression}} that the measured B(H) curves of permanent-magnet materials indicate the temperature and the operating point at which <b>flux</b> <b>losses</b> start to occur. As long as the operating point stays above the knee of the B(H) curve, no losses will be ex-pected. The demagnetization process is, however, a time-dependent process and losses occurring immediately are followed by a thermal aftereffect. Here, we report our study of the time dependence of <b>flux</b> <b>losses</b> in commercial permanent Nd-Fe-B magnets. We present <b>flux</b> <b>losses</b> {{as a function of}} temperature for different exposure times. We then compare the measured B(H) curves of the Nd-Fe-B material to the results of loss measurements. We found that B(H) curves will not always indicate the overall losses well. The measured B(H) curve represents the demagnetization state of the tested magnet more or less after only 10 ms of exposure to the elevated temperature. When the operating point of the magnet is approaching the B(H) curve knee, the time-dependent losses will become significant. To control the time-dependent losses in sintered Nd-Fe-B magnets, the operating point needs to be sufficiently far away from the knee of the B(H) curve.

40|$|When {{using the}} eddy {{correlation}} method to measure turbulent scalar fluxes, {{there is often}} a spatial sepa-ration between the instruments measuring the scalar and the vertical velocity. The attenuation of the flux due to this separation is studied here for marine conditions. Measurements of a two-point covariance between vertical velocity and temperature are compared to covariancemeasurements from collocated sensors for both horizontal and vertical displacements, with the purpose of finding the approximate functions to describe the <b>flux</b> <b>loss</b> for typical separation distances. On the basis of this study’s measurements, there is only a slight directional dependence (i. e., streamwise or crosswind separation) of the <b>flux</b> <b>loss</b> for sensor separation dis-tances less than 1 m but an increasing dependence with increasing displacement distance. For a vertical displacement, observations from this study confirm that <b>flux</b> <b>loss</b> is less with the scalar sensor positioned below the velocity sensor than at an equal distance above. Furthermore, the data show a clear dependence on atmospheric stability with increasing <b>flux</b> <b>loss</b> for increasing stable stratification, but it is not as large as that found in previous studies of flux attenuation over land. For example, the authors compare estimated <b>flux</b> <b>loss</b> for neutral and moderately stable (z/L 5 0. 3) stratification at a measuring height of z 5 10 m and a sensor displacement r 5 0. 3 m, where L is the Obukhov length. For neutral (stable, z/L 5 0. 3) stratification the estimated loss of flux is 3 % (5 %) of the total flux for horizontal displacement. Whereas for an equal vertical separation the estimates are 2 % (4 %) when the scalar sensor is placed above the anemometer but less than 1 % (2 %) if it is placed below. Thus, the authors conclude that placing the scalar sensor below the anemometer minimizes the <b>flux</b> <b>loss</b> due to sensor separation, and that a simple correction function can be used to quantify the mean <b>flux</b> <b>loss</b> due to sensor separation over sea. 1...|$|E

In this study, we alternated observations of the well-suited pair of M-stars GJ 725 A+B to delve into the sub-night High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher for the Northern hemisphere (HARPS-N) response. Besides the possible presence of a low-mass planet orbiting GJ 725 B, our observations reveal changes in the spectral energy distribution (SED) correlated with measurements of {{the width of the}} instrumental line profile and, to a lower degree, with the Doppler measurements. To study the origin of these effects, we searched for correlations among several quantities defined and measured on the spectra and on the acquisition images. We find that the changes in apparent SED are very likely related to <b>flux</b> <b>losses</b> at the fibre input. Further tests indicate that such <b>flux</b> <b>losses</b> do not seriously affect the shape of the instrumental point spread function of HARPS-N, but identify an inefficient fitting of the continuum as the most likely source of the systematic variability observed in the full width at half-maximum. This index, accounting for the HARPS-N cross-correlation profiles width, is often used to decorrelate Doppler time series. We show that the Doppler measurement obtained by a parametric least-squares fitting of the spectrum accounting for continuum variability is insensitive to changes in the slope of the SED, suggesting that forward modelling techniques to measure moments of the line profile are the optimal way to achieve higher accuracy. Remaining residual variability at ∼ 1 m s− 1 suggests that for M-stars Doppler surveys the current noise floor still has an instrumental origin...|$|R

Here we present detailed data reduction {{procedures for the}} VLT/X-shooter UVB and VIS arm. These are not restricted to our particular dataset, but are generally applicable to different kinds of X-shooter data without major limitation on the astronomical object of interest. ESO's X-shooter pipeline (v 1. 5. 0) performs well and reliably for the wavelength calibration and the associated rectification procedure, yet we find several weaknesses in the reduction cascade that are addressed with additional calibration steps, such as bad pixel interpolation, flat fielding, and slit illumination corrections. Furthermore, the instrumental PSF is analytically modeled and used to reconstruct <b>flux</b> <b>losses</b> at slit transit and for optimally extracting point sources. Regular observations of spectrophotometric standard stars allow us to detect instrumental variability, which needs to be understood if a reliable absolute flux calibration is desired. A cascade of additional custom calibration steps is presented that allows for an absolute flux calibration uncertainty of less than ten percent under virtually every observational setup provided that the signal-to-noise ratio is sufficiently high. The optimal extraction increases the signal-to-noise ratio typically {{by a factor of}} 1. 5, while simultaneously correcting for resulting <b>flux</b> <b>losses.</b> The wavelength calibration is found to be accurate to an uncertainty level of approximately 0. 02 Angstrom.

The calibration of the <b>flux</b> <b>loss</b> due to the median removal applied by the PACS pipeline (high-pass filter) is done via dedicated simulations obtained by "polluting" real PACS timelines with fake sources at different flux levels.

It is therefore useful to obtain optimized designs for DC reactors, particularly for the minimization of the winding volume under many constraints. The superconducting magnets of DC reactors can be operated at higher temperature than that of SMES, since the rated current in the case of DC reactors is much smaller. To operate at high temperature (77 K) makes the coolant cost low. However, the <b>flux</b> flow <b>loss</b> becomes large at 77 K, and then it has {{to be taken into account}} at the design stage. In this paper, the optimized configurations of toroidal superconducting magnets for DC reactor are presented and the configurations of HTS conductor are investigated under taking the <b>flux</b> flow <b>loss</b> into account. Index Terms—DC reactor, optimal design, superconducting magnet. I...|$|R
