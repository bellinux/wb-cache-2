5|$|Inside a cold cyclone, 500hPa {{temperatures}} {{can fall}} {{as low as}} , which can initiate convection even in the driest atmospheres. This also explains why moisture in the mid-levels of the troposphere, roughly at the 500hPa level, is normally a requirement for development. However, when dry air is found at the same height, temperatures at 500hPa need to be even colder as dry atmospheres require a greater lapse rate for instability than moist atmospheres. At heights near the tropopause, the 30-year average temperature (as measured in the period encompassing 1961 through 1990) was −77°C (−132°F). A recent example of a tropical cyclone that maintained <b>itself</b> <b>over</b> cooler waters was Epsilon of the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season.|$|E
5|$|The system {{originated}} {{out of an}} upper-level low {{just west}} of the Canary Islands on September28. The low organized <b>itself</b> <b>over</b> the next days, producing several bursts of convection. While remaining non-tropical with a cold core it moved gradually west to northwest. On October3, it became a broad surface low about 400 nautical miles (460mi, 740km) southwest of São Miguel Island in the Azores. Early on October4, convection increased as the surface low organized itself, and the system became a subtropical depression.|$|E

5|$|CCC Camp S-95, {{which opened}} on May 29, 1933 {{on the site}} of an old lumber camp, was able to {{distinguish}} <b>itself</b> <b>over</b> the years it operated in Sullivan County. Two floods swept through the area in 1933 and 1936. The August flood of 1933 caused extensive damage and largely destroyed the newly built camp. During the course of the flooding two young men from Camp S-95 saved the lives of two drowning children at Worlds End State Park. The flood of 1936 covered a large area within the West Branch Susquehanna River Valley. The young men of the CCC camp were among the leaders in the cleaning up after the flood and rebuilding many destroyed bridges and roads. In 1936 the park was officially expanded beyond the original small picnic area. Camp S-95 closed in 1941.|$|E
5|$|Chile {{began to}} seek {{additional}} ships to bolster its fleet in 1919, and the United Kingdom eagerly offered {{many of its}} surplus warships. This action worried nearby nations, who feared that a Chilean attempt to become the region's most powerful navy would destabilize the area and start another naval arms race. Chile asked for Canada and Eagle, the two battleships they ordered before the war, {{but the cost of}} converting the latter back to a battleship was too high. Planned replacements included the two remaining s, but a leak to the press of the secret negotiations to acquire them caused an uproar within Chile <b>itself</b> <b>over</b> the value of such ships. In the end, Chile only bought Canada and four destroyers in April 1920—all ships that had been ordered from British yards by the Chilean government before 1914 but were purchased by the Royal Navy after the British entered the First World War—for relatively low prices. Canada, for instance, was sold for just £1,000,000, less than half of what had been required to construct the ship.|$|E
5|$|Fenix is a praetor {{within the}} {{military}} of the Khalai. Bill Roper voices Fenix in both StarCraft and Brood War. A templar and {{an old friend of}} Tassadar's, Fenix is a powerful and cunning leader, but remains distrustful towards the motives of the ruling judicator caste. Under the command of Aldaris, Fenix helps defend Aiur from the Zerg invasion, but eventually falls in the battle of Antioch when his position is overwhelmed by Zerg and his psi-blades lose power. Nevertheless, Fenix is retrieved and integrated into a dragoon, a mechanical fire support unit designed to allow incapacitated warriors to continue military service. Fenix allies his templar forces with Tassadar's upon the schism between Tassadar and the Protoss government, later leading a task force against the Overmind's outer defenses, facilitating Zeratul's assassination of a number of cerebrates and ultimately the death of the Overmind <b>itself.</b> <b>Over</b> this time, Fenix develops a strong friendship with Tassadar's Terran companion Jim Raynor.|$|E

25|$|Following {{the birth}} of the modern State of Israel in 1948, the Law of Return was enacted to give any Jew the right to immigrate to Israel and become a citizen.

As a result, the Law relied in form on the traditional halakhic definition.

Leduc especially is known for his numerous representations of the mountain in several paintings such as L'Heure Mauve and Neige Dorée, but the mountain also inspired the work of Borduas, such as his Le Trou des Fées and Synthèse d'un paysage de Mont-Saint-Hilaire, and Bonnet, who included the silhouette of the mountain in several of his works.|$|E

25|$|At {{the height}} of the Irish War of Independence, as Tan atrocities reached such a scale as to result in the burning of the city of Cork (leading to {{widespread}} criticism in the United States and from King George V), the Republican Police and Dáil courts reached their zenith, and senior barristers who had qualified within the British courts system also represented defendants in the Dáil Courts. But even after the Truce of July 1921, when the Tans had stopped their activities, the continuing effectiveness of the Dáil courts and police was seen to be patchy. This was in part due to standing down the Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) in early 1922 before a new police force was ready to operate; in the interim the Irish Republican Army (IRA), dividing within <b>itself</b> <b>over</b> the Treaty, was the only police force.|$|E

Affiliates of the radical right organized public burnings of his volumes.
