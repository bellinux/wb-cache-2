5|$|An <b>ethnically</b> <b>diverse</b> region, Abkhazia was {{nominally}} {{led by the}} titular Abkhaz people, {{who made}} up less than 30% of the population; other major groups included Georgians, Armenians, Greeks, and Russians. Even though they did not form the majority, the Abkhaz were heavily favoured, and the Abkhaz language was promoted, {{a result of the}} korenizatsiia policies of the era. An Abkhaz national identity was promoted through these policies, instilling a sense of Abkhaz nationalism.|$|E

5|$|This image's iconic status {{has led to}} parody and satire. New York painter Frank Moore re-created Rockwell's all-white Americans with an <b>ethnically</b> <b>diverse</b> family, as Freedom to Share (1994), {{in which}} the turkey platter brims over with health care supplies. Among the better known reproductions is Mickey and Minnie Mouse {{entertaining}} their cartoon family with a festive turkey. Several political cartoons and even frozen vegetable advertisements have invoked this image.|$|E
5|$|With the {{expansion}} of railroad and industrial jobs in meatpacking, Omaha attracted many new immigrants and migrants. As the major city in Nebraska, it has historically been more racially and <b>ethnically</b> <b>diverse</b> {{than the rest of}} the state. At times rapid population change, overcrowded housing and job competition have aroused racial and ethnic tensions. Around the start of the 20th century, violence towards new immigrants in Omaha often erupted out of suspicions and fears.|$|E
5|$|A final wave of war {{cemetery}} memorials {{were completed}} in the 1930s under the Fascist governments of Germany and Italy. The main Italian war cemeteries were not finished until 1938, and their positioning in some cases carried special political meaning, emphasising Italy's right to claim important, but <b>ethnically</b> <b>diverse,</b> border regions. In Germany, the same decade saw the completion of totenburgen, fortresses of the dead, used as war cemeteries and memorials. These were in some senses {{an extension of the}} cemetery designs of the 1920s, celebrating a natural German landscape, but included extensive modernist, monumental features, intending to highlight German artistic skill.|$|E

5|$|Canada is {{a federal}} {{parliamentary}} democracy and a constitutional monarchy, with Queen Elizabeth II being the head of state. The country is officially bilingual at the federal level. It {{is one of the}} world's most <b>ethnically</b> <b>diverse</b> and multicultural nations, the product of large-scale immigration from many other countries. Its advanced economy is the tenth-largest in the world, relying chiefly upon its abundant natural resources and well-developed international trade networks.

5|$|In 2011, 22.7% of the {{population}} in the Salford USD (Urban Subdivision) were non-white British compared with 15.6% for the surrounding borough. The USD had a slightly larger percentage of Asian and black people. Salford has become a lot more <b>ethnically</b> <b>diverse</b> since the previous census, probably due to the relocation of many BBC establishments from London between 2011 and 2012. This has created lots of jobs and encouraged migration to the area, which was previously very deprived since the loss of many traditional industries in the 20th century.|$|E

5|$|Skopje is an <b>ethnically</b> <b>diverse</b> city, and its urban {{sociology}} primarily depends on {{ethnic and religious}} belonging. Macedonians form 66% of the city population, while Albanians and Roma account respectively for 20% and 6%. Each ethnic group generally restrict itself to {{certain areas of the}} city. Macedonians live south of the Vardar, in areas massively rebuilt after 1963, and Muslims live on the northern side, in the oldest neighbourhoods of the city. These neighbourhoods are considered more traditional, whereas the south side evokes to Macedonians modernity and rupture from rural life.|$|E

5|$|The priory was {{elevated}} {{to the status}} of abbey by Pope Leo XIII in 1894, and the monks founded a school for lay monks to help build a self-sustaining source of revenue. Failing to attract a single prospective applicant in over seven years, they expanded enrollment to students with no intention of joining the clergy. The two groups would eventually be taught separately, and the monastic students were trained to become priests fluent in Bohemian, German, and English and prepared to preach to <b>ethnically</b> <b>diverse</b> congregations. Lay students were trained for employment in the business world.|$|E

5|$|The road {{has long}} {{served as a}} de facto {{cultural}} dividing line between the predominantly poor black city and its wealthier, predominantly white northern suburbs. The perception of 8Mile as the chief dividing line between racial groups and classes persists, {{in part because the}} suburban counties of Oakland and Macomb remain, on the whole, significantly whiter and more prosperous than the city of Detroit. However, in recent years increasing numbers of whites have moved into Detroit, especially around the downtown area, and other neighborhoods in the region have become more <b>ethnically</b> <b>diverse</b> as well.|$|E
5|$|In the United States and Canada, Tower Heist {{opened in}} 3,367 theaters.

5|$|The North Ward is {{surrounded}} by Branch Brook Park. Its neighborhoods include Broadway, Mount Pleasant, Upper Roseville and the affluent Forest Hill section.

The North Ward has lost geographic area in recent times; its southern boundary is now significantly further north than the traditional boundary near Interstate 280. The North Ward historically had a large Italian population; demographics have transitioned to Latino in recent decades, though the ward as a whole remains <b>ethnically</b> <b>diverse.</b>|$|E
