25|$|The {{technique}} {{consists of}} cutting the members to size and then drilling {{a series of}} holes in the joint surface of each member. Holes are often drilled {{with the assistance of}} a <b>dowelling</b> jig which aids in accurate hole placement— accuracy is paramount in this technique to ensure members line up perfectly in the completed joint. The holes are drilled such that there are corresponding holes in each member into which short dowels are inserted with some glue. The joint is brought together and clamped until the glue has dried.|$|E
50|$|The Dowelmax is a loose tenon <b>dowelling</b> jig {{manufactured}} by the O.M.S. Tool company in Canada. The manufacturer {{claims that the}} small manufacturing tolerances of 0.026 mm for the aluminium, brass and steel components of the jig ensure accuracy and repeatability. The precision manufacturing adds to the unit's cost, which is higher than other <b>dowelling</b> jigs.|$|E

50|$|St Mary's Anglican Church Hall {{is a fine}} extant {{example of}} a timber hall, which is {{slightly}} elevated off ground level on small timber stumps. The church hall is clad in timber weatherboards, and is rectangular in shape with a gabled roof lined with corrugated metal sheeting. The hall has verandahs to eastern and western elevations, with a portico entrance with a small gable vent to the southern end. Verandahs on this Hall contain a combination of original timber <b>dowelling</b> balustrades, and more recent metal additions associated with walkways.|$|E
5000|$|The {{original}} {{portion of}} the house (...) has a hipped roof with a projecting front gable and a half front verandah with a curved iron roof. A verandah has been added at an early date {{in front of the}} projecting gable and continuing around {{the eastern side of the}} house overlooking the adjacent laneway. A further skillion-roofed addition to the original front verandah extends over early brick and rendered stucco stairs, which remain in situ under the boards. The verandahs have a recent <b>dowelling</b> balustrade between timber columns, which have decorative timber brackets. The handrail is an angular shape. Flooring to the verandahs is of 4in wide hardwood.|$|E
50|$|Closets - The contestants, {{using their}} stud walls {{from the first}} day to build their closet. Jo will be {{assisting}} Charmaine for this challenge, as Tiina is feeling ill, and with the expert's help, she finishes admirably (with no nails involved in the construction). While Casey uses medium-density fiberboard for their closet exterior (cutting the floor while doing so), everyone else uses lightweight veneer. Dez's overwhelelming reliance on brackets leads him to mismeasure and fail, while Joe's closet was too wide to accommodate his curtain rod. Casey's closet also fails for making his closet too narrow (though Marnie manages to build a curtain rod from <b>dowelling</b> and plumbing parts). Tex, despite cursing a lot, manages to pass the challenge, making a closet that could fit nearly all of the other contestants and nominators inside.|$|E
50|$|Assembling the staves in the trusses to {{form the}} cask was known as raising. Heading was {{the making of the}} heads which fitted into the ends of a cask. The heads were made in four or five {{sections}} of oak according {{to the size of a}} cask. These sections are joined by means of <b>dowelling.</b> When the heads have been prepared with bevels in top and underside to engage with the cask grooves they were put in the casks. Gathering was the completion of the hooping to produce the finished cask. Copper, rather than iron, hoops were used for powder barrels because of the danger of a spark from the iron hoops. When the hoops have been driven home, the cask was said to have been gathered and the hoops were secured by a number of tenter hooks.|$|E
5000|$|The extant St Mary's Anglican Church is a {{red brick}} {{building}} constructed from bricks made in Mount Morgan's own brick works. Other Mount Morgan buildings similarly constructed include the Grand Hotel (1901) {{on the corner of}} Central and Morgan Streets, and the Masonic Temple (...) in Gordon Street. One heritage study detailed:The church is built of red faced bricks and comprises two parts - the main church building, and a vestry addition. The building is unusual for its octagonal apse, which is roofed in sheet iron. The walls of the church have solid brick buttresses and small lancet windows. The interior remains relatively intact: the apse features a timber lined ceiling with exposed joists.The first Church of England erected in Mount Morgan [...] "was a wood and iron structure {{on the site of the}} present Mary's Church hall". Besides the existing 1889 Church is a small timber belltower that is presumed to remain from the first church building. At the rear of the present church is located the St Mary's Church hall. This Church Hall was erected in 1902 on the site of the original church. This Hall has been described as [...] "one of the finest timber halls in the town, both because of its design and also its integrity". The Hall's verandahs comprising alternating large and small timber <b>dowelling</b> balustrades, with a portico entrance with a small gable vent.|$|E
40|$|A {{configurable}} {{circuit breaker}} is disclosed which is, for example, applicable for medium voltage range, with flexibility in configuration, {{based on the}} electrical and mechanical constraints. The circuit breaker can include multiple poles, which can be fitted on a shaft at desired positions, using clamping, <b>dowelling,</b> bolting or other types of connections. An epoxy frame can mount the circuit breaker on a truck horizontally or vertically, by mounting inserts and the clamping mechanism. Side sheets of the pole allow internal access. Flexible contacts and the vertical slots enable adjustability in the incoming and outgoing distances, as per design constraints. A tulip contact can be provided for mounting incoming/outgoing conductors. A common actuator can be mounted anywhere on the shaft, via the movable contact or {{on any of the}} poles, which are robust enough...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{experimental}} studies of soil-reinforcement interaction have generally concentrated {{on the effect of}} reinforcement working in axial tension; this study looks at reinforcement working in bending and shear. The experimental programme was carried out in a large scale direct shear apparatus able to contain a cubic soil sample of side 1 m. A previous study showed that the apparatus required improvements to its boundaries. Modifications to the apparatus resulted in a significant improvement in the performance of the apparatus. The data being comparable with those from direct shearboxes with similar symmetrical boundary conditions. The effect of reinforcement in shear and bending was studied by varying the reinforcement cross section reinforcement orientation, method of installation, and the relative soil- reinforcement stiffness and strength. All tests were carried out on a well graded and uniform quartz sand. The reinforcement was typically mild steel circular bar. Data from tests on instrumented reinforcement bars allowed the distribution of lateral loading to be observed. This {{led to the development of}} a mathematical model for predicting the shear force available from reinforcement in soil. A comparison of this model with the test data and from data in the literature revealed it to provide an accurate upper estimate of reinforcement shear force are much greater than those required for axial force. The conclusions in this dissertation address much of the ambiguity over the use of soil reinforcement in shear and bending for soil nailing and <b>dowelling</b> design...|$|E
40|$|Soil creep is {{important}} as a process affecting landform development, as a factor influencing slope stability and as an element of land wastage. Pew definitive studies have {{been made of the}} process and work on variables controlling rates of soil creep is very limited. Therefore, in the present study it was decided to monitor creep with a number of devices over different lengths of time so that variability over space and time could be determined. This involved investigations on three distinct scales: those of the laboratory, the plot and the drainage basin. To measure rates of creep and to monitor probable controlling variables, new instruments were designed and established procedures were modified. All new instruments were validated and essential features at each stage of the work were replication and the measurement of local variability. After initial tests on experimental plots a drainage basin was selected and instrumented for the pilot study, in which both creep rates and a number of basin variables were investigated. The experimental. design for the main study was then constructed, using six main instruments: Anderson's Inclinometer, Anderson's Tubes, aluminium pillars, <b>dowelling</b> pillars, Young's Pits, and Cassidy's Tubes to monitor rates of creep on each of twenty measuring plots. The basin factors considered as probable controls were categorised, as:(a) external or meteorological(b) surface, including slope angle and vegetation(c) internal, comprising the main soil variables Annual rates of creep, shown to vary from' 0. 3 mm to 2. 4 mm, were correlated with eighteen major basin factors. The results of graphical and statistical analysis showed that rates of creep are controlled by a number of 'force' factors, chiefly soil moisture, field capacity and plasticity index, together with 'resistance' factors, particularly bulk density and a number of shear stress measures. The importance of moisture and its related variables was reinforced by principal component analysis and confirmed in a model produced by stepwise multiple regression. Laboratory experiments with soil troughs demonstrated the relationship between soil movement and meteorological cycles. The daily monitoring of creep for extended periods on an experimental plot allowed short terra movement to be assessed. Further developments indicated by these results include long term monitoring and the mapping of spatial variation of creep over a 'landscape' using the key variables identified...|$|E
