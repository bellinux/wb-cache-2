5|$|Other {{factors that}} broaden the main {{sequence}} band on the HR diagram include {{uncertainty in the}} distance to stars {{and the presence of}} unresolved binary stars that can alter the observed stellar parameters. However, even perfect observation would show a fuzzy main sequence because mass is not the only parameter that affects a star's color and luminosity. Variations in chemical composition caused by the initial abundances, the star's evolutionary status, interaction with a close companion, rapid rotation, or a magnetic field can all slightly change a main-sequence star's HR diagram position, {{to name just a few}} factors. As an example, there are metal-poor stars (with a very low abundance of elements with higher atomic numbers than helium) that lie just below the main sequence and are known as subdwarfs. These stars are fusing hydrogen in their cores and so they mark the lower edge of main sequence <b>fuzziness</b> caused by variance in chemical composition.|$|E
5|$|Spathularia flavida may be {{distinguished}} from the velvet-foot fairy fan (Spathulariopsis velutipes) by differences in the stem: S.velutipes is fuzzy and brown rather than smooth and yellowish. The <b>fuzziness</b> {{is a result of}} a thin layer of intertwined hyphae that cover the stem, which project short hyphae outward from the surface. The closely related species S.neesi has an ochre color, spores that measure 60–80 by 1.5–2µm, and paraphyses that are branched on the upper parts. Neolecta irregularis is roughly similar in appearance to S.flavida, but lacks a sharply differentiated, spoon-shaped head, has a stem lighter in color than the head, and microscopically, has much smaller oval to elliptical spores that measure 5.5–8.5 by 3–4µm. Another yellowish earth-tongue fungus, Microglossum rufum, has a well-defined oval to spoon-shaped head, and sausage- to spindle-shaped spores that are 18–38 by 4–6µm.|$|E

In a detailed case study on unusual morphologies, Rutishauser (2016) illustrated and discussed various topics of plant evo-devo such as the <b>fuzziness</b> (continuity) of morphological concepts, {{the lack of a}} one-to-one correspondence between structural categories and gene expression, the notion of morphospace, the adaptive value of bauplan features versus patio ludens, physiological adaptations, hopeful monsters and saltational evolution, the significance and limits of developmental robustness, etc.|$|E

In recent years, the cartoon has taken a {{politically}} correct tone, except on occasion. After the Sept. 11 attacks, Sourdough Jack was pictured shaking his fist and saying, [...] "It's time to terrorize the terrorists!" [...] About that time, the original Sourdough Jack drawings that had been reproduced since 1952 were replaced by new drawings made in a similar style. This was required due to the growing <b>fuzziness</b> of the reproduced image and the transition to digital newspaper production.|$|E

[...] The crystal is illuminated with a finely focused monochromatic beam of X-rays, producing a diffraction pattern of regularly spaced spots known as reflections. The two-dimensional images taken at different orientations are converted into a three-dimensional model of the density of electrons within the crystal using the mathematical method of Fourier transforms, combined with chemical data known for the sample.

500|$|Philosophers and non-philosophers {{differ in}} their intuitions about what {{consciousness}} is. While most people have a strong intuition {{for the existence of}} what they refer to as consciousness, skeptics argue that this intuition is false, either because the concept of consciousness is intrinsically incoherent, or because our intuitions about it are based in illusions. [...] Gilbert Ryle, for example, argued that traditional understanding of consciousness depends on a Cartesian dualist outlook that improperly distinguishes between mind and body, or between mind and world. He proposed that we speak not of minds, bodies, and the world, but of individuals, or persons, acting in the world. Thus, by speaking of [...] "consciousness" [...] we end up misleading ourselves by thinking that there is any sort of thing as consciousness separated from behavioral and linguistic understandings. [...] More generally, many philosophers and scientists have been unhappy about the difficulty of producing a definition that does not involve circularity or <b>fuzziness.</b>|$|E
500|$|A {{recording}} of the concert was released five months later, on February 16, 1982. [...] The audio tracks were put through album postproduction, but it was noted by Rolling Stone magazine {{that they were not}} completely polished, and preserved the roar and the <b>fuzziness</b> of live rock music heard through a loudspeaker. Two songs were removed from the album version: the interrupted [...] "Late Great Johnny Ace", and the encore reprise of [...] "Late in the Evening". The album was an international success. It peaked at number six on the Billboard 200 chart, and was certified 2×Multi-Platinum with sales of over 2 million copies in USA. The album sold more than 1,270,000 copies in France, where it was certified Diamond. It was also successful in seven other countries, including France and New Zealand. Originally the album was released as a double LP and as a single Compact Cassette. In 1988 it was issued as a single CD. Various reissues in different formats have been released, including, alongside the DVD, a 2-CD-release also containing the two missing songs from the original album.|$|E

2500|$|In one of {{his works}} G. Dumézil has {{postulated}} {{the existence of a}} structural difference in level between the Indo-European gods of beginning and ending and the other gods who fall into a tripartite structure, reflecting the most ancient organization of society. So in IE religions there is an introducer god (as Vedic Vâyu and Roman Janus) and a god of ending, a nurturer goddess and a genie of fire (as Vedic Saraswati and Agni, Avestic Armaiti, Anâitâ and Roman Vesta) who show a sort of mutual solidarity: the concept of 'god of ending' is defined in connection to the human referential, i.e. the current situation of man in the universe, and not to endings as transitions, which are {{under the jurisdiction of the}} gods of beginning owing to the ambivalent nature of the concept. Thus the god of beginning is not structurally reducible to a sovereign god, nor the goddess of ending to any of the three categories on to which the goddesses are distributed. There is though a greater degree of <b>fuzziness</b> concerning the function and role of goddesses, which may have formed a preexisting structure allowing the absorption of the local Mediterranean mother goddesses, nurturers and protectresses [...]|$|E
2500|$|The {{widespread}} use in mass media {{of the term}} Islamofascism has been challenged as confusing because of its conceptual <b>fuzziness.</b> George Orwell, it has been noted in this connection, observed as early as 1946 that [...] "he word Fascism has now no meaning except {{in so far as}} it signifies 'something not desirable'", and linking Islam to that concept was more a matter of denigration than of ideological clarity. Chibli Mallat, while noting that the term is controversial, thinks it warranted but notes that there is something anomalous about Islam being singled out, since fascist practices among Jews in Israel, Buddhists in Burma, and Narendra Modi's Hindi constituencies in India do not generate the same terminology: one rarely hears of Hindu-, Buddhist- or Judeo-fascism. A number of scholars and thinkers, such as Michel Onfray, Michael Howard, Jeffrey Herf, Walter Laqueur, and Robert Wistrich have argued that the link between fascism and Islam/Islamic radicalism is sound. Many scholars who specialize in Islam and the Arabic world are skeptical of the thesis: Reza Aslan, for one, identifies the roots of jihadism not in the Qur'an, but in the writings of modern Arab anti-colonialists and, doctrinally, to Ahmad Ibn Taymiyyah [...] Historians like Niall Ferguson dismiss the word as an [...] "extraordinary neologism" [...] positing a conceptual analogy when there is [...] "virtually no overlap between the ideology of al Qaeda and fascism".|$|E
2500|$|A yarn's {{usefulness}} for a knitting {{project is}} judged by several factors, {{such as its}} loft (its ability to trap air), its resilience (elasticity under tension), its washability and colorfastness, its hand (its feel, particularly softness vs. scratchiness), its durability against abrasion, its resistance to pilling, its hairiness (<b>fuzziness),</b> its tendency to twist or untwist, its overall weight and drape, its blocking and felting qualities, its comfort (breathability, moisture absorption, wicking properties) and of course its look, which includes its color, sheen, smoothness and ornamental features. [...] Other factors include allergenicity; speed of drying; resistance to chemicals, moths, and mildew; melting point and flammability; retention of static electricity; and the propensity to become stained and to accept dyes. [...] Different factors may be more significant than others for different knitting projects, {{so there is no}} one [...] "best" [...] yarn. [...] The resilience and propensity to (un)twist are general properties that affect the ease of hand-knitting. [...] More resilient yarns are more forgiving of irregularities in tension; highly twisted yarns are sometimes difficult to knit, whereas untwisting yarns can lead to split stitches, in which not all the yarn is knitted into a stitch. [...] A key factor in knitting is stitch definition, [...] corresponding to how well complicated stitch patterns can be seen when made from a given yarn. [...] Smooth, highly spun yarns are best for showing off stitch patterns; at the other extreme, very fuzzy yarns or eyelash yarns have poor stitch definition, and any complicated stitch pattern would be invisible.|$|E

50|$|Linear partial {{information}} (LPI) is {{a method}} of making decisions based on insufficient or fuzzy information. LPI was introduced in 1970 by Polish - Swiss mathematician Edward Kofler (1911-2007) to simplify decision processes. Comparing to other methods the LPI-fuzziness is algorithmically simple and particularly in decision making, more practically oriented. Instead of an indicator function the decision maker linearizes any <b>fuzziness</b> by establishing of linear restrictions for fuzzy probability distributions or normalized weights. In the LPI-procedure the decision maker linearizes any <b>fuzziness</b> instead of applying a membership function. This {{can be done by}} establishing stochastic and non-stochastic LPI-relations. A mixed stochastic and non-stochastic fuzzification is often a basis for the LPI-procedure. By using the LPI-methods any <b>fuzziness</b> in any decision situation can be considered on the base of the linear fuzzy logic.|$|E
