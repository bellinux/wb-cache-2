50|$|The Giants and Big Heads {{are without}} a doubt {{one of the most}} beloved traditions for the people of Zaragoza. Giant costumed figures made of papier-mâché are made to look disproportionately big-headed, in the case of “cabezudos”, or huge like giants, in the case of “gigantes”. During the festival, the giants process daily around the streets, {{covering}} all areas of the city. There are ten “cabezudos”, with different names, and all of them wearing different costumes. The cabezudos depict well known local characters (such as “el Morico”, “el Boticario”, “el Robaculeros”, “el Torero”, “el Tuerto”, “el Forano”, “la Forana”, “el Verrugón”, “la Pilara” and el “Azutero”) and each of them has its own song. The cabezudos are teased by the children and teens, and they answer to this provocation by chasing them along the streets and hitting them gently with whipcords. The gigantes, or Giants, are a more formal part of the show, with a cast of regal and noble medieval and historic characters that entertain the people with their elegant <b>dances</b> <b>in</b> <b>pairs.</b> The current giants were designed in 1849 by the sculptor Felix Oroz.|$|E
