5000|$|Glass knives can be {{produced}} by hand using pliers with two raised bumps on one jaw and a single bump between the two bumps on the opposing jaw, but special machines called [...] "knife-makers" [...] are used in most electron microscopy laboratories to ensure repeatable results. The glass used typically starts out as 1 in strips of 1/4 in plate glass, which is cut into 1 in squares. The <b>glass</b> <b>square</b> is then scored across the diagonal with a steel or tungsten carbide glass-cutting wheel to determine where the square will break, and pressure is then applied gradually across the opposite diagonal until the square breaks. This technique provides two usable knife edges, one {{on each of the}} two resulting triangles. The better the break is aligned with the diagonal, the better the cutting edge.|$|E
40|$|X-rays have a {{particular}} sort of currency at the sanatorium in Thomas Mann’s novel The Magic Mountain. “Ah, you carry it in a case. Like a certificate, as it were—a sort of membership card, ” says a fellow in-patient to our protagonist, Hans Castorp. And then, approvingly, “Very good. Let me see it ” [1]. The tubercular residents of this mountaintop clinic commonly keep small copies of their X-rays in a pocket, ready for display and perusal. These “intimate photographs ” are more precious than conventional portraits; Hans begs his beloved Clavdia for her own tiny X-ray print to hold as a memento during her absence from the sanatorium. While he pines for her, he looks into the little <b>glass</b> <b>square</b> and takes comfort and pleasure {{in the sight of}} her thoracic cavity. Patients at the clinic know each other as much by lesions and fevers as by names and faces.

Local {{heat transfer}} coefficient was calculated from the temperature measured by using temperature recorder with SD memory card data logger with sensor type K thermocouple positioned along the test section.

In addition a high speed camera was used in order to obtain images sequence of the flow under different selected conditions. The flow regimes, which are stratified, intermittent, and annular flow are observed and recorded by high speed camera. At 5 o inclination angle and low air-water superficial velocity stratified flow observed, transition from stratified to intermittent flow and annular flow occurs at increasing the inclination angle and air-water superficial velocity.

40|$|The {{accumulation}} of platelets near the blood vessel wall or artificial surface {{is an important}} factor in the cascade of events responsible for coagulation and/or thrombosis. In small blood vessels and flow channels this phenomenon has been attributed to the blood phase separation that creates a red blood cell (RBC) -poor layer near the wall. We hypothesized that blood soluble drag-reducing polymers (DRP), which were previously shown to lessen the near-wall RBC depletion layer in small channels, may consequently reduce the near-wall platelet excess. This study investigated the effects of DRP on the lateral distribution of platelet-sized fluorescent particles (diam. = 2 μm, 2. 5 × 10 ⁸/ml) in a <b>glass</b> <b>square</b> microchannel (width and depth = 100 μm). RBC suspensions in PBS were mixed with particles and driven through the microchannel at flow rates of 6 - 18 ml/h with and without added DRP (10 ppm of PEO, MW = 4500 kDa). Microscopic flow visualization revealed an elevated concentration of particles in the near-wall region for the control samples at all tested flow rates (between 2. 4 ± 0. 8 times at 6 ml/h and 3. 3 ± 0. 3 times at 18 ml/h). The addition of a minute concentration of DRP virtually eliminated the near-wall particle excess, effectively resulting in their even distribution across the channel, suggesting a potentially significant role of DRP in managing and mitigating thrombosis...|$|E

40|$|The {{polysaccharide}} {{hyaluronic acid}} (Hyal) was photoimmobilized on glass surfaces {{to obtain a}} pattern with squares and rectangles of different dimensions and chemistry.

40|$|Purpose. The aim of {{this paper}} was to study the {{influence}} of chemical and topographical signals on cell behaviour and to obtain a heterotypic cell-cell interaction on microstructured domains. Methods. The polysaccharide hyaluronic acid (Hyal) was photoimmobilised on glass surfaces in order to obtain a pattern with squares and rectangles of different dimensions and chemistry. The microstructured surfaces were characterised by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). The behaviour of Human Coronary Artery Endothelial Cells (HCAEC) and human tumoral dermal fibroblasts (C 54) was investigated on these micropatterned surfaces by adhesion studies. Moreover heterotypic interaction among C 54 and HCAEC adhered on patterned surfaces was evaluated by time-lapse video microscopy. Results. Surface analysis revealed the presence of a pattern consisting of alternating glass and Hyal microstructures whose dimensions decreased from the centre {{to the edge of the}} sample. Neither HCAEC nor C 54 adhered to the immobilised Hyal but both adapted their shape to the different sizes of the <b>glass</b> <b>squares</b> and rectangles. The number of adherent cells depended on the dimensions of both the glass domains and the nuclei of the cells. Co-cultured C 54 on HCAEC patterned surfaces showed a heterotypic cell-cell interaction in the same chemical and topographic domain. Conclusions. A heterotypic cell-cell interaction occurred in the same chemical and topographic micro-domains but in narrow areas only. Moreover, the number of cells adhering to the glass domains and cell morphology depended on the dimensions of both adhesive areas and cell nuclei...|$|R
