25|$|Besides {{actively}} {{participating in}} the current discussions on evolutionary theory and genetics, Mosterín has also tackled issues like the definition of life itself or the ontology of biological organisms and species. Following in Aristotle’s and Schrödinger’s footsteps, he has been asking the simple question: what is life? He has analyzed the main proposed definitions, based on metabolism, reproduction, thermodynamics, complexity and evolution, and found all of them wanting. It is true that all organisms on Earth share many characteristics, from the encoding of genetic information in DNA to the storage of energy in ATP, but these common features merely reflect the inheritance from a common ancestor that possibly acquired them in a random way. From that point of view, our biology is the parochial science of life on Earth, rather than a universal science of life in general. Such a general biology seems impossible, {{as long as we}} do not detect and come to know other forms of life in the galaxy (if they exist). Concerning the ontological thesis of Michael Ghiselin and David Hull on the individuality of biological species, Mosterín shows that they are neither classes nor individuals in the usual meaning of these words. He tries to extend and make more precise the available conceptual framework of the discussion. Specifically, he shows the <b>formal</b> <b>equivalence</b> of the set-theoretical and the mereological (or part and individual) approach, so that everything that can be said about the classes can be translated into the jargon of individuals, and the other way around. All these concerns converge in his recent philosophy of animality, which combines the ontology of animals as paradigmatic individuals with the insights and results of biological research. This general theory of animals provides a solid foundation for the development of anthropology, conceived as the science of human primates.|$|E

Similar problems arise for other sizes, signed or unsigned. Compiler writers will handle the likes of for counter := 0 to 65535 do ... next counter, possibly by producing code that inspects the state of an [...] "overflow" [...] indicator, but unless there is some provision for the equivalent checking when calculating counter := counter + 1; the while-loop equivalence will fail because the counter will never exceed 65535 and so the loop will never end - unless some other mishap occurs.|$|E

The goal of the present paper is twofold. First, we clarify the relationship between <b>formal</b> Morita <b>equivalence,</b> Ara's notion of Morita ^*-equivalence of rings with involution, and strong Morita equivalence of C^*-algebras. Second, in the general setting of ^*-algebras over C, we define `closed' ^*-ideals as the ones occuring as kernels of ^*-representations of these algebras on pre-Hilbert spaces. These ideals form a lattice which we show is invariant under <b>formal</b> Morita <b>equivalence.</b> This result, when applied to Pedersen ideals of C^*-algebras, recovers the so-called Rieffel correspondence theorem. The triviality of the minimal element in the lattice of closed ideals, called the `minimal ideal', is also a formal Morita invariant and this fact can be used to describe a large class of examples of ^*-algebras over C with equivalent representation theory but which are not formally Morita equivalent. We finally compute the closed ^*-ideals of some ^*-algebras arising in differential geometry. Comment: LaTeX 2 e, 19 page...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} algebras with involution over a ring C which {{is given by}} the quadratic extension by i of an ordered ring R. We discuss the *-representation theory of such *-algebras on pre-Hilbert spaces over C and develop the notions of Rieffel induction and <b>formal</b> Morita <b>equivalence</b> for this category analogously to the situation for C*-algebras. Throughout this paper, the notion of positive functionals and positive algebra elements will be crucial for all constructions. As {{in the case of}} C*-algebras, we show that the GNS construction of *-representations can be understood as Rieffel induction and, moreover, that <b>formal</b> Morita <b>equivalence</b> of two *-algebras, which is defined by the existence of a bimodule with certain additional structures, implies the equivalence of the categories of strongly non-degenerate *-representations of the two *-algebras. We discuss various examples like finite rank operators on pre-Hilbert spaces and matrix algebras over *-algebras. <b>Formal</b> Morita <b>equivalence</b> is shown to imply Morita equivalence in the ring-theoretic framework. Finally, we apply our considerations to deformation theory and in particular to deformation quantization and discuss the classical limit and the deformation of equivalence bimodules. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.

40|$|Abstract—This work {{investigates the}} use of finite abstractions for the {{verification}} of autonomous Max-Plus-Linear (MPL) models. Abstractions are characterized as finite-state labeled transition systems (LTS) and are obtained by first partitioning the state space of the MPL and associating states of the LTS to the partitions, then by defining relations among the vertices of the LTS, corresponding to dynamical transitions between the MPL state partitions, and finally by labeling the LTS edges according to one-step time properties {{of the events of}} the MPL model. In order to establish <b>formal</b> <b>equivalences,</b> the finite LTS abstraction is proven to either simulate or to bisimulate the original MPL model, the difference depending on its determinism. The computational performance of the abstraction procedure is tested on a benchmark. The work then studies properties of the original MPL model by verifying equivalent specifications on the finite LTS abstraction. I...|$|R
40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of genomic imprinting has recently excited much interest among experimental biologists. The population genetic consequences of imprinting, however, have remained largely unexplored. Several population genetic models are presented {{and the following}} conclusions drawn: (i) systems with genomic imprinting need not behave similarly to otherwise identical systems without imprinting; (ii) nevertheless, many of the models investigated can {{be shown to be}} formally equivalent to models without imprinting; (iii) consequently, imprinting often cannot be discovered by following allele frequency changes or examining equilibrium values; (iv) the <b>formal</b> <b>equivalences</b> fail to preserve some well known properties. For example, for populations incorporating genomic imprinting, parameter values exist that cause these populations to behave like populations without imprinting, but with heterozygote advantage, even though no such advantage is present in these imprinting populations. We call this last phenomenon ``pseudoheterosis. '' The imprinting systems that fail to be formally equivalent to nonimprinting systems are those in which males and females are not equivalent, i. e., two-sex viability systems and sex-chromosome inactivation...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} describing the local biholomorphic equivalence class of a real-analytic hypersurface M at a distinguished point p_ 0 ∈ M by giving a normal form for such objects. In order for the normal form to carry useful information about the biholomorphic equivalence class, we shall require that the transformation to normal form is unique modulo some finite dimensional group. A classical result due to Chern [...] Moser gives such a normal form for Levi nondegenerate hypersurfaces. The main results in this paper concern real-analytic hypersurfaces M in C^ 3 at certain Levi degenerate points p_ 0 ∈ M, namely points at which M is 2 -nondegenerate. We give a partial normal form for all such (M,p_ 0), i. e. a normal form for the data associated with 2 -nondegeneracy. We also give a complete formal normal form for such (M,p_ 0) under the additional condition that the Levi form has rank one at p_ 0. This result, combined with a recent theorem due to the author, M.

When presented dichoptically the signal regions were interdigitated across eyes but produced a smooth continuous grating following their linear binocular sum. The average summation ratio (C t 1 /([C t 1 + 2]) for this stimulus pair was 1. 64 (4. 3 dB).
