40|$|The actual {{trends in}} {{development}} and series application of mixture formation techniques for SI engines converge irrevocably {{to a process}} after scavenging, by direct injection, the reason being the higher thermal efficiency in a wide operation range of the engine, leading to substantially lower bsfc and pollutant emission. After numerous and successful research projects of direct injection for two-stroke engines, the most of series applications are being introduced for four-stroke automotive engines. A main reason for this profitable way consists in the better fluid dynamic conditions and in the longer time for mixture formation {{in the case of}} the <b>four-stroke</b> <b>process.</b> The aim of the fluid dynamic analysis presented in the paper was to find a configuration of the injection system and its parameters able to achieve optimum conditions for mixture formation as a controlled spray distribution in the air for a wide engine operation range and with special regard to the two-stroke cycle respectively to very small swept volume as extreme requirements. The analysis consists in a process simulation and a fuel jet optimization based on the CFD code FLUENT, followed by the experimental determination of the jet form. The comparison of computational results and the jet visualization, presented for three different injector needle forms, confirms the combined method of analysis and optimization as very effective...|$|E
40|$|Natural gas, {{which is}} {{primarily}} composed of methane, o ers many advantages over other hydrocarbon fuels {{for use in}} reciprocating piston engines. Generally, these include: a high octane rating, wide ammability limits, a high gravimetric energy content, reduced CO 2 output, {{and lower levels of}} harmful exhaust gas emissions. However, natural gas presents some unique challenges due to its low density and slow laminar burning velocity. The former causes issues with volumetric e ciency and/or charge homogeneity depending on the fuel delivery method. The latter results in prolonged combustion durations that are counter-productive to high fuel conversion e ciencies. A split-cycle engine divides the conventional <b>four-stroke</b> engine <b>process</b> between two adjoining cylinders: one cylinder for intake and compression, the second cylinder for combustion and exhaust. The passage that connects these two cylinders together provides an alternative location for fuel injection and mixing. Furthermore, the uid exchange process occurring from this passage to the combustion chamber is a source of turbulence generation desired to enhance the rate of combustion. In this work a spark ignition split-cycle research engine has been developed and tested for the purpose of evaluating its ability to alleviate the aforementioned problems associated with natural gas (methane) fuelled engines. A novel fuel injector location and timing have been employed and the results show excellent mixture homogeneity was achieved. The fuelling strategy also decoupled the injection event from the engine 2 Ì† 7 s intake air ow rate; however, the volumetric e ciency still remained low, between 7175...|$|R
