40|$|We study two {{mechanisms}} for enhancing the superconducting transition temperature Tc by nonmagnetic disorder in both conventional (sign-preserving gaps) and unconventional (sign-changing gaps) superconductors (SC). In the first scenario, relevant to multi-band {{systems in the}} dilute <b>impurity</b> <b>limit</b> of both conventional and unconventional SC, we demonstrate how favorable density of states enhancements driven by resonant states in off-Fermi-level bands, lead to significant enhancements of Tc in the condensate formed by the near-Fermi-level bands. The second scenario focuses on the dense <b>impurity</b> <b>limit</b> where random disorder-generated local density of states modulations cause a boosted Tc for conventional SC with short coherence lengths. We analyze the basic physics of both mechanisms within simplified models, and discuss the relevance to existing materials. Comment: 6 pages, 4 figure...|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} {{detailed}} numerical {{study of the}} orthogonality catastrophe exponent for a one-dimensional lattice model of spinless fermions with nearest neighbor interaction using the density matrix remormalization group algorithm. Keeping up to 1200 states per block we achieve a very great accuracy for the overlap which is needed to extract the orthogonality exponent reliably. We discuss {{the behavior of the}} exponent for three different kinds of a localized impurity. For comparison we also discuss the non-interacting case. In the weak <b>impurity</b> <b>limit</b> our results for the overlap confirm scaling behavior expected from perturbation theory and renormalization group calculations. In particular we find that a weak backward scattering component of the orthogonality exponent scales to zero for attractive interaction. In the strong <b>impurity</b> <b>limit</b> and for repulsive interaction we demonstrate that the orthogonality exponent cannot be extracted from the overlap for systems with up to 100 sites, due to finite size effects. This is in contradiction to an earlier interpretation given by Qin et al. based on numerical data for much smaller system sizes. Neverthless we find indirect evidence that the backward scattering contribution to the exponent scales to 1 / 16 based on predictions of boundary conformal field theory.

Graphene has been heralded as an ideal material to achieve spin manipulation but so far new paradigms and demonstrators are limited.

Several important effects can be studied: volume expansion, shift of the bare Pu on-site f energy level, and the reduction of the hybridization cloud resulting from the collective character of the Kondo effect in the Anderson lattice.

40|$|We {{examine the}} role of order-parameter {{suppression}} {{in the development of}} low-energy peaks (i. e., resonances) in the tunneling density of states near a non-magnetic impurity in a d-wave superconductor. Without order-parameter suppression, the zero-energy resonance appears only in the unitary (i. e., strong <b>impurity)</b> <b>limit.</b> However, suppression makes the resonance appear even when the impurity is much weaker. To model this situation, we make the physical hypothesis that the order parameter is reduced whenever one electron of a Cooper pair encounters the impurity, a hypothesis that retains the exact solvability of the problem. In this way, we determine that suppression of the order parameter drives the effective strength of the impurity towards the unitary limit. We determine the order-parameter reduction variationally, and show that the ratios between the main energy scales [...] the band width and superconducting gap [...] strongly affect this reduction and, in consequence, the position and width of the resonance.
