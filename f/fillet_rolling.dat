40|$|Abstract. The paper {{sets up the}} Finite Element Model on {{the basis}} of {{crankshaft}} <b>fillet</b> <b>rolling</b> experiment and its mechanism. And then the paper shows the distribution of the residual stress in different depths of rolled crankshaft fillet through numerical simulation. It is found that the fatigue strength can greatly be produced by the method of the engine crankshaft <b>fillet</b> <b>rolling</b> in most of fillet areas; Simultaneously, two strips of tensile stress which is related to reduce the crankshaft fatigue strength will be generated in the peripheries. The tensile stress strips only emerge in the surface layer of the fillet, and then mainly disappear in the depths of 0. 4 mm below the surface layer. The paper concludes that the main reason of strips of tensile stress lies on the transition between the deformed region and the non-deformed reformed region after trolley wheel pressure is imposed on through a further research...|$|E

Purely analytical {{models of}} the tool contact area are difficult to formulate, resulting in numerical approaches that are case-specific. Provided are the details of an analytical model that describes the steady-state tooling/workpiece contact area allowing for easy modification of the dominant geometric variables. The assumptions made in formulating this analytical model are validated with experimental results attained from physical modelling. The analysis procedure can be extended to other rotary forming operations such as metal spinning, shear forming, thread rolling and crankshaft <b>fillet</b> <b>rolling.</b> Comment: 28 pages, 11 figure...|$|E
40|$|Abstract:The overall {{objective}} of this project was to evaluate and compare the fatigue performance of two competing manufacturing technologies for aerospace crankshafts, namely forged steel and ductile cast iron. In this project a dynamic simulation was conducted on two crankshafts, forged steel and ductile cast iron, from similar four cylinder four stroke engines. Finite element analysis was performed to obtain the variation of stress magnitude at critical locations. The pressure-volume diagram was {{used to calculate the}} load boundary condition in dynamic simulation model, and other simulation inputs were taken from the engine specification chart. The dynamic analysis was done analytically and was verified by simulations in ANSYS. Results achieved from aforementioned analysis were used in optimization of the forged steel crankshaft. Geometry, material, and manufacturing processes were optimized considering different constraints, manufacturing feasibility, and cost. The optimization Process included geometry changes compatible with the current engine, <b>fillet</b> <b>rolling,</b> and the use of micro alloyed steel, resulting in increased fatigue strength and reduced cost of the crankshaft, without changing connecting rod and or engine block...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare the durability of crankshafts from two competing manufacturing processes, as well as to perform dynamic load and stress analysis, and optimization. The crankshafts used in the study were forged steel and ductile cast iron from a one-cylinder gasoline engine. Strain-controlled monotonic and fatigue tests as well as impact tests were performed on specimens machined from the crankshafts. Load-controlled component bending fatigue tests were also carried out on the crankshafts. Material tests showed that the forged steel had 26 % higher tensile strength and 37 % higher fatigue strength than the ductile cast iron, while component tests showed that the forged steel crankshaft had 32 % higher fatigue strength resulting in a factor of six longer fatigue life. The S-N approach used to predict the fatigue lives of both crankshafts showed reasonable correlation to the experimental data from the component tests. Dynamic load analysis was performed to determine the in service loading of the crankshafts and FEA was conducted to find stresses at critical locations. Finally, the geometry, material, and manufacturing processes were optimized for the forged steel crankshaft. The optimization process included geometry changes compatible with the current engine, <b>fillet</b> <b>rolling,</b> and the use of MA steel, resulting in 18 % weight reduction, increased fatigue strength and reduced cost of the crankshaft...|$|E
