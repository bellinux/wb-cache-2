5|$|Evolutionary {{developmental}} biology ('Evo Devo') has assembled evidence from embryology and genetics {{to show how}} evolution has acted at all scales from the whole organism down to individual genes, proteins and genetic switches. In the case of countershaded mammals with dark (often brownish) upper parts and lighter (often buff or whitish) under parts, {{such as in the}} house mouse, it is the Agouti gene which creates the difference in shading. Agouti encodes for a protein, the Agouti signalling peptide (ASP), which specifically inhibits the action of the Melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R). In the absence of the Agouti protein, alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone stimulates the cells bearing MC1R, melanocytes, to produce dark eumelanin, colouring the skin and fur dark brown or black. In the presence of the Agouti protein, the same system produces the lighter-coloured, yellow or red phaeomelanin. A <b>genetic</b> <b>switch</b> active in the cells of the embryo that will become the belly skin causes the Agouti gene to become active there, creating the countershading seen in adult mammals.|$|E
5|$|In Batesian mimicry, {{the mimic}} {{effectively}} copies the coloration of an aposematic animal, {{known as the}} model, to deceive predators into behaving {{as if it were}} distasteful. The success of this dishonest display depends on the level of toxicity of the model and the abundance of the model in the geographical area. The more toxic the model is, {{the more likely it is}} that the predator will avoid the mimic. The abundance of the model species is also important for the success of the mimic because of frequency dependent selection. When the model is abundant, mimics with imperfect model patterns or slightly different coloration from the model are still avoided by predators. This is because the predator has a strong incentive to avoid potentially lethal organisms, given the likelihood of encountering one. However, in areas where the model is scarce or locally extinct, mimics are driven to accurate aposematic coloration. This is because predators attack imperfect mimics more readily where there is little chance that they are the model species. Frequency dependent selection may also have driven Batesian mimics to become polymorphic in rare cases where a single <b>genetic</b> <b>switch</b> controls appearance, as in the swallowtail butterflies (the Papilionidae).|$|E

25|$|While epigenetics is of {{fundamental}} importance in eukaryotes, especially metazoans, it plays a different role in bacteria. Most importantly, eukaryotes use epigenetic mechanisms primarily to regulate gene expression which bacteria rarely do. However, bacteria make {{widespread use of}} postreplicative DNA methylation for the epigenetic control of DNA-protein interactions. Bacteria also use DNA adenine methylation (rather than DNA cytosine methylation) as an epigenetic signal. DNA adenine methylation is important in bacteria virulence in organisms such as Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Vibrio, Yersinia, Haemophilus, and Brucella. In Alphaproteobacteria, methylation of adenine regulates the cell cycle and couples gene transcription to DNA replication. In Gammaproteobacteria, adenine methylation provides signals for DNA replication, chromosome segregation, mismatch repair, packaging of bacteriophage, transposase activity and regulation of gene expression. There exists a <b>genetic</b> <b>switch</b> controlling Streptococcus pneumoniae (the pneumococcus) that allows the bacterium to randomly change its characteristics into six alternative states that could {{pave the way to}} improved vaccines. Each form is randomly generated by a phase variable methylation system. The ability of the pneumococcus to cause deadly infections is different in each of these six states. Similar systems exist in other bacterial genera.|$|E

40|$|One of the {{fundamental}} cellular processes governed by genetic regulatory networks in cells is the transition among different states under the intrinsic and extrinsic noise. Based on a two-state <b>genetic</b> <b>switching</b> model with positive feedback, we develop a framework to understand the metastability in gene expressions.

30|$|Hematopoiesis is {{a highly}} orchestrated {{developmental}} process that comprises various developmental stages of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). During development, the decision to leave the self-renewing state and selection of a differentiation pathway is regulated {{by a number of}} transcription factors.

The transcription factors PU. 1 and GATA- 1 are known to be important in the development of blood progenitor cells. Specifically they are thought to regulate the differentiation of progenitor cells into the granulocyte/macrophage lineage and the erythrocyte/megakaryocite lineage. Although extensive experimental studies have revealed the mechanisms to regulate the expression of these two genes, it is still unclear how this simple module regulates the <b>genetic</b> <b>switching</b> [1, 2].|$|R

With regard to genetic assimilation, Waddington proposed that it is the process in which an environmental stimulus that affects the phenotype has been superseded by an internal genetic factor during the course of evolution. While such mechanisms could potentially account for permanent changes in the diploid genome of the cancer cell or other unicellular organisms, how information to activate such an internal <b>genetic</b> <b>switch</b> is transmitted to the germline for stable inheritance in metazoans reproducing sexually remains an important and intriguing question.|$|E

40|$|The {{ability to}} {{independently}} control {{the expression of}} multiple genes by addition of distinct small-molecule modulators has many applications from synthetic biology, functional genomics, pharmaceutical target validation, through to gene therapy. Riboswitches are relatively simple, small-molecule–dependent, protein-free, mRNA <b>genetic</b> <b>switches</b> that are attractive targets for reengineering in this context. Using a combination of chemical genetics and genetic selection, we have developed riboswitches that are selective for synthetic “nonnatural” small molecules and no longer respond to the natural intracellular ligands. The orthogonal selectivity of the riboswitches is also demonstrated in vitro using isothermal titration calorimetry and x-ray crystallography. The riboswitches allow highly responsive, dose-dependent, orthogonally selective, and dynamic control of gene expression in vivo. It is possible that this approach may be further developed to reengineer other natural riboswitches for application as small-molecule responsive <b>genetic</b> <b>switches</b> in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes...|$|R
40|$|Many {{cellular}} processes require {{decision making}} mechanisms, which must act reliably {{even in the}} unavoidable presence of substantial amounts of noise.

Changes in regulatory mechanisms may result in <b>genetic</b> <b>switching</b> in a bistable system. Recently, more and more experimental evidence in the form of bimodal population distributions indicates that noise plays a very important role in the switching of bistable systems. Although deterministic models have been used for studying the existence of bistability properties under various system conditions, these models cannot realize cell-to-cell fluctuations in <b>genetic</b> <b>switching.</b> However, there is a lag in the development of stochastic models for studying the impact of noise in bistable systems {{because of the lack of}} detailed knowledge of biochemical reactions, kinetic rates, and molecular numbers. in this work, we develop a previously undescribed general technique for developing quantitative stochastic models for large-scale genetic regulatory networks by introducing Poisson random variables into deterministic models described by ordinary differential equations.

40|$|Temperate bacteriophages {{can grow}} lytically, {{producing}} progeny phage and lysing the host, or lysogenically, integrating into the chromosome and shutting off {{the expression of}} lytic genes. The decision is controlled by a <b>genetic</b> <b>switch,</b> which senses host intracellular conditions and chooses a program of gene expression to employ. The <b>genetic</b> <b>switch</b> of mycobacteriophage BPs requires integration to produce stable repressor protein and maintain lysogeny. The regulation of this switch is controlled at the protein level, not at transcription initiation.

The overall result of the <b>genetic</b> <b>switch</b> is determining the program of transcription. In lytic growth, genes are temporally expressed to replicate the phage genome, assemble progeny phage and lyse the host.

We sought to understand the <b>genetic</b> <b>switch</b> of mycobacteriophage BPs and the transcriptional profile of gene expression.
