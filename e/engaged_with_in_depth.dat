This {{question}} should sound familiar to anyone teaching media studies in a tertiary institution today, and it is becoming an increasingly common question. It is also a question that typifies what has been called the Net Generation, {{and at the same time}} raises important questions about the way we teach this generation, particularly when it comes to media education. No longer can we assume that students will actually take the time to read the required readings that we have so painstakingly put together, because it is simply not their way of approaching or engaging with information. The concept of scanning sums it up beautifully: they scan for information, rather than search for specific texts to be <b>engaged</b> <b>with</b> <b>in</b> <b>depth</b> [...] . In short, they develop scanning minds...|$|E
40|$|Prior {{beliefs and}} attitudes of {{students}} can {{have a significant impact}} on their learning experience but it is usually difficult to <b>engage</b> <b>with</b> student beliefs <b>in</b> <b>depth</b> when dealing <b>with</b> large classes. As part of an ALTC Associate Fellowship project, we have developed technologies and strategies for facilitating connections between staff and student beliefs through the embedding of student reflective writing in statistics courses. Students were free to write whatever they liked in their journals but weekly themes were also provided to give them a starting point if needed. The aim of this paper is to give an overview and analysis of entries around the themes that were particularly related to beliefs about statistics, as well as to demonstrate the use of text mining tools in this context...|$|R
40|$|Sensemaking {{frequently}} {{involves the}} use of representations ‘in the world’ embodied within representational artefacts. However, theories of sensemaking tend not to <b>engage</b> <b>with</b> this issue <b>in</b> <b>depth.</b> Such an understanding, we propose, is important for supporting artefact design. This article develops a perspective on distributed sensemaking by taking as the unit of analysis an assembly of people and/or artefacts, potentially distributed physically, socially and over time rather than the mind of an individual sensemaker. Through an observational study of military analysts we explore how a sensemaking task can be understood in terms of the distribution of task-relevant representations across internal and external representations. We conclude that <b>in</b> sensemaking, as <b>with</b> many cognitive activities, the design and interactional properties of external representational media has a profound effect on the properties of the combined distributed sensemaking system...|$|R
40|$|Making {{sense of}} {{technology}} products {{is a challenge}} faced by B 2 B actors, {{and one that is}} particularly acute for high technology products. Sitting in the isthmus between organisations are sellers and buyers who predominantly communicate through talking to position themselves as legitimate sources of knowledge to facilitate selling and buying, while often experiencing identity-based tensions. Research gaps from extant studies show limited investigations examining how sellers and buyers discursively negotiate high technology sales related to their identities to more easily make sense of these often-misunderstood products. This study therefore considers these aspects through the exemplar of nanotechnology, which is regarded as an ambiguous, opaque and complex collection of products, capable of triggering a need for sensemaking, based on the use of marketing-based spoken communication. Throughout this study, respondents who undertake nanotechnology selling and buying within UK companies (SMEs and MNEs) are <b>engaged</b> <b>with</b> via <b>in</b> <b>depth</b> semi-structured interviews. Using an interpretivist case study approach, discourse analysis is used to unpick social structures relating to selling and buying, as the respondents ‘see’ and discursively construct them. Three main themes are drawn out of this study. The first is the importance of a centralised scientist role identity to guard against the stigma of carrying out marketing activities, where respondents can be quasi-legitimised scientists <b>engaged</b> <b>with</b> selling and buying, while discursively negotiating how to construct these activities. Many sub-themes of power, othering and internal contradictions are explored for this and other main themes. The second theme highlights the potential for using spoken interpersonal marketing communications as a vehicle to induce homophilous discourse, resulting in shared meaning, where sense can be made more easily for complex product functionalities and identities legitimised/delegitimised. The third theme indicates how product simplification and linguistic tools, drawing on cultural references such as science fiction metaphors and militarism can aid in sense given and made between sellers and buyers. Drawing these themes together suggests how the scientist role identity is centrally enacted alongside minor identities of the marketer, seller or buyer to aid in sense giving and sensemaking for high technology products through spoken discursive cultural resources. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} contextualised {{within the field}} of post-graduate, {{continuing}} teacher education, and the vibrant and demanding policy context that has characterised higher education in post-apartheid South Africa. Situated within a module specifically designed to address what is commonly understood to be the academic literacy development needs of students in the Bachelor of Education Honours programme at the former University of Natal, it aims to unveil the lived experiences of students taking this module. The module, Reading and Writing Academic Texts (RWAT), was developed in direct response to academics’ call that something be done about the ‘problem’ of students’ reading and writing proficiency. As a core, compulsory module, RWAT was informed by Systemic Functional Linguistics and drew on Genre Theory for its conceptual and theoretical framework. It foregrounded the genre of the academic argument as the key academic literacy that was taught. The motivation for this study came from my own increasing concern that the theoretical and conceptual framework we had adopted for the module was emerging as an inherently limiting and formulaic model of literacy, and was resulting in students exiting the module with little or no ‘critical’ perspective on any aspect of literacy as social practice. I was also keen, in a climate of increasing de-personalisation and the massification of education, to reinstate the personal. Thus, I chose to focus on individual lives, and through an exploration {{of a small group of}} participants’ ‘lived’ experiences of the RWAT module, ascertain what it is like to acquire an academic literacy. The key research question is, therefore: What is it like to acquire an academic literacy? The secondary research question is: How is this experience influenced by the mode of delivery in which it occurs? For its conceptual and theoretical framing, this study draws on social literacy theory and phenomenology, the latter as both a philosophy and a methodology. However, although the study has drawn significantly on the phenomenological tradition for inspiration and direction, it has not done so uncritically. Thus, the study <b>engages</b> <b>with</b> phenomenology-as-philosophy <b>in</b> great <b>depth</b> before turning to phenomenology-as-methodology, in order to arrive at a point where the methods and procedures applied in it, are justified. The main findings of the study suggest that, despite the RWAT module espousing an ideological model (Street, 1984) of literacy in its learning materials and readings, participants came very much closer to experiencing an autonomous model of literacy (Street, 1984). The data shows that the RWAT module was largely inadequate to the task of inducting participants into the ‘situated practices’ and ‘situated meanings’ of the Discourse of Genre Theory and/or the academy, hence the many ‘lived’ difficulties participants experienced. The data also highlights the ease with which an autonomous model of literacy can come to govern practice and student experience even when curriculum intention is underpinned by an ideological position on literacy as social practice. Finally, the study suggests that the research community in South Africa, characterised as it is by such diversity, would be enriched by more studies derived from phenomenology, and a continuing engagement <b>with</b> phenomenology-as-a-movement <b>in</b> order to both challenge and expand its existing framework...|$|R
