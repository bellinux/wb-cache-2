5|$|Apart {{from the}} dignitaries {{who lived in}} Chadderton's manor houses, Chadderton's {{population}} during the Middle Ages comprised a small community of retainers, {{most of whom were}} occupied in farming, either <b>growing</b> <b>and</b> milling of grain and cereal or raising cattle, sheep, pigs and domestic fowl.

At its height, the brewery was exporting 1.8 million bottles a year to Australia, New Zealand, India, South Africa, South America and the West Indies. It closed in 1921. However the town, which is the home of Babycham, is still an important centre for cider production.|$|E
5|$|At the League's Fourth Conference in May 1888, {{factional}} divisions {{became increasingly}} apparent between Morris' anti-parliamentary socialists, the parliamentary socialists, and the anarchists; the Bloomsbury Branch were expelled for supporting parliamentary action. Under {{the leadership of}} Charles Mowbray, the League's anarchist wing were <b>growing</b> <b>and</b> called on the League to embrace violent action in trying to overthrow the capitalist system. By autumn 1889 the anarchists {{had taken over the}} League's executive committee and Morris was stripped of the editorship of Commonweal in favour of the anarchist Frank Kitz. This alienated Morris from the League, which had also become a financial burden for him; he had been subsidising its activities with £500 a year, a very large sum of money at the time. By the autumn of 1890, Morris left the Socialist League, with his Hammersmith branch seceding to become the independent Hammersmith Socialist Society in November 1890.|$|E

5|$|At {{the other}} extreme, {{in the more}} {{developed}} parts of the world, animals are often intensively managed; dairy cows may be kept in zero-grazing conditions with all their forage brought to them; beef cattle may be kept in high density feedlots; pigs may be housed in climate-controlled buildings and never go outdoors; poultry may be reared in barns and kept in cages as laying birds under lighting-controlled conditions. In between these two extremes are semi-intensive, often family run farms where livestock graze outside {{for much of the}} year, silage or hay is made to cover the times of year when the grass stops <b>growing,</b> <b>and</b> fertiliser, feed and other inputs are bought onto the farm from outside.|$|E
5|$|By 24–28days after hatching, {{the young}} birds start to perch on {{branches}} near the nest {{and take their}} first flight. They are fed by their parents for a further 28–30days, staying close to the nest while <b>growing</b> <b>and</b> practicing flying. At this stage they are extremely vocal, and their cries to their parents can often be heard a considerable distance away. The young hawks disperse after their parents stop provisioning them. Though they receive {{the same amount of}} food, male chicks (roughly half the size of females) mature more quickly and seem to be ready to leave the nest sooner. In a study in the Forest of Ae, south-west Scotland, it was found that 21% of nestlings over two days old died, with the causes of death being starvation, wet weather, predation and desertion by the parents. The parasite Leucocytozoon toddi can be passed from parent to nestling at the nest, possibly {{because of the number of}} birds sharing a small space, thus allowing transmission.|$|E

The stated goal was to curb the rapidly <b>growing</b> <b>and</b> {{extremely}} expensive naval construction programs. It was obvious to the General Board that the expensive new battlecruisers, which some thought were already obsolete, would be very attractive targets for cancellation. Accordingly, studies were done exploring the possibilities of converting {{one or more of}} the battlecruisers to different uses: one looked at a conversion to an aircraft carrier, while another contemplated a conversion to an Atlantic ocean liner.|$|E

5|$|FLCN {{creates a}} protein called folliculin that has two isoforms. It appears {{to act as}} a tumor {{suppressor}} and is expressed strongly in the skin, distal nephrons, and type I pneumocytes. It has also been found in the parotid gland, brain, breast, pancreas, prostate, and ovaries. Tumor suppressors normally prevent cells from <b>growing</b> <b>and</b> dividing too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way. Mutations in the FLCN gene may interfere with the ability of folliculin to restrain cell growth and division, leading to the formation of noncancerous and cancerous tumors. Recent studies suggest that folliculin accomplishes this function through its involvement with cellular metabolism, possibly through modulation of the mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) pathway and/or oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria. Folliculin interacts with FNIP1 and FNIP2 (FLCN-interacting protein) to form a complex with AMP-activated protein kinase. Folliculin's participation in the mTOR pathway may explain the similarity in phenotype between BHD syndrome, Cowden syndrome, tuberous sclerosis, and Peutz-Jeghers syndrome.|$|E
5|$|For some years, {{the cause}} of the disease was unknown, and {{hypotheses}} included tree ageing, fungi, viruses, and environmental factors such as an increase in ultra-violet light. Another hypothesis was that a genetic problem may have been induced in Northland and Auckland by the thousands of cabbage trees brought into the area from elsewhere and planted in gardens and parks. The Lands and Survey Department had a native plant nursery at Taupo in the central North Island, which was used to grow plants for use in parks, reserves and carparks. In many Northland parks, cabbage trees from the central North Island were <b>growing</b> <b>and</b> flowering within metres of natural forms. Any offspring produced might have been poorly adapted to local conditions. After nearly five years of work, scientists found the cause was a bacterium Phytoplasma australiense, which may be spread from tree to tree by a tiny sap-sucking insect, the introduced passion vine hopper.|$|E
5|$|Highland cattle {{were first}} {{imported}} into Australia by {{the mid-19th century}} by Scottish migrants such as Chieftain Areneas Ronaldson MacDonell of Glengarry, Scotland. Arriving in Port Albert, Victoria, in 1841 with his clan, they apparently drove their Highland cattle to a farm at Greenmount, on the Tarra River, preceded by a piper. Samuel Amess, also from Scotland, who made a fortune in the Victorian goldfields and became Mayor of Melbourne in 1869, kept a small fold of black Highland cattle on Churchill Island. They were seen and survived in Port Victoria during the late 1800s, but other folds were believed to have died out {{in areas such as}} New South Wales. In 1988 the Australian Highland Cattle Society was formed. Since then, numbers have been <b>growing</b> <b>and</b> semen is being exported to New Zealand to establish the breed there.|$|E
