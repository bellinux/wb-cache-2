50|$|A {{real estate}} {{investment}} trust (REIT) is a company that owns, and in most cases operates, income-producing real estate. REITs own many types of commercial real estate, ranging from office and apartment buildings to warehouses, hospitals, shopping centers, hotels and timberlands. Some REITs engage in financing real estate. The law providing for REITs was enacted by the U.S. Congress in 1960. The law was intended to provide a {{real estate investment}} structure similar to the structure mutual funds provide for <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> <b>stocks.</b> REITs are strong income vehicles because, to avoid incurring liability for U.S. Federal income tax, REITs generally must pay out an amount equal to at least 90 percent of their taxable income in the form of dividends to shareholders.|$|E

Shareholder receives rewards when the company performs well {{and the value of}} shares goes up. But if the company does poorly, the share price falls down and the value of investment will be reduced. Among other issues, the performance of shares market, economic environment, and political stability are all responsible for increase or decrease in the value of investments. Therefore, trading in shares market is regarded as investment in “risk capital”. Strength to sustain this risk with careful planning results in reward and shareholders can receive the prospective return on their investment as much higher than that on other investments.|$|E
5000|$|Equity {{risk premium}} {{is defined as}} [...] "excess return that an {{individual}} stock or the overall stock market provides over a risk-free rate." [...] This excess compensates investors for taking on the relatively higher risk of the equity market. The size of the premium can vary as the risk in the stock, or just the stock market in general, increases. For example, higher risks have a higher premium. The concept {{of this is to}} entice investors to take on riskier investments. A key component in this is the risk-free rate, which is quoted as [...] "the rate on longer-term government bonds." [...] These are considered risk free because there is a low chance that the government will default on its loans. However, the <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> <b>stocks</b> isn't guaranteed, because businesses often suffer downturns or go out of business.|$|E
5000|$|Under U.S. Federal {{income tax}} law, an REIT is [...] "any corporation, trust or {{association}} {{that acts as}} an investment agent specializing in real estate and real estate mortgages" [...] under Internal Revenue Code section 856. The rules for federal income taxation of REITs are found primarily in Part II (sections 856 through 859) of Subchapter M of Chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code. Because a REIT is entitled to deduct dividends paid to its owners (commonly referred to as shareholders), a REIT may avoid incurring {{all or part of}} its liabilities for U.S. federal income tax. To qualify as a REIT, an organization makes an [...] "election" [...] to do so by filing a Form 1120-REIT with the Internal Revenue Service, and by meeting certain other requirements. The purpose of this designation is to reduce or eliminate corporate tax, thus avoiding double taxation of owner income. In return, REITs are required to distribute at least 90% of their taxable income into the hands of investors. A REIT is a company that owns, and in most cases, operates income-producing real estate.

50|$|In {{his book}} Investieren statt Sparen Otte {{describes}} how private investors can achieve long-term wealth creation. It {{is in the}} interest of the investor to carry out his financial planning personally, and not have it performed by a third party. Investment is the most important component of long-term wealth creation, although personal responsibility, transparency and availability of reliable financial information as well as patience for the investment horizon are also essential. Sound investments also involve taking calculable risks. In addition, Otte describes the advantage internet offers for carrying out online bank transactions, automatically placing orders, as well as facilitating communication and exchange of information between investors. The effect of doubling private assets is based on the principle of compound interest and the possibility of earning an approx. average annual return of 8-10%, for example on the DAX. The financial objectives are determined by disposable net income, the return on investment, the investment period and the age of the investor. The investment amount is defined as savings minus consumption. The highest yields can be obtained from <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> <b>stocks.</b> The ownership of stocks makes the investor co-owner of a company, enabling him to benefit from the economic success of the company’s goods and services. Successful long-term investments by private investors have largely resulted from investment in strong brands and quality organizations such as Coca-Cola, McDonald's, Sony, Nestlé, Procter & Gamble, IBM, etc., which have been established on the market for a long period of time.The value of stocks is based on the present and future earnings of the organization. Otte divides stocks into several categories: ‘Meisteraktien’ (‘master stocks’: internationally renowned companies with global brands such as DaimlerChrysler, Coca-Cola, Siemens), ‘Kaufleuteaktien’ (‘trader stocks’: large corporations that are currently undervalued with a low price / earnings ratio; high earnings in spite of low market value), ‘Königsaktien’ (‘king stocks’: the world’s best mature large corporations and industry leaders that grow less quickly than revolutionary stocks), ‘Revolutionärsaktien’ (‘revolutionary stocks’: young growing companies with revolutionary, innovative ideas such as Google, Microsoft, Cisco Systems, etc.) and ‘Valueaktien’ (blue chips).|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis article {{analyzes}} {{the impact of}} the increase of an investment horizon on the comparative advantages of the basic asset classes and on the principles of constructing the investment strategy. It demonstrates that the traditional approach of portfolio management theory, which states that <b>investments</b> <b>in</b> <b>stocks</b> are preferable over bonds in terms of their long-run risk–return trade-offs, is by no means always consistent with empirical evidence. This article proves the opposite, i. e., that for long-term investors, <b>investments</b> <b>in</b> corporate bonds are more profitable in terms of the risk–return ratio than <b>investments</b> <b>in</b> <b>stocks,</b> arguing <b>in</b> favor of strategies pursued by pension funds and other institutional investors focused primarily on <b>investments</b> <b>in</b> fixed-income instruments, including infrastructural bonds. Emphasis is placed on the need for regular adjustments to long-term investors’ portfolios. As portfolios get older, those investors see a reduction in the returns’ dispersion, while differences in risk between various portfolios increase. This means that to maintain a fixed risk–return ratio for a portfolio as the horizon increases, an investor needs to increase the share of lower-risk financial assets during asset allocation process. This thesis becomes especially relevant in the context of retirement savings management...|$|R
