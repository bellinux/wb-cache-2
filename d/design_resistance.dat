40|$|Since {{the early}} 2000 s, within {{the fields of}} Design and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) an {{emerging}} body of unconventional design work has exemplified and articulated alternative and oppositional functions of design. Examples of such functions include provocatively speculating about alternative futures (speculation), questioning the status quo (critique), and debating political issues (agonism). Prominent examples of alternative and oppositional design have originated within HCI. Others have been heavily discussed, adapted, and critiqued within HCI. Alternative and oppositional designs have been presented under various names: critical design, design fiction, adversarial design, reflective design, ludic design, speculative design… At this moment the list continues to grow while examples of such work proliferate. This work collectively demonstrates the potential for design to engage concerns and goals that pivot around themes of generating radical alternatives and creating productive political, cultural, and social opposition. This thesis argues {{that there is a}} body of unconventional design work that becomes cohesive and legible when held together by themes of oppositionality and alternatives, and operating throughout these designs is a technique which I term <b>design</b> <b>resistance.</b> This thesis presents two primary contributions. The first contribution is to isolate and elaborate resistance as a design technique at work across a range of alternative and oppositional designs. I articulate how <b>design</b> <b>resistance</b> works by analyzing a series of design exemplars drawn from HCI and adjacent areas of Design. The second contribution is to extend and refine the overarching technique of <b>design</b> <b>resistance</b> through two design case studies. These design case studies serve the dual function of offering additional insight into <b>design</b> <b>resistance</b> grounded in my own design practice while concretely demonstrating new knowledge relevant to specific domains and concerns within HCI, including sustainable energy consumption and critiques of digital consumer technologies. Together these contributions provide new knowledge for (1) understanding the rise of alternative and oppositional designs, the concerns they are working to engage, and the research gaps they are working to fill, and (2) how to practice alternative and oppositional forms of design using techniques of <b>design</b> <b>resistance...</b>|$|E
30|$|The actual <b>design</b> {{short-term}} allowable <b>resistance</b> of {{the combined}} joints with main member thickness/bolt diameter ratio of 9 or 12 in Table  4 {{was determined by the}} criterion (2) and was smaller than that of the nailed joints. This contradiction comes from large standard deviation of the <b>design</b> short-term allowable <b>resistance</b> determined by the criterion (2). The criterion (2) gives the <b>design</b> short-term allowable <b>resistance</b> of combined joints in wide variation because of its natural dependency on random initial slips of bolted joints. Particularly if the initial slips vary crossing over the allowable slip, the lower limit evaluation calculated from all data including some specimens with smaller initial slips that give higher loads at the same allowable slip may result in lower <b>design</b> allowable <b>resistance.</b> It is because the existence of higher loads increases the standard deviation for the same minimum load and higher average load than the evaluation from the data excluding the higher values, which sometimes results in unreasonably low <b>design</b> allowable <b>resistance.</b> In these cases, the <b>design</b> allowable <b>resistance</b> {{of the combined}} joints should be determined to be equivalent to that of the nailed joints for the serviceability limit design.|$|R

40|$|Enlargement of {{original}} cross-sections or replacement of defective concrete layers with new concrete are usual situations in strengthening operations of reinforced concrete structures. In these situations, the shear strength between concrete cast {{at different times}} is crucial for the monolithic behavior of the strengthened members. Most design standards for concrete structures present design procedure for estimating the shear resistance between concrete layers based on the shear friction theory. The study includes three-dimensional and two-dimensional finite element model (FEM) analysis for calculation of shear stresses and comparison of three different code approaches, i. e. BS 8110, ACI 318 and EN 1992, for determination of <b>design</b> shear <b>resistance</b> at an interface between concrete cast at different ages of a pile cap supported on precast concrete piles. Based {{on the results of}} the analysis carried out, it can be stated that complicated three dimensional finite element model analysis is not always essential for analysis of structures, which are having complex geometrical shapes. It is possible to transform three-dimensional problems to a simplified two-dimensional problem based on the level of accuracy required. For the selected surface characteristics and r/f percentage, the estimated <b>design</b> shear <b>resistance</b> based on recommendations of EN- 1992 - 1 - 1 - 2004 was found be lower than the corresponding estimated value based on ACI 318 M- 11 recommendations.
