25|$|For typical {{computer}} displays, three-dimensional is a misnomer—their displays are two-dimensional. Semantically, however, most graphical {{user interfaces}} use three dimensions. With height and width, they offer a third dimension of layering or stacking screen elements over one another. This may be represented visually on screen through an illusionary transparent effect, which offers the advantage that information in background windows may still be read, if not interacted with. Or the environment may simply hide the background information, possibly making the distinction apparent by drawing a <b>drop</b> <b>shadow</b> effect over it.|$|E

50|$|In graphic design, a <b>drop</b> <b>shadow</b> is {{a visual}} effect {{consisting}} of a drawing element which looks like the shadow of an object, giving {{the impression that the}} object is raised above the objects behind it. The <b>drop</b> <b>shadow</b> is often used for elements of a graphical user interface such as windows or menus, and for simple text. The text label for icons on desktops in many desktop environments has a <b>drop</b> <b>shadow,</b> as this effect effectively distinguishes the text from any colored background it may be in front of.|$|E
