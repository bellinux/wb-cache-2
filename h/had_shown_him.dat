Fiacco {{was surprised to find}} there were no scores written for the musicians to play; he then wrote a part based on riffs Francis <b>had</b> <b>shown</b> <b>him.</b> The violinists, Corinne Metter and Karen Karlsrud, also followed the directions of Francis and Norton. Another cellist, Ann Rorich, credited on the album and single, was sent home; according to Fiacco he doubled her parts.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{importance}} of his title, Thơ rarely appeared with Diệm in public and was a figurehead with little influence. The real power lay with Diệm's younger brothers, Nhu and Cẩn, who commanded private armies and secret police, as well as giving orders directly to ARVN generals. Nhu reportedly once ordered a bodyguard to slap Thơ because he felt Thơ <b>had</b> <b>shown</b> <b>him</b> a lack of respect. Diệm held Thơ in contempt and did not allow him {{to take part in}} major policy decisions, despite theoretically being the second most powerful man in the country. Thơ had a rapport with the military officers, having befriended Minh years earlier. He was regarded as a genial and affable administrator with a reputation for making compromises.|$|E
5|$|The first {{non-indigenous}} settler at Wolf Point {{may have}} been a trader named Guarie. Writing in 1880 Gurdon Hubbard, who first arrived in Chicago on October 1, 1818, stated that he had been told of Guarie by Antoine De Champs and Antoine Beson, who had been traversing the Chicago Portage annually since about 1778. Hubbard wrote that De Champs <b>had</b> <b>shown</b> <b>him</b> evidence of a trading house and the remains of a cornfield supposed to have belonged to Guarie. The cornfield was located on {{the west bank of the}} North Branch of the Chicago River, a short distance from the forks at what is now Fulton Street; early settlers named the North Branch of the Chicago River the Guarie River, or Gary's River.|$|E

25|$|In February 2010, an Arab country's unnamed {{ambassador}} to Dubai had his marriage annulled after discovering that his bride was cross-eyed and had facial hair. The woman had worn a niqab on the occasions {{that the couple}} had met prior to the wedding. The ambassador informed the Sharia court {{that he had been}} deliberately deceived by the bride's mother, who <b>had</b> <b>shown</b> <b>him</b> photographs of the bride's sister. He only discovered this when he lifted the niqab to kiss his bride. The court annulled the marriage, but refused a claim for compensation.|$|E
25|$|Akaitcho {{explained}} why Fort Enterprise {{had not been}} stocked with food as promised. Part of the reason was that three of his hunters had been killed when they fell through the ice on a frozen lake, and {{he had not been}} supplied with ammunition at Fort Providence, but he admitted the main reason the fort had been abandoned; he had believed that the white men's expedition was the height of folly, and that they would not return to Fort Enterprise alive. In spite of this, Franklin refused to blame Akaitcho, who <b>had</b> <b>shown</b> <b>him</b> much kindness during the rescue, and, because of the ongoing dispute between the fur companies, had not received the payment he had been promised.|$|E
25|$|German Orientalist, mathematician, inventor, poet, and {{librarian}} Daniel Schwenter {{wrote in}} his 1636 book Deliciae Physico-Mathematicae about an instrument that a man from Pappenheim <b>had</b> <b>shown</b> <b>him,</b> which enabled movement of a lens to project more from a scene through the camera obscura. It consisted of a ball {{as big as a}} fist, through which a hole (AB) was made with a lens attached on one side (B). This ball was placed inside two halves of part of a hollow ball that were then glued together (CD), in which it could be turned around. This device was attached to a wall of the camera obscura (EF). This universal joint mechanism was later called a scioptric ball.|$|E

25|$|In his affidavit, Weir recounted when in March 1976 he {{had gone}} to the farm where between eight and ten men dressed in {{camouflage}} had been parading in the farmyard. Inside he had discussed with Mitchell and others the details of a planned bombing and shooting attack against a nationalist pub, Tully's in Belleeks. Mitchell <b>had</b> <b>shown</b> <b>him</b> the floor plans of the pub's interior which he had drawn up highlighting the lack of escape routes for the pub's patrons. The plan was temporarily called off when it was discovered that the British Army's Parachute Regiment was on patrol that evening in the area. Weir returned to Belfast the next day and the attack went ahead that evening, 8 March. There were no casualties, however, as Mitchell's floor plans had been inaccurate, and the customers had fled into the pub's living quarters for safety once the shooting had commenced outside, and the bomb only caused structural damage to the building.|$|E
25|$|On June 18, 1977, in the New York Yankees' 10–4 {{loss to the}} Boston Red Sox in {{a nationally}} {{televised}} game at Fenway Park in Boston, Jim Rice, a powerful hitter but a slow runner, hit a ball into right field that Reggie Jackson seemed to get to without much speed, and Rice reached second base. Furious, Yankees manager Billy Martin removed Jackson from the game without even waiting {{for the end of}} the inning, sending Paul Blair out to replace him. When Jackson arrived at the dugout, Martin yelled that Jackson <b>had</b> <b>shown</b> <b>him</b> up. The two men argued, and Jackson said that Martin's heavy drinking had impaired his judgment. Despite Jackson being eighteen years younger, about two inches taller and maybe 40 pounds heavier, Martin lunged at him, and had to be restrained by coaches Yogi Berra and Elston Howard. Red Sox fans could see this in the dugout and began cheering wildly; NBC television cameras showed the confrontation to the entire country.|$|E
25|$|Mother Katharine Drexel, {{who founded}} the American order of Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament for Indians and Colored People, corresponded with Pius XI, as she had with his papal predecessors. (In 1887, Pope Leo XIII had {{encouraged}} Katharine Drexel—then a young Philadelphia socialite— to do missionary work with America's disadvantaged people of color). In the early 1930s, Mother Drexel wrote Pius XI asking him to bless a publicity campaign to acquaint white Catholics {{with the needs of}} these disadvantaged races among them. An emissary <b>had</b> <b>shown</b> <b>him</b> photos of Xavier University, New Orleans, LA, which Mother Drexel had established to educate African-Americans at the highest level in the USA. Pius XI replied promptly, sending his blessing and encouragement. Upon his return, the emissary told Mother Katharine that the Pope said he had read the novel Uncle Tom's Cabin as a boy, and it had ignited his lifelong concern for the American Negro.|$|E

25|$|Experience in South Africa <b>had</b> <b>shown</b> <b>him</b> that {{underlying}} {{the difficulties of}} the situation there was the wider problem of imperial unity. In his farewell speech at Johannesburg he concluded with {{a reference to the}} subject. 'When we who call ourselves Imperialists talk of the British Empire, we think of a group of states bound, not in an alliance or alliances that can be made and unmade but in a permanent organic union. Of such a union the dominions of the sovereign as they exist to-day are only the raw material.' This thesis he further developed in a magazine article written in view of the colonial conference held in London in 1907. He advocated the creation of a permanent deliberative imperial council, and favored preferential trade relations between the United Kingdom and {{the other members of the}} empire; and in later years he took an active part in advocating the cause of tariff reform and Imperial Preference.|$|E
25|$|On June 18, in a 10–4 {{loss to the}} Boston Red Sox in {{a nationally}} {{televised}} game at Fenway Park in Boston, Jim Rice, a powerful hitter but notoriously slow runner, hit a ball into shallow right field that Jackson appeared to weakly attempt to field. Jackson failed to reach the ball which fell far in front of him, thereby allowing Rice to reach second base. Furious, Martin removed Jackson from the game without even waiting {{for the end of}} the inning, sending Paul Blair out to replace him.

25|$|Patrik Jensen and Jonas Björler had a {{discussion}} at Jonas' own 40th birthday party, as to not letting The Haunted disband, and when Jensen asked Björler {{as to who}} should be the new vocalist in the band, Björler could only think of former member, Marco Aro. A few days after, Jensen phoned Aro to rejoin The Haunted. Aro had missed being in the band and tempted to rejoin but at first was hesitant due hectic touring he had done with the band in the past, which Aro {{was not interested in}} doing, but The Haunted had done it for almost a decade straight after Aro left, getting all the touring out of them. More hesitation came when Aro struggled with drug addiction back then and with him {{to be back in the}} band again, he didn't want it to reoccur as it had also given him problems within his family, who he needed to discuss rejoining the band with also. Aro is also in the band The Resistance and didn't want to have conflicting schedules with both bands, so he had to have {{a discussion}} with The Resistance as well. Aro had told Jensen he'd give him a response two weeks later. By then, the band <b>had</b> <b>shown</b> <b>him</b> the a breakdown of future tours, which interested Aro to rejoin The Haunted. Before publicly revealing information of the band's new lineup, Aro only stated there was good news coming from the band. His picture was in a silhouette on the band's official Facebook the day before the band announced a new line-up. Adrian Erlandsson, a former member, returned to the band also and Ola Englund from Six Feet Under was brought in as the band's new lead guitarist. The band then began writing for an EP titled Eye of the Storm which was released on 20 January 2014 in Europe and 21 January 2014 in North America. The band had also been rehearsing before the announcement of the new lineup to perform for the first time live with this lineup at the 70000 Tons of Metal which sat sail 27–31 January 2014.|$|E

500|$|In June 1979 Stiefel asked {{a former}} Nazi Party archivist, August Priesack, {{to verify the}} {{authenticity}} of the diary, which he subsequently did. Priesack showed the diary to Eberhard Jäckel of the University of Stuttgart, who also thought the diary to be genuine, and wanted to edit it for publication. News of the diary's existence soon began to filter through to collectors of Hitler memorabilia. At the end of 1979 Tiefenthaeler contacted Heidemann to say that Stiefel <b>had</b> <b>shown</b> <b>him</b> around his collection, which included a Hitler diary—the only one Kujau had forged to that point. According to Hamilton [...] "the discovery inflamed Heidemann almost to madness", and he aggressively pressed for what would be a journalistic scoop.|$|E

In light of this evidence, few still maintained the credibility of the reports in the Kentucky Gazette by the time of the election. Every Kentucky elector voted for both Jefferson and Clinton.|$|E
500|$|Armstrong {{prepared}} {{his famous}} epigram on his own. In a post-flight press conference, {{he said that}} he decided on the words [...] "just prior to leaving the LM [...]" [...] In a 1983 interview in Esquire Magazine, Armstrong explained to George Plimpton: [...] "I always knew there was a good chance of being able to return to Earth, but I thought the chances of a successful touchdown on the moon surface were about even money—fifty–fifty... Most people don't realize how difficult the mission was. So it didn't seem to me there was much point in thinking of something to say if we'd have to abort landing." [...] In 2012, brother Dean Armstrong claimed that Neil <b>had</b> <b>shown</b> <b>him</b> a note with a draft of the line months before the launch, although historian Andrew Chaikin, who had interviewed the astronaut in 1988 for his book A Man on the Moon, disputed that he had ever claimed coming up with the line spontaneously during the mission.|$|E

Depp was already familiar with some of Wood's films through John Waters, who <b>had</b> <b>shown</b> <b>him</b> Plan 9 from Outer Space and Glen or Glenda. To get a handle on how to portray Wood, Depp studied the performance of Jack Haley as the Tin Man in The Wizard of Oz, and the acting of Mickey Rooney, Ronald Reagan and Casey Kasem. He watched several Reagan speeches because the actor felt that [...] "he had a kind of blind optimism that was perfect for Ed Wood." [...] Depp also borrowed some of Kasem's cadence and [...] "that utterly confident, breezy salesman quality in his voice".|$|E
