6000|$|... “Certainly I <b>do.</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> well by sight, {{and believe}} {{that you are a}} good young fellow. I have always heard you well spoken of. What makes them think that?” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Suppose I {{should take}} this case, and {{spend an hour}} or two on it, how <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> would come here each morning to black my boots, as you propose?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'How <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> who <b>you</b> are?' {{she asked}} him, carelessly. 'How <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> what <b>you</b> want to <b>know</b> my story for? Perhaps you're {{only trying to}} get {{something}} out of me.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No {{news of the}} truant?" [...] asked Gaston. [...] "Who but {{you would}} have thought of going after him? Well <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> would never prosper without me at your elbow." ...|$|R
5000|$|How <b>Do</b> <b>I</b> <b>Know</b> How <b>You</b> <b>Know?,</b> Seattle Art Museum, Seattle, WA, June 3-October 31 ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{know you}} <b>do.</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> don't want {{physical}} things by themselves. But, I {{want you to}} give me--to give your spirit to me--that golden light which is you--which you don't know--give it me--' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No, no, Mr Noggs,' replied Gride, arresting his hand, 'A lady. You wonder {{to hear me}} say A lady. I {{know you}} <b>do,</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> do. Here's little Madeline. That's the toast. Mr Noggs. Little Madeline!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You don't see it yet," [...] {{said the}} Doctor. [...] "But you <b>do.</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> do. And she shall stay. The house shall be hers, as her residence, {{for the next}} six months. As for money----" ...|$|E
60|$|LORD LOAM (stung {{somehow to}} the quick). Oh, <b>did</b> <b>you?</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>you</b> at once, Ernest; <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>you</b> {{by the way}} you ran.|$|R
6000|$|... "How <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> that <b>you</b> would <b>do</b> all this? Your views may change--and then--we should be--my {{mother would}} be--homeless again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I mean it as {{honestly}} as <b>you</b> <b>do.</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>you</b> would go: <b>I</b> saw {{you getting}} ready, and I {{made up my}} mind to follow. I, too, have prepared for it, and even spoken to Mrs. Amory. She has gone as matron of a hospital, and promised to find a place for me when I was ready. The day you enlist I shall write and tell her I am ready." ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{looked at}} them critically. [...] "How do I know they're good?" [...] he asked. [...] "You're a {{stranger}} to me, young feller, and how <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> ain't tryin' to beat me?" [...] He looked sternly at Lemuel, but here the mate interposed.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are right}} as to general principles," [...] Sir Charles replied, quite affectionately. [...] "Most sound and sensible. But how <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> haven't bargained {{already in the}} same way with your father? You may have settled with him, and be trying to diddle me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps you were," [...] he admitted, [...] "for {{the man in}} {{the picture}} was about your style of make-up. But how can you prove it was not a put-up job with the Corona people? How <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> are not all in the employ of the Corona people?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'There, {{that will}} <b>do.</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>you</b> {{would be good}} at last,' said Percy, patting her shoulder, while Theodora {{signified}} her pardon, and they turned homewards, but had made only a few steps before the gallop of clumsy shoes followed, and there stood Ellen, awkwardly presenting a bunch of the willow herb. Theodora gave well-pleased thanks, and told her she should take them as a sign she was really sorry and meant to do better.|$|R
6000|$|... "Have {{you read}} it, Mr. Boldwood?" [...] said Gabriel; [...] "if not, {{you had better}} <b>do</b> so. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> are {{interested}} in Fanny Robin." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Martin Rattler, <b>you</b> <b>did</b> that! <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> did,--I see {{the marks}} on your fingers. Come here, sir! Now tell me; {{did you do}} it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "One {{time you}} buy, Jake, {{and other times}} I come to Dorfield {{somebody}} else buys. How <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> don't get a run on suspenders some time? And if I don't visit all my customers, whether they buy or not, they think I neglect 'em. Who's this, Jake? Your daughter?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I am {{very well}} waited on, Jacob, {{and if you}} were to try to wait on me at table while the vessel is rolling, you would be pretty sure to spill a plate of soup down my neck, or {{something}} of that sort. You amuse yourself in your own way, and don't worry about me; when there is anything to <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> will do it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes--keep her--adopt her," [...] said Una eagerly, gaining courage {{now that}} the ice was broken. [...] "Oh, Mrs. Elliott, PLEASE do. She doesn't {{want to go back}} to the asylum--she cries every night about it. She's so afraid of being sent to another hard place. And she's SO smart--there isn't {{anything}} she can't <b>do.</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> wouldn't be sorry if you took her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not I, assuredly. I {{have had}} no {{communication}} whatever with the commissioners, nor <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> that <b>you</b> were one of those we encountered there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Andrew," [...] I said to him, [...] "I {{have got}} a piece of rather {{particular}} business <b>I</b> want <b>done,</b> and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> will manage it for me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Brother," [...] said William, [...] "how <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> what <b>you</b> {{may have}} done in the secret {{chambers}} of your heart, to give Satan an advantage over you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Silver {{suddenly}} sprang up, {{and supporting}} {{himself with a}} hand against the wall: [...] "Now I give you warning, George," [...] he cried. [...] "One more word of your sauce, and I'll call you down and fight you. How? Why, how <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>know?</b> <b>You</b> had ought to tell me that--you and the rest, that lost me my schooner, with your interference, burn you! But not you, you can't; you hain't got the invention of a cockroach. But civil you can speak, and shall, George Merry, you may lay to that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah! well do I know you," [...] muttered Wilder, as {{the first}} puff of this unwelcome wind struck his sails, and forced the little boat to bend to its power in passing; [...] "well <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you,</b> with your fresh-water flavour and your smell of the land! Would to God you had blown your fill upon the lakes, without coming down to drive many a weary seaman back upon his wake, and to eke out a voyage, already too long, by your bitter colds and steady obstinacy!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Man of my dreams," [...] she murmured, [...] "whence come you? Who are you? Why did the Hesea bid {{me to meet}} you?" [...] Then some {{sentences}} I {{could not}} catch. [...] "You sleep; in sleep the eyes are opened. Answer, I bid you; say what is the bond between you and me? Why have I dreamt of you? Why <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you?</b> Why----?" [...] and the sweet, rich voice died slowly from a whisper into silence, {{as though she were}} ashamed to utter what was on her tongue.|$|E
6000|$|... "I see it, I deduce it. How <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> that <b>you</b> {{have been}} getting {{yourself}} very wet lately, {{and that you have}} a most clumsy and careless servant girl?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... [SHE.] Gentle sir, {{although}} {{to marry}} I design - (Hey, but he's hopeful, willow, willow waly!) As yet <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not <b>know</b> <b>you,</b> and so <b>I</b> must decline. Hey, willow waly O! To other maidens go you - As yet <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not <b>know</b> <b>you,</b> Hey, willow waly O! ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Doubt not my faith, sir,' said Eustacie, proudly; 'I {{have been}} as true to him as if <b>I</b> had <b>known</b> he lived. Nor <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> who <b>you</b> are to {{question}} me.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Can I value your friend? You must {{name the}} reward yourself. But even then I can promise nothing. In {{the course of}} our duty every effort is now being made to find the missing American. But we work in the dark, as you know. Your friend may be a suicide; he may have lost his mind and wandered into the wilderness; he may have {{committed}} some crime and absconded. How <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>know?</b> <b>You</b> say he is missing, but that is no reason the brigands have him, even did brigands exist, which I doubt. Rest assured, signore, that rigid search will be made. It is my boast that I leave no duty unfulfilled." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Harry Clavering," [...] she had written, [...] "I know I {{am doing}} what {{men and women}} say no woman should do. You may, perhaps, say so of me now; but if you <b>do,</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> so well, that I do not fear that others {{will be able to}} repeat it. Harry, I have never loved any one but you. Will you be my husband? You well know that I should not make you this offer if I did not intend that {{everything}} I have should be yours. It will be pleasant to me to feel that I can make some reparation for the evil I have done. As for love, I have never loved any one but you. You yourself must know that well. Yours, altogether, if you will have it so--JULIA." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There are no {{chips on}} the table," [...] Sitka Charley explained. [...] "The men are playing with markers. That means {{the roof is}} the limit. One man play yellow markers--maybe one yellow marker worth one {{thousand}} dollars, maybe two thousand dollars. One man play red markers. Maybe they are worth five hundred dollars, maybe one thousand dollars. It {{is a very big}} game. Everybody play very high, up to the roof. How <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>know?</b> <b>You</b> make the dealer with blood little bit warm in face." [...] (I was delighted.) [...] "The lookout, you make him lean forward in his chair. Why he lean forward? Why his face very much quiet? Why his eyes very much bright? Why dealer warm with blood {{a little bit in the}} face? Why all men very quiet?--the man with yellow markers? the man with white markers? the man with red markers? Why nobody talk? Because very much money. Because last turn." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And how <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> that <b>you</b> are not amusing {{yourself}} by spinning out a blamed fairy tale?" [...] interrupted Ricardo roughly. [...] "I wonder at myself {{listening to the}} silly rot!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{you don't}} love boats like <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> think I'm making {{a fool of}} myself. But some day I'm going to sail the Martha again. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> it. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'My room. Thank you; no, not to-night. I've {{got nothing}} with me. What {{are you going}} to <b>do</b> to-morrow? <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> are to be at Charteris's to luncheon; his Jewess told me so.' ...|$|R
