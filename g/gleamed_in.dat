25|$|In 1936 a {{fragment}} of a similar Temple warning inscription was found. After 1967, archaeologists found that the wall extended {{all the way around}} the Temple Mount and is part of the city wall near the Lions' Gate. Thus, the Western Wall is not the only remaining part of the Temple Mount. Currently, Robinson's Arch (named after American Edward Robinson) remains as the beginning of an arch that spanned the gap between the top of the platform and the higher ground farther away. This had been used by the priests as an entrance. Commoners had entered through the still-extant, but now plugged, gates on the southern side which led through colonnades to the top of the platform. One of these colonnades is still extant and reachable through the Temple Mount. The Southern wall was designed as a grand entrance. Recent archeological digs have found thousands of mikvehs (ceremonial bathtubs) for the ritual purification of the worshipers, as well as a grand stairway leading to the now blocked entrance. Inside the walls, the platform was supported by a series of vaulted archways, now called Solomon's Stables, which still exist and whose current renovation by the Waqf is extremely controversial. The temple itself was constructed of imported white marble that <b>gleamed</b> <b>in</b> the daylight.|$|E
2500|$|She {{developed}} a reputation for fearlessness in facing down attempts to disrupt her meetings, but opposition became overwhelming {{on the eve of}} the Civil War. Mob action shut down her meetings in every town from Buffalo to Albany in early 1861. In Rochester, the police had to escort Anthony and other speakers from the building for their own safety. In Syracuse, according to a local newspaper, [...] "Rotten eggs were thrown, benches broken, and knives and pistols <b>gleamed</b> <b>in</b> every direction." ...|$|E
2500|$|Two {{years after}} the tragic deaths of Túrin and Nienor and the slaying of Glaurung, Morwen reappeared in Brethil at the grave of Túrin and Nienor at Cabed Naeramarth. There she was found by {{recently}} released Húrin; [...] "Grey she was, sharp-nosed with broken teeth, ... though [...] were wild now and full of fear, a light still <b>gleamed</b> <b>in</b> them hard to endure: the elven-light that long ago had earned her name, Edhelwen, proudest of mortal women {{in the days of}} old". Húrin would not reveal her children's , and Morwen died with the following sunrise, spent by wandering and waiting. She had remained by the grave {{for a long time and}} was not found by the Folk of Haleth as they ventured not to the death place of Glaurung, but it was the apparent death of Morwen through neglect that set Húrin against the people of Brethil, and which led to their destruction in the civil war.|$|E
