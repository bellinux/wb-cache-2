40|$|Purpose-The paper aims {{to provide}} a {{structured}} framework for comparing different productivity estimation methodologies and evaluate their sensitivity to operational coefficients variation for excavation operations. Design/methodology/approach-Two process-oriented methodologies were analysed in a deterministic fashion {{in terms of their}} input requirements and their respective outputs. A phase-oriented framework was presented to enable their comparison. The research methodology allows the estimation of excavation productivity in relation to the selected operational coefficients. Findings-The system productivity is significantly influenced by operational conditions, such as the <b>digging</b> <b>depth</b> and the swing angle from the excavation front to the dumping position. Each methodology presents a differing sensitivity to every operational factor. Since the excavator is considered as the system's leading resource, the variation on productivity has direct implications for the truck fleet size and the unit cost of operations. Originality/value-The proposed approach is useful in analyzing process-oriented productivity estimation methodologies under a given set of operational coefficients when no historical data is available. Thus, it provides an alternative to intuitive estimates based solely on personal judgment. The concept of ""baseline reference"" conditions is introduced, so as to enable the transformation of any operational scenario into equivalent mathematical models that allow comparisons between different estimation methodologies and computational approaches. © 2010 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Predicting the energy consumption and CO 2 emissions of excavators is therefore critical in order to mitigate the environmental impact of earthwork operations. However, there is a lack of method for estimating such energy consumption and CO 2 emissions, especially during the early planning stages of these activities. This research proposes a model using an artificial neural network (ANN) to predict an excavator’s hourly energy consumption and CO 2 emissions under different site conditions. The proposed ANN model includes five input parameters: <b>digging</b> <b>depth,</b> cycle time, bucket payload, engine horsepower, and load factor.

The results showed that the proposed ANN models can provide an accurate estimating tool for the early planning stage to predict the energy consumption and CO 2 emissions of excavators. Analyses have revealed that, within all the input parameters, cycle time has the greatest impact on energy consumption and CO 2 emissions.

40|$|Shaft sinking is an {{important}} part of the mining process, of which “mucking” (clearing the broken rock from the bottom of the shaft) plays a critical role. The aim of the research was to develop a scaled experimental replica of the so-called Clamshell Mucker and compare its performance, over a range of operating parameters, with those yielded by numerical simulations, for the long-term purpose of validating the simulation as a tool for optimizing the design of full-scale machines. Towards this end a scaled experimental rig of the clamshell mucker was developed and tested over an appropriate range of geometrical and operating parameters, for two different materials: hard plastic balls and thereafter 13 mm decomposed granite stone. Hydraulic actuator forces were established by measuring line pressures, while angular rotation of the jaws of the mucker was monitored using an angular potentiometer. Simple analysis provided a relationship between actuator force and torque on the buckets. The stone in the muck reservoir was agitated after each test run, to ensure random particle arrangements with no structuring, and a constant <b>digging</b> <b>depth.</b> Testing of the hard plastic balls was used to establish a qualitative comparison between Discrete Element Modelling (DEM) and physical testing, using both video and still photography comparisons, corresponding to the teeth initially touching the surface with a bucket closing velocity of 20 deg/s. Heuristic correlations obtained by this means were generally favourable. Quantitative testing using 13 mm granite stone yielded the bucket closing torque variation with bucket angle for various combinations of:- (a) bucket closing velocity, (b) initial distance of the bucket from the muck pile, (c) proximity of the bucket to the side and front walls of the container, and (d) the angle at which bucket assembly enters the muck pile. The main set of tests took place with the bucket entering vertically and positioned in the middle of the bed. Three different initial distances from the surface to the starting position of the bucket teeth were investigated (20 mm, 10 mm and 0 mm), with bucket angular velocities of 10 deg/s, 15 deg/s and 20 deg/s. Thereafter, testing was conducted at the forward (polycarbonate) boundary of the container and one of the lateral boundaries (steel) respectively, each for a single bucket velocity of 20 deg/s and covering the three above-mentioned initial distances from the surface. This testing was performed in an attempt to simulate the proximity effects that would be encountered in practice - for example, digging close to a side wall. Finally, torque variations with bucket angle were established at four different angles of attack (0 ±, 5 ±, 15 ± and 30 ±), at a constant bucket closing velocity of 20 deg/s, with the closest portion of the bucket initially touching the surface. Data was generally interpreted in the context of the fact the torque required to rotate the buckets appears to depend on an interplay between:- (a) the level of fluidization between particles in the bed, increasing with bucket closing velocity, results in a reduced torque; (b) particulate congestion, increasing as the initial distance from the surface of the granular material decreases, results in an increased torque; and (c) the momentum required to move the particles and change their direction, increasing with bucket velocity, results in an increased torque. Accordingly, for the larger initial distances from the surface momentum effects are dominant, generally leading to an increase of torque with angular velocity. However, as the initial distance reduces, congestion becomes increasingly important, until for the zero initial separation case, the lowest angular velocity yields the highest torques, probably because fluidization has been inhibited. Because particle to boundary interactions have lower friction than particle to particle interactions, torques in the presence of boundaries were lower than for the middle position in the initial stages. Beyond a certain point, proximity to the forward boundary led to congestion with a commensurate increase in torque above that of the middle case, whereas proximity to the lateral boundary led to no congestion, so the torques remained generally lower than for the middle case. When considering the effects of angle of penetration, it was found that the largest angle of penetration (30 ±) gave the highest torque in the initial stages, probably because the highest volumes of material are captured relative to other angles of attack. Beyond a bucket angle of about 14 ± congestion becomes increasingly dominant, with the rise in torque due to this effect generally delayed with increasing angles of attack. This phenomenon was ascribed to the fact that in all cases other than zero angle of penetration, only one jaw initially enters the material, with the second following at a later stage: therefore particles escape to a free surface for the mid-range bucket angles, with the onset of congestion commensurately delayed to the larger ones. Comparisons between DEM data and measurements for various testing parameters showed that the simulated and physical results display similar values of torque towards the beginning and end of the digging motion, but DEM predictions are low in the middle of the range. This is thought to arise primarily from the fact that simplified particle geometries (smooth, with no sharp edges) were incorporated into the DEM model because of computational resource limitations, whereas the real granular particles have sharp edges and are blocky, thus increasing particle interlocking effects and the high level of congestion frequently exhibited in the physical experimentation. This effect was generally reflected by poor comparisons between DEM data and experimentation in the context of torque variations with velocity in the middle range of angular positions. Because the coefficients of rolling friction and restitution were obtained from published data, additional simplified simulations were run to determine the sensitivity of these parameters (in addition to static friction coefficient, for comparative purposes) on the force characteristics of the model. It was established that specifically chosen percentage changes in all of the parameter values relative to the base system led to percentages of force deviation that were at least 3 to 5 times smaller, reinforcing the inference that particle interlocking effects were the dominant reason for poor mid-range correlations between experimentation and the DEM modelling. The maximum energy to fill the buckets was required at a zero angle of penetration, diminishing significantly to an angle of about 15 ± and then increasing once again. This trend is attributed to the fact that the 0 ± case is most affected by congestion, whereas the larger angles of attack (beyond about 20 ±) cause the weight of the material to significantly affect the energy required to close the buckets. While it was considered possible that similar trends would be observed in practice, that could potentially reflect in improved operational guidelines for the mucking process, further analysis suggested that an energy saving of less than 814. 3 kJ might be attainable for clearing a 6 m diameter shaft during a single cycle. While this appears to be inconsequential in the broader context, it should be subjected to a more comprehensive investigation in the context of full-scale cleaning strategies. It is recommended that:- (a) the test facility be modified to extend the range of bucket angular velocities; (b) testing be conducted with a broader range of particle sizes; (c) research into the interlocking and frictional effects of rock be pursued, to create representative particulate shapes as input to the DEM model; (d) higher friction coefficients be attempted as a means of artificially compensating for interlocking effects that are impractical to achieve because of computer resource limitations; and (e) testing be conducted with a range of different bucket shapes and sizes for the purpose of optimizing the design by way of minimizing structural stresses and the specific energies required to collect individual loads...|$|E

Pushing through static soil has a theoretical energy-depth power law of n = 2, which means that Ensis-inspired digging motions can provide exponential energetic savings over existing burrowing methods.

50|$|Two main {{methods of}} {{burrowing}} are employed. A vigorous fanning {{action of the}} pleopods causes particles of sediment to become suspended and the current produced pushes the plume backwards past the telson. Using this method, an animal can create a depression as large as itself within two minutes. It then turns round and use its maxillipeds to form a basket with which it carries lumps of sediment away from the excavation. This is a slower process but sustainable for a longer period. Further burrowing creates the typical tunnel {{with one or more}} openings, and this is frequently remodelled, often {{in the course of a}} few hours. Squilla empusa can <b>dig</b> to a <b>depth</b> of 20 cm in less than an hour. When the animal is inside the burrow it sometimes uses its maxillipeds to create a current of water flowing through. This species is territorial and will defend its burrow from other mantis shrimps.|$|R
5000|$|In 1938 Marie Bauer, a {{follower}} {{and the future}} wife of prominent mystic Manly P. Hall, claimed to have deciphered information hidden in George Wither’s 1635 book A Collection of Emblemes, Ancient and Moderne that under {{the foundations of the}} first brick church at Bruton Parish was a secret vault containing lost writings by Sir Francis Bacon, including proof that Bacon was the true author of Shakespeare’s plays and plans for a utopian society. Bauer received permission from the parish to conduct an excavation, and using coordinates she reportedly decoded from various tombstones on the grounds, uncovered the foundations of the original 1683 brick church. The excavation was halted after <b>digging</b> to a <b>depth</b> of about nine feet for fear of desecrating the graves in the churchyard. Bauer then hired an engineering firm to conduct metal-detecting tests on the site, which concluded that “At a depth of from sixteen to twenty feet square…lies a body partially filled and much larger than an ordinary tomb.” ...|$|R
60|$|Without {{committing}} {{ourselves to}} those enthusiastic praises and prophesyings of the Weissnichtwo'sche Anzeiger, we {{admitted that the}} Book had in a high degree excited us to self-activity, {{which is the best}} effect of any book; that it had even operated changes in our way of thought; nay, that it promised to prove, as it were, the opening of a new mine-shaft, wherein the whole world of Speculation might henceforth <b>dig</b> to unknown <b>depths.</b> More specially may it now be declared that Professor Teufelsdrockh's acquirements, patience of research, philosophic and even poetic vigor, are here made indisputably manifest; and unhappily no less his prolixity and tortuosity and manifold ineptitude; that, on the whole, as in opening new mine-shafts is not unreasonable, there is much rubbish in his Book, though likewise specimens of almost invaluable ore. A paramount popularity in England we cannot promise him. Apart from the choice of such a topic as Clothes, too often the manner of treating it betokens in the Author a rusticity and academic seclusion, unblamable, indeed inevitable in a German, but fatal to his success with our public.|$|R
