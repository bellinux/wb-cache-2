2500|$|Pathophysiology is {{a branch}} of {{medicine}} which explains {{the function of the}} body as it relates to diseases and conditions. The pathophysiology of hypertension is an area which attempts to explain mechanistically the causes of hypertension, which is a chronic disease characterized by <b>elevation</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pressure.</b> Hypertension can be classified by cause as either essential (also known as primary or idiopathic) or secondary. About 90–95% of hypertension is essential hypertension. [...] Some authorities define essential hypertension as that which has no known explanation, while others define its cause as being due to overconsumption of sodium and underconsumption of potassium. Secondary hypertension indicates that the hypertension is a result of a specific underlying condition with a well-known mechanism, such as chronic kidney disease, narrowing of the aorta or kidney arteries, or endocrine disorders such as excess aldosterone, cortisol, or catecholamines. Persistent hypertension is a major risk factor for hypertensive heart disease, coronary artery disease, stroke, aortic aneurysm, peripheral artery disease, and chronic kidney disease.|$|E

40|$|These {{experiments}} indicate that, in dogs at least, ischemia localized to {{the kidneys}} is a sufficient {{condition for the}} production of persistently elevated systolic <b>blood</b> <b>pressure.</b> When the constriction of both main renal arteries is made only moderately severe in the beginning, the <b>elevation</b> <b>of</b> systolic <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> is unaccompanied by signs of materially decreased renal function. In this respect the hypertension in these animals resembles the hypertension which is associated with so called benign nephrosclerosis in man. Subsequent increase of the constriction of the main renal arteries does not materially damage renal function, probably because of adequate development of accessory circulation. More delicate methods for detecting a change may yet prove that some damage does occur. Almost complete constriction of both main renal arteries, from the beginning, results in great <b>elevation</b> <b>of</b> systolic <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> which is accompanied by severe disturbance of renal function and uremia. This resembles the type of hypertension which is associated with so called malignant nephrosclerosis, in the sense of Fahr (17). In several of the animals with persistent <b>elevation</b> <b>of</b> systolic <b>blood</b> <b>pressure,</b> anatomical changes were observed in the glomeruli, vessels and parenchyma of the kidneys which are most probably directly referable to the ischemia.

40|$|Strained {{breathing}} {{is a natural}} respiratory pattern, with cardiovascular implications. It is associated with social factors, attention, expectation, and anxiety and with defense behavior in animals. An inhibition of active behavior is characteristic. Strained {{breathing is}} based on the functional heterogeneity of the medullary postinspiratory neurons. In stressful circumstances, muscle tension and laryngeal reflexes induce a strong reduction of airflow in the glottis, resulting in a prolonged Stage I of expiration and an elevated intrathoracic <b>pressure.</b> The resulting <b>elevations</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> and CO 2 level further stimulate the strained breathing pattern. The straining factor intrathoracic pressure is an important psychophysiological parameter. Functional aspects of strained breathing may be an elevated brain perfusion and the prevention of hyperventilation.

Frequent strained breathing may contribute to cardiovascular pathology and sleep apnea, creating a link between functional behavior and disease...|$|R

40|$|Recognized {{risk factors}} for {{metrizamide}} myelography are seizure disorder, seizure-threshold-lowering drugs, dehydration, and possibly age. After observing serious neu-rologic complications in diabetic patients after routine metrizamide myelography, a retrospective {{study was conducted to}} determine if diabetes should be considered another independent and important risk factor. Forty-one diabetic patients who had lumbar metrizamide myelograms were compared with a control group of 110 nondiabetic patients. A significantly higher incidence was found of severe vomiting (15 % vs. 3 %, P < 0. 01) and neurologic complications (20 % vs. 2 %, P < 0. 001) in the diabetic population. Neurologic complications included one case each of seizure, severe encephalopathy, auditory and visual hallucinations, and prolonged somnolence and four cases of confu-sion-anxiety.

40|$|Partial {{constriction}} of {{the main}} renal arteries of dogs and other animals is followed by persistent <b>elevation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> (1 - 5). There is good evidence for {{the view that the}} liberation into the <b>blood</b> stream <b>of</b> a substance from the kidney initiates the humoral mechanism that determines the <b>elevation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> (6). A saline extract of normal kidney capable of producing a pressor effect when injected intravenously into animals was first described by Tigerstedt and Bergman (7).

Then it was demonstrated (10, 11) that renin reacts with a globulin in the blood serum to form a heat stable (to boiling) vasoconstrictor and pressor substance, which was named angiotonin (10), and hypertensin (11). It is now recognized that renin is an enzyme and that a globulin in the serum is its substrate (11, 12). To the latter have been given the names, renin activator (10), hypertensin precursor and hypertensinogen (11), preangiotonin an...|$|R

With more severe hypokalemia, flaccid paralysis and hyporeflexia may result. Reports exist of rhabdomyolysis occurring with profound hypokalemia with serum potassium levels less than 2 meq/l.

50|$|Cocaine can be snorted, swallowed, injected, or smoked. Most deaths due {{to cocaine}} are {{accidental}} {{but may also}} be the result of body packing or stuffing with rupture in the gastrointestinal tract. Use of cocaine causes tachyarrhythmias and a marked <b>elevation</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> (hypertension), which can be life-threatening. This can lead to death from acute myocardial infarction, respiratory failure, stroke, cerebral hemorrhage, or heart failure. Cocaine overdose may result in hyperthermia as stimulation and increased muscular activity cause greater heat production. Heat loss is also inhibited by the cocaine-induced vasoconstriction. Cocaine and/or associated hyperthermia may cause muscle cell destruction (rhabdomyolysis) and myoglobinuria resulting in renal failure. Individuals with cocaine overdose should be transported immediately to the nearest emergency department, preferably by ambulance in case cardiac arrest occurs en route. According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, approximately 5000 deaths occur annually in the US due to cocaine overdose.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{outlook for}} {{patients}} with rheumatoid arthritis has improved significantly {{over the last three}} decades with the use of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. However, despite the use of methotrexate, cytokine inhibitors, and molecules targeting T and B cells, a percent-age of patients do not respond or lose their response over time. The autoimmune process in rheumatoid arthritis depends on activation of immune cells, which utilize intracellular kinases to respond to external stimuli such as cytokines, immune complexes, and antigens. In the past decade, small molecules targeting several kinases, such as p 38 MAPK, Syk, and JAK have been developed. Several p 38 MAPK inhibitors proved ineffective in treating rheumatoid arthritis. The Syk inhibitor, fostamatinib, proved superior to placebo in Phase II trials and is currently under Phase III investigation. Tofacitinib, a JAK 1 / 3 inhibitor, was shown to be efficacious in two Phase III trials, while VX- 509, a JAK 3 inhibitor, showed promising results in a Phase II trial. Fostamatinib and tofacitinib were associated with increased rates <b>of</b> infection, <b>elevation</b> <b>of</b> liver enzymes, and neutropenia.
