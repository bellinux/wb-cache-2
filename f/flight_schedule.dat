5|$|McDonnell Douglas DC-10s and Airbus A310-300s made {{up most of}} Biman's {{international}} fleet, {{before the}} delivery of the modern Boeing 777-300ERs started in 2011. Fokker F28s made up {{the remainder of the}} fleet for the domestic and regional sectors, before they were retired in 2012. Biman's fleet contains the second-to-last Douglas DC–10 to come off the production line (l/n 445), and only three other Airbus A310–300s were produced following Biman's purchase of two new Airbus A310s in 1996. The two Fokker F28–4000s were acquired from PBair in 2004 at a cost of $2.91million. Both of these aircraft were built in 1977, making Biman's latest acquisitions the oldest aircraft in its fleet. The ageing fleet made it difficult for Biman to maintain its <b>flight</b> <b>schedule,</b> as the aircraft suffered from mechanical problems, leading to flight delays and cancellations. A number of aircraft remained grounded owing to lack of spare parts as they are no longer manufactured and used parts are difficult to source.|$|E

5|$|Biman {{is notable}} for {{disruptions}} to its <b>flight</b> <b>schedule</b> and poor customer service. In 2007, Biman faced strong criticism from major international airports including London Heathrow Airport and Dubai International Airport for {{its failure to}} maintain flight schedules. Heathrow Airport operator BAA wrote to Biman providing evidence which showed Biman had not achieved the minimum 80% usage of its allocated landing slots at Heathrow, as required by EU and International Air Transport Association (IATA) regulations, {{during the summer of}} 2007. Biman should, therefore, not expect slot allocations at Heathrow for the summer of 2008 and should look to Stansted or Gatwick airports if it wished to continue serving London. Following discussions with BAA, however, Biman obtained landing slots for the summer of 2008 on condition that it achieved 80% usage. Delays continued unabated and in September 2008, Biman's Dhaka–London direct flight utilising a DC-10 aircraft was diverted and landed at Gatwick when it did not have sufficient fuel to remain in a holding pattern over Heathrow following arrival over three hours after the scheduled time. In a 10 September 2008 article published in The Times, Biman was labelled the worst performer for punctuality at Heathrow, with flights delayed on average by three hours. In 2008, the United Nations advised its staff not to fly with Biman, citing both safety and security concerns and Biman's unreliable flight schedules. It was made clear that UN staff who flew with Biman did so at their own risk, and would be ineligible to make claims on insurance. Biman's then newly appointed managing director said he was unaware of the UN directive, but admitted that Biman did face problems in managing its flight schedules. He expected the situation to improve with the procurement of aircraft in the coming months.|$|E

25|$|By September 2007, US Airways {{continued}} to downgrade Pittsburgh International Airport's status from 500 flights a day (with 12,000 employees) in 2001 to just 68 flights a day (with only 1,800 employees). CEO Parker stated his frustration at {{the economics of}} Pittsburgh and referred {{to the possibility of}} service further decreasing. This represented a further deterioration of a strained relationship with Allegheny County, with which the airline shared significant historical ties. US Airways Group Inc. said October 3, 2007 it would cut mainline flights at Pittsburgh International Airport to 22 a day from 31 and reduce regional flights to 46 a day from 77, beginning January 6, 2008, essentially reducing the airport to a destination spoke in its network.

25|$|Tactically, a Marine {{aircraft}} squadron is task-organized for {{a specific}} mission that may call for from one aircraft to the entire squadron. This tactical organization is temporary and fluid and rarely lasts with the same aircraft/aircrews {{for more than one}} mission. This continual reorganization occurs as aircraft and aircrews are rotated onto the <b>flight</b> <b>schedule</b> per aircraft availability, crew rest, and other considerations. A general tactical organizational scheme is: sortie - one aircraft on one mission, under the command of a designated aircraft commander (multi-pilot/crew aircraft only); section - two or three aircraft, under the command of a designated section leader; division - two or three sections under the command of a designated division leader, squadron - two or three divisions, under the command of the squadron commander or his designated representative (e.g., executive officer, operations officer, etc.). Traditionally, the lead aircraft belongs to the commanding officer.|$|E
25|$|NASA {{initially}} {{planned to}} withdraw Atlantis from service in 2008, as the orbiter {{would have been}} due to undergo its third scheduled OMDP. However, because of the timescale of the final retirement of the shuttle fleet, this was deemed uneconomical. It was planned that Atlantis would be kept in near-flight condition {{to be used as a}} parts hulk for Discovery and Endeavour. However, with the significant planned <b>flight</b> <b>schedule</b> up to 2010, the decision was taken to extend the time between OMDPs, allowing Atlantis to be retained for operations. Atlantis was subsequently swapped for one flight of each Discovery and Endeavour in the flight manifest. Atlantis had completed what was meant to be its last flight, STS-132, prior to the end of the shuttle program, but the extension of the Shuttle program into 2011 led to Atlantis being selected for STS-135, the final Space Shuttle mission in July 2011.|$|E
25|$|Later (in 1959) von Braun {{published}} a short booklet, condensed from episodes that {{had appeared in}} This Week Magazine before—describing his updated concept of the first manned lunar landing. The scenario included only a single and relatively small spacecraft—a winged lander with a crew of only two experienced pilots who had already circumnavigated the Moon on an earlier mission. The brute-force direct ascent <b>flight</b> <b>schedule</b> used a rocket design with five sequential stages, loosely based on the Nova designs that were under discussion at this time. After a night launch from a Pacific island, the first three stages would bring the spacecraft (with the two remaining upper stages attached) to terrestrial escape velocity, with each burn creating an acceleration of 8–9 times standard gravity. Residual propellant in the third stage {{would be used for}} the deceleration intended to commence only a few hundred kilometers above the landing site in a crater near the lunar north pole. The fourth stage provided acceleration to lunar escape velocity, while the fifth stage would be responsible for a deceleration during return to the Earth to a residual speed that allows aerocapture of the spacecraft ending in a runway landing, {{much in the way of}} the Space Shuttle. One remarkable feature of this technical tale is that the engineer Wernher von Braun anticipated a medical phenomenon that would become apparent only years later: being a veteran astronaut with no history of serious adverse reactions to weightlessness offers no protection against becoming unexpectedly and violently spacesick.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the implications of}} strategically <b>scheduling</b> <b>flights</b> on user-preferred routes in the Central East Pacific to reduce trajectory crossing points. After first casting the <b>flight</b> <b>scheduling</b> problem {{in terms of a}} job shop scheduling problem, a 0 - 1 integer programming model is used to calculate the optimal departure and en route controls required to generate feasible <b>flight</b> <b>schedules.</b> To enhance the solution, a ration-by-schedule based heuristic is introduced to transform the original model into a subset of problems. By varying attributes of the machines in the job shop scheduling formation, two distinct types of feasible schedules are obtained. The first type of schedules are highly restrictive yet but free of all four-dimensional trajectory crossing points, while the second type are less restrictive but may require limited tactical flight separation maneuvers to alleviate residual crossing points. The average adjusted time savings per flight varied between 1. 8 minutes and 4. 6 minutes per flight when allowing for both strategic <b>flight</b> <b>scheduling</b> and user-preferred <b>flight</b> routing...|$|R

2500|$|On December 26, 1968, a {{commercial}} Pan American 707 landed at Elmendorf [...] AFB instead of Anchorage International Airport because of weather conditions. [...] Clearance was delayed {{several times to}} accommodate other traffic.

2500|$|One {{theory is}} that the Tu-144 maneuvered to avoid a French Mirage chase plane that was {{attempting}} to photograph its unique canards, which were advanced for the time, and that the French and Soviet governments colluded with each other to cover up such details. The flight of the Mirage was denied in the original French report of the incident, perhaps because it was engaged in industrial espionage. More recent reports have admitted the existence of the Mirage (and the fact that the Soviet crew were not told about the Mirage's flight) though not its role in the crash. However, the official press release did state: [...] "though the inquiry established that there was no real risk of collision between the two aircraft, the Soviet pilot was likely to have been surprised." [...] Howard Moon also stresses that last-minute changes to the <b>flight</b> <b>schedule</b> would have disoriented the pilots in a cockpit with notably poor vision. He also cites an eyewitness who claims the co-pilot had agreed to take a camera with him, which he may have been operating {{at the time of the}} evasive manoeuver.
