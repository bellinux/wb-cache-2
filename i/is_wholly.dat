5|$|Immature American {{white and}} scarlet ibises are very {{difficult}} to tell apart, although scarlet ibises tend to have darker legs and bare skin around the face.

5|$|In recent years, {{the company}} has expanded, opening new stores of its own and {{acquiring}} competitors. In 2010, Triumph International acquired Beldona, the leading Swiss distributor of lingerie, and later purchased other distributors in Mexico and the United States. In the latter country, Triumph International has also acquired the majority stake in the luxury dealer Journelle and has since opened two Triumph stores in New York City. The Triumph International AG, headquartered in Munich, under which the company's German business is associated, was once again fully acquired by the company in 2011 through the exclusion of minority shareholders. Since then, company stocks have no longer been traded on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, and the company <b>is</b> <b>wholly</b> owned by the Braun and Spiesshofer families.|$|E
5|$|Newly formed astatine-211 is {{the subject}} of ongoing {{research}} in nuclear medicine. It must be used quickly as it decays with a half-life of 7.2hours; this is long enough to permit multistep labeling strategies. Astatine-211 has potential for targeted alpha particle radiotherapy, since it decays either via emission of an alpha particle (to bismuth-207), or via electron capture (to an extremely short-lived nuclide, polonium-211, which undergoes further alpha decay). Polonium X-rays emitted {{as a result of the}} electron capture branch, in the range of 77–92keV, enable the tracking of astatine in animals and patients. Although astatine-210 has a slightly longer half-life, it <b>is</b> <b>wholly</b> unsuitable because it usually undergoes beta plus decay to the extremely toxic polonium-210.|$|E
5|$|Several {{of these}} villas remain today and {{contribute}} to the dozen Grade II listed buildings in the suburb, which has continued to develop into an affluent area with a village feel. The suburb <b>is</b> <b>wholly</b> contained within the Gateshead council ward of the same name and is represented locally by members of the Liberal Democrats party, though nationally the suburb is represented by the Labour party as part of the constituency of Gateshead. The suburb is home to several schools and churches. The principal landmark in the suburb is St Helen's Church, although also located in the settlement is Underhill, the home of Sir Joseph Swan and the first domestic property in the world to be illuminated by electric light. England international cricketer Graham Onions is a current resident of the suburb.|$|E

5|$|Square Enix Europe is a British {{video game}} {{publisher}} which <b>is</b> <b>wholly</b> owned by Square Enix, a Japanese video game company. Square Enix acquired game publisher Eidos Interactive on 22 April 2009, {{which was then}} merged with Square Enix's European publishing wing and reorganized as Square Enix Europe. This list includes retail, downloadable, and mobile games published by Square Enix Europe since its formation in April 2009. Prior to its purchase, Eidos plc was the holding company for the Eidos group of companies, including publisher Eidos Interactive and development studios such as Crystal Dynamics, IO Interactive, Beautiful Game Studios, and Eidos Montréal. The majority of the titles published by Square Enix Europe have been developed by those former subsidiaries or by newer Square Enix subsidiaries such as Square Enix Montréal. Additionally, most of the titles belong to franchises previously published by Eidos, such as the Tomb Raider, Hitman, Deus Ex, and Championship Manager franchises.|$|E
5|$|Christianity {{discouraged}} {{the burial}} of grave goods so {{the majority of}} examples of insular metalwork that survive from the Christian period {{have been found in}} archaeological contexts that suggest they were rapidly hidden, lost or abandoned. There are a few exceptions, notably portable shrines ("cumdachs") for books or relics, several of which have been continuously owned, mostly by churches on the Continent—though the Monymusk Reliquary has always been in Scotland. The highest quality survivals are either secular jewellery, the largest and most elaborate pieces probably for male wearers, tableware or altarware. The finest church pieces were probably made by secular workshops, often attached to a royal household, though other pieces were made by monastic workshops. There are a number of large brooches, each of their designs <b>is</b> <b>wholly</b> individual in detail, and the workmanship is varied. Many elements of the designs can be directly related to elements used in manuscripts. Surviving stones used in decoration are semi-precious ones, with amber and rock crystal among the commonest, and some garnets. Coloured glass, enamel and millefiori glass, probably imported, are also used. None of the major insular manuscripts, like the Book of Kells, have preserved their elaborate jewelled metal covers, but documentary evidence indicates that these were as spectacular as the few remaining continental examples.|$|E
5|$|The incisive {{foramina}} (openings in {{the front}} part of the palate) are short, not extending between the first molars. The posterolateral palatal pits (small openings {{at the back of}} the palate, near the third molars) are poorly developed. The mesopterygoid fossa, the gap behind the back margin of the palate, does not usually reach forward between the maxillaries. Its roof either <b>is</b> <b>wholly</b> ossified or contains small sphenopalatine vacuities. Unlike in some other oryzomyines, the buccinator-masticatory foramen and the foramen ovale accessorium, two foramina (openings) in the skull, are not separated by an alisphenoid strut. The pattern of grooves and foramina in the skull indicates that the circulation of the arteries of the head follows the primitive pattern, as in most similar species but unlike in Hylaeamys. Usually, the mastoid bone contains small openings (fenestrations) in T.talamancae, but not in T.bolivaris. In the mandible (lower jaw), the capsular process (a process at the root of the incisor) is weak to absent and the upper and lower masseteric ridges, which anchor some of the chewing muscles, do not join into a single crest and reach their front margin below the first molar.|$|E

5|$|Business US Highway127 (Bus. US127) is a {{business}} loop of US127 through Jackson that <b>is</b> <b>wholly</b> concurrent with M-50. Its southern end is at an interchange in a rural section of Summit Township. From exit34 on US127, the business loop runs north and northwesterly, crossing the Grand River. North of the river, the roadway is bounded by businesses as it runs along Cooper Street through residential areas on the southeastern side of Jackson. In the downtown area, Bus. US127/M-50 merges with Business Loop Interstate94 (BL I-94) and splits to follow a one-way pairing of streets that form a loop through downtown. Northbound traffic continues along {{the eastern side of}} this loop on Cooper Street and crosses the Grand River again. At the intersection with Michigan Avenue, BL I-94/Bus. US127/M-50 turns westward onto Louis Glick Highway around the northern side of downtown. The business loop crosses the Grand River a third and final time along Louis Glick. On the western side of downtown, the business loop angles southwesterly as Louis Glick Highway merges into Michigan Avenue. (At the same time, the southern half of the one-way loop, Washington Street, also splits from Michigan Avenue.) BL I-94/Bus. US127/M-50 follows Michigan Avenue westward through residential neighborhoods to an intersection with West Avenue, where Bus. US127/M-50 turns northward, separating from BL I-94 (Michigan Avenue). As the business loop approaches its parent highway, it transitions into a commercial area. The northern terminus of Bus. US127 is at the same interchange northwest of Jackson in Blackman Township where the US127 and I-94 freeways merge.|$|E
