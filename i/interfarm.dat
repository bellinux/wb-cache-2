25|$|The {{construction}} of irrigation canals began {{on a large}} scale in the 1940s. Many of the canals were poorly built, allowing water to leak or evaporate. From the Qaraqum Canal, the largest in Central Asia, perhaps 30 to 75% of the water went to waste. Today, only 12% of Uzbekistan's irrigation canal length is waterproofed. Of the 47,750km of <b>interfarm</b> irrigation channels in the basin, only 28% have anti-infiltration linings. Only 77% of farm intakes have flow gauges, and of the 268,500km of onfarm channels, only 21% have anti-infiltration linings, which retain on average 15% more water than unlined channels.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background A {{method that}} assesses {{bacterial}} spatial dissemination was explored. It measures microbial genotypes (defined by electrophoretic patterns or EP), host, location (farm), <b>interfarm</b> Euclidean distance, and time. Its {{proof of concept}} (construct and internal validity) was evaluated using a dataset that included 113 Staphylococcus aureus EPs from 1126 bovine milk isolates collected on 23 farms between 1988 and 2005. Results Construct validity was assessed by comparing results based on the <b>interfarm</b> Euclidean distance (a spatially explicit measure) and those produced by the (non-spatial) <b>interfarm</b> number of isolates reporting the same EP. The distance associated with EP spread correlated with the <b>interfarm</b> number of isolates/EP (r =. 59, P r =. 72, P r =. 87, P Conclusion Findings supported both construct and internal validity. Because 3 EPs explained 12 times more isolates than expected and {{at least twice as}} many isolates as other EPs did, false negative results associated with the remaining EPs (those erroneously identified as lacking spatial dispersal when, in fact, they disseminated spatially), if they occurred, seemed to have negligible effects. Spatial analysis of laboratory data may support disease surveillance systems by generating hypotheses on microbial dispersal ability. </p...|$|E

Surveillance data and genetic analyses indicated multiple introductions of low pathogenicity avian influenza virus before mutation to high pathogenicity and <b>interfarm</b> transmission. Poultry surveillance should continue because low pathogenicity viruses circulate and {{spill over into}} commercial poultry. 28880836 PMC 565243...|$|E
40|$|Next-generation {{sequencing}} technology {{is now being}} increasingly applied to study the within- and between-host population dynamics of viruses. However, information on avian influenza virus evolution and transmission during a naturally occurring epidemic is still limited. Here, we use deep-sequencing data obtained from clinical samples collected from five industrial holdings and a backyard farm infected during the 2013 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H 7 N 7 epidemic in Italy to unravel (i) the epidemic virus population diversity, (ii) the evolution of virus pathogenicity, and (iii) the pathways of viral transmission between different holdings and sheds. We show {{a high level of}} genetic diversity of the HPAI H 7 N 7 viruses within a single farm as a consequence of separate bottlenecks and founder effects. In particular, we identified the cocirculation in the index case of two viral strains showing a different insertion at the hemagglutinin cleavage site, as well as nine nucleotide differences at the consensus level and 92 minority variants. To assess <b>interfarm</b> transmission, we combined epidemiological and genetic data and identified the index case as the major source of the virus, suggesting the spread of different viral haplotypes from the index farm to the other industrial holdings, probably at different time points. Our results revealed <b>interfarm</b> transmission dynamics that the epidemiological data alone could not unravel and demonstrated that delay in the disease detection and stamping out was the major cause of the emergence and the spread of the HPAI strain...|$|E

The {{result has been a}} more integrated approach to the elaboration of plans for economic and social development; the better assessment of objective possibilities for the growth of production on all categories of farms, including the personal plots of workers and collective farmers; the determination of rational modes of intensification of farming and animal husbandry and the siting and specialization of agricultural production on the basis of <b>interfarm</b> cooperation and agroindustrial integration; the more consistent use of normative balance methods of substantiating plans at all levels, etc. ...|$|E
40|$|Using time series, {{cross-sectional}} data, {{the paper}} describes and explains <b>interfarm</b> variations in managerial {{performance in the}} semi arid tropics of rural South India. The study focuses on the consequences of personal characteristics on efficiency as measured by relative productivity differences in net returns to management. Managerial performance is statistically evaluated with respect to farmers in the same village. The study is based on data for five cropping years from 1975 / 76 to 1979 / 80 collected from the ICRISAT Village Level Studies. Farming experience was the overriding consideration separating good from bad managers. Older farmers, those born into traditional farming, and those who practised hands-on farming, had significantly higher returns to management. These results emphasize the importance in understanding occupational status by migration interactio...|$|E
40|$|The {{geography}} of farm-size variation {{has tended to}} overlook the relationships between physical size and agricultural productivity. This paper remedies that deficiency by explicitly considering the mechanisms promoting viability across the spectrum of farm-size gradation. Aspects of internal and external economies of scale, <b>interfarm</b> competition, local comparative advantage, and spatial separation are incorporated in a conceptual framework developed for a Canadian Prairie setting (Manitoba). In addition, social and cultural influences on the farm-size determinants are monitored. An equation system is established consisting of three structural equations, one each for large farms, medium-size farms, and small farms, and is calibrated by using two-stage least-squares regression. Results indicate that regional factors tend to overshadow the indices of economies of scale, but that efficiency considerations {{vary according to the}} size of farm. ...|$|E
40|$|Outbreaks {{of highly}} {{pathogenic}} avian influenza in poultry can cause severe economic damage and represent {{a public health}} threat. Development of efficient containment measures requires {{an understanding of how}} these influenza viruses are transmitted between farms. However, the actual mechanisms of <b>interfarm</b> transmission are largely unknown. Dispersal of infectious material by wind has been suggested, but never demonstrated, as a possible cause of transmission between farms. Here we provide statistical evidence that the direction of spread of avian influenza A(H 7 N 7) is correlated with the direction of wind at date of infection. Using detailed genetic and epidemiological data, we found the direction of spread by reconstructing the transmission tree for a large outbreak in the Netherlands in 2003. We conservatively estimate the contribution of a possible wind-mediated mechanism to the total amount of spread during this outbreak to be around 18 %. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E
40|$|Factors {{explaining}} {{differences in}} economic efficiency between farms are of major interest to owners, managers, and other stakeholders as they strive to improve earnings {{and improve the}} chances of firm survival. This study is undertaken to improve our understanding of <b>interfarm</b> differences in, and opportunities to improve, farm household efficiency in utilizing their land, labor, and capital resources to achieve household objectives. The technical, allocative, and scale efficiencies of farm households are estimated using a nonparametric, output-based data envelopment analysis (DEA) of a panel data set from 1993 to 2006. Single and double bootstrapping procedures are used to estimate technical efficiency. Initial technical efficiency assuming variable returns to scale (TEV) {{is estimated to be}} 0. 83. Using single bootstrapping, the average bias-corrected TEV estimate is 0. 70; using double bootstrapping, the TEV estimate is 0. 72. Allocative efficiency is estimated to be 0. 81. Scale efficiency is estimated to be 0. 93. The only factor that is consistently associated with higher technical efficiency across analysis methods and years is larger farm size (as measured by the log of farm income). The significance of other factors changes with analysis methods. Copyright (c) 2009 International Association of Agricultural Economists. ...|$|E

The {{perspective}} {{scheme of}} {{infrastructure of the}} modern grain market is directed on perfection merchandising grains by means of liquidation of is material disproportions between its participants for decrease in logistical costs counting upon 1 t grains, and creations of the alternative organized channel merchandising, providing a direct output on the wholesale market of direct commodity producers of grain and their participation in distribution of profit received from export. Elimination of is material disproportions on all circuit passage of grain from the supplier of production {{up to the end}} user is necessary for connecting with the organization merchandising on principles of logistics. It will allow to ensure the general synergistic effect exceeding total effect at separate participants of a circuit. The structure of Association participants of the grain market, is directed on creation mutual interest by a deepening specialization of each participant merchandising, consolidations of their investment resources to development of this circuit, to decrease in logistical costs. Feature of the modern period functioning of the grain market is necessity acceleration of scientific and technical progress on the basis of innovative processes. Innovative activity causes necessity of faster development of an infrastructure of the grain market. One directions promotion of innovations is development in region techno park formations.
