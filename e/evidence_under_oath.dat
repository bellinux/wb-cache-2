500|$|The Commission {{recommended}} various changes. On {{the criminal}} law side, they supported reducing {{the use of the}} death penalty, although [...] "wilful murderers" [...] were still to be executed, and the abduction of a child under 16 was to be considered a capital crime. They also suggested allowing prisoners access to lawyers in any case where the prosecution was permitted representation and allowing witnesses for the defence to give <b>evidence</b> <b>under</b> <b>oath.</b> Legal aid was also considered, although the rejection of a case where legal aid was given would result in the defendant being sent to a workhouse for a month and whipped. The abolition of peine forte et dure as a way to avoid the forfeiture of land was also proposed.|$|E
2500|$|Judge William Ehrcke {{said it was}} [...] "preposterous" [...] {{that the}} Mountie claimed Dziekanski was {{standing}} while he was stunned a second time, when it's clear from bystander video that Dziekanski {{was already on the}} ground.

50|$|Fustuarium was {{the penalty}} when a sentry deserted his post and for {{stealing}} from one's fellow soldiers in camp. A soldier who committed {{an act of}} theft (furtum) against civilians by contrast had his right hand cut off. The fustuarium was also the punishment for falsifying <b>evidence</b> and lying <b>under</b> <b>oath,</b> or for committing the same offence three times.|$|R
5000|$|In November 2000, {{after the}} Court of Appeal hearing, {{a witness who}} testified at his trial {{contacted}} the Weekend Herald to say his <b>evidence</b> given <b>under</b> <b>oath</b> was [...] "nothing more than an act". He said he was being threatened by gang members in prison; he was coming up for parole and was put under pressure by police to testify and [...] "I agreed {{on the basis that}} my life was getting threatened". The witness changed his story at least twice more which led Watson's lawyers to conclude he was completely unreliable.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} 1787 {{text of the}} Constitution of the United States makes three {{references to}} an [...] "oath or affirmation": In Article I, Senators must take a special oath or affirmation {{for the purpose of}} sitting as the tribunal for impeachment; in Article II, the president is required to take a specified oath or affirmation before entering office (see oath of office); and in Article VI, all state and federal officials must take an oath or affirmation to support the US Constitution. A fourth appears in Amendment IV, all warrants must be supported by <b>evidence</b> given <b>under</b> <b>oath</b> or affirmation.|$|R

In my first {{published}} account, there were given some smaller details of the story, of no particular value to {{the main purpose of}} it, which I received not from Lady Byron, but from her confidential friend. One of these was the account of her seeing Lord Byron's favourite spaniel lying at his door, and the other was the scene of the parting.|$|E

5000|$|The {{reasoning}} {{behind the}} hearsay rule {{can be seen}} by comparing the acceptance of direct evidence and hearsay. Direct <b>evidence</b> is given <b>under</b> <b>oath</b> (with potential criminal liability for perjury if the testimony is subsequently proven false), {{in the presence of the}} court and jury, and may be cross-examined. In adducing direct evidence (that is, recollection of a witness in court) the court considers how the witness would have perceived the event at the time, potential ambiguities, and the witness's sincerity. These can be tested in cross-examination.|$|R
5000|$|On December 10, 1998, Schippers {{said to the}} committee: [...] "The President, then, has lied <b>under</b> <b>oath</b> in a civil deposition, lied <b>under</b> <b>oath</b> in a {{criminal}} grand jury. He lied to the people, he lied to his Cabinet, he lied to his top aides, and now he's lied <b>under</b> <b>oath</b> to the Congress of the United States. There's no one left to lie to." ...|$|R

Further, when the Duke {{was asked if he}} planned to reply <b>under</b> <b>oath,</b> he refused to answer and left the room. The American government may also be trying to prevent the Duke having to testify <b>under</b> <b>oath.</b>|$|R
50|$|At {{the end of}} the state's case, {{the court}} should inform an undefended accused that a plea {{explanation}} is no substitute for <b>evidence</b> <b>under</b> <b>oath.</b> All warnings, explanations, etc., should be properly recorded. The effect of a formal admission is to relieve the state of the necessity of proving the fact or facts in question. Such formal admissions are only of facts unfavourable to the accused.|$|E
50|$|The Tribunal heard {{evidence}} in July 1997 {{and produced a}} 100-page report the following month. This report found that Haughey had given untrue <b>evidence</b> <b>under</b> <b>oath</b> and that Lowry was knowingly assisted by Dunne in evading tax. As {{a result of the}} findings and revelation of substantial funds in secret Ansbacher accounts, owned by Haughey, the new Ahern Government established a more extensive follow-up, the Moriarty Tribunal to investigate the financial affairs of the two politicians.|$|E
5000|$|The Council of Tribunals should {{direct the}} {{particular}} procedure in each case, {{with the aim}} of combining order with an informal atmosphere. Citizens should have a prior knowledge of the right to apply to participate and public knowledge of the proceedings unless the content is of sensitive nature, with legal representation normally allowed. Tribunals empowered to take <b>evidence</b> <b>under</b> <b>oath,</b> subpoena witnesses and award remedies. Decisions should give full reasons and a copy sent to all parties. Final appellate tribunal to publish its decision for lower tribunals.|$|E
50|$|In {{terms of}} the witness' {{testimony}} {{as a means of}} legal proof, the judge will compare a witness’ testimony against other witness testimonies or other means of proof to determine whether the testimony is true. In the process, he also considers all other factors that affect the witness’ credibility. A witness usually makes a testimony <b>under</b> <b>oath.</b> However, a testimony not made <b>under</b> <b>oath</b> can still be admitted as supplemental legal evidence if it is consistent with a testimony made <b>under</b> <b>oath.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The release, {{dissemination}} {{or use of}} expunged records by any {{agency is}} prohibited.

2500|$|Note: In hearsay law, [...] "witness" [...] means {{someone who}} testifies <b>under</b> <b>oath,</b> from {{the witness stand}} and [...] "declarant" [...] refers to someone who makes a {{statement}} of any kind, whether or not <b>under</b> <b>oath,</b> and whether {{in or out of}} court (according to the Federal Rules of Evidence).|$|R
50|$|In August 2006, Einfeld contested a 77 {{speeding}} ticket {{by claiming}} he had lent {{his car to}} an old friend, Professor Teresa Brennan, {{at the time it}} was caught by a speed camera. He gave <b>evidence</b> <b>under</b> <b>oath</b> in the Local Court and he also signed a statutory declaration to that effect. However, it was later revealed that Professor Brennan had been killed in a road accident in the United States in February 2003, and that Einfeld was aware of it. This was the basis for Einfeld's conviction for knowingly making a false statement under oath.|$|E
50|$|In 1938, the Australian Government {{appointed}} Clemens {{to conduct}} an inquiry into {{the high cost of}} living in Canberra. As part of the inquiry, Clemens was tasked with investigating why the costs of meat, vegetables, milk, groceries and other food in Canberra was much higher than in other nearby cities. While the inquiry was not a Royal Commission, Clemens was still granted the powers to call witnesses, take <b>evidence</b> <b>under</b> <b>oath,</b> and demand the production of books and documents. His report, delivered in March 1939, in six sections, recommended administrative action against monopolies controlling supply in the ACT.|$|E

As National Security Advisor, Condoleezza Rice claimed {{that she was not}} required to testify <b>under</b> <b>oath</b> because the position of National Security Advisor is an advisory role, independent of authority over a bureaucracy and does not require confirmation by the Senate. Legal scholars disagree on the legitimacy of her claim. Eventually, Condoleezza Rice testified publicly and <b>under</b> <b>oath.</b>|$|R

Penhalluriack was referred to a Councillor Conduct Panel in November 2011. Penhalluriack made an application to have the matter referred to the Victorian Civil and Administration Tribunal (VCAT), where Penhalluriack would be entitled to hear <b>evidence</b> <b>under</b> <b>oath,</b> and cross-examine his accusers; the application was accepted and the issue was referred. The VCAT hearing was adjourned after three days due to {{a conflict of interest}} by one of the VCAT members, and subsequently lapsed when Penhalluriak was not re-elected.|$|E

5000|$|The {{timing and}} nature of the inquiry - and {{particularly}} the fact that it would not issue its report until after the 2010 general election - generated political controversy. Conservative Party leader David Cameron dismissed the inquiry as [...] "an establishment stitch-up", and the Liberal Democrats threatened a boycott. In a parliamentary debate over the establishment of the inquiry, MPs from all the major parties criticised the government's selection of its members. MPs drew attention to the absence of anyone with first-hand military expertise, the absence of members with acknowledged or proven inquisitorial skills, and the absence of any elected representatives. Several MPs drew {{attention to the fact that}} Chilcot would be unable to receive <b>evidence</b> <b>under</b> <b>oath.</b> Gilbert's appointment to the enquiry was criticised on the basis that he had once compared Bush and Blair to Roosevelt and Churchill.|$|E

5000|$|The {{court martial}} of Newcombe and his {{officers}} for their conduct during the mutiny {{took place on}} 7 June 1801 on board [...] off Alexandria. The court acquitted Newcombe and his officers, judging that the crew (many of whom were foreigners), had risen and overpowered the officers or restrained them and that the gunner, Mr. Lewyn, was to be especially commended for having resisted until wounded. The court gave its opinion that Lieutenant William Prosser Kent was unfit to hold a commission in the Navy because he refused, [...] "from mistaken religious motives", to give his <b>evidence</b> <b>under</b> <b>oath.</b> It further stated that it had {{reason to believe that}} Master’s Mate John Tyroll (or Tyrell), although away in a prize {{at the time of the}} mutiny, knew of the plan and had not given warning. The court recommended further investigation into the crewmen Alexander M’Kiever and Thomas Parsons, who had been seen armed.|$|E
5000|$|On 21 December 2014 it was {{reported}} that Theresa May was reconsidering arrangements for the inquiry, and that the panel could be abandoned. The options that were reportedly being considered included turning the existing inquiry into a statutory inquiry; setting up a fresh statutory inquiry; or establishing a Royal Commission. [...] According to the Exaro news website, May wrote to each panel member with the proposals following a meeting with them earlier in the month, adding that existing panel members could be considered for roles under the new arrangements. One panel member, Sharon Evans, reported that she felt [...] "devastated" [...] at the proposal, but that it had been made clear that the panel would be abolished early in 2015. [...] She highlighted that a greater number of survivors the inquiry panel had already met with had provided feedback, with 90% saying they had confidence in the existing panel.

50|$|The {{official}} {{primary cause}} for the accident was a gross structural failure of the aircraft's main spar, which was confirmed by amateur footage, photographs and eyewitness accounts. The reason for the failure was not determined by the Board of Inquiry (BoI), but it was suggested by an accident investigator called in by Rolls Royce that the main cause was that the pilot, upon performing the planned aerobatic display, exceeded the prototype's briefed speed and turning rate limits.The accident investigator submitted {{a statement to the}} BoI, but did not give <b>evidence</b> <b>under</b> <b>oath.</b> The BoI was apparently not informed that the aircraft manufacturer considered the basis for the statement to be invalid.The Technical Officer of the Board of Inquiry (BoI) identified a suspected fatigue failure of the inboard arm of the front bottom wing attachment main forging, and suggested vibration from the high airflow volumes required by the RR Conway 11 engines as a possible cause.The Royal Aircraft Establishment carried out a structural analysis of the wreckage and produced a report on 21 April 1960, but no copy has been found in the public record.Tony Blackman argues that the maintenance crew failed to properly inspect the aircraft for known issues with stress damage to the aircraft's leading edges and structural ribs, which had been observed in another prototype he had flown earlier.|$|E
