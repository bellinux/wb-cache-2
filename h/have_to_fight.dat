5|$|The {{number of}} ready-use rounds is {{insufficient}} and the hoists are desperately slow. The 47mm guns, {{much more so}} than the large and medium-calibre guns, will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> at night; yet these are the only guns without a fire-control system designed for night operations. This is a deficiency which needs to be corrected as soon as possible.|$|E
5|$|However, Peloponnesians {{may have}} been party to Themistocles's stratagem, so serenely did they accept that they would now <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> at Salamis. The Allied navy was thus able to prepare {{properly}} for battle the forthcoming day, whilst the Persians spent the night fruitlessly at sea, searching for the alleged Greek evacuation. The next morning, the Persians rowed into the straits to attack the Greek fleet; {{it is not clear}} when, why or how this decision was made, {{but it is clear that}} they did take the battle to the Allies.|$|E

5|$|During their {{fighting}} retreat up the Rhône, the Germans also withdrew {{their remaining}} forces from their garrisons in south-western France. These divisions raced {{north along the}} Atlantic coast and then swung towards the east at the Loire to link up {{with the rest of}} Army GroupG at Burgundy. While they did not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> the Western Allies as much as the Germans had done at the Rhône, they still had to advance through French partisan-dominated terrain. About 88,000 men moved north, leaving 20,000 in south-western France behind. During the retreat, about 19,000 men were captured by the Allies and 60,000 men reached Army GroupG's line, where they were integrated into the defense of the Vosges mountains.|$|E
5|$|The {{first season}} of the {{international}} fantasy series , part of the Highlander franchise, consisted of 22 episodes produced between 1992 and 1993, and began airing on October 3, 1992 in broadcast syndication. Highlander: The Series follows the adventures of Duncan MacLeod, a 400-year-old Immortal who can only die if he is beheaded; conflict inevitably finds him because {{he is part of}} the Game, an ongoing battle in which all Immortals <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> and behead each other until only one is left. The season was released on DVD as a nine-disc boxed set on November 12, 2002 by Anchor Bay Entertainment. It is also available at the online video on demand service Hulu, a joint venture between NBC and Fox Broadcasting Company.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{unfavorable}} {{developments in}} South Vietnam, North Vietnamese General Tran Van Tra believed North Vietnam and the Viet Cong could still {{win the war}} if they pursued a strategy of attrition. In other words, the Communists would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> on {{for as long as}} possible, until the United States recognized that the war was unwinnable and would disengage from the conflict in Vietnam. To achieve that objective at the tactical level, Tra argued that North Vietnamese and Viet Cong forces would have to destroy American military units, and cause as many casualties as possible until they got tired and left. Indeed, towards mid-1967 General Thanh, who had the Viet Cong 7th and 9th Division at his disposal, was out to do just that. In June, U.S. military forces in III Corps Tactical Zone began to detect the build-up of Viet Cong troops in northern Phuoc Vinh located War Zone D. To stop a major enemy attack on Phuoc Vinh, Major General John H. Hay—commander of the U.S. 1st Infantry Division—launched Operation Billings with the objective of trapping three Viet Cong battalions in War Zone D.|$|E

5|$|Double Fine {{believed}} they were given the go-ahead to develop a sequel to Brütal Legend after the game's release, and had invested {{a great deal of}} development time towards this, but were later told by EA that it was cancelled. Schafer stated that the sequel would likely incorporate much of what they had to drop prior to the game's release. This game world would have been three times larger than what Brütal Legend contained. The sequel would have likely included a fourth faction that was cut from the original game which would have been the last major group the player would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> through, including a major boss character, before the final battles with Doviculus. Schafer further noted {{that at the end of}} the original game, Doviculus' head falls into the Sea of Black Tears, and implied that the same effect that the Sea had on Ophelia could happen to Doviculus. Schafer also had ideas for a plot using a character voiced by Ronnie James Dio, but will not likely be used due to Dio's death.|$|E
5|$|In late 2008 Rey Hechicero was {{scheduled}} to team up with Último Guerrero for a Ruelta de la Muerta ("Roulette of death") tournament where the losers of the match advance and the losing team would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> each other for their masks. Rey Hechicero suffered an injury shortly before the tournament {{and had to be}} replaced by Difunto II. There was no verification if Rey Hechicero was indeed injured or if the replacement was done because whomever had originally agreed to lose their mask changed their mind and Difunto II agreed to lose his match. Also in 2008 Rey Hechicero began working for a local promotion called Poder Y Honor ("Power and Honor"; PYH) and in 2009 he outlasted Chucho Mar Jr., Estrella Dorada Jr. and Tigre Universitario to become the inargual PYH Heavyweight Champion. In the following years he worked for a number of wrestling promotions as they toured through Monterrey, including winning the mask of Caifán Rockero I on a Perros del Mal show in March 2010. While he began working for Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre ("World Wrestling Council"; CMLL) in 2014, he was also allowed to work for various local promotions by CMLL. On December 25, 2014 Rey Hechicero unsuccessfully challenged Black Terry for the FLLM Master Championship on a Cara Lucha show in Ciudad Nezahualcoyotl.|$|E
5|$|On 9 September, Suwito {{informed}} a British diplomat {{that the}} Strait would be closed for naval exercises {{and that it}} would be appreciated if British warships steered clear of the area in the interim. To Britain, this seemed an escalation of the Crisis, as if the task force sailed through they might <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> the Indonesian Navy directly, though in fact Indonesia was lessening its resolve to refuse the task force passage through the Strait, and hoped to keep the British from attempting to force their way through via more indirect means. This was not the way the British interpreted it, however, and the announcement triggered a new round of debates over the forced passage. Thorneycroft reviewed the plan with the Foreign Office, Ministry of Defence, and the Commonwealth Relations Office, most of whom told him to consider the opinions of the commanders on site. After remembering the influential Lord Head's endorsement of Begg's views, Thorneycroft was swayed, and decided that the two destroyers should proceed through the Strait without the Victorious, using the aircraft of that vessel and the Centaur for cover. Though worried about the psychological effect of the non-passage of the carrier, he was reminded that Britain had not informed Jakarta that the ship would return that way in the first place.|$|E

5|$|Several modern {{historians have}} also praised the {{operation}} and the improvements that were made for Varsity. G. G. Norton argued that the operation benefited from the lessons learned from previous operations, and Brian Jewell agrees, arguing that the lessons of Market Garden had been learned as the airborne forces were concentrated and quickly dropped, giving the defenders little time to recover. Norton also argues that improvements were made for supporting the airborne troops; he notes {{that a large number}} of artillery pieces were available to cover the landings and that observers were dropped with the airborne forces, thus augmenting the firepower and flexibility of the airborne troops. He also highlights the development of a technique that allowed entire brigades to be landed in tactical groups, giving them greater flexibility. Dropping the airborne forces after the ground forces had breached the Rhine also ensured that the airborne troops would not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> for long before being relieved, a major improvement on the manner in which the previous large-scale airborne operation, Market Garden, had been conducted.|$|E
5|$|The Six Man Tag Team Street Fight {{between the}} team of Jay Lethal and MCMG (Alex Shelley and Chris Sabin) and {{the team of}} Johnny Devine and Team 3D (Brother Devon and Brother Ray). The {{stipulation}}s were if Lethal and MCMG won then Team 3D {{would be forced to}} work with a weight limit, while if Devine and Team 3D won the TNA X Division would dissemble. Another added stipulation before the contest was whoever gained the pinfall would win the TNA X Division Championship. It lasted twelve minutes and thirty seconds. A Street Fight is fought under no disqualification and no count-out rules, with weapons legal and provided for the match. During the final minutes, both Sabin and Shelley were scripted to appear unconscious at ringside, which caused Lethal to <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> off Devine and Team 3D alone. Near the end of the match Team 3D set up a table; Lethal followed by sending both out of the ring and laying Devine over the table. Lethal then stood {{on the top of a}} padded turnbuckle and jumped off to perform an elbow drop on Devine through the table to win the match. With the victory, Lethal won the TNA X Division Championship, prevented the X Division from disbanding, and forced Team 3D to work with a weight limit in the company.|$|E

25|$|On {{an audio}} {{commentary}} {{track in the}} Criterion edition of the DVD, Gilliam expresses great pride in the film and says {{it was one of}} the few times where he did not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> extensively with the studio during the filming. Gilliam chalks this up to the fact that many of the studio executives read Thompson's book in their youth and understood it could not be made into a conventional Hollywood film. However, he does express frustration with the advertising campaign used during its initial release, which he says tried to sell it as wacky comedy. The film was later released by Universal Studios on HD DVD and, subsequently, Blu-ray; Criterion released the film on Blu-ray on April 26, 2011.|$|E
