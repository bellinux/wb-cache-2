5|$|During {{this brief}} war, one Pony Express mailing, which left San Francisco on July 21, 1860, <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>immediately</b> reach its destination. That mail pouch (mochila) {{did not reach}} St. Joseph and {{subsequently}} New York until almost two years later.|$|E
5|$|After {{scattering}} the Americans at Kip's Bay, Howe landed 9,000 more troops, but <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>immediately</b> {{cut off the}} American {{retreat from}} New York Town {{in the south of}} the island. Washington had all of his troops in the city on their way to north along the westside of Manhattan to Harlem Heights by 4:00 pm and they all reached the fortifications on the Heights by nightfall.|$|E
5|$|In 1926, West Mersea {{became a}} self-governing urban district, which {{allowed it to}} set up a {{self-contained}} water and sewer system. Unlike several other coastal resorts, the island <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>immediately</b> develop any holidaymaker facilities aside from the beach huts which now stretch along the Esplanade.|$|E

5|$|On 2 December Hague {{announced}} {{the results of}} the joint investigation, which concluded that Norgrove was accidentally killed by a grenade thrown by a US sailor. Navy SEALs <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>immediately</b> notify senior officers about throwing the grenade; this breached military law, and a number of sailors were disciplined.|$|E
5|$|Robinson's {{political}} career began in 1851, {{when he was}} elected to the Kentucky Senate as a Whig without opposition. He <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>immediately</b> seek re-election, but was again elected to the state Senate in 1861 over challenger James B. Beck. He was elected Speaker of the Senate on September 2, 1861, but resigned the post only a few days later.|$|E
5|$|After {{completing}} the course at Sandhurst, Ismay was placed fourth overall in its examinations and was commissioned {{as a second}} lieutenant in the Indian Army. Ismay was then attached to the Gloucestershire Regiment of the British Army in Ambala, where he served a one year mandatory apprenticeship. After leaving the regiment, Ismay <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>immediately</b> {{find a place in}} the Indian cavalry, so he spent nine months floating among positions with various British and Indian units.|$|E

5|$|An {{immediate}} concern of environmentalists was the potential {{use of chemical}} dispersants. To keep big slicks from washing ashore, dispersants {{can be used to}} break the oil into small droplets that disperse throughout the water column. There are significant concerns about the health effects of the dispersants and the effects on aquatic life. Coast Guard officials overseeing the cleanup indicated that no chemical dispersants were being used but <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>immediately</b> rule the use of them out.|$|E
5|$|Hastings {{began to}} study law with Charles Thorpe, Esq., of Norwich. After {{a few months of}} study, he decided to move to Lawrenceburg, Indiana. He {{completed}} his legal studies there with Daniel S. Majors, Esq. He <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>immediately</b> enter the practice of law and instead became an editor of the Indiana Signal, where he supported Martin Van Buren in his presidential campaign. He moved to Terre Haute, Indiana, in December 1836 and underwent a legal examination by Judge Porters of the Circuit Court.|$|E
5|$|On lap 22, Zorzi {{pulled off}} to {{the left side of the}} main straight, just after the brow of a hill and a bridge over the track. He was having {{problems}} with his fuel metering unit, and fuel was pumping directly onto the engine, which then caught fire.

5|$|The Superbas lodged a {{complaint}} against the Reds, claiming that Kelley was still under their control, seeking compensation from the Reds. However, the other NL owners saw the situation as a coup for their league, and compelled Hanlon to drop his complaint. Kelley <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>immediately</b> report to Cincinnati, instead traveling to Boston to attempt to convince members of the Boston Americans {{to join him in}} the NL. Kelley joined the Reds on July 31.|$|E
5|$|The {{administration}} of Mashonaland <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>immediately</b> prove profitable for the Company or its investors, {{partly because of}} the costly police force, which Rhodes dramatically downsized in 1891 to save money. There also existed the problem of land ownership; Britain recognised the Company's subsoil rights in Mashonaland, but not its possession of the land itself, and the Company therefore could not grant titles to land or accept rents and other payments from farmers.|$|E
5|$|The {{resignation}} of Ponce Vaides {{and the creation}} of the junta has been considered by scholars to be the beginning of the Guatemalan Revolution. However, the revolutionary junta <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>immediately</b> threaten the interests of the landed elite. Two days after Ponce Vaides' resignation, a violent protest erupted at Patzic√≠a, a small Indian hamlet. The junta responded with swift brutality, silencing the protest. The dead civilians included women and children.|$|E

5|$|Trade routes {{not only}} {{supplied}} physical goods, they facilitated {{the movement of}} people and ideas throughout Mesoamerica. Shifts in trade routes occurred with {{the rise and fall}} of important cities in the Maya region, and have been identified in every major reorganization of the Maya civilization, such as the rise of Preclassic Maya civilization, the transition to the Classic, and the Terminal Classic collapse. Even the Spanish Conquest <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>immediately</b> terminate all Maya trading activity; for example, the Contact period Manche Ch'ol traded the prestige crops of cacao, annatto and vanilla into colonial Verapaz.|$|E
5|$|Alexios, who was {{fighting}} with his retinue alongside the Franks, <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>immediately</b> realize that his left wing had collapsed. In the meantime, {{on his right}} wing, the Chomatenoi, engaged with Tarchaneiotes's men, were outflanked and attacked in the rear by the Pechenegs, who had somehow evaded Alexios's Turkish flank-guards. The Chomatenoi too broke and fled, and Alexios's fate seemed sealed. At this point the Pechenegs failed to follow up their success, and instead turned back and began looting Bryennios's own camp. After gathering what plunder they could, they left the battle and made for their homes.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the Detours had become the Who, they had already found regular gigs, {{including}} at the Oldfield Hotel in Greenford, the White Hart Hotel in Acton, the Goldhawk Social Club in Shepherd's Bush, and the Notre Dame Hall in Leicester Square. They had also replaced Druce as manager with Helmut Gorden, with whom they secured an audition with Chris Parmeinter for Fontana Records. Parmeinter found problems with the drumming and, according to Sandom, Townshend immediately turned on him and threatened to fire him if his playing <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>immediately</b> improve. Sandom left in disgust, but was persuaded to lend his kit to any potential stand-ins or replacements. Sandom and Townshend did not {{speak to each other}} again for 14 years.|$|E

5|$|Caligari <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>immediately</b> {{receive a}} wide {{distribution}} in France due to fears over {{the import of}} German films, but film director Louis Delluc organized a single screening of it on 14 November 1921, at the Colis√©e cinema in Paris {{as part of a}} benefit performance for the Spanish Red Cross. Afterward, the Cosmograph company bought the film's distribution rights and premiered it at the Cin√©-Op√©ra on 2 March 1922. Caligari played in one Paris theatre for seven consecutive years, a record that remained intact until the release of Emmanuelle (1974). According to Janowitz, Caligari was also shown in such European cities as London, Rome, Amsterdam, Stockholm, Brussels, Prague, Vienna, Budapest and Bucharest, as well as other countries like China, Japan, India, Turkey and South American nations.|$|E
5|$|Crease {{was born}} at Ince Castle, in Cornwall, {{the son of a}} Royal Navy captain. He earned his BA from Clare College, Cambridge and then studied law at the Middle Temple. Though called to the bar in June 1849, he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>immediately</b> pursue his career in law. Instead he joined his parents in an {{unsuccessful}} canal building endeavour in Upper Canada. After only a short turn as a barrister on his return to England, he took a job in Cornwall managing a tin mine owned by Great Wheal Vor United Mines, which ended with his employer suing him.|$|E
5|$|He <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>immediately</b> {{join the}} Communist Party after the {{consolidation}} of the October Revolution, becoming a member only in 1941, a move atypical for a Soviet military officer. After the war, {{he served as a}} deputy member of the Supreme Soviets of the Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic and Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic and was a regular attendee of the Party Congresses. In 1952, he became a candidate for entry into the Central Committee and, in 1961, was inducted as a full member. For his contributions during the war, he was widely regarded as a national hero in the Soviet Union, and continues to hold such esteemed status among Armenians.|$|E
