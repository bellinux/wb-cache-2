40|$|While {{the simple}} {{centrifugal}} compressor {{has been widely}} used over a considerable {{period of time and}} in a variety of applications, in particular aircraft gas turbines and aero-engine superchargers, and its behaviour is therefore reasonably well understood, the <b>inward</b> radial <b>flow</b> gas <b>turbine</b> has only recently begun {{to attract the attention of}} engineers. As a result, its characteristics are not understood as fuIly as those of the centrifuga 1 compressor. <b>Inward</b> radial <b>flow</b> <b>turbines</b> have a number of attractive features, such as robustness, cheapness, and relative immunity from thermal stresses, which render them particularly suitable, where the mass throughput and overall pressure ratio are moderate. While the assessment of performance and flow conditions at the design point presents no very great difficulties, the evaluation of performance under conditions of reduced speed and pressure ratio, knowledge of which is essential in most applications, does not appear to have been attempted hitherto. An analytical treatment of part-load conditions is outlined in this paper. In addition, the influence of the various design parameters on the overall characteristics is examined, and tentative suggestions are made for the best combination of these parameters for particular applications.

40|$|Abstract: The Kaplan <b>turbine</b> is an <b>inward</b> <b>flow</b> {{reaction}} <b>turbine,</b> which means, {{working fluid}} changes pressure {{as it moves}} through turbine and change its energy. Power is recovered from kinetic energy of the flowing water. During this process stresses are built up among many parts of Kaplan turbine like guide vane, runner blade, screws, hub, shaft etc. However, wall thickness of hub is much bigger in size therefore stress analysis of hub is not necessary. The screws, pins etc. parts do not contribute much in weight & cost of turbine. Guide vanes are also show less stress parameters compared to runner blades. The runner blade design is the main factor for optimizing the Kaplan turbine design. Parameters which affect the runner blade optimization are material of blade, runner diameter, stress relive groove, thickness of blade. This paper investigates, static stresses, weight & cost of the blade and {{it was found that}} blade weight is reduced up to 500 Kg's and cost is reduced up to 4472 USD per blade.

40|$|This {{contribution}} aims {{to analyze}} micro-CHP units based on Rankine cycles. Two types of expander are considered: {{a small scale}} <b>inward</b> <b>flow</b> radial <b>turbine</b> and a volumetric scroll type expander. This latter, should allow to overcome the limitation imposed by a standard steam-turbine that arise when the required shaft-power is very low. Moreover, the scroll expander will also allow to easily treat wet steams, which must be avoided when considering a turbo-expander. The final aim is to deduce {{which one of the}} two types of expander is more suitable, with a specified target performance and the availability of a certain hot source. In order to define the thermodynamic expansion process, the analysis uses a onedimensional model of the radial turbine, previously developed by the authors, and of an estimation of the scroll expander efficiency. Also, the analysis is carried out for different working fluids, such as water, and two organic fluids, cyclohexane and toluene. Through the discussion of the results, for a specified set of constraints (e. g. expander inlet temperature, temperature of condensation, expander geometrical parameters) it is possible to deduce important indications on the most suitable expander for a given cycle layout...|$|R
40|$|Detailed {{measurements}} {{were taken in}} the nozzle of a low speed single stage axial <b>flow</b> <b>turbine</b> at two axial planes inside the nozzle and on the nozzle and endwall surfaces. Velocity, turbulence and angle {{measurements were}} taken at midchord with an LDV while a five hole probe {{was used to measure}} the pressure, velocities and angles just upstream of the trailing edge. Nozzle surface and endwall static pressures were also measured. These measurements were compared to measurements previously completed at two axial planes downstream of the nozzle. The results show that at midchord, the secondary flow seems to be weak and it is {{in the early stages of}} development. Just upstream of the trailing edge, the secondary flow is clearly visible. The radially <b>inward</b> <b>flow</b> near the suction surface augments the casing passage vortex, while counteracting the hub passage vortex. Traveling downstream, the casing passage vortex remains strong while at the hub, the radially <b>inward</b> <b>flow</b> of the suction surface boundary layer has reversed direction due to the rotating hub. The blade static pressures and the passage averaged velocities compare well with Katsanis' quasi-three-dimensional code.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is to {{establish}} the maximum theoretical efficiency that a viscous <b>flow</b> <b>turbine</b> (such as a Tesla turbine) can achieve. This {{is very much in}} the spirit of the Betz limit for wind turbines. The scaling down of viscous <b>flow</b> <b>turbines</b> is thought not to alter this result, whereas the scaling down of conventional turbines, whether axial or radial flow, results in an ever lowering of their efficiencies. A semiempirical scaling law is developed for conventional gas turbines using published machine performance data, which is fitted to a simple boundary layer model of turbine efficiency. An analytical model is developed for a viscous <b>flow</b> <b>turbine.</b> This is compared to experimental measurements of the efficiency of a Tesla turbine using compressed air. The semiempirical scaling law predicts that below a rotor diameter of between about 11 mm and 4 mm, a practical Brayton cycle is not possible. Despite that, however, and for rotor diameters less than between about 7 mm and 2 mm, a viscous <b>flow</b> <b>turbine,</b> compressor, or pump will be more efficient than a conventional design.

40|$|Due to {{increased}} demands for improved fuel economy of passenger cars, low-end and part-load performance is of key {{importance for the}} design of automotive turbocharger turbines. In an automotive drive cycle, a turbine which can extract more energy at high pressure ratios and lower rotational speeds is desirable. In the literature it is typically found that radial turbines provide peak efficiency at speed ratios of 0. 7, but at high pressure ratios and low rotational speeds the blade speed ratio will be low and the rotor will experience high values of positive incidence at the inlet. Based on fundamental considerations, it is shown that mixed <b>flow</b> <b>turbines</b> offer substantial advantages for such applications. Moreover, to prove these considerations an experimental assessment of mixed <b>flow</b> <b>turbine</b> efficiency and optimal blade speed ratio is presented. This has been achieved using a new semi-unsteady measurement approach. Finally, evidence of the benefits of mixed <b>flow</b> <b>turbine</b> behaviour in engine operation is given.
