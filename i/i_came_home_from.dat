2500|$|That {{was my last}} {{really good}} day. It wasn’t until <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> work that I knew the truth… Gina was still lying in the same position… Katrin was still quiet.|$|E
6000|$|K.--Would! {{that is a}} good one, mamma! Why, {{you made}} her! It's a dozen years ago. But I recollect, when <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> Eton, seeing her crying because Charley Tufton-- ...|$|E
60|$|Soon {{after we}} had made up our minds {{to move toward the}} south, <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> a visit to the bankers, and joyfully told Euphemia that I had met Baxter.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I wouldn't {{discourage}} {{either of}} you,' said her father; 'but I rather think, Tom, {{you had better}} let me write your letter for you. I'll do it when <b>I</b> <b>come</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> my ride.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I wouldn't {{discourage}} {{either of}} you," [...] said St. Clare, [...] "but I rather think, Tom, you'd better {{get me to}} write your letter for you. I'll do it, when <b>I</b> <b>come</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> my ride." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>home</b> once <b>from</b> Eton. But I won't {{go again}} till <b>I</b> can <b>come</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> Eton again." [...] Then he altered his tone as he {{continued}} to speak. [...] "People would look at me as if I were the wildest beast in the whole collection." ...|$|R
6000|$|I could never, igad, as <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> the tavern, meet a [...] {{watchman}} or so, but I presently asked him, 'Baron Tell-clock of the [...] night, pr'ythee how {{goes the}} time?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As {{you well}} know, <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> Canada {{to take care}} of him. Still, I agree with the executors. If you can still persuade Dick to believe in you, he must be saved in spite of himself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Probably I {{told you}} my father lived at Syracuse. I've been in New York ever since <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> Paris," [...] said Beaton, with the {{confusion}} {{of a man who}} feels himself played upon by a woman.|$|E
6000|$|... "So {{you like}} my daughter's singing," [...] said Mr. Neuchatel, coming up to them. [...] "She does not much like singing in public, but {{she is a very}} good girl, and always gives me a song when <b>I</b> <b>come</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> business." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I arrived--to where I am now--pretty dizzy," [...] he responded, with a {{smile that}} was both radiant and sorrowful. He took her hands and held them close. [...] "Lenore!... if <b>I</b> <b>come</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> the war--still with my arms and legs--whole--will you marry me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Dogs!' he answered, 'ye {{said that}} never should <b>I</b> <b>come</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> Troy; ye wasted my goods, and insulted my wife, {{and had no}} fear of the Gods, but now the day of death has come upon you! Fight or flee, if you may, but some shall not escape!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> school, {{to nurse}} my aunt. Ah, you {{remember}} now! Is it true--I ask you here, where your old mistress died--is {{it true that}} my aunt deceived me about my father's death? And that you knew it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Slowly {{enumerating}} {{the articles}} {{they came to}} the piano. Averil went up to it, leant fondly against it, and softly touched the keys. 'My own,' she said, 'bought for a surprise to me when <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> school! And oh, how he loved it!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> the {{hospital}} last night, at {{an hour when}} all respectable characters, except doctors and police, should be in their warm beds, I beheld a light in Norman's window, so methought I would see what Gravity was doing out of his bed at midnight--" ...|$|E
6000|$|When <b>I</b> <b>come</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> {{a concert}} or lecture, yearning to talk over the divine music or the {{wonderful}} new ideas with her, she will say, [...] "Yes, yes, {{but are you}} sure you didn't get your feet damp? Better go and change your stockings, my dear. 'An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.'" ...|$|R
5000|$|Shirley {{told the}} police that she never smelled any natural gas, but her {{daughter}} thought she did recently. [...] "She said, 'Mommy, it smells like gas in here, like in the laundry room'," [...] recalled Shirley of their conversation. [...] "She says, 'Every time <b>I</b> <b>come</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> school and we open the garage doors, I smell gas in there'." ...|$|R
40|$|Extract] <b>I</b> <b>come</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> {{school to}} find Dad {{knocking}} {{down one of}} the walls in the back bedroom. I say, Dad what are you doing? And he says, I can't work there (downstairs, he means, in his office), I need more space. I say- because we have this really bad relationship at the moment, I don't agree {{with a lot of the}} things he's doing, I'm being mean to him- I say, can't you just get rid of all that shit? And he says no...|$|R
6000|$|The {{cause of}} all this heat was Dr Barnardo's splendid meeting held {{recently}} in the Royal Albert Hall. <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> that meeting incandescent--throwing off sparks of enthusiasm, and eagerly clutching at every cold or lukewarm creature that came in my way {{with a view to}} expend on it some of my surplus heat! ...|$|E
60|$|November 20.--Wrought in {{the morning}} at the review, which I fear will be lengthy. Called on Hector as <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> the Court, and found him better, and keeping a Highland heart. I came home like a crow through the mist, half dead with a rheumatic {{headache}} caused by the beastly north-east wind.|$|E
60|$|I {{knew nothing}} of all this, but when <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> my own church, and went to my own sitting-room, I was startled to find Harold there, leaning over the table, with that {{miniature}} of little Percy, which, two months before, he had bidden me shut up, open before him, and the tears streaming down his face.|$|E
60|$|We {{have had}} bad weather enough here lately to most {{make up for}} the {{delightful}} weather we had for five weeks after <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>from</b> <b>home.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, <b>I</b> only <b>came</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> S-" [...] (she {{mentioned}} {{the name of}} a large town some twenty miles distant) [...] "this afternoon. Papa told me you had opened your school, and that the new mistress was come; and so I put on my bonnet after tea, and ran up the valley to see her: this is she?" [...] pointing to me.|$|R
6000|$|... "Who's been a-treatin' of 'em with levity?" [...] {{said the}} Captain. [...] "I'm sure I ain't. Mary Jane's good-lookin', and there's plenty of young fellows as {{sees it as}} well as me. I declare, she looked as pretty as any young gal when she ris up in the singers' seats to-day. Put me in mind of you, Polly, when <b>I</b> first <b>come</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> the Injies." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Stoutness and slimness {{seem to be}} {{matters of}} predestination," [...] said Anne. [...] "At all events, Mrs. Harmon Andrews can't say to you what {{she said to me}} when <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> Summerside, 'Well, Anne, you're just about as skinny as ever.' It sounds quite romantic to be 'slender,' but 'skinny' has a very {{different}} tang." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't quite know. In a {{month or}} so. Of course, I ought to be there now; {{but it is the}} first time I have been away since <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> Montreal, and it will {{probably}} be a long while before I take a rest again. As it is, my being away this harvest will probably cost me a good deal." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Anne," [...] {{she said}} to that small personage, who was {{shelling}} peas by the spotless table and singing, [...] "Nelly of the Hazel Dell" [...] with a vigor and expression that did credit to Diana's teaching, [...] "did you see anything of my amethyst brooch? I thought I stuck it in my pincushion when <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> church yesterday evening, but I can't find it anywhere." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It's all {{the same}} to me what trade I follow,' said the youth, 'for when <b>I</b> <b>came</b> away <b>from</b> <b>home</b> my father gave me leave to take to any trade I fancied.' ...|$|R
60|$|As I have retired, {{and live}} at my ease, I possess the means that I used to want, of {{considering}} what I have seen, at leisure. My experiences {{have a more}} remarkable aspect, so reviewed, than they had {{when they were in}} progress. <b>I</b> have <b>come</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> the Play now, and can recall the scenes of the Drama upon which the curtain has fallen, free from the glare, bewilderment, and bustle of the Theatre.|$|R
60|$|When <b>I</b> had <b>come</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> Caddy's {{while she}} was ill, I had often found Ada at work, and she had always put her work away, and I had never known what it was. Some of it now lay in a drawer near her, which was not quite closed. I did not open the drawer, but I still rather {{wondered}} what the work could be, for it was evidently nothing for herself.|$|R
60|$|As <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> the Court {{about twelve}} I {{stepped into the}} Exhibition. It makes a very good show; the portraits are better than last year, those of Colvin Smith and Watson Gordon {{especially}} improve. Landseer's Study at Abbotsford is in a capital light, and generally admired. I particularly distinguished John Thomson's picture of Turnberry, which is of first-rate excellence. A picture by Scrope was also generally distinguished. It is a view in Calabria.|$|E
60|$|My old acquaintance, Miss Elizabeth Clerk, {{sister of}} Willie, died suddenly. I cannot choose but wish {{it had been}} S.W.S., and yet the feeling is unmanly. I have Anne, my wife, and Charles to look after. I felt rather sneaking as <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> the Parliament House--felt as if I were liable monstrari digito in no very {{pleasant}} way. But this must be borne cum caeteris; and, thank God, however uncomfortable, I do not feel despondent.|$|E
60|$|This {{would not}} do, {{it was quite}} clear. I was flying too high, and should never get on, so. I resorted to Traddles for advice; who {{suggested}} that he should dictate speeches to me, at a pace, and with occasional stoppages, adapted to my weakness. Very grateful for this friendly aid, I accepted the proposal; and night after night, almost every night, for a long time, we {{had a sort of}} Private Parliament in Buckingham Street, after <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> the Doctor's.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{can afford}} it very well, sir. My aunt gave me a hundred pounds when <b>I</b> <b>came</b> away <b>from</b> <b>home,</b> and that will pay for it for one year. I am sure I shall like him." ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>I</b> have <b>come</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> tours {{absolutely}} dead on my {{feet and}} I will get a call to go and play at a local pub because their regular drummer can't do it and I say yes…When I am not playing I go to drum shops or music shows. I just love it. I feel so lucky {{to be able to}} be doing something I love to do and to be able to earn a living from it.|$|R
60|$|One sunny {{afternoon}} when <b>I</b> had <b>come</b> <b>home</b> <b>from</b> school with my books and portfolio, watching my long shadow at my side, and as I was gliding upstairs {{to my room}} as usual, my godmother looked out of the parlour-door and called me back. Sitting with her, I found--which was very unusual indeed--a stranger. A portly, important-looking gentleman, dressed all in black, with a white cravat, large gold watch seals, a pair of gold eye-glasses, and a large seal-ring upon his little finger.|$|R
