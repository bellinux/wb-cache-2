2500|$|Kim began skating {{at the age}} of 6. Her {{coach at}} the time, Ryu Jong-hyun, {{strongly}} suggested to Kim's mother that Kim should continue to skate, predicting that she would become a world-class figure skater in the future. In a 2011 interview, she gave credit to her coaches for noticing her aptness for skating, stating, [...] "My coaches have told me my muscles and body structure are perfect for skating. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>born</b> <b>with</b> a good instrument, maybe more so than the talent. I was lucky my coaches noticed early on and helped me develop that. A lot of people don't know they are born that way." ...|$|E

I should have fallen by Sebastian's side, My corps had been the bulwark of my king. His glorious end was a patched work of fate, Ill sorted with a soft effeminate life; It suited better with my life than his, So to have died: Mine had been of a piece, Spent in your service, dying at your feet.|$|R

50|$|CDA type <b>I</b> <b>is</b> {{characterized}} by {{moderate to severe}} anemia. It is usually diagnosed in childhood or adolescence, although in some cases, the condition can be detected before birth. Many affected individuals have yellowing of the skin and eyes (jaundice) and an enlarged liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly). This condition also causes the body to absorb too much iron, which builds up and can damage tissues and organs. In particular, iron overload can lead to an abnormal heart rhythm (arrhythmia), congestive heart failure, diabetes, and chronic liver disease (cirrhosis). Rarely, people <b>with</b> CDA type <b>I</b> <b>are</b> <b>born</b> <b>with</b> skeletal abnormalities, most often involving the fingers and/or toes.|$|R

I melted the last of my silver spoon--South Sea cotton, an' it please you, cacao in Tonga, rubber and mahogany in Yucatan. And do you know, at the end, I slept in Bowery lodging-houses and ate scrapple in East-Side feeding-dens, and, on more than one occasion, stood in the bread-line at midnight and pondered whether or not I should faint before I fed." ...|$|E

6000|$|My {{favorite}} place in winter time was {{directly under the}} kitchen stove.

60|$|III.

Its hopes and fears, therefore, refer me to a different and spiritual state of being: and I believe in the life to come, not through arguments acquired by my understanding or discursive faculty, but chiefly and effectively, because so to believe is my duty, and in obedience to the commands of my conscience.

After some minutes' reflection, he thus spoke: [...] "A few moments ago <b>I</b> <b>was</b> reading a book by a Greek sage; who was a Christian, by name Paul, whose words and acts please me exceedingly. One thing alone in him displeases me, namely, that, born under the Jewish law, he forsook the faith of his fathers to adopt a new one.
