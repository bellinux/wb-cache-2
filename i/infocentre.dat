In 1999 they acquired Winnebago Software, and that company's Spectrum library automation package, originally released in 1997 replacing Winnebago's earlier products CIRC/CAT and LCS dating back to 1982. The company later launched a product called <b>InfoCentre,</b> intended to replace both Athena and Spectrum.|$|E
40|$|The general aim of my diploma thesis was {{to create}} a {{business}} concept of facilities of hunting tourism in the Pilsner region. Klatovské rybářství, a. s. was selected as a cooperative company, which deals with agricultural activities, especially fish and poultry breeding. The company operates some services of hunting tourism, {{but it is not the}} main field. The thesis will serve as a manual for "non-experts" who are interested in expanding their range of travel services. The resulting business concept will consequently be presented to the management of the company in order to demonstrate how the company can further develop. While writing this thesis I got several perspectives on the issue of hunting tourism in the area. The first view was provided by the existing clients of the company who filled in questionnaires which were designed to determine their interest in these services. In addition, three representatives were selected from age groups who were asked for ideas about how the device should look. Another view was obtained through an interview with the director of the company and the employee responsible for the current planning and management of hunting activities. Next view on the issue of hunting tourism, which should be independent, was provided by an employee of <b>Infocentre</b> Bor. Here it was revealed that hunting tourism is not popular with everyone and that it is a rather controversial topic. However, we can say that if done correctly and with concern for the countryside, it can bring many benefits to the given region. These include attracting visitors of other segments of the society, the development of the region, expansion of tourism services and expansion of cooperation between entrepreneurs. Last view was represented by my own experience that I gained during working participation in hunting tourism events. At the beginning of my diploma thesis I determined three working hypotheses. All available resources helped me to evaluate the present circumstances and I can confirm all three hypotheses. The general aim {{was to create}} a business concept of facilities of hunting tourism in the Pilsner region. I was able to realize the general aim thanks to the cooperation with the company and by means of utilizing all available information. Now the diploma thesis will be handed over to the management for consideration and possible implementatio...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} a {{compilation}} of abstracts of MSc theses by ILRI graduate fellows during 2006 – 07. The International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI) is one of 15 future harvest centres, which conduct food and environmental research to help alleviate poverty and increase food security while protecting the natural resource base. Building on three decades of experience, ILRI works {{at the crossroads of}} livestock and poverty by bringing high quality science and capacity building to bear on poverty reduction and sustainable development. As part of its research-based outreach and capacity strengthening, ILRI assists its partners by offering opportunities for long- and short-term training for researchers and development practitioners. Capacity building is a core priority of ILRI because of the important role it plays in economic growth and development as well as addressing the rapid changes in the bio-physical, socio-cultural, technological and policy environments of the agricultural innovation systems in the developing as well as the developed world. ILRI offers individual and group training courses. Both are aimed at largely building the capacity of the individual. Individual training is focused on harnessing the skills and abilities of individuals to contribute to the realization of developmental goals, which may include improved livestock management systems and enhanced research outputs and outcomes. ILRI has five categories of individual trainees: Attachment Associates, Student Associates, Technical Associates, Research Fellows and Graduate Fellows. Graduate Fellows are mostly employees undertaking MSc and PhD studies. Postgraduate training is a priority activity of ILRI as it contributes significantly to the research agenda of ILRI and to the national and regional human resource pool in many regions of the world. This group of graduates will continue the research on emerging issues and will form the core of future collaborative research and innovation partners of ILRI. ILRI supports a number of Graduate Fellows every year. The outputs of their work would end up as thesis and various publications. Not every researcher, however, has access to these materials. The result of the research efforts of the Graduate Fellows have limited impact due to lack of wider circulation of their findings. This publication of the abstracts of the thesis work supported iv by ILRI as a compendium is one way {{to make sure that the}} results are widely distributed among the various research and development practitioners working within the livestock innovation system. The purpose is to make the R&D community to be aware of the research work completed and the key findings. If you need additional information, please contact ILRI’s <b>InfoCentre</b> directly where copies of these theses are deposited. We sincerely hope that this document will contribute positively in planning the future research activities and also will eliminate potential duplication of efforts...|$|E
