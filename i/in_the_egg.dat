5|$|The eggs hatch within between 23 and 32 {{hours of}} each other and can be preceded by the chick <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> calling for up to 45 hours before {{hatching}}. One hatching was recorded as taking 15 hours to complete. Newly hatched chicks are covered by downy black plumage, the legs, feet and bill are black, and the mouth is silvery.|$|E
5|$|The common cuckoo, a brood parasite, {{provides}} {{examples of}} mimesis {{both in the}} adult and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>egg.</b> The female lays her eggs in nests of other, smaller species of bird, one per nest. The female mimics a sparrowhawk. The resemblance is sufficient to make small birds take action to avoid the apparent predator. The female cuckoo then has time to lay her egg in their nest without being seen to do so. The cuckoo's egg itself mimics the eggs of the host species, reducing its chance of being rejected.|$|E
5|$|The {{social life}} of a crocodilian begins while it is still <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>egg,</b> because the young start {{communicating}} with each other before they are hatched. It {{has been shown that}} a light tapping noise near the nest will be repeated by the young, one after another. Such early communication may help them to hatch simultaneously. Once it has broken out of the egg, a juvenile produces yelps and grunts, either spontaneously or as a result of external stimuli and even unrelated adults respond quickly to juvenile distress calls.|$|E
50|$|Despite their reduced nervous systems, adult wasps {{retain the}} ability to fly, to feed, and to locate hosts in which to lay their <b>eggs.</b> <b>The</b> wasp <b>eggs</b> are {{deposited}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eggs</b> of thrips.

5|$|Caterpillars have short {{antennae}} {{and several}} simple eyes. The mouthparts are adapted for chewing with powerful mandibles {{and a pair}} maxillae, each with a segmented palp. Adjoining these is the labium-hypopharynx which houses a tubular spinneret which is able to extrude silk. Butterfly caterpillars have three pairs of true legs on the thoracic segments and up to six pairs of prolegs arising from the abdominal segments. These prolegs have rings of tiny hooks called crochets that are engaged hydrostatically and help the caterpillar grip the substrate. The epidermis bears tufts of setae, the position and number of which help in identifying the species. There is also decoration {{in the form of}} hairs, wart-like protuberances, horn-like protuberances and spines. Internally, most of the body cavity is taken up by the gut, but there may also be large silk glands, and special glands which secrete distasteful or toxic substances. The developing wings are present in later stage instars and the gonads start development <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> stage.|$|E
5|$|Larvae of Sirex {{woodwasp}} develop through arrhenotoky: male larvae develop {{only from}} unfertilized eggs, the females only from fertilized ones. Usually, 10 males are produced per female, but the ratio varies between 20:1 and 1:1. The larvae hatch after eight {{days at the}} earliest, but in some exterior conditions, they may remain <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> for several months. At the optimal temperature of around 25°C (77°F), they hatch out after 10 to 12 days. Although the larvae hatch at 30°C (86°F) {{two to three days}} earlier, they are 20% more likely to die. Such extreme temperatures result in slower development, and below 6.2°C (43°F), the larvae die. A sufficient interspersion of the wood with the mycelium of the woodwasp is crucial for its hatching, as the fungus prevents the wood from drying out. Without these prerequisites, hatching is not possible. The tree can only ward off the infestation if it floods the boreholes with resin or halts the fungus by producing a wall of polyphenols.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin of}} the jockey {{creature}} was not explored in the film, but Scott later theorized {{that it might have}} been the ship's pilot, and that the ship might have been a weapons-carrier capable of dropping alien eggs onto a planet so that the aliens could use the local lifeforms as hosts. In early versions of the script, the eggs were to be located in a separate pyramid structure which would be found later by the Nostromo crew and would contain statues and hieroglyphs depicting the alien reproductive cycle, contrasting the human, alien, and space jockey cultures. Cobb, Foss, and Giger each created concept artwork for these sequences, but they were eventually discarded due to budgetary concerns and the need to make the film shorter. Instead, the egg chamber was set inside the derelict ship and was filmed on the same set as the space-jockey scene; the entire disc piece supporting the jockey and its chair were removed and the set was re-dressed to create the egg chamber. Light effects <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> chamber were created by lasers borrowed from English rock band The Who. The band was testing the lasers for use in their stage show on the sound-stage next door.|$|E

5|$|Misery banishes {{the player}} to the Labyrinth {{deep inside the}} island as {{punishment}} for interfering with the Doctor's plans. Curly Brace has also been thrown into the Labyrinth and they cooperate to escape. Balrog helps them to move the boulder blocking the exit, revealing his kind nature. The pair find and defeat the Core, a magical creature whose power keeps the island afloat. However, the Doctor steps in to save it before the island collapses. Depending on certain conditions, the player may rescue Curly Brace, who had sacrificed her air tank to save the player character. When he returns to Mimiga Village, he finds that the Doctor has captured the Mimigas. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>Egg</b> Corridor, Kazuma offers the player a choice to escape the island with him using a Sky Dragon, leading to an alternate ending in which the Doctor conquers the surface world while Kazuma and the player hide in the mountains. The player may instead choose to confront the Doctor and destroy the island's Core, which would return the Mimigas to normal. The player scales the outer wall of the island to reach the Plantation where the Doctor is using the Mimigas as slave laborers to grow red flowers. The Doctor's servants capture the player and place him in a jail cell with Sue. She is taken away before the player wakes up, but her letter reveals that the Doctor {{was a member of}} the research expedition that included Sue's family and Professor Booster, but he betrayed them once he found the Demon Crown. Sue directs the player to find her mother who may have a plan to stop the Doctor.|$|E
5|$|Some frogs {{protect their}} {{offspring}} inside their own bodies. Both {{male and female}} pouched frogs (Assa darlingtoni) guard their eggs, which are laid on the ground. When the eggs hatch, the male lubricates his body with the jelly surrounding them and immerses himself <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> mass. The tadpoles wriggle into skin pouches on his side, where they develop until they metamorphose into juvenile frogs. The female gastric-brooding frog (Rheobatrachus sp.) from Australia, now probably extinct, swallows her fertilized eggs, which then develop inside her stomach. She ceases to feed and stops secreting stomach acid. The tadpoles rely on the yolks of the eggs for nourishment. After six or seven weeks, they are ready for metamorphosis. The mother regurgitates the tiny frogs, which hop away from her mouth. The female Darwin's frog (Rhinoderma darwinii) from Chile lays up to 40 eggs on the ground, where they are guarded by the male. When the tadpoles are about to hatch, they are engulfed by the male, which carries them around inside his much-enlarged vocal sac. Here they are immersed in a frothy, viscous liquid that contains some nourishment to supplement what they obtain from the yolks of the eggs. They remain in the sac for seven to ten weeks before undergoing metamorphosis, after which they move into the male's mouth and emerge.|$|E

25|$|The Yoreh De'ah {{argues that}} if there is blood <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> yolk, then {{hatching}} must have begun, and therefore consumption of the egg would be forbidden. Modern Orthodox Jews adhere to these requirements; however, the Ashkenazi Orthodox Jews treat an egg as nonkosher if blood is found anywhere within it. Sephardi Orthodox Jews consider only blood in the yolk to be a problem, and treat eggs with blood in the albumen as legitimate food if the blood is removed before use.|$|E
40|$|A {{comparative}} study {{was made of}} the isolation of <b>the</b> cortex <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eggs</b> of several sea urchin species. Since the isolation method developed by Sakai depends on the presence of magnesium <b>in</b> <b>the</b> medium, the protein composition of the cortex was investigated to determine whether the protein component of <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> described by Kane and Hersh which is gelled by divalent ions, is present in these cortices. Isolation of the cortex was found to require the same divalent ions at the same concentrations as protein gelation, and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eggs</b> of some species much of the gel protein of the cell was found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> isolated cortical material. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>eggs</b> of other species a smaller fraction of this protein was found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> isolated cortex, although it was more concentrated there than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> endoplasm, and <b>in</b> one species this protein appeared to be uniformly distributed throughout the cell. These results indicate that this protein is localized <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cortical region of <b>the</b> <b>eggs</b> of some species of sea urchin, possibly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cortical granules, but also point up the fact that results from one species cannot be uncritically extrapolated to others...|$|R

25|$|Apart {{from the}} prawns of the {{suborder}} Dendrobranchiata, all decapod crustaceans brood their eggs on the female's pleopods.
