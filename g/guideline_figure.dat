40|$|The Yorkshire and Humber Regional Assembly and the Yorkshire and the Humber Regional Aggregates Working Party (RAWP) {{are seeking}} {{assistance}} in analysing the likely {{environmental impacts of}} meeting additional sand and gravel extraction {{and the ability of}} aggregate producing areas in the region to absorb such impacts. Although the region has adequate permitted reserves to meet the crushed rock <b>guideline</b> <b>figure</b> to 2016, a sand and gravel shortfall is anticipated, in particular, concreting aggregate. The Yorkshire and Humber Assembly commissioned the British Geological Survey to carry out a study to identify the broad areas of sand and gravel resources in the region and to further identify potentially suitable resources for use in the concrete products industry. In addition, information on the environmental and cultural assets and planning considerations associated with these areas was requested. The project was carried out in three key stages. This report describes the methodology employed at each stage. The first stage of the study was concerned with resource identification, both the broad distribution of sand and gravel resources and those resources potentially suitable for concreting aggregate. The sand and gravel resources of the region can be broadly subdivided into river sand and gravel, sub-alluvial deposits, glaciofluvial deposits, glaciolacustrine deposits, blown sand, head gravel and beach sand and gravel. Of these, river sand and gravel, glaciofluvial deposits and sub-alluvial deposits have the greatest potential for use as concreting aggregate. These resources were, in turn, divided into inferred and indicated resources, reflecting differing degrees of geological assurance. It {{is important to note that}} the economic potential of specific sites can only be proved by a detailed evaluation programme. The second stage of the study identified the environmental and cultural assets and other features relevant to planning in the region. The identification of assets and planning features was undertaken in consultation with the Assembly. Only those assets available digitally were incorporated. The final stage of the study integrated the identified environmental and cultural assets into a composite assets layer termed an ‘environmental sensitivity layer’. This layer depicts areas of higher or lower sensitivity based on the number of environmental or cultural assets at a given location. Higher sensitivity does not necessarily mean an area will be unsuitable for aggregates development, just that there may be more to consider and more stakeholders to consult. The data compiled in all three stages of this study will provide essential baseline information for the next steps of the ODPM ‘Good Practice Guidance on the Environmental Appraisal of the Provision of Aggregates’ (ODPM, 2004). The guidance is a two stage, 10 step process and is an aid to decision makers evaluating various supply scenarios for aggregates at the strategic scale. The data from this project will provide a useful reference in any scenario testing of future aggregates provision as required by the ODPM guidance...|$|E

40|$|Background: mild {{cognitive}} impairment (MCI) is proposed to describe the transitional stage between normal cognitive aging and dementia. It has had significant impact {{in the field of}} dementia research, but it remains controversial whether or not it should be used as a diagnostic category in clinical practice. Methods: semi-structured interviews were carried out with international experts (N = 37) in the field of dementia research and practice. These interviews explored the advantages and difficulties of using MCI as a clinical diagnosis. Results: there is wide variation in the clinical use of MCI. This variation depends on institutional factors and two types of cultural factors: (a) clinical culture, and (b) the “evidential culture” – how research and <b>guidelines</b> <b>figure</b> in clinical practice.

40|$|The {{relatively}} low concentration of pathogen indicators, such Salmonella, in composting sometimes causes {{a problem with}} detection when using the conventional techniques. The presence of viable but non-culturable (VBNC) organisms is also a potential problem with Salmonella detection when using conventional techniques. In this study, the molecular approach for organism recognition, known as Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), was used for characterisation the Salmonella spp. used as inoculums in composting. This study also provides a better understand about selecting the suitable primer for Salmonella spp. The specificity of the probes and primers at the species level were verified by performing NCBI-BLAST 2 (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool). Primers that target the invA gene for Salmonella were selected which produce fragment lengths around 285 bp (shown in Figure 1). The Salmonella spp. solutions were tested and proved contained the sequences of invA gene by using several steps of molecular techniques before used it as inoculums in composting. The laboratory scale batch composting reactors were {{used to examine the}} inactivation of Salmonella spp. The inoculate solution of Salmonella was prepared by culturing Salmonella enteritidis (ATCC 13076) in tryptone broth solution for 24 hours before adding it directly into the compost material. The reduction rate of Salmonella spp. was enumerated by conventional method accordingly to the standard compost <b>guidelines</b> (<b>Figure</b> 2).

40|$|To {{compare the}} impact of three major {{guidelines}} {{for the prevention of}} cardiovascular disease (CVD). 21, 263 men and women aged 39 - 79 years from the EPIC (European Prospective Investigation of Cancer) Norfolk cohort were retrospectively classified at baseline by statin therapy recommendations according to the NICE, ESC and ATPIII CVD prevention guidelines. Recommendations based on baseline data were related to 10 -year follow-up to calculate number of new CVD events that could be prevented by statins, number-needed-to-treat (NNT) and CVD incidence decrease. Statin therapy was recommended to 34 % by the NICE guideline, 29 % by ESC and 32 % by ATPIII. A total of 263 events could potentially have been prevented by application of the NICE guideline, 219 by ESC and 199 by ATPIII. The NNT with statins over 10 years was 27 with the NICE guideline, 28 with ESC and 34 with ATPIII. Application of the NICE guideline could have decreased CVD incidence by 13 %; using ESC <b>guidelines</b> the <b>figure</b> is 11 % and with ATPIII it is 10 %. The NICE guideline selected greater percentages of elderly and subjects with prevalent CVD risk factors.

40|$|We derive a set {{of design}} <b>guidelines</b> and a <b>figure</b> of merit to aid the {{engineering}} process of on-chip waveguides for strong Stimulated Brillouin Scattering (SBS). To this end, we {{examine the impact of}} several types of loss on the total amplification of the Stokes wave that can be achieved via SBS. We account for linear loss and nonlinear loss of third order (two-photon absorption, 2 PA) and fifth order, most notably 2 PA-induced free carrier absorption (FCA). From this, we derive an upper bound for the output power of continuous-wave Brillouin-lasers and show that the optimal operating conditions and maximal realisable Stokes amplification of any given waveguide structure are determined by a dimensionless parameter ℱ involving the SBS-gain and all loss parameters. We provide simple expressions for optimal pump power, waveguide length and realisable amplification and demonstrate their utility in two example systems. Notably, we find that 2 PA-induced FCA is a serious limitation to SBS in silicon and germanium for wavelengths shorter than 2200 nm and 3600 nm, respectively. In contrast, three-photon absorption is of no practical significance. 11 page(s...|$|R
30|$|The {{participants}} in this study represent a one large private services organisation. To prevent contamination, care was taken to select two isolated regional worksites. The groups did however differ in gender and average working hours at T 0. Therefore, the study groups may not have been counterfactual. Given the absence of a RCT design and these differences between the groups, the results may have been confounded and caution should be applied when interpreting these findings. Although CTG was successful at recruiting female participants, only 29 % of the intervention group were female. While this figure is proportionate to the number of females who work in the organisation (30 % reported in 2016 annual report), researchers still may wish to understand why less female employees participate in team sport with their colleagues. Likewise, 89 % of intervention group and 85 % of control group participants reported meeting PA <b>guidelines</b> [1]. This <b>figure</b> is higher than the national average for working-age adults (67 % of males, 55 % of females). This may suggest workplace team sport attracts primarily active employees, rather inactive employees at risk of non-communicable illnesses and diseases. Future research may consider investigating the impact of workplace team sport with inactive employees.|$|R

40|$|Alarm systems play a {{vital role}} in {{maintaining}} the safe operation in process plant. Moreover, the safety and efficiency of a plant's operation is assured by the usage of a reliable and user friendly alarm system. In this project, the main objective is to introduce an alarm feature inside the SCADA system. Identification of suitable guidelines in designing a good alarm system display is also part of the project's objective. Introduction of alarm feature inside the SCADA system is done by putting the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system to Assembly Cell- 200 Trainer. Here, the SCADA system is equipped with an alarm system as the mean to monitor and control the trainer. The alarm design adopts the available alarm system <b>guidelines</b> as to <b>figure</b> out and judge the most suitable guidelines to be applied in this project. This exercise proves that general guidelines (e. g., use of an alarm philosophy) are essential in developing this projects. However, detailed guidelines (e. g., colour coding and symbol features) should be used more carefully and consistent to ensure the creation of understandable and recognizable display. From this project, a properly designed alarm system is developed, which provides the operators with enough information to prevent any abnormalities, fault conditions or undesired errors in the plant.

40|$|Retired {{sheep farmer}} Eugene Wright from Homer, NY, tells how he started using plastic bale wrap in 1990 and saved the waste plastic from then until {{he retired in}} 2007, hoping that a {{recycling}} option would emerge. He did this on his own initiative, without encouragement from recycling markets (there were none) and without Best Management Guidelines for how to prepare plastic to be recycled. Such <b>guidelines</b> were not <b>figured</b> out until later. By the time the Recycling Agricultural Plastics Program gained steam and found a processor {{who was willing to}} recycle the plastic to make sidewalk pavers, Gene had amassed more than 60, 000 pounds. But it wasn't all plastic: The top layers were washed clean by rain and looked sparkly white, but over time debris that adhered to the old bale wrap had mixed with the weeds growing through the piles and with the mud at the base. It was a mess and we never did find out how much of the 60, 000 + pounds was polyethylene plastic and how much was what is called 'contamination' in recycling circles. Blake Putman began the job of baling the jumble of plastic and Nate Leonard completed it in 2011 with help from Gene and friends.

Future studies will continue to pursue varying goals and utilize techniques that cannot be known in advance. Primary goals for the EMF Measurements Database developed under the Department of Energy EMF RAPID Program are to develop a database structure that can accommodate the diversity of EMF data sets, provide guidance for production of future EMF data sets, and serve as an accessible repository of EMF measurement data. Specific objectives of the EMF Measurements Database are: o to preserve study descriptions, results and data; o to provide readily accessible, well-documented data; and o to facilitate communication among researchers. In addition, the EMF Measurements Database will encourage additional analysis of existing data sets, facilitate analysis of data from multiple projects, support design of new studies, and permit future issues in EMF exposure assessment to be addressed with existing data. Preservation of study descriptions and data is accomplished with a formal, but open, structure. Specifications {{have been developed for}} the various elements of the database. Each data set in the database is formally described by a metadata file. The structured metadata file describes the origin, development, logical and physical structure and distribution mechanism for each data set. The metadata for each data set is generated according to a specification developed for the EMF Measurements Database. The actual measurement data is contained in data Products for each data set.
