40|$|The {{provisions}} of SFAS No. 109 allow U. S. companies {{to make an}} earnings big bath even bigger through {{the establishment of a}} deferred tax valuation allowance. At the time a firm recognizes a non-cash charge, it also recognizes a <b>deferred</b> <b>tax</b> <b>asset</b> to represent the future tax benefits of the charge. Recognition of the <b>deferred</b> <b>tax</b> <b>asset</b> partially mitigates the negative earnings impact of the special charge. However, if the firm does not expect to have sufficient future taxable income to utilize the future tax benefits of the charge, SFAS No. 109 requires the firm to establish a deferred tax valuation allowance, effectively eliminating the recognized <b>deferred</b> <b>tax</b> <b>asset.</b> Thus, the establishment of the valuation allowance amplifies the negative earnings impact of the non-cash charge. We use a valuation allowance prediction model to identify firms that create a larger-than-expected valuation allowance; these firms may be creating a large valuation allowance as a reserve to be used to manage earnings in a subsequent period.
