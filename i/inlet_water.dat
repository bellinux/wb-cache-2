50|$|The {{high water}} level (hydraulic head) in the inlet {{reservoir}} zone pushes the water through the diffuser and filter, then decreases as water flows evenly through the sand. The flow rate slows because there is less pressure to force the water through the filter. The <b>inlet</b> <b>water</b> contains dissolved oxygen, nutrients and contaminants. It provides the oxygen required by the microorganisms in the biofilm. Large suspended particles and pathogens are trapped {{in the top of}} the sand and partially plug the pore spaces between the sand grains. This causes the flow rate to decrease.|$|E
50|$|Combustible gas, {{mixed with}} air, is {{supplied}} into the combustion chamber and then fired by an electric spark. The {{force of the}} expanding gas drives water downwards from the combustion chamber and accelerates it along the delivery pipe. Once the chamber pressure drops {{to that of the}} <b>inlet</b> <b>water,</b> the delivered water is no longer being accelerated but the large mass of water in the long pipe continues to flow by its own inertia. This reduces the pressure in the chamber below atmospheric, which causes the inlet air and gas valves to open, drawing in fresh air as a scavenging effect. As the water begins to flow back down the U, this increases the chamber pressure and causes the exhaust valves to open.|$|E
50|$|Smaller sand grains {{provide more}} surface area and {{therefore}} a higher decontamination of the <b>inlet</b> <b>water,</b> but it also requires more pumping energy to drive the fluid through the bed. A compromise is that most rapid pressure sand bed filters use grains in the range 0.6 to 1.2 mm although for specialist applications other sizes may be specified. Larger feed particles (>100 micrometres) will tend to block the pores {{of the bed and}} turn it into a surface filter that blinds rapidly. Larger sand grains can be used to overcome this problem, but if significant amounts of large solids are in the feed they need to be removed upstream of the sand bed filter by a process such as settling.|$|E

However, the existence of fungi in the these systems requires more attention. During dental treatment, direct contact with water contaminated with fungi such as Candida, Aspergillus, or inhalation of aerosols from high-speed drill may cause various respiratory infections, such as asthma, allergies, and wounds on mucose membranes, especially on immunocompromised patients and dentists. The aims of this study are to investigate the number and colonization of fungi in DUWLs in the city of Istanbul, Turkey. Water samples were collected from air-water syringes, high-speed drills, and <b>inlet</b> <b>waters</b> from 41 DUs.

5000|$|Tankless {{water heaters}} {{can be further}} divided into two {{categories}} according to their heating capability: [...] "full on/full off" [...] versus [...] "modulated". Full on/full off units {{do not have a}} variable power output level; the unit is either fully on or completely off. This can cause an annoying and possibly hazardous variation of hot water temperature as the flow of water through the heater varies. Modulated tankless water heaters change their heat output in response to the flow rate of water running through the unit. This is usually done by using a flow sensor, a modulating gas valve, an <b>inlet</b> <b>water</b> temperature sensor, and an outlet water temperature sensor-choke valve. A properly configured modulating heater can supply the same output temperature of water at differing water flow rates within their rated capacity, usually maintaining a close range of ±2 °C.|$|E
50|$|When {{the plant}} is {{operating}} in steady state, feed water at the cold inlet temperature flows, or is pumped, through the heat exchangers in the stages and warms up. When it reaches the brine heater it already has nearly the maximum temperature. In the heater, an amount of additional heat is added. After the heater, the water flows through valves back into the stages that have ever lower pressure and temperature. As it flows back through the stages the water is now called brine, to distinguish it from the <b>inlet</b> <b>water.</b> In each stage, as the brine enters, its temperature is above the boiling point at {{the pressure of the}} stage, and {{a small fraction of the}} brine water boils ("flashes") to steam thereby reducing the temperature until an equilibrium is reached. The resulting steam is a little hotter than the feed water in the heat exchanger. The steam cools and condenses against the heat exchanger tubes, thereby heating the feed water as described earlier.|$|E

50|$|The river now curves {{northwest}} {{through the}} village towards Thorpe common. The Manor House on Thorpe common has a moat all around supplied with water from the river. Further on the river passes under the route of a dismantled railway. From here the river widens a little and flows into the mill pond at Burnham Overy. Burnham Overy Union mill {{is one of only}} two mills in Norfolk to use both water and wind power from the same site. The watermill section had 3 pairs of stones, and the windmill had a further 2 pairs. Both mills were built in 1737, being constructed of brick, the watermill having two storeys under a Norfolk pan tiled roof, with a third storey being added later. The windmill was originally built with five floors, but a sixth was subsequently added. In 1825 the sails had copper vanes.Just a very short distance on the river reaches a second watermill. The lower mill at Burnham Overy is the second of two watermills on the river Burn.

5000|$|As {{the turbine}} or {{propeller}} turns, mechanical energy {{is transferred to}} the water due to turbulence and friction. The shock caused by the acceleration of the water as it passes from pockets in the stator to the pockets in the spinning rotor requires energy. That energy heats the water due to the friction as the water moves through the water brake. Almost all of the horsepower of the system turning the rotor (usually an internal combustion engine) is converted into a temperature change of the water. A very small amount of energy is taken by the bearings and seals within the unit. Therefore, water must constantly move through the device at a rate proportional to the horse power that is being absorbed. Water temperature exiting the unit must be kept under 120-160F (50-70 °C) to prevent scale formation and cavitation. The water enters {{in the center of}} the device and after passing through the pockets in the stator and rotor exits the outside of the housing though a controlled orifice. The amount of loading is dependent on the level of water inside the housing. Some water brakes vary the load by controlling the <b>inlet</b> <b>water</b> volume only and have a set outlet orifice size depending on the desired hp to be absorbed and some control both input and output orifices at the same time which allows greater control over outlet water temperatures. The housing is vented to the outside to allow air to displace the water as the water level in the unit rises and falls. [...] The amount of torque that can be absorbed is defined by the equation T=kN2D5 where T = torque, N = RPM, D = the diameter of the rotor and k = a constant dependent on the size and shape and angle of the rotor/stator pockets.|$|E
50|$|Aleksandr Akimov, {{the unit}} shift chief, {{was in charge}} of the test itself. He took over the shift at midnight from Tregub, who stayed on-site. The drop in reactor power from 1500 MWt to 30 MWt was disconcerting; he wanted to abort the test. He {{supported}} Toptunov's decision to shut down the poisoned reactor, but was over-ridden by Dyatlov and forced to continue. At 1:23:04 am the test began, and the main circulation pumps started cavitating due to the too high temperature of <b>inlet</b> <b>water.</b> The coolant started boiling in the reactor, and the reactor power slowly increased. Toptunov reported a power excursion to Akimov. At 1:23:40, Akimov pressed the AZ-5 button, class-5 emergency. The control rods, according to the synchro indicators, seized at a depth of between 2 and 2.5 meters instead of the entire core depth of 7 meters. Akimov disconnected the clutches of the control rod servos to let the rods descend into the core by their own weight, but the rods did not move. The reactor was now making rumbling noises. Akimov was confused. The reactor control panel indicated no water flow and failure of pumps. The explosion occurred, the air filled with dust, power went out, and only battery-powered emergency lights stayed in operation. Perevozchenko ran into the control room, reporting the collapse of the reactor top. Brazhnik ran in from the turbine hall, reporting fire there. Brazhki, Akimov, Davletbayev, and Palamarchuk ran into the turbine hall, having seen scattered debris and multiple fires on Levels 0 and +12. Akimov called the fire station and the chiefs of electrical and other departments, asking for electrical power for coolant pumps, removal of hydrogen from hydrogen generators, and other emergency procedures to stabilize the plant and contain the damage. Internal telephone lines were disabled; Akimov sent Palamarchuk to contact Gorbachenko. Kudryavtsev and Proskuryakov returned from the reactor and reported its state to Akimov and Dyatlov. Insisting the reactor was intact, Akimov ordered Stolyarchuk and Busygin to turn on the emergency feedwater pumps. Davletbayev reported loss of electrical power, torn cables, and electric arcs. Akimov sent Metlenko to help in the turbine hall with manual opening of the cooling system valves, which was expected to take at least four hours per valve. Perevozchenko returned and reported that the reactor was destroyed, but Akimov insisted it was intact. At 3:30 am, Telyatnikov contacted Akimov, asking what was happening to his firemen; Akimov sent him a dosimetrist. Akimov, already nauseous, was replaced at 6:00 am by the unit chief Vladimir Alekseyevich Babychev, but together with Toptunov stayed in the plant. Believing the water flow to the reactor to be blocked by a closed valve somewhere, they went to the half-destroyed feedwater room on Level +24. Together with Nekhayev, Orlov, and Uskov, they opened the valves on the two feedwater lines, then climbed over to Level +27 and almost knee-deep in a mixture of fuel and water, opened two valves on the 300 line; due to advancing radiation poisoning caused by a dose of over 15 Grays (4 being the LD50), they did not have the strength to open the valves on the sides. Akimov and Toptunov spent several hours turning valves; the radioactive water in Room 712 was half submerging the pipeline. Smagin went in to open the third valves, spent 20 minutes in the room, and received 280 rads. Akimov was evacuated to the hospital. Until his death, he insisted he had done everything correctly and had made no mistakes.|$|E

Adsorption cooling systems powered by solar energy or waste heat have drawn increasing attention, as such systems need neither CFCs nor HCFCs as the working fluid and neither fossil fuel nor electricity to drive them. Composite adsorbents were synthesized from activated carbon, silica-gel and CaCl 2. The optimized condition for adsorption cooling systems was obtained when raw activated carbon was impregnated by soaking in 10 wt. % sodium silicate solution for 48 hours and then in 30 wt. % CaCl 2 solution for 48 hours. A 0. 805 kg kg- 1 of difference in equilibrium water uptake between 25 °C and 115 °C was recorded at atmospheric pressure. Besides, an adsorption rate test unit was built to study the adsorption isotherms and adsorption rates in which 0. 23 kg kg- 1 of adsorption capacity was recorded at 27 °C with a water vapor pressure of 900 Pa. The performance of a waste heat driven adsorption chiller by applying the novel composite adsorbent (silica activated carbon/CaCl 2) was also studied.

Results: Wrist/palm area warming significantly increased finger temperature (Tfing) and blood perfusion in Stage 3 compared to Stage 2. The LCW gloves were most effective in increasing Stage 3 Tfing in Condition 1; and in increasing blood perfusion in Conditions 1 and 2 compared to Condition 3. Ratings of subjective perception of heat in the hand and overall body heat were higher at Stage 3 than Stage 2, with no significant differences across Conditions. Conclusions: Local wrist/palm warming was effective in increasing blood circulation to the distal extremities, suggesting the potential usefulness of this technique for increasing astronaut thermal comfort during EVA while decreasing power requirements.
