5|$|I reckon {{it really}} sums up just what I felt {{as far as}} the {{competition}} goes. It's a very overwhelming process to go through and you really do feel that there's something else that got you there. Especially with how I didn't feel confident before and then something just clicked and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>look</b> people in the eyes and really try and deliver a song.|$|E
25|$|Meantime, I {{had found}} me {{quarters}} in Villiers Street, Strand, which forty-six {{years ago was}} primitive and passionate in its habits and population. My rooms were small, not over-clean or well-kept, but from my desk <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>look</b> out of my window through the fanlight of Gatti's Music-Hall entrance, across the street, almost on to its stage. The Charing Cross trains rumbled through my dreams on one side, the boom of the Strand on the other, while, before my windows, Father Thames under the Shot tower {{walked up and down}} with his traffic.|$|E
500|$|For {{the role}} Craig {{trained to be}} less bulky than in Casino Royale and told Men's Fitness {{magazine}} [...] "In fact, I was much fitter for this film compared to Casino Royale — I really had to be — and I was running {{a hell of a}} lot more in training, just so I could do these scenes, whereas last time I spent far more time pumping heavy weights to bulk up so <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>look</b> big." ...|$|E
6000|$|Being {{forced to}} an explanation, I {{described}} the scene {{by the river}} as best <b>I</b> <b>could,</b> <b>looking</b> at the sergeant a trifle defiantly until, at the conclusion, he said: [...] "I cannot compliment ye, Rancher Ormesby." ...|$|R
60|$|I was up {{with the}} dull dawn, and, having dressed as quietly as <b>I</b> <b>could,</b> <b>looked</b> into his room. He was fast asleep; lying, easily, with his head upon his arm, as I had often seen him lie at school.|$|R
60|$|I was dumbfounded. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> only <b>look</b> at Stroeve in stupid amazement.|$|R
500|$|Hopley {{was sentenced}} to four years of penal {{servitude}} at Millbank Prison. After being indicted, he wrote: [...] "while anguish shook the frame, the conscience suffered not one pang. I searched and searched among the deepest secrets of my soul, and could not blame myself... <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>look</b> up tranquilly {{into the face of}} heaven who knew me to be Not Guilty." [...] He believed that his actions were justifiable because he had undertaken them in his duty as schoolteacher. He portrayed himself as a victim of public opinion, claiming that [...] "a mournful accident was swelled up into a bloody midnight murder, and how it has been brought about that my unfortunate name has been branded, not simply through the United Kingdom, but through the civilised world, {{as one of the most}} execrable monsters or of madmen." [...] He published a pamphlet arguing that Locock had perjured himself and had conspired with Fowler to influence the outcome of the trial.|$|E
2500|$|Her {{characters}} were often {{drawn from the}} inner city life that Brooks knew well. She said, [...] "I {{lived in a small}} second-floor apartment at the corner, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>look</b> first on one side and then the other. There was my material." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Wainwright, Poses grew thematically out of {{its title}} track, which was {{inspired}} by his residency at New York City's infamous Chelsea Hotel. Referring to his stay there, he recalled: [...] "I went to all these parties and met all these people and found that, basically, it's like a big revolving door. I thought if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>look</b> {{at it as a}} series of poses and extract from it what I needed for my songs, then I would survive." [...] Describing his writing process, Wainwright stated he typically comes up with a melody line and starts singing phonetically, from which words often appear. To promote the album prior to its release, Wainwright embarked on a tour throughout the United States and Canada.|$|E
60|$|I {{started to}} my feet. I tried to speak. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> only <b>look</b> at him.|$|R
60|$|Still <b>I</b> <b>could</b> neither speak nor move. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> only <b>look</b> {{away from}} him in horror, and fix {{my eyes on the}} ground.|$|R
60|$|I {{gave him}} my hand. After a moment of suspense, I went and kissed my mother: she kissed me, patted me gently on the shoulder, and sat down again to her work. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>look</b> at her, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>look</b> at him, I knew quite well {{that he was looking}} at us both; and I turned to the window and looked out there, at some shrubs that were {{drooping}} their heads in the cold.|$|R
2500|$|Loos, Emerson {{and fellow}} writer Frances Marion {{migrated}} to New York as a group, Loos and Emerson sharing a leased mansion in Great Neck, Long Island. Loos desperately wanted Marion as chaperone, as {{she found herself}} attracted to Emerson. He would readily admit that he [...] "had never been, nor could be, faithful to any one female." [...] Loos convinced herself that he would {{see that she was}} different from all his other girls, and that behind his outwardly dull exterior was a great mind. She would be wrong on both counts. She would later write: [...] "I had set my sights on a man of brains, to whom <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>look</b> up", she lamented, [...] "but what a terrible let down it would be to find out that I was smarter than he was." ...|$|E
2500|$|Louis Armstrong thought {{enough of}} Miller {{to carry around}} his recordings, {{transferred}} to seven-inch tape reels when he went on tour. [...] " [...] liked musicians who prized melody, and his selections ranged from Glenn Miller to Jelly Roll Morton to Tchaikovsky." [...] Jazz pianist George Shearing's quintet of the 1950s and 1960s was influenced by Miller: [...] "with Shearing's locked hands style piano (influenced by the voicing of Miller's saxophone section) in the middle [...] ". Frank Sinatra and Mel Tormé held the orchestra in high regard. Tormé credited Miller with giving him helpful advice when he first started his singing and song-writing career in the 1940s. Mel Tormé met Glenn Miller in 1942, the meeting facilitated by Tormé's father and Ben Pollack. Tormé and Miller discussed [...] "That Old Black Magic", which was just emerging as a new song by Johnny Mercer and Harold Arlen. Miller told Tormé to pick up every song by Mercer and study it and to become a voracious reader of anything he could find, because [...] "all good lyric writers are great readers." [...] In an interview with George T. Simon in 1948, Sinatra lamented the inferior quality of music he was recording in the late forties, in comparison with [...] "those great Glenn Miller things" [...] from eight years earlier. Frank Sinatra's recording sessions from the late forties and early fifties use some Miller musicians. Trigger Alpert, a bassist from the civilian band, Zeke Zarchy for the Army Air Forces Band and Willie Schwartz, the lead clarinetist from the civilian band back up Frank Sinatra on many recordings. With opposite opinion, fellow bandleader Artie Shaw frequently disparaged the band after Miller's death: [...] "All I {{can say is that}} Glenn should have lived, and 'Chattanooga Choo Choo' should have died." [...] Clarinetist Buddy DeFranco surprised many people when he led the Glenn Miller Orchestra in the late sixties and early seventies. De Franco was already a veteran of bands like Gene Krupa and Tommy Dorsey in the 1940s. He was also a major exponent of modern jazz in the 1950s. He never saw Miller as leading a swinging jazz band, but DeFranco is extremely fond of certain aspects of the Glenn Miller style. [...] "I found that when I opened with the sound of 'Moonlight Serenade', <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>look</b> around and see men and women weeping as the music carried them back to years gone by." [...] De Franco says, [...] "the beauty of Glenn Miller's ballads [...] caused people to dance together." ...|$|E

60|$|I was paralysed by {{the sight}} of such grief. I don't know what I thought, or what <b>I</b> dreaded. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> only <b>look</b> at him.|$|R
6000|$|... "In all my {{thoughts}} of you I {{had never thought}} of your going away. I couldn't speak to Penelope. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> only <b>look</b> at her.|$|R
6000|$|I {{advanced}} a few steps. I {{tried to}} consider with myself what I should say. It was useless. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> neither think nor speak. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> only <b>look</b> at her. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> only say, nervously-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I wish I could too," [...] said Rollo. [...] "I {{should like}} to climb up one of those trees which hangs over, and then <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>look</b> down." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>look</b> {{up again}} all was changed, the banner nowhere in sight, but I kept my saddle, {{and cut down}} half a dozen rascaille after that." ...|$|E

60|$|I {{felt his}} sympathy and {{delicacy}} too strongly {{to thank him}} in words; <b>I</b> <b>could</b> only <b>look</b> my gratitude as {{he asked me to}} follow him up stairs.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> said <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>look</b> at it: and thereupon {{he gave me}} some {{brandy and}} water in a tin pannikin, and left me once more to myself.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>could</b> but <b>look</b> my sympathy, but he, {{though the}} life was ebbing swiftly out of him, still kept his duty before him, like the gallant gentleman he was.|$|R
6000|$|... "And do {{you really}} think, Susan," [...] said Anne, looking solemn enough, [...] "that either Myra Murray or <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>look</b> solemn and holy all the time--ALL the time, Susan?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I should prefer {{having these}} left with me,' said Louis; 'I have but little time before me, and if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>look</b> them over to-night, I should be {{prepared}} for you to-morrow.' ...|$|E
60|$|But when <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>look</b> at her I seldom wasted time on scenery. Looking at her now I {{tried to}} get again that {{impression}} of a difference in her. It eluded me.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{not help}} <b>looking</b> at the fire, in an obvious state of doubt.|$|R
60|$|It was Dorothy. Her {{hands were}} {{stretched}} out in welcome, and then I had them pressed in my own. And <b>I</b> <b>could</b> only <b>look</b> and look again, for I was dumb with joy.|$|R
60|$|I had now {{completely}} {{got over}} my sea-sickness, and felt very well; {{at least in}} my body, though my heart was far from feeling right; so that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> now <b>look</b> around me, and make observations.|$|R
60|$|I tiptoed {{down the}} path and stooped behind the low wall which {{surrounded}} the stunted orchard. Creeping in its shadow I reached a point whence <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>look</b> straight through the uncurtained window.|$|E
60|$|She {{sat down}} without a word, where <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>look</b> at her. Mr. Allen {{raised his eyebrows}} at the revelation in our talk, but {{by the grace of}} God he kept his mouth shut.|$|E
60|$|He had risen. He {{laid his}} hand upon my shoulder. Instead of flinging it off, I was glad of its kindly pressure. He {{was the only}} man to whom <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>look</b> for help.|$|E
60|$|Percy strode up {{and down}} the room. Once or twice he stopped before me, as if he would speak, but he did not. I was crying freely now, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>look</b> up at him.|$|R
5000|$|... "Jimotmi" [...] - Jimotmi {{which stands}} for 지켜주지 못해서 미안해 (Jikyeojuji motaeseo mianhae), which means 'Sorry <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>look</b> out for you.' In this segment, the members play hidden-camera pranks on each other {{to see how they}} react.|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{now that}} in thy face I read [...] Their cruel homily, [...] Before their beauty I would fain [...] Untouched, unsoftened be,-- [...] If <b>I</b> indeed <b>could</b> <b>look</b> on even [...] The senseless, loveless earth and heaven [...] As thou canst look on me! ...|$|R
