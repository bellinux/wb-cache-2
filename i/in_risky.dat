5|$|Alcoholism, {{also known}} as alcohol use {{disorder}} (AUD), is a broad term for any drinking of alcohol that results in mental or physical health problems. It was previously divided into two types: alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence. In a medical context, alcoholism is said to exist when {{two or more of}} the following conditions is present: a person drinks large amounts over a long time period, has difficulty cutting down, acquiring and drinking alcohol takes up a great deal of time, alcohol is strongly desired, usage results in not fulfilling responsibilities, usage results in social problems, usage results in health problems, usage results <b>in</b> <b>risky</b> situations, withdrawal occurs when stopping, and alcohol tolerance has occurred with use. Risky situations include drinking and driving or having unsafe sex among others. Alcohol use can affect all parts of the body but particularly affects the brain, heart, liver, pancreas, and immune system. This can result in mental illness, Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome, an irregular heart beat, liver failure, and an increase in the risk of cancer, among other diseases. Drinking during pregnancy can cause damage to the baby resulting in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. Generally women are more sensitive to alcohol's harmful physical and mental effects than men.|$|E

As a result, during downside regimes, correlations across equities are greater on the downside as opposed to the upside and this may have disastrous effects on the economy.|$|R

25|$|Extensive {{personality}} {{research has}} been done that links positive emotional states to individual differences <b>in</b> <b>risky</b> behaviour. The trait positive urgency, defined as the tendency to engage <b>in</b> <b>risky</b> behaviour under conditions of extreme positive affect, is predictive of substance or behavioural problems that lead to addiction. This trait represents an underlying dysregulation in response to extreme affective states and has a direct impact on behaviour. The trait 'positive urgency' has been shown to have a predictive relationship with increases in drinking quantity and alcohol-related problems in college, as well as drug use in college. Furthermore, this trait provides important information on how positive affect can increase the likelihood of engaging in substance abuse.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, {{the trait}} {{negative}} urgency, the propensity to engage <b>in</b> <b>risky</b> behaviour {{in response to}} distress, is highly predictive of certain aspects of substance abuse in adolescents.

40|$|Purpose of the article: This study tackles the questions, {{whether the}} betas of companies, that are <b>in</b> a <b>riskier</b> market position, are higher, lower or {{approximately}} the same compared to companies <b>in</b> a less <b>risky</b> position and whether the values of beta of companies <b>in</b> <b>riskier</b> and <b>in</b> less <b>risky</b> positions are over 1, within the interval ⟨ 0; 1 ⟩, or negative. Methodology/methods: There are used secondary data from financial statements of selected companies acting in the Czech automotive industry from the period 2002 – 2010. The corporate- and market life cycle is identified according to the model by Reiners (2004) and the beta coefficient is calculated by an alternative way using the accounting earnings. Scientific aim: The research should answer the question, whether the betas of companies, that are <b>in</b> a <b>riskier</b> market position, are higher, lower or {{approximately the same}} compared to companies <b>in</b> a less <b>risky</b> position and whether the values of beta of companies <b>in</b> <b>riskier</b> and <b>in</b> less <b>risky</b> positions are over 1, within the interval ⟨ 0; 1 ⟩, or negative. Findings: The beta coefficient reaches by market drivers mostly values over 1 and by two other positions mostly the values within the interval ⟨ 0; 1 ⟩. Among market pioneers, beta of one company reaches an extreme value – 22. 89 and so the average value of beta for this position is much lower than for market drivers. According to the median value, the beta for market pioneers is lower than for market drivers, too. Only one company within the sample holds the position of market follower and its beta reaches the value 0. 41. All companies are in market positions {{with a high level}} of risk in most periods. The positions with a low risk are held maximally in 3 periods, which is typical especially for companies with a value of beta over 1. Conclusions: From these findings about betas can be derived, that cost of equity, which is the expected return of owners, will be higher for market drivers than for market pioneers because of a higher risk. But there are some limits, deriving from characteristics of secondary (accounting) data...|$|R

25|$|The {{extent of}} alcohol myopia’s effects on one’s {{decisions}} about how to react to sexual arousal is dependent upon the level of confliction one feels. The more intense the personal conflict {{of whether or not}} to use a condom, the greater effect alcohol has on the final decision to engage <b>in</b> <b>risky</b> sexual behavior. Intoxicated males who had felt heavily conflicted about condom use were least likely to use a condom. Those intoxicated men who had been less conflicted about using a condom were {{more likely to engage in}} safe sex. Therefore, some intoxicated individuals can actually be less likely to engage <b>in</b> <b>risky</b> sexual behavior than their sober counterparts, given appropriate cues. The effects of alcohol myopia on response to sexual arousal also depend on the level of sexual arousal. When sexual arousal levels were high, a greater percentage of men reported not using a condom than when arousal levels were low. This goes back to the importance of saliency in alcohol myopia. The more salient the external cue (in this case, higher levels of sexual arousal were more salient than lower levels) the more likely it is for alcohol to inhibit the comprehension of the consequences of an action.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{optimism}} bias occurs for both positive events, such as believing oneself {{to be more}} financially successful than others, and negative events, such as being {{less likely to have}} a drinking problem, there is more research and evidence suggesting that the bias is stronger for negative events. Different consequences result from these two types of events: positive events often lead to feelings of well being and self-esteem, while negative events lead to consequences involving more risk, such as engaging <b>in</b> <b>risky</b> behaviors and not taking precautionary measures for safety.|$|E

Writing about the traditionally masculine domain of boxing from the ringside, Barnes explored boxing as a window into women's modern identities. In 1914, she first posed the question “What do women want at a fight?” in an article titled “My Sisters and I at a New York Prizefight” published in New York World magazine. According to Irene Gammel, “Barnes’ essay effectively begins to unravel an entire cultural history of repression for women”.|$|E
25|$|After the crash, {{airlines}} began enacting {{policies to}} ensure {{that at least one}} older, more seasoned crew member was on board planes at all times. They also began reappraising the traditional unwritten rule that the captain had ultimate authority on a flight and could not be questioned. From that point onward, first officers were encouraged to speak up if they believed a captain was making a mistake. Finally, as this was the first major accident involving a low-cost carrier, the FAA started paying more strict attention to low-cost airlines, many of which were engaging <b>in</b> <b>risky</b> operating practices to reduce costs.|$|E
25|$|Related {{to their}} {{increased}} tendency for risk-taking, adolescents show impaired behavioral inhibition, including deficits in extinction learning. This {{has important implications}} for engaging <b>in</b> <b>risky</b> behavior such as unsafe sex or illicit drug use, as adolescents are less likely to inhibit actions that may have negative outcomes in the future. This phenomenon also has consequences for behavioral treatments based on the principle of extinction, such as cue exposure therapy for anxiety or drug addiction. It has been suggested that impaired inhibition, specifically extinction, may help to explain adolescent propensity to relapse to drug-seeking even following behavioral treatment for addiction.|$|E

Results showed that a majority of college aged females who had been drinking chose not to address risk topics before sexual intercourse with a partner. Alcohol myopia can explain this relationship. The inebriated females’ abilities to analyze internal cues warning them of the risks of sex were inhibited by alcohol, while alcohol caused them to become more responsive to the salient cue of arousal.|$|E
25|$|On various Internet forums, some gamers have {{expressed}} disapproval of publishers having creative control since publishers {{are more apt}} to follow short-term market trends rather than invest <b>in</b> <b>risky</b> but potentially lucrative ideas. On the other hand, publishers may know better than developers what consumers want. The relationship between video game developers and publishers parallels the relationship between recording artists and record labels in many ways. But unlike the music industry, which has seen flat or declining sales in the early 2000s, the video game industry continues to grow. Also, personal computers have made the independent development of music almost effortless, while the gap between an independent game developer and the product of a fully financed one grows larger.|$|E

People who work in areas with woods, bushes, leaf litter, and tall grass {{are at risk of}} becoming infected with Lyme at work. Employers can reduce the risk for employees by providing education on Lyme transmission and infection risks, and about how to check themselves for ticks on the groin, armpits, and hair. Work clothing used <b>in</b> <b>risky</b> areas should be washed in hot water and dried in a hot dryer to kill any ticks.|$|E
50|$|The {{name comes}} {{originally}} from the insurance industry.

25|$|Immigrants {{may often}} do types {{of work that}} natives are largely unwilling to do, {{contributing}} to greater economic prosperity for {{the economy as a}} whole: for instance, Mexican migrant workers taking up manual farm work in the United States has close to zero effect on native employment in that occupation, which means that the effect of Mexican workers on U.S. employment outside farm work was therefore most likely positive, since they raised overall economic productivity. Research indicates that immigrants are more likely to work <b>in</b> <b>risky</b> jobs than U.S.-born workers, partly due to differences in average characteristics, such as immigrants' lower English language ability and educational attainment. Further, some studies indicate that higher ethnic concentration in metropolitan areas is positively related to the probability of self-employment of immigrants.|$|E

The Panic created financial difficulties for the company, and it floated bonds to stay alive. J.

The partners dissolved Carnegie, McCandless & Co. {{to take advantage of a}} new Pennsylvania law permitting the formation of limited liability companies, and the Edgar Thomson Steel Company Ltd. was created on October 12, 1874.
