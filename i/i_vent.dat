40|$|Inhalation of {{amyl nitrite}} in the water-loaded rat under ethanol {{anaesthesia}} produced a brief fall of blood pressure {{followed by a}} prolonged antidiuretic response. The antidiuretic response to amyl nitrite was accompanied by increased urinary excretion of vasopressin, it was blocked by a specific vasopressin antagonist and by a barbiturate and it was absent in the Brattleboro rat with congenital diabetes insipidus. These {{results show that the}} antidiuretic response to the hypotension induced by amyl nitrite is due to the release of vasopressin and that this release is mediated by a neuroendocrine reflex acting through the brain stem. Carbachol and nicotine produced an antidiuretic response on injection into a lateral cerebral ventricle (<b>i.</b> <b>vent.).</b> Carbachol was almost ineffective, but nicotine much more effective, when injected into the cisterna magna (i. cist.) from which in the rat there is no access to the ventricles. Carbachol therefore acts at a site reached from the ventricles, possibly the paraventricular nucleus. Nicotine acts at a more distal site reached from the subarachnoid space. This site may correspond with the nicotine-sensitive area on the ventral surface of the brain stem which has been described in the cat. Atropine blocked the antidiuretic response to carbachol but not that to amyl nitrite. Hexamethonium blocked the antidiuretic response to amyl nitrite as well as that to nicotine and was more effective on i. cist. than <b>i.</b> <b>vent.</b> injection. These results reveal a cholinergic link with a nicotinic but not a muscarinic receptor in the neural pathways controlling the release of vasopressin in response to hypotension. A hypothetical model is presented in which the release of vasopressin is stimulated by a pathway arising from chemoreceptors and inhibited by a second pathway arising from stretch- and baroreceptors. Hypotension acts by suppressing the normally predominant inhibitory pathway and stimulating the excitatory pathway. Hexamethonium is presumed to block transmission at a synapse in the excitatory pathway at the ventral surface or, less probably, at the paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei...|$|E

40|$|During {{the last}} ten years, {{there has been an}} {{increasing}} awareness of sporadic cases of Primary Amoebic Meningo-encephalitis (PAM) affecting primarily younger age groups and appearing in an acute fulminant form. The earliest positive case (Willaert, 1974) may have been in England in 1909 which shows that the disease has been with us for a long time. The pathogenic free-living amebae (PFLA), which comprises the genus Naegleria and the genus Acanthamoeba, are the causative organisms of PAM and AM*respectively. PAM is a rapidly fatal disease affecting the central nervous system (CNS),the treatment of which to date has been successful in {{only a small number of}} cases, and therefore the continual screening of suitable chemotherapeutic agents against amebae of the Naegleria spp. and Acanthamoeba spp., is of great importance. AM is also essentially confined to the CNS although it may take the form of chronic granulomata in the liver, spleen, uterus and kidneys (Martinez et al., 1977). Six chemotherapeutic agents: Amphotericin B, 5 -Fluorocytosine, Kanamycin, Oxytetracycline, Tylosine and Levamisole were tested for activity against a non-pathogenic and a pathogenic species of Naegleria and a non-pathogenic and a pathogenic species of Acanthamoeba in axenic culture. For the Naegleria spp., Amphotericin B and Oxytetracycline were found to be active and the Acanthamoeba spp. were found to be only susceptible to Levamisole. The synergistic combinations of drugs against the amebae were also investigated in axenic culture. In preliminary trials Kanamycin together with Oxytetracycline showed promise against Naegleria fowleri (MsM) but this was later shown not to be the case. Amphotericin B in combination with 5 -Fluorocytosine was also shown not to be synergistic, however Amphotericin B in combination with Oxytetracycline proved to be effective against N. fowleri. Amphotericin B was combined with 5 -Fluorocytosine against A. culbertsoni (A- 1) but was not found to be synergistically active. * Amebic meningitis caused by Acanthamoeba infections. Levamisole was also tested against N. gruberi (P 1200 f) and A. castellanii (0. 1) at various stages in growth of the amebae (i. e. 24, 48 and 72 hour stock cultures) to determine the effect of using aged amebae. It was found that the age of the stock culture bore no relation to the activity of the drug. After axenic culture testing, the susceptibility of the pathogenic N. fowleri (MsM) and A. culbertsoni (A- 1) to the agents which showed activity, was investigated in a vero cell culture system. For N. fowleri (MsM) the results of axenic culture testing were confirmed, with Amphotericin B and Oxytetracycline protecting the monolayer from the destructive effects of the amebae, both when used singly and at a greater efficiency when added together as a synergistic combination. Levamisole, although effective to some extent against Acanthamoeba spp. in axenic culture, failed to show any activity against the amebae in vero cell culture testing. In vivo animal protection studies were then performed using drugs that had been shown either in this or other studies to be effective against either Naegleria or Acanthamoeba spp. Chemotherapeutic agents tested on N. fowleri (MsM) included two imidazoles; Miconazole nitrate and Ketoconazole (previously known as R 41, 400), as well as Amphotericin B. The synergistic combination of Amphotericin B with either Tetracycline or Oxytetracycline was also investigated. For A. culbertsoni (A- 1), 5 -Fluorocytosine, and Polymyxin B were tried both singly and in combination. These drugs were injected by intraperitoneal (I. P.) and intraventricular (<b>I.</b> <b>vent.)</b> routes. The results were not promising, with none of the drugs offering significant protection even whilst using Amphotericin B which is considered the drug of choice. The question of adequate drug levels reaching the brain was tested out with two imidazoles, Ketoconazole and Miconazole. Serum samples were assayed against Candida pirapsilosis and C. pseudotropicalis respectively at various time intervals after innoculation with the drug, and a gradual increase and breakdown of the drug in the animal system could then be shown. These results showed that based on in vitro results, the levels of the imidazoles obtained in the serum after the first eight hours after injection, should have been sufficiently high to prevent amebic multiplication...|$|E

40|$|Research on subtidal {{hydrothermal}} vent ecosystems at Milos, Hellenic Volcanic Arc (Aegean Sea), suggested that vent activity increased the species richness of sessile epibenthic assemblages. Based on 303 species found in 6 sites (3 close to vents, 3 farther away), {{the present paper}} uses correspondence analysis and species/samples curves to examine the species composition and richness of these assemblages. Differences due to vent proximity were more important than those due to bottom depth and distance from the shore. Diversity was confirmed to be higher near the vents, although none of the 266 species found at the vent sites {{can be considered as}} obligate vent-associated species. Seven different, although not mutually exclusive, hypotheses are discussed to explain the pattern of increased epibenthic species diversity at the <b>vent</b> sites, namely: (<b>i)</b> <b>vents</b> represent an intermediate disturbance, inducing mortality by the emission of toxic fluids; (ii) higher winter temperature allows for the occurrence of warm-water species, which add to the regional background; (iii) venting disrupts the homogeneity of the water bottom layer, increasing bottom roughness and hence habitat heterogeneity; (iv) deposition of minerals and enhanced bioconstruction by Ca enrichment increment habitat provision; (v) fluid emission induces advective mechanisms that favour recruitment; (vi) vents emit CO 2, nutrients and trace elements that enhance primary productivity; and (vii) bacterial chemosynthesis add to photosynthesis to provide a diversity of food sources for the fauna...|$|R

6000|$|Two potent {{characteristics}} {{of his country}} were at war within him. There was, first, the belief in [...] "gentrice," [...] in a natural difference of kind between men of coat armour and men without it. Thus Roderick Random, the starving cadet {{of a line of}} small lairds, accepts the almost incredible self-denial and devotion of Strap as merely his due. Prince Charles could not have taken the devotion of Henry Goring, or of Neil MacEachain, more entirely as a matter of course, involving no consideration in return, than Roderick took the unparalleled self-sacrifice of his barber friend and school-mate. Scott has remarked on this contemptuous and ungrateful selfishness, and has contrasted it with the relations of Tom Jones and Partridge. Of course, it is not to be assumed that Smollett would have behaved like Roderick, when, [...] "finding the fire in my apartment almost extinguished, <b>I</b> <b>vented</b> my fury upon poor Strap, whose ear I pinched with such violence that he roared hideously with pain [...] " [...] To be sure Roderick presently [...] "felt unspeakable remorse [...] . foamed at the mouth, and kicked the chairs about the room." [...] Now Strap had rescued Roderick from starvation, had bestowed on him hundreds of pounds, and had carried his baggage, and dined on his leavings. But Strap was not gently born!
