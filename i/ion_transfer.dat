It is an electrolytic process using pure gold for the cathode (or titanium {{as a starter}} cathode) and chloroauric acid (gold chloride-hydrochloric acid) as the electrolyte; this is made by dissolving gold with chlorine gas {{in the presence of}} hydrochloric acid. Gold is dissolved at the anode, and pure gold, traveling through the acid by <b>ion</b> <b>transfer,</b> is plated onto the cathode. Silver forms an insoluble chloride slime and copper and platinum form soluble chlorides that are removed. This procedure is used on a very large industrial scale and has a large set up cost due to the amount of gold that needs to be permanently dissolved in the electrolyte.|$|E

The results showed that H- 2 TPP and MTPP did assist the H+ <b>ion</b> <b>transferring</b> across the W/NB interface to different extent. Under the condition of H+ concentration (W) being lesser than the H- 2 TPP concentration (NB), the process of H+ <b>ion</b> <b>transferring</b> across the W/NB interface faciliated by H- 2 TPP was reversible and diffusion-controtted. As far as the MTPP was concerned, the sequence of their relative activities is: NiTPP>MnTPP>CoTPP, CuTPP>ZnTPP, FeClTPP, this order consisted with the sequence of their stability.

50|$|In {{the early}} eighties Jürgen Kluge at the University of Mainz {{considered}} mass measurements of trapped ions. Gernot Gräff, {{who worked at the}} same institute, had developed a time-of-flight technique for the determination of the electron-proton mass ratio from the respective cyclotron-resonance frequencies. During this period the determination of the fundamental properties of the electron was of the highest interest. This included the measurement of the g-factor of the free electron, again with a Penning trap, for which Hans Dehmelt eventually won the Nobel Prize in physics in 1989. Jürgen decided to apply Gräff’s method to the determination of masses of unstable nuclei. A setup was designed and built at Mainz, which comprised two Penning traps in a row. Following the idea of separation of functions, one trap served as the source of well-prepared ions for the actual mass measurement at the second trap. The operation of the setup thus included the <b>ion</b> <b>transfer</b> from one trap to the other. The first successful <b>ion</b> <b>transfer</b> was reported in 1986.|$|E
40|$|The {{long-term}} goals {{of this work}} {{is to develop a}} better understanding of the coupled transport phenomena role in enhancement of salt <b>ions</b> <b>transfer</b> at electrodialysis of moderate-dilute and dilute electrolyte solutions in membrane modules of various constructions. Dependences of partial salt ions and H+(OH¿) fluxes through an anion-exchange membrane as a function of voltage applied to a membrane or a membrane channel were measured. On the base of the data obtained, reasons of the growth of salt <b>ions</b> `overlimiting' mass <b>transfer</b> in electrodialysis desalination channels with intermembrane distance and different NaCl solution concentration were analysed. It is shown that the role of gravitational convection may be important in desalination channels with a quite great intermembrane distance and electrolyte solution concentration. In this case a salt ions concentration at a membrane¿solution interface does not decrease to values sufficient for promoting the H+ and OH¿ generation and electroconvection. In desalination channels with small intermembrane distances, when treating dilute solutions, the salt concentration at the membrane surface reaches very small values. It promotes the H+ and OH¿ generation and a space charge region arising. An additional salt <b>ions</b> <b>transfer</b> occurs due to the exaltation effect as well as to the electroconvection. In this case the gravitational convection contribution is negligible...|$|R

At the latter University he mainly dealt with physical chemistry and submitted his PhD thesis “Ueber elektrolytische Erscheinungen und elektromotorische Kräfte an der Grenzfläche zweier Lösungsmittel”. This work was supervised by Professor Walther Nernst. This pioneering work is remembered {{as the starting point}} of what is now known as the electrochemistry at the interface between two immiscible electrolyte solutions (ITIES) which now constitutes a research field of its own. The determination of the free energies of <b>ion</b> <b>transfer</b> between aqueous and organic solutions is of great importance for biology, physiology, pharmacy, and for liquid-liquid extraction in chemistry.

5000|$|The Wohlwill {{process is}} an industrial-scale {{chemical}} procedure used to refine gold {{to the highest}} degree of purity (99.999%). The process was invented in 1874 by Emil Wohlwill. This electrochemical process involves using a cast dore ingot, often called a Doré bar, of 95%+ gold {{to serve as an}} anode. Lower percentages of gold in the anode will interfere with the reaction, especially when the contaminating metal is silver or one of the platinum group elements. The cathode(s) for this reaction are small sheets of pure (24k) gold sheeting or stainless steel. Current is applied to the system, and electricity travels through the electrolyte of chloroauric acid. Gold and other metals are dissolved at the anode, and pure gold (coming through the chloroauric acid by <b>ion</b> <b>transfer)</b> is plated onto the gold cathode. When the anode is dissolved, the cathode is removed and melted or otherwise processed in the manner required for sale or use. The resulting gold is 99.999% pure, and of higher purity than gold produced by the other common refining method, the Miller process, which produces gold of 99.95% purity.|$|E
40|$|AbstractRecent {{advances}} in {{the determination of the}} X-ray crystallographic structures of bacteriorhodopsin, and some of its photointermediates, reveal the nature of the linkage between the relaxation of electrostatic and steric conflicts at the retinal and events elsewhere in the protein. The transport cycle can be now understood in terms of specific and well-described displacements of hydrogen-bonded water, and main-chain and side-chain atoms, that lower the pKas of the proton release group in the extracellular region and Asp- 96 in the cytoplasmic region. Thus, local electrostatic conflict of the photoisomerized retinal with Asp- 85 and Asp- 212 causes deprotonation of the Schiff base, and results in a cascade of events culminating in proton release to the extracellular surface. Local steric conflict of the 13 -methyl group with Trp- 182 causes, in turn, a cascade of movements in the cytoplasmic region, and results in reprotonation of the Schiff base. Although numerous questions concerning the mechanism of each of these proton (or perhaps hydroxyl <b>ion)</b> <b>transfers</b> remain, the structural results provide a detailed molecular explanation for how the directionality of the <b>ion</b> <b>transfers</b> is determined by the configurational relaxation of the retinal...|$|R
40|$|The marine bacterium, Vibrio alginolyticus, {{normally}} requires sodium for motility. We {{found that}} lithium will substitute for sodium. In neutral pH buffers, the membrane potential and swimming speed of glycolyzing bacteria reached maximal values as sodium or lithium concentration was increased. While the maximal potentials {{obtained in the}} two cations were comparable, the maximal swimming speed was substantially lower in lithium. Over {{a wide range of}} sodium concentration, the bacteria maintained an invariant sodium electrochemical potential as determined by membrane potential and intracellular sodium measurements. Over this range the increase of swimming speed took Michaelis-Menten form. Artificial energization of swimming motility required imposition of a voltage difference in concert with a sodium pulse. The cation selectivity and concentration dependence exhibited by the motile apparatus depended on the viscosity of the medium. In high-viscosity media, swimming speeds were relatively independent of either ion type or concentration. These facts parallel and extend observations of the swimming behavior of bacteria propelled by proton-powered flagella. In particular, they show that <b>ion</b> <b>transfers</b> limit unloaded motor speed in this bacterium and imply that the coupling between <b>ion</b> <b>transfers</b> and force generation must be fairly tight...|$|R

The coating composition is substantially free of reactive fillers and plasticizers commonly employed as porosity promoting agents in separator coatings. When the separator is immersed in electrolyte, the polymeric ester {{of the film}} coating reacts with the electrolyte forming a salt and an alcohol.
