5|$|The loss {{of species}} from {{ecological}} communities, defaunation, is primarily driven by human activity. This has resulted in empty forests, ecological communities depleted of large vertebrates. In the Quaternary extinction event, the mass <b>die-off</b> of megafaunal variety coincided {{with the appearance of}} humans, suggesting a human influence. One hypothesis is that humans hunted large mammals, such as the woolly mammoth, into extinction.|$|E
5|$|There is {{overwhelming}} evidence of global disruption of plant communities at the K–Pg boundary. Extinctions are seen both {{in studies of}} fossil pollen, and fossil leaves. In North America, the data suggests massive devastation and mass extinction of plants at the K–Pg boundary sections, although there were substantial megafloral changes before the boundary. In North America, approximately 57% of plant species became extinct. In high southern hemisphere latitudes, such as New Zealand and Antarctica, the mass <b>die-off</b> of flora caused no significant turnover in species, but dramatic and short-term changes in the relative abundance of plant groups. In some regions, the Paleocene recovery of plants began with recolonizations by fern species, represented as a fern spike in the geologic record; this same pattern of fern recolonization was observed after the 1980 Mount St. Helens eruption.|$|E
5|$|The use of data loggers at {{sea that}} record {{ingestion}} of water against time (providing a likely time of feeding) suggests that albatrosses predominantly feed during the day. Analysis of the squid beaks regurgitated by albatrosses {{has shown that}} many of the squid eaten are too large to have been caught alive, and include mid-water species likely to be beyond the reach of albatross, suggesting that, for some species (like the wandering albatross), scavenged squid may be {{an important part of the}} diet. The source of these dead squid is a matter of debate; some certainly comes from squid fisheries, but in nature it primarily comes from the <b>die-off</b> that occurs after squid spawning and the vomit of squid-eating whales (sperm whales, pilot whales and southern bottlenose whales). The diet of other species, like the black-browed albatross or the grey-headed albatross, is rich with smaller species of squid that tend to sink after death, and scavenging is not assumed to play a large role in their diet. The waved albatross has been observed practising kleptoparasitism, harassing boobies to steal their food, making it the only member of its order to do so regularly.|$|E
50|$|In February 2010, the {{documentary}} film Nicotine Bees was released. This film analyzes the possible {{factors contributing to}} the large bee <b>die-offs</b> worldwide and concludes that the large use of neonicotinoids is the most probable cause of the recent bee <b>die-offs.</b>|$|R

50|$|In {{the last}} two decades tens of {{thousands}} of Australian flying foxes have died during extreme heat events. Flying fox <b>die-offs</b> feature arguably among the most dramatic mass mortality events witnessed in nature, but they can be indicators of heat stress in more cryptic fauna where impacts are more difficult to assess. The <b>die-offs</b> are important additional threats to Australian flying-foxes and the ecosystem services they provide, and highlight the complex implications of climate change for behaviour, demography, and species survival.|$|R
25|$|<b>Die-off</b> marshes {{had half}} {{the biomass of}} {{top-level}} predators found at vegetated sites, while the biomass of nonharvested consumers did not differ between <b>die-off</b> and vegetated sites. Additionally, the predation rate on Sesarma at vegetated sites was triple that of <b>die-off</b> sites, and crabs consumed four times more grass at <b>die-off</b> sites than at vegetated sites. Historical reconstructions showed that little net marsh loss (<5%) from 1939-2005 occurred at currently vegetated sites. In contrast, <b>die-off</b> marshes exhibited the onset of <b>die-off</b> in the mid-70s, with consistently increasing vegetation loss through 2005, at which time >20% of the total marsh area was lost to <b>die-off</b> and >80% of the cordgrass zone was unvegetated. This divergence between <b>die-off</b> and vegetated marshes in vegetation loss coincides with a period of rapid {{increase in the number}} of docks and boat slips before the mid-70s that resulted in the establishment of >70% of that fishing infrastructure currently present at <b>die-off</b> marshes. These results provide evidence that Sesarma release from predation pressure by crabs and fish due to recreational overfishing by anglers is driving a trophic cascade that is responsible for extensive marsh <b>die-off</b> throughout southern New England (Altieri et al. 2012).|$|E
25|$|<b>Die-off</b> {{can affect}} {{several species of}} cordgrass (genus Spartina), {{including}} S. alterniflora, S. densiflora, and S. townsendii. There are several competing hypotheses predicting the causes and mechanisms of salt marsh <b>die-off</b> throughout the western Atlantic. These hypotheses place different emphasis {{on the effects of}} top-down or bottom-up processes for salt marsh <b>die-off.</b> Combined with salt marsh dieback of the high marsh, salt marsh <b>die-off</b> is a serious threat to the ecosystem services that marshes provide to local coastal communities.|$|E
25|$|In New England, {{predator}} depletion {{has triggered}} extensive marsh <b>die-off</b> salt marsh creek banks. Herbivory has already impacted up to 90% of creek banks {{in more than}} 70% of outer Cape Cod marshes. Absent in 1997, <b>die-off</b> has recently spread into Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island, impacting over 85% of creek banks. The nocturnal purple marsh crab, Sesarma reticulatum, is playing {{a major role in}} this <b>die-off</b> through increased burrowing and herbivory due to release from predation pressure. Evidence has pointed to top-down control caused by human disturbances as the primary agent driving <b>die-off.</b>|$|E

40|$|This thesis used {{traditional}} {{environmental knowledge}} (TEK) {{to assess the}} impacts of climate change on food security for First Nations communities located in the western James Bay region of northern Ontario. In addition, climate scenarios were derived from General Circulation Models (GCMs) and Regional Climate Models (RCMs). The TEK data revealed there were no observable climatic-related effects on fish species (i. e., distributional change) except the fish <b>die-offs</b> of July 2005. Climate data specific {{for the period of}} the fish <b>die-offs</b> in the Albany River (the western James Bay region) indicated not only a temporal relationship between a heat wave and the fish <b>die-offs,</b> but also a concurrent period of reduced precipitation. Climate scenarios showed increases in mean air temperature for all seasons, all time periods (2011 – 2040, 2041 – 2070, and 2071 – 2100), and all emission scenarios (A 2, A 1 B, and B 1); however, the results for seasonal total precipitation were variable, dependent emission scenarios. TEK suggest that increasing temperatures may not be the only climate change phenomena of importance; climate variability and extreme events were reported as precipitating fish <b>die-offs</b> and changes in the timing of harvesting of fish. Further research should concentrate on the investigation of climate change and food security issues in sub-arctic regions...|$|R
25|$|In coastal New England, this {{evidence}} is weaker. Certain fungal pathogens of S. alterniflora were found {{more frequently in}} sites of <b>die-off.</b> These pathogens have varying degrees of virulence, {{and there is some}} evidence of association with species of Fusarium and areas of <b>die-off.</b> However, although the association suggests a partial causal link, particularly in stress-predisposed plants, strong evidence is lacking to suggest that such fungal pathogens are a major cause of <b>die-off</b> in New England (Elmer 2013).|$|E
25|$|Most recently, Bertness {{and colleagues}} (Bertness et al. 2014b) {{performed}} a field experiment excluding predators from plots on the grazing {{border of the}} marsh. Within one growing season, exclusion of top predators triggered <b>die-off</b> by increasing the abundances of Sesarma crabs {{and the intensity of}} herbivory. To further test the trophic cascade hypothesis, Bertness and colleagues used the spread of <b>die-off</b> into Narragansett Bay to assess all proposed drivers of <b>die-off,</b> including: 1) eutrophication decreases plant investment into belowground biomass causing plant collapse, 2) boat wakes erode creek banks, 3) pollution or disease affect plant health, 4) substrate hardness controls herbivorous crab distributions and 5) trophic dysfunction releases Sesarma from predator control. Nitrogen availability, wave intensity and plant growth did not explain any variation in <b>die-off.</b> However, herbivory explained over 70% of inter-site variation in <b>die-off.</b> (Bertness et al. 2014a) This work highlighted one particular example where top-down interactions were experimentally shown to be the primary driver of ecological community state change.|$|E
25|$|<b>Die-off</b> could {{potentially}} be explained by pathogens of salt marsh plants in some areas - fungal species have been identified at <b>die-off</b> sites in the UK as well as US Atlantic and Gulf coast sites (Elmer 2013). Fungal-facilitated marsh degradation is a documented concern in the Southeast Atlantic in particular. Marsh snails Littoraria irrorata make minor cuts in the cordgrass during grazing. These cuts facilitate growth of fungus, and at high snail densities, can lead to mass infections, increased grazing and consequent <b>die-off</b> (Silliman and Bertness 2002, Silliman and Newell 2003, Silliman et al. 2005).|$|E

50|$|About 70% of the {{wetlands}} surrounding Upper Klamath Lake have been impounded and drained, eliminating {{much of the}} habitat used by juvenile suckers during their development. Healthy wetlands also absorb contaminants such as phosphorus, which in excessive amounts causes blooms of organisms, especially the cyanobacterium Aphanizomenon flos-aquae. These blooms have led to sucker <b>die-offs</b> because the blooms deplete the dissolved oxygen in the water. The water quality in Upper Klamath Lake is poor, especially during the summer. While the sucker is relatively tolerant of poor water quality, compared to other fish, there {{is a history of}} multiple sucker <b>die-offs.</b>|$|R
25|$|One {{theory of}} {{bottom-up}} control lies with differential soil chemistry between vegetated and <b>die-off</b> areas. Drought-associated changes in soil chemistry {{have been proposed}} {{to be associated with}} areas of <b>die-off.</b> Droughts are often associated with increased salinity and acidity stress - soils oxidize under freshwater or tidal moisture limitation, leading to increased acidity. Hypersalinity has been linked to reduced S. alterniflora survival (Brown et al. 2005). However, salt marsh plants are generally tolerant of a broad range of salinity levels, and increased salinity has not consistently been observed in <b>die-off</b> sites (Alber et al. 2008).|$|E
25|$|However, the marsh’s natural {{ability to}} buffer against erosion and {{flooding}} {{may be reduced}} by creek bank <b>die-off.</b> Since Spartina alterniflora is responsible for sediment binding and peat deposition (Redfield 1965), cordgrass <b>die-off</b> may compromise the ability of salt marshes {{to keep pace with}} sea-level rise. Also, the concentration of Sesarma burrows in New England salt marsh peat may directly trigger the erosion and collapse of the peat foundation of marshes.|$|E
25|$|Altieri {{and colleagues}} {{performed}} {{a series of}} experiments (Altieri et al. 2012) designed to elucidate the mechanisms driving marsh <b>die-off</b> more specifically. Sesarma crabs are normally preyed upon by blue crabs (Callinectes sapidus), and fish including striped bass (Morone saxatilis) and smooth dogfish (Mustelus canis). Although the cascading effects of overfishing have been demonstrated across various ecosystems (Myers and Worm 2003), research on predator depletion has focused almost exclusively {{on the impact of}} large-scale commercial overfishing (Worm et al. 2009). However, Altieri and colleagues (2012) demonstrated that the predators of Sesarma were, and continue to be, overexploited by recreational anglers. Their results show that <b>die-off</b> and vegetated marshes differed dramatically in recreational fishing pressure, as anglers were observed only at <b>die-off</b> sites.|$|E
50|$|Natural {{resource}} and environmental managers {{have long been}} challenged by problems caused by thermal stratification of lakes. Fish <b>die-offs</b> have been directly associated with thermal gradients, stagnation, and ice cover. Excessive growth of plankton may limit the recreational use of lakes and the commercial use of lake water. With severe thermal stratification in a lake, the quality of drinking water also can be adversely affected. For fisheries managers, the spatial distribution of fish within a lake is often adversely affected by thermal stratification {{and in some cases}} may indirectly cause large <b>die-offs</b> of recreationally important fish.|$|R
25|$|This {{spread of}} toxic, oxygen-depleted water {{would have been}} devastating for marine life, {{producing}} widespread <b>die-offs.</b> Models of ocean chemistry show that anoxia and euxinia would have been closely associated with hypercapnia (high levels of carbon dioxide).|$|R
50|$|This {{species is}} {{suffering}} from chytrid infections. Drying of streams and severe freezing in winter can cause large <b>die-offs</b> of tadpoles. Trampling and grazing are also threats. The species' range includes the uKhahlamba-Drakensberg Park in South Africa.|$|R
25|$|On Cape Cod, marsh creek {{banks are}} often so riddled with Sesarma burrows that they collapse, exposing fresh peat to further {{burrowing}} and erosion (Bertness et al. 2008). Feedbacks between crab herbivory and cordgrass <b>die-off</b> may thus {{lead to the}} retreat of marsh edges. For example, Coverdale and colleagues found that 20 years of <b>die-off</b> on Cape Cod {{have resulted in the}} loss of over 200 years of marsh accretion and hundreds of acres of marsh loss. The detrimental effects trophic cascades have had on marshes not only reduce the biodiversity, health, and aesthetic appeal of these ecosystems, but also compromise the ability of marshes to provide key ecosystem services to human populations.|$|E

30|$|Our {{results suggest}} that {{periodic}} disturbance can inoculate cane stands against both subsequent stressors and eventual senescence. We observed that, in certain subplots, populations of cane culms all died, reflecting patchy senescence in some cases and complete stand <b>die-offs</b> in others. Such events were particularly pronounced in 2004, a drought year, among large forest stands and unburned small forest stands; however, subplots went extinct during later years as well. We suspect that the greater areal extent of large forest stands reflects older rhizome systems with poorer clonal integration than those of small stands. We have demonstrated previously that cane stands spread outward at similar rates regardless of stand type (Gagnon et al. 2007), so large stands may have been expanding longer (with older rhizome systems) than small stands. We speculate that compensatory growth triggered by the removal of culms rejuvenated the still-integrated rhizome systems of small stands, and thereby rendered them more resistant to subsequent drought and other stressors. The fact that large stands appeared to be more susceptible to <b>die-offs</b> {{regardless of whether they}} burned suggests that cane stands that go too long without disturbance may be susceptible to demographic collapse. Hughes (1966) described similar <b>die-offs</b> but was unable to attribute the phenomenon to any specific cause, although he suggested disease as the culprit. Cane restoration efforts should anticipate similar local <b>die-offs</b> after multiple years without disturbance. Given these observations, we propose that burning still-vigorous cane stands reduces their likelihood of subsequent local extinction, especially in a shaded environment.|$|R

40|$|Large-scale {{mortality}} of invasive bivalves {{was observed in}} the River Danube basin {{in the autumn of}} 2011 due to a particularly low water discharge. The aim {{of this study was to}} quantify and compare the biomass of invasive and native bivalve <b>die-offs</b> amongst eight different sites and to assess the potential role of invasive bivalve <b>die-offs</b> as a resource subsidy for the adjacent terrestrial food web. Invasive bivalve <b>die-offs</b> dominated half of the study sites and their highest density and biomass were recorded at the warm water effluent. The density and biomass values recorded in this study are amongst the highest values recorded for aquatic ecosystems and show that a habitat affected by heated water can sustain an extremely high biomass of invasive bivalves. These mortalities highlight invasive bivalves as a major resource subsidy, possibly contributing remarkable amounts of nutrients and energy to the adjacent terrestrial ecosystem. Given the widespread occur- rence of these invasive bivalves and the predicted increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme climatic events, the ecological impacts generated by their massive mortalities should be taken into account in other geographical areas as well...|$|R

25|$|Coastal {{ecosystems}} {{suffer from}} a variety of anthropogenic impacts, such as large-scale eutrophication, food web alteration, runaway consumer effects, climate change, habitat destruction, and disease. Rarely do these factors act in isolated ways. Often, researchers find additive or synergistic interactions between impacts compounding the amount of ecosystem degradation. One such example is found in salt marshes in the southeastern United States. Depletion of top predators in these systems has led to snail overgrazing of salt marsh cordgrass and subsequent <b>die-off</b> (as explained above). However, this <b>die-off</b> has been linked with intense drought conditions and the resultant increases in salt and acid stress (Silliman et al. 2005). Drought stress that raises soil salinities and increases cordgrass vulnerabilities to top-down control may be a product of climate change (Silliman and Bertness 2002, Silliman et al. 2005). Cases such as these highlight how abiotic and biotic interactions can interact to affect ecosystem health.|$|E
