5|$|Launch and Early Orbit Phase {{operations}} were {{completed in the}} morning of 11 April 2010, and SIRAL-2 was activated later the same day. At 14:40 UTC, the spacecraft returned its first scientific data. <b>Initial</b> <b>data</b> on ice thickness was presented by the mission's Lead Investigator, Duncan Wingham, at the 2010 Living Planet Symposium on 1 July. Later the same month, data was made available to scientists for the first time. The spacecraft underwent six months of on-orbit testing and commissioning, which concluded with a review on 22 October 2010 that found the spacecraft was operating as expected, and that it was ready to begin operations.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} Tropical Storm Cindy {{can be traced}} to a {{tropical}} wave that departed the western coast of Africa on August8, 1993. Over the following days, the wave tracked steadily west-northwestward across the tropical Atlantic while retaining a distinct cloud pattern on satellite images. Although <b>initial</b> <b>data</b> from a reconnaissance aircraft mission on August13 indicated that the system lacked a defined wind circulation, a second mission at 12:00UTC the next day revealed an improvement in its structure at the lower levels of the atmosphere. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) thus classified the system as a tropical depressiona tropical cyclone with sustained winds of less than 39mph (62km/h)and initiated public advisories on it soon thereafter.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Erika was a weak {{hurricane}} {{that struck}} extreme northeastern Mexico near the Texas-Tamaulipas border in mid-August of the 2003 Atlantic hurricane season. Erika was the eighth tropical cyclone, fifth tropical storm, and third hurricane of the season. At first, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) operationally did not designate it as a hurricane because <b>initial</b> <b>data</b> suggested winds of 70mph (115km/h) at Erika's peak intensity. It {{was not until}} later data was analyzed that the NHC revised it to Category1 intensity in the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. The storm developed from a non-tropical {{area of low pressure}} that was tracked for five days before developing in the eastern Gulf of Mexico on August 14. Under the influence of a high pressure system, Erika moved quickly westward and strengthened under favorable conditions. It made landfall as a hurricane on northeastern Mexico on August 16 and rapidly dissipated inland.|$|E

The by-election was triggered {{by the death of}} incumbent Queen's Counsel and former Solicitor General Sir Frank Lockwood on 18 December 1897. If successful, he would have served as second member to John Butcher (later the 1st Baron Danesfort), whom he respected for his work within the constituency. Terry died one day before the announcement of the new member was made, and the election was eventually won by famed admiral and veteran MP Lord Charles Beresford by a mere eleven votes, in a controversial recount forced by a Parliamentary petition after he and Liberal candidate Sir Christopher Furness had both obtained 5,643 votes according to <b>initial</b> <b>data.</b> Terry was buried at the York Cemetery on 15 January 1898, where his monument comprised a large granite cross and a small apron of ground.|$|E

25|$|Each {{test was}} able to {{simultaneously}} illuminate many targets, allowing them to test the amount of x-ray energy needed by placing the targets at different distances from the bomb. Another question was how large the fuel assembly {{had to be in}} order for the fuel to self-heat from the fusion reactions and thus reach ignition. <b>Initial</b> <b>data</b> were available by mid-1984, and the testing ceased in 1988. Ignition was achieved for the first time during these tests, but the amount of energy {{and the size of the}} fuel targets needed to reach ignition was far higher than predicted. During this same period, experiments began on Nova using similar targets to understand their behaviour under laser illumination, allowing direct comparison against the results obtained from the bomb tests.|$|E
25|$|Other recent policy {{initiatives}} adopted by many states of India, claims Guilmoto, attempt {{to address the}} assumed economic disadvantage of girls by offering support to girls and their parents. These policies provide conditional cash transfer and scholarships only available to girls, where payments to a girl and her parents are linked to each stage of her life, such as when she is born, completion of her childhood immunization, her joining school at grade 1, her completing school grades 6, 9 and 12, her marriage past age 21. Some states are offering higher pension benefits to parents who raise one or two girls. Different states of India have been experimenting with various innovations in their girl-driven welfare policies. For example, the state of Delhi adopted a pro-girl policy initiative (locally called Laadli scheme), which <b>initial</b> <b>data</b> suggests may be lowering the birth sex ratio in the state.|$|E
25|$|Storm Data {{was started}} by the Weather Bureau, {{predecessor}} to the National Weather Service (NWS), in 1959. It is updated continuously {{on a monthly basis}} with a lag of a few months from the present. This delay is because the data is compiled and verified by local NWS offices and sent to the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) which does further refinements and publishes Storm Data in reports covering the entire country. The local NWS offices initially gather the data, starting when a severe weather event unfolds and continuing until sufficient information is obtained. The <b>initial</b> <b>data,</b> considered preliminary, is sent in real-time to the Storm Prediction Center (SPC) which does limited quality control as new information becomes available and enters it into its (and its predecessor the National Severe Storms Forecast Center) Storm Events Database that begins in 1950.
