40|$|The {{conventional}} {{concept of}} cometary comae {{is that they}} are dominated by fine particulates released individually by sublimation of surface volatiles and subsequent entrainment in the near-surface gas. It has long been recognized that such particulates could be relatively large, with early estimates that objects perhaps up to one meter in size may be levitated {{from the surface of the}} typical cometary nucleus. However, the general uniformity and small average particulate size of observed comae and the relatively smooth, monotonic increases and decreases in particle density during the Giotto flythrough of <b>comet</b> <b>Halley</b> <b>s</b> coma in 1986 reinforced the view that the bulk of the particles are released at the surface, are fine-sized and inert.

Computational software tools for signal-to-noise ratio estimation of visual and IR sensors, estimation of minimum and maximum ranges of target detection, and GPU (Graphics Processing Units) -accelerated simulations of the IR-based terminal intercept guidance systems are developed. Scaled polyhedron models of known objects, such as the Rosetta mission 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Comet</b> 67 P/C-G, NASA 2 ̆ 7 s OSIRIS-REx Bennu, and asteroid 433 Eros, are utilized in developing a GPU-based simulation tool for the IR-based terminal intercept guidance systems. A parallelized-ray tracing algorithm for simulating realistic surface-to-surface shadowing of irregular-shaped asteroids or comets is developed. Polyhedron solid-angle approximation is also considered. Using these computational models, digital image processing is investigated to determine single or multiple impact locations to assess the technical feasibility of new planetary defense mission concepts of utilizing a Hypervelocity Asteroid Intercept Vehicle (HAIV) or a Multiple Kinetic-energy Interceptor Vehicle (MKIV).

When using an IR sensor, predicting impact locations from filtered images resulted in less jittery spacecraft control accelerations than conducting missions with a visual sensor. Infrared sensors have also the possibility to detect asteroids at greater distances, and if properly used, can aid in terminal phase guidance for proper impact location determination for the MKIV system.

One station in a nonurban river was included (REF). The concentrations of 16 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were determined by HPLC, and the genotoxicity of the sediments was monitored by the Salmonella mutagenicity test (TA 98 + S 9, YG 1041 ± <b>S</b> 9), the <b>comet</b> assay, and the micronucleus assay on CHO cells. Chemical analysis showed that the total PAH concentrations ranged from 23 μg kg− 1 dw (REF) to 1285 μg kg− 1 dw (StD). All the sediments were mutagenic in the Salmonella mutagenicity test. The mutagenicity was probably induced by the presence of nitroarenes (StA, StB, StC, and StD) and aromatic amines (REF) as deduced from the mutagenicity profiles of strains YG 1041 ± S 9 and TA 98 + <b>S</b> 9.

Systematic differences between the 12 -hour component in the meridional wind and the climatological mean are observed showing evidence of a quasi-biennial modulation of the high-latitude semidiurnal tide in the upper mesosphere. The amplitude of the observed tides is enhanced when the equatorial stratospheric quasibiennial oscillation above 10 hPa is westerly. This enhancement is greatest in the summertime tidal amplitudes when the zonal wavenumber one (S = 1) nonmigrating component dominates the semidiurnal wind field, and is coincident with an enhancement of the summertime planetary wave activity in the upper mesosphere.

Therefore, study of antigenotoxic potential of antioxidants is of great importance for protection of human health.

In this work, antigenotoxic properties of vitamin C in E. coli K 12, E. coli WP 2 and S. cerevisiae D 7 reversion assays, {{as well as in}} <b>S.</b> cerevisiae <b>comet</b> assay were examined. t-Butyl hydroperoxide (t-BOOH) was used to induce oxidative mutagenesis, and hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) was used to induce DNA strand breaks in the comet assay. Vitamin C reduced t-BOOH-induced and spontaneous mutagenesis in repair proficient and mismatch repair (MMR) deficient strains of E. coli K 12 respectively, as well as t-BOOH-induced mutagenesis in S. cerevisiae D 7 strain. However, in E. coli K 12 strains that carry plasmid with microsatellite sequences, treatment with vitamin C slightly stimulated microsatellite instability. Vitamin C also showed mutagenic effects in WP 2 oxyR strain, probably due to its prooxidative potential, amplified in the strain deficient in antioxidative defense. In the yeast comet assay, contradictory results were obtained: while low concentration (0. 05 mM) of vitamin C inhibited oxidative damage, higher concentrations (0. 1 – 10 mM) stimulated it. The obtained results indicate that vitamin C can exhibit antigenotoxic or genotoxic effects, depending on the dose, genetic background and other experimental conditions...|$|R

In this study the Imaging Riometer for Ionospheric Studies (IRIS) at <b>Halley,</b> Antarctica (76 <b>S,</b> 27 W) is shown to be capable of detecting short period mesospheric gravity waves using fluctuations of the ionospheric absorption of cosmic radio noise as a tracer.

A mechanism to overcome the limitation on resolvable wavelengths is presented. The effect of noise on the analysis results is also discussed. The application of this technique to extract gravity wave parameters from imaging riometer data is demonstrated by comparison with those derived from a co-located airglow imager. Extension of this technique could, in future, enable a climatology of year round mesospheric gravity wave properties over Antarctica to be derived.

40|$|Water vapour is {{a potent}} {{greenhouse}} gas, and the observed increases in water vapour in the stratosphere act to cool it. Possible changes in stratospheric temperatures are important for future ozone loss because colder temperatures in the edge region of the Antarctic ozone hole act to increase polar stratospheric clouds there, and so delay recovery of the ozone hole. Trends in lower-stratospheric temperature within {{the core of the}} Antarctic vortex in winter should be a unique indicator of trends in stratospheric water vapour, because neither changes in CO 2 nor in ozone have a large effect on temperature in the lower stratosphere in the dark. Here, measured stratospheric temperatures southward of 70 S in winter are presented and their quality and corrections discussed. The character and magnitude of the long-term changes at <b>Halley</b> (76 <b>S)</b> are similar from 100 to 70 hPa and at 50 hPa, whether corrected for sonde changes or not, and are also similar to those at other Antarctic sites. We found no significant trend in temperatures at Halley between 1960 and 2000, which is inconsistent with the change calculated from the trend in lower-stratospheric water vapour in northern hemisphere midlatitudes between 1960 and 2000. Over the shorter interval between 1980 and 2000 at Halley, the change in temperature was - 1. 8 +/- 0. 6 K, in agreement with the change calculated from the trend in stratospheric water vapour in northern hemisphere midlatitudes between 1980 and 2000. The differences between these periods are discussed in terms of: possible fortuitous agreement between 1980 and 2000; the poorer representation and quality of the measurements of stratospheric water vapour between 1960 and 1980; and a possible large variation in the rate of oxidation of CH 4 to H 2 O in the upper stratosphere between 1960 and 1980.

40|$|A {{curious and}} {{unexpected}} {{result of the}} impact of P/Shoemaker Levy 9 with Jupiter was the production of enormous amounts of molecular sulfur (S 2). Here we show that S 2 is the natural product of disequilibrium chemistry at low pressures in shocked Jovian air, its formation a byproduct of hydrogen recombination. The species observed by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) - S 2, CS 2, and H 2 S - imply that the G fragment penetrated the NH 4 SH cloud but did not reach the water table. A typical impact within or below the NH 4 SH clouds produces about 0. 03 - 0. 1 impactor masses of <b>S</b> 2. Because <b>comets</b> are relatively hydrogen-poor, SO 2, not S 2, is the major product of shocking a water-rich <b>comet,</b> while <b>S</b> 2, CS 2 and OCS are major products of a dessicated comet.

Lifelong learning (LLL) is a focal point of Dutch policy in relation to innovation, economic growth and social-cohesion. Prerequisite for LLL policy and implementation is knowledge of LLL participation of the working age population (18 - 64 years). Problem is that policy makers, government agencies and {{learning in}}stitutions only know the extent for formal LLL and not informal and non-formal LLL. This contribution represents the first large-scale study of participation in, barriers for and benefits of LLL in the Netherlands. Results show that in the Dutch labour force that younger workers {{make more use of}} LLL than older workers and those with higher levels of formal education participate more than those with lower levels. Perceived benefits include better job performance, keeping up with new knowledge, and better performance of new, job-related tasks Barriers include lack of time, inconvenient time and place of LLL-activities, cost of LLL-activities, and a lack of employer support.

40|$|Ices of {{mixtures}} {{of carbon dioxide}} and methanol have been studied in a range of temperatures relevant for star-forming regions, comets, polar caps of planets and satellites, and other solar system bodies. We have performed temperature-programmed desorption measurements and recorded IR spectra of various types of samples. The presence of two slightly different structures of CO 2 is manifest. A distorted CO 2 structure is characterized by bandshifts between 5 cm− 1 (ν 3) and 10 cm− 1 (ν 2) with respect to normal CO 2. If the samples are heated above 130 K, the distorted CO 2 sublimates and only the normal structure remains. The latter can stay trapped until the sublimation of crystalline methanol (150 K). The desorption energy (Ed ∼ 20 kJ mol− 1) of CO 2 from methanol ice, and the specific adsorption surface area (6 m 2 g− 1) of amorphous CH 3 OH ice, have been determined. CO 2 does not penetrate into crystalline ice. Whereas the desorption energy {{is similar to that of}} CO 2 /H 2 O samples, the specific surface of methanol is much smaller than that of amorphous solid water (ASW). The interaction of CO 2 molecules with water and methanol is similar but ices of CH 3 OH are much less porous than ASW. The inclusion of CO 2 into previously formed ices containing these two species would take place preferentially into ASW. However, in processes of simultaneous deposition, methanol ice can admit a larger amount of CO 2 than water ice. CO 2 /CH 3 OH ices formed by simultaneous deposition admit two orders of magnitude more CO 2 than sequentially deposited ices. These findings can have direct relevance to the interpretation of observations from protostellar environments (e. g., RAFGL 7009 <b>S)</b> and <b>comet</b> nuclei.
