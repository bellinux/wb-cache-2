Applying this method to the Tarim and Dzungar basins (NW China), we estimate the total Cenozoic solid-phase volume and mass of sediments stored to be 1358 ± 520 × 103 km 3 (36. 7 ± 14 × 1017 kg) and 172 ± 56 × 103 km 3 (4. 6 ± 1. 5 × 1017 kg) respectively. The reconstruction also enables us to detect two main pulses in the sedimentation. The first, around 17 Ma, affected only {{the northern part of the}} Tarim Basin (also known as the Kucha or Kuche Depression) at the foot of the Tien Shan Mountains and supports the idea that the presently active shortening regime in that range started at that time. The second, 5 to 6 Ma, affected most of the depositional areas of the region and may have an even greater geographical extent. Assuming local isostasy, we estimate the volume of shortening induced by the rotation of the Tarim block relative to Siberia and stored in the range and adjacent basins to be between 1. 15 × 106 and 4. 23 × 106 km 3. This corresponds to a clockwise rotation of between 2. 5 ° and 8. 7 °.

40|$|The ongoing eruptive {{cycle of}} Tungurahua volcano (Ecuador) since 1999 has been characterised by over 15  paroxysmal phases {{interrupted}} by periods of relative calm. Those phases included one Subplinian {{as well as}} several Strombolian and Vulcanian eruptions and they generated tephra fallouts, pyroclastic density currents (PDCs) and lava flows. The 1  February 2014 eruption occurred after 75  days of quiescence and only 2 days of pre-eruptive seismic crisis. Two short-lived Vulcanian explosions marked the onset of the paroxysmal phase, characterised by a 13. 4  km eruptive column and the trigger of PDCs. After 40  min of paroxysm, the activity evolved into sporadic Strombolian explosions with discrete ash emissions and continued for several weeks. Both tephra fall and PDCs were studied for their dispersal, sedimentology, volume and eruption source parameters. At large scale, the tephra cloud dispersed toward the SSW. Based on the field data, two dispersal scenarios were developed forming either elliptical <b>isopachs</b> or proximally PDC-influenced <b>isopachs.</b> The minimum bulk tephra volumes are estimated to 4. 55 [*]×[*] 10 6  m 3, for an eruption size estimated at volcanic explosivity index (VEI)   2 – 3.

The 1  February 2014 eruptions show a similar size to the late 1999 and August 2001 events, but with a higher intensity (I   9 – 10) and shorter duration.

Using {{the framework of the}} reconstruction of the ancient eruption of Mount Samalas, the first step was to map and analyze the deposits of volcanic sediment.

The results show that a combination of methods allowed to provide a high resolution map of the distribution of the thickness of the volcanic deposits, both on the slope and in alluvial areas. Geo-electric survey results (both Vertical Electric Sound (VES) and 2 D mapping) show consistent changes in the pattern of contrast resistivity layer interface, for all areas. The pattern changes in a row of the top layer, the high resistivity turned into the low. Furthermore, the second and third layer interface changes from low to the high resistivity. High resistivity on the top layer is interpreted as a layer of unconsolidated volcanic sediment.
