They join a ragtag travelling circus where Il Matto already works. Il Matto teases the strongman at every opportunity, though he cannot explain what motivates him to do so. After Il Matto drenches Zampanò with a pail of water, Zampanò chases after his tormentor with <b>his</b> <b>knife</b> drawn. As a result, he is briefly jailed and both men are eventually fired from the travelling circus.|$|E

5|$|Boone informs Locke he {{is tired}} of lying, and wants to tell Shannon about the hatch. Locke knocks him {{unconscious}} with the handle of <b>his</b> <b>knife,</b> and Boone awakes to find himself tied up. Locke applies a strange paste on Boone's head wound and leaves a knife embedded in {{the ground in front}} of Boone so he'll be able to free himself. Locke explains that he will be able to reach it once he is properly motivated. After several unsuccessful attempts to do so, Boone hears Shannon's screams and the sounds of the 'monster' approaching. This is the impetus he needs, and after a short struggle, and in excruciating pain, he is finally able to reach the weapon. He then frees himself and searches for his sister.|$|E

5|$|To defeat enemies, {{the player}} can use both regular and special attacks. The latter use up Special Attack Stars; the player starts {{the game with}} three, and can gain more {{throughout}} the game, which carry over between areas. The types of attacks and stats such as attack power and agility differ depending on the character: Jack Frost's standard attack is throwing snowballs, Jack Lantern's is shooting fire balls, while Jack Skelton uses <b>his</b> <b>knife.</b> Their special attacks are, respectively, freezing all enemies for a few seconds; dealing {{a large amount of}} damage to all enemies; and defeating all enemies that are visible on the screen. As the player explores the floors, they need to avoid being attacked by enemies or falling into traps: each time this happens, the remaining time limit decreases by five seconds. If the timer reaches zero, the player reaches a game over state, although they are given the option to restart {{from the beginning of the}} current area.|$|E
5|$|The porters {{abandon the}} group in fear when mysterious tracks are found, while Tintin, Haddock and Tharkey go on and {{eventually}} reach the crash site. Tintin sets off with Snowy to trace Chang's steps, and finds a cave where Chang has carved his name on a rock. On leaving the cave, he encounters a snowstorm and glimpses {{what seems to be}} a human silhouette. Tharkey believes that Tintin saw the Yeti and convinces him to abandon his friend and return with him to Nepal, since the area is too large to search. Tintin spots a scarf on a cliff face, concludes Chang is nearby, and continues with only the Captain. While attempting to scale a cliff face, Haddock slips and hangs out of reach, imperilling Tintin, who is tied to him. He tells Tintin to cut the rope to save himself, but Tintin refuses. Haddock tries to cut it himself, but drops <b>his</b> <b>knife,</b> alerting Tharkey, who has returned in time to rescue them. They try to camp for the night but lose their tent and must trek onwards, unable to sleep lest they freeze, arriving within sight of the Buddhist monastery of Khor-Biyong before being caught in an avalanche.|$|E
5|$|Snow and the Huntsman walk {{together}} in the forest, and she sees through his disguise and correctly guesses that he was sent by the Queen to kill her. Snow flees, but as the Huntsman catches up with her, he finds her writing a letter, which she requests he deliver to the queen after she is killed. The Huntsman takes out <b>his</b> <b>knife,</b> but instead of killing her, he fashions a whistle out of a bamboo stick, telling her that it will summon help and then telling her to run. The Huntsman then returns to the queen with a deer heart, hoping that she will not know the difference. The queen asks him to read her the letter, which is an apology for past wrongs {{as well as a}} request from Snow that her stepmother rule the kingdom with compassion. The queen burns the letter and takes the box with the heart in it to store in her vault. When she cannot open one of her storage safes, it proves that the Huntsman lied to her; the heart is not human. The Queen has her guards drag him down to the vault and she yanks his glowing heart out of his body. She tells the Huntsman that from now on he will be her pet and will do her bidding forever, and if he ever betrays her, all she has to do is squeeze.|$|E

50|$|Ek {{preferred}} <b>his</b> <b>knives</b> without crossguards {{for ease}} of concealment and for quick withdrawal as there was no crossguard to snag on clothing or a soldier's equipment. The grips on Ek's knives had eight scalloped groves:four on each of two grips. This gave the user such a good grip that John Ek found that a crossguard was not necessary to prevent the hand from sliding onto the blade. When questioned about this by the War Production Board, Ek greased his hand and plunged one of <b>his</b> <b>knives</b> into the wooden floor {{with such force that}} no one was able to pull it out.|$|R

5000|$|In 1830, Black {{made the}} famous Bowie knife for Jim Bowie {{who was already}} famous for knife-fighting from his 1827 sandbar duel. Bowie's killing of three assassins in Texas and his death at the Battle of the Alamo made him, and Black's knife, legends. After Bowie's death in 1836, Black did a brisk {{business}} selling <b>his</b> <b>knives</b> to pioneers bound for Texas. Everyone seemed to want [...] "Jim Bowie's knife." [...] Black forged <b>his</b> <b>knives</b> behind a leather curtain and kept his process a secret. Black's knives {{were known to be}} exceedingly tough yet flexible.

25|$|Through the 1820s and {{the turn}} of the decade, American {{settlers}} kept up pressure on the US government to remove the Seminole from Florida to make way for their desired agricultural development. In 1832, a few Seminole chiefs signed the Treaty of Payne's Landing, by which they agreed to give up their Florida lands in exchange for lands west of the Mississippi River in Indian Territory. According to legend, Osceola stabbed the treaty with <b>his</b> <b>knife,</b> although there are no contemporary reports of this.|$|E
25|$|The Sacrifice of Isaac first {{appears in}} Christian art in 4th century depictions from the Roman catacombs and sarcophagi, {{as well as}} pieces like a {{fragment}} from a marble table from Cyprus. Abraham is restrained by the hand, which in the Sarcophagus of Junius Bassus grasped <b>his</b> <b>knife</b> hand, as the angel often does in other depictions. However the angel mentioned in the biblical text is more usual, and often included as well. The use of the hand in this scene, at least in Christian art, indicates God's acceptance of the sacrifice, {{as well as his}} intervention to change it.|$|E
25|$|A statue {{was created}} for Logan Circle, Philadelphia in 1926, {{designed}} by Alexander Stirling Calder. It does not depict Shakespeare himself, but rather the figures of Touchstone the jester from As You Like It, representing comedy, and Hamlet, representing tragedy. Touchstone is lounging with his head tilted laughing, his feet hanging {{over the top of}} the tall stone pedestal and his left arm resting on Hamlet's legs. Hamlet is seated, brooding, <b>his</b> <b>knife</b> dangling over Touchstone's body. The opening lines of the famous All the world's a stage speech from As You Like It are inscribed on the pedestal beneath the figures.|$|E

Dismounting, he approached the bear and fired a shot into its head, but the bullet ricocheted off its skull, infuriating it. The bear attacked, crushing Hickok with its body. Hickok managed to fire another shot, wounding the bear's paw. The bear then grabbed his arm in its mouth, but Hickok was able to grab <b>his</b> <b>knife</b> and slash its throat, killing it.|$|E

25|$|The {{remains of}} Columbanus are {{preserved}} in the crypt at Bobbio Abbey. Many miracles have been credited to his intercession.

25|$|Recent DNA {{analyses}} {{claim they}} revealed traces of blood {{from at least}} four other people on his gear: one from <b>his</b> <b>knife,</b> two from the same arrowhead, and a fourth from his coat. Interpretations of these findings were that Ötzi killed two people with the same arrow, {{and was able to}} retrieve it on both occasions, and the blood on his coat was from a wounded comrade he may have carried over his back. Ötzi's posture in death (frozen body, face down, left arm bent across the chest) could support a theory that before death occurred and rigor mortis set in, the Iceman was turned onto his stomach in the effort to remove the arrow shaft.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the levels, {{the aim is}} {{to avoid}} an {{encounter}} with any enemies, and complete the level by grabbing the golden key inside one of the rooms and then leaving back through the entrance again.
