500|$|Mikael Wood of Los Angeles Times {{stated that}} [...] "Cabaret" [...] is a [...] "percolating bedroom jam that depicts sex {{as a form}} of at-home theater". Boston Globes Sarah Rodman called the song a [...] "sexed-up jam". HitFix's Melinda Newman {{described}} the song as a [...] "loop-driven to getting <b>down</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> lady, who’s taking off her clothes as quickly as she can". According to Eric Henderson of Slant Magazine, in [...] "Cabaret", Timberlake compares the love to a burlesque and noted that the song resembles producer Timbaland's earlier work. Andy Kellman of Allmusic wrote that the song features Timbaland's signature sound and finds Timberlake proclaiming more [...] "clever/nauseating" [...] lyrics: [...] "If sex is a contest, then you're coming first"; [...] "'Cause I got you saying Jesus so much, it's like we're laying in a manger." [...] The chorus is consisted of Timberlake singing [...] "It's a cabaret" [...] while being accompanied by Timbaland, who repeats [...] "Put on a show, get on the floor". According to Stern, in his part with a duration about two minutes, Drake raps raunchy and fast-talking lines, [...] "I’mma fuck you like we’re having an affair". Nick Krewen of Toronto Star wrote that Drake raps lines [...] "about a sexual tête-à-tête amidst a melee of scattershot rhythms".|$|E
2500|$|Another {{highlight}} in {{the debate}} happened when candidates were asked by Chris Matthews {{if they need to}} go to Congress to get authorization to take military action against Iran's nuclear facilities, if they were president of the United States. While Hunter, Huckabee, McCain, Thompson and Giuliani replied they would not obtain Congressional authorization if there was an imminent threat from Iran. Romney replied, [...] "You sit <b>down</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> attorneys and (they) tell you what you have to do..." [...] Paul advocated obtaining Congressional authorization, which he claimed is mandated by the US Constitution.|$|E
2500|$|Tacitus {{also wrote}} of Suetonius {{addressing}} his legionaries: [...] "Ignore the racket made by these savages. There are {{more women than}} men in their ranks. They are not soldiers—they're not even properly equipped. We've beaten them before and when they see our weapons and feel our spirit, they'll crack. Stick together. Throw the javelins, then push forward: knock them <b>down</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> shields and finish them off with your swords. Forget about plunder. Just win and you'll have everything." [...] Although Tacitus, like many historians of his day, was given to invent stirring speeches for such occasions, Suetonius's speech here is unusually blunt and practical. Tacitus's father-in-law, the future governor Gnaeus Julius Agricola, was on Suetonius's staff at the time and may have reported it fairly accurately.|$|E

6000|$|... "I suppose," [...] he admitted, [...] "I should {{reconcile}} {{myself to}} the inevitable. Times {{are going to be}} different. I dare say that Aaron will be the only secretary I shall need. But will she go? Remember, she is a woman of the people. I think that she will never settle <b>down,</b> even <b>with</b> <b>your</b> splendid work to control. She is less a poet than a humanitarian." ...|$|R

2500|$|The three spirit souls {{are located}} beneath the liver. They look like {{human beings and}} wear green robes with yellow inner garments. Every month on the third, thirteenth, and twenty-third, they leave the body at night to go {{wandering}} about. At this time, lie <b>down</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> feet up, your head supported by a pillow, and your legs stretched out straight. Fold your hands over your heart, close your eyes, and hold your breath. Clap your teeth three times. Now visualize a red energy in your heart {{about the size of}} an egg. It emerges from the heart and rises into the throat, from where it spreads a wondrous radiance that envelopes your entire body to grow into a glowing fire all around it. You should feel the body getting quite warm. At that point, call out their names: [...] "Spirit Guidance—come to succor me! Inner Radiance—come to nurture me! Dark Essence—come to protect my life!

[...] But all the hollows are as dry as the hill tops. There is not a brook, or the mark of a watercourse, in one of them. You are like the Ancient Mariner in the poem, with ...|$|R

5000|$|Vague {{impressions}} of something indefinable {{have no place}} in the rationalistic system.... Nevertheless, if we look on man's whole mental life as it exists ..., we have to confess that the part of it of which rationalism can give an account of is relatively superficial.
