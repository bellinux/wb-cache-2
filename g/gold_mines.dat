5|$|The Panic of 1893 {{caused the}} price of silver to crash; the gold price, however, {{remained}} fixed, as the United States was on the gold standard. The influx of silver miners into the <b>gold</b> <b>mines</b> caused a lowering of wages. Mine owners demanded longer hours for less pay.|$|E
5|$|Compared {{to other}} parts of Latin America, slavery played a much lesser role in the {{development}} of the Argentine economy, mostly because of the absence of <b>gold</b> <b>mines</b> and sugar plantations, which would have demanded huge numbers of slave workers. Colonial Brazil, for example, imported as many as 2.5 million Africans in the 18th century. By contrast, an estimated 100,000 African slaves arrived at the port of Buenos Aires in the 17th and 18th centuries, and many were destined for Paraguay, Chile and Bolivia.|$|E
5|$|As the Great Depression hit the United States, Fairbanks bucked {{the poor}} {{economic}} trend. Thanks to the Alaska Railroad, large gold dredges {{could be brought}} in, and these returned the area's <b>gold</b> <b>mines</b> to profitability. In 1938, Lathrop {{took advantage of the}} good economic situation by reviving the Alaska Miner as a weekly supplement to the News-Miner. The Miner covered happenings in the gold-mining camps outside Fairbanks and was focused on areas outside the city. In 1939, Fairbanks radio station KFAR was founded, and it shared the Lathrop building with the News-Miner, which occupied the bottom floors of the building.|$|E

5|$|In mid-1943 the District Engineer of the Manhattan Engineer District, Lt-Col Kenneth Nichols {{had several}} queries from Canada {{relating}} to contracts Canadian firms Eldorado <b>Gold</b> <b>Mines</b> and Consolidated Mining and Smelting (CMS of Cominco) {{had for the}} secret atomic bomb project; CMS was building a heavy water plant and Eldorado was mining and processing uranium ore. He phoned a C. D. Howe in Ottawa and arranged to travel on the overnight train to Ottawa and see Howe the next day (June 14). On arriving at the address given Nichols {{was surprised to find}} that Howe was the minister of munitions and supply, and found him most friendly. Howe was told about the Manhattan Project, and Nichols was told that Eldorado was now a Crown company.|$|E
5|$|The 1955 Freedom Charter, which Mandela {{had helped}} create, {{called for the}} {{nationalisation}} of banks, <b>gold</b> <b>mines</b> and land, to ensure equal distribution of wealth. Despite these beliefs, Mandela initiated a programme of privatisation during his presidency in line with trends in other countries of the time. It has been repeatedly suggested that Mandela {{would have preferred to}} develop a social democratic economy in South Africa but that this was not feasible {{as a result of the}} international political and economic situation during the early 1990s. This decision was in part influenced by the fall of the socialist states in the Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc during the early 1990s.|$|E
5|$|The Iazyges, Quadi, Suebi and Marcomanni {{once again}} invaded Roman {{territory}} in 169. The Iazyges led an invasion into Alburnum, {{in an attempt}} to seize its <b>gold</b> <b>mines.</b> Marcus Claudius Fronto, a former general during the Parthian wars, then the governor of both Dacia and Upper Moesia, held them back for some time but was killed in battle in 170. The Quadi were the first to surrender, in 172. The known terms of the peace are that Marcus Aurelius installed a client king, Furtius, on their throne, and the Quadi were denied access to the Roman markets along the limes. The Marcomanni accepted a similar peace, but the name of their client-king is not known.|$|E

5|$|The Portuguese {{government}} forced black Mozambican {{farmers to}} grow rice or cotton for export, providing little return {{with which the}} farmers could support themselves. Many other workers—over 250,000 by 1960—were pressured to work on coal and <b>gold</b> <b>mines,</b> in neighbouring territories, mainly in South Africa, where they comprised over 30% of black underground miners. By 1950, only 4,353 Mozambicans out of 5,733,000 had been granted {{the right to vote}} by the Portuguese colonial government. The rift between Portuguese settlers and Mozambican locals is illustrated in one way by the small number of people with mixed Portuguese and Mozambican heritage (mestiço), numbering only 31,465 in a population of 8–10 million in 1960 according to that year's census.|$|E
5|$|The main {{mining regions}} of the Empire were the Iberian Peninsula (gold, silver, copper, tin, lead); Gaul (gold, silver, iron); Britain (mainly iron, lead, tin), the Danubian provinces (gold, iron); Macedonia and Thrace (gold, silver); and Asia Minor (gold, silver, iron, tin). Intensive {{large-scale}} mining—of alluvial deposits, and by means of open-cast mining and underground mining—took place from the reign of Augustus up to the early 3rd century AD, when the instability of the Empire disrupted production. The <b>gold</b> <b>mines</b> of Dacia, for instance, were no longer available for Roman exploitation after the province was surrendered in 271. Mining seems to have resumed to some extent during the 4th century.|$|E
5|$|Also in 1906, {{following}} an ordination ceremony held on Easter Sunday, Agârbiceanu was appointed parish priest in Bucium, in the Apuseni Mountains. For four years, he observed the difficult {{lives of the}} mountain dwellers and the problems encountered in the nearby <b>gold</b> <b>mines.</b> During this time, he wrote several notices in the magazine Ramuri, later published as În întuneric ("Into the Darkness", 1910), the novella Fefeleaga, and the novel Arhangelii ("The Archangels"), all of them based on the mining experience. He also started writing frequently for literary magazines that included Luceafărul, Unirea and Lupta. His other literary works of the period include De la țară ("From the Countryside", 1906), În clasa cultă ("In the Cultured Class", 1909), Două iubiri ("Two Loves", 1910), Prăpastia ("The Abyss", 1912), {{and a collection of}} Schițe și povestiri ("Sketches and Short Stories", 1912).|$|E

5|$|Britain's key {{argument}} was that (prior to Venezuela's independence) Spain {{had not taken}} effective possession of the disputed territory, and said that in fact the local Indians had had alliances with the Dutchs, giving the Dutch a sphere of influence which the British acquired in 1814. After fifty-five days of hearings, the arbitrators retired for six days. The American arbitrators found the British argument preposterous, since American Indians had never been considered to have any sovereignty. However the British had the advantage that Martens wanted a unanimous decision, and the British threatened to ignore the award if it didn't suit them. They were also able to argue a loss of equity, since {{under the terms of}} the treaty lands occupied for fifty years would receive title – and a number of British <b>gold</b> <b>mines</b> would be narrowly lost to this cutoff if their lands were awarded to Venezuela.|$|E
5|$|Sitting in Paris, the Tribunal of Arbitration {{finalized}} {{its decision}} on 3 October 1899. The award was unanimous, but gave no {{reasons for the}} decision, merely describing the resulting boundary, which gave Britain almost 90% of the disputed territory. The Schomburgk Line was, with small deviations, re-established as the border between British Guiana and Venezuela. The first deviation from the Schomburgk line was that Venezuela's territory included Barima Point {{at the mouth of}} the Orinoco, giving it undisputed control of the river, and thus the ability to levy duties on Venezuelan commerce. The second was drawing the border at the Wenamu River rather than the Cuyuni River, giving Venezuela a substantial territory east of the line – territory which Britain had originally refused to include in the arbitration. However, Britain received most of the disputed territory, and all of the <b>gold</b> <b>mines.</b>|$|E
5|$|The British {{relief of}} Kimberley and Ladysmith in February 1900 marked the turning {{of the war}} against the Boers. Morale {{plummeted}} among the commandos over the following months, with many burghers simply going home; Kruger toured the front in response and asserted that any man who deserted in this time of need should be shot. He had hoped for large numbers of Cape Afrikaners to rally to the republican cause, but only small bands did so, along with a few thousand foreign volunteers (principally Dutchmen, Germans and Scandinavians). When British troops entered Bloemfontein on 13 March 1900 Reitz and others urged Kruger to destroy the <b>gold</b> <b>mines,</b> but he refused on the grounds that this would obstruct rehabilitation after the war. Mafeking was relieved two months later and on 30 May Lord Roberts took Johannesburg. Kruger left Pretoria on 29 May, travelling by train to Machadodorp, and on 2 June the government abandoned the capital. Roberts entered three days later.|$|E

5|$|Ceredigion {{has been}} {{inhabited}} since prehistoric times: 170 hill forts and enclosures {{have been identified}} across the county {{and there are many}} standing stones dating back to the Bronze Age. Around the time of the Roman invasion of Britain, the area was between the realms of the Demetae and Ordovices. The Sarn Helen road ran through the territory, with forts at Bremia and Loventium protecting <b>gold</b> <b>mines</b> near present-day Llelio. Following the Roman withdrawal, Irish raids and invasions were repulsed, supposedly by the forces under a northerner named Cunedda. The 9th-century History of the Britons attributed to Nennius records that Cunedda's son Ceredig settled the area around the Teifi in the 5th century. The territory supposedly remained a minor kingdom under his dynasty until its extinction upon the drowning of Gwgon ap Meurig , after which it was administered by Rhodri Mawr of Gwynedd before passing to his son Cadell, whose son Hywel Dda inherited its neighbouring kingdom Dyfed and established the realm of Deheubarth. Records are highly obscure; some historians believe that Hyfaidd ap Bledrig, the Dyfed ruler, may have annexed Ceredigion before his heirs lost it to Hywel through war.|$|E
5|$|Egypt {{is rich in}} {{building}} and decorative stone, copper and lead ores, gold, and semiprecious stones. These natural resources allowed the ancient Egyptians to build monuments, sculpt statues, make tools, and fashion jewelry. Embalmers used salts from the Wadi Natrun for mummification, which also provided the gypsum needed to make plaster. Ore-bearing rock formations were found in distant, inhospitable wadis in the eastern desert and the Sinai, requiring large, state-controlled expeditions to obtain natural resources found there. There were extensive <b>gold</b> <b>mines</b> in Nubia, {{and one of the}} first maps known is of a gold mine in this region. The Wadi Hammamat was a notable source of granite, greywacke, and gold. Flint was the first mineral collected and used to make tools, and flint handaxes are the earliest pieces of evidence of habitation in the Nile valley. Nodules of the mineral were carefully flaked to make blades and arrowheads of moderate hardness and durability even after copper was adopted for this purpose. Ancient Egyptians were among the first to use minerals such as sulfur as cosmetic substances.|$|E
5|$|In the 1840s, {{thousands}} of settlers, attracted {{in part by}} the lure of free land, began emigrating west over the Oregon Trail. Leaving drought, worn-out farms, and economic problems behind, they emigrated from states like Missouri, Illinois, and Iowa in the Midwest to Oregon, especially the Willamette Valley {{in the western part of}} the state. After passage of the Homestead Act of 1862 and the discovery of gold in the upper John Day basin, a fraction of these newcomers abandoned the Willamette Valley in favor of eastern Oregon. Some established villages and engaged in subsistence farming and ranching near streams. Settlement was made more practical by a supply route from The Dalles on the Columbia River to <b>gold</b> <b>mines</b> at Canyon City in the upper John Day valley. By the late 1860s, the route became formalized as The Dalles Military Road, which passed along Bridge Creek and south of Sheep Rock. Clashes between natives and non-natives and the desire of the U.S. Government to populate the region with Euro-Americans led to the gradual removal of native residents to reservations, including three in north-central Oregon: Warm Springs, Burns Paiute, and Umatilla.|$|E

5|$|His brother Howard Burnham (1870–1918), born {{shortly before}} {{the family moved to}} Los Angeles, lost one leg at the age of 14 and {{suffered}} from tuberculosis. During his teenage years he lived with Fred in California and learned from his brother the art of Scoutcraft, how to shoot, and how to ride the range, all in spite of his wooden leg. Howard moved to Africa, became a mining engineer in the Johannesburg <b>gold</b> <b>mines,</b> and later wrote a text book on Modern Mine Valuation. He traveled the world and for a time teamed up with Fred on Yaqui River irrigation project in Mexico. During World War I, Howard worked as a spy for the French government, operating behind enemy lines in southwest Germany. Throughout the war he used his wooden leg to conceal tools he needed for spying. From his death bed, Howard returned to France via Switzerland and shared his vital data and secrets with the French government: the Germans were not opening a new front in the Alps and {{there was no need to}} move allied troops away from the Western Front. Howard was buried at Cannes, France, leaving behind his wife and four children.
