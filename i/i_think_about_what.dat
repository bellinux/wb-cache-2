Roberts claimed that the hardest aspect of being with the group was the media attention - which would constantly pick out flaws with her image.

The album was inspired by her time performing with Girls Aloud - [...] "It would have been stupid for me to make an album that meant nothing." [...] For Roberts the album was about making a risky record, where there wasn't a guaranteed commercial success, explaining to The Guardian: [...] "It's taken every last bit of confidence just to release this record, or maybe I've just brainwashed myself into feeling more confident.

40|$|Teaching, {{researching and}} leading in the {{classroom}} and school community is largely an intuitive action. However, it can also be seen as scripted to some extent. Educators have plans that they first visualize and then attempt to predict on paper what may happen in the teaching environment. Planning in any manner requires a person to see within the mind’s eye. Once detailed on paper the teaching act usually follows and that is when unpredictability and reflection surfaces. In my class, this surfacing often occurs in the midst of acting, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> has just happened in a cognitive sense.

40|$|Usually when I'm given a role, I've already {{imagined}} myself {{playing the}} part.

But for Eddie Fuseli, I could not picture it. I couldn't picture my woman's body, my woman's voice and my woman's demeanor repackaged into a dead-faced, chain-smoking, catlike Italian gangster. The prospect of morphing into Eddie seemed impossible. I was terrified. I dreaded starting rehearsal - everyone would see how pathetic, how clueless, how ridiculous I was in attempting to play this part. 	Rehearsals did start and indeed, they were painful. Eddie's lines {{would come out of}} my mouth and instantly I'd feel ashamed. Everything felt wrong. I didn't sound like a man. I didn't look like a man. Completely lost, I pressed delete on everything I was working on and returned to the basics. To the breaking down of the body that we learned in Charlie's class. How does this man walk? To the archetypes. How high status is he? To the essential movements. How does he put his hand in his pocket? Slowly, I began to build Eddie using different parts of my body. As my corporal decisions became clearer, the manliness that I thought I'd never have began to emerge. And after that came the authority. The confidence. The nasal Italian drawl. Even some other surprising qualities began to surface: my Eddie was quick. Slick. Sharp. Though at the beginning I wasn't able to picture the final product, he managed to materialize through the structure I created with my own body, the same one I was convinced would fail me. It's empowering knowing that my body is always here for me in this art, and that it can change shape in ways I cannot even imagine...|$|E

40|$|Our {{chairman}} has wisely {{asked that}} we not spend all of our time here telling each other about our bird problems. In the Southeast, our difficulties with blackbirds are based upon the same bird habits that cause trouble elsewhere: they flock, they roost and they eat, generally {{taking advantage of the}} readily available handouts that today 2 ̆ 7 s agricul¬tural practices provide. Those of us {{on the receiving end of}} these de¬predations of course think that damage in our own particular area must be far the worst, anywhere. Because of the location of our meeting place today, perhaps it is worthwhile to point out that a report prepared by our Bureau 2 ̆ 7 s Washington office this year outlined the problem of blackbird damage to corn in the Middle Atlantic States, the Great Lakes Region and in Florida, and then followed with this statement [...] 2 ̆ 2 An equally serious problem occurs in rice and grain sorghum fields of Arkansas, Mississippi, Texas and Louisiana. 2 ̆ 2 The report also men¬tions that the largest winter concentrations of blackbirds are found in the lower Mississippi Valley. Our 1963 - 64 blackbird-starling survey showed 43 principal roosts totaling approximately 100 million of these birds in Virginia, the Carolinas, Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee and Kentucky. We have our own birds during the summer plus the 2 ̆ 2 tourist 2 ̆ 2 birds from up here and elsewhere during the winter, and all of these birds must eat, so suffice it to say that we, too, have some bird problems in the Southeast. I 2 ̆ 7 m sure you 2 ̆ 7 re more interested in what we 2 ̆ 7 re doing about them. To keep this in perspective also, please bear in mind that against the magnitude of these problems, our blackbird control research staff at Gainesville consists of 3 biologists, 1 biochemist and one technician. And unfortunately, none of us happens to be a miracle worker. I think, though, we have made great progress toward solving the bird problems in the Southeast for the man-hours that have been expended in this re¬search. My only suggestion to those who are impatient about not having more answers is that they examine the budget that has been set up for this work. Only then could we intelligently discuss what might be expected as a reasonable rate of research progress. When <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> we have accomplished in a short span of time, with very small expenditure, I can assure you that I am very proud of our small research crew at Gainesville [...] and I say this quite sincerely. At the Gainesville station, we work under two general research approaches to the bird damage problem. These projects have been assigned to us. The first is research on management of birds, particularly blackbirds and starlings destructive to crops or in feedlots, and, secondly, the development and the adaptation of those chemical compounds found to be toxic to birds but relatively safe to mammals. These approaches both require laboratory and field work that is further subdivided into several specific research projects. Without describing the details of these now, I want to mention some of our recent results. From the results, I 2 ̆ 7 m sure you will gather the general objectives and some of the procedures used...|$|E
