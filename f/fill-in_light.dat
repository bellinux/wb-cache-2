5000|$|In modern photography, the <b>fill-in</b> <b>light</b> is used {{to control}} the {{contrast}} in the scene and is nearly always placed above the lens axis and is a large light source (think of the sky behind your head when taking a photograph). As the amount of light {{is less than the}} key-light (main-light), the fill acts by lifting the shadows only (particularly relevant in digital photography where the noise lives in the shadows). It is true to say that light bounces around a room and fills in the shadows but {{this does not mean that}} a fill-light should be placed opposite a key-light (main-light) and it does not soften shadows, it lifts them. The relative intensity (ratio) of the Key-light to the fill-light is most easily discussed in terms of [...] "Stops" [...] difference (where a Stop is a doubling or halving of the intensity of light). A 2 Stop reduction in intensity for the Fill-Light would be a typical start point to maintain dimensionality (modelling) in a portrait (head and shoulder) shot..|$|E

" Here pose for a brief lesson in {{graduated}} lighting. Picture No. 1 is a view illuminated by full-subject lighting. In No. 2 the <b>fill-in</b> <b>light</b> has been turned off. All lights are now above the subject-note harsh below hairline and eyebrows. ...|$|E
2500|$|Headlamps are {{a useful}} adjunct to bicycle lights. [...] They can be pointed without {{steering}} the bike, giving useful <b>fill-in</b> <b>lighting</b> especially on poor or very dark roads. [...] They have the added safety benefit of positioning the light {{higher on the}} cyclist for increased visibility. [...] They also allow the wearer to read road and directional signs placed on high signposts. However, due to the high position of the light the glare may dazzle oncoming traffic.|$|R
40|$|On {{the basis}} of a {{research}} conducted within a Tunisian context and through a large survey made up of 600 shoppers, this research aims to enhance the shopping orientation literature. The findings highlight two main points: (1) the predominance of utilitarian motivation at the expense of experiential ones and (2) the identification of a typology resetting on four shopping trips classes: the planned shopping trip, the recreational shopping trip, the <b>lights</b> <b>fill-in</b> shopping trip, and the ordinary fill-in shopping trip. Consequently and {{in the light of the}} shopping trip types and the socio-demographic shoppers factor, our research attempt to advance a Tunisian shoppersâ€™ profile typology. </p...|$|R
40|$|A new sorbent material, barium sulfate-Direct Blending Yellow D- 3 RNL hybrid (BSD), was {{synthesized}} and {{characterized by}} various methods. Both the anionic dyes, Reactive Brilliant Red X- 3 B and Weak Acid Green GS were hardly adsorbed by the BSD material, while the sorption of Ethyl Violet (EV) and Victoria Blue B were extremely obvious. The sorption of cationic dyes obeyed the Langmuir isotherm model, which {{depended on the}} electric charge attraction. The saturation amount of EV adsorbed onto the BSD material approached to 39. 36 mg/g. The sorption of EV changed little with pH from 3 to 12 while it increased with increasing levels of electrolyte. A dye wastewater sampled from Jinjiang Chemicals was treated, and the color removal rate {{was more than the}} COD removal rate. In addition, the cationic dye-BSD sludge was utilized as a colorant <b>fill-in</b> coating. The <b>light</b> stability and thermal stability of the colorant was measured and exhibited good features. This work provided a simple and eco-friendly method for dye wastewater treatment with recycling of waste...|$|R
