Majority of {{wheelchair}} users experience upper-body muscular weakness, resulting from neuromuscular diseases, which limit their ability to perform common activities of daily living. A Wheelchair Mounted Robotic Arm (WMRA) will assist these individuals to eat, drink, and move objects as needed. This paper presents {{the design of a}} new WMRA as well as the analysis of its function. The design is side-mounted onto either a normal or power wheelchair, and incorporates a slim profile to allow ease of passage through doorways and be otherwise unobtrusive.

The mechanical design utilizes a belt and pulley system for remote actuation of each joint, driven by DC <b>Gearmotors</b> located in the base of the arm. This helps to shift the weight closer to the wheelchair and to maintain the required speed, torque and inertia while actively driving each joint of the robot.

40|$|In {{this paper}} a lumped {{parameters}} numerical model isreviewed {{to study the}} meshing process of external gearpumps and motors, {{with the aim of}} highlighting theinfluence of some geometrical design parameters andoperating conditions on inter-teeth volumes pressures. The inter-teeth space is modeled adopting a two-volumeapproach, properly tailored both for the pump and for themotor units behavior description. In both cases, thecommunications between the interconnected inter-teethvolumes and the high and low pressure ports aresketched as variable equivalent turbulent restrictors; flowareas have been determined as functions of the gearsand of the meshing grooves main design parameters. The inter-teeth pressures, and the leakage flows, arecalculated solving the incompressible and isothermalcontinuity equation, contemporarily applied to bothvolumes and properly combined with the classicalturbulent orifice equation. Successively, for a referenceoperating condition, properly chosen for underlining theinter-teeth meshing cycle and corresponding to a verylow pressure load, the meshing processes of an externalgear pump and of an external gear motor are compared. Among others, the attention is focused on the behaviorof those hydraulic variables more conditioning themeshing cycle, and the differences rising up in interteethpressure peaks and in cavitation interval amplitudeand angular positioning are evidenced. Then, themeshing process analysis is expanded to cover theexternal gear units common operating field, both interms of rotational speed (from 500 to 3000 rpm) and interms of the high pressure port value (from 10 to 250 bar). In all cases, the general trend shows that cavitationhas a deeper influence on external gear pumpsoperation, while external gear motors are subjected tomore significant pressure peaks, particularly markedduring the low pressure part of the meshing cycle.

40|$|Although {{the cost}} of solar {{technology}} has been reduced by nearly seventy {{percent in the last}} ten years, {{the cost of}} implementing solar panels for residential and commercial use has remained stagnant.

40|$|Ultrasonic/sonic rotary-hammer drill (USRoHD) is {{a recent}} {{addition}} to the collection of apparatuses based on ultrasonic/sonic drill corer (USDC). As described below, the USRoHD has several features, not present in a basic USDC, that increase efficiency and provide some redundancy against partial failure. USDCs and related apparatuses were conceived for boring into, and/or acquiring samples of, rock or other hard, brittle materials of geological interest. They have been described in numerous previous NASA Tech Briefs articles. To recapitulate: A USDC {{can be characterized as}} a lightweight, lowpower, piezoelectrically driven jackhammer in which ultrasonic and sonic vibrations are generated and coupled to a tool bit. A basic USDC includes a piezoelectric stack, an ultrasonic transducer horn connected to the stack, a free mass (free {{in the sense that it}} can bounce axially a short distance between hard stops on the horn and the bit), and a tool bit. The piezoelectric stack creates ultrasonic vibrations that are mechanically amplified by the horn. The bouncing of the free mass between the hard stops generates the sonic vibrations. The combination of ultrasonic and sonic vibrations gives rise to a hammering action (and a resulting chiseling action at the tip of the tool bit) that is more effective for drilling than is the microhammering action of ultrasonic vibrations alone. The hammering and chiseling actions are so effective that unlike in conventional twist drilling, little applied axial force is needed to make the apparatus advance into the material of interest. There are numerous potential applications for USDCs and related apparatuses in geological exploration on Earth and on remote planets. In early USDC experiments, it was observed that accumulation of cuttings in a drilled hole causes the rate of penetration of the USDC to decrease steeply with depth, and that the rate of penetration can be increased by removing the cuttings. The USRoHD concept provides for removal of cuttings in the same manner as that of a twist drill: An USRoHD includes a USDC and a motor with gearhead (see figure). The USDC provides the bit hammering and the motor provides the bit rotation. Like a twist drill bit, the shank of the tool bit of the USRoHD is fluted. As in the operation of a twist drill, the rotation of the fluted drill bit removes cuttings from the drilled hole. The USRoHD tool bit is tipped with a replaceable crown having cutting teeth on its front surface. The teeth are shaped to promote fracturing of the rock face through a combination of hammering and rotation of the tool bit. Helical channels on the outer cylindrical surface of the crown serve as a continuation of the fluted surface of the shank, helping to remove cuttings. In the event of a failure of the USDC, the USRoHD can continue to operate with reduced efficiency as a twist drill. Similarly, in the event of a failure of the <b>gearmotor,</b> the USRoHD can continue to operate with reduced efficiency as a USDC...|$|E
40|$|Small scale {{unmanned}} aircraft, such as quadrotors, {{that are}} quickly emerging as versatile tools {{for a wide}} range of applications including search and rescue, hazardous environment exploration, or just shooting great video, are known as micro air vehicles (MAVs). However, for millimeter scale vehicles with weights under 10 grams, conventional flight technologies become greatly inefficient and instead inspiration is drawn from biology. Flapping wing MAVs (FWMAVs) have been created based on insects and hummingbirds in an effort to emulate their extreme agility and ability to hover in place. FWMAVs possess unique capabilities in terms of maneuverability, small size, and ability to operate in dynamic environments that make them particularly well suited for environmental monitoring and swarm applications such as artificial crop pollination. Despite their advantages, significant challenges in fabrication, power, and control must be overcome in order to make FWMAVs a reliable platform. Current designs suffer from high mechanical complexity and often rely on off-board power, sensing, and control, which compromises their autonomy and limits practical applications. The goal of my research is to develop a simple FWMAV design that provides high efficiency and controllability. An efficient, simple, and controllable vehicle design is developed utilizing the principles of resonance, emulation of biological flight control, and under-actuation. A highly efficient, resonant actuator is achieved by attaching a spring in parallel to the output shaft of a commercial geared DC micro-motor. This actuator directly drives the wings of the vehicle, allowing them to be controlled precisely and independently. This direct control strategy emulates biology and differs from other FWMAV designs that utilize complicated transmissions to generate flapping from rotary motor output. Direct control of the wings allows for emulation of biological wing kinematics, resulting in control based on wing motion alone. Furthermore, under-actuation is employed to mimic the rotational motion of insect wings. A rotational joint is added between the motor and wing membrane such that the wing rotates passively in response to aerodynamic forces that are generated as the wing is driven. This design is realized in several stages, initial prototyping, simulation and development of the actuator and wings, then finally a control system is developed. First the system was modeled and improved experimentally in order to achieve lift off. Improvements to the actuator were realized through component variation and custom fabrication increasing torque and power density by 161. 1 % and 666. 8 % respectively compared to the <b>gearmotor</b> alone and increased the resonant operating frequency of the vehicle from 4 Hz to 23 Hz. Advances in wing fabrication allowed for flexible wings that increased translational lift production by 35. 3 %, aerodynamic efficiency by 41. 3 %, and the effective lift coefficient by 63. 7 % with dynamic twisting. A robust control architecture was then developed iteratively based on a date driven system model in order to increase flight time from 1 second (10 wing strokes) to over 10 seconds (230 wing strokes). The resulting design improves lift to weight by 166 %, allowing for a payload capacity of approximately 8. 7 g and offers the potential for fully autonomous operation with all necessary components included on-board. A thermal model for micro-motors was developed and tuned to accurately predict an upper limit of system operation of 41 seconds as well as to optimize a heatsink that increases operating time by 102. 4 %...|$|E
