5|$|Between 4500 and 3800 BCE, {{all of the}} British Isles came {{to abandon}} its former Mesolithic {{hunter-gatherer}} lifestyle, {{to be replaced by}} the new agricultural subsistence of the Neolithic Age. Although a common material culture was shared throughout most of the British Isles in this period, there was great regional variation regarding the nature and distribution of settlement, architectural styles, and the use of natural resources. Throughout most of Britain, there is little evidence of cereal or permanent dwellings from this period, leading archaeologists to believe that the Early Neolithic economy on the island was largely pastoral, relying on herding cattle, with people living a nomadic or semi-nomadic way of life. Although witnessing some land clearance, Britain was largely forested in this period, and it is unclear what level of deforestation the area of Kent had experienced in the Early Neolithic; widespread forest clearance only took place on the chalklands of south-east Britain in the Late Bronze Age. <b>Environmental</b> <b>data</b> from the area around the White Horse Stone supports the idea that the area was still largely forested in the Early Neolithic, covered by a woodland of oak, ash, hazel/alder and Maloideae.|$|E

40|$|<b>Environmental</b> sensing <b>data</b> provide crucial {{information}} for environment-related decision-making. Formal {{data are provided}} by official environmental institutes. Beyond those, however, {{there is a growing}} body of so-called informal sensing data, which are contributed by citizens using low-cost sensors. How good are these informal data, and how might they be applied, next to formal <b>environmental</b> sensing <b>data?</b> Could both types of sensing data be gainfully integrated? This paper presents the results of an online survey investigating perceptions within citizen science communities, environmental institutes and their networks of formal and informal <b>environmental</b> sensing <b>data.</b> The results show that citizens and experts had different views of formal and informal <b>environmental</b> sensing <b>data,</b> particularly on measurement frequency and the data information provision power. However, there was agreement, too, for example, on the accuracy of formal <b>environmental</b> sensing <b>data.</b> Furthermore, both agreed that the integration of formal and informal <b>environmental</b> sensing <b>data</b> offered potential for improvements on several aspects, particularly spatial coverage, data quantity and measurement frequency. Interestingly, the accuracy of informal <b>environmental</b> sensing <b>data</b> was largely unknown to both experts and citizens. This suggests the need for further investigation of informal <b>environmental</b> sensing <b>data</b> and the potential for its effective integration with formal <b>environmental</b> sensing <b>data,</b> if hurdles like standardisation can be overcome...|$|R

25|$|When {{investigating}} sites, ATSDR examines <b>environmental</b> <b>data,</b> health data, {{and information}} from community members {{about how the}} site affects their quality of life. ATSDR normally does not collect its own environmental data; rather, it usually relies on partner organizations, such as EPA, to conduct testing and gather data. This <b>environmental</b> <b>data</b> provides information {{on the amount of}} contamination and possible ways humans could be exposed to the hazardous substances at the site. The health data provides information on rates of illness, disease, and death in the local community. Since ATSDR is an advisory agency, the conclusions in its public health assessments and health consultations are often in the form of recommendations to state and national environmental and health agencies, such as EPA, that have regulatory authority. Other agencies and the general public rely on ATSDR to provide trusted information on the health effects of hazardous substances at contaminated sites.|$|E

25|$|There {{have also}} been recent {{technological}} developments that will hopefully facilitate more accurate mapping of hookworm prevalence. Some researchers have begun to use geographical information systems (GIS) and remote sensing (RS) to examine helminth ecology and epidemiology. Brooker et al. utilized this technology to create helminth distribution maps of sub-Saharan Africa. By relating satellite derived <b>environmental</b> <b>data</b> with prevalence data from school-based surveys, {{they were able to}} create detailed prevalence maps. The study focused {{on a wide range of}} helminths, but interesting conclusions about hookworm specifically were found. As compared to other helminths, hookworm is able to survive in much hotter conditions and was highly prevalent throughout the upper end of the thermal range. Hopefully this information along with more detailed prevalence maps can lead to more effective public health measures.|$|E

500|$|The Early Neolithic was {{a revolutionary}} period of British history. Between 4500 and 3800 BCE, it saw a {{widespread}} change in lifestyle as the communities {{living in the}} British Isles adopted agriculture as their primary form of subsistence, abandoning the hunter-gatherer lifestyle that had characterised the preceding Mesolithic period. This came about through contact with continental societies, although it is unclear to what extent this {{can be attributed to}} an influx of migrants or to indigenous Mesolithic Britons adopting agricultural technologies from the continent. The region of modern Kent would have been a key area for the arrival of continental European settlers and visitors, because of its position on the estuary of the River Thames and its proximity to the continent. Britain was largely forested in this period, with Kent only seeing widespread forest clearance in the Late Bronze Age. <b>Environmental</b> <b>data</b> from the area around the White Horse Stone — a megalith in the vicinity of Chestnuts Long Barrow — supports the idea that the area was still largely forested in the Early Neolithic, covered by a woodland of oak, ash, hazel/alder and Maloideae.

40|$|Land {{contamination}} {{could be}} a problem in an investment because it can decrease the value of investment. This can be caused by the following: uncertainty in the process of cleaning, the cost that arise and law obligations. In valuing contaminated land and property, the valuer is expected to have <b>environmental</b> <b>datas</b> which can be used when valuing contaminated land and property. Those <b>environmental</b> <b>datas</b> are general information, contaminated information, treatment information, and valuation information. The approaches that are used for valuing are: firstly, cost to correct approach which takes an uncontaminated value figure, using either the invesment method or comparative method, and deducts remediation costs. The end result is the contaminated value. Secondly, the explicit Discounted Cash Flow approach. Valuer is expected to consider a few factors that affect the valuation. Those factors are knowledge of contaminated land treatment techniques, cost estimates, cost changes, the forecasting of future rent, capital flows and depreciation, and also not forgetting to include stigma valuation in the valuation report. Those approach used for valuing contaminated land and property are expected to yield valuable because contaminated land can be turned to usable land...|$|R
