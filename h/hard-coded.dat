50|$|As modern {{software}} engineering depends more on object composition than class inheritance, emphasis shifts away from <b>hard-coding</b> behaviors toward defining a smaller set of basic behaviors {{that can be}} composed into more complex ones. <b>Hard-coding</b> behaviors are inflexible because they require overriding or re-implementing {{the whole thing in}} order to change parts of the design. Additionally, <b>hard-coding</b> does not promote reuse and makes it difficult to keep track of errors. For these reasons, creational patterns are more useful than <b>hard-coding</b> behaviors. Creational patterns make design become more flexible. They provide different ways to remove explicit references in the concrete classes from the code that needs to instantiate them. In other words, they create independency for objects and classes.|$|R
40|$|Electronic {{spreadsheets}} play {{an indispensable}} {{role in the}} simulation, modeling, and analysis of bioenergy systems, and their results {{have the ability to}} affect decision-making significantly. Prior research has shown that spreadsheets are highly error-prone, and that a large percentage of these errors are difficult to detect. To that end, we developed computer code (implemented in Visual Basic for Applications, running under Microsoft Excel) to detect a particularly insidious form of spreadsheet error: the <b>hard-coding</b> error. These errors are defined as the presence of one or more unreferenced numerical values in a cell formula. <b>Hard-coding</b> errors are dangerous because they are a likely source of erroneous constants and/or non-updating assumptions. The code was used to audit six spreadsheets relevant to bioenergy systems, three developed in our lab (and reported on in other sessions at the AIM), and three in the public domain. The preliminary audit results were analyzed to understand the nature and distribution of <b>hard-coding</b> errors. The preponderance and diversity of <b>hard-coding</b> errors in these spreadsheets motivated us to subcategorize them. Together, the <b>hard-coding</b> error detection program and sub-categorization program provide a robust and rapid means of detecting and categorizing multiple types of <b>hard-coding</b> errors. Use of these programs could increase the reliability of spreadsheet software used in simulation, modeling, and analysis of bioenergy systems...|$|R

2500|$|In the {{formulation}} of the method by Kirkpatrick et al., the acceptance probability function [...] was defined as 1 if , and [...] otherwise. This formula was superficially justified by analogy with the transitions of a physical system; it corresponds to the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, in the case where T=1 and the proposal distribution of Metropolis-Hastings is symmetric. However, this acceptance probability is often used for simulated annealing even when the neighbour (...) function, which {{is analogous to the}} proposal distribution in Metropolis-Hastings, is not symmetric, or not probabilistic at all. [...] As a result, the transition probabilities of the simulated annealing algorithm do not correspond to the transitions of the analogous physical system, and the long-term distribution of states at a constant temperature [...] need not bear any resemblance to the thermodynamic equilibrium distribution over states of that physical system, at any temperature. Nevertheless, most descriptions of SA assume the original acceptance function, which is probably <b>hard-coded</b> in many implementations of SA.|$|E
2500|$|The key {{competitor}} to the Google suite is Microsoft Office 365, Microsoft's cloud-based offering {{for businesses}} that includes similar products. The key differences {{are in the}} pricing plans, storage space and number of features. As noted by TechRepublic in 2013, pricing plans differ in that [...] "Google Apps has a quick and easy pricing plan for their standard Google Apps for Business package: $5 per user per month or $50 per user per year [...] In contrast, Office 365 has a multitude of plans (six as of September, 2013) which can be {{both good and bad}} since it provides flexibility but also involves some complexity to figure out the best choice". Storage space varies because [...] "Office 365 gives users 50GB of space in Outlook and 25GB in Skydrive. Google Apps provides 30GB of space which is spread among Gmail, Drive and Picasa". And regarding features, it states that [...] "Office 365 has the advantage for plenty of users who have been familiar with Word, Excel {{and the rest of the}} gang for years; there is less of a learning curve than with Google Apps if the latter represents a brand new experience [...] However, it's also true that Office is notorious for being loaded with complex, unused features which can cause confusion, so the familiarity many will embrace also comes with something of a price, especially if companies are paying for advanced packages not all employees will use. By contrast, Google Apps programs are fairly easy to learn and intuitive, but may feel too awkward for those who are <b>hard-coded</b> to work in Office." [...] Stephen Shankland of CNET wrote in 2014 that [...] "It's hard to compare Google Apps' success to that of Microsoft Office since Google doesn't release revenue or user figures".|$|E
