25|$|A {{significant}} {{multitude of}} scholastic {{studies have shown}} that the linguistic styles of GLB and straight people are not mutually exclusive. Munson et al. (2006), for instance, examined the gradient nature of perceived sexual orientation by having 40 listeners rate 44 talkers' sexual orientation on a five-point equally appearing <b>interval</b> <b>scale.</b> The 44 talkers included equal number of GLB and straight people. When averaged across the 40 listeners, ratings for individual talkers showed some overlap between GLB and straight people. For example, the two men who were tied with the most-gay average ratings included one self-identified straight man, and one self-identified gay man. While there are group level differences between GLB and straight people in the gay soundness of their voices, overlap does exist, providing a serious challenge to a simple model in which speech differences were the inevitable consequence of sexual orientation. The fact that there is no clean cut between the linguistic patterns of GLB and straight people suggests that too many generations in the study of language and gender can be dangerous.|$|E

5000|$|An <b>interval</b> <b>scale</b> is {{constructed}} by determining {{the equality of}} differences between the things measured.

For instance, one can say that the difference between 5 and 10 degrees on a Fahrenheit thermometer equals the difference between 25 and 30, but it is meaningless to say that something with a temperature of 20 degrees Fahrenheit is [...] "twice as hot" [...] as something with a temperature of 10 degrees.

40|$|The {{application}} {{of a system of}} measurement structures for category-rating and magnitude scales is tested with regard to numerous sensory and social judgment scales. Results indicate that, on the average, category-rating <b>scales</b> yield <b>interval</b> <b>scales</b> and multimodality matching <b>scales</b> yield logarithmic <b>interval</b> <b>scales.</b> However, marked interindividual differences are detected, pointing to different capabilities subjects have in coping with both methods. It is asked, therefore, how suboptimal scale quality affects the results of parameter estimation in structural equation models in which judgment scales serve as indicator variables. Based on a general psychophysical judgment model it is shown that the measurement theoretical properties of magnitude scales of individual respondents account for large proportions of the variation of estimated coefficients and of goodness of fit. For category-rating scales the effects scale properties have on parameter estimation cannot be determined because of nonhomogeneous judgment functions. " (author's abstract...|$|R
