50|$|North American, European, {{and other}} {{languages}} refer to hydropneumatic {{devices such as}} a <b>hydropneumatic</b> <b>accumulator</b> or pulsation damper using very different words. In many cases this can cause {{a great deal of}} word usage confusion. This article includes information about devices that prevent, but do not absorb, alleviate, arrest, attenuate, or suppress a shock that already exists (these devices prevent the creation of a shock wave at an otherwise higher level). The words frequently used for devices such as pulsation dampeners, hydropneumatic accumulators, water hammer preventers, water hammer arrestors, and others, are included.|$|E
50|$|North American, European, {{and other}} {{languages}} refer to hydropneumatic {{devices such as}} a <b>hydropneumatic</b> <b>accumulator</b> or pulsation dampener using very different words. Lack of definition and standardization has caused confusion, and word inference has caused {{a belief in the}} opposite of the truth. This section is for definition of the devices that prevent, and do not either absorb, alleviate, arrest, attenuate, nor suppress a shock that exists (devices which prevent the creation of a shock wave at an otherwise higher level). The words frequently used for devices such as pulsation dampeners, hydropneumatic accumulators, water hammer preventers, water hammer arrestors, and others, are included.|$|E

The hydrostatic circuit comprises a reversible hydrostatic unit and two <b>hydropneumatic</b> <b>accumulators,</b> connected with the conventional powertrain, according to the power assist scheme. The {{mathematical model}} of the complete system involves {{the development of new}} specific models and the modification of the standard library models with the AMESet editor.

Both similarities and differences of the two concepts are discussed in the presentation...|$|R
40|$|The {{availability}} {{of natural gas}} and crude oil resources has been declining over the years. In automobile sector, the consumption of crude oil is 63 % of total crude oil production in the world. Hence, automobile industries are placing more emphasis on energy efficient hydraulic hybrid systems, which can replace their conventional transmission systems. Series hydraulic hybrid system (SHHS) is a multidomain mechatronics system with two distinct power sources that includes prime mover and <b>hydropneumatic</b> <b>accumulator.</b> It replaces the conventional transmission system to drive the vehicle. The sizing of the subsystems in SHHS {{plays a major role}} in improving the energy efficiency of the vehicle. In this paper, a power bond graph approach is used to model the dynamics of the SHHS. The obtained simulation results indicate the energy flow during various modes of operations. It also includes the dynamic response of <b>hydropneumatic</b> <b>accumulator,</b> prime mover, and system output speed. Further, design optimization of the system is carried out to optimize the process parameters for maximizing the system energy efficiency. This leads to increase in fuel economy and environmentally friendly vehicle...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn this paper, we {{emphasize}} {{two main}} effects {{involved in the}} CRONE car suspension technology (CRONE: French acronym for Commande Robuste d'Ordre Non Entier). In a first time, we present {{the influence of the}} inductive or inertial effect of the pipes that links the different cells of the hydropneumatic car suspension. These components are mainly resistive and capacitive devices. Then, we analyze the nonlinear relations that link the hydraulic power variables (the flow and the pressure) of the hydraulic resistors and the <b>hydropneumatic</b> <b>accumulators</b> and we study the effect of the nonlinear terms on the car suspension response. Our study is based on the gamma RC arrangement developed in Altet et al. (In: Analysis and design of hybrid systems—proceedings of ADHS 03, pp. 63 – 68. Elsevier, Amsterdam, 2003) and Serrier et al. (In: Proceedings of IDETC/CIE 2005 : ASME 2005 international design engineering technical conferences and computers and information in engineering conference, Long Beach, CA, USA, 24 – 28 September 2005). In a second time, we focus only on the gamma RLC arrangement, introduced in Abi Zeid Daou et al. (Int. J. Electron. 96 (12) : 1207 – 1223, 2009). We show whether the parasite effect due to the pipes or the nonlinear RC components affect the system's response. The simulation results show that neither the inertial effect caused by these parasite pipes of one meter length nor the use of the nonlinear resistors or the accumulators modifies the response of the gamma RC arrangement...|$|R
