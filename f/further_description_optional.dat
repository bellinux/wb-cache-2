Autotransformers and all Wye and Delta couplings are supported. The model includes an inverse inductance matrix for the leakage <b>description,</b> <b>optional</b> frequency dependent winding resistance, capacitive coupling, and a topologically correct core model (3 - and 5 -legged) with individual saturation and losses in legs and yokes. Three different sources of data are supported; typical values, standard test reports, and design information. The hybrid model XFMR is compared to the UMEC model in PSCAD showing good agreement at rated, stationary operation, but considerable differences in transient situations. Both models need development to reproduce all switching transient behaviors properly...|$|R
