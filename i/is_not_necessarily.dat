Some steel cylinders manufactured to US standards are permitted to exceed the nominal working pressure by 10% and this is indicated by a '+' symbol.

5|$|A tornado <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> visible; {{however, the}} intense low {{pressure}} {{caused by the}} high wind speeds (as described by Bernoulli's principle) and rapid rotation (due to cyclostrophic balance) usually cause water vapor {{in the air to}} condense into cloud droplets due to adiabatic cooling.

5|$|A {{habitat is}} made up of {{physical}} factors such as soil, moisture, range of temperature, and light intensity as well as biotic factors such as the availability of food and {{the presence or absence of}} predators. Every organism has certain habitat needs for the conditions in which it will thrive, but some are tolerant of wide variations while others are very specific in their requirements. A habitat <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> a geographical area, it can be the interior of a stem, a rotten log, a rock or a clump of moss, and for a parasitic organism it is the body of its host, part of the host's body such as the digestive tract, or a single cell within the host's body.|$|E
5|$|Fire or Police Linked Service – In {{countries}} such as the United States, Japan, Hong Kong and France ambulances can be operated by the local fire or police service, more commonly the fire service due to overlapping calls. This is particularly common in rural areas, where maintaining a separate service <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> cost effective, or by service preference such as in LA where the LAFD prefers to handle all parts of emergency medicine in-house. In some cases {{this can lead to}} an illness or injury being attended by a vehicle other than an ambulance, such as a fire truck.|$|E

However, universals <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> {{abstract and}} particulars <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> concrete. For example, one might hold that numbers are particular yet abstract objects. Likewise, some philosophers, such as D.M. Armstrong, consider universals to be concrete.|$|R
5|$|Pope John XXIII issued eight Papal Encyclicals {{during his}} five-year reign as Pope of the Roman Catholic Church, from his {{election}} on October 28, 1958 {{until his death}} on June 3, 1963. Two of his encylicals, Mater et magistra and Pacem in terris, are especially important. A Papal Encyclical is a letter sent by the Pope which is addressed to Roman Catholic bishops {{in a particular area}} or the whole world. Encyclicals may condemn errors, point out threats to faith and morals, exhort faithful practices, or provide remedies for present and future dangers to the church. The authority of the encyclical varies depending on the circumstances and <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> ex cathedra. The title of a Papal Encyclical is usually taken from its first few words.|$|E
5|$|The Imperfect {{portrays the}} verb as an {{incomplete}} action {{along with the}} process by which it came about, either as an event that has not begun, an event that has begun but is still in the process, or a habitual or cyclic action that is on an ongoing repetition. The Imperfect can also express modal or conditional verbs, as well as commands in the Jussive and Cohortative moods. While often future tense, it also has uses in the past and present under certain contexts. Biblical Hebrew tense <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> reflected in the verb forms per se, but rather is determined primarily by context. The Participles also reflect ongoing or continuous actions, but are also subject to the context determining their tense.|$|E
5|$|The {{neutral theory}} of {{molecular}} evolution proposed that most evolutionary changes {{are the result}} of the fixation of neutral mutations by genetic drift. Hence, in this model, most genetic changes in a population {{are the result of}} constant mutation pressure and genetic drift. This form of the neutral theory is now largely abandoned, since {{it does not seem to}} fit the genetic variation seen in nature. However, a more recent and better-supported version of this model is the nearly neutral theory, where a mutation that would be effectively neutral in a small population <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> neutral in a large population. Other alternative theories propose that genetic drift is dwarfed by other stochastic forces in evolution, such as genetic hitchhiking, also known as genetic draft.|$|E

5|$|The novelists of the {{dictator}} novel genre combined narrative strategies of both modern and postmodern writing. Postmodern techniques, constructed {{largely in the}} late 1960s and 1970s, included use of interior monologues, radically stream-of-consciousness narrative, fragmentation, varying narrative points of view, neologisms, innovative narrative strategies, and frequent lack of causality. Alejo Carpentier, a Boom writer and contributor to {{the dictator}} novel genre pioneered {{what came to be}} known as magical realism, although the use of this technique <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> a prerequisite of the dictator novel, as there are many that do not utilize magical realism.|$|E
5|$|The word kosher is {{also part}} of some common product names. Sometimes it is used as an {{abbreviation}} of koshering, meaning the process for making something kosher; for example, kosher salt is a form of salt with irregularly shaped crystals, making it particularly suitable for preparing meat according to the rules of kashrut, because the increased surface area of the crystals absorbs blood more effectively. At other times it is used as a synonym for Jewish tradition; for example, a kosher dill pickle is simply a pickle made in the traditional manner of Jewish New York City pickle makers, using a generous addition of garlic to the brine, and <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> compliant with the traditional Jewish food laws.|$|E
5|$|When {{multiple}} different alleles for a gene {{are present}} in a species's population it is called polymorphic. Most different alleles are functionally equivalent, however some alleles can give rise to different phenotypic traits. A gene's most common allele is called the wild type, and rare alleles are called mutants. The genetic variation in relative frequencies of different alleles in a population is due to both natural selection and genetic drift. The wild-type allele <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>necessarily</b> the ancestor of less common alleles, nor is it necessarily fitter.|$|E
