5|$|Because {{the worker}} and soldier castes lack wings and thus never <b>fly,</b> <b>and</b> the reproductives use their wings {{for just a}} brief amount of time, {{termites}} predominantly rely upon their legs to move about.|$|E
5|$|In May 2012, O'Hara's family {{contacted}} {{social workers}} regarding claims that O'Hara, who had short-term memory loss, {{was a victim}} of elder abuse. In September 2012, O'Hara flew to the US after receiving doctor's permission to <b>fly,</b> <b>and</b> moved in with her grandson in Idaho. In her last years she suffered from diabetes mellitus type 2 and short-term memory loss.|$|E

5|$|Some species, such as Gryllus assimilis, take off, <b>fly,</b> <b>and</b> land {{efficiently}} and well, while other species are clumsy fliers. In some species, the hind wings are shed, leaving wing stumps, usually after dispersal of the insect by flight. In other species, {{they may be}} pulled off and consumed by the cricket itself or by another individual, probably providing a nutritional boost.|$|E
5|$|The crews {{found the}} {{aircraft}} difficult to <b>fly,</b> <b>and</b> its top speed was reduced significantly. Production {{was shut down}} after the pilots reports reached the Ministry of Aviation. However, a Chinese delegation was visiting Germany and they considered the He 111 A-0 fit for their needs and purchased seven machines.|$|E

5|$|According to the CBS document, the {{original}} Bhutanese flag was a bicolour square flag divided diagonally {{from the lower}} hoist to the upper fly. The field of yellow extended from the hoist to the upper <b>fly,</b> <b>and</b> the red field extended from the fly end to the lower hoist. In {{the centre of the}} flag, at the convergence of the yellow and red fields, is a green Druk, located parallel to the bottom edge and facing the fly.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with the}} new fighter McCudden was eager to fly was the company he would be flying with. Albert Ball (44 victories), rising star Arthur Rhys-Davids (27) and McCudden's former pupil Geoffrey Hilton Bowman (32) were {{just some of the}} fighter aces who flew with the unit. Though Ball was killed in May 1917, he would <b>fly</b> <b>and</b> fight {{alongside}} Rhys-Davids, Bowman, Richard Maybery, Reginald Hoidge and Keith Muspratt.|$|E
5|$|Although the Skyraider {{was a third}} {{smaller and}} carried a third less bombload, it proved more {{reliable}} in service and easier to <b>fly</b> <b>and</b> land, and Navy pilots preferred it. In 1950 {{the decision was made}} to use the Mauler only from shore-based units and later that year all but Naval Reserve units abandoned the type. The aircraft operated with reserve squadrons until 1953.|$|E

5|$|Bulbs are {{harvested}} for {{market in the}} summer, sorted, stored for 2 – 3 weeks, and then further disinfected by a hot (43.5°C) bath. This eliminates infestations by narcissus <b>fly</b> <b>and</b> nematodes. The bulbs are then dried at a high temperature, and then stored at 15.5°C. The initiation of new flower development in the bulb takes place in late spring before the bulbs are lifted, and is completed by mid summer while the bulbs are in storage. The optimal temperature for initiation is 20°C followed by cooling to 13°C.|$|E
5|$|Carrots {{benefit from}} {{strongly}} scented companion plants. The pungent odour of onions, leeks and chives help repel the carrot root <b>fly,</b> <b>and</b> other vegetables that team well with carrots include lettuce, tomatoes and radishes, {{as well as}} the herbs rosemary and sage. Carrots thrive in the presence of caraway, coriander, chamomile, marigold and Swan River daisy. They can also be good companions for other plants; if left to flower, the carrot, like any umbellifer, attracts predatory wasps that kill many garden pests.|$|E
5|$|In April 1878, L'Estrange reappeared on the Australian {{scene with}} a new {{performance}} – gas ballooning. The first balloon ascent in Australia {{had been made in}} Melbourne in 1853, with Sydney following five years later in December 1858. The idea that people could be lifted from the ground to <b>fly</b> <b>and</b> return safely fired the imagination of the public, and the novelty of balloon ascents continued to draw large crowds through the 1860s and 1870s. No doubt the very real chance of disaster and injury added to the crowd's keen interest, as mishaps were not uncommon.|$|E

5|$|In {{the novels}} Halo: Fall of Reach and Halo: The Flood, it is {{told that the}} Grunts are methane {{breathers}} and described as dog-like. They have methane suits {{that allow them to}} remove the breathing apparatuses they usually wear to sustain them in a non-methane atmosphere. In Halo Reach, if a player kills a Grunt in a particular way, their methane tank will ignite causing them to <b>fly</b> <b>and</b> bounce around the area out of control, causing damage if they hit the player.|$|E
5|$|Kennedy was {{admitted}} to the Massachusetts Bar in 1959. In 1960, his brother John ran for President of the United States and Ted managed his campaign in the Western states. Ted learned to <b>fly</b> <b>and</b> during the Democratic primary campaign he barnstormed around the western states, meeting with delegates and bonding with them by trying his hand at ski jumping and bronc riding. The seven weeks he spent in Wisconsin helped his brother win the first contested primary of the season there and a similar time spent in Wyoming was rewarded when a unanimous vote from that state's delegates put his brother over the top at the 1960 Democratic National Convention.|$|E

5|$|Scaly-breasted munias form {{flocks of}} as many as 100 birds. Individuals {{communicate}} with calls that include a short whistle, variations of kitty-kitty-kitty, and a sharp chipping alarm note. They sometimes flick their tails and wings vertically or horizontally while hopping about. The tail flicking motion may have evolved from a locomotory intention movement. The exaggerated version of the tail flicking movement may have undergone ritualization. As a social signal, tail flicking in several other species acts as a signal indicating the intent to <b>fly</b> <b>and</b> helps keep flocks together.|$|E
