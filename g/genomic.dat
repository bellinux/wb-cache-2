5|$|An {{enormous}} {{variety of}} <b>genomic</b> structures {{can be seen}} among viral species; as a group, they contain more structural <b>genomic</b> diversity than plants, animals, archaea, or bacteria. There are millions of different types of viruses, although only about 5,000 types have been described in detail. As of September 2015, the NCBI Virus genome database has more than 75,000 complete genome sequences. but there are doubtlessly many more to be discovered.|$|E

5|$|DNA {{sequence}} {{data from}} <b>genomic</b> and metagenomic projects are essentially the same, but <b>genomic</b> sequence data offers higher coverage while metagenomic data is usually highly non-redundant. Furthermore, {{the increased use}} of second-generation sequencing technologies with short read lengths means that much of future metagenomic data will be error-prone. Taken in combination, these factors make the assembly of metagenomic sequence reads into genomes difficult and unreliable. Misassemblies are caused by the presence of repetitive DNA sequences that make assembly especially difficult because of the difference in the relative abundance of species present in the sample. Misassemblies can also involve the combination of sequences from more than one species into chimeric contigs.|$|E
5|$|In November 2017, {{researchers}} found <b>genomic</b> {{evidence for a}} new species of orangutan named, Pongo tapanuliensis, found only in the Batang Toru forest of Sumatra, Indonesia. It is estimated that fewer than 800 individuals still exist, which puts the Tapanuli orangutan among the most endangered of great apes.|$|E
5|$|Most known RNA {{thermometers}} {{are located}} in the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of messenger RNA encoding heat shock proteins—though it has been suggested this fact may be due, in part, to sampling bias and inherent difficulties of detecting short, unconserved RNA sequences in <b>genomic</b> data.|$|E
5|$|Recent {{research}} suggests that the topical antimicrobial zinc pyrithione is a potent heat shock response inducer that may impair <b>genomic</b> integrity with induction of PARP-dependent energy crisis in cultured human keratinocytes and melanocytes.|$|E
5|$|The {{first step}} of metagenomic data {{analysis}} requires the execution of certain pre-filtering steps, including the removal of redundant, low-quality sequences and sequences of probable eukaryotic origin (especially in metagenomes of human origin). The methods available {{for the removal of}} contaminating eukaryotic <b>genomic</b> DNA sequences include Eu-Detect and DeConseq.|$|E
5|$|Uncoating is {{a process}} in which the viral capsid is removed: This may be by {{degradation}} by viral enzymes or host enzymes or by simple dissociation; the end-result is the releasing of the viral <b>genomic</b> nucleic acid.|$|E
25|$|In placental species, parent-offspring {{conflict}} {{can result}} {{in the evolution of}} strategies, such as <b>genomic</b> imprinting, for embryos to subvert maternal nutrient provisioning. Despite several attempts to find it, <b>genomic</b> imprinting has not been found in the platypus, reptiles, birds or fish. The absence of <b>genomic</b> imprinting in a placental reptile, the southern grass skink, is interesting as <b>genomic</b> imprinting was thought {{to be associated with the}} evolution of viviparity and placental nutrient transport.|$|E
25|$|Next-generation <b>genomic</b> {{technologies}} allow clinicians and biomedical {{researchers to}} drastically {{increase the amount}} of <b>genomic</b> data collected on large study populations. When combined with new informatics approaches that integrate many kinds of data with <b>genomic</b> data in disease research, this allows researchers to better understand the genetic bases of drug response and disease.|$|E
25|$|Parametric {{methods to}} infer HGT use {{characteristics}} of the genome sequence specific to particular species or clades, also called <b>genomic</b> signatures. If a fragment of the genome strongly deviates from the <b>genomic</b> signature, this {{is a sign of}} a potential horizontal transfer. For example, because bacterial GC content falls within a wide range (see Figure 2), GC content of a genome segment is a simple <b>genomic</b> signature. Commonly used <b>genomic</b> signatures include nucleotide composition, oligonucleotide frequencies, or structural features of the genome.|$|E
25|$|Some human {{disorders}} {{are associated with}} <b>genomic</b> imprinting, a phenomenon in mammals where the father and mother contribute different epigenetic patterns for specific <b>genomic</b> loci in their germ cells. The best-known case of imprinting in human disorders is that of Angelman syndrome and Prader-Willi syndrome—both can be produced by the same genetic mutation, chromosome 15q partial deletion, and the particular syndrome that will develop depends on whether the mutation is inherited from the child's mother or from their father. This {{is due to the}} presence of <b>genomic</b> imprinting in the region. Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is also associated with <b>genomic</b> imprinting, often caused by abnormalities in maternal <b>genomic</b> imprinting of a region on chromosome 11.|$|E
25|$|The L RNA encodes the L protein, which {{functions}} as the viral transcriptase/replicase. Within virions, the <b>genomic</b> RNAs of hantaviruses {{are thought to}} complex with the N protein to form helical nucleocapsids, the RNA component of which circularizes due to sequence complementarity between the 5' and 3' terminal sequences of <b>genomic</b> segments.|$|E
25|$|The {{oligonucleotide}} spectrum (or k-mer frequencies) {{measures the}} frequency of all possible nucleotide sequences of a particular length in the genome. It tends to vary less within genomes than between genomes and therefore {{can also be used}} as a <b>genomic</b> signature. A deviation from this signature suggests that a <b>genomic</b> segment might have arrived through horizontal transfer.|$|E
25|$|Neighborhood: Similar <b>genomic</b> {{context in}} {{different}} species suggest a similar {{function of the}} proteins.|$|E
25|$|Flavivirus <b>genomic</b> RNA {{replication}} {{occurs on}} {{rough endoplasmic reticulum}} membranes in membranous compartments.|$|E
25|$|Together with Stephen J. Gould, Brosius {{took the}} concept of {{exaptation}} to the <b>genomic</b> level.|$|E
25|$|Chromothripsis is the {{phenomenon}} by which up {{to thousands of}} clustered chromosomal rearrangements occur in a single event in localised and confined <b>genomic</b> regions in {{one or a few}} chromosomes, and is known to be involved in both cancer and congenital diseases. It occurs through one massive <b>genomic</b> rearrangement during a single catastrophic event in the cell's history. It is believed that for the cell to be able to withstand such a destructive event, the occurrence of such an event must be the upper limit of what a cell can tolerate and survive. The chromothripsis phenomenon opposes the conventional theory that cancer is the gradual acquisition of <b>genomic</b> rearrangements and somatic mutations over time.|$|E
25|$|Additional {{classification}} schema {{are used}} for prognosis and include histopathology, grade, stage, and <b>genomic</b> profiling.|$|E
25|$|Most gross <b>genomic</b> {{mutations}} in gamete germ cells probably result in inviable embryos; however, {{a number of}} human diseases are related to large-scale <b>genomic</b> abnormalities. Down syndrome, Turner Syndrome, {{and a number of}} other diseases result from nondisjunction of entire chromosomes. Cancer cells frequently have aneuploidy of chromosomes and chromosome arms, although a cause and effect relationship between aneuploidy and cancer has not been established.|$|E
25|$|Separation of {{restricted}} <b>genomic</b> DNA {{prior to}} Southern transfer, or of RNA prior to Northern transfer.|$|E
25|$|Chromosome {{conformation}} capture {{determines the}} spatial organization of chromatin in the nucleus, by inferring <b>genomic</b> locations that physically interact.|$|E
25|$|Loss of tumor {{suppressor}} p53 gene {{often results}} in <b>genomic</b> instability, {{which could lead to}} the aneuploidy genotype.|$|E
25|$|Cells {{from people}} with A-T {{demonstrate}} <b>genomic</b> instability, slow growth and premature senescence in culture, shortened telomeres and an ongoing, low-level stress response. These factors {{may contribute to}} the progeric (signs of early aging) changes of skin and hair sometimes observed in people with A-T. For example, DNA damage and <b>genomic</b> instability cause melanocyte stem cell (MSC) differentiation which produces graying. Thus, ATM may be a “stemness checkpoint” protecting against MSC differentiation and premature graying of the hair.|$|E
25|$|Tilghman's work in {{molecular}} genetics {{focused on the}} regulation of genes during development, particularly {{in the field of}} <b>genomic</b> imprinting.|$|E
25|$|Bevier Hall, {{named for}} Isabel Bevier, {{was built in}} 1955. It is {{immediately}} east of the newly built Institute for <b>Genomic</b> Biology.|$|E
25|$|Genetic markers: Genetic markers for viral vectors {{allow for}} {{confirmation}} that the vector has {{integrated with the}} host <b>genomic</b> DNA.|$|E
25|$|<b>Genomic</b> Views: In {{addition}} to sources, this section gives reference DNA sequence, regulatory elements, epigenetics, chromosome band and <b>genomic</b> location of different sources. The red {{line on the}} image indicates the GeneLoc integrated location. In particular, if the GeneLoc integrated location {{is different from the}} location in Entrez Gene, it is shown in green; Blue is appeared when the GeneLoc integrated location differs from the location in Ensembl. Addition details can be accessed through the links in the section.|$|E
25|$|<b>Genomic</b> {{imprinting}} is surmised to {{have arisen}} {{due to the}} conflicting interests of maternal and paternal genes within a pregnancy.|$|E
25|$|If {{it becomes}} {{necessary}} {{to differentiate between}} mutations in <b>genomic</b> DNA, mitochondrial DNA, and RNA, a simple convention is used. For example, if the 100th base of a nucleotide sequence mutated from G to C, {{then it would be}} written as g.100G>C if the mutation occurred in <b>genomic</b> DNA, m.100G>C if the mutation occurred in mitochondrial DNA, or r.100g>c if the mutation occurred in RNA. Note that, for mutations in RNA, the nucleotide code is written in lower case.|$|E
25|$|Oncogenomics is a {{sub-field}} of genomics {{that characterizes}} cancer-associated genes. It focuses on <b>genomic,</b> epigenomic and transcript alterations in cancer.|$|E
25|$|One mir-2 microRNA in Drosophila, dme-miR-2a-2 , is two {{nucleotides}} offset {{with respect}} to the canonical products of other mir-2 precursors. This is likely to affect the function of that particular microRNA. This functional shift is associated to a change in the <b>genomic</b> distribution of mir-2 sequences in Drosophila. The functional diversification of microRNAs may require breaking the <b>genomic</b> linkage between paralogs, probably to avoid the co-regulation of multiple products by the same regulatory sequences.|$|E
25|$|Loss of {{capacity}} to repair genetic errors, {{leading to an}} increased mutation rate (<b>genomic</b> instability), thus accelerating all the other changes.|$|E
25|$|Molecular {{genetic testing}} {{is the most}} {{effective}} method of testing, as HPRT1 is the only gene known to be associated with LNS. Individuals who display the full Lesch–Nyhan phenotype all have mutations in the HPRT1 gene. Sequence analysis of mRNA is available clinically and can be utilized in order to detect HPRT1 mutations in males affected with Lesch–Nyhan syndrome. Techniques such as RT-PCR, multiplex <b>genomic</b> PCR, and sequence analysis (cDNA and <b>genomic</b> DNA), used for the diagnosis of genetic diseases, are performed on a research basis. If RT-PCR tests result in cDNA showing the absence of an entire exon or exons, then multiplex <b>genomic</b> PCR testing is performed. Multiplex <b>genomic</b> PCR testing amplifies the nine exons of the HPRT1 gene as eight PCR products. If the exon in question is deleted, the corresponding band will be missing from the multiplex PCR. However, if the exon is present, the exon is sequenced to identify the mutation, therefore causing exclusion of the exon from cDNA. If no cDNA is created by RT-PCR, then multiplex PCR is performed on the notion that most or all of the gene is obliterated.|$|E
25|$|Conservationists {{can use the}} {{information}} gathered by <b>genomic</b> sequencing {{in order to better}} evaluate genetic factors key to species conservation, such as the genetic diversity of a population or whether an individual is heterozygous for a recessive inherited genetic disorder. By using <b>genomic</b> data to evaluate the effects of evolutionary processes and to detect patterns in variation throughout a given population, conservationists can formulate plans to aid a given species without as many variables left unknown as those unaddressed by standard genetic approaches.|$|E
