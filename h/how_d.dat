As an example, we show how a recent model by Nappi and Witten can be made singularity-free via O(3; 3) boosts involving a fifth dimension. CERN-TH. 6634 / 92 August 1. Introduction A short while ago we have shown [1] <b>how</b> O(d; <b>d)</b> transformations [2, 3] acting on anisotropic but homogeneous (i. e. space-independent) string cosmologies in D = d + 1 space-time dimensions, can turn trivial (i. e. flat) string backgrounds into non-trivial (i. e. curved) ones. We also noticed [1] that the O(d; d) "boosted" backgrounds came out free of curvature singularities for non-exceptional values of the boost parameter fl. In this note, we generalize the latter observation by showing that, even if the starting point is a generic, singular cosmology in D = 1 + 1 dimensions or a D = 1 [...] ...|$|R
