5|$|Boy Scouting uses {{a series}} of medals and patches as emblems. The badge for the Scout rank {{consists}} of a simple fleur-de-lis, which symbolizes a compass needle. The needle points the Scout in the right direction, which is onward and upward. The Tenderfoot badge takes the fleur-de-lis of the Scout badge and adds two stars and an eagle with an American shield. The stars symbolize truth and knowledge; the eagle and shield symbolize freedom and readiness to defend it. The Second Class badge features a scroll inscribed with the Scout Motto, with the ends turned up and a knotted rope hanging from the bottom. The knot reminds each Scout to remember the Scout slogan, and the upturned ends of the scroll symbolize cheerfulness in service. The <b>First</b> <b>Class</b> badge combines {{the elements of the}} Tenderfoot and Second Class badges. For years, the <b>First</b> <b>Class</b> badge was used as the emblem of the BSA. Star has a <b>First</b> <b>Class</b> symbol on a five-pointed yellow star, and initially indicated the five merit badges required to earn the rank.
