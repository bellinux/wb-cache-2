Gerstmann wrote: [...] "When I {{reflect on the}} experience, I'll probably think about the times the game locked up on me or broke in a dozen other crazy ways first, before thinking about the great world and the objectives that fill it.

[...] 1UP.com's Mike Nelson wrote [...] "On one hand, it feels like I can recommend this to any fan of the Fallout series. I single these fans out because they're willing to forgive silly bugs like meeting characters who walk into walls or occasionally float in mid-air. These fans realize that the game as a whole is greater than the sum of minor graphical anomalies. [...] On the other hand, I simply can't ignore or forgive the game for crashing on me when I walk around the Mojave Wasteland; or for quests that simply can't be completed because of a game glitch; or for making my companions disappear when <b>I</b> <b>need</b> <b>them</b> the most during a battle.

Deborah Frost, writing for Rolling Stone, noticed [...] "an ever widening personal gulf" [...] between the band members, and quoted Harvey as saying [...] "It makes me sad.

[...] Despite the tour's personal downsides, footage from live performances was compiled and released on the long-form video Reeling with PJ Harvey (1993). The band's final tour was to support U2 in August 1993, after which the trio officially disbanded. In her final appearance on American television in September 1993 on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, Harvey performed a solo version of [...] "Rid of Me." [...] As Rid of Me sold substantially more copies than Dry, 4-Track Demos, a compilation album of demos for the album was released in October and inaugurated her career as a solo artist. In early 1994, it was announced that U2's manager, Paul McGuinness, had become her manager.|$|R

60|$|But Gloucester's {{power was}} not to last for ever. He held it for only a year longer; in which year the famous battle of Otterbourne, sung in the old ballad of Chevy Chase, was fought. When the year was out, the King, turning {{suddenly}} to Gloucester, {{in the midst of}} a great council said, 'Uncle, how old am I?' 'Your highness,' returned the Duke, 'is in your twenty-second year.' 'Am I so much?' said the King; 'then I will manage my own affairs! I am much obliged to you, my good lords, for your past services, but <b>I</b> <b>need</b> <b>them</b> no more.' He followed this up, by appointing a new Chancellor and a new Treasurer, and announced to the people that he had resumed the Government. He held it for eight years without opposition. Through all that time, he kept his determination to revenge himself some day upon his uncle Gloucester, in his own breast.|$|E

[...] I am no such NEEDY man. (Luke 15:7) [...] "I am no extortioner, nor unjust, no adulterer, nor even as this Publican." [...] I am come indeed to thy feast, for of civility I could do no less; but for thy dainties, <b>I</b> <b>need</b> <b>them</b> not, I have of such things enough of mine own.19 (Luke 18:9) I thank thee therefore for thy offer of kindness, but I am not as those that have, and stand in need thereof, [...] "nor yet as this Publican." [...] And thus feeding upon thine own fare, or by making a composition of his and thine together, thou condemnest God, thou countest him insufficient or unfaithful; that is, either one that hath not enough, or having it, will not bestow it upon the poor and needy, and therefore, of mere pretence thou goest to his banquet, but yet trustest to thine own, and to that only.|$|E
40|$|First and {{foremost}} I {{would like to}} thank Bryan Hunt (my bobsie twin) for whom no amount of words can describe the generous help I have received throughout the years. You have been the greatest support system anyone could have or wish for. Thank you for being my friend unconditionally. If it weren’t for your six simple words “you know what you could do, ” I would not have finished my bachelor’s degree a year early and I would not have even attempted a master’s degree. I would not, for certain, have made it without you. For that I will forever be indebted to you. Thank you to my parents who listened to tearful phone calls late into the evening and always made sure that I knew things would be okay. Thank you for being my friend as well as my parent.

5000|$|It was {{not until}} they met that Dylan's writing began to address {{issues such as the}} civil rights {{movement}} and the threat of nuclear war. They started living together in early 1962, much to the disapproval of her family. As Dylan's fame grew, Rotolo found the relationship increasingly stressful.

6000|$|I cannot {{describe}} to you my sensations {{on the near}} prospect of my undertaking. It is impossible to communicate to you a conception of the trembling sensation, half pleasurable and half fearful, with which I am preparing to depart. I am going to unexplored regions, to [...] "the land of mist and snow," [...] but I shall kill no albatross; therefore do not be alarmed for my safety or if I should {{come back to you}} as worn and woeful as the [...] "Ancient Mariner." [...] You will smile at my allusion, but I will disclose a secret. I have often attributed my attachment to, my passionate enthusiasm for, the dangerous mysteries of ocean to that production of the most imaginative of modern poets. There is something at work in my soul which I do not understand. I am practically industrious--painstaking, a workman to execute with perseverance and labour--but besides this there is a love for the marvellous, a belief in the marvellous, intertwined in all my projects, which hurries me out of the common pathways of men, even to the wild sea and unvisited regions I am about to explore. But to return to dearer considerations. Shall I meet you again, after having traversed immense seas, and returned by the most southern cape of Africa or America? I dare not expect such success, yet I cannot bear to look on the reverse of the picture. Continue for the present to write to me by every opportunity: I may receive your letters on some occasions when <b>I</b> <b>need</b> <b>them</b> most to support my spirits. I love you very tenderly. Remember me with affection, should you never hear from me again.|$|E
6000|$|As a {{theological}} treatise, this of the Pharisee and Publican is invaluable. It {{is clear and}} perfectly intelligible to every candid and prayerful inquirer. When our author is proving the impossibility of a sinner's recommending himself to the divine favour by any imperfect good works of his own, he draws a vivid picture. A lord invites his friends to a sumptuous banquet, the provision is bountiful and in rich abundance, {{when some of the}} guests take a few mouldy crusts out of their pockets and lay them on their plates, lest the prince had not provided a sufficient repast for his friends; [...] "would it not be a high affront to, a great contempt of, and a distrust in, the goodness of the Lord." [...] We are bound to produce good works as a fruit of faith--a proof of love to him that hath redeemed us, but not to recommend us to his favour. The picture of such a feast drawn by John Bunyan must make upon every reader a deep, a lasting, an indelible impression. How bitter and how true is the irony, when the Pharisee is represented as saying, [...] "I came to thy feast out of civility, but for thy dainties <b>I</b> <b>need</b> <b>them</b> not, I have enough of my own; I thank thee for thy kindness, but I am not as those that stand in need of thy provisions, nor yet as this Publican." [...] And how excellent is the reasoning and the Christian philosophy of that paragraph which was suppressed after Bunyan's death. The language is bold and striking, but it exhibits the unvarnished truth; an inward change of nature is the only cause of good and acceptable works--good or evil actions are but the evidences of our state by grace or by nature--they do not work that change or produce that state. It is a soul-humbling view of our state of death by sin, or of life by the righteousness and obedience of Christ. Bunyan's train of reasoning on Romans 5 is worthy of our profound consideration,--"When we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son." [...] What is a sinful man in himself, or in his approach to God, but as stubble fully dry {{in the presence of a}} consuming fire, unless he is washed and cleansed by the atoning sacrifice of Jesus.|$|E
