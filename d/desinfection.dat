40|$|Micropropagation of waterpear (Sechium edule Jacq. S. W.) from {{vegetative}} shoots. Waterpear (Sechium edule) is {{an important}} source of revenue for the exporting countries, being Costa Rica the leading producer. Among the main limiting factors for its production are the planting materials, traditionally the seed, that because of its nature it does not allow the production of morphologically homogeneous fruits (color, shape and epidermal texture), which results in high percentages of rejected fruits at the packing plant. The establishment of a protocol for vegetative propagation of this species will help to solve the heterogeneity problems. The present research was directed to develop a micropropagation protocol from shoots. The effect of various desinfectants and concentration of growth regulators during the in vitro establishment, multiplication and rooting phases were evaluated. <b>Desinfections</b> with 4 % calcium hypochlorite allowed the highest percentage of aseptically established explants under in vitro conditions. There was also observed that during the following phases of micropropagation the requirements of growth regulators were very low (0. 1 mgL- 1 BA during bud sprouting and 0. 1 to 0. 2 mgL- 1 AIB during rooting) or were not required (microcutting multiplication) ...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to find out the {{influence}} of structural and organizational characteristics in medical institutions on the development of nosocomial infections in premature infants. The study based on the surveillance-notes of the departments, which participated in NEO-KISS. Sample period was from 1 st of January, 2008 until 31 st of June, 2009. The analysis included patient data, patient and device-days and infectionsheets/infections with informations about the three most frequently kinds of infection (nosocomial sepsis, nosocomial pneumonia and NEC) plus optional informations of the institutions about structural- and process parameters from 2008. Altogether the data of 5586 premature infants with birth weight < 1500 g of 116 at NEO-KISS participating departments were included in the calculations. 847 patients (15, 2 %) developed a nosocomial sepsis during sample period, of which in each case nearly the half was time associated to ZVK respectively to PVK. 138 patients (2, 5 %) developed a nosocomial pneumonia and 153 (2, 7 %) a NEC. Collectively patient-related parameters represented the most influence on the development of nosocomial infections. Low birth weight respectivly age of gestation and increased hospital stay are strong associated to the considered kinds of infections. Especially related to catheter-related blood stream infection, structure and process parameters showed a partly significant influence on the probability of infection. Only the ZVK-associated sepsis was influenced by staffing. Considering the development of a sepsis, hygienic based structural and organizational characteristics and communication (microbiological and handover visits, case studies) stand in the foreground. Specially hygiene standards and regular <b>desinfections</b> (hands, devices) could reduce the risk of sepsis vastly. Here was reflected, that a untrained exposure to devices could contain a risk for infections. To prevent NEC and pneumonia a trained exposure with devices and therefore rare handling and less stress for the newborn stand in the foreground. A prevalent routine change of incubators revealed a significant increased risk for development of nosocomial pneumonias. The development of NEC ist the less associated with the regarded structural and organizational characteristics. Only a trainend handling with nasogastric tubes showes a decreasing risk. Apparently stands the increased stress factor in the foreground, which is able to influence the blood flow of bowel essentially. In summary it could be showed, that several structures of the supplying department just as infection prevention measures had a significant influence on the appearance of all reviewed nosocomial infections...|$|R

Within the context of this investigation there could not be recognized any <b>desinfection</b> on the units induced by photocatalysis. In future the insufficient photocatalytic activity is to be improved by an optimized coating process...|$|E
