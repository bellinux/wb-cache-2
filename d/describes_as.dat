5|$|According to some scholars, the Black Stone was {{the same}} stone that Islamic {{tradition}} <b>describes</b> <b>as</b> greeting Muhammad before his prophethood. This led to a debate about whether the Black Stone's greeting comprised actual speech or merely a sound, and following that, whether the stone was a living creature or an inanimate object. Whichever was the case, the stone was held to be a symbol of prophethood.|$|E

He highlighted what he <b>describes</b> <b>as</b> the failures of insurers Allianz and Royal & Sun Alliance to pay $800 million in claims related to the attacks. Insurers state that an agreement to split payments between Silverstein and the Port Authority is a cause for concern.|$|E

5|$|After {{handling}} the marketing for Rentjong Atjeh (Rencong of Aceh, 1940), Andjar made his directorial debut in 1940 with Kartinah, a war-time romance starring Ratna Asmara. Academia {{was critical of}} the film, believing it to lack educational value. In 1941 he directed Noesa Penida, a tragedy based in Bali, for JIF; the film was remade in 1988. In these films, he had little creative control, and performed as what the Indonesian entertainment journalist Eddie Karsito <b>describes</b> <b>as</b> a dialogue coach. Camera angles and locations were chosen by the cinematographer, who was generally also the producer.|$|E
5|$|After much fanfare, Muhammad departs jannah airport, {{riding a}} buraq, or winged horse. The Archangel Gabriel accompanies him. On the way, they {{encounter}} a Soviet spacecraft. Hearing {{that they are}} infidels, Muhammad approaches to investigate, only to crash into the spacecraft, obliterating it and the buraq and killing the three cosmonauts; Muhammad and Gabriel are able to catch a cloud. Later, they pass Jakarta, which Gabriel <b>describes</b> <b>as</b> the most sinful place on Earth. Angered by Gabriel's statement that less than a million of Indonesia's 90 million Muslims are true believers, {{as well as the}} fact that it is the birthplace of Nasakom, Muhammad declares that Islam will never die and waits on the cloud.|$|E
5|$|Berndt Von Üxküll – Von Üxkül is a {{paraplegic}} junker from Pomerania and {{a composer}} {{who is married}} to Una. A World War I veteran, he fought alongside Aue's father in the Freikorps, whom he <b>describes</b> <b>as</b> a sadist. Despite essentially agreeing with their nationalist and antisemitic ideology, he distances himself from the Nazis. His name is possibly a reference to Nikolaus Graf von Üxküll-Gyllenband, an anti-Nazi resistant and uncle of Claus von Stauffenberg, a central figure in the failed plot to assassinate Hitler.|$|E

50|$|The {{buildings}} on the site were built orthogonal to each other. The overall site was aligned slightly east of north. Therefore, in the description below, when a building is <b>described</b> <b>as</b> being built east-west it is more accurately <b>described</b> <b>as</b> ENE-WSW, and when a building is <b>described</b> <b>as</b> being built north-south, it is more accurately <b>described</b> <b>as</b> SSW-NNE.|$|R
30|$|We {{constructed}} {{a set of}} vignettes which allowed us to gauge how people who are <b>described</b> <b>as</b> having special needs are viewed in relation {{to people who are}} <b>described</b> <b>as</b> having a disability. If special needs is an ineffective euphemism, as we predicted, then people <b>described</b> <b>as</b> having special needs should be viewed more negatively than people <b>described</b> <b>as</b> having a disability, which is what we observed. Indeed, as we predicted, when people were <b>described</b> <b>as</b> having special needs, they were viewed more negatively than when they were <b>described</b> <b>as</b> having a specific disability (e.g., is blind, has Down syndrome, is autistic, has ADHD).|$|R
5|$|Given these shortcomings, those modern {{weapons that}} were {{available}} were allocated to the British Army, and the Home Guard was forced to supplement the meagre amount of outdated anti-tank weapons and ammunition they had with ad hoc weapons, one such being the Smith Gun. The Smith Gun had what Mackenzie <b>describes</b> <b>as</b> an 'unorthodox origin', {{like many of the}} other weapons produced for use by the Home Guard. Invented by retired British Army Major William H. Smith, the managing director of Trianco Ltd., a firm of structural engineers. The Smith Gun was intended to be a cheap and easily manufactured anti-tank weapon.|$|E
5|$|In 1874 Long {{chaired the}} state Republican convention, and finally won {{election}} to the state legislature. He formed {{a close relationship with}} Speaker John E. Sanford, and in what historian James Hess <b>describes</b> <b>as</b> a probable move of political calculation, supported the successful gubernatorial candidate in 1875, Alexander H. Rice, even though Rice supported liberal legislation on alcohol sales that Long opposed. He was able to parlay this support into his own {{election to the}} speakership in 1876. He widened his reform views to the national stage by supporting Benjamin Bristow in his unsuccessful bid for the Republican presidential nomination.|$|E
5|$|In August 1792 {{she started}} Catharine or the Bower, which presaged her mature work, {{especially}} Northanger Abbey; {{it was left}} unfinished and the story picked up in Lady Susan, which Todd <b>describes</b> <b>as</b> less prefiguring than Catharine. A year later, she began but abandoned a short play, later titled Sir Charles Grandison or the happy Man, a comedy in 6 acts, which she returned to and completed around 1800. This was a short parody of various school textbook abridgements of Austen's favourite contemporary novel, The History of Sir Charles Grandison (1753), by Samuel Richardson.|$|E

5|$|In Grove, Nichols {{divides the}} chamber works into three clearly {{differentiated}} periods. The first four sonatas {{come from the}} early group, all written before Poulenc was twenty-two. They are for two clarinets (1918), piano duo (1918), clarinet and bassoon (1922) and horn, trumpet and trombone (1922). They are early examples of Poulenc's many and varied influences, with echoes of rococo divertissements alongside unconventional harmonies, some influenced by jazz. All four are characterised by their brevity– less than ten minutes each– their mischievousness and their wit, which Nichols <b>describes</b> <b>as</b> acid. Other chamber works from this period are the Rapsodie nègre, FP 3, from 1917 (mainly instrumental, with brief vocal episodes) and the Trio for oboe, bassoon and piano (1926).|$|E
5|$|In {{her book}} The Shock Doctrine, author and social activist Naomi Klein criticized Friedman's {{economic}} liberalism, identifying {{it with the}} principles that guided the economic restructuring that followed the military coups {{in countries such as}} Chile and Argentina. Based on their assessments {{of the extent to which}} what she <b>describes</b> <b>as</b> neoliberal policies contributed to income disparities and inequality, both Klein and Noam Chomsky have suggested that the primary role of what they describe as neoliberalism was as an ideological cover for capital accumulation by multinational corporations.|$|E
5|$|The army's initial forces {{included}} the 9th Rifle Corps, the 271st and 276th Rifle Divisions, the 40th, 42nd and 48th Cavalry Divisions, and the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th irregularly formed Crimean Rifle divisions (later converted into regular rifle divisions) {{and a number}} of smaller units. However, due to what Erickson <b>describes</b> <b>as</b> Kuznetsov's 'sticking blindly to the prewar plan', which anticipated a seaborne assault, and leaving the Perekop and Sivash approaches too thinly held, Erich von Manstein, leading the German assault, was able to push past the defenses. Therefore, the Stavka ordered that the army command be handed over to Batov.|$|E

5|$|The interwar {{years were}} marked by {{economic}} stagnation in rural and urban areas, and high unemployment. Thoughtful Scots pondered their declension, as the main social indicators such as poor health, bad housing, and long-term mass unemployment, pointed to terminal social and economic stagnation at best, or even a downward spiral. The heavy dependence on obsolescent heavy industry and mining was a central problem, and no one offered workable solutions. The despair reflected what Finlay (1994) <b>describes</b> <b>as</b> a widespread sense of hopelessness that prepared local business and political leaders to accept a new orthodoxy of centralised government economic planning when it arrived during the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|The {{two sides}} {{eventually}} {{tired of the}} war and both agreed to meet to establish a truce. After doing so, they exchanged hostages. Vanaland is described as having sent to Asaland its best men: Njörðr—described as wealthy—and his son Freyr in exchange for Asaland's Hœnir—described here as large, handsome, and thought of by the people of Vanaland well suited to be a chieftain. Additionally, Asaland sends Mímir—a man of great understanding—in exchange for Kvasir, who Snorri <b>describes</b> <b>as</b> the wisest man of Vanaland.|$|E
