40|$|In Markman claim term disputes, the {{paramount}} {{interest of the}} public in patents and {{in the public domain}} is unrepresented, even though “patent rights are ‘issues of great moment to the public. ’” What delineates the outer bounds of the patent claim interpretation inquiry are the “private interests of the litigants. ” The public interest is set aside. Neither the courts nor the litigants are well positioned to address the “underlying policy of the patent system” or to ask pointedly whether the patent claims, unless properly construed, have enough “worth to the public” to “outweigh the restrictive effect of the limited patent monopoly. ” The public interest in how inventions are described in issued patents is a precise but flexible construct that confines the granted rights within legal limits, disagrees with claims being read so expansively that information is taken back from the public domain, and urges objective interpretations that favor neither litigants’ infringement nor invalidity strategies. Amicus groups could define zones of interest when certain patent claims are interpreted and move to represent the public interest in the Markman proceedings. A public interest advocacy group consisting of law students who have completed a patent law course could be formed to identify cases that involve patent claims that affect segments of commerce important to the public. Through an admitted attorney and local counsel, such a group would enter an appearance for the limited purpose of participating as amicus in the claim <b>interpretation</b> <b>proceedings.</b> This article argues first that amici could protect the public domain and enforce the public notice function of patent claims. Then it argues in Section Three that having the litigants restrict the range of interpretations a court may consider leaves the public interest aspects out of the decision-making process. Next, Section Four of the article further contrasts the litigation-driven interpretations and the objective rules of construction. The final section examines whether an amicus group representing the public interest might be excluded from claim <b>interpretation</b> <b>proceedings...</b>|$|E

The event has its origins as a frock costume party, but the association of it with the month of October meant that it soon gained temporal and annual significance. Properly, Frocktoberfest is not a festival but a party, and while the month is known as Frocktober, it is informally celebrated on only one of its nights. Participants, male and female alike, dress up in frocks - women's dresses, frequently of the outdated and unfashionable variety.

The data consists of 47 biographical interviews with respondent who were born between 1908 - 1930 and have lived their lives during the Second World War in a central or eastern region of the Second Republic of Poland. In the first part, the text reviews the concept of cliche and rationale of applying the ‘image’ as key idea that organizes the <b>interpretation</b> of <b>proceedings.</b> The latter show following tendencies predominate the images of Jews embedded into the autobiographies: first, display of respondent’s ‘undervaluation’ in relations with Poles and the Polishhood, second, the inclination to ‘overvalue’ the relationships with ‘the strangers’, and third, an emphasis on such features possessed by the Jewish people’s that counts in competition for the status in the society.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a geometric {{approach to the}} problem of modelling the relationship between words and concepts, focusing in particular on analogical phenomena in language and cognition. Grounded in recent theories regarding geometric conceptual spaces, we begin with an analysis of existing static distributional semantic models and move on to an exploration of a dynamic approach to using high dimensional spaces of word meaning to project subspaces where analogies can potentially be solved in an online, contextualised way. The crucial element of this analysis is the positioning of statistics in a geometric environment replete with opportunities for <b>interpretation.</b> Comment: In <b>Proceedings</b> SLPCS 2016, arXiv: 1608. 0101...|$|R
40|$|Turi and Plotkin {{introduced}} an elegant approach to structural operational semantics based on universal coalgebra, parametric {{in the type}} of syntax and the type of behaviour. Their framework includes abstract GSOS, a categorical generalisation of the classical GSOS rule format, as well as its categorical dual, coGSOS. Both formats are well behaved, in the sense that each specification has a unique model on which behavioural equivalence is a congruence. Unfortunately, the combination of the two formats does not feature these desirable properties. We show that monotone specifications - that disallow negative premises - do induce a canonical distributive law of a monad over a comonad, and therefore a unique, compositional <b>interpretation.</b> Comment: In <b>Proceedings</b> EXPRESS/SOS 2017, arXiv: 1709. 0004...|$|R
40|$|The auto de fe — the {{symbolic}} {{enactment of the}} Spanish Inquisition's religious, judicial, and political authority — conveyed its function essentially via representational means. As well as serving as a theatre for the condemnation of those accused of heresy where mass was celebrated, the auto was a carefully choreographed affirmation of order and rank in society, set within defined spatial confines. The impressive ritual and ceremony associated with the event reached their climax in that held in Madrid's Plaza Mayor on 30 June 1680. This article explores some of the inconsistencies in the strategies of inclusion and exclusion that underpinned the spectacle via a close reading of the inquisitorial official José del Olmo's narrative account of the act of faith (1680) alongside the artist Francisco Rizi's complementary visual interpretation (1683), and examines the resulting challenges posed to a conventional <b>interpretation</b> of the <b>proceedings.</b> Peer-reviewedPost-prin...|$|R
40|$|Logic {{programming}} {{provides a}} very high-level view of programming, which {{comes at the}} cost of some execution efficiency. Improving performance of logic programs is thus one of the holy grails of Prolog system implementations and a wide range of approaches have historically been taken towards this goal. Designing computational models that both exploit the available parallelism in a given application and that try hard to reduce the explored search space has been an ongoing line of research for many years. These goals in particular have motivated the design of several computational models, one of which is the Extended Andorra Model (EAM). In this paper, we present a preliminary specification and implementation of the EAM with Implicit Control, the WAM 2 EAM, which supplies regular WAM instructions with an EAM-centered <b>interpretation.</b> Comment: Online <b>proceedings</b> of the Joint Workshop on Implementation of Constraint Logic Programming Systems and Logic-based Methods in Programming Environments (CICLOPS-WLPE 2010), Edinburgh, Scotland, U.

This technique of interpretation requires the interpreter to listen to a speaker in a source (or passive) language and orally translate that speech into another language in real time, that is, simultaneously, through headsets and microphones. Interpreters were split into four sections, one for each official language, with three interpreters per section working from the other three languages into the fourth (their mother tongue). For instance, the English booth consisted of three interpreters, one working from German into English, one working from French, and one from Russian, etc. Defendants who did not speak any of the four official languages were provided with consecutive court interpreters.

40|$|Luhmann’s {{concept of}} the „sign as form“ is {{discussed}} in the broader context of Peirce and Serres’ concepts of formation, with an inheritance in the foreground. The assertion is: bifurcation as a result amputates the fundamental operation of form-building by excluding the operator. The operator is the interpretant, who Luhmann subsequently re-introduces as an observer (at a different level). But the interpretant does not permit itself to be excluded; it is always present – as a parasite (Serres). This is demonstrated using a practical case: A woman living in a home writes her will, in which she instates the home warden and his wife as her heirs. One uses a standardized form in the assumption that one is adhering to the prescribed legal form and thereby eliminating any need for further <b>interpretation.</b> The legal <b>proceedings</b> that followed and were instigated by the testatrix’ relatives against the home warden reversed these circumstances. The operation of drawing on a right as an object {{in such a manner}} that the operation in turn claims rights in law, thus becoming a legal sign in itself (Peirce), is parasitic.

40|$|We posit a new {{paradigm}} for image information processing. For the last 25 years, this task was usually approached {{in the frame of}} Treisman's two-stage paradigm [1]. The latter supposes an unsupervised, bottom-up directed process of preliminary information pieces gathering at the lower processing stages and a supervised, top-down directed process of information pieces binding and grouping at the higher stages. It is acknowledged that these sub-processes interact and intervene between them in a tricky and a complicated manner. Notwithstanding the prevalence of this paradigm in biological and computer vision, we nevertheless propose to replace it with a new one, which we would like to designate as a two-part paradigm. In it, information contained in an image is initially extracted in an independent top-down manner by one part of the system, and then it is examined and interpreted by another, separate system part. We argue that the {{new paradigm}} seems to be more plausible than its forerunner. We provide evidence from human attention vision studies and insights of Kolmogorov's complexity theory to support our arguments. We also provide some reasons in favor of separate image <b>interpretation</b> issues.

40|$|Summary: The {{purpose of}} this article is to assess how {{multilingualism}} affects judicial interpretation of EU law. In the EU, the European Court of Justice is in the position of having the ﬁnal say on what EU norms mean. Therefore, the article looks into the case law of that Court. It is well known that all ofﬁcial EU languages (23 of them at present) are authentic languages. Less known is what the related consequences are for <b>interpretation</b> in judicial <b>proceedings.</b> The ﬁrst aim of the article is to ﬁnd out what consequences the ECJ has drawn from this fact. Secondly, even though in some cases (eg CILFIT) the ECJ has postulated language comparison as a necessary step in construing the meaning of EU law, it is clear that such comparisons are not performed on a regular basis. Therefore, the article looks into when, on whose initiative, and for what purpose the Court performs a comparison of the same EU norm(s) expressed in different languages. The article then looks into what the Court does if discrepancies in different language versions are found, and concludes that such a problem is overcome by looking for the purpose of a legal norm. Finally, it is found that multilingualism does not signiﬁcantly affect the manner and outcome of interpretation by the ECJ...|$|R
40|$|It is a self-evident {{fact that}} the 2010 / 64 /EU Directive {{on the right to}} {{translation}} and <b>interpretation</b> in criminal <b>proceedings</b> is a means of guaranteeing equality under law. Since Tampere {{has been one of the}} starting points for the EU (Tampere summit 1998) to establish in all EU Member States guarantees and mechanisms for compliance with procedural safeguards in criminal proceedings, the present conference offers a perfect opportunity to reflect on past and current accomplishments in this field. Although in the meantime a long DG Justice research tradition has been established for over 15 years (see EULITA [URL] the Status Questionis publication (Hertog & Van Gucht (eds.), 2008) was a first eye-opener. After almost 10 years of research, the Agis project wanted with this publication to map the provision of legal interpreting (and translation) in Europe. With 194 responses (out of 1119 questionnaires distributed) it showed not only that Member States were not really concerned with legal interpreting, but also that insights and recommendations of the research projects had not reached the users of legal interpreters, mainly legal actors and/or the institutions/authorities. Nevertheless, the EC itself has continued its efforts to improve procedural safeguards by issuing the 2010 / 64 /EU Directive. Now, the question is to know to what extent the EU Member States have implemented this important Directive. The 2014 CEPEJ (European Commission for the Efficiency of Justice) report entitled “European judicial systems – Edition 2014 (2012 data) : efficiency and quality of justice” ([URL] Evaluation-report-on-European-Judicial-. html) is not very promising. Chapter 16 (pp. 452 - 461) focuses on court interpreters and states that in not less than 13 states or entities the title of court interpreter is neither protected or regulated (p. 456), Belgium being one of them. Therefore, we want to show through a historical overview of the research done that there is an urgent need to work in a more interdisciplinary way. Although research has explored this path since decades, it apparently is still not the case when speaking about collaboration between interpreting, law and psychology research departments and police academies. Hence, research projects with different stakeholders involved like ImPLI, Co-Minor-IN/QUEST and TraiLLD recommend on the one hand joint training sessions with different professional groups and on the other hand closer cooperation with the authorities (Ministries of Justice and Home Affairs) in order to meet the changing needs. This presentation will be a step towards more effective interdisciplinary work and will discuss strategies to increase multidisciplinary cooperation: more effective dissemination by involving the interpreter users in research or organizing joint training, to name just a few. status: publishe...|$|R
