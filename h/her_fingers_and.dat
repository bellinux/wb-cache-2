25|$|A new villainous Star Sapphire {{debuted in}} Green Lantern Vol 5 #21 (August 2013). Prixiam Nol-Anj {{was a former}} {{prisoner}} of the Oan sciencells, imprisoned for a slew of different crimes: racketeering, smuggling, extortion, murder for hire, abduction, trafficking in organisms, larceny, grand theft starship, and assault with an energy weapon. Over time, she uses her wiles to beguile her guard, a Green Lantern named Cossite, and he {{falls in love with}} her. When Larfleeze attacks Oa {{in the aftermath of the}} First Lantern's defeat and the death of the Guardians, his constructs kill a Star Sapphire who arrived to aid in the defense of the planet. The fallen Sapphire's ring flies to Nol-Anj's cell, where it declares her eligible to become a Star Sapphire herself. Nol-Anj persuades Cossite that the ring's presence is proof that her love for him is true, and he readily opens the door and allows her to slip the ring onto <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>and</b> acquire its power. To his understandable shock, she then kills him, declaring that the love in her heart that the ring detected was not for him, but for the Clann she belonged to, that accepted her when no one else would.|$|E
500|$|After the London Paralympics, Dodd took up {{wheelchair}} basketball. She {{started for}} the Sydney University Flames in the Women's National Wheelchair Basketball League in 2013. She has to strap <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>and</b> wrists, and usually dislocates a shoulder during a game. [...] "I've had a few bangs and scrapes and been tipped out of my chair a few times," [...] she concedes, [...] "but it's really fun. The fast pace really gives you an adrenalin kick and the girls I play with are awesome." [...] "If I have chose between my two sports for Rio," [...] she said, [...] "I will go with basketball." ...|$|E
500|$|To promote [...] "Express" [...] and Burlesque, Aguilera has {{performed}} the track on two shows. Aguilera performed [...] "Express" [...] {{for the first}} time at the American Music Awards of 2010 on November 21, 2010, held at the Nokia Theatre in Los Angeles, California. During an interview with MTV News about the performance, Aguilera stated that the performance would be [...] "fantastic" [...] and would [...] "give a fitting look inside the movie". Wearing a [...] "black spangly bodysuit" [...] with knee-high boots and a bowler, Aguilera seated in a chair with her back to the audience in the beginning of the show. She began to snap <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>and</b> leaned into the [...] "jazzy, skittery rhythms" [...] of [...] "Express". Later, the scene revealed a set made up to mimic the backstage at a burlesque club, with the singer surrounded by a number of dancers. Gil Kaufman of MTV News said that the performance is a flash back to the [...] "Dirrty-era" [...] of Aguilera.|$|E

500|$|The revamped show in 2014 {{received}} acclaim by critics. Isabel Mohan from The Daily Telegraph acclaimed the revamped show {{praising the}} singer's sex appeal {{and noted that}} although the set included many new songs, the singer [...] "remained strikingly composed and confident throughout a show which proved her talent, charisma and awe-inspiring thighs". Sidney Madden who praised the upgraded set list further commended the show's fashion. Digital Spy's Robert Copsey felt that the show's set list {{was better than the}} original one describing the tour as [...] "wall-to-wall amazing Beyoncé". He concluded in his review, [...] "The relentless pace, ever-changing visuals and sheer amount of songs crammed into the set is a lot to take in, let alone the fact that Beyoncé delivers the entire thing with power yet impeccable ease. When it comes to putting on a show of this calibre, these days she's really only competing with herself." [...] The Observers Kitty Empire praised the singer's ranuchiness during the tour different from the other performers and concluded by writing, [...] "There is no question as to Beyoncé's own powers. She can stop and start her all-female band... with a click of <b>her</b> <b>fingers,</b> <b>and</b> keep climbing octaves until you think her lungs are about to jump out of her chest. She sings (with a range that only gets wider and deeper with every tour) and dances (flawlessly) for more than one and a half hours." [...] David Pollock of The Independent felt that, [...] "this near two-hour epic is a ferocious distillation of musical styles old and new and a stunning declaration of intent that Knowles intends to be recognised as the defining pop artist of her era. It was, at the very least, one of the hardest working shows likely to be witnessed on a stage this year, and with barely a drop of minutely-choreographed sweat to be seen." ...|$|E
2500|$|A self-taught left-handed guitarist, Cotten {{developed}} her own original style. She {{played a}} guitar strung for a right-handed player, but played it upside down, {{as she was}} left-handed. This position required her to play the bass lines with <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>and</b> the melody with her thumb. Her signature alternating bass style {{has become known as}} [...] "Cotten picking".|$|E
2500|$|Her direct {{physical}} senses were deadened, and Norma {{no longer}} cared about taste, touch, or smell ... She found it remarkable to see webbing between <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>and</b> toes. Her face, once blunt-featured and later flawlessly beautiful, {{now had a}} small mouth and tiny eyes surrounded by smooth folds. Her head was immense, {{while the rest of}} her body atrophied to a useless appendage.|$|E

2500|$|At this time, {{country music}} began to eclipse rock, and Mitchell {{wanted to play}} the guitar. As her mother disapproved of its hillbilly associations, she settled {{initially}} for the ukulele. Eventually she taught herself guitar from a Pete Seeger songbook, but the polio had affected <b>her</b> <b>fingers,</b> <b>and</b> she had to devise dozens of alternative tunings of her own. Later this improvised approach was [...] "a tool to break free of standard approaches to harmony and structure" [...] in her own songwriting.|$|E
2500|$|A small role as Barbara Hall {{followed}} in Hudson's Bay (1941) with Paul Muni and she co-starred as Ellie Mae Lester in John Ford's comedy Tobacco Road (also 1941), {{and played the}} title role in Belle Starr, Zia in Sundown, and Victoria Charteris (Poppy Smith) in The Shanghai Gesture. She played Eve in [...] (1942), {{as well as the}} dual role of Susan Miller (Linda Worthington) in Rouben Mamoulian's screwball comedy Rings on <b>Her</b> <b>Fingers,</b> <b>and</b> roles as Kay Saunders in Thunder Birds, and Miss Young in China Girl (all 1942).|$|E

But from now on when a baby girl is born to your tribe you shall go and find a spider web woven at the mouth of some hole; you must take it and rub it on the baby's hand and arm. Thus, when she grows up she will weave, and <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>and</b> arms will not tire from the weaving." ...|$|E

2500|$|Collins {{was born}} the eldest of five {{siblings}} in Seattle, Washington, where she spent the first ten years of her life. Her father, a blind singer, pianist and radio show host, took a job in Denver, Colorado, in 1949, and the family moved there. Collins studied classical piano with Antonia Brico, making her public debut at age 13, performing Mozart's Concerto for Two Pianos. Brico took a dim view, both then and later, of Collins' developing interest in folk music, which {{led her to the}} difficult decision to discontinue her piano lessons. Years later, after she became known internationally, she invited Brico to one of her concerts in Denver. When they met after the performance, Brico took both of Collins' hands in hers, looked wistfully at <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>and</b> said, [...] "Little Judy—you really could have gone places." [...] Still later, Collins discovered that Brico herself had made a living when she was younger playing jazz and ragtime piano (Singing Lessons, pp.71–72). In her early life, Collins had the good fortune of meeting many professional musicians through her father.|$|E
2500|$|When the Arvizo {{family and}} Jackson were on good terms, their mother, Janet, {{allegedly}} encouraged {{her children to}} call Jackson [...] "Daddy." [...] Janet, who also went by the names Janet Ventura and Janet Jackson, was identified as the most problematic of the prosecution witnesses. Besides her credibility issues, her behavior in the courtroom was widely criticized. Roger Friedman reported, [...] "it's pretty clear that she's mentally ill in some way" [...] and that [...] "when she first starts testifying, she's very sedate, and as time goes by, and possibly medication wears off, she becomes crazier and crazier, {{and you can hear}} people in the courtroom saying 'here it comes.'" [...] On a few occasions, the courtroom erupted in laughter over her answers. After the trial, jurors criticized her habit of snapping <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>and</b> staring at them. She was often unresponsive even to the prosecution, was defensive over seemingly small issues, and was admonished by the judge for arguing. [...] She used repeated catchphrases such as, [...] "It's burned inside my memory," [...] and [...] "Money doesn't buy happiness." [...] She often answered questions with tangential speeches addressed directly to the jury, the press, or the defendant. [...] Defense attorney Tom Mesereau refused to object to her rambling and emotional diatribes, which resulted in prosecutor Sneddon repeatedly objecting to his own witness's answers. It was also revealed that Janet Arvizo had enrolled all three of her children in acting classes and had accused a JC Penney security guard of sexually molesting her in 1998. In February 2006, Janet Arvizo was convicted of welfare fraud for failing to report the $150,000 civil settlement in that case. She was sentenced to 150 hours of community service and an $8,600 fine.|$|E
