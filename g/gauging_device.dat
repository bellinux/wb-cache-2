5000|$|The machine used {{is called}} a {{squaring}} shear, power shear, or guillotine. The machine may be foot powered, less commonly hand powered, or mechanically or hydraulically powered. It works by first clamping the material with a ram. A moving blade then comes down across a fixed blade to shear the material. For larger shears the moving blade may be set on an angle or [...] "rocked" [...] in order to shear the material progressively {{from one side to}} the other; this angle is referred to as the shear angle. Setting the blade on an angle decreases the amount of force required, but increases the stroke. A 5 degree shear angle decreases the force by about 20%. The amount of energy used is still the same. The moving blade may also be inclined 0.5 to 2.5°, called the rake angle, to keep the material from becoming wedged between the blades. However, raking the blade compromises the squareness of the edge. The machine consists of a shear table, work-holding device, upper and lower blades, and a <b>gauging</b> <b>device.</b> The shear table is the part of the machinery that the workpiece rests on while being sheared. The work-holding device is used to hold the workpiece in place and keep it from moving or buckling while under stress. The upper and lower blades are the piece of machinery that actually do the cutting, while the <b>gauging</b> <b>device</b> is used to ensure that the workpiece is being cut where it is supposed to be.|$|E

40|$|Acoustic flow-meters are <b>gauging</b> <b>devices</b> {{commonly}} used in urban hydrology. Many of them {{are based on the}} Doppler principle and their use is based on the hypothesis that the velocity of suspended particles is equal to the flow velocity. Thus, at least a small amount of backscattering particles (or bubbles) is required for the use of acoustic Doppler velocimeters. In the same time, due to thermal conductivity and viscosity effects, the intensity of an ultrasonic wave propagating in an homogeneous medium decreases. In suspension an additional attenuation due to scattering and absorption by particles contribute to the intensity decay. This term depends on the particles nature and concentration. There is a complete lack of data for runoff and wastewaters. Moreover the density of the particles ranges between 1. 03 and 1. 3 and their granulometry is roughly known. In order to quantify the attenuation by wastewaters solids, an experimental set-up has been developed. The attenuation measurement for various types of particles is presented.

40|$|The {{thickness}} of the steel strip is an important indicator of the overall strip quality. Deviations in thickness are primarily controlled using the automatic gauge control (AGC) system of each rolling stand. At the last stand, the monitoring AGC system is usually used, where the deviations in thickness can be directly measured by the X-ray thickness <b>gauge</b> <b>device</b> and used as the input to the AGC system. However, due to the physical distance between the thickness detection device and the rolling stand, time delay is unavoidably present in the thickness control loop, which can affect control performance and lead to system oscillations. Furthermore, {{the parameters of the}} system can change due to perturbations from external disturbances. Therefore, this paper proposes an identification and control scheme for monitoring AGC system that can handle time delay and parameter uncertainty. The cross-correlation function is used to estimate the time delay of the system, while the system parameters are identified using a recursive least squares method. The time delay and parameter estimates are then further refined using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, so as to provide the most accurate parameter estimates for the complete system. Simulation results show that, compared with the standard Proportion Integration Differentiation (PID) controller approach, the proposed approach is not affected by changes in the time delay and parameter uncertainties...|$|R

Traction force increased with increasing balloon volume from 62 (50 - 73) g at 2 ml to 86 (70 - 105) g at 4 ml (p < 0. 05), indicating distension related modulation of peristaltic force. Patients with oesophagitis generated lower traction forces on swallowing 30 (20 - 40) g compared with the normal subjects (p < 0. 01), the degree of impairment being greatest in those patients with the most severe mucosal damage.

To highlight historical, theological, and sexual medicine-related aspects of SREs throughout the ages. Methods. Review of old medical books on male sexual functioning and review of scientific medical and theological articles on SREs from about 1900 on. Results. The cyclic character of SREs was first noted by German researchers in the forties of the 20 th century. However, already {{before the beginning of}} the Christian era, one knew that men had erections and ejaculations during sleep. In the Middle Ages, SREs were generally considered to be rebellious manifestations of the male body, while it seemed to disobey its owner and showed up its perverted and sinful side. From the fifteenth {{to the end of the}} 17 th century, severe erectile dysfunction (ED) was ground for divorce. The ecclesiastical court records show that if necessary, the members of the jury sat at the defendant's bedside at night to be able to judge any SREs occurring. Since the 17 th century, SREs were considered to be part of masturbation, which could cause many ailments and diseases. Psychoanalyst Stekel acknowledged in 1920 that a morning erection, the last SRE, is a naturally occurring phenomenon in healthy men from infancy to old age. Today, some scientists assume that SREs protect the integrity of the penile cavernous bodies. Conclusions. Throughout the ages, philosophers, theologians, physicians, members of ecclesial law courts, psychoanalysts, psychiatrists, sexologists, physiologists, and urologists have shown interest in SREs.
