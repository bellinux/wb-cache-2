The negative option fee led to lawsuits filed against TCI by ten states, eventually causing the company to back away from utilizing the billing method for the channel. Many other cable providers were reluctant to offer Encore in its early years due to concerns that it would cannibalize subscriptions of other premium services. However, Sie positioned the channel as such that would bolster the growth of what had been a lagging pay television industry, as premium channels had been seeing a steady decline in subscribers overall since the late 1980s.|$|E

40|$|I {{consider}} the workings, under free entry, of some plausible mechanisms enforcing product quality {{when it is}} not readily observed by buyers, but is chosen by sellers: there is a moral hazard problem to be overcome. In equilibrium, uninformed buyers can often take price as indicating quality. This is however not the sarne as Spence's signalling notion, since quality is chosen by sellers. It is fruitful to consider price as a commitment, which changes the quality-incentives in a common-knowledge way. In the introduction, I note briefly much of the relevant literature, including my M. Phil, thesis. In Chapter 1, on Repeat-Sales, I consider a continuous model of that incentive to quality. With strong simplifying assumptions, I am able to solve for 'competitive' equilibrium, which involves a bunding of buyers at the minimum quality level, price premia for higher qualities, and consequent inefficiencies. The second chapter is the theory of cheating. It is possible, but costly, for buyers to be 'vigilant'; but equilibrium cannot involve their all being vigilant. There are various externalities between buyers. Different prices can exist in equilibrium, with different honesty levels. I identify a key feature of the cost function, which (together with buyers' tastes, etc.) determines equilibrium. In Chapter 3, I consider <b>introductory</b> <b>offers</b> and their role in entry and quality-signalling, when buyers are very rational. When buyers are identical, a single entrant will never use <b>introductory</b> <b>offers.</b> If there are many entrants, a low first-period price will be observed, but it conveys no information. Only some quality levels can (credibly) be promised by an entrant, and the result is that an incumbent can make positive profits but prevent entry. </p...|$|R

40|$|Adverse {{selection}} {{is one of}} the most celebrated phenomena in the economics of information. Yet despite a burgeoning economics and finance literature consisting of literally hundreds of articles exploring the implications of adverse selection in credit markets, there remains little in the way of empirical studies which convincingly document the existence of adverse selection in credit markets as a real-world phenomenon. This paper examines the results of large-scale randomized trials in preapproved credit card solicitations for direct evidence of adverse selection. Four basic conclusions are reached. First, there is clear evidence of adverse selection on observable information: respondents to solicitations are substantially worse credit risks than nonrespondents. Second, comparing the customer pools resulting from different offers, solicitations offering inferior terms (e. g., a higher introductory interest rate, a shorter duration to the <b>introductory</b> <b>offer,</b> or a higher post-introductory interest rate) yield customer pools with worse observable credit-risk characteristics than solicitations offering superior terms. Third, there is also clear evidence of adverse selection on hidden information: even after controlling for all information known by the card issuer at the time the account is opened, customers who accept inferior offers are significantly more likely to default. Fourth, recipients of credit card solicitations appear to overrespond to the introductory interest rate relative to the duration of the <b>introductory</b> <b>offer</b> and to the postintroductory interest rate, consistent with the author's “underestimation hypothesis ” that consumers may systematically underestimate the extent of their current and future credit card borrowing.

30|$|Providing many {{attractive}} offers, {{credit card}} companies have a business inquiry regarding how consumers respond to their different contract offers. A number of research efforts previously examined a consumers’ choice and an effect of offers. For example, Shui and Ausubel (2004) found that more consumers accepted an <b>introductory</b> <b>offer</b> which had a lower interest rate with a shorter duration than a higher interest rate with a longer duration. Meanwhile, Agarwal et al. (2006) assessed the rationality by using a credit card experiment dataset, in which consumers made their financial decisions between two contracts with two combinations on annual fees and interest rates. Unfortunately, their studies focused {{on the type of}} offers on credit cards. Balance transfer offers were not examined in these studies, but currently becoming a more popular and important issue to {{credit card companies}} than before.|$|E
40|$|Many new web-based {{services}} are introduced as free services. Depending on the seller’s business model, some remain {{free in the}} long run, while others switch to pay mode {{at some point in}} time. I characterize the relation between buyers and a new service seller when the former are uncertain about the latter’s business model and need to incur a one-time sunk cost before enjoying the new service. I derive a natural signaling equilibrium where the seller plays a “lockin-and-switch” strategy, while buyers play a “wait-and-see ” strategy. Specifically, a high-cost seller starts by pricing at zero and waits for a sufficient number of consumers to adopt the new service, at which point the seller switches to pay mode. In this semi-separating equilibrium, the signal is given not by the price level (which always starts at zero) but rather by the duration of the <b>introductory</b> <b>offer.</b> Finally, I show the equilibrium entails diffusion even though consumers are identical and equally aware of the new service’s existence...|$|E

40|$|We study {{rationing}} {{as a tool}} of the monopolist’s pricing strategy when {{demand is}} uncertain. Three pricing strategies are potentially optimal in our environment: uniform pricing, final sales, and introductory offers. The final sales strategy consists in charging a high price initially, but then lowering the price while committing to a total capacity. Consumers with high valuations to pay may decide to buy at the high price since the endogenous probability of rationing is higher at the lower price. The introductory offers strategy consists in selling a limited quantity at a low price initially, and then raising price. Those consumers with high valuations who were rationed initially at the lower price may find it optimal to buy the good at the higher price. We show that while the introductory offers strategy may dominate uniform pricing, it is never optimal if the monopolist can use the final sales strategy. rationing, priority pricing, sales, demand uncertainty, <b>introductory</b> <b>offer,</b> price dispersion...|$|E
40|$|The {{introduction}} of the credit card in the mid-twentieth century revolutionized and transformed how people live. Based {{on a set of}} new survey data, this dissertation empirically investigates and analyzes consumers 2 ̆ 7 behavior in the credit card market. Specifically, it investigates the underlying determinants of consumers 2 ̆ 7 choices regarding switching credit-card balances. To estimate the likelihood that consumers switch credit cards, two logit models are estimated. Using data from the Consumer Finance Monthly (CFM) of The Ohio State University, the author finds that at the conventional 5 percent level of significance, the following variables have significance: old interest rate, new interest rate, duration of the introductory rate, balances, number of credit cards, home ownership, and age. As expected, interest rates, balance, and the duration of new <b>introductory</b> <b>offer</b> rates have the greatest influence on why or why not people switch credit cards. The findings are consistent with the view that consumers make rational decisions in the credit card market, since balance-carrying consumers are sensitive to the terms of credit card contracts, such as the interest rate on existing balances, the new rate, and the duration of the new rate. It also implies that switching costs are important, challenging Ausubel 2 ̆ 7 s (1991) argument of credit card consumer irrationality and Calem and Mester 2 ̆ 7 s (1995) empirical finding that credit card rates are sticky because consumers are irresponsive and to rate cuts...|$|E
30|$|Usage and {{response}} of consumers in credit card market Shimp and Moody (2000) provided the theoretical {{explanation for the}} credit card effect. Gross and Souleles (2002) analyzed how consumer debt responded to changes in credit supply. They found that an increase in credit limits generated immediate and significant rises in debt, which was inconsistent with permanent-income hypothesis (PIH). 1 This study also estimated the elasticity of debt to interest rates and found that people were in fact sensitive to interest rates and higher interest rates leaded to substantially less borrowing. As discussed previously, Shui and Ausubel (2004) observed two phenomena which suggested time inconsistency in consumer behavior. One of the two phenomena was that more consumers accepted an <b>introductory</b> <b>offer</b> which had a lower interest rate with a shorter duration than a higher interest rate with a longer duration. The other phenomenon was that consumers were reluctant to switch. The authors analyzed a credit card dataset and used a hyperbolic discounting model to rationalize observed behavior of consumers. Besides such previous studies, Agarwal et al. (2007) examined how consumers responded to the 2001 federal income tax rebate, which was regarded as the “lumpy” increase. They suggested that on average, consumers initially saved some amount of their income tax rebates {{and used it to}} increase their credit card payments, so paying debt down. Soon afterward, consumers’ spending was increased. It is widely known that the use of tax rebates is important economic behavior for every household. After they started the interesting point of “lumpy” tax rebates, Gross et al. (2012) studied how the 2001 and 2008 tax rebates affected consumer bankruptcy filings.|$|E
