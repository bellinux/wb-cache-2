50|$|The narrator, a {{professor}} at a local college, has a conversation one day with a student, trying to explain the difficulties concerning gays and wanting love and companionship. Frank concludes that gays are no different from regular humans {{by saying that the}} reason why homosexuals are so promiscuous is because “they were looking for love... and they thought they could get love from sex” (77). The student responds by stating that sex gave them AIDS and that “they should have known” better than to have sex promiscuously. The situation introduces confusion outsiders are often met with when trying to understand the gay culture. The student does not understand the thought process of homosexuals, who are only looking for love and life as any regular human desire. The student exemplifies the idea of society unable to accept and understand homosexuals, which <b>is</b> <b>brings</b> about the inability to accept gay culture. The idea of struggling to come to terms and the hardships of being able to be free to display sexual preferences within society are prevalent through the narrator and his actions.|$|E

He claims that the only proof that {{something}} <b>is</b> <b>brings</b> one pleasure is if someone finds it pleasurable. Next he talks about how morality is the basic way to achieve happiness. He also discusses in this chapter that Utilitarianism is beneficial for virtue. He says that [...] "it maintains not only that virtue is to be desired, {{but that it is}} to be desired disinterestedly, for itself." [...] (Mill 24) In his final chapter Mill looks and the connection between Utilitarianism and justice. He contemplates the question of whether justice is something distinct from Utility or not. He reasons this question in several different ways and finally comes to the conclusion that in certain cases justice is essential for Utility, but in others social duty is far more important than justice. Mill believes that [...] "justice must give way to some other moral principle, but that what is just in ordinary cases is, by reason of that other principle, not just in the particular case."

He is later the sole survivor of that group of scientists that escaped in the relic, along with the Segawa siblings and Agito Makishima's aids, after the destruction of the Relic's point base. The scientists were infected by a deadly virus as Cronos' means of keeping them under control. The only way to escape death is to be supplied with regular shots or to become Zoanoids. The only way to become a Zoanoid and yet not be slaves to the Zoalords is to become a Lost Number. Since supplies of the medicine were running out, they resorted to attempt to becoming Lost Numbers.

40|$|This {{report is}} written {{to give the}} readers an idea about fixed assets {{disposal}} in a multinational company {{and how they can}} dispose of their fixed assets. One of the recommended methods of fixed asset disposal is sale by public auction. Auctions are a public sale in which the price is determined by bidding, and the item is sold to the highest bidder. Auctions are conducted with the hope of giving a contribution in generating competitive bidding among potential buyers, reducing the marketing time and absorption and leading to an achievement of fair market value. This is a causal-comparative study, as the writer explores the cause and the effect of using auction as the means to dispose fixed assets. The major theory applied was Baye 's classification of auction to classify and explain the types of auction and how a company benefits from such kinds of auction. Auctions are recommended as a good way to dispose fixed assets since it <b>is</b> <b>brings</b> a lot of benefit for a company...|$|E
40|$|The {{usefulness}} of wavelet transform and wavelet filtering techniques {{for the improvement}} of the estimation of the decay ratio (DR), characterising the stability of BWRs, is discussed. There are two distinct areas investigated. The first concerns the improvement {{of the quality of the}} traditionally used auto-correlation function (ACF) for the estimation of the DR, by trend elimination and denoising. The subsequent estimation of the DR itself is made by traditional methods such as the peak-topeak method or curve fitting. The second area is the estimation of the DR by the use of continuous wavelet transform. The possibility of estimating two different DRs in case of dual oscillations, and in particular the finding of the higher DR, is also investigated. It was found that wavelet pre-processing does not always improve the estimation of the ACF of a non-ideal signal, compared to other methods; but for signals containing various trends and data scatter in the ACF, <b>is</b> <b>brings</b> a noticeable improvement. As an extension of the discrete wavelet methods, the continuous wavelet transform appears to be a promising candidate to determine the critical DR even in the case of two oscillations being co existent with different stability properties. The methods investigated or developed here were also tested on measured data from Swedish BWRs...|$|E

This study evaluated the effectiveness of performance appraisal tools in Tanzanian banking sector in Mwanza City, Tanzania. A case of four banks: CRDB, NMB, Exim Bank and CBA. The study adopted a descriptive research design incorporating quantitative and qualitative approach. The sample of 102 employees was surveyed using in-depth interview and questionnaire. Quantitative data was analyzed descriptively using SPSS while thematic analysis was used to analyze qualitative data. The findings of this study revealed that all banks use the same tool that is Management by Objectives (MBO). The tool was found useful to the banks as it <b>is</b> <b>brings</b> about the required outcomes of its use, employees have higher level of understanding about the tool that is they understand how to conduct it, they are trained about PA and that PA is fair in terms of procedures, information, relationship and equity. The study also found that employees especially managers are not in favor of the tool because it does not allow multiple rating. Furthermore; the study revealed that in one of the bank only management and senior level employees are appraise. Recommendations were given that all employees should be appraised regardless of their positions and that the banks should consider the use of the tool that will enable employees to get wider understanding of their performance from different raters. ...|$|E
40|$|The non-surgical {{treatments}} for hemorrhoids are cost and time-saving techniques usually performed in patients suffering early hemorrhoidal disease. The most used are rubber band ligation (RBL), injection sclerotherapy (IS), and infrared coagulation (IRC). We performed a systematic review {{in order to}} evaluate: do these procedures really help to avoid further more aggressive treatments? What are the common harms? What are the rare harms? How many recurrences there are? A total of 21 RCTs were included in this review: 12 on RBL, 4 on IRC and 5 on IS. In RBL bleeding stops in up to 90 % and III degree hemorrhoids improves in 78 %- 83. 8 %. IV degree prolapse should have a more invasive treatment. The commonest complications are bleeding and pain (8 - 80 %). IRC related improvement is 78 %, 51 % and 22 % for I, II and III degree. Post-operative pain occurs in 15 - 100 % and post-operative bleeding ranges from 15 % to 44 %. Recurrence rate is 13 % at a three months follow-up. <b>IS</b> <b>brings</b> to the resolution of prolapse in 90 %- 100 % of II degree and allows good results for III degree even if reported only by case series. The post-procedural pain is 36 %- 49 %. Bleeding is a very rare harm.

40|$|The {{pattern of}} several {{physiological}} parameters such as body temperature, respiratory rate, heart rate, haematocrit, Hb content, which {{are closely related}} to thermoregulatory potential, have been investigated with the purpose to assess shearing and sheltering influence on thermoregulation. Thirty clinically healthy and well-fed yearling ewes, Comisana breed, aged 8 months, underwent this trial. 7 days prior to the beginning of this study, all subjects were equally distributed in three groups with different sheltering conditions: group A was kept in an outdoor pen, group B was kept in a pen equipped with a shady net (80 % of shading) and group C was kept in an outdoor sheepfold with an attached paddock. As to feeding conditions, groups A and B were fed daily on: hay (2 kg), wheat straw (1 kg), wheat concentrate (0. 5 kg) and water ad libitum; the remaining ewes grazed on a wheat stubble pasture for 6 h/day, and were sheltered during midday warmer hours. Through a simultaneous monitoring equipment (Schiller Argus Tm 7) and a blood collection by means of a jugular venipuncture parameters assessment was carried out for each subject before shearing and during the following five days at a fixed time during morning. A Student T test was applied to determine any statistic significance between groups and within each group. Statistically significant differences were observed for all parameters under investigations. These results suggest that shearing <b>is</b> <b>brings</b> about adaptive responses, which are influenced by shelter conditions as well. More specifically, obtained results underline that shading net provides a more comfortable microclimatic environment...|$|E
