40|$|Original {{scientific}} paper The paper {{investigates the}} influence of different parameters on stress distribution in the contact area of mechanical elements. The study is aimed to determine particular positions in the contacting bodies, where small crack should be initiated due to large stresses resulting from different contact conditions. A two-dimensional equivalent contact model together with Hertzian contact theory is used for all computational analyses utilising the finite element method. The distribution of the maximum equivalent von Mises stress under the contacting area is first determined for pure Hertzian contact conditions, where the maximum stresses appear at a certain depth under the contacting surface. Then a parametric study to determine {{the influence of}} loading, contact surface curvature, contact friction, residual stresses and elasto-hydro-dynamic lubrication on the stress distribution is performed. They tend to increase the stresses and move their maximum to or very close to the contacting surface, which can lead to sub-surface or surface crack initiation. In this study the surface crack initiation and propagation on the <b>gear</b> <b>teeth</b> <b>flank</b> is presented. The virtual crack extension (VCE) method, implemented in the finite element method, is used for simulating the fatigue crack propagation from the initial crack up to the formation of the surface pit.

By an analytical characterization of this singularity we obtain a two-dimensional parameterization of the generated flank for any machine parameter set. The necessary partial derivatives of the vector function are computed with the help {{of automatic}} differentiation.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{probabilistic}} risk of <b>gear</b> <b>tooth</b> <b>flank</b> micro-pitting in wind turbine (WT) gearboxes and shows how relatively slow rate of supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) data, recorded during operation, {{can be used}} to analyse the onset of gear surface damage. Field measured time series of SCADA signals, including wind speed, generator power and rotational speed, were used to obtain the statistical variation of gear shaft torque and rotational speed. From the SCADA data obtained over a 2. 2 year period random number datasets of smaller sizes were selected. Based on these random number datasets the effect of gear shaft torque and rotational speed variations on the probabilistic risk of gear micro-pitting was investigated. Determinations of the <b>gear</b> <b>tooth</b> <b>flank</b> contact stress and lubricant film thickness were based on the technical report of gear micro-pitting, ISO/TR 15144 - 1 (2010). The study has shown that the considered pinion gear is subjected to high load conditions resulting in high contact stresses. The variation of rotational speed causes greater sliding between the <b>gear</b> <b>teeth.</b> The results of specific lubricant film thicknesses have shown that there is considerable risk of gear micro-pitting under the operational conditions recorded from the SCADA field data...|$|R
40|$|A {{two-dimensional}} {{computational model}} for simulation of contact fatigue of <b>gear</b> <b>teeth</b> <b>flanks</b> is presented. In the model, {{it is assumed}} that the initial crack of length 0. 015 mm is initiated at the surface due to previous mechanical or heat treatment of the material as well {{as a consequence of the}} running in process. The discretized model with the initial crack is then subjected to normal contact pressure, which takes into account the elasto-hydro-dynamic (EHD) lubrication conditions, and tangential loading due to friction between contacting surfaces. The model also considers the moving contact of gear flanks, fluid trapped in the crack and residual stresses due to heat treatment of the material on crack propagation. The virtual crack extension (VCE) method, implemented in the finite element method, is then usedfor simulating the fatigue crack growth from the initial crack up to the formation of the surface pit. The computational results show that the initial surface crack of length 15 m and the considered boundary conditions lead to the appearance of very small surface pits, which can be termed as micro-pitting on <b>gear</b> <b>teeth</b> <b>flanks.</b> The numerical results correspond well withavailable experimental data...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{the method of}} the discretization of the <b>gear</b> <b>tooth</b> <b>flank</b> in involute segments for the determination of conjugate <b>gear</b> <b>tooth</b> profiles. Instead of following a point-to-point analytical approach {{to the problem of}} determining the path of contact and the geometry of the generating rack and the mating wheel, the actual <b>tooth</b> <b>flank</b> is considered to be composed of infinitesimal local involutes and therefore a closed solution can be achieved. Due to its simplicity, the method is faster than the standard theory of gearing and this is particularly useful in problems requiring iterative calculations of the tooth geometry such as gear optimization. The method is implemented on modified involute as well as loboid gears used in lobe pumps and it is verified against existing theories. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Most {{wind turbine}} {{gearboxes}} and pitch/yaw reducers consist of several planetary geartrains. Planetary geartrains allow gearboxes to be small, light, low noise, and efficient. The {{most important factors}} in the planetary geartrain design are load sharing among the planet gears and load distribution on the <b>gear</b> <b>tooth</b> <b>flank.</b> This {{study was conducted to}} analyze the load sharing and distribution in reducers with and without a slewing bearing. Load sharing and distribution of a pitch reducer without a slewing bearing were very uniform and even. However, in the other case, they were non-uniform and uneven, and the gear meshes were formed on the right or left. These results show that heavy loads act on the right or left flank of a meshed gear pair and reduce the gear life. Therefore, the slewing bearing must be considered when pitch/yaw reducers are designed and analyzed...|$|R

The motion of the contact sliding load is simulated with different load cases. The strain energy density (SED) and maximum tangential stress (MTS) crack propagation criteria are modified to account for the influence of internal pressure along the crack surfaces due to trapped fluid.

In view of small crack lengths observed in surface pitting, the simulation {{takes into account the}} short crack growth theory. The stress field in the contact area and the required functional relationship between thestress intensity factor and the crack length are determined by the finite element method. An equivalent model of two contacting cylinders is used for numerical simulations of crack propagation in the contact area.

40|$|High-accuracy gears are {{necessary}} to ensure the strength and silence of compact geared motors. Heat-treated surface-hardened small gears are employed in the reducer of a compact geared motor. The heat treatment causes distortion, which deteriorates the gear accuracy. To remove this distortion, surface-hardened small gears are rehobbed with a carbide hob. The rehobbing makes a tool mark on the <b>gear</b> <b>tooth</b> surface. This tool mark leads not only to strength deterioration of the tooth surface, but also vibration and noise. Therefore, a surface finishing method that eliminates the tool mark is required. However, {{it is difficult to}} finish surface-hardened small gears. This study proposes a tooth surface finishing method for a surface-hardened small gear. The method employs a gear-shaped tool composed of alumina-fiber-reinforced plastic (ALFRP) and a surface finishing device with an oscillation/traverse system. The proposed method was used in an experiment to remove the tool mark on the <b>gear</b> <b>tooth</b> <b>flank</b> of a surface-hardened small gear rehobbed by the carbide hob.

The shot peened gears exhibited pitting fatigue lives 1. 6 times the life of standard gears without shot peening. Residual stress measurements and analysis indicate that the longer fatigue life {{is the result of}} the higher compressive stress produced by the shot peening. The life for the shot peened gear was calculated to be 1. 5 times that for the plain gear by using the measured residual stress difference for the standard and shot peened gears.

40|$|External {{involute}} {{helical gears}} are usually manufactured through hobbing, commonly with a subsequent grinding or skiving operation. One way towards the industrial pursuit of more competitive and sustainable manufacturing {{is to reduce}} the number of processes, while retaining functionality and quality. In the hobbing of gears, the manufacturing errors are most often connected to the tool and/or the fixture. These errors need to be kept within tight tolerances to achieve sufficient quality of a finished hobbed gear. It would therefore be of great interest to be able to predetermine the quality of a finished hobbed gear, based on tolerances of the manufacturing process. Thereby the motivation is to analyze the impact of these errors, on the tooth surface of a hobbed gear. In this paper the manufacturing process is simulated, using an analytical geometric mathematical model, to determine the geometry of the hobbed <b>gear</b> <b>tooth</b> <b>flank</b> in three dimensions.

40|$|Wind turbine gearbox {{operates}} under a {{wide array}} of highly fluctuating and dynamic load conditions caused by the stochastic nature of wind and operational wind turbine controls. Micropitting damage is one of failure modes commonly observed in wind turbine gearboxes. This article investigates gear micropitting of high-speed stage gears of a wind turbine gearbox operating under nominal and varying load and speed conditions. Based on the ISO standard of gear micropitting (ISO/TR 15144 - 1 : 2010) and considering the operating load and speed conditions, a theoretical study is carried out to assess the risk of gear micropitting by determining the contact stress, sliding parameter, local contact temperature and lubricant film thickness along the line of action of <b>gear</b> <b>tooth</b> contact. The non-uniform distributions of temperature and lubricant film thickness over the <b>tooth</b> <b>flank</b> are observed due to the conditions of torque and rotational speed variations and sliding contact along the <b>gear</b> <b>tooth</b> <b>flanks.</b> The lubricant film thickness varies along the <b>tooth</b> <b>flank</b> and is at the lowest when the tip of the driving gear engages with the root of the driven gear. The lubricant film thickness increases with the increase of rotational speed and decreases as torque and sliding increase. It can be concluded that micropitting is most likely to initiate at the addendum of driving gear and the dedendum of driven gear. The lowest film thickness occurs when the torque is high and the rotational speed is at the lowest which may cause direct tooth surface contact. At the low-torque condition, the varying rotational speed condition may cause a considerable variation of lubricant film thickness thus interrupting the lubrication which may result in micropitting...|$|R

Equations for computing flank surface area of <b>gear</b> <b>tooth</b> <b>flank</b> surfaces in terms geometric parameters of involute profile of straight bevel gears were also developed. The developed models were validated by conducting twelve experiments using one-factor-at-a-time approach and varying applied voltage, pulse-on time and pulse-off time each at four levels.

40|$|Form {{grinding}} is {{a popular}} finishing process in manufacturing cylindrical <b>gears</b> with <b>tooth</b> <b>flank</b> modification.

In this method, the motion of each following axis is formulated as a six-order polynomial of the leading axis position and the sensitivity of <b>tooth</b> ground <b>flanks</b> with respect to the changes in the motion polynomial coefficients is analyzed.

40|$|The {{influence}} of gear finishing method and gear deviations on gearbox noise is investigated in this mainly experimental study. Eleven different test gear pairs were manufactured using three different finishing methods {{as well as}} different <b>gear</b> <b>tooth</b> modifications and deviations. The surface finish and geometry of the <b>gear</b> <b>tooth</b> <b>flanks</b> were measured. Transmission error, which {{is considered to be}} an important excitation mechanism for gear noise, was predicted and measured. LDP software from Ohio State University was used for the transmission error computations. A specially built test rig was used to measure gearbox noise and vibration for the different test gear pairs. The measurements show that disassembly and reassembly of the gearbox with the same gear pair can change the levels of measured noise and vibration considerably. The rebuild variations are sometimes in the same order of magnitude as the differences between different tested gear pairs, indicating that other factors besides the gears affect gear noise. Most of the experimental results can be understood and explained in terms of measured and predicted transmission error. However, it does not seem possible to find one single parameter, such as measured peak to peak transmission error, that can be related directly to measured noise and vibration. Shaved gears {{do not seem to be}} noisier than ground gears even if their <b>gear</b> <b>tooth</b> deviations are larger. Factors that do seem to reduce gear noise, when compared with profile ground reference gears, are threaded wheel grinding, increased face-width, decreased lead crowning, increased pitch errors and decreased lead twist. Factors that seem to increase noise are a rougher surface finish, increased lead crowning and helix angle error. QC 2010092...|$|R

Through the investigation of three advanced surface coatings the developed model is shown to offer detailed subsurface stress and strain information, quantifying the benefits provided by the application of each coating. A number of rolling contact fatigue tests was also conducted to complement the computational simulations. An adapted twin disc testing machine was used to investigate the progressive wear rates of the three advanced surface coatings when subjected to mixed rolling-sliding contact at high load and in dry conditions.

40|$|The {{concept of}} the average stress has been {{employed}} to propose the maximum average tangential stress (MATS) criterion for predicting the direction of fracture angle. This criterion states that a crack grows when the maximum average tangential stress in the fracture process zone ahead of the crack tip reaches its critical value and the crack growth direction coincides with {{the direction of the}} maximum average tangential stress along a constant radius around the crack tip. The tangential stress is described by the singular and nonsingular (T-stress) terms in the Williams series solution. To demonstrate the validity of the proposed MATS criterion, this criterion is directly applied to experiments reported in the literature for the mixed mode I/II crack growth behavior of Guiting limestone. The predicted directions of fracture angle are consistent with the experimental data. The {{concept of the}} average stress has been also employed to predict the surface crack path under rolling-sliding contact loading.

40|$|Pitting on <b>gear</b> <b>tooth</b> <b>flanks</b> {{is one of}} {{the major}} causes of failure in power transmissions. Cracks {{originate}} at the surface and propagate at a small depth causing the detachment of material debris, which results in craters. Pitting is detrimental as it leads to vibration, noise, loss of efficiency and eventually to the gear un-serviceability. The contact fatigue characterization of gear materials requires a great number of endurance tests on reference gears and is rarely affordable for industries. For this reason, the ISO standard 6336 suggests that tests on rolling pair of disks may be performed in order to compare the pitting durability of either different materials or manufacturing processes. However, the standard does not provide guidance about the geometry of the specimens and the correlation between the results of disc tests and actual gears durability. In this paper a twin-disc test rig is presented, that was conceived to reproduce the contact pressure and the sliding velocity of gears at one particular point along the tooth profile. A criterion for specimens design is also described. The discs were sized to resemble the working conditions experienced by sun gears mounted in the final drive of an axle for medium power Off-Highway vehicles. In particular, the Lower Point of Single Tooth Contact (LPSTC) was considered to design the tests, being the most favourable location for pitting occurrence because of the high contact pressures and unfavourable kinematic conditions...|$|R

In this thesis the variation in surface topography inherent in the manufacturing method has been shown, by experimental work and computer simulations, {{to be an important}} factor for the contact condition in the early life of gears. Surface analysis revealed that the formation and composition of surface boundary layers depends strongly on the chemical composition of the lubricant, but also on pre-existing surface boundary layers.

Therefore, in order to characterize the actual tooth surfaces, an on-machine topography measurement approach is proposed for topological modification helical gears on the five-axis CNC gear form grinding machine that can measure the modified <b>gear</b> <b>tooth</b> deviations on the machine immediately after grinding. Combined with gear form grinding kinematics principles, the mathematical model of topography measurements is established based on the polar coordinate method. The mathematical models include calculating trajectory of the centre of measuring probe, defining gear flanks by grid of points, and solving coordinate values of topology measurement. Finally, a numerical example of on-machine topography measurement is presented. By establishing the topography diagram and the contour map of tooth error, the tooth surface modification amount and the <b>tooth</b> <b>flank</b> errors are separated, respectively. Research results can serve as foundation for topological modification and tooth surface errors closed-loop feedback correction...|$|R
40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. Planetary hub systems offer desired speed and torque {{variation}} with a lighter, compact and coaxial construction {{than the traditional}} gear trains. Frictional losses {{are one of the}} main concerns. Generated friction between the mating <b>teeth</b> <b>flanks</b> of vehicular planetary hubs under varying load-speed conditions {{is one of the main}} sources of power loss. Modification of <b>gear</b> <b>tooth</b> geometry as well as controlling the surface topography are the remedial actions to reduce friction and hence the power loss. The paper studies the effect of tooth crowning and tip relief upon system efficiency. It includes an analytical elastohydrodynamic analysis of elliptical point contact of crowned spur <b>gear</b> <b>teeth,</b> also including the effect of direct contact of asperities on the opposing surfaces. Tooth contact analysis (TCA) is performed to obtain contact footprint shape as well as contact kinematics and load distribution. A parametric study is carried out with the expounded model to observe the effect of gear crowning and tip relief with different levels of gear surface finish upon planetary hubs’ power loss...|$|R
