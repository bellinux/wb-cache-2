No such constitutional protections exist for <b>civil</b> <b>partnerships.</b> Further inequalities in relation to the family, immigration and other types of Irish law exist.

40|$|This {{paper is}} closed access until 16 th April 2018. Since the {{introduction}} of same-sex marriage, {{there have been two}} parallel institutions (marriage and <b>civil</b> <b>partnership)</b> for the legal recognition of same-sex relationships in England, Wales and Scotland. The current study aimed to examine how those in a <b>civil</b> <b>partnership</b> or a same-sex marriage perceive <b>civil</b> <b>partnership</b> in the context of marriage equality. Eighty-two respondents completed a qualitative online survey, and their responses were analysed thematically. The respondents were divided between those who viewed <b>civil</b> <b>partnership</b> as: 1) a stepping stone to equality, and felt that <b>civil</b> <b>partnerships</b> should be discontinued; 2) a form of legal recognition free from cultural baggage, and argued the Government should make <b>civil</b> <b>partnership</b> available for all; or 3) those who displayed ambivalence and conflicting views. We conclude by discussing how the principle of formal equality underpinned opinions on all sides, and what implications this might have for how we understand discrimination...|$|R
5000|$|The {{procedural}} requirements {{to create a}} <b>civil</b> <b>partnership</b> are largely {{the same as a}} marriage, except that the marriage notice is replaced with a [...] "notice of proposed civil partnership" [...] and the marriage schedule is replaced with a [...] "civil partnership schedule". The proposed <b>civil</b> <b>partnership</b> is advertised and a 14-day waiting period for objections from the public applies. Once the 14-day waiting period has elapsed and the district registrar has determined there are no legal impediment to the <b>civil</b> <b>partnership,</b> he or she will issue the <b>civil</b> <b>partnership</b> schedule. The <b>civil</b> ceremony to create the <b>civil</b> <b>partnership</b> may occur at the district registrar's office or any other location within the relevant district agreed between the parties and the district registrar. The ceremony, however, cannot take place in religious premises. The parties, two witnesses over the age of sixteen and the district registrar will sign the <b>civil</b> <b>partnership</b> schedule and it will then be registered by the district registrar.|$|R
50|$|Although the <b>Civil</b> <b>Partnership</b> Act 2004 {{allows the}} {{creation}} of <b>civil</b> <b>partnerships</b> between same sex couples, a married couple that includes a transgender partner cannot simply re-register their new status. They must first have their marriage dissolved, gain legal recognition of the new gender and then register for a <b>civil</b> <b>partnership.</b> This is like any divorce with the associated paperwork and costs. Once the annulment is declared final and the GRC issued, the couple can then make arrangements with the local registrar to have the <b>civil</b> <b>partnership</b> ceremony. The marriage is ended and a completely new arrangement brought into being which does not in all circumstances (such as wills) necessarily follow on seamlessly. This is also true for <b>civil</b> <b>partnerships</b> that includes a transgender partner, which the existing <b>civil</b> <b>partnership</b> must be dissolved and the couple can enter into a marriage afterward. For a couple in a marriage or <b>civil</b> <b>partnership</b> where both partners are transgender, they can have their gender recognition applications considered at the same time, however {{they are required to}} dissolve their existing marriage/civil partnership and then re-register their marriage/civil partnership with their new genders.|$|R
