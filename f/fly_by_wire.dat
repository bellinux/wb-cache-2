25|$|The NH90 has the {{distinction}} of being the first production helicopter to feature entirely <b>fly</b> <b>by</b> <b>wire</b> flight controls. There are two main variants, the Tactical Transport Helicopter (TTH) for army use and the navalised NATO Frigate Helicopter (NFH); each customer typically has various alterations and customisations made to their own NH90 fleets, such as different weapons, sensors and cabin arrangements, to meet their own specific requirements. In early service, the NH90 has suffered several teething issues, which has in turn delayed active deployment of the type by some operators.|$|E
25|$|Qantas Flight 72 (QF72) was a {{scheduled}} flight from Singapore Changi Airport to Perth Airport on 7 October 2008 that made {{an emergency landing}} at Learmonth airport {{near the town of}} Exmouth, Western Australia following an inflight accident featuring a pair of sudden uncommanded pitch-down manoeuvres that severely injured many of the passengers and crew. The injuries included fractures, lacerations and spinal injuries. At Learmonth, the plane was met by the Royal Flying Doctor Service and CareFlight, where 14 people were airlifted to Perth for hospitalisation, with 39 others also attending hospital. Two planes were sent by Qantas to Learmonth to collect the remaining passengers and crew. In all, 1 crew member and 11 passengers suffered serious injuries, while 8 crew and 99 passengers suffered minor injuries. The Australian Transport Safety Bureau investigation found fault with one of the aircraft's three Air Data Inertial Reference Units and a previously unknown software design limitation of the Airbus A330's <b>fly</b> <b>by</b> <b>wire</b> flight control primary computer (FCPC).|$|E

2500|$|The V-280 is {{reported}} to be designed for a cruising speed of [...] (hence the name V-280), a top speed of , a range of , and an effective combat range of [...] Expected maximum takeoff weight is around 30,000 lb. In one major difference from the earlier V-22 Osprey tiltrotor, the engines remain in place while the rotors and drive shafts tilt. A driveshaft runs through the straight wing, allowing both prop rotors to be driven by a single engine in the event of engine loss. The V-280 will have retractable landing gear, a triple-redundant <b>fly</b> <b>by</b> <b>wire</b> control system, and a V-tail configuration. The wings are made of a single section of Carbon fiber reinforced polymer composite, reducing weight and production costs. The V-280 will have a crew of 4 and be capable of transporting up to 14 troops. Dual cargo hooks will give it a lift capacity to carry a [...] M777A2 Howitzer while flying at a speed of [...] The fuselage is visually {{similar to that of the}} UH-60 Black Hawk medium lift helicopter. When landed, the wing is in excess of seven feet from the ground, allowing soldiers to egress easily out of two [...] wide side doors and door gunners to have wide fields of fire. Although the initial design is a utility configuration, Bell is also working on an attack configuration. Whether different variants of the V-280 would fill utility and attack roles or a single airframe could interchange payloads for either mission, Bell is confident the Valor tiltrotor platform can fulfill both duties; the U.S. Marine Corps is interested in having one aircraft to replace utility and attack helicopters, but the Army, which leads the program, is not committed to the idea and wants distinct platforms for each mission. [...] Bell and Lockheed claim an AV-280 variant can launch rockets, missiles, and even small unmanned aerial vehicles forward or aft with no rotor interference, even in forward flight and cruise modes with the rotors forward.|$|E

5000|$|Initially, {{the first}} several episodes of the series did not include any music. In May 2003, Nico Audy-Rowland, the bandleader of Trocadero, was {{introduced}} to Red vs. Blue and enjoyed the series enough to submit a song about it to Burns, who liked the piece and promptly requested more music for Red vs. Blue. Episode 8, [...] "Dont Ph34r The Reaper", {{was the first to}} include music. However, for the release of the season 1 DVD, music was retrofitted into earlier episodes, often during transitions.Trocaderos [...] "Blood Gulch Blues", whose last few measures are now heard during each episodes title sequence, is used as background music for the character introductions on the Red vs. Blue season DVDs. According to Trocaderos website, the songs lyrics are intended to highlight episode 2s joke about the Warthog and the notion that there is as much bickering and fighting within each team as there is conflict between the two sides. In fact, [...] "Blood Gulch Blues" [...] never mentions Red vs. Blue. The song is from the bands debut full-length album Roses Are Red, Violets Are Blue which was released in 2004. The bands style is alternative rock, taking influence from elements of blues, alternative rock, and western types of music. Trocadero continued to provide music for the show from their second and third albums, Ghosts That Linger and <b>Flying</b> <b>by</b> <b>Wire.</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Safety and {{reliability}} are requirements of automobile steer <b>by</b> <b>wire</b> system. Firstly, steering force feedback subsystem of steer <b>by</b> <b>wire</b> is designed. Design of steer <b>by</b> <b>wire</b> system mechanical parts must consider effects of automobile vibration environment. Then, worm of worm drive speed reducer is modeled using ANSYS software and modal analysis is performed. Natural frequencies and vibration mode contour maps of each order are acquired. The {{results show that}} the modal analysis of worm is valid and can predict worm’s vibration performance; both structure and material affect the part’s vibration performances...|$|R
50|$|As {{aircraft}} performance {{increased in}} mid-20th century, {{the amount of}} force required to operate mechanical flight controls became excessive, and hydraulic systems were introduced to reduce pilot effort. The hydraulic actuators are controlled by valves; these in turn are operated directly by input from the aircrew (hydro-mechanical) or by computers obeying control laws (<b>fly</b> <b>by</b> <b>wire).</b>|$|E

50|$|A {{less stable}} {{aircraft}} requires smaller control deflections to initiate maneuvering; consequently drag and control surface imposed stresses {{will be reduced}} and aircraft responsiveness will be enhanced. Since these characteristics will typically make control by the pilot difficult or impossible, an artificial stability will typically be imposed using computers, servos, and sensors as parts of a <b>fly</b> <b>by</b> <b>wire</b> control system.|$|E
