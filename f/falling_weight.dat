5|$|The {{earliest}} medieval European clockmakers were Christian monks. Medieval {{religious institutions}} required clocks because they regulated daily prayer- and work-schedules strictly, using {{various types of}} time-telling and recording devices, such as water clocks, sundials and marked candles, probably in combination.

2500|$|This is {{the case}} where bodies are {{connected}} by an idealized cord that remains in tension and cannot change length. [...] The constraint is that the sum of lengths of all segments of the cord is the total length, and accordingly the time derivative of this sum is zero. A dynamic problem of this type is the pendulum. Another example is a drum turned by the pull of gravity upon a <b>falling</b> <b>weight</b> attached to the rim by the inextensible cord. An equilibrium problem (i.e. not kinematic) of this type is the catenary.|$|E

5000|$|Different {{types of}} {{equatorial}} clock-driven telescopes were built or {{proposed in the}} 17th and 18th century including English astronomer Robert Hooke's 1674 paper proposing their use in precision measurement, a clock-driven aerial telescope objective lens constructed in 1685 by Italian-French astronomer Giovanni Domenico Cassini fitted with setting circles, and one supposedly built by English clockmaker and inventor George Graham early 18th century. What is considered the first practical clock-driven telescope was constructed in 1824, Joseph von Fraunhofer's ‘Great Dorpat’ refractor, a telescope that combined other innovations, such as an achromatic lens and Fraunhofer's [...] "German equatorial mount", making it the prototype of all future large refracting telescopes.

50|$|The {{earliest}} reasonably accurate mechanical clocks are the 13th century tower clocks probably {{developed for}} (and perhaps by) monks in Northern Italy.

As these were used primarily to ring bells for prayer, the clock dial likely only came later. When dials were eventually incorporated into clocks, they were analogous to the dials on sundials, and, like a sundial, the clocks themselves had only one hand.|$|R
