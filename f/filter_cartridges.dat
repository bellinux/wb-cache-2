2500|$|Chemical {{cartridge}} respirators use a cartridge {{to remove}} gases, {{volatile organic compounds}} (VOCs), and other vapors from breathing air by adsorption, absorption, or chemisorption. [...] A typical organic vapor respirator cartridge is a metal or plastic case containing from 25 to 40nbsp&grams of sorption media such as activated charcoal or certain resins. [...] The service life of the cartridge varies based, among other variables, on the carbon weight and molecular weight of the vapor and the cartridge media, the concentration of vapor in the atmosphere, the relative humidity of the atmosphere, and the breathing rate of the respirator wearer. [...] When <b>filter</b> <b>cartridges</b> become saturated or particulate accumulation within them begins to restrict air flow, they must be changed.|$|E

40|$|The {{function}} of <b>cartridge</b> <b>filter</b> is to separate substance or particle from liquid. <b>Cartridge</b> <b>filter</b> is a media to filtrate substance that flow with liquid. <b>Cartridge</b> <b>filter</b> {{in this project}} focus for water filtration system that usually used at houses and small scale industry. Volume flow rate relate with pressure of the water that flow through pipe system. <b>Cartridge</b> <b>filter</b> function as a media that reduced pressure from the water flow and call pressure drop. Sediment sand particles function as particles that flow with the water and will filtrate with <b>cartridge</b> <b>filter.</b> Sediment sand make contact {{on the surface of}} <b>cartridge</b> <b>filter</b> depend on the volume flow rate of water. Cartridge will clogged because of sediment sand clog on the surface of <b>cartridge</b> <b>filter</b> when tried to enter the <b>cartridge</b> <b>filter.</b> This situation make filtration system has different pressure on the entrance and the exit of cartridge housing. Different pressure call pressure drop represent the pressure drop of the cartridge.

50|$|An {{impinger}} {{system is}} a device in which particles are removed by impacting the aerosol particles into a liquid. Modular media type units combine a variety of specific filter modules in one unit. These systems can provide solutions to many air contaminant problems. A typical system incorporates a series of disposable or cleanable pre-filters, a disposable vee-bag or cartridge filter. HEPA or carbon final filter modules can also be added. Various models are available, including free-hanging or ducted installations, vertical or horizontal mounting, and fixed or portable configurations. <b>Filter</b> <b>cartridges</b> are made out {{of a variety of}} synthetic fibers and are capable of collecting sub-micrometre particles without creating an excessive pressure drop in the system. <b>Filter</b> <b>cartridges</b> require periodic cleaning.|$|E

In most areas <b>cartridge</b> <b>filters</b> are less expensive than diatomaceous earth filters but cost more than sand <b>filters.</b> However <b>cartridge</b> <b>filters</b> are more popular because of the minimal maintenance involved. In some cases it may be sufficient to simply hose off the <b>cartridge</b> <b>filter</b> a few times during swimming season to keep them working properly.

50|$|Two {{methods are}} used in spas with respect to {{cartridge}} filters, pressurized canisters,in which the spa filter is not visible when in use, and secondly flow through systems, which are visible when in use and often the spa has 1-5 <b>filter</b> <b>cartridges</b> in this design. Flow through filter system in spas and hot tubs are the preferred method of design today for all major hot tub brands.|$|E
50|$|Beer {{filtration}} is {{also common}} {{on a small}} scale. It {{is not uncommon for}} homebrewers (those who brew their own beer at home, often in small batches around 5 gal) to filter their own beer. While they lack the sophisticated equipment of large-scale breweries, they can achieve satisfactory results using canister filters with successive, replaceable <b>filter</b> <b>cartridges</b> or pads. Most homebrewers will only filter their beer down to 5 µm to remove the majority of yeast and sediment, although some may filter their beer down to 1.0 or 0.5 µm. Anything smaller introduces risk of removing flavor and beneficial compounds.|$|E
50|$|The main {{application}} for air filters are combustion air to engines. The filter papers are transformed into <b>filter</b> <b>cartridges,</b> which then is fitted to a holder. The {{construction of the}} cartridges mostly requires that the paper is stiff enough to be self-supporting. A paper for air filters needs to be very porous and have a weight of 100 - 200 g/m2. Normally particularly long fibrous pulp that is mercerised is used to get these properties. The paper is normally impregnated to improve the resistance to moisture. Some heavy duty qualities are made to be rinsed and thereby {{extend the life of}} the filter.|$|E
50|$|Ceramic {{filtration}} {{does not}} remove chemical contaminants per se. However, some manufacturers (especially of ceramic candle filters) incorporate a high-performance activated carbon core inside the ceramic <b>filter</b> <b>cartridge</b> that reduces organic & metallic contaminants.

50|$|Artificial extracorporeal liver {{support is}} {{measures}} {{used to carry}} out liver function that are outside the body. The Molecular Adsorbent Recirculation System (MARS) {{is an example of}} artificial extracorporeal liver support. MARS banks on the recycling of albumin solution via an anion exchanger and active charcoal. The patient's blood is led through the hollow fibre capillaries of a high-flux dialysis filter. Albumin solution, which is circulated in the extracorporeal circuit, passes the membrane counter directionally, allowing albumin-bound toxins in the blood to cross the membrane and bind to the albumin of the MARS circuit. The membrane is, however, impermeable to albumin. When passing the adsorber and <b>filter</b> <b>cartridges,</b> the toxins are cleared by the filter and albumin is regenerated and able to accept new toxins when passing the membrane again. Additionally, the albumin circuit itself is dialysed in the method of continuous veno-venous haemodialysis (CVVHD) or continuous veno-venous heamodiafiltration (CVVHDF), diminishing the load of water-soluble toxins.|$|E

40|$|Large volume (102 – 103 L) {{seawater}} {{samples are}} routinely processed {{to investigate the}} partitioning of particle reactive radionuclides and Ra between solution and size-fractionated suspended particulate matter.

40|$|A {{large amount}} of radiocesium was {{released}} from the accident at Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant of Tokyo Electric Power Company. The determination of dissolved and particulate radiocesium concentrations in water is important, which can be used as basic information for understanding the long-term radiocesium dynamics in the environment and the transfer of radiocesium to crops. Conventional quantitative methods include the evaporative concentration to the dryness method and the AMP method. These methods need to concentrate about 20 – 200 L of water due to the low concentration of the dissolved radiocesium. After the accident, several new methods, such as the Prussian blue <b>filter</b> <b>cartridge</b> method and the solid-phase disk method, have been developed and put to practical use.
