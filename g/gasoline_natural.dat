50|$|Since 1999, the Korea Global Atmosphere Watch Center {{located at}} Anmyeon-do has been {{monitoring}} major greenhouse gasses (GHG) such as carbon dioxide (CO), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (NO), and chlorofluorocarbons (CFC-11 and CFC-12). The Anmyeon-do station {{is located in}} a relatively pollution-free environment, an ideal site for observing the background atmosphere of Northeast Asia, including the Korean Peninsula. Among these GHG, CO acts most to change many aspects of the climate factors. The CO concentrations at Anmyeon-do are substantially higher than the global average; the average CO concentration for 2011 was recorded as 395.7 ppm, an increase of 25.0 ppm (6.7%) relative to the annual average of 370.7 ppm for 1999, and 5.2 ppm higher than the global average of 390.5 ppm for the same year as documented by NOAA/GMD. The annual growth rate of CO for the 13-year period from 1999 through 2011 was 2.16 ppm/year, which was higher than the global average of 1.9 ppm/year, but it has slowed in recent years.During the industrialization era (second industrial revolution) over the past few decades, people have been burning fossil fuels (coal, oil, <b>gasoline,</b> <b>natural</b> gas), which releases CO into the atmosphere, causing the greenhouse effect. A sharp temperature contrast is shown between the urban and rural areas due to this industrialization. The mean temperatures data variations observed at ten meteorological stations in South Korea show an annual mean temperature increase at a rate of 0.52 °C per decade. During the last 29 years, the increase in the annual mean temperature was 1.5 °C for the Seoul station (found in an urban area) and 0.6 °C for the rural and seashore stations. These rate differences are significantly larger over urbanized areas. South Korea is experiencing a rapid temperature increase,increase Daily maximum and minimum temperatures are very likely to increase in East Asia, resulting in more severe warm extremes, but less severe cold extremes. These mean temperature increases, especially the temperature increase rate after the 1950s is 1.5 times higher than before the 1950s. The duration of winter is also projected to be a one-month shorter than before, therefore having spring and summer will be 20 days longer more during the 1990s compared to what they were during the 1920s seasonal distribution. When average temperature comparison for comparing 20th-century and 21st-century temperature averages, it is shown that there is a 4 °C increase. The mean yearly temperature for South Korea is 10~15 °C, which means that the Korea Peninsula will soon become a subtropical region with an average temperature of over 27 °C. The recent subtropical zone is located on the lower seaside of Korea Peninsula, but as accelerated temperatures increase, it will result in the subtropical zone move migrating northward. Therefore, by 2100 the subtropical zone is projected to expand its region to the north end of Taebaek Mountains.|$|E

40|$|Biofuels {{represent}} an alternative {{source of energy}} that should gradually decrease our dependence on crude oil. A rapid development of their use in combustion engines is above all the consequence of their very positive balance of emissions. The possibility of use of biofuels in conventional combustion engines is given by their physico-chemical properties. Bioethanol is one of biofuels {{that can be used}} in spark-ignition engines. However, because of its lower heating value, it is necessary to change the mixing ratio fuel/air. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the effect of combustion of a mixture of bioethanol with gasoline (in the ratio 85 : 15) on fuel consumption in the spark-ignition engine. Experimental measurements were performed using a six-cylinder spark-ignition Peugeot engine with the overall volume of 2. 946 [*]cm 3, which was equipped with a multi-hole system of indirect injection. Obtained results indicated that the combustion of E 85 biofuel markedly increased the reduction of specific fuel consumption (corrected to atmospheric conditions).
