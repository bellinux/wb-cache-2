25|$|This {{proof is}} similar to the first one, but tries to <b>give</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>to</b> the notion of {{polynomial}} with matrix coefficients that was suggested by the expressions occurring in that proof. This requires considerable care, since it is somewhat unusual to consider polynomials with coefficients in a non-commutative ring, and not all reasoning that is valid for commutative polynomials can be applied in this setting.|$|E
25|$|In 1598 an Italian–English {{dictionary}} by John Florio was published. It was {{the first}} English dictionary to use quotations ("illustrations") to <b>give</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>to</b> the word; surprisingly, in none of these dictionaries so far were there any actual definitions of words. This was to change, to a small extent, in schoolmaster Robert Cawdrey's Table Alphabeticall, published in 1604. Though it contained only 2,449 words, and no word beginning with the letters W, X, or Y, this {{was the first}} monolingual English dictionary.|$|E

40|$|This {{article is}} {{concerned}} with the ontology of political community, specifically the nation-state, as a bounded entity in time and space. Juxtaposed against the reading of it as an autonomous (realism) or permeated (liberalism) unit, or as constituted through Othering (social constructivism), the article conceptualizes the nation-state as a bounded community constituted by a biographical narrative which <b>gives</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>to</b> its collective spatio-temporal situatedness. Taking a phenomenological approach, the article offers a systematic discussion of the parameters of such a narrative. It highlights the relevance of an experienced space, <b>giving</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>to</b> the past, and an envisioned space, <b>giving</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>to</b> the future, delineated through horizons of experience and of possibility, respectively. In this reading, politics is found in the creative and contested attempts to link these dimensions to a coherent narrative on both the domestic and international level...|$|R

For Climacus, the individual comes to {{know who he is}} by an intensely personal and passionate pursuit of what will <b>give</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>to</b> his life. As an existing individual, who must come to terms with everyday life, overcome its obstacles and setbacks, who must live and die, the single individual has a life that no one else will ever live. In dealing with what life brings his way, the individual must encounter them with all his psycho-physical resources.|$|E
25|$|In 2010 Gábor Tokai {{published}} {{a series of}} three short articles in the Hungarian popular science weekly, Élet és Tudomány. Tokai tries to date the codex by finding historical analogies of the imagery of the drawings. Although he brings up numerous valuable observations, his conclusions are somewhat vague. Nevertheless, his research was the first of its kind. Tokai could not rule out the possibility of a hoax, but he (like Locsmándi) insisted that whatever be the case, the text has regularities that strongly suggest a meaning. Several months later Tokai also published two similarly short articles in which he started to <b>give</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>to</b> specific code chunks. He based his arguments mainly on character strings that appear in pictures (such as the INRI inscription on the cross). His statements are sometimes too hypothetical. However, he claimed to have identified the codes of the four evangelists in biblical references, built up of an evangelist's name and a number, possibly some kind of chapter number. Based on Gyürk's and Locsmándi's work he also showed that many of the four digit numbers in the text are year numbers, using presumably a peculiar Anno Mundi epoch.|$|E

500|$|The Tombs of Atuan was a Newbery Honor Book in 1972, {{but did not}} win {{any other}} major awards before being a runner-up for the International Children's Literature Association’s Phoenix Award twenty years after its first {{publication}}. Upon its publication British critic Naomi Lewis called it an [...] "extraordinary book", while scholar Andrew Wolk called the series a masterpiece of fantasy. The prose in the novel received praise; a 1996 reference book on science fiction described them as among the best regarded fantasies, {{and went on to}} call the series a [...] "fast-paced narrative" [...] that explored serious questions of morality, power, and identity, Science fiction writer Jo Walton said that it was a [...] "beautifully written" [...] book. She went on to write that a [...] "lesser writer" [...] would have ended the novel after the earthquake and the collapse of the Tombs, but that the last section of the story, about Ged and Tenar's travel, [...] "do a lot to ground it", making it [...] "solid and well rooted as ever". Speculative fiction scholar Mike Cadden praised the characterization in the novel, calling Tenar the [...] "finest and most complicated multiple character in the Earthsea series, and maybe in all of her fiction". However, scholar Sandra Lindow referred to the conclusion of the novel, and particularly the conclusion of Ged and Tenar's relationship, as unsatisfying. A 2016 review in The Huffington Post praised the religious theme in the novel, saying Le Guin [...] "skillfully illustrates the way religious conviction can permeate and <b>give</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>to</b> a life", while Entertainment Weekly referred to it as [...] "a classic of stealth-missile literature, a fantasy adventure that's actually a feminist horror thriller".|$|E

2500|$|Individuals using {{existing}} family {{bonds for}} meaning-making have a [...] "change in outlook and/or behavior towards family members". With this meaning-making strategy, individuals create meaning of loss through {{their interactions with}} family members, and make more efforts {{to spend more time}} with them. When individuals use family to <b>give</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>to</b> loss, more meaning-making strategies emerge within the family system. A couple of strategies that family members use to help each other cope are discussing the legacy of the deceased, and talking to non-family members about the loss.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{characteristic}} {{is enhanced}} reflexivity, {{both at the}} level of individuals and {{at the level of}} institutions. The latter requires an explanation: in modern institutions there is always a component which studies the institutions themselves for the purpose of enhancing its effectiveness. This enhanced reflexivity was enabled as language became increasingly abstract with the transition from pre-modern to modern societies, becoming institutionalised into universities. It is also in this regard that Giddens talks about [...] "double hermeneutica": every action has two interpretations. One is from the actor himself, the other of the investigator who tries to <b>give</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>to</b> the action he is observing. The actor who performs the action, however, can get to know the interpretation of the investigator, and therefore change his own interpretation, or his further line of action.|$|E

2500|$|Articles 35 and 36 {{contain the}} general rules {{governing}} {{the application of}} fundamental rights. According to article 35, [...] "the fundamental rights shall be realized in the entire legal system". This implies that the Constitution's fundamental rights are binding on all levels of state authorities and are directly enforceable in the courts, although the Constitution prohibits judicial review of federal statutes in article 190. Going beyond the classical notion of civil rights as purely defensive rights against the state, though, article 35 also mandates the authorities to <b>give</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>to</b> the fundamental rights in their legislative and executive acts, and to actively protect fundamental rights even to some degree against non-state actors.
