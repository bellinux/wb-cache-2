5|$|The {{interiors}} were streamlined {{as much as}} possible, without traditional touches such as baseboard moldings. Indirect lighting {{was used}} throughout. Curves were abundant, with rounded fireplaces topped with indirect lighting and a round dining room with floor-to-ceiling windows. Rounded balcony edges were set off by rounded bay windows. The bedrooms included circular dressing rooms with ample closet space. In some of the units, <b>glass</b> <b>brick</b> was used as partition material.|$|E
5|$|James Fenhagen and Byron Taylor {{created the}} {{original}} stage design for Double Dare. The {{design for the}} original series' set {{was inspired by a}} 1980s Italian postmodern design and architecture group known as the Memphis Group. <b>Glass</b> <b>brick</b> walls and yellow and pink, often in a checkerboard pattern, were prominent aspects of the set design. Highlighted by blue and yellow tile-style floors, Geoffrey Darby gave the direction for the set to look like a natatorium (swimming pool), while Robert Mittenthal feels its inspiration is derived from a bathroom. All the original Double Dare music was composed by Edd Kalehoff.|$|E

The site {{includes a}} ceramic period occupation (Pasco and Sand-Tempered Plain) {{and possibly a}} preceramic component. The site's significance is its identification as Pilaklikaha, a town inhabited by Black Seminole Indians during the early 19th century.

500|$|On its release, Manhunter was {{met with}} widely mixed reviews. At first, it was seen as too stylish, owing largely to Mann's 1980s {{trademark}} use of pastel colors, art-deco architecture and <b>glass</b> <b>brick.</b> A common criticism in the initial reviews was that the film overemphasized the music and stylistic visuals. Petersen's skill as a lead actor was also called into question. Particularly critical of the film's stylistic approach was the New York Times, which called attention to Mann's [...] "taste for overkill", branding his stylized approach as [...] "hokey" [...] and little more than [...] "gimmicks". Chicago Tribune writer Dave Kehr remarked that Mann [...] "believes in style {{so much that he}} has very little belief left over for the characters or situations of his film, which suffers accordingly", adding that the film's focus on style serves to [...] "drain any notion of credibility" [...] from its plot.|$|E

500|$|After two {{architectural}} firms {{refused the}} contract to make Plensa's design a reality, the firm Krueck and Sexton Architects accepted. Public art was a departure from Krueck & Sexton's residential and corporate office-dominated portfolio, which includes buildings like the Spertus Institute.

[...] The fountain's black granite reflecting pool measures [...] and has an approximate water depth of [...] [...] It displays videos on two LED screens, each encapsulated in a <b>glass</b> <b>brick</b> tower measuring [...] The firm designed a special stainless steel T-frame both to bear the load of the walls, which are [...] high, and to withstand lateral wind forces. The frame holds all the glass blocks and transfers the load to the base in a zigzag pattern. Rods measuring [...] in diameter anchor to the structure and project into the frame for lateral stability, while triangular corner brackets add support.|$|E
2500|$|Industrial {{development}} in Ivy City {{began in the}} 1930s. The District of Columbia was only the second municipality in the United States (after New York City) to adopt a zoning code. With the Zoning Act of March 1, 1920, Congress authorized the District government to establish zoning and created a District of Columbia Zoning Commission to oversee zoning rules, regulation, implementation, and enforcement. The New York Avenue Corridor and Ivy City were zoned for combined use, which meant residential, retail, and industrial uses were all permitted. Once New York Avenue NE was paved in 1931, numerous filling stations quickly lined the street. Over the next three years, a number of industrial concerns opened in the neighborhood: [...] A Washington Milk Bottle Exchange cleaning facility and glass factory on Fenwick Street south of New York Avenue; the offices of Mitchell & Unsinn, a construction firm, at 2006 Fenwick Street; the offices of R.E.A. Cleaning, an industrial cleaning firm, at 1925 New York Avenue; and the Nehi bottling plant at 1923 New York Avenue. In mid-1934, the F.P. May Co., a hardware retailer, opened a large warehouse at New York Avenue and West Virginia Avenue. By {{the end of the}} year, Greyhound Bus Lines had constructed a bus station at 1900 New York Avenue NE, occupying [...] of the street. The Youngsborough Syndicate, a group of real estate investors, also purchased a large number of parcels along New York Avenue, Fairview Avenue, Gallaudet Street, and Fenwick Street with the intention of creating an industrial park. The Miller Casket Co., a coffin manufacturer, also opened a factory on New York Avenue between Kendall Street and Fenwick Avenue. In 1937, the Hecht Company constructed a warehouse at 1401 New York Avenue NE. Described by The Washington Post as the pinnacle of industrial design, the [...] structure was built in the Streamline Moderne architectural style. The six-story building made extensive use of <b>glass</b> <b>brick</b> along its exterior walls, culminating in a seventh-story <b>glass</b> <b>brick</b> tower which was brilliantly lit at night.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the rear}} of the bathhouse, facing the beach, is the [...] "bathing pavilion" [...] or [...] "beach pavilion", often simply called the [...] "bathhouse". It is two-stories high and {{rectangular}} in shape, made up of two brick side sections and a concrete center section. Although built {{as a part of the}} 1932 bathhouse, the building underwent extensive renovations during the 1936-1937 projects, leading to its current Art Deco characteristics. Unlike the entrance pavilion which is relatively small, the beach pavilion extends the entire east-west length of the building. An arcade or colonnade is located on the ground floor of the center section, largely concrete with columns. The original design of the beach pavilion was similar to that of the entrance building, with numerous Moorish arches forming its arcade. On the second floor on top of the arcade is a concrete projection with rounded edges, enclosed by <b>glass</b> <b>brick</b> windows. [...] These windows are not original to the structure. The projection originally contained a cafeteria or restaurant and its kitchen. It also doubled as a solarium, and is often referred to as such. A terrace surrounds the projection. The center section's roof is flat, used as an additional terrace, while the side sections have hipped roofs. The beach pavilion contains two octagonal towers which rise four-stories high with copper roofs. Several windows are located on the towers. External stairs on either side originally led from the beach to the terrace on the second floor, with additional staircases to the roof of the structure; the outdoor stairs from the ground have since been removed.|$|E
