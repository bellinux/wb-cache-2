5|$|After the Cold War, the {{conflict}} in the Middle East triggered a crisis in 1990, when Iraq under Sadaam Hussein invaded and attempted to annex Kuwait, an ally of the United States. Fearing that the instability would spread to other regions, President George H.W. Bush launched Operation Desert Shield, a defensive force buildup <b>in</b> <b>Saudi</b> <b>Arabia,</b> <b>and</b> Operation Desert Storm, in a staging titled the Gulf War; waged by coalition forces from 34 nations, led by the United States against Iraq ending in the successful expulsion of Iraqi forces from Kuwait, restoring the former monarchy.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. State {{department}} {{considers that}} “discrimination against women {{is a significant}} problem” <b>in</b> <b>Saudi</b> <b>Arabia</b> <b>and</b> that women have few political or social rights. After her 2008 visit, the UN special rapporteur on violence against women noted the lack of women's autonomy {{and the absence of}} a law criminalizing violence against women. The World Economic Forum 2012 Global Gender Gap Report ranked Saudi Arabia 131st out of 135 countries for gender parity, ahead of Syria, Chad, Pakistan and Yemen.|$|E
5|$|No {{political}} parties or national elections are permitted <b>in</b> <b>Saudi</b> <b>Arabia</b> <b>and</b> according to The Economist's 2010 Democracy Index, the Saudi {{government is the}} seventh most authoritarian regime from among the 167 countries rated.

The Saudi press is strictly censored and articles on Saudi dissidents are banned. Saudi censorship is considered among the most restrictive {{in the world and the}} country blocks broad swathes of the Internet. After protests occurred in early 2011, the government banned all public demonstrations and marches.|$|E

5|$|Suspicion quickly fell on al-Qaeda. The United States {{responded by}} {{launching}} the War on Terror and invading Afghanistan to depose the Taliban, which had harbored al-Qaeda. Many countries strengthened their anti-terrorism legislation and expanded {{the powers of}} law enforcement and intelligence agencies to prevent terrorist attacks. Although al-Qaeda's leader, Osama bin Laden, initially denied any involvement, in 2004 he {{claimed responsibility for the}} attacks. Al-Qaeda and bin Laden cited U.S. support of Israel, the presence of U.S. troops <b>in</b> <b>Saudi</b> <b>Arabia,</b> <b>and</b> sanctions against Iraq as motives. After evading capture for almost a decade, Osama bin Laden was located and killed by SEAL Team Six of the U.S. Navy in May 2011.|$|E
5|$|By the mid-1970s, foreign work (such as the Bosporus Bridge in Turkey, {{completed}} 1974) was accelerating while domestic {{orders were}} receding, {{according to the}} company's annual report of 1975. By 1980, foreign work {{accounted for more than}} 50% of Hochtief's business. A major factor was the contract for King Abdulaziz International Airport (completed 1981), the largest airport <b>in</b> <b>Saudi</b> <b>Arabia,</b> <b>and</b> the most valuable contract Hochtief had ever been involved with. The architecture of the airport is highly rated aesthetically, and it has several unusual features, including Terminal Three, used only during the Hajj, reserved for pilgrims travelling to Mecca. It has a tent-shaped fibreglass roof, contains a mosque, can accommodate 80,000 travellers at once, and {{is believed to be the}} largest terminal in the world.|$|E
5|$|In July 1957, {{relations}} between Quwatli's ally Saudi Arabia and {{the governments of}} Iraq and Jordan, rivals of Syria, warmed considerably to the protestations of the leftist current in Syria, which viewed the growing ties between the region's conservative monarchies with distress. After a series of public criticisms of King Saud by an array of Syrian political figures, including al-Azm, Michel Aflaq and Akram al-Hawrani, Saud froze Syrian assets <b>in</b> <b>Saudi</b> <b>Arabia</b> <b>and</b> withdrew his ambassador from Syria in protest. In response to the crisis between the two countries, an alarmed Quwatli ordered Asali to publicly distance his government from the anti-Saudi views of some in the Syrian Parliament and press, and to publicly apologize to Saud. In addition, Quwatli personally issued a government order {{to shut down the}} communist newspaper Al Sarkha.|$|E

Mihdhar arrived in California with fellow hijacker Nawaf al-Hazmi in January 2000, after traveling to Malaysia for the Kuala Lumpur al-Qaeda Summit. At this point, the CIA was aware of Mihdhar, and he was photographed in Malaysia with another al-Qaeda member who was involved in the USS Cole bombing. The CIA did not inform the FBI when it learned that Mihdhar and Hazmi had entered the United States, and Mihdhar was not placed on any watchlists until late August 2001.|$|E
5|$|This {{species is}} locally common in Algeria, scarce in Morocco, and scarce in Pakistan. It has colonised {{southern}} Israel, where it breeds on houses, in the 1970s, and large numbers may occur outside the breeding season <b>in</b> <b>Saudi</b> <b>Arabia</b> <b>and</b> Oman. Population estimates include 10,000to 100,000pairs breeding in Egypt, 10,000pairs in the United Arab Emirates, and an Arabian winter population {{of up to}} 150,000birds in flocks that sometimes contain 300–500birds. A large breeding range expansion in the Arabian Peninsula has been aided {{by the use of}} high-rise buildings as nesting sites, and possibly a greater supply of insects from agricultural land. Breeding is now regular in Abu Dhabi, and Qatar's tall buildings may be the next site for colonisation. The pale crag martin first bred in Iraq in 2009.|$|E
