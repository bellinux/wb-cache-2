40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{assess whether}} {{relative}} or absolute <b>effect</b> <b>measures</b> {{were used in}} subgroup analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and study whether conclusions would change if subgroup effects were calculated on a different scale than reported. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: We studied all 327 RCTs published in 2010 in five major medical journals. For trials with a dichotomous primary outcome, we extracted reported main and subgroup <b>effect</b> <b>measures.</b> If crude subgrouping data were reported, we calculated the subgroup effects on both relative and absolute scales. RESULTS: Of the 229 RCTs with a dichotomous primary outcome, 120 (52 %) performed subgroup analyses. In 106 of these 120 (88 %) RCTs, relative <b>effect</b> <b>measures</b> were used for subgroup analyses, whereas an absolute scale was used in 9 (8 %) trials. Two (2 %) RCTs reported both relative and absolute subgroup effects. Crude data of the subgroups could be extracted in 41 of the 120 (34 %) RCTs. Calculating subgroup effects on a different scale than reported lead {{to a change in}} conclusion in 17 % of the 41 trials. CONCLUSION: Almost all RCTs used relative <b>effect</b> <b>measures</b> for subgroup analyses.

50|$|Funnel plots, {{introduced}} by Light and Pillemer in 1984and discussed in detail by Matthias Egger and colleagues,are useful adjuncts to meta-analyses. A funnel plot is a scatterplot of treatment effect against {{a measure of}} study precision. It is used primarily as a visual aid for detecting bias or systematic heterogeneity. A symmetric inverted funnel shape arises from a ‘well-behaved’ data set, in which publication bias is unlikely. An asymmetric funnel indicates a relationship between treatment effect estimate and study precision. This suggests the possibility of either publication bias or a systematic difference between studies of higher and lower precision (typically ‘small study effects’). Asymmetry can also arise from use of an inappropriate <b>effect</b> <b>measure.</b> Whatever the cause, an asymmetric funnel plot leads to doubts over the appropriateness of a simple meta-analysis and suggests {{that there needs to}} be investigation of possible causes.|$|E
5000|$|Einstein {{showed in}} his thought {{experiments}} that people travelling at different speeds, while agreeing on cause and <b>effect,</b> <b>measure</b> different time separations between events, {{and can even}} observe different chronological orderings between non-causally related events. Though these effects are typically minute in the human experience, the effect becomes much more pronounced for objects moving at speeds approaching the speed of light. Many subatomic particles exist for only a fixed {{fraction of a second}} in a lab relatively at rest, but some that travel close to the speed of light can be measured to travel farther and survive much longer than expected (a muon is one example). According to the special theory of relativity, in the high-speed particle's frame of reference, it exists, on the average, for a standard amount of time known as its mean lifetime, and the distance it travels in that time is zero, because its velocity is zero. Relative to a frame of reference at rest, time seems to [...] "slow down" [...] for the particle. Relative to the high-speed particle, distances seem to shorten. Einstein showed how both temporal and spatial dimensions can be altered (or [...] "warped") by high-speed motion.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to review the methodology and analyze the existing data examining the relationship between leisure-time physical activity and the risk of colon and breast cancer. Methods: Methodological differences (participant characteristics, length of time physical activity was measured, categorizations of quantified physical activity, and assessment instrumentation used to record activity) among studies of activity and cancer risk were reviewed and potential confounding was estimated by calculating the percent difference between multivariate-adjusted <b>effect</b> <b>measures</b> and unadjusted <b>effect</b> <b>measures.</b> A series of meta-analyses were completed. Studies quantifying activity using the Compendium of Physical Activities were included in the primary meta-analyses of colon and breast cancer risk. Subjects from all studies were combined and categorized into low, moderate, and high amounts of weekly activity. Moderate and high groups were compared to the low reference group. Results: Percent differences between adjusted and unadjusted <b>effect</b> <b>measures</b> ranged from 0 - 31 % across all physical activity categories for colon cancer studies and 0 - 21 % for breast cancer studies, with one study reporting a larger difference for each set of analyses (Tang et al., 1999 – 93 %; Patel et al., 2003 – 64 %, respectively). Combined <b>effect</b> <b>measures</b> for high versus low activity ranged from 0. 524 (95 % CI = 0. 348 - 0. 788; p = 0. 002; Males) to 0. 673 (95 % CI = 0. 474 - 0. 956; p = 0. 027; females) for colon cancer risk. For breast cancer risk, <b>effect</b> <b>measures</b> for high versus low activity were 0. 832 (95 % CI = 0. 747 - 0. 926; p = 0. 001) for pre- and postmenopausal females combined, 0. 820 (95 % CI = 0. 584 - 1. 151; p = 0. 251) for premenopausal females, and 0. 868 (95 % CI = 0. 754 - 0. 999) for postmenopausal females. Conclusions: Higher amounts of leisure-time physical activity were associated with a reduced risk of male and female colon cancer and postmenopausal breast cancer. Future studies of the relationship between physical activity and cancer risk should adhere to a standardized questionnaire for assessing types of activity, standard time frame for measuring activity, and quantification of the amount of activity likely to be protective, to develop a better understanding of the effects of leisure-time physical activity on cancer risk throughout the lifespan...|$|R
