In 2011, Cody eventually started all 16 games as the 3-4 type defensive tackle and finished the year with 39 tackles and 1 pass defended.|$|E
5|$|Myths {{continued}} to grow about supposed beliefs in the redemptive powers of Hope, and in the 1970s a rumour began spread that after Israel defeated Egypt in the Six-Day War, the Egyptian government issued copies of it to its troops. There is no evidence this took place, and the story is likely to stem from the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> early 1974, shortly after the Yom Kippur War between Israel and Egypt, the image of Hope appeared on Jordanian postage stamps. Likewise, it is regularly claimed that Nelson Mandela kept a print of Hope in his cell on Robben Island, a claim {{for which there is}} no evidence.|$|E

5|$|Not My Life calls {{attention}} to the <b>fact</b> <b>that,</b> <b>in</b> the United States, the sentencing for human trafficking is less severe than for drug trafficking. The film indicates a relationship between contemporary slavery and globalization. It asserts that most human trafficking victims are children, although the filmmakers have recognized the fact that millions of adults are also trafficked. The film depicts human trafficking {{as a matter of}} good and evil, provides interviews with survivors of human trafficking, and presents analysis from anti-trafficking advocates. Throughout the film, Robert Bilheimer encourages viewers to personally combat human trafficking. Bilheimer was sparing in his use of statistics in the film, feeling that overloading viewers with figures might numb them to the issues.|$|E
5|$|Oxygen {{presents}} two spectrophotometric {{absorption bands}} peaking at the wavelengths 687 and 760nm. Some remote sensing scientists have proposed using {{the measurement of}} the radiance coming from vegetation canopies in those bands to characterize plant health status from a satellite platform. This approach exploits the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> those bands {{it is possible to}} discriminate the vegetation's reflectance from its fluorescence, which is much weaker. The measurement is technically difficult owing to the low signal-to-noise ratio and the physical structure of vegetation; but it has been proposed as a possible method of monitoring the carbon cycle from satellites on a global scale.|$|E

The NTSB was unable to determine whether they stemmed from a common problem – replacements and repairs were documented, but not the pilot discrepancy reports that prompted them or the frequency of such reports. The report criticised Sunjet Aviation for the possibility that this would have made the problem harder to identify, track, and resolve; as well as the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> at least one instance the plane was flown with an unauthorized maintenance deferral for cabin pressure problems.|$|E

5|$|The loss to Virginia brought Virginia Tech to an 83 regular-season record, {{something}} Tech coach Frank Beamer {{said was}} better than he expected at the season's start. Despite that sentiment, most fans and supporters pointed to the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> all of Virginia Tech's losses, the deciding points came late {{in the fourth quarter}} and {{near the end of the}} game. Only three plays separated Tech from an undefeated 110 record. Tech's bowl destination was unclear immediately after the Virginia loss. The Music City Bowl seemed likely, but the Micron PC Bowl, Insight.com Bowl, and Sun Bowl also were possibilities. Virginia Tech officials preferred the Music City Bowl because of its proximity to Virginia, and bowl officials selected the Hokies on November 30.|$|E
5|$|The {{refurbishment}} and recommissioning of the New Orleans Mint was due {{partly to}} the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> 1878 the Federal government in Washington, D.C. {{had passed the}} Bland–Allison Act, which mandated the purchase and coining of a large quantity of silver yearly. The Treasury Department needed additional facilities to do so. It reopened the New Orleans facility primarily to coin large quantities of silver dollars, {{most of which were}} simply stored in the building instead of circulated. President Rutherford B. Hayes appointed former Mississippi Senator and governor Henry S. Foote the new superintendent of the mint.|$|E
5|$|Tunbridge Wells local {{elections}} show a pattern since 1973 of Conservative party dominance, {{apart from a}} two-year period from 1994 to 1996 of no overall control and a two-year period from 1996 to 1998 when the Liberal Democrats held a majority. The most recent elections, held in May 2008, gave the Conservatives a large majority with 44 seats compared with the Liberal Democrats' four. The extent of the Conservatives' dominance is further illustrated by the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> some wards (e.g. Park) Labour did not even field a candidate in the 2008 council elections.|$|E

5|$|Alpha Flights Northstar, {{a member}} of the {{original}} Alpha Flight superhero team, was the first major gay character created by Marvel Comics. Creator John Byrne said that Northstar was planned to be gay from his inception in 1979. The character was finally revealed to be gay in 1992's Alpha Flight issue 106, the only comic book issue to have been inducted into the Gaylactic Hall of Fame. Storylines involving Northstar in Alpha Flight and his limited series have generally ignored his sexuality: Criticism has been levelled at the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> 30 years Northstar has never been shown kissing another man, though he finally kissed his boyfriend Kyle in the first issue of the 2011 relaunch of the series. Northstar eventually became {{a member of}} the X-Men. During his time in this team he became a mentor to gay teenage mutant Anole, who later became a Young X-Men member along with another gay teen, Graymalkin.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, the Caliphate's fiscal basis had shrunk {{dramatically}} {{after so many}} tax-paying provinces had been lost from the central government's control. The caliphal government was now increasingly reliant on the revenue of the Sawad and the other areas of lower Iraq, which were witnessing a rapid decline in agricultural productivity due to the disruption of the civil wars and neglect of the irrigation network. In the reign of Harun al-Rashid (786–809) the Sawad had provided an annual revenue of 102,500,000 dirhams, {{more than double the}} revenue of Egypt and three times that of Syria; by the early 10th century it was providing {{less than a third of}} that figure. The situation was further exacerbated by the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> the remaining provinces, semi-autonomous governors, grandees and members of the dynasty were able to establish virtual latifundia, aided by the system of muqāṭa'a, a form of tax farming in exchange for a fixed tribute, which they often failed to pay. To maximise their revenue from the territory remaining to them, the Abbasids increased the breadth and complexity of the central bureaucracy, dividing the provinces into smaller tax districts as well as increasing the number of the fiscal departments (dīwāns), allowing for close oversight of both revenue collection and the activities of the officials themselves.|$|E
5|$|Gulf Oil {{was most}} synonymous for its {{association}} with auto racing, as it famously sponsored the John Wyer Automotive team in the 1960s and early '70s. The signature light blue and orange color scheme associated with its Ford GT40 and Porsche 917 {{is one of the}} most famous corporate racing colors and has been replicated by other racing teams sponsored by Gulf. Much of its popularity is attributed to the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> the 1971 film Le Mans, Steve McQueen's character, Michael Delaney, drives for the Gulf team. As a result of McQueen's increasing popularity following his death and the increasing popularity of the Heuer Monaco which he wore in the film, TAG Heuer released a limited edition of the watch with the Gulf logo and trademark color scheme. In the same era, Gulf Oil also sponsored Team McLaren during the Bruce McLaren days, which used a papaya orange color scheme with Gulf blue for lettering.|$|E

5|$|In a later review, McNulty praised scenes {{like the}} one in which Sasuke admits his crimes and agrees to go to prison, as it showed {{acceptance}} of responsibility for his misdeeds. McNulty also praised Sasuke's later journey of self-redemption, as well as his decision to respond to Sakura's feelings for him before leaving. IGN's Ramsey Isler considered Sasuke's change of heart drastic, but felt it was a fitting conclusion for the character after the series' events, and fit well with him once again leaving the village, this time on good terms with his friends and the village. Manga author Hiroaki Samura was pleased with Sasuke's character arc in the series, especially his influence on Naruto and the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> the end he returns to Konohagakure because of Naruto. While finding Sasuke's fate in the manga's ending predictable, McNulty felt that the character's monologue after his final fight with Naruto helped to show a deeper side to him.|$|E
5|$|Pretorius did {{not name}} a {{successor}} as Commandant-General; {{his eldest son}} Marthinus Wessel Pretorius was appointed in his stead. The younger Pretorius elevated Kruger {{to the rank of}} commandant. Pretorius the son claimed power over not just the Transvaal but also the Orange River area—he said the British had promised it to his father—but virtually nobody, not even supporters like Kruger, accepted this. Following Sir George Cathcart's replacement of Smith as Governor in Cape Town, the British policy towards the Orange River Sovereignty changed {{to the extent that the}} British were willing to pull out and grant independence to a second Boer republic there. This was in spite of the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> addition to the Boer settlers there were many English-speaking colonists who wanted rule from the Cape to continue. On 23 February 1854 Sir George Russell Clerk signed the Orange River Convention, ending the sovereignty and recognising what the Boers dubbed the Oranje-Vrijstaat ("Orange Free State").|$|E
5|$|The Warsaw Uprising, {{which began}} on August 1, 1944, {{was an attempt}} by the Polish Home Army (Armia Krajowa, AK) to {{liberate}} the capital of Poland from Nazi occupation in advance of approaching Soviet forces. The insurrectionists hoped for Soviet and Allied support, but in early August Joseph Stalin halted the Red Army on the right bank of the Vistula and denied British and American planes, which carried aid to the uprising, landing rights in Soviet controlled territory. Despite the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> September the Soviets captured the Praga suburb and allowed a few limited landings by Allied planes, the insurrection became more and more isolated and pushed into an ever shrinking area within the city. By early September, without Soviet aid, the uprising was doomed. While capitulation talks were already in progress, the Germans took the suburb of Żoliborz on September 30. The final surrender agreement was concluded on October 2, by the commander of the Home Army in Warsaw, Tadeusz Bór-Komorowski, and the German general in charge of suppressing the uprising, Erich von dem Bach.|$|E
