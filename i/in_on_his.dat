5|$|From August 1803, Wellesley's {{army and}} a {{separate}} force {{under the command of}} his subordinate Colonel James Stevenson had been pursuing the Maratha cavalry-based army which threatened to raid south into Hyderabad. After several weeks of pursuit and countermarching, Scindia reinforced the combined Maratha army with his modernized infantry and artillery as the British forces closed <b>in</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> position.|$|E
5|$|At a {{research}} lab in Colson, Washington, intellectually disabled janitor Roland Fuller is scolded by scientist Dr. Keats for forgetting {{how to use}} the facility's keycard locks. Keats walks <b>in</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> colleagues, Frank Nollette and Ronald Surnow, as they argue over a prototype jet engine they are developing. Nollette wants to push testing of the engine to break mach 15, but Surnow is unwilling to risk damaging the prototype.

5|$|Back at the Eppes house, Charlie and Don {{discuss what}} went wrong. Alan is {{confident}} that the math is correct. Don tells Charlie that if Charlie ran his model on Don, the model will not show Don at his apartment. Instead, it would zone <b>in</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> office, where {{he spends most of}} his time. Charlie then realizes that he needs to modify his model to identify two hot zones, one where the suspect possibly resides and one where he possibly works. Using the new equation and a list of potential suspects who work in the new hot zone, Don, Terry, and David confront the suspect and find his latest victim. After Don kills the suspect in a hostage situation, he calls Charlie down to the crime scene to tell Charlie that the suspect lived in the original hot zone but moved three weeks earlier. This revelation proves that Charlie's models are correct.|$|E

5|$|Besides Madison, {{four other}} {{governors}} have died while in office—John Breathitt, James Clark, John L. Helm, and William Goebel. All {{died of natural}} causes except Goebel, who is the only governor of any U.S. state to have been assassinated. Goebel lost the contentious 1899 gubernatorial election to William S. Taylor, but challenged the results. While the General Assembly was considering the challenge, Goebel was shot. Days later, the General Assembly decided in favor of Goebel, ousting Taylor from office and making Goebel governor. Goebel was sworn <b>in</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> sick bed and died two days later. His lieutenant governor, J. C. W. Beckham, succeeded him.|$|E
5|$|His father, Calvin T. Underwood, was a peach {{farmer in}} his home town of Gaffney who {{died at the age}} of 43 of a heart attack. The Underwoods lived in poverty, and nearly lost the farm when Frank was a child; to get a bank loan and avoid foreclosure, his father {{attended}} a meeting of the Ku Klux Klan, of which the bank manager was a member. Underwood speaks fondly of his father in public, but this is a political ploy; in his asides to the audience, Underwood describes his father as a weak man who accomplished nothing with his life. He even urinates on his father's grave in season 3. Despite disliking his father, however, Underwood was influenced by him. Calvin was an abusive alcoholic and caused his wife and son years of misery. Underwood has said that when he was 13, he walked <b>in</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> father putting a shotgun in his mouth. Calvin asked him to pull the trigger, which he refused to do. He has stated that his biggest regret is not killing his father when he had the chance.|$|E
5|$|In 1925, {{runway lights}} were {{installed}} at Penshurst. In 1926, a telephone was again {{made available to}} airmen at Penshurst. On 27 August 1927, Tunbridge Wells Air Pageant was held. The site originally chosen, a field about a mile outside Tunbridge Wells was deemed unsuitable as there were obstacles surrounding it. It was decided to continue the pageant at Penshurst. Five civil de Havilland Moths and three Armstrong Whitworth Siskins from No. 56 Squadron RAF, based at nearby RAF Biggin Hill attended. The pageant was to promote the proposed Tunbridge Wells Flying Club, whose President was to be Sir Robert Gower. It was reported that part of Penshurst Airfield had been rented by the club. Sir Robert entertained Sir Sefton Brancker at Penshurst on 5 December 1927 when Brancker called <b>in</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> way to Lympne Aerodrome where he was to visit the East Kent Flying Club.|$|E

5|$|In 1956, Mikan was the Republican {{candidate}} for the United States Congress in Minnesota's 3rd congressional district. He challenged incumbent Representative Roy Wier in a closely fought race that featured a high voter turnout. Despite the reelection of incumbent Republican President Dwight Eisenhower, the inexperienced Mikan lost by a close margin of 52% to 48%. Wier received 127,356 votes to Mikan's 117,716. Returning to the legal profession, Mikan was frustrated, after hoping for an influx of work. For six months, Mikan did not get any assignments at all, leaving him in financial difficulties that forced him to cash <b>in</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> life insurance.|$|E

The doctor pronounces him healthy, but fat. Peter takes this badly, even smashing a picture of Lois' family. Trying to salvage it, Lois discovers another child in the picture: a boy. She {{telephones}} her father Carter, who tells her she doesn't have a brother and quickly terminates the call, but she persists: she breaks into her parents' house.

5|$|There {{were other}} {{financial}} pressures on Frazee, despite his team's success. Ruth, {{fully aware of}} baseball's popularity and his role in it, wanted to renegotiate his contract, signed before the 1919 season for $10,000 per year through 1921. He demanded that his salary be doubled, or he would sit out the season and cash <b>in</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> popularity through other ventures. Ruth's salary demands were causing other players to ask for more money. Additionally, Frazee still owed Lannin as much as $125,000 from {{the purchase of the}} club.|$|E

5|$|When the General Assembly {{reversed}} {{the election results}} after a dispute, incensed Republicans armed themselves and descended on Frankfort. Taylor's Democratic opponent, William Goebel, was shot and died after being sworn <b>in</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> deathbed.

He fled to neighboring Indiana. Despite eventually being pardoned for any wrongdoing, he seldom returned to Kentucky. Taylor died in Indianapolis, Indiana in 1928.|$|E

Borges indignantly refused, calling it a ridiculous demand. The policemen replied that he would soon face the consequences. The Justicialist Party placed Borges under 24-hour surveillance and sent policemen to sit <b>in</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> lectures; in September they ordered SADE to be permanently closed down. Like much of the Argentine opposition to Perón, SADE had become marginalized due to persecution by the State, and very few active members remained.|$|E
25|$|Bill Lair {{retired from}} the CIA as a GS-16, the civil service {{equivalent}} of a brigadier general. He was 53 years old, with two grown children in college.

Refusing to trade on his old friendships overseas, he instead became a long haul trucker. His past Asian expertise would be called upon only once more, in 1992, when he was again asked about the chances of setting up a paramilitary network in Cambodia. He again deemed it impossible.|$|E
