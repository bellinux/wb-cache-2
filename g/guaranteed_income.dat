He resigned from The Globe and stayed in New York for nearly a year.

Between then and the outbreak of the First World War in 1914 he revisited America frequently.|$|E

25|$|By {{the autumn}} of 1846, the LNWR had offered to lease the Shropshire Union, and the {{directors}} felt that a <b>guaranteed</b> <b>income</b> from a powerful company was probably better than most other options. They agreed to the terms in December, and the LNWR obtained an Act of Parliament in June 1847 to authorise the arrangement. The Shrewsbury and Stafford Railway was opened on 1 June 1849, and lease payments began a month later on 1 July. The arrangement of the lease was not fully completed until 25 March 1857, but the LNWR, struggling with their own success, persuaded the Shropshire Union not to build any more railways, {{in exchange for a}} commitment to servicing the canal debts. The Shropshire Union thus lost its independence after a very short period, but continued to manage the canals under its control, and in this they had a remarkably free hand.|$|E
500|$|During the 1950s, Nevelson {{exhibited}} {{her work}} as often as possible. Yet despite awards and growing popularity with art critics, she continued to struggle financially. To make ends meet she began teaching sculpture classes in adult education programs in the Great Neck public school system. Her own work began to grow to monumental size, moving beyond the human scale sized works she had been creating during the early 1940s. Nevelson also visited Latin America, and discovered influences for her work in Mayan ruins and the steles of Guatemala. In 1954, Nevelson's street in New York's Kips Bay was among those slated for demolition and redevelopment, and her increasing use of scrap materials {{in the years ahead}} drew upon on refuse left on the streets by her evicted neighbors. In 1955 Nevelson joined Colette Roberts' Grand Central Modern Gallery, where she had numerous one-woman shows. There she exhibited some of her most notable mid-century works: Bride of the Black Moon, First Personage, and the exhibit [...] "Moon Garden + One", which showed her first wall piece, Sky Cathedral, in 1958. From 1957 to 1958, she was president of the New York Chapter of Artists' Equity and in 1958 she joined the Martha Jackson Gallery, where she was <b>guaranteed</b> <b>income</b> and became financially secure. That year, she was photographed and featured on the cover of Life. In 1960 she had her first one-woman show in Europe at Galerie Daniel Cordier in Paris. Later that year a collection of her work, grouped together as [...] "Dawn's Wedding Feast", was included in the group show, [...] "Sixteen Americans", at the Museum of Modern Art alongside Robert Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns. In 1962 she made her first museum sale to the Whitney Museum of American Art, who purchased the black wall, Young Shadows. That same year, her work was selected for the 31st Venice Biennale and she became national president of Artists' Equity, serving until 1964.|$|E

2500|$|Writing {{several years}} after leaving Sun News, former senior anchor Theo Caldwell wrote of the station's output that [...] "the {{finished}} product was lousy television, even by Canadian standards." [...] He also complained {{that he was not}} being paid, despite his contract, and finally quit as a result. Caldwell described management's view on mandatory carriage as [...] "hypocritical". [...] "At first, when they imagined the station would be a blockbuster success, they [...] mocked the very idea of mandatory carriage. When it became clear, however, that no amount of Suzuki-bashing and Justin Trudeau prizefights could save the enterprise, they insisted it was unfair not to grant Sun a <b>guaranteed</b> <b>income</b> stream, on the risible basis that CBC and CTV had received similar treatment decades before. It wasn't honest, and it is astounding that Peladeau and Sun management could undertake such a blatant reversal without a trace of irony." ...|$|E
2500|$|Canada's {{universal}} health plan {{does not cover}} certain services. [...] Non-cosmetic dental care is covered for children up to age 14 in some provinces. [...] Outpatient prescription drugs {{are not required to}} be covered, but some provinces have drug cost programs that cover most drug costs for certain populations. [...] In every province, seniors receiving the <b>Guaranteed</b> <b>Income</b> Supplement have significant additional coverage; some provinces expand forms of drug coverage to all seniors, low-income families, those on social assistance, or those with certain medical conditions. Some provinces cover all drug prescriptions over a certain portion of a family's income. [...] Drug prices are also regulated, so brand-name prescription drugs are often significantly cheaper than in the U.S. Optometry is only covered in some provinces and is sometimes only covered for children under a certain age. Visits to non-physician specialists may require an additional fee. Also, some procedures are only covered under certain circumstances. For example, circumcision is not covered, and a fee is usually charged when a parent requests the procedure; however, if an infection or medical necessity arises, the procedure would be covered.|$|E
