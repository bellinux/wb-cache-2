Leaving you country, in spite of its enormous magnitude, you are robbers that broke into our territory, plundering and killing us mercilessly. We have never thought of doing such things to you, but you have invaded our land, astonishing us with this murderous diabolical countenance, making us stubbornly resist, not for us to lose our independence and autonomy, trying to keep our golden will and freedom in our hands. We are not internally at war, and we will <b>defend</b> <b>ourselves</b> from you, the same way wild beasts defend themselves against attackers, and I will say to you strictly, that we are all to lay down with our bones, as its unanimous that we will rather die than surrendering our fotress to you voluntarily. You point Aslanduz to me out, where your „two-thousand large detachment“ supposedly defeated our „thirty-thousand large army“. Shame on you, General, to lie, you should speak the truth, without hiding the real facts of how it ended there, and you shouldn't brag about that particular victory of you over us, which was thanks to the despicable betrayal of our troops. If you forgot about this outrageous event, I shall remind you, fueling anger and hostility towards Abbas Mirza for his strict handling his soldiers wanted to take revenge on him, by raising the white flag amongst 10,500 soldiers, and voluntarily gave themselves up, laid down their weapons and hoped to receive salvation from you; but instead, you disarmed them, without conscience and compassion, and watched how your soldiers killed then thousand of them, leaving alive only 500 people as a trophy of victory. Shame and disgrace. It is a worthy lesson as traitors are oath breakers, {{but at the same time}} a good warning for the rest of the treacherous soldiers, lest they be deceived and deceived by your cunning and false promises. And after these vile barbaric executions committed by you on innocent people who voluntarily handed down themselves to you, you dare to speak of love for man. I feel sorry for your brave soldiers serving as blind tools to achieve your robbers goals: but your boss will only reward you as the commander, with decorations, medals and even large sums of money for the heroic and courageous deed of your brave soldiers, whom it will bypass.|$|E
500|$|Corporal Sam Jenkins and PFC Preston were {{captured}} {{before they reached}} Allied lines, and they later joined Bouck {{and the rest of}} the platoon in prison. The men barely survived, most suffering from the advanced effects of malnutrition. When Task Force Baum from Patton's 4th Armored Division attempted to liberate the camp, Captain Abe Baum was surprised at the large number of prisoners and was unable to rescue them all. Almost all of Baum's unit was captured; Bouck was recaptured and was finally released one week before the war ended. He was too weak to file a combat report, and hospitalized for several months after the war ended. He did not think his men had accomplished that much.

Samutsevich said in December 2012 that [...] "more than anything, what many people didn't see during the trial were those moments when our 'right to defence' was violated. It's not that we were helpless, it was a situation of despair." [...] In an interview with The Guardian, she continued: [...] "The trial was built {{in such a way}} that we couldn't <b>defend</b> <b>ourselves.</b> They didn't listen to us. We could have sat downstairs, where you wait till you're taken to the courtroom, and not go in at all and everything would've gone the same way. The fact that we took part physically [...] didn't actually change anything." ...|$|E

500|$|In April 1918, {{during the}} latter part of World War I, the Viceroy invited Gandhi to a War Conference in Delhi. Gandhi agreed to {{actively}} recruit Indians for the war effort. In contrast to the Zulu War of 1906 and the outbreak of World War I in 1914, when he recruited volunteers for the Ambulance Corps, this time Gandhi attempted to recruit combatants. In a June 1918 leaflet entitled [...] "Appeal for Enlistment", Gandhi wrote [...] "To bring about such a state of things we should have the ability to <b>defend</b> <b>ourselves,</b> that is, the ability to bear arms and to use them...If we want to learn the use of arms with the greatest possible despatch, it is our duty to enlist ourselves in the army." [...] He did, however, stipulate {{in a letter to the}} Viceroy's private secretary that he [...] "personally will not kill or injure anybody, friend or foe." ...|$|E
500|$|My lads, {{you must}} all have {{observed}} the great {{increase in the}} enemy's force, and the threatening posture they have assumed. I {{have reason to believe}} they will attack us this night. I do not wish to conceal our real state, because I do not believe there is a man here who is afraid to face any sort of danger. We {{are in a position to}} <b>defend</b> <b>ourselves</b> against regular troops, far less a set of naked savages, with their spears and krisses. It is true they have swivels in their boats, but they cannot act here. I have not observed that they have any muskets, but if they have, so have we. When we were first thrown on shore we could only muster seventy-five musket ball cartridges [...] we now have sixteen hundred. They cannot send up, I believe, more than five hundred men; but with two hundred such as now stand around me, I do not fear a thousand [...] nor fifteen hundred of them. The pikemen standing firm, we will give them such a volley of musketry as they will be little prepared for; and when they are thrown into confusion, we will sally out, chase them into the water, and ten to one but we secure their vessels. let every man be on the alert, and should these barbarians this night attempt our hill, I trust we shall convince them they are dealing with Britons.|$|E

2500|$|Due {{to their}} capture {{and the general}} chaos of the Battle of the Bulge, the unit's story was not well known. When Lt.

2500|$|Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said: [...] "The Goldstone Report {{is a field}} court-martial, and its {{findings}} were prewritten. This is a prize for terror. The report {{makes it difficult for}} democracies to fight terror." [...] On another occasion, Netanyahu said that the report ignored Israel's 2005 withdrawal from Gaza and the Palestinian rocket attacks that preceded the war. He also warned world leaders that they and their anti-terror forces could be targets for charges similar to those in the report. At the United Nations General Assembly, Netanyahu called the report biased and unjust, asking: [...] "Will you stand with Israel or will you stand with the terrorists? We must {{know the answer to that}} question now. Only if we have the confidence that we can <b>defend</b> <b>ourselves</b> can we take further risks for peace." ...|$|E

At the committee's inaugural meeting, Livni characterized the Palestinian motion as [...] "part of an orchestrated diplomatic and legal struggle that is meant to create legitimacy for a Palestinian state with all that that means, and to deny legitimacy to the State of Israel." [...] She argued that despite the lack of attention it receives, [...] " [...] is a war front as any other." [...] The committee's mandate, according to Livni, is to [...] "deal with lawfare not only to see how we can <b>defend</b> <b>ourselves,</b> but also to try to change international trends against Israel in a legal context and how to deal with moves the Palestinians are trying to make over Israel's head." ...|$|E
