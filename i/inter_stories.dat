40|$|Since {{there is}} no closed-form formula for {{designing}} TMD (Tuned Mass Damper) for nonlinear structures, some researchers have proposed numerical optimization procedures such as a genetic algorithm to obtain the optimal values of TMD parameters for nonlinear structures. These methods are based on determining the optimal values of TMD parameters to minimize the maximum response (e. g. <b>inter</b> <b>story</b> drift) of the controlled structure subjected to a specific earthquake record. Therefore, the performance of TMD that has been designed using a specific record strongly depends {{on the characteristics of}} the earthquake record. By changing the characteristics of the input earthquake record, the efficiency of TMD is changed and in some cases, {{it is possible that the}} response of the controlled structure is increased. To overcome the shortcomings of the previous researches, in this paper, an efficient method for designing optimal TMD on nonlinear structures is proposed, in which the effect of different ground motion records is considered in the design procedure. In the proposed method, the optimal value of the TMD parameters are determined so that the average maximum response (e. g. <b>inter</b> <b>story</b> drift) resulting from different records in the controlled structure is minimized. To illustrate the procedure of the propose method, the method is used to design optimal TMD for a sample structure. The results of numerical simulations show that the average maximum response of controlled structure resulting from different records is reduced significantly. Hence, it can be concluded that the proposed method for designing optimal TMD under different earthquakes is effective...|$|R

Now a day, shear wall in R. C. structure and steel bracings in steel structure are most popular system to resist lateral load due to earthquake, wind, blast etc. The shear wall {{is one of the}} best lateral load resisting systems which is widely used in construction world but use of steel bracing will be the viable solution for enhancing earthquake resistance. In this study R. C. C. building is modeled and analyzed in three Parts I) Model without bracing and shear wall II) Model with different shear wall system III) Model with Different bracing system The computer aided analysis is done by using E-TABS to find out the effective lateral load system during earthquake in high seismic areas. The performance of the building is evaluated in terms of Lateral Displacement, Storey Shear and Storey Drifts, Base shear and Demand Capacity (Performance point). It is found that the X type of steel bracing system significantly contributes to the structural stiffness and reduces the maximum <b>inter</b> <b>story</b> drift, lateral displacement and demand capacity (Performance Point) of R.

40|$|In this paper, {{probabilistic}} seismic performance {{assessment of}} a typical non-seismic RC frame building representative of a large inventory of existing buildings in developing countries is conducted. Nonlinear time-history analyses of the sample building are performed with 20 large-magnitude medium distance ground motions scaled to different levels of intensity represented by peak ground acceleration and 5 % damped elastic spectral acceleration at the first mode period of the building. The hysteretic model used in the analyses accommodates stiffness degradation, ductility-based strength decay, hysteretic energy-based strength decay and pinching due to gap opening and closing. The maximum <b>inter</b> <b>story</b> drift ratios obtained from the time-history analyses are plotted against the ground motion intensities. A method is defined for obtaining the yielding and collapse capacity of the analyzed structure using these curves. The fragility curves for yielding and collapse damage levels are developed by statistically interpreting {{the results of the}} time-history analyses. Hazard-survival curves are generated by changing the horizontal axis of the fragility curves from ground motion intensities to their annual probability of exceedance using the log-log linear ground motion hazard model. The results express at a glance the probabilities of yielding and collapse against various levels of ground motion intensities...|$|R
40|$|Structural {{design of}} space frames {{requires}} appropriate form for a structure {{so that it}} can carry the imposed loads safely and economically. Traditional approaches towards the task of finding such forms for structures have been by the use of experimental models or by intuition and experience. The main objective {{of this paper is to}} develop and use reliable, creative and efficient computational tools for the linearly elastic analysis and optimum design of space frame structures under static loads. The use of SAP 2000 can assist greatly in achieving a safe design. However, commercially available programs are not designed as optimization tools. In this study for optimization of multistory structures, home written MATLAB code interface program is designed to connect SAP 2000 which is known as a commercial nonlinear finite element program and genetic algorithm optimization program. The design algorithm obtains minimum weight frames by selecting suitable sections from specified group list, with consideration actual design constraints like, strength, lateral displacement, <b>inter</b> <b>story</b> drift according to Load and Resistance Factor Design (LRFD). The improved method is tested on different two dimensional multi story moment resisting frames.

40|$|Strength, {{durability}} and stability {{are the main}} criteria for material selection and design in the construction industry. Consequently, development and enhancement of construction materials is always an active and attractive field for engineers and researchers. Elevated temperature (fire) is a potential threat for any structural buildings that can cause a major damage. Response of construction materials exposed to elevated temperature or fire requires a full study and analysis with lessons learned from previous cases. High strength concrete (HSC) {{has been used in}} the lower story columns of high rise buildings owing to its qualities over normal strength concrete (NSC) in many countries. But, the full structural qualities of the HSC were unable to be used because of insufficient information regarding the structural behaviour of the material and its properties. Columns moment- curvature curves were developed and maximum <b>inter</b> <b>story</b> drifts were obtained for the different frame models with variation in columns concrete strength. The study shows that frames with HSC columns have got lower stiffness and performed well in satisfying ductility demand. The maximum inter storey drifts are slightly higher for frames with HSC columns, but the contribution of the concrete strength in resisting the lateral deformations was significant. Economic comparisons were also made and {{it was found that the}} most economical frame corresponds to frame with the highest columns concrete strength...|$|R
40|$|Steel plate shear walls (SPSWs) are {{a lateral}} force {{resisting}} system consisting of thin infill steel plates surrounded by boundary frame members. The infill steel plates {{are allowed to}} buckle in shear and subsequently form diagonal tension field actions during earthquake events. Hysteretic energy dissipation of this system is primarily achieved through yielding of the infill plates. Conceptually, in a SPSW system with ideally rigid columns pinned to ground, the infill plates at different stories will yield simultaneously {{as a result of}} the lateral loads. However, when the columns become flexible, infill plate yielding may initially occur at one story and progressively spread into the other stories with increasing roof displacement. This research investigates the effect of column stiffness on infill plate yielding sequence and distribution along the height of steel plate shear walls subjected to earthquake forces. Analytical models are derived and validated for two-story SPSWs. Based on the derived model, probabilistic simulations are conducted to calculate the probability of achieving infill plate yielding in both stories before occurrence of a premature failure caused by excessive <b>inter</b> <b>story</b> drift at the initially yielded story. A total of three simulation methods including the Monte-Carlo method, the Latin Hypercube sampling method, and the Rosenblueth’s 2 K+ 1 point estimate method were considered to account for the uncertain infill plate thickness and lateral force distributions in the system. The investigation is also extended to multi-story SPSWs. Three example six-story SPSWs are evaluated using the Rosenblueth 2 ̆ 7 s 2 K+ 1 point estimation method which is identified to be most efficient from the simulation on two-story SPSWs. Moreover, the effectiveness of the column minimum moment of inertia required in the current code for achieving infill plate yielding at every story of SPSWs is evaluated...|$|R

However after the occurrence of 2004 Tsunami, and considering possible environmental changers and recently observed small scale ground motions, it is advisable to consider Sri Lanka as low seismic zone. With the current trend of "Mixed Development Concept" high- rise buildings with transfer plates are common form in the vicinity as far as apartment buildings are concerned. The consequences in an event of an earthquake can be serious or even fatal {{for this type of}} highly irregular buildings and adoption of earthquake detailing alone would not adequate. Therefore, approach is needed in order to enhance the earthquake resistance at the conceptual design stage. This study has been carried out in order to identify the effects on the seismic performance of the building when the level of the transfer plate changes. Accordingly, five number of thirty five storied apartment buildings with transfer plate located at different levels were considered in the analysis. It is observed that building codes provide criteria to classify the vertically irregular structures and suggest dynamic analysis to arrive at design lateral forces. In this context, the buildings under this study were subjected to response spectrum analysis according to the design spectrum given in the UBC 97. Computer simulation has become an efficient tool in the analysis of structures under extreme loading. Therefore, three dimensional computer models generated with the help of SAP 2000 were used in this study. The transfer floor was located at the tenth floor level of the thirty five storied building as the first case. The analysis was repeated by changing the level of the transfer plate to below and above the tenth level. Results obtained for buildings with transfer plate located at different levels were compared. From the comparison of Response Spectrum Analysis results of this study it, was found that, when the level of the transfer floor moves towards the ground it enhances the earthquake resistance of such buildings. Further, {{it was found that the}} variation of the base shear, maximum absolute accelerations, maximum absolute displacement and the <b>inter</b> <b>story</b> drift is marginal with respect to the change in level of the transfer plate for this particular building...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{performance}} of composite frame structures with smart partially-restrained (PR) concrete filled tube (CFT) column connections through simplified 2 D and advanced 3 D computational simulations. It also provides a design methodology for new types of innovative connections based on achieving a beam hinging mechanism. These types of connections intend to utilize the recentering properties of super-elastic SMA tension bars, the energy dissipation capacity of low-carbon steel bars, and the robustness of CFT columns. In {{the first part of}} this study, three different PR-CFT connection prototypes were designed based on a hierarchy of strength models for each connection component. Numerical simulations with refined three dimensional (3 D) solid elements were conducted on full scale PR-CFT connection models in order to verify the strength models and evaluate the system performance under static loading. Based on system information obtained from these analyses, simplified connection models were formulated by replacing the individual connection components with spring elements and condensing their contributions. Connection behavior under cyclic loads was extrapolated and then compared with the monotonic behavior. In the second part of this study, the application of these connections to low-rise composite frames was illustrated by designing both 2 D and 3 D, 4 and 6 story buildings for the Los Angeles region. A total of 36 frames were studied. Pushover curves plotted as the normalized shear force versus <b>inter</b> <b>story</b> drift ratio (ISDR) showed significant transition points: elastic range or proportional limit, full yielding of the cross-section, strength hardening, ultimate strength, and strength degradation or stability limit. Based on the transition points in the monotonic pushover curves, three performance levels were defined: Design Point, Yield Point, and Ultimate Point. All frames were stable up to the yield point level. For all fames, after reaching the ultimate point, plastic rotation increased significantly and concentrated on the lower levels. These observations were quantified through the use of elastic strength ratios and inelastic curvature ductility ratios. The composite frames showed superior performance over traditional welded ones in terms of ductility and stability, and validated the premises of this research. Ph. D. Committee Chair: Roberto T.

40|$|Gravity load {{designed}} (GLD) {{reinforced concrete}} (RC) buildings represent a {{common type of}} construction in the Mid-America Region. These buildings have limited lateral resistance and are susceptible to story mechanisms during earthquake loading. Fragility estimates are developed to assess the seismic vulnerability of GLD RC buildings in the Mid-America Region. Fragility {{is defined as the}} conditional probability of reaching or exceeding a performance level for a given earthquake intensity measure. Five sample buildings of various story heights (1, 2, 3, 6, and 10 stories) are used to represent generic RC frame buildings of 1 to 10 stories tall. A Bayesian methodology is used to develop probabilistic demand models to predict the maximum <b>inter</b> <b>story</b> drift given the spectral acceleration at the fundamental period of the building. The unknown parameters of the demand models are estimated using the simulated response data obtained from nonlinear time history analyses of the structural models for a suite of synthetic ground motions, developed for Memphis, Tennessee. Seismic structural capacity values are selected corresponding to the performance levels or damage states as specified in FEMA- 356 and as computed by nonlinear pushover analyses. For the sample buildings, fragility estimates are developed using the predicted drift demands and structural capacity values. Confidence bounds are developed to represent the epistemic uncertainty inherent in the fragility estimates. In addition, bivariate fragility estimates, formulated as a function of spectral acceleration and the fundamental building period, are developed from the fragility estimates of the individual buildings. The bivariate fragilities can be used to quantify the seismic vulnerability of GLD RC frame buildings of 1 to 10 stories. Using the Bayesian approach, a framework is developed to update the analytical fragility estimates using observed damage data or experimental test data. As an illustration of the updating framework, the analytical bivariate fragility estimates for the sample buildings in the Mid-America Region are updated using the damage data obtained from 1994 Northridge, California earthquake. Furthermore, to investigate and demonstrate the increase in seismic performance of the GLD RC frame buildings, the columns of the 2 and 3 story buildings are retrofitted by column strengthening. Fragility estimates developed for the retrofitted buildings show the effectiveness of the retrofit technique by the improved seismic performance of GLD RC frame buildings.

The buildings National Logistics Agency located on Jalan Ahmad Yani, Jayapura Municipality were on fire for approximately three hours on March 15 th, 2012. This incident damaged {{the components of the}} main building, namely: columns, beams, and floors. The components were made of concrete and reinforcing steel with various dimensions and strengths as well as stresses. Due to the increase in temperature, a different degradation of strength and stress on each of the main components was possibly present. As a result, some doubt was cast {{on the use of the}} post-fire building. The objective of this research is to investigate: (1) the temperature distribution toward the structure of the building; (2) the effect of fire temperature on the {{structural condition}} of the building; and (3) the structural performance of the building. The primary and secondary data of research were collected for the observation of temperature distribution pattern toward structure of the building, structural condition of the post-fire building, and structural performance due to the fire. The phases of analysis included: (a) field study, (b) data imputation, (c) data analysis, (d) result of analysis; (e) evaluation; and (f) recommendation. The evaluation of structural performance was done based on the primary data with the existing condition, and the result of structural analysis was then compared with that of the secondary data by using the computer program of ETABS v. 9. 6. 0. The evaluation on the structural performance of the existing was done by two methods of analysis, namely: (a) analysis of inter-story drift and shear stress of the column structure bases; and analysis of bending stress and shear stress of the beams by using Indonesian National Standard 03 - 1726 - 2002. Based on the result of analysis with ETABS, calculation was done on the strength of beam structural section of the second floor and the ring beams of the third floor. The result of research shows that the structural condition of beams of the second floor and the ring beams of the third floor have the remaining concrete stress average of 67 percent. The result of the temperature distribution pattern and the effect of temperature of 3000 C during the fire on the structure of the building of National Logistics Agency, Jayapura Regional Division, Papua Province indicate that the strength of the beam structural section of the structure of the building is not safe for the bending stress and shear stress.

This is the trauma of untold stories of individual church members through conflict, division and split. The author will also in his final analysis evaluate the psychological, pastoral counseling methods applied, care and healing of the clients of Ayeton Baptist church in Pretoria. Those who are deeply affected by emotional hurting actions are members towards other members including the executive and the pastor. C. V. Gerkin’s book on An Introduction to Pastoral Care and A,V Campbell on Rediscovery of Pastoral Care could be of great help on pastoral counselors, {{as well as in}} caring for the flock of God. The design will be as follows: a. Methods used in the study b. Skills c. Essential elements d. Human needs J Jeffrey Means in Trauma and Evil (2000 : 129) says: “We are hurt by other people and we depend on others for healing” quoting Carroll Wise saying: “The crucial fact of life is this: we are hurt by other persons, we are made sick through our relationships with other persons, and we are cured through other persons. The healing process is partly a process that affects relationship” (Means 1998 : 211). Women’s on reflection of forgiveness (2008 : 1) says, “In the cause of human relationships, {{it is virtually impossible to}} avoid hurting others and being hurt by them”. This assumption that forgiveness is beneficial to individual and relationships, even when it is not stated explicitly, it is implicitly in much of the research investigating its correlates, antecedents, determents, and consequences. While others have argued that forgiveness may be beneficial to mental and physical health of individuals (e. g., Mauger et al; 1992; McCullough 2000) All stories told by clients were out of their hearts’ will; voluntarily and also out of their very own languages without prejudice. Such stories as related by members were in most sensitive and heart breaking Some of the clients told their <b>stories</b> <b>inter</b> related to some, whereas some were independent as well as individual Stories told, by clients, are as Means (2000) say that stories are that of individual telling someone to know him or her as he or she is about. Stories revealing dangerous and harmful people to others are found Sad stories on divorce are also told as Ruben Benjamin Kitchen (2008 : 66) says, 4. 4. 7 Dilemmas facing the church. “If the church wants to address the pain of evil in the world effectually, it must address the issues as described interrelation ally, the untouchables with theology of involvement.
