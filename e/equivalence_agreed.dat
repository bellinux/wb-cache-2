25|$|These two {{notions of}} knot <b>equivalence</b> <b>agree</b> exactly about which knots are {{equivalent}}: Two knots that are equivalent under the orientation-preserving homeomorphism definition are also equivalent under the ambient isotopy definition, because any orientation-preserving homeomorphisms of R3 to {{itself is the}} final stage of an ambient isotopy starting from the identity. Conversely, two knots equivalent under the ambient isotopy definition are also equivalent under the orientation-preserving homeomorphism definition, because the t=1 (final) stage of the ambient isotopy must be an orientation-preserving homeomorphism carrying one knot to the other.|$|R
50|$|An {{admissible}} representation π induces a -module {{which is}} {{easier to deal with}} as it is an algebraic object. Two admissible representations are said to be infinitesimally equivalent if their associated -modules are isomorphic. Though for general admissible representations, this notion is different than the usual equivalence, it is an important result that the two notions of <b>equivalence</b> <b>agree</b> for unitary (admissible) representations. Additionally, there is a notion of unitarity of -modules. This reduces the study of the equivalence classes of irreducible unitary representations of G to the study of infinitesimal equivalence classes of admissible representations and the determination of which of these classes are infinitesimally unitary. The problem of parameterizing the infinitesimal equivalence classes of admissible representations was fully solved by Robert Langlands and is called the Langlands classification.|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} {{conjecture}} which unifies several conjectures on motives in characteristic p. Introduction In a {{talk at the}} June 1996 Oberwolfach algebraic K-theory conference, I explained that, in view of Voevodsky's proof of the Milnor conjecture, the Bass conjecture on finite generation of K-groups of regular schemes of finite type over the integers implies the rational Beilinson-Soul'e conjecture on vanishing of algebraic K-theory of low weights in characteristic 6 = 2. This argument is reproduced in the appendix. The next day, Thomas Geisser explained that, in characteristic ? 0, the Tate conjecture on surjectivity of the Q l -adic cycle map for smooth, projective varieties over a finite field, together with the conjecture that rational and numerical <b>equivalences</b> <b>agree</b> for such varieties, also implies the Beilinson-Soul'e conjecture. His work is now available in [10]. The present paper stems from an attempt to {{understand the relationship between}} these two facts. Let l be a prime [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Despite the {{increasing}} need for standardization and <b>agreed</b> <b>equivalences</b> in a globalizing world, the dynamic natures of both {{language and culture}} make standardization difficult. This paper examines this dynamism at the levels of terminology, collocation, genre, culture and intertextuality. It shows that the dependence of language on context for production and interpretation means that a true equivalence can never be found, and that interpreters, translators, writers, teachers and all others who work with language have to deal in pragmatic decisionmaking. 18 page(s...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} evolving software through a sequence of releases without halting execution, a process referred to as Dynamic Software Updating (DSU). It looks at the theoretical foundations, develops an applied theory, and shows how this {{can be used to}} automatically transform programs into upgradable ones that come with guarantees of updatability. In contrast to many previous approaches, our semantics are developed at the language level, allowing for on-line evolution to match source-code evolution. The first part of the thesis takes a foundational approach, developing a core theory of dynamic rebinding. The theory looks afresh at the reduction semantics of the callby-value (CBV) λ-calculus, delaying instantiations so that computations always use the most recently rebound version of a definition. We introduce the redex-time and destructtime strategies that differ in how long they delay instantiations. The computational consistency of these calculi are confirmed by showing that their contextual <b>equivalence</b> relations <b>agree</b> with that of classical CBV.

The Jacobian of , denoted , is a quotient group, thus {{the elements of the}} Jacobian are not points, they are equivalence classes of divisors of degree 0 under the relation of linear <b>equivalence.</b> This <b>agrees</b> with the elliptic curve case, because it can be shown that the Jacobian of an elliptic curve is isomorphic with the group of points on the elliptic curve. The use of hyperelliptic curves in cryptography came about in 1989 from Neal Koblitz. Although introduced only 3 years after ECC, not many cryptosystems implement hyperelliptic curves because the implementation of the arithmetic isn't as efficient as with cryptosystems based on elliptic curves or factoring (RSA). The efficiency of implementing the arithmetic depends on the underlying finite field , in practice it turns out that finite fields of characteristic 2 are a good choice for hardware implementations while software is usually faster in odd characteristic.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of five chapters: Chapter 1 contains {{the basics of}} the theory and {{is essential for the}} rest of the thesis. Chapters 2 - 5 are to a large extent independent of each other and can be read separately. - Chapter 1 : Foundations of tropical intersection theory In this first chapter we set up the foundations of a tropical intersection theory covering many concepts and tools of its counterpart in algebraic geometry such as affine tropical cycles, Cartier divisors, morphisms of tropical cycles, pull-backs of Cartier divisors, push-forwards of cycles and an intersection product of Cartier divisors and cycles. Afterwards, we generalize these concepts to abstract tropical cycles and introduce a concept of rational equivalence. Finally, we set up an intersection product of cycles and prove that every cycle is rationally equivalent to some affine cycle in the special case that our ambient cycle is R^n. We use this result to show that rational and numerical <b>equivalence</b> <b>agree</b> in this case and prove a tropical Bézout's theorem. - Chapter 2 : Tropical cycles with real slopes and numerical equivalence In this chapter we generalize our definitions of tropical cycles to polyhedral complexes with non-rational slopes. We use this new definition to show that if our ambient cycle is a fan then every subcycle is numerically equivalent to some affine cycle. Finally, we restrict ourselves to cycles in R^n that are "generic" in some sense and study the concept of numerical equivalence in more detail. - Chapter 3 : Tropical intersection products on smooth varieties We define an intersection product of tropical cycles on tropical linear spaces L^n_k and on other, related fans. Then, we use this result to obtain an intersection product of cycles on any "smooth" tropical variety. Finally, we use the intersection product to introduce a concept of pull-backs of cycles along morphisms of smooth tropical varieties and prove that this pull-back has all expected properties. - Chapter 4 : Weil and Cartier divisors under tropical modifications First, we introduce "modifications" and "contractions" and study their basic properties. After that, we prove that under some further assumptions a one-to-one correspondence of Weil and Cartier divisors is preserved by modifications. In particular we can prove that on any smooth tropical variety we have a one-to-one correspondence of Weil and Cartier divisors. - Chapter 5 : Chern classes of tropical vector bundles We give definitions of tropical vector bundles and rational sections of tropical vector bundles. We use these rational sections to define the Chern classes of such a tropical vector bundle. Moreover, we prove that these Chern classes have all expected properties. Finally, we classify all tropical vector bundles on an elliptic curve up to isomorphisms. Tropische Schnitttheori...|$|R
40|$|Two DGAs {{are called}} topologically {{equivalent}} if the corresponding Eilenberg-Mac Lane ring spectra are weakly equivalent as ring spectra. Quasi-isomorphic DGAs are topologically equivalent but the converse {{is not necessarily}} true. As a counter-example, Dugger and Shipley showed that there are DGAs that are non-trivially topologically equivalent, i. e. topologically equivalent but not quasi-isomorphic. In this work, we define E_∞ topological equivalences and utilize the obstruction theories developed by Goerss, Hopkins and Miller to construct first examples of non-trivially E_∞ topologically equivalent E_∞ DGAs. Also, we show using these obstruction theories that for co-connective E_∞ DGAs, E_∞ topological <b>equivalences</b> and quasi-isomorphisms <b>agree.</b> For E_∞ F_p-DGAs with trivial first homology, we show that an E_∞ topological equivalence induces an isomorphism in homology that preserves the Dyer-Lashof operations and therefore induces an H_∞ F_p-equivalence...|$|R
40|$|A {{mechanism}} generator code {{to automatically}} generate mechanisms for the oxidation and combustion of large hydrocarbons {{has been successfully}} modified in this work. The modification was through: (1) improvement of the existing rules such as cyclic-ether reactions and aldehyde reactions, (2) inclusion of some additional rules to the code, such as ketone reactions, hydroperoxy cyclic-ether formations and additional reactions of alkenes, (3) inclusion of small oxygenates, produced by the code but {{not included in the}} handwritten C 1 -C 4 sub-mechanism yet, to the handwritten C 1 -C 4 sub-mechanism. In order to evaluate mechanisms generated by the code simulation of observed results in different experimental environments has been carried out. The simulation of auto-ignition of n-pentane in a rapid-compression machine shows good agreement with experimental results. Experimentally derived and numerically predicted ignition delays of n-heptane/air and n-decane/air mixtures in high-pressure shock tubes {{in a wide range of}} temperatures, pressures and <b>equivalence</b> ratios <b>agree</b> very well. Concentration profiles of the main products and intermediates of n-heptane, iso-octane and n-decane oxidation in jet-stirred reactors at a wide range of temperatures and equivalence ratios are generally well reproduced. Sensitivity and reaction flow analyses were performed for shock tube and jet-stirred reactor environments, respectively, in an attempt to identify the most important reactions under the relevant conditions of study.

40|$|We develop {{category}} theory within Univalent Foundations, {{which is}} a foundational system for mathematics based on a homotopical interpretation of dependent type theory. In this system, we propose a definition of "category" for which equality and <b>equivalence</b> of categories <b>agree.</b> Such categories satisfy {{a version of the}} Univalence Axiom, saying that the type of isomorphisms between any two objects is equivalent to the identity type between these objects; we call them "saturated" or "univalent" categories. Moreover, we show that any category is weakly equivalent to a univalent one in a universal way.

40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} I propose a {{quantization}} {{of general relativity}} of Einstein which leads to photon mediates gravitation. My quantization of GR depends on the modified special relativity MSRT which introduces a new interpretation to the Lorentz transformation equations depending on quantum theory (Copenhagen school) [25, 26, 27, 43]. My new interpretation to the Lorentz transformation leads to the Lorentz transformation is vacuum energy dependent instead of the relative velocity in Einstein’s interpretation to the Lorentz transformation equations in the SRT. Furthermore the Lorentz factor {{is equivalent to the}} refractive index in optics. In my interpretation to the Lorentz transformation I refuse the reciprocity principle which was adopted by Einstein in the SRT. Refusing the reciprocity principle in my theory leads to disappearing all the paradoxes in the SRT; the Twin paradox, Ehrenfest paradox, Ladder paradox and Bell's spaceship paradox. Furthermore, according to my interpretation I could reconcile and interpret the experimental results of quantum tunneling and entanglement (spooky action), —Casimir effect, Hartman effect — with the SRT in this paper. My new interpretation leads also to the wave-particle duality as in quantum theory, and thus agrees with Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The generalization of my transformation leads also the concept of acceleration or deceleration is vacuum fluctuations as in quantum field theory. In my proposed quantized force, the force is given as a function of frequency [1]. Where, in this paper I defined the relativistic momentum as a function of frequency equivalent to the relativistic kinetic energy held by a body and time, and then the quantized force is given as the first derivative of the momentum with respect to time. Subsequently I introduce Newton’s second law as it is relativistic quantized force, and then I introduce the relativistic quantized inertial force, and then by my <b>equivalence</b> principle which <b>agreed</b> completely with the experimental results of QFT, I introduce the relativistic quantized gravitational force, and the quantized gravitational time dilation...|$|R
