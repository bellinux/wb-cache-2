5|$|Chaplin's {{loneliness}} {{was relieved}} when he met 21-year-old actress Paulette Goddard in July 1932, and the pair began a successful relationship. He {{was not ready to}} commit to a film, however, and focused on writing a serial about his travels (published in Woman's Home Companion). The trip had been a stimulating experience for Chaplin, including meetings with several prominent thinkers, and he became increasingly interested in world affairs. The state of labour in America troubled him, and he feared that capitalism and machinery in the workplace would increase unemployment levels. It was these concerns that stimulated Chaplin to develop <b>his</b> <b>new</b> <b>film.</b>|$|E

5|$|Clay {{attempts}} to romance Rain Turner, a gorgeous young woman auditioning {{for a role}} in <b>his</b> <b>new</b> <b>film,</b> leading her on {{with the promise of}} being cast, all the while knowing she is too old for the part. His narration reveals he has done this with a number {{of men and women in}} the past, and yet often comes out of the relationship hurt and damaged himself. Over the course of their relationship, he is stalked by unknown persons driving a Jeep and is frequently reminded by various individuals of the grisly murder of a young producer whom he knew. Clay disinterestedly watches a snuff film of the murder—later attributed to Rip—on his iPhone.|$|E
5|$|The {{action of}} Imperial Bedrooms depicts Clay, who, {{after four years}} in New York, returns to Los Angeles {{to assist in the}} casting of <b>his</b> <b>new</b> <b>film.</b> There, he meets up with his old friends who were {{characters}} in Less Than Zero. Like Clay, they have all become involved in the film industry: his philandering friend Trent Burroughswho has married Blairis a manager, while Clay's former classmate at Camden, Daniel Carter, has become a famous producer. Julian Wells, who was a male prostitute in Less Than Zero, has become an ultra-discreet high-class pimp representing struggling young actors who do not wish to tarnish future careers. Rip Millar, Clay's former drug dealer, now controls his own cartel and has become disfigured through repeated plastic surgeries.|$|E
25|$|Kiarostami's {{first film}} of the decade was Close-Up (1990), which narrates {{the story of the}} real-life trial of a man who {{impersonated}} film-maker Mohsen Makhmalbaf, conning a family into believing they would star in <b>his</b> <b>new</b> <b>film.</b> The family suspects theft as the motive for this charade, but the impersonator, Hossein Sabzian, argues that his motives were more complex. The part-documentary, part-staged film examines Sabzian's moral justification for usurping Makhmalbaf's identity, questioning his ability to sense his cultural and artistic flair. Ranked #42 in British Film Institute's The Top 50 Greatest Films of All Time, Close-Up received praise from directors such as Quentin Tarantino, Martin Scorsese, Werner Herzog, Jean-Luc Godard, and Nanni Moretti and was released across Europe.|$|E

500|$|In June 2003, Pearl Jam {{announced}} it was officially leaving Epic Records {{following the end of}} its contract with the label. The band stated it had [...] "no interest" [...] in signing with another label. The band's first release without a label was the single for [...] "Man of the Hour", in partnership with Amazon.com. Director Tim Burton approached Pearl Jam to request an original song for the soundtrack of <b>his</b> <b>new</b> <b>film,</b> Big Fish. After screening an early print of the film, Pearl Jam recorded the song for him.

500|$|In 2005, Deodato {{announced}} {{that he planned to}} make a companion piece to Cannibal Holocaust entitled Cannibals. Deodato was originally hesitant about directing <b>his</b> <b>new</b> <b>film,</b> as he thought that he would make it too violent for American audiences. However, while he was in Prague filming his cameo appearance in [...] for Eli Roth, Deodato viewed Hostel and decided that he would direct after all, citing it as a similarly violent film that was given a mainstream release in America. Although the screenplay, written by Christine Conradt, was completed, a financial conflict between Deodato and the film's producer led to the project's cancellation. In 2013, Roth directed The Green Inferno, which takes its title from the fictional documentary produced in Cannibal Holocaust. Roth's film was intended as an homage to Cannibal Holocaust and other cannibal films from the same era.|$|E

500|$|The {{action of}} the novel takes place twenty-five years after Less Than Zero. Its story follows Clay, a New York-based screenwriter, after he returns to Los Angeles to cast <b>his</b> <b>new</b> <b>film.</b> There he becomes embroiled in the {{sinister}} world of his former friends and confronts the darker aspects of his own personality. The novel opens with a literary device which suggests {{the possibility that the}} narrator of Imperial Bedrooms may not be the same as the narrator of Less Than Zero although both are ostensibly narrated by Clay. In doing this, Ellis is able to comment on the earlier novel's style and on the development of its moralistic film adaptation. In the novel Ellis explores Clay's pathological narcissism, [...] and sadistic tendencies, and exploitative personality, which had been less explicit in Less Than Zero. Ellis chose to do this in part to dispel the sentimental reputation Less Than Zero has accrued over the years, that of [...] "an artifact of the 1980s". Imperial Bedrooms retains Ellis' characteristic transgressive style and applies it to the 2000s (decade) and 2010s, covering amongst other things, the impact of new communication technologies on daily lives.|$|E
500|$|Coppola {{comes from}} a family of film-makers and actors, and she has said how {{childhood}} memories of living in hotels partially inspired her choice of setting. Somewhere presents a detailed portrait of life in that industry and charts its existential and emotional boundaries. While celebrity gossip websites inform us of the shallowness of much of [...] "star life", Coppola's feature differs in its emotional depth. She wanted to depict Marco working, but not on a film set. Instead he is shown giving interviews, being photographed, attending an awards ceremony in Italy, and having special effects make-up applied. When Marco attends the special-effects department his face is covered in latex, the camera then very slowly, hypnotically zooms in. Marco is obliged to use his [...] "star" [...] recognition to help promote <b>his</b> <b>new</b> <b>film,</b> when his publicist calls he becomes passive and mechanically takes the arranged chauffeured car and speaks to the press. In part, the humor derives from Marco's subdued response to these attentions, and Coppola's off-beat observation of people around him. At the Venice film festival, critics highlighted the repetition of characters in a cloistered existence in Coppola's films, to which she responded [...] "I feel like everyone should tell what they know in the world that they know".|$|E
500|$|On the [...] "EC" [...] set {{the next}} morning a {{reluctant}} Wendy joins a gray side-burned Cartman who promises he will stick to school-related questions and go easy on her. However, as soon as filming begins, he immediately asks about her rumoured promiscuity and involvement in the Smurf genocide. To Cartman's surprise, Wendy claims she indeed bulldozed Smurfland to get the valuable Smurfberries, but alludes that Cartman was involved with the plot, and that the Smurfs would have left Smurfland if Cartman had not integrated himself with them. She steps down as student body president, turning the title over to Cartman, and announces her own new book [...] on the Smurfs. Cartman is angry that she has turned the tables on him and stolen his Smurf idea, particularly when she announces she sold the movie rights to director James Cameron, who turned the book into <b>his</b> <b>new</b> <b>film,</b> Avatar. With being the student body president, Cartman can't do the morning announcements anymore because a student can't hold both positions at the same time. Cartman, much to his anger, also learns that being the student body president is a meaningless position with no real power. The episode ends with Casey Miller reading the announcements, which include a student's explicit letter of disgust for Cartman's performance as president, causing him to run out the room crying, [...] "I'm doing the best I can!" ...|$|E

Next Perret adapted Alphonse Daudet's novel Sapho in 1933. As he had already acted in a stage adaptation of the novel when he was doing theatre, he knew the subject well. In 1934, while working with the Comédie-Française, Perret tried an experimental type of play-documentary from Molière's body of work. Although the experiment was met with limited success, it proved to be an inspiration for other artists such as Sacha Guitry who later created similar types of experimental films.|$|E
