However, a meta-analysis of all available studies suggests that the prevalence of positive estimates is caused by publication bias and that the underlying effect may be negligible. Furthermore, studies accounting for time trend reflecting general cohesion policies in Europe that started before, and continue after implementing the common currency find no <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> <b>trade.</b> These results suggest that other policies aimed at European integration might be the source of observed increase in trade.|$|E

We thoroughly disentangle the ex post effects of these EIAs: 1) we allow for differential timing of effects of EIAs, 2) we look at the <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> total <b>trade</b> flows {{as well as on the}} margins, 3) we allow for heterogeneity across EIAs and 4) we estimate the <b>effects</b> of EIAs <b>on</b> <b>trade</b> flows for each EU country individually. We use a panel on aggregate imports and exports for the period of 1988 - 2013 and control for endogeneity of EIAs and multilateral resistance. We find that EIAs have complex and heterogeneous <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> <b>trade</b> flows between the EU and the rest of the world. EIAs have differential <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> <b>trade,</b> depending <b>on</b> the characteristics of the EIAs and the EU member state.

50|$|In May 1842 the Northern and Eastern Railway {{opened a}} line to Bishop's Stortford, which {{followed}} {{the valley of the}} Stort, and had stations almost {{on the banks of the}} navigation. The <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> <b>trade</b> was dramatic, with income dropping from £5,477 to £2,593 in the ten years between 1838 and 1848. The decline then stopped, and the Lee Navigation gave serious thought to purchasing their neighbour. Acts of Parliament obtained by them in 1868 and 1874 included powers to authorise the acquisition, but surveys were made, and the amount of repairs and dredging that would be required persuaded them to only offer a small sum, which was rejected. Gurney and Co sold it in 1873 to a firm of brewers from Spitalfields called Truman, Hanbury and Co. Sir Walter Gilbey took it over next, and formed the Stort Navigation Company Ltd in 1905, a company in which most of the directors were members of his own family.|$|E
