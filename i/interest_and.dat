40|$|As one {{component}} of a broader social and normative response {{to the problem of}} suicide, scientism served to minimize sociopolitical and religious conflict around the issue. As such, it embodied, and continues to embody, a number of <b>interests</b> <b>and</b> values, as well as serving important social functions. It is thus comparable with other normative frameworks and can be appraised, from an ethical perspective, in light of these values, <b>interests,</b> <b>and</b> functions. This work examines the key values, <b>interests,</b> <b>and</b> functions of scientism in suicidology and argues that although scientism has had some social benefit, it primarily serves to maintain political <b>and</b> professional <b>interests</b> <b>and</b> has damaging implications for suicide research and prevention...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Previous {{studies have}} {{identified}} brain areas related to cognitive abilities and personality, respectively. In this exploratory study, we extend {{the application of}} modern neuroimaging techniques to another area of individual differences, vocational <b>interests,</b> <b>and</b> relate the results to an earlier study of cognitive abilities salient for vocations. Findings First, we examined the psychometric relationships between vocational <b>interests</b> <b>and</b> abilities in a large sample. The primary relationships between those domains were between Investigative (scientific) <b>interests</b> <b>and</b> general intelligence and between Realistic (“blue-collar”) <b>interests</b> <b>and</b> spatial ability. Then, using MRI and voxel-based morphometry, we investigated the relationships between regional gray matter volume <b>and</b> vocational <b>interests.</b> Specific clusters of gray matter {{were found to be}} correlated with Investigative <b>and</b> Realistic <b>interests.</b> Overlap analyses indicated some common brain areas between the correlates of Investigative <b>interests</b> <b>and</b> general intelligence and between the correlates of Realistic <b>interests</b> <b>and</b> spatial ability. Conclusions Two of six vocational-interest scales show substantial relationships with regional gray matter volume. The overlap between the brain correlates of these scales and cognitive-ability factors suggest there are relationships between individual differences in brain structure and vocations. </p...|$|R
40|$|Life goals, values, {{vocational}} <b>interests,</b> <b>and</b> {{personality traits}} are important {{factors that influence}} career and everyday life decision-making. This dissertation presents a framework for how personality traits, <b>interests,</b> <b>and</b> values relate to life goals. There were two studies conducted using structural equation modeling. Study 1 was a cross-sectional study investigating the domain-specific relationship among major life goals, personality traits, <b>interests,</b> <b>and</b> values. The results showed that personality traits are the most fundamental disposition and can predict vocational <b>interests,</b> values, <b>and</b> then goals. Moreover, in certain domains, interests serve as a mediator between personality traits and life goals; values serve as a mediator between personality traits and goals, <b>and</b> between <b>interests</b> <b>and</b> goals. Study 2 is a longitudinal study examining how relationships among major life goals, <b>interests,</b> <b>and</b> personality traits may change over time. The results indicated that personality, <b>interests,</b> <b>and</b> major life goals are stable across time. Both personality <b>and</b> <b>interests</b> are enduring psychological dispositions that can predict future major life goals. The models also show that some variables are more capable of explaining and predicting major life goals when other variables were controlled. Combining these two studies, this dissertation contributes to the deeper understanding of how important psychological dispositions influence individuals’ goal settings during emerging adulthood. Both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies together provide a broader picture of the trajectory of these dispositions’ development...|$|R
