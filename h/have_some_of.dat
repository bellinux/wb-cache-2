5|$|Physical and {{chemical}} characterisations of heavy metals {{need to be}} treated with caution, as the metals involved are not always consistently defined. As well as being relatively dense, heavy metals tend to be less reactive than lighter metals and have much less soluble sulfides and hydroxides. While it is relatively easy to distinguish a heavy metal such as tungsten from a lighter metal such as sodium, a few heavy metals, such as zinc, mercury, and lead, <b>have</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the characteristics of lighter metals, and, lighter metals such as beryllium, scandium, and titanium, <b>have</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the characteristics of heavier metals.|$|E
5|$|These {{properties}} make it {{relatively easy}} to distinguish a light metal like sodium from a heavy metal like tungsten, but the differences become less clear at the boundaries. Light structural metals like beryllium, scandium, and titanium <b>have</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the characteristics of heavy metals, such as higher melting points; post-transition heavy metals like zinc, cadmium, and lead <b>have</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the characteristics of light metals, such as being relatively soft, having lower melting points, and forming mainly colourless complexes.|$|E

5|$|The {{environmental}} impact of wind power {{when compared to the}} {{environmental impact}}s of fossil fuels, is relatively minor. According to the IPCC, in assessments of the life-cycle global warming potential of energy sources, wind turbines have a median value of between 12 and 11 (geq/kWh) depending on whether off- or onshore turbines are being assessed. Compared with other low carbon power sources, wind turbines <b>have</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the lowest global warming potential per unit of electrical energy generated.|$|E
5|$|Coffeehouses (called al-maqhah in Arabic) {{serve hot}} {{beverages}} and {{soft drinks and}} are usually restricted to male customers—who take part in leisurely activities like playing cards or backgammon and smoking argileh (Arabic for hookah). Sweet shops or mahal al hilaweyat, {{can be found in}} the souks of cities and major towns, they offer a wide range of sweets common with Palestinians, such as, kanafeh, baklawa and anise-flavored cookies. Family-run shops often serve at least one type of sweet that they themselves created. The city of Nablus in particular are world famous for their exquisite Arabic sweets, and <b>have</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the oldest sweet shops in Palestine.|$|E
5|$|In 2379, {{two hundred}} years after the events of Alien 3, {{military}} scientists on the space vessel USM Auriga create a clone of Ellen Ripley, designated Ripley 8, using DNA from blood samples taken before her death. The xenomorph queen's DNA has been mixed in with Ripley's, and the clone grows up with an embryo inside it. The scientists extract the embryo, raise it and collect its eggs while keeping Ripley 8 alive for further study. As {{a result of the}} xenomorphs' DNA inside her, she has enhanced strength and reflexes, blood that is somewhat acidic and a psychic link with the xenomorphs. Additionally, the xenomorph's genetic memory allows the clone to <b>have</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> Ripley's memories.|$|E

5|$|In October 2006, the NSW Department of Local Government {{announced}} it would investigate the Council's financial management and would try {{to determine whether it}} properly considered the impact the added costs could have on its other functions. The investigation, which commenced on 6 November 2006, was conducted under Section 430 of the , which allows the Director-General of the Department to investigate any aspect of a Council or of its work or activities. The report, delivered in May 2007 to the Minister of Local Government, concluded that the Council did not exercise due diligence and {{that there had been a}} failure to scope the project, and recommended to the Minister that a Section 740 public inquiry, which would be independent and <b>have</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the powers and protections of a Royal Commission, be held. A Section 740 inquiry is a necessary step before a Council can be dismissed.|$|E
5|$|Lipid bilayers {{are large}} enough {{structures}} to <b>have</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the mechanical properties of liquids or solids. The area compression modulus Ka, bending modulus Kb, and edge energy , {{can be used}} to describe them. Solid lipid bilayers also have a shear modulus, but like any liquid, the shear modulus is zero for fluid bilayers. These mechanical properties affect how the membrane functions. Ka and Kb affect the ability of proteins and small molecules to insert into the bilayer, and bilayer mechanical properties have been shown to alter the function of mechanically activated ion channels. Bilayer mechanical properties also govern what types of stress a cell can withstand without tearing. Although lipid bilayers can easily bend, most cannot stretch more than a few percent before rupturing.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{characters}} from other games were meant to <b>have</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> their moves changed or removed in order to balance them with KOF's new characters. However, designers focused in adjusting the imbalance of certain characters without removing any move. In the end, creators of the series noted that the Art of Fighting characters were the strongest ones in the game. Nevertheless, other characters such as Terry and Andy Bogard became the ones who got the designers' utmost attention and were given new moves.|$|E

5|$|Plant {{species that}} are genetically {{compatible}} may not hybridize in nature for various reasons, including geographical isolation, differences in flowering period, or differences in pollinators. Species that are brought together by humans in gardens may hybridize naturally, or hybridization can be facilitated by human efforts, such as altered flowering period or artificial pollination. Hybrids are sometimes created by humans to produce improved plants that <b>have</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the characteristics {{of each of the}} parent species. Much work is now being done with hybrids between crops and their wild relatives to improve disease-resistance or climate resilience for both agricultural and horticultural crops.|$|E
5|$|Scotland {{enjoys a}} {{diversity}} of temperate ecologies, incorporating both deciduous and coniferous woodlands, and moorland, montane, estuarine, freshwater, oceanic, and tundra landscapes. Approximately 14% of Scotland is wooded, much of it forestry plantations, but prior to human clearing {{there would have been}} much larger areas of boreal Caledonian and broad-leaved forest. Although much reduced, significant remnants of the native Scots Pine woodlands can be found in places. 17% of Scotland is covered by heather moorland and peatland. Caithness and Sutherland <b>have</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the largest and most intact areas of blanket bog in the world, supporting a distinctive wildlife community. 75% of Scotland's land is classed as agricultural (including some moorland) with urban areas accounting for around 3% of the total. The number of islands with terrestrial vegetation is nearly 800, about 600 of them lying off the west coast. Scotland has more than 90% of the volume and 70% of the total surface area of fresh water in the United Kingdom. There are more than 30,000 freshwater lochs and 6,600 river systems.|$|E
5|$|Shoshone National Forest has {{virtually}} all the original animal and plant species that were there when white explorers such as John Colter and Jim Bridger first visited the region. The forest {{is home to the}} Grizzly bear, cougar, moose, tens of thousands of elk as well as the largest herd of bighorn sheep in the U.S. The streams in the forest are considered to <b>have</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the best game species fishing opportunities in the U.S. including Yellowstone cutthroat trout. More than 1,300 miles of hiking trails, 32 campgrounds and adjacent forests and parklands provide numerous recreational opportunities. There are four wilderness areas within the forest, protecting {{more than half of the}} managed land area from development. From sagebrush plains through dense spruce and fir forest to craggy mountain peaks, Shoshone National Forest has a rich biodiversity rarely matched in any protected area.|$|E

5|$|The Departmental Water and Sanitation Plans program {{provides}} such services as planning and harmonizing resources and has regional systems of service provision {{at the level}} of each department of the country. The program was first implemented in four departments which <b>have</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the most difficult conditions: Sucre, Córdoba, Magdalena and La Guajira. The program also aimed to overcome the sector’s fragmentation into many small utilities to benefit from economies of scale. In 2010 30 Departmental Plans were completed and published, covering almost all of the country's 32 departments.|$|E
5|$|The {{conversion}} to meat was unfavorable for the Auxois, however. The Percheron was preferred {{for the quality}} of the meat and the Ardennais and closely related Auxois were considered to <b>have</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the lowest quality meat. In addition, the promised market for horse meat did not materialize, and French slaughterhouses were overwhelmed by imports of cheap horses from the Americas and Eastern Europe. Because of this lack of profitability, the population of most French breeds, including the Auxois, continued to decline until 1994. The collapse in prices then forced the National Stud to redirect its draft horse-related activities.|$|E
5|$|The first St. John's dog {{was said}} to be brought to England in or around 1820, but the breed's {{reputation}} had already spread to England; there is a story that the 2nd Earl of Malmesbury saw a St. John's dog on a fishing boat and immediately made arrangements with traders to <b>have</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> these dogs imported to England. These ancestors of the first labradors so impressed the Earl with their skill and ability for retrieving anything within the water and on shore that he devoted his entire kennel to developing and stabilising the breed.|$|E

5|$|The {{principal}} {{sources of}} silver are the ores of copper, copper-nickel, lead, and lead-zinc obtained from Peru, Bolivia, Mexico, China, Australia, Chile, Poland and Serbia. Peru, Bolivia and Mexico have been mining silver since 1546, {{and are still}} major world producers. Top silver-producing mines are Cannington (Australia), Fresnillo (Mexico), San Cristóbal (Bolivia), Antamina (Peru), Rudna (Poland), and Penasquito (Mexico). Top near-term mine development projects through 2015 are Pascua Lama (Chile), Navidad (Argentina), Jaunicipio (Mexico), Malku Khota (Bolivia), and Hackett River (Canada).

5|$|They usually winter along coasts and on inland lakes, bays, inlets, and streams, {{with birds}} {{migrating}} {{to the nearest}} body of water that will not freeze over in the winter: western Canadian loons go to the Pacific, Great Lakes loons to the Gulf of Mexico region, eastern Canadian loons to the Atlantic, and some loons to large inland lakes and reservoirs. They appear {{in most of the}} inland waters of the United States. The South Carolina coast, the Gulf coast adjacent to the Florida panhandle, and the Atlantic seaboard from Massachusetts to Maine <b>have</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the highest concentrations of common loons. Occasional vagrants are recorded inland in Mexico, in San Luis Potosí and Coahuila, as well as in Chiapas and Oaxaca in the south. They are accidental in northern Japan and the Commander Islands in northwestern Pacific, and Cuba in the West Indies.|$|E
