2500|$|After {{the death}} of Abu Bakr, Ali raised Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr. The Twelver Shia view Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr {{as one of the}} companions of Ali. When Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr was killed by the Ummayads, Aisha, the wife of Muhammad and also a renowned scholar of her time, raised and taught her nephew Qasim ibn Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr. Qasim ibn Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr's mother was from Ali's family and Qasim's {{daughter}} Farwah bint al-Qasim was married to Muhammad al-Baqir and was the mother of Jafar al-Sadiq. Therefore, Qasim ibn Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr was the grand son of Abu Bakr the first caliph and the grand father of Jafar al-Sadiq. Jafar al-Sadiq disapproved of people who said anything bad about his great grand father Abu Bakr the first caliph. Zaydis, the largest group amongst the Shia before the Safavid Dynasty and currently the second largest group (although its population is only about 5% of all Shia Muslims), believe that on the last hour of Zayd ibn Ali (the uncle of Jafar al-Sadiq), he was betrayed by the people in Kufa who said to him: [...] "May God have mercy on you!

2500|$|With {{the death}} of Umar Ibn Adbul Aziz the {{scholars}} in Madina got very upset. But {{in the short time}} Umar Ibn Adbul Aziz was in power the changes he made, had a long-lasting effect {{in the minds of the}} people. An associate of Umar Ibn Adbul Aziz, Zayd ibn Ali the grandson of Husayns was also very upset. Zayd ibn Ali then started receiving letters from Kufa asking him to come to Kufa. In 740, Abu Hanifah supported his friend Zayd ibn Ali against an Umayyad ruler but asked his friend not to go to Kufa. Abu Hanifah, Malik ibn Anas and Zayd ibn Ali's family advised Zayd ibn Ali not to go to Kufa feared that Zayd ibn Ali would get betrayed in Kufa. But Zayd ibn Ali felt that he needed to oppose the Umayyads by force. Zaydis believe that on his arrival in Kufa, on the last hour of Zayd ibn Ali, the people in Kufa asked him: [...] "May God have mercy on you! What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> on the matter of Abu Bakr and Umar ibn al-Khattab?" [...] Zayd ibn Ali said, [...] "I have not heard anyone in my family renouncing them both nor saying anything but good about them...when they were entrusted with government they behaved justly with the people and acted according to the Qur'an and the Sunnah.". After which they withdrew their support and Zayd ibn Ali fought bravely against the Umayyad army but was killed. The Scholars kept up the pressure on the Umayyads and as the Umayyads tried to re-impose the taxes abolished by Umar Ibn Adbul Aziz, the population also got more rebellious.|$|E

40|$|Many years ago, when my {{hair was}} still thick, this justice spoke at a conference on state court {{judicial}} elections.

Without pausing for an ethical second, the bold justice from West Virginia said, “Money, my man, money. ” This is the realist backdrop or subtext for much of the discussion about Caperton and also White.

5000|$|The first verse is most {{explicitly}} about drugs.

[...] Writer Ken Beilen describes the second verse as an attempt by the former addict to recover his muse and creativity now that he does not have drugs to fall back on. [...] The third and last verse can be interpreted as being about drugs or about music. [...] Beilen interprets it as being about the former addict being torn between a desire to do his best and a need to fill up an album's worth of songs. [...] But music critic Johnny Rogan points out that lines like [...] "Searchin' for a quality/Havin' to have the very best" [...] can apply equally to the search for quality drugs as to the search for high quality songs. [...] Greenwald seems to accept the drug interpretation, saying that the song shows the singer and addict suffering from drug psychosis.
