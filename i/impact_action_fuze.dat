50|$|On {{impact with}} the target, a delayed <b>action</b> <b>fuze</b> is triggered. This gives {{time for the}} {{projectile}} to penetrate the target before the explosive warhead detonates. The tungsten housing is designed to fragment and produce maximum damage inside the target.|$|R

50|$|The RGO {{hand grenade}} (Ruchnaya Granata Oboronitel'naya, ("Hand Grenade Defensive") is a {{defensive}} Soviet fragmentation hand grenade. It {{consists of a}} double layered steel pre-fragmented body. It {{is very similar to}} the single-layered offensive/defensive aluminium-bodied RGN hand grenade. It uses the UDZS dual <b>action</b> <b>fuze,</b> which has both impact and time delay functions. The impact fuze arms after a pyrotechnic delay of 1 to 1.8 seconds. If the impact fuze has not triggered the grenade after 3.2 to 4.2 seconds a second pyrotechnic delay triggers the grenade. The fragments produced by the grenade generate a lethal radius of between 6 m and 20 m, with the safety radius being 100 m.|$|R
50|$|The <b>fuze</b> <b>action</b> is {{initiated}} by impact, elapsed time after firing or proximity to a target. In {{most cases the}} <b>fuze</b> <b>action</b> causes detonation of the main high explosive charge in a shell or a small charge to eject a carrier shell’s contents. These contents may be lethal, such as the now-obsolete shrapnel shell or modern sub-munitions, or non-lethal such as canisters containing a smoke compound or a parachute flare.|$|R

40|$|<b>Impact</b> <b>actions</b> {{cannot be}} pre-defined {{for it can}} be {{sensitive}} to the interaction between the impactor and target. Thus, analysis of the <b>impact</b> <b>action</b> of a solid object is much more challenging than the analysis of gravitational, wind or blast actions. Both the impactor and target would need to be meshed into finite element models which are then executed by sophisticated analytical software such as LS-DYNA. This type of simulation is time-consuming and labour intensive to operate. This paper presents the much simplified two-degree-of-freedom (2 DOF) lumped mass modelling approach for expediting the analysis which can be implemented on a generic computational tool such as EXCEL or MATLAB. The 2 DOF modelling approach is illustrated herein using <b>impact</b> <b>actions</b> on beams, plates and shells as examples for demonstration. The credibility of the presented computational methodology is demonstrated by consistent agreement between results obtained from different tiers of computational methods...|$|R
40|$|Codified {{provisions}} for estimating <b>impact</b> <b>actions</b> in contemporary codes of practices are convenient to apply but lack generality given that parameters {{associated with the}} inertia resistance of the target have not been incorporated into the provisions. This paper introduces algebraic expressions for estimating the maximum deflection of a structural member when subject to the hard <b>impact</b> <b>action</b> of a flying, or fallen, impactor (or projectile). Once the deflection value is known the equivalent static force value can accordingly be found by calibration. The proposed hand calculation model which is aimed at supporting the design and assessment of structures has been verified by comparative analyses involving physical experimentations and computer simulations. Meanwhile, limitations of the proposed model have also been identified...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the use of}} miniature physical experimentations to demonstrate phenomena of cushion protection and mass protection in the mitigation of <b>impact</b> <b>actions</b> by striking mild steel beam specimens at their mid-span position by a fallen object. These mitigation phenomena have been quantified systematically by comparisons between results from experiments, LS Dyna and hand calculation method (based on principles of equal momentum and equal energy assuming elasto-plastic response behaviour). Good agreement between the predicted and observed displacement values have been found across all the experiments. The presented calculation method is therefore well supported. Meanwhile, limitations {{with the use of}} the conventional quasi-static approach in the analysis of <b>impact</b> <b>actions</b> are highlighted. Significantly, the revealed phenomena have important implications in the design and infrastructure protection of structural elements that are potentially exposed to impact hazards...|$|R

Theoretical researches were carried out to study characteristics of physical and mechanical processes of an <b>impact</b> <b>action</b> for rammers operating elements on foundation soils for oil and oil products storage tanks. In the course of the conducted analytical studies of the dynamics for a conic model <b>impact</b> <b>action</b> on a dispersed noncohesive soil we obtained the dependence of the model's motion velocity change on impact parameters. The increase of the model impact velocity from 0. 47 to 1. 40 m/s resulted in the reduction of interaction process duration in a «model-soil» system from 90 to 56 ms...|$|R

30|$|In addition, the Low Performance {{groups in}} average {{executed}} more blocks of actions with no-impact such as opening or shifting the main menu window in flowchart.com free online concept making environment (see Fig.  8). The average frequencies of the “NoImpact-Possess” and “NoImpact-NoPossess” blocks were 4.6 in High Performance groups (i.e., 46 divided by 20 is equal with 2.3) versus 3 in Low Performance groups (i.e., 30 divided by 10 is equal with 3). Therefore, the average frequencies of the “NoImpact-Possess” and “NoImpact-NoPossess” blocks were 1.3 times {{more in the}} Low Performance groups compared with the High Performance groups. This was not compatible {{with the findings of}} Martinez-Maldonado (2014) and Martinez-Maldonado et al. (2013 b) as in their works the blocks “NoImpact-NoOwner” and “NoImpact-Owner” only appeared in the resulting fuzzy model of the high achieving groups, while the resulting fuzzy model of the low achieving groups did not contain the blocks of “NoImpact-NoOwner” and “NoImpact-Owner”. However, we need to consider an important issue that in the studies conducted by Martinez-Maldonado (2014) and Martinez-Maldonado et al. (2013 b); a “High Only” block was defined and introduced as a mixture of both high <b>impact</b> <b>actions</b> and no <b>impact</b> actions; and a “LowOnly” block was defined and introduced as a mixture of both low <b>impact</b> <b>actions</b> and no <b>impact</b> actions; and a “NoImpact” block was defined and introduced as a block which only includes no <b>impact</b> <b>actions.</b>|$|R
30|$|In {{the same}} way, the most {{significant}} blocks of activity in the Low Performance groups {{with regard to the}} “significance” metric (see Fig.  9) were as follows: (1) HighOnly-Possess (with the highest significance of 1.000), (2) NoImpact-NoPossess (with the significance of 0.998), (3) LowOnly-Possess (with the significance of 0.685), (4) NoImpact-Possess (with the significance of 0.333), (5) IdleShort (with the significance of 0.264 and better correlation metrics of 0.307), and (6) IdleLong (with significance of 0.264 and less correlation metrics of 0.219). Therefore, the resulting blocks of “HighOnly-Possess” (with the highest significance of 1.000) and “IdleLong” (with the lowest significance of 0.264) were the most and the least significant behaviors in the Low Performance groups, respectively. These were not compatible with the findings of Martinez-Maldonado (2014) and Martinez-Maldonado et al. (2013 b), as in their works {{the most significant}} blocks of activity in the low achieving groups (with regard to the “significance” metric) were as follows: (1) HighLow-NoOwner, (2) Inact-Long (or IdleLong), (3) Inact-Short (or IdleShort), (4) HighOnly-NoOwener, (5) LowOnly-NoOwner (or LowOnly-NoPossess), (6) HighLow-Owner, (7) HighOnly-Owner (we changed the same keyword in our work to HighOnly-Possess), and (8) LowOnly-Owner (we changed the same keyword in our work to LowOnly-Possess). However, as mentioned earlier, in their work (and a bit different with our approach in this study) a “High Only” block was defined as a combination of high <b>impact</b> <b>actions</b> and no <b>impact</b> actions; and a “LowOnly” block was defined as a combination of low <b>impact</b> <b>actions</b> and no <b>impact</b> actions; a “NoImpact” block only included no <b>impact</b> <b>actions.</b>|$|R
