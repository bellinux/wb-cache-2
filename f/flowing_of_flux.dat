40|$|Abstract — The Flux Flow Oscillator (FFO) {{is a long}} Josephson {{junction}} {{in which}} a DC bias current and a DC magnetic field maintain a unidirectional viscous <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> magnetic <b>flux</b> quanta. The theoretical linewidth of the electromagnetic radiation generated at the end boundary is due to internal current fluctu-ations as given by the usual expression for the lumped junction. Experimentally, however, the linewidth deviates significantly both in magnitude and functional dependence. We suggest a simple solution {{based on the assumption}} that the bias current creates an additional magnetic field in the junction.

40|$|The study aims at {{deriving}} {{the effective}} conductivity K-ef of a three-dimensional heterogeneous medium whose local conductivity K(x) is a stationary and isotropic random space function of lognormal distribution and finite integral scale I-Y. We adopt {{a model of}} spherical inclusions of different K, of lognormal pdf, that we coin as a multi-indicator structure. The inclusions are inserted at random in an unbounded matrix of conductivity K- 0 within a sphere Omega, of radius R- 0, and they occupy a volume fraction n. Uniform <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>flux</b> U-infinity prevails at infinity. The effective conductivity {{is defined as the}} equivalent one of the sphere Omega, under the limits n [...] > 1 and R- 0 /I-Y [...] > infinity. Following a qualitative argument, we derive an exact expression of K-ef by computing it at the dilute limit n [...] > 0. It turns out that K-ef is given by the well-known self-consistent or effective medium argument. The above result is validated by accurate numerical simulations for sigma(Y) (2) {{less than or equal to}} 10 and for spheres of uniform radii. By using a faced-centered cubic lattice arrangement, the values of the volume fraction are in the interval 0 < n < 0. 7. The simulations are carried out by the means of an analytic element procedure. To exchange space and ensemble averages, a large number N = 10000 of inclusions is used for most simulations.

50|$|Considering those {{conservation}} issues, a Mach effect thruster {{relies on}} Machs principle, hence {{it is not}} an electrical to kinetic transducer, i.e. it does not convert electric energy to kinetic energy. Rather, a Mach Effect Thruster is a gravinertial transistor that controls the <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> gravinertial <b>flux,</b> {{in and out of the}} active mass of the thruster. The primary power into the thruster is contained in the <b>flux</b> <b>of</b> the gravitational field, not the electricity that powers the device. Failing to account for this flux, is much the same as failing to account for the wind on a sail. Mach effects are relativistic by nature, and considering a spaceship accelerating with a Mach effect thruster, the propellant is not accelerating with the ship, so the situation should be treated as an accelerating and therefore non-inertial reference frame, where F does not equal ma.

Measurements of electric field vs current density characteristics at high J values (J = 10 ^{ 6 } A/cm^{ 2 }) are successfully compared to theoretical models <b>of</b> <b>flux</b> <b>flow</b> and <b>of</b> <b>flux</b> <b>flow</b> instability {{in a large}} range of temperatures and magnetic fields. The non-linear regime at high dissipation is analysed in the frame of a modified Larkin Ovchinnikov model that takes into account a quasiparticles heating effect. This model elaborated by Bezuglyj and Shklovskij (BS) defines a transition magnetic field Bt above which the quasiparticles distribution became non uniform due to a finite heat removal from the substrate. From the BS model, we can deduce values of the non-equilibrium lifetime of quasiparticles, which are 10 to 100 times shorter in the dirty sample compared to the clean one and whose temperature dependance is specific to the electronic nature of the Nb film. The study of the non-linear regime provides also a quantitative determination of the thermal transparency of the film-substrate interface. Comment: 13 pages, 7 figure...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} in closed access. Control <b>of</b> {{permeate}} <b>flux</b> {{is important in}} microfiltration processes as it influences trans-membrane pressure and fouling of a membrane. Particles of vegetable oil ranging from 1 to 15 μm were passed through a 4 μm slotted pore membrane at various flux rates. Various intensities of shear were applied parallel to the membrane by vibrating the membrane at different frequencies. At the lowest permeate flux rate (200 l m− 2 hr− 1) the membrane fouled because the drag force was too low to squeeze the deformable oil droplets through the membrane. At higher flux rates the drag force over the oil droplets increased and deformation, and passage, of oil droplets into the permeate was possible. Without any applied shear highest trans-membrane pressure was observed due to fouling, which could be modelled by a pore blocking model. A positive displacement pump was used in experiments which maintained nearly constant <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> permeate. <b>Flux</b> rates varied from 200 up to 1200 l m− 2 hr− 1, and the highest shear rate used was 8, 000 s− 1.
