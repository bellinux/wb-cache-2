Mustapha Nait Lhou, {{the president of}} the Moroccan Ski Association, said that this made Morocco [...] "the most represented among African Arab nations."

At this point, Hotpoint employed around 7,000 people at its four UK sites, {{three of which}} have subsequently closed. Indesit UK has been based at Peterborough since 1 June 2003. At the beginning of 2007, Indesit completely took over Hotpoint and merged it into its own historic brand Ariston, creating a single entity known as Hotpoint-Ariston, Hotpoint now existing as a branding on European-made products.

40|$|Regulation Change is Reasonably Necessary: 1. Number of Tags This {{proposed}} regulatory action {{provides for}} the number of tags for existing zones in a series of ranges and allows for issuing doe tags, if desired. Existing regulations specify the number of pronghorn antelope hunting tags for each hunt. In order to maintain hunting quality in accordance with management goals and objectives, tag quotas for hunts need to be adjusted periodically. <b>Final</b> tag <b>quotas</b> for each zone will be identified and reported in the Final Statement of Reasons based upon findings from the annual winter surveys.

40|$|Accounting {{for about}} 20 % of U. S. total cotton exports in recent years, the Mexican market {{has become a}} key {{destination}} for U. S. cotton production. Simultaneously, the U. S. market is critical for the Mexican textile/clothing sector absorbing almost 50 % of its total output. This strong North American integration process, in part a result of NAFTA, might be jeopardized by the approaching implementation of the Agreement on Textiles and Clothing (ATC) in 2005. This paper {{presents the results of}} an econometric and simulation model that allows for the assessment of potential implications of the ATC’s quota elimination on Mexico’s cotton consumption and U. S. cotton exports to Mexico. It incorporates the growing interdependence between the U.

40|$|Like many {{professional}} leagues {{around the}} world, the Australian Football League (AFL) has implemented labour market controls {{in order to}} try and create a more even competition. Since the 1980 s both a salary cap and a draft system have been implemented in the quest for this objective. Under the Nordenfelt restraint of trade test the AFL is required to show that these controls have created a more even competition, and while the actual measuring of the evenness of a competition is problematic, it is suggested that the AFL can point to a number of factors to help support its claim that it has created a more even competition. These are the fact that during the period from 2000 - 09, all 16 AFL teams made the finals at least once, nearly 70 per cent of the teams reached their <b>finals</b> <b>quota,</b> while seven different teams won the premiership. It should be acknowledged that these labour market controls also place restrictions on the clubs in regard to what players they can recruit, and a study of the premiership teams from 2000 - 10 indicate that a number of different strategies have been successfully adopted by the clubs to create a premiership winning side...|$|R
