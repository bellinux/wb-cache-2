50|$|PixMob {{technology}} uses infrared {{to light}} up RGB LEDs that are embedded in different objects such as balls or wristbands. These wearable objects are given to an audience, transforming each individual into a pixel during the show. To light up each pixel (i.e. each LED), commands are sent from computers to transmitters that emit invisible light (infrared). The infrared signal is picked up by infrared receivers in each object and goes through a tiny 8-bit microprocessor {{to light up}} the LEDs. The type of transmitter involved differs depending of the version of the technology chosen. <b>Wash</b> <b>fixtures</b> or lekos, typically seen in the live entertainment industry, are usually used. For the PixMob video technology, VT transmitters beam video instructions onto the audience, almost like a matrix creating a virtual map. With this technology, the infrared receiver decodes the signal differently depending on each pixel/person’s location. This enables the creation of animated video effects and transforms the audience into a display screen. Despite the low-resolution result due to a low number of pixels, quite detailed video effects can be achieved on a large canvas, using bright colors and bold movements.|$|R

50|$|A {{variation}} of the Source Four PAR is the Source Four PARNel, a <b>wash</b> lighting <b>fixture</b> intended to be an alternative for Fresnel lanterns. The name PARNel is a portmanteau of PAR and Fresnel. The PARNel operates with 750-, 575- or 375-watt HPL lamps that are compatible with all other Source Four fixtures. Unlike traditional Fresnel lanterns, where adjusting the light beam between flood and spot is accomplished by moving the {{lamp and reflector assembly}} relative to the lens, the PARNel is focused by rotating a stippled lens. It can be focused from 25- to 47-degree field angles. The PARNel also uses the enhanced aluminum reflector technology, which theoretically allows a 575 watt lamp to output more light than a standard 1000 watt Fresnel lantern.|$|R
40|$|Strain A 81 of Nocardia corallina hydroxylates or demethylates {{p-anisic acid}} to {{p-hydroxybenzoic}} acid and isovanillic acid. It demethylates veratric acid to {{a mixture of}} vanillic and isovanillic acids. These are both demethylated to protocatechuic acid, which undergoes ring cleavage to afford β-carboxy-cis-cis-muconic acid. The intermediacy of protocatechuic acid in the catabolic pathway of veratric acid was confirmed by blocking ring cleavage with an additional substituent in the ring: 5 -chlorovanillic acid was demethylated to 5 -chloro-protocatechuic acid, which accumulated. Chloro substituents in the ring of other methoxylated benzoic acids also arrested their normal metabolism by the Nocardia: an ortho-chloro substituent thwarted both demethylation and ring-opening. ortho-Hydroxylation of p-methoxybenzoic acid to isovanillic acid was unaffected by a chlorine ortho to the methoxyl <b>group.</b> <b>Washed</b> whole cells of veratric acid-grown N. corallina A 81 produced no detected structural changes in an isolated lignin.

Dielectrophoresis (DEP) in microfluidic chips is an established technique to investigate, <b>group,</b> <b>wash,</b> cultivate and sort cells contact-free under physiological conditions: microelectrode octode cages, versatile dielectrophoretic elements energized with radio frequency electric fields, stably trap single cells or cellular aggregates. For medical applications and cell cultivation, possible side effects of the dielectrophoretic manipulation, such as membrane polarization and Joule heating, have to be quantified. Therefore, we characterized the electric field-induced warming in dielectrophoretic cages using ohmic resistance measurements, fluorometry, liquid crystal beads, infra-red thermography and bubble size thermometry. We compare {{the results of these}} techniques with respect to the influences of voltage, electric conductivity of buffer, frequency, cage size and electrode surface. We conclude that in the culture medium thermal effects may be neglected if low voltages and an electric field-reducing phase pattern are used. Our experimental results provide explicit values for estimating the thermal effect on dielectrophoretically caged cells and show that Joule heating is best minimized by optimizing the cage geometry and reducing the buffer conductivity. The results may additionally serve to evaluate and improve theoretical predictions on field-induced effects. Based on present-day chip processing possibilities, DEP is well suited for the manipulation of cells...|$|R
40|$|Although it is {{well known}} that citrate stimulates the growth of acid fast bacteria, the {{metabolic}} role of citrate is still obscure in this bacterial <b>group.</b> <b>Washed</b> suspensions of mycobacteria either fail to oxidize citrate or oxidize this substance slowly (Edson, 1951). On the other hand, clarified extracts of myco-bacteria oxidize citrate to a-ketoglutarate (Geronimus, Gray, and Birkeland, 1949; Faine, Whiteside, and Edson, 1951). These facts suggest that citric acid may play its conventional part in a Krebs cycle. Lactate, pyruvate, and acetate are readily oxidized by the nonproliferating cells of many species of mycobacteria which will also utilize these compounds as sole sources of carbon when growth takes place in a synthetic medium (Edson and Hunter, 1943; Franke and Schillinger, 1944). In the case of Mycobacterium phlei an acetone powder and soluble extracts prepared from it will oxidize lactate to acetate and carbon dioxide (Edson, 1947). Acetate is formed also from pyru-vate (Lindsay, O'Donnell, and Edson, 1950), but no information has been obtained regarding the pathway for the ultimate oxidation of acetate. The ability of mycobacteria to oxidize intermediates of the citric acid cycle (Edson and Hunter, 1943, 1947; Franke and Schillinger, 1944; Geronimus, Gray, and Birke-land, 1949) suggests that acetate may be metabolized via this catalytic mecha-nism. Hence the problem has been investigated by studying the formation of citrate in preparations made from M. phlei...|$|R
40|$|Background: After {{cardiac surgery}} {{children}} often need {{red blood cell}} (RBC) transfusions. RBC transfusions generate an inflammatory response and are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the clinical effect and inflammatory response in children with RBC transfusion. We hypothesized that washing RBCs before transfusion would reduce the pro-inflammatory response. Methods: In a pediatric prospective randomized controlled clinical trial 48 children treated in the DHZB were randomized to an unwashed or <b>washed</b> RBC transfusion <b>group.</b> The RBCs were washed by a cell savage machine. Blood gas analysis was performed in the packed RBCs and in all patients before and 6 hours after receiving a RBC transfusion. Vital parameters were documented before and 24 hours after transfusion and blood was taken for laboratory analysis and analysis of cytokine concentration using Dry Blood Spots (DBS) and Instant Leukocyte Culture System (ILCS). Results: 45 children were analyzed, 23 receiving unwashed RBCs and 22 receiving washed RBCs. Three children were excluded from analysis. Washing reduced hemoglobin, potassium and glucose and increased sodium concentration in the RBCs. After transfusion an increased diastolic blood pressure was seen in the <b>group</b> receiving <b>washed</b> RBCs. Increased hemoglobin levels and oxygen saturation in the venous blood gas analysis were found in both groups. A reduced sodium concentration was seen in the group receiving unwashed RBCs and a reduced standard bicarbonat concentration was seen in the <b>group</b> receiving <b>washed</b> RBCs. In laboratory analysis hemoglobin, hematocrit and number of erythrocytes were increased in both groups and CRP was reduced. A reduced creatinkinase and an increased serum albumin and calcium were seen in the group receiving unwashed RBCs. In the <b>group</b> receiving <b>washed</b> RBCs a drop of the serum leukocytes and thrombocytes was found. After transfusion an increase of MCP- 1 and TARC in the DBS as well as an increase of IL- 1 α, IL- 6, IL- 8 and MCP- 1 in the ILCS was found in patients receiving unwashed RBCs. IL- 8 was reduced in patients receiving washed RBCs.

40|$|Background and aims: Contaminants are a {{disturbing}} factor for ecosystems, among which “heavy metals” are considered as significant {{due to their}} physiological effects at low concentrations on organisms. This contamination is concentrated several times more in the products that are available in markets as oil than in natural plant, and in each consumption time, a considerable amount, higher than authorized amount of heavy metals may enter into consumer’s body. This study was designed and conducted for this aim to investigate the contamination rate with lead and cadmium in canola (Brassica napus) and safflower (Carthamus tinctorius L.) in the farms around Isfahan Steel factory and to compare this contamination with oil extracted from them. Methods: The present {{study was conducted in}} 2012. The samples were randomly selected from oil seeds of B. napus and C. tinctorius L. in the farms within a 20 to 50 km distance from Isfahan Steel factory. Samples were assigned to two groups and only <b>group</b> 1 underwent <b>washing</b> operation with deionized water. The amount of lead and cadmium in seeds and their oil was measured by atomic absorption. Data were analyzed by SPSS. Results: The results indicated that the lowest lead concentration was 0. 00 µg. g in washed B. napus samples and the highest lead concentration was 24. 74 µg. g in C. tinctorius L. oil extracted by traditional method. The amount of lead was less in washed seeds than unwashed seeds, with a significant difference for B. napus seeds (P< 0. 05). No cadmium contamination was observed in B. napus and C. tinctorius L. plants and the oils extracted from them. Conclusion: A rate of contamination with lead was seen in the plants cultivated near Isfahan Steel factory, but no contamination with cadmium was seen. In view of the lead amount being less in the <b>group</b> <b>washed</b> with deionized water than the unwashed group, it is recommended to do washing steps of oil seeds in the factory at low volume, with clean water, and carefully prior to oil tapping. ...|$|R
