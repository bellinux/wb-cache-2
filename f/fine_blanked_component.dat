40|$|Abstract The {{clearance}} {{between the}} {{punch and die}} of a <b>fine</b> <b>blanking</b> tool is an important design factor that affects the sheared surface of a product. In a <b>fine</b> <b>blanking</b> process, the clearance is typically assigned a 0. 5 % material thickness. If the clearance is too big, a fractured surface would occur in the product while if it is too small, bulging would occur. In this study, a setting for optimum clearance was proposed for inner corner shapes by checking shear characteristics and bulging effects according to various clearances. After designing a special part with various corner shapes possessing SPFH 590 (thickness: 4 mm), a high-strength steel material, a <b>fine</b> <b>blanking</b> tool was constructed and <b>fine</b> <b>blanking</b> experiments were conducted.

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} improve the {{punching}} process, further enhance the blanking section quality. This paper studied the common blanking of 60 Mn and the <b>fine</b> <b>blanking</b> with negative clearance of 60 Mn blanking work piece metallographic structure by using scanning electron microscope. The {{results show that the}} <b>fine</b> <b>blanking</b> with negative clearance process can increase the work-hardening degree and further thin the punching surface tissue, inhibit the crack, and make the blanking surface smooth. The tensile and tear result in the generation of cracks and burrs, and the extrusion forming of <b>fine</b> <b>blanking</b> with negative clearance inhibit the generation of cracks, and eliminate the conditions of the burrs. As the extrusion process, the degree of work hardening in <b>fine</b> <b>blanking</b> with negative clearance is higher than the common blanking, the organizations are more closed. The mechanism of <b>fine</b> <b>blanking</b> with negative clearance The fine-blanking with negative clearance can be summarized as follows: Punch drop and contact sheets. The sheets produced elastic compression, tension and bending. As the punch dropping, the pattern edge pressed into the sheet metal.

40|$|Problem statement: <b>Fine</b> <b>blanking</b> {{process is}} a high {{precision}} process and worldwide in developed countries. Since specimen does not occur fracture {{on the cutting edge}} and {{it is not necessary to}} decorate again in the finishing process for the <b>fine</b> <b>blanking</b> which can be reduced some operation steps. For example, if chain wheel of motorcycle is produced by conventional blanking, it needs nine steps. But, if it is produced by <b>fine</b> <b>blanking,</b> it requires only three steps. With these reasons, <b>fine</b> <b>blanking</b> is boom for the metal forming industry in Thailand. But, due to some mechanical properties for some kinds of metal such as low elongation or imperfect microstructure, it is not cut by using <b>fine</b> <b>blanking</b> directly. Approach: Objective of this research was to investigate microstructure of specimen for <b>fine</b> <b>blanking</b> process in order to avoid fracture surface on blank. The optimum condition will result in higher elongation while having small decrease in tensile strength. The circular specimen with diameter of 16 mm and thickness of 2 mm was chosen. Material was steel which contains 0. 45 % carbon. Results: Microstructures contained pearlite and ferrite grains. The grains sizes were expanded with temperature of heat treatments at 700, 800 and 900 °C, respectively, for 1 h. The specimen exposes to heat treatment in each temperature results in the increase of overall shear surface and the decrease of fracture surface when compared with no heat treatment. This is due to no appearance of strain hardening. For the microstructures exposed to heat treatment at 700 °C for 10 - 20 h were almost spherroidite. It revealed that facture surface became shear surface after heat treatment over 10 h. Conclusion/Recommendations: The changes of microstructure for 0. 45 % carbon steel significantly affected to the overall shear and fracture surface and yield strength due to increasing of spherroidite, thus fracture was decreased with time...|$|R

Using the <b>fine</b> <b>blanking</b> process, a precise finished part with inner and outer forms clearly sheared over the whole material thickness are produced in one single operation. In this study an attempt is made to manufacture a sprocket with <b>fine</b> <b>blanking</b> process. The sprocket is parts for the tape feeder of surface mount system in electronic parts.

40|$|A {{comparison}} between <b>fine</b> and conventional <b>blanking</b> {{is carried out}} in this paper. In the <b>fine</b> <b>blanking</b> process, V-ring indentation is applied to create hydrostatic pressure and prevent premature fracture in an undesired direction.

The fracture path is found according to the stress and strain histories which are calculated in each element. The numerical results have shown that the sheared edge quality in the blanking process is strongly influenced by the fracture path. In <b>fine</b> <b>blanking,</b> there are various parameters affecting the sheared edge quality and dimensional accuracy. The finite element calculation is carried out for an axisymmetric model.

50|$|<b>Fine</b> <b>blanking</b> is a {{specialized}} form of blanking {{where there is}} no fracture zone when shearing.

5000|$|<b>Fine</b> <b>blanking</b> presses {{are similar}} to other metal {{stamping}} presses, {{but they have a}} few critical additional parts. A typical compound <b>fine</b> <b>blanking</b> press includes a hardened die punch (male), the hardened blanking die (female), and a guide plate of similar shape/size to the blanking die. The guide plate is the first applied to the material, impinging the material with a sharp protrusion or stinger {{around the perimeter of the}} die opening. Next a counter pressure is applied opposite the punch, and finally the die punch forces the material through the die opening. Since the guide plate holds the material so tightly, and since the counter pressure is applied, the material is cut in a manner more like extrusion than typical punching. Mechanical properties of the cut benefit similarly with a hardened layer at the cut edge of the part. [...] Because the material is so tightly held and controlled in this setup, part flatness remains very true, distortion is nearly eliminated, and edge burr is minimal. Clearances between the die and punch are generally around 1% of the cut material thickness, which typically varies between 0.5 - 13 mm. Currently parts as thick as 19 mm can be cut using <b>fine</b> <b>blanking.</b> Tolerances between ±0.0003 - 0.002 in are possible, depending on base material thickness and tensile strength, and part layout.|$|R

Therefore, the process can invent different thickness of sheet metal work piece. From these advantages on the sheet metal extrusion, nowadays, it is generally used in many manufacturing of industrial elements fields. The Sheet Metal Extrusions in <b>Fine</b> <b>Blanking</b> (SME-FB) advantages, over a conventional extrusion, are possible due to a blank holder force, a counterpunch force and a large die radius. However, the selection on those parameter values affects on the material flow and the surface quality on the extrusion parts also.

Approach: Objective of this research was to study the effect of die radius on the SME-FB surface which investigated the formation of the failure defection with respect to the several die radiuses by using the Finite Element Method (FEM). Results: From the results, it indicated that applying the small die radius caused the material flow difficult resulting in the decreasing of smooth surface.

40|$|Abstract. Fine-blanking with {{negative}} clearance {{is a kind}} of <b>fine</b> <b>blanking</b> processes. The punch size of fine-blanking {{with negative}} clearance is larger than the die size. The paper does lots of simulations for the changes of blanking force in fine-blanking with negative clearance and common blanking by DEFORM software, and the blanking force curves are gained by these experiments. The changing principle of blanking force and internal material is obtained through the simulation and experiments. The result shows that simulation blanking force of AISI- 1045 is lager than the actual blanking force. According to the curves derived from experiments, we can see that the maximum blanking force of fine-blanking with negative clearance is higher than common blanking force. Compared with fine-blanking with negative clearance, the common blanking force reduces faster after the blanking force reaches maximum value. The experiment result shows that the force of fine-blanking with negative clearance under a smaller blanking clearance is a bit bigger than the force of common blanking force, and the blanking quality of fine-blanking with negative clearance is much better than that of common blanking. Cracks can be closed effectively by the special squeeze forming in <b>fine</b> <b>blanking</b> with negative clearance. Then, the crack can not expand continuously, and the bonding force is enhanced.
