Both cassette units possessed double capstan drives, but with two independent, electronically controlled capstan motors and two separate reel motors. The head assembly moved by actuating a damped solenoid movement, eliminating all belt drives and other wearable parts. These machines rivaled the Nakamichi in frequency and dynamic range. The B710MKII also achieved 20–20,000Hz and dynamics of over 72dB with Dolby C on chrome and slightly less dynamic range, but greater headroom with metal tapes and Dolby C. Revox adjusted the frequency range on delivery with many years of use in mind: when new, the <b>frequency</b> <b>curve</b> went upwards a few dB at 15–20kHz, aiming for flat response after 15 years of use, and headwear to match.|$|E

When the <b>frequency</b> <b>curves</b> of the assembled system are plotted against the constraint location of the virtual element, the nodes and antinodes of the structure of interest can be extracted by examining the minima or maxima of the curves.

40|$|In {{a recent}} letter to the editor, Batan and Gurgoze [1] noted {{mistakes}} that were contained in the paper by Cutchins [2]. Specifically, they observed errors that are caused by numerical evaluations of the frequency equation of a fixed-free axially vibrating bar with a lumped mass attached at a point along the span of the bar (see Figure 1). The frequency equation and the corresponding mode shapes of teh system of Figure 1 are given in reference [2]. Using another solver, Batan and Gurgoze recalculated the first three eigenfrequencies {{of the system of}} Figure 1 {{as a function of the}} location of the lumped mass.

However, unlike the results given in reference [2], the minima of their <b>frequency</b> <b>curves</b> shift with varying values of the lumped mass. Comparing the two curves in Figure 2 of reference [1], it is also noted that the maxima of the two curves occur at the same lumped mass location.

5000|$|Sorting {{is used to}} {{describe}} the uniformity of grain sizes within a sedimentary rock. Understanding sorting is critical to making inferences on the degree of maturity and length of transport of a sediment. Sediments become sorted on the basis of density, because of the energy of the transporting medium. High energy currents can carry larger fragments. As the energy decreases, heavier particles are deposited and lighter fragments continue to be transported. [...] This results in sorting due to density. Sorting can be expressed mathematically by the standard deviation of the grain-size <b>frequency</b> <b>curve</b> of a sediment sample, expressed as values of φ (phi). Values range from <0.35φ (very well sorted) to >4.00φ (extremely poorly sorted).|$|E

50|$|The {{critical}} information {{that allowed the}} receiver to compute location was a unique <b>frequency</b> <b>curve</b> caused by the Doppler effect. The Doppler effect caused an apparent compression of the carrier's wavelength as the satellite approached the receiver, and stretching of wavelengths as the satellite receded. The spacecraft traveled at about 17,000 mph, which could increase or decrease {{the frequency of the}} received carrier signal by as much as 10 kHz. This Doppler curve was unique for each location within line-of-sight of the satellite. For instance, the earth's rotation caused the ground receiver to move toward or away from the satellite's orbit, creating a non-symmetric Doppler shift for approach and recession, allowing the receiver to determine whether it was east or west of the satellite's north-south ground track.|$|E

50|$|The theta model (or Ermentrout-Kopell {{canonical}} model) is {{a biological}} neuron model originally developed to model neurons {{in the animal}} Aplysia, and later used in various fields of computational neuroscience. The model is particularly well suited to describe neuron bursting, which are rapid oscillations in the membrane potential of a neuron interrupted by periods of relatively little oscillation. Bursts are often found in neurons responsible for controlling and maintaining steady rhythms. For example, breathing is controlled by a small network of bursting neurons in the brain stem. Of the three main classes of bursting neurons (square wave bursting, parabolic bursting, and elliptic bursting), the theta model describes parabolic bursting. Parabolic bursting {{is characterized by a}} series of bursts that are regulated by a slower external oscillation. This slow oscillation changes the frequency of the faster oscillation so that the <b>frequency</b> <b>curve</b> of the burst pattern resembles a parabola.|$|E
