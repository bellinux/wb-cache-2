40|$|A generic {{function}} {{is a function}} that can be instantiated on many data types to obtain data type specific functionality. Examples of generic functions are the functions that can be derived in Haskell, such as show, read, and `=='. The recent years have seen a number of proposals that support the definition of generic functions. Some of the proposals define new languages, some define extensions to existing languages. As a common characteristic none of the proposals {{can be made to}} work within Haskell 98 : they all require something extra, either a more sophisticated type system or an additional language construct. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to show that one can, in fact, program generically within Haskell 98 obviating to some extent the need for <b>fancy</b> <b>type</b> systems or separate tools. Haskell's type classes are at the heart of this approach: they ensure that generic functions can be defined succinctly and, in particular, that they can be used painlessly. We detail three different implementations of generics both from a practical and from a theoretical perspective...|$|E

We start out with a module language that supports the usual second-class modules with Standard ML-style generative functors, and includes local module definitions. To demonstrate the versatility of our approach, we further extend the language with the ability to package modules as first-class values—a very simple extension, as it turns out—and a novel treatment of OCaml-style applicative functors.

40|$|This volume {{collects}} {{the extended}} versions of selected papers originally {{presented at the}} two ACM SIGPLAN workshops: ML Family Workshop 2014 and OCaml 2014. Both were affiliated with ICFP 2014 and took place on two consecutive days, on September 4 and 5, 2014 in Gothenburg, Sweden. The ML Family workshop aims to recognize the entire extended family of ML and ML-like languages: languages that are Higher-order, Typed, Inferred, and Strict. It provides the forum to discuss common issues, both practical (compilation techniques, implementations of concurrency and parallelism, programming for the Web) and theoretical (<b>fancy</b> <b>types,</b> module systems, metaprogramming). The scope of the workshop includes {{all aspects of the}} design, semantics, theory, application, implementation, and teaching {{of the members of the}} ML family. The OCaml workshop is more specifically targeted at the OCaml community, with an emphasis on new proposals and tools aiming to improve OCaml, its environment, and the functioning of the community. As such, it is interested in works on the type system, language extensions, compiler and optimizations, applications, tools, and experience reports of exciting uses...|$|R

40|$|Language {{interoperability}} {{is not a}} {{new research}} area for the programming languages community. In the early 2000 s, considerable effort went into understanding how to efficiently marshal data between two interoperating languages. The “last word ” in this area was the birth of the. NET framework which solved the problem by unifying the data model that interoperating languages utilize. Since then, both the. NET framework and the JVM have evolved to handle increasingly larger classes of programming languages, most recently dynamic languages with. NET’s DLR and Java’s Da Vinci machine project. One of the biggest meta-problems that programming language researchers face when developing new languages with <b>fancy</b> <b>type</b> systems is that of relevance. More often than not, the advanced types of these languages make it difficult to understand how to extend these works into more mainstream languages {{so that they can be}} enjoyed by the masses. Because of this, it is difficult for a language designer to make the critical argument that their creation is relevant and useful. Language interoperability makes this situation much more palatable. Imagine a world where your fancy linearly-typed or dependently-typed language could interoperate with the mainstream programming language you use for day-to-day work. As an end-user, this is great because the barrier to adopting the fancy language has been greatly lowered. But as a researcher, now we can leverage a mainstream programming language’...|$|E
40|$|ML modules are a {{powerful}} language mechanism for decomposing programs into reusable components. Unfortunately, {{they also have}} a reputation for being “complex ” and requiring <b>fancy</b> <b>type</b> theory that is mostly opaque to non-experts. While this reputation is certainly understandable, given the many non-standard methodologies that have been developed in the process of studying modules, we aim here to demonstrate that it is undeserved. To do so, we present a novel formalization of ML modules, which defines their semantics directly by a compositional “elaboration ” translation into plain System Fω (the higher-order polymorphic λ-calculus). To demonstrate the scalability of our “F-ing ” semantics, we use it to define a representative, higher-order ML-style module language, encompassing all the major features of existing ML module dialects (except for recursive modules). We thereby show that ML modules are merely a particular mode of use of System Fω. To ease the presentation, we present the semantics of our module language in stages. We begin by defining a subset of the language supporting a Standard ML-like language with second-class modules and generative functors. We then extend this sublanguage with the ability to package modules as first-class values (a very simple extension, as it turns out) and OCaml-style applicative functors (somewhat harder). Unlike previous work combining both generative and applicative functors, we do not require two distinct forms of functor or signature sealing. Instead, whether a functor is applicative or not depends only on the computational purity of its body. In fact, we argue that applicative/generative is rather incidental terminology for pure vs. impure functors. This approach results in a semantics that we feel is simpler and more natural than previous accounts, and moreover prohibits breaches of abstraction safety that were possible under them. ...|$|E
40|$|Dependent types {{provide a}} strong {{foundation}} for specifying and verifying rich properties of programs through type-checking. The earliest implementations combined dependency, which allows types to mention program variables; with type-level computation, which facilitates expressive specifications that compute with recursive functions over types. While many recent applications of dependent types omit the latter facility, we argue {{in this paper}} that it deserves more attention, even when implemented without dependency. In particular, {{the ability to use}} functional programs as specifications enables statically-typed metaprogramming: programs write programs, and static type-checking guarantees that the generating process never produces invalid code. Since our focus is on generic validity properties rather than full correctness verification, it is possible to engineer type inference systems that are very effective in narrow domains. As a demonstration, we present Ur, a programming language designed to facilitate metaprogramming with first-class records and names. On top of Ur, we implement Ur/Web, a special standard library that enables the development of modern Web applications. Ad-hoc code generation is already in wide use in the popular Web application frameworks, and we show how that generation may be tamed using types, without forcing metaprogram authors to write proofs or forcing metaprogram users to write any <b>fancy</b> <b>types...</b>|$|R

Steam is kept up in the engine-room, that there may be no delay should an opportunity for escape present itself. The Captain is in exuberant spirits, though he still retains that wild [...] "fey" [...] expression which I have already remarked upon. This burst of cheerfulness puzzles me more than his former gloom. I cannot understand it. I think I mentioned in an early part of this journal that one of his oddities is that he never permits any person to enter his cabin, but insists upon making his own bed, such as it is, and performing every other office for himself. To my surprise he handed me the key to-day and requested me to go down there and take the time by his chronometer while he measured the altitude of the sun at noon. It is a bare little room, containing a washing-stand and a few books, but little else in the way of luxury, except some pictures upon the walls. The majority of these are small cheap oleographs, but there was one water-colour sketch of the head of a young lady which arrested my attention. It was evidently a portrait, and not one of those <b>fancy</b> <b>types</b> of female beauty which sailors particularly affect. No artist could have evolved from his own mind such a curious mixture of character and weakness. The languid, dreamy eyes, with their drooping lashes, and the broad, low brow, unruffled by thought or care, were in strong contrast with the clean-cut, prominent jaw, and the resolute set of the lower lip. Underneath it in one of the corners was written, [...] "M. B., aet. 19." [...] That any one in the short space of nineteen years of existence could develop such strength of will as was stamped upon her face seemed to me at the time to be well-nigh incredible. She must have been an extraordinary woman. Her features have thrown such a glamour over me that, though I had but a fleeting glance at them, I could, were I a draughtsman, reproduce them line for line upon this page of the journal. I wonder what part she has played in our Captain's life. He has hung her picture {{at the end of his}} berth, so that his eyes continually rest upon it. Were he a less reserved man I should make some remark upon the subject. Of the other things in his cabin there was nothing worthy of mention--uniform coats, a camp-stool, small looking-glass, tobacco-box, and numerous pipes, including an oriental hookah--which, by-the-bye, gives some colour to Mr. Milne's story about his participation in the war, though the connection may seem rather a distant one.|$|R
