25|$|More than 100 senior bank <b>executives</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Royal Bank of Scotland {{were paid}} more than £1 million in late 2010 and total bonus payouts reached nearly £1 billion – even though the bailed-out bank {{reported}} losses of £1.1 billion for 2010. Unions were baffled that any bankers were getting bonuses, considering the bank {{is owned by the}} taxpayer. The 2010 figure was an improvement on the loss of £3.6 billion in 2009 and the record-breaking £24bn loss in 2008. The bonuses for staff in 2010 topped £950 million. The CEO Stephen Hester got £8 million in payments for the year.|$|E
25|$|The {{pilot for}} the show was {{recorded}} in 1967, featuring Clement Freud, Derek Nimmo, Beryl Reid and Wilma Ewart as panellists.

Parsons did not want the job and only reluctantly took it, just for the pilot episode. After the show settled in, again he found himself in the role of a straight man for the panellists. Although <b>executives</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> BBC disliked the pilot, its producer, David Hatch, threatened to resign if he could not oversee a full series.

25|$|Grayson {{has worked}} to combat federal waste, fraud, and abuse. In the September 6, 2009 edition of The New York Times, {{columnist}} Gretchen Morgenson thanked Grayson for uncovering the fact that, due to the federal bailout of mortgage finance giant Fannie Mae, taxpayer money had been funding the legal defense fees for former top <b>executives</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> institution. Grayson requested information about these legal costs after a June 2009 hearing of the House Financial Services Committee. Grayson's work uncovered that, between September 6, 2008 and July 21, 2009, taxpayers spent $6.3 million defending Fannie Mae executives Franklin Raines, J. Timothy Howard, and Leanne Spencer. Taxpayers paid an additional $16.8 million to cover legal expenses of workers at the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, Fannie's former regulator.|$|E

25|$|The station first {{signed on}} the air on March 3, 1958, {{originally}} operating as an independent station. The station was originally owned by San Francisco-Oakland Television, Inc., a local firm whose principals were William D. Pabst and Ward D. Ingrim, former <b>executives</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Don Lee Network and KFRC radio; and Edwin W. Pauley, a Bay Area businessman who had led a separate group which competed against Pabst and Ingrim for the station's construction permit. KTVU's operations were inaugurated with a special live telecast from its temporary studio facility at the former Paris Theatre in downtown Oakland. That June, the station moved into a permanent facility at Jack London Square in western Oakland, which was constructed using material gathered by the Port of Oakland and repurposed from a demolished pier.|$|E
25|$|Born {{and raised}} in New York City, Utada had her first solo {{experience}} in professional recording with Cubic C, a pseudonym used for her earlier English language work. After completing her first record Precious (1998), with the help and guidance of her parents, musicians Teruzane Utada and Keiko Fuji, it failed to generate interest in both the United States and Japan, with the record only appearing at number 38 on the Oricon Albums Chart in the latter country. At the time however, Utada had moved to Toyko and attended Seisen International School, and later the American School in Japan, subsequently scoring a record contract with label Toshiba-EMI. <b>Executives</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> company worked with her to become a classified singer-songwriter instead of an idol singer, but prompt her to write and record songs in Japanese language rather than English.|$|E
25|$|By 1940, {{the average}} {{production}} {{cost of an}} American feature was $400,000, a negligible increase over ten years. A number of small Hollywood companies had folded {{around the turn of}} the decade, including the ambitious Grand National, but a new firm, Producers Releasing Corporation (PRC), emerged as third in the Poverty Row hierarchy behind Republic and Monogram. The double feature, never universal, was still the prevailing exhibition model: in 1941, 50 percent of theaters were double-billing exclusively, with additional numbers screening under the policy part-time. In the early 1940s, legal pressure forced the studios to replace seasonal block booking with packages generally limited to five pictures (MGM carried on with blocks of twelve for a while). Restrictions were also placed on the majors' ability to enforce blind bidding. These were crucial factors in the progressive shift by most of the Big Five over to A-film production, making the smaller studios even more important as B-movie suppliers. In 1944, for instance, MGM, Paramount, Fox, and Warners released a total of ninety-five features: fourteen had B-level budgets of $200,000 or less; eleven were budgeted between $200,000 and $500,000, a range encompassing programmers as well as straight B movies on the lower end; and seventy were A budgeted at $0.5 million or more. In late 1946, <b>executives</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> newly merged Universal-International announced that no U-I feature would run less than seventy minutes; supposedly, all B pictures were to be discontinued, even if they were in the midst of production. The studio did release three more sub-70-minute films: two Cinecolor westerns, Michigan Kid and The Vigilantes Return, in 1947; the self-explanatory Arctic Manhunt in 1949. Fox also phased out B production in 1946, releasing low-budget unit chief Bryan Foy, who had come over from Warners five years before. For its B-picture needs, the studio turned to independent producers like the now-freelance Sol Wurtzel.|$|E

25|$|Apple {{was founded}} by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne in April 1976 to develop and sell Wozniak's Apple I {{personal}} computer. It was incorporated as Apple Computer, Inc. in January 1977, and sales of its computers, including the Apple II, saw significant momentum and revenue growth for the company. Within a few years, Jobs and Wozniak had hired a staff of computer designers and had a production line. Apple went public in 1980 to instant financial success. Over the next few years, Apple shipped new computers featuring innovative graphical user interfaces, and Apple's marketing commercials for its products received widespread critical acclaim. However, the high price tag of its products and limited software titles caused problems, as did power struggles between <b>executives</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> company. Jobs resigned from Apple and created his own company. As the market for personal computers increased, Apple's computers saw diminishing sales due to lower-priced products from competitors, in particular those offered with the Microsoft Windows operating system. More executive job shuffles happened at Apple until then-CEO Gil Amelio in 1997 decided to buy Jobs' company to bring him back. Jobs regained position as CEO, and began a process to rebuild Apple's status, which included opening Apple's own retail stores in 2001, making numerous acquisitions of software companies to create a portfolio of software titles, and changed some of the hardware technology used in its computers. It again saw success and returned to profitability. In January 2007, Jobs announced that Apple Computer, Inc. would be renamed Apple Inc. to reflect its shifted focus toward consumer electronics and announced the iPhone, which saw critical acclaim and significant financial success. In August 2011, Jobs resigned as CEO due to health complications, and Tim Cook became the new CEO. Two months later, Jobs died, marking {{the end of an}} era for the company.|$|E
500|$|All That Glitters is an American sitcom by {{producer}} Norman Lear. It {{consisted of}} 65 episodes and aired between April 18 and July 15, 1977 in broadcast syndication. The show, a spoof of {{the soap opera}} format, depicted the trials and tribulations {{of a group of}} <b>executives</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Globatron corporation. The twist of the series was that it was set within a world of complete role-reversal: Women were the [...] "stronger sex," [...] the executives and breadwinners, while the [...] "weaker sex" [...] – the men – were the secretaries or stay-at-home househusbands.

After his experience of seeing the production of television plays in New York, he was eager to work in drama despite, by his own admission, [...] "knowing nothing about drama." [...] He was nonetheless able to persuade his superiors at CBC to make him Supervisor of Drama Production in 1954. In this position he encouraged a new wave of young writers and directors, including Ted Kotcheff and Arthur Hailey, and oversaw shows such as the popular General Motors Theatre.|$|E
500|$|Defectors {{from the}} Church say that from around 2002, Scientology leader David Miscavige began to {{publicly}} slap, kick, punch or shove <b>executives</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> base who had angered him. John Brousseau, the estate manager at Gold Base and a veteran Sea Org member, said that Miscavige repeatedly faulted his subordinates' work, [...] "constantly berating them, nitpicking everything they're doing, pointing out inadequacies, ineffectiveness, lack of results, blaming {{it all on}} them and their inability to do anything right, {{and on the other}} hand saying how he's got to do everything himself– he's the only one who can do anything right." [...] High-level meetings became tense affairs punctuated by [...] "profane, belittling rants". According to emails said to have come from Miscavige's [...] "Communicator"– the personal assistant responsible for passing on transcribed messages from the leader– he routinely berated subordinates with terms such as [...] "CSMF" [...] (meaning [...] "Cock-sucking motherfucker") and [...] "YSCOHB" [...] (meaning [...] "You suck cock on Hollywood Boulevard").|$|E
500|$|Though {{most of the}} {{developers}} involved in the game were shielded {{from the effects of}} the lawsuit, Double Fine's Caroline Esmurdoc noted that it took a significant toll on Schafer and the other lead <b>executives</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> company. Activision's lawsuit had been filed at the time the game had reached the alpha release state, and would need to be concluded prior to the game's final release; this required the executives to dedicate their time towards information gathering, interviewing, and other legal matters [...] "during the crunchiest, most critical time of development". As such, while they ultimately were able to settle the legal matter, Esmurdoc believed that the impact of the effort in settling the lawsuit impacted the quality of the final product. Schafer wrote more than 50% of the game's dialog in the few months following the completion of the lawsuit and prior to release, a [...] "big crunch" [...] for him.|$|E

500|$|By 2013, The Shawshank Redemption had {{aired on}} fifteen basic cable networks, {{and in that}} year {{occupied}} 151 hours of airtime, rivaling Scarface (1983), and behind only Mrs. Doubtfire (1993). It was in the top 15 percent of movies among adults {{between the ages of}} 18 and 49 on the Spike, Up, SundanceTV, and Lifetime channels. Despite its male-centric cast it was the most watched movie on the female-targeted OWN network. In a 2014 Wall Street Journal article, it was estimated that based on the margins studios take from box office returns, home media sales, and television licensing, The Shawshank Redemption had made $100 million. Jeff Baker, then-executive {{vice president and general manager}} of Warner Bros. Home Entertainment, said that the home video sales had earned about $80 million. While Warner Bros. does not report what it earns in licensing the film for TV, in 2014 current and former [...] <b>executives</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> studio confirmed that it was one of the highest valued assets in Warner Bros. $1.5 billion library.

500|$|The Publicity Bureau was {{the first}} PR agency and was founded by former Boston journalists, {{including}} Ivy Lee. Ivy Lee is sometimes called the father of PR and was influential in establishing it as a professional practice. In 1906, Lee published a Declaration of Principles, which said that PR work {{should be done in}} the open, should be accurate and cover topics of public interest. According to historian Eric Goldman, the declaration of principles marked the beginning of an emphasis on informing, rather than misleading, the public. Ivy Lee is also credited with developing the modern press release and the [...] "two-way-street" [...] philosophy of both listening to and communicating with the public. In 1906, Lee helped facilitate the Pennsylvania Railroad's first positive media coverage after inviting press to the scene of a railroad accident, despite objections from <b>executives.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> time, secrecy about corporate operations was common practice. Lee's work was often identified as spin or propaganda. In 1913 and 1914, the mining union was blaming the Ludlow Massacre, where on-strike miners and their families were killed by state militia, on the Rockefeller family and their coal mining operation, The Colorado Fuel and Iron Company. On the Rockefeller family's behalf, Lee published bulletins called [...] "Facts Concerning the Struggle in Colorado for Industrial Freedom," [...] which contained false and misleading information. Lee warned that the Rockefellers were losing public support and developed a strategy that Junior followed to repair it. It was necessary for Junior to overcome his shyness, go personally to Colorado to meet with the miners and their families, inspect the conditions of the homes and the factories, attend social events, and especially to listen closely to the grievances. This was novel advice, and attracted widespread media attention, which opened the way to resolve the conflict, and present a more humanized versions of the Rockefellers. [...] In response the labor press said Lee [...] "twisted the facts" [...] and called him a [...] "paid liar," [...] a [...] "hired slanderer," [...] and a [...] "poisoner of public opinion." [...] By 1917, Bethlehem Steel company announced it would start a publicity campaign against perceived errors about them. The Y.M.C.A. opened a new press secretary. AT and others also started their first publicity programs.|$|E
