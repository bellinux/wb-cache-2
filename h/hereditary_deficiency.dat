40|$|The {{hematopoietic system}} and the liver are two primary target organs for {{attempting}} somatic gene therapy of <b>hereditary</b> <b>deficiencies.</b> Several leading laboratories have recently been able to demonstrate that bone marrow cells from rodents and non-human primates can be successfully transduced with foreign genes, resulting in the functional expression of these genes in culture. The genetically reconstituted cells can subsequently be transplanted into X-irradiated recipients, and expression of the transduced genes is observed in the recipients for more than 6 months. Subsequently, gene transfer into peripheral T-lymphocytes in humans has been attempted, and the clinical trials are currently in progress. The liver is the other major organ under intensive investigation. Primary hepatocytes can be isolated from rodents, rabbits, and dogs, and successfully transduced with recombinant retroviruses. After autologous transplantation, long term survival of the engrafted cells in vivo has been observed. More recently, {{it has been shown}} that human hepatocytes can also be efficiently transduced with recombinant retroviruses.

40|$|Hereditary thrombophilia is {{associated}} with an increased risk of fetal loss. Assuming that fetal loss is due to placental thrombosis, anticoagulant treatment might improve pregnancy outcome. In an observational family cohort study, we prospectively assessed the effects of anticoagulant drugs on fetal loss rates in women with <b>hereditary</b> <b>deficiencies</b> of antithrombin, protein C or protein S. The cohort contained 376 women (50 probands and 326 deficient or non-deficient relatives). Probands were consecutive deficient patients with venous tromboembolism. Thromboprophylaxis during pregnancy was recommended in deficient women, irrespective of prior venous thromboembolism, and in non-deficient women with prior venous thromboembolism. Outcome of first pregnancy was analysed in 55 eligible women. Of 37 deficient women, 26 (70 %) received thromboprophylaxis during pregnancy, compared with three of 18 (17 %) non-deficient women. Fetal loss rates were 0 % in deficient women with thromboprophylaxis versus 45 % in deficient women without (P = 0. 001) and 7 % in non-deficient women without thromboprophylaxis (P = 0. 37). The adjusted relative risk of fetal loss in women who received thromboprophylaxis versus women who did not was 0. 07 (95 % confidence interval 0. 001 - 0. 7; P = 0. 02). Our data suggest that anticoagulant treatment during pregnancy reduces the high fetal loss rate in women with <b>hereditary</b> <b>deficiencies</b> of antithrombin, protein C or protein S...|$|R

This interpretation is consistent with a number of known properties of proteases and of mutant enzymes, and it has implications regarding the diagnosis of various enzyme deficiency states...|$|R

40|$|Hereditary {{deficiencies}} of early complement components have usually {{been associated with}} the development of rheumatic diseases like systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), while terminal component deficiency is well known to predispose to recurrent neisserial infection.

Persistent absence of C 6 in this patient and production of anti-C 6 antibody after antigenic challenge indicate hereditary C 6 deficiency.

40|$|There is {{a growing}} body of {{evidence}} to suggest that reactive oxidant species (ROS) including O 2 -, OH- or H 2 O 2 act as second messengers to activate platelets via 1) calcium mobilisation, 2) nitric oxide (NO) inac-tivation, and 3) interaction with arachidonic to give formation of iso-prostanes. Among the enzymes generating ROS formation NOX 2, the catalytic core of NADPH oxidase (NOX), plays a prominent role as shown by the almost absent ROS production by platelets taken from patients with <b>hereditary</b> <b>deficiency</b> of NOX 2. Experimental and clinical studies provided evidence that NOX 2 is implicated in platelet acti-vation. Thus, impaired platelet activation has been detected in pa-tients with NOX 2 <b>hereditary</b> <b>deficiency.</b> Similarly, normal platelets added with NOX 2 specific inhibitors disclosed impaired platelet acti-vation along with ROS down-regulation. Accordingly, animals prone to atherosclerosis treated with apocynin, a NOX inhibitor, showed re-duced platelet adhesion and atherosclerotic plaque. Furthermore, a significant association between NOX 2 up-regulation and platelet acti-vation has been detected in patients at athero-thrombotic risk, but a cause-effect relationship needs to be established. These findings may represent a rationale to plan interventional trials with NOX inhibitors to establish if blocking NOX 2 or other NOX isoforms may represent a novel anti-platelet approach...|$|E

In this article, we review our current understanding of the disease mediators of LN. There is ample evidence to suggest a pathogenic role of nephritogenic autoantibodies.

40|$|Background. <b>Hereditary</b> {{antithrombin}} <b>deficiency</b> is a thrombogenic disorder {{associated with}} a 50 – 90 % lifetime risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), which is increased during pregnancy and the puerperium in these patients. We present {{a case of a}} woman with antithrombin (AT) deficiency who presented with a VTE despite therapeutic low molecular weight heparin (LMWH). Though the pregnancy was deemed unviable, further maternal complications were mitigated through the combined use of therapeutic anticoagulation and plasma-derived antithrombin concentrate infusions to normalize her functional antithrombin levels. Methods. A review of the literature was conducted for studies on prophylaxis and management of VTE in pregnant patients with <b>hereditary</b> AT <b>deficiency.</b> The search involved a number of electronic databases, using combinations of keywords as described in the text. Only English language studies between 1946 and 2015 were included. Conclusion. Antithrombin concentrate is indicated in pregnant women with <b>hereditary</b> AT <b>deficiency</b> who develop VTE despite being on therapeutic dose anticoagulation. Expert opinion suggests AT concentrate should be used concomitantly with therapeutic dose anticoagulation. However, further high-quality studies on the dose and duration of treatment in the postpartum period are required. Use of AT concentrate for prophylaxis is controversial and should be based on individual VTE risk stratification...|$|R
