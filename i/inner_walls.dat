5|$|The {{color of}} the spore print is pale yellow. Spores are ellipsoid, smooth, hyaline (translucent), and have {{dimensions}} of 8–10 by 5–6µm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club shaped, two- to four-spored, and measure 24–30 by 8–10µm. Pleurocystidia (cystidia on the <b>inner</b> <b>walls</b> of the tubes) are light yellow brown in color, club shaped, infrequent, and measure 25–38 by 7.2µm; the cheilocystidia (found on the tube edge) are colorless, numerous, and measure 32–47 by 7–10µm. Clamp connections {{are present in the}} hyphae.|$|E
5|$|The spores of C.stercoreus {{are roughly}} spherical and {{relatively}} large, with typical dimensions of 20–35x20–25µm, although great variability in spore size has been noted. The spores are sessile (growing {{directly from the}} surface of the basidium, without attachment via a sterigmata), and are separated from the basidia after it collapses and gelatinizes. This is accompanied by the gelatinization of the <b>inner</b> <b>walls</b> of the peridiole.|$|E
5|$|Built in 1260, {{the church}} {{belongs to the}} {{transition}} period from Romanesque to Gothic architecture. The first {{is characterized by the}} plant ornament of the capital of the pilasters and the second by thee star (asteroid) vaults. The portal was also originally Romanesque – the vimperg on the round arch had a niche with the figure of the patron saint. The <b>inner</b> <b>walls</b> were covered with paintings, the floor consisting of the gravestones of clergymen and distinguished noblemen. A unique round baptismal chapel was built {{in the second half of}} the 14th century.|$|E
50|$|This crater has {{undergone}} some wear, particularly along the southwest where Sierpinski Q intrudes slightly into the <b>inner</b> <b>wall.</b> The rim is higher and the <b>inner</b> <b>wall</b> wider {{along the eastern}} side. There is a prominent ridge within the interior that extends from near the midpoint to the northern <b>inner</b> <b>wall.</b> There are several small craters along the <b>inner</b> <b>wall</b> {{in the north and}} northwest. Only {{a small portion of the}} interior floor along the western half is relatively level.|$|R

30|$|There {{were five}} {{temperature}} measuring {{points in the}} heating barrel. Four measuring points were uniformly distributed on the <b>inner</b> <b>wall</b> of the heating barrel for measuring the <b>inner</b> <b>wall</b> temperature. The <b>inner</b> <b>wall</b> temperature was controlled by electromagnetic induction heating module. The material temperature in the cavity was measured by a probe axially inserted into the barrel.|$|R
5|$|Radar studies {{preceding}} {{and following}} the Lunar Prospector mission demonstrate that the <b>inner</b> <b>walls</b> of Shackleton are similar in reflective characteristics to those of some sunlit craters. In particular, the surroundings appear to contain {{a significant number of}} blocks in its ejecta blanket, suggesting that its radar properties are a result of surface roughness, and not ice deposits, as was previously suggested from a radar experiment involving the Clementine mission. This interpretation, however, is not universally agreed upon within the scientific community. Radar images of the crater at a wavelength of 13cm show no evidence for water ice deposits.|$|E
5|$|The Ayyubid {{period in}} Jerusalem {{following}} its conquest by Saladin {{was marked by}} a huge investment {{in the construction of}} houses, markets, public bathes, and pilgrim hostels. Numerous works were undertaken at the Temple Mount. Saladin ordered all the <b>inner</b> <b>walls</b> and pillars of the Dome of the Rock to be covered in marble and he initiated the renovation of the mosaics on the dome's drum. The mihrab of the al-Aqsa Mosque was repaired and in 1217, al-Mu'azzam Isa built the northern porch of the mosque with three gates. The Dome of the Ascension was also built and restoration work was done to the existing free-standing domes of the Temple Mount.|$|E
5|$|The basidia, the spore-bearing cells, are {{club-shaped}} {{with long}} stalks. They typically hold 4 spores that are sessile, that is, attached {{directly to the}} surface of the basidium, rather than by a short stalk (a sterigmata). Spores measure about 15 to 20µm long by 8 to 12µm wide. They are elliptical, smooth, hyaline, and notched at one end. During development, the spores are separated from the basidia when the latter collapse and gelatinize along with other cells lining the <b>inner</b> <b>walls</b> of the peridiole. The spores expand in size somewhat after being detached from the basidia.|$|E
50|$|This is a worn crater with a rim and <b>inner</b> <b>wall</b> {{that have}} been {{softened}} and have lost the sharp features of a young crater. The satellite crater Priestley X lies across the northern rim {{and part of the}} <b>inner</b> <b>wall.</b> There is a small, relatively fresh crater on the <b>inner</b> <b>wall</b> to the south-southwest. An old crater-like feature is attached to the southwestern outer rim, and shares part of its rim with Priestley. The <b>inner</b> <b>wall</b> is narrower in the southeast than elsewhere. Within the interior is a level, featureless floor.|$|R
50|$|This crater has {{undergone}} steady erosion from minor impacts, {{so that the}} features along the rim and <b>inner</b> <b>wall</b> have become softened and rounded. Significant impacts nearby have covered the floor and sides with ejecta, {{and there are a}} multitude of tiny craterlets along the <b>inner</b> <b>wall.</b> The satellite crater Gruemberger A lies within the interior, along the <b>inner</b> <b>wall</b> to the west-southwest.|$|R
50|$|This is a {{relatively}} fresh crater with a nicely terraced <b>inner</b> <b>wall.</b> This terracing is most notable along the southeastern half of the crater, and nearly disappears along the north-northwest rim where the <b>inner</b> <b>wall</b> is at its minimum extent. The rim and <b>inner</b> <b>wall</b> have not been significantly eroded, {{and there are no}} craterlets of note along the rim.|$|R
5|$|By 1300 only Harlech and Conwy {{had been}} {{properly}} completed: Caernarfon's town walls were finished, {{but much of}} the castle was still incomplete and at Beaumaris Castle the <b>inner</b> <b>walls</b> was only half their intended height, with gaps in the outer walls. By 1304 the total building programme in Wales had come to at least £80,000, almost six times Edward's annual income. Edward had meanwhile become embroiled in a long-running sequence of wars in Scotland which began to consume his attention and financial resources, and as a result further work on the Welsh castles slowed to a crawl. In 1306 Edward became concerned about a possible Scottish invasion of North Wales, spurring fresh construction work, but money remained much more limited than before. By 1330 all new work had finally ceased, and Caernarfon and Beaumaris were never fully completed.|$|E
5|$|Coronary {{artery disease}} {{is also known}} as ischemic heart disease, is caused by {{atherosclerosis}} – a build-up of plaque along the <b>inner</b> <b>walls</b> of the arteries which narrows them, reducing the blood flow to the heart. A stable plaque may cause chest pain (angina) or breathlessness during exercise or at rest, or no symptoms at all. A ruptured plaque can block a blood vessel and lead to ischaemia of the heart muscle, causing unstable angina or a heart attack. In the worst case this may cause cardiac arrest, a sudden and utter loss of output from the heart. Obesity, high blood pressure, uncontrolled diabetes, smoking and high cholesterol can all increase the risk of developing atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease.|$|E
5|$|The temple {{is set on}} a plot of , and {{construction}} took ten years. Initially, the complex comprised two halls, two compounds for the sangha other buildings. The temple was {{the headquarters of the}} Vietnamese khất sĩ Sangha Association until 1980. In 1998, an octagonal nine-story tower, named the Buddha Gem Tower, was built. The tower is lit at night and is visible throughout the surrounding area. The bottom four floors form the library as well as the repository for some relics of Gautama Buddha. Many of the <b>inner</b> <b>walls</b> of the halls of the temple are adorned with relief carvings and paintings depicting important events in the life of Buddha. In the courtyard stands a statue of Avalokiteshvara bodhisattva.|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE. In a prior study, it {{has been}} {{reported}} that glaucoma-tous eyes have a significantly lower density of pores in the <b>inner</b> <b>wall</b> of Schlemm’s canal than do normal eyes. However, in that study the glaucomatous eyes were fixed at much lower flow rates than the normal eyes, and that is now known to affect <b>inner</b> <b>wall</b> pore density. The objective of the current study was to compare the <b>inner</b> <b>wall’s</b> pore density in glauco-matous and normal eyes, accounting for the effects of fixation conditions. METHODS. Outflow facility was measured in enucleated glauco-matous human eyes. Eyes were fixed under constant flow conditions, microdissected to expose the <b>inner</b> <b>wall</b> of Schlemm’s canal, and prepared for scanning electron micros-copy (SEM).

5|$|The {{construction}} slowed during 1296, although debts {{continued to}} build up, and work dropped off further the following year, stopping entirely by 1300, by when around £11,000 had been spent. The halt was primarily {{the result of}} Edward's new wars in Scotland, which had begun to consume his attention and financial resources, but it left the castle only partially complete: the <b>inner</b> <b>walls</b> and towers were {{only a fraction of}} their proper height and the north and north-west sides lacked outer defences altogether. In 1306 Edward became concerned about a possible Scottish invasion of North Wales, but the unfinished castle had already fallen into a poor state of repair. Work recommenced on completing the outer defences, first under James' direction and then, after his death in 1309, Master Nicolas de Derneford. This work finally halted in 1330 with the castle still not built to its intended height; {{by the end of the}} project, £15,000 had been spent, a colossal sum for the period. A royal survey in 1343 suggested that at least a further £684 would be needed to complete the castle, but this was never invested.|$|E
5|$|The {{pavilion}} is rectangular in shape, {{situated in}} the west of Sheesh Mahal, and is prominent because of its centrally arched and extraordinarily curved roof. This unique feature is symbolic of Shajahani architecture. It reflects a mixture of contemporary traditions (at {{the time of its}} construction) of sloping-roof from Bengal, and Baldachin from Europe. This demonstrates the imperial as well as religious image of the subject. The original roof was probably gilded. The <b>inner</b> <b>walls</b> are minutely inlaid with precious and semi-precious stones and silver with delicate parchin kari ornamentation are considered among the finest in the world.Glazed tile mosaics have been used to decorate the spandrels of the arched openings with floral designs and images of angels, genies, and solomonic symbols. The marble screens of the pavilion are crowned with merlons to prevent inmates being seen from the grounds in between the Fort and the river. The overall quadrangle comprises private quarters for royal family and closely resembles Agra fort.|$|E
5|$|Gordon's {{arguments}} are valid {{for the second}} phase (1879–84) when every stone laid required a skilled stonemason. However, Holland's views are valid for the first phase (1848–54) because much of its construction only required unskilled manual labor, assisted only by a steam engine to lift the stones because many weighed several tons each. Only {{a small number of}} stones used in the first phase required a skilled stonemason, the marble blocks on the outer surface of the monument (their inner surfaces were left very rough) and those gneiss stones that form the rough <b>inner</b> <b>walls</b> of the monument (all other surfaces of those inner stones within the walls were left jagged). The vast majority of all gneiss stones laid during the first phase, those between the outer and inner surfaces of the walls, from very large to very small jagged stones, form a pile of rubble held together by a large amount of mortar. The top surface of this rubble can be seen below at Walls in an 1880 drawing made just before the polished/rough marble and granite stones used in the second phase were laid atop it. The original foundation below the walls was made of layered gneiss rubble, but without the massive stones used within the walls. Most of the gneiss stones used during the first phase were obtained from quarries in the Potomac Valley. Only the marble stones of the first and second phases came from Maryland quarries north of Baltimore.|$|E
50|$|This is a {{somewhat}} worn crater formation {{with a wide}} <b>inner</b> <b>wall.</b> There is a pear-shaped crater along the northern <b>inner</b> <b>wall.</b> The interior floor is relatively featureless, with only a small ridge offset to the southwest of the midpoint.|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} {{floor of}} Lomonosov has been resurfaced with lava flows, leaving a dark, level surface marked {{only by a}} few tiny craterlets and some streaks of ray material from Giordano Bruno. Only the lowest portion of the interior is flooded, however, {{and much of the}} <b>inner</b> <b>wall</b> of the rim remains uncovered. The <b>inner</b> <b>wall</b> is narrower along the northern edge where the crater overlies Maxwell. There is also slumped material along the base of the <b>inner</b> <b>wall.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{most unusual}} {{aspect of this}} crater is the {{asymmetry}} of the <b>inner</b> <b>wall.</b> To the northeast the rim is low and the <b>inner</b> <b>wall</b> is quite narrow, almost non-existent. This portion of the rim overlies the interior of an unnamed depression in the surface; most likely a damaged crater. In the remaining arc between the eastern rim clockwise to the north, the <b>inner</b> <b>wall</b> is much wider. As a result, the level inner floor is offset toward the northeast. The interior has a central peak located near {{the midpoint of the}} crater, then forming a linear ridge that continues until it reaches the western <b>inner</b> <b>wall.</b> The floor is otherwise nearly featureless, except for a few tiny craterlets.|$|R

40|$|EP 1588873 A UPAB: 20051213 NOVELTY - The device has {{temperature}} sensors (2, 3) positioned in an <b>inner</b> <b>wall</b> surface for measuring temperature at the <b>inner</b> <b>wall</b> surface. A humidity probe (1) measures relative humidity {{in a region}} surrounded by the <b>inner</b> <b>wall.</b> An evaluation unit (4) is connected with the probe and the sensors, and accesses the values measured by the probe and the sensors. The probe, sensors and evaluation unit are arranged in a common housing (6). USE - Used in an office, dwelling, old house and storeroom. ADVANTAGE - The humidity probe measures relative humidity in the region surrounded by the <b>inner</b> <b>wall,</b> thus facilitating earlier detection of humidity in the critical <b>inner</b> <b>wall</b> surface, and hence preventing the humidity values from being increased in the wall surface. The humidity probe functions even {{in the presence of}} extremely high humidity values and with the presence of condensate. The device can be installed in a simple manner...|$|R
50|$|This crater has {{relatively}} well-defined {{features that}} have not been significantly eroded by subsequent impacts.

50|$|As is {{the case}} with many of the craters on the Moon, this feature has become worn and eroded by {{subsequent}} impacts. A small crater with a flat floor intrudes into the southwestern rim of Quetelet.

There is some slumping along the <b>inner</b> <b>wall</b> to the northwest where the rim makes its closest approach to Campbell, and the narrow terrain between these two craters is rugged and irregular. But the remaining terrain that surrounds the crater is almost equally rugged. The rim appears somewhat straighter along the southwest side, but is roughly circular elsewhere.|$|R
40|$|High speed flow {{finishing}} {{method has}} recently developed, {{which has an}} excellent performance for polishing an <b>inner</b> <b>wall</b> of stainless steel capillary. However, its method seems to be unable to finish the <b>inner</b> <b>wall</b> of stainless steel pipe. Present paper focuses on the finishing of the <b>inner</b> <b>wall</b> of stainless steel curved pipe with high speed flow finishing method. It is found that an elastic string-type mandrel inserted into the hole of curved pipe has great performance on finishing, in which a diameter of mandrel is slightly smaller than hole size of the pipe. Experiments indicate that surface roughness of the <b>inner</b> <b>wall</b> of curved pipe decreases {{with the number of}} slurry flow pass. It is found that surface roughness of the <b>inner</b> <b>wall</b> of a 90 °curved pipe decreases with the number of slurry flow pass, however, it incresases inversely after 80 passes and peculiar roughness curve is generated. On the other hand, a 180 °curved pipe indicates that there is different surface roughness curve compared with 90 °curved pipe. SEM micrographs describe that the spacing of grain boundary on the <b>inner</b> <b>wall</b> surface of the pipe extends gradually with the number of slurry flow pass, and it {{may be related to the}} variation of surface roughness...|$|R
