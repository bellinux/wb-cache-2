The Navy's existing electromagnetic propagation prediction software, the Integrated Refractive Effects Prediction System (IREPS), neglects signal leakage from a duct, approximates diffraction, and assumes atmospheric horizontal homogeneity.

40|$|The {{performance}} of the superconducting (SC) wire windings of the mini-pole superconducting undulator at National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center (NSRRC) has improved. A precise measurement of the magnetic field was undertaken to examine {{the quality of the}} wire winding. We improved the insulation between the wires and the iron pole to avoid degradation of the SC wire when the coil was trained to a large current. A coating (Teflon, layer thickness 0. 045 r 0. 02 mm) on the iron pole is capable of providing insulation to 0. 5 kV. We pasted extra tape (Teflon, thickness 0. 12 mm) on the coating layer; this tape serves as a buffer that prevents the SC wires scraping the coating layer during adjustment of the position of the SC wire during winding. A quenching experiment was performed to measure the tolerance of the coil during extra heating of the beam duct; a heater (Ni 80 Cr 20) simulated the heating of that duct with synchrotron radiation.

40|$|Several {{commercial}} {{tidal turbine}} designs feature axial flow rotors within bi-directional ducts. Such devices are typically intended to increase power extraction through a flow-concentrating effect, operating on flood and ebb tides without a yawing mechanism. Research focused on such devices {{has been limited}} so far, with available results indicating poor performance relative to bare rotors. This study further investigates the relative performance of bi-directional ducted tidal turbines in confined flow. Several duct profiles are evaluated relative to unducted rotors using the Reynolds-averaged NavierâStokes solver ANSYS Fluent. The rotor is represented as an actuator disc, which mimics the streamwise thrust of a real device but does not reproduce its swirl or additional turbulence generation. This idealised model achieves optimal energy extraction and enables fair comparison of duct geometries. Device power is reported relative to total frontal area, reflecting {{the fact that the}} overall dimension of the device will be limited by water depth. Comparisons based on rotor area show how the absolute power is increased by a duct, but that this is attributable to an increase in blockage. The fundamental effect of a duct on a rotor, as well as the secondary effects of <b>duct</b> camber and <b>thickness,</b> are identified by analysing streamwise distributions of velocity, pressure and cross-sectional area along the rotor streamtube. Ducts are found to limit the expansion of the downstream flow, in turn restricting the pressure reduction immediately behind the rotor. This effect, in combination with the reduced volumetric flux through a ducted rotor relative to a bare rotor, results in reduced power extraction. The effects of <b>duct</b> curvature and <b>thickness</b> on turbine performance are also examined.

40|$|Noise {{radiation}} from a flexible rectangular duct wall in a transverse direction involves {{a phenomenon of}} acoustic-structural coupling. Maximum sound radiation happens near coupling modes due to effective energy exchange between acoustic-structural subsystems. Prediction of the coupling modes and also understanding of dominant mode behavior in the flexible rectangular duct requires free vibration analysis. The present paper discusses the mode coupling approach and Impedance-Mobility formulation. Mode coupling approach {{is used to calculate}} the coupled natural frequency. Impedance-Mobility formulation is used to decide the dominant uncoupled mode type at the coupled frequencies. In the impedance-mobility approach, it is presumed that coupled response can be described in terms of finite sets of the uncoupled acoustic and structural modes of a duct. Impedance and Mobility terms are expressed in terms of uncoupled frequencies of acoustic and structural subsystems. Uncoupled duct structural modes are calculated by using the equivalent plate model. The calculated impedance and mobility matrices are arranged in the form of Eigenvalue problem to calculate the Eigen frequencies and decay time. The dominance of coupled behavior in a system can be estimated using transfer factor which developed based on the electrical transfer factor theory.

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that the {{presence}} of elevated ducts in the lower atmosphere has an adverse effect on the inversion of GPS radio occultation data. The problem arises because the microwave refractivity within and below an elevated duct is no longer uniquely determined by the bending angle profile. Applying Abel inversion without a priori knowledge of the duct will introduce a negative bias in the retrieved refractivity profile within and below the duct. In this work, high vertical resolution radiosonde data are used to give a quantitative assessment of the characteristics and effects of ducts, including their frequency of occurrences, heights, and thicknesses at different latitudes and seasons. The negative bias from the Abel-retrieved refractivity profiles resulting from these ducts is also computed. The results give a strong indication that ducting in the lower troposphere is a frequent phenomenon over the tropics and midlatitudes. The ducts are shown to be predominantly caused by sharp changes in the vertical structure of water vapor. The majority of the ducts are found to be below 2 km, with a median <b>duct</b> layer <b>thickness</b> of about 100 m. The negative refractivity bias is shown to be largest below 2 km, with a median value of about 0. 5 - 1 % in the tropics and 0. 2 - 0. 5 % in midlatitudes.

In this study, we have emphasized on {{the technical aspects of}} using the linear stapling device for a bulky target organ. Methods: From March 2010 to September 2013, 46 patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma, who underwent pancreatic resection with radical intent at our institute, were reviewed retrospectively. Among them, three patients (6. 5 %) underwent extended distal pancreatectomy. A linear stapling device and vise-grip locking pliers were used for en bloc resection of the distal pancreas, first duodenal portion, and distal common bile duct. The results were compared with those after standard pancreatectomy. Results: All three patients presented with jaundice, and the ratio of pancreatic <b>duct</b> to parenchymal <b>thickness</b> of the pancreatic body was greater than 0. 5. Grade A pancreatic fistula developed in all of the cases, but none of these fistulae were lethal. Pathological staging was T 3 N 1 M 0 in all of the patients. The postoperative daily serum glucose fluctuations and insulin requirements were comparable to those in patients who received pancreaticoduodenectomy or distal pancreatectomy. At the last follow-up, two patients were alive with liver metastasis at 4 and 10 months postoperatively, respectively, and one patient died of liver metastasis at 5 months postoperatively.

The purpose of this thesis work was to evaluate if the ESH could meet the European and Swedish passive house classification in Sibernik, Ljubljana, Lund, Ãstersund, Sundsvall and Kiruna. The purpose was also to make a sensitivity analysis of different energy efficiency measures in the energy performance of the building. This analysis was conducted to understand which of the selected energy efficiency measures made the most significant improvements in the results. The measures included in the sensitivity analysis were the building envelopes wall insulation thickness, changing the window frames, altering the ventilation air duct length and width as well as increasing the air <b>duct</b> insulation <b>thickness.</b> Finally, simulations with solar panels {{on the roof of the}} ESH were carried out. For the European passive house classification, the study involved constructing the model in the Passive House Planning Package (PHPP) and simulating each region and energy efficiency measures separately. PHPP is however made specifically for verifying buildings according to the European passive house standard. So the demands for the Swedish passive house classification cannot be calculated in the PHPP simulations. Because of this, the data available through PHPP was used to manually calculate the Swedish passive house requirements. The results showed that the original ESH model, was only passive house certifiable according to the European classification in Sibernik. When including the additional energy efficiency measures it was possible for the ESH to become passive house certifiable in Lund, Ljubljana and Sibernik. The Swedish passive house classification results suggests that the ESH may be passive house certifiable in Lund. Also, with additional energy efficiency measures the ESH may meet the passive house requirements in Sundsvall and Kiruna. However, all the passive house classification parameters could not be considered in this study. Accordingly, additional analysis are required to draw final conclusions on whether the ESH building could meet the Swedish passive house certification in the different Swedish climate zones. The conclusions drawn were that all the energy efficiency measures contribute to reducing the primary energy demand, heating demand and the heating load. However, these same energy efficiency measures would at the same time increase the cooling demand. Because of this, it was discussed that specific regional models should be made. Because some regional models might benefit from not including the energy efficiency measures used in this thesis at all. They might instead benefit from finding and implementing energy efficiency measures that reduce the cooling demand...|$|R

The halo cells were the least common cell type observed. The smooth muscle layers that encircle epididymal <b>duct</b> increase its <b>thickness</b> from head to tail direction. The volume density of epididymal duct was high in head and tail region {{compare with that of}} body region. The epithelial volume density decreased from head to tail direction and the opposite was observed for the luminal volume density. The tubular diameter found to be similar in all six regions except proximal tail which had the highest diameter (5. 9 mm). The decrease of the epithelial height from head to tail direction contributed for the increase of the luminal diameter in the same direction. The height of stereocilia was found low in the distal head (1. 2 mm) and distal tail (1. 4 mm) region compare {{to the rest of the}} regions. Four types of cells namely principal cells, halo cells, basal cell and epical cells, are present in the epididymal duct. The sperm storage area in the tail of the epididymis is increased due to an increase in the luminal diameter caused by a decreased in epithelial height and length of stereocilia...|$|R
40|$|The {{focus of}} this thesis is on the {{prediction}} of sound attenuation through a lined duct, based on a mathematical model. Ducts with a single section as well as multi-segmented sections are discussed. The duct of interest has a rectangular cross-section as normally used for ventilation purposes. The mean flow in a ventilation duct is very low and can be neglected. In this thesis, two-dimensional analytical models are developed for sound transmission {{in a series of}} different duct configurations. Two models of the lining behaviour are considered, either locally-reacting or bulk-reacting. The models are used first to obtain the transverse and axial wavenumbers of various modes of the duct. The required finite numbers of wavenumbers are tracked using MÃ¼llerâs method. The wavenumbers are traced from a very low frequency to high frequency using small frequency steps. It is found that, for a duct with a bulk-reacting lining, the number of modes with a transverse wavenumber below a particular value may exceed the corresponding number of modes in a duct with a locally-reacting lining. These additional modes are termed lining modes. The number of lining modes depends on the lining thickness. Dispersion curves are presented for both types of lining. The transmission of sound through the duct is then calculated using the mode-matching technique. The mode-matching model allows analysis of multi-modal wave propagation in the duct. The model is first developed for an infinitely long rigid duct with a finite length of lined insert. The estimation from the locally reacting model, that is widely available in the literature, is compared with the estimation from the newly developed bulk-reacting model. Although the locally reacting model often overestimates the performance of a bulk-reacting lining it is found that this is not always the case, especially for a small lining thickness and at lower frequencies where the locally reacting model may under-estimate the performance. The analytical model is then extended to a multi-segmented lining where the lined section is uniformly segmented with rigid walled sections in a periodic manner. For a bulk-reacting lining, the segmented arrangement renders the lining more similar to the behaviour of a duct with a locally-reacting lining and improves the peak attenuation. Little improvement is found {{in the case of a}} multi-segmented locally-reacting lining. The effect of <b>duct</b> height, lining <b>thickness</b> and lining flow resistivity on sound attenuation is studied using the analytical model. Experiments are presented which validate the analytical model...|$|R
40|$|This {{document}} addresses problems encountered when {{establishing the}} very low air-flow speeds required for experimental {{investigations of the}} mechanisms of low-Reynolds-number boundary-layer turbulence. Small-scale motions in the near-wall region are important features of turbulent boundary-layer dynamics, and, if these features are to be resolved by measurements in air with conventionally-sized hot-wire probes, a well-behaved canonical turbulent boundary layer must be developed at free stream flow speeds no higher than 4 m/s. However, at such low speeds, the turbulent boundary layers developed {{on the walls of}} a wind tunnel are very susceptible to perturbation by non-turbulent time-dependent flow structures which originate upstream from the test section in the laminar flow at the inlet and in the contraction. Four different non-turbulent flow structures have been identified. The first is a result of quasi-two-dimensional separation of the laminar boundary-layer from the surfaces of the wind-tunnel contraction. Potential flow simulations show that susceptibility to this form of separation is reduced by increasing the degree of axisymmetry in the cross-section geometry and by decreasing the streamwise curvature of the concave surfaces. The second source of time-dependence in the laminar boundary-layer flow is an array of weak streamwise vortices produced by Goertler instability. The Goertler vortices can be removed by boundary-layer suction at the contraction exit. The third form of flow perturbation, revealed by visualisation experiments with streamers, is a weak large-scale forced-vortex swirl produced by random spatial fluctuations of temperature at the wind-tunnel inlet. This can be prevented by thorough mixing of the inlet flow; for example, a centrifugal blower installed at the inlet reduces the amplitude of temperature nonuniformity by a factor of about forty and so prevents buoyancy-driven swirl. When subjected to weak pressure gradients near the start of a wind-tunnel contraction, Goertler vortices in laminar wall layers can develop into three-dimensional separations with strong counter-rotating trailing vortices. These trailing vortices are the fourth source of unsteady flow in the test-section. They can be suppressed by a series of appropriately located screens which remove the low-speed-streak precursors of the three-dimensional separations. Elimination of the above four contaminating secondary flows permits the development of a steady uniform downstream flow and well-behaved turbulent wall layers. Measurements of velocity in the turbulent boundary layer of the test-section have been obtained by hot-wire anemometry. When a hot-wire probe is located within the viscous sublayer, heat transfer from the hot-wire filament to the wall produces significant errors in the measurements of both the mean and the fluctuating velocity components. This error is known as wall-proximity effect and two successful methods are developed for removing it from the hot-wire signal. The first method is based on the observation that, if all experimental parameters except flow speed and distance from the wall are fixed, the velocity error may be expressed nondimensionally as a function of only one parameter, in the form DeltaU^+=f(y^+). The second method, which also accommodates the effect of changing the hot-wire overheat ratio, is based on a dimensional analyis of heat transfer to the wall. Velocity measurements in the turbulent boundary layer at the mid-plane of a nearly square test-section duct have established that, when the boundary-layer thickness is less than one quarter of the duct height, mean-velocity characteristics are indistinguishable from those of a two-dimensional flat-plate boundary layer. In thicker mid-plane boundary layers, the mean-velocity characteristics are affected by stress-induced secondary flow and by lateral constriction of the boundary-layer wake region. A significant difference between flat-plate and duct boundary layers is also observed in momentum-balance calculations. The momentum-integral equation for a duct requires definitions of momentumd and displacement thickness which are different from those given for flat-plate boundary layers. Momentum-thickness growth rates predicted by the momentum-integral equation for a duct agree closely with measurements of the newly defined <b>duct</b> momentum <b>thickness.</b> Such agreement cannot be obtained in terms of standard flat-plate momentum <b>thickness.</b> In <b>duct</b> boundary layers with Reynolds numbers Re_theta between 400 and 2600, similarity in the wake-region distributions of streamwise turbulence statistics has been obtained by normalising distance from the wall with the flat-plate momentum thickness, theta_ 2. This result indicates that, in contrast with the mean velocity characteristics, the structure of mid-plane turbulence does not depend on the proportion of duct cross-section occupied by boundary layers and is essentially the same as in a flat-plate boundary layer. For Reynolds numbers less than 400, both wall-region and wake-region similarity fail because near-wall turbulence events interact strongly with the free stream flow and because large scale turbulence motions are directly influenced by the wall. In these conditions, which exist in both duct and flat-plate turbulent boundary layers, there is no distinct near-wall or wake region, and the behaviour of turbulence throughout the boundary layer depends on both wall variables and on outer region variables simultaneously.
