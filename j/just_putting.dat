25|$|I think I thought I {{could handle}} things. Didn't {{know how to}} shoot music. Music had been {{important}} in my films, it was usually post production. This was tough stuff to shoot. I already had a great respect for people like Minnelli. I just couldn't seem {{to work it out}} without <b>just</b> <b>putting</b> up multiple cameras and shooting an awful lot of film... I later realized or talked to people about this and MGM in the old days everybody was on contract and they would rehearse for weeks. We don't get that. We would stage it and shoot it. We got the songs a lot of times just a few days before we shoot. We only get the final song. The structural advantage of the old studio system we didn't have. It made a very inefficient shoot. I don't think there was any other way to do it given the circumstances.|$|E

Surprised, the Americans first raised a white flag to show their {{friendly}} intentions but then a second shot was fired along with a third. Trying to get up steam, the Saginaw turned around and withdrew slowly to 900 yards, by which time her crew were at station and ready for action. The American gunners returned fire with one of their 32-pounders and after only about twenty minutes the Vietnamese guns were silenced. A secondary explosion was observed and it was suspected that either the powder magazine of the fort, {{or one of the}} guns, blew up and killed their operators. After the explosion no further shots were fired from the fort. However, the Saginaw 's gunners continued their bombardment for another half-hour unopposed until the fort was in ruins. American forces suffered no damage or casualties and after the action, communicating with the natives proved fruitless so the Saginaw steamed back to Hong Kong.|$|E

At Workington, he would answer supporters' letters in person, using an old typewriter. But he said he preferred to phone business-people as he would put {{as little as possible}} in writing when dealing with them. He would readily obtain match tickets for fans whom he considered to be deserving cases and wrote in his autobiography that he [...] "would give people anything within reason".|$|E

500|$|Lamb {{attempted}} suicide {{several times and}} for years afterwards bore scars where {{he had tried to}} slit his wrists. According to Nosanchuk, by early March 1966 the prisoner's behaviour [...] "bordered on psychotic". During this month he threw food at an officer and was once again found with a broomstick in his rectum, this time dragging it around the floor of his cell and laughing. When Scott sedated Lamb and questioned him on the latter incident, the boy said he had just been trying to annoy the guard on duty. Scott once again noted his concern that Lamb was developing a hypomanic condition, a mania of low intensity, and on 18 March committed him to Kingston Psychiatric Hospital for a month. Scott wrote in his report to the hospital that he was not sure whether Lamb's condition was genuine or whether he was <b>just</b> <b>putting</b> on an act.|$|E
500|$|Introspection {{was also}} listed {{as one of}} the {{foundational}} themes prevalent on the album, along with [...] "genuine statements of personal and careerist reflection scattered among the posturing of 'Bitch I'm Madonna' and 'Unapologetic Bitch'" [...] according to Slant Magazines Sam C. Mac as well as her [...] "obsessive self-regard". Madonna explained to Jon Pareles of The New York Times that although she has never looked back at her past endeavors, reminiscing about it felt right for Rebel Heart. [...] "And it's bittersweet for me to think about that. It just seemed like a time where I wanted to stop and look back. It's kind of like survivor guilt. How did I make it and they didn't?" [...] During the album's development phase, she became comfortable expressing her ideas in front of a few people, comparing it to: [...] "writing your diary in front of somebody and reading it out loud... It was almost like an acting exercise, you know, <b>just</b> <b>putting</b> myself in a room and letting ideas flow even if I didn't feel so connected to the people".|$|E
500|$|In April 2014, Minaj {{posted a}} picture on Instagram of herself with Soulja Boy in a studio. Later that month, he posted a Vine of him singing the song's chorus. Originally, Joseph DaVinci & Soulja Boy created the song's beat but {{according}} to him, it lacked a hook. However, he later {{came up with the}} idea for the hook while making a Vine, and added it into the song. He then brought the unfinished version of [...] "Yasss Bish" [...] to Minaj, who was impressed by the song and recorded her vocals. After Minaj sent the track back to him, it took [...] "about a day" [...] for Soulja Boy to finish mixing the record. In May 2014, Minaj spoke of the meaning behind the word [...] "yasss": [...] "When I watch RuPaul's Drag Race,' I live for the way they speak. Females, we adopted it and it makes us feel like very cocky and very just like sexy and feminine. So saying 'yass' as opposed to 'yes,' it's <b>just</b> <b>putting</b> on a billion times more attitude to the word 'yes'."

500|$|After the {{recording}} sessions were completed, Nirvana sent unmastered tapes {{of the album}} to several individuals, including the president of DGC's parent company Geffen Records Ed Rosenblatt and the group's management company Gold Mountain. [...] When asked about the feedback he received, Cobain told Michael Azerrad, [...] "The grown-ups don't like it." [...] He said he was told his songwriting was [...] "not up to par", the sound was [...] "unlistenable", {{and that there was}} uncertainty that mainstream radio would welcome the sound of Albini's production. [...] There were few people at Geffen or Gold Mountain who wanted the band to record with Albini to begin with, and Cobain felt he was receiving an unstated message to scrap the sessions and start all over again. [...] Cobain was upset and said to Azerrad, [...] "I should just re-record this record and do the same thing we did last year because we sold out last year—there's no reason to try and redeem ourselves as artists at this point. [...] I can't help myself—I'm <b>just</b> <b>putting</b> out a record I would like to listen to at home." [...] However, a number of the group's friends liked the album, and by April 1993, Nirvana was intent on releasing In Utero as it was. [...] According to Cobain, [...] "Of course, they want another Nevermind, but I'd rather die than do that. [...] This {{is exactly the kind of}} record I would buy as a fan, that I would enjoy owning." ...|$|E
500|$|Also in December, {{the music}} video for [...] "I'm Made of Wax, Larry, What Are You Made Of?" [...] was filmed, {{directed}} by Dan Dobi. In early March 2010 the band announced via their Twitter account that the video {{was set for}} release, with a date of March 16. This was further confirmed a few days later, with some fans being able to view it before its release. A delay in releasing it occurred as the band were trying to negotiate with MTV, as Westfall commented: [...] "I think it's more important to have them [...] on board, instead of <b>just</b> <b>putting</b> it on, like, YouTube." [...] "Have Faith in Me" [...] was released as a radio single on March 2, 2010. The video for [...] "I'm Made of Wax, Larry, What Are You Made Of?" [...] had its television premiere on MTV on March 16. The music video {{was based on an}} idea from a friend Kyle Crawford, as McKinnon said: [...] "He was like, 'Hey, you should totally make a video where you guys are playing kickball and you play a bunch of kids and just kick the s*** out of them?" [...] I was like, [...] "That is a great idea. Let's look into it.'" [...] Asked why it was the band's next music video, Westfall said [...] "it stands out compared to the other songs" [...] as [...] "it's a harder song." [...] The song was also released as a radio single.|$|E
500|$|Esther is {{introduced}} in press materials as being [...] "an innocent {{in a world}} of assassins, liars and zealots". Havins describes Drummond as [...] "an optimist and the glass is half full person". A promotional video released by Starz provided background information on Esther including her college education—the character introduces herself by stating that she has a BA in Linguistics and a Masters in Cognitive science. Series four writer Jane Espenson enjoyed writing for Esther as she felt the character to be most similar to herself. She notes that when devising Esther's backstory the writer's [...] "ended up <b>just</b> <b>putting</b> my college experience down." [...] Esther's introduction invites parallels that of lead female character Gwen Cooper (Eve Myles) in the series' 2006 premiere episode [...] "Everything Changes"; she represents an audience surrogate for new American viewers. Havins refers to Esther as the [...] "tour guide" [...] for new viewers coming to Torchwood for the first time, one who is [...] "digging deeper and deeper into the rabbit hole". Despite similarities to their introduction, Havins comments that Esther as a character has a less action-orientated role than Gwen, being more the [...] "techie" [...] of the team who uses her intellect and technology as her weapons. The actress feels that Esther's desk-bound analyst position is [...] "her safe little world". Head writer and executive producer Russell T Davies described Esther as [...] "a very healing force" [...] in helping the other more outspoken characters gel together as a team because she is [...] "much more able to empathise with people." [...] The character's sister, Sarah Drummond (Candace Brown), recurs throughout Miracle Day, Havins feels that her presence helps [...] "humanise the situation" [...] as including family members helps the audience [...] "understand why people react a certain way." [...] Espenson notes that the first scene between Esther and Sarah was discussed at length at the writer's room—the writers chose to make Esther's choice whether or not to refer her ill sister to social services [...] "as difficult as possible" [...] to heighten the pain felt by the character.|$|E

2500|$|Rather than {{work with}} Date, their {{producer}} for many years, Deftones decided to record with Bob Ezrin on their fifth studio album.

After recording all the instrumental parts for the record, Moreno decided to record his vocals separately, and finished recording the album with former Far guitarist Shaun Lopez as producer. According to an interview with Abe Cunningham, there were tensions involved with the recording of Saturday Night Wrist that were related to the band members' personal lives.

Critic Scott Mendelson said [...] "To say that these two are the most astonishingly racist caricatures that I've ever seen in a mainstream motion picture would be an understatement."

2500|$|The modern game-theoretic {{concept of}} Nash {{equilibrium}} is instead {{defined in terms}} of mixed strategies, where players choose a probability distribution over possible actions. The concept of the mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium was introduced by John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern in their 1944 book The Theory of Games and Economic Behavior. However, their analysis was restricted to the special case of zero-sum games. They showed that a mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium will exist for any zero-sum game with a finite set of actions. The contribution of Nash in his 1951 article Non-Cooperative Games was to define a mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium for any game with a finite set of actions and prove that at least one (mixed-strategy) Nash equilibrium must exist in such a game. The key to Nash's ability to prove existence far more generally than von Neumann lay in his definition of equilibrium. According to Nash, [...] "an equilibrium point is an n-tuple such that each player's mixed strategy maximizes his payoff if the strategies of the others are held fixed. Thus each player's strategy is optimal against those of the others." [...] <b>Just</b> <b>putting</b> the problem in this framework allowed Nash to employ the Kakutani fixed-point theorem in his 1950 paper, and a variant upon it in his 1951 paper used the Brouwer fixed-point theorem to prove that there had to exist at least one mixed strategy profile that mapped back into itself for finite-player (not necessarily zero-sum) games, namely, a strategy profile that did not call for a shift in strategies that could improve payoffs.|$|E
2500|$|Reapers have a {{physical}} body and may {{interact with the}} living and the dead. Besides collecting souls, reapers have powers to remain ageless, heal extremely quickly (George once severed her middle finger, but was able to reattach it by <b>just</b> <b>putting</b> it back in place, while Mason has sustained what should have been fatal damage on multiple occasions, such as being shot and hit by a car), drink alcohol without suffering a hangover (see [...] "Gravelings"), and forcibly pull a soul from a living body and replace it (as seen done by Roxy in Episode 9 [...] "Sunday Mornings"). When seen by the living, reapers' physical appearances are different from when they were alive to those who knew them, except on Halloween when the living see them as they were in life, and fellow reapers always see their original appearances. Although George is seen by her family and Delores as [...] "Millie," [...] Rube's image was recognizable by a records clerk in a wanted poster seen while Rube and the clerk were doing some research into his past life. Laura Boddington portrays lead character George's 'undead' appearance in the TV series, with Jennifer Rae Westley playing her in the later film. Supporting evidence that others can see their [...] "original" [...] faces is upheld by Kiffany, who does not notice any alterations to their appearances on Halloween, and by numerous one off characters who comment on George's physical appearance (brown eyes, etc.) that would not match her 'undead' appearance.|$|E
