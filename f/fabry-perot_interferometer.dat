5|$|The {{heart of}} the <b>Fabry–Pérot</b> <b>interferometer</b> {{is a pair of}} {{partially}} silvered glass optical flats spaced several millimeters to centimeters apart with the silvered surfaces facing each other. (Alternatively, a Fabry–Pérot etalon uses a transparent plate with two parallel reflecting surfaces.) As with the Fizeau interferometer, the flats are slightly beveled. In a typical system, illumination is provided by a diffuse source set at the focal plane of a collimating lens. A focusing lens produces what would be an inverted image of the source if the paired flats were not present; i.e. {{in the absence of the}} paired flats, all light emitted from point A passing through the optical system would be focused at point A'. In Fig.6, only one ray emitted from point A on the source is traced. As the ray passes through the paired flats, it is multiply reflected to produce multiple transmitted rays which are collected by the focusing lens and brought to point A' on the screen. The complete interference pattern takes the appearance of a set of concentric rings. The sharpness of the rings depends on the reflectivity of the flats. If the reflectivity is high, resulting in a high Q factor (i.e. high finesse), monochromatic light produces a set of narrow bright rings against a dark background. In Fig.6, the low-finesse image corresponds to a reflectivity of 0.04 (i.e. unsilvered surfaces) versus a reflectivity of 0.95 for the high-finesse image.|$|E

25|$|From the {{perspective}} of solid state physics, Brillouin scattering is an interaction between an electromagnetic wave {{and one of the}} three above-mentioned crystalline lattice waves. The scattering is inelastic i.e. the photon may lose energy (Stokes process) and in the process create one of the three quasiparticle types (phonon, polaron, magnon) or it may gain energy (anti-Stokes process) by absorbing one of those quasiparticle types. Such a shift in photon energy, corresponding to a Brillouin shift in frequency, is equal to the energy of the released or absorbed quasiparticle. Thus, Brillouin scattering can be used to measure the energies, wavelengths and frequencies of various atomic chain oscillation types ('quasiparticles'). To measure a Brillouin shift a commonly employed device called the Brillouin spectrometer is used, the design of which is derived from a <b>Fabry–Pérot</b> <b>interferometer.</b>|$|E

2500|$|An {{alternative}} {{variation of}} four-wave-mixing-based frequency combs {{is known as}} Kerr frequency comb. Here, a single laser is coupled into a microresonator (such as a microscopic glass disk that has whispering-gallery modes). This kind of structure naturally has a series of resonant modes with approximately equally spaced frequencies (similar to a <b>Fabry–Pérot</b> <b>interferometer).</b> Unfortunately the resonant modes are not exactly equally spaced due to dispersion. Nevertheless, the four-wave mixing effect above can create and stabilize a perfect frequency comb in such a structure. Basically, the system generates a perfect comb that overlaps the resonant modes as much as possible. In fact, nonlinear effects can shift the resonant modes to improve the overlap with the perfect comb even more. (The resonant mode frequencies depend on refractive index, which is altered by the optical Kerr effect.) ...|$|E

40|$|Two {{distinct}} {{types of}} magnetoresistance oscillations are observed in two electronic <b>Fabry-Perot</b> <b>interferometers</b> {{of different sizes}} in the integer quantum Hall regime. Measuring these oscillations {{as a function of}} magnetic field and gate voltages, we observe three signatures that distinguish the two types. The oscillations observed in a 2. 0 square micron device are understood to arise from the Coulomb blockade mechanism, and those observed in an 18 square micron device from the Aharonov-Bohm mechanism. This work clarifies, provides ways to distinguish, and demonstrates control over, these distinct physical origins of resistance oscillations seen in electronic <b>Fabry-Perot</b> <b>interferometers.</b> Comment: related papers at [URL]...|$|R
2500|$|The ALADIN instrument, {{essentially}} a direct detection lidar, {{consists of three}} major elements: a transmitter, a combined Mie and Rayleigh backscattering receiver assembly, and a Cassegrain telescope with a [...] diameter. The transmitter architecture {{is based on a}} 150 mJ diode-pumped frequency-tripled [...] operating in the ultraviolet at 355nm. The Mie receiver consists of a Fizeau spectrometer with a resolution of 100MHz (equivalent to 18m/s). The received backscatter signal produces a linear fringe whose position is directly linked to the wind velocity; the wind speed is determined by the fringe centroid position to better than a tenth of the resolution (1.8m/s). The Raleigh receiver employs a dual-filter <b>Fabry–Pérot</b> <b>interferometer</b> with a 2GHz resolution and 5GHz spacing. It analyzes the wings of the Rayleigh spectrum with a CCD; the etalon is split into two zones, which are imaged separately on the detector.|$|E
2500|$|The {{most common}} types of optical {{cavities}} consist of two facing plane (flat) or spherical mirrors. The simplest {{of these is}} the plane-parallel or Fabry–Pérot cavity, consisting of two opposing flat mirrors. While simple, this arrangement is rarely used in large-scale lasers due to the difficulty of alignment; the mirrors must be aligned parallel within a few seconds of arc, or [...] "walkoff" [...] of the intracavity beam will result in it spilling out of the sides of the cavity. However, this problem is much reduced for very short cavities with a small mirror separation distance (L < 1nbsp&cm). Plane-parallel resonators are therefore commonly used in microchip and microcavity lasers and semiconductor lasers. In these cases, rather than using separate mirrors, a reflective optical coating may be directly applied to the laser medium itself. The plane-parallel resonator is also the basis of the <b>Fabry–Pérot</b> <b>interferometer.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In October 2006, May re-registered for his PhD at Imperial College and {{submitted}} his thesis in August 2007 (one year earlier than he estimated {{it would take}} to complete). As well as writing up the previous work he had done, May had to review the work on zodiacal dust undertaken during the intervening 33 years, which included the discovery of the zodiacal dust bands by NASA's IRAS satellite. After a viva voce, the revised thesis (entitled A Survey of Radial Velocities in the Zodiacal Dust Cloud) was approved in September 2007, some 37 years after it had been commenced. He was able to submit his thesis only because of the minimal amount of research on the topic during the intervening years and has described the subject as one that became [...] "trendy" [...] again in the 2000s. His PhD investigated radial velocity using absorption spectroscopy and doppler spectroscopy of zodiacal light using a <b>Fabry–Pérot</b> <b>interferometer</b> based at the Teide Observatory in Tenerife.

50|$|Fig. 7 {{illustrates}} {{use of a}} Michelson interferometer as a tunable {{narrow band}} filter to create dopplergrams of the Sun's surface. When used as a tunable narrow band filter, Michelson interferometers exhibit a number of advantages and disadvantages when compared with competing technologies such as <b>Fabry-Pérot</b> <b>interferometers</b> or Lyot filters. Michelson interferometers have the largest field of view for a specified wavelength, and are relatively simple in operation, since tuning is via mechanical rotation of waveplates rather than via high voltage control of piezoelectric crystals or lithium niobate optical modulators as used in a Fabry-Pérot system. Compared with Lyot filters, which use birefringent elements, Michelson interferometers have a relatively low temperature sensitivity. On the negative side, Michelson interferometers have a relatively restricted wavelength range, and require use of prefilters which restrict transmittance. The reliability of Michelson interferometers has tended to favor their use in space applications, while the broad wavelength range and overall simplicity of <b>Fabry-Pérot</b> <b>interferometers</b> has favored their use in ground-based systems.|$|R
