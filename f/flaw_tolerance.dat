5000|$|Both hairy {{and smooth}} pads in {{arthropods}} act {{to maximize the}} amount of contact with a surface. The foot pads of flies are densely covered with flexible hair-like structures called setae, and some lizards and spiders use similar hairy pads to create adhesive effects. This indicates a favourable design for hairy pad adhesion. [...] Hairy pads can be classified as pulvillus, fossula spongiosa, and tenent hairs. Hairy attachment pads employed few other features, such as <b>flaw</b> <b>tolerance,</b> lower sensitivity to contamination and roughness. Hairy attachment systems are typical for evolutionary younger and successful insect groups, such as Coleoptera and Diptera. The density of hairs increases with increasing body weight. An increase of the attachment strength in hairy systems is realized by {{increasing the number of}} single contact points. [...] Protuberances on the hairy pads of Coleoptera, Dermaptera and Diptera belong to different types. Representatives of the first two lineages have socketed setae on their pads. [...] Setae can range in length from a few micrometers to several millimeters. [...] Dipteran outgrowths are acanthae which are single sclerotized protuberances originating from a single cell. The acanthae are hollow inside and some have pores under the terminal plate, which presumably deliver an adhesive secretion directly to the contact area. Hairy attachment pads of reduviid bugs, flies [...] and beetles [...] secrete fluid into the contact area. The secretion contains non-volatile, lipid-like substances, but in some species it is two-phasic emulsion presumably containing water-soluble and lipid-soluble fractions. [...] Adhesion strongly decreases as the volume of the secretion decreases, which indicates that a layer of pad secretion that covers the terminal plates is crucial for generating a strong attractive force. Data suggests that besides van der Waals and Coulomb forces flies rely on attractive capillary forces mediated by the pad secretion. At low humidity, adhesion strongly depends on the amount of liquid deposited on the surface, and therefore contact duration.|$|E

Recent {{critical analysis of}} this period has emphasized its difference from the preceding 'gay and ~lesbian' phase; queer self-identification is thought to represent an epistemic rupture or paradigm shift in the sexual landscape. Gay and lesbian identification is posited as an assimilationist venture, whereas queer indicates an open and radical opposition to 'straight' culture. Philip Derbyshire suggests that "rage rather than meek acceptance, rejection of a <b>flawed</b> <b>tolerance</b> rather than demands for integration" characterize the queer phase in the U. S. Queer identification, {{in addition to being}} posited as different from its forerunner, cites 'difference' itself as the self-proclaimed basis for the movement. Although queer difference is undeniable, in this thesis the author proposes that we might also examine the queer period in light of its similarity to the not-so-distant gay and lesbian past. In fact, the queer phase is better characterized as the latest, and by no means last, variation of the oldest survival strategy among lesbians and gays since the advent of the 'closet'.

This technical demonstrator tailboom {{was designed for}} use on a Bell 407 model {{as part of a}} collaboration program with Bombardier Inc., Composite Atlantic Ltd. and the National Research Council Canada (NRC). The tailboom cone consisted of a skin made from an AFP layup of carbon epoxy fiber tape combined to a hand layup made from fabric. The skin is then bonded to six hand layup frames. The fatigue test objectives were to validate the component to flaw tolerant safe life requirements and establish damage tolerance to light and medium caliber ballistic impacts. The test article, containing embedded flaws, impact damages, and representative repairs, was subjected to a full four lifetime fatigue test at NRC. All testing during this phase was conducted at 250 0 F 2 ̆ 018 hot-dry 2 ̆ 019 conditions to simulate operating temperatures seen in service. The test article successfully sustained four lifetimes of fatigue testing, followed by residual strength testing to both limit and ultimate loads.

40|$|<b>Flaw</b> <b>tolerance</b> of {{continuum}} and discrete mechanical systems: {{the roles}} of heterogeneity and nonlocality The assessment of {{the ability of a}} mechanical system to tolerate defects is a typical multi-scale problem where the property of <b>flaw</b> <b>tolerance</b> emerges from the nonlinear interactions between the material constituents at the different scales, a common feature of complex systems. In the present talk, a critical analysis of the factors influencing <b>flaw</b> <b>tolerance</b> of continuum and discrete mechanical systems is proposed. At the continuum level, it is shown by extensive finite element simulations that the material heterogeneity plays a fundamental role and that a suitably tailored hierarchical microstructure can effectively enhance the <b>flaw</b> <b>tolerance</b> of the system.

40|$|AbstractThe {{ability of}} {{materials}} to withstand defects like cracks, notches or generic geometric discontinuities, is usually indicated as <b>flaw</b> <b>tolerance,</b> {{and is a}} crucial aspect of the safety assessment of structural components. <b>Flaw</b> <b>tolerance</b> in soft materials can be substantially different from that in traditional ones. As a matter of fact, the capacity of highly deformable materials to undergo large deformations with a significant rearrangement of the molecular network at the miscroscale in highly stressed regions can enhance such an ability, leading to an erroneous underestimation of their safety level against defect-driven failure, if traditional methods of analysis are employed. In the present research work, the mechanics of highly deformable notched plates is considered from the fail-safety point-of-view.

In order to obtain homogenously dispersed composites, a rheological study was carried out by measuring the flow behavior in different conditions of solid content, amount of dispersant and shear stress. It has been found that, with the suitable conditions (80 wt% solids and 3 wt% deflocculant), a ceramic-metal homogeneously dispersed (Al 2 O 3 -Ti) composite can be obtained. After sintering, the composites were mechanically tested and the cermet showed an important improvement in the <b>flaw</b> <b>tolerance</b> and R-curve behavior when compared with the monolithic material.

40|$|Fine-grained and {{coarse-grained}} aluminas containing either equiaxed or elongated grain {{structures were}} fabricated from commercial-purity and high-purity alumina powders. Compared to the high-purity aluminas, the commercial-purity aluminas having a coarse grain size and elongated grain structures exhibited significantly more pronounced <b>flaw</b> <b>tolerance</b> and T-curve behavior. T-curve behavior determined from indentation strength tests suggested {{that only the}} coarse- grained, elongated-grain alumina had a T-curve sufficient to cause stable crack extension prior to failure, a requirement for any observable improvement in reliability. In the high-purity aluminas {{as well as the}} fine-grained commercial-purity aluminas, however, it is likely that little or no stable extension occurs prior failure, suggesting that strength in these materials is dependent on the critical flaw size. Strength tests on polished specimens showed the commercial-purity aluminas had a lower means strength than the high- purity aluminas and the coarse-grained aluminas exhibited a lower mean strength compared to the fine-grained aluminas. An analysis of the mean strength versus grain size revealed that the differences in critical flaw size alone could not account for the differences in mean strength. Instead, a combination of changes in flaw size as well as T-curve behavior were shown to be responsible for the differences in strength and <b>flaw</b> <b>tolerance.</b> T-curve behavior was also found to have a profound influence on the strength variability of alumina. For example, the Weibull modulus for the coarse-grained, commercial- purity alumina was almost twice that of the fine-grained, high-purity material.

We explore fracture in nanomaterials using nanocrystalline Pt nanocylinders with prefabricated surface notches created using a “paused” electroplating method. In situ scanning electron microscopy (SEM) tension tests demonstrate that the majority of these samples failed at the notches, but that tensile failure strength is independent of whether failure occurred at or away from the flaw. Molecular dynamics simulations verify these findings and show that local plasticity is able to reduce stress concentration ahead of the notch to levels comparable with the strengths of microstructural features (e. g., grain boundaries).

The notch root stress is made the same between specimens of different notch radius by scaling the applied load. As a result, the conventional fatigue analysis that calculates a fatigue usage factor from a fatigue curve based on stress at a point gives identical results for all specimens.

For all pulling rates, hydrided materials showed typical S curve behavior with an increase in lower shelf, upper shelf and transition temperature with pulling rate. The number of axial splits on fracture surfaces increased with an increase in the pulling rate and a decrease in temperature and fracture toughness was found to decrease with an increase in the number of axial splits.

Independent {{of the type of}} defect, a common dependence of the critical fracture strength on the square root of half defect size is observed. Furthermore, the results suggest the applicability of the Griffith relation at length scales of several nanometers. This observation is not consistent with simulations pointing to the existence of a <b>flaw</b> <b>tolerance</b> for defects with nanometer size. According to simulations for quasi-static growth of pre-existing cracks, the atomic mechanism may also consist of an alternating sequence of bond-breaking and bond-rotation steps with a straight extension of the crack path. Independent of the exact atomic failure mechanism brittle fracture of graphene is generally assumed at low temperatures...|$|E
