25|$|Yang Bailao, Xi'er's father, {{has been}} away {{to avoid the}} <b>debt</b> <b>collector</b> from the despotic landlord, Huang Shiren. He returns home at dusk, with no gift other than a red ribbon to tie to the hair of Xi'er for the festivity of the holiday.|$|E

They kill Yang Bailao, and take away Xi'er by force as his concubine. Dachun and other villagers come on the scene. Dachun wants to go to the landlord's residence to fight for justice but is stopped by Zhao Dashu (Uncle Zhao) who, instead, instruct Dachun and other young people to join the Eighth Route Army.|$|E
25|$|Jacob Rosenzweig (September 1876 – October 4, 1947) was an American gambler and underworld {{figure in}} New York City. He {{was one of}} several star {{witnesses}} in the Becker-Rosenthal trial, among these being fellow gamblers Bridgie Webber, Harry Vallon, and Sam Schepps. Rose's testimony was the most damaging because he directly implicated Becker in arranging the murder of Herman Rosenthal. As Becker's <b>debt</b> <b>collector,</b> Rose confessed to hiring the Lenox Avenue Gang, providing the getaway car. He testified he did it all on the orders of Charles Becker.|$|E
40|$|I {{examine the}} role of {{third-party}} <b>debt</b> <b>collectors</b> in consumer credit markets. Using law enforcement as an instrument {{for the number of}} <b>debt</b> <b>collectors,</b> I find that higher density of <b>debt</b> <b>collectors</b> increases the supply of unsecured credit. A one-percent change in the number of <b>debt</b> <b>collectors</b> per capita leads to a 0. 49 % change in the average credit card balance and a 1. 32 % change in the average balance on non-credit card unsecured loans. There is also some evidence that creditors substitute unsecured credit for secured credit when the number of <b>debt</b> <b>collectors</b> increases. Higher density of <b>debt</b> <b>collectors</b> improves recoveries, which enables lenders to extend more credit. Finally, creditors charge higher interest rates and lend to a larger pool of borrowers when the density of <b>debt</b> <b>collectors</b> increases, presumably because better collections enable them to extend credit to riskier applicants...|$|R
40|$|I examine {{contract}} {{enforcement in}} consumer credit markets {{by studying the}} role of third-party <b>debt</b> <b>collectors.</b> In order to identify the effect of <b>debt</b> <b>collectors</b> on credit supply, I construct a state-level index of the tightness of debt collection laws. I find that stricter regulations of third-party <b>debt</b> <b>collectors</b> {{are associated with a}} lower number of third-party <b>debt</b> <b>collectors</b> per capita and with fewer openings of revolving lines of credit. One additional restriction on debt collection activity reduces the number of <b>debt</b> <b>collectors</b> per capita by 15. 9 % of the sample mean and lowers the number of new revolving lines of credit by 2. 2 % of the sample mean. At the same time, regulations of third-party <b>debt</b> <b>collectors</b> do not affect secured consumer credit, which is consistent with the fact that <b>debt</b> <b>collectors</b> are used to enforce unsecured debt contracts. Stricter regulations of <b>debt</b> <b>collectors</b> decrease credit card recovery rates (by 9 % of the sample mean for each additional restriction on debt collection activity), which appears to be the transmission mechanism by which <b>debt</b> <b>collectors</b> affect credit supply. The effect of debt collection laws is significant even when average credit scores are controlled for, meaning that consumer credit risk is not the only driver of credit access. My results can help explain the existence of a large market for unsecured consumer credit and shed light on contract enforcement in this market...|$|R

25|$|Gorsuch {{wrote his}} first U.S. Supreme Court {{decision}} for a unanimous court in Henson v. Santander Consumer USA Inc., 582 U.S. ___ (2017). Gorsuch and the Court ruled against the borrowers, holding that Santander {{in this case}} is not a <b>debt</b> <b>collector</b> under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act since they purchased the original defaulted car loans from CitiFinancial for pennies on the dollar, making Santander the owner of the debts and not merely an agent. When the act was enacted, regulations were put on institutions that collected other companies' debts, but the act left unaddressed businesses collecting their own debts.|$|E
25|$|On June 16, 1937, he {{graduated}} from Fordham University. The economic outlook of the Great Depression offered him few opportunities for a career. For {{the next two years}} he showed no discernible career path or ambition. He tried his hand at semi-professional football with the Wilmington Clippers of the American Association and as a <b>debt</b> <b>collector</b> but those efforts proved to be failures very quickly. With his father's strong support, he enrolled in Fordham Law school in September 1938. Although he did not fail any classes, he believed his grades were so poor that he dropped out after one semester. Later in life, he would explain to others that he was close to graduating, but his desire to start and support a family forced him to leave law school and get a job. He would also then join the Brooklyn Eagles.|$|E
500|$|In 1880 Bottomley married Eliza Norton, the {{daughter}} of a <b>debt</b> <b>collector.</b> Bottomley's biographers have tended to regard this early, unambitious marriage as a mistake on his part; she was not equipped, intellectually or socially, to help him advance in the world. In the same year, Bottomley left his job to become a full-time shorthand writer for Walpole's, a firm that provided recording and transcription services for the law courts. His competence impressed his employers sufficiently for them, in 1883, to offer him a partnership, and the firm became Walpole and Bottomley. As Bottomley emerged from adolescence to maturity he began to show signs of the characteristics that would be much in evidence in his later life: greed for fleshly pleasures, a thirst for fame, spontaneous generosity, combined with a charm that, according to his biographer Julian Symons, could [...] "tempt the banknotes out of men's pockets".|$|E

Reiakvam accepts the money, believing it is a gift, and unwittingly becomes a character in his own movie.|$|R

500|$|Following his graduation, Anderson {{returned}} to his alma mater and began serving {{as an assistant coach}} at Lynn English High School under Buzzy Barton. He could not join a professional team because of family problems and worked as a <b>debt</b> <b>collector</b> to support his family. Instead, Anderson competed in Boston Weekend League and became a prominent streetball player in the area. In August 2007, Anderson drew the attention of Steve Bucknall, head coach of the PAWS London Capital of the British Basketball League (BBL), when he took part in a local summer basketball tournament known as the Hoganz Basketball Classic. At the event, Anderson scored 51 points against Detroit Pistons player Will Blalock and led his Lynn-based team to the championship by hitting a buzzer-beating three-pointer in the finals. Later in the month, Anderson signed his first professional contract with London Capital for the team's inaugural season. He commented on his move to the new country, [...] "England was by far the worst situation I ever been in since playing overseas." [...] Anderson also experienced culture shock while living there. In his time with London Capital, he most notably scored 32 points in a single game.|$|E
2500|$|One of Foley's {{earliest}} acting roles was in 1996. Shortly {{before he}} left for Stamford, Foley appeared in Atlanta filmmakers Barry Norman and Michael Williams' short subject Deadbeats as [...] "Bird", an armed robber turned <b>debt</b> <b>collector.</b> One of Foley's first TV guest appearances was as a wrestler on USA Network's short-lived action-comedy G vs E. He also featured prominently in the documentary Beyond the Mat. Foley, as Mankind, also starred in a series of commercials for Chef Boyardee's beef ravioli. He appeared in the Insane Clown Posse vehicle Big Money Hustlas as Cactus Sac, which was basically the same character as his Cactus Jack persona.|$|E
2500|$|Upon {{reaching}} Baltimore, Carter {{received the}} devastating news {{that his son}} Robert Bladen had died in London, nine days after being assaulted by a city sheriff trying to collect gambling debts. Nonetheless, Carter joined the congregation of James Jones Wilmer, an Episcopalian minister receptive to Swedenborg's views, bought a small house on Green Street, and began attending many religious meetings. Before leaving Nomony Hall, Carter locked his books and papers in the library, and gave the only key not to his son J.T., but to a wandering Baptist preacher named Benjamin Dawson. Dawson proved a corrupt <b>debt</b> <b>collector,</b> but diligent abolitionist, duly securing legal papers from Carter in Baltimore and filing them in Westmoreland [...] and other counties to free slaves. Carter made provision for his relatives, allocating them land, but not the slaves who were {{the subject of the}} Deed of Gift. On July 26, 1797, upon learning from Dawson that attorney John Wickham doubted the legal validity of the power of attorney which allowed Dawson to file further manumission papers, Carter executed an agreement selling Dawson his remaining slaves for the nominal sum of a dollar, which Dawson duly filed with the Westmoreland clerk, despite a beating by Carter's son-in-law Spencer Ball.|$|E

6000|$|As to the debt, James owed Gowrie a large sum, with {{accumulated}} interest, for {{expenses incurred}} by Gowrie’s father, when Lord Treasurer of Scotland (1583–1584).
