5|$|Christian pilgrim and archdeacon Theodosius (518–520) in his De situ terrae sanctae {{mentions}} that 'close to Jacob's Well are {{the remains of}} Joseph the Holy'. The Madaba Mosaic Map (6th century) designates a site somewhat problematically with the legend – 'Joseph's' (τὸ τοῦ Ὶωσήφ) – where the usual adjective 'holy' (hagios) accompanying mentions of saints and their shrines <b>is</b> <b>lacking.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 2014, the Russian Military Historical Society {{stated that}} Russian troops {{and their allies}} {{defeated}} the German knights in the Battle of Grunwald, though evidence that the Grand Duchy of Moscow was involved with this battle <b>is</b> <b>lacking.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{research}} following Hitler's death, {{a variety}} of claims have been made about Hitler's sexual orientation: that he was gay, bisexual, or asexual. Conclusive evidence <b>is</b> <b>lacking,</b> but most historians believe he was heterosexual. There {{is at least one}} claim that Hitler had an illegitimate child (named Jean-Marie Loret) with one of his lovers. Mainstream historians, such as Ian Kershaw, dismiss this as unlikely or impossible.|$|E

5|$|Sang Pencerah, {{produced}} {{to coincide}} with Muhammadiyah's centenary, was announced in November 2009. It {{was meant to be}} historically accurate, with much of the Rp. 12 billion (US$ 1.3 million) budget paying for period costumes and sets. However, as documentation on the early years of Dahlan's life <b>is</b> <b>lacking,</b> those scenes were fictionalised. Sang Pencerah marks the feature film debut of Ihsan Tarore and Giring Ganesha.|$|E
5|$|Several {{observational}} {{studies and}} randomized, controlled trials found metformin {{to be as}} effective and safe as insulin {{for the management of}} gestational diabetes. Nonetheless, several concerns were raised and evidence on the long-term safety of metformin for both mother and child <b>is</b> <b>lacking.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{available}} evidence {{does not indicate}} that circumcision provides HIV protection for heterosexual women. Data <b>is</b> <b>lacking</b> regarding the effect circumcision may have on the transmission rate of men who engage in anal sex with a female partner.

5|$|The quagga {{catshark}} is harmless {{and is not}} {{utilized by}} humans. It is caught incidentally by demersal fisheries in bottom trawls and potentially other gear; such fishing activity is very intense in Indian and Somalian waters, though specific data on this species <b>is</b> <b>lacking.</b> Therefore, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed it as Data Deficient.|$|E
5|$|What {{is perhaps}} more {{surprising}} is that Prince of Wales returned to British ownership. There is an entry {{for her in}} the supplemental (i.e., late addition) pages for the 1797 volume. One suspects that the Royal Navy recaptured her in the West Indies, but so far evidence for the conjecture <b>is</b> <b>lacking.</b>|$|E
5|$|When Nicholas {{returned}} to Scotland, and {{the exact nature}} of his activities over the next few years, remain unclear matters.

5|$|Although {{evidence}} <b>is</b> <b>lacking,</b> modern {{sea turtles}} probably descended {{from a single}} common ancestor during the Cretaceous period. Like all other sea turtles except the leatherback, loggerheads {{are members of the}} ancient family Cheloniidae, and appeared about 40 million years ago. Of the six species of living Cheloniidae, loggerheads are more closely related to the Kemp's ridley sea turtle, olive ridley sea turtle, and the hawksbill turtle than they are to the flatback turtle and the green turtle.|$|E
5|$|As with written records, {{the archaeological}} {{evidence}} for this period is not extensive, {{and knowledge of the}} daily lives of the population <b>is</b> <b>lacking.</b> It is known that the Hebrides were taxed using the Ounceland system and evidence from Bornais suggests that settlers there may have been more prosperous than families of a similar status in the Northern Isles, possibly owing to a more relaxed political regime. Latterly, the Hebrides sent eight representatives from Lewis, Harris and Skye and another eight from the southern Hebrides to the Tynwald parliament on Man.|$|E
5|$|At {{the head}} of Macedonia's {{government}} was the king (basileus). From at least the reign of PhilipII, the king was assisted by the royal pages (basilikoi paides), bodyguards (somatophylakes), companions (hetairoi), friends (philoi), an assembly that included members of the military, and (during the Hellenistic period) magistrates. Evidence <b>is</b> <b>lacking</b> regarding {{the extent to which}} each of these groups shared authority with the king or if their existence had a basis in a formal constitutional framework. Before the reign of PhilipII, the only institution supported by textual evidence is the monarchy.|$|E

5|$|Domesticated {{horses were}} present in Bronze Age Britain from around 2000BC. Bronze Age horse trappings {{including}} snaffle bits have been found which were used in harnessing horses to vehicles; Bronze Age cart wheels have been found at Flag Fen and Blair Drummond, the latter dating from around 1255–815BC, though these may have belonged to vehicles pulled by oxen. Early Bronze Age evidence for horses being ridden <b>is</b> <b>lacking,</b> though bareback riding may have involved materials which have not survived or have not been found; but horses were ridden in battle in Britain by the late Bronze Age. Domesticated ponies were on Dartmoor by around 1500BC.|$|E
5|$|Raised {{intracranial}} pressure, if severe or threatening vision, {{may require}} therapeutic lumbar puncture (removal of excessive cerebrospinal fluid), medication (acetazolamide), or neurosurgical treatment (optic nerve sheath fenestration or shunting). In certain situations, anticonvulsants {{may be used}} to try to prevent seizures. These situations include focal neurological problems (e.g. inability to move a limb) and focal changes of the brain tissue on CT or MRI scan. Evidence to support or refute the use of antiepileptic drugs as a preventive measure, however, <b>is</b> <b>lacking.</b>|$|E
5|$|Red wares were {{imported}} from southeastern Utah until , when the Chacoans switched to orange ware products originating from northeastern Arizona, near Kayenta. After 1000, almost no pottery {{was fired in}} the canyon, but was instead produced in outlying communities with access to {{a steady supply of}} firewood for their kilns. During the period from 1030 to 1100, significantly more pottery was imported to the canyon than before. The extensive Puebloan trade network that dispersed stoneware products throughout the region suggests that, although evidence of large-scale production <b>is</b> <b>lacking,</b> proficient local artisans supplied distant communities as well as their own.|$|E

5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has {{assessed}} the Caribbean reef shark as Near Threatened; its population has declined off Belize and Cuba from overfishing and exploitation continues in other regions. They are also {{threatened by the}} degradation and destruction of their coral reef habitat. Commercial fishing for this species is prohibited in United States waters. They are protected in the Bahamas due to their significance to ecotourism, {{as well as in}} a number of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) off Brazil and elsewhere. However, enforcement against illegal fishing <b>is</b> <b>lacking</b> in some of these reserves, and many areas in which this species is abundant are not protected.|$|E
5|$|Tyrannosaurus {{may have}} also {{inhabited}} Mexico's Lomas Coloradas formation in Sonora. Though skeletal evidence <b>is</b> <b>lacking,</b> six shed and broken teeth from the fossil bed have been thoroughly compared with other theropod genera and appear to be identical to those of Tyrannosaurus. If true, the evidence indicates the range of Tyrannosaurus was possibly more extensive than previously believed. It is possible that tyrannosaurs were originally Asian species, migrating to North America {{before the end of}} the Cretaceous period.|$|E
5|$|Zygoballus sexpunctatus {{is similar}} in {{appearance}} to Zygoballus rufipes, with whom its range overlaps. The male can be distinguished from Z.rufipes by the large spot of white scales {{at the beginning of}} the thoracic slope (which <b>is</b> <b>lacking</b> in Z. rufipes), and by the longitudinal division present on the bulb of the pedipalp (Z. rufipes has a transverse division). The female can best be distinguished by the form of the epigyne (the external genital structure).|$|E
