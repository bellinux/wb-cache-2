25|$|On the {{occasion}} of my 27th birthday I decided to do a tape that chronicled my passage through time. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> clumsy, tripping, dropping, falling with alarming regularity. This tape accepts {{the extent of the}} consequences.|$|E
25|$|I {{have always}} urged {{fighting}} wars and other contentions with might and main till overwhelming victory and then extending {{the hand of}} friendship to the vanquished. Thus <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> against the Pacifists during the quarrel and the Jingoist at its close...I thought we should have conquered the Irish then given them Home Rule...and that after smashing the General Strike we should have met the grievances of the miners.|$|E

25|$|My son! <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> a {{careless}} and injudicious mother to you, and I {{am about to}} propose a most imprudent step. You are now of age, and it's high time you {{began to think of}} taking a wife. Several old and hideous princesses who are enormously poor have proposed for your hand, and I think it high time you began to think of making one of them unhappy.|$|E
25|$|I {{think it}} is up to the states to work out their social {{problems}} if possible, and while <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> interested in seeing that the Negro has a square deal, I have never dissipated my strength against the particular stone wall of segregation. I believe that wall will crumble when the Negro has brought himself to a high educational and economic status…. Moreover, while there are no segregation laws in the North, there is segregation in fact and we might as well recognize this.|$|E
500|$|... "The {{hundreds}} of interviews I have conducted {{over the past}} 40 years have been utilised. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> a hoarder of clippings in addition to collecting magazines, fanzines, newspapers and books. I'll never tire of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I was mighty glad to {{hear him}} say this, for <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> nervous when <b>I</b> was {{cruising}} off Porto Rico. Do you know, miss, that those waters are the very deepest in the whole world?" ...|$|R
60|$|While {{this terrible}} {{pounding}} {{was going on}} I heard various reports of its effect upon my neighbors. One of them, an agriculturist, with whom <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> on the best of terms, came with a clouded brow.|$|R
60|$|Before I could {{thank her}} she hastened to the piano. The chair near it, which <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> {{accustomed}} to occupy, stood empty. She struck a few chords--then glanced round at me--then looked back again at her music.|$|R
500|$|... "I've {{been living}} in Chicago and {{spending}} a lot of time there, and that's where R. Kelly hails from. I was working on Artpop and I wrote [...] on tour. It was about my obsession with the way people view me. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> an R. Kelly fan and actually it is like an epic pastime in the Haus of Gaga that we just get fucked up and play R. Kelly. This is a real R song and I [...] have to call the king of R and I need his blessing.' It was a mutual love." ...|$|E
500|$|Nolan's most {{prominent}} recurring theme {{is the concept}} of time. The director has identified that all of his films [...] "have had some odd relationship with time, usually in just a structural sense, in that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> interested in the subjectivity of time." [...] Writing for Film Philosophy, Emma Bell points out that the characters in Inception do not literally time-travel, [...] "rather they escape time by being stricken in it – building the delusion that time has not passed, and is not passing now. They feel time grievously: willingly and knowingly destroying their experience by creating multiple simultaneous existences." ...|$|E
500|$|Bana {{was born}} in Melbourne, Victoria. His father, Ivan, was Croatian {{and worked as a}} {{logistics}} manager for Caterpillar, Inc., and his mother, Eleanor, was a hairdresser, originally from near Mannheim in Germany. He has one older brother, Anthony. Bana grew up in Melbourne's Tullamarine, a suburban area on the northern edge of the city, near Melbourne's international airport, and attended Penleigh and Essendon Grammar School. In a cover story for The Mail on Sunday, he told author Antonella Gambotto-Burke that his family had suffered from racist taunts, and that it had distressed him. [...] "Wog is such a terrible word," [...] he said. He has stated: [...] "I have always been proud of my origin, which had a big influence on my upbringing. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> in the company of people of European origin".|$|E
6000|$|... "Not WILL be yours," [...] Herminia {{corrected}} in that silvery {{voice of}} hers. [...] "AM yours already, Alan. I somehow {{feel as if}} <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> yours. <b>I</b> am yours this moment. You may do what you would with me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, you cast an {{evil eye}} on my play," [...] said Gwendolen, with a turn {{of her head}} and a smile. [...] "I began to lose as soon as you came to look on. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> winning till then." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Penfold smiled. [...] "It {{would have}} been better for me, perhaps, if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> so determined, Withers. At any rate <b>I</b> mean to <b>have</b> my own way in this matter. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> not had a real holiday for years." ...|$|R
500|$|Truman's brief vice-presidency was {{relatively}} uneventful. On April 10, 1945, Truman cast his only tie-breaking vote as President of the Senate, against a Robert A. Taft {{amendment that would}} have blocked the postwar delivery of Lend-Lease Act items contracted for during the war. Roosevelt rarely contacted him, even to inform him of major decisions; the President and Vice President met alone together only twice during their time in office. In {{one of his first}} acts as vice president, Truman created some controversy when he attended the disgraced Pendergast's funeral. He brushed aside the criticism, saying simply, [...] "He was always my friend and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> his." [...] He had rarely discussed world affairs or domestic politics with Roosevelt; he was uninformed about major initiatives relating to the war and the top-secret Manhattan Project, which was about to test the world's first atomic bomb. He was also photographed with actress Lauren Bacall sitting atop the piano at the National Press Club as he played for soldiers.|$|E
500|$|During this period, Hershey {{changed her}} stage name to [...] "Seagull". In 1979, a blunt {{newspaper}} article from the Knight News Service referenced {{this period of}} her life, saying of her acting career that [...] "it {{looked as if she}} blew it." [...] The article referred to Hershey as a [...] "kook" [...] and stated that she was frequently [...] "high on something." [...] In addition to that criticism, she had been ostracized for breast-feeding her son during an appearance on The Dick Cavett Show, and for breast-feeding him beyond the age of two years. She said that this period of her life hurt her career; [...] "Producers wouldn't see me because I had a reputation for using drugs and being undependable. I never used drugs at all and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> serious about my acting career." [...] After splitting up with Carradine, she changed her stage name back to [...] "Hershey", explaining that she had told the story of why she adopted the name [...] "Seagull" [...] so many times that it had lost its meaning.|$|E
500|$|While {{the first}} book was being released, Tripathi started work on {{the second part of}} the trilogy, then titled The Naga Secret. Tripathi wanted to start the story from exactly where he ended in {{the first book}}, with Sati's fate being revealed. He also wanted to expand the {{geography}} of the story, allowing the characters to travel far East of India and also far South to the land of the Nagas, an ancient empire that existed more than five thousand years ago and was filled with eternal wars and the legend of a blue-throated god who would save the world. In an interview with Mumbai Mirror in July 2011, he clarified that it was difficult for him to do research about the geographical situations of India in 4000 BC in just one year, so he relied on his own knowledge and that of his relatives. [...] "I was an atheist till eight years ago, but <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> surrounded by relatives with immense faith, so scriptures are something I have inadvertently grown up with and learned", he added. The mythological and the technical aspects included in the story also came from Tripathi's habit of reading storybooks on history and ancient technology; he was helped by his father, who is a scientist. Tripathi quit his job as a banker while writing the book, dedicating his whole time to the book.|$|E

I puzzled over it, {{even at that}} time, excited though <b>I</b> <b>was.</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> told that only low, wicked people ever used the word [...] "damn," [...] and I tried to reconcile things, and failed.) ...|$|R

6000|$|... "'Poor Mr. Coon!' I cried, and I felt mighty sorry, for Bobby and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> good friends, though I {{must admit}} that he has some habits of which I don't approve. 'Do {{you know how he}} {{happened}} to play in such hard luck, Mr. Crow?' ...|$|R
500|$|Later that year, Górecki {{learned of}} an {{inscription}} scrawled {{on the wall}} of a cell in a German Gestapo prison in the town of Zakopane, which lies {{at the foot of the}} Tatra mountains in southern Poland. The words were those of 18-year-old Helena Wanda Błażusiakówna, a highland woman incarcerated on 25 September 1944. It read O Mamo, nie placz, nie. Niebios Przeczysta Królowo, Ty zawsze wspieraj mnie (Oh Mamma do not cry, no. [...] Immaculate Queen of Heaven, you support me always). The composer recalled, [...] "I have to admit that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> irritated by grand words, by calls for revenge. Perhaps in the face of death I would shout out in this way. But the sentence I found is different, almost an apology or explanation for having got herself into such trouble; she is seeking comfort and support in simple, short but meaningful words". He later explained, [...] "In prison, the whole wall was covered with inscriptions screaming out loud: 'I'm innocent', 'Murderers', 'Executioners', 'Free me', 'You have to save me'—it was all so loud, so banal. Adults were writing this, while here it is an eighteen-year-old girl, almost a child. And she is so different. She does not despair, does not cry, does not scream for revenge. She does not think about herself; whether she deserves her fate or not. Instead, she only thinks about her mother: because it is her mother who will experience true despair. This inscription was something extraordinary. And it really fascinated me." ...|$|E

[...] "I hate my beauty. <b>I</b> wish <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> as {{brown and}} plain as the brownest and plainest {{girl at the}} fishing village over there.

6000|$|... "It was {{the devil}} {{got hold of}} me, my Lord. Up to that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> square,--square as a die! I got to think that your Lordship was upsetting.

60|$|Several {{months after}} <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{returned}} home from my last visit, the first of March, 1886, I think, I received a telegram from him asking {{me to come to}} him at once. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> his favorite among the younger generation of Carters and so I hastened to comply with his demand.|$|R
2500|$|Herbert Hutner (November 5, 1962– March 3, 1966; divorced) [...] "Herbert {{took away}} my will to work. With his {{kindness}} and generosity, he almost annihilated my drive. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> {{the kind of}} woman who could never be satisfied by money— only excitement and achievement." ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> a pacifist, i.e. I have {{declined}} to recognize brute force {{as a means for}} the solution of international conflicts. Nevertheless, it is, in my opinion, not reasonable to cling to that principle unconditionally. [...] An exception has necessarily to be made if a hostile power threatens wholesale destruction of one's own group.|$|E

5000|$|Before Kemp left Arkansas, he {{discovered}} pulp fiction. As Kemp once wrote, [...] "There {{were a number}} of magazines that struck my fancy for different reasons, among them were titles like Planet Stories, Weird Tales, Spicy Mystery Stories, etc. It was probably my emerging pubescence tilting me toward the spicy parts, but <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> easy to tilt." ...|$|R
5000|$|Bexley {{was born}} on March 10, 1910 in either Jamestown, Virginia or Detroit, Michigan to the late Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Bexley.
