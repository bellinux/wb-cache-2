5|$|At Brooklyn, {{still an}} {{independent}} city from New York, houses were dismantled and uprooted trees blocked streets. Damage was widespread {{throughout the area}} and flood waters reached waist-high levels. The storm was the most severe in years at Jersey City, New Jersey, {{despite the fact that}} its damage was moderate. Trees were blown down and cellars <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>water</b> there and in nearby areas, such as Hoboken.|$|E
5|$|Raised bogs {{are most}} common in the Shannon basin. They formed when {{depressions}} left behind after the ice age <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>water</b> to form lakes. Debris from reeds in these lakes formed a layer {{at the bottom of}} the water. This eventually choked the lakes and raised above the surface, forming raised bogs.|$|E
5|$|Aboriginal people, {{particularly}} the Nyoongar and Yamatji, placed the flower spike in a paperbark-lined hole <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>water</b> {{to make a}} sweet drink. Both this species and B.aemula have been credited with the inspiration behind May Gibbs' Big Bad Banksia Men; this species was familiar to Gibbs in her childhood and likely gave her the initial inspiration, although the depictions resemble the latter species. Artist Marianne North produced a highly regarded painting of B.attenuata during her stay in Australia in 1880–1881.|$|E

5|$|Between 1954 and 1962, {{most of the}} {{buildings}} that had been constructed around the tower over the years, including the parliamentary legal offices, a stable, a row of houses and the Prime Minister's chauffeur's house, were demolished, and a new garden, College Green, was laid out beside the tower, {{on top of an}} underground parking lot. The medieval moat was re-excavated in 1956, and <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>water</b> between 1963 and the 1990s, when its poor water quality led to its being drained and lined with gravel.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{proceeded}} quickly, but disaster almost struck {{when the}} aqueduct was first <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>water</b> {{and one of}} its three arches began to buckle under the weight. Remedial work took several months, but the aqueduct was still opened to traffic only 15 months after the enabling Act of Parliament had been passed, on 17 July 1761. It remained in use for more than 100 years, until the construction of the Manchester Ship Canal necessitated its demolition in 1893, replaced by the Barton Swing Aqueduct.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, the National Endowment for the Arts {{committed}} $250,000 to the Park District for {{the conservation}} and restoration of the reflecting pool. In 2004, the University of Chicago contributed $100,000 and the Park District Board $845,000 to repair the pool and its water circulation system. This work {{was carried out in}} the summer of 2005 at a slightly reduced budget, and the fountain was <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>water</b> {{for the first time in}} over fifty years.|$|E

5|$|In 2009, {{the lake}} began being <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>water</b> {{provided}} by the Inland Feeder after nearly two years without a source. The water replenished much of what was lost after drought conditions required the MWD {{to tap into the}} lake. Water from the Colorado River Aqueduct is not being used due to the threat of the Quagga mussel, an invasive species that has already contaminated other Southern California lakes served by the aqueduct.|$|E
5|$|In early 1991, two of Hollywood's largest sound stages (Stage 16 at Warner Bros. and Stage 12 at Universal Studios) {{were being}} {{prepared}} for the filming of Batman Returns. Filming started in June 1991. Stage 16 held Gotham Plaza, based on Rockefeller Center. Universal's Stage 12 housed Penguin's underground lair. A half-a-million gallon tank <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>water</b> was used. Burton {{wanted to make sure}} that the penguins felt comfortable. Eight other locations on the Warner Bros. lot were used; over 50% of their property was occupied by Gotham City sets.|$|E
5|$|Other {{volcanic}} events elsewhere {{interacted with}} groundwater and magma creating numerous pit craters. Many of these pit craters have been <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>water</b> creating several crater lakes. In some places glacial till and fluvial sands and gravels are maintained under the several lava flows {{that form the}} volcanic field. Paleosols are found, but are rare. Glaciation has left a thick blanket of till over {{nearly all of the}} volcanic deposits and therefore outcrop is largely limited to cliffforming exposures in several valleys.|$|E

5|$|The {{first four}} Saturn I test flights were {{launched}} from LC-34, with only live first stages, carrying dummy upper stages <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>water.</b> The first flight {{with a live}} S-IV was launched from LC-37. This was followed by five launches of boilerplate CSMs (designated AS-101 through AS-105) into orbit in 1964 and 1965. The last three of these further supported the Apollo program by also carrying Pegasus satellites, which verified {{the safety of the}} translunar environment by measuring the frequency and severity of micrometeorite impacts.|$|E
5|$|The lakes of the BWCAW {{are located}} in {{depressions}} formed by differential erosion of the tilted layers of the Canadian Shield. For the past two million years, massive sheets of ice have repeatedly scoured the landscape. The last glacial period ended with the retreat of the Laurentide Ice Sheet from the Boundary Waters about 17,000 years ago. The resulting depressions in the landscape later <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>water,</b> becoming the lakes of today.|$|E
5|$|Westhay Moor forms {{part of the}} Somerset Levels and Moors {{which is}} {{important}} for its grazing and ditch system, and is crossed by the River Brue and Galton's Canal. Over much of the moor, the water table is high throughout the year with extensive winter flooding occurring regularly. The level of the water tables can be artificially lowered during active working of the peat excavations, but {{for much of the}} year these are often <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>water.</b>|$|E

5|$|Selected {{as one of}} the Mercury Seven astronauts, Grissom was {{the pilot}} of the second American {{suborbital}} flight, in the Liberty Bell 7. The hatch of the craft blew off and <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>water,</b> causing it to sink {{to the bottom of the}} ocean. His next flight was in the Project Gemini Program in a craft named the Molly Brown, which was a successful mission. He was killed along with fellow astronauts Ed White and Roger Chaffee during a pre-launch test for the Apollo 1 mission at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station (then known as Cape Kennedy), Florida. He was the first of the Mercury Seven to die. He was a recipient of the Distinguished Flying Cross and, posthumously, the Congressional Space Medal of Honor.|$|E
5|$|The Swedish Nuclear Fuel and Waste Management Company. (Svensk Kärnbränslehantering AB, {{known as}} SKB) {{was created in}} 1980 and is {{responsible}} for final disposal of nuclear waste there. This includes operation of a monitored retrievable storage facility, the Central Interim Storage Facility for Spent Nuclear Fuel at Oskarshamn, about 150 miles south of Stockholm on the Baltic coast; transportation of spent fuel; and construction of a permanent repository. Swedish utilities store spent fuel at the reactor site for one year before transporting it to the facility at Oskarshamn, {{where it will be}} stored in excavated caverns <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>water</b> for about 30 years before removal to a permanent repository.|$|E
5|$|The bucket bong is {{made out}} of two {{container}}s, with the larger, open top container <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>water.</b> The smaller has an attached bowl and open bottom, and the smaller is placed into the larger. Once the bowl is lit, the operator must move the small container up, causing a pressure difference. Smoke slowly fills the small jar until the user removes the bowl and inhales the contents. A waterfall bong is made up of only one container. The container must have a bowl and a small hole near the base so the water can drain easily. As the water flows out of the container, air is forced through the bowl and causes the substance to burn and accumulate smoke in the bong.|$|E

5|$|This {{increase}} in permeability primarily affects transport of ions and other hydrated species, {{indicating that the}} mechanism {{is the creation of}} nm-scale water-filled holes in the membrane. Although electroporation and dielectric breakdown both result from application of an electric field, the mechanisms involved are fundamentally different. In dielectric breakdown the barrier material is ionized, creating a conductive pathway. The material alteration is thus chemical in nature. In contrast, during electroporation the lipid molecules are not chemically altered but simply shift position, opening up a pore that acts as the conductive pathway through the bilayer as it is <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>water.</b>|$|E
5|$|At the Horn Island {{lighthouse}}, {{the lighthouse}} keeper was killed {{along with his}} wife and daughter due to the hurricane. In addition to the death of the three at the lighthouse, it was noted that the schooner Daisy had been dismantled there, with one person killed. A person who was climbing a small tree was thrown away by the wind and drowned. Several people were trapped in their homes after a creek topped its banks. A warehouse and four other buildings were destroyed, while a bank's roof was blown off. A train near Brookhaven was washed away along the tracks of the Mississippi Central Railroad, resulting in the injury of five people. 25 schooners along the Mississippi coastline were completely destroyed. Two barks, the Nurnberg and Hercules were destroyed during the hurricane. Mandeline, owned by Norway, was <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>water,</b> while Sigrav suffered severe damage, completely torn apart. A boat known as the Florine was washed ashore. A total of 78fatalities occurred.|$|E
5|$|In early March 1704 Beatrix Laing {{approached}} Patrick Morton, a 16-year-old {{working in}} his father's smithy, {{to ask if he}} would make her some nails. Morton refused as he was already assigned an urgent task making nails for a merchant's ship in the harbour. Displeased, Laing left threatening revenge on him. The following day Morton noticed a bucket <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>water</b> and burning coal outside Laing's house; he thought it was there to cast a spell on him. Laing had a reputation as a witch having already appeared before the Kirk session in 1696 for charming. Morton immediately felt weak and had difficulty standing or walking. His health deteriorated; he began to have fits and convulsions, his stomach became distended and his body was rigid and twisted. People claimed they could see marks left on his skin by fingernails where Morton said he had been pinched. He refused food and his breathing was laboured.|$|E
