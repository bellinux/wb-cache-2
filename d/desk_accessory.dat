5|$|A {{maximum of}} 15 Desk Accessories may be {{installed}} at one time, including the Chooser, Scrapbook, and Control Panel. System 6 uses the Control Panel <b>desk</b> <b>accessory</b> to access all the installed control panels, which imposes severe user interface limitations. Desk Accessories cannot be installed or removed within the Finder; this requires the Font/DA Mover utility. System 7 also fixed this. Control panels, however, {{are contained in}} separate files.|$|E

However, there was a limitation {{on the number of}} <b>Desk</b> <b>Accessories</b> that could be displayed in the Apple menu. Third-party shareware packages such as OtherMenu added a second customizable menu (without the trademarked Apple logo) that allowed users to install <b>Desk</b> <b>Accessories</b> beyond Apple's limitations.|$|R

Another Days limited edition release was bundled with a soundtrack disc titled To Heart 2 Secret Sound Track, which contained additional music not found in To Heart 2 original soundtrack release. The scenarios of Another Days are also included as part of the PlayStation 3 compilation, To Heart 2 DX Plus.|$|E

5000|$|Brown was a {{founding}} partner of CE Software in West Des Moines, Iowa and created {{at least two}} games for the company: SwordThrust, an expanded commercial version of Eamon, and Wall Street, a financial strategy game. Brown was later instrumental {{in the development of}} CE Software's QuicKeys macro recorder software and the QuickMail email client for the Apple Macintosh. In addition, Donald Brown produced the Executive Decision Maker <b>desk</b> <b>accessory</b> and the <b>Desk</b> <b>Accessory</b> Mover software utility; the latter {{was one of the first}} (if not the first) utilities that allowed users to install and move desk accessories on the Apple Macintosh platform. [...] Brown later worked for Prairie Group, a software development company in West Des Moines.|$|E
50|$|Another {{new feature}} was the {{inclusion}} of a set of <b>desk</b> <b>accessories</b> running on the terminal's CPU. These included a calculator, alarm clock, calendar and a character set viewer.|$|R
50|$|Prior to System 7, the Font/DA Mover {{had to be}} used to move these into or out of the System suitcase. From System 7 and on, the Finder {{could open}} and modify the {{contents}} of the file. Over the course of subsequent releases, many of the user-serviceable items stored in the System suitcase were moved into separate folders; this was done by creating individual file types that could contain these resources. System 7.0 allowed sounds, fonts and <b>desk</b> <b>accessories</b> to be moved into their own files; opening a sound file would cause the Finder to play the sound, opening a font would show a preview of the font being used, and the operating system treated <b>Desk</b> <b>Accessories</b> as if they were applications. All <b>Desk</b> <b>Accessories</b> were moved to the new Apple Menu Items folder, along with the Control Panels folder. System 7.1 introduced the Fonts folder, which worked by loading all resources (including fonts) contained in font files or font suitcases found within the Fonts folder as if {{they were part of the}} System suitcase.|$|R
50|$|While {{additions}} {{had been}} relatively limited, so had fixes {{to some of}} the underlying oddities of the system architecture. For instance, to support a limited form of multitasking, the original Mac OS supported small co-resident programs known as <b>desk</b> <b>accessories</b> which had to be installed into the Apple menu using special tools. If the system were able to support multiple tasks, this one-off solution would no longer be needed - <b>desk</b> <b>accessories</b> could simply be small programs, placed anywhere. Yet, as MultiFinder was still optional, such a step had not been taken. Numerous examples of this sort of problem could be found throughout the system.|$|R
5000|$|Hyper DA by Symmetry was a <b>Desk</b> <b>Accessory</b> for classic single-tasked Mac OS {{that allowed}} viewing HyperCard 1.x stacks as added windows in any extant application, {{and was also}} {{embedded}} into many Claris products (like MacDraw II) to display their user documentation.|$|E
50|$|A <b>desk</b> <b>accessory</b> or applet is {{an example}} of a simple, {{stand-alone}} user interface, in contrast with a more complex application such as a spreadsheet or word processor. These widgets are typical examples of transient and auxiliary applications that don't monopolize the user's attention.|$|E
50|$|Neko was {{originally}} {{written for the}} NEC PC-9801. It was later ported as a <b>desk</b> <b>accessory</b> to the Macintosh in 1989 by Kenji Gotoh(known as cartoonist Juan Gotoh. He also created the graphics of Neko in this page), followed by an X version by Masayuki Koba.|$|E

50|$|Originally, <b>desk</b> <b>accessories</b> were {{developed}} to provide a small degree of multitasking in operating systems that could only held one main application at a time, but when real multitasking OSes became available, these were replaced by normal applications.|$|R
50|$|The {{first version}} was unique in many ways; {{not least because}} it was {{released}} as both an application and a <b>desk</b> <b>accessory.</b> In the latter form, {{it could be used}} while another program, e.g. PageMaker, was running simultaneously; very handy in that time of single-program operation.|$|E
50|$|Scrapbook {{under the}} Classic Mac OS {{is a small}} <b>desk</b> <b>accessory</b> (DA) which enables users to store images, text and sound clippings. It was {{included}} in the original Macintosh system software in 1984 with the Macintosh 128K, and was included throughout every Mac OS revision until Mac OS 9.|$|E
50|$|Similarly, the Control Panel <b>desk</b> <b>accessory</b> {{became the}} Control Panels folder (found in the System Folder, and {{accessible}} to the user from an alias in the Apple menu). The control panels themselves became separate files, stored within this directory. Control panels are essentially system extensions with a user interface.|$|E
50|$|Under System 6, the Apple Menu {{contained}} both {{a list of}} <b>desk</b> <b>accessories,</b> {{as well as a}} list {{of running}} programs under MultiFinder. In System 7 the list of active programs was re-located to its own Application Menu.|$|R
50|$|By {{tradition}} all manades {{have to do}} with raising large animals, but a Paris-based {{trade name}} for a manufacturer of office items such as <b>desk</b> <b>accessories</b> and lamps seems to indicate a trend towards additional uses for the term.|$|R
50|$|GEM {{resembled the}} Macintosh closely in many respects, {{and one of}} them was the {{presence}} of <b>desk</b> <b>accessories,</b> for the same reason: to allow multiple programs to be used in a system that only supported one full application at a time.|$|R
