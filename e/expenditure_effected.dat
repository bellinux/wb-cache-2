40|$|The {{administration}} of the relevant part of EAGGF Guarantee expenditure, which {{accounts for more than}} 50 % of the budget of the European Communities follows shared management arrangements. Shared management means that member states pay and control the expenditure for agricultural and rural development subsidies and the Commission is responsible for the {{administration of}} payments and for auditing the control system of member states. The communication on the <b>expenditure</b> <b>effected</b> by accredited paying agencies takes place via a comprehensive financial reporting system and monthly EAGGF Committee meetings. These meetings provide scope for the reconciliation of any disagreement concerning the monthly advances reimbursed by the Commission to member states and also give an overview on actual budget implementation. The new member states which joined the European Union on 1 May 2004 have started to apply the comprehensive financial reporting system following an intensive cooperation period in the form of training seminars provided to them by the Commission for setting up the reporting systems of paying agencies. The first expenditure from the EAGGF Guarantee Section was executed in July 2004 and reported to the Commission during the following month. The pioneer new member states were the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Poland, followed by Hungary, Estonia and Slovenia a month later. Until the end of August approximately 6 million Euros have been withdrawn from the Fund, used in a fifty-fifty percent split for export restitutions for milk and milk products, beef and veal, live animals and eggs to countries outside the European Union and for other market intervention measures, such as supply of food from intervention stocks for distribution to the most deprived persons in the Community, production refunds on sugar used in the chemical industry, aid for skimmed milk processed into casein and school milk. By the end of the 2004 financial year (15 October 2004) some other new member states, Lithuania, Latvia and Cyprus also intend to start paying agricultural subsidies to their beneficiaries. The total estimated value of expenditure to be withdrawn from EAGGF Guarantee by the new member states in the 2004 financial year and charged therefore to the 2004 budget is circa an additional 14 million Euros. Therefore, the aggregated amount of the subsidy withdrawn by the EU- 10 countries charged to the 2004 budget will be ca. 20 million Euros, which is a minor amount compared to the budget appropriations included in the 2004 budget for EAGGF Guarantee as a whole. A speeding up of subsidy withdrawals is necessary for new member states to make the best use of benefit from CAP. It is possible to achieve this goal by the withdrawal of subsidies for direct aids. Direct aids can be paid to farmers in the framework of the Single Area Payment Scheme from {{the first day of the}} 2005 financial year (16 October 2004) in case of new member states (except Malta and Slovenia). The advances to member states will be reimbursed in January 2005 and charged therefore to the 2005 budget. As it was the case for earlier enlargements of the European Union, the first months of subsidy withdrawals are being used mainly to get acquainted with the administration and to test the operation of the paying agency systems. However, this period should be considered strictly as an interim phase and significant effort should be made by the national agricultural administrations to widen the â€œpenetrabilityâ€ of the subsidy handling, that is to increase the amount of subsidy withdrawn from the EU by the paying agency systems already operating in the new member states to benefit from the Common Agricultural Policy of the European Union. withdrawn from the EU Funds, target branches, paying agency systems, Agricultural and Food Policy, Crop Production/Industries, Livestock Production/Industries,...|$|E

40|$|According to Stokes and Coomes (1996) {{colleges and}} {{universities}} have two types of economic impacts in a regional economic area: <b>expenditure</b> <b>effects</b> and knowledge effects. One type of <b>expenditure</b> or spending <b>effect</b> is the amount of additional earnings and consumer purchases on the part of faculty, staff, students and alumnae/alumni that would not occur in a local economy if the college or university did not exist. Additional <b>expenditure</b> <b>effects</b> arise from organizational purchases that a school makes from suppliers; the direct and indirect payroll and jobs generated by the school; the additional credit at banks made available from college bank deposits and employee bank deposits; and the support to local governments through tax payments made by the college. <b>Expenditure</b> <b>effects</b> are usually estimated for one year and are considered short-term spending effects of a school. The increased earnings and purchases of the college's graduates who decide to stay and live within the institution's metro area usually measure knowledge effects. For colleges that are not located in a metro area (like Morehead or Murray State) knowledge effects are minimal because most graduates do not stay in the area that the college serves.

In this paper, we evaluate the heterogeneity in country health <b>expenditure</b> <b>effects</b> throughout the life expectancy distribution applying quantile regression to an assembled dataset of 177 countries. We find significant heterogeneities in <b>expenditures</b> <b>effects</b> on life expectancy that are completely masked by ordinary least squares (OLS), which underestimates (overestimates) the expenditure returns for countries ranking at low (high) life-expectancy quantiles. The largest returns from increased spending are for countries at the left margin of the life expectancy distribution (mainly at quantiles 0. 25 and lower), for which a $ 100 increase in per capita spending leads to 11. 5 and 11 months of life for males and females, respectively. The results suggest that increasing healthcare spending in these countries may have significant population-wide life expectancy returns.

40|$|Graduation date: 1979 State {{and federal}} aid {{payments}} to {{local governments have}} grown explosively over the last fifteen years. One reason for this growth is that the donor governments can alter a local government's budget choices through grants. Grants have not remedied social problems, however, because the local governments' responses to grants were not anticipated. Economists have broadened our understanding, but debates remain about the proper modeling of local buur grant impact knowledge. Accordingly, {{this study examined the}} effects of thdgeting and, because researchers used aggregated data, gaps exist in oree types of mental health grants on the budget allocations for Oregon counties. The theoretical literature on the <b>expenditure</b> <b>effects</b> of grants was first reviewed. The constrained maximization, median voter, and budget maximization models of local fiscal decision-making were described and then compared as to their predictions about the effects of different grants. It was concluded that too little was known about budgetary processes to use or compare the models' predictions. Empirical studies were then reviewed. Researchers, largely using demand frameworks, found that grants significantly affected local spending and that different grants induced different spending responses. Their estimates of the stimulus differed, though. Moreover, little or no research was undertaken on the employment, wage, and output effects of grants. The theoretical and statistical problems with these studies were examined. These problems were: (1) the misspecification of aid variables; (2) the aggregation of government units and public services; (3) the lack of institutional and political realism. A theoretical model of Oregon counties' expenditure and production decision-making for mental health services was developed based on the insights and criticisms of existing models. The model consists of eleven equations; some describing the "expenditure stage" of the budget process, others describing the "output stage". It was argued that county commissioners make the expenditure decisions, and that mental health administrators make the production decisions. The framework allowed us {{to examine the effects of}} mental health grants on expenditures, wages, staff numbers, patient numbers, and output and to study the determinants of grant participation. Using regression analysis, the equations were estimated from the observations for 31 Oregon counties in fiscal year 1975 - 1976. Ordinary least squares was used in the expenditure and grant participation equations. Two-stage and three-stage least squares were used in the rest. Regressions were run for western and eastern Oregon counties when possible. For all observations, the major findings suggested that a dollar of state matching mental health aid per capita stimulated per capita mental health expenditures by 1. 37, increased the professional staff by. 556 to. 762 persons per 10, 000 county residents and increased average professional salaries by 2, 173. A dollar of federal matching aid per capita appeared to have an <b>expenditure</b> <b>effect</b> of 1. 03, an employment effect of. 722, and no salary effect. A dollar of non-matching aid per capita had an estimated <b>expenditure</b> <b>effect</b> of 1. 00, an estimated employment effect of. 35, and no salary effect. In eastern Oregon, the major findings indicated that the marginal <b>expenditure</b> <b>effect</b> of federal aid was 1. 41, the marginal <b>expenditure</b> <b>effect</b> of non-matching aid was. 96, and that state matching aid had no <b>expenditure</b> <b>effect.</b> In western Oregon, a dollar of state matching aid per capita had an estimated <b>expenditure</b> <b>effect</b> of 2. 23, a professional employment effect of 1. 25, and no significant salary effect. A dollar of non-matching aid per capita had an estimated <b>expenditure</b> <b>effect</b> of 1. 67, and no significant employment or salary effects.
