5|$|Fifty-six {{games into}} his 2001–02 {{season with the}} Rangers, Sather dealt Malhotra to the Dallas Stars at the trade deadline, along with winger Barrett Heisten, in {{exchange}} for forwards Martin Rucinsky and Roman Lyashenko. Although he had established himself as an effective forechecker and defensive forward, Malhotra did not materialize into the offensive player the Rangers <b>hoped</b> <b>he</b> would be.|$|E
5|$|Mike McCarthy, New Orleans' {{offensive}} coordinator, Herman Edwards, a Tampa Bay assistant coach, and Marvin Lewis, Baltimore's defensive coordinator, {{were mentioned}} as possible replacements for Palmer. Policy {{also met with}} Butch Davis, the {{head coach of the}} University of Miami's football team. After rejecting an initial offer in December, Davis accepted the job the following month. Davis had turned around Miami's football program and put the team back in championship contention; Policy and Lerner <b>hoped</b> <b>he</b> could do the same in Cleveland.|$|E
5|$|This {{competitive}} {{group would}} spur McCudden {{to increase his}} score. 56's commanding officer, Major Richard Bloomfield noticed McCudden's leadership qualities and had <b>hoped</b> <b>he</b> could help turn the unit into an effective fighting team. At present the pilots, though talented, performed more as individuals. After flying {{for the first time}} with them Bloomfield promised to have him allocated to a position of Flight Commander. He formally took command of B flight on 14 August.|$|E

5|$|De Ferran was {{confident}} {{that he could be}} competitive and achieve a good result without having to worry about the championship. Da Matta felt his team had learnt more from the series previous race on a superspeedway which he believed would help him in California where he wanted to win. Having moved from 16th to eighth in the points standings with a victory in Laguna Seca and a second-place finish in Germany, Papis stated that he was focused on the race and <b>hoped</b> <b>he</b> would clinch his first victory in a 500-mile event despite having not managed to finish a race on a superspeedway in 2001. Bruno Junqueira was excited to race in Fontana and hoped that he could clinch his second victory of the year.|$|E
5|$|Franchitti was {{considered}} one of the favorites to win the race having won the event two years previously and hoped to keep a recent string of good results in the 2001 season going at the track. Bräck expected to perform well despite retiring from the previous year's event and <b>hoped</b> <b>he</b> could regain the momentum he built {{from the start of the}} season. The race's defending champion Michael Andretti had secured six of his 40 career victories in Toronto and stated that he did not know if luck played a part but noted his driving style was suited to the circuit. Having finished in the points-scoring position in three of the previous four races, Alex Tagliani said it encouraged him heading into the Indy Toronto.|$|E
5|$|In 1163, a {{conflict}} arose between {{the king and}} the new Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Becket, over {{the rights of the}} king in the English church. At a council held at Westminster in October 1163, the king and Becket contended over the question, with the bishops supporting Becket against the king. Robert was involved in the conflict not only as a bishop-elect, but as an envoy to Becket from the pope, as he accompanied Philip of Aumone, a French abbot, who was sent by Alexander to Becket in after the Council of Westminster to urge Becket not to inflame the situation. Robert went with Philip, probably because it was <b>hoped</b> <b>he</b> would be able to influence Becket.|$|E

5|$|In 82 Agricola crossed an {{unidentified}} {{body of water}} and defeated peoples unknown to the Romans until then. He fortified the coast facing Ireland, and Tacitus recalls that his father-in-law often claimed the island could be conquered with a single legion and a few auxiliaries. He had given refuge to an exiled Irish king whom he <b>hoped</b> <b>he</b> might use as the excuse for conquest. This conquest never happened, but some historians believe that the crossing referred to {{was in fact a}} small-scale exploratory or punitive expedition to Ireland.|$|E
5|$|On the ground, Taylor's {{offensive}} scrambling, while effective, was not Virginia Tech's primary rushing weapon. Running back Brandon Ore, Virginia Tech's starter at the position, {{would need}} to have a good game, analysts predicted, if the Hokies wanted to win the game. Ore, who suffered several injuries during the 2006 season, failed to produce meaningful offensive yardage until late in the season, disappointing many fans who <b>hoped</b> <b>he</b> would repeat his excellent 2006performance on the field. With a 146-yard performance against Virginia in the final game of the regular season, Ore seemed to have regained his 2006form and promised success in the ACC Championship Game.|$|E
5|$|Romesha {{was born}} in August 1981 in Lake City, California, to a family with a strong {{military}} background. His grandfather, Aury Smith, is a World War II veteran who fought in the Battle of Normandy. His father is a Vietnam War veteran who later became a church leader in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Romesha is the fourth of five siblings, including two brothers who also joined the military. He {{is a member of}} the LDS Church and attended seminary for four years during high school but ultimately decided not to become a missionary for the church as his family had <b>hoped</b> <b>he</b> would. Romesha grew up in Lake City, where he developed an avid love of hockey.|$|E

5|$|With {{the success}} of Boys in the Sand, Casey Donovan became an {{underground}} celebrity. While he never achieved the mainstream film career {{for which he had}} <b>hoped,</b> <b>he</b> continued his career in pornography and translated his fame into some appearances on the legitimate stage, including a successful national tour in the gay-themed play Tubstrip and an unsuccessful attempt to produce a revival of The Ritz. His fame also allowed him success as a high-priced escort. He remained a bankable commodity in the adult industry, making films for the next fifteen years until his death from AIDS-related illness in 1987.|$|E
5|$|Banister {{attended}} La Marque High School in La Marque, Texas. At La Marque, Banister {{played for}} the school's baseball, basketball, and American football teams. During his sophomore year of high school, Banister injured his right ankle while playing baseball. During an examination of his ankle, which was slow to heal, {{he was diagnosed with}} bone cancer. He had developed cysts that required skin grafting to treat. An infection in his leg {{led to the development of}} osteomyelitis, which spread from his right ankle to just below his knee. Doctors recommended amputation in order to save the rest of his leg, but Banister refused, as he <b>hoped</b> <b>he</b> would be able to continue his baseball career. Doctors performed seven operations on his leg, which saved it from being amputated. In his senior year, Banister suffered a knee injury playing American football, which nearly led to him being cut from the baseball team due to his decreased mobility. His father suggested he change positions and become a catcher, which allowed him to remain on the baseball team.|$|E
5|$|Founding {{member and}} lead singer Peter Gabriel {{decided to leave}} Genesis in late 1974, midway through the tour for the album The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway. The other members <b>hoped</b> <b>he</b> would reconsider, as {{they were still in}} debt and felt his {{departure}} could destroy the band's future, but ultimately accepted that he would leave. The remaining members felt they still wanted to collaborate musically, and show journalists and critics they were primarily a song writing team that could still produce good music. Keyboardist Tony Banks had been close to Gabriel personally, and did not want the band to split up on top of seeing less of one of his best friends. He had written a number of songs for a possible solo project before deciding they should be used on the new Genesis album.|$|E

5|$|Fourth-place {{finisher}} Hamilton said it {{had been}} a tough race for him because his car did not feel as good as he <b>hoped.</b> <b>He</b> had also hoped the gap would be closer than it was in qualifying. Webber stated that he enjoyed {{the first part of the}} event and was looking forward to the next race of the season. Kovalainen was issued with an reprimand for his role in the collision with de la Rosa. He admitted that he was at fault for causing the incident because he was allowing another car to pass him and had not seen de la Rosa approaching him. Force India's chief operating officer Otmar Szafnauer said the confusion resulting in the error of fitting the wrong tyres for both their drivers was an example of cause and effect. He wanted to disregard the issue and look forward to the next few races. The team received a warning from the stewards and avoided disqualification because they had recognised their mistake immediately.|$|E
5|$|The Mozarts {{arrived in}} Milan on 23 January and found {{comfortable}} lodgings in the monastery of San Marco, {{not far from}} Count Firmian's palace. While they waited to see the Count, they attended Niccolò Piccinni's opera Cesare in Egitto. Firmian eventually welcomed them with generous hospitality and friendship, presenting Wolfgang with a complete edition {{of the works of}} Metastasio, Italy's leading dramatic writer and librettist. Firmian also hosted a series of concerts attended by many of the city's notables, including Archduke Ferdinand, a possible future patron for the young composer. For the last of these occasions, Wolfgang wrote a set of arias using Metastasio's texts. These were so well received that Firmian commissioned Wolfgang to write the opening opera for the following winter's carnival season in Milan, just as Leopold had <b>hoped</b> <b>he</b> might. Wolfgang would receive a fee of around 500florins, and free lodgings during the writing and rehearsal. The Mozarts left Milan on 15 March, heading south towards Florence and Rome, committed to return in the autumn and taking with them fresh letters of recommendation from Firmian.|$|E
5|$|Morrison {{signed with}} the Anaheim Ducks to a one-year, US$2.75 million {{contract}} on July 7, 2008. He had received interest from as many as nine NHL teams, including the Canucks, who offered a one-year, US$1.9 million deal prior to Morrison's free agency. Morrison scored his first goal as a Duck on November 7 in a 5–2 loss to the Dallas Stars. While it was <b>hoped</b> <b>he</b> could be a replacement for Andy McDonald as the team's second-line centre, Morrison struggled in his short tenure with the Ducks. He was relegated to the fourth line and made a healthy scratch at various points in the season. It was proposed by the media {{that he was not}} yet playing at full capacity on account of his off-season knee surgery. With 22 points in 62 games, he was waived by the Ducks leading up to the NHL trade deadline on March 3, 2009. He was claimed the following day by the Dallas Stars. He scored his first goal with the Stars on March 12, the game-winner in a 3–2 contest against the Carolina Hurricanes. Morrison's 2008–09 total of 31 points between the Ducks and Stars was the lowest output of his career (not including the previous season's injury-shortened campaign and his 11-game 1997–98 season).|$|E
