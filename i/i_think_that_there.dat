2500|$|Indeed, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> {{is a real}} need, in {{formalism}} and elsewhere, to link {{our understanding}} of mathematics with {{our understanding of the}} physical world. [...] (A. Robinson) ...|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{knew that}} it was just going to be an {{opportunity}} to present myself {{in a way that was}} true to what some kids my age are doing, experiencing and thinking about. I just wanted to paint a true picture... and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> are still some things that women aren't [...] "suppose [...] to say," [...] you know what I mean? So, it's kind of jarring to hear that. I was more concerned about being respected as a good woman but still expressing myself like the Bostonian I am." ...|$|E
2500|$|When asked {{during the}} Meet the Press {{interview}} {{if she would}} take back her previous comments that Obama [...] "may have anti-American views" [...] and that his administration had [...] "embraced something called gangster government", Bachmann backed her statements, saying [...] "I do believe that actions {{that have been taken}} by this White House—I don't take back my statements on gangster government. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> have been actions taken by the government that are corrupt... I said I have very serious concerns about the president's views, and I think the president's actions {{in the last two years}} speak for themselves." ...|$|E

5000|$|When {{asked by}} Noisey in 2014 {{if he ever}} felt bitter {{for a lack of}} recognition, singer Kyle Bishop stated, [...] "There’s a lot of accolades that people give us for {{supposedly}} starting something and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that’s</b> all bullshit to be honest with you. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there’s</b> a billion bands that were doing similar things before us and after that that deserve just as much credit. And if we do get some credit by certain people, awesome. If we don't, it doesn’t really matter because <b>I</b> really don’t <b>think</b> it’s true anyways." ...|$|R
5000|$|When {{asked whether}} he {{believed}} [...] "there {{was some kind of}} destiny involved" [...] in humanity's transition to a multi-planetary species, rather than [...] "just physics", Musk responded:Well, I do. Do <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there's</b> some sort of master intelligence architecting all of this stuff? <b>I</b> <b>think</b> probably not because then you have to say: [...] "Where does the master intelligence come from?" [...] So it sort of begs the question. So <b>I</b> <b>think</b> really you can explain this with the fundamental laws of physics. You know its complex phenomenon from simple elements.|$|R
2500|$|Penrose is an atheist. In {{the film}} A Brief History of Time, he said, [...] "I think I {{would say that}} the {{universe}} has a purpose, it's not somehow just there by chance ... some people, I think, take the view that the universe is just there and it runs along – it's a bit like it just sort of computes, and we happen somehow by accident to find ourselves in this thing. But I don't think that's a very fruitful or helpful {{way of looking at the}} universe, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is something much deeper about it." [...] Penrose is a Distinguished Supporter of the British Humanist Association.|$|E
2500|$|According to a Channel 4 spokeswoman, Big Brother intervened so {{the contestants}} would [...] "realise {{that what they}} have said has been misconstrued in the house". The idea, she said, was to allow the housemates [...] "to explain themselves" [...] to their fellow contestants. This was {{followed}} by a series of apologies to Shetty from the housemates, and her belief that Goody was not a racist: [...] "I don't feel there was any racial discrimination happening from Jade's end... <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> are a lot of insecurities from her end but it's definitely not racial". However, Shetty was unaware of all the alleged insults (often made behind her back). Channel 4 was rebuked by Ofcom, which received more than 54,000 complaints, for its handling of the scandal.|$|E
2500|$|In {{their early}} years, Depeche Mode were {{considered}} teen idols, and regularly featured on front covers of magazines such as Smash Hits. Following {{the departure of}} Vince Clarke, their music began {{to take on a}} darker tone akin to that found in gothic rock, as Martin Gore assumed lead songwriting duties. Gore's lyrical artistry has been recognised as encapsulating themes such as sex, religion, and politics, so much so that many labelled the band's lyrical and musical themes as dark and bleak. In response, Gore has stated he feels lyrical themes which tackle issues related to solitude and loneliness present more of a realistic character and are a better representation of reality, whereas he finds [...] "happy songs" [...] fake and unrealistic: [...] "I've never seen our music as being over-dark. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is always an element of hope in our music." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{will believe}} you, {{because it will}} be a {{confirmation}} of my story; but <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is the least chance of our ever hearing anything further about it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is not my}} idea, Priscilla, and <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> can be {{anything}} in it. Indeed, I'm sure there isn't. I don't see how it's possible <b>that</b> <b>there</b> should be." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Banos {{is full of}} French troops," [...] one of them replied, [...] "and columns are marching {{down the}} pass. From what I can see, <b>I</b> should <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> must be 16,000 or 20,000 of them." ...|$|R
2500|$|Bree {{has been}} {{described}} as a [...] "hugely popular" [...] character despite her villainous characteristics and Blampied expected a lot more [...] "hate". Television New Zealand listed Bree, alongside sister Brooke (Beth Allen), as some of the soap's most memorable [...] "bad girls". Bree's introduction to the soap was named as a conclusion to a drama filled year for Brooke. Louise Wallace predicted the scenes where her character Annette Freeman, was held captive by Bree, would captivate the audience, she stated: [...] "It’s great stuff ... <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> will be a few water cooler moments when people say, ‘Hey, did you see Shorty last night?’" [...] Television blogger Chris Philpot disliked the character of Bree and jokingly offered to sacrifice his least favoured characters – Harry Warner and Daniel Potts, in order for her to leave. The storyline that saw Bree lose her mind has been named as one of the show's most [...] "dramatic breakdowns".|$|E

6000|$|... "Inspector," [...] he said, [...] "I {{give this}} man in charge for a barefaced attempt at blackmailing me. You have heard all that has been said. <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is {{anything}} for me to add." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{is nothing}} left for Mankind but a Republic, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> [...] <b>there</b> are hopes of such. The two Americas (South and North) have it; [...] Spain and Portugal {{approach}} it; all thirst for it. Oh Washington!"] ...|$|R

5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Stack Magazine, Lewis said [...] "I go through phases when I’m writing songs; if I'm surging {{to that kind of}} music, I'm just keen to write songs like <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there's</b> a thread through them. But I've written 100 to 150 songs {{in the last two years}} so it was really, really, really tough choosing songs for the EP. And it's also hard because I don't want to give everything away too quickly. I kept a few of the ones <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> will be better for the album. I'm really proud of the songs so I can't wait to put this EP out there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Mrs. Gray; [...] "and <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> {{will be much}} {{danger in}} our going by ourselves. If we don't find Mr. George, we can walk about a while, {{and then come back}} in the {{carriage}} again." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "It is very silly of me," [...] she whispered. [...] "I am {{not at all}} nervous, {{but ever}} since they killed Hendrik I cannot bear the sight of those animals. <b>I</b> always <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is {{something}} human about them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{studied it}} for half-an-hour before I {{went to bed}} last night, Miss de la Molle, and {{for the life of}} me I could not make {{anything}} out of it, and what's more, <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is anything to make out." ...|$|R
5000|$|Writer Danny Brocklehurst noted; [...] "What {{this was}} {{supposed}} to be was very much in that Clocking Off or The Lakes kind of vein of telling stories about people who actually - other than in soaps - don't make it onto television that often. It's about ordinary, working-class lives. I wanted to tell stories with dignity and humanity and truth about ordinary people, and even though the stories are not always life and death, they are really important to those characters. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there's</b> not enough of that type of telly on these days. People want to sit down at the end of the day and watch something that they see a bit of themselves in." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now," [...] said Leo to me nervously in {{the silence}} that followed, and {{speaking}} in English, [...] "now I wish we were somewhere else, for <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> will be trouble." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, {{that may}} be so, but <b>I</b> still <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> must be some way out from here. Why should men go to the labour of cutting this long stair, and {{excavating}} this chamber here, without any reason whatever? Let us look through the window, Meinik." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't <b>think</b> <b>that</b> {{is much to}} put up with, captain," [...] Patsey {{said with}} a smile, [...] "if he always cooks for you such breakfasts and dinners as we have had today; and <b>I</b> do <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is, perhaps, {{something}} in what he says about rough hands." ...|$|R
