40|$|Detailed {{case study}} of Rajsamadhiyala {{watershed}} in the semi-arid tropical area of Gujarat in India revealed that rainwater harvesting through watershed management doubled the production of groundnut and other major crops, increased cropping intensity by 32 % in eight years. With improved groundwater availability diversification with high-value crops like cumin, vegetables and fruits was observed. Food, fodder, fuel sufficiency substantially improved along with the increased incomes, literacy and social development. Substantial investment of 16. 25 million rupees [US$ 0. 36 million) in rainwater harvesting in one village created storage capacity to harvest 16 % of mean annual rainfall of 503 mm which is equivalent to 100 % of potential runoff during a normal year. Considering percolation seepage and evaporation losses 40 % of annual mean rainfall could be harvested and stored. However, because of geological formation in the Deccan plateau where soils are formed over a layer of weathered trap laid on hard rock during normal rainfall years, these structures overflow 2 - 3 times in the rainy season. Downstream villages Aniyala and Kasturba Dham benefited in terms of increased groundwater availability, reduced siltation and flooding through the base flow seepage water and excess runoff. Detailed studies in two downstream villages showed increased productivity, however, by 25 - 30 %, improved groundwater availability by 25 %, and reduced <b>distressed</b> <b>migration.</b> Dedicated leadership helped the villagers to chalkout the path to prosperity. Vast potential to increase productivity by 80 - 90 % remains to be harnessed through adoption of increased water use efficiency measures, as most benefits are due to increased water availability only. However, looking at the trends of over-exploitation of groundwater by doubling the number of borewells and pumping hours call for urgent steps to develop suitable social/legal mechanisms for sustainable use of water resources through integrated water resource management. Improved water availability through public investment triggered private/ individual investment in agriculture in rainfed areas further hastening the process of development...|$|R

40|$|There {{are still}} many {{categories}} of children in India for whom adequate and appropriate strategies are not in place for their effective education. One such substantive category is children of seasonal migrants – a group {{which has not been}} on the radar screen of the government or development agencies. <b>Distress</b> seasonal <b>migration</b> is a growing phenomenon in almost all arid parts of India. Drought and lack of work in villages forces entire families to migrate for several months every year in search of work merely to survive. Children accompany their parents, and as a result drop-out rates go up. Migrants comprise the most vulnerable sections of society, and especially those that also belong to Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe groups. There is no official data available on the scale of <b>distress</b> seasonal <b>migration,</b> but estimates put the numbers of migrants between 1 and 3 crore (10 to 30 million). The number of children involved in these migrations may range between 40 and 60 lakhs (4 to 6 million). Migration takes place to a range of industrial and agro-industrial sectors such as brick manufacture, salt making, sugar cane harvesting, stone quarrying, construction, plantations and fishing. This paper identifies major sectors and geographies with a high incidence of seasonal migration, and gives broad estimates of the numbers involved, especially the number of children between 0 - 14 years. It also outlines the nature and patterns of seasonal migration in different sectors, and how these annual migration cycles overlap with the annual school calendar. The discussion focuses on the difficulties that children face with schooling both in villages and at migration sites, and the conditions under which children drop out of schools, as well as the response or lack of response of local school systems to the education of migrant children in some areas. The paper also outlines the efforts made so far by government and NGOs to address these problems through alternative schooling, and provides recommendations for state and central governments in terms of policy and program interventions...|$|R

40|$|Increasingly, {{research}} {{seeks to}} understand how environmental <b>distress</b> motivates <b>migration,</b> often focusing {{on the importance of}} singular events such as flood, drought or crop loss. This article explores the case of a Cambodian community where environmental shocks have been frequent over the past decade and international migration has increased. It shows {{that as a result of}} recurring and varied environmental shocks, households increasingly perceive agriculture-based livelihood strategies as unwise and risky. This perception is widespread even among households not directly experiencing income loss. As a result, households use migration as a replacement for local livelihood strategies. These findings support two arguments relevant for future research and policy. First, that environmental shocks have importance beyond their immediate, direct impact. Second, that recurring shocks can influence preferences for and risk perceptions of local investments. Thus for policies to effectively address environmental vulnerability and/or rural development in precarious environments, they must incorporate local understandings of risk and possibility...|$|R

40|$|An {{attempt is}} made in this article to explore and build {{knowledge}} on the close linkage between environmental insecurity and social friction {{in the context of}} rural Odisha, particularly in the wake of neo-liberalist policies. Environmental insecurity and social friction are intertwined with destabilization of natural-resource–based livelihood system, reflected in degradation of land, forests and water, in many cases causing irreversible damage to the ecosystem. What is significant to note is that loss of natural resource base for livelihood has led to unemployment, underemployment of people dependent on such resources, increasing morbidity, <b>distress</b> <b>migration</b> and social disharmony and conflicts at family and community levels. Furthermore, there is transformation of the local social environment with the emergence of an elite group in the form of company officials, contractors, journalists, traders and police/government offi-cials who begin to encroach and control the future of the local communities. One major issue emerges from the research—need for a holistic approach to understand the process of environmental scarcity induced social friction in developing possible strategies, institutions and policies to achieve the desired development goals, transformation of stakeholders and their relationships in a given context...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} coping and {{adaptation}} processes of Bangladeshi peasants after the natural disaster of Cyclone Aila in 2009. The {{focus is on}} the experience of peasants and how they responded to the losses caused by the cyclone. Using 72 in-depth interviews with peasants, shrimp farmers, local leaders, labour contractors, engineers and NGO staff, this study analyses the aftermath of Cyclone Aila in two villages in the Satkhira district located in the Sundarban delta of Bangladesh. One of the villages, Gorkumarpur, was considerably more economically backward and poorer than the other, the village of Mollapara. This thesis discovered that peasants saw corruption and the conflict between local interest groups as one of the major obstacles to reconstruction of the damaged embankments. It also found that the peasants were able to cope with this natural calamity by taking up a range of casual jobs. Such employment was essential after the initial relief initiatives ended. A second, longer-term adaptation strategy involved some peasant families migrating to other parts of Bangladesh and to India. <b>Distress</b> <b>migration</b> after 2009 was superficially reminiscent of the migration that occurred during the Bengal Famine of 1943. However, it was not {{the poorest of the poor}} who typically migrated after 2009 but those who had access to at least some resources. Migration was costly.

The article focuses on the personal story of a woman who migrated from the United States (US) to Australia, and whose sense of disconnection and displacement in relation to everyday life is embedded within a narrative of depression. Our discussion of her twin narratives of emotional <b>distress</b> and <b>migration</b> is located within theoretical debates about depression, migration and the constitution of subjectivity. In particular, we draw on psychoanalytical approaches to subjectivity to argue that her emotional distress and the medical diagnosis of depression together represent a form of &# 039;experienc[ing] oneself as a subject&# 039; (Butler, 2005), and function as a precondition to her narrative of migration.

40|$|This study prospectively {{evaluates the}} {{relationship}} between unaccompanied status and levels of psychological distress {{in a group of}} Vietnamese Amerasians both prior to, and during, migration. Its objective was to determine whether unaccompanied migrant status functions as an independent post-departure risk factor for psychological distress, or if unaccompanied migrants are already at increased risk for, and have higher levels of, psychological distress prior to departure and the acquisition of unaccompanied status. Seventy-five Vietnamese Amerasian youth were evaluated at two points during their migration utilizing Felsman's Personal Information Form, the Hopkins Symptom Checklist- 25, and the Youth Self-Report. The first assessment was conducted prior to migration at the Amerasian Transit Center in Vietnam, and the second during migration at the Philippine Refugee Processing Center. Unaccompanied Amerasians were found to have significantly higher risk levels for, and significantly more symptoms of, psychological <b>distress</b> prior to <b>migration</b> than accompanied Amerasians. During migration the difference in levels of psychological distress between accompanied and unaccompanied Amerasians increased beyond that attributable to predeparture risk levels alone. This significant differential increase in levels of psychological distress among unaccompanied Amerasians is attributable to unaccompanied status. Unaccompanied migrant status thus appears to function both as an independent postdeparture risk factor for psychological distress and also as a marker for increased levels of risk and psychological <b>distress</b> prior to <b>migration.</b> unaccompanied migrants risk factors psychological distress...|$|R

According to census data from 2011 15. 9 million immigrants and their descendants have been living in Germany. Yet, data on physical and mental health determinants of immigrants in Germany is scarce. Some studies from neighbouring European countries and North America suggest an increased rate of psychological distress and mental disorders in some migrant and ethnic minority groups. Among possible underlying factors have socioeconomic factors been discussed. In particular social status may be a significant mediator for the relationship between migrant status and psychological distress, and symptoms of depression, respectively. Aim of the presented studies was to (a) estimate the rate of psychological distress (and symptoms of depression) in immigrants and their descendants in Germany, and (b) to examine the effect of socioeconomic risk factors on psychological distress in immigrants and their descendants compared to native Germans. Across all three studies we found a high rate of psychological distress (and symptoms of depression) in immigrants and their descendants independent of age, gender, and study region. Furthermore, our findings suggest an impact of socioeconomic factors on the association of psychological <b>distress</b> and <b>migration</b> status...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{determine}} the importance of the environment as a driver of North-South migration in Ghana. Almost one in every five people born in northern Ghana is living in southern Ghana. Interviews with 203 migrant farmers suggest that migration from the North to the South is, to a large extent, environmentally induced. Many Northerners decided to migrate because of poor agro-ecological conditions at home combined with easy access to fertile lands in the more humid destination area. The interviews with migrant farmers yielded several insights that are relevant for the environmental refugee debate. Firstly, environmental pull appears to be at least as important as environmental push. Secondly, scarcity of fertile land was mentioned much more often as a reason to migrate than climate change or erratic rainfall. Thirdly, none of the respondents ascribed the migration decision to sudden-onset environmental stress. If the environment is indeed an important driver of migration, one would expect migration rates to be higher in places with and times of more severe scarcity. A cross-sectional analysis of migration propensities and natural resources scarcity confirms that out-migration rates are significantly higher in poorly endowed districts. A longitudinal analysis of migration and rainfall shows that the period of worst environmental stress [...] during the Sahelian droughts of the late 1970 s and early 1980 s [...] was a time of reduced out-migration from northern Ghana. In this period of northern Ghana’s migration history, economic and political factors weighed heavier than environmental factors. The picture that emerges for northern Ghana is not one of <b>distress</b> <b>migration</b> in the face of environmental disaster but rather of migration as a way of dealing with structural environmental scarcity...|$|E
40|$|Headline issue: This paper {{informs the}} {{development}} community {{about the effects}} of climate change on migration patterns within and out of developing countries. It concentrates on the economic aspects of migration and on information that is relevant for the six semi-arid countries that are the focus of the PRISE (Pathways to Resilience in Semi-Arid Economies) project: Burkina Faso, Senegal, Kenya, Tanzania, Pakistan and Tajikistan. Policy intervention is required to reduce potential negative impacts in both the sending and receiving region. Badly managed migration is associated with high economic, social and psychological costs. Key findings: To ensure effective migration choices and a good management of the wider socio-economic effects, policy-makers should: Provide sufficient information about {{the costs and benefits of}} migrating, including psychological and social, along with more clarity about alternative adaptation options. Release credit constraints, present in all PRISE countries and in particular in Senegal and Tajikistan, to offset the up-front costs incurred by potential migrants, particularly high in areas with poor transportation infrastructure. Improve institutional quality to ensure the incentives to migrate are not reduced, in particular in the context of land tenure security when people are not able to sell their land or are not confident of reclaiming it upon return. Define the legal status of environmental migrants, for example, through a process led by the UN or UNHCR, in order to give people certainty about their legal situation. Put in place safeguards against <b>distress</b> <b>migration,</b> for example in the event of conflict, which can force people to choose sub-optimal migration strategies, leading to maladaptation. Support the areas affected by outward migration by promoting links between migrants and their region of origin; “managed retreat” from severely affected regions may be a last resort if they become inhospitable. Support the absorptive capacity of the receiving jurisdictions, in particular urban labour markets and public services, to manage the socio-economic implications of the arrival of migrants in a new destination. Direct migrants away from environmentally vulnerable areas where they move to for different reasons, as is the case in Senegal where more than 40 per cent of new migrant populations are located in high risk flood zones...|$|E
40|$|This study re-examines {{the healthy}} migrant {{phenomenon}} in China's internal migration process and investigates the different trajectories of {{place of origin}} on migrants' self-rated physical health and psychological distress. Data came from a household survey (N = 1474) conducted in Beijing between May and October in 2009. Multiple regression techniques were used to model the associations between self-rated physical health, psychological <b>distress,</b> and <b>migration</b> experience, controlling for sociodemographic characteristics. The healthy migrant phenomenon was observed among migrants on self-rated physical health but not on psychological distress. Different health status trajectories existed between physical health versus mental health and between rural-to-urban migrants versus urban-to-urban migrants. The study draws {{particular attention to the}} diminishing physical health advantage and the initial high level of psychological distress among urban-to-urban migrants. The initial physical health advantage indicates {{that it is necessary to}} reach out to the migrant population and provide equal access to health services in the urban area. The high level of psychological distress suggests that efforts targeting mental health promotion and mental disorder prevention among the migrant population are an urgent need. The findings of the study underline the necessity to make fundamental changes to the restrictive hukou system and the unequal distribution of resources and opportunities in urban and rural areas. These changes will lessen the pressure on big cities and improve the living conditions and opportunities of residents in townships/small cities and the countryside.

40|$|Migration {{is not a}} new {{phenomenon}} as humans have been migrating for centuries. The world’s international migrant population is experiencing a rapid increase in both the global North and South. Europe’s attempts to protect its borders against migration flows, has recently become a focus of migration discourses especially with images in the media of men, women and children attempting to cross the Mediterranean Sea with thousands losing their lives. Of those who make the journey, stories of resilience and gross human rights abuses emerge with calls for European Nations to do more to assist these migrant. Of the migrant groups refugees are considered {{as one of the most}} vulnerable groups of migrants as they are forced to flee due to some form of persecution. Whilst migration itself does not cause mental <b>distress,</b> pre-migration, <b>migration</b> and post-migration factors can contribute to mental distress in vulnerable groups. For those refugees who need psychosocial assistant, further challenges of access to health services, particularly mental services are presented post-migration. Policies and conditions in the new country often dictate the allocation of resources as well as how refugees are received and assisted. Acculturation and navigating the new health systems also poses more problems for refugees, with many being unaware of their rights and entitlements in the often culturally alien environment. As expressions of emotional distress varies from culture to culture, mental health practitioners and refugees are faced with added challenges in language, culture and treatment in mental health service provision. The purpose of this study is to revisit the accessibility of mental health service for refugees in Norway. The main aims are to ascertain if the current service provisions are adequate and whether culture is an important consideration when providing mental health services for refugees from non-Western backgrounds. The right to health is also explored to determine whether service providers view the right to health as a human right in service provision. This study was conducted by interviewing 27 professionals working with immigrants and refugees in Norway in the form of focus group interviews, semi-structured one-to-one interviews and the use of secondary data. The results of the research concluded that specialist mental services are needed in Norway in order to provide services that are culturally appropriate and accessible for refugees in order for them to realise their right to health and integration into the larger Norwegian Society...|$|R
40|$|In four {{scientific}} papers, {{this thesis}} investigates the processes, {{in terms of}} movements of individuals, that have produced, reproduced and transformed patterns of residential segregation in Swedish cities between 1990 and 2000. Paper 1 examines processes of immigrant concentration, {{and the role of}} the Swedish majority population in these processes. Neighbourhood transition and mobility are described and analysed for a selection of residential areas that have experienced increased immigrant concentration. The results show that low in-migration rate among Swedes, rather than high out-migration rate, has been the main driving force behind the production and reproduction of immigrant concentration areas. Paper 2 investigates the hypothesis that distressed neighbourhoods retain their character of <b>distress</b> through selective <b>migration.</b> The socio-economic situations of in-migrants, out-migrants and stayers in the distressed neighbourhoods of Stockholm are analysed and compared, and the results show the hypothesis to be confirmed. The people who move in are more likely to be unemployed and dependent on social benefits, and have on average lower incomes than those who move out and those who remain in the neighbourhoods. Paper 3 further investigates the selective character of the out-migration from distressed neighbourhoods. One important conclusion is that the out-migration flow from the distressed residential areas is socio-economically and ethnically selective. When demographic and socio-economic differences are controlled for, the likelihood of leaving the distressed neighbourhoods is much lower for an immigrant than for a Swedish-born person. Paper 4 examines the migration flows of a whole city, Göteborg. The paper deals with some of the most common questions within segregation research; the degree of spatial concentration of different ethnic groups, processes of concentration and dispersal, the role of the minority enclaves as ports of entry to the local housing market, and how this differs between ethnic groups...|$|R
40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. August 2011. Major: Social Work. Advisor: C. David Hollister, Ph. D. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF);ix, 264 pages, appendices A-E. Refugee families undergo multiple challenges and hardships {{that tend to}} cause tremendous psychological <b>distress</b> in the <b>migration</b> and resettlement processes. This dissertation research was designed to explore refugee families' mental health in the social ecological contexts of displacement and homelessness and to investigate stressors and coping in relation to transition of resources including social capital of refugee families. With three theoretical frameworks, a social ecology theory, stress and coping theory, and social capital theory, the author developed a series of hypothetical statements as well as research questions to modify and refine hypotheses on stress and coping processes of refugee families. A modified analytic induction method was adopted for analysis of interview data from 26 Hmong and Somali families in Twin Cities area. The {{findings of this study}} revealed that psychological distress was deeply associated with challenges and transition in resources at various levels. Rearrangement of resources (cultural resources in particular) occurred after resettlement, which tended to impede coping capacity of refugee families and cause acculturation stress. Social capital, both bonding and linking, functioned as a critical form of resource for refugee families to resettle and adjust to the host community by supplementing personal, family, and cultural resources that are often sparse in refugee communities. The results of the current study imply that it is a critical coping strategy for refugee families to build or increase social capital, which sometimes leads families' secondary migration in search of better bonding social capital. This study also demonstrated high levels of psychological distress among refugee families, ranging from traumatic experiences before migration to acute stress after homelessness. Exposure to traumatic events before and during migration was salient in refugee families, while a lack of resources and frustrated coping strategies contributed to tremendous distress, which has been a chronic condition for the refugee families. This dissertation underscores the importance of social work practice focusing on culturally responsive resettlement services considering various challenges and cultural coping of refugee families. Policy interventions promoting family and bonding social capital are also critical to improve resettlement outcomes as well as refugee mental health...|$|R
