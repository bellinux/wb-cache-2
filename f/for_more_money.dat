5|$|During 1934 {{and early}} 1935, all feature films {{released}} in the Dutch East Indies had been produced by The Teng Chun, based on Chinese mythology or martial arts, and targeted at low-class audiences, generally ethnic Chinese. This situation {{was created by the}} Great Depression, which had led to the Dutch East Indies government collecting higher taxes, advertisers asking <b>for</b> <b>more</b> <b>money,</b> and cinemas selling tickets at lower prices; this ensured that there was a very low profit margin for local films. During this period cinemas in the country mainly showed Hollywood productions.|$|E

Ruth, {{fully aware of}} baseball's popularity and his role in it, wanted to renegotiate his contract, signed before the 1919 season for $10,000 per year through 1921. He demanded that his salary be doubled, or he would sit out the season and cash in on his popularity through other ventures. Ruth's salary demands were causing other players to ask <b>for</b> <b>more</b> <b>money.</b> Additionally, Frazee still owed Lannin as much as $125,000 from {{the purchase of the}} club.|$|E

5|$|In a 2011 study, {{researchers}} {{tested to}} see if people would willingly choose between instant and delayed gratification by offering them a set amount of (hypothetical) money that they could receive presently, or telling them they could wait a month <b>for</b> <b>more</b> <b>money.</b> Results suggested that willingness to delay gratification depended {{on the amount of}} money being offered, but also showed wide individual variation in the threshold of later reward that was motivating enough to forgo the immediate reward. The subjective value of a reward can also stem from the way one describes the potential reward. As prospect theory states, people are heavily loss-averse. People tend to value a commodity more when it is considered to be something that can be lost or given up than when it is evaluated as a potential gain.|$|E

5|$|With the {{emergence}} of The New Yorker, Benchley was able {{to stay away from}} Hollywood work for a number of years. In 1931, he was persuaded to do voice work for RKO Radio Pictures for a film that would eventually be titled Sky Devils, and he acted in his first feature film, The Sport Parade (1932) with Joel McCrea. The work on The Sport Parade caused Benchley to miss the fall theatre openings, which embarrassed him (even if the relative success of The Sport Parade was often credited to Benchley's role), but the lure of filmmaking did not disappear, since RKO offered him a writing and acting contract for the following year <b>for</b> <b>more</b> <b>money</b> than he was making writing for The New Yorker.|$|E

5|$|Although Democrats held a {{majority}} {{in both houses of}} the General Assembly, they were divided by factionalism, which made it difficult for Chandler to find sufficient support for his programs. Some of the factionalism came from Clements and Combs supporters who were not willing to cooperate with Chandler, their chief political enemy. Still other resistance to Chandler came from a group of more liberal lawmakers like John B. Breckinridge who simply had philosophical differences with the governor. Near the end of the 1958 legislative session, this group demanded a special session to deal with the need <b>for</b> <b>more</b> <b>money</b> for schools and welfare programs, but Chandler refused to call the session when the liberals would not agree to pass only the measures he put before them. Because of the factionalism, Chandler had to ally with Republican legislators throughout his term in order to pass many of his proposals, including his tax plan. Frequently, this meant promising to build or repair roads in Republican districts in return for their support of his programs.|$|E
