5|$|A new Fire Emblem {{title was}} first {{announced}} in April 2004, {{with the full}} reveal coming in an issue of Weekly Shōnen Jump. The game's title, story <b>details</b> <b>and</b> chosen platform were announced in Weekly Shōnen Jump, with a release date announced as some time during 2004. The game was first shown publicly by Nintendo at their Nintendo World Touch DS event in early 2005. The version of the game displayed there was an early model, and between its reveal and release, it underwent some changes to improve the usability and quality. As a pre-order bonus, Nintendo created a special CD containing selected tracks form the game, and a special calendar commemorating the series' 15th anniversary. The game released in Japan on April 20, 2005.|$|E
5|$|According to setup {{coordinator}} Douglas Cook, the rehearsals {{enabled them}} to reduce the setup time to under five minutes.

Drawings of the performances depicted what was expected for each setup, with the volunteers assembling the stage in segments and moving them to the field with carts. Madonna's entrance had to be rehearsed several times for coordination. Although Cook learned during the game that the New England Patriots were scheduled to exit on the route used by volunteers carrying the stage equipment, he resolved the issue by talking with the team.|$|E

5|$|According to the Suda, the Catalogue {{was five}} books long. The length of each is unknown, {{but it is}} likely that the entire poem {{consisted}} of anywhere from 4000 to over 5000 lines. The majority of the content was structured around major genealogical units: the descendants of Aeolus were found in book 1 and at least part of book 2, followed by those of Inachus, Pelasgus, Atlas and Pelops in the later books. It is believed that a rough guide to this structure can be found in the Bibliotheca, a Roman-era mythological handbook transmitted under the name of Apollodorus of Athens which used the Catalogue as a primary source for many genealogical <b>details</b> <b>and</b> appears to have followed reflect the poem's overall arrangement.|$|E

5|$|As the 1st and 3rd Light Horse Brigades {{continued}} their dismounted attacks, they were shelled by Ottoman artillery.

The brigade established an outpost line in this sector, having suffered seven men killed and 83 wounded, 68 horses killed and 23 wounded. The 10th Light Horse Regiment (3rd Light Horse Brigade) held an outpost line north of Beersheba during the night, {{when a group of}} Ottoman soldiers approached the line at about 21:00. They were surrounded on three sides before the regiment fired on them with machine-guns, killing 50.|$|E

5|$|Balzac wrote Louis Lambert {{during the}} summer of 1832 while he was staying with friends at the Château de Saché, and {{published}} three editions with three different titles. The novel contains a minimal plot, focusing mostly on the metaphysical ideas of its boy-genius protagonist and his only friend (eventually revealed to be Balzac himself). Although it is not a significant example of the realist style for which Balzac became famous, the novel provides insight into the author's own childhood. Specific <b>details</b> <b>and</b> events from the author's life – including punishment from teachers and social ostracism – suggest a fictionalized autobiography.|$|E
5|$|During the {{streaming}} of the series, Silverman {{criticized the}} animation {{because of the}} low lighting levels that might {{make it hard to}} understand. Hiroko Yamamura from Japanator noted the series' high budget and praised the animation style and the focus on <b>details</b> <b>and</b> technology. She was attracted by its premise and expected the quality to remain consistent across the entire series. Similarly, Jacob Hope Chapman from ANN praised the animation for its high quality. Episode 18, which is known for its flawed animation, was improved for the home media release of the series.|$|E
5|$|Each of {{the districts}} include Norman- or medieval-era churches, {{many of which}} are {{included}} in the Somerset towers, a collection of distinctive, mostly spireless Gothic architecture church towers. The prolific construction of the towers—some started before 1360—was typically accomplished by a master mason and a small team of itinerant masons, supplemented by local parish labourers, according to Poyntz Wright. But other authors reject this model, suggesting instead that leading architects designed the parish church towers based on early examples of Perpendicular design and ornamentation developed for cathedrals—their most important commissions. Contract builders carried out the plans, adding a distinctive mix of innovative <b>details</b> <b>and</b> decorations as new designs emerged over the years. These are included in the List of towers in Somerset.|$|E
