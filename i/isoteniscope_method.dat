The results for diethyl-ether, propanone, ethanol and n-hexane are in very good agreement with those from literature.

An empirical equation ha been calculated relating the {{vapor pressure}} of phenylhydrazine and the tenperature This equation is log p = 7. 9046 - 2366. 4 t * 230 The {{heat of vaporization}} has been calculated {{by means of the}} integrated form of the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, usin the pros-sure valves determined.
