It marked the debut of Drea de Matteo as Angie Bolen, the matriarch of an Italian family.

She accepted the offer without knowing the character's name or storyline. Cherry described the Angie character as [...] "a very loving but tough Italian woman who comes [...] with her husband and <b>her</b> <b>kid...</b> will do what she has to to protect her family." [...] Jeffrey Nordling and Beau Mirchoff made their series debuts in this episode as well, appearing as Nick, Angie's landscaper husband, and Danny, their [...] "tightly-wound" [...] son, respectively. Maiara Walsh also joined the cast as a series regular, having made her debut as Ana Solis in a guest starring capacity during season five.|$|E

2500|$|Colleen Moore {{made her}} flapper debut in a {{successful}} {{adaptation of the}} daring novel Flaming Youth, released November 12, 1923, six weeks before Black Oxen. Both films were produced by First National Pictures, and while Black Oxen was still being edited and Flaming Youth not yet released, Bow was requested to co-star with Moore as <b>her</b> <b>kid</b> sister in Painted People (The Swamp Angel). Moore essayed the baseball-playing tomboy and Bow, according to Moore, said [...] "I don't like my part, I wanna play yours." [...] Moore, a well-established star earning $1200 a week—Bow got $200—took offense and blocked the director from shooting close-ups of Bow. Moore was married to the film's producer and Bow's protests were futile. [...] "I'll get that bitch", she told her boyfriend Jacobson, who had arrived from New York. Bow had sinus problems and decided to have them attended to that very evening. With Bow's face now in bandages, the studio {{had no choice but}} to recast her part.|$|E
2500|$|The {{following}} year, MacDonald {{starred in}} two of the highest-grossing films of that year. In Rose-Marie (1936), MacDonald played a haughty opera diva who learns <b>her</b> <b>kid</b> brother (James Stewart) has killed a Mountie and is hiding in the northern woods; Eddy is the Mountie sent to capture him. [...] Nelson Eddy and she sang Rudolf Friml's [...] "Indian Love Call" [...] {{to each other in the}} Canadian wilderness (actually filmed at Lake Tahoe).

When the Canadian Mounties temporarily retired their distinctive hat in 1970, photos of Eddy in his Rose Marie uniform appeared in thousands of U.S. newspapers. [...] San Francisco (1936) was also directed by W.S. Van Dyke. In this tale of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, MacDonald played a hopeful opera singer opposite Clark Gable as the he-man proprietor of a Barbary Coast gambling joint, and Spencer Tracy as his boyhood chum who has become a priest and gives the moral messages.|$|E
