25|$|Schmidt {{graduated}} from Yorktown High School in the Yorktown neighborhood of Arlington County, Virginia, in 1972, after earning eight varsity letter awards in long-distance running. He then attended Princeton University, {{where he started}} as an architecture major but then switched and earned a B.S. degree in electrical engineering in 1976. From 1976 to 1980, Schmidt stayed at the International House Berkeley, where he met his future wife, Wendy Boyle. In 1979, at the University of California, Berkeley, Schmidt then earned an M.S. degree for designing and implementing a network (Berknet) linking the campus computer center with the CS and EECS departments. There, he also earned a Ph.D. degree in 1982 in EECS, with a dissertation {{about the problems of}} managing <b>distributed</b> <b>software</b> development and tools for solving these problems.|$|E
2500|$|Much of the {{shareware}} {{movement was}} started via user distribution of software through BBSes. A notable example was Phil Katz's PKARC (and later PKZIP, {{using the same}} [...] ".zip" [...] algorithm that WinZip and other popular archivers now use); also other concepts of software distribution like freeware, postcardware like JPEGview and donationware like Red Ryder for the Macintosh first appeared on BBS sites. Doom from id Software and nearly all Apogee Software games were distributed as shareware (Apogee is, in fact, credited for adding an order form to a shareware demo). The Internet has largely erased the distinction of shareware - most users now download the software directly from the developer's website rather than receiving it from another BBS user 'sharing' it. Today shareware is commonly used to mean electronically <b>distributed</b> <b>software</b> from a small developer.|$|E

50|$|Mixing Agile {{software}} development and <b>Distributed</b> <b>Software</b> Development brings {{a lot of}} challenges to the team communication. On one hand, Agile {{software development}} demands an increase for informal communication and lacks formal communication, like documentation. On the other hand, <b>Distributed</b> <b>Software</b> Development {{makes it difficult to}} initiate communication, can lead to misunderstandings and increases the communication cost (time, money, etc) as explained previously #Challenges, which can lead to a decrease on the frequency of communication. This makes the area of study presented of utter importance in Agile <b>Distributed</b> <b>Software</b> Development. One of its core principles emphasizes the relationships between individuals and their interactions, entailing constant communication.|$|E

50|$|The {{free and}} open source {{software}} movement was founded in the 1980s to solve the underlying problem of unofficial patches, the limited possibility for user self-support in binary only <b>distributed</b> <b>software</b> due to missing source code. Free and open source software demands from <b>distributed</b> <b>software</b> the availability of source code, which prevents the technical problems and legal uncertainties of binary only user patching of proprietary software.|$|E
