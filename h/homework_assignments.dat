The <b>homework</b> <b>assignment</b> outlines procedures that can be used to: access insured commercial bank data for a specific state, create a chart to plot return on assets by the natural log of total assets, and run a regression of return on assets as a function of the natural log of total assets using Microsoft Excel. ...|$|R
2500|$|An {{additional}} cognitively-based {{model of}} substance abuse recovery has been offered by Aaron Beck, the father of cognitive therapy and championed in his 1993 book [...] Cognitive Therapy of Substance Abuse. This therapy rests upon the assumption addicted individuals possess core beliefs, often not accessible to immediate consciousness (unless the patient is also depressed). These core beliefs, such as [...] "I am undesirable," [...] activate a system of addictive beliefs that result in imagined anticipatory benefits of substance use and, consequentially, craving. Once craving has been activated, permissive beliefs ("I can handle getting high just this one more time") are facilitated. Once a permissive set of beliefs have been activated, then the individual will activate drug-seeking and drug-ingesting behaviors. The cognitive therapist's job is to uncover this underlying system of beliefs, analyze it with the patient, and thereby demonstrate its dysfunctionality. As with any cognitive-behavioral therapy, <b>homework</b> <b>assignments</b> and behavioral exercises serve to solidify what is learned and discussed during treatment.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are many}} uses for {{podcasting}} for the classroom. They {{can be used}} to convey instructional information from the teacher or trainer, motivational stories, and auditory case studies. [...] Podcasts can also be used by the learners as artifacts and evidence of learning; for example, a student might prepare a brief podcast as a summary of a concept in lieu of writing an essay. [...] Podcasts can also be used as a means of self-reflection on the learning processes or products. Podcasts can help keep students on the same page, including those that are absent! Absent students can use your podcasts to see class lectures, daily activities, <b>homework</b> <b>assignments,</b> handouts, and more. A review of literature that reports the use of audio podcasts in K-12 and higher education found that individuals (1) use existing podcasts and/or (2) create their own podcasts. Students can create their own podcast to share their learning experiences with each other and also with other students from other schools.|$|E

5000|$|In 1984, RCA {{assistant}} principal (and current school administrator) Dwight Ausley {{was found guilty}} of child abuse, after he paddled a ten-year-old student who failed to complete a <b>homework</b> <b>assignment.</b> School officials stated the paddling was due to the child's defiant behavior when confronted by the teacher and not due to the missed <b>homework</b> <b>assignment.</b> When the child's mother complained to then RCA principal Richard Tippett about the punishment of her child which left bruises for three weeks, Tippett responded by giving her a taped sermon by Pastor Randy Cox (then pastor of the church associated with Raleigh Christian Academy). In the sermon, Pastor Cox paraphrased a passage from the Bible by stating, [...] "Better a son dead than disobedient." [...] This account has been disputed by the school. During the trial, District Attorney Deborah Shandles stated that [...] "the child lost his breath and lost his balance and he (Ausley) was so engrossed in the beating he did not notice.... He chose to beat a 10-year-old child to teach him a lesson he would not forget for a long time, all for a <b>homework</b> <b>assignment.</b> That is not an accident, that is malice." ...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: This study aims to {{identify}} the effect of factors including <b>homework</b> <b>assignment</b> given within semesters, class attendance {{and the type of}} high school graduated on vocational college students’ academic achievements in the Corporate Accounting course. Design/methodology/approach: In order to determine the sample’ understanding level on the topic of stock corporations which is a subtopic in Corporate Accounting course, a test consisting of 20 multiple-choice questions was prepared by the researchers. The reliability of the test was determined as 0. 84 by using the formula “KR- 20 ”. Causal - comparative research design was used in scope of the study. The data obtained was analyzed by using independent samples t-test, ANOVA and regression. Findings: Upon the analyses carried out, it was found out that academic achievement varies depending on the <b>homework</b> <b>assignment</b> given within the period and class attendance hours of the student. When the joint effect of the factors on academic achievement was examined, it was seen that only the <b>homework</b> <b>assignment</b> factor has a significant effect. Research limitations/implications: This study only examined the Corporate Accounting course which is studied by the students of Accounting and Tax Applications Department in one vocational college in Turkey. In this study, used variables that are thought to be related with the academic achievement and on which unbiased data can be collected were preferred. Originality/Value: In the studies so far, the effects of the related variables on academic achievement have been examined one by one. This study determines the common effect of multiple variables used in this study called <b>homework</b> <b>assignment,</b> class attendance and the type of high school graduated on academic achievement. In this way, {{it will be possible to}} learn the variables that are more influential on academic achievement within a single study...|$|R
