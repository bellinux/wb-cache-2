Etruscan religion, however, emphasized the role that Juno (as Uni) played in endowing Hercle with his divine nature through the drinking of her breast milk.|$|E

In their view, the United States want to break up Russia and turn it into a source of raw materials. The West being accused of Russophobia is a major part of their belief.|$|E

Built in 1921, the pedestal is 1.8 m high and the sculptures reach 2.7 m. They depict a woman in folk costume embodying the Fatherland, with her right hand raised in salute and her left holding the standard; a soldier and a woman sitting before her, the latter with an open book on <b>her</b> <b>knees</b> <b>and</b> representing History.

Liebeck was in the passenger's seat of a 1989 Ford Probe which did not have cup holders. Her grandson parked the car so that Liebeck could add cream and sugar to her coffee. Liebeck placed the coffee cup between <b>her</b> <b>knees</b> <b>and</b> pulled {{the far side of}} the lid toward her to remove it. In the process, she spilled the entire cup of coffee on her lap. Liebeck was wearing cotton sweatpants; they absorbed the coffee and held it against her skin, scalding her thighs, buttocks, and groin.|$|E
25|$|Julie Foudy, Kristine Lilly, and the 1999 team {{started a}} {{revolution}} towards women's team sports in America. Arguably their most influential and memorable victory {{came in the}} 1999 World Cup when they defeated China 5–4 in a penalty shoot-out following a 0–0 draw after extended time. With this win they emerged onto the world stage and brought significant media attention to women's soccer and athletics. On July 10, 1999, over 90,000 people (the largest ever for a women's sporting event {{and one of the}} largest attendances in the world for a tournament game final) filled the Rose Bowl to watch the United States play China in the Final. After a back and forth game, the score was tied 0–0 at full-time, and remained so after extra time, leading to a penalty kick shootout. With Briana Scurry's save of China's third kick, the score was 4–4 with only Brandi Chastain left to shoot. She scored and won the game for the United States. Chastain famously dropped to <b>her</b> <b>knees</b> <b>and</b> whipped off her shirt, celebrating in her sports bra, which later made the cover of Sports Illustrated and the front pages of newspapers around the country and world. This win influenced girls to want to play soccer on a team.|$|E

[...] He may have already {{suspected}} the affair was a hoax and observed that Toft seemed to press <b>her</b> <b>knees</b> <b>and</b> thighs together, as if to prevent something from [...] "dropping down". [...] He thought Howard's behaviour just as suspicious, as the man-midwife would not let him help deliver the rabbits—although Ahlers was not a man-midwife and in an earlier attempt had apparently put Toft through considerable pain. [...] Convinced the affair was a hoax, he lied, telling those involved that he believed Toft's story, before making his excuses and returning to London, taking specimens of the rabbits with him. [...] Upon closer study, he reportedly found evidence of them having been cut with a man-made instrument, and noted pieces of straw and grain in their droppings.|$|E

Shortly after returning from Paris in 1999, she had been hospitalized with a high fever and blood clots in her legs. A few months after being released from the hospital, she became increasingly unable to bend <b>her</b> <b>knees,</b> <b>and</b> underwent surgery to replace her knees with titanium and plastic prosthetics. She wrote, [...] "The doctor who knows me best says that osteoarthritis begins long before it cripples [...] in my case, possibly from homelessness, or sexual abuse, or beatings on my legs, or my weight. John, my partner, blames Scapegoat, a study of Jewish identity and women's liberation that took me nine years to write; it is, he says, the book that stole my health. I blame the drug-rape that I experienced in 1999 in Paris." ...|$|E

500|$|When {{designing}} Sakura, Kishimoto {{focused on}} her silhouette and created a costume as simple as possible. This is a divergence from the other main characters of the series, whose costumes are very detailed. The leggings are the most notable aspect of her design, as they are meant to show that she is very active. At {{the start of the}} series her leggings extended below <b>her</b> <b>knees</b> <b>and</b> closely resembled trousers. As Part I progressed, the leggings became increasingly shorter and tighter. Similar to his inexperience with drawing heroines, Kishimoto lacked the experience needed to make Sakura [...] "cute" [...] when he first began drawing her. Although he implies that her appearance has become cuter since then, Kishimoto and much of the Naruto manga staff agree that Sakura was [...] "far from cute" [...] {{at the start of the}} series. In retrospective, he found Sakura one of the hardest character to draw alongside Sasuke. Kishimoto first planned Sasuke and Sakura's romance in early production of Naruto. In regards to Sakura's feelings to Sasuke, Kishimoto tried to write them as realistic as possible but ended getting complaints from young girls about her.|$|E

Towards {{the end of the}} performance, she fell to <b>her</b> <b>knees</b> <b>and</b> shook the hands of audience members. The performance earned her a standing ovation from the judges and members of the crowd. A writer from The Huffington Post called it [...] "an epic, emotionally-charged performance" [...] and praised the fact that Beyoncé [...] "channel every particle of the room's energy into her lung-bursting calls and cries." [...] Jillian Mapes of Billboard magazine noted, [...] "The sheer force of the ballad literally brought [...] to her knees during the performance." [...] Shortly after Beyoncé's performance on American Idol, a video that surfaced online received considerable coverage from music critics. It became an instant viral video as soon as it hit the web. The clip was filmed using a camera phone and it shows Beyoncé rehearsing [...] "1+1" [...] backstage at American Idol with no microphone and simple keyboard accompaniment. The video was filmed by Beyoncé'ss husband, Jay-Z. In an introduction to the video on his Life + Times website he wrote: [...] "Sometimes you need perspective. You've been right in front of greatness so often that you need to step back and see it again for the first time." [...] In 2013, John Boone and Jennifer Cady of E!

500|$|The {{music video}} {{opens with a}} pair of jealous {{strippers}} applying lipstick and caddying back-and-forth between backstage, in a South of the Border strip zoo named [...] "La Jungla". Meanwhile, Mars' [...] "Money Make Her Smile" [...] can be heard from the room, the two of them are talking about a new girl who has been [...] "fooling around" [...] with someone else's man (Mr. Mars). The scene ends with one of the two women saying, [...] "Wait 'til I tell the boss what she's sleeping with". It is shown that the new girl, Isabella, has been listening to the conversation and it's her time to dance as soon as the boss says so. The role of Isabella is portrayed by Indian actress Freida Pinto, who after an introduction by Guzmán, the zoo owner, starts to pull off [...] "gravity-defying spins on the pole" [...] as Mars and his mates, who serve as the house band, perform the song. On the following scene, Isabella sheds her clothes with such rage that sparks fall from the ceiling while Mars stares at her intensely singing [...] "You and me baby making love like gorillas". As the second verse starts, intermittent shots of Mars and Isabella [...] "heating up the backseat of a car" [...] along with shots of her [...] "grinding on customers" [...] and banging on Mars' chest as he sings the line [...] "Bang Bang, Gorilla". The former shots are shown throughout the video. As the video continues, Isabella is shown [...] "to drop on <b>her</b> <b>knees</b> <b>and</b> lick" [...] Mars' guitar. She grabs it and pours tequila over the same, before using a lighter to set it on fire. Afterwards, the roof sprinklers come on and Isabella lets the water shower her while she stands on her underwear. The video ends in a chase scene in which Mars runs down through a dimly lit aisle, and suddenly transforms into a giant gorilla, while Isabella is seen {{at the end of the}} pathway waiting for him. The video doesn't contain any of the teasers Mars released days before the video, including the iguana shot, the outer car scene and the one with Luis Guzman listening to the intro for Isabella.|$|E
