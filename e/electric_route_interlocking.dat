50|$|El Sereno's {{population}} rose markedly as {{the country}} prepared for the war. Because of rationing of gas and rubber, most new residents who came {{to work at the}} aircraft and munitions factories in Los Angeles moved to communities along the Pacific <b>Electric</b> <b>routes.</b> EI Sereno experienced major industrial growth during the war years. Many of the families that moved here at the time were Italian-American. The rise in population led to the construction of the El Sereno Theatre at 3333 Eastern Avenue; it was the third theater in the community.|$|R
50|$|In the Great Merger of 1911, the {{southern}} {{portion of the}} Redondo Railway were given over to the Pacific Electric Railway, while the northern portion {{became part of the}} Los Angeles Railway. The Hawthorne Line, as it was then called, terminated at the intersection of Hawthorne Boulevard and Broadway in the heart of Hawthorne, where one could transfer to two Pacific <b>Electric</b> <b>routes.</b> At some point in the 1910s, this route was merged with the Eagle Rock Line {{to become one of the}} longest streetcar routes in the United States.|$|R
50|$|In 1904, {{the first}} power plant was built. The city {{installed}} electric street lamps and, in 1908, opened the first <b>electric</b> tram <b>route.</b> In 1914, a third bridge opened—Most Józefa Poniatowskiego.|$|R

50|$|The Red Electric {{substation}} in Lake Oswego {{was later}} converted into apartments {{that are still}} in use today. The Forest Grove depot was purchased by a grass seed broker in 1948 and still exists today. The McMinnville Red Electric depot, similar in structure to the Forest Grove depot, is still in operation, as is the Hillsboro depot. They {{are the only two}} original depots that still exist on the old Red <b>Electric</b> <b>route.</b> As of 1994, the former substation in Dundee was being used as a garage. The abandoned substation in McCoy, built in 1916, still exists.|$|R
50|$|The {{station was}} once {{the eastern end of}} both the Outer Circle line and the Rosstown Railway. In 1975, the signal box was {{provided}} with a <b>route</b> setting power <b>interlocking</b> system, which also included the demolition of signalbox A.|$|R
50|$|From 1949 a {{modernisation}} programme saw the <b>electric</b> tram <b>routes</b> {{being replaced}} by trolleybuses, commencing with the Herne Bay route and with trolleybuses eventually replicating the entire network by December 1956 when the last electric tram ran.|$|R
50|$|Signalling {{systems are}} also being {{upgraded}} by adopting state-of-the-art technology. The semaphore signalling system is being replaced by a colour light signalling system. Use of colour light signals results in better visibility of signalling aspects to the drivers of the running trains and this makes train running safer and operationally more efficient. The interlocking system is also being changed to panel or <b>route</b> relay <b>interlocking.</b> Besides speedier movement of traffic, these up-gradation measures contribute towards increased safety.|$|R
50|$|Eindhoven Airport {{is located}} {{just off the}} A2 {{motorway}} which offers direct connections {{to the west and}} south of the country, including the cities of Amsterdam, Utrecht and Maastricht. The airport is also served by two of Eindhoven's <b>electric</b> bus <b>routes.</b>|$|R
50|$|A track {{providing}} {{service at}} the museum is identified by the Maryland Transit Administration as Route 25. At one time, the United Railways and <b>Electric</b> Company <b>routes</b> was the Route 25 line on Falls Road, past the current site of the Museum.|$|R
50|$|Bus transit {{service to}} and within Capitol Hill is {{provided}} by King County Metro, including <b>electric</b> trolleybus <b>routes</b> 10, 12, 43 and 49 of the Seattle trolleybus system. The First Hill Streetcar line, which opened in January 2016, terminates in the neighborhood.|$|R
50|$|The {{station is}} a {{terminal}} station; trains {{must go back}} {{the same way as}} they come. With many trains arriving at the same time platforms are not always available. In case any train is late, the other trains are stopped at Duvvada or Vizianagaram. The <b>Route</b> Relay <b>Interlocking</b> (RRI) system, an arrangement of signal apparatus that prevents conflicting movements through an arrangement of tracks such as junctions or crossings, is reported {{to be one of the}} major causes for these trains being delayed after Duvvada Station.|$|R
50|$|Justin Orvis and Robert Wynn founded this railroad. They {{originally}} {{envisioned a}} 75-mile (120-kilometer) <b>electric</b> <b>route</b> throughout Lake and McHenry counties, {{but this was}} the only stretch developed. The route delivered freight and commuters to these communities, as well as vacationers to Dr. Wilson's Deer Grove Park picnic grounds (now Deer Grove Forest Preserve). The railroad had many problems due to secondhand equipment and the steep trestle built to cross the Elgin, Joliet and Eastern in Lake Zurich. The most famous engine on this route was nicknamed 'Old Maud' and was purchased from the Chicago and North Western Railway.The railroad opened on 25 August 1912 and closed in 1924. Financial mismanagement, the improvement of local roads {{and the rise of the}} automobile helped bring down this route.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} of cable tram lines to St Kilda {{station in the}} 1890s further increased {{the numbers of people}} with easier access to the beach. In 1911, the <b>electric</b> tram <b>route</b> to Malvern along Carlisle Street was completed, and the route was extended to Kew in 1913.|$|R
30|$|With the aim {{of obtaining}} precise times of the itineraries in the installation, a {{parametric}} model of the section has been implemented using a simulation tool. This tool allows modelling line profile data and track topology as well as rolling stock and the <b>routes</b> for each <b>interlocking</b> of the line.|$|R
40|$|Now a day, {{managing}} the train movement between various stations in a railway division {{has become a}} herculean task involving manual labour and data transfer through phone calls and record entries. The train is needed to be constantly signalled at each station the train crosses by, with the flag master waving the green flag and being reciprocated by the respective guard under duty. The signalling will be {{under the control of}} respective stations but can be signalled only after proper authentication from the Signals & Telecommunication department in a divisional Railway under various Zones. The main objective of our project is to develop a system which automatically defines the signalling of the train on a particular track line automatically by establishing optical sensors at particular intervals along the track length and by taking the feedback from the sensors, the signalling will be done by the logic written in the micro controller programming and a the movement of the trains can be monitored in a display at the <b>Route</b> Relay <b>Interlocking</b> department and the Signals & Telecommunications department. The project highlights the concepts of {{managing the}} trains between stations by developing a simulation through microcontroller with the feedback from the sensors. The project concludes with a real time simulation of the train management system on a LCD in <b>route</b> relay <b>interlocking</b> pane...|$|R

5000|$|In 1925, the Teatro Municipal {{was opened}} {{in its current}} {{location}} in the eastern front of the city's downtown square, Plaza de Viña del Mar. In 1928 president Carlos Ibáñez del Campo authorized {{the creation of a}} casino, securing the future and the touristy character of the city. The Casino Municipal de Viña del Mar was opened on December 31, 1930. [...] On January 31, 1931, the Presidential Palace was inaugurated in Cerro Castillo (Castle Hill) as a summer residence for the Chilean President. The touristy character of the city was furthered with the inauguration of the O'Higgins Hotel in 1936 and the inauguration of the Miramar Hotel by Caleta Abarca Beach in 1945. For a few years in the early 1960s, a trolleybus line connected the city with Valparaíso, and the <b>electric</b> <b>route</b> network included three branches within Viña.|$|R
50|$|The {{station is}} served by 5 {{platforms}}. Platforms 1, 2 and 3 are used for trains going towards Shoranur, Thrissur and Palakkad Town where as platforms 4 and 5 are mainly used for trains going towards Podanur side. Operational efficiency of Palakkad Railway Junction, which functions as a gateway to Kerala, has improved with the completion of yard remodeling and other modernisation works. The electronic interlocking system, which will replace the prevailing <b>route</b> relay <b>interlocking</b> system, was also completed. The train traffic in the junction will be considerably high once the trains from Pollachi Junction enter here.|$|R
