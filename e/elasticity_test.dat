The objective {{of the study was to}} determine and compare the differences in properties of concrete containing no fibres and concrete with fibres, as well as the comparison on the effects of different type and geometry of fibres to the concrete. This investigation was carried out using several tests, which included workability test, compressive test, indirect tensile test, flexural test and modulus of <b>elasticity</b> <b>test.</b> A total of ten mix batches of concrete containing 0 %, 0. 5 %, 1. 0 % and 1. 5 % fibre volume dosage rate on 'wave cut' steel fibres, high performance polypropylene fibres and Fibremesh were tested to determine the enhancement of mechanical properties of concrete. The workability of concrete significantly reduced as the fibre dosage rate increases. This was assessed through standard slump test, compacting factor test and VEBE consistometer test. Results of compressive strength test indicated that the use of fibre in concrete might not efficiently increase in strength. In flexural and indirect tensile test showed specimens with fibres that drastic increase in strength from specimens without fibres. A moderate increase in modulus of elasticity of the fibre reinforced concrete was indicated in modulus of <b>elasticity</b> <b>test.</b> The usage of fibres were fully utilised when it comes to post-cracking stage, as it increase on ductility and toughness of concrete. This was examined through the load/deformation curve of flexural strength test and stress/strain diagram of modulus of <b>elasticity</b> <b>test.</b> It was found that different type and geometry of fibres influence the mechanical properties of concrete in a different manner. As to create a cost efficient fibre reinforced structure, these changes on fibres are vital to the design and construction. However, further investigations were highly recommended and should be carried out to understand more mechanical properties of fibre reinforced concrete...|$|E

A big part of this is that the cementing operations are performed in a best possible manner, and having a good quality cement contributes in that regard. This thesis has explored the effects of using nano-silica as an additive to see how it affects the cement properties. The method to investigate this has been experimental. The focus of the experiments has been on parameters affecting the possibility of gas migration in the annulus. Gas migration was in 2005 responsible for 25 percent of the failures in primary cementing jobs. More specifically, elasticity and shrinkage were the parameters that were investigated. The <b>elasticity</b> <b>tests</b> have been performed for two, seven and fourteen days cure time at various mixtures. The shrinkage experiments measured shrinkage for 24 hours of cure time. The testing should optimally have been performed under in-situ well conditions, but as this was not possible it was emphasized that all the tests were conducted under the same conditions to get comparable results. In total, 72 samples has been made and <b>tested</b> for the <b>elasticity</b> <b>tests.</b> These were divided between 11 different cement mixtures. For the shrinkage experiment time limitations made it not possible to get test results for all cement mixtures. In total, six of the mixtures were tested for shrinkage. The results have indicated that the addition of nano-silica affects the cement properties. Most noticeable has been alteration of the viscosity of the cement slurry and early strength development. However, after fourteen days cure time the testing showed that the neat cement had improved significantly in quality, and was now giving among the best test results. For the shrinkage experiment the results suggested that nano-silica addition did not give favorable cement properties. Summarized, no nano-silica cement mixture proved favorable compared to the neat cement based on results from all the experiments. </p...|$|R
