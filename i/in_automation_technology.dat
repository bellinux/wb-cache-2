Modern positioners are equipped with self-adaptation i.e. the positioning behaviour is monitored and continuously optimised via controller parameters.|$|E

40|$|As yet the {{so-called}} "plug and produce" technique <b>in</b> <b>automation</b> <b>technology</b> - {{which is an}} adaptation of the well-known "plug and play" technique - {{has not yet been}} fully achieved, even though it is continually in demand and often proposed. One of the main reasons for this is the complexity of the communication media used in these systems. Modern communication media implement complex and multilayered interfaces between the devices involved. These interfaces depend not only upon the communication medium but also upon the architecture of control and the degree of centralization employed. In order to getting one step closer to the goal of "plug and produce", an integrated information model for automation technology is needed. This model must offer a functional view of the devices involved and the communication objectives provided by these devices. By comparing device description languages that exist <b>in</b> <b>automation</b> <b>technology</b> and their underlying information models, it turned out that none of these concepts has the ability to map functional connections and dependencies. Therefore this thesis proposes an information model for functional typification of devices used <b>in</b> <b>automation</b> <b>technology.</b> In this model it is possible to describe functional dependencies across the boundaries between devices. It is also possible to provide a functional perspective upon these devices, including engineering tools, even when they are being used offline. This model can be used at a functional level to test whether the communication objectives needed by an application are enabled by the devices in question. In addition, two methods have been developed that may also be of use outside the scope of this thesis. One method can be used to compare description languages by deriving the underlying information model. The description languages are then compared {{to the level of the}} model. One benefit of this method is that it is possible to develop methods of translating the various description languages. In this way it is possible to construct the relationships between objects in different description languages and also find out what objects cannot be mapped...|$|E

40|$|Swedish {{wood product}} {{industry}} contributes {{significantly to the}} economy of the country. This industry adds more value to the sawn timber produced in order to manufacture different wooden products. Companies in Swedish wood product industry are presently seen as underdeveloped in terms of investments and developments <b>in</b> <b>automation</b> <b>technologies.</b> <b>Automation</b> <b>technologies</b> are seen by companies as a solution for improving productivity, product quality, manufacturing cost reduction and ultimately improving competitiveness. This has driven competing companies to pursue <b>automation</b> <b>technologies</b> that improve manufacturing processes. Literature in the Wood product industry field shows that there is need for extended <b>automation</b> <b>technologies.</b> The wood product industry has high degree of handcraft; for instance, some Swedish wood product manufacturers still have an essentially manual manufacturing process. This study seeks to understand the role of <b>automation</b> <b>in</b> the Swedish wood product industry and mainly focuses on the factors that drive and restrain companies in this industry to adopt and use <b>automation</b> <b>technologies.</b> An abductive research approach was applied, consisting of a literature review and multiple empirical case studies. The literature review was conducted to provide theoretical background on the general view of automation and the factors that affect adoption of new technologies in companies. The case studies were performed in collaboration with four wood product manufacturers within different business areas in order to analyse and compare similarities and differences in the factors that drive and restrain adoption of <b>automation</b> <b>technologies.</b> The findings imply that companies in the Swedish wood product industry face different factors that drive and restrain them from adopting <b>automation</b> <b>technologies.</b> The factors are both internal and external to the companies.

Results We developed a set of flexible open source computational tools in the R package flowCore to facilitate the analysis of these complex data. A key component of which is having suitable data structures that support the application of similar operations to a collection of samples or a clinical cohort. In addition, our software constitutes a shared and extensible research platform that enables collaboration between bioinformaticians, computer scientists, statisticians, biologists and clinicians. This platform will foster the development of novel analytic methods for flow cytometry. Conclusion The software has been applied in the analysis of various data sets and its data structures have proven to be highly efficient in capturing and organizing the analytic work flow. Finally, a number of additional Bioconductor packages successfully build on the infrastructure provided by flowCore, open new avenues for flow data analysis. </p...|$|R
