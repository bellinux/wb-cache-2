40|$|In this paper, a {{stabilized}} proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) reduced-order model (ROM) {{is presented}} for the barotropic vorticity equation. We apply the POD-ROM model to mid-latitude simplified oceanic basins, which are standard prototypes of more realistic large-scale ocean dynamics. A mode dependent eddy viscosity closure scheme {{is used to}} model {{the effects of the}} discarded POD modes. A sensitivity analysis with respect to the <b>free</b> <b>eddy</b> viscosity stabilization parameter is performed for various POD-ROMs with different numbers of POD modes. The POD-ROM results are validated against the Munk layer resolving direct numerical simulations using a fully conservative fourth-order Arakawa scheme. A comparison with the standard Galerkin POD-ROM without any stabilization is also included in our investigation. Significant improvements in the accuracy over the standard Galerkin model are shown for a four-gyre ocean circulation problem. This first step in the numerical assessment of the POD-ROM shows that it could represent a computationally efficient tool for large scale oceanic simulations over long time intervals...|$|E
40|$|The uniform {{streaming}} Stokes {{flow past}} two equal separated cylinders is consi-dered where {{the direction of}} flow is perpendicular to the line joining the centres. Because of Stokes's paradox, the problem reduces to solving for the first term of the inner expansion for low Reynolds number flow past two cylinders. It is found that fluid always moves through the gap separating the two cylinders {{no matter how small}} it is. When the gap width is less than 0. 0446 times the cylinder radius, two <b>free</b> <b>eddies</b> form along the center line, one {{on either side of the}} gap. These eddies are completely isolated from the cylinder boundaries by the surrounding fluid and their appearance is a Stokes flow phenomenon not observed before. For smaller gaps-both <b>free</b> <b>eddies</b> and boundary eddies are present. These interlace as the cylinders approach forcing the fluid which moves through the gap to take a winding path. 1...|$|R

Within the entrainment zone, cleaner <b>free</b> troposphere <b>eddies</b> will mix with more polluted boundary layer eddies resulting in high variances at the height of the entrainment layer.

40|$|Based on reanalysis {{data for}} the years 1980 – 2001 from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ERA- 40 data), a {{climatology}} of tropospheric zonal-mean water vapor fields and fluxes in isen-tropic coordinates is presented. In the extratropical <b>free</b> troposphere, <b>eddy</b> fluxes dominate the meridional flux of specific humidity along isentropes. At all levels, isentropic eddy fluxes transport water vapor from the deep Tropics through the subtropics into the extratropics. Isentropic eddy fluxes of specific humidity diverge near the surface and in the tropical and subtropical free troposphere; they converge in the extra-tropical free troposphere. Isentropic mean advective fluxes of specific humidity play a secondary role in the meridional water vapor transport in the free troposphere; however, they dominate the meridional flux of specific humidity near the surface, where they transport water vapor equatorward and, in the solstice seasons, across the equator. Cross-isentropic mean advective fluxes of specific humidity are especially important in the Hadley circulation, in whose ascending branches they moisten and in whose descending branches they dry the free troposphere. Near the minima of zonal-mean relative humidity in the subtropical free troposphere, the divergence of the cross-isentropic mean advective flux of specific humidity in the descending branches of the Hadle...|$|R
40|$|To {{design and}} {{evaluate}} eddy current-nulled convex optimized diffusion encoding (EN-CODE) gradient waveforms for efficient diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) that is <b>free</b> of <b>eddy</b> current-induced image distortions. The EN-CODE framework {{was used to}} generate diffusion-encoding waveforms that are eddy current-compensated. The EN-CODE DTI waveform was compared with the existing eddy current-nulled twice refocused spin echo (TRSE) sequence as well as monopolar (MONO) and non-eddy current-compensated CODE in terms of echo time (TE) and image distortions. Comparisons were made in simulations, phantom experiments, and neuro imaging in 10 healthy volunteers. The EN-CODE sequence achieved eddy current compensation with a significantly shorter TE than TRSE (78 versus 96 ms) and a slightly shorter TE than MONO (78 versus 80 ms). Intravoxel signal variance was lower in phantoms with EN-CODE than with MONO (13. 6 [*]±[*] 11. 6 versus 37. 4 [*]±[*] 25. 8) and not different from TRSE (15. 1 [*]±[*] 11. 6), indicating good robustness to eddy current-induced image distortions. Mean fractional anisotropy values in brain edges were also significantly lower with EN-CODE than with MONO (0. 16 [*]±[*] 0. 01 versus 0. 24 [*]±[*] 0. 02, P[*]<[*] 1 x 10 (- 5)) and not different from TRSE (0. 16 [*]±[*] 0. 01 versus 0. 16 [*]±[*] 0. 01, P[*]=[*]nonsignificant). The EN-CODE sequence eliminated eddy current-induced image distortions in DTI with a TE comparable to MONO and substantially shorter than TRSE.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the analysis of}} four different methods for generating synthetic turbulence, and {{the implementation of the}} methods into HYDRA CFD Code. These methods are the synthetic eddy method (SEM) by Jarrin, divergence <b>free</b> synthetic <b>eddy</b> method (DFSEM) by Poletto, synthetic fluctuations by Davidson, and a spectral method for generating fluctuations by Batten. The SEM and the DFSEM are stochastic algorithms that use the view of turbulence as a superposition of eddies, whereas the last two methods use the Fourier space to describe turbulence in terms of wavenumbers. The motivation of this work is the growing interest of using unsteady simulations, in particular large eddy simulations (LES), in engineering applications, and the computational issues that come with it. In order to use LES, instantaneous inlet velocities are needed as turbulent in flow boundary conditions. These boundary conditions will be given by synthetic turbulence, generated by the four methods mentioned. The object is to trigger the equations to start resolve turbulence. The methods are first implemented in C and investigated in terms of correlation in space and time for the generated turbulence. It is shown that all of the methods generated fluctuations with proper correlation in time and space. Next, the SEM, the DFSEM, and the synthetic fluctuations method are implemented into the CFD programming language HYDRA CFD Code. Last, the implementation of the SEM and the DFSEM is further investigated through a channel flow simulation in HYDRA, where the two methods are used for generating inlet conditions. The results from these simulations show that the SEM and the DFSEM produces fluctuations that remain throughout the channel...|$|R
50|$|Collingwood {{dominated}} the second quarter. They won the clearances 16-6, {{and won the}} inside-50s 21-5, giving St Kilda almost no opportunity to score. Overall, Collingwood managed ten shots at goal, but took many from long distance, which affected their overall accuracy: their total score for the quarter was 3.6 (24) with one out on the full. Goals were scored by Cloke in the 3rd minute, Macaffer in the 18th minute from a holding the ball <b>free</b> kick against <b>Eddy</b> and 50-metre penalty against Ray, and O'Brien in the 26th minute; of their remaining shots, three fell short and were touched or rushed for behinds, while Cloke missed two relatively easy shots—one from a 25m set shot directly in front and one from a snap shot 30m out—in the final two minutes of the quarter. So dominant was Collingwood {{in the second quarter}} that St Kilda managed only two shots on goal, both set shots from outside 50m: one goal to Koschitzke in the 12th minute, and one from Peake in the 21st minute which fell short and was rebounded.|$|R
40|$|The role of eddy fluxes in {{the general}} {{circulation}} is often approached by treating eddies as (macro) turbulence. In this approach, the eddies act to diffuse certain quasiconservative quantities, such as potential vorticity (PV), along isentropic surfaces in the <b>free</b> atmosphere. The <b>eddy</b> fluxes are determined primarily by the eddy diffusivities and are necessarily down-gradient of the basic state PV field. Support for the (macro) turbulence approach {{stems from the fact}} that the eddy fluxes of PV in the free atmosphere are generally down-gradient in the long-term mean. Here we call attention to a pronounced and significant region of upgradient eddy PV fluxes on the poleward flank of the jet core in both hemispheres. The region of up-gradient (i. e., notionally “antidiffusive”) eddy PV fluxes is most pronounced during the winter and spring seasons and partially contradicts the turbulence approach described above. Analyses of the PV variance (potential enstrophy) budget suggest that the up-gradient PV fluxes represent local wave decay and are maintained by poleward fluxes of PV variance. Finite-amplitude effects thus represent leading order contributions to the PV variance budget, whereas dissipation is only of secondary importance locally. The appearance of up-gradient PV fluxes in the long-term mean is associated with the poleward shift of the jet—and thus the region of wave decay relative to wave growth—following wave-breaking events...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} the pole-to-pole surface {{temperature}} difference on the deep stratification {{and the strength of}} the global meridional overturning circulation (MOC) is examined in an eddy-resolving ocean model configured in an idealized domain roughly representing the Atlantic sector. Mesoscale eddies lead to qualitative differences in the mean stratification and the MOC compared to laminar (i. e., <b>eddy</b> <b>free)</b> models. For example, the spreading of fluid across the model’s representation of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) no longer relies on the existence of a sill in the ACC. In addition, the deep- and bottom-water masses— roughly representing North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) and Antarctic Bottom Water (ABW), respectively—are eroded by the eddies so that their zonal and meridional extents are much smaller than in the laminar case. It is found that if the north pole temperature is sufficiently warm, the formation of northern deep water is suppressed and the middepth cell is small and weak while the deep cell is large and vigorous. In contrast, if the north pole temperature is in the range of the southern channel temperatures, the middepth cell is large and strong while the deep cell has a reduced amplitude. This result is consistent with the predictions of the laminar theory of the MOC. In contrast to the laminar theory, realistically strong deep stratification is formed even if the temperature at the northern sinking site is warmer than any temperature found in the channel. Indeed, middepth stratification is actually stronger in the latter case than the former case. 1...|$|R
