5|$|Naming is a {{symbolic}} {{tradition of the}} islands' Maori population. Names form a link not only to ancestors, descendents, and friends, but to titles and land, as well as events and relationships. Dreamed or created, name change {{are not limited to}} events, such as birth, marriage, and death, but can also occur in association with a bad omen. First names are interchangeable between men and women, while surnames can vary <b>from</b> <b>person</b> <b>to</b> person within a family unit.|$|E
5|$|Poliovirus {{is usually}} spread <b>from</b> <b>person</b> <b>to</b> person through {{infected}} fecal matter entering the mouth. It {{may also be}} spread by food or water containing human feces and less commonly from infected saliva. Those who are infected may spread the disease {{for up to six}} weeks even if no symptoms are present. The disease may be diagnosed by finding the virus in the feces or detecting antibodies against it in the blood. The disease only occurs naturally in humans.|$|E
5|$|Viral {{epidemiology}} is {{the branch}} of medical science that deals with the transmission and control of virus infections in humans. Transmission of viruses can be vertical, which means from mother to child, or horizontal, which means <b>from</b> <b>person</b> <b>to</b> person. Examples of vertical transmission include hepatitis B virus and HIV, where the baby is born already infected with the virus. Another, more rare, example is the varicella zoster virus, which, although causing relatively mild infections in humans, can be fatal to the foetus and newborn baby.|$|E

5|$|The {{reason for}} the rise of polio in industrialised {{countries}} in the 20th century has never been fully explained. The disease {{is caused by a}} virus that is passed <b>from</b> <b>person</b> <b>to</b> person by the faecal-oral route, and naturally infects only humans. It is a paradox that it became a problem during times of improved sanitation and increasing affluence. Although the virus was discovered {{at the beginning of the}} 20th century, its ubiquity was unrecognised until the 1950s. It is now known that fewer than two per cent of individuals who are infected develop the disease, and most infections are mild. During epidemics the virus was effectively everywhere, which explains why public health officials were unable to isolate a source.|$|E

40|$|The {{basis for}} the age-associated defect in the {{response}} of lymphocytes to plant lectins has been studied. Using three independent assays we {{have shown that the}} number of mitogen-responsive cells is markedly reduced in lymphocyte preparations <b>from</b> old <b>persons.</b> In addition, studies using colchicine bloock and thymidine pulse techniques have revealed a failure of mitogen-responsive cells <b>from</b> old <b>persons</b> <b>to</b> expand into a proliferating pool of lymphocytes as is observed when lymphocytes <b>from</b> young <b>persons</b> are cultured with phytohemagglutinin. Thus, the impaired response of lymphocytes <b>from</b> old <b>persons</b> <b>to</b> mitogens is attributable to a reduced number of mitogen responsive cells and their failure to undergo clonal expansion...|$|R
