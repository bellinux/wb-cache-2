500|$|The {{impetus for}} what would {{become known as the}} Heroic Age of Antarctic <b>Exploration</b> <b>came</b> <b>in</b> 1893, when in a lecture to the Royal Geographical Society Professor Sir John Murray called for a {{resumption}} of Antarctic exploration: [...] "a steady, continuous, laborious and systematic exploration of the whole southern region". He followed this call with an appeal to British patriotism: [...] "Is the last great piece of maritime exploration on the surface of our Earth to be undertaken by Britons, or is it to be left to those who may be destined to succeed or supplant us on the Ocean?" [...] During the following quarter-century, fifteen expeditions from eight different nations rose to this challenge. In the patriotic spirit engendered by Murray's call, and under the influence of RGS president Sir Clements Markham, British endeavours in the following years gave particular weight to the achievement of new Farthest South records, and began to develop the character of a race for the South Pole.|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{an effort}} to {{understand}} the algorithmic limitations of computing by a swarm of robots, the {{research has focused on}} the minimal capabilities that allow a problem to be solved. The weakest of the commonly used models is Asynch where the autonomous mobile robots, endowed with visibility sensors (but otherwise unable to communicate), operate in Look-Compute-Move cycles performed asynchronously for each robot. The robots are often assumed (or required to be) oblivious: they keep no memory of observations and computations made in previous cycles. We consider the setting when the robots are dispersed in an anonymous and unlabeled graph, and they must perform the very basic task of exploration: within finite time every node must be visited by at least one robot and the robots must enter a quiescent state. The complexity measure of a solution is the number of robots used to perform the task. We study the case when the graph is an arbitrary tree and establish some unexpected results. We first prove that, in general, exploration cannot be done efficiently. More precisely we prove that there are n-node trees where Ω(n) robots are necessary; this holds even if the maximum degree is 4. On the other hand, we show that if the maximum degree is 3, it is possible to explore with only O(lognloglogn) robots. The proof of the result is constructive. We also prove that the size of the team used in our solution is asymptotically optimal: there are trees of degree 3, whose exploration requires Ω(lognloglogn) robots. Our final result shows that the difficulty <b>in</b> tree <b>exploration</b> <b>comes</b> <b>in</b> fact from the symmetries of the tree. Indeed, we show that, in order to explore trees that do not have any non-trivial automorphisms, 4 robots are always sufficient and often necessary...|$|R
40|$|The Epiphenomenal Mind {{is both a}} deflationary {{attack on}} {{the powers of the}} human mind and a defence of human subjectivity. It is deflationary because in the thesis I argue that {{consciousness}} is an epiphenomenal consequence of events in the brain. It is a defence of human subjectivity because I argue that the mind is sui generis real, irreducible, and largely an endogenous product (i. e. not dependent on society or its resources). Part I is devoted to arguing that the conscious mind is epiphenomenal. Arguing from, the irreducibility of mental states, the causal closure of the physical domain, and the principle of causal explanatory exclusion, I seek to demonstrate that all theories of mental causation necessarily violate {{one or more of these}} premises. Contemporary approaches to mental causation come under two broad categories, those that argue that mental events are supervenient on physical events (such as Davidson, Kim and Horgan) and those (like Haskar) who argue that the mind is an emergent property of the brain. Supervenience based theories, I argue, end up reducing mental states in their search for a theory of mental causation and emergence based theories end up violating the principle of the causal closure of the physical. In part II, I explore some of the consequences of epiphenomenalism for social theory. This <b>exploration</b> <b>comes</b> <b>in</b> the context of a defence of human subjectivity against (i.) those sociological imperialists who view the mind and self as a 'gift of society', and (ii.) social situationalists who have abandoned the concept of action and an interest in 'what's in the head' of the actor, in favour of a concept of social action which views behaviour as action only to the extent that it is socially meaningful. The conclusion is that the social sciences should return to an interpretative style (Weberian) methodology. ...|$|R

40|$|The radical {{literary}} {{tradition of the}} 1930 ‟s inspired many American authors to become {{more concerned with the}} struggle of the proletariat. John Steinbeck is one of these authors. Steinbeck‟s novels throughout the 1930 ‟s and 1940 ‟s display a lack of agreement with the common Communist principles being portrayed by other radical novelists, but also a definite alignment with several more basic Marxist principles. The core of his radical philosophy <b>comes</b> <b>in</b> the form of his interest in group-man or the phalanx. An interest that is rather uncommon for the period, as most radical novelists were more concerned with illustrating the solitary nature of the proletarian worker. Over the course of his career this philosophy evolves, as can be illustrated through an analysis of In Dubious Battle, The Grapes of Wrath, and Cannery Row. In Dubious Battle is highly critical of Communist labor organizers, and sets Steinbeck apart form the radical tradition by questioning rather than supporting their motivation. The labor organizers manipulate the phalanx in this novel, and Steinbeck leaves the reader with the impression that the group-man is being corrupted. The Grapes of Wrath is also a socially motivated novel, with an abundance of Marxist undertones, but most importantly the novel provides Steinbeck with a better medium within which he can further examine the phalanx. Throughout this novel Steinbeck remains separate from other propagandists, as he supports his own agenda rather than that of the Party. Steinbeck‟s communal <b>exploration</b> <b>comes</b> to fruition <b>in</b> Cannery Row. While the novel has received a relatively small amount of critical attention due to the common presumption that Steinbeck intended the work to be a diversion from war, the characters of Cannery Row provide Steinbeck with the ultimate vehicle to illustrate the importance of the phalanx. Together these novels represent the evolution of Steinbeck‟s radical philosophy, particularly as it pertains to his vision of communal existence. While this vision of collectivity is what aligns Steinbeck with the most basic of Marxist principles, the mysticism he surrounds it with is what serves to set him apart from the more utilitarian communist appreciation of the phalanx. This argument will <b>come</b> largely <b>in</b> the form of analysis of Steinbeck‟s mouthpieces, which are characters in the novels that illustrate Steinbeck‟s philosophy either through speech or action. The conclusion of the analysis will show that Steinbeck is definitely a radical novelist, even though he is sometimes at odds with the tenets of the greater radical tradition...|$|R

This lecture will start with a brief sketch of two scientific areas, the speaker was actively involved in, that rely heavily on (huge) high-dimensional data sets to find relationships within the data: functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and semantic text mining. Once the audience has become familiar with some of the properties of these data sets, an overview of (visual) statistical methods is given to explore such data sets in a quick and/or fast manner. Indeed, this kind of datasets is common to many other scientific areas such as aeronomy, econometry, weather, genomics, OCR, ….

40|$|A {{fascinating}} {{aspect of}} Epstein 2 ̆ 7 s scholarly work is his {{exploration of the}} apparent tension between libertarian principles and utilitarian thought—an <b>exploration</b> that <b>comes</b> alive <b>in</b> his casebook. To Epstein, these two competing principles often coalesce to yield a single 2 ̆ 2 correct 2 ̆ 2 answer to a problem. In other words, the answer that arises from a desire to protect a pre-determined set of individual rights-for example, private property rights, or the right of personal autonomy often produces an outcome that is also beneficial to the overall common good. Some scholars have critiqued Epstein 2 ̆ 7 s work by suggesting {{that there is more}} disharmony than harmony in the relationship between the libertarian and utilitarian approaches. Who has the better argument on the point, however, is not relevant for present purposes. What is relevant is that Epstein introduces, confronts, and explores the potential for tension between the two approaches throughout his casebook in a way that provokes thoughtful and interesting classroom discussion. A second, and closely related, theme that Epstein explores in his casebook is the overwhelming importance of the older, historic common law cases to the study of torts. In fact, the book devotes almost seventy pages to the age-old debate over whether negligence or strict liability should govern unintentional harms. This historical approach reinforces Epstein 2 ̆ 7 s emphasis on the libertarian/utilitarian divide; indeed, the strict liability versus negligence debate roughly parallels the libertarian/utilitarian tension, with strict liability generally (although not necessarily) associated with the former and negligence generally (although not necessarily) associated with the latter. This historical grounding also gives students a basis for understanding why negligence governs some unintentional harms while strict liability governs others, and provides them with the tools to challenge the current boundaries between the two theories. Finally, a more historical approach to tort law gives students some sense of the expansion and contraction of tort liability over time-an understanding that puts 2 ̆ 2 tort reform 2 ̆ 2 in context...|$|R
