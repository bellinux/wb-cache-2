This mill is able to fray out the material, what leads to fluffy, optimally defibrated flocks that contain only very small amounts of dust. Furthermore the flame retardant is stuck to the flocks during the <b>defibration</b> process. After the mill the material is conveyed pneumatically to the dedusting unit, where the dusty air and the cellulose fibers get separated.

40|$|Eucalyptus wood {{is among}} the most {{important}} biomass resource in the world. Wood mechanical <b>defibration</b> and fibrillation are energy-intensive processes utilized not only to produce pulp for papermaking, but also to produce reinforcement fibers for biocomposites, nanocellulose, or pretreat lignocellulosic material for biofuels production. The structural features of different Eucalyptus hybrids affecting the refining energy consumption and produced fiber furnish properties were evaluated. The <b>defibration</b> and fiber development were performed using an alkaline peroxide mechanical pulping (APMP) process, which included chelation followed by an alkaline peroxide treatment prior to wood chip <b>defibration.</b> Despite the similar wood densities and chemical compositions of different Eucalyptus hybrids, there was a clear difference in the extent of <b>defibration</b> and fibrillation among the hybrids. The high energy consumption was related to a high amount of guaiacyl lignin. This observation is of major importance when considering the optimal wood hybrids for mechanical wood <b>defibration</b> and for understanding the fundamental phenomena taking place in chemi-mechanical <b>defibration</b> of wood...|$|E

40|$|This study {{approaches}} the phenomena of thermomechanical <b>defibration</b> of wood by examining single fiber properties. A hypothesis was formed based on literature: The <b>defibration</b> patterns due to impacts during fiber separation and high-consistency refining {{are related to}} the morphological properties of fibers. This is because: The effects caused by the action of <b>defibration</b> vary in morphologically different fibers, and The <b>defibration</b> action in the plate gap is influenced by the properties of the fiber material in the plate gap and changes as the properties of the fiber material in the plate gap change. In other words: the character of the fiber material affects the <b>defibration</b> result through two routes: firstly the <b>defibration</b> patterns of fibers {{are related to the}}ir properties, and secondly the character of the fiber bed in the plate gap influences the <b>defibration</b> action. The <b>defibration</b> patterns of fiber shortening, fiber wall thickness reduction and changing of fiber wall internal structure are discussed. The experimental part focuses on the <b>defibration</b> effects which are the measurable deformations in the fibers as a result of <b>defibration</b> actions. <b>Defibration</b> patterns are a set of <b>defibration</b> effects that develop the stiff wood fibers into papermaking fibers and fines particles. These concepts can be applied to all mechanical pulping processes, but this thesis focuses on their application to the TMP process and spruce as raw material. Fiber shortening was the result of cutting of fibers during the fiber separation stage. Fast-grown and thinner-walled fibers were more resistant than thick walled slow growth fibers towards the harsh conditions prevailing during fiber separation. Faster warming up of the fiber wall as a result of compression and relaxation of the material as well as encountering fewer shear forces than thick-walled incompressible fiber material were suggested as explanations for the different response of these fibers. The gradual peeling off of layers from the fiber surface resulted in reduction of fiber wall thickness. Different types of fibers produced different types of fines. The fibrillar fines were formed mainly from thick-walled fibers, and 50 - 100 % of the fibrillated fibers originated from latewood. The flake-like fines originated both from outer layers of latewood and earlywood fibers during fiber separation stage but also from pieces of the thinwalled earlywood fibers during the later stages of the whole <b>defibration</b> process. Only half of the fines fraction was formed as a result of peeling off of fiber wall. The rest consisted of ray cells, pieces of fibers and fiber wall formed as a result of fiber cutting or splitting. The differences in the fiber wall thickness did not explain the flexibility differences between initially refined and highly refined samples. From this was concluded that the fiber wall flexibility increased and fiber wall structure loosened during the <b>defibration.</b> Local swelling of the fiber wall was revealed using optical sectioning by confocal laser scanning microscopy. As a result of this inhomogeneity both fiber wall swelling and fiber conformability varied along the fiber length. Removal of the outer fiber layers increased fiber flexibility by decreasing fiber elastic properties and lowering the moment of inertia...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} work was to study the {{possibilities}} of radical formation in wood fiber surfaces to enable direct fiber-to-fiber adhesion by radical-based reactions {{in the manufacture of}} fibreboard, particularly medium-density fiberboard (MDF). The fibers were produced by <b>defibration</b> at high temperatures. Radical formation was achieved by treatment with laccase, treatment with Fenton's reagent, or gamma-irradiation. High-temperature <b>defibration</b> was found to cause cleavage of interunit beta-aryl ether linkages of lignin, resulting in formation of mechanoradicals and phenolic hydroxyl groups. The proportion of water-extractable low-molecular weight lignin and hemicelluloses present in the fibers increased with an increase in <b>defibration</b> temperature. In the laccase treatment of fibers in water suspension, much more radicals were formed in hardwood than in softwood fibers for fibers produced at equal temperature. Radical formation increased with increasing <b>defibration</b> temperature. The treatment of fibers with Fenton's reagent in water suspension resulted in the formation of similar numbers of radicals in hardwood and softwood fibers. Radical formation increased with increasing <b>defibration</b> temperature but not so drastically as with laccase treatments. Also the gamma-irradiated fibers contained large numbers of radicals. Their content increased as a function of increasing <b>defibration</b> temperature and was higher for hardwood than for softwood fibers. The internal bond strength (IB) of fiberboards made from fibers treated with laccase or Fenton's reagent in the defibrator blowline improved with increasing <b>defibration</b> temperature. The IB of boards made from laccase-treated fibers correlated with the number of radicals formed in the fibers on laccase treatment in water suspension, indicating that adhesion in the boards was largely due to reactions of radicals on the fiber surfaces. The IB of boards made from fibers treated with Fenton's reagent also correlated with the radical content of the fibers, but this relationship was not as strong as with the laccase treatments. This suggests that bonding mechanisms other than radical coupling may have contributed significantly to adhesion. Gamma-irradiation of fibers before their fabrication into boards resulted in a marked increase in board IB, indicating that radicals {{play a significant role in}} the adhesion of boards made from gamma-irradiated fibers. reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The present work compares two {{different}} pretreatment technologies, i. e. twin-screw extrusion, and steaming digestion plus <b>defibration,</b> for producing a thermo-mechanical pulp from rice straw for fiberboard manufacturing. Five liquid/solid ratios from 0. 43 to 1. 02 were tested for twin-screw extrusion pretreatment, while liquid/solid ratios from 4 to 6 {{were used for}} digestion pretreatment. Energy consumption, and characteristics of the extrudates (twin-screw extrusion) and pulps (digestion) (including fiber morphology, chemical composition, thermal properties, apparent and tapped densities, as well as color) were the analyzed parameters for the resulting lignocellulosic fibers. The results showed that liquid/solid ratio had influence on energy consumption of the equipment for both defibrating methods For the twin-screw extrusion method, a lower liquid/solid ratio required more energy while for the digestion plus <b>defibration</b> the effect was the opposite. The corresponding total specific energy consumption ranged from 0. 668 kW h/kg to 0. 946 kW h/kg dry matter for twin-screw extrusion, and from 6. 176 kW h/kg to 8. 52 kW h/kg dry matter for digestion plus <b>defibration.</b> Thus, the pulping method consumed about nine times more energy {{than that of the}} twin-screw extrusion. In addition, for twinscrew extrusion, the liquid/solid ratio did not have a substantial effect on fiber characteristics with similar chemical compositions and thermal properties. For twin-screw extrusion, the energy consumption was 37 % reduced when the liquid/solid ratio was increased from 0. 43 to 1. 02.

30|$|The <b>defibration</b> {{process is}} one of the {{significant}} parameters in the production of dry-processed fiberboard. The parameters of the digester conditions, such as press temperature, time, pressure, and defibrator disc distance, significantly affect the wood fiber properties [6 – 8]. In the MDF manufacture, digesting and refining conditions play important function to produce fibers of target quality. These manufacturing conditions affect the physical and mechanical properties of the MDF panel. In a previous study, Benthien et al. [7] reported that digester and <b>defibration</b> conditions, as well as raw material properties affect wood fiber characteristics and thereby the physical and mechanical properties of MDF. It was concluded that wood species, digester conditions, and grinding disc distance are the most influential parameters on the fiber quality.|$|E
40|$|A {{successful}} {{control strategy}} for a thermomechanical pulp (TMP) production line {{must deal with}} continuous operation as well as uniform high-quality product aspects. The ability to formulate a control strategy of this kind can be considerably enhanced by the availability of relevant process models. In this work, modeling has been performed in two different time frames and a new refiner monitoring system, including sensor arrays for temperature measurements in the refining zones, has been used, in combination with traditional process variables for model validation. A dynamic first-principle model, describing the work {{carried out in the}} refiner, has been derived. The model derives both thermodynamic work and <b>defibration</b> work, i. e. both reversible and irreversible phenomena, and pin-points the entropy change in the system. The model shows that the total energy input is distributed over the refining plates, forming a characteristic profile along the radius with the highest energy input in the <b>defibration</b> zone. Although the total work profile was fairly uniform, significant changes in the division between <b>defibration</b> work and thermodynamic work may occur. Consequently, a constant motor load does not necessarily indicate constant pulp <b>defibration.</b> Moreover, the capability of the models to deliver residence time and consistency estimates was also demonstrated. An overall model structure for the TMP production line, including all the internal interconnections, has been derived as well. Simulation results show that the model structure reflects the characteristics of the interconnected process and that the nature of the disturbance pattern arises from {{the fact that so many}} internal interconnections are present. Moreover, it is shown that the temperature profiles in the refining zones provide a range of process outputs with individual responses to input changes depending on the spatial location. The internal interconnections of the TMP production line influence the production performance, as well as the system controllability, which demonstrates the importance of considering control aspects at the process design stage...|$|E

MDF prepared from the 16 -year-old poplar wood were generally of higher mechanical strength and lower thickness swelling than those from the 5 -year-old poplar wood of the same clone. However, the release for formaldehyde and volatile acids from the MDF of the 16 -year-old poplar wood was relatively higher.

40|$|By {{replacing}} coal with renewable fuels, such as wood, {{the consumption}} of coal {{and the amount of}} fossil fuel emissions can be reduced. The wood fuels need however processing before combustion in pulverized fuel firing boilers. The aim of this work is to study the applicability of the DustComb-process as a pretreatment method for wood fuels. The principle of the DustComb-process is to defibrate the woody feedstock with a mechanical defibrator, and the produced fines are dried with a flash dryer integrated into the process. The dried fines are either fed into a pulverized fuel burner or stored for later use. In this work, the co-firing of biomass in a pulverized coal boiler is discussed, and the principles of mechanical <b>defibration</b> and flash drying are explained. In the experimental part of this study, the influence of the disc clearance on the defibrator’s specific energy consumption is determined. The disc clearance in the <b>defibration</b> tests are varied between 0. 60 and 1. 80 mm. Also the effect of the particle size on the drying rate is studied. In the calculations part, the costs of producing the DustComb-fuel are estimated and their dependence on the market price of electricity, the price of heat, and the price of the feedstock are evaluated. The costs are further compared with the market prices of coal and wood pellets. The experimental results show that the energy consumption of the <b>defibration</b> starts to increase rapidly when the disc clearance is narrowed from 1. 00 mm. According to the test results, the studied particle size changes do not have any remarkable effect on the drying rate of the material. A significant observation is that a great amount of the wa-ter in the wood is evaporated already during the <b>defibration</b> (16 – 25 % of the initial moisture). The calculation results show that the production of the DustComb-fuel is economically viable when compared to the price of coal, and especially when com-pared to the price of wood pellets. The results also show that the costs of the energy needed for the DustComb-process are low compared to the price of the raw material...|$|E
40|$|This thesis investigates {{relevant}} {{issues regarding}} the use of Eucalyptus wood: the factors affecting energy consumption during wood <b>defibration,</b> with focus on fiber wall chemistry and the assessment of wood quality {{from a wide range of}} novel Brazilian Eucalyptus hybrids. The obtained results are reflected to mechanical and traditional chemical processes. Wood refining experiments were carried out in laboratory scale, with and without chemical pretreatment: alkaline peroxide mechanical pulping (APMP) and thermomechanical pulping (TMP) processes, respectively. The most important finding was the direct influence of the lignin structure on the <b>defibration</b> energy. Especially, the relative contents of the guaiacyl moieties in the wood lignin seem to play a crucial role. The results showed that the higher the amount of guaiacyl structures in the lignin, especially in the middle lamella between the fibers, the higher the specific energy consumption (SEC) in the APMP process. However, for the TMP process the correlation was not as clear. This is most probably due to the fact that in the APMP process the <b>defibration</b> takes place in the middle lamella while in the TMP process other mechanism prevails. However, in the samples with very low amount of guaiacyl structures, SEC decreased substantially also in the TMP process. A different approach was promoting fiber wall deconstruction via autohydrolysis of wood. The autohydrolysis process changed notably the mechanical properties of the Eucalyptus chips, with impressive SEC decrease. Although autohydrolysis was performed under mild temperature (120 oC), lignin structure was changed. This assumption was based on the characterization of the fiber surfaces via x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Results showed high coverage of the fiber surfaces with lignin, indicating that the <b>defibration</b> of autohydrolyzed Eucalyptus wood chips takes place along the middle lamella. This behavior differs from the traditional thermomechanical pulping, where the rupture occurs mostly in the fiber wall (especially in the S 1 layer), being similar to chemimechanical processes. As a final step, traditional kraft pulping was performed, alongside with soda-anthraquinone (NaOH-AQ) pulping, with focus on the surface properties of the produced fibers, analyzed by SEM and XPS. The surface lignin content of NaOH-AQ pulp fibers was lower than that of the kraft counterpart. However, kraft pulp handsheets showed better physical and mechanical properties. XPS data (C 2 /C 3 ratio) strongly suggested, together with the pulp bulk chemical composition that xylan is more abundant on the surface of kraft fibers, probably enhancing their mechanical properties...|$|E
40|$|This review {{covers the}} effect of {{mechanical}} pre-treatment of wood chips on the energy consumption in refining {{and the quality of}} pulp. To understand the mechanisms of mechanical pre-treatment, a short description of relevant refining theory and reported effects of pre-treatment on wood morphology is given. Mechanical pre-treatment offers a chance to utilize the energy needed to defibrate chips in a more efficient way, minimizing the cyclic elastic deformations which are the main <b>defibration</b> mechanism in refining. Studies of fibre morphology indicate that compressive pretreatment mechanically introduces favorable weak points in the S 1 and S 2 fibre walls where <b>defibration</b> proceeds easier upon subsequent refining. Published results which cover {{the effect of}} the pretreatment on energy consumption and pulp properties are reviewed. Energy reduction of between 10 % and 30 % is reported in the literature. High ratio of volumetric compression is necessary. Pressurized conditions are required to ensure that the fibres are not damaged during the pre-treatment. Other effects of compressive pretreatment include a more uniform chip size and moisture content, better penetration of chemicals and removal of extractives from the chips. A list of equipment used for chip pre-compression is provided together with published results of pilot-scale and mill-scale operation...|$|E

40|$|This is {{the first}} in a series of papers {{presenting}} the development of a comprehensive multiscale model with focus on fiber energy efficiency in thermo mechanical pulp processes. The fiber energy efficiency is related to the <b>defibration</b> and fibrillation work obtained when fibers and fiber bundles interact with the refining bars. The fiber energy efficiency differs from the total refining energy efficiency which includes the thermodynamical work as well. Extracting <b>defibration</b> and fibrillation work along the radius in the refining zone gives information valuable for fiber development studies. Models for this process must handle physical variables as well as machine specific parameters at different scales. To span the material and energy balances, spatial measurements from the refining zone must be available. In this paper, measurements of temperature profile and plate gaps from a full-scale CD-refiner are considered as model inputs together with a number of process variables. This enables the distributed consistency in the refining zone as well as the split of the total work between the flat zone and the CD-zone to be derived. As the temperature profile and the plate gap are available in the flat zone and the CD-zone at different process conditions it is also shown that the distributed pulp dynamic viscosity can be obtained. This is normally unknown in refining processes but certainly useful for all fluid dynamic models describing the bar-to-fiber interactions. Finally, it is shown that the inclusion of the machine parameters will be vital to get good estimates of the refining conditions and especially the split between the thermodynamical work and the defibration/fibrillation work...|$|E

It will be proven by measuring size and shape of WF inside WPCs. This is a matter for future investigation. However, it is a significant finding that WPCs containing HDWF have the same mechanical properties as those containing FDWF under the condition of this study, because heat drying requires less energy and shorter drying times than freeze-drying.|$|E

40|$|Fluff pulp {{has been}} one of the key {{components}} of hygienic products, such as diapers, for many years. Fluff pulp is dry defibrated and air-laid into the absorption core of diapers. The introduction of superabsorbent polymers (SAPs) in the 1980 s decreased the dependence on fluff pulp, as the SAPs became the main absorbing material. Nevertheless, in order to decrease reliance on oil-based SAPs, it is important to investigate fluff pulp once again. This thesis investigates possibilities for modifying fluff pulp for use in absorption applications. In the first part of the thesis, softwood kraft pulp fibres were modified with a diepoxide in order to introduce cross-links into the fibre wall. Results show that the wet bulk under load of the low-density fibre networks increased as a result of the modification, most likely due to higher fibre stiffness. When the fibre networks were dried after the compression test, the low-density networks with the more extensively modified fibres also regained much of their bulk. In the second part of the thesis, a softwood kraft pulp and a birch kraft pulp were alkali extracted at 3 different concentrations of NaOH (2 %, 4 % and 8 % NaOH in suspension). The extraction was done in order to remove hemicelluloses from the fibre walls. The pulps were then dried in sheet form. Sheets were also dry defibrated and air-laid to investigate the performance of the pulps in fluff pulp applications. It could be seen that the extent of hornification of the once-dried fibres increased with increasing concentration of NaOH. Further, the tensile strength index of the sheets increased when the fibres were treated with 2 % NaOH, and decreased at the two highest concentrations. The birch pulp treated with 8 % NaOH had a low amount of knots after <b>defibration.</b> This was related to the low tensile strength index of that pulp, indicating an importance of fibre-fibre bond strength on ease of <b>defibration.</b> The network strength of dry defibrated and air-laid softwood pulp treated with 8 % NaOH was lower than the softwood pulps treated with 0 %, 2 % and 4 % NaOH, which was most likely an effect of the high curl index of that pulp. The network strength of the birch pulps was lower than in the softwood pulps. The network strength of the birch pulps also correlated well with the amount of knots in the pulps...|$|E
40|$|The overall {{purpose of}} this work is to {{evaluate}} the possibilities of wheat straw for fibre and energy production and {{address the question of}} whether or not it is possible to develop a cost-effective process for producing good quality pulp from wheat straw for current paper or paperboard products. In addition, in light of the green energy boom, the question of whether fibre production could give added value to energy production using wheat straw is addressed. Due to the logistics of the bulky raw material, the process should be applied on a small scale that determines the requirements for the process. The process should be simple, have low chemical consumption and be environmentally safe. The processes selected for the study were based on an initial hot water treatment. Actual <b>defibration</b> in the "chemical" approach was then performed using a subsequent alkaline peroxide bleaching process or in the "mechanical" approach through mechanical refining. In both approaches, energy can be produced from lower quality material such as dissolved solids or fines. In this work, one of the primary aims besides the development of the abovementioned process is to investigate the chemical storage of wheat straw which decays easily between harvesting periods and examine its effects on pulping and pulp properties. In addition, the aim of this work is to determine the market potential for non-wood pulp and evaluate non-wood pulp production. The results showed that the "chemical" approach produced fibres for printing and writing. The quality of the pulp was relatively good, but the chemical consumption at the target brightness of 75 % was high, indicating that a chemical recovery would be needed unless the brightness target could be significantly reduced. The "mechanical" approach produced unbleached fibres for fluting and the energy production from fines and dissolved solids generated additional income. The results also showed that it is possible to store wheat straw chemically with formic acid-based chemicals over a year without significant changes in the chemical composition. The chemical storage can be integrated with the suggested chemical or mechanical <b>defibration</b> process, soda pulping process or any other process utilising non-wood fibres. In China, a clear demand for non-wood-based fibres exists due to a shortage of fibre and also because of the increasing demand for bioenergy. In Europe, the competitiveness of non-wood fibre utilisation will only be established if combined with energy production...|$|E
40|$|The {{distribution}} and orientation of wood cell wall polymers {{play an important}} role in its physical, chemical and mechanical properties, and thus in the transformation into final products. Specifically, the orientation of cellulose elementary fibrils (EF) controls the performance of wood in almost every end use. Moreover, lignin is covalently linked to many of the cell wall polysaccharides, which imposes a serious technical challenge during the degradation of cellulose into value added products. Therefore, the deep understanding of the organization of the cell wall materials is imperative. In this study, normal Norway spruce wood was studied with a high-resolution cryo-transmission electron microscope (cryo-TEM). Both, two- (2 D) and three-dimensional (3 D) imaging techniques within TEM were applied on ultrathin wood sections to understand the wood structure. The <b>defibration</b> mechanisms in high-temperature thermomechanical pulping (HT-TMP) was also studied with a conventional TEM. Furthermore, the accessibility of cell wall lignin was studied with TEM and Raman microspectroscopy by analysing fresh and solvent extracted ultrathin sections of Norway spruce branch wood. The results showed that the organization of EFs varies from layer to layer and also within a single layer. In addition to the well-adopted concept of longitudinal EF angle in tangential plane, this study showed the presence of an out-of-plane EF angle relative to the cell wall plane. The S 1 layer had a transverse EF orientation with a predominant radial lamellar structure of EF bundles. Both crossed and parallel EF orientations were detected in the S 1 - 2 transition layer, which was supported by the <b>defibration</b> mechanisms in HT-TMP. EFs in the outer-S 2 layer had a relatively high longitudinal EF angle and a large out-of-plane angle with respect to the tangential plane, which continued to decline inward and became almost axial in the inner-S 2 layer. A transverse, out-of-plane EF orientation in the S 3 transverse sections was observed. The models of the wood cell wall summarize most of the findings regarding the wood ultrastructure. Study of the lignin extracted ultrathin sections showed the change of lignin concentration in all cell wall layers during the extraction process. However, lignin obtained after extraction consists mainly of secondary wall lignin as this area contains most of the total cell wall lignin in conifer tracheids. The new observations on the wood cell wall structure may lead to a better understanding of the reactivity of cellulosic fibers in biochemical, chemical and mechanical treatments...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis work {{presents}} {{a study of}} mechanical properties of the wood end-grain welding of spruce wood. The shear properties of butt joints of spruce at different pressure and welding time were studied. Between all the parameters of spruce welding, the welding pressure {{is one of the}} most important in relation to the mechanical properties. Thus, a good joint strength was obtained for spruce wood at high pressure. An increase of shear strength is observed with an increase in welding pressure. It is clear that at high pressure the welded material becomes more rigid and this is also coupled to the to the more extensive condensation reaction of lignin. The <b>defibration</b> tendency in end-grain-to-end-grain welding indicates that wood spruce welding is possible and yields sufficient joint strength. The welded interphase in end-grain-to-end-grain spruce welding appears possible and gives a joint with an anatomical appearance of a “natural” fingerjoint. Such “natural” fingerjoints can give equivalent than glued fingerjoints. The advantages of the end-grain-to-end-grain welding are then the very short time of processing, the dispensation of preparing the fingerjoint profiles and to avoid the use of adhesives...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{microbial}} pretreatment on hemp fibres were evaluated after microbial retting using the white rot fungi Ceriporiopsis subvermispora and Phlebia radiata Cel 26 and water retting. Based on chemical composition, P. radiata Cel 26 showed the highest selectivity for pectin and lignin degradation and lowest cellulose loss (14 %) {{resulting in the}} highest cellulose content (78. 4 %) for the treated hemp fibres. The pectin and lignin removal after treatment with P. radiata Cel 26 were of the order 82 % and 50 %, respectively. Aligned epoxy-matrix composites were made from hemp fibres defibrated with the microbial retting to evaluate the effects on their ultrastructure. SEM microscopy of the composites showed low porosity on the fibre surfaces after <b>defibration</b> with P. radiata Cel 26 and C. subvermispora indicating good epoxy polymer impregnation. In contrast, fibres treated by water retting and the raw hemp fibres were badly impregnated due to porosity caused by surface impurities such as epidermis and other pectin rich plant cells. The pectin and lignin mainly located in the outer part of the fibres were assumed to be extracted and degraded by pectinase and peroxidase enzymes produced by the fungi...|$|E
40|$|Wheat straw {{was used}} to produce medium-density {{fiberboard}} (MDF). The chemical and physical characteristics of fractionated size-reduced wheat straw were investigated. The pH, pH-buffering capacity, ash, and silicon content increased as wheat straw particle size decreased. Ash of the finest straw, < 0. 2 mm, had high ash (15 %) and silicon (18 %) contents. The outer and inner parts of size-reduced straw were analyzed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The SEM micrographs revealed a complex ultrastructure containing a notable portion of thin-walled cells approximately 1 mu m thick. Pressurized <b>defibration</b> of size-reduced wheat straw produced lignocellulosic fibers nearly 1. 0 mm long combined with approximately 24 % of small particles and dust. The high water uptake of straw-based MDF was significantly reduced using melamine-modified urea-formaldehyde (UF) resin and removing wheat straw particles and dust by screening. UF resin was added at levels of 12. 5 %, 13. 1 %, and 14 %. In terms of water resistance, 12 -mm-thick straw MDF displayed thickness swelling below 10 %, acceptable according to the EN 622 - 5 MDF standards. It was concluded that manufacturing wheat straw MDF entails straw size reduction (hammer-milling), removing small particles and dust, and adding melamine-modified UF resin to attain necessary MDF quality standards...|$|E
40|$|Pilot scale {{refining}} of White spruce using {{a modified}} TMP refining process (ATMP - Advanced Thermomechanical Pulp) was studied. ATMP combines selective wood disintegration by mechanical pretreatment and refining at elevated intensity with chemical treatment after <b>defibration</b> (in this study hydrogen peroxide, alone and {{in combination with}} alkali). The electrical energy efficiency and pulp quality using ATMP were evaluated and compared to a conventional TMP process. One goal was to retain the combination of optical properties and strength of typical TMP. Fibre properties (structural dimensions, external and internal fibre development) {{as well as the}} amount of split fibres resulting from TMP and ATMP processes were compared. The results indicate an electrical energy efficiency improvement potential of 0. 65 MWh/odt (34 %) at tensile index 30 N. m/g of ATMP compared to reference TMP. All ATMP pulps retained their TMP character, i. e. the relationships between light scattering coefficient, density, elongation properties and strength that are important for printing paper. ATMP had a significantly lower content of shives and higher external and internal fibre development compared to TMP at equal energy application. The long fibre fraction of ATMP also contained significantly higher amount of split fibres. The brightness of ATMP produced with addition of hydrogen peroxide (28 kg/odt) and magnesium hydroxide (14 kg/odt) was 14 ISO % higher compared to TMP...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Wood pulp fibers {{can serve}} as useful {{reinforcement}} of plastics for increased stiffness. To assess the potential of various wood fibers as reinforcement, a method has been developed to determine {{the contribution of the}} fibers to the elastic properties of the composite. A micromechanical composite model and classical laminate mechanics are used to relate the elastic properties of the fibers to the elastic properties of the composite. A large variety of composites made of various wood pulp fibers in an epoxy vinyl ester matrix was manufactured. From the tensile test results of the composites, the contributing Young’s moduli of the fibers in the longitudinal direction are back-calculated and summarized. One finding is that there is an optimum in fiber stiffness as a function of lignin content. It is also found that industrially pulped hardwood fibers have higher stiffness than the corresponding softwood fibers. One example is kraft-cooked Norway spruce fiber, for which a Young’s modulus of 40 GPa is found. The effects of hornification, prehydrolysis, and sulfite processing are also investigated. The results indicate that mild <b>defibration</b> process should be used, that does not damage the cell wall structure so that the inherent high stiffness of the native fibers can be retained. It can be concluded that the proposed method works well to rank the wood fiber candidates in terms of their contribution to the composite stiffness...|$|E
