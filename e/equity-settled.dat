40|$|This article {{examines}} the value creation of 78 German acquisitions in the US during the period 1990 to 2004. The observed Cumulative Abnormal Returns (CARs) confirm the previous finding that cross-border Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A) activity yields on average wealth gains for shareholders of the acquiring companies. No evidence of a negative cross-border wealth effect could be ascertained, thereby indicating a high international integration of the German capital market. The positive capital market perception of German M&A activities in the US is mainly driven by the acquisition of private targets and <b>equity-settled</b> transactions. The market reactions yield overall congruent results to the responses from surveyed executives of German acquirers. However, bidders' self assessment of US acquisitions is more positive than the capital market valuation, which substantiates manager overconfidence. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} how to {{calculate}} diluted earnings per share (DEPS) when a firm has outstanding employee stock options (ESOs). Three possible methods are described and compared. The first is the current International Accounting Standard 33 – Earnings Per Share (IAS 33) approach {{which is based on}} the intrinsic value of the ESOs. The second method, advocated by Core et al. (2002), is very similar to that of IAS 33 but instead of the intrinsic value uses the fair value of the outstanding options. This paper derives an alternative method which adjusts the earnings for the year by the change in fair value of the outstanding ESOs, with no adjustment to the denominator in the DEPS calculation. The three methods are compared using a simple firm. The earnings adjustment method best describes the change in economic value of the current shareholders, the fair value is more useful in predicting future profits, and the intrinsic value method appear to provide no additional information to that already contained in the other two measures. The earnings adjustment method has a further advantage in that it provides an identical result at a DEPS level to that which would have been obtained if the ESOs were cash-settled and treated as liabilities in terms of IFRS 2. Thus using this method will improve comparability as cash-settled and <b>equity-settled</b> options have a very similar economic effect on current shareholders. ...|$|E

The research assesses {{the appropriateness of}} the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-Based Payment transactions with a specific focus on <b>equity-settled</b> Employee Share Options. The researcher has calculated the percentage movements or changes of fair value between each financial year including the overall percentage change. The study was mainly triggered by the IFRS 2 Share-Based Payment rules and various arguments from different authors challenging the appropriateness of IFRS 2 Share-Based Payment on employee share options (ESOs) transactions in capturing the full economic value transferred to the option holder at exercise date when applying a grant date accounting model. The study provides insights into whether a grant date accounting model is appropriate in measuring ESOs and capturing the full economic value transferred to the option holder. The application of a static fair value model in measuring the value of ESOs has the potential for both positive and negative effects on the compensation cost recognised in the financial statements over the vesting period. After analysing the descriptive financial data on fair value per option over the six year period included in the sample selection, a conclusion was reached that, IASB should consider to true-up or make a restatement of the opening balance of the fair value reserves account in order to minimise the potential permanent error in equity accounts and to minimise the potential effect of understating or overstating the compensation cost. The IASB should further consider the proper classification of equity instruments issued to employee ESOs which comply with other financial instrument accounting standards such as the IAS 32 – Financial Instruments: Presentation, and IFRS 9 Financial Instruments. This will ensure that transactions viewed as economic equivalents of each other are treated in the same way from an accounting perspective, and the correct measurement basis of ESOs may be achieved...|$|E
