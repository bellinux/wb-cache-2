He continued in his role of advisor during the reigns of Cnut's sons, Harold Harefoot and Harthacnut. When Cnut's stepson Edward the Confessor succeeded Harthacnut, Stigand <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>probability</b> became England's main administrator. Monastic writers of the time accused Stigand of extorting money and lands from the church, and by 1066 the only estates richer than Stigand's were the royal estates and those of Harold Godwinson.|$|E
5|$|The Montana {{class would}} have used {{aircraft}} for reconnaissance and for gunnery spotting. The type of aircraft used would have depended on when exactly the battleships would have been commissioned, but <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>probability</b> they {{would have used}} either the Kingfisher or the Seahawk. The aircraft would have been floatplanes launched from catapults on the ship's fantail. They would have landed {{on the water and}} taxied to the stern of the ship to be lifted by a crane back to the catapult.|$|E
5|$|The species <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>probability</b> {{has little}} or no direct impact or {{influence}} on human interests and concerns but agricultural and real estate development are a threat to the species' very narrow habitat. Collecting specimens in the dry ridges is complicated by the millions of ants which eat the bait in the trap the moment it is set on the ground. Live collecting is the alternative, but the bait is usually digested by the time the animal is taken from the trap, making food research difficult if not impossible.|$|E

30|$|Nitrobenzene is {{relatively}} a complex molecule, and its non-ideality <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>probabilities</b> {{may be due}} to the polarity arising out of C-N and N-O bonds. As far as the nitro group is concerned, it rotates freely along the C-N axis which is likely to give more flexibility to the interactions arising due to two highly polar N-O bonds.|$|R

50|$|The steam {{locomotive}} was probably used only on Patiala Sunam Line. In {{his letter to}} H. R. Ambler, Col. Bowles wrote that the locomotives were heavy for 18 lb/yd rail (9 kg/m), thus they were not used on Sirhind - Morinda line. Col. Bowles categorically stated that the {{steam locomotive}} did run between Patiala Station and City Mandi i.e. {{a distance of about}} a mile. Heavier rails (about 60 pounds per yard or 30 kg/m) of almost same length was found stored in PSMT Yard along with other dismantled equipments. Thus <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>probabilities,</b> the steam locomotive was used in hauling carriage only between Patiala Station and City Mandi.|$|R
25|$|The Latin script {{owes its}} {{existence}} to the Etruscan alphabet, which was adapted for Latin {{in the form}} of the Old Italic script. The Etruscan alphabet employs a Euboean variant of the Greek alphabet using the letter digamma and was <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>probability</b> transmitted through Pithecusae and Cumae, two Euboean settlements in southern Italy. This system is ultimately derived from West Semitic scripts.|$|E
25|$|The main defences are {{entered a}} little farther on in the same line, through a {{projecting}} two-story building which has some fireplaces with very simple and late mouldings. The buildings are of the local basalt, and the masonry is rough rubble; there are, as is so frequently the case, no very clear indications for dating the different parts, which were <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>probability</b> erected at different times.|$|E

25|$|This {{is borne}} out by {{observations}} by the late Dusty Durrant, who observed that the trailing wheels on the locomotive were cast and of a more modern design than the coupled wheels, which appear to be of wrought iron. He also surmised that, {{since there is no}} evidence of a well-tank under the bunker, the locomotive had been a side-tank locomotive throughout its working life and that the side-tanks were, <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>probability,</b> removed at some stage after the engine was abandoned as unserviceable in 1883.|$|E
25|$|The chapel of S. Gregory the Illuminator (formerly the Chapel of the Mother of God - St Astvatzatzin), {{built before}} 1177, stands {{high above the}} road, a hundred meters away from the {{entrance}} to the monastery. It is partly hewed in massive solid rock; its composition was, <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>probability,</b> largely influenced by the shape of the cave which existed there. The chapel, rectangular in plan and having a horseshoe-shaped apse, is adjoined, from the east and from the northeast, by passages and annexes hewed at various levels and even one on top of another.|$|E
25|$|Doyle is {{sometimes}} seen as downplaying {{the importance of}} Robinson's contribution to The Hound of the Baskervilles. The literary scholar and critic, Professor William Wallace Robson wrote that it is 'impossible to determine' the precise extent of Robinson's role, but <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>probability</b> he merely acted as a 'creative trigger'. He adds that once the element of Sherlock Holmes {{was added to the}} original idea, the novel evolved beyond the joint project that was originally posited. Robinson himself conceded that his part in the collaboration was restricted to that of an 'assistant plot producer'.|$|E
5000|$|Prakashadharma was {{a notable}} king of this dynasty, who assumed the title, Adhiraja. The Rishtal {{inscription}} gives us {{information about his}} achievements. It records {{the construction of a}} tank and a Shiva temple at Risthal by Bhagavaddosha, a Rajasthaniya (viceroy) of Prakashadharma. This inscription mentions that Prakashadharma defeated the Huna ruler Toramana, sacked his camp and had taken away the ladies of his harem. The tank constructed at Risthal during his reign was named after his grandfather as Vibhishanasara. He also constructed a temple dedicated to Brahma at Dashapura. During the excavation at Mandsaur in 1978 by a team of Vikram University, Ujjain, led by V.S.

25|$|The Armstrong map of 1775 show a 'Laigh' {{in fairly}} close {{proximity}} to the 'Chapel'. This is <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>probability</b> Laigh Chapelton, suggesting that a dwelling existed at this date and adding strength to the supposition that Laigh Chapelton was a building, or the site of a building, of some considerable antiquity. A legal document, 'Defences for James Wilson of High Chapelton sued by John Miller of Laigh Chapelton' in 1820 gives us the names of the tenants of both of these properties at this time The rental valuie circa 1820 was £180.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} window openings {{are difficult}} to ascertain due to successive and significant reworkings of the walls since 1900. Despite this, the general form of the windows is <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>probability</b> similar to the present openings. The general form most likely follows that of St. Peter’s Church in New Kent county that has diamond-shaped leaded panes set in square casement windows, though, these too are reproductions from fragments discovered on the site. Diamond-paned windows were in common use in England since the 1630s. The present windows are clearly not colonial and reflect changes in fenestration during the nineteenth century.|$|E
25|$|Abnormal {{discoloration}} of wood often denotes a diseased condition, indicating unsoundness. The black {{check in}} western hemlock {{is the result}} of insect attacks. The reddish-brown streaks so common in hickory and certain other woods are mostly the result of injury by birds. The discoloration is merely an indication of an injury, and <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>probability</b> does not of itself affect the properties of the wood. Certain rot-producing fungi impart to wood characteristic colors which thus become symptomatic of weakness; however an attractive effect known as spalting produced by this process is often considered a desirable characteristic. Ordinary sap-staining is due to fungal growth, but does not necessarily produce a weakening effect.|$|E

40|$|There {{is little}} doubt that the phase-in FDI contributed {{significantly}} to Chinese economic development, and much and perhaps most of the growth of China’s exports can be attributed to foreign-invested enterprises and per capita income growth in those coastal regions of China where FDI is concentrated has been demonstrably higher than in other regions. FDI is fuelling much of the rapid economic leap of China, yet it is not well integrated into mainstream of Chinese economy and the significant inequity grow further, for the reason that these inflows of investment are, however, concentrated both by country of origin, industries and regions.
