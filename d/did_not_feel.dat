5|$|Chrisye's health {{improved}} in 2006 and in May and November he undertook long interview sessions with his biographer Alberthiene Endah. He also released two compilation albums, Chrisye by Request and Chrisye Duets; however, he reportedly <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> {{well enough to}} release new songs. By February 2007 his health was again in decline.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 1020s, Maymandi urged Mahmud to invade Jibal, {{which was then}} {{under the control of}} the young Buyid ruler Majd al-Dawla. However, the real ruler of the region was Majd al-Dawla's mother Sayyida Shirin, which was already known by the neighbors of the Buyids, {{including}} the Ghaznavids. Mahmud, however, did not agree with him, because he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> his empire threatened because of a woman ruling in the region.|$|E
5|$|His {{comeback}} to the County Championship {{continued with}} a 44-ball half-century against Middlesex on 19 April 2007, while in May {{he hit a}} career-best 284 against Northamptonshire, although Trescothick stated then that he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> ready for an international Test match position. Trescothick followed this double century with a knock of 76 off 35 balls against Northamptonshire, with five fours and seven sixes.|$|E
30|$|The subjects’ {{state of}} {{psychological}} stress {{was assessed using}} a questionnaire. The questionnaire consisted of 5 responses, namely, 1, feel very cold; 2, feel somewhat cold; 3, <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> anything; 4, almost <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> cold; 5, <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> cold at all, for questions regarding cold feelings in the hand/foot, hip, and back. The subjects selected {{their perception of the}} current state of their hand, foot, hip, and back from the 5 sections. Similarly, a questionnaire was used to examine the degree of shoulder stiffness.|$|R

5|$|In {{regards to}} the English dub, Shinkai <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> that he could judge {{the quality of the}} voice acting since he could not speak English natively. He felt that it was good due to the {{feedback}} he had received and because he could feel the emotion in the characters' voices. However, he noted that the experience would be different for viewers and that the final judgment could only be made by English-speaking audiences.|$|E
5|$|In summer 2006, Say Anything toured with Dashboard Confessional; Ben Lee {{was with}} the tour in the US, while John Ralston joined the tour in Canada. The band was asked {{to be a part}} of the Warped Tour 2006, but instead opted for the Dashboard tour. Bemis later made {{statements}} implying he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> he was emotionally ready for a Warped Tour.|$|E
5|$|Late in rehearsals for the {{original}} production, Jessie Bond {{assumed the role of}} Hebe, replacing Mrs Howard Paul. Bond, who at this point in her career was known primarily as a concert singer and had little experience as an actress, <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> capable of performing dialogue, and these passages were revised to cut Hebe's dialogue. Hebe's cut dialogue is occasionally restored in modern performances.|$|E

Adamme tells her to respect his personal space and not say anything negative in his hearing.|$|R
5|$|Nash did not rush {{to enlist}} in the Australian armed forces on the {{outbreak}} of war in 1939. While there was no public statement from Nash, {{it is thought that}} with a family to support and an Irish Catholic anti-pathy to the British, Nash <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> an urgency to fight. However, following the commencement of the war against Japan, Nash enlisted on 2 February 1942.|$|E
5|$|Speaking {{after the}} game's release, Sonic Team member and Sonic and the Black Knight {{director}} Tetsu Katano remarked {{that although he}} <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> the Werehog concept was a mistake, time and resources were a limiting factor in the game's production. He also remarked that the Werehog may reappear in future games, or possibly in a sequel to Sonic Unleashed, should one be made.|$|E
5|$|A second {{conflict}} emerged {{just before}} the end of his term, when in 1945, the Labour government sought to abolish the country quota, a system that gave additional electoral seats in rural areas. Farming groups – predominantly National-supporting – strongly opposed the move, and argued that such a major change could only be made after gaining approval in a general election. Newall sympathised, and advised Fraser to wait until after the election, but <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> it was appropriate to intervene; he assented to the bill.|$|E

5|$|Allen <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> {{suited to}} {{working in a}} {{department}} store, and on his return home took {{a job with the}} stockbroking company David Bevan and Co. Consequently, he played little cricket in 1933. He planned to be unavailable for the Test matches against the West Indies, but Larwood was injured and Voce out of form, so he was persuaded to play in the first Test. He played little thereafter that season and declined an invitation to tour India with an MCC team. In three games that season, he scored 199 runs and took 13 wickets. That December, he was elected {{as a member of the}} Stock Exchange.|$|E
5|$|Another {{controversial}} Peace Prize {{was that}} awarded to Barack Obama in 2009. Nominations had closed only eleven days after Obama took office as President of the United States, {{but the actual}} evaluation occurred over the next eight months. Obama himself stated that he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> deserving of the award, or worthy of the company it would place him in. Past Peace Prize laureates were divided, some saying that Obama deserved the award, and others saying he had not secured the achievements to yet merit such an accolade. Obama's award, along with the previous Peace Prizes for Jimmy Carter and Al Gore, also prompted accusations of a left-wing bias.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} 1877, PedroII paid a {{visit to}} Caxias and ascertained that he could no longer remain in office. The entire cabinet {{resigned}} on 1 January 1878. His health problems had become so troubling that he had been asking repeatedly to resign since early 1876. Caxias was not only afflicted by concerns over his declining health, but increasingly felt a sense of alienation. He <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> he could play a relevant role in politics. He belonged to an older generation who perceived the Emperor (and consequently, the monarchy) as essential for holding the nation together.|$|E

5|$|Benicio del Toro as Fred Fenster. Spacey {{suggested}} del Toro for the role. The {{character was}} originally written with a Harry Dean Stanton-type actor in mind. Del Toro met with Singer and the film's casting director {{and told them}} {{that he did not want}} to audition because he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> comfortable doing them. After reading the script, del Toro realized that his character's only purpose was to be killed to demonstrate Söze's power, and did not have any meaningful impact on the story. As a result, del Toro developed Fenster's unique, garbled speech pattern to make him more memorable as a character.|$|E
5|$|Brandon later {{returned}} to active service, commanding his regiment through the Battle of Gettysburg. General William Barksdale {{was killed in}} the battle; Colonel Humphreys became brigadier general to replace him, and Brandon was in turn promoted to colonel. He went on to see action in the Chickamauga Campaign. In September 1863, after the Battle of Chickamauga, Brandon resigned from active duty. Because of his artificial leg, age and the recurrence of an ailment from 1862, he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> fit for military service at the time.|$|E
5|$|Chaitanya Krishna {{confirmed}} his {{inclusion in the}} cast {{by the end of}} March 2014. In late April 2014, Naresh was chosen {{to play an important role}} in the film, which he later described as one of the best roles of his career. Roshan Basheer was selected to reprise the role of Varun, the son of the Inspector General of Police, in the remake. He <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> that he was being typecast and he accepted the role, adding that it is not often that a Malayalam actor gets a chance to act in the Telugu films.|$|E

5|$|Clement IX had {{primarily}} named Italian cardinals to the college, only appointing one French and one Spanish cardinal when {{he needed}} their assistance to fight back an invasion by the Ottoman Empire in Crete. He created his friends cardinals, with seven of the twelve that he created coming from his native Tuscany. Clement <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> obligated to appoint a German cardinal because the Holy Roman Emperor had requested his assistance in Hungary. Within days of his death Clement IX had created seven additional cardinals, which brought the number of potential electors to its maximum number of seventy.|$|E
5|$|Details of {{the game}} were leaked in February 2007, shortly before Rare {{announced}} development later that month. During development process Rare attempted {{to ensure that the}} game <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> too similar to the original Jetpac, whilst keeping the core mechanics. The game received mostly favourable reviews upon release. Critics praised the updated graphics and gameplay, however they criticised the overall repetitiveness {{of the game}} and its multiplayer mode. It was later included in Rare's 2015 Xbox One retrospective compilation, Rare Replay.|$|E
5|$|For {{the role}} of Kyle Reese, Orion wanted a star whose {{popularity}} was rising in the United States but who also would have foreign appeal. Orion co-founder Mike Medavoy had met Arnold Schwarzenegger and sent his agent the script for The Terminator. Cameron was dubious about casting Schwarzenegger as Reese as he felt he would need someone even bigger to play the Terminator. Sylvester Stallone and Mel Gibson were offered the Terminator role, but both turned it down. The studio suggested O. J. Simpson for the role, but Cameron <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> that Simpson would be believable as a killer.|$|E
