The Leaders second class mailing privileges were withdrawn in October 1917 and the publication was banned from the United States mails, eliminating about 14,000 subscribers with one blow. In August 1918 the publication was deprived {{of the right to}} receive <b>first</b> <b>class</b> <b>mail,</b> with all letters from subscribers and readers sent to the publication summarily returned to sender with the envelope stamped [...] "Mail to This Address Undeliverable Under Espionage Act."

25|$|Air Mail as a {{distinct}} service was effectively ended within the United States on October 10, 1975, however, when all domestic intercity <b>First</b> <b>Class</b> <b>mails</b> began to be transported by air whenever practical and/or expeditious at the normal <b>First</b> <b>Class</b> rate. Domestic Air Mail as a separate class of service (and its rate structure) was formally eliminated by the successor to the Post Office Department, the United States Postal Service (USPS) on May 1, 1977.|$|R
2500|$|The Leader, as an anti-war publication, {{drew the}} ire of the Wilson {{administration}} and its Postmaster General, Albert S. Burleson and in October 1917 had its Second Class mailing privileges revoked. In August 1918 the publication was deprived {{of the right to}} receive <b>First</b> <b>Class</b> <b>mail,</b> with all letters from subscribers and readers sent to the publication summarily returned to sender with the envelope stamped [...] "Mail to This Address Undeliverable Under Espionage Act." [...] Despite the attack, loyal Milwaukee readers and advertisers rallied around the paper with monetary donations and the publication survived the attack. Through it all, Work wrote extensively on anti-militarist themes including, according to his own testimony, four of the five editorials for which Victor Berger was indicted by a grand jury in Chicago in December 1918.|$|E
2500|$|The {{retail banking}} segment {{consisted}} {{of personal and}} small business banking operations. The major products and services offered through the retail banking segment included individual and small business deposit accounts, mortgages, home equity loans and lines of credit, auto loans, business equipment financing, financial planning and investment services, online bill payment and Visa check and credit cards. [...] NetBank, through its Internet banking operations, operated as an FDIC-insured, federally chartered thrift institution serving approximately 286 thousand customers throughout the United States and in more than 90 foreign countries. NetBank delivered its products and services through remote delivery channels, such as the Internet, telephone and ATMs, that are available 24 {{hours a day and}} seven days a week. It did not maintain a branch network to support its banking business. The branchless model provided an opportunity to operate with less overhead expense than traditional branch banks. Customers initially relied on direct deposit and <b>first</b> <b>class</b> <b>mail</b> to make deposits into their accounts, supplemented later by QuickPost (free deposit drop-off at UPS Stores for overnight delivery to NetBank) and ATM deposits.|$|E
2500|$|After 1948, {{the railway}} post office network began its decline {{although}} it remained the principal intercity mail transportation and distribution function within the Post Office Department (POD). There were 794 RPO lines operating over 161,000 miles of railroad in that year. [...] Only 262 RPO routes were still operating by January 1, 1962. [...] In 1942, the POD began experimenting with a highway version of the RPO to serve the same purposes along routes where passenger train service was not available. [...] These highway post office (HPO) vehicles were initially intended to supplement RPO service, but in the 1950s and 1960s, HPOs often replaced {{railway post office}} cars after passenger train service was discontinued. The last interurban RPO service was operated by Pacific Electric Railway on its route between Los Angeles and San Bernardino, California. When the post office made a controversial policy change to process mail in large regional [...] "sectional centers," [...] mail was now sorted by large machines, not by people, and the remaining railway post office routes, along with all highway post office routes, were phased out of service. In September 1967 the POD cancelled all [...] "mail by rail" [...] contracts, electing to move all <b>First</b> <b>Class</b> <b>mail</b> via air and other classes by road (truck) transport. This announcement had a devastating effect on passenger train revenues; the Santa Fe, for example, lost $35 million (US) in annual business, and led directly to the ending of many passenger rail routes.|$|E
50|$|Article I, section 8, Clause 7 of the United States Constitution grants Congress {{the power}} to {{establish}} post offices and post roads, which has been interpreted as a de facto Congressional monopoly over the delivery of <b>first</b> <b>class</b> residential <b>mail</b> - which {{has been defined as}} non-urgent residential letters (not packages). Accordingly, no other system for delivering <b>first</b> <b>class</b> residential <b>mail</b> - public or private - has been tolerated, absent Congress's consent.|$|R

They originally had a claret livery, which was an exception at that time (most other SBB-CFF-FFS vehicles had the same green livery). They got the nickname [...] "Golden Coast Express" [...] ("Goldküstenexpress"), due to their service on the Golden Coast (which is the northern waterside of the lake of Zurich, known for its high land prices, thus attracting mainly wealthy levels of the population). With {{the introduction}} of the new double-decker S-Bahn trains in the 1990s, they lost their prestigious role and were subsequently used on lines with low passenger frequencies.
