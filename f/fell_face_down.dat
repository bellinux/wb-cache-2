[...] It was clear that, from the time whatever hit him to the moment he had landed on the floor, Elvis hadn't moved." [...] Joel Williamson writes: [...] "For some reason— perhaps involving a reaction to the codeine and attempts to move his bowels— he experienced pain and fright while sitting on the toilet. Alarmed, he stood up, dropped the book he was reading, stumbled forward, and <b>fell</b> <b>face</b> <b>down</b> in the fetal position. He struggled weakly and drooled on the rug. Unable to breathe, he died." [...] Attempts to revive him failed, and death was officially pronounced at 3:30p.m. at Baptist Memorial Hospital.|$|E
