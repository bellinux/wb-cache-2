5|$|On March 16, 1824 Mr. Lowndes, the BFBS's {{secretary}} in Corfu, {{sent a letter}} to the society in which he mentioned that the sum paid to Meksi for his work was 6,000 piastras and that Archimandrite Grigor was paid 60 crowns. On September 5, 1824 the Saint Matthew's Gospel was published in Albanian. According to Lowndes' letters, the Albanian community of Missolonghi was extremely excited when mass was said with a piece from Saint Matthew, as since its translation they had been impatient to <b>hear</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> Albanian. In July 1827 the form in which the first 500copies of the New Testament were to be bound was decided in London. The entire edition amounted to 2,000copies.|$|E
25|$|The 1980 Night Grand Final between North Melbourne and Collingwood at VFL Park {{ended in}} similar circumstances: the siren sounded, but the umpires {{were unable to}} <b>hear</b> <b>it.</b> <b>In</b> the ensuing play, North Melbourne's Kerry Good marked and goaled after the siren {{to win the game}} for North Melbourne by three points. Collingwood did not appeal, and the result stands as official.|$|E
500|$|The epic-sounding, Clams Casino-produced opening track, [...] "Palace", has Rocky {{acknowledging}} Southern hip hop's {{influence on}} his sound: [...] "Influenced by Houston / you can <b>hear</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> my music". [...] "Wassup" [...] has an ethereal, Houston-inspired soundscape. However, Chase McMullen of Beats Per Minute observes from the mixtape's sound the [...] "threatening vibe" [...] of Raekwon's 1995 album Only Built 4 Cuban Linx... and a grime influence, commenting that [...] "while southern influences currently dominate much of current hip hop, Rocky places as much importance on the Wu {{as he does}} Three 6." [...] Paul Lester of The Guardian compares [...] "Peso" [...] to the stylings of The Jet Age of Tomorrow. [...] "Trilla" [...] has a funk and boom bap influence in its production.|$|E
50|$|The band {{worked out}} the music from <b>hearing</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> clubs and {{consulted}} Smash Hits for the lyrics, although they changed them substantially.|$|R
50|$|The album Fire Fragments {{inspired}} David Agoston Tóth (musical co-author) - upon purchasing and <b>hearing</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> 2006 - {{to propose}} to Marton {{to write a}} musical based on Attila József’s mysteriorus life. They started working together soon.|$|R
50|$|Rachmaninoff played early {{versions}} of the piece to Oskar von Riesemann (who later became his biographer), who did not like it. Konstantin Igumnov expressed interest upon first <b>hearing</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> Moscow, and following his suggestion Rachmaninoff cut about 110 bars.|$|R
500|$|Foo Fighters earned mostly {{positive}} reviews upon release. Many critics {{compared the}} album to Grohl's previous band, Nirvana. Reviewer David Browne of Entertainment Weekly considered that [...] " [...] songs pack the riffy wallop of unpolished Nirvana demos, {{and his voice}} has Kurt Cobain's lunging, over-the-top passion." [...] Writing for Spin, Terri Sutton stylistically compared the album to Nirvana's second album, Nevermind, saying that [...] "the album's first half [...] owes much to Nevermind, and it's tempting to <b>hear</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the way Nevermind taught us to hear." [...] Paul Rees of Kerrang! admitted that [...] "Foo Fighters cannot fail to evoke Kurt Cobain's memory, whether if through Grohl's ragged howl of a voice or the way a number of its songs go soft-soft-loud", but ultimately considered the record [...] "more than strong enough to stand or fall in its own merits". [...] Billboard complimented the [...] "inspired songwriting and passionate performances", adding the album could please grunge fans and [...] "also remind fans of other rock and punk taste makers, from Green Day and The Offspring to Better than Ezra." ...|$|E
500|$|Unlike Looking Glass' {{previous}} first-person games—Ultima Underworld, Ultima Underworld II and System Shock—Terra Nova {{takes place}} in outdoor environments. The game's engine, named TED, supports weather conditions, day and night environments, real-time water reflections and moving clouds, among other effects. Most of {{the work on the}} outdoor renderer was done by programmer Eric Twietmeyer; however, contemporary computers were not powerful enough to display fully three-dimensional (3D) outdoor environments. The problem was solved by programmer James Fleming: the game's engine renders and applies textures to foreground objects in full 3D graphics, but—according to PC Gamer US—it displays a [...] "bitmapped background in the distance" [...] to provide the [...] "illusion of detail". As with Flight Unlimited and the CD-ROM release of System Shock, Terra Nova was designed to support head-mounted displays. The game features QSound technology. Describing QSound's effect before the game's release, Suzanne Kantra Kirschner of Popular Science wrote that [...] "you'll hear the rustle of leaves from the right speaker a split second before you <b>hear</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the left signaling you that the enemy is approaching from the right".|$|E
500|$|Life is Good {{received}} widespread acclaim from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to {{reviews from}} mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 81, based on 30 reviews. Kevin Perry of NME called it [...] "a grimy, back-to-basics return to form", while Pitchforks Jayson Greene said Nas had [...] "settled gracefully into strengths", Slant Magazines Manan Desai said Nas sounded [...] "inspired" [...] and praised the album's [...] "narrative unity" [...] as [...] "a wide-angle {{look of the}} artist as a grown man." [...] Evan Rytlewski of The A.V. Club deemed Nas' lyrics [...] "beautifully expressed" [...] and the music just [...] "as thoughtful". Randall Roberts of the Los Angeles Times called it a [...] "thoughtful, fierce, honest and – most important – heavy-duty work" [...] and stated, [...] "Nas has gotten better at rolling with the punches – and you can <b>hear</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> every verse". Carl Chery from XXL said it is [...] "arguably Nas' best LP since Stillmatic" [...] and asserted, [...] "At this juncture—21 years and 10 solo albums in—no other MC has ever rhymed at such a high level this deep into their career." ...|$|E
5000|$|British singer-songwriter Andy Partridge of XTC calls Emergency! his all-time {{favourite}} album, {{and says}} that <b>hearing</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> 1969, {{at the insistence of}} a friend, was a vital moment in expanding his musical tastes beyond conventional guitar pop and rock.|$|R

Ah, Tom, {{that girl}} is an angel; {{she has been}} to me daughter, doctor, clergyman, eyes and library; {{and would have been}} nurse too, {{if it had not been}} for making old Jane jealous. But she is ill. Some love affair, I suppose--" ...|$|R
500|$|No Limit was {{followed}} by Keep Your Seats, Please in 1936, which was again directed by Banks with Desmond returning as the co-star. Tensions arose in pre-production with Banks {{and some of the}} cast requesting to Dean that Beryl be banned from the set. Tempers had also become strained between Formby and Desmond, who were not on speaking terms except to film scenes. The situation became so bad that Dean avoided visiting his studios for the month of filming. The film contained the song [...] "The Window Cleaner" [...] (popularly known as [...] "When I'm Cleaning Windows"), which was soon banned by the BBC. The corporation's director John Reith stated that [...] "if the public wants to listen to Formby singing his disgusting little ditty, they'll have to be content to <b>hear</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the cinemas, not over the nation's airwaves"; Formby and Beryl were furious with the block on the song. In May 1941 Beryl informed the BBC that the song was a favourite of the royal family, particularly Queen Mary, while a statement by Formby pointed out that [...] "I sang it before the King and Queen at the Royal Variety Performance". The BBC relented and started to broadcast the song.|$|E
500|$|While {{vacationing in}} the Bahamas and Costa Rica in 2008, Saadiq {{observed}} people there listening to classic soul music and {{was inspired to}} pursue it as a musical direction for his next album. He recounted the experience in an interview for Blues & Soul, saying that [...] "I was like 'Wow, maybe I should tap into this vibe, because it’s actually what I LOVE!' ... I realised that, though you can <b>hear</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> many of the records I've done throughout my career, I'd never paid 100% attention to going in that direction before. So the difference this time is that I took a more focused route." [...] As a part of Tony! Toni! Toné! during the late 1980s and 1990s, Saadiq had incorporated influences from the music of Motown in his songwriting for the group. Before recording The Way I See It, Saadiq signed to Columbia Records. Label executive Rick Rubin visited Saadiq's home studio and was impressed by his material there. He said of Rubin's visit and advice {{to him as a}} solo artist, [...] "He told me to never box myself in. I just have to be myself. You've got to follow your own path. I've always gone down the road less traveled, but now I do it even more aggressively." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Confessions of a Broken Heart (Daughter to Father)", {{the lead}} single and first {{track of the}} album, was mainly written by Lohan as a letter to her father, Michael Lohan, who was incarcerated in June 2005 after {{surviving}} a car crash {{for which he was}} charged with driving under the influence of alcohol. Additional writing and song production was done by Greg Wells and Kara DioGuardi, who revealed, [...] "If you solo the vocals you'll hear race cars, because we brought the studio to [...] trailer on [...] I'm not kidding! She had no time to do the record, so she would be on her lunch break, and I'd be like, 'Throw that thing down your throat and get over here, 'cause we got to finish these vocals!' So I sat for 14 hours on the set and would grab her for, like, 10 minutes at a time. The poor girl. That's the reality of young Hollywood. When they're hot, they're worked to death. It was 18/20-hour days. ... And I swear: 'Vroom! Vroom!' You can <b>hear</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the back." [...] "My Innocence" [...] is also about the singer's father. Lohan also covered [...] "I Want You to Want Me" [...] by Cheap Trick and [...] "Edge of Seventeen" [...] by Stevie Nicks for the album.|$|E

I must hear {{what she has to}} say--and I should {{infinitely}} prefer <b>hearing</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> your presence. When I got your reply to my letter, permitting me to present her to you, I wrote to her immediately, appointing a meeting here." ...|$|R
5000|$|Kirk {{was born}} Ronald Theodore Kirk in Columbus, Ohio, {{where he lived}} in a {{neighborhood}} known as Flytown. He felt compelled by a dream to transpose two letters in his first name to make '"Roland". He became blind at an early age as a result of poor medical treatment. In 1970, Kirk added [...] "Rahsaan" [...] to his name after <b>hearing</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> a dream.|$|R
500|$|For {{the first}} time in her career, Gomez was given full {{creative}} control following her signing with Interscope Records. She expressed frustration and constraint with the songs chosen for her earlier in her career, and felt a disconnect from the music both personally and professionally. During the creation of Revival, the singer emphasized the importance of creating a distinct sound for herself, telling Nolan Feeney of Time that [...] "there were times in my career where I sang things that just weren’t me and weren’t for me. You can <b>hear</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> my voice. You can hear it when it’s inauthentic." [...] Gomez aimed to create autobiographical songs which shared personal stories, whether or not she wrote them. Citing the therapeutic process of writing [...] "The Heart Wants What It Wants" [...] for her greatest hits album For You (2014), the singer was inspired to separate herself from her peers and convert personal experiences into the music of Revival. For [...] "Sober", Gomez focused on using her unique vocal tone and abilities as an actress to translate feelings and emotions through her music. The singer also told producers to focus primarily on the lyrics and vocals, referencing albums of her youth that dealt with themes of growing up in the spotlight, particularly Christina Aguilera's album Stripped (2002).|$|E

[...] "Confessions of a Broken Heart (Daughter to Father)" [...] was first previewed at AOL Music's First Listen on September 30, 2005, and was sent to mainstream radio in the United States on October 18, 2005, as the lead single from A Little More Personal (Raw). The song was released digitally in the United States on November 8, 2005, while being released internationally on January 15, 2006 by Casablanca Records.|$|E
2500|$|Emotion is {{primarily}} {{characterized as a}} synthpop album, with tinges of new wave respective of Jepsen's influences. Jepsen penned [...] "Your Type" [...] with Rami Yacoub and Carl Falk {{at four in the}} morning when she was [...] "losing her mind": [...] "They got me hooked for a week on those little fake cigarettes that taste of strawberries. You can <b>hear</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> my voice, I sound all gritty. It’s because I was vaping for a week." [...] "Warm Blood" [...] was produced by Rostam Batmanglij and co-written with Tino Zolfo and Joe Cruz. It initially held the hook [...] "warm love feels good" [...] to which Batmanglij misheard as [...] "warm blood", sticking as its main motif as he was drawn to its physical rather than abstract connotations.|$|E

5000|$|A {{string of}} hit singles and albums kept the Carpenters {{on the charts}} through the early 1970s. Their 1971 hit [...] "For All We Know" [...] was {{originally}} recorded in 1970 by Larry Meredith for a wedding scene in the movie Lovers and Other Strangers. Upon <b>hearing</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the movie theater, Richard saw potential <b>in</b> <b>it</b> and subsequently recorded <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the autumn of 1970.

The appealing party does not need to appeal to the metropolitan; the party can instead appeal to the Holy See, in which case the Roman Rota would hear the case in the second instance. If the case was before the Rota in the first instance, then a different panel of the Rota <b>hears</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the second instance.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do you really, father? Oh, I am pleased! I think--yes, I am {{sure that}} I could bear now to know that Edgar is your real son, and not I.

6000|$|... "If you please, sir," [...] {{said the}} ex-corporal, {{speaking}} in a whining voice, and touching his moleskin cap with a humility which contrasted strangely with the previous rough independence of his bearing, [...] "I'm an old gunner in the Queen's service, sir, and knowing your name by <b>hearing</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> India I thought that maybe you would take me as your groom or gardener, or give me any other place as happened to be vacant." ...|$|R
