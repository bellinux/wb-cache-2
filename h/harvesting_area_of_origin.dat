40|$|This study {{attempts}} {{a quantitative}} {{analysis on the}} regional diversity of the Javanese farm agriculture and the pattern of its change which has taken place during the six decades in this century. The source material of this analysis is {{the two sets of}} five years average date (of the years 1916 - 20 and 1975 - 79) on the <b>harvested</b> <b>area</b> <b>of</b> seven major food crops in 65 regions covering the whole <b>area</b> <b>of</b> Java and Madura which have been derived from the official statistical documents and processed by the author. Major findings which have been acquired by this analysis are as follows: (1) The extension <b>of</b> the <b>harvested</b> <b>area</b> <b>of</b> seven crops during the six decades is very remarkable, and this is mainly caused by the increase of multiple cropping. (2) The percentage <b>of</b> the <b>harvested</b> <b>area</b> <b>of</b> rice to the total <b>harvested</b> <b>area</b> <b>of</b> seven crops is much higher {{in the western part of}} the island than its eastern part. On the contrary the percentage <b>of</b> the <b>harvested</b> <b>area</b> <b>of</b> maize is higher in the eastern part. (3) The pattern of extension of the farm agriculture is regionally different and sometimes contrastive. Generlly speaking, in West Java and the “East Hook” of East Java the agricultural development is highly wet rice oriented, while in many regions of the eastern half of Central Java and the western half of East Java the non-rice crops oriented development has taken place. (4) The share <b>of</b> the <b>harvested</b> <b>area</b> <b>of</b> soybean and peanuts has extended outstandingly. In case of soybean this tendency is particularly remarkable in East Java. (5) In West Java the agriculturally developing regions are not identical with the regions with big population increase, which means that the interregional exchange of agticultural products has increased within this part of island. On the contrary, the agricultural development in Central and East Java is much more oriented for the self supply of foods within each region. (6) When viewed as a support factor to the population increase, the non-rice crops production has been no less important than the rice production. (7) However, the agricultural development as a whole cannot be seen the sole factor supporting the population increase, because the regional correlation between the increase <b>of</b> <b>harvested</b> <b>area</b> <b>of</b> seven crops and the population increase is not prominently high (+ 0. 5040 for the whole Java) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{estimation}} of the location <b>of</b> the <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> a blood source is of major importance within bloodstain pattern analysis. Given this, it is particularly important to establish the accuracy of such estimations. This study examines error rates by investigation of alpha angle inaccuracies of upward directional stains and compares a virtual bloodstain pattern model to real bloodstain patterns. It {{was found that the}} size <b>of</b> the <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> influences the level of accuracy required in alpha angle estimations: larger <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> tolerated larger errors. Practical applications of the virtual model using real bloodstain patterns demonstrated that alpha angle measurements may show an inaccuracy of approximately 0 ° - 12 ° within a single pattern. The averaging process that occurs in estimating the <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> lessens the influence of a few large variations, such that, there is no significant change in the <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> estimation. The virtual model was validated as a conservative indicator, by means of overestimation, of the influence of alpha angle inaccuracy on <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin.</b> The study confirms that with proper stain selection, straight-line trajectories to estimate <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> are valid and reliable...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the use of a model to determine everyday <b>harvest</b> <b>area</b> <b>of</b> Eichhornia crassipes in environmental phytoremediation. A logistic model was constructed to eatimate the <b>area</b> <b>of</b> Eichhornia crassipes and tested in Eichhornia crassipes samples. The <b>area</b> <b>of</b> Eichhornia crassipes was measured nine times in experiment period using GPS data and satellite remote sensing images. The measurements were shown to lead to a determination of the parameters of accurate logistic model with an overall Goodness of Fit Index of 0. 9753. This indicates that there is a possibility <b>of</b> obtaining everyday <b>harvest</b> <b>area</b> <b>of</b> Eichhornia crassipes from the logistic model and suggests that it is possible to implement environmental phytoremediation with the everyday harvest at the equal sustainable <b>area</b> <b>of</b> Eichhornia crassipes...|$|R
