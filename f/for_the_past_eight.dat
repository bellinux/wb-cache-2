40|$|Abstract Training of {{treatment}} plant operators in South Africa faces some special problems. First, the political changes in <b>the</b> <b>past</b> decade {{led to a}} complete restructuring of local government. An {{integral part of the}} ongoing restructuring process is an aggressive programme for black economic empowerment. This brought many new faces into local government without the practical experience to which the water industry is accustomed, coupled with a massive displacement of technical skills from the sector. From 1989, the number of civil engineering professionals (engineers, technologists, technicians) has dwindled from 22 / 100000 of the population to 3 / 100000 of the population in 2007 (Lawless, 2007). Second, the Water Services Act (1997) of South Africa shifted the burden of water supply squarely on the shoulders of district and local municipalities. The dilution of skills, coupled with increasing responsibility, makes it clear that the water sector in South Africa will have to train itself out of this predicament. As a result, the quality and focus of training programmes, especially at the operator level, is receiving renewed attention. This paper shares the experience of the development and refinement of a training course for filter assessment <b>for</b> operators over <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>eight</b> years...|$|R

50|$|In 1934 A. Stewart Cruikshank {{decided it}} would be worth experimenting with a summer season in Edinburgh along the lines of seaside entertainment. The show, known as <b>The</b> Half <b>Past</b> <b>Eight,</b> had already been a great success at the theatre's namesake in Glasgow, where comic Jack Edge {{performed}} to full houses for fourteen weeks. Edge was brought over to Edinburgh to open the show, but with meagre audiences it flopped and lasted just six weeks. Howard and Wyndham brought in Charles and Ilona Ross to produce their winter pantomimes. Charles Ross knew that closing <b>the</b> theatre <b>for</b> <b>the</b> summer was wasting an opportunity, and he wanted to revive the summer show which had failed previously. Cruikshank was at first sceptical, but in 1937 he gave in, and gave the show four weeks to succeed or he would close it. Ross could not find a big star to front the show, and it seemed it was to fail once again. He eventually tracked down a young fairly unknown comic called Dave Willis. Willis was just what Ross had been looking <b>for.</b> <b>The</b> Half <b>Past</b> <b>Eight</b> show opened on 31 May 1937, and was billed as 'An after dinner light revue of song, dance and laughter - also starring Cliff Harley, Florence Hunter and the Charles Ross Girls'. At first, only a few hundred came to see the show, {{and by the end of}} the third week Cruikshank was about to close the production. What happened next was not to be expected. News of the show spread by word of mouth and by the end of the following week, the King's was packed nightly with standing room only,. The program changed every week. There were big opening and finale numbers with the dancers in sequinned and feathered dresses, and Dave Willis was a hard working individual appearing throughout most of the show. By 1941, the show had stretched to twenty-eight weeks. When Willis moved to open a Glasgow version of the show, Harry Gordon took over. Subsequent stars were Stanley Baxter, Rikki Fulton and Jimmy Logan.In 1948 the theatre suffered a terrible blow when A. Stewart Cruikshank was killed in a car accident at the age of 72. However, in true theatre terms, the show must go on, and Howard and Wyndham ensured this was the case. Over the years capacity audiences had taken its toll on the King's auditorium, the King's was soon crying out for refurbishment. In 1950 the glass canopy was replaced by a more modern design. Then attention was turned to improving the interior. <b>The</b> King's closed <b>for</b> ten months, during which time underwent some dramatic structural alterations internally. The building was redecorated, the uppermost balcony was demolished, and then the rake of the Upper Circle was increased and extended back. The sight lines had now been much improved, and this had resulted in the capacity being reduced dramatically. The theatre was opened partially <b>for</b> <b>the</b> 1951 Edinburgh Festival, with its Dress Circle closed off. It was closed once more for refurbishment works to be completed. The King's finally re opened again on 14 December 1951 with the pantomime Puss in Boots. Over the 1950s and '60s the variety productions continued their success.|$|R
