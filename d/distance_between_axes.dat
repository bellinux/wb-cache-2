40|$|Directional Drilling (DD) {{technology}} {{can be used in}} deep glacier boreholes to obtain additional ice cores from any depth and create supplemental boreholes for geophysical research on glacier ice properties under natural conditions. Experimental directional drilling was done using an antifreeze thermal electrical drill (ATED) in a PICO test well. A special device called a whipstock was used for the deflection of the ATED in previously-drilled borehole. The test demonstrated that a whipstock deployed in the main borehole permits directional drilling to obtain extra ice core. The experimental whipstock was placed 25 cm above the bottom of the 4. 5 m deep borehole. The ATED was inclined in previously-prepared cavity to an angle of up to 3 °. When the second borehole reached a depth of about 6 m from the whipstock it had no inclination. The <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> <b>axes</b> of the main and secondary boreholes was about 0. 3 m.

40|$|Revolute-Spherical, Spherical-Revolute (RSSR) {{mechanisms}} are simple devices {{used to obtain}} input-output relations with prescribed spatial orientations of motion axes. RSSR mechanisms operate in a way similar to gear couplings with a more slender arrangement. In addition, they allow non-linear re-lations with relatively large <b>distances</b> <b>between</b> <b>axes.</b> RSSR {{mechanisms are}} ideal to generate unusual crank-rocker or double-rocker trajectories. However, their design is rather challenging. Some of the most referenced drawbacks include dimensional synthesis from a desired degree of mobility and mechanical efficiency. Several analytic methods have been studied to solve this problem. Most of these methods obtain the mechanical dimensions from the same prescribed input and output positions and do not con-sider other design variables. In this paper, a new design optimization procedure is proposed to improve the optimal synthesis of RSSR mechanisms. The objective {{of this approach is}} to determine the optimal dimensions of the links that minimize the coupler-link longitudinal variation error from the original to the final position. The proposed objective function is obtained based on the <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> two spatial points located on two revolute axes of motion. The constraints correspond to the mechanical behavior of the mechanism. Sequential Quadratic Programming is used to solve the optimization problem.

Image is collected, and is input into computer, then is processed by a series of steps such as grey level transformation, image smoothness, lower filtration, and threshold value selection, etc. The measurement of the geometric parameters and the roundness error relies on the image contour.
