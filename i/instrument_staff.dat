500|$|Periodicals for the {{bluegrass}} genre such as Bluegrass Canada and Bluegrass Now have featured {{stories about}} Elderly and its selection of bluegrass instruments and repair services. Elderly employees maintain {{connections with the}} bluegrass industry by attending trade shows such as the International Bluegrass Association Trade Show in Louisville, Kentucky. At these shows, Elderly showcases typical bluegrass instruments, such as banjos, guitars, mandolins, fiddles and resophonic guitars, to musicians and businesspeople. Elderly <b>Instruments</b> <b>staff</b> members have set up {{organizations such as the}} [...] "Friends of Bluegrass" [...] to support local bluegrass musicians.|$|R

50|$|Another {{possibility}} is {{to extend the}} barline where a time change is to take place above the top instrument's line in a score and to write the time signature there, and there only, saving the ink and effort {{that would have been}} spent writing it in each <b>instrument's</b> <b>staff.</b> Henryk Górecki's Beatus Vir is an example of this. Alternatively, music in a large score sometimes has time signatures written as very long, thin numbers covering the whole height of the score rather than replicating it on each staff; this is an aid to the conductor, who can see signature changes more easily.|$|R
5000|$|This {{system worked}} well until November 1910, when a railmotor {{carrying}} {{the manager of}} Pelaw Main Colliery collided with the rear of a coal train in No.2 Tunnel, killing him and seriously injuring his passenger. After the coroner's inquest into this accident, electric <b>staff</b> <b>instruments</b> were installed by the New South Wales Government Railways for J & A Brown. As part of the installation of electric <b>staff</b> <b>instruments,</b> the loop at six mile loop was brought into use as a crossing point. <b>Staff</b> <b>instruments</b> were installed at Minmi Junction, Six Mile Loop, Richmond Main Junction (Later renamed Richmond Vale Junction) and Pelaw Main. When Richmond Main Colliery started producing coal instruments were also installed for the Richmond Main - Richmond Vale Junction Section. The Minmi Junction <b>staff</b> <b>instruments</b> were moved to Stockrington in 1914 with {{the completion of the}} duplication of the line from Minmi Junction. After the construction of the direct passenger line was constructed between Richmond Main and Pelaw main Collieries in 1922, electric <b>staff</b> <b>instruments</b> were also installed on this line. The double track section of the RVR was worked by [...] "Telephone Block" [...] controlled by the traffic officers at both Hexham and Stockrington.|$|R
50|$|At the {{south-west}} end of {{the building}} is the electric <b>staff</b> <b>instruments</b> room, which is accessed from the platform via a four panel timber door. Internally, two red electric <b>staff</b> <b>instruments</b> sit on timber pedestals. A switch board is mounted on the wall {{to the right and}} the rear wall has a sash window. There is a double-hung sash window in the rear wall.|$|R

The headmaster is Hjörleifur Örn Jónsson. There are over 400 students enrolled for the 2015-2016 academic year.|$|R
50|$|Because of its {{technological}} wood properties, Prosopis kuntzei {{is considered}} an important Fabaceae species. However timber is available in small sizes and limited amounts, therefore it is used rather locally to manufacture crafts like statues, handles, wooden wheel parts, musical <b>instruments</b> and <b>staffs.</b> Due to its almost black colour, and remarkable hardness, {{it can be used}} as substitute of ebony.|$|R

50|$|In 1909-10 {{the line}} across Hexham Swamps was {{duplicated}} between the exchange sidings and Richmond Vale Junction (latter renamed Minmi Junction). During 1913-14 {{with the development}} of Duckenfield No.2 colliery at Stockrington taking place, the main line was duplicated between Minmi Junction and Stockrington. A cabin to house the electric <b>staff</b> <b>instrument</b> for the section to Six Mile Loop was constructed at Stockrington. In 1942 with the re-arrangement of the main lines at Stockrington to cater for the new Stockrington No.2 Colliery a new staff cabin was built adjacent to the level crossing at Doghole and the <b>staff</b> <b>instruments</b> were relocated to this new cabin.|$|R
50|$|The station had {{a single}} {{platform}} (530ft or 160m long) with a small building containing a waiting room, restrooms and a room containing the Electric Train <b>Staff</b> <b>instruments.</b> There are several photographs of this station held in the N.S.W. Transport Archives.|$|R
50|$|The horse-head fiddle, or morin khuur, is a distinctively Mongolian {{instrument}} and {{is seen as}} a symbol of the country. The instrument has two strings. There is some controversy regarding the traditional carving of a horse on the upper end of the pegbox.

50|$|The level {{instrument}} {{is set up}} on a tripod and, depending on the type, either roughly or accurately set to a leveled condition using footscrews (levelling screws). The operator looks through the eyepiece of the telescope while an assistant holds a tape measure or graduated staff vertical at the point under measurement. The <b>instrument</b> and <b>staff</b> are used to gather and/or transfer elevations (levels) during site surveys or building construction. Measurement generally starts from a benchmark with known height determined by a previous survey, or an arbitrary point with an assumed height.|$|R
40|$|Background. Women with {{intellectual}} disabilities (ID) contract {{breast cancer}} {{at the same}} rate as the general population but have higher breast cancer mortality and lower rates of breast cancer screening. Many women with ID live in group homes or supported residences where they are cared for by direct support workers. While direct support workers are thought to influence client health, this effect is underresearched, and we lack tools for measuring staff empowerment and perceptions regarding client health. Methods. We developed and validated an <b>instrument,</b> the <b>staff</b> empowerment tool (SET), to measure staff empowerment as related to supporting clients in preventive health. Results. The SET was found to be a reliable <b>instrument</b> for measuring <b>staff</b> activation and empowerment in helping clients access mammography screening. Discussion. Quantifying staff empowerment and perspectives is important in studying and reducing disparities among adults with ID, a vulnerable population. Further research to determine the impact of staff empowerment levels on their clients’ health and health care access is suggested. The SET is a valuable tool for measuring the construct of staff empowerment, evaluating interventions, and collecting data regarding variation in staff empowerment...|$|R
50|$|A 15 ft by 12 ft {{signal box}} with a 16-lever frame {{controlled}} traffic over the level crossing was next to the main station building.

Consequently, Bledlow box ceased to signal trains in 1902, but it remained in use to operate the crossing gates.|$|R
50|$|Major {{signalling}} changes {{occurred in}} 1986, including the abolishing {{of the electric}} staff sections Sale - Stratford Junction, and Stratford Junction - Stratford, and replaced with the electric staff section Sale - Stratford, with an intermediate electric <b>staff</b> <b>instrument</b> provided at Stratford Junction. All signals and interlocking at Stratford Junction, located towards Melbourne, were also abolished during this time.|$|R
50|$|A {{user can}} enter notes, rests, and chords with {{standard}} computer keyboard/mouse input (including keyboard shortcuts) or by MIDI keyboard, MIDI guitar, MusicXML file, MIDI file, or any mix of these. Other input options include an interactive fretboard (that a user can add/remove strings and assign alternate tunings) and chord library. Changes {{made to the}} TAB staff automatically update an <b>instrument's</b> standard notation <b>staff</b> and vice versa.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to calibration of the <b>instruments,</b> STScI <b>staff</b> characterizes and documents {{the performance of}} the instrument, so users can better understand how to interpret their data. These are generally effects that are not automatically corrected for in the pipeline (because they vary with time or depend on the brightness of the source). They include global effects, such as charge transfer efficiency in the charge coupled devices, as well as effects specific to modes and filters, such as filter “ghosts” (caused by subtle scattering of light within an instrument). Awareness of these effects can come from STScI staff as they analyze calibration programs, or from observers who find oddities in their data and provide feedback to STScI.|$|R
50|$|With the {{feasibility}} of using radio to effect the interlocking of single line token instruments demonstrated, and the additional benefit of voice communication between the signaller and the drivers noted, it was but a short step of invention to moving the <b>instruments</b> from <b>staffed</b> signal boxes to the cabs of trains. The line selected for the trial was another remote and lightly used Scottish line: the old Highland Railway route from Dingwall westwards to Kyle of Lochalsh. The contract was placed with Westinghouse of Chippenham, Wiltshire, and the system was brought into use on 28 October 1984, with the control equipment situated at Dingwall. Over the next four years, control was transferred to Inverness and the Wick and Thurso line {{was included in the}} scheme.|$|R

5000|$|Upon {{the opening}} of the Aberdare Railway to Cessnock signal boxes were located at: East Greta Junction, East Greta, Aberdare Junction, Stanford Merthyr, Weston, Abermain and Cessnock. The signals & lever frames etc. were built by McKenzie and Holland. Safeworking on the single track line was by {{electric}} staff. Upon duplication of the main line safeworking was provided by Tyers 3 wire block instruments, which were later replaced by Tyers 1 wire, 3 position instruments. The Stanford branch was worked by electric staff from Aberdare Junction. During duplication an additional signal box was opened at Neath. Additional signal boxes were later opened at Mt Dee, Bee Siding, Aberdare South Junction, Aberdare Central Junction and Bellbird Junction on the main line, and Kalingo Junction on the Kalingo branch. The Bellbird branch from Bellbird Junction to Bellbird Colliery, and the Pelton branch from Bellbird Colliery to Pelton were worked by electric <b>staff</b> <b>instruments.</b> From 1942 the Kalingo branch was worked by electric <b>staff</b> <b>instruments</b> from Bellbird Junction to Kalingo Junction.

40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} {{cross-cultural}} adaptation to Brazilian Portuguese of two instruments for {{the measurement of}} family-centered care, one for parents and one for healthcare professionals. Methods: Methodological study of cross-cultural adaptation following the phases of translation, back-translation, analysis by experts, pre-test, test-retest and psychometric analysis after {{the application of the}} instrument to 100 parents of hospitalized children and 100 professionals from pediatric units of a teaching hospital. Results: the evaluation of experts in both instruments showed a Kappa of 0. 85 and 0. 93 respectively. At pretest, participants suggested no changes. Test-retest reliability was good for both stability indexes. Factor analysis explained 43. 9 % of the total variance in the parents instrument and 43. 4 % in the <b>staff</b> <b>instrument.</b> Cronbach's alpha coefficient was 0. 723 for the parents instrument and 0. 781 for the <b>staff</b> <b>instrument.</b> Conclusion: the instruments adapted to the Brazilian culture presented reliability, stability and good internal consistency, with potential {{to be used in the}} pediatric clinical practice.

40|$|A child 2 ̆ 7 s {{pattern of}} linear growth {{is one of}} the most {{sensitive}} indicators of health and well-being. However, many health care personnel use casual techniques and faulty instruments to measure children 2 ̆ 7 s growth and keep imprecise growth charts, making interpretation of growth patterns problematic. This situation can delay diagnosis and treatment of children with growth disorders and other conditions that affect growth. It can also lead to undue anxiety and unnecessary evaluation of children who are actually growing well. A clinical practice guideline was developed to optimize the accuracy and reliability of linear growth measurement. This article presents strategies to implement the guideline and thereby increase awareness of the importance of standardized growth measurement techniques and <b>instruments,</b> facilitate <b>staff</b> training and competency, and encourage standardized record keeping. These strategies will give providers more confidence in their interpretation of children 2 ̆ 7 s growth patterns and allow them to recognize potential problems, possibly before other symptoms appear...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{increased}} external, societal pressure on schools via developments such as accountability and accreditation, {{there is a}} growing need of schools for instruments that provide them with information {{on the quality of the}} teaching and learning processes they organize. This paper presents an instrument that can be used to diagnose teachers’ interpersonal skills, one element of teaching quality that may be of interest to schools. The instrument is based on the theory of interpersonal communication of Timothy Leary. Apart from a discussion of the theoretical framework behind the instrument, the paper presents information on the instrument itself and procedures for using the instrument with teachers and students. Also, information is provided on possibilities of using the <b>instrument</b> for <b>staff</b> development and other purposes of schools.
