The effects caused by pollutants depend on the intensity and time length of the exposure. The objective {{of this study is to}} identify Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and mitogen-ActivatingProtein Kinase (MAPK) as an indicator of maternal placental inflammation in pregnant rats (Rattusnorvegicus) exposed to carbon black with <b>immuno-histochemical</b> <b>technique.</b> This study was a laboratoryexperiment with three treatment groups and seven replications using pregnant female white rats (Rattusnorvegicus). Pregnant female rats were exposed to carbon black with a dosage of 523 mg / m 3 and 1064 mg/ m 3 during pregnancy of day 6 up to day 11. The next phase was the observation and examination of theexpressions of VEGF and MAPK by immunohistochemical staining toward placenta of the white ratsexposed to carbon black. The result of the study showed an increase in the expression of VEGF in the placenta of the rats (Rattus Norvegius) exposed to carbon black with a dosage of 523 mg / m 3 and 1064 mg / m 3 per inhale during the mid-period (6 - 11) of pregnancy. In addition, there was also an increasein the expression of MAPK on the placenta of the rats exposed to carbon black with a dosage of 523 mg / m 3 and 1064 mg / m 3 per inhale during the mid-period (day 6 - 11) of pregnancy.

40|$|Copyright © 2003 Australian Orthodontic JournalBACKGROUND: There is some {{evidence}} that the epithelial cell rests of Malassez partition the root surface from the periodontal ligament blood vessels, and may protect the root from resorption. OBJECTIVE: The aim {{of the present study was}} to determine the distributions of the epithelial rests of Malassez (ERM) and blood vessels in the periodontal ligament (PDL) of the developing rat first molar before, during and after emergence. METHODS: Four Sprague-Dawley rats were sacrificed at two days, one week, two weeks, three weeks, four weeks and six weeks of age. After processing, the maxillae were embedded in paraffin, and sectioned longitudinally and transversely. The sections were stained with a double <b>immuno-histochemical</b> <b>technique</b> which utilised a keratin antibody AE 1 -AE 3 (1 : 2, 000) and an endothelial antibody Factor VIII (1 : 10, 000) to enable simultaneous labelling of ERM and blood vessels. ERM and blood vessel counts were obtained from the mesio-buccal roots of three week, four week and six week-old rats, whilst qualitative observations were made for the earlier developmental stages. RESULTS: ERM cells and cell clusters were found in the tooth third of the PDL width at the three, four and six week stages. Cells and cell clusters increased in number with age, especially in the upper third of the mesio-buccal root. The largest numbers of cells and clusters were found on the distal surfaces of the roots in all age groups. Cells and clusters in all root surfaces increased from three to four weeks, but decreased from four to six weeks. The greatest number of blood vessels was found in the bone-side third of the PDL. The distal surface had the highest proportion of blood vessels, and the palatal surface the least proportion. The number of blood vessels in all surface quadrants did not vary much from three to four weeks of age, but increased from four to six weeks of age, possibly as a reaction to tooth emergence and occlusal function. Physiological root resorption was only observed after tooth emergence, and appeared to be related to loss of continuity of the ERM network and the incursion of blood vessels. CONCLUSIONS: Orthodontic root resorption can be regarded as an exaggerated response to loss of PDL homeostatic control, possibly mediated by the epithelial rests of Malassez.

Firstly, this study assessed MTSS 1 expression levels within breast cancer patients to reveal any clinical relevance. Secondly, we aimed to clarify the cellular function of MTSS 1 in breast cancer cells. MTSS 1 expression levels were assessed in a cohort of breast cancer specimens (normal n= 33; cancer n= 127), through quantitative PCR analysis and <b>immuno-histochemical</b> <b>techniques.</b> The influence of MTSS 1 was further examined via biological overexpression and knockdown within breast cancer cell lines. We report that patients with tumours expressing reduced levels of MTSS 1 had a poorer prognosis (p= 0. 042). High levels of MTSS 1 correlated with an increased patient overall survival (p= 0. 0108) and disease-free survival (p= 0. 012). Furthermore, overexpression of MTSS 1 significantly suppressed (p< 0. 01) the invasive, migratory, growth and adherence properties of a human breast cancer cell line. In contrast, knockdown of MTSS 1 dramatically enhanced these properties. We conclude that MTSS 1 is a prognostic indicator of disease-free survival in breast cancer patients and demonstrates the ability to play a role in governing the metastatic nature of breast cancer cells...|$|R

We previously reported that brief exposure to low concentrations of nicotine induced sustained potentiation of glutamatergic transmission at ventral hippocampal (vHipp) -striatal synapses. Here, we exploited nAChR subtype-selective antagonists and agonists and α 7 *nAChR knockout mutant mice (α 7 -/-) to elucidate the signaling mechanisms underlying nAChR-mediated modulation of synaptic transmission. Using a combination of micro-slices culture from WT and α 7 -/-mice, calcium imaging, and <b>immuno-histochemical</b> <b>techniques,</b> we found that nicotine elicits localized and oscillatory increases in intracellular Ca 2 + along vHipp axons that persists for up to 30 minutes. The sustained phase of the nicotine-induced Ca 2 + response was blocked by α-BgTx but not by DHβE and was mimicked by α 7 *nAChR agonists but not by non-α 7 *nAChR agonists. In vHipp slices from α 7 -/- mice, nicotine elicited only transient increases of axonal Ca 2 + signals and did not activate CaMKII. The sustained phase of the nicotine-induced Ca 2 + response required localized activation of CaMKII, phospholipase C, and IP 3 receptor mediated Ca 2 +-induced Ca 2 + release (CICR). In conclusion, activation of presynaptic nAChRs by nicotine elicits Ca 2 + influx into the presynaptic axons, the sustained phase of the nicotine-induced Ca 2 + response requires that axonal α 7 *nACh...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to evaluate the homing potential of mouse embryonic stem cells (ESC) treated with erythropoietin (EPO) in hematopoietic organs such as spleen and liver after transplantation using morphological and <b>immuno-histochemical</b> <b>techniques.</b> Methods: Day-four embryoid body (EB) -derived cells were dissociated and re-plated in medium in the presence and absence of EPO for three days. The EPO- and untreated differentiated cells were labeled with 5 -bromo- 2 deoxyuridine (BrdU) before transplantation and analyzed using flow cytometry and reverse transcription-PCR methods. BrdU-labeled cells were injected via the tail vein into irradiated adult mice in both groups. The spleen colony-forming unit assay (CFU-S) was performed 12 days after transplantation. Immuno-histochemistry was also carried out to trace transplanted cells. Results: The percentage of CD 34 positive cells was 5. 51 ± 1. 06 % in the EPO-treated group and 1. 63 ± 0. 225 % in untreated group. The RT-PCR analysis showed that the EPO-treated cells expressed ε globin, βH 1 globin, RUNX 1 and EPO receptor genes, but the beta-major globin gene was not expressed. The number of colonies formed in the spleens of treated group (17. 33 ± 4. 726) was significantly different from the control group (6 ± 1).

40|$|PosterInternational audienceObjective. Concerning the {{antidepressant}} {{effect of}} Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) a preliminary {{study did not}} demonstrate any genotoxic effect (Charlet de Sauvage et al., BioEM 05, June 2005, Dublin) of a rTMS single session. Our objective was to evaluate the toxicity of rTMS signals with the full protocol used in clinical trials. Methods. The protocol {{is the same as}} that followed by Pr Auriacombe and Pr Tignol at the Charles Perrens hospital (Bordeaux, France) in their clinical trial, including the starting polarity of the rTMS signal. The clinical paradigms published mention rTMS centered on the dorso-prefrontal cortex, on the left side for high frequency stimulation (> 1 Hz) or on the right side for low frequencies. The most serious side effect is the very exceptional occurrence of epileptic seizure (the 8 cases observed since 1985 occurred at high frequencies, between 5 et 25 Hz). To avoid this effect, the clinical team changed to a low frequency paradigm: a daily session of 3 trains of 60 magnetic stimulations at 1 Hz at 110 % of motor threshold, during 4 weeks. Consequently, compared with the in vivo experiment reported on rats in Dublin, the number of exposure sessions in the present experiment was increased from one day to 4 weeks (5 days per week). The frequency of the rTMS signal was lowered from 10 /s to 1 /s and the target was the right prefrontal cortex instead of the left one. Magnetic pulses induced by one-sine currents (duration 340 μs), and with an amplitude reaching 110 % of the hind-limb motor threshold were used. Each exposure session consisted in a sequence of 3 trains of 60 magnetic pulses at 1 Hz separated by a resting period of 10 seconds, so that the total duration of a session was 3 min 20 s. A total of 180 pulses per day were delivered to the animals as compared with 2000 for the preliminary experiment. Rats were exposed to the rTMS signal produced by a coil placed on top of the skull but not touching the head, with the coil parallel to the skull and the coil axis passing through the bregma point, as defined in the atlas of Paxinos and Watson (1986). Mapping of the induced electric field, hence of the induced current density, was established for the flat 6. 3 cm diameter coil used in this experiment. Eddy currents induced in the rat brain were calculated using a rat head simulation derived from the Brooks model constructed from MRI images in the rat and tissue conductivities estimated from low-frequency literature data. A software designed in the MatLab environment, based on the resolution of node and mesh equations, was used and validated. Peak current densities were estimated at around 5. 1 A/m 2 in the whole brain (range 0. 19 to 14. 6 A/m 2) and 4. 7 A/m 2 at the prefrontal cortex. Genotoxicity was evaluated on rat brain cells using the alkaline Comet assay. A total of eight animals per group (sham-exposed and exposed rats) was used. Conclusion and perspectives. The results of the effects of a 4 week daily sequence of rTMS signals on the induction of DNA damages (genotoxicity) will be presented. As part of this project and in order to study the molecular mechanisms of the antidepressant effect of rTMS we plan to investigate the role of serotonin (5 -HT), a neurotransmitter the implication of which was suggested by Kanno et al. (J. Pharmacol. Sci., 93 : 451 - 457, 2003). rTMS may suppress depressive symptoms by decreasing the affinity of type 5 HT 1 receptors for serotonin (Massot et al, Brain Res, 858 : 143 - 150, 2000). The localisation of the serotonin receptors in the brain will be obtained using an <b>immuno-histochemical</b> <b>technique</b> (autoradiography). The affinity of the receptors will be determined by the binding method in brain slices of rats exposed to rTMS. The period of maximum effect following rTMS exposure can be chosen to localise serotonin in the brain with maximum chances of detection. Also this will be determinant for clinical application...|$|E
40|$|Changes in {{glycosylation}} of glycoproteins and glycolipids is {{a common}} feature of cancer and may influence cancer cell behaviour, perhaps by enabling cell-cell interactions which favour metastasis or by allowing cancer cells to evade immuno-surveillance. Studies to identify glycosylation changes in human cancer have often used <b>immuno-histochemical</b> <b>techniques</b> with lectins or antibodies and human tissue sections. Whilst some detailed biochemical studies have been performed there are few clinically relevant studies since the numbers of specimens evaluated are often very small. Using an immuno-histochemical approach, {{we have found that}} the lectin HPA from the albumen gland of Helix pomatia detects aggressive metastatic breast cancers. We have sought to identify the breast cancer associated oligosaccharides and the proteins to which they are attached via 2 -DE for proteome analysis and HPLC separations for glycosylation mapping. Sixty-nine breast cancer specimens were studied. The HPA staining pattern, clinical treatment and follow-up data were known. Oligosaccharides that related to HPA staining were identified and found in elevated levels in metastatic breast cancer specimens. Human breast and colorectal cancer cells grown in vitro and in a clinically relevant animal model of metastasis also show increased levels of the oligosaccharides. We are now structurally characterising the oligosaccharides and aim to use them as diagnostic tools and targets for immuno-therapy of breast and other solid tumours...|$|R

The {{purpose of this}} thesis was to {{provide insight into the}} muscular basis for human jaw function at young age. Extrafusal and intrafusal fibres in the young masseter, and for comparison young biceps, were examined for composition of fibre types and myosin heavy chain (MyHC) isoforms by means of morphological, enzyme-histochemical, biochemical and <b>immuno-histochemical</b> <b>techniques.</b> For evaluation of plasticity during life span the data for young muscles were compared with previous reported data for adult and elderly muscles. The results showed significant differences in extrafusal fibre types and MyHC expression between young masseter and young biceps and between young masseter and masseter in adults and elderly. Compared with young biceps, young masseter was more intricate in composition of extrafusal MyHC expression. Muscle spindles were larger and more frequent in the masseter than in the biceps. Masseter and biceps muscle spindles showed fundamental similarities but also marked differences in MyHC expression. The results suggest that the young masseter is specialized in fibre types already at young age and shows a unique fibre type growth pattern. Whereas masseter extrafusal fibres display marked plasticity in fibre types and MyHC isoforms during life span muscle spindles/intrafusal fibres are morphologically mature already at young age and precede extrafusal fibres in growth and maturation. Results showed similarities in intrafusal MyHC expression between young masseter and biceps, but also differences implying muscle specific proprioceptive control. Differences in fibre types and MyHC expression between young masseter and young biceps extrafusal fibres are proposed to reflect diverse evolutionary and developmental origins and accord with the masseter and biceps being separate allotypes of muscle...|$|R

40|$|KEY WORDS {{confocal}} microscopy; volume imaging; tissue processing; microstructure; visualisation ABSTRACT Confocal microscopy enables constitutive {{elements of}} cells and tissues {{to be viewed}} at high resolution and reconstructed in three dimensions, but is constrained by the limited extent of the volumes that can be imaged. We have developed an automated technique that enables serial confocal images to be acquired over large tissue areas and volumes. The computer-controlled system, which integrates a confocal microscope and an ultramill using a high-precision translation stage, inherently preserves specimen registration, and the user control interface enables flexible specification of imaging protocols {{over a wide range}} of scales and resolutions. With this system it is possible to reconstruct specified morphological features in three dimensions and locate them accurately throughout a tissue sample. We have successfully imaged various samples at 1 -lm voxel resolution on volumes up to 4 mm 3 and on areas up to 75 mm 2. Used in conjunction with appropriate embedding media and <b>immuno-histochemical</b> probes, the <b>techniques</b> described in this paper make it possible to routinely map the distributions of key intracellular structures over much larger tissue domains than has been easily achievable in the past.

40|$|The monthly hoof horn {{production}} rate, monthly horn {{loss and}} the quality of the coronary horn was examined in the dorsal part of the hoof capsule of Przewalski horses. In order to demonstrate alterations induced by domestication, the results of this study were then compared to related data on the hooves of domestic horses in the literature and a concurrent study on the hoof of warm-blooded horses (KÖNIG, in preparation). The horn production rate and the horn loss were measured on the hooves of 15 Przewalski horses. The hooves were marked, and each month the downward movement of the markers towards the distal margin of the hoof capsule was measured over a period of two and a half years. The annual mean values of the examined wild horses lie within the standard variation of the values published for different domestic horse races. But a domestication-related effect can still be detected, because the values of the Przewalski horses, which were kept in a semi-reservate, show more seasonal variations than those of domestic horses. This difference between domestic and wild equides is most likely derived from the different housing condit ions. In the examined Przewalski horses, both the hoof horn production rate as well as the horn loss are significantly higher in the summer than in the winter time. The annual variations of the horn production rate are particularly influenced by the climatic conditions (environmental temperature and length of day light), but also by the differing seasonal locomotory activity of the horses and the varying food supply. The loss of horn, amongst others, is influenced by the seasonal variations in ground conditions, hoof horn quality, locomotory activity and the body weight of the horses. Another seasonality is apparent in the occurrence of broken-out horn chips in the hoof weight bearing margin, acting as an additional mechanism for hoof length regulation in horses which are kept in reservates and thus suffer from insufficient hoof horn abrasion. The horn quality was studied on the hooves of 10 Przewalski horses which were kept in semi-reservates or in zoological gardens. Apart from a material test by mechanical-technical testing devices, an examination of structural parameters (horn architecture, inter- and intracellular factors) was carried out. The range of methods covered light-microscopical and scanning and transmission electron microscopical as well as histometric, histochemical and <b>immuno-histochemical</b> <b>techniques.</b> In addition, the inter- and intracellular proteins were separated by gel-electrophoresis, and the cytokeratins were identified immunochemically. In order to examine the influence of structural parameters on the mechanical-physical horn characteristics, the results on the horn structure were then related to the results gained by the material testing methods. The horn quality differs in the different regions of the coronary horn, therefore a corresponding localisation of sample-taking is the prerequisite for comparative examination of the horn quality of domestic and wild horses. Keeping that in mind, minor differences in the coronary horn of warm-blooded horses and Przewalski are detectable. The outer coronary horn of the examined Przewalski horses is harder than that of warm-blooded horses. In Przewalski horses, all regions of the coronary horn show a lower water-storing-capacity. These differences in the mechanical-physical horn characteristics are reflected by an equally differing horn structure: The coronary horn of Przewalski horses is characterised by smaller and more densely packed horn tubules which additionally show a decreased cortical-medullar ratio compared to the respective horn tubules in warm-blooded horses. Even the cyto-architecture shows differences in both types of horses: in przewalski horses remainders of the cell nuclei are always present, whereas in warm-blooded horses the cornified cells are mostly nuclei-free. Comparing the results of the gel-electrophoresis, Przewalski and warm-blooded horses show a similar protein band pattern, but the staining intensity differs slightly in some protein bands. The mentioned differences in the horn quality of domestic and wild horses are mainly induced by genetic factors and may therefore be influenced by selective breeding. An influence of the housing conditions on the hoof horn quality of Przewalski horses was not detectable in the examined specimens. In the examined Przewalski horses, both horn hardness as well as horn structure (horn architecture and intercellular factors) vary according to the time of horn production. These seasonal variations in hoof horn quality are correlated to the seasonal variations in the horn production rate and contribute to the seasonal rhythm of horn abrasion and are also responsible for the occurrence of broken-out horn chips in the hoof weight bearing margin...|$|R

The present study aimed at investigating the expression, function and potential regulation of TRPM 8 channels by ER alpha (estrogen receptor alpha) in breast cancer. Methods RT-PCR, Western blot, <b>immuno-histochemical,</b> and siRNA <b>techniques</b> {{were used to}} investigate TRPM 8 expression, its regulation by estrogen receptors, and its expression in breast tissue. To investigate the channel activity in MCF- 7 cells, we used the whole cell patch clamp and the calcium imaging techniques. Results TRPM 8 channels are expressed at both mRNA and protein levels in the breast cancer cell line MCF- 7. Bath application of the potent TRPM 8 agonist Icilin (20 μM) induced a strong outwardly rectifying current at depolarizing potentials, which is associated with an elevation of cytosolic calcium concentration, consistent with established TRPM 8 channel properties. RT-PCR experiments revealed a decrease in TRPM 8 mRNA expression following steroid deprivation for 48 and 72 hours. In steroid deprived medium, addition of 17 -beta-estradiol (E 2, 10 nM) increased both TRPM 8 mRNA expression {{and the number of}} cells which respond to Icilin, but failed to affect the Ca 2 + entry amplitude. Moreover, silencing ERα mRNA expression with small interfering RNA reduced the expression of TRPM 8. Immuno-histochemical examination of the expression of TRPM 8 channels in human breast tissues revealed an over-expression of TRPM 8 in breast adenocarcinomas, which is correlated with estrogen receptor positive (ER +) status of the tumours. Conclusion Taken together, these results show that TRPM 8 channels are expressed and functional in breast cancer and that their expression is regulated by ER alpha. </p...|$|R

Materials and MethodsHistopathological techniques were used to investigate the pathogenesis of radiation myelopathy. Interpretation of the pathogenesis of the spinal cord radiation injury pathogenesis was based, besides the assessment of functional injury mainly on morphological observations of histological specimens. In experimental models of radiation myelopathy, modern <b>immuno-histochemical</b> or immuno-enzymatic <b>techniques</b> have been used only sparsely that might convey functionally oriented information in addition to accurate definition of the various cells that participate in the evolutions of radiation myelopathy. ResultsUsing paralysis as the endpoint, data from experiments with large fraction sizes, i. e. 19 Gy down to 2 Gy / fraction, were consistent with the linear quadratic (LQ) model and α/β value of 2. 41 Gy. Data from experiments with small fraction sizes, i. e. 2 Gy down to 1 Gy/ fraction, however, gave a much smaller value of 0. 48 Gy for */*. It reveals that the LQ model failed to provide a satisfactory description of the dose – fractionation response relationship in rat spinal cord. ConclusionThe change of fractionation sensitivity as doses per fraction are decreased suggests that at least two different types of target cells interact in the pathogenesis, each having different fractionation sensitivities. Recent in vitro clonogenic investigations in vitro or in vivo fractionated irradiation of adult rat glial progenitor cells revealed a much higher α/β value (4. 9 – 7. 3 Gy) for these stem cells, although this could be related to the proliferation state of these cells. Besides glial stem cells, vascular endothelial cell are candidates for primary target cell populations.
