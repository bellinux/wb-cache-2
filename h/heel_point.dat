5000|$|A {{design feature}} of the Montego {{includes}} its overall height to add interior space to the vehicle. To appeal to buyers of both sedans and sport-utility vehicles, Ford raised the viewpoint of the driver. Marketed as Command Seating, the Montego features high H-point seating (the location of the occupants hip-point relative to the road or the vehicle floor); its H-point {{is closer to the}} ground than that of a sport utility vehicle, but higher than a typical sedan, easing entry and exit. Also, the distance from the H-point {{to the floor of the}} vehicle is reflective of more upright seating. At its press launch, Ford said the Five Hundred's H-point is up to four and a half inches higher than its competitors. The Montego also features theater seating, where second row seats are higher: in the front row, the distance between the H-point and the <b>heel</b> <b>point,</b> where the occupant's foot touches the floor, is 12.7 inches [...] - [...] in the second row the distance between the H-point and the <b>heel</b> <b>point</b> is 15.7 inches.|$|E
30|$|As can be {{seen from}} Fig.  2, SHS {{pressure}} decreases with the increase in distance from <b>heel</b> <b>point.</b> As shown in Fig.  3, SHS temperature in IT decreases with distance from <b>heel</b> <b>point.</b> However, while there exists heat loss from SHS in annuli to oil layer, SHS temperature in annuli increases when SHS flows from toe point to <b>heel</b> <b>point.</b> This is because the wellbore heat losses are offset by energy absorbed from IT, as shown in Fig.  4. The heat flow rate from SHS in IT to annuli is obviously higher at the <b>heel</b> <b>point</b> than that at the toe point. Consequently, SHS temperature in annuli has an increase at the <b>heel</b> <b>point.</b> Figure  5 shows the distributions of superheat degree in IT and annuli. It is found that superheat degree decreases when SHS flows from <b>heel</b> <b>point</b> to toe point in annuli, while it increases when SHS flows from toe point to <b>heel</b> <b>point</b> in annuli. This is because the lower-temperature SHS in annuli absorbs huge amount of energy from the higher-temperature SHS in IT. Figure  6 shows clearly that it is a constant mass flow process in IT and it is a variable mass flow in annuli. This is because a certain amount of SHS in annuli is injected into oil layer due to the pressure difference between annuli and oil layer.|$|E

30|$|As can be {{seen from}} Fig.  7, SHS {{pressure}} in both IT and annuli increases with the increase in injection pressure at <b>heel</b> <b>point</b> in IT. Figure  8 shows that SHS temperature in both IT and annuli increases with the increase in injection pressure. This is because the SHS density increases with the increase in injection pressure, which causes the decrease in flow velocity. And the friction losses decrease accordingly with the decrease in flow velocity, which causes the increase in SHS temperature in IT and annuli. Besides, the temperature difference between IT and annuli decreases with the increases in injection pressure, which causes the decrease in heat exchange rate between IT and annuli, as shown in Fig.  9.|$|E

Using methods previously developed for automotive applications, new models were created for seating accommodation, eye location, head (helmet) clearance, knee clearance, and torso clearance. The resulting models are applicable to driver positions with a fixed <b>heel</b> <b>point</b> {{and a range of}} steering wheel locations typical of tactical vehicles. The models were developed based on driver posture data but could be used for other front seat environments (e. g., commander position) with certain assumptions.

40|$|Objectives: The {{present study}} was carried out to {{evaluate}} the utility and reliability of footprint dimensions in age, sex and stature determination in the North Indian population. Materials and Methods: This study was carried out using a sample of 400 people (146 female and 254 male) aged 10 - 65 years in Uttar Pradesh, North Western state of India. Footprints of both feet were taken bilaterally, and thus a total of 800 prints were obtained. A cluster of 7 measurements were taken carefully {{with the help of}} a scientific scale ruler. Five measurements were length dimensions from the most anterior part of the toe (T 1 –T 5) to the mid rear <b>heel</b> <b>point</b> and two were breadth dimensions from both left and right footprints: breadth at ball (BBAL), breadth at heel (BHEL) and 2 indexes: heel-ball Index (HBI) and footprint index (FPI). All data were analyzed statistically using Student’s t-test, regression coefficient and Pearson’s correlation for the estimation of sex on the basis of footprint dimensions. Results: The T 1 in left footprints was greater than right footprints in males, while T 1 and BBAL were both found to be greater in left footprints than right footprints in females. All the seven foot dimensions were higher in males than females. Conclusion: There were statistically significant differences observed in all footprint dimensions between the male and female footprints except LFPI, LHBI, and RHBI...|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} sought to verify the utility and {{reliability}} of footprint dimensions in sex determination in a Ghanaian population. Bilateral footprints were obtained from 126 Ghanaian students (66 males and 60 females) aged 18 - 30 years at Koforidua Polytechnic using an ink pad and white papers. Seven dimensions-length of each toe (designated T 1 -T 5) from the most anterior point of the toe to the mid-rear <b>heel</b> <b>point,</b> breadth at ball (BAB) and breadth at heel (BAH) [...] and the heel-ball (HB) index were obtained from each footprint. Some footprint dimensions (i. e. T 2, T 3, T 4 and T 5) showed statistically significant bilateral asymmetry in males only. All the footprint dimensions, except HB index, were significantly greater in males than females (p< 0. 001). Applied singly in discriminant function analysis, the footprint dimensions allowed 69. 8 %- 80. 3 % of cases to be correctly classified into their sex groups; the accuracy of sex classification was higher using left footprints than right footprints. With all dimensions subjected to stepwise discriminant function analysis 80. 3 % and 77 % of cases could be correctly classified, combining both T 5 and BAH for left footprints and T 1, BAB and BAH for left footprints respectively. The present study has demonstrated, {{for the first time}} among Ghanaian subjects, the utility and reliability of sex determination standards developed from footprint dimensions. The results thus provide the baseline for elaborated studies in the future...|$|E
40|$|Digital human {{modeling}} (DHM), as {{a convenient}} and cost-effective tool, is increasingly incorporated into product and workplace design. In product design, it is predominantly {{used for the}} development of driver-vehicle systems. Most digital human modeling software tools, such as JACK, RAMSIS and DELMIA HUMANBUILDER provide functions to predict posture and positions for drivers with selected anthropometry according to SAE (Society of Automotive Engineers) Recommended Practices and other ergonomics guidelines. However, few studies have presented 2 nd row passenger postural information, and digital human modeling of these passenger postures cannot be performed directly using the existing driver posture prediction functions. In this paper, the significant studies related to occupant posture and modeling were reviewed and a framework of determinants of driver vs. 2 nd row occupant posture modeling was extracted. The determinants which are regarded as input factors for posture modeling include target population anthropometry, vehicle package geometry and seat design variables as well as task definitions. The differences between determinants of driver and 2 nd row occupant posture models are significant, as driver posture modeling is primarily based on the position of the foot on the accelerator pedal (accelerator actuation point AAP, accelerator <b>heel</b> <b>point</b> AHP) and the hands on the steering wheel (steering wheel centre point A-Point). The objectives of this paper are aimed to investigate those differences between driver and passenger posture, and to supplement the existing parametric model for occupant posture prediction. With the guide of the framework, the associated input parameters of occupant digital human models of both driver and second row occupant will be identified. Beyond the existing occupant posture models, for example a driver posture model could be modified to predict second row occupant posture, by adjusting the associated input parameters introduced in this paper. This study combines results from a literature review and the theoretical modeling stage of a second row passenger posture prediction model project...|$|E

5000|$|Dirtsurfing with a kite or kitewing {{is called}} wingsurfing and is {{performed}} on flat open spaces such as beaches or fields. Utilizing the wind, riders can achieve incredible air time and perform tricks {{that would otherwise}} require a massive ramp. It is even possible to ride uphill with sufficient wind. Unlike powerkiting with a mountain board, the Dirtsurfer is unidirectional; that is, it only goes one direction. However, it is possible, using {{the power of a}} kite or kitewing, to tack and gybe, much like a boat or windsurfer to change direction. Unlike a windsurfer however, it is not practical to change sides when coming {{to the end of a}} run in one direction. To overcome this, most riders can make the transition from [...] "heel-side" [...] to [...] "toe-side". Riding toe-side means that your toes not your <b>heels,</b> <b>point</b> towards the floor as you lean forward into the wind, with your kitewing or kite behind you. This is not as difficult as it sounds. Due to the gyroscopic stability of the Dirtsurfer, speed is limited only by the wind, with recorded speeds well over 40 mph on a flat surface.|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} bodyweight unloading on the excitability of the nociceptive withdrawal reflex (NWR) and of its receptive fields organisation during quiet stance in humans. Methods: The NWR was elicited in 14 volunteers by electrical stimulation of the {{sole of the foot}} at mid-forefoot, arch, and <b>heel</b> <b>points.</b> Participants stood upright and wore a whole-body harness connected via a rope to a pulley. Data were recorded at 0 %, 10 %, 25 % and 40 % of the bodyweight unloading. The root mean square of the EMG activity was measured bilaterally from several lower limb muscles. Kinematics of ankle, knee, and hip were measured bilaterally using goniometers. Results: Two-way ANOVA for repeated measures revealed higher reflex sizes at higher degrees of unloading in the tibialis anterior, soleus, and biceps femoris muscles and in the kinematics of the knee joint of the ipsilateral limb. No interaction between stimulation site and unloading was revealed. Conclusions: Unloading induced a generalised enhancement of NWR excitability without modifying the reflex receptive field organisation. Significance: Our study indicates that bodyweight unloading in general enhances the NWR excitability and suggests that only load-related afferent inputs in concert with joint movements may modify the modular organisation of the NWR. © 2011 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology...|$|R
