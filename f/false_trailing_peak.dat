5000|$|A false scent or <b>false</b> <b>trail</b> is an {{incorrect}} scent which may mislead an animal which hunts by smell, especially a hound.

These are examples of [...] "non violent direct action tactics".|$|R

Hergé continued The Adventures of Tintin with Flight 714 to Sydney, while the series itself became a defining part of the Franco-Belgian comics tradition. The story was adapted for the 1991 animated series The Adventures of Tintin by Ellipse and Nelvana.|$|R
