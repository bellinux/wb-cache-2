40|$|Seismic <b>fragilities</b> of {{buildings}} are often developed without consideration of soil-structure interaction (SSI), where {{base of the}} building {{is assumed to be}} fixed. This study highlights effect of SSI and uncertainty in soil properties such as friction angle, cohesion, density, shear modulus and Poisson's ratio and foundation parameters on seismic <b>fragilities</b> of non-ductile reinforced concrete frames resting in dense silty sand. Three-, five-, and nine-storey three-bay moment resisting reinforced concrete frames resting on isolated shallow foundation are studied and the numerical models for SSI are developed in OpenSees. Three sets of 10 ground motions, with mean spectrum of 100, 500, and 1000 yr return period hazard level (matching EC- 8 design spectrum), are used for the nonlinear time history analyses. An optimized Latin Hyper Cube sampling technique is used to draw the sample of soil properties and foundation parameters. The <b>fragilities</b> are developed for the fixed base model and SSI models. However, the <b>fragilities</b> that incorporate the soil parameter and foundation uncertainties are only slightly different from those based solely on the uncertainty in seismic demand from earthquake ground motion, suggesting that <b>fragilities</b> that are developed under the assumption that all soil and foundation parameters at their median (or mean) values are sufficient for the purpose of earthquake damage or loose estimation of structures resting on dense silty sand. But the consideration of the SSI effect has the significant influence on the <b>fragilities</b> compare to the fixed base model. The structural parameter uncertainty and foundation modeling uncertainty are not considered in the study...|$|R

40|$|A {{performance}} {{model and}} a reliability-based optimization model for flexible pavements {{that accounts for}} the effects of rehabilitation actions are developed. The developed performance model can be effectively implemented in all the applications that require the reliability (performance) of pavements, before and after the rehabilitation actions. The response surface methodology in conjunction with Monte Carlo simulation is used to evaluate pavement <b>fragilities.</b> To provide more flexibility, the parametric regression model that expresses <b>fragilities</b> in terms of decision variables is developed. Developed <b>fragilities</b> are used as performance measures in a reliability-based optimization model. Three decision policies for rehabilitation actions are formulated and evaluated using a genetic algorithm. The multi-objective genetic algorithm is used for obtaining optimal trade-off between performance and cost. To illustrate the developed model, a numerical study is presented. The developed performance model describes well the behavior of flexible pavement before as well as after rehabilitation actions. The sensitivity measures suggest that the reliability of flexible pavements before and after rehabilitation actions can effectively be improved by providing an asphalt layer as thick as possible in the initial design and improving the subgrade stiffness. The importance measures suggest that the asphalt layer modulus at the time of rehabilitation actions represent the principal uncertainty for the performance after rehabilitation actions. Statistical validation of the developed response model shows that the response surface methodology can be efficiently used to describe pavement responses. The results for parametric regression model indicate that the developed regression models are able to express the <b>fragilities</b> in terms of decision variables. Numerical illustration for optimization shows that the cost minimization and reliability maximization formulations can be efficiently used in determining optimal rehabilitation policies. Pareto optimal solutions obtained from multi-objective genetic algorithm can be used to obtain trade-off between cost and performance and avoid possible conflict between two decision policies...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to derive <b>fragilities</b> of the nonstructural {{components}} of hospital from damage survey data, and to propose an evaluation sheet for the use of logic-tree analysis in the risk assessment. First, after three major earthquakes occurred in Japan in 2003, damage surveys by questionnaire were conducted on hospitals near the earthquake observation stations. The damage ratios are obtained by correlating the statistical results of damage to the recorded seismic intensities. Secondly, <b>fragilities</b> are derived from the damage ratios, by the following 4 steps. (1) Seismic capacity of each component is classified into three groups: basic, deficiency 1 and deficiency 2, according to the construction conditions. (2) Seismic capacity is expressed by lognormal distribution. Based on earthquake damage experience, the acceleration corresponding to damage probability of 1 % for the three groups are set as the relation: 1 A to 0. 55 A to 0. 3 A. (3) Existing ratios of the buildings having the components of the three groups are set by referring to a survey conducted by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, Japan. (4) The damage ratios are sum of multiplying the nonstructural component’s damage probability of a whole building with the existing ratios, thus the acceleration corresponding to damage probability of 1 % is obtained from the damage ratios by the least square method. Finally, with the derived <b>fragilities,</b> an evaluation sheet is developed, in which a table with rows of three seismic capacity groups and columns of acceleration levels is shown to read the damage probability. Due to the diversities in practice of nonstructural components in different countries, the process, from damage surveys to <b>fragilities</b> and evaluation sheets, adopted in this study can be used to derive a country’s data that reflect local practice...|$|R

5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Peloponnesian War, the militaristic city-state of Sparta had been able to impose a hegemony over the heartland of Classical Greece (the Peloponessus and mainland Greece south of Thessaly), the states of this area having been severely weakened by the war. This state of affairs was resented by many of the Greek city-states, which had traditionally been ferociously independent, and led directly to the Corinthian War of 395–387 BC. Sparta emerged from this conflict with its hegemony intact, though only as a result of Persian intervention, which led to the so-called King's Peace. The <b>fragility</b> of Spartan dominance had been demonstrated however, and in the next decade, the Thebans would revolt against Sparta. The Spartans were unable to successfully quell the revolt, leading to de facto Theban independence. Then, after several years of desultory conflict, the Thebans finally met the Spartans in open battle at Leuctra (371 BC), and under the leadership of Epaminondas inflicted an unprecedented defeat on the Spartan army, killing the Spartan king Cleombrotus I in the process.|$|E

It was then given by the French to the United States where it was re-bored to fit American shells and the carriage constructed, but this work was completed too late for it to see use in the Spanish–American War. The cannon soon became obsolete and was donated to Southwestern Academy in San Marino, California, where it was displayed on the front lawn starting in 1925. By 1972, the school was seeking to discard the cannon, and a group of Caltech students from Fleming House took possession of the cannon and laboriously restored it to working condition. The cannon was returned to Southwestern in 1975 at the insistence of the Caltech administration, but it was permanently restored to Caltech in 1981. The cannon is one of the few objects at Caltech which is designated as unprankable given its age, <b>fragility,</b> and irreplaceable nature.|$|E

Sporadic skirmishes along the border continued until 1839, when the Dutch signed the Treaty of London. The Ten Days' Campaign revealed the <b>fragility</b> of the Belgian position, and although the Dutch finally recognized the independence of Belgium, the Belgians were forced to give up some disputed territories, including Zeelandic Flanders and the Duchy of Limburg.

Risk is greater in younger people due to binge drinking which may result in violence or accidents. About 3.3 million deaths (5.9% of all deaths) are believed to be due to alcohol each year. Alcoholism reduces a person's life expectancy by around ten years and alcohol use is the third leading cause of early death in the United States.
