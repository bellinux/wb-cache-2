40|$|Part 4 : Protocols and PerformanceInternational audienceThere is no {{effective}} method to support IP level Internet wide multisource multicast sessions, {{that can be}} easily used from almost every ISP There are several protocols implementing the necessary functionality, but the penetration of them is really low recently. The most obvious work all-round is using SSM – Source Specific Multicasting, in which, the IP multicast session is identified by the multicast group address and the source’s unicast IP address. SSM allows using all the SSM address range for every source IP addresses and limits the address allocation problem inside the host of the source; however, its significant drawback is that the SSM has no native support to create multicast sessions with more than one source; it uses separate source specific distribution trees for every single source therefore it needs more resources on the router side. The alternative solution for supporting multisource multicast session is the ASM – Any Source Multicasting. However, its significant drawback is the lack of Internet wide <b>dynamic</b> <b>address</b> <b>allocation.</b> To address the recent problems of the Internet wide multisource multicast session a novel IP multicast service model, the Responsible Source Multicasting - RSM is introduced in this paper. RSM uses shared distribution trees like ASM; however, builds a reverse path tree towards an appropriate well-known unicast IP address like SSM. The paper demonstrates that this novel multicast routing protocol handles Internet wide multisource multicast sessions.

We present the first attempt towards estimating ISP and Internet-wide DHCP churn rates, in order to better understand the relation between IP addresses and hosts, as well as allow us to correct data relying on IP addresses as a surrogate metric.

In such a network, connectivity is enabled by automatic IP address allocation and dynamic routing. MANETs are highly dynamic with members joining and rejoining, leaving, moving around freely, network partitioning and merging, <b>dynamic</b> <b>address</b> <b>allocation</b> according to location closeness or according to host’s logical affiliation. These dynamics lead to potential frequent changes of a node’s IP address. Therefore, application programs {{are more likely to}} use well known names (Domain Names) that are unique, easy to remember and/or that bear logical semantics of the parties. On-the-scene translation from a node’s well known name to its newly assigned network address faces new challenges in MANETs, which obsoletes legacy Internet Domain Name Systems.

40|$|Most current ad hoc routing {{architectures}} use flat addressing and thus, need to {{keep track}} of each node individually, creating a massive overhead problem in the form of exchanging huge routing tables as the network grows. So, scalability of routing protocols for large-scale ad hoc networks is a concern. With fixed length addressing, the overhead in control packets of source routing is high. In this paper, we attempt to solve both the above-mentioned problems using a variable length and <b>dynamic</b> <b>address</b> <b>allocation</b> scheme, which aids routing in large-scale Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs). Each node has a permanent unique identifier, which is mapped to another routing address depending on the node to which it attaches to the network. The length of this routing address is variable but remains same for all the nodes in the network at one point of time. Our scheme allocates addresses {{in such a way that}} nearby nodes have same prefixes, thereby helping the routing protocols to make use of the location information of nodes from their addresses. Routing protocols that require source routes in the headers of every packet could benefit tremendously from the use of variable length addresses.

40|$|Embedded {{systems are}} resource-constrained {{special-purpose}} computers, capable of both sensing and controlling the environment they are placed in. An embedded system usually consists of both hardware and software. The hardware can {{be composed of}} sensors, actuators, processors, memory storage devices, communication peripherals, and power supplies. The software typically includes an operating system, device drivers, and an application-specific algorithm for controlling the system's behavior. A special class of embedded systems is comprised by systems that can communicate using standard Internet protocols. Such systems, called Embedded Internet Systems (EIS), are capable of transmitting sensor data directly to the Internet without using specialized gateways. Sensor nodes (nodes in a sensor network) are an example of specialized embedded systems. Sensor nodes with wireless communication capabilities can form a wireless network of sensors. Two types of such networks are usually distinguished - Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) and Personal Area Networks (PAN). Wireless sensor networks may consist of hundreds or even thousands of sensor nodes; {{they can be used}} in industrial applications and deployed in hazardous environments, such as battlefields, volcanos, and forest fires. Personal area networks, on the other hand, are normally composed of {{a relatively small number of}} devices, which minimizes requirement on scalability. PAN devices use general-purpose technologies and standard protocols, such as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, and they are designed for applications such as video and audio streaming, web browsing, and file transfer. Today's research on WSN technology is focused on creating power-efficient large-scale networks using highly specialized protocols and technologies; they are usually intended for scientific, military, and industrial usage scenarios. Research on PAN technology targets consumer needs, where two important requirements are interoperability, through the use of general-purpose technologies and protocols, and usability, often achieved by supporting <b>dynamic</b> <b>address</b> <b>allocation</b> and well-known service discovery protocols. When sensor nodes are used in personal area networks, they should have both features normally characteristic of WSN nodes and those more typical of PAN nodes. A sensor network based on general-purpose technologies should be power-efficient while at the same time enabling interoperability with consumer devices. By using consumer devices, such as mobile phones, and widely available access networks, such as GPRS and UMTS cellular networks, such sensor nodes can achieve worldwide mobility. This is in contrast to traditional wireless sensor networks where the focus is on achieving efficient communication within the network using highly specialized protocols and technologies. This thesis investigates the feasibility of using Embedded Internet Systems as wirelessly networked sensor nodes using standard protocols and commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components. The focus is on reducing sensor nodes' power consumption while still allowing interoperability with standard consumer devices, such as mobile phones, PDAs, and computers. In other words, the goal is to merge WSN and PAN technologies to produce a new type of wirelessly networked sensor nodes with an operational lifetime in the range of months to years, which communicate using well-known protocols, such as Bluetooth and TCP/IP. Bluetooth was chosen since it is by far the most wide-spread protocol supported by existing consumer devices, and we call the resulting sensor networks Bluetooth Sensor Networks (BSN). BSN nodes are EIS devices used in the context of sensor networks, and the main motivation for this type of sensor networks is to allow sensors, such as GPS, pulse oximeters, and thermometers, to be used in conjunction with standard consumer devices and applications. The work presented in this thesis has resulted in a system architecture which supports sensor networks consisting of EIS devices with a lifetime of several years, energy scavenging capabilities, and user-oriented low-power operation. The use of TCP/IP and Bluetooth enables interoperability with existing infrastructures, such as the Internet, and mobility, when Bluetooth-enabled mobile phones are used as gateways to cellular networks. It has also be demonstrated that it is feasible to utilize Bluetooth and TCP/IP on resource-constrained networked sensor nodes, while still enabling system operational lifetimes in the range of months to years and using a total system volume of less than 10 cm 3.
