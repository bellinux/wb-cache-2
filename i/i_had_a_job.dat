5000|$|... "The band {{is part of}} our life," [...] Steinmeyer said. [...] "The band {{keeps me}} sane. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>job</b> because <b>I</b> <b>have</b> to make money...but this is what I do." [...] Richard Steinmeyer, January, 2010.|$|R
6000|$|... "These are my night's work. The bar {{is the top}} one of the grate. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>job</b> {{to loosen}} it, but there it is. The pegs I whittled out of that log." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "With me! No,--not with me. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>job</b> of {{business}} {{of my own}} which took me over to Paris. And has Phinny fled too? Poor Ratler! I shouldn't wonder if it isn't an asylum he's in before the session is over." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No; {{yesterday}} morning. She {{drove to}} me {{straight from the}} station. It was most remarkable. If <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>job</b> to get off she did nothing to make it worse--she did {{a great deal to}} make it better." [...] Mrs. Wix hung fire, though the flame in her face burned brighter; then she became capable of saying: [...] "Her ladyship's kind! She did what I didn't expect." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is {{the best}} turn the earl has done {{me for a long}} time," [...] the man replied. [...] "Never did <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>job</b> <b>I</b> fancied less than the tending of that evil {{tempered}} brute." ...|$|R
5000|$|It’s {{easy to be}} {{impressed}} by how efficiently Cordes operates, but he wishes others would view it as ordinary. “Just like you, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>job</b> to do and I {{figured out how to}} do it,” he explains. “To me, it’s gratifying how profoundly routine this all seems at times.” ...|$|R
5000|$|During {{the offseason}} on May 9, 2017, Clark {{was criticized for}} a tweet he {{directed}} at Bleacher Report journalist Natalie Weiner. Weiner had previously written about Clark's domestic violence arrest. Clark told Weiner that [...] "People like you don’t have long careers in your field. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>job</b> for you cleaning my fish tanks when that lil job is ova." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Partly," [...] she {{answered}} simply. [...] "Harry can't do anything. He owes five weeks here, and he owes you seven pounds, and his tailor's pressing him for money. He'd pawn anything he could, but he's pawned everything already. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>job</b> {{to put the}} woman off about my new dress, and on Saturday there's the book at my lodgings, and I can't get work in five minutes. It always means waiting some little time till there's a vacancy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{you think}} she will, Chetwode? Do {{you think she}} will?" [...] Mr. Weatherley demanded, anxiously. [...] "Has she missed me while I have been--where the devil have I been, Chetwode? You must tell me--tell me quick! She'll be here {{directly}} and she'll want to know. I can't remember. It was a long street {{and there was a}} public-house at the corner, and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>job</b> somewhere, hadn't I, stacking cheeses? Look here, Chetwode, you must tell me all about it. You're my private secretary. You ought to know everything of that sort." ...|$|E
60|$|There {{was a high}} wall round this garden, and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>job</b> to {{get over}} it, but once {{on the other side}} it was all plain sailing. I did not meet a soul upon the road, and the iron gate of the avenue was open. No one was moving at the lodge. The moon was shining, and I could see the great house glimmering white through an archway of trees. I walked up it for {{a quarter of a mile}} or so, until I was at the edge of the drive, where it ended in a broad, gravelled space before the main door. There I stood in the shadow and looked at the long building, with a full moon shining in every window and {{silvering}} the high stone front. I crouched there for some time, and I wondered where I should find the easiest entrance. The corner window of the side seemed to be the one which was least overlooked, and a screen of ivy hung heavily over it. My best chance was evidently there. I worked my way under the trees to the back of the house, and then crept along in the black shadow of the building. A dog barked and rattled his chain, but I stood waiting until he was quiet, and then I stole on once more until I came to the window which I had chosen.|$|E
60|$|DOOLITTLE [evasively] Certainly. I'll come, Governor. Not {{just this}} week, because <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>job</b> at <b>a</b> distance. But later on you {{may depend on}} me. Afternoon, gentlemen. Afternoon, ma'am. [He takes off his hat to Mrs. Pearce, who disdains the salutation and goes out. He winks at Higgins, {{thinking}} him probably a fellow sufferer from Mrs. Pearce's difficult disposition, and follows her].|$|R
30|$|Well, my mum {{is saying}} I should come back; and then again, there’s not really {{anything}} holding me here. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>job</b> here, but it’s not that great… it’s not like it’s a great career! And <b>I</b> don’t <b>have</b> <b>a</b> boyfriend… And if I don’t go back soon, my mother {{worries that the}} career window will close for me, and I’ll be stuck here (Maria).|$|R
500|$|In 1981, Ripken got {{to coach}} {{his own son}} as Cal Jr. reached the major leagues. He always downplayed the father-son {{relationship}}, saying in 1981 spring training, [...] "There isn't any father-son relationship here. I managed 14 years in the minors, including 1967 right in Miami, and saw hundreds of kids. They're all my sons, more or less. On this field or on this club, my son is just another ballplayer to me. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>job</b> and <b>a</b> life and so does he." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He sees me {{come along}} smartly with his brother's knife in my hand--I wasn't {{thinking}} how it looked from {{his side of}} the fence, you know--and jiminy, it nearly killed him! He stared like a crazed bullock and began to sweat and twitch all over, something amazing. I was so surprised, that I stopped to look at him. The drops were pouring over his eyebrows, down his beard, off his nose--and he gurgled. Then it struck me that he couldn't see what was in my mind. By favour or by right he didn't like to die when it came to it; not in that way, anyhow. When I stepped round to get at the lashing, he let out a sort of soft bellow. Thought I was going to stick him from behind, I guess. I cut all the turns with one slash, and he went over on his side, flop, and started kicking with his tied legs. Laugh! I don't know what there was so funny about it, but I fairly shouted. What between my laughing and his wriggling, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>job</b> in cutting him free. As soon as he could feel his limbs he makes for the bank, where the governor was standing, crawls up to him on his hands and knees, and embraces his legs. Gratitude, eh? You could see that being allowed to live suited that chap down to the ground. The governor gets his legs away from him gently and just mutters to me: ...|$|E

60|$|There {{were three}} letters and four legal papers. Like Nicholas Weaver's statement, all were badly written, and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> hard <b>job</b> to {{decipher}} even {{a portion of}} the manuscript.|$|R
5000|$|... "I'm {{fortunate}} enough that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>job</b> that provides for me really well, I {{give a lot}} of these guys credit that fight at this level. I think they could be compensated much better based on the income that the UFC takes in. Fortunately, I can just walk away and I'm OK with it. By no means do I mean it disrespectfully toward any other fighters because I think they do <b>a</b> great <b>job.</b> But hopefully Zuffa and the UFC will start paying them a little better."

5000|$|Many of the {{concepts}} and even characters created by Scott Lobdell and fellow X-Men writer Fabian Nicieza were used throughout {{the run of the}} popular 1990s X-Men: The Animated Series. Lobdell is even referenced in episode #46 of the show, [...] "One Man's Worth", where he poses as a human used to fuel Trevor Fitzroy's mutant power to travel through time. The scene shows Master Mold saying [...] "Lobdell, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>job</b> for you." [...] He is then grabbed by Fitzroy, who absorbs his life energy and creates a time portal.|$|R
5000|$|Draper {{revealed}} {{he worked}} {{in a range of}} jobs while playing part-time, quoting: [...] "When I was at Hednesford <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>job</b> at Birmingham Midshires. I worked with mortgages then in administration before I moved into the collections department." ...|$|E
5000|$|Responding to a {{question}} about whether being in the closet affected him: [...] "On a professional level, no, because I knew <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>job</b> to do. On a personal level, in some ways, yes, because {{it was hard for me}} to live sometimes knowing that I was alone or that I couldn't be open about who I wanted to date." ...|$|E
50|$|Robertson was in New York {{announcing a}} {{basketball}} game between the college and New York University at Madison Square Garden when a producer with CBS Sports Spectacular invited him to auditions that were taking place {{while he was in}} town.About two days later, the station manager of WBT-AM came in and said, ‘Congratulations on your new job, Don.’ I didn’t want them to know I was auditioning, but he said CBS had called {{to make sure it was}} okay to hire me. So that’s how I found out <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>job</b> with CBS,” he said.|$|E
5000|$|Beginning in the 1920s {{and well}} into the 1970s Shklovsky worked as a screenwriter on {{numerous}} Soviet films (see Select Filmography below), {{a part of his}} life and work that, thus far, has seen very limited attention. In his book Third Factory Shklovsky reflects on his work in film, writing: [...] "First of all, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>job</b> at the third factory of Goskino. Second of all, the name isn't hard to explain. The first factory was my family and school. The second was Opoyaz. And the third - is processing me at this very moment." ...|$|R

60|$|GERALD. No, mother--no, dear mother. You see, dear mother, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> rather <b>a</b> <b>job</b> {{between the}} two halves of myself. When you come to have the wild horses in your own soul, mother, it makes it difficult.|$|R
5000|$|... “In {{the autumn}} of 1970 <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>job</b> singing in the school system, playing my guitar in classrooms. I {{was sitting on the}} veranda one morning, reading a {{biography}} of Van Gogh, and suddenly I knew I had to write a song arguing that he wasn’t crazy. He had an illness and so did his brother Theo. This makes it different, in my mind, to the garden variety of 'crazy’ - because he was rejected by a woman was commonly thought. So I sat down with a print of Starry Night and wrote the lyrics out on a paper bag.” ...|$|E
5000|$|On June 15, 2008 the McClatchy News Service {{published}} articles {{based on interviews}} with 66 former Guantanamo captives. McClatchy reporters interviewed Mourad Benchellali in France.Benchellali acknowledged he was born in a radical family, but said he was not a radical beliefs himself: [...] "It was June 2001, and I thought I'd take a vacation, be back in time for classes in September. Later, the papers would say I was a desperate outsider, trapped looking in on an uncaring nation. But that's not true. I was happy. I was getting an education. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>job.</b> I had a fiancee. I just thought I wanted a bit of adventure." ...|$|E
5000|$|Born in St. Louis, Missouri of Irish parents, McManus had {{an innate}} gift for drawing {{and a sense}} of humor. He {{recalled}} an incident when he was in high school: [...] "My teacher sent home to my parents a picture I had drawn of a classmate named Sweeney. This is what your boy has been doing, the teacher wrote, icily. I laid the note in Pops lap and headed wearily for the woodshed. But Pop, instead, put on his hat and coat and went to the editor of The Republican. He showed Sweeney to the editor. Next day <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>job</b> on The Republican at $5 a week—as an errand boy." ...|$|E
