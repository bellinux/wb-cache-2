40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was {{to determine the effects of}} a high protein diet over a one-year period. Fourteen healthy resistance-trained men completed the study (mean ± SD; age [*]yr; height [*]cm; and average years of training [*]yr). In a randomized crossover design, subjects consumed their habitual or normal diet <b>for</b> 2 <b>months</b> <b>and</b> 4 <b>months</b> <b>and</b> alternated that with a higher protein diet (3 ̆e 3 [*]g/kg/d) <b>for</b> 2 <b>months</b> <b>and</b> 4 <b>months.</b> Thus, on average, each subject was on their normal diet <b>for</b> 6 <b>months</b> <b>and</b> a higher protein diet <b>for</b> 6 <b>months.</b> Body composition was assessed via the Bod Pod®. Each subject provided approximately 100 – 168 daily dietary self-reports. During the subjects’ normal eating phase, they consumed (mean ± SD) [*]kcals/kg/day and [*]g/kg/day of protein. This significantly increased () during the high protein phase to [*]kcals/kg/day and [*]g/kg/day of protein. Our investigation discovered that, in resistance-trained men that consumed a high protein diet (2. 51 – 3. 32 [*]g/kg/d) for one year, there were no harmful effects on measures of blood lipids as well as liver and kidney function. In addition, despite the total increase in energy intake during the high protein phase, subjects did not experience an increase in fat mass...|$|R

40|$|Cracked {{reinforced}} concrete (RC) beams can be repaired effectively by using externally bonded CFRP sheets. However, when the strengthened beams {{are subjected to}} marine environment, long-term performance {{will be affected by}} the material and the interface deterioration of concrete and CFRP. Therefore, to evaluate the service life of the strengthened beams, this study investigates the behavior of precracked RC beams strengthened with CFRP sheets exposed to marine environment. Accelerated ageing experiments were carried out by exposing specimens to cyclic wetting in sea water and drying in 40 °C air <b>for</b> 3 <b>months</b> <b>and</b> 6 <b>months,</b> respectively. After the environment exposure, four-point bending test was conducted and then the diffusion of chlorides in the strengthened beams was analysed. The results show that the bonding behavior of the adhesive was weakened and the ductility of the strengthened beams was slightly reduced due to the marine environment. But there is no obvious strength difference between the strengthened beams suffered from marine environment <b>for</b> 3 <b>months</b> <b>and</b> 6 <b>months.</b> Besides, the precracks in the RC beams accelerated the chloride diffusion, while CFRP bonding reduced the chloride penetration. In addition, NEL method was employed to validate the effect of the cracks on chloride permeability. The results showed that the chloride diffusion coefficients increased with the depth of the cracks...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} was to examine agreement between routine clinician diagnoses of DSM-IV Anxiety, Depressive, Substance-Use disorders with diagnoses generated by CIDI-Auto Version 2. 1, administered by trained interviewers. Subjects were 329 deliberate self poisoning patients at a tertiary referral center in Australia. Tests of agreement were: percentage agreement, sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, positive and negative likelihood ratios, and Cohen’s kappa coefficients, <b>for</b> 1 <b>month</b> <b>and</b> 12 <b>month</b> CIDI diagnoses. Agreement was poor (kappa < 0. 40) for Anxiety, Depressive and Substance-Use disorders.

40|$|We used {{a simple}} subcranial {{procedure}} that employed nasal endoscopy to resect two anterior skull base tumors. The solid {{geometry of the}} deep frontal sinus must be known to determine the appropriateness of this technique. Since 1999 two patients underwent this technique and have exhibited no signs of local or distant disease <b>for</b> 36 <b>months</b> <b>and</b> 32 <b>months,</b> respectively. This approach minimizes visible scarring, provides a wide exposure of {{the roof of the}} anterior ethmoid, and reduces the risks of excessive bleeding and neurogenic complications. The patients recovered rapidly so the treatment was cost-effective and the patients achieved an early return to work. We conclude that the transfrontal approach for anterior skull base tumors can be simple and effective. Further studies of this minimally invasive maneuver for high-risk patients are warranted...|$|R
