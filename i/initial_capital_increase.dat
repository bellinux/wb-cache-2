Standard Markov chain methods can be applied tosolve in principle this more general problem, but the computations quickly become prohibitive {{as soon as the}} number of playersor their <b>initial</b> <b>capital</b> <b>increase.</b> For [...] and large initial capitals the solution can be well approximated by using two-dimensional Brownian motion. (For [...] this is not possible.)In practice the true problem is to find the solution for the typical cases of [...] and limited initial capital.Swan (2006) proposed an algorithm based on Matrix-analytic methods (Folding algorithm for ruin problems) which significantlyreduces the order of the computational task in such cases.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} changes in capital regulation on the strictness (leniency) of loan terms using a simple model of bank capital requirements and asset quality examinations. Banks offer different levels of "leniency" {{in the sense of}} willingness to offer automatic extensions of loans in the presence of temporary payment difficulties of borrowers. Banks offering lenient (less strict) loan terms must have higher <b>initial</b> levels of <b>capital</b> and charge higher loan rates. When <b>capital</b> requirements are <b>increased,</b> both strict and lenient banks hold higher levels of <b>initial</b> <b>capital</b> and they raise loan rates. As <b>capital</b> requirements <b>increase</b> the difference between <b>initial</b> <b>capital</b> levels and between interest rates of strict and lenient banks decrease. Thus, higher capital requirements in recessions tend to reduce the interest rate premium paid for leniency. If a recession is interpreted as an increase in the required return, the interest rate premium paid for leniency is increased in recession at a given level of required capital...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to find the optimal hedging {{strategy}} when an investor has budget constraints on both the <b>initial</b> <b>capital</b> and the future cash flow. Design/methodology/approach – The paper follows the utility minimization of the total cost, using convex utility functions on both <b>initial</b> <b>capital</b> and future cash flows. Findings – Closed-form solutions of optimal hedging strategies are found in some specific but popular cases. It is also found that this method corresponds to the local risk minimization method in quadratic hedging. Research limitations/implications – Hedging strategies are calculated for only two popular choices. One may want to calculate hedging strategies for other popular utility functions such as power utility or HARA utility. Practical implications – When a trader has some budget constraint in both <b>initial</b> <b>capital</b> and future cash flows, this paper gives a simple alternative. Originality/value – Budget constraints on both <b>initial</b> <b>capital</b> and future cash flow are new to this kind of study. Connection to the local risk minimization strategy is original too.
