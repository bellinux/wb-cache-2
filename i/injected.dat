We aimed at assessing these patterns of longitudinal changes, their predictors and their association with the incidence of HIV and HCV. We analyzed data from the Amsterdam Cohort Study among Drug Users, selecting participants recruited from 1985 to 2005, <b>injecting</b> drugs before cohort entry and with records {{in at least three}} different six months intervals (N= 740). We used latent class mixed models to identify distinct trajectories of <b>injecting,</b> multinomial regression to identify socio-demographic variables associated with those patterns and Kaplan-Meier analysis for the estimation of the corresponding cumulative HIV and HCV incidence. Five distinct patterns for <b>injecting</b> frequency and for <b>injecting</b> since last visit were identified.

Those with longer duration of <b>injecting</b> at cohort entry and those who entered the cohort in earlier years tended to have continuing high risk behavior. The HIV risk was highest among those with continuing high risk behavior and its changes over time mirrored the patterns of change in <b>injecting</b> in a group with decrease in <b>injecting.</b> Individual longitudinal patterns of changes in <b>injecting</b> behavior are related to socio-demographic and drug use variables and are reflected in the incidence of HIV infections.

40|$|Background: People who <b>inject</b> drugs (PWID) {{are at risk}} of {{hepatitis}} C virus (HCV). It is plausible that PWID who receive a diagnosis of HCV will reduce their <b>injecting</b> risk out of concern for their <b>injecting</b> partners, although evidence for this is currently limited. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate whether informing PWID of their HCV diagnosis was associated with a change in <b>injecting</b> behaviour. Methods: Prospective, longitudinal study of PWID recruited from street drug markets across Melbourne, Australia. Interviews and HCV testing were conducted at 3 -monthly intervals. The association between receiving a diagnosis of HCV and (i) <b>injecting</b> frequency and (ii) <b>injecting</b> equipment borrowing, was examined using generalized estimating equations (GEE) analysis. Results: Thirty-five individuals received a diagnosis of HCV during the study period.

40|$|Drug <b>injecting</b> {{in public}} places is {{associated}} with elevated health harm among <b>injecting</b> drug users (IDUs). Yet there is little research exploring the lived experience of <b>injecting</b> {{in public places}}, and specifically, a need to explore the interplay of public <b>injecting</b> environments, risk practices and social marginalisation. We undertook 49 qualitative interviews with IDUs in South Wales, UK, in six locations. Analyses focused on injectors' narratives of <b>injecting</b> in public places and risk identity. Findings show how the lived experience of public <b>injecting</b> feeds a pervasive sense of risk and 'otherness' among street injectors, in which public <b>injecting</b> environments act as contextual amplifiers of social marginalisation. <b>Injecting</b> in public places was characterised by urgency associated with a fear of interruption, a need to maintain privacy to prevent public exposure, and an awareness or sense of shame. We argue that daily interactions involving public exposure of <b>injecting</b> status, combined with the negative social meanings ascribed to public places used for injection, are experienced as potentially degrading to one's sense of self. We conclude that the public <b>injecting</b> environment is experienced {{in the context of}} other forms of public shaming in the lives of street injectors, and is thus productive of symbolic violence. This highlights tensions between strategies seeking to create safer communities and environmental interventions seeking to reduce drug-related health harm, including recent innovations such as the 'drug consumption room' (DCR).

40|$|To assess {{relationships}} between characteristics of methadone maintenance treatment and long-term cessation of <b>injecting</b> (> or = 1 year). The incidence of cessation of <b>injecting</b> and relapse from non-injecting to <b>injecting</b> was estimated among 488 participants of the Amsterdam cohort study among drug users. We used a nested matched case-control design to identify methadone treatment characteristics significantly and independently related to cessation of <b>injecting.</b> To ensure detailed and valid assessment of methadone treatment, {{data of the}} Central Methadone Register were linked with cohort data. For 339 of 488 subjects of the initial study group methadone data were available. The incidence of cessation of <b>injecting</b> increased from 2. 2 / 100 person years in 1985 - 89 to 5. 5 / 100 per year in 1995 - 97 (Ptrend = 0. 005). Relapse to <b>injecting</b> was high: 17. 2 / 100 person years (no trend). Methadone dosage and frequency of methadone programme attendance in themselves were not significantly related to cessation of <b>injecting.</b> However, an individual increase of 5 mg or more per year (OR 4. 20, 95 % CI 1. 54 - 11. 46) and receiving methadone mainly via the outpatient clinic for drug-abusing prostitutes and foreigners (OR 0. 18, 95 % CI 0. 05 - 0. 59) were independent predictors of cessation of <b>injecting.</b> After cessation of <b>injecting,</b> there were no HIV-seroconversions {{during the period of}} non-injecting (129 person years).

40|$|Abstract—In {{the last}} two decades, many online fault/noise {{injection}} algorithms {{have been developed to}} attain a fault tolerant neural network. However, not much theoretical works related to their convergence and objective functions have been reported. This paper studies six common fault/noise-injection-based online learning algorithms for radial basis function (RBF) networks, namely 1) <b>injecting</b> additive input noise, 2) <b>injecting</b> additive/multiplicative weight noise, 3) <b>injecting</b> multiplicative node noise, 4) <b>injecting</b> multiweight fault (random disconnection of weights), 5) <b>injecting</b> multinode fault during training, and 6) weight decay with <b>injecting</b> multinode fault. Based on the Gladyshev theorem, we show that the convergence of these six online algorithms is almost sure. Moreover, their true objective functions being minimized are derived. For <b>injecting</b> additive input noise during training, the objective function is identical to that of the Tikhonov regularizer approach. For <b>injecting</b> additive/multiplicative weight noise during training, the objective function is the simple mean square training error. Thus, <b>injecting</b> additive/multiplicative weight noise during training cannot improve the fault tolerance of an RBF network. Similar to injective additive input noise, the objective functions of other fault/noise-injection-based online algorithms contain a mean square error term and a specialized regularization term.
