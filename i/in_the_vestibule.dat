5|$|Synagogue dues were {{collected}} by the shamash (the equivalent of a sexton or beadle), who augmented his salary by working as a glazier and running a small food concession stand <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>vestibule.</b> There mourners who came to recite kaddish could purchase a piece of sponge cake and small glass of brandy for ten cents (today $0).|$|E
5|$|The 50-seat coaches {{featured}} 2x2 seating, with baggage racks <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>vestibule</b> end {{and separate}} men's and women's restrooms in the other. The dining-cocktail lounge had half its space {{devoted to a}} kitchen and bar area; two seating areas in the other end seated 12 and 24, respectively. Two of the sleeping cars contained 12 open sections, with daytime seating for 24; the third contained eight enclosed sections, two double bedrooms, and a compartment, giving the car a maximum occupancy of 22. The sleeper-lounge-observation car included a compartment, five more double bedrooms, and a rear observation area which seated 22. The cars were air-conditioned throughout.|$|E
5|$|Located on Southwest Washington Street between Third and Fourth avenues in {{downtown}} Hillsboro, {{the station is}} decorated with dark red bricks. Overhead is a steep-pitched roof, with the station's floor <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>vestibule</b> built of concrete planks in homage to the cedar-planked roads that formerly existed in the town. Designed by the architectural firm OTAK Inc., the station is {{the largest of the}} MAX stations on the westside line as it extends most of the length of the block between Third and Fourth avenues. Hillsboro Central sits on the same site of the old Oregon Electric Railway station for the Hillsboro area and has a station building that is designed to look like an old railroad station with features similar to those at a Grand Central Station type of facility.|$|E
25|$|The {{interior}} has 49 rooms, {{including a}} large oak-paneled hall designed for large parties, an oval dining room done in mahogany, a lobby done in English oak, {{and a white}} and gold music room.

5|$|The three Nasser brothers, William, Elias and George, {{specifically}} requested Pflueger in 1920 {{after they}} received financing {{for a grand}} movie palace on Castro Street. In a hurry to see the 2,000-seat project completed, the Nasser Brothers gave Pflueger a free hand in its design. The Castro Theatre was finished in June 1922 for $300,000 ($ in today's dollars) in a largely Spanish Baroque style which evoked cathedrals in Spain and Mexico. Churrigueresque elements were used sparingly on the facade, and ornate tile detailing was employed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>vestibule,</b> ticket booth and the lobby. A canopy modeled after ancient Roman silk brocade shelters was fashioned of steel lath and plaster and painted with Asian and Buddha figures to overhang the main theater seating area. The whole was an eclectic assemblage of styles.|$|E

50|$|The M8s {{have new}} roomier, high-back seats with {{individual}} headrests and curved arm rests for more comfort. For improved safety, especially <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>vestibules,</b> <b>the</b> car have larger windows and better lighting. An additional safety {{feature is the}} installation of intercom systems that customers can use to contact <b>the</b> train crew <b>in</b> case of emergency. Other features included curved luggage racks, coat hooks, electrical outlets to charge personal devices, and LED displays that show that next stop and automated announcements. The cars also have external public address speakers, and electronic destination signs. Higher reliability is possible with single leaf doors, which also lessen the susceptibility to snow intrusion. Also, the M8s have sealed alternating current motors that are less susceptible to weather.|$|R
25|$|The {{building}} is {{constructed in the}} Greek Revival style with exterior walls of sandstone. The interior consists of two rooms, a vestibule and the main room. The structure underwent a series of changes during the 1940s including the enclosure of two alcoves <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>vestibule.</b> Plano Stone Church {{was added to the}} U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 1990.|$|E
25|$|The main {{store for}} bed linen on the Plymouth service was at Old Oak Common depot near London Paddington. Used bedding from Plymouth was {{previously}} transported in the guards van of the Plymouth portion, but in 1977 that vehicle {{was removed from}} the formation. Instead, the dirty linen was stacked in plastic bags <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>vestibule</b> of W2437, against the heater.|$|E
25|$|Each saloon had 64 seats, {{arranged}} in eight bays of four around a table, {{either side of}} a central gangway, with two toilets situated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>vestibule</b> at one end. The interior was finished in laminated plastics, creating a light and airy feel. They were fitted with a public address system, double-glazed windows and central fluorescent lighting along their length, the first coaches in Ireland to be so treated. Heating was by steam, supplied from a Steam Heating Van.|$|E
30|$|Antiallergic {{activity}} of aerial parts extract of A. ilicifolius L. was assessed on adult male Swiss albino mice according to procedures of Dev et al. with minor modifications [61 – 63]. After acclimatization {{with the standard}} housing conditions of the animal house, fifty adult Swiss albino male mice were randomly selected and divided into five groups (10 in each group) denoted as group-I, group-II, group-III, group-IV and group-V. Group-I (Control) received ethyl acetate (10 [*]μL) bilaterally <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nasal <b>vestibules</b> and 2 % aqueous solution of tween- 80 water orally. Group-II served as TDI control and received TDI (10 [*]μL of 5 % TDI in ethyl acetate) bilaterally <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nasal <b>vestibules</b> and 2 % tween- 80 water equivalent to the vehicle given with the extract orally. Group-III served as standard group and was given TDI (10 [*]μL of 5 % TDI solution in ethyl acetate) bilaterally <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nasal <b>vestibules</b> and an antihistamine drug, cetirizine, at a dose of 20 [*]mg/kg body weight orally. Group-IV and group-V received ethanolic extract of A. ilicifolius (300 [*]mg/kg and 500 [*]mg/kg body weight respectively) orally and TDI (10 [*]μL of 5 % TDI solution in ethyl acetate) bilaterally <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nasal <b>vestibules.</b>|$|R

25|$|Mural painting, {{taught in}} church schools, also flourished, {{evolving}} {{over the centuries}} from the Byzantine-style symbolic works of the 14th century to more realistic depictions, especially <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 18th. While paintings in church naves remained in harmony with canon law, artists adopted realistic forms <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>vestibules,</b> where <b>the</b> ktitori were depicted. Starting <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 18th century, <b>the</b> painters, trained <b>in</b> different locations but living in Râmnic, organized themselves into a guild to defend themselves against administrative abuses. At the same time, Bishop Filaret asked them to remain mindful of the church canons.|$|R
25|$|Squamous lesions tend {{to arise}} {{in a single}} site and occur most {{commonly}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>vestibule.</b> They grow by local extension and spread via the local lymph system. The lymphatics of the labia drain to the upper vulva and mons, then to both superficial and deep inguinal and femoral lymph nodes. The last deep femoral node is called the Cloquet’s node. Spread beyond this node reaches the lymph nodes of the pelvis. The tumor may also invade nearby organs such as the vagina, urethra, and rectum and spread via their lymphatics.|$|E
25|$|The {{fire started}} in a British Railways Mark 1 {{sleeping}} car (no. W2437) {{which was built}} in 1960, at which time trains in the UK were mostly hauled by steam locomotives, which provided steam for heating passenger accommodation. Diesel locomotives of the period were fitted with boilers {{so that they could}} be used with existing coaches. However, with steam locomotives gone by the 1970s, and with boilers proving unreliable and expensive to maintain, {{the decision was made to}} change to electric train heating (ETH). W2437 was converted in 1976, with an electric heater being installed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>vestibule.</b>|$|E
25|$|Around the 1930s, Art Deco-azulejos {{made their}} {{appearance}} with their principal artist António Costa. The monumental decorations, consisting of 20,000 azulejos, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>vestibule</b> of the São Bento railway station in Porto, created by Jorge Colaço, show in its historical themes the narrative {{style of the}} romantic 'picture-postcard'. This {{one of the most}} notable creations with azulejos of the 20th century. The façades of the churches of Santo Ildefonso and Congregados equally attest to the artistic mastery of Jorge Colaço. Other artists from this period include Mário Branco and Silvestre Silvestri, who decorated in 1912 the lateral façade of the Carmo Church, and Eduardo Leite for his work on the Almas Chapel (imitating the style of the 18th century), both in Porto.|$|E
50|$|Dinamo (Дина́мо) is a Moscow Metro {{station on}} the Zamoskvoretskaya Line. It is located under Leningradsky Avenue, and named after the nearby Dinamo Stadium. The station was opened in 1938 {{as part of the}} second stage of the system. The station is {{situated}} at the depth of 39.6 metres (130 ft) and follows a tri-vaulted deep-level pylon design. Designed by Ya. Likhtenberg and Yury Revkovsky, the station features a sport-themed decoration with bas-reliefs designed by Ye.

25|$|Sala da Ceia (Supper Room), {{the grand}} dining hall for state dinners and {{ceremonial}} events (such as the acclamation of Miguel as King and {{the wedding of}} Carlos and Amelia of Orleans), the room is a long hall that includes two long tables for visitors and the main table (which intersects the other two) for the Royal Family. The ceiling is painted with an allegorical depiction {{as a tribute to}} John VI, depicting a sun chariot with Apollo, encircled by the Horae, months, seasons, and other allegorical figures, illuminated by three large bronze crystal chandeliers, and an upper gallery for musicians, who would play for visiting guests and diplomats. The opposite wing was altered by the adaption by actual activities in the space, and includes a staircase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>vestibule</b> to connect the upper spaces and rooms.|$|E
500|$|The {{excavations}} revealed 49stone coffins, 30coffin lids, {{and five}} headstones. Twelve of the lids were carved in high relief, with designs including flowers or foliage. One lid depicts {{an oak tree}} issuing from a human head {{in the style of}} a green man, another has a cross, a dragon and a female effigy, while others have shield and sword motifs. Two contain inscriptions in Norman-French, identifying the deceased. The remaining lids have simpler incised patterns, mainly decorated crosses. The headstones contain crosses. Most of the coffins were sunk into the ground, with the lid {{at the level of the}} floor, although a few were found within the walls. Only three stone coffins for children were discovered. These lay in a group, together with a coffin containing a male skeleton, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>vestibule</b> leading to the enlarged chapter house. The most prestigious type of coffin was tapered towards the feet, with the head end carved externally to a hemi-hexagonal shape. Another sign of higher status was the provision of an internal [...] "pillow" [...] for the head.|$|E

Statues of two young angels, and of four male figures from the Old Testament (Moses, Joshua, Elia and probably Gideon) are on the west end of {{the courtyard}}. The original figures from the 17th century were Baroque in character, while the reconstructions from the 1950s are made in a cleaner, tighter style.|$|E
2500|$|The Colossus of Nero (Colossus Neronis) was a [...] bronze statue {{that the}} Emperor Nero (37–68 AD) created <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>vestibule</b> of his Domus Aurea, the {{imperial}} villa complex which spanned {{a large area}} from {{the north side of}} the Palatine Hill, across the Velian ridge to the Esquiline Hill. It was modified by Nero's successors into a statue of the sun god Sol. It is last mentioned in the 4th century AD. The statue was eventually moved to a spot outside the Flavian Amphitheatre, which (according to one of the more popular theories) became known, by its proximity to the Colossus, as the Colosseum.|$|E
2500|$|The idea to {{construct}} a Masonic memorial for George Washington was first proposed in 1852 by the Washington area's [...] "mother lodge," [...] Fredericksburg Lodge No. 4 (located in Fredericksburg, Virginia). Funds were sought from Grand Lodges (state-level Masonic organizations) throughout the United States {{to construct}} a memorial Masonic Temple with a large statue <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>vestibule.</b> Enough funds were raised to commission a life-size bronze statue of Washington in full Masonic regalia from a sculptor named Powers who was living in Rome, Italy. The statue reached Alexandria in early 1861, just before {{the outbreak of the}} American Civil War. It remained on display in Alexandria until the summer of 1863, when it was moved to Richmond, Virginia. The statue was destroyed in the fire which occurred as Richmond surrendered to the Army of the Potomac on April 3, 1865.|$|E
25|$|Access to {{the first}} floor {{mezzanine}} was directly from landings of <b>the</b> two staircases <b>in</b> <b>the</b> west end of the building. A foyer, corresponding <b>in</b> size to <b>the</b> <b>vestibule</b> below, connected <b>the</b> two stairway landings.|$|R

40|$|AbstractAnalytical {{solutions}} of Poisson's equations {{satisfying the}} Dirichlet boundary {{conditions for a}} toroidal dielectric boundary are presented. The electric potential computed anywhere <b>in</b> <b>the</b> toroidal conduit by the analytical method agrees with the value derived from an iterative numerical method. We show that three different channel geometries, namely, bicone, catenary, and toroid, give similar potential profiles as an ion traverses along their central axis. We then {{examine the effects of}} dipoles <b>in</b> <b>the</b> toroidal channel wall on the potential profile of ions passing through the channel. The presence of dipoles eliminates the barrier for one polarity of ion, while raising the barrier for ions of the opposite polarity. We also examine how a uniform electric field from an external source is affected by the protein boundary and a mobile charge. The channel distorts the field, reducing it <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>vestibules,</b> and enhancing it <b>in</b> <b>the</b> constricted segment. The presence of an ion in one vestibule effectively excludes ions of the same polarity from that vestibule, but has little effect <b>in</b> <b>the</b> other <b>vestibule.</b> Finally, we discuss how the solutions we provide here may be utilized to simulate a system containing a channel and many interacting ions...|$|R
