500|$|The Buckeye male weighs {{an average}} of , and the hen [...] The breed has yellow skin and lays brown eggs. Its primary color is a {{mahogany}} red with black tails; sometimes males have other dark feathering. According to the breed standard, a Buckeye's plumage should ideally resemble the hue of an Ohio Buckeye's seeds. Especially in the <b>hen,</b> <b>the</b> breed is very similar in appearance to the Rhode Island Red. The Buckeye can be differentiated by a bar of slate color on the back feathers close to the body; the body is also much more compact, with a short yet broad back.|$|E
500|$|Another stanza {{appears to}} be part of the {{separate}} cycle of poems associated with Llywarch <b>Hen.</b> <b>The</b> third interpolation is a poem entitled [...] "Dinogad's Smock", a cradle-song addressed to a baby named Dinogad, describing how his father goes hunting and fishing. The interpolations are thought to have been added to the poem after it had been written down, these stanzas first being written down where there was a space in the manuscript, then being incorporated in the poem by a later copier who failed to realise that they did not belong. The Strathcarron stanza, for example, is the first stanza in the B text of the Book of Aneirin, and Jackson suggested that it had probably been inserted on a blank space at the top of the first page of the original manuscript. According to Koch's reconstruction, this stanza was deliberately added to the text in Strathclyde.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{problems}} in free range husbandry of laying <b>hens</b> is <b>the</b> uneven use of <b>the</b> <b>hen</b> run.

Results, conclusion, state of the art: Especially the middle part of <b>the</b> <b>hen</b> run was used more often. However the nearest part to <b>the</b> <b>hen</b> house will always be frequently used as <b>the</b> <b>hens</b> have to pass it to reach the distant parts of <b>the</b> <b>hen</b> run.

She now proposed to Aaron that this duty should devolve on Tommy, and for the service she would pay his fees at the Hanky School.|$|E

60|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{secondary}} sexual characters which {{belong to the}} species {{in a state of}} nature are sometimes quite lost, or greatly diminished, under domestication. We see this in the small size of the tusks in our improved breeds of the pig, in comparison with those of the wild boar. There are sub- breeds of fowls, in which the males have lost the fine-flowing tail-feathers and hackles; and others {{in which there is no}} difference in colour between the two sexes. In some cases the barred plumage, which in gallinaceous birds is commonly the attribute of the hen, has been transferred to the cock, as in the cuckoo sub-breeds. In other cases masculine characters have been partly transferred to the female, as with the splendid plumage of the golden-spangled Hamburgh <b>hen,</b> <b>the</b> enlarged comb of the Spanish <b>hen,</b> <b>the</b> pugnacious disposition of the Game hen, and as in the well-developed spurs which occasionally appear in the hens of various breeds. In Polish fowls both sexes are ornamented with a topknot, that of the male being formed of hackle-like feathers, and this is a new male character in the genus Gallus. On the whole, as far as I can judge, new characters are more apt to appear in the males of our domesticated animals than in the females (14/29. I have given in my 'Descent of Man' 2nd edition page 223 sufficient evidence that male animals are usually more variable than the females.), and afterwards to be inherited exclusively or more strongly by the males. Finally, in accordance with the principle of inheritance as limited by sex, the preservation and augmentation of secondary sexual characters in natural species offers no especial difficulty, as this would follow through that form of selection which I have called sexual selection.|$|E
60|$|And now {{the mild}} autumn sun got lower, {{and in front}} of the {{pavilion}} the following incident had taken place. Bathsheba--who was driven to the fair that day by her odd man Poorgrass--had, like every one else, read or heard the announcement that Mr. Francis, the Great Cosmopolitan Equestrian and Roughrider, would enact the part of Turpin, and she was not yet too old and careworn to be without a little curiosity to see him. This particular show was by far the largest and grandest in the fair, a horde of little shows grouping themselves under its shade like chickens around a <b>hen.</b> <b>The</b> crowd had passed in, and Boldwood, who had been watching all the day for an opportunity of speaking to her, seeing her comparatively isolated, came up to her side.|$|E
6000|$|But {{for such}} {{advanced}} career a more capable being was needed. No {{one of us}} was sufficient, he argued, to be granted a future existence all to himself. His idea was that two or three or four of us, according to our intrinsic value, would be combined to make a new and more important individuality, fitted for a higher existence. Man, he pointed out, was already a collection of the beasts. [...] "You and I," [...] he would say, tapping first my chest and then his own, [...] "we have them all here--the ape, the tiger, the pig, the motherly <b>hen,</b> <b>the</b> gamecock, the good ant; we are all, rolled into one.
