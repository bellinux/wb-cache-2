5|$|The German vessels {{were largely}} {{undamaged}} but the French lost their gunboat. Several of Papeete's buildings were destroyed and the town's economy was severely disrupted. The main strategic {{consequence of the}} engagement was the <b>disclosure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cruisers' positions to the British Admiralty, {{which led to the}} Battle of Coronel where the entire German East Asia Squadron defeated a Royal Navy squadron. The depletion of Scharnhorsts and Gneisenaus ammunition at Papeete also contributed to their subsequent destruction at the Battle of the Falklands.|$|E

5|$|The Privy Council {{identified}} one of {{the extreme}} circumstances as that which occurred in Wright & Advertiser Newspapers Limited v. Lewis (1990). In this case, the Supreme Court of South Australia held that an action may proceed against a legislator accused of libel where the whole {{subject matter of the}} alleged libel relates to the legislator's conduct in the legislature so that the effect of parliamentary privilege is to exclude virtually all the evidence necessary to justify the libel. If such an action is not allowed to proceed, not only will there be injustice to the defendant, but there will also be a real danger that the media will be forced to abstain from the truthful <b>disclosure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> legislator's misbehaviour in Parliament. This would be a most serious inroad into freedom of speech since justification would be impossible.|$|E
