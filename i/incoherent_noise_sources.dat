40|$|The {{present study}} reports a new {{development}} of the DAMAS microphone phased array processing methodology that allows the determination and separation of coherent and <b>incoherent</b> <b>noise</b> <b>source</b> distributions. In 2004, a Deconvolution Approach for the Mapping of Acoustic Sources (DAMAS) was developed which decoupled the array design and processing influence from the noise being measured, using a simple and robust algorithm. In 2005, three-dimensional applications of DAMAS were examined. DAMAS {{has been shown to}} render an unambiguous quantitative determination of acoustic source position and strength. However, an underlying premise of DAMAS, {{as well as that of}} classical array beamforming methodology, is that the noise regions under study are distributions of statistically independent sources. The present development, called DAMAS-C, extends the basic approach to include coherence definition between <b>noise</b> <b>sources.</b> The solutions incorporate cross-beamforming array measurements over the survey region. While the resulting inverse problem can be large and the iteration solution computationally demanding, it solves problems no other technique can approach. DAMAS-C is validated using <b>noise</b> <b>source</b> simulations and is applied to airframe flap noise test results. SYMBOLS am shear layer refraction amplitude correction for em...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{study the}} {{detection}} of very weak time-periodic magnetic signals via a double-junction (dc) Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID). The device, represented by two coupled nonlinear differential equations for the quantum mechanical junction phases, admits of long-time static or oscillatory solutions, the transition being controllable by experimental parameters.

40|$|Abstract—Signals {{captured}} {{by a set}} of microphones in a speech communication system are mixtures of desired signals and noise. In this paper, a different perspective on frequency-domain beam-formers in room acoustics is provided. Specifically, the observed noise signals are divided into coherent and incoherent signal components while no assumptions are being made regarding the number of coherent <b>noise</b> <b>sources</b> and the <b>noise</b> sound field. From this perspective, performance measures are defined and existing beamformers are deduced. In addition, a new and general tradeoff beamformer is proposed that enables a compromise between noise reduction and speech distortion on the one hand, and coherent <b>noise</b> versus <b>incoherent</b> <b>noise</b> reductions on the other hand. The presented performance evaluation shows how existing beamformers and the tradeoff beamformer perform in different scenarios.

This thesis presents a detailed investigation into the <b>noise</b> <b>sources</b> that degrade the contrast of high-power laser pulses created for laser-matter interaction experiments. To achieve this, a high-contrast multi-terawatt peak-power laser system, named Cerberus, has been developed to deliver up to 5 J, 500 fs pulses (10 TW) using an optical parametric chirped pulse amplification (OPCPA) front-end and Nd:Glass laser rod power amplifiers.

Parametric fluorescence noise from parametric amplifiers was measured with a diagnostic able to observe the real-time seeded OPCPA fluorescence noise emission and determined the fluorescence emission to be directly linked to the level of pump-depletion, with a 500 times contrast enhancement from the undepleted to maximum pump depletion modes of operation. A combination of picosecond-pumped OPCPA and nanosecond-pumped OPCPA amplifiers effectively suppresses the longer timescale parametric fluorescence to > 10 ^ 8 - 10 ^ 10 contrast. A scanning third-order autocorrelator diagnostic (TOAD) was developed to characterise the compressed pulses emitted from a range of mode-locked laser oscillator sources and the compressed high-power laser pulses from major laser laboratories in the UK.

40|$|Quantum {{computation}} {{requires the}} ability to efficiently control quantum information {{in the presence of}} noise. In this thesis, NMR quantum information processors (QIPs) are used to study noise processes that compromise coherent control, to develop useful techniques for detecting noise, and to explore effective noise-protection schemes. A quantum simulation of the quantum sawtooth map in the perturbative parameter regime is used to study the effects of experimental noise on quantum localization, a highly sensitive quantum interference phenomenon that depends on the coherence of the localized state. Experimental data and numerical simulations show that the decoherent noise known to act on the system is relatively inconsequential in this implementation of the map, and that <b>incoherent</b> <b>noise</b> is the biggest challenge to implementing localization. While many incoherent processes appear decoherent, there are important differences. The distribution functions underlying incoherent processes are either static or slowly varying and so the errors introduced by these distributions are refocusable. The influence of <b>incoherent</b> <b>noise</b> is further explored in an experimentally implemented entangling operation, where incoherence can be difficult to separate from decoherence. By studying the fidelity decay under the cyclic entangling map, the effects of incoherence are easily distinguished from decoherence in experimental data. Decoherence free subspaces (DFSs) provide some of the most efficient schemes of avoiding decoherence from <b>noise</b> <b>sources</b> with underlying symmetries. (cont.) To achieve an internal Hamiltonian structure that naturally fits a DFS encoding over a well-defined Hilbert space, we employ liquid crystal solvents to partially align a four-proton spin system, reintroducing the spin-spin dipolar couplings. In these experiments, enhanced coherent control is achieved by encoding logical qubits in a DFS. Robust control sequences enable high fidelity control in the DFS even when the system Hamiltonian is known with some uncertainty. by Michael Kevin Henry, Jr. Thesis (Ph. D.)
