5|$|On 10 January 1994 a press {{reception}} {{to announce}} The Division Bell and world tour {{was held at}} a former US Naval Air Station in North Carolina, in the US. A purpose-built Skyship 600 airship, manufactured in the UK, toured the US until it returned to Weeksville, and was destroyed by a thunderstorm on 27 June. Pieces of the aircraft were sold as souvenirs. The band held another reception, in the UK, on 21 March. This time they used an A60 airship, translucent, and painted {{to look like a}} fish, which took journalists on a tour of London. The airship, which was lit internally so it <b>glowed</b> <b>in</b> the night sky, was also flown in northern Europe.|$|E
25|$|The {{discovery}} of phosphorus, the first element {{to be discovered}} that was not known since ancient times, is credited to the German alchemist Hennig Brand in 1669, although other chemists might have discovered phosphorus around the same time. Brand experimented with urine, which contains considerable quantities of dissolved phosphates from normal metabolism. Working in Hamburg, Brand attempted to create the fabled philosopher's stone through the distillation of some salts by evaporating urine, {{and in the process}} produced a white material that <b>glowed</b> <b>in</b> the dark and burned brilliantly. It was named phosphorus mirabilis ("miraculous bearer of light").|$|E
25|$|Roderick later {{informs the}} narrator that his sister has died and insists {{that she be}} entombed for {{two weeks in the}} family tomb located in the house before being {{permanently}} buried. The narrator helps Roderick put the body in the tomb, and he notes that Madeline has rosy cheeks, as some do after death. They inter her, but over the next week both Roderick and the narrator find themselves becoming increasingly agitated for no apparent reason. A storm begins. Roderick comes to the narrator's bedroom, which is situated directly above the vault, and throws open his window to the storm. He notices that the tarn surrounding the house seems to glow in the dark, as it <b>glowed</b> <b>in</b> Roderick Usher's paintings, although there is no lightning.|$|E
50|$|Both blacklight and <b>glow</b> <b>in</b> {{the dark}} inks {{have been used}} for tattooing. <b>Glow</b> <b>in</b> the dark ink absorbs and retains light, and then <b>glows</b> <b>in</b> darkened {{conditions}} by process of phosphorescence. Blacklight ink does not <b>glow</b> <b>in</b> the dark, but reacts to non-visible UV light, producing a visible glow by fluorescence. The resulting glow of both these inks is highly variable.|$|R

500|$|He {{then set}} out for Bennington, where news of his {{impending}} return preceded him, and he was met {{with all of the}} honor due a military war hero. There he learned that the Vermont Republic had declared independence in 1777, that a constitution had been drawn up, and that elections had been held. Allen wrote of this homecoming that [...] "we passed the flowing bowl, and rural felicity, sweetened with friendship, <b>glowed</b> <b>in</b> every countenance". The next day he went to Arlington to see his family and his brother Ira, whose prominence in Vermont politics had risen considerably during Allen's captivity.|$|E

2500|$|Brand's process {{originally}} involved letting urine {{stand for}} days until it {{gave off a}} terrible smell. Then he boiled {{it down to a}} paste, heated this paste to a high temperature, and led the vapours through water, where he hoped they would condense to gold. Instead, he obtained a white, waxy substance that <b>glowed</b> <b>in</b> the dark. Brand had discovered phosphorus. We now know that Brand produced ammonium sodium hydrogen phosphate, [...] While the quantities were essentially correct (it took about [...] of urine to make about 60g of phosphorus), it was unnecessary to allow the urine to rot. Later scientists discovered that fresh urine yielded the same amount of phosphorus.|$|E
