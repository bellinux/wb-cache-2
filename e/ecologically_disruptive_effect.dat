40|$|Organization theory {{suggests}} that structural change has <b>disruptive</b> <b>effects</b> on managerial behaviour and organizational outcomes, and that these effects are likely {{to emerge in the}} period between the announcement and the commencement of the new structure. We evaluate the validity of this argument by analysing the performance of English county councils in the transition period before the voluntary restructuring of a sub-set of these organizations. <b>Disruptive</b> <b>effects</b> are tested while controlling for a range of other variables, including the relative prosperity of the local population and the diversity of their service needs. The empirical results indicate that the performance of local authorities facing reorganization deteriorated prior to the onset of the new structures, and support the view that structural change has <b>disruptive</b> <b>effects</b> on organizational outcomes...|$|R
40|$|This study {{sought to}} {{identify}} the <b>disruptive</b> <b>effect</b> of proceeds of crime action on criminal activity, and to identify factors associated with successful proceeds of crime action. Executive summary Illicit drug trafficking {{is a source of}} funds for further trafficking and for supporting the lifestyles of criminals. Drug trafficking has been closely linked with organised crime and with social harms. This project had two main aims: • To identify the <b>disruptive</b> <b>effect</b> of proceeds of crime action on criminal activity. The project attempted to measure the <b>disruptive</b> <b>effect</b> by developing an economic model that estimated the multiplier impact of the reinvestment of the profits of drug trafficking. • The project also attempted to identify factors associated with successful proceeds of crime action. There are two main audiences for the findings of this study. Senior police, police intelligence, policymakers and researchers will be interested primarily in measuring the <b>disruptive</b> <b>effect</b> of proceeds of crime action. Police responsible for managing proceeds of crime investigations and senior investigators will be interested in the practical applications of findings relating to success factors in financial investigations. The results of the project should improve agencies’ ability to target trafficking and increase the seizure of proceeds of crime. The proposed index of the <b>disruptive</b> <b>effect</b> of proceeds of crime action—the Proceeds of Crime Drug Disruption Index (POCDDI) —will also allow agencies to provide both the Government and the community with a more accurate assessment of the value of their proceeds of crime initiatives...|$|R

40|$|Research {{has shown}} that {{different}} types of interruptions can affect their disruptiveness. However, {{it is unclear how}} different features of the interrupting task determine its <b>disruptive</b> <b>effects.</b> Specifically, some theories predict that the difficulty of an interruption does not contribute to the <b>disruptive</b> <b>effects</b> of that interruption alone. <b>Disruptive</b> <b>effects</b> can be mediated by {{the extent to which the}} interrupting task interferes with the ability to rehearse during the interruption. In this experiment participants performed a single primary task with three interruptions of different difficulty. We found that interruptions were more disruptive when the task minimized the participant’s ability to rehearse (as measured by the number of mental operators required to perform the task) and not just when they were more difficult. These results suggest that the ability to rehearse during an interruption is critical in facilitating resumption of a primary task...|$|R

40|$|As users {{continue}} offloading {{more control}} and {{responsibility to the}} computer, coordinating the asynchronous interactions between the user and computer is becoming increasingly important. Without proper coordination, an application attempting to gain the user’s attention risks interrupting the user {{in the midst of}} performing another task. To justify why an application should avoid interrupting the user whenever possible, we designed an experiment measuring the <b>disruptive</b> <b>effect</b> of an interruption on a user’s task performance. The experiment utilized six web-based task categories and two categories of interruption tasks. The results of the experiment demonstrate that (i) a user performs slower on an interrupted task than a non-interrupted task, (ii) the <b>disruptive</b> <b>effect</b> of an interruption differs as a function of task category, and (iii) different interruption tasks cause similar <b>disruptive</b> <b>effects</b> on task performance. These results empirically validate the need to better coordinate user interactions among applications that are competing for the user’s attention. 1...|$|R

The <b>disruptive</b> <b>effects</b> of crossover can be quantified by counting the destruction of subgraphs that represent strong linkages between genes.

40|$|The <b>disruptive</b> <b>effect</b> of {{food and}} food {{components}} on the migrating myoelectric complex (MMC) was studied in conscious dogs. Three types of test meals were fed, and the interval between feeding and the reappearance of the first phase III of the MMC was determined. When commercial dog food was used a linear relation was observed btween the quantity of food (expressed as kcal/kg body wt) and {{the duration of the}} disruption of the MMC. Equicaloric amounts of the three major food components disrupted the MMC pattern for periods of time that were related {{to the nature of the}} food: the effect of arachis oil lasted longer than that of sucrose and much longer than that of milk protein. Medium chain triglycerides had a potent <b>disruptive</b> <b>effect.</b> Mixtures of these food components produced a <b>disruptive</b> <b>effect</b> that could not be calculated from the individual effect of each component. Phase III of the first and second MMC after feeding started at a lower level of the intestine than after a long fast.

40|$|This thesis {{considers}} {{the importance of}} the inferior parietal lobe for calculation and Arabic number comparison. The first experiment demonstrates that repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) can be used on normal subjects to replicate findings from studies of patients whose ability to calculate after brain injury was impaired. While subjects were solving addition tasks, rTMS was applied over anterior and posterior areas of the inferior parietal lobule and the adjoining intraparietal sulcus (aIPL+S, pIPL+S). In line with results from patient studies, magnetic stimulation showed a <b>disruptive</b> <b>effect</b> only over left IPL+S. It had no <b>disruptive</b> <b>effect</b> when delivered over right inferior parietal lobule and the adjoining intraparietal sulcus. To investigate the representation of number magnitude in the human brain rTMS was subsequently applied to the same inferior parietal regions while subjects performed a number comparison task. With numbers between 31 and 99, repetitive TMS over the pIPL+S disrupted organisation of the putative "number line". rTMS had no <b>disruptive</b> <b>effect</b> when delivered over aIPL+S, in either the left or right hemisphere. With numbers between 1 and 9, however, TMS over the pIPL+S did not impair task performance. Here, TMS had a <b>disruptive</b> <b>effect</b> when delivered over aIPL+S, in either the left or right hemisphere, thus suggesting that areas in the inferior parietal lobes might be specialised for certain number sizes. The idea of a spatial mental number line was further investigated in a detailed single-case description of a person with an automatic mental number line. In the last experiment, functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) was used to investigate number comparison. The fMRI study gave some indication that small numbers might be represented in the aIPL+S region. In general, the fMRI results suggest that parietal cortical contribution to number magnitude representation is intimately related to its role in basic sensorimotor processes. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{consequences}} of interrupting {{someone in the}} middle of a complex task are of considerable practical and theoretical interest. We examine one behavioral measure of the disruption caused by task interruption, namely the resumption lag, or the time needed to "collect one's thoughts" and restart a task after an interruption is over. The resumption lag (in our task environment) was double the interval between uninterrupted actions (3. 8 s vs. 1. 9 s), indicating a substantial <b>disruptive</b> <b>effect.</b> To probe the nature of the disruption, we examined the role of external cues associated with the interrupted task, finding that cues available immediately before an interruption facilitate performance immediately afterwards (reducing the resumption lag). This cueavailability effect suggests that people deploy preparatory perceptual and memory processes, apparently spontaneously, to mitigate the <b>disruptive</b> <b>effects</b> of task interruption...|$|R

40|$|The {{breakdown}} voltage {{level of a}} dielectric system under a transient voltage of a given waveshape is not a constant parameter. When transient voltages of the same waveshape but of increasing amplitude are applied to a dielectric system, the dielectric breaks down at higher voltage levels at shorter time delays for the higher applied voltages. This characteristic, known as the volt-time or time-lag characteristic, significantly influences the insulation coordination of an electric power system.
