25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the school year 1918–19, Slovakia had 3,642 elementary schools. Only 141 schools taught in the Slovak language, 186 in Slovak and Hungarian and 3,298 in Hungarian. This large deformation was a direct result of previous magyarization activities of the Hungarian government. After system reform, Czechoslovakia provided an <b>educational</b> <b>network</b> for the Hungarian minority which was several times larger than the Kingdom of Hungary had for the whole Slovak nation before 1918. Due to the lack of qualified personnel among Slovaks – a lack of schools above elementary level, banned grammar schools and no Slovak teacher institutes – Hungarian teachers were replaced in large numbers by Czechs. Some Hungarian teachers resolved their existential question by moving to Hungary. According to government regulation from 28 August 1919, Hungarian teachers were permitted to teach only if they took an oath of allegiance to Czechoslovakia.|$|E
30|$|The {{versatility}} of <b>educational</b> <b>networks</b> allows various teaching-learning {{methods to}} be combined in a single study space.

Finally, the meaning of <b>educational</b> <b>networks</b> is linked to the pedagogical project into which each experience falls. Technology in itself does not innovate; rather, it is the social appropriation of technology — educational in this instance — that leads to change.|$|R

25|$|By 1862, Dr. Allatini led {{his brother}} Solomon Fernandez to found an Italian school, {{thanks to a}} {{donation}} by the Kingdom of Italy. French attempts to introduce the <b>educational</b> <b>network</b> of the Alliance Israélite Universelle (IAU) failed against resistance by the rabbis, {{who did not want}} a Jewish school under the patronage of the French embassy. But the need for schools was so urgent that supporters were finally successful in 1874. Allatini {{became a member of the}} central committee of the IAU in Paris and its patron in Thessaloniki. In 1912, nine new IAU schools IAU served the education of both boys and girls from kindergarten to high school; at the same time, the rabbinical seminaries were in decline. As a result, the French language became more widely used within the Jewish community of Salonica. These schools had instruction in both manual and intellectual training. They produced a generation familiar with the developments of the modern world, and able to enter the workforce of a company in the process of industrialization.|$|E
25|$|Kalmanowitz worked onsite to {{strengthen}} traditional Torah education among North African Jewish youth. Together {{with the leaders}} of Jewish communities in Morocco and Tunisia, he helped found the Otzar HaTorah <b>educational</b> <b>network,</b> which established 28 yeshivas and 20 Talmud Torahs, as well as girls schools, in those countries in 1947 and 1948. Kalmanowitz also devised and pushed through a plan granting student visas to the Mir yeshiva in Brooklyn for North African Jewish teens and opened special sections in the yeshiva for them, even though the yeshiva's financial situation was dire. A group of 13 boys arrived from Morocco in 1948, but most left the yeshivah to find jobs. One of those who remained was Avraham Portal, a native of Marrakech, who returned to Morocco in 1953 so he could apply for permanent residency status in the United States and in the meantime became the educational supervisor for the Otzar HaTorah network in the French region of Morocco. Portal returned to the Mir in 1956 with a hand-picked group of 15 boys and taught them in a separate program that became the Mir's first high school class. Another beneficiary of Kalmanowitz's largesse was Rabbi David Rebibo, a Moroccan-born student in France who used the student visa Kalmanowitz sent him to come study at the Mir in 1953. Afterwards Kalmanowitz helped Rebibo find his first teaching job. Rebibo has been dean of the Phoenix Hebrew Academy and senior rabbi of Beth Jacob Congregation in Phoenix, Arizona since 1965.|$|E
2500|$|India {{established}} a dense <b>educational</b> <b>network</b> (very largely for males) with a Western curriculum based on instruction in English. To further advance their careers many ambitious upper class men with money, including Gandhi, Nehru and Muhammad Ali Jinnah went to England, especially {{to obtain a}} legal education at the Inns of Court. [...] By 1890 some 60,000 Indians had matriculated, chiefly in the liberal arts or law. About a third entered public administration, and another third became lawyers. The result was a very well educated professional state bureaucracy. By 1887 of 21,000 mid-level civil service appointments, 45% were held by Hindus, 7% by Muslims, 19% by Eurasians (European father and Indian mother), and 29% by Europeans. Of the 1000 top -level positions, almost all were held by Britons, typically with an Oxbridge degree.|$|E

40|$|The idea of {{networks}} is ubiquitous. The images and metaphors of electronic networks in particular permeate our thinking, including that in education. Researching and Understanding <b>Educational</b> <b>Networks</b> extends {{the discussion of}} education networks in a unique and novel way by relating it to teacher learning. Following an investigation of teacher and school networks in the United Kingdom, the authors found that theoretical perspectives taken from existing work on such networks were not adequate to provide an understanding of their potential, or to {{provide the basis for}} researching them in ways that reflected the variety of teacher experience. This book presents analyses of the problems with existing theories of teacher learning, which for example draw on ideas of 'communities of practice', and explores what network theories can be brought to the problem of how teachers and schools create and share new knowledge about practice. Innovative networking theories discussed include: social network analysis; social capital theories; actor-network theory; investigations of electronic networks, including computer-mediated conferencing; how people learn at events such as conferences. Researching and Understanding <b>Educational</b> <b>Networks</b> explores a new application of network theories derived from quite different fields of work, and extends it by being concerned about networks beyond organisations, and specifically about <b>educational</b> <b>networks.</b> Their application to <b>educational</b> <b>networks,</b> and to teacher learning in particular, is a unique contribution of the book. This enables it to be of interest to both researchers and those studying for higher degrees, including students who are professionals working in schools...|$|R
