Five patients participated for whom vertical movement of <b>denture</b> <b>bases</b> was measured by comparing the thickness of plaster interocclusal records made with the denture at rest and under biting pressure. <b>Denture</b> <b>bases</b> were processed on master casts formed from final impressions made in full arch custom trays.

Five mandibular and 5 maxillary <b>denture</b> <b>bases</b> were milled from wax blanks and denture teeth were waxed into their tooth sockets.

These measured bond strengths were compared to those obtained by packing the soft lining material against poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) <b>denture</b> <b>base</b> acrylic resin dough. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three groups of 10 specimens each were constructed for both tensile and shear tests. In the first group, Molloplast-B was packed against cured PMMA <b>denture</b> <b>base</b> surface. In the second group, Molloplast-B was packed against cured PMMA <b>denture</b> <b>base</b> whose surface had been roughened with an acrylic bur. In a third group, Molloplast-B was packed against PMMA <b>denture</b> <b>base</b> acrylic resin dough. RESULTS: Molloplast-B exhibited significantly higher tensile and shear bond strengths when packed against acrylic resin dough. Roughening the <b>denture</b> <b>base</b> surface prior to the application of Molloplast-B had a statistically significant weakening effect on tensile bond strength compared with the smooth surface and the acrylic resin dough. For the shear bond strength, roughening the surface produced a nonsignificant increase compared with the smooth surface, but the bond was weaker than when packed against acrylic resin dough.

The edentulous area was made flat to eliminate the influence of residual ridge forms. Two types of removable partial dentures with different direct retainers: 1, a cone crown telescope （CCT）; and 2, a modified circumferential clasp with a distal guide plate, a buccal retentive arm and a lingual enlarged bracing arm （MCC）, with an embrasure clasp as an indirect retainer, were designed. The following conditions of the denture-base conformity with the simulated mucosa were established: completely suitable（ CS）, mesial half unsuitable（ M－）, distal half unsuitable（ D－）, buccal half unsuitable （B－）, lingual half unsuitable （L－）, and completely unsuitable （CU）. A 200 μm clearance area was made between the <b>denture</b> <b>base</b> and simulated mucosa on these unsuitable parts. The stresses at the apical, buccal and distal portions, the distal displacement of abutment teeth and the subsidence of the <b>denture</b> <b>base</b> were investigated. Both the stress on and the displacement of abutment teeth for the partially unsuitable <b>denture</b> <b>base</b> were larger than those for the completely suitable denture bases for the CCT-retained denture. The distal stress and distal displacement of abutment teeth for the completely unsuitable <b>denture</b> <b>base</b> were larger than for the completely suitable <b>denture</b> <b>base</b> with the MCC-retained denture. The buccal stress distribution and the distal displacement of the abutment teeth with the CCT-retained denture were significantly larger than those with the MCC-retained denture under all conditions.

The existence of gaps between the casts and acrylic bases was assessed using a profile projector at 5 points. No statistically significant differences were observed between the control group and group II. However, group III differed statistically from the others (p< 0. 05). Treatment in microwave oven at 604 W for 10 min produced the greatest discrepancies in the adaptation of maxillary acrylic resin <b>denture</b> <b>bases</b> to the stone casts...|$|R
40|$|This {{investigation}} was undertaken {{to study the}} abrasion and staining resistance of den-ture base and veneering resins. The abrasion of certain resins was tested with specific commercial cleaning agents and dentifrices by use of natural and synthetic bristle tooth-brushes and denture brushes. Staining resis-tance was tested by use of natural food stains on the resins. Results indicate some general guidelines for the clinical selection, use, and maintenance of dental restorations or appliances fabricated with these resins. It is clinically observable that the surfaces of some resin veneer crowns and <b>denture</b> <b>bases</b> become abraded and dull, stain mor...|$|R

Objectives. Polyamide- 12 (PA) is a flexible material suited for <b>denture</b> <b>bases</b> and clasping. This study investigated its potential aging effects {{with a focus on}} surface roughness, color stability, and elasticity. Methods. PA specimens (Valplast) of 40 × 10 × 2 mm and equally measuring PMMA specimens (Palapress) as control were fabricated. Color changes after storage in air, water, coffee, and red wine...|$|R
