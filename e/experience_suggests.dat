25|$|Where deep breath-hold divers are {{observed}} to use hyperventilation timely and informed advice may {{save their lives}} but <b>experience</b> <b>suggests</b> that divers are reluctant to change their practice unless {{they have a very}} clear understanding of the mechanics of the process.|$|E
25|$|The Endocrine Society {{does not}} {{recommend}} endocrine treatment of prepubertal children because clinical <b>experience</b> <b>suggests</b> that GID can be reliably assessed {{only after the}} first signs of puberty. It recommends treating transsexual adolescents by suppressing puberty with puberty blockers until age 16 years old, after which cross-sex hormones may be given.|$|E
25|$|An {{opposite}} {{factor of}} perceived control {{is that of}} prior experience. Prior experience is typically associated with less optimistic bias, which some studies suggest is from either {{a decrease in the}} perception of personal control, or make it easier for individuals to imagine themselves at risk. Prior <b>experience</b> <b>suggests</b> that events may be less controllable than previously believed.|$|E

25|$|There is {{inadequate}} evidence of safety in human pregnancy. Animal studies and {{many years of}} clinical <b>experience</b> <b>suggest</b> that fusidic acid is devoid of teratogenic effects (birth defects), but fusidic acid can cross the placental barrier.|$|R
50|$|Doxycycline and {{minocycline}} are {{the medications}} of choice. For people allergic to antibiotics of the tetracycline class, rifampin is an alternative. Early clinical <b>experience</b> <b>suggested</b> that chloramphenicol {{may also be}} effective, however, in vitro susceptibility testing revealed resistance.|$|R
25|$|If global price {{movements}} are transmitted to local markets, {{farmers in the}} developing world could benefit from the rising price of food. According to researchers from the Overseas Development Institute, this may depend on farmers' capacity to respond to changing market conditions. <b>Experience</b> <b>suggests</b> that farmers lack the credit and inputs needed to respond in the short term. In the medium or long term, however, they could benefit, as seen in the Asian Green Revolution or in many African countries in the recent past.|$|E
25|$|Typical {{deficiencies}} {{may include}} problems identifying, processing, describing, {{and working with}} one's own feelings, often marked {{by a lack of}} understanding of the feelings of others; difficulty distinguishing between feelings and the bodily sensations of emotional arousal; confusion of physical sensations often associated with emotions; few dreams or fantasies due to restricted imagination; and concrete, realistic, logical thinking, often to the exclusion of emotional responses to problems. Those who have alexithymia also report very logical and realistic dreams, such as going to the store or eating a meal. Clinical <b>experience</b> <b>suggests</b> it is the structural features of dreams more than the ability to recall them that best characterizes alexithymia.|$|E
500|$|Although many attend regular {{education}} classes, some children with AS may utilize {{special education services}} because of their social and behavioral difficulties. Adolescents with AS may exhibit ongoing difficulty with self care or organization, and disturbances in social and romantic relationships. Despite high cognitive potential, most young adults with AS remain at home, yet some do marry and work independently. The [...] "different-ness" [...] adolescents experience can be traumatic. Anxiety may stem from preoccupation over possible violations of routines and rituals, from being placed in a situation without a clear schedule or expectations, or from concern with failing in social encounters; the resulting stress may manifest as inattention, withdrawal, reliance on obsessions, hyperactivity, or aggressive or oppositional behavior. Depression is often the result of chronic frustration from repeated failure to engage others socially, and mood disorders requiring treatment may develop. Clinical <b>experience</b> <b>suggests</b> the rate of suicide may be higher among those with AS, but {{this has not been}} confirmed by systematic empirical studies.|$|E
40|$|Participatory {{budgets are}} {{emerging}} as a paradigm for participation. However, there are many variants of such <b>experiences</b> <b>suggesting</b> a look of general methodology. Moreover {{there is a little}} use of ICT in this application context. We present a configurable architecture for e-participatory budget formation support...|$|R
25|$|Advocates of tantric and neotantric sex {{who claim}} that Western culture focuses {{too much on the}} goal of climactic orgasm, which reduces the ability to have intense {{pleasure}} during other moments of the sexual <b>experience,</b> <b>suggest</b> that eliminating this enables a richer, fuller and more intense connection.|$|R
40|$|Background: There is a {{resurgence}} of interest in home hemodialysis (HD), especially frequent or extended forms involving unconventionally frequent (> 3 times/wk) and/or long (> 6 hours) treatments. This resurgence is driven by cost containment and <b>experience</b> <b>suggesting</b> lower mortality risk compared with facility HD and peritoneal dialysis (PD) ...|$|R
2500|$|California {{banned the}} {{pharmaceutical}} lindane, effective 2002, and the Michigan House of Representatives {{passed a bill}} in 2009 to restrict its use to doctors' offices. A recent analysis of the California ban concluded {{that a majority of}} pediatricians had not experienced problems treating lice or scabies since that ban took effect. The study also documented a marked decrease in lindane wastewater contamination and a dramatic decline in lindane poisoning incidents reported to poison control centers. The authors concluded, [...] "The California <b>experience</b> <b>suggests</b> elimination of pharmaceutical lindane produced environmental benefits, was associated with a reduction in reported unintentional exposures and did not adversely affect head lice and scabies treatment." ...|$|E
2500|$|An {{extensive}} publicity {{effort is}} a second and subsidiary, although vital, aspect of the comprehensive campaign. Publicity—often called [...] "the air war"—is {{one of the primary}} vehicles by which information gleaned from employer research may be used. The use of [...] "white papers", press conferences, advertising (in all media) or the distribution of research (independent or not) often is an important aspect of the publicity campaign. The creative release of information to the public is increasing. Demonstrations, the use of street theater and music, picketing, leafleting, bannering and disruptive tactics (such as projecting images on a plant's walls at night or using [...] "human flies" [...] to climb buildings and hang banners) are increasingly common means of attracting public attention in an age where information overload is common. Although the timing and duration of the [...] "air war" [...] varies widely, <b>experience</b> <b>suggests</b> that the publicity campaign takes up half to two-thirds of the comprehensive campaign timeline.|$|E

50|$|Identification and {{specification}} of appropriate factors in an ARIMA {{model can be}} an important step in modelling as it can allow a reduction in the overall number of parameters to be estimated, while allowing the imposition on the model of types of behaviour that logic and <b>experience</b> <b>suggest</b> should be there.|$|R
40|$|Recent work on {{non-blocking}} data structures {{has proposed}} extending future processor designs {{to include a}} compare-and-swap primitive, CAS 2, which acts on two arbitrary memory locations. <b>Experience</b> <b>suggested</b> that the operations currently available, typically single-word compare-and-swap (CAS 1), are not expressive enough to be used alone in an efficient manner...|$|R

40|$|This article {{defends the}} {{rational}} {{nature of the}} religious experience of Transcendence. This is done by replacing {{the notion of the}} intentionality of experience advocated in Husserl’s phenomenology by that of the trans-intentionality of <b>experience</b> <b>suggested</b> by authors like Schleiermacher, Levinas and Marion and by refuting the accusation of fideism levelled against this latter approach...|$|R

50|$|A recent {{meta-analysis}} {{of research on}} training and <b>experience</b> <b>suggests</b> that experience level is only slightly related to accuracy in clinical judgment. Higher therapist experience {{has been found to}} be related to less anxiety, but also less focus. This suggests that there is still work to be done in terms of training clinicians and measuring successful training.|$|E

5000|$|Brown {{suggests}} that all names create expectancies about experience. He argues that this enables {{human beings to}} use names rhetorically to clarify ambiguous experience, to suggest approach or avoidance behavior toward experience, and to unite and divide experience. For example, naming a person's actions as [...] "terrorism" [...] clarifies the <b>experience,</b> <b>suggests</b> avoidance behavior, and divides that experience from ones named [...] "guerilla warfare." ...|$|E
5000|$|Research and <b>experience</b> <b>suggest</b> {{that the}} {{instrument}} is only effective (at least beyond the very short term) if seen as foreshadowing interest rate or other policy adjustments. Without a durable and independent {{impact on the}} nominal exchange rate, intervention is seen as having no lasting power to influence the real exchange rate and thus competitive conditions for the tradeable sector.|$|R

A better evaluation would include a 4 chamber, a 5 chamber and a 3 vessel evaluation(3).|$|R
