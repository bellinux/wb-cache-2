The biologic fate <b>of</b> <b>BIL</b> and unconjugated PEG {{were examined in}} rats given a single 0. 5 -mg/kg i. v. or 2 -mg/kg s. c. dose <b>of</b> <b>BIL</b> with 14 C label in 20 -kDa PEG or 125 I label in lispro. Unconjugated 14 C-labeled 20 -kDa PEG was dosed at 10 mg/kg i. v. or s. c. Blood, urine, and feces were collected up to 336 hours after dosing. Radioactivity was measured by scintillation spectrometry, and BIL was quanti-tated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Area under the curve and half-life for immunoreactive BIL were lower than those for both 14 C and 125 I after subcutaneous and intravenous admin-istration. The half-lives of 14 C after BIL and PEG dosing were similar. The clearance <b>of</b> immunoreactive <b>BIL</b> was 2. 4 -fold faster than that of 14 C and 1. 6 -fold faster than 125 I. After a sub-cutaneous dose <b>of</b> <b>BIL,</b> immunoreactive BIL accounted for 31 % of the circulating 125 I and 16 % of the circulating 14 C, indicating extensive catabolism <b>of</b> <b>BIL.</b> Subcutaneous bio-availability <b>of</b> <b>BIL</b> was 23 %– 29 %; bioavailability for unconju-gated PEG was 78 %. For unconjugated PEG, most of the 14 C dose was recovered in urine. For BIL, ‡ 86 % of 125 I was eliminated in urine and 14 C was eliminated about equally in urine and feces. The major 14 C-labeled catabolism product <b>of</b> <b>BIL</b> in urine was 20 -kDa PEG with lysine attached. The attachment of 20 -kDa PEG to lispro in BIL led to a different elimination pathway for PEG compared with unconjugated 20 -kDa PEG...|$|R

40|$|Backcross {{inbred lines}} (BILs) were {{developed}} in which chromosome segments of Lactuca saligna (wild lettuce) were introgressed into L. sativa (lettuce). These lines were developed by four to five backcrosses and one generation of selfing. The first three generations of backcrossing were random. Marker-assisted selection began in the BC 4 generation and continued until the final set <b>of</b> <b>BILs</b> was reached. A set of 28 lines was selected that together contained 96 % of the L. saligna genome. Of these lines, 20 had a single homozygous introgression (BILs), four had two homozygous introgressions (doubleBILs) and four lines had a heterozygous single introgression (preBILs). Segregation ratios in backcross generations were compared to distorted segregation ratios in an F- 2 population, and {{the results indicated that}} most of the distorted segregations can be explained by genetic effects on pollen- or egg-cell fitness.

30|$|For the {{purposes}} of genetic analysis, the advantages <b>of</b> using <b>BIL</b> or CSSL populations include (1) {{the presence of a}} high genetic and morphological similarity between lines that enables more precise estimates of quantitative traits and (2) the opportunity to study QTL[*]×[*]environment interactions more accurately because lines are homozygous, making it possible to evaluate phenotypic variation collected from multiple replications across years and environments (Jeuken and Lindhaut 2004). A practical advantage <b>of</b> <b>BILs</b> or CSSLs for commercial breeding purposes is the low percentage of the wild species parent genome, which allows the transfer of an interesting trait into a commercial cultivar to be relatively straightforward and rapid. As with CSSLs, the development of a complete set <b>of</b> <b>BILs</b> is labor- and time-intensive, and the marker evaluation is relatively expensive. For genetic studies involving epistasis, individual BILs or CSSLs may be crossed to identify interacting loci.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Children’s stool {{disposal}} {{is often}} overlooked in sanitation programs of any country. Unsafe <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> children’s stool makes children susceptible to many diseases that transmit through faecal-oral route. Therefore, the study {{aims to examine}} the magnitude <b>of</b> unsafe <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> children’s stools in India, the factors associated with it and finally its association with childhood diarrhea. Methods Data from {{the third round of}} the National Family Health Survey (NFHS- 3) conducted in 2005 – 06 is used to carry out the analysis. The binary logistic regression model is used to examine the factors associated with unsafe <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> children’s stool. Binary logistic regression is also used to examine the association between unsafe <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> children’s stool and childhood diarrhea. Result Overall, stools of 79 % of children in India were disposed of unsafely. The urban-rural gap in the unsafe <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> children’s stool was wide. Mother’s illiteracy and lack of exposure to media, the age of the child, religion and caste/tribe of the household head, wealth index, access to toilet facility and urban-rural residence were statistically associated with unsafe <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> stool. The odds of diarrhea in children whose stools were disposed of unsafely was estimated to be 11 % higher (95 % CI: 1. 01 – 1. 21) than that of children whose stools were disposed of safely. An increase in the unsafe <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> children’s stool in the community also increased the risk of diarrhea in children. Conclusion We found significant statistical association between children’s stool disposal and diarrhea. Therefore, gains in reduction of childhood diarrhea can be achieved in India through the complete elimination <b>of</b> unsafe <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> children’s stools. The sanitation programmes currently being run in India must also focus on safe <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> children’s stool...|$|R
