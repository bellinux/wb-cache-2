Many of the buildings in disrepair are irreplaceable listed buildings such as the former ABC cinema (previously the King's Theatre) on Titchfield Street. Plans to improve the derelict building at the top of John Finnie Street that was destroyed by a fire in the late 1980s have been submitted to include a council office retaining the original <b>façade.</b> <b>Work</b> is estimated to be completed in 2012.

5000|$|In [...] 1801, the Hammerwood {{estate was}} {{purchased}} by Magens Dorrien Magens (...) , a London merchant banker {{who served as a}} Tory MP for Carmarthen (for just six months in 1796; he was unseated after his opponent lodged a successful election petition) and later for Ludgershall, in Wiltshire, from 1804 to 1812. Upon his death in 1849 he left Hammerwood to his son, John Dorrien Magens, who as {{chairman of the board of}} the East Grinstead Railway Company (EGR) was responsible for the connection of East Grinstead to the railway system at Three Bridges in 1855. It would seem likely that extensions to the house, specifically to the north-east service wing, took place under the ownership of the Dorrien Magens family, and census records from the 1840s indicate at least ten indoor staff during the period.John Dorrien Magens sold Hammerwood to Oswald Augustus Smith (1826-1902; of Smith's Bank, later part of NatWest) in June 1864 for £37,250 (equating to approximately £4.2 million in 2015 pounds), of which £10,000 was for the timber.

The great day. Mr Christian, the architect from the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, came down to inspect the church and pronounced it in order. The annual Boat Race came off this morning and Oxford won … the Liberalshave gained more seats … All went very well. May God bless our church now dedicated to the high and holy use of teaching His truth. Extract from Oswald Augustus Smith's diary on the commissioning of St Stephen's Church, Hammerwood, 22 March 1881. Whilst maintaining the 2,000 acre estate of parkland, arable farmland and woods, Oswald Augustus also installed a gas system for the lighting of the house, and fully insulated the newly raised roof. Initially paying for a Chapel of Ease for the three local parishes of East Grinstead, Forest Row and Hartfield, in 1873, he provided for a village school for 100 children; in 1875 for the Vicarage; in 1880 for St Stephen's Church, Hammerwood (to the design of E. P. Loftus Brock) at the cost of £7,431, the first vicar being Rev. Clement Colby Woodland of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge; in 1892 for the rebuilding of St Peter's Church, Holtye in memory of his late wife (Rose Sophia Vansittart, 1832-1892); in 1893 for the rebuilding of the Countess of Thanet's Almshouses on Holtye Common, and at the end of the 19th century for a new building for the Queen Victoria Hospital in East Grinstead. Additionally, much of the village of Hammerwood which exists today (the population of which reached a peak of 438 in 1891), and some of the houses to the east of the village of Ashurst Wood, were built during Smith's tenure as tied cottages for estate workers.|$|E

40|$|Building facade has a {{significant}} impact on the environmental and economic performance of buildings and projects. The specification of their elements at the early design phase depends on numerous technical, environmental and economic factors and involves several stakeholders. The procurement and delivery of the <b>facade</b> <b>work</b> package from the early design phase, through detailed design and manufacture, to installation is a process with several inherent risk factors due to the involved cost, technical and engineering complexities and its position on the critical path in all projects. This research investigates the process of selection and specification of building facade elements at   the early design phases with the overarching aim of identifying the issues affecting specification decisions, their root causes and impact on projects. The research utilizes a mixed research approach which combines a retrospective case study and an industry survey as two research methods that build on each other. The findings suggest that the complexity of specification at the early design phases is exacerbated by factors such as the inadequate technical knowledge of stakeholders involved in the decision making process, the non-involvement of building facade consultants, the late involvement of specialist facade subcontractors, and in a few cases by some commercial exclusivity agreements that restricts specification decisions.  </span...|$|E
40|$|The {{theme of}} this thesis is devoted to Sokolski dom in Ljubljana and its renewal, which falls under the secular {{architectural}} heritage. The selected restoration works do not intervene with {{the structure of the}} building, so a building permit is not neede. We want to refurbish the appearance of a building and extend its lifetime. Modernization, such as the installation of new thermal insulation composite windows, must be carried out with scrutiny and not {{at the expense of the}} destruction of the original architectural design. This means that we take the suggested implemented measures into conjoined account with the law of protection of cultural heritage. ZVKDS issues the cultural renovation conditions and then a cultural consensus for proposed renovation work. The measures selected for the renovation works are accurately described, in particular <b>facade</b> <b>work,</b> carpentry and roofing are the most demanding and consequently represent the greatest expense. These works require a lot of precision and are time-consuming, mainly because the use of modern construction practices is limited in dealing with cultural heritage. Although the inventory part contains a large array of possible works, older buildings still present a large likelihood of unforeseen costs. The result is a recapitulation of the census and represents the basis for further decisions on the extent of recovery of the hall Tabor...|$|E
40|$|In a time {{in which}} 50 % of the world {{inhabitants}} live in an urban context, a percentage that will definitely even grow, it is important to ask whether the residential building within daily public and anonymous city life still has the quality of privacy and identity of a ‘home’. The on-going PhD research “The façade as an intermediary element between outside and inside” will study the 20 th century dwelling in the Netherlands. It focusses on the façade of the collective residential building in the urban context of the Dutch city. The high complexity of functions of the façade makes it a very sensitive element of the house: a functional skin, a boundary and filter between inside and outside and the representational element (a face or even a mask) of the house. The aim of the research is to show the development of the representational and filtering functions of the façade in Dutch residential buildings within the historical context of the last century. Tendencies in design and ideas about the meaning of the façade will be traced. The intention is to obtain more insight into the changes of signs of the residential façade, while focusing on aspects of the (social) filter and aesthetics. The aim {{of this paper is to}} explain how signs within architecture, and more specifically within the residential <b>façade,</b> <b>work</b> as a language, as a part of our communication. Signs are dynamic and they have an interrelationship with public frames of references and current opinions. A method for analysing the façade with its signs will be discussed. A first conclusion will show how the façade communicates in terms of representation and in terms of protection to the city. Some examples will discuss changes of signs or even the confusion or decline of their meanings. ArchitectureArchitecture and The Built Environmen...|$|E
