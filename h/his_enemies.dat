5|$|This {{claim was}} {{rejected}} by Appian, who maintained that Octavian shared an equal interest with Lepidus and Antony in eradicating <b>his</b> <b>enemies.</b> Suetonius said that Octavian was reluctant to proscribe officials, but did pursue <b>his</b> <b>enemies</b> with more rigor than the other triumvirs. Plutarch described the proscriptions as a ruthless and cutthroat swapping {{of friends and family}} among Antony, Lepidus, and Octavian. For example, Octavian allowed the proscription of his ally Cicero, Antony the proscription of his maternal uncle Lucius Julius Caesar (the consul of 64 BC), and Lepidus his brother Paullus.|$|E
5|$|According to Diodorus, Philip {{marched on}} <b>his</b> <b>enemies</b> in this {{alliance}} {{before they had}} chance to combine, and forced them to ally to Macedon instead.

5|$|Caesar was now {{the primary}} figure of the Roman state, {{enforcing}} and entrenching his powers. <b>His</b> <b>enemies</b> feared that he had ambitions to become an autocratic ruler.

5|$|In March 1787, he {{continued}} his attack against <b>his</b> <b>enemies</b> from Riobamba {{with a series of}} eight satirical letters which he called Cartas riobambenses. In response, <b>his</b> <b>enemies</b> denounced Espejo before the President of the Royal Audiencia, Juan José De Villalengua. On August 24, 1787, Villalengua requested that Espejo either to go to Lima or return to Quito to occupy a post in the government, and subsequently arrested him. Espejo was accused of writing El Retrato de Golilla, a satire against King Charles III and the Marquis de la Sonora, colonial minister of the Indies. He was taken to Quito, and from prison he sent three petitions to the Court in Madrid, which decreed, on Charles III's behalf, that the case was to be taken to the Viceroy of Bogotá. President Villalengua feigned ignorance of the matter and sent Espejo to Bogotá to defend his own cause.|$|E
5|$|After this success, he {{was sent}} to Asia Minor, where the Turkish raids on the Byzantine borderlands had become a menace, and where Turkish {{settlers}} had begun encroaching upon imperial territory. He remained there until 1267 and achieved some success, securing the lands around the valley of the Maeander River and restoring the defences of the region. The historian George Pachymeres certainly praised his conduct of these operations, and alleged that the mere mention of his approach caused fear to <b>his</b> <b>enemies.</b>|$|E

5|$|Khalid {{utilized}} {{his better}} understanding of terrain in every possible way to gain strategic superiority over <b>his</b> <b>enemies.</b> During his Persian campaigns, he initially never entered deep into Persian territory and always kept the Arabian desert at his rear, allowing his forces to retreat there {{in case of a}} defeat. It was only after all the strong Persian and Persian-allied forces were routed that he penetrated deep into Euphrates region and captured the regional capital of Iraq, Al-Hira. Again, at Yarmouk, the terrain would help him in executing his grand strategy of annihilating the Byzantines.|$|E

50|$|After recovery, Manson {{does not}} {{recognize}} Cushing, and asks him to find <b>his</b> <b>enemy.</b> Cushing says he found him and arranged a meeting for them.

On {{the date of the}} meeting, Cushing takes Manson to a mountain and leaves him alone to meet <b>his</b> <b>enemy.</b> Cushing replaced the bullets in Manson's gun with blanks prior to the meeting. He walks back to Manson shortly after leaving, and Manson becomes confused, calling <b>his</b> <b>enemy</b> a coward. Cushing then reveals his identity, and Manson deliberates what to do.

He decides to take his own life, as <b>his</b> friend and <b>enemy</b> are the same, and he owes his life to his friend. Before he pulls the trigger, Evelyn comes and grabs Manson's arm.

Alice still loves Cushing, and Cushing—after discussions with Manson about <b>his</b> <b>enemy</b> proposing to the daughter of a beautiful, age appropriate woman that loved him—feels love for Alice as well.|$|R

5|$|Paris {{was finally}} recaptured by Charles VII of France in 1436. When the French king re-entered the city, <b>his</b> <b>enemies</b> in Paris {{fortified}} {{themselves in the}} Bastille; after a siege, they eventually ran out of food, surrendered and were allowed {{to leave the city}} after the payment of a ransom. The castle remained a key Parisian fortress, but was successfully seized by the Burgundians in 1464, when they convinced royal troops to surrender: once taken, this allowed their faction to make a surprise attack into Paris, almost resulting in the capture of the king.|$|E
5|$|Poems {{were also}} written to {{celebrate}} kingship. For example, at the Precinct of Amun-Re at Karnak, Thutmose III (r. 1479–1425 BC) of the Eighteenth dynasty erected a stela commemorating his military victories {{in which the}} gods bless Thutmose in poetic verse and ensure for him victories over <b>his</b> <b>enemies.</b> In addition to stone stelas, poems have been found on wooden writing boards used by schoolboys. Besides the glorification of kings, poems were written to honor various deities, and even the Nile.|$|E
5|$|Responsibility for {{the defeat}} {{ultimately}} fell on Alcibiades, and <b>his</b> <b>enemies</b> used {{the opportunity to}} attack him and have him removed from command, although some modern scholars believe that Alcibiades was unfairly blamed for Antiochus's mistake. Diodorus reports that, {{in addition to his}} mistake at Notium, Alcibiades was discharged on account of false accusations brought against him by <b>his</b> <b>enemies.</b> According to Anthony Andrewes, professor of ancient history, the extravagant hopes that his successes of the previous summer had created were a decisive element in his downfall. Consequently, Alcibiades condemned himself to exile. Never again returning to Athens, he sailed north to the castles in the Thracian Chersonese, which he had secured during his time in the Hellespont. The implications of the defeat were severe for Athens. Although the defeat had been minor, it occasioned the removal of not only Alcibiades but also his allies like Thrasybulus, Theramenes and Critias. These were likely the most capable commanders Athens had at the time, and their removal would help lead to the Athenian surrender only two years later, after their complete defeat at Aegospotami.|$|E
