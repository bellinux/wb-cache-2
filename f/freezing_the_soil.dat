50|$|The International Fund for Monuments (IFM) was an {{organization}} created by Colonel James A. Gray (1909-1994) after his retirement from the U.S. Army in 1960. Gray had conceived of a visionary project {{to arrest the}} settlement of the Leaning Tower of Pisa by <b>freezing</b> <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> underneath, and formed the organization in 1965 {{as a vehicle for}} the implementation of this idea. Even though this project did not materialize, an opportunity arose for the young organization to participate in the conservation of the rock-hewn churches of Lalibela in Ethiopia. In 1966 Gray secured the support of philanthropist Lila Acheson Wallace (1889-1984), who offered $150,000 to the International Fund for Monuments and UNESCO for this project. The project continued until the Communist overthrow of Haile Selassie I and the subsequent expulsion of foreigners from Ethiopia. After Ethiopia, Gray's interests shifted to Easter Island (Rapa Nui) in Chile. Gray formed the Easter Island Committee, with Norwegian ethnographer and adventurer Thor Heyerdahl (1914-2002) as its honorary chairman. Gray arranged to have one of the monolithic human figures known as moai exhibited in the United States. With the help of anthropologist William Mulloy (1917-1978), Gray selected an 8 ft, five-ton head, which was exhibited in front of the Seagram Building in New York and in the Pan American Union building in Washington, D.C.|$|E

It is important that the way in which soils respond to such perturbations is better understood as there are implications for both P availability and loss to surface waters from soils. In this study, the effects of air-drying and freezing were investigated using two soils, one being a forest soil (FS) high in organic matter and the other being a sterile soil (SS) low in organic matter. Soil P was fractionated using a modified Hedley fractionation method to examine the changes of phosphorus fractions induced by air-drying and freezing. Generally, {{there were no significant differences}} of total phosphorus among the three treatments (CV% < 10 %). Compared with field moist soils, <b>freezing</b> <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> evoked few changes on phosphorus fractions except that the resin-P increased in FS soil. On the contrary, air-drying significantly changed the distribution of phosphors fractions for both soils: increased the labile-P (especially resin-P) and organic-P (NaHCO(3) -Po, NaOH-Po and Con. HCl-Po) at the expense of NaOH-Pi and occlude-P (Dil. HCl-P and Con. HCl-Pi). Resin-P significantly increased by 31 % for SS soil and by 121 % for FS soil upon air-drying. The effect of air-drying seemed to be more pronounced in the FS soil with high organic matter content. These results indicated that drying seem to drive the P transformation form occlude-P to labile-P and organic-P and accelerated the weathering of stable P pool. This potentially could be significant for soil P supply to plants and P losses from soils to surface waters under changing patterns of rainfall and temperature as predicted by some climate change scenarios...|$|E

The date of the first significant snowfalls conditioned the beginning and rhythm of <b>freezing</b> of <b>the</b> <b>soil.</b> Wet years resulted in a thick snow cover which insulated the ground from external climate oscillations and favored a shallow frost layer (2008 – 2009, 2009 – 2010 and 2010 – 2011). On the other hand, years with low precipitations promoted deeper <b>freezing</b> of <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> down to 60 – 70 cm extending until late May or early June (2006 – 2007, 2007 – 2008 and 2011 – 2012). When snow melted a high increase of temperatures of 10 – 12 °C in few weeks was recorded at all depths. At this time of the year, periglacial activity is enhanced due to higher water availability and the existence of freeze–thaw cycles.

Future climate scenarios point to a temperature increase and precipitation decrease in the area, which would entail deeper but shorter frozen soil layers.

The model is implemented in a 2 -D finite element code, and the porosity rate function is calibrated and validated. Effectiveness of the model is then illustrated in an example of freezing of a vertical cut in frost-susceptible soil. Copyright © 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R
5000|$|Infiltration {{is caused}} by two forces: gravity and {{capillary}} action. While smaller pores offer greater resistance to gravity, very small pores pull water through capillary action in addition to and even against the force of gravity. [...] The rate of infiltration is determined by soil characteristics including ease of entry, storage capacity, and transmission rate through <b>the</b> <b>soil.</b> <b>The</b> <b>soil</b> texture and structure, vegetation types and cover, water content of <b>the</b> <b>soil,</b> soil temperature, and rainfall intensity all {{play a role in}} controlling infiltration rate and capacity. For example, coarse-grained sandy soils have large spaces between each grain and allow water to infiltrate quickly. Vegetation creates more porous <b>soils</b> by protecting <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> from raindrop impact, which can close natural gaps between soil particles, loosening soil through root action and enhancing <b>the</b> presence of <b>soil</b> organism like termites, worms and small mammals that have a direct impact on soil bulk densities. This is why forested areas have the highest infiltration rates of any vegetative types. [...] The top layer of leaf litter that is not decomposed protects <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> from <b>the</b> pounding action of rain; without this <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> can become far less permeable. In chaparral vegetated areas, the hydrophobic oils in the succulent leaves can be spread over <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> surface with fire, creating large areas of hydrophobic soil. Other conditions that can lower infiltration rates or block them include dry plant litter that resists re-wetting, or frost. If soil is saturated at the time of an intense <b>freezing</b> period, <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> can become a concrete frost on which almost no infiltration would occur. Over an entire watershed, there are likely to be gaps in the concrete frost or hygroscopic soil where water could infiltrate. [...] Once water has infiltrated <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> it remains in <b>the</b> <b>soil,</b> percolates down to the ground water table, or becomes part of the subsurface runoff process.|$|R
40|$|Frost heave may be {{a concern}} in {{northern}} climates, but frost action can be reliably mitigated by utilizing one or more specific design techniques. In northern or cold climates, the influence of frost and <b>freezing</b> of <b>the</b> roadbed is an important consideration. Certain subgrade soils are particularly susceptible to frost action, which raises the foundation and concrete pavement layer(s) vertically during freezing periods (commonly referred to as heaving or frost heaving). Generally, frost heave is limited to areas of freezing climates with silty <b>soils.</b> If <b>the</b> heaving is uniform along a pavement section it is not detrimental, but if heaving is localized, it upsets the uniformity of support provided to the surface pavement. Removing or treating these materials {{will be necessary to}} ensure that the pavement performs as desired. Thus, the potential for frost heaving of subgrade materials must be assessed by the engineer during the design phase. More on this topic is available in ACPA’s EB 204 P, “Subgrades and Subbases for Concrete Pavements. ” Frost Action and Heave Frost action is a phenomenon that occurs in the winter and early spring in northern climates. Practically all surface soils in cold climates undergo some frost action, the magnitude of which is dependent upon the locally prevailing climate and precipitation and soil type. Frost action divides into two phases: <b>freezing</b> of <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> water and thawing of <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> water. Heaving of the road from frost action is termed “frost heave. ” Frost heave, particularly when in isolated areas, induces uneven support of a pavement. When heavy loads pass over the area of uneven support, a crack may form in the pavement surface layer. Frost heave is caused by the formation of ice lenses in <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> below <b>the</b> pavement (Figure 1). Water expands roughly 9 percent by volume when frozen. When freezing temperatures penetrate a subgrade <b>soil,</b> water from <b>the</b> unfrozen portion of the subgrade is drawn towards the frozen zone. If <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> is susceptible to capillary action, the water migrates to previously formed ice crystals and <b>freezes.</b> <b>The</b> size of the ice lens depends upon the quantity of free water available within <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> and from <b>the</b> water table, and time. There are at least three conditions that must exist before frost heaving can occur. They are...|$|R
40|$|Evidences {{of highly}} {{localized}} methane fluxes are reported from the Arctic shelf, hot spots of methane emissions in thermokarst lakes, and {{are believed to}} evolve to features like Yamal crater on land. The origin of large methane outbursts is problematic. Here we show, that the biogenic methane (13 C ≤ − 71 ‰) which formed before and during soil freezing is presently held in the permafrost. Field and experimental observations show that methane tends to accumulate at the permafrost table or in the coarse-grained lithological pockets surrounded by the sediments less-permeable for gas. Our field observations, radiocarbon dating, laboratory tests and theory all suggest that depending on <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> structure and <b>freezing</b> dynamics, this methane may have been displaced downwards tens of meters during freezing and has accumulated in the lithological pockets. The initial flux of methane from the one pocket disclosed by drilling was {{at a rate of}} more than 2. 5 kg C(CH 4) m− 2 h− 1. The age of the methane was 8 – 18 thousand years younger than the age of the sediments, suggesting that it was displaced tens of meters during <b>freezing.</b> <b>The</b> theoretical background provided the insight on the cryogenic displacement of methane in support of the field and experimental data. Upon freezing of sediments, methane follows water migration and either dissipates in <b>the</b> <b>freezing</b> <b>soils</b> or concentrates at certain places controlled by <b>the</b> <b>freezing</b> rate, initial methane distribution and soil structure...|$|R
40|$|The {{ergosterol}} {{content of}} soil {{can be used}} as an indicator of fungal activity. A method has been developed for the extraction and determination of ergosterol in organic soils, as part of a study to assess the correlation between fungal activity and the sequestration of metal pollutants. The moisture content of <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> affected <b>the</b> extraction process. Four consecutive extractions with methanol removed > 95 % of the ergosterol that can be obtained from the fresh sample (63 % moisture) by exhaustive extraction. By <b>freeze</b> drying <b>the</b> <b>soils</b> prior to extraction (a) up to 35 % more ergosterol was extracted after a single extraction, (b) > 90 % of the recoverable ergosterol was collected in two extractions and (c) the repeatability of the extraction was improved. Storage of <b>soil</b> extracts in <b>the</b> absence of light prevents degradation of ergosterol. A previously reported method for determination of ergosterol by HPLC has been improved by modification of the eluant composition. With 46 % methanol/ 46 % acetonitrile/ 8 % dichloromethane, ergosterol was eluted with good resolution approximately 8 min after injection of 20 mul of the extract. The detection limit of the HPLC method was 0. 5 mug/ml ergosterol, equivalent to 0. 06 mug/g in 25 g fresh soil. Changes in ergosterol contents of peaty soil treated with fungicide, and in samples of the peaty podzol and a humus iron podzol in the vicinity of fungal fruiting bodies, have been determined...|$|R
40|$|Frost {{susceptible}} {{soils are}} vulnerable to frost action in seasonal freezing and permafrost regions, such soils may experience large deformations upon temperature changes. Frost heave and soil strengthening occurs as <b>the</b> <b>soils</b> <b>freeze,</b> whereas settlement and thaw weakening is expected during the melting process. Consequently, significant damage to infrastructure in cold regions {{can be caused by}} freezing-thawing cycles. Accounting for soil behavior during freezing and thawing is essential for engineering design and minimizing frost-related damage. 	An elastic-plastic constitutive model for freezing and thawing <b>soils</b> is developed. <b>The</b> constitutive relationship is temperature-dependent, capable of capturing the deformation behavior and strength evolution of <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> subjected to arbitrary loading and thermal boundary conditions. The yielding of <b>the</b> frozen <b>soil</b> is based on hardening plasticity and a critical state framework, with the pore ice content and specific volume as two parameters responsible for hardening and softening of <b>the</b> <b>soil.</b> A modified porosity rate function is adopted to simulate formation of ice lenses in <b>freezing</b> frost-susceptible <b>soils.</b> <b>The</b> function is implemented into a finite element system with a thermal-hydro-mechanical framework used to capture the multi-physics processes of <b>soil</b> <b>freezing</b> and thawing. <b>The</b> system is calibrated using available frost heave laboratory test data.
