25|$|Shortly {{before the}} {{demonstration}} of Pythagoras' theorem, the dialogue takes an epistemological turn when the interlocutors begin to discuss the fundamental nature of knowledge. The general question asked is how one can claim to know something when one does not <b>even</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> knowledge is. Via the Socratic method, it is shown {{that the answer to}} the question posed is innateness – one possesses a priori knowledge.|$|E
25|$|An {{inhabitant}} {{of ancient}} Troy, {{she was a}} brief companion of the First Doctor. The character was devised {{to act as a}} companion. However this was re-evaluated by the writers and Katarina was killed off during the following serial having appeared in just five episodes. As such, she was the first companion in the series to die. The writers, including producer John Wiles decided to write out Katarina as soon as possible, as they realized the writing challenges that came with the character. The writing challenges included the fact that the character was so very unused to modern concepts. For example, Katarina did not <b>even</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> a key was. However, they decided to write her out in the most dramatic way possible.|$|E

You don't <b>even</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> it was you saw," [...] as well as accusing the Take-Two employee who demonstrated the game of avoiding the most violent parts. Blank Rome subsequently filed a motion to have Thompson's behavior declared [...] "contempt for the court". Judge Friedman then recused himself from ruling, and instead filed a complaint against Thompson with The Florida Bar, calling Thompson's behavior [...] "inappropriate {{by a member of the}} bar, unprofessional and contemptible".|$|E

On June 30, 2017, she {{was appointed to}} the Order of Canada. Of the honor she said, [...] "I am a very, very proud Canadian, I am proud of where I am from, and to be recognized in this nature is surreal. It's not something you can dream about happening to you. I can dream of winning a World Cup or an Olympic gold medal, and that's my job, but to have your country recognize you – I don't <b>even</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> to say." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{recording}} {{sessions for}} Ecstasy took place {{a week after}} the recording sessions for [...] "Strawberry Wine". My Bloody Valentine spent a total of 10days recording the album. According to Kevin Shields, the sessions [...] "had no direction and [...] didn't <b>even</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> [...] were doing" [...] and [...] "bashed out all these tunes quickly, very demo-like". A number of songs were recorded that did not feature on the final release, as the band considered them [...] "awful". However, the sessions were [...] "the first time [...] actually played around properly in the studio", which resulted in [...] "extreme" [...] and [...] "quite nasty" [...] guitar sounds, which My Bloody Valentine would later become associated with.|$|E
500|$|Microsoft never {{formally}} {{commented on}} Cubitt's allegations and instead initially stated the iLoo was an April's fool joke. As a result, Cubitt questioned {{whether this was}} [...] "a very calculated ploy to destroy competition in its early stages, or is admitting they don't <b>even</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> time of the month it is less embarrassing and ridding them of a potentially expensive situation!" [...] Cubitt went on to state that [...] "as they have now discredited my idea as a joke, I {{will never be able}} to produce the idea" [...] and as such was [...] "consulting my law books now on defamatory statements". Neither Cubitt, nor Brunel University have taken public legal action against Microsoft pertaining to the i-Loo.|$|E
500|$|Verdi and Strepponi now {{decided on}} marriage; they {{travelled}} to Collonges-sous-Salève, a village then part of Piedmont. On 29 August 1859 {{the couple were}} married there, with only the coachman who had driven them there and the church bell-ringer as witnesses. At the end of 1859, Verdi wrote to his friend Cesare De Sanctis [...] " [...] I have not made any more music, I have not seen any more music, I have not thought anymore about music. I don't <b>even</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> colour my last opera is, and I almost don't remember it." [...] He began to remodel Sant'Agata, which took most of 1860 to complete and on which he continued {{to work for the}} next twenty years. This included major work on a square room that became his workroom, his bedroom, and his office.|$|E
6000|$|The meaning seems plain. These pagans {{had nothing}} against Christians, {{but they were}} quite ready to persecute Jews. For some reason or other they hated a Jew before they <b>even</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> a Christian was. May I not assume, then, that the {{persecution}} of Jews is a thing which antedates Christianity and was not born of Christianity? I think so. What was {{the origin of the}} feeling? ...|$|R

Preston begins his speech, but is interrupted by Albert, who questions if Preston <b>even</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> happens when an atom is split. When Darwin realizes that Preston has (unknowingly) built an atomic bomb, he orders Preston to stop. Preston scoffs the warning and starts the keg, which starts shaking and building up pressure.|$|R
500|$|... "Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride" [...] also explores and satirizes people's {{reactions}} to homosexuality through Stan and other characters who react to Sparky's behavior. For example, Stan admits {{he does not}} <b>even</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> being gay includes, except simply that it [...] "is bad". Also, when Cartman suggests to Stan that Sparky might be at the mall buying leather pants, it satirizes the stereotype that all gay men are engaged in the leather subculture. The episode also mocks what many LGBT activists perceive as hatred and misunderstandings about homosexuality often expressed by anti-LGBT and right-wing activists, including Christian ministers Jerry Falwell and Fred Phelps. This is partially illustrated in this episode by Mr. Garrison's condemnation of homosexuals, rooted in deep-seated fear of his own sexuality. Basing his comment off this episode, Gardiner commented that South Park had a [...] "Queer Lite" [...] attitude towards homosexuality, stating [...] "they are unemphatically tolerant, polymorphously perverse, ambiguously gay affirmative".|$|E
500|$|On December 10, 2014, The Washington Post {{published}} an updated account of its {{inquiry into the}} Rolling Stone article. [...] Slate reported that the Post account strongly implied Jackie's tale of rape had been fabricated {{in an attempt to}} win over [...] "Randall", who had previously rebuffed her romantic advances. Writing in Slate, Hannah Rosin described the new Washington Post investigation as close [...] "to calling the UVA gang rape story a fabrication". Emily Renda, who was a University of Virginia student {{at the time of the}} alleged attack and in whom Jackie also confided, said that she had become suspicious as to the veracity of Jackie's story prior to the Rolling Stone report, commenting to a Washington Post editor: [...] "I don't <b>even</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> I believe." [...] In the aftermath, Jackie was characterized as [...] "a really expert fabulist storyteller" [...] by Rolling Stone publisher Jann Wenner in an April 5, 2015 interview.|$|E
500|$|... "Battlefield" [...] is a mid-tempo pop and R ballad. It also {{derives from}} the genres of pop rock and soft rock. The {{instrumentation}} of [...] "Battlefield" [...] consists of a bass, piano, drums, percussion and guitar. [...] "Battlefield" [...] is set in common time with a moderate tempo of 144 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of G major with Sparks' vocal range spanning from the note of A3 to C6. The song's lyrics revolve around [...] "a tumultuous relationship where neither side wants to compromise", as stated by Jocelyn Vena of MTV News. Nick Levine of Digital Spy noted that [...] "Battlefield" [...] {{is based on the}} [...] "love is war" [...] metaphor. During the chorus, Sparks sings: [...] "I never meant to start a war / You know, I never wanna hurt you / Don't <b>even</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> we're fighting for / Why does love always feel like a battlefield, a battlefield, a battlefield." [...] Its bridge features the line: [...] "I guess you'd better go and get your armour".|$|E
5000|$|Under {{the titles}} of Ami on the Street, Ami on the Loose, and An Ami Horowitz Digital Short, Horowitz created satirical short films that have {{appeared}} on FOX News and YouTube.

50|$|Having {{only half}} a year to create a 160-page story, Tezuka {{assembled}} a basic plot from elements of unpublished work, {{the inspiration for the}} central character coming from a publicity still of the female robot from Metropolis (even though he had never seen the film or <b>even</b> <b>known</b> <b>what</b> it was about). When the manga was released, the response from the public was far greater than he imagined and that many students were inspired to become manga artists because of it.|$|R
5000|$|Alex Salmond, {{the former}} Scottish First Minister stated that Donald Trump was [...] "three times a loser". A {{spokesperson}} for the Trump Organization responded to this by saying: [...] "Does anyone care what this man thinks? He’s a hasbeen and totally irrelevant. The fact that he doesn’t <b>even</b> <b>know</b> <b>what’s</b> {{going on in his}} own constituency says it all.... He should go back to doing what he does best: unveiling pompous portraits of himself that pander to his already over-inflated ego".|$|R
500|$|In November 2012, Perry {{began work}} on her fourth album, Prism. She told Billboard, [...] "I know exactly the record I want to make next. I know the artwork, the {{coloring}} and the tone" [...] and [...] "I <b>even</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> type of tour I'm doing next. I'll be very pleased if the vision I have in my head becomes a reality." [...] Although she told L'Uomo Vogue in June 2012 that she planned to have [...] "darker elements" [...] in Prism {{following the end of}} her marriage, Perry revealed to MTV during the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards that she changed the album's direction after periods of self-reflection. She commented [...] "I felt very prismatic", which inspired the album's name. [...] "Roar" [...] was released as the lead single from Prism on August 10, 2013. It was promoted at the MTV Video Music Awards and reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100. [...] "Unconditionally" [...] was released as the second single from Prism on October 16, 2013, and peaked at number 14 in the United States.|$|E
500|$|Perry {{also said}} that her music would be getting [...] "real fucking dark", though also stated that her fans {{would be able to}} relate to it. [...] "I imagine that maybe my next record would {{be a little bit more}} of an artistic venture," [...] she said. [...] "Not that I'm going to self-sabotage either and be like, 'I'm going to make a crazy record that nobody really understands.'" [...] That fall, she later told Billboard about her plans for the album, saying she already envisioned several aspects of it. Perry told the {{magazine}} that she already had songs and ideas, and knew the type of record she would make next. She {{also said that}} although she had not started recording yet, she already knew how the artwork, coloring and tone of the album would turn out. Perry further detailed: [...] "I have to let the music take shape first. I <b>even</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> type of tour I'm doing next. I'll be very pleased if the vision I have in my head becomes a reality. But I have to honor the music." ...|$|E
500|$|Van der Sloot later {{retracted}} this confession in {{a prison}} cell interview with De Telegraaf, claiming {{that he had been}} coerced and [...] "tricked" [...] by police with a promise to be transferred to the Netherlands. He stated that at the time he signed the confession documents, he did not understand the content as it was in Spanish. He was quoted: [...] "In my blind panic, I signed everything, but didn't <b>even</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> it said." [...] Van der Sloot said that he was lured to Peru and framed by another gambler, named Elton Garcia, who he claimed was working undercover for the FBI. Van der Sloot's attorney Maximo Alonso Altez Navarro stated his intention to resign because the case [...] "created many problems" [...] for him. He had been threatened and harassed for taking the case, and Van der Sloot's family was unable to afford his legal expenses. However, Navarro stayed on to file a motion to void the confession on the grounds that his client was not properly represented during his interrogation. On 25 June, Superior Court Judge Wilder Casique Alvizuri rejected the motion, noting that Van der Sloot was represented by a state-appointed lawyer and provided a translator by the Dutch embassy. Navarro said that Van der Sloot was as [...] "depressed" [...] as anyone in prison would be.|$|E
5000|$|The {{song was}} {{performed}} in every show during the Innocence + Experience Tour. It was also performed specially {{as a part of}} [...] "Red Nose Day". Lead vocalist Bono has described it as a love song dedicated to his wife, Ali. He told Rolling Stone, [...] "Before I <b>even</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> commitment was, I ended up as a young man in the arms of this young woman, in a world somewhat hostile to the concept of the childhood sweetheart and a first love." ...|$|R
60|$|Such {{a trifle}} now remains to tell. Miss Kitty {{was the better}} {{business}} woman of the two, and kept the accounts, and understood, as Miss Ailie could not understand, how their little income was invested, and <b>even</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> consols were, though never quite certain whether it was their fall or rise that is matter for congratulation. And after the ship had sailed, she told Miss Ailie that nearly all their money was lost, {{and that she had}} known it for a month.|$|R
5000|$|... “Actually, I {{first started}} writing when I {{was about six}} or seven years old, though not with the idea of being a [...] "writer". I don’t think I <b>even</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> a writer was.

500|$|During {{the summer}} between {{his senior year}} of high school and his {{freshman}} year of college, Washington grew four inches. He began an intense regimen of weight training, and ran up and down the flights of steps in his seven-story dormitory building wearing a weighted vest to improve his endurance. Washington became more extroverted in college, so much so that he later said his life could be separated into two parts—his pre-college life and his life after college. He has frequently described his college years as [...] "the happiest time in my life." [...] He began dating his future wife Pat when he was a freshman. They met after she noticed him accidentally scoring four consecutive points for the opposing team in a freshman basketball game. She pursued him even though he often remained silent when she spent time with him. A lot of the emergence of Washington's personality is credited to Pat, who encouraged him to be more outgoing and overcome his low self-esteem. Washington spent a lot of his free time practicing in the gym. He played playground basketball in the summer, and was on several Urban League teams. He averaged 19.4 points and 22.3 rebounds on his freshman team at American. Pat helped him with his grades—despite the fact that he had done well his {{senior year of high}} school he was still far behind; he did not <b>even</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> a paragraph was when he entered college or how to write a report.|$|E
500|$|Following her {{departure}} from Hole in November 1999, Melissa Auf der Maur was recruited as the replacement bassist for D'arcy Wretzky in The Smashing Pumpkins in early 2000. Auf der Maur toured {{with the band}} for the Sacred and Profane tour in support of Machina/The Machines of God (2000) and appeared in the music videos accompanying its release. In May 2000, The Smashing Pumpkins disbanded and Auf der Maur did not have plans to continue her music career. In an interview with Jam!, Auf der Maur said: [...] "one {{of the reasons why}} I took 2001 off is I didn't <b>even</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> I was going to do with music. Maybe I was going to play in a cover band the rest of my life" [...] and that her [...] "relationship to music had become very army-oriented. I was a soldier, a hard worker who never got enough satisfaction from the music. I didn't know if I was going to make my own record." [...] In late 2001, Auf der Maur discovered [...] "old demos" [...] in her Montréal residence and [...] "realized [...] had an entire album's worth of material that had been sitting there for years." [...] Among the demos was [...] "Real a Lie", a song written with frequent collaborator Steve Durand, that was released as a single by the duo's former band Tinker in 1994. Auf der Maur said that the decision to record an album [...] "happened very naturally." ...|$|E

50|$|Vaibhav is a Delhi boy {{who started}} {{building}} tables {{in his basement}} before he <b>even</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> {{the definition of the}} maker movement was. A few of the problems he encountered while build the table was that he had to spend more on tools than materials and found himself with no one to turn to when faced with a glitch. Maker’s Asylum, Delhi, was born to ensure this doesn’t happen to anyone else. The enthusiastic community in the capital is a 2000 sqft haven for makers.|$|R
5000|$|For many years, he {{performed}} with Hirini Melbourne (1949-2003), playing traditional Māori instruments. Together, they researched these instruments, {{which had not}} been played for over a century, as their use went out of tradition in the 1900s. For many of the instruments, which were still on display in museums, it wasn't <b>even</b> <b>known</b> <b>what</b> technique was used to play them. They are credited with reviving this part of Māori culture. [...] Since Melbourne's death, he {{is regarded as the}} world's foremost authority on Māori instruments.|$|R
5000|$|I {{tried to}} write that song for a year, and couldn't. I went to write it at the studio and passed out. I woke up two hours later and sat down and wrote the whole end of the song, like, just {{off the top of}} my head. It was like, don't <b>even</b> <b>know</b> <b>what's</b> coming out, man, but it's coming. I think one of the best things that I've ever written was maybe the end segment of the song [...] "Coma".
