30|$|We {{assume that}} the {{attacker}} is fully aware of our proposed protocol. We {{assume that the}} jammer node also has the same performance as a usual node, and the jammer cannot jam all channels at the same time. We consider a reactive jammer model in this paper. In more detail, the attacker first attempts to guess the channel number of the AP according to the formula of our proposed protocol, i.e., Eq. (3). If there is a hit on the channel number, then the attacker launches a jamming attack. Otherwise, the attacker scans the <b>busy</b> <b>channel</b> and launches a jamming attack on the detected <b>busy</b> <b>channel</b> until the AP leaves the channel. If the AP changes channels, then the attacker repeats the same attack pattern of channel guessing, scanning, and jamming. The attacker uses a MAC layer jamming attack method.|$|R

They defined fuzzy cases that determine how much buffer is occupied and how many packets are rejected. In [29], the fuzzy logic system provides high throughput under low latency. It aggregates packets in the buffer at <b>busy</b> <b>channel,</b> and buffer delay is distributed among nodes resulting in high performance for voice transmissions.

40|$|Distributed {{transmission}} rate tuning {{is important for}} a wide variety of IEEE 802. 15. 4 network applications such as industrial network control systems. Such systems often require each node to sustain certain throughput demand in order to guarantee the system performance. It is thus essential to determine a proper {{transmission rate}} that can meet the application requirement and compensate for network imperfections (e. g., packet loss). Such a tuning in a heterogeneous network is difficult due to the lack of modeling techniques that can deal with the heterogeneity of the network as well as the network traffic changes. In this paper, a distributed transmission rate tuning algorithm in a heterogeneous IEEE 802. 15. 4 CSMA/CA network is proposed. Each node uses the results of clear channel assessment (CCA) to estimate the <b>busy</b> <b>channel</b> probability. Then a mathematical framework is developed to estimate the on-going heterogeneous traffics using the <b>busy</b> <b>channel</b> probability at runtime. Finally a distributed algorithm is derived to tune the transmission rate of each node to accurately meet the throughput requirement. The algorithm does not require modifications on IEEE 802. 15. 4 MAC layer and it has been experimentally implemented and extensively tested using TelosB nodes with the TinyOS protocol stack. The results reveal that the algorithm is accurate and can satisfy the throughput demand. Compared with existing techniques, the algorithm is fully distributed and thus does not require any central coordination. With this property, it is able to adapt to traffic changes and re-adjust the transmission rate to the desired level, which cannot be achieved using the traditional modeling techniques...|$|R
