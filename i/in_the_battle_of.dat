5|$|After {{recovering}} surprisingly fast {{from the}} sack of Rome, the Romans immediately resumed their expansion within Italy. The First Samnite War from 343 BC to 341 BC was relatively short: the Romans defeated the Samnites in two battles, but {{were forced to}} withdraw before they could pursue the conflict further due to the revolt of several of their Latin allies in the Latin War. Rome defeated the Latins <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Battle</b> <b>of</b> Vesuvius and again <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Battle</b> <b>of</b> Trifanum, after which the Latin cities were obliged to submit to Roman rule.|$|E

5|$|Initially, Rome's {{immediate}} neighbours {{were either}} Latin {{towns and villages}} on a tribal system {{similar to that of}} Rome, or else tribal Sabines from the Apennine hills beyond. One by one, Rome defeated both the persistent Sabines and the local cities that were either under Etruscan control or else Latin towns that had cast off their Etruscan rulers, as had Rome. Rome defeated the Lavinii and Tusculi <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Battle</b> <b>of</b> Lake Regillus in 496 BC, were defeated by the Veientes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Battle</b> <b>of</b> the Cremera in 477 BC, the Sabines in an unnamed battle in 449 BC, the Aequi <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Battle</b> <b>of</b> Mons Algidus in 458 BC and the Battle of Corbione in 446 BC, the Volsci <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Battle</b> <b>of</b> Corbione in 446 BC the Aurunci <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Battle</b> <b>of</b> Aricia, the Capture of Fidenae in 435 BC and the Siege of Veii in 396 BC, and the Capture of Antium in 377 BC.

5|$|Overall, Europeans formed {{only about}} {{a tenth of the}} royalist armies in Spanish America, and only about half of the expeditionary units, once they were {{deployed}} in the Americas. Since each European soldier casualty was replaced by a Spanish American soldier, over time, there were more and more Spanish American soldiers in the expeditionary units. For example, Pablo Morillo, {{commander in chief of the}} expeditionary force sent to South America, reported that he had only 2,000 European soldiers under his command in 1820; in other words, only half the soldiers of his expeditionary force were European. It is estimated that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Battle</b> <b>of</b> Maipú only a quarter of the royalist forces were European soldiers, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Battle</b> <b>of</b> Carabobo about a fifth, and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Battle</b> <b>of</b> Ayacucho less than 1% was European.|$|E

5|$|Rome was {{therefore}} forced to contend by around 340 BC against both Samnite incursions into their territory and, simultaneously, {{in a bitter}} war against their former allies.
