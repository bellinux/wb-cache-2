50|$|HDLC frames can be {{transmitted}} over synchronous or asynchronous serial communication links. Those links have no mechanism to mark the beginning or <b>end</b> <b>of</b> a <b>frame,</b> so the beginning and <b>end</b> <b>of</b> each <b>frame</b> has to be identified. This is done by using a frame delimiter, or flag, which is a unique sequence of bits that is guaranteed {{not to be seen}} inside a frame. This sequence is '01111110', or, in hexadecimal notation, 0x7E. Each frame begins and ends with a frame delimiter. A frame delimiter at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> a <b>frame</b> may also mark the start <b>of</b> the next <b>frame.</b> A sequence <b>of</b> 7 or more consecutive 1-bits within a frame will cause the frame to be aborted.|$|R

5000|$|In SDLC the {{transmitted}} bit sequence [...] "01111110" [...] containing six adjacent 1 bits is the Flag byte.

50|$|For a Type III Communications Scanner cycle steal {{processing}} {{of a single}} character was fairly inexpensive - a single storage cycle was required. This would give a theoretical limit of a million cps (eighty 9.6 kbit/s half-duplex lines). In practice the limit was probably lower as some processing would be required for <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>frame.</b> Also if the frame contents were moved about in storage this would require 3.5 storage cycles per byte.|$|E
50|$|All {{fields in}} the frame are stuffed with the {{exception}} of the CRC delimiter, ACK field and <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>frame</b> which are a fixed size and are not stuffed. In the fields where bit stuffing is used, six consecutive bits of the same type (111111 or 000000) are considered an error. An active error flag can be transmitted by a node when an error has been detected. The active error flag consists of six consecutive dominant bits and violates the rule of bit stuffing.|$|E

30|$|Even {{though in}} {{literature}} {{it is sometimes}} assumed that CAN provides an atomic broadcast, {{this is not the}} case. If the last but one bit of the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>frame</b> (EOF) delimiter is affected by an asymmetric bit flip, the nodes on the bus can be split in two sets, one accepting the message, and one not. In this case the sender retransmits the message, which leads to a duplication of that message in the set of nodes that previously accepted the message [4, 14]. A subsequent crash failure can lead to an inconsistent message omission.|$|E

To communicate with any device must and should {{there is a}} need of protocol either it may be serial communication or parallel communication. This paper discuss about the serial communication protocol which is serial front panel data protocol (SFPDP). The design should be modeled using VHDL language. In the paper the transmitter and the receiver should be designed using finite state machines. The frame format of the design contains IDLE,START OF FRAME, DATA, FIRST END OF FRAME,SECOND <b>END</b> <b>OF</b> <b>FRAME</b> and GO STOP states. Based on this frame format fields the FSM should be designed. Each Frame is recognized by a specified 32 bit hexadecimal pattern.

This is an oversimplification, and in reality, a mux-control-FSM in conjunction with seven other 2 -to- 1 muxes are used to accomplish this task. The FSM also helps to perform another mandatory task of framing the data for SATA protocol writes. The SATA controller writes to disk in single sector segments of 512 -bytes per sector. The 28 -bytes of data produced by the accelerator at each cycle cannot be evenly packed into 512 -byte frames. Every 18 cycles of accelerator operation, will only produce 504 -bytes of data that must be packed into a 512 -byte frame. The FSM packages the payload data with 4 -bytes of Start of Frame and <b>End</b> <b>of</b> <b>Frame</b> encoding, such that a single frame can be successfully detected, and stripped of its payload data, during the return backward path of data flow.|$|E

Pixel data bytes are available for sampling at the DOUT(0 [*]:[*] 7) bus at the positive edge of the DCLK signal. The EXTCLK is the clock input for the image sensor. The frequency of DCLK is half or quarter of the frequency of EXTCLK depending on {{the configuration of the}} image sensor. The initialization and configuration of the image sensor is done by the 2 -wire (SCL and SDA) I 2 C protocol. In the context of image sensor, it is often called as Serial Camera Control Bus (SCCB) interface [32]. The frame size, colour, sleep mode, and wake up mode can be controlled by sending I 2 C commands to the image sensor. The RESET is an active low reset signal for the image sensor. Some image sensors have a pin (PWDN) to control the active-sleep mode. Some HD image sensors may contain additional control pins (as shown as dotted line in Figure 2), which are used in special modes; however, these extra pins may be tied to VDD or GND or left unconnected in normal operation.|$|E

40|$|Abstract This {{reference}} system demonstrates improving system {{performance in the}} PowerPC ® 440 Processor Block on the Virtex ®- 5 FXT FPGA. In this {{reference system}} optimizing performance for embedded DMA solutions is discussed. The XPS Central DMA master interface can {{be connected to the}} Processor Local Bus (PLB) v 4. 6 on either PLB Slave 0 (SPLB 0) or PLB Slave 1 (SPLB 1). Parameters for the XPS Central DMA are modified for the DMA engine to allow for parallel reads and writes through the crossbar. For HDMA, setting threshold values for interrupts and changing addresses in main memory for Buffer Descriptors (BD) and transmit/receive buffers is discussed. A simple loopback core is connected to the LocalLink interface on one HDMA. In addition, performance cores for PLB v. 4. 6 master interfaces and HDMA are included in the system to measure system performance before and after system optimizations. Two stand-alone software applications are included to demonstrate DMA transactions for XPS Central DMA and HDMA to DDR 2. In addition, during these DMA transactions, the performance is measured between certain conditions. For XPS Central DMA, the performance is measured between PLB_PaValid and when the XPS Central DMA provides an interrupt (DMA transactions are complete). For HDMA, the Tx and Rx channels are measured between the first frame’s start of frame (SOF) and the last frame’s <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>frame</b> (EOF). This application note describes how to obtain latency numbers across the crossbar, obtain performance numbers before optimizing the system/software applications, optimizing the system/software application for performance and obtaining performance numbers with the optimized system.
