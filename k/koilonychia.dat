40|$|Summary: We {{hypothesize that}} nails have an {{automatic}} curvature feature {{and that their}} flat shape is maintained by the daily upward mechanical forces from the finger/toe pad. Thus, nail deformities, such as pincer nail, spoon nail, and <b>koilonychias,</b> {{may be caused by}} an imbalance between these forces and can be treated by controlling these forces. Here, we report the case of a 55 -year-old man whose severe pincer nail was effectively treated by thinning the nail, which reduced the automatic curvature force. This is the first report to show that pincer nail can be treated by a nonsurgical method that reduces the automatic curvature force, thus obviating the need for surgery. This supports the notion that mechanical stimulus–based treatments have high therapeutic potential for nail deformities...|$|R
40|$|Epirubicin-cyclophosphamide (EC) and fluorouracil-epirubicin-cyclophosphamide (FEC), 2 epirubicin-based regimens,are often {{switched}} to docetaxel (DOC) in chemotherapy {{before and after}} breast surgery. As nail discoloration had been frequently observed during these breast cancer chemotherapy regimens,we investigated adverse drug events in nails. Drug adverse events were observed in the nails of 87 % of patients treated with EC,in 83 % treated with FEC,and 58 % treated with DOC following the switch from EC or FEC. With regard {{to the time of}} onset,most nail discoloration appeared after second or third course of chemotherapy with EC or FEC. Adverse drug events differed depending on the chemotherapy regimen. Nail discoloration was nearly all specific to EC and FEC and nail bed pain,onycholysis,and <b>koilonychias</b> tended to occur with DOC. Though most adverse drug events in the nails were mild,any of Grade 2 (CTCAE v 3. 0) occurring would have impaired quality of life and caused psychological stress. Therefore,pharmacists should inform patients receiving these chemotherapies of the possibility of adverse drug events in the nails and observe them carefully. They should also recommend consultation with a dermatologist as early as possible if Grade 2 adverse drug events should occur...|$|R

In India, whole of Ladakh region, part of Northwest Kashmir, Northern part of Sikkim and Tenga valley of Arunachal are considered inhabited areas of HAA. The low quantity of oxygen, high exposure of ultraviolet (UV) light, very low humidity, extreme subzero temperature in winter, high wind velocity, make this region difficult for lowlanders {{as well as for}} tourists.

40|$|Summary: Mechanobiology is an {{emerging}} {{field of science}} {{that focuses on the}} way physical forces and changes in cell or tissue mechanics contribute to development, physiology, and disease. As nails are always exposed to physical stimulation, mechanical forces may have a particularly pronounced effect on nail configuration and could be involved in the development of nail deformities. However, the role of mechanobiology in nail configuration and deformities has rarely been assessed. This review describes what is currently understood regarding the effect of mechanical force on nail configuration and deformities. On the basis of these observations, we hypothesize that nails have an automatic curvature function that allows them to adapt to the daily upward mechanical forces. Under normal conditions, the upward daily mechanical force and the automatic curvature force are well balanced. However, an imbalance between these 2 forces may cause nail deformation. For example, pincer nails may be caused by the absence of upward mechanical forces or a genetic propensity increase in the automatic curvature force, whereas <b>koilonychias</b> may occur when the upward mechanical force exceeds the automatic curvature force, thereby causing the nail to curve outward. This hypothesis is a new concept that could aid the development of innovative methods to prevent and treat nail deformities...|$|R

50|$|Several {{different}} {{nutritional deficiency}} states of vitamins or minerals {{have been linked}} to AC. It is thought that in about 25% of people with AC, iron deficiency or deficiency of B vitamins are involved. Nutritional deficiencies may be a more common cause of AC in third world countries. Chronic iron deficiency may also cause <b>koilonychia</b> (spoon shaped deformity of the fingernails) and glossitis (inflammation of the tongue). It is not completely understood how iron deficiency causes AC, but it is known that it causes a degree of immunocompromise (decreased efficiency of the immune system) which may in turn allow an opportunistic infection of candida. Vitamin B2 deficiency (ariboflavinosis) may also cause AC, and other conditions such as redness of mucous membranes, magenta colored glossitis (pink inflammation of the tongue). Vitamin B5 deficiency may also cause AC, along with glossitis, and skin changes similar to seborrhoeic dermatitis around the eyes, nose and mouth. Vitamin B12 deficiency is sometimes responsible for AC, and commonly occurs together with folate deficiency (a lack of folic acid), which also causes glossitis and megaloblastic anemia. Vitamin B3 deficiency (pellagra) is another possible cause, and in which other association conditions such as dermatitis, diarrhea, dementia and glossitis can occur. Biotin (vitamin B7) deficiency has also been reported to cause AC, along with alopecia (hair loss) and dry eyes. Zinc deficiency is known to cause AC. Other symptoms may include diarrhea, alopecia and dermatitis. Acrodermatitis enteropathica is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder causing impaired absorption of zinc, and is associated with AC.|$|E
50|$|Anemia goes undetected in {{many people}} and {{symptoms}} can be minor. The symptoms {{can be related to}} an underlying cause or the anemia itself.Most commonly, people with anemia report feelings of weakness or tired, and sometimes poor concentration. They may also report shortness of breath on exertion. In very severe anemia, the body may compensate for the lack of oxygen-carrying capability of the blood by increasing cardiac output. The patient may have symptoms related to this, such as palpitations, angina (if pre-existing heart disease is present), intermittent claudication of the legs, and symptoms of heart failure.On examination, the signs exhibited may include pallor (pale skin, lining mucosa, conjunctiva and nail beds), {{but this is not a}} reliable sign. There may be signs of specific causes of anemia, e.g., <b>koilonychia</b> (in iron deficiency), jaundice (when anemia results from abnormal break down of red blood cells — in hemolytic anemia), bone deformities (found in thalassemia major) or leg ulcers (seen in sickle-cell disease).In severe anemia, there may be signs of a hyperdynamic circulation: tachycardia (a fast heart rate), bounding pulse, flow murmurs, and cardiac ventricular hypertrophy (enlargement). There may be signs of heart failure.Pica, the consumption of non-food items such as ice, but also paper, wax, or grass, and even hair or dirt, may be a symptom of iron deficiency, although it occurs often in those who have normal levels of hemoglobin.Chronic anemia may result in behavioral disturbances in children as a direct result of impaired neurological development in infants, and reduced academic performance in children of school age. Restless legs syndrome is more common in those with iron-deficiency anemia.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Alcohol {{consumption}} {{can have}} a variety of cutaneous manifestations. Awareness of the cutaneous changes of alcohol abuse can allow early detection and intervention in an attempt to limit the adverse medical consequences. Hence a study was planned to determine the cutaneous changes in chronic alcoholics. AIMS: To determine the cutaneous changes in chronic alcoholics. METHODS: All the patients attending alcohol de-addiction camps were examined for cutaneous changes. The results were analyzed using Gausian test and compared with other reports. RESULTS: Out of 200 alcoholics examined for cutaneous changes, 182 (91 &#x 0025;) had cutaneous, nail, hair or oral cavity changes. Nail changes were found in 51 (25. 5 &#x 0025;) alcoholics, <b>koilonychia</b> being the commonest (16 &#x 0025;). Oral changes were present in 107 (53. 5 &#x 0025;) alcoholics and changes due to nutritional deficiency in 20 (10 &#x 0025;).

The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the prevalence of dermatological changes among patients with end-stage renal disease under hemodialysis in a hemodialysis unit in Tanta University hospitals over a period of 6 months, and to evaluate the relations of these dermatological disorders with the duration of hemodialysis as well as with different laboratory parameters in these patients. Patients and methods: Ninety-three patients with end-stage renal disease on regular hemodialysis (56 males and 37 females) were selected and included in this cross-sectional, descriptive, analytic study. Their ages ranged from 18 – 80 years. All patients underwent thorough general and dermatological examinations. Laboratory investigations (complete blood counts, renal and liver function tests, serum parathormone levels, serum electrolytes, alkaline phosphatase, random blood sugar, and Hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibodies) were evaluated. Results: This study revealed that most patients had nonspecific skin changes, including xerosis, pruritus, pallor, ecchymosis, hyperpigmentation, and follicular hyperkeratosis. Nail and hair changes were commonly found, especially half and half nail, <b>koilonychia,</b> subungal hyperkeratosis, melanonychia, onychomycosis, and brittle and lusterless hair. Mucous membrane changes detected were pallor, xerostomia, macroglossia, bleeding gums, aphthous stomatitis, and yellow sclera.

40|$|Summary The {{effect of}} iron {{deficiency}} on oral carcinogenesis {{was investigated in}} 30 young adult male Charles River white rats. In 15 animals, {{prior to the start}} of carcinogen treatment, iron deficiency anaemia was produced and subsequently maintained by a combination of low iron diet (12 mgFe 2 + kg-I diet) and repeated venesection. Fifteen control animals were fed the same diet supplemented with iron to approximately 140 mg Fe 2 + kg- 1 diet. All animals were treated with the carcinogen 0. 5 % 4 -Nitroquinoline-N-oxide in propylene glycol which was painted on the palate 3 times weekly. Animals were killed when tumours were grossly evident. The mean haemoglobin levels at the start of carcinogen applications were 10. 1 g dl- in the anaemic group and 14. 1 g dl 1 in the control group, and at the time of killing were 8. 2 g dl- ' in anaemic animals and 13. 8 gdl- 1 in controls. The incidence of animals developing squamous cell carcinomas was similar in both groups, but tumour development was significantly earlier in iron-deficient animals (mean 183 days) compared to controls (mean 229 days). Iron-deficient animals showed a significantly greater incidence of tongue tumours and control animals showed a significantly greater incidence of palatal tumours. Although deficiency of iron is not associated with as high a morbidity as many other deficiency diseases it is probably the most common single nutritional deficiency found in both developing and advanced countries (Beaton, 1974; WHO, 1972). In common with other nutritional deficiencies, iron deficiency causes widespread and diverse tissue changes. Of the extra-haemopoietic manifestations of iron deficiency, the epithelial abnormalities are perhaps the best known. Iron deficiency has been reported as causing epithelial atrophy, <b>koilonychia,</b> glossitis and dysphagia. Brown-Kelly (1919) and Paterson (1919) were the first to report the association between iron deficiency anaemia and post-cricoid carcinoma.

40|$|Background: Schoolchildren are {{vulnerable}} to anaemia because of their higher iron need {{to meet the demands}} of puberty and adolescence. Objective: The survey determined the haemoglobin levels of schoolchildren aged 6 – 15 years and the factors affecting their haemoglobin status. Design: Data were obtained through a cross sectional survey of 450 randomly selected schoolchildren in Ede-Oballa, Nsukka, Enugu State, Nigeria. Ninety were selected for clinical examination, biochemical tests, and nutrient intake study. Haemoglobin, malaria, and stool analysis were carried out by the cyanmethaemoglobin, thin blood film, and wet mount direct methods, respectively. Iron intake was determined by a three-day weighed food intake. Results: Results showed that the schoolchildren had pallor (35. 6 %), brittle hair (31. 1 %), <b>koilonychia</b> (2. 2 %), oedema (4. 4 %) and sore/smooth tongue (7. 8 %). The children also had malaria (58. 9 %) and Entamoeba histolytica (42. 2 %), hookworm (36. 7 %), tapeworm (35. 6 %), whipworm (34. 5 %), and roundworm (27. 9 %) infestations. Iron intake was inadequate (< 100 % of recommended nutrient intake) for most of the children. The mean haemoglobin levels of the schoolchildren were low. The 6 – 9, 10 – 12, and 13 – 15 year olds had 9. 0, 9. 1, and 9. 3 g/dl, respectively. Most (85. 5 %) of them had anaemia. Moderate anaemia was prevalent in 62. 2 %. Severe anaemia affected the 6 – 9 year olds more. Malaria (P< 0. 001), Entamoeba histolytica (P< 0. 01), hookworm (P< 0. 05), tapeworm (P< 0. 01), and whipworm (P< 0. 001) caused significant reduction in haemoglobin level. Age (b= 1. 284, P< 0. 05), birth order (b=− 0. 629, P< 0. 01), frequency of illness attack (b=− 1. 372, P< 0. 01), household size (b=− 0. 526, P< 0. 05), and frequency of skipping breakfast (b=− 1. 542, P< 0. 001) were factors that influenced the haemoglobin status of the children. Conclusion: The schoolchildren had poor iron status as a result of consumption of plant sources of iron with low bioavailability, parasitic infections, birth order, skipping of breakfast, large household size, and frequent bouts of illnesses...|$|E
