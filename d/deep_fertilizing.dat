40|$|Background: Fertilization is an {{important}} process of rice production, which directly affects the yield of crops. The mechanization level of rice fertilization is very low at present in China, and the artificial fertilization requires {{a large amount of}} fertilizer which caused the uneven distribution. The rice side <b>deep</b> <b>fertilizing</b> is an ideal way of fertilization, the way apply the granular fertilizer to the side of rice seedlings with a certain depth, the way can reduce nitrogen fertilizer amount of 20 %- 30 % compared with the traditional fertilizing operation. The side <b>deep</b> <b>fertilizing</b> technique has been applied by the side deep fertilization device installed in the rice transplanter. The working way of the most existing equipment is the mechanical transmission mode and complex in installation, it can't achieve precision control of the fertilization amount. Methods: The study design the precision fertilization control system in order to achieve the requirements of the side deep precision fertilization operation. Its working principle is motor driven fertilizer and fertilization amount was adjusted according to the change of the rice transplanter's speed obtained by GPS. The fertilizing control software was designed use eMbeddedVisuaiC++ integrated development environment Results: The study has tested the fertilization working performance of the control system in static condition. The coefficient of variation of each row fertilizer quantity is 2. 3 %, 2. 1 %, 2. 2 %, 1. 8 % in the speed of 10 r/min, 20 r/min, 30 r/min, 40 r/min. Discussions: The result shows fertilizer amount consistency is good and relatively constant, fertilizer variation coefficient of each row is small at the same speed, average fertilizer amount increases linearly with the increasing of the rotation speed. Conclusion: The control system was developed for side deep precision fertilization operation and it can meet the requirements of precision fertilization of the side deep fertilization device...|$|E
40|$|By {{method of}} {{employing}} root growth plastic tubes. buckwheat was seeded and sampleS were observed during different growing stages for studying root system growth. Root length and dry weight. vertical distribution of root systems within different soil layers were all recorded and mathematical {{models of the}} main structures of root were developed. Effects of root system on the growth of plant were studied with treatment of root cutting. Results showed that the contribution of root system to plant biom ~ production and yield during flowering stage is larger than that during budding stage. The inducing effects of <b>deep</b> <b>fertilizing</b> to root growth were studied also. All the results stated above contribute the basis for buckwheat high yield planting and the coordination {{of the growth of}} root-soil and root-seedling systems. Key words: buckwheat, root system. growth Root system is the absorbing and anchoring organ of plant above ground. The growth of the vegetative organs and the development of reproductive organs are all directly effected by the growth of root system. Evidently, it is quite necessary to study the status of root growth thoroughly. However, the research work of root system is much more difficult than that of plant parts above ground. As...|$|E
40|$|Growth and {{yield of}} early-summer sowed sugar beets are {{affected}} by kinds and combinations of fertilizers and methods of fertilization as follows: - 1) When some amount of super-phosphate of lime {{was applied to the}} crops on the different places, no influence was found on the growth and the yield. 2) Deep placement of fertilizer helped the growth more than row application of fertilizer, not only at the time of but also on the early stage of the crop growth.. (significant at 1 ～ 5 % level) 3) Heavier crops both in top and root harvests in the row fertilized plots were more produced than in the <b>deep</b> <b>fertilized</b> plots, but the number was less in the former plots than in the latter plots. (significant at 1 % level respectively) 4) The Brix values of root were not varied either by the kinds and combination of fertilizers, or by the methods of fertilization. 5) The differences of the growth and yield between the plots of compound fertilizer and the plots of mixed fertilizer were hardly observed, however, in general, the former was slightly better than latter. 6) T-R ratio of crops in the <b>deep</b> <b>fertilized</b> plots was smaller than 1. 0 and that in the row fertilized plots was larger than 1. 0. 7) Branched roots were more numerous in the <b>deep</b> <b>fertilized</b> plots than in the row-fertilized plots.

50|$|Many Echeveria {{species are}} popular as {{ornamental}} garden plants. They are drought-resistant, {{although they do}} better with regular <b>deep</b> watering and <b>fertilizing.</b> Most will tolerate shade and some frost, although hybrids {{tend to be less}} tolerant. Most lose their lower leaves in winter; as a result, after a few years, the plants lose their attractive, compact appearance and need to be re-rooted or propagated. In addition, if not removed, the shed leaves may decay, harboring fungus that can then infect the plant.|$|R
40|$|In {{the years}} since the Industrial Revolution, {{atmospheric}} carbon dioxide levels have steadily risen, causing an associated increase in global warming. In an attempt to remedy some of the effects caused by global warming, various geoengineering schemes have been put forth as possible solutions in resolving the global warming problem. A large portion of these geoengineering solutions are categorized as carbon sequestration techniques, where the geoengineering schemes vary from injecting liquefied carbon dioxide into the <b>deep</b> ocean or <b>fertilizing</b> the oceans with iron to stimulate phytoplankton growth. The focus of this proposal is on carbon sequestration via biochar burial. Biochar is a form of carbon produced via pyrolysis, or combustion with no oxygen or very little oxygen. The pyrolysis process produces a high-density form of carbon, which can be used to sequester carbon through underground burial. A practical implementation of carbon sequestration via biochar would be to convert decaying plant matter into biochar, rather than to allow natural decay from occurring, which releases carbon contained in the biomass back into the atmosphere. However, being an extremely new geoengineering method, biochar still needs t...|$|R
40|$|We use an Earth {{system model}} of {{intermediate}} complexity, CLIMBER- 2, to investigate what recent {{improvements in the}} representation of the physics and biology of the glacial ocean imply for the atmospheric concentration. The coupled atmosphere-ocean model under the glacial boundary conditions is able to reproduce the deep, salty, stagnant water mass inferred from Antarctic deep pore water data and the changing temperature of the entire deep ocean. When carbonate compensation is included in the model, we find a CO 2 drawdown of 43 ppmv associated mainly with the shoaling of the Atlantic thermohaline circulation and an increased fraction of water masses of southern origin in the <b>deep</b> Atlantic. <b>Fertilizing</b> the Atlantic and Indian sectors of the Southern Ocean north of the polar front leads to a further drawdown of 37 ppmv. Other changes to the glacial carbon cycle include a decrease in the amount of carbon stored in the terrestrial biosphere (540 Pg C), which increases atmospheric CO 2 by 15 ppmv, and a change in ocean salinity resulting from a drop in sea level, which elevates CO 2 by another 12 ppmv. A decrease in shallow water CaCO 3 deposition draws down CO 2 by 12 ppmv. In total, the model is able to explain more than two thirds (65 ppmv) of the glacial to interglacial CO 2 change, based only on mechanisms that are clearly documented in the proxy data. A good match between simulated and reconstructed distribution of delta C- 13 changes in the deep Atlantic suggests that the model captures the mechanisms of reorganization of biogeochemistry in the Atlantic Ocean reasonably well. Additional, poorly constrained mechanisms to explain the rest of the observed drawdown include changes in the organic carbon: CaCO 3 ratio of sediment rain reaching the seafloor, iron fertilization in the subantarctic Pacific Ocean, and changes in terrestrial weathering...|$|R
40|$|Currently rising CO 2 {{levels in}} {{atmosphere}} and marine surface waters {{as well as}} projected scenarios of CO 2 disposal in the ocean emphasize that CO 2 sensitivities need to be investigated in aquatic organisms, especially the most sensitive, animals. Moreover, to understand causes and effects, we need to identify the physiological processes sensitive to CO 2 in animals. While the number of animals acutely sensitive to moderate CO 2 increments may be small, long-term effects may have already begun {{in a wide range}} of species and these could drive shifts in ecological equilibria. Such effects not only include a disturbance in calcification. Recent studies of invertebrate fauna pre-adapted to oscillating CO 2 levels in their habitat revealed a depression of metabolic rate associated with a reduction in ion exchange and protein synthesis rates as well as a shift in metabolic equilibria, resulting in a slowing of growth. Enhanced mortality has also been observed under long-term moderate hypercapnia with as yet unidentified cause and effect relationships. In a climate change scenario, simultaneous changes in temperature, CO 2, and hypoxia levels would enhance sensitivity to environmental extremes relative to a change in only one of these variables. Some of these interactions are elicited through effects on the same physiological mechanisms, and need to be considered in estimating effects of atmospheric CO 2 entry into the ocean. They also need to be considered in currently discussed mitigation scenarios such as direct injection of CO 2 in the <b>deep</b> ocean or <b>fertilizing</b> the surface ocean with Fe, which reduces subsurface O 2 contents. With changing CO 2 levels, ecosystem shifts may develop progressively rather than beyond specific thresholds such that effects parallel CO 2 oscillations. It is presently unclear, to what extent and how quickly species may adapt to permanently elevated CO 2 levels by micro-evolutionary compensatory processes...|$|R
40|$|To {{improve the}} {{understanding}} of population dynamics of organisms, {{it is necessary to}} examine organisms under natural conditions. Only at such conditions, knowledge about their in situ use of resources, predator-prey interactions and loss rates can be obtained. It is possible to examine and understand these processes with controlled ocean iron fertilization experiments, which stimulate the growth of unicellular algae. This thesis provides a comprehensive description of the reactions and vertical distribution of the main components of the pelagic ecosystem and highlights the food-web interactions of individual organisms, which characterize this habitat. The response of the plankton community to iron addition was successfully observed during the Indo-German iron fertilisation experiment LOHAFEX (LOHA is hindi and means iron, FEX stands for fertilisation experiment) carried out in the Southern Ocean from January to March in 2009 lasting for 38 days. The iron-induced bloom was achieved in the closed core of a mesoscale eddy. The aim of the experiment was to study the growth and demise of the phytoplankton bloom and to examine whether the biomass is retained in the surface layers through recycling processes or whether biomass sinks out to the <b>deep</b> ocean. The <b>fertilized</b> patch was characterized by low silicic acid concentrations, which is an essential nutrient for diatoms, hence a flagellate-bloom developed with cells < 20 µm in size. The bloom remained stable {{over the course of the}} experiment. This was verified by microscopic analysis and molecular methods. The main reason for the lack of large scale biomass increase, was the strong grazing pressure by the large copepod population, consisting primarily of Calanus simillimus and Oithona similis. Incubation experiments proved that copepods increased their grazing rates and fecal pellet production within the patch. Neutrally buoyant PELAGRA traps were deployed to quantify the export fluxes. These contained a few diatoms and fecal pellets and were dominated by unicellular plankton like dinoflagellates, flagellates and coccoid cells. Hence fertilizing this type of plankton community did not increase the vertical flux. This lead to the hypothesis that the system was influenced by recycling processes in surface layers. The protozoan community and its vertical distribution was an important part of this work and was studied by focussing on key heterotrophic organisms. These included thekate dinoflagellates, loricate and aloricate ciliates, foraminifera, radiolarians, and juvenile and adult copepods. Again, the high grazing pressure by the copepods controlled the development of the protozoan community, and the copepod fecal pellets contained large amounts of damaged and empty loricae, but also foraminifera, which are usually not a preferred food item for copepods. This indicated that the copepods were food limited and resorted to large, armoured protozoans which they might have otherwise avoided. Dinoflagellates were mainly abundant at depths below 100 m, possibly this distribution pattern was caused by an escape response in order to avoid predators and to feed on the flux of larger particles which generally peaks at those depths. In conclusion, the plankton community during LOHAFEX was top-down controlled whereby a highly efficient retention type system prevailed, which resulted in low particle export fluxe...|$|R
