The service {{differentiation}} is modeled {{according to the}} guaranteed QoS level for each class. This model assumes that a user selects an appropriate class of service depending on his QoS requirements. The users access to the service is assumed as bursty traffic, and all the users are competing on one shared bandwidth. The equivalent <b>guaranteed</b> <b>capacity</b> of a class is calculated according to its guaranteed QoS level. A fixed price is given for each class for certain <b>guaranteed</b> <b>capacity.</b> Then, an analysis for the service provider to achieve maximum value of revenues is made by determining the total required shared bandwidth, the service class optimum <b>guaranteed</b> <b>capacity</b> and its optimum price...|$|R

Capacity reduction has a higher impact on VNO BE (the best-effort operator) comparing to VNO’s GE and BG, since the network tries to meet these latter VNOs’ <b>guaranteed</b> <b>capacity</b> before serving the best-effort one. When there are 12 cells, VNO BE gets almost no data rate, but the other two VNOs still have a relatively acceptable data rate.

We focus on a realistic performance metric that considers reference signal (RS) transmission overhead.

We develop two efficient algorithms based on greedy search and linear programming relaxation combined with gradient ascent search, respectively. Our simulation results reveal that {{a larger number of}} antennas do not always <b>guarantee</b> <b>capacity</b> increase in real communication environments due to RS transmission overhead.

40|$|Networks {{that support}} {{multiple}} services through "linksharing " {{must address the}} fundamental conflicting requirement between isolation among service classes to satisfy each class' quality of service requirements, and statistical sharing of resources for efficient network utilization. While a number of service disciplines have been devised which provide mechanisms to both isolate flows and fairly share excess capacity, admission control algorithms are needed which exploit the effects of inter-class resource sharing. In this paper, we develop a framework of using statistical service envelopes to study inter-class statistical resource sharing. We show how this service envelope enables a class to over-book resources beyond its deterministically <b>guaranteed</b> <b>capacity</b> by statistically characterizing the excess service available due to fluctuating demands of other service classes.
