5|$|As the 1948 Arab-Israeli War commenced, the neighbourhood's {{location}} between <b>Israeli</b> <b>and</b> Jordanian forces made it {{a combat}} zone, leading to the flight of both Jewish and Arab residents. On May 22, 1948 the US Consul, Thomas C. Wasson, was assassinated shortly after leaving the French Consulate in the Mamilla district. After {{the signing of the}} 1949 Armistice Agreements and division of Jerusalem, the western three-quarters of Mamilla were held by Israel and the eastern quarter became a no man's land of barbed-wire and concrete barricades between <b>Israeli</b> <b>and</b> Jordanian lines. The active and hostile border subjected Mamilla to Jordanian sniper and guerilla attacks, and even stones thrown by Arab Legionnaires from the Old City walls above. The neighbourhood was one of several border areas in the city to experience a sharp decline, and subsequently became home to families of new immigrants with many children and of weak financial abilities, as well as dirty light industry like auto repair. In Mamilla in this period, the residents were primarily Kurdish immigrants and their Israeli children.|$|E

50|$|OneVoice {{was founded}} by {{entrepreneur}} Daniel Lubetzky {{in the spring of}} 2002 {{in the wake of the}} failure at the 2000 Camp David Summit and renewed violence between <b>Israelis</b> <b>and</b> Palestinians.

OneVoice was to be a forum for moderate <b>Israelis</b> <b>and</b> Palestinians to express themselves and their desires for peace through a negotiated two-state solution.|$|R
50|$|Polling {{data has}} {{produced}} mixed results regarding {{the level of}} support among Palestinians for the two-state solution.

The poll found that 58% of <b>Israelis</b> <b>and</b> 50% of Palestinians supported a two-state solution based on the Clinton Parameters, compared with 47% of <b>Israelis</b> <b>and</b> 39% of Palestinians in 2003, the first year the poll was carried out. The poll also found that an increasing percentage of both populations supported an end to violence—63% of Palestinians <b>and</b> 70% of <b>Israelis</b> expressing their support for an end to violence, an increase of 2% for <b>Israelis</b> <b>and</b> 5% for Palestinians from the previous year.|$|R

5|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th century, viruses {{were defined}} in terms of their infectivity, their ability to be filtered, and their {{requirement}} for living hosts. Viruses had been grown only in plants and animals. In 1906, Ross Granville Harrison invented a method for growing tissue in lymph, and, in 1913, E. Steinhardt, C. <b>Israeli,</b> <b>and</b> R. A. Lambert used this method to grow vaccinia virus in fragments of guinea pig corneal tissue. In 1928, H. B. Maitland and M. C. Maitland grew vaccinia virus in suspensions of minced hens' kidneys. Their method was not widely adopted until the 1950s, when poliovirus was grown on a large scale for vaccine production.|$|E
5|$|Overall, {{there are}} 126 {{speaking}} {{parts in the}} film. Thousands of extras were hired during filming. Spielberg cast <b>Israeli</b> <b>and</b> Polish actors specially chosen for their Eastern European appearance. Many of the German actors were reluctant to don the SS uniform, {{but some of them}} later thanked Spielberg for the cathartic experience of performing in the movie. Halfway through the shoot, Spielberg conceived the epilogue, where 128 survivors pay their respects at Schindler's grave in Jerusalem. The producers scrambled to find the Schindlerjuden and fly them in to film the scene.|$|E

Jamal al-Durrah and his 12-year-old son, Muhammad, were filmed by Talal Abu Rahma, a Palestinian cameraman freelancing for France 2, as they were caught in crossfire between <b>Israeli</b> <b>and</b> Palestinian security forces. The footage shows the pair crouching behind a concrete cylinder, the boy crying and the father waving, then a burst of gunfire and dust, after which the boy is seen slumped across his father's legs.|$|E

5|$|A {{report by}} {{human rights and}} {{development}} groups published in 2008 stated that Gaza had suffered a long term pattern of economic stagnation and dire development indicators, the severity which was increased exponentially by the <b>Israeli</b> <b>and</b> Egyptian blockades. The report cited a number of economic indicators to illustrate the point: In 2008, 95% of Gaza's industrial operations were suspended {{due to lack of}} access inputs for production and export problems. In 2009, unemployment in Gaza was close to 40%. The private sector which generates 53% of all jobs in Gaza was devastated and businesses went bankrupt. In June 2005, 3,900 factories in Gaza employed 35,000 people, by December 2007, only 1,700 were still employed. The construction industry was paralyzed {{with tens of thousands of}} laborers out of work. The agriculture sector was hard hit, affecting nearly 40,000 workers dependent on cash crops.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Mengele {{sightings}} {{were reported}} {{all over the}} world. Wiesenthal claimed to have information that placed Mengele on the Greek island of Kythnos in 1960, Cairo in 1961, in Spain in 1971, and in Paraguay in 1978, eighteen years after he had left. He insisted as late as 1985—six years after Mengele's death—that he was still alive, in 1982 offering a reward of $100,000 for his capture. Worldwide interest in the case was raised by a mock trial held in Jerusalem in February 1985 featuring the testimony of over a hundred victims of Mengele's experiments. Shortly afterwards, the governments of West Germany, Israel, and the United States launched a coordinated effort to determine Mengele's whereabouts. Rewards for his capture were offered by the <b>Israeli</b> <b>and</b> West German governments, The Washington Times, and the Simon Wiesenthal Center.|$|E
