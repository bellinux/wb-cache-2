30|$|With the {{introduction}} of lean production and logistics throughout recent years, {{we found that the}} number of logistics process variants has increased significantly from the previously dominating concepts of full truck load (FTL) and area forwarding (AF). For example, cross-docking processes have been introduced, as the inbound logistics’ reaction to decreased lot sizes and increasing <b>delivery</b> <b>frequencies,</b> to enable efficient transportation processes.

With an increased focus on the trade-off between stock reduction and higher <b>delivery</b> <b>frequencies,</b> the number of parts delivered by just-in-sequence processes is also rising. At all times, on-time parts availability at the assembly line is essential to ensure high manufacturing capacity utilisation.|$|R
30|$|The {{picture for}} {{bricks-and-mortar}} store distribution, however, is different. Most of the OC retailers use further regional DCs for store replenishment. This {{is due to}} the fact that most large OC retailers used to be pure bricks-and-mortar players, who have a high proportion of sales in physical stores, have developed mature forward distribution structures in this channel, and operate a significant number of stores. A central DC has lower store <b>delivery</b> <b>frequencies</b> on average to realize bundling effects for longer distances to the stores. However, as stores benefit from shorter replenishment cycles and higher <b>delivery</b> <b>frequencies</b> that enable faster reactions on demand development, OC retailers continue to rely on regional DC systems for their bricks-and-mortar business, as several experts interviewed claim. This enables shorter cost-efficient replenishment cycles for the major part of their store assortment. Regional DCs can be found in all sectors surveyed. In the DIY sector, regionalization is very prevalent, one reason being that a large proportion of the items sold at DIY stores are very space-consuming or have special storage requirements, which can be better managed with multiple storage locations (e.g., plants).|$|R

30|$|Concerning {{the case}} company, however, it is {{recognized}} as a representative SIC- 20 firm {{in terms of the}} customers served, its product portfolio, the shipment sizes and <b>delivery</b> <b>frequencies,</b> and the flow of materials. Generally, the studied case allows for a good representation of FMCG distribution in Germany because the analyzed shipment data include a great share of the German retailer locations; this allows for a nationwide observation of traffic conditions. In addition, the impact of traffic congestion has been observed for the cost-minimal 1 -, 2 -, 3 -, and 4 -DC configurations. Thus, in principle, four distinct network structures have been investigated. And, as has been demonstrated, the impact of traffic congestion did not differ a lot in relative values across the four networks. Moreover, the results for the delivery trips do not depend on the facility locations of the manufacturer, but on the positions of the TSPs and the retailers. Both are independent of the manufacturer and part of many supply chains [26].|$|R

30|$|This rather {{complicated}} institutional situation {{does not}} prevent the Ile-de-France Region from being a thriving place for logistics activities, making up {{more than a quarter}} of France’s total square metres of warehouses and logistics centres [15]. This illustrates a fundamental fact about goods movements in cities: it is the economic structure of a city that determines freight movements, much more than the institutional patterns or local policies [8]. Each of the (very numerous) economic sectors present in a large metropolitan area such as the Ile de France Region has its own logistics characteristics [23]. These characteristics in turn determine the types of vehicles and <b>delivery</b> <b>frequencies</b> that each sector needs. Before being delivered to (or sent out of) an urban area, a product will very likely pass through a warehouse, a parcel carrier terminal, or an intermodal yard, in short, a network node where goods will be transferred from one vehicle to another and are often stored, processed, or repackaged. 3 Thus, a vast band of logistics facilities surrounds cities, especially the largest ones.|$|R
40|$|We {{address in}} this paper a {{periodic}} petroleum station replenishment problem (PPSRP) that aims to plan the delivery of petroleum products {{to a set of}} geographically dispatched stations. It is assumed that each station is characterized by its weekly demand and by its frequency of service.

The problem configuration is described through a set of trucks with several compartments each and a set of stations with demands and prefixed <b>delivery</b> <b>frequencies.</b> Given such input data, the minimization of the total distance is subject to assignment and routing constraints that express the capacity limitations of each truck's compartment in terms of the frequency and the pathways' restrictions.

Our ultimate aim is to include such a model into an integrated framework having the objective of advising petroleum distribution companies on how to prepare bids in case of participation in combinatorial auctions of the transportation procurement...|$|R
40|$|The use of lean {{production}} principles is growing and companies are increasingly focusing on small and frequent deliveries. This is often achieved {{through use of}} tugger trains carrying several part numbers, each of a relatively small quantity. To achieve time efficiency, {{it is necessary to}} design the system properly in terms of delivery routes, delivery initiation principles, <b>delivery</b> <b>frequencies</b> and buffer sizes at receiving assembly stations. This can be a challenge, especially where a large number of part variants exist and consumption rate varies according to production sequence. Based on a case from automobile industry, this paper outlines two conceptual models for tugger train delivery routing; fixed routes and variable routes. The aim is to investigate the relative performance of these two models. Advantages of fixed routes include; ease of application as they simplify administrative tasks, also repeating the route can decrease the risk of making mistakes. Furthermore, service to customers is predictable and individual. Performance is concluded in terms of time efficiency of deliveries, and how this is affected by changes in product mix and production rate. Buffer sizes and utilisation of vehicles are important variables. The paper constitutes a foundation for future research, which could verify and quantify the results presented here...|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, {{we study}} {{the problem in}} which a {{distribution}} center delivers goods to a fixed set of customers periodically. Each customer has a specified <b>delivery</b> <b>frequency</b> (the number of deliveries over a T-day period). The deliveries to the same customer are required to be spaced as evenly as possible while the actual delivery days are flexible. We propose a routing then scheduling approach {{to solve the problem}} of minimizing the fleet size. In this approach, a routing problem for making one delivery to every customer is solved first. Then these routes are scheduled over the T days based on the <b>delivery</b> <b>frequency.</b> For the problem with the same <b>delivery</b> <b>frequency,</b> a simple and effective scheduling algorithm is developed and its performance is analysed theoretically. Then a modified scheduling algorithm is proposed to generate alternative feasible solutions with the same fleet size. This modified algorithm lays the foundation for the algorithm dealing with the problem with different delivery frequencies. For the problem with different delivery frequencies, the customers with the same <b>delivery</b> <b>frequency</b> are grouped first and the optimal routes are found for each group. An Integer programming model is then given to combine the schedules of all the groups. Finally heuristics are developed to solve the problem efficiently. Delivery days for different delivery frequencies need to be well coordinated taking the flexibility in the schedule of each frequency. Our heuristic takes a dynamic pattern generation approach (sequentially determining the cluster size of delivery days for each <b>delivery</b> <b>frequency)</b> and employs a number of different coordination algorithms. Extensive computational experiments are carried out demonstrating that the average performance of the heuristics is very good. With the assumption that customers with different delivery frequencies do not appear in the same delivery route, the computational results show that the difference between the fleet size determined by the heuristics and the lower bound is one when T< 60, and the difference is two when 60 ≤T≤ 360...|$|E

30|$|Shelf-space and reorder {{planning}} are {{of great}} importance to retailers for several reasons: The increasing number of products is in conflict with limited shelf space. Today, up to 30 % more products than ten years ago compete for scare space (EHI Retail Institute 2014; Hübner et al. 2016). This puts retailers under pressure to manage profitability with narrow margins and to maintain space productivity (Gutgeld et al. 2009). In fact, shelf space {{has been referred to}} as a retailer’s scarcest resource (cf. e.g., Lim et al. 2004; Irion et al. 2012; Geismar et al. 2015; Bianchi-Aguiar et al. 2015 a). Above all, changes in shelf space impact customer demand due to the higher visibility of items (Eisend 2014). In other words, the demand for an item grows, the more shelf space is allocated to it. This is referred to as “space-elastic demand”. Additionally, the costs associated with in-store replenishment are significant, because in-store logistics costs amount to up to 50 % of total retail supply chain costs (Kotzab and Teller 2005; Broekmeulen et al. 2006; Reiner et al. 2013; Kuhn and Sternbeck 2013). However, the options for changing replenishment frequencies are subject to the availability of backroom inventory for intermediate storage (Eroglu et al. 2013; Pires et al. 2016) and the degree of freedom to choose different <b>delivery</b> <b>frequencies</b> (Sternbeck and Kuhn 2014). Besides product margins and demand effects, the shelf-space planner should therefore also consider options for arranging items on the shelf, in-store replenishment frequencies and costs, and the availability of a backroom for replenishment.|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} the strategic impact of flexible delivery frequencies on the competition of logistics service providers (LSPs) in a supply chain. LSPs compete for customers who choose an exclusive service provider {{based on their}} individual preference, prices and inventory costs. The service provider which offers the higher <b>delivery</b> <b>frequency</b> is more attractive to customers, because inventory holding costs are kept low. In reverse, higher delivery frequencies entail higher transportation costs for the LSPs (frequency effect), which is only partially offset by a community cost effect that captures the economies of scale from larger market share and synergies from increased load efficiency. We consider a scenario in which {{only one of the}} two LSPs can choose its <b>delivery</b> <b>frequency</b> strategically. Our main result is that flexibility in frequency choice is only a strategic advantage for the LSP if customers’ inventory holding costs are relatively high compared to transportation costs. In this case customers especially appreciate the high delivery frequencies and the flexible LSP is able to satisfy this demand. However, when inventory holding costs are comparably small with respect to the LSPs ’ transportation costs, the inflexible LSP is at an advantage. In this case, inflexibility acts as a credible strategic commitment which the flexible LSP can only react to. Furthermore, low inventory holding costs lead to {{a situation in which the}} LSP with the flexible <b>delivery</b> <b>frequency</b> faces the dilemma whether to choose its optimal <b>delivery</b> <b>frequency</b> and to make less profit than his competitor or to forfeit some of its own profits in order to make larger profits than the other LSP. ...|$|E

Previous research has linked this to an agile supply chain structure, better able to accommodate the unpredictable nature of demand within the medical supply chain (Bailey et al. 2013), which encourages sub-optimal product flows, leading to low vehicle load factors (McKone-Sweet et al. 2005; Jarret 2006; Costantino et al. 2010; Black and Zimmerman 2012; Azzi et al. 2013).
