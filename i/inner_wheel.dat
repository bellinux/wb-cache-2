2500|$|At {{the end of}} June 1944, a {{decision}} was taken to fit tropical air filters as standard, similar to those fitted to the three Typhoons which {{had been sent to}} North Africa in 1943. One thousand sets of the filters were to be manufactured and fitted to front line Typhoons as Mod. 421. It was estimated that these could be fitted to all Typhoons on the production lines by the end of September. Research shows that late Typhoons starting in the RB--- series were fitted with the filters, as were some rebuilt aircraft from earlier production batches. Mod. 421 appeared as a streamlined rectangular [...] "hump", just behind the main radiator fairing and between the <b>inner</b> <b>wheel</b> doors, where the updraught carburettor intake was located.|$|E

It received a completely new 6-cylinder, 3.8 litre boxer engine delivering [...] with revised Borg-Warner variable turbine geometry (VTG) turbos. The 911 Turbo is now only available with a manual gearbox or the optional 7-speed PDK dual-clutch gearbox, which replaces the Tiptronic. With PDK and the also optional sport-chrono package, which includes the availability of an electronically controlled launch-control and an overboost-function for temporary increasing the turbo-pressure, Porsche claims the 911 turbo will go from 0 to [...] in 3.4 seconds and reach a top-speed of [...] However, several tests done by Auto-Magazines and impartial testers have revealed that the 0â€“100km/h acceleration-time is generally as low as 2.9 seconds. The model can now also be ordered with PTV, Porsche Torque Vectoring, which will brake the <b>inner</b> <b>wheel</b> to provide turning-torque through a curve. The looks of the facelifted model was left mostly untouched from the original 997 turbo, but there are subtle changes to the rear lights, now being LED-type, among changes to the front lamps. The rear exhaust outputs are now also [...] "fatter" [...] and the standard [...] wheels now have a new design. Thanks to revised dynamics the facelifted 997 can handle 1.3 g forces on a skid-pad according to Porsche. It is believed that the updated 997 Turbo was benchmarked against the Nissan GT-R in response to 3rd party testing between the 997 Turbo and the GT-R.|$|E

50|$|A few {{aggressive}} skate frames (most {{notably the}} Rollerblade Switch Frame) are {{designed so that}} there are two big outer wheels, and two small <b>inner</b> <b>wheels,</b> rockered so that they all touch the ground. This gives the benefits of a flat setup, while giving the rollerblader more space to grind on the H-block between the wheels.|$|R
50|$|Running {{the bridge}} out is {{effected}} by pushing it along its rails until the outer two wheels {{are at the}} edge of the granite sill of the ditch. When the bridge is pushed beyond this point the two outer wheels do not descend the slopes of the granite slabs but instead the bridge remains in a horizontal position. This is due to the centre axle being offset from the centre of the girders causing the bridge to run on its <b>inner</b> two <b>wheels.</b> The middle two wheels follow along the trays. When the bridge is just less than halfway out, the ends of the centre axle then engage in the cups of the lifting arms. The middle two wheels partially descend the slopes of the granite sill. The bridge continues to move out, its outer end dipping below the horizontal, its <b>inner</b> <b>wheels</b> still running along the trays of the courtyard. The weight of the bridge, at the point where the centre of gravity of the lifting arms is beyond the pivot point of the arms and the stays, causes the bridge mechanism to descend, its wheels running up the vertical racers set into the wall of the pit. At a point where the <b>inner</b> <b>wheels</b> are at the top of the slope down the granite sill, the outer ends of the girders and the outer wheels hit curved sprung metal guides.These guide the outer end of the bridge upwards so that the ends of the girders come to rest on the lip of the granite slab, the <b>inner</b> <b>wheels</b> descending the slope of the inner granite slab. The inner end of each girder is angled to form a close fit with the granite slab.|$|R
50|$|In {{automotive}} engineering {{the electronic}} differential {{is a form}} of differential, which provides the required torque for each driving wheel and allows different wheel speeds. It is used in place of the mechanical differential in multi-drive systems. When cornering, the <b>inner</b> and outer <b>wheels</b> rotate at different speeds, because the <b>inner</b> <b>wheels</b> describe a smaller turning radius. The electronic differential uses the steering wheel command signal and the motor speed signals to control the power to each wheel so that all wheels are supplied with the torque they need.|$|R

50|$|The {{basic idea}} behind {{the need for a}} {{traction}} control system is the loss of road grip that compromises steering control and stability of vehicles because of the difference in traction of the drive wheels. Difference in slip may occur due to turning of a vehicle or varying road conditions for different wheels. When a car turns, its outer and <b>inner</b> <b>wheels</b> rotate at different speeds; this is conventionally controlled by using a differential. A further enhancement of the differential is to employ an active differential that can vary the amount of power being delivered to outer and <b>inner</b> <b>wheels</b> as needed. For example, if outward slip is sensed while turning, the active differential may deliver more power to the outer wheel in order to minimize the yaw (essentially {{the degree to which the}} front and rear wheels of a car are out of line.)Active differential, in turn, is controlled by an assembly of electromechanical sensors collaborating with a traction control unit.|$|R
50|$|Generally, {{there are}} three {{different}} types of modern frames: flat, anti-rocker, and freestyle. Flat, as described above, means you have four wheels per skate. There is another variation of this called the Hi-Lo setup. This means it has large outer <b>wheels,</b> but small <b>inner</b> <b>wheels</b> to make grinding easy. The inner wheels' axles are closer to the ground {{so that all the}} wheels touch the ground.|$|R

50|$|The Me 609 {{would have}} joined the two Me 309 fuselages with a new centre wing section. Only the two <b>inner</b> <b>wheels</b> of the joined Me 309's main landing gears would have been used and would retract into the centre section. This {{resulted}} in an unusual four-wheel arrangement. The pilot would have sat in a cockpit located in the port fuselage, with the starboard being smoothed over.|$|R
5000|$|To {{raise the}} bridge an initial lift {{to the inner}} end of the bridge is required. This raises the <b>inner</b> <b>wheels</b> back up the {{inclines}} of the granite slabs. At {{the same time the}} outer ends are pulled from the lip of the granite slab, the wheels rolling down the sprung metal guides. When the <b>inner</b> <b>wheels</b> are pulled up onto the metal trays the weight of the lifting arms assists the raising of the bridge to a point where the centre of gravity of the arms is over the pivot of the upper support stays. From here on the pull necessary to raise the centre wheels is negligible. Once the lifting arms are in the fully retracted position the centre wheels are on top of the metal trays and the axles disengage from the cups. The bridge now sits on its inner two axles. From here it is necessary to pull the bridge in until the outer two wheels arrive at the trays. The bridge is then pulled within the gates on all six wheels.|$|R
5000|$|The {{freestyle}} {{frame is}} another setup used by aggressive skaters. This setup simply has two wheels - {{one in the}} front and one in the back. In between the two wheels is an area of solid material, resembling a large [...] "H Block", which is used for grinding. Freestyle frames can be purchased, although removing the two <b>inner</b> <b>wheels</b> of a flat or anti-rocker frame technically makes it freestyle, however this would not be very durable {{due to the lack of}} solid grinding material.|$|R

50|$|Anti-rocker, as also {{described}} above, {{is the most}} popular setup. Freestyle frames have no <b>inner</b> <b>wheels,</b> giving the user a large amount of space in the middle for grinding. Another setup that's gaining popularity, called tri-rocker, means that there are three wheels per skate. The remaining axle hole is left empty or replaced with an anti-rocker wheel. This combines the benefits of a flat setup (going fast and turning easily) with the benefits of an anti-rocker/freestyle setup (grinding easily). The frame company Create Originals makes frames that are meant for tri rocker to be a possibility.|$|R
40|$|Tonal squeal noise (i. e. {{the high}} {{amplitude}} singing of a railway wheel with pure tone components) is emitted by some trailing <b>inner</b> wagon <b>wheels</b> on heavy haul trains in 1000 m radius curves on the iron ore export line in South Africa. Field measurements {{have shown that}} the trailing <b>inner</b> <b>wheels</b> that squeal are subject to predominantly longitudinal creepage with little to no lateral creepage. The longitudinal creepage acting at the contact of the squealing wheels exceeds 1 %, which supports the likelihood of creep saturation and subsequently squeal due to unsteady longitudinal creepage in the large radius curves. Experimental modal analysis of the wheel types identified to be relevant to squeal has revealed that for each unstable frequency, two eigenmodes are likely to be important: one which has a large mode shape component at the wheel-rail contact in the circumferential direction and another which has a large mode shape component at the wheel-rail contact in the radial direction. A frictional self-excitation mechanism based on mode-coupling is favoured as being responsible for squeal excited in large radius curves. [URL] and Aeronautical Engineerin...|$|R
