5|$|Lukashenko {{announced}} a new law in 2014 that will prohibit <b>kolkhoz</b> workers (around 9% of total work force) from leaving their jobs at will—a change of job and living location will require permission from governors. The law was compared with serfdom by Lukashenko himself. Similar regulations were introduced for the forestry industry in 2012.|$|E
5|$|Cho was {{initially}} supposed to enroll at the Moscow University, {{but he was}} robbed at a train station in Omsk. With no money, Cho was stranded and had {{to work at a}} <b>kolkhoz</b> in Omsk for the summer to get some. The rector of the Omsk University, Aleksandr Sergeevitch Slivko was touched by his fate and decided to admit him in the university. Thus, from 1933 until his graduation in 1937, he attended the Faculty of Literature of the Gorky Omsk State Pedagogical University. Although he was not fluent in Russian upon entering the university, he graduated with excellent marks, and his time spent there amplified his Russian and Soviet sides.|$|E
5|$|In his new positions, Khrushchev {{continued}} his <b>kolkhoz</b> consolidation scheme, which decreased {{the number of}} collective farms in Moscow province by about 70%. This resulted in farms that were too large for one chairman to manage effectively. Khrushchev also sought to implement his agro-town proposal, but when his lengthy speech on the subject was published in Pravda in March 1951, Stalin disapproved of it. The periodical quickly published a note stating that Khrushchev's speech was merely a proposal, not policy. In April, the Politburo disavowed the agro-town proposal. Khrushchev feared that Stalin would remove him from office, but the leader mocked Khrushchev, then allowed the episode to pass.|$|E

50|$|Details of {{resettlement}} {{were defined}} in the Soviet Union’s Council of Ministers’ Resolution #754. The part of <b>kolkhoz’s</b> (collective farm) moveable property was assigned and gratuitous transportation of this property to the new settlement was provided for the deported. Price of moveable property abandoned in Armenia was paid for in <b>kolkhozs</b> at places of new settlement of Azerbaijanis. Some benefits were given to migrants {{and at the same}} time permanent grants of 1000 rubles were given out per head of family and 300 rubles per each member of family. According to historian Vladislav Zubok, due to calls of Grigory Arutyunov, the First Secretary of Armenian SSR’s Communist Party’s Central Committee, Stalin ordered to deport Azerbaijani population from the Armenian SSR to the Azerbaijan SSR. At the same time he gave consent for repatriation of 90,000 Armenians to the settlements of the newly deported Azerbaijanis. The resettlement was not voluntary.|$|R
5|$|Khrushchev {{sought to}} abolish the Machine-Tractor Stations (MTS) which not only owned most large {{agricultural}} machines such as combines and tractors, but also provided services such as plowing, and transfer their equipment and functions to the kolkhozes and sovkhozes (state farms). After a successful test involving MTS which served one large <b>kolkhoz</b> each, Khrushchev ordered a gradual transition—but then ordered that the change take place with great speed. Within three months, {{over half of the}} MTS facilities had been closed, and kolkhozes were being required to buy the equipment, with no discount given for older or dilapidated machines. MTS employees, unwilling to bind themselves to kolkhozes and lose their state employee benefits and the right to change their jobs, fled to the cities, creating a shortage of skilled operators. The costs of the machinery, plus the costs of building storage sheds and fuel tanks for the equipment, impoverished many kolkhozes. Inadequate provisions were made for repair stations. Without the MTS, the market for Soviet agricultural equipment fell apart, as the kolkhozes now had neither the money nor skilled buyers to purchase new equipment.|$|E

50|$|To {{destroy the}} {{partisan}} {{base of support}} major deportation took place in March 1949. Most part of supporters were deported and others were forced to join <b>kolkhozs.</b> By the early 1950s, the Soviet forces had eradicated most of the Latvian national resistance. Intelligence gathered by the Soviet spies in the West and KGB infiltrators within the resistance movement, in combination with large-scale Soviet operations in 1952 managed to end the campaigns against them.|$|R
50|$|The first warehouse, {{intended}} to house Maciunas, Watts, Christo & Jeanne-Claude, Jonas Mekas, LaMonte Young & others, was located on Greene Street. Likening these communities {{to the soviet}} <b>Kolkhozs,</b> Maciunas didn't hesitate to adopt the title 'Chairman of Bldg. Co-Op' without first registering an office or becoming {{a member of the}} New York State Association of Realtors. FluxHousing Co-Operatives continued to redevelop the area over the next decade, and were widened to include plans to set up a FluxIsland- a suitable island was located near Antigua, but the money to buy and develop it remained unforthcoming- and finally a performance arts centre called the FluxFarm established in New Marlborough, Massachusetts. The plans were continually dogged by financial problems, constant run-ins with the New York authorities, and eventually resulted, on 8 November 1975, in Maciunas being severely beaten by thugs sent by an unpaid electrical contractor.|$|R
50|$|Absheron District {{was founded}} in 1963 by the Soviet {{government}} to assure enough labour force, highly educated professional staff and necessary provisions is given to enterprises and firms, <b>kolkhozs</b> and collective farms, poultry and agrarian industries, construction centres, scientific-research institutes and laboratories present on the territories of Baku and Sumgait.There are lots of historical monuments on the territory of Absheron. For example, in the village Aşağı Güzdək there are agricultural tools from the 19th century. In Goradile village, there is Abdurrahman mosque pertaining to the 19th century which was built by the villager Haji Gurban, mosques from the 18th century in Məmmədli built by Garadaglilar family, mosque-madrasa built in the 19th century by Haji Safarali in Novxani, Albattin mosque in Fatmai which {{goes back to the}} 18th century. Aside from religious monuments, there are many monuments pertaining to social life of people in last centuries.

Ancient wells which provided water supply to people living in this territory are still used in Aşağı Güzdək and Xirdalan. Tombs from the 8th - 18th centuries are also preserved: in Fatmai, Digah, Masazir, Hökməli and Saray.|$|R
25|$|On January 20, 2000, {{the main}} office of Isfana's <b>Kolkhoz</b> was {{acquired}} to establish the Uzbek Gymnasium as a separate institution. The school has used the two-storied building, which was built in 1982, since that time. In 2000, the school was officially named after Usmon Matkarimov {{who served as the}} head of Isfana's <b>kolkhoz</b> for many years and greatly contributed to the development of Isfana and Leilek District. In May 2000, a bust of Matkarimov was erected in front of the main building of the school.|$|E

5000|$|Maria Gabiniewicz, {{one of the}} refugess, later wrote: [...] "We {{managed to}} leave the Soviet Union in the last transport. Still, {{thousands}} of distraught Poles remained there, sent to <b>kolkhozs.</b> I {{will never forget the}} journey on trucks through the mountains from Ashgabat to Tehran. After the hell that we survived, Tehran was a different world. Camp life was organized, there was a school, scouts, and religious life. Tehran was a gate, through which we were sent, in groups, to different parts of the world. My mother refused the tempting offer of going to Santa Rosa in Mexico. She wanted us to go either to India or Africa, as it was closer to Europe. She hoped we would return to Poland some day. We were transported on board a warship, through Persian Gulf (...) After twelve days, we reached the port of Beira in Mozambique. The adults were uneasy and afraid of the unknown, but us, the children, were happy for an adventure. We were not first the Poles in Africa. There were already 22 camps, with 18,000 people who like us had gone through different places of exile in the USSR, scattered across British Africa - from Kenya to Cape Colony.|$|R

25|$|However, the Soviet {{authorities}} {{then started}} {{a campaign of}} forced collectivisation, which largely nullified the earlier gains from the land reform as the peasants generally {{did not want to}} join the <b>Kolkhoz</b> farms, nor to give away their crops for free to fulfill the state-imposed quotas.|$|E

25|$|In Russia, {{the age-old}} {{ways of life}} of the Sami were brutally {{interrupted}} by the collectivization of the reindeer husbandry and agriculture in general. Most Sami were organized in a single <b>kolkhoz,</b> located in {{the central part of}} the Peninsula, at Lovozero (Sami: Lojavri). The Soviet state made an enormous effort to develop this strategically important region, and the Sami people witnessed their land being overrun by ethnic Russians and other Soviet nationalities, including Nenets and other Arctic peoples.|$|E
25|$|Polosin {{was born}} in 1924 in Kazinka village, Sosnovsky District, Tambov Oblast to a peasant family. In 1932, {{the family moved to}} Vishnevka village in Morshansky District.

25|$|On {{the eve of}} World War II, Ivan Chonkin, {{the most}} {{dispensable}} soldier, is sent to guard a disabled military plane that crash landed on a <b>kolkhoz</b> (collective farm).

25|$|Pressure from Moscow to collectivize {{continued}} and {{the authorities in}} Latvia sought {{to reduce the number}} of individual farmers (increasingly labelled kulaki or budži) through higher taxes and requisitioning of agricultural products for state use. The first <b>kolkhoz</b> was established only in November 1946 and by 1948, just 617 kolkhozes had been established, integrating 13,814 individual farmsteads (12.6% of the total). The process was still judged too slow, and in March 1949 just under 13,000 kulak families as well as a large number of individuals were identified. Between March 24 and March 30, 1949, about 40,000 people were deported and resettled at various points throughout the USSR.|$|E

In 1947, Sergey Izgiyayev participated in the first congress for young writers in Dagestan. In the early 1960s, he earned his MA in education. From 1961 he served {{as the chairman of}} a collective farm (<b>kolkhoz),</b> and {{was the head of the}} department of culture of Derbent District Executive Committee, among other leadership positions. In 1963, Sergey Izgiyayev was accepted to the Union of Soviet Writers.|$|E
25|$|On the {{theoretical}} level, Bordiga developed {{an understanding of}} the Soviet Union as a capitalist society. Bordiga's writings on the capitalist nature of the Soviet economy, in contrast to those produced by the Trotskyists, also focused on the agrarian sector. In analyzing the agriculture of the Soviet Union, Bordiga sought to display the capitalist social relations that existed in the <b>kolkhoz</b> and sovkhoz, one a cooperative farm and the other a wage-labor state farm. In particular, he emphasized how much of the national agrarian produce came from small, privately owned plots (writing in 1950) and predicted the rates at which the Soviet Union would start importing wheat after Russia had been such a large exporter from the 1880s to 1914.|$|E
25|$|With the {{collapse}} of the Soviet Union in 1991, the <b>Kolkhoz</b> collectives were abandoned. The Nivkh were dependent on the state-funded collectives, and with their dissolution, rapid economic hardship ensued for the already poor populace. At present, the Nivkh living in the north of Sakhalin see their future threatened by the giant offshore oil extraction projects known as Sakhalin-I and Sakhalin-II, operated by foreign Western firms. Since January 2005, the Nivkh, led by their elected leader Alexey Limanzo, have engaged in non-violent protest actions, demanding an independent ethnological assessment of Shell's and Exxon's plans. Solidarity actions have been staged in Moscow, New York City and later in Berlin. The monthly Nivkh newspaper, Nivkh Dif, established in 1990, is published using the west-Sakhalin dialect and is headquartered in the village of Nekrasovka.|$|E
25|$|Russia {{underwent}} the October Revolution {{forming the}} Soviet Union in 1922. The new government altered prior Russian Imperial policies towards the Nivkh {{that were in}} line with communist ideology. Soviet officials embraced the autonym Nivkh to replace the old term Gilyak, as a hallmark for new native self-determination. A brief autonomous okrug was created for the Nivkh. The government granted them extensive fishing rights, which were not rescinded until the 1960s. But, other Soviet policies proved devastating. The Nivkh were forced into mass agricultural and industrial labor collectives called <b>kolkhoz.</b> Nivkh fishermen were difficult to convert to agricultural practices because of their belief that ploughing the earth was a sin. The Nivkh were soon working and living as a second-class minority group among the massive Russian labor force.|$|E
25|$|The {{official}} {{numbers for}} collectivized area (the column with percent of sown area in collective {{use in the}} table above) are biased upward by two technical factors. First, these official numbers are calculated as percent of sown area in peasant farmsteads, excluding the area cultivated by sovkhozes and other agricultural users. Estimates based on total sown area (including state farms) reduce the share of collective farms between 1935-1940 to about 80%. Second, the household plots of <b>kolkhoz</b> members (i.e., collectivized farmsteads) {{are included in the}} land base of collective farms. Without the household plots, arable land in collective cultivation in 1940 was 96.4% of land in collective farms, and not 99.8% as shown by official statistics. Although there is no arguing with the fact that collectivization was sweeping and total between 1928 and 1940, the table below provides different (more realistic) numbers on the extent of collectivization of sown areas.|$|E
