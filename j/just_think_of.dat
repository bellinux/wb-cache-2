5|$|At the office, Michael Scott (Steve Carell) announces to the {{employees}} that Deangelo Vickers (Will Ferrell) {{will be his}} co-host at the Dundies. The Dundies are an annual award program created by Michael to motivate his employees. The idea of performance is worrisome to Deangelo, but Michael insists he take the job. Michael brings some of the staff together {{in the conference room}} to help Deangelo get prepared for the show, but he struggles to be humorous. Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) tries to help him, saying he should <b>just</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> performing like conducting a meeting, but Michael objects, wanting Deangelo to mimic his style. Michael tries a number of different things to help Deangelo, such as sitting on his stomach and making him listen to a Walkman at full volume so he cannot hear himself think, but none are effective.|$|E
500|$|Tracks for {{the album}} were whittled down from {{recording}} sessions lasting up to 30 hours. Producer Rusko, who played guitar and piano on the album, described the pair getting [...] "carried away" [...] in the studio, appreciating the [...] "mad distorted and hectic" [...] sound {{they were able}} to create. Rusko said [...] "She's got a kid, a little one year old baby, and we recorded his heart beat. We'd <b>just</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> crazy ideas". Rusko has described M.I.A. as the best artist he has ever worked with, saying that she had [...] "been the most creative and I really had a good time making music with her".|$|E
500|$|The real Abagnale {{never saw}} his father again after he ran away from home. Spielberg [...] "wanted to {{continue}} to have that connection where Frank kept trying to please his father; by making him proud of him; by seeing him in the uniform, the Pan-American uniform". However, Abagnale praised the idea. [...] "Even though I didn't see my dad again, every night after living a brilliant day and meeting many women, and making much money, I'd come back alone to a hotel room and I would <b>just</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> {{my mom and dad}} and fantasize about getting them back together again, and cry. It's the justification of a fantasy." [...] Carl Hanratty (portrayed by Tom Hanks) is based on FBI agent Joseph Shea. In the shooting script the character was referred to as Joseph Shea, but was changed to Carl Hanratty for unknown reasons.|$|E
60|$|Chief among these, and, indeed, {{the only}} one I <b>just</b> now <b>think</b> <b>of,</b> is their great care while doing {{business}} to avoid disturbing people's sleep.|$|R
6000|$|... "And to think," [...] she said, [...] "that uncanny {{thing was}} {{probably}} watching {{me all the}} time that I was writing--oo! It makes me shudder <b>just</b> to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> it." ...|$|R
60|$|No {{words can}} {{describe}} {{the feeling that}} filled Dave's heart. Was he to meet his father at last? At times he trembled like a leaf <b>just</b> to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> it.|$|R
2500|$|Shi's {{defection}} {{was motivated}} {{in part because}} he disagreed with the monastery's strictures, saying, [...] "In the temple, monks have 250 rules. Two hundred fifty! <b>Just</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> that! You cannot drink. You cannot eat spices. You cannot drink bottled water. You cannot look at a woman. That's just crazy. It's the 21st century, you know?" ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{spokesman}} for the National Society for Human Rights, an organisation which is funded by the Saudi Government, said {{that the number of}} executions is rising because crime rates are rising, that prisoners are treated humanely, and that the beheadings deter crime, saying, [...] "Allah, our creator, knows best what's good for His people...Should we <b>just</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> and preserve the rights of the murderer and not think of the rights of others?" ...|$|E
2500|$|However, {{although}} there were media reports of his heavy-handed, intimidating tactics, Grant's biographers Lewis and Pallet suggest that [...] "he was generally held in high esteem by those with whom he came in contact." [...] In the words of John Paul Jones, [...] "Peter was a very sensitive man. He was a very, very smart man. People <b>just</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> his size and his reputation, but actually he never had to use his size. He could out-talk anybody ..." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "I {{think it}} is harder for a woman-of-color filmmaker to get a {{directing}} job than a white woman... (Studios and production companies) <b>just</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>of</b> women of color for these jobs." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No; Betty, I never was. I {{only thought}} I was in love." [...] A convulsive squeeze and creaking, whiffling sounds heralded a fresh outburst. [...] "Don't cry; we're <b>just</b> there. <b>Think</b> <b>of</b> our darling!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But we can't {{see where}} we're going, or what we're {{stepping}} on," [...] protested Dorothy. [...] "There may be dreadful things {{mixed up in}} that fog, an' I'm scared <b>just</b> to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> wading into it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{trust that}} {{there will never be}} another time like this for me. I shall be ready to {{volunteer}} for service in any part of the world, bar Western Africa. They say that the troops at the Cape are going through a hard time, but I am convinced that it is child's play in comparison with our work here. Why, they have hours, and indeed days, sometimes, without rain. <b>Just</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> that, my dear fellow! <b>Just</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> it! And when the rain does fall, it soon sinks into the sandy soil and, if they lie down at night, they only get wet on one side, and have waterproof sheets to lie on. <b>Just</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> that! And yet, they actually consider that they are going through hardships! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I {{really thought}} he would come back," [...] said Rollo. [...] "But never mind, Jennie, we shall get along very well. We shall not {{have to get out}} of this ship at all till we get to Liverpool; and we shall find father at Liverpool. He will come on board for us at Liverpool, I am sure, before we land; and mother, too, I dare say. <b>Just</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> that, Jennie! <b>Just</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> that!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, we {{must get}} there, Chet! <b>Just</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> it--only twenty-two miles more! Why, it's nothing {{alongside}} {{of what we have}} already traveled." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, it's a shame. And <b>just</b> to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> it, {{after next}} June, when we graduate, we'll all be {{scattered}} here, there, and everywhere, {{and the good}} old times at Brill will {{be a thing of}} the past." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Snake skins! Snake skins!" [...] shrieked Jenny Wren. [...] "What are {{you talking}} about, Peter Rabbit? I never have {{anything}} to do with Snake skins and don't want to. Ugh! It makes me shiver <b>just</b> to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> it." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Five {{years ago}} I {{would have died}} over a {{controversy}} like this. But now I <b>just</b> <b>think</b> it's foolish <b>of</b> them to take it so seriously." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't imagine I like it," [...] she said, as she ate her cutlet. [...] "I DON'T like it, I really don't! <b>Just</b> <b>THINK</b> <b>of</b> {{your money}} wasted!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think it}} is 'here you are'!" [...] exclaimed Polly. [...] "The girls have been here nearly half an hour waiting. <b>Just</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> the time wasted!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Never mind, Tom, let it go. You <b>just</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> Sam and me, and {{the folks}} at home. And don't forget Nellie," [...] Dick added, in a whisper.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now that isn't fair, Mr. Schwirtz; {{you know}} it isn't--it's almost dark here on the porch, even with the lamps. I couldn't really see you. And, besides, I did {{recognize}} you--I <b>just</b> couldn't <b>think</b> <b>of</b> your name for the moment." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "`Why, {{the people}} <b>of</b> St. <b>Just</b> only <b>think</b> <b>of</b> the berryin', but I do <b>think</b> <b>of</b> the resurrection; the consekince {{is that they}} do dig too deep, an' afore the St. Just folk are well out of their graves, ours will be a braave way up to heaven!'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] she said. [...] "It {{makes me}} sick <b>just</b> to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> being tied up in that way,--and the black paint, too! But then you are so much bigger than he is, that it don't seem right for you to thrash him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, it's {{a little}} world," [...] said Fulkerson. [...] "You {{seem to be}} {{touching}} elbows with everybody. <b>Just</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> your having had our head translator for a model." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, indeed, I won't," [...] {{repeated}} Mrs Denman; [...] "how can I? <b>Just</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> the situation. Sitting in {{my chair}} in dishabille, when a man--a Man, Miss Dee--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, I {{guess she}} is {{all ready to}} run," [...] remarked Dick, at length. [...] "My, but isn't she a beauty, Tom! <b>Just</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> sailing around in her!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{makes me}} feel just {{as if we were}} one big family," [...] cried Andy, enthusiastically. [...] "Oh, Chet, <b>just</b> to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> it! We'll hunt musk oxen, and polar bears, and seals, and walruses! And go clear to the Pole, too!" ...|$|R
5000|$|The song's spoken opening line, [...] "You {{remind me}} <b>of</b> something...I <b>just</b> can't <b>think</b> <b>of</b> what it is" [...] would be sampled in 2003 for the {{original}} version of Kelly's hit Ignition. Prior to that, the line is referenced in [...] "We Ride" [...] on 1998's R.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now for breakfast," [...] {{she said}} briskly. [...] "I am {{of the opinion}} that we will all be glad of a bite and sup. You tell young Mrs. Doctor not to worry about a single thing--Susan is at the helm. You tell her <b>just</b> to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> her baby." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And <b>just</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> {{the hundred}} and one {{things that come}} from it," [...] said Jack. [...] "Kerosene and gasoline, and benzine and naphtha and paraffin, and I don't know what all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is true; but <b>just</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> what {{a supply}} of wood for spears and sledges! It {{would have been enough}} to last the lives of our children's children, if not longer." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>Just</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> it, Columbia, how pleased {{we shall}} be with one another: and how much nicer it will be than if you snorted [...] "High-falutin' Nonsense"--or [...] "Wordy mass of repulsive rubbish." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have," [...] replied Jumper. [...] "It is {{a wonder}} I am here at all; I came to near {{furnishing}} Yowler the Bob Cat a breakfast {{that it makes}} me shiver <b>just</b> to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> it. I guess if I hadn't been thinking about him, he would have caught me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It 's {{bad enough}} to love some one who don't love you, but to have them told of it is {{perfectly}} awful. It makes me wild <b>just</b> to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> it. Oh, Fan, I 'm getting so ill-tempered and envious and wicked, I don't {{know what will happen}} to me." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "All my {{intentions}} were <b>just</b> to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> happier times - basically {{looking for a}} brighter day - because times were at a low tide. After I wrote it, I thought [...] "Sunny" [...] just might be {{a different approach to}} what Johnny Bragg was talking about in [...] "Just Walkin' in the Rain".|$|R
