40|$|A {{model has}} been {{developed}} that shares the steady-state and the dynamic voltage-current (V-I) characteristics of a xenon headlamp in a motor vehicle. This study proposes the modelling method, {{which is based on}} the spline interpolation algorithms including a major factor such as its temperature that is responsible for the design of an high-intensity discharge (HID) ballast during a <b>hot</b> <b>re-strike.</b> As the model simulates the transition process of an HID lamp, the simulation system that includes the HID ballast and the lamp model will be illustrated in detail. The results from the simulation and the experiments will lead to the model validation {{at the end of the}} study. This study provides a valuable approach for the optimisation of the HID ballast and the design of a system controller. Department of Electrical Engineerin...|$|E
