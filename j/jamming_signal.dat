5|$|At Strangways' house, Bond sees a {{photograph}} of a boatman with Strangways. Bond locates the boatman, named Quarrel, whom he recognises as the driver of the car that followed him. Bond, after overpowering Quarrel and his friend Puss Feller, meets Quarrel's passenger, Felix Leiter, a CIA agent on the same mission as Bond. The CIA has traced the radio <b>jamming</b> <b>signal</b> to Jamaica, but has not determined its exact origin. Quarrel, who is assisting Leiter, reveals that he had been guiding Strangways around the nearby islands to collect mineral samples. He also mentions the reclusive Dr. No, the owner of Crab Key, an island rigorously protected against trespassers by an armed security force.|$|E
5|$|Soon after, Rebecca {{contacts}} the hacker, {{and says}} that she has convinced TriOptimum to authorize the station's destruction; she provides him with details {{on how to do}} this. After obtaining the necessary codes, the hacker initiates the station's self-destruct sequence and flees to the escape pod bay. There, the hacker defeats Diego a second time, then attempts to disembark. However, SHODAN prevents the pod from launching; it seeks to keep the player aboard the station, while the bridge—which contains SHODAN—is jettisoned to a safe distance. Rebecca tells the hacker that he can still escape if he reaches the bridge; SHODAN then intercepts and jams the transmission. After defeating Diego for the third time and killing him for good, the hacker makes it to the bridge as it is released from the main station, which soon detonates. He is then contacted by a technician who managed to circumvent SHODAN's <b>jamming</b> <b>signal.</b> The technician informs him that SHODAN can only be defeated in cyberspace, due to the powerful shields that protect its mainframe computers. Using a terminal near the mainframe, the hacker enters cyberspace and destroys SHODAN. After his rescue, the hacker is offered a job at TriOptimum, but he declines in favor of continuing his life as a hacker.|$|E
25|$|Jamming is {{problematic}} to radar since the <b>jamming</b> <b>signal</b> only needs to travel one way (from the jammer to the radar receiver) whereas the radar echoes travel two ways (radar-target-radar) {{and are therefore}} significantly reduced in power {{by the time they}} return to the radar receiver. Jammers therefore can be much less powerful than their jammed radars and still effectively mask targets along the line of sight from the jammer to the radar (mainlobe jamming).

30|$|Radar signal {{processing}} seeks for an optimum processing method {{in order to}} acquire target information. In the instance {{that there is no}} jammer or multiple interference source that tries to mislead the radar, the true targets can be well detected. On the contrary, when the radar system is <b>jammed,</b> target <b>signals</b> are often superimposed with <b>jamming</b> <b>signals</b> making it difficult to distinguish true and false targets, and thus, erroneous information can occur. For that reason, in order to accurately detect the desired target <b>signals,</b> <b>jamming</b> <b>signals</b> must be separated from target signals.|$|R
30|$|Unlike the {{traditional}} relay selection strategy in [19], after the best relay is selected, {{it would not}} select the optimal jammer to transmit artificial <b>jamming</b> <b>signals.</b> Our proposed scheme selects the best relay to switch between FD and HD operation to deteriorate the receiving SINR at the eavesdropper. At the first time slot, the best relay works in FD protocol to receive useful signals from source and emit artificial <b>jamming</b> <b>signals</b> to interfere eavesdropper. At the second time slot, source transmits artificial <b>jamming</b> <b>signals</b> and relay switch to HD protocol to DF the confidential signals. It can simultaneously avoid the interference at destination from the source and degrade the receiving at eavesdropper.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. During {{the course}} of {{studying}} how to improve and optimize the anti-jamming ability of the satellite navigation and positioning system, the satellite channel was faced with many types of <b>jamming</b> <b>signals.</b> It is difficult to adopt one kind of jamming suppression technology to effectively suppress all kinds of jamming. In order to solve these problems, a new anti-jamming architecture for satellite navigation and positioning system is proposed. That is adopting the jamming cognitive method combined with the time-frequency domain jamming type recognition, power analysis and jamming DOA estimation. Also, the anti-jamming architecture design of the satellite navigation and positioning system is given based on the jamming cognition.

30|$|In [13 – 16], {{cooperative}} relaying {{and cooperative}} jamming were considered independently. In contrast, {{the works of}} [18 – 26] considered a joint cooperative relaying and jamming scheme, {{where some of the}} relays cooperate to forward the source signal and simultaneously the other relays cooperate to send <b>jamming</b> <b>signals</b> to confuse the eavesdroppers. Such joint scheme is especially useful when the number of relays is large. Later, in [27, 28], a more general joint cooperative relaying and jamming scheme was proposed, where each relay forwards the source <b>signal</b> and transmits <b>jamming</b> <b>signals</b> simultaneously. Due to noise amplification at relays, there exists a rate performance ceiling for the source-relay-destination (SRD) link, thus spending extra power in relaying will not help increase the secrecy rate after a certain point is reached. In contrast, distributing a portion of power to transmit <b>jamming</b> <b>signals</b> to confuse the eavesdropper may be more helpful.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a novel mechanism, called Ally Friendly Jamming, which aims at providing an intelligent jamming capability that can disable unauthorized (enemy) wireless communication {{but at the}} same time still allow authorized wireless devices to communicate, even if all these devices operate at the same frequency. The basic idea is to jam the wireless channel continuously but properly control the <b>jamming</b> <b>signals</b> with secret keys, so that the <b>jamming</b> <b>signals</b> are unpredictable interference to unauthorized devices, but are recoverable by authorized ones equipped with the secret keys. To achieve the ally friendly jamming capability, we develop new techniques to generate ally <b>jamming</b> <b>signals,</b> to identify and synchronize with multiple ally jammers. This paper also reports the analysis, implementation, and experimental evaluation of ally friendly jamming on a software defined radio platform. Both the analytical and experimental results indicate that the proposed techniques can effectively disable enemy wireless communication and at the same time maintain wireless communication between authorized devices.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{assuming}} an interference-limited eavesdropper scenario, {{the secrecy}} outage performance of multiple-input multiple-output wiretap channels with transmit antenna selection is investigated. Considering that the transmitter (Tx) and the receiver (Rx) {{are equipped with}} NA and NB antennas, respectively, while the passive eavesdropper is set with NE antennas, closed-form expressions for the secrecy outage probability and non-zero secrecy rate are derived. In our analysis, a selection combining (SC) is employed at the Rx, while the eavesdropper uses a maximal-ratio combining (MRC) scheme. In addition, we consider a friendly jammer which causes inter-ference at the eavesdropper. The derived outage expressions hold for arbitrary power distributed <b>jamming</b> <b>signals.</b> An asymptotic analysis is carried out to show {{the impact of the}} number of <b>jamming</b> <b>signals</b> and number of antennas on the secrecy outage performance. Interestingly, our results show that the diversity order equals to min(M,NANB), with M denoting the number of <b>jamming</b> <b>signals.</b> Index Terms—Jamming, MIMO wiretap channels, outage probability, secrecy performance.

The estimation of {{the parameters of the}} channel model for one of the users, in uplink transmission, is possible by means of the spreading function obtained from the discrete time-frequency evolutionary (DET) kernel of the received signal and the pseudo-noise code corresponding to the user. Excision of arbitrary <b>jamming</b> <b>signals,</b> present in the received signal, is done by means of a Wiener mask implemented with the DET.
