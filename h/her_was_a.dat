5|$|Lynch {{competed in}} road races and time trials, and {{off-road}} in cross country, in several world championships. She was not {{selected for the}} New Zealand road cycling team for the 1992 Olympics. She believed that omitting <b>her</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> mistake and intended to prove it by doing well at that year's Tour de France Féminin. She placed sixth in that race and demonstrated her good form. In 1992, she entered the UCI Mountain Bike World Championships in the veteran category and won bronze in both the cross country and the downhill events. When it was announced in 1994 that mountain biking was to become an Olympic discipline, Lynch's focus turned to being picked for the New Zealand team. For that reason, she swapped from the veteran class to elite at the world championships. She became New Zealand's first representative in an Olympic mountain biking event at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia. Aged 39, she was the oldest competitor in the event, but managed to achieve eighth place, leaving two previous world champions behind her. She retired from serious competition after the Olympics, {{with the exception of}} the first UCI World Cup in April 1997 that was held in New Zealand. Until her mid-40s, she competed at the top level in adventure racing. During her domestic career, Lynch won many national titles, and was a serial winner at premium events such as the Karapoti Classic and the Coast to Coast.|$|E

25|$|Governor Miguel de la Torre {{ordered her}} arrest on {{the charge that}} she planned to {{overthrow}} the Spanish Government in Puerto Rico. As the island had no women's prison, she was held without bail at the Castillo (Fort) de San Cristóbal.

500|$|... "Burn" [...] was {{considered}} a [...] "window to Usher's inner thoughts", along with the controversial track [...] "Confessions" [...] and [...] "Confessions Part II". The song is about breakups and ending relationships. According to Matt Cibula of Popmatters, [...] "Burn" [...] is constructed from [...] "two-step concept". In the lyrics [...] "You know that it's over / You {{know that it was}} through / Let it burn / Got to let it burn", Usher breaks up with his woman but found her sad about feeling bad about what happened to their relationship. However, Usher says that she must deal with it before she can accept the truth. For the lines [...] "It's been fifty-eleven days / Umpteen hours / I'm gonna be burnin' / Till you return", the direction changes after Usher realized that breaking up with <b>her</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> huge mistake and that he wanted her back.|$|E

500|$|According to Tetsuya Nomura, he based Yuna's {{overall design}} on hakama, {{a type of}} {{traditional}} Japanese clothing. Nomura {{said that when he}} learned the character was to perform a dance called the [...] "sending," [...] he wanted to give her outfit something that would flow. For this reason, the specific type of kimono he chose for <b>her</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> furisode, a long-sleeved kimono. Nomura also said that he adorned Yuna's dress and necklace with images of the hibiscus flower also called [...] "yuna," [...] and that her name carries the meaning of [...] "night" [...] (夕な) in Okinawan, establishing a contrast between her and the lead male protagonist of Final Fantasy X, Tidus, whose Japanese name (ティーダ) translates to [...] "sun" [...] (太陽) in Okinawan. This contrast is also represented in-game by items named for the sun and moon that empower Tidus' and Yuna's most powerful weapons. Nomura explains that while all these subtle details may be unneeded, he wanted his designs to have meaning behind them.|$|E
500|$|After {{releasing}} the studio albums Stars (1975), I'd Rather Believe in You (1976), Cherished and Two the Hard Way (1977), which became commercial failures, Cher {{went to the}} headquarters of Casablanca Records, in order to start recording for a new full-length record. She was hoping to record rock and roll-tinged music, though she was quickly advised by Neil Bogart to delve into disco music before recording with a genre that, according to him, she was not very good at. She was reluctant to take his advice, as she regarded disco as a [...] "superficial" [...] genre and did not believe it was [...] "serious music". However, she took his advice, and started working with Bob Esty, who arranged and produced records for Donna Summer and Barbra Streisand. Esty was skeptical of Cher's decision to record disco music, although {{he changed his mind}} after he began recording with her. The first song he played <b>her</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> demo of [...] "Take Me Home", which Cher said she liked.|$|E

[...] Chloe's next relationship is with Chance Chancellor (John Driscoll), Jill's grandson who is a virgin. Speaking of the developing romance, John Driscoll said, [...] "At this point Chloe is the object of his affection, and he is attracted to her. He is very interested in her because she has a very rocky background, but through and through she has just been herself. He respects her, and there is a spark and energy between them." [...] Chance loses his virginity to Chloe and they become engaged, though she develops into a [...] "clingy" [...] fiancé. The relationship ends after he cheats on her with Heather Stevens (Eden Riegel). Soon after, Chance fakes his death and enters the Witness Protection Program. Of Chloe's [...] "heartbroken" [...] reaction to his [...] "death" [...] in spite of the bitter break-up, Hendrickson said, [...] "to open up and show what was going on with <b>her</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> great release for me, because that entire time she was remaining strong and stable, and like no one is going to mess with her.
