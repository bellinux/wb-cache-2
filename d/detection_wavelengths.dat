5000|$|Due {{to their}} high surface roughness, {{conventional}} white nitrocellulose films scatter and reflect {{large amounts of}} excitation and emission light during the fluorescence detection in the microarray scanner. In addition, nitrocellulose exhibits a natural autofluorescence at the <b>detection</b> <b>wavelengths</b> commonly used. Both these factors {{lead to a high}} background fluorescent signal from these membrane slides. To overcome this problem, a new process has been developed to generate black membranes that absorb the scattered light, significantly reducing the background auto-fluorescence and thus offering a very low and homogenous auto-fluorescence to achieve a significantly improved dynamic range. These slides are commercially available through Schott AG. [...] Nevertheless, conventional white nitrocellulose films continue to be the dominant surface for many protein microarray applications because the claims above have not proved relevant to end user requirements. Regardless, nitrocellulose slide manufacturers like Grace Bio-Labs continue to develop new nitrocellulose surfaces to further optimize their use in protein microarrays.|$|E

40|$|Absorption and {{scattering}} of laser-induced incandescence (LII) intensities by soot particles present between the measurement volume and the detector were numerically investigated at <b>detection</b> <b>wavelengths</b> of 400 and 780 nm in a laminar coflow ethylene/air flame. The radiative properties of aggregated soot particles were calculated using the Rayleigh-Debye-Gans polydisperse fractal aggregate theory. The radiative transfer equation in emitting, absorbing, and scattering media was solved using the discrete-ordinates method. The radiation intensity along an arbitrary direction was obtained using the infinitely small weight technique. The effects of absorption and scattering on LII intensities {{are found to}} be significant under the conditions of this study, especially at the shorter detection wavelength and when the soot volume fraction is higher. Such a wavelength-dependent signal-trapping effect leads to a lower soot particle temperature estimated from the ratio of uncorrected LII intensities at the two <b>detection</b> <b>wavelengths.</b> The corresponding soot volume fraction derived from the absolute LII intensity technique is overestimated.

Firstly, the <b>detection</b> <b>wavelength</b> and the {{wave function}} overlap are investigated in dependence on the InAs and InxGa 1 -xSb layer thicknesses, the In mole fraction, and the periodic number.

We have recently developed wavelength-selective uncooled IR sensors using square lattice two-dimensional plasmonic absorbers (2 -D PLAs). The PLAs consist of a periodic 2 -D lattice of Au-based dimples, which allow photons to be manipulated using surface plasmon modes. In the present study, a detailed investigation into control of the <b>detection</b> <b>wavelength</b> was conducted by varying the PLA lattice structure. A comparison was made between wavelength-selective uncooled IR sensors with triangular and square PLA lattices that were fabricated using complementary metal oxide semiconductor and micromachining techniques. Selective enhancement of the responsivity could be achieved, and the <b>detection</b> <b>wavelength</b> for the triangular lattice was shorter than that for the square lattice.
