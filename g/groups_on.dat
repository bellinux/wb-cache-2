5|$|Coprinellus disseminatus resembles C.impatiens, {{but may be}} {{distinguished}} by its slightly larger fruit body, somewhat deliquescent gills, and tendency to fruit in smaller <b>groups</b> <b>on</b> the ground, rather than on or around rotting wood. Also, C.disseminatus has smaller spores than C.impatiens, typically 6.6–9.7 by 4.1–5.8μm. C.eurysporus is similar to C.disseminatus but usually grows in <b>groups</b> <b>on</b> fallen branches, and has broader spores that measure 8.3–10.3 by 6.7–8.4µm. C.hiascens usually grows in small dense clumps, has narrower spores (typically 9–11 by 4.5–5.5μm, and produces smaller fruit bodies.|$|E

5|$|A {{saprobic}} species, Entoloma murrayi derives nutrients {{by breaking}} down organic matter.

5|$|Although Kasuya did not {{explicitly}} define {{the mode of}} nutrition for A.coccinea, most Phallaceae species are suspected to be saprobic—decomposers of wood and plant organic matter.

5|$|Bacteria exhibit an {{extremely}} {{wide variety of}} metabolic types. The distribution of metabolic traits within a group of bacteria has traditionally been used to define their taxonomy, but these traits often do not correspond with modern genetic classifications. Bacterial metabolism is classified into nutritional <b>groups</b> <b>on</b> the basis of three major criteria: the kind of energy used for growth, the source of carbon, and the electron donors used for growth. An additional criterion of respiratory microorganisms are the electron acceptors used for aerobic or anaerobic respiration.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} Cervus elaphus aquapuncuture and Ginseng Radix aquapuncuture on the growth, protein {{efficiency}} ratio, contents of total protein, total cholesterol, and triglyceride in serum were studied for thirty four days.

Weight significantly increased in 0. 3 % Cervus elaphus aquapuncture <b>group</b> <b>on</b> Chunchu loci and in 0. 2 % Ginseng Radix aquapuncture <b>group</b> <b>on</b> Chunchu loci compared to normal saline aquapuncture <b>group</b> <b>on</b> Chunchu loci. 2.

Total protein significantly increased in 0. 2 % and 0. 3 % of Cervus elaphus aquapuncture <b>group</b> <b>on</b> Chunchu loci compared to nonnal saline aqriapuncture On Chunchu loci. whereas {{it had a}} tendency to increase in 0. 2 % Ginseng Radix aquapuncture <b>group</b> <b>on</b> Chunchu loci compared to normal saline aquapuncture <b>group</b> <b>on</b> Chunchu loci. 4. Total cholesterol increased a little in 0. 3 % Cervus elaphus aquapuncture <b>group</b> <b>on</b> Chunchu loci compared to normal saline aquapuncture <b>group</b> <b>on</b> Chunchu loci. 5. Triglyceride significantly increased in 0. 2 % Ginseng Radix aqua puncture <b>group</b> <b>on</b> Chunchu loci compared to normal saline aquapuncture <b>group</b> <b>on</b> Chunchu loci. Significance was acknowledged in the effect by density difference of medicines. In the Cervus elaphus group, there was the most significant increase in density of 0. 3 % aquapuncture, whereas in Ginseng Radix group, there was the most significant increase in density of 0. 2 % aquapuncture. So setting up density of medicines is important and many various studies for clinical application are required...|$|R
