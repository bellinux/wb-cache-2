5|$|Dunhill {{was born}} on 30 September 1872 at 2 Church Path, Hornsey, Middlesex. He was the second son of five {{children}} of Henry Dunhill (1842–1901), a master blind-maker, {{and his wife and}} cousin, Jane, née Styles (1843–1922). His father occupied premises on Euston Road, manufacturing <b>harnesses</b> for horses. Alfred Dunhill was educated at a private school in Hampstead and by tutors until he was 15, when he was apprenticed to his father's business.|$|E
5|$|Founded in 2015, Donecle, a Toulouse {{start-up}} company, {{has also}} launched a drone approach which was initially specialized in {{the detection of}} lightning strikes on aeroplanes. Performed by five people equipped with <b>harnesses</b> and platforms, this inspection usually takes about eight hours. The immobilization of the aircraft and the staff are costly for the airlines, estimated at $10 000 per hour. The solution proposed by the start-up lasts twenty minutes.|$|E
5|$|In {{the opening}} scene, young {{children}} tell their {{versions of the}} invasion. They draw pictures of their families, kids with <b>harnesses</b> and the alien airships. Tom Mason's (Noah Wyle) son, Matt, tells Anne Glass (Moon Bloodgood) that his mother died during the attacks and his older brother, Ben, was kidnapped. He then shows her {{a picture of his}} father and oldest brother, Hal (Drew Roy). Matt informs Anne that they are fighting.|$|E
50|$|Putting <b>harness</b> on a {{horse is}} called <b>harnessing</b> or <b>harnessing</b> up. Attaching the <b>harness</b> to the load is called putting to (British Isles) or {{hitching}} (North America). The order of putting on <b>harness</b> components varies by discipline, but when a horse collar is used, it is usually put on first.|$|R
50|$|Full-body <b>harness,</b> the {{combination}} of a sit <b>harness</b> and a chest <b>harness</b> which are permanently or semi-permanently connected to each other. This kind of <b>harness</b> normally offers a wide range of attachment points. It is most commonly used in industrial/rescue situations.|$|R

This kind of <b>harness</b> normally offers a wide range of attachment points. It is most commonly used in industrial/rescue situations, and also commonly used by small children instead of a sit <b>harness</b> which is easier to slip out of.|$|R
5|$|Many of the Quest's {{rules are}} {{intended}} to ensure the health of dogs in hazardous conditions. This process begins before the race, when all dogs must be examined by race veterinarians, who certify that the animals are suited and healthy enough to participate. Before the race, dog equipment also must be checked by race officials. Padded <b>harnesses</b> are required, each musher must carry an appropriate amount of food, and additional food supplies must be in position at checkpoints.|$|E
5|$|One of the depot's wartime {{commanding}} officers was Wing Commander John Lerew, {{who held}} the post from December 1942 until November 1943. During his tenure, after investigating the crash of a Vultee Vengeance, he designed a clip to prevent the accidental release of the pilot's safety harness, which was later adopted for all such <b>harnesses.</b> By January 1945, No.1 AD's strength had increased to its highest level of 2,339 staff.|$|E
5|$|Assisting {{him on this}} Far Eastern Party {{would be}} Belgrave Edward Sutton Ninnis, a {{lieutenant}} in the Royal Fusiliers, and the Swiss ski expert Xavier Mertz. They {{were in charge of}} the expedition's sledge dogs—Greenland Huskies—who would be crucial if the party was to cover the distance at the speed Mawson intended. Ninnis and Mertz had spent the winter preparing the dogs for the journey, sewing <b>harnesses</b> and teaching them to run in teams with the sledges. Each of the parties was required to return to Cape Denison by 15 January 1913, to allow time for the Aurora to collect them and escape Antarctic waters unencumbered by the winter sea ice.|$|E

50|$|Safety is {{the biggest}} {{consideration}} for tree stands. A body <b>harness</b> {{is the most important}} part of tree stand safety. Many different styles of <b>harness</b> can keep hunters safe. One <b>harness</b> compiled of a belt around the waist of the person and one around tree with a strap between the two can keep the hunter safe. Another <b>harness</b> is a full body <b>harness,</b> which has shoulder straps and straps around the legs. The full body <b>harness</b> attaches to the tree the same way the belt <b>harness</b> does. Attaching the <b>harness</b> as soon as the hunter is in the tree keeps the hunter safe while setting up for the hunt. The strap between the <b>harness</b> and strap around the tree should be long enough to allow the hunter to move a little and short enough so if the hunter falls they do not fall too far.|$|R
50|$|A normal {{climbing}} <b>harness</b> is used. Children {{and people}} with heavy backpacks are advised to use a full body <b>harness</b> or a normal <b>harness</b> combined with a chest strap.|$|R
5|$|Christie (Gary Dourdan), an adept mercenary, is second-in-command of the Betty. After Call is apprehended and {{the crew}} rounded up for execution, Christie uses his hidden pair of pistols to shoot {{them out of their}} situation. When the crew goes underwater, Christie <b>harnesses</b> Vriess to his back and swims to the opening (which puts them {{in the middle of a}} clutch of Alien eggs). Fleeing from the attacking Aliens, Christie is injured and his foot is snagged by an Alien. He saves Vriess by {{detaching}} himself, allowing Christie to fall into the water below, sacrificing himself.|$|E
5|$|In a Christianized version, the duel {{involves}} the Christian St.Elijah and the ala, {{but there is}} a belief that the saint and the dragons in fact cooperate: as soon as St.Elijah spots an ala, he summons the dragons, either takes them aboard his chariot or <b>harnesses</b> them to it, and they jointly shoot the ala with lightning. Arrow-shaped stones, like belemnites or stone-age arrowheads, are regarded as materialized lightning bolts imbued with a beneficial magical power, and finding one is a good omen.|$|E
5|$|Nanda and Hiranandani {{proved to}} be {{instrumental}} in taking Vikrant to war. There were objections that the ship might have severe operational difficulties that would expose the carrier to increased danger on operations. In addition, the three s acquired by the Pakistan Navy posed a significant risk to the carrier. In June, extensive deep sea trials were carried out, with steel safety <b>harnesses</b> around the three boilers still operational. Observation windows were fitted as a precautionary measure, to detect any steam leaks. By the end of June, the trials were complete and Vikrant was cleared to participate on operations, with its speed restricted to 14 knots.|$|E

50|$|Henry Drury <b>Harness</b> was son of John <b>Harness,</b> M.D., {{commissioner}} of the Transport Board; William <b>Harness</b> was his elder brother. Henry Drury <b>Harness</b> graduated from the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich in 1825, but had to wait two years for a commission. During this interim period he studied mining engineering at silver mines in Mexico.|$|R
5|$|The {{fire station}} {{contained}} flats for 32 firemen {{and their families}} and 6 single firemen. Facilities included a laundry, gym, billiards room and children's play-areas. The complex contained stables for the horses that pulled the fire appliances, and a blacksmith's workshop. There were electric bells and lights to alert firemen to an alarm, poles to expedite the firemen's response, suspended <b>harnesses</b> to allow the horses to be harnessed quickly, and electric doors. The fire station was also designed with foresight; the appliance bays were made wide enough to take motorised fire appliances. The station's first motorised fire appliance arrived in 1911, five years after it opened.|$|E
5|$|Weapons used by {{the space}} marines were based on fully {{functional}} weapons. British armorers used guns they {{found to be the}} most reliable when firing blanks and those which looked futuristic. The 'pulse rifles' were created from a Thompson SMG, with an attached forend of a Franchi SPAS-12 shotgun and a Remington 12 Gauge Model 870P receiver with barrel. The 'smart guns' carried by Vasquez and Drake were based on the German MG-42 machine gun and were maneuvered with Steadicam-like <b>harnesses</b> created using old motorcycle parts. The crew found flamethrowers the most difficult weapon to create and use, as they were the heaviest and most dangerous.|$|E
5|$|Bouldering {{is a form}} of rock {{climbing}} that is performed on large boulders, small rock formations or artificial rock walls, without the use of ropes or <b>harnesses.</b> While it can be done without any equipment whatsoever, most climbers use climbing shoes to help secure footholds, chalk to keep their hands dry and provide a firmer grip, and bouldering mats to prevent injuries from falls. Unlike free solo climbing, which is also performed without ropes, bouldering problems (the path that a climber takes in order to complete the climb) are usually less than 6 meters (20ft.) tall. Artificial climbing walls allow boulderers to train indoors in areas without natural boulders. Bouldering competitions, which employ a variety of formats, take place in both indoor and outdoor settings.|$|E

30|$|At our institution, the {{treatment}} protocol begins with Pavlik <b>harness</b> application {{in the clinic}} by experienced clinicians. Although the <b>harness</b> is typically used 24  h/day {{in the early stages}} of treatment until the hip is stable, we then offer parents the opportunity to briefly remove the <b>harness</b> for bathing as treatment progresses. However, removal of the <b>harness</b> is not commonly advised in a truly dislocated hip during the first 2 – 3  weeks until improved stability is confirmed by the treating clinician and does not occur at our institution until 5  weeks from stability being noted. Some institutions also plan for progressive weaning of the <b>harness</b> at later stages of treatment. For daily bathing and <b>harness</b> weaning, parents are responsible for removing and reapplying the Pavlik <b>harness</b> at home. Successful reapplication of the <b>harness</b> by the parents is therefore essential to ensure the hips are maintained in a therapeutic position.|$|R

5|$|Since so {{many new}} sets had to be created, the {{production}} commenced filming with location photography. Four days were spent in the Titan Missile Museum, south of Tucson, Arizona—the disarmed nuclear missile was fitted with a fiberglass capsule shell to stand in for the Phoenixs booster and command module. The old missile silo provided a large set that the budget would have prohibited building from scratch, but the small size created difficulties. Each camera move was planned in advance to work around areas where the lighting would be added, and electricians and grips donned rock-climbing <b>harnesses</b> to move down the shaft and attach the lights. To give greater dimension to the rocket and lend the missile a futuristic appearance, Leonetti chose to offset the missile's metallic surface with complementary colors. Using different-colored gels made the rocket appear longer than it actually was; to complete the effect, shots from the Phoenixs nose downwards and from the engines up were filmed with a 30mm lens to lengthen the missile.|$|E
5|$|Superman: Ultimate Flight is a steel flying {{roller coaster}} {{designed}} by Bolliger & Mabillard. Themed {{to the popular}} comic book character, Superman: Ultimate Flight has been installed at three Six Flags theme parks around the United States: Six Flags Over Georgia, Six Flags Great Adventure and Six Flags Great America. The first of these was at Six Flags Over Georgia, which interacts with the terrain {{much more than the}} other two. Superman: Ultimate Flight simulates flying by positioning its passengers parallel to the track, supported by <b>harnesses</b> and facing the ground through most of the ride. In the station, riders board the train sitting down. After the train is locked and checked, the trains are raised into the flying position. After the ride, the seats are lowered back into the sitting position for the next round of riders.|$|E
5|$|The MP 40 submachine {{guns are}} open-bolt, blowback-operated {{automatic}} arms. The only mode of fire was fully automatic, but {{the relatively low}} rate of fire enabled single shots with controlled trigger pulls. The bolt features a telescoping return spring guide {{which serves as a}} pneumatic recoil buffer. The cocking handle was permanently attached to the bolt on early MP 38s, but on late production MP 38s and MP 40s, the bolt handle was made as a separate part. It also served as a safety by pushing the head of handle into one of two separate notches above the main opening; this action locked the bolt either in the cocked (rear) or uncocked (forward) position. The absence of this feature on early MP 38s resulted in field expedients such as leather <b>harnesses</b> with a small loop, used to hold the bolt in forward position.|$|E

30|$|The {{time taken}} {{for the parents}} in the test group to apply the <b>harness</b> {{increased}} after watching the instructional video. The reason for this was because numerous essential steps were initially omitted by the parents, such as measuring the chest to evaluate the correct size of <b>harness,</b> undressing the infant prior to <b>harness</b> application, and/or marking the straps on the <b>harness</b> for reapplication. These steps were learned and performed after exposure to the learning module, and therefore the process took longer, as parents were more thorough in <b>harness</b> application. However, we would expect the clinician to determine {{the size of the}} <b>harness</b> at the outset of treatment and to explain to the parent any changes made to the <b>harness</b> throughout treatment. The parents in the control group took less time to apply the <b>harness</b> for the second time. This is likely to have been because the parents were more familiar with the Pavlik <b>harness</b> and so had a clearer idea of how to approach it. These findings demonstrate how exposure to the <b>harness</b> alone can alter the outcome of the application process. The decrease in time needed to apply the Pavlik <b>harness</b> for the control group did not correlate with an improvement in proper application, as there was no increase in scores on either their performance or quality of product.|$|R
5|$|The {{weaponry}} {{and equipment}} of the Australian Army had mostly been standardised on that {{used by the}} British Army prior to the outbreak of World War I. Meanwhile, in the {{years prior to the}} war basic defence industries had been established in Australia for the production of uniforms, webbing, boots, small arms and explosives and ammunition. Despite this, the majority of the equipment initially issued came from British Army stocks until Australian production was able to be increased to meet the demand that resulted from rapid military expansion {{at the start of the}} war. These included such items as heliographs, water bottles, bits, stirrups, spurs and shovels, although saddlery and <b>harnesses</b> were provided by a local government manufacturer. Although Australia had a relatively limited industrial base during the war, it was ultimately able to supply the majority of the Army's more simple requirements; however, the remainder of the more complex equipment had to be purchased from suppliers in Britain.|$|E
5|$|Two predatory lenders awaken {{on either}} side of a room split by a caged-in scale, wearing head <b>harnesses</b> with screws poised to pierce their temples. The one who sets more flesh weight upon their tray will survive. Eddie cuts fat from his torso, but Simone chops off her arm, and Eddie is killed when the timer expires. As he reviews the game's footage, Detective Lieutenant Mark Hoffman is called to the scene by FBI Agent Dan Erickson, who has found Peter Strahm's fingerprints. Also present is Lindsey Perez, whose {{survival}} was covered up by Erickson for her protection. They learn from Dr. Adam Heffner, the coroner who performed all of the autopsies for the case thus far, that the knife used to cut the jigsaw piece from Eddie's flesh was only used once before, on Seth Baxter. The agents intend to find the Baxter audio tape to prove Strahm's involvement.|$|E
5|$|The {{shell of}} Cloud Gate was fully erected {{for the grand}} opening of Millennium Park on July 15, 2004, {{although}} it was unpolished and thus unfinished, because its assembly had fallen behind schedule. The piece was temporarily uncovered on July 8 for the opening, although Kapoor was unhappy with this as it allowed the public to see the sculpture in an unfinished state. The original plan was to re-erect the tent around the sculpture for polishing on July 24, but public appreciation for the piece convinced park officials to leave it uncovered for several months. The tent was again erected in January 2005 as a 24-person crew from Ironworkers Local 63 polished the seams between each plate. In order to grind, sand and polish the seams, six levels of scaffolding were erected around {{the sides of the}} sculpture, while climbing ropes and <b>harnesses</b> were used to polish harder-to-reach areas. When the upper and side portions of the shell were completed, the tent was once again removed in August 2005. On October 3, the omphalos was closed off as workers polished the final section. Every weld on the Cloud Gate underwent a five-stage process, required to produce the sculpture's mirror-like finish.|$|E
