25|$|The D type was {{modified}} {{for use on}} unarmed, long-range photo-reconnaissance versions of the Spitfire, such as the P.R. Mk Id (P.R. versions {{described in more detail}} below), with weapon bays left empty, and the relatively heavy-skinned leading edge wing structure ahead of the main spar converted to integral auxiliary fuel tanks capable of carrying 66½ Imperial gallons (300 l) in addition to that stored in the fuselage tanks ahead of the cockpit. The filler caps were well outboard, between ribs 19 and 20 on the leading edge, because the wing tips were higher {{than the rest of the}} wing due to dihedral, and thus the only place a fuel <b>filler</b> <b>cap</b> could be located. An expansion and overflow vent was fitted to protect the tanks from bursting as the fuel vaporized and expanded from the hot sun beating directly on the thin metal wing skin (which doubled as the walls of the tank). This vent was fitted further outboard, between ribs 20 and 21, in the highest space in the tank, where vapor would naturally collect.|$|E

The slick-shod wheels are new forged-magnesium center-lock models, which in conjunction with on-board pneumatic airjacks (again, like the FXX) allow rapid change of the entire wheel assemblies.|$|E
2500|$|Leyland's {{corporate}} badge, {{a design}} {{based on the}} spokes of a wheel, appeared on the hubcaps of the 1500FWD, and next to the Triumph name on the metal identification labels fitted to the bootlids of various models. It was also used for the oil <b>filler</b> <b>cap</b> on the Dolomite Sprint engine. However it was never used as a bonnet badge, with models of that era such as the TR6 and the second generation 2000 carrying a badge simply stating the name [...] "Triumph".|$|E

Hudson Ramblers also received [...] "H" [...] symbols on fuel <b>filler</b> <b>caps</b> (and, in 1956, also on hubcaps). For 1957, Rambler and Metropolitan became makes in their own rights, and no longer {{were identified as}} Hudson or Nash.|$|R
2500|$|Riding {{the same}} {{wheelbase}} as the sedan, the liftback was {{identical to the}} sedan from the A-pillar forward and featured a sloping roof (compromising rear headroom) and a hatchback with a more shallow Kammback tail. The rear license plate hid the fuel <b>filler</b> <b>cap.</b> The Spirit offered a generous cruising range with its [...] "fuel tank capacity of 21 gallons and probable fuel mileage of 25 mpg or more... enabling the car's driver to travel over 500 miles between fill ups".|$|E
2500|$|The road racing {{version of}} the XR-750 used an {{aluminum}} oil tank, had a [...] fiberglass fuel tank, and a fiberglass fairing which included extra heat shielding to protect the rider's left leg when riding in a tuck position. On the top center of the fuel tank was a leather pad with a round cutout for the left-side fuel <b>filler</b> <b>cap.</b> Like the dirt tracker, it used a Ceriani fork and Girling shocks, two 36mm Mikuni carburetors and tuned dual reverse cone exhaust. Instrumentation consisted of a Smiths tachometer.|$|E
2500|$|The Arrowbile first flew on 21 February 1937, {{making it}} a close {{contemporary}} of the Gwinn Aircar, and a second prototype {{with a number of}} minor modifications followed. [...] Studebaker were interested in the Arrowbile because of the use of their engine and ordered five. [...] The third Arrowbile was the first of this order. However there was little market response and the line was halted in 1938, with no more production aircraft completed. [...] The production aircraft had several changes, some of which aimed to emphasise the similarities with cars; there was a radiator grille with a single headlight centrally above it and also car type doors and petrol <b>filler</b> <b>cap.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{the pursuit}} of power, the 4½ Litre Bentley engine had a {{distinct}} advantage. A single overhead camshaft actuated four valves per cylinder, inclined at 30 degrees, a technically advanced design at a time where most cars used only two valves per cylinder. Secondly the cars tanks - radiator, oil and petrol - had <b>filler</b> <b>caps</b> that did not unscrew but were easily removed with one stroke of a lever. This saved time during stops.|$|R
50|$|Vibration and {{low-speed}} crash tests ensured {{the cars}} would not shift or suffer damage in transit. The Vega was delivered topped with fluids, ready {{to drive to}} dealerships, so the engine was baffled to prevent oil entering the number one cylinder; the battery <b>filler</b> <b>caps</b> high on the rear edge of the casing prevented acid spills; a tube drained fuel from carburetor to vapor canister; and the windshield washer bottle stood at 45 degrees.|$|R
2500|$|Early K-M20 {{models from}} 1939 {{were made from}} {{standard}} civilian parts {{with the addition of}} military fittings, such as a [...] large 8-inch Lucas DUl42 headlight (fitted with a black out mask), a timing-gear cover with a screw-in plug for access to the magneto drive-pinion nut and special <b>filler</b> <b>caps</b> for the petrol and oil tanks. These early military M20 models were also fitted with a long spiked prop stand on the rear nearside pivoted from a lug brazed on to the rear frame tube. Factory ledgers show that BSA exported K-M20 models to Sweden, South Africa and India, as well as civilian dealers and distributors.|$|R
2500|$|In Europe, GT86 {{models are}} {{generally}} {{the same as}} the Japanese 86 GT with a red/black leather/Alcantara interior with red stitching. In the United Kingdom, the Japanese G model is sold as the GT86 Primo and the car has also been available as a limited edition Toyota Racing Development [...] "TRD GT86", which features: 18inch forged aluminium wheels with Yokohama Advan Sport tyres; full bodykit with front and side skirts, rear spoiler and new diffuser; quad-exhaust system; TRD-branded detailing on the <b>filler</b> <b>cap,</b> radiator cap and gear knob. In New Zealand, the TRD 86 is sold with the above features except for Michelin Pilot Sport 3 tyres instead plus upgraded TRD braking system.

2500|$|The {{front end}} of the Range Rover was revamped in 1986. This brought a more pedestrian-friendly plastic grille with {{horizontal}} slats, and optional front valance with two fog lights. The seat base was lowered and door handles were redesigned, making it more difficult for rear passengers but greatly improving the comfort for taller people in the front. The dashboard switchgear was updated again, now featuring steering column stalks from the Austin Montego, and other miscellaneous items from the Austin Rover car range. [...] Other changes included the windows, tailgate and bonnet, but none of those affected the general design. Bonnet and door hinges gradually evolved out of sight and the fuel <b>filler</b> <b>cap</b> was hidden behind a hinged flap. [...] The last major change to the interior took place in 1994, when the Range Rover was re-designated [...] "Classic" [...] upon the arrival of the replacement P38A version. The car gained a 'soft feel' safety dashboard (derived from that used in the facelifted Series 1 Discovery) with new switches (this time lifted from the Rover 800) and instruments. [...] These end of the line models are popularly called [...] "soft dash" [...] models by the motor trade and by enthusiasts to distinguish them from other members of the Range Rover Classic series.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the bodies and frames, Devin sold a growing assortment of accessories needed to complete the car. Some of these items were developed by Devin Enterprises, such as hinges and catches. One piece of advertising copy from 1960 lists a [...] "universal" [...] intake manifold for the Chevrolet V8 {{as well as a}} finned alloy differential housing for a de Dion rear suspension. Other items sold included everything from suspension parts, disk brakes or finned alloy brake drums up to wood-rimmed steering wheels, flip-up <b>filler</b> <b>caps</b> for fuel or oil tanks, Borrani wire wheels with knock-offs, custom gauges, and BID clutch plates.|$|R
50|$|Below the seats, {{there is}} {{access to the}} petrol tank <b>filler</b> <b>caps</b> along with a locker for gear such as a foot pump and an aerosol fog horn. A set of flares is stored aboard with red for {{distress}} and white flares which slowly descends on a parachute illuminating a large area. In case of technical difficulties with the navigation equipment, the crew can revert to using a set of waterproof charts of the local area which are also stored in pockets in the console. To {{the rear of the}} console is the 35 m towing rope on a reel which is used in conjunction with the tow bar to tow stricken vessels to safety.|$|R
50|$|At {{the front}} of the car a new bumper removed the original’s fake central grille and also {{replaced}} the Ferrari prancing horse emblem. The side intake cooling ducts were enlarged and the engine cover was replaced with a glass item allowing a view of the V8 engine. A new triple tail-light arrangement and an electronically operated spoiler were added. A double bubble roof was added, the idea being that Zagato could lower the roofline of a car, but retain enough headroom for each occupant. Other modifications included custom OZ Racing alloy wheels, external fuel <b>filler</b> <b>caps</b> and a completely reworked interior including a three-inch rear view screen and suede upholstery. Zagato initially announced a production run of 22 examples, but only 10 or 12 cars were made.|$|R
2500|$|In 2002, {{a concept}} Bel Air {{convertible}} was {{shown at the}} North American International Auto Show. It features a few styling and design cues from the best remembered tri-five (1955–57) models, such as the chrome windshield frame, traffic light viewfinder, and a gas <b>filler</b> <b>cap</b> behind the tail light, similar to 1956–1957 Chevy's gas cap behind the chrome trim {{on the back of}} the tail fin, but more reminiscent of the 1948–1958 Cadillac gas cap tail light. It also features the same body on frame hydroforming technology (used in the frame rails of the Corvette and GM’s midsize sport-utility vehicles) and a sheet metal body, on a [...] wheelbase, and a [...] track. Suspension is short long arm up front and Hotchkiss drive in the rear. It rides on five-spoke aluminum wheels with [...] red line tires and anti lock discs all-round. The elegant, yet simple interior features a twin-element instrument panel, column-mounted gearshift and bench seats covered in soft high-tech fabrics colored red to match the exterior that are cleverly designed to slide forward for easier backseat entry. It also served as a showcase for their new turbocharged inline five-cylinder concept engine based on the L52 (Vortec 3500), straight-5 truck engine. According to a September 2002 GM press release, the all-aluminum 3.5L (211 cu in) 20-valve DOHC engine, with a bore of 93.0mm (3.7in), and a stroke of 102.0mm (4in), that delivers up to 315 horsepower and [...] of torque, mated to a Hydra-Matic 4L60-E electronically controlled four-speed automatic. A virtual [...] "turbo boost" [...] button on the steering wheel activates the powertrain control module to trigger a more aggressive spark and fueling calibration for maximum horsepower. It also led the 13th Annual Stater Brothers Route 66 Rendezvous as the official vehicle in September 2002. General Motors has shown no interest in producing the car.|$|E

The MG Maestros gained electronic fuel-injected [...] versions of the 2-litre O-Series engine, uprated suspension and ventilated front disc brakes, colour-keyed exterior trim, tinted glass, central locking and leather-trimmed steering wheels. The new MG Maestro offered much better performance and refinement than its predecessor.|$|R
5000|$|Smudge pot use in Redlands, California groves {{continued}} into the 1970s, but fell out of favor as oil prices rose and environmental concerns increased. Pots came in two major styles: a single stack above a fuel oil-filled base, and a slightly taller version that featured a [...] neck and a re-breather feed pipe {{out of the side}} of the chimney that siphoned stack gas back into the burn chamber and produced more complete combustion. <b>Filler</b> <b>caps</b> have a three- or four-hole flue control. The stem into the pot usually has a piece of oil-soaked wood secured inside the neck to aid in lighting the pot. Pots are ignited when the air temperature reaches 29 degrees Fahrenheit (-2 Celsius), and for each additional degree of drop, another hole is opened on the control cap. Below 25 degrees, nothing more can be done to enhance the heating effects.|$|R
25|$|The {{prototype}} car, SP 618000 {{was turned}} out in December, 1968 and tested through 1969. Chevrolet conducted vibration and low-speed crash tests to make sure nose-down Vegas wouldn't shift or be damaged in railcar collisions. Chevrolet's goal was to deliver Vegas topped with fluids and ready {{to drive to the}} dealership. To do this Vega engineers had to design a special engine oil baffle to prevent oil from entering the No. 1 cylinder, batteries had <b>filler</b> <b>caps</b> located high up on the rear edge of the case to prevent acid spilling, the carburetor float bowl had a special tube that drained gasoline into the vapor canister during shipment, and the windshield washer bottle stood at a 45 degree angle. Plastic spacers were wedged in beside the powertrain to prevent damage to engine and transmission mounts. The wedges were removed when cars were unloaded. The rail car doors were opened and closed by means of a forklift truck.|$|R

500|$|Bulleid {{designed}} a new [...] tender which could carry 5 tons (5.1 t) of coal on a six-wheel chassis. [...] It featured BFB wheels and streamlined panels, or [...] "raves", {{that gave the}} top of the tender a similar cross-sectional outline to the carriages hauled by the locomotive. [...] The water tank was of welded sheet construction to save weight, and the tender was fitted with vacuum braking equipment of a clasp-type similar to that used on the locomotive. [...] Three train-brake vacuum reservoirs of cylindrical construction were grouped on the tank top, behind the coal space. [...] Unusually for a British locomotive, two extra water <b>filler</b> <b>caps</b> were incorporated into the tender front, for access from the footplate. [...] The original tender design proved to be inadequately braced and subject to serious leakage if even slightly damaged, or when water surges caused the welded joints to split. [...] The problem was not solved until 1944 when additional baffling was fitted.|$|R
