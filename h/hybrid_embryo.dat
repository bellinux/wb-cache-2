60|$|The {{sterility}} {{of species}} when first crossed, {{and that of}} hybrids, may possibly depend {{to a certain extent}} on distinct causes. With pure species the reproductive organs are in a perfect condition, whilst with hybrids they are often plainly deteriorated. A <b>hybrid</b> <b>embryo</b> which partakes of the constitution of its father and mother is exposed to unnatural conditions, {{as long as it is}} nourished within the womb, or egg, or seed of the mother-form; and as we know that unnatural conditions often induce sterility, the reproductive organs of the hybrid might at this early age be permanently affected. But this cause has no bearing on the infertility of first unions. The diminished number of the offspring from first unions may often result, as is certainly sometimes the case, from the premature death of most of the hybrid embryos. But we shall immediately see that a law of an unknown nature apparently exists, which leads to the offspring from unions, which are infertile, being themselves more or less infertile; and this at present is all that can be said.|$|E
40|$|M. Agaba is ILRI authorInterspecies {{hybridization}} of bovids occurs between {{domestic cattle}} {{and at least}} three other species; American bison (Bison bison), yak (Bos grunniens) and banteng (Bos banteng). Birth of a cattle × buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) hybrid has reportedly occurred in Russia and in China, but these reports were not authenticated. Such hybrids could be important in improving livestock production and management of diseases that impede production in tropical Africa. This study investigated hybridization between cattle and its closest African wild bovid relative, the African buffalo (Syncerus caffer caffer). In an attempt to produce cattle × buffalo <b>hybrid</b> <b>embryos</b> in vitro, matured cattle oocytes were subjected to a standard in vitro fertilization (IVF) procedure with either homologous cattle (n = 1166 oocytes) or heterologous African buffalo (n = 1202 oocytes) frozen-thawed epididymal sperm. After IVF, 67. 2 % of the oocytes inseminated with the homologous cattle sperm cleaved. In contrast, fertilization with buffalo sperm resulted in only a 4. 6 % cleavage rate. The cleavage intervals were also slower in <b>hybrid</b> <b>embryos</b> than in the IVF-derived cattle embryos. Of the cleaved homologous cattle embryos 52. 2 % progressed to the morula stage compared with 12. 7 % for the buffalo <b>hybrid</b> <b>embryos.</b> No <b>hybrid</b> <b>embryos</b> developed beyond the early morula stage, while 40. 1 % of the cleaved cattle × cattle embryos developed to the blastocyst stage. Transfer of buffalo <b>hybrid</b> IVF <b>embryos</b> to domestic cattle surrogates resulted in no pregnancies at 60 days post-transfer. This study indicates that interspecies fertilization of cattle oocytes with African buffalo epididymal sperm can occur in vitro, and that a barrier to hybridization occurs {{in the early stages of}} embryonic development. Chromosomal disparity is likely the cause of the fertilization abnormalities, abnormal development and subsequent arrest impairing the formation of <b>hybrid</b> <b>embryos</b> beyond the early morula stage.
