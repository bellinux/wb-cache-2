25|$|Thus Maximilian {{through his}} own marriages and those of his {{descendants}} (attempted unsuccessfully and successfully alike) sought, as was current practice for dynastic states at the time, to extend his sphere of influence. The marriages he arranged for both of his children more successfully fulfilled the specific goal of thwarting French interests, and {{after the turn of}} the sixteenth century, his matchmaking focused on his grandchildren, for whom <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>away</b> from France towards the east.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>away,</b> chin in hand, {{his glance}} thoughtful, disturbed, almost wistful.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>away</b> {{with the}} ghost of an evil smile upon his lips.|$|E
50|$|Avon {{confirmed}} {{her death}} {{after returning to}} the ruined and collapsing tunnels. He was very certain when he tells Tarrant, his voice becoming softer, as it is often when talking to or about Cally, and then <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>away</b> in the distance.|$|R
50|$|During the trip, Takeru {{distances}} {{himself from}} Chieko by walking {{ahead of her}} and Minoru. Whilst on a forested mountain, he takes photographs and through his viewfinder, sees Minoru and Chieko talking on a suspension bridge over a gorge. <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>away</b> to take photographs of flowers.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> anxiously <b>away</b> {{towards the}} town and began to mumble. Trent was in despair. Presently he began again.|$|R
60|$|The Duke {{folded his}} hands nervously together. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>away</b> from me into the fire.|$|E
60|$|Their {{eyes met}} for a moment. Then <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>away.</b> He {{would say no}} more.|$|E
60|$|At {{the sound}} of Matravers' voice, the man started {{and looked at him}} earnestly. A dull red flush stained his cheeks. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>away.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Brand is not demonstrative," [...] said Felix. [...] "He {{is never}} demonstrative to me. He sits silent, {{with his chin}} in his hand, looking at me. Sometimes <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>away.</b> Your father tells me he is so eloquent; and I should like to hear him talk. <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> like such a noble young man. But with me he will never talk. And yet I am so fond of {{listening}} to brilliant imagery!" ...|$|R
6000|$|Moody rose {{slowly and}} looked at Old Sharon. [...] "Not just now, sir," [...] <b>he</b> replied, <b>looking</b> <b>away</b> again, after a moment's reflection.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{have been}} content!" [...] <b>he</b> admitted, <b>looking</b> <b>away</b> from her, <b>looking</b> {{out of the}} room. [...] "I have been content, after a fashion." ...|$|R
60|$|Just then Mrs. Hastings, unobserved {{by either}} of them, {{looked up and}} caught Sproatly's eye. His face became {{suddenly}} expressionless, and <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>away.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "That I {{have given}} all I {{have to give}} to another." [...] As he said this <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>away</b> sternly, over her shoulder, to the distance.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>away</b> {{from its}} dark outline {{with a little}} groan. Up on the {{hillside}} flashed the lights of Blackbird's Nest. He stretched out his hands and groped onwards.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> sighed, <b>looked</b> <b>away,</b> and {{remarked that}} it was time to put out the lamp in the saloon. The {{permission}} was only till ten o'clock.|$|R
60|$|He bowed at {{once and}} withdrew. She rose slowly {{to her feet and}} laid her fingers upon his arm. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> {{steadily}} <b>away</b> from her.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{remember}} your private instructions {{to my wife}} and myself, when you first brought Nanina to our house?" [...] <b>he</b> said, <b>looking</b> <b>away</b> rather uneasily while he spoke.|$|R
60|$|Mills {{had entered}} noiselessly, and was {{watching}} the proceedings at Sir Henry's desk with a distinct lack of favour. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>away</b> towards his mistress, however, as he replied.|$|E
60|$|Bill {{felt himself}} flushing. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>away</b> from her. He {{had a sense}} of almost {{unbearable}} guilt, {{as if he had just}} done some particularly low crime and was contemplating another.|$|E
60|$|Philip {{understood}} {{suddenly that}} the old man was frightened of dying. It made Philip a little ashamed, so that <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>away</b> involuntarily. He was always embarrassed by the weakness of human nature.|$|E
6000|$|<b>He</b> sat <b>looking</b> <b>away,</b> but <b>he</b> evidently had his idea, {{which he}} at last produced. [...] "Why wouldn't it {{be just the}} thing? It would exactly prove my purity." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> wearily <b>away.</b> Nevertheless my gaze disquieted him. He turned uneasily; he rose, {{waved his}} wings {{as if for}} flight, poised, then settled defiantly down again.|$|R
60|$|She nodded quickly her shamefaced head, and <b>he</b> waited, <b>looking</b> <b>away</b> from her, while, {{trembling}} {{all over}} and bowing her neck, she tried to find {{the pocket of her}} dress.|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Brand heard her; <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>away.</b> Mr. Wentworth, evidently, had no {{imagination}} at all. [...] "I {{have always}} thought," [...] he began, slowly, [...] "that Gertrude's character required a special line of development." ...|$|E
6000|$|Captain Tremayne {{looked up}} with a rueful smile. [...] "I thought you boasted that you never forced a confidence." [...] And then <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>away.</b> [...] "Sylvia Armytage tells me that she is {{thinking}} of returning to England." ...|$|E
6000|$|The slow waving {{of white}} {{feathers}} recommenced. He {{felt that she}} was looking at him; almost in spite of himself their eyes met. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>away</b> with hot cheeks and burning eyes. Was this girl a trained coquette, or---- ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Did {{you ever}} {{meet with a}} man of the name of Carr?" [...] asked Mat. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>away</b> from young Thorpe, keeping his eyes {{steadily}} on the rifle, and rubbing hard at the barrel, as he put this question.|$|E
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>away</b> at the mountains. [...] "I got rather used up last spring, and {{my doctor}} said I'd better {{come out here}} for a while and build up. I'm going up to Meeker's Mill. Do you know where that is?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{seems to}} me so hard {{that there should be}} such a gulf between you and me." [...] This he said after he had been silent for a while; and as he spoke <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>away</b> from her at the fire.|$|E
60|$|There was {{a little}} choking in her throat. She felt the rush of strange things. Her eyes sought his, filled with almost terrified anticipation. It chanced that <b>he</b> was <b>looking</b> <b>away.</b> She clenched her hands. His moment had passed.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know as I blame yeh for that, How," [...] said Grant slowly. It was {{the first}} time he had called Howard by his boyish nickname. His voice was softer, too, and higher in key. But <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> {{steadily}} <b>away.</b>|$|R
6000|$|<b>He</b> was <b>looking</b> <b>away</b> {{now into}} the night, {{but his voice}} quivered with the emotion that was in him. She was silent, and emboldened perhaps by that silence of hers, {{encouraged}} {{by the memory of}} what he had seen that morning reflected in her eyes: ...|$|R
