5|$|If {{the date}} and time of any solar eclipse are known, it is {{possible}} to predict other eclipses using eclipse cycles. The saros <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> known {{and one of the most}} accurate. A saros lasts 6,585.3 days (a little over 18 years), which means that, after this period, a practically identical eclipse will occur. The most notable difference will be a westward shift of about 120° in longitude (due to the 0.3 days) and a little in latitude (north-south for odd-numbered cycles, the reverse for even-numbered ones). A saros series always starts with a partial eclipse near one of Earth's polar regions, then shifts over the globe through a series of annular or total eclipses, and ends with a partial eclipse at the opposite polar region. A saros series lasts 1226 to 1550 years and 69 to 87 eclipses, with about 40 to 60 of them being central.|$|E
5|$|Paintings {{and other}} {{precious}} objects served an important {{aid in the}} religious life of those who could afford them. Prayer and meditative contemplation were means to attain salvation, while the very wealthy could also build churches (or extend existing ones), or commission artworks or other devotional pieces {{as a means to}} guarantee salvation in the afterlife. Vast numbers of Virgin and Child paintings were produced, and original designs were widely copied and exported. Many of the paintings were based on Byzantine prototypes of the 12th and 13th century, of which the Cambrai Madonna <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> known. In this way the traditions of the earlier centuries were absorbed and re-developed as a distinctly rich and complex iconographical tradition.|$|E

25|$|Kircher's {{interpretation}} of the hieroglyphs <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> known early modern European attempt at 'decipherment', not least for {{the nature of his}} claims. Another early attempt at translation was made by Johannes Goropius Becanus in the 16th century.|$|E
25|$|The most {{spectacular}} cactus displays are the 500 bright yellow-spined Golden Barrel Cactus (Echinocactus grusonii), the largest being more than 85 years old. They flower in the Spring, and are native to central Mexico. This <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> display of Golden Barrels in the world.|$|E
25|$|Out {{of all the}} {{educational}} and research facilities in Geneva, CERN (the European Organization for Nuclear Research) <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> known on a world basis and most recently renown for the Large Hadron Collider. Founded in 1954, CERN was one of Europe's first joint ventures and has developed as the world's largest particle physics laboratory. Physicists {{from around the world}} travel to CERN to research matter and explore the fundamental forces and materials that form the universe.|$|E

We love the electro-synth proggy era of the '80s, so the album has a lot of similarities to 1980's bands like The Cure, New Order, The Galvatrons and Van She. <b>The</b> last two <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> bands ever {{to come out of the}} '80s and possibly the history of the universe." ...|$|R

25|$|Whisky <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> {{known of}} Scotland's {{manufactured}} products. Exports have increased by 87% {{in the past}} decade and it contributes over £4.25billion to the UK economy, making up a quarter of all its food and drink revenues. It {{is also one of the}} UK's overall top five manufacturing export earners and it supports around 35,000 jobs. Principal whisky producing areas include Speyside and the Isle of Islay, where there are eight distilleries providing a major source of employment. In many places, the industry is closely linked to tourism, with many distilleries also functioning as attractions worth £30million GVA each year.|$|E
25|$|St James Park, {{most likely}} named after its road frontage, is {{predominantly}} used for croquet, cricket and soccer. It {{is probably one}} of the most beautiful parks in the city with tree lined walkways and gardens. The park in the heart of Papanui <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> location to see over-wintering monarch butterflies. On a warm sunny late autumn or early winter's day head to the children's play ground and look into the largely leafless old trees. There you will see monarchs clustering together often holding on to the remaining leaves for support. It ís a great spot for a picnic beneath the trees with monarchs fluttering in the air above.|$|E
25|$|Over ten {{thousand}} New Zealanders served as aircrew with the Royal Air Force, 3,290 of them lost their lives, and 580 were made prisoners of war. Three won Victoria crosses. While the majority served with squadrons composed of airmen {{from all parts}} of the Commonwealth, 7 squadrons of the Royal Air Force were designated New Zealand units, one of these, No. 75 Squadron RNZAF flew the most missions and suffered the highest casualties of any allied bomber squadron. Several New Zealanders rose to high rank in the Royal Air Force, of whom Air Vice Marshal Sir Keith Park, who commanded No 11 Group, Fighter Command which bore the brunt of the Battle of Britain, <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> known.|$|E

25|$|Whisky <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> {{known of}} Scotland's {{manufactured}} products. Exports have increased by 87% {{in the decade}} to 2012 and it contributes over £4.25 billion to the UK economy, making up {{a quarter of all}} its food and drink revenues. In 2012, the US was the largest market for Scotch whisky (£655 million), followed by France (£535 million). It {{is also one of the}} UK's overall top five manufacturing export earners and it supports around 35,000 jobs.

25|$|The Peace Testimony <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> known {{testimony}} of Friends. The belief {{that violence is}} wrong has persisted to this day, and many conscientious objectors, advocates of non-violence and anti-war activists are Friends. Because of their peace testimony, Friends are considered {{as one of the}} historic peace churches. In 1947 Friends as a worldwide religious group were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, which was accepted by the American Friends Service Committee and the then London Yearly Meeting's Friends Service Committee, now called Britain Yearly Meeting Peace & Social Witness on behalf of all Friends. The Peace Testimony has not always been well received in the world; on many occasions Friends have been imprisoned for refusing to serve in military activities.|$|E
25|$|Bernhard's son Peter Berngardovich Struve (1870–1944) <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> known {{member of}} the family in Russia. He {{was one of the first}} Russian marxists and penned the Manifesto of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party upon its {{creation}} in 1898. Even before the party split into Bolsheviks and Mensheviks, Struve left it for the Constitutional Democratic party, which promoted ideas of liberalism. He represented this party at all the pre-revolutionary State Dumas. After the Russian Revolution, he published several striking articles on its causes and joined the White movement. In the governments of Pyotr Wrangel and Denikin he was one of the ministers. During the following three decades, he lived in Paris, while his children were prominent in the Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia.|$|E

50|$|Alpine-Renault entered one 2.0L A441 C with an all-women team. As <b>the</b> A441 <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> 2.0L car of {{that era}} and 2.0L cars weren't much {{restrained}} by fuel limitation, this car was a serious outsider.|$|R
25|$|Payne proved {{impossible}} to contact to illustrate James the Red Engine – {{he had suffered}} from a nervous breakdown – and so C. Reginald Dalby was hired. Dalby also illustrated the next eight books in the series. The Three Railway Engines was reprinted with Dalby's artwork replacing William Middleton's and Dalby also touched up Payne's artwork in the second book. Dalby's work on the series proved popular with readers, {{but not with the}} author, who repeatedly clashed with him over issues of accuracy and consistency. Dalby resigned from the series in 1956, following an argument over the portrayal of Percy the Small Engine in the book of the same name. Awdry had built a model of Percy as a reference for the artist but Dalby didn't make use of it. Despite the tempestuous relationship with Awdry, Dalby <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> remembered of the series' artists.|$|E
25|$|Six {{years after}} the release of the final Republic serial, Dick Tracy headlined four feature films, {{produced}} by RKO Radio Pictures. Dick Tracy (a.k.a. Dick Tracy, Detective) (1945) was followed by Dick Tracy vs. Cueball in 1946, both with Morgan Conway as Tracy. Ralph Byrd returned for the last two features, both released in 1947: Dick Tracy's Dilemma and Dick Tracy Meets Gruesome. Gruesome <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> known of the four, with the villain portrayed by Boris Karloff. All four movies had many of the visual features associated with film noir: dramatic, shadowy photographic compositions, with many exterior scenes filmed at night (at the RKO Encino movie ranch). Lyle Latell co-starred in all four films as Pat Patton. Anne Jeffreys played Tess Trueheart in the first two, succeeded by Kay Christopher and finally Anne Gwynne; Ian Keith joined the cast as the actor Vitamin Flintheart for two films; Joseph Crehan played Chief Brandon. RKO stocked the films with familiar faces, creating a veritable rogues' gallery of characters: Mike Mazurki as Splitface, Dick Wessel as Cueball, Esther Howard as Filthy Flora, Jack Lambert as hook-handed villain The Claw; baldheaded, pop-eyed Milton Parsons, mild-mannered Byron Foulger, dangerous Trevor Bardette, pockmarked, gently sinister Skelton Knaggs.|$|E
500|$|When {{the second}} episode aired, {{transgender}} journalist Juliet Jacques posted her thoughts to the New Statesmans politics blog, The Staggers: [...] "At this point... the limited level of improvement in trans representation on TV shown by My Transsexual Summer <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> we can expect." [...] She felt the major barriers to better representation to be [...] "producers' prejudices about what viewers will accept or understand" [...] and extremely narrow bandwidth for [...] "minority subjects".|$|E
50|$|Domestic cats {{frequently}} use {{visual communication}} with their eyes, ears, mouths, tails, coats and body postures. It has been stated that a cat’s facial features change <b>the</b> most and <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> indicator of cat communication.|$|R
50|$|A {{review in}} The Examiner {{expressed}} an opinion that <b>the</b> show <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> magic TV show since David Blaine's show, Magic Man. Though the review also comments on The Supernaturalist's story possibly being predetermined and staged.|$|R

500|$|There is {{a variety}} of {{indigenous}} breeds, of which the diminutive Shetland pony <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> known, {{as well as being}} {{an important part of the}} Shetland farming tradition. [...] The first written record of the pony was in 1603 in the Court Books of Shetland and, for its size, it is the strongest of all the horse breeds. [...] Others are the Shetland Sheepdog or [...] "Sheltie", the endangered Shetland cattle and Shetland Goose and the Shetland sheep which is believed to have originated prior to 1000 AD. [...] The Grice was a breed of semi-domesticated pig that had a habit of attacking lambs, and that became extinct in 1930.|$|E
500|$|Born in London of Italian and French parentage, Barbirolli {{grew up in}} {{a family}} of {{professional}} musicians. [...] After starting out as a cellist, he was given the chance to conduct, from 1926 with the British National Opera Company, and then with Covent Garden's touring company. On taking up the conductorship of the Hallé he had less opportunity to work in the opera house, but in the 1950s he conducted productions of works by Verdi, Wagner, Gluck, and Puccini at Covent Garden with such success that he was invited to become the company's permanent musical director, an invitation he declined. Late in his career he made several recordings of operas, of which his 1967 set of Puccini's Madama Butterfly for EMI <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> known.|$|E
500|$|... "I Wanna Go" [...] {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. A reviewer for Samesame.com.au called [...] "I Wanna Go" [...] Spears' best song since [...] "Toxic", {{and added that}} [...] "I’d {{go so far as}} to say that it <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> song that she has ever recorded. [...] How the decision was made that 'Hold It Against Me' would be a better first single over this is baffling." [...] Parker Bruce of the Washington Square News stated that the song functions as [...] "a sort of formal declaration and mission statement" [...] for Femme Fatale, saying that [...] "It is not an innovative song, but it is fantastically effective and endlessly enticing with its liberating, toss-your-cares-away, dance-like-a-complete–and-utter-fool cathartic chorus, repeated words and typically saucy Britney lyrics." [...] The Daily Collegian writer Hannah Rishel said [...] "I Wanna Go" [...] would have been [...] "another good lead single", while The Washington Timess Andrew Leahey said that along with [...] "Till the World Ends", they are [...] "bass-heavy tributes to club culture." ...|$|E
