5|$|Climatic shifts {{may affect}} tornadoes via teleconnections in {{shifting}} the jet stream {{and the larger}} weather patterns. The climate-tornado link is confounded by the forces affecting larger patterns and by the local, nuanced nature of tornadoes. Although <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>to</b> suspect that global warming may affect trends in tornado activity, any such effect is not yet identifiable due to the complexity, local nature of the storms, and database quality issues. Any effect would vary by region.|$|E
5|$|Among {{investigators}} {{there is}} disagreement regarding the terminology {{used to describe}} the type of information carried by the accessory nerve. As the trapezius and sternocleidomastoid muscles are derived from the pharyngeal arches, some investigators believe the spinal accessory nerve that innervates them must carry specific special visceral efferent (SVE) information. This is in line with the observation that the spinal accessory nucleus appears to be continuous with the nucleus ambiguus of the medulla. Others, consider the spinal accessory nerve to carry general somatic efferent (GSE) information. Still others believe <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>to</b> conclude that the spinal accessory nerve contains both SVE and GSE components.|$|E
5|$|Appropriate {{antibiotics}} {{decrease the}} average 3–5 day duration of symptoms by about one day, and also reduce contagiousness. They are primarily prescribed to reduce rare complications such as rheumatic fever and peritonsillar abscess. The arguments {{in favor of}} antibiotic treatment should be balanced by the consideration of possible side effects, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>to</b> suggest that no antimicrobial treatment be given to healthy adults who have adverse reactions to medication or those at low risk of complications. Antibiotics are prescribed for strep throat at a higher rate than would be expected from how common it is.|$|E

50|$|The {{court held}} that the EPA was correct in {{enforcing}} these regulations upon Chemical Waste Management. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>to</b> expect the firm to report leakage of a substance, although <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not considered hazardous. It also held that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>to</b> expect Chemical Waste Management to especially report leakages that had breached the two check system and thus were in violation of the old requirements, regardless of it being in a transitional stage.|$|R
50|$|The {{respondent}} {{stated that}} <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>to</b> infer from the Recorder's judgment {{that as the}} signs were clearly visible that Ms Vine had therefore seen them and understood their content.|$|R
25|$|We do {{not know}} when or where cricket was first played in the West Indies but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>to</b> assume that it was {{introduced}} by these early colonists.|$|E
25|$|Hypercalcemia (usually {{defined as}} a calcium level above the {{reference}} range) is mostly caused by either primary hyperparathyroidism or malignancy, and therefore, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>to</b> include these in the differential diagnosis.|$|E
25|$|While Pit Bulls are not {{the only}} breed of dog which can be {{dangerous}} or vicious, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>to</b> single out the breed to anticipate and avoid the dangerous aggressiveness which may be undetectable in a Pit Bull.|$|E
6000|$|... "I thought I heard {{somebody}} {{running in}} that direction when I first fell," [...] Fred said, pointing toward the quarter in which <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>to</b> suppose the old shaft might be found.|$|R
25|$|In Hahnemann's time, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>to</b> {{assume the}} {{preparations}} could be diluted indefinitely, as {{the concept of}} the atom or molecule as the smallest possible unit of a chemical substance was just beginning to be recognized.|$|R
5000|$|If {{the group}} were {{completely}} homogeneous then <b>it</b> would <b>be</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>to</b> set , while if the group were completely heterogeneous then <b>it</b> would <b>be</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>to</b> set [...] Using intermediate values <b>is</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>to</b> {{the extent that}} both individual and group history is useful in inferring future individual behavior.|$|R
25|$|National pride, rivalries between nations, and the {{politics}} of public relations have in the past been the primary motivations for shaping space projects. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>to</b> assume that these factors would also be present in planetary terraforming efforts.|$|E
25|$|The engines used {{welded steel}} tube engine mount of 4130 Chrome-Molybdenum tubing and flat stock. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>to</b> assume that load bearing {{members of the}} mount system {{extended}} far enough to transfer the torsion and tension loads into the main wing 3structure.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{simplest}} methods is linear interpolation (sometimes known as lerp). Consider the above example of estimating f(2.5). Since 2.5 is midway between 2 and 3, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>to</b> take f(2.5) midway between f(2) = 0.9093 and f(3) = 0.1411, which yields 0.5252.|$|E
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>to</b> {{suppose that}} the sentries here, there and {{everywhere}} throughout the village would be pressing toward the front from motives of curiosity, if nothing else, feeling thoroughly well convinced that no harm could come upon them from the rear.|$|R
50|$|Critics {{argued that}} since a single vague {{accusation}} had {{been enough to}} keep a detainee imprisoned, if one assumed his case <b>was</b> typical, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>to</b> believe that many other detainees the reviews determined were illegal combatants may {{have been just as}} questionable.|$|R
60|$|The brave little lad {{had no idea}} {{of leaving}} Simon Kenton {{at the mercy of the}} painted brutes, however. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>to</b> suppose they would shoot him rather than allow a rescue, and Paul was bent on saving him at the hazard of his own life.|$|R
25|$|The {{lifespan}} of Corydoras panda in {{the aquarium}} {{has not been}} systematically determined, but given the longevity of other Corydoras species in the aquarium, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>to</b> assume that well-cared for specimens will enjoy a lifespan in excess of ten years, and frequently in excess of 15 years.|$|E
25|$|In early 2006, The Nature Conservancy further {{noted that}} the BioBlitz of 2002 was not the {{definitive}} work on the species within Owasippe. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>to</b> assume that other species, those not particularly evident during the two weekends of the Bioblitz, were missed in the accounting of species.|$|E
25|$|If, {{however, the}} Board of HMRC {{is of the}} opinion, on {{reasonable}} grounds, that the date so chosen by the company is inappropriate, they may, if <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>to</b> do so, give notice that the accounting date of another of the company's trades should be used instead.|$|E
60|$|The {{only thing}} in our favor was that the night promised to be dark. Already were clouds hiding the setting sun, the wind was growing stronger, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>to</b> believe that within an hour the heavens would be covered as with a black veil.|$|R
60|$|I {{was burning}} {{with the desire}} to come up with Horry Sims, who <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>to</b> believe had gone into the town of York and to that end quickened my pace, {{although}} knowing full well <b>it</b> <b>was</b> best I did not speak with the viper that day.|$|R
5000|$|Remarkably, {{all four}} of the Zahn {{brothers}} from Wuppertal became captains of industry. This prompted banker Hermann Josef Abs to quip that there were so many teeth in the German economy that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>to</b> speak of a complete bite. ('Zahn' is the German word for 'tooth'.) ...|$|R
25|$|Nevertheless, given Barrientos' close {{relationship}} with the Princes of Aragón, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>to</b> conclude that, at least at first, he was a supporter of the opposition camp. Nevertheless, he was a skillful politician who knew how to maneuver when political winds shifted in favor of John II, to save himself from misfortune.|$|E
25|$|Virtually {{all of the}} {{writings}} of Hipparchus are lost, including his work on precession. They are mentioned by Ptolemy, who explains precession as {{the rotation of the}} celestial sphere around a motionless Earth. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>to</b> presume that Hipparchus, similarly to Ptolemy, thought of precession in geocentric terms as a motion of the heavens, rather than of the Earth.|$|E
25|$|Mutations in the Ras {{family of}} proto-oncogenes (comprising H-Ras, N-Ras and K-Ras) are very common, being found in 20% to 30% {{of all human}} tumors. <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>to</b> {{speculate}} that a pharmacological approach that curtails Ras activity may represent a possible method to inhibit certain cancer types. Ras point mutations are the single most common abnormality of human proto-oncogenes.|$|E
60|$|From my father's {{store of}} powder and balls I took {{as much as}} could be {{conveniently}} carried, and this, with such small supply of corn bread and salt pork as filled my hunting-bag, made up an outfit for a journey from which <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>to</b> believe I might never return.|$|R
5000|$|<b>It</b> must <b>be</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>to</b> impute the employee's {{acts and}} {{intentions}} to the corporation.|$|R
50|$|Bigfoot proponents Grover Krantz and Geoffrey H. Bourne {{believed}} that Bigfoot {{could be a}} relict population of Gigantopithecus. According to Bourne, all Gigantopithecus fossils were found in Asia. Given that many species of animals migrated across the Bering land bridge, they {{believed that}} <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>to</b> assume that Gigantopithecus might have as well.|$|R
25|$|Brine is {{a problem}} in {{proportion}} to the humidity created, since water's vapor pressure decreases with salinity, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>to</b> expect at least as much brine as water in humidity. This means that a river of brine flows way from the powerplant at 41 tons (m3s-1) per second, along with a river of saline water flowing in with 82 tons of water per second (m3s-1).|$|E
25|$|Non-operating Adjustments. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>to</b> {{assume that}} if a {{business}} were sold in a hypothetical sales transaction (which is the underlying premise of the fair market value standard), the seller would retain any assets which were {{not related to the}} production of earnings or price those non-operating assets separately. For this reason, non-operating assets (such as excess cash) are usually eliminated from the balance sheet.|$|E
25|$|Because {{the index}} scale is linear (and not logarithmic, {{as is often}} the case when {{measuring}} things such as brightness or sound level), <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>to</b> assume that one hour of exposure at index 5 is approximately equivalent to a half-hour at index 10, although other factors like the body's ability to repair damage over a given time period could detract from the validity of this assumption.|$|E
50|$|Static {{scheduling}} in the compiler also {{assumes that}} dynamically generated code will be uncommon. Before {{the creation of}} Java and the Java virtual machine, this <b>was</b> true. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>to</b> assume that slow compiles would only affect software developers. Now, with just-in-time compilation (JIT) virtual machines being used for many languages, slow code generation affects users also.|$|R
50|$|The {{court also}} {{ruled that the}} right to use similar domain names could not be conferred upon both the parties in equal measure, since upon {{evidence}} adduced during the proceedings <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>to</b> conclude that Sifynet Solutions had adopted Satyam Infoway's mark with a dishonest intention to pass off its services as those of Satyam Infoway's.|$|R
5000|$|The {{assessment}} {{should be}} based upon bridging the gap between what the position {{would have been if}} the company had been put into a hypothetical liquidation at the last point when <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>to</b> do so, against the actual position. Where there were two or more defendants who are shared culpability, that award would be joint and several.|$|R
