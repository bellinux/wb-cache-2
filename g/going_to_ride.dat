25|$|Originally {{the knight}} {{characters}} were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ride</b> real horses, but after {{it became clear}} that the film's small budget precluded real horses, the Pythons decided that their characters would mime horse-riding while their porters trotted behind them banging coconut shells together. The joke was derived from the old-fashioned sound effect used by radio shows to convey the sound of hooves clattering. This was later referred to in the German release of the film, which translated the title as Die Ritter der Kokosnuß ('The Knights of the Coconut').|$|E
500|$|Sharp was a jockey from 2004 to 2005, riding {{mostly at}} Canterbury Downs in Minnesota, {{but also in}} West Virginia and Maryland. Sharp was an {{assistant}} trainer to Mike Stidham for four years, and then for three years an assistant to Mike Maker, where he ran Maker's operations in New York, Kentucky and New Orleans. Napravnik and Sharp sometimes competed against each other when a horse Sharp trained was running against one Napravnik was riding, but the two were a trainer-rider team for Ramsey's three-year-old colt, Vicar's In Trouble, who won the Louisiana Derby and contested the 2014 Kentucky Derby. [...] In August 2014, Sharp left Maker's barn to begin an independent horse training stable, with {{the full support of}} both Maker and Napravnik. He scored his first graded stakes win on May 16, 2015 on the Preakness undercard with the Ramsey's horse Sandbar in the Grade III Maryland Sprint Handicap. In 2017, Sharp won the Louisiana Derby with Girvin, a colt who was Sharp's first starter in the 2017 Kentucky Derby. [...] Napravnik was the exercise rider for the colt at Sharp's training stable, and commented, [...] "I thought about putting out something on Twitter [...] [...] [...] saying I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ride</b> Girvin, as an April Fool’s joke, but I was worried people might take it seriously." ...|$|E
2500|$|... “There were a {{great many}} cowboys with the show. [...] There was a chief of the cowboys who had general {{supervision}} over both horses and men. [...] When an unbroken horse would be brought in, this cowboy chief would give it to an Indian to ride bareback. [...] After the animal was well broken, it would {{be taken away from}} the Indian and given to a cowboy to ride. [...] Then the Indian would be given another unbroken horse. [...] For a while we said nothing about it, but finally it began to be just a little too much to stand. [...] One day one of the Indians came to me just before it was time to enter the arena. [...] His horse was saddled and bridled, but he was leading the horse by the bridle. [...] I asked him what was the matter, and {{he said it was a}} wild horse and he was not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ride</b> it into the arena. [...] I went to the chief cowboy and said, ‘I do not think you are doing right. [...] You know our Indian boys have to ride bareback, but you always give them the wild horses to ride. [...] Then, when they have the horse nicely broken, you give to a cowboy. [...] Why don’t you give the wild horses to the cowboys to break in? [...] They ride on saddles, and it would not be so hard for them.’ [...] But the chief cowboy only said, “Well, I can’t be bothered by a little thing like that. [...] You will have to see Buffalo Bill about the horses.’ [...] But I retorted, “You know very well that Buffalo Bill does not know what you do with the horses. [...] He does not know that you give the wild ones to the Indian boys to ride until they are broken in. [...] Give that horse back to that Indian boy or he will not go into the arena today.’ [...] That was all, but the boy got his horse in time to enter the arena with the others. [...] Just as I was ready to go back to the Indians, I looked at Buffalo Bill, and he had a twinkle in his eye. [...] After that, we had no more trouble with the horses. [...] Although Buffalo Bill never said anything to me, I knew he had fixed things to our satisfaction.” ...|$|E
5000|$|Outside of competitions, {{the term}} vert is not {{normally}} used. Instead, the {{specific type of}} ramp is denoted. So instead of saying [...] "I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> go <b>ride</b> vert," [...] one might say [...] "I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> go <b>ride</b> a half-pipe." [...] However, it would be correct to say [...] "in competitions, I usually ride vert," [...] in order to differentiate from other forms of competition (such as freestyle, park or street).|$|R
