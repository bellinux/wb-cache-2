5|$|Married couple Jared and Jerusha Hess were co-writers and {{directors}} of the 2004 film Napoleon <b>Dynamite,</b> and had wanted to do an animated version since the film's release. They thought animation {{was the best way}} to continue the world of Napoleon <b>Dynamite</b> as the original actors had grown too old to play teenage characters. Following the film's success, Fox Searchlight Pictures wanted a sequel, but the Hesses delayed due to commitments to other projects and fear that audiences would tire of the Napoleon <b>Dynamite</b> characters.|$|E

5|$|The event {{began with}} a match between The British Bulldogs (Davey Boy Smith and <b>Dynamite</b> Kid) and The Fabulous Rougeaus (Jacques and Raymond Rougeau). As soon as the bell rang to signify that the match had begun, Smith {{attacked}} Jacques. The two teams traded blows until The Rougeaus flipped <b>Dynamite</b> Kid over their heads so that he fell on {{his back to the}} mat. <b>Dynamite</b> Kid escaped another offensive maneuver before tagging in his partner, Smith, and The British Bulldogs performed a double-team maneuver on Jacques. Despite having the upper hand, The Bulldogs failed to pin Jacques in time, and the match ended in a twenty-minute time draw.|$|E
5|$|Almost simultaneously, an {{explosion}} devastated the north {{wing of the}} Bath Consolidated School building, killing 36 schoolchildren and two teachers. Kehoe had used a timed detonator to ignite hundreds of pounds of <b>dynamite</b> and incendiary pyrotol, which he had secretly planted inside the school {{over the course of}} many months. As rescuers began working at the school, Kehoe drove up, stopped, and used a rifle to detonate <b>dynamite</b> inside his shrapnel-filled truck, killing himself, the school superintendent, and several others nearby, as well as injuring more bystanders. During rescue efforts at the school, searchers discovered an additional 500pounds (230kg) of unexploded <b>dynamite</b> and pyrotol connected to a timing device set to detonate {{at the same time as}} the first explosions; the material was hidden throughout the basement of the south wing. Kehoe had apparently intended to blow up and destroy the entire school.|$|E
5|$|Critical {{reception}} to <b>Dynamite</b> Headdy was positive. Critics {{highlighted the}} game's originality and creativity in distinguishing it among other {{games in the}} action-platform genre. They also commended Treasure for demonstrating their technical expertise with impressive graphical effects and building {{on the success of}} their earlier game Gunstar Heroes (1993). In reviews from the time and in retrospect, <b>Dynamite</b> Headdy is cited for being one of the best games on the Genesis. An 8-bit port was released for Game Gear, which itself served as the basis for a Master System port released exclusively in Brazil.|$|E

5|$|After {{developing}} Gunstar Heroes, Treasure {{was divided}} into four teams to work on four separate projects: Alien Soldier, Light Crusader, , and <b>Dynamite</b> Headdy. Masato Maegawa, president of Treasure, served as head programmer on <b>Dynamite</b> Headdy. After deciding to publish a localized version for overseas markets, Maegawa was told by Sega of America to make the game more difficult. This was because Sega did not want customers completing the game too easily on rental. Maegawa happily obliged, and the North American release was made about twice as difficult. In addition to changes in difficulty, most of the dialogue in the game was removed, {{and several of the}} character and boss sprites were changed.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} {{exploding}} cigars were being turned out by manufacturers such as Adams and Appel, the chemical explosive variety {{had fallen out}} of favor. According to Adams, the large-scale switch to a non-chemical device occurred in approximately 1915 {{in the aftermath of a}} death caused by a homemade exploding cigar rigged with <b>dynamite.</b> Though exploding cigars were not normally rigged with <b>dynamite</b> but with explosive caps using a less powerful incendiary, following the incident, a number of U.S. states banned the product altogether. The replacement for chemical explosives was a metal spring mechanism, bound with cord—as the victim puffed away, the cord burned through, causing the device to spring open, thus rupturing the cigar's end.|$|E
