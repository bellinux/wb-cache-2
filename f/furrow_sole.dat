2500|$|The {{landside}} is {{the flat}} plate which presses against and transmits the lateral {{thrust of the}} plough bottom to the furrow wall. It helps to resist the side pressure exerted by the furrow slice on the mouldboard. It also helps in stabilizing the plough while it is in operations. The rear bottom end of the landslide, which rubs against the <b>furrow</b> <b>sole,</b> is known as heel [...] A heel iron is bolted {{to the end of}} the rear of the landside and helps to carry the back of the plough. The landside and share are arranged to give a ‘'lead” towards the unploughed land, thus helping to maintain the correct furrow width. The landside is usually made of solid medium carbon steel, and is very short except on the rear bottom of the plow. The heel or rear end of the rear landside may be subject to excessive wear if the rear wheel is out of adjustment, therefore, a chilled iron heel piece is frequently used. This heel is inexpensive and can be easily replaced. The land side is fastened to the frog with the help of plough bolts.|$|E
40|$|Two {{patients}} with trisomy 8 mosaicism, confirmed by trypsin-Giemsa banding are described. While {{the majority of}} {{patients with}} this aneuploidy have been mosaics, the phenotypes of the complete and mosaic trisomies closely resemble each other. Mosaic trisomy 8 results in specific clinical findings which include skeletal dysplasia, particularly absent patellae, deep <b>furrowing</b> of the <b>soles</b> of the feet, and periarticular changes resulting in camptodactyly and progressive limitation of joint mobility...|$|R
40|$|Here {{we report}} {{the first case}} of a Korean infant with a cloverleaf-shaped craniosynostosis, in which the {{diagnosis}} of Beare-Stevenson syndrome was suspected upon observation of the typical morphological features. This infant exhibited craniofacial anomalies, ocular proptosis, cutis gyrata, acanthosis nigricans, prominent umbilical stump, <b>furrowed</b> palms and <b>soles,</b> hypospadia, and sacral skin tag coupled with dermal sinus tract. Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed that the patient also had non-communicating hydrocephalus with Chiari malformation. This is the 8 th report of Beare-Stevenson syndrome in the literature, which was confirmed by the detection of a Tyr 375 Cys mutation in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR 2) gene...|$|R
500|$|The {{goldcrest}} feeds in trees, frequently foraging on the undersides {{of branches}} and leaves. This {{is in contrast}} to the common firecrest, which mainly exploits the upper surface of branches in coniferous habitat and of leaves in deciduous trees. In winter, flocks of goldcrests cover a given distance at only one-third of the speed of common firecrests, taking the smallest prey items ignored by their relative. The differences in behaviour are facilitated by subtle morphological differences; firecrests have broader bills with longer rictal bristles (which protect a bird's eye from food items it is trying to capture), and these features reflect the larger prey taken by the species. The firecrest's less forked tail may reflect its longer episodes of hovering while hunting. Firecrests forage more often while on foot, and have a foot better adapted for perching, whereas the goldcrest's longer hind toe reflects its habit of moving vertically along branches while feeding. It also has deep <b>furrows</b> in the <b>soles</b> of its feet capable of gripping individual needles, while firecrests have a smoother surface. The goldcrest has much the same range and habitat preference as the common chiffchaff, and {{there is some evidence that}} high breeding densities of the kinglet depress the population of the warbler, although the converse is not true. There is no evidence that the species compete for territories, and in any case the chiffchaff is 50% heavier than the goldcrest. Nevertheless, there are 1.5million breeding pairs of goldcrests in Finland, compared with 0.4million breeding pairs of chiffchaffs, and only the kinglet has increased in numbers as the area of spruce woodland in the country has expanded. The goldcrest may be out-competing the warbler for food, especially as the larger bird faces more competition from other insectivores, including other Phylloscopus warblers. Both birds occur in similar forests, but the chiffchaff is found within [...] of the forest edge, with the goldcrest breeding deeper in the woodland. Nevertheless, there is no conclusive evidence that the decline of the chiffchaff subspecies Phylloscopus collybita abietinus in parts of Finland is due to competition with the willow warbler and goldcrest.|$|R
