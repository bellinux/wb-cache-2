25|$|Modern marching {{bands and}} drum corps use multi-tenors, which consist of several {{single-headed}} tom-toms {{played by a}} single drummer. The bottoms of the shells are open and beveled to project {{the sound of the}} drum forward. Double-ply PET film heads are typically used for increased sound projection and durability. They are typically played with wooden- or aluminum-shafted mallets that have disc-shaped heads made of nylon. Mallets with felt or fleece heads, drum sticks, <b>drum</b> <b>brushes,</b> and other implements are occasionally used to achieve different timbres. The playing technique used for multi-tenors is somewhat different from that of a snare drum, and more like that of a timpani because the drumhead is struck closer to the edge instead of in the center. This creates a sound with more overtone, as opposed to striking the drumhead in the center, which produces a very short, dull sound with few overtones that is considered undesirable for multi-tenors.|$|E

5000|$|Bruford {{was born}} on 17 May 1949 in Sevenoaks, Kent, the third child of Betty and John Bruford, a local {{veterinary}} surgeon. He has a brother, John, and a sister, Jane. He attended boarding school at Tonbridge School. Bruford decided to take up drumming at thirteen after watching American jazz drummers on the BBC2 jazz television series, Jazz 625, and practised the instrument in the attic of his house. He cites Max Roach, Joe Morello, Art Blakey, and Ginger Baker as his favourite and the most influential drummers as a youngster. Around this time, Bruford's sister bought him a pair of <b>drum</b> <b>brushes</b> as a birthday present, and Bruford would practise using them on album sleeves after he was told the sound resembled a snare drum while watching Jazz 625. Bruford recalled it as [...] "a perfect education". Though {{he was given a}} single snare drum at first, Bruford gradually built a full drum kit. He later took a few lessons from Lou Pocock, a member of the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra.|$|E

50|$|The overall {{process of}} making Hanji was very strenuous. One had to {{dedicate}} all {{of his or her}} life to making Hanji, and traditional Hanji makers would say “I will not let my son be a container man (the person who strains the fiber through a bamboo screen) even if I am driven to the worst”. It requires a lifelong practice to create perfect Hanji, and this is the reason why Hanji holds a great cultural value in Korea. These days, people use various technology to improve the process. For example, the Hanji makers use a heated stainless steel <b>drum,</b> <b>brushing</b> every part of the paper. This is the method that they take to dry the papers evenly, which is adapted from how traditional Hanji makers dried them {{on the floor of a}} warm room.|$|R

He featured such top soloists as trumpeters Charly Tabor, Werner Gutterer, Manfred Moch and Ack van Rooyen, trombonists Åke Persson and Jiggs Whigham, and sax/flute player Herb Geller. Drummer Rolf Ahrens supplied the characteristically simple but steady beat, often playing just a snare <b>drum</b> with <b>brushes.</b>|$|R

In cases where the signal merges with the background static (for example, the <b>brushed</b> <b>drum</b> sounds in the Sun King track on the Beatles album Abbey Road) or is weak compared to the noise (as in very faint tape recordings), the noise gating can add artifacts that are more distracting than the original static.|$|R
5000|$|Matthew Greenwald of Allmusic {{wrote that}} [...] "Paper Bag" [...] {{was one of}} the more accessible, [...] "inspiring" [...] tracks from the album.

50|$|Apollo {{released}} his UK debut album Till Your Feet Bleed on the Marterry label. The album gained positive {{reaction from the}} press.

Uncut also gave it {{four out of five}} stars. “You could accuse him of over-emoting, but there’s something intrinsically beautiful in how accordion, guitar and <b>brushed</b> <b>drums</b> are woven together to such doleful, quietly epic effect”.|$|R

5000|$|The {{earliest}} known {{video footage}} of the band performing together originates from this period, shortly before the release of Get Back.

500|$|Gaga {{released}} a [...] "Country Road Version" [...] {{of the song}} on March 15, 2011, via her Twitter account. The version opens {{with the sound of}} guitars and then introduces a fuzzed-out slide guitar and harmonica wheeze, with the original disco beats replaced by restrained <b>brush</b> <b>drumming</b> and a more laid-back vibe. Once the first chorus starts, the song chugs alongside the harmonica sounds. Just before the three-minute mark, Gaga sings new lyrics, [...] "If I wanna make it country, baby, then it's OK, cuz I was born, I was born, I was born this way," [...] over a picked mandolin. According to Gil Kaufman of MTV, the song breaks into full-on country-rock mode, reminiscent of late-period Bon Jovi music, in the final minute.
