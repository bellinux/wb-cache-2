5|$|Owing to its {{acoustic}} properties, mercury {{was used}} as the propagation medium in <b>delay</b> <b>line</b> memory devices used in early digital computers of the mid-20th century.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of a von Neumann computer depended {{on the availability of}} a suitable memory device on which to store the program. During the Second World War researchers working on the problem of removing the clutter from radar signals had developed a form of <b>delay</b> <b>line</b> memory, the first practical application of which was the mercury <b>delay</b> <b>line,</b> developed by J. Presper Eckert. Radar transmitters send out regular brief pulses of radio energy, the reflections from which are displayed on a CRT screen. As operators are usually interested only in moving targets, it was desirable to filter out any distracting reflections from stationary objects. The filtering was achieved by comparing each received pulse with the previous pulse, and rejecting both if they were identical, leaving a signal containing only the images of any moving objects. To store each received pulse for later comparison it was passed through a transmission line, delaying it by exactly the time between transmitted pulses.|$|E
5|$|Although early {{computers}} such as EDSAC made successful use {{of mercury}} <b>delay</b> <b>line</b> memory, the technology had several drawbacks; it was heavy, it was expensive, {{and it did}} not allow data to be accessed randomly. In addition, because data was stored as a sequence of acoustic waves propagated through a mercury column, the device's temperature had to be very carefully controlled, as the velocity of sound through a medium varies with its temperature. Williams had seen an experiment at Bell Labs demonstrating the effectiveness of cathode ray tubes (CRT) {{as an alternative to the}} <b>delay</b> <b>line</b> for removing ground echoes from radar signals. While working at the TRE, shortly before he joined the University of Manchester in December 1946, he and Tom Kilburn had developed a form of electronic memory known as the Williams or Williams–Kilburn tube based on a standard CRT, the first random-access digital storage device. The Manchester Small-Scale Experimental Machine (SSEM) was designed to show that the system was a practical storage device, by testing that data held within it could be read and written at the speed necessary for use in a computer.|$|E
5000|$|The {{problem of}} suppressing {{multipath}} interference in television reception motivated Clarence Hansell of RCA to use <b>delay</b> <b>lines</b> in his 1939 patent application. He used [...] "delay cables" [...] for this, relatively short pieces of coaxial cable used as <b>delay</b> <b>lines,</b> but {{he recognized the}} possibility of using magnetostrictive or piezoelectric <b>delay</b> <b>lines.</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Analysing {{the impact}} of noise sources on jitter {{performance}} of <b>delay</b> elements and <b>lines</b> is important for understanding the performance of controlled <b>delay</b> <b>lines,</b> buffered clock distribution networks, etc [...] This paper presents simulation evaluation of theoretical work on noise induced jitter in CMOS <b>delay</b> <b>lines.</b> Because of the increasing switching noise and reduced power supply voltage, digitally controlled <b>delay</b> <b>lines</b> are increasingly important and {{the focus of this}} work. For these circuits, output capacitance and drivability of delay elements are key parameters for the design of low jitter <b>delay</b> <b>lines.</b> Also, it is shown that <b>delay</b> <b>lines</b> are more sensitive to low than to high frequency noise components. Simulation results are presented for a 0. 35 μm CMOS technology. I...|$|R
40|$|A {{two-dimensional}} position-sensitive electrical readout {{system for}} microchannel plate detectors in spectroscopic applications has been devised. Two adjacent parallel coplanar <b>delay</b> <b>lines</b> are used. The difference {{in time of}} arrival of the electron event signal between {{the ends of the}} <b>delay</b> <b>lines</b> gives one coordinate of the centroid of each event pulse. The ratio of the event amplitudes on the two <b>delay</b> <b>lines</b> gives the orthogonal coordinate by means of charge partitioning. The performance characteristics of operational double <b>delay</b> <b>lines</b> for systems of this type are presented...|$|R
5|$|Transversal {{filters are}} not usually {{associated}} with passive implementations but the concept {{can be found in}} a Wiener and Lee patent from 1935 which describes a filter consisting of a cascade of all-pass sections. The outputs of the various sections are summed in the proportions needed to result in the required frequency function. This works by the principle that certain frequencies will be in, or close to antiphase, at different sections and will tend to cancel when added. These are the frequencies rejected by the filter and can produce filters with very sharp cut-offs. This approach did not find any immediate applications, and is not common in passive filters. However, the principle finds many applications as an active <b>delay</b> <b>line</b> implementation for wide band discrete-time filter applications such as television, radar and high-speed data transmission.|$|E
25|$|The {{definition}} of phaser typically excludes such devices where the all-pass section is a delay line; such a device {{is called a}} flanger. Using a <b>delay</b> <b>line</b> creates an unlimited series of equally spaced notches and peaks. It is possible to cascade a <b>delay</b> <b>line</b> with another type of all-pass filter. This combines the unlimited number of notches from the flanger with the uneven spacing of the phaser.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a new {{construction}} for an optical 2 -to- 1 FIFO multiplexer by Switched <b>Delay</b> <b>Lines</b> (SDL). We consider an crossbar switch and fiber <b>delay</b> <b>lines</b> with <b>delay.</b> These fiber <b>delay</b> <b>lines</b> are connected from the outputs of the crossbar {{switch to the}} inputs of the switch, leaving two inputs (resp. two outputs) of the switch for the two inputs (resp. two outputs) of the 2 -to- 1 multiplexer. We show that such a construction can be operated as a 2 -to- 1 FIFO multiplexer with buffer if (i) the <b>delay</b> <b>lines</b> are chosen to satisf...|$|R
30|$|There are {{two types}} of <b>delay</b> <b>lines</b> {{available}} in industry, which are based on optical technology and electronic technology. Optical <b>delay</b> <b>lines</b> offer the highest-resolution delay step, truly in the sub-picosecond range and with exceptionally linear increments. A signal is delayed by adjusting an air gap distance between an input and output fiber optic transceiver. The greater the distance a light signal travels between these two points, the longer the time delay of the output signal. However, optical <b>delay</b> <b>lines</b> offer limited <b>delay</b> range, which is in the order of only a few 100  ps. When an application calls for exceptionally long delays, several optical <b>delay</b> <b>lines</b> can be cascaded to extend the range with no loss in resolution and linearity (Melloni et al. 2010). However, this is achieved at the expense of system complexity since optical <b>delay</b> <b>lines</b> use fiber optic cables which make for a costly, bulky and fragile setup (Hashimoto et al. 2008). On the other hand, CMOS <b>delay</b> <b>lines</b> offer reduced system complexity and cost (Hashimoto et al. 2008; Melloni et al. 2010).|$|R
50|$|If a {{delay is}} not an integer of a sample {{additional}} filters are applied {{to account for the}} fraction of delay different from an integer. Hence <b>delay</b> <b>lines</b> with non-integer <b>delay</b> are called fractional <b>delay</b> <b>lines.</b>|$|R
25|$|Optical {{cavities}} {{can also}} be used as multipass optical delay lines, folding a light beam so that a long path-length may be achieved in a small space. A plane-parallel cavity with flat mirrors produces a flat zigzag light path, but as discussed above, these designs are very sensitive to mechanical disturbances and walk-off. When curved mirrors are used in a nearly confocal configuration, the beam travels on a circular zigzag path. The latter is called a Herriott-type <b>delay</b> <b>line.</b> A fixed insertion mirror is placed off-axis near one of the curved mirrors, and a mobile pickup mirror is similarly placed near the other curved mirror. A flat linear stage with one pickup mirror is used in case of flat mirrors and a rotational stage with two mirrors is used for the Herriott-type <b>delay</b> <b>line.</b>|$|E
25|$|A <b>delay</b> <b>line</b> was an {{artificial}} transmission detour that served to retard the signal, made up with series inductances and parallel capacitances that yielded a constant delay. Pick-off points at 20-microsecond intervals permitted these sub-pulses to be extracted in such sequence {{that they all}} arrive together, to achieve the compression effect.|$|E
25|$|Beams 2 through 9 were {{projected}} in horizontal array; 10 through 17 (although 10 actually lies in {{the horizontal}} row) were grouped as the vertical component. All beams of each group were powered simultaneously. Except for being controlled by a master timing signal, {{each of the eight}} channels operated independently of the others. Each transmitter was on a slightly different frequency to prevent interaction with the others. The transmitted pulse, 2000 microseconds long, was coded, or tagged, by being passed through a tapped <b>delay</b> <b>line</b> which may reversed the phase at 20-microsecond intervals. Upon reception the returned signal was passed through the same tapped <b>delay</b> <b>line</b> and compressed 100:1, to 20 microseconds in order to increase the accuracy and resolution of the range measurement, which was of course a function of the interval between transmission and return.|$|E
30|$|CMOS {{technology}} scaling {{has shown}} {{to improve the}} delay resolution of the CMOS <b>delay</b> <b>lines.</b> This is clearly recognized in TDLs as the delay resolution {{of these types of}} CMOS <b>delay</b> <b>lines</b> relies on the propagation delay of the logic-gates based delay elements. Another positive effect of CMOS technology scaling is the reduction in the power consumption and occupied active area of the fabricated CMOS <b>delay</b> <b>lines</b> chips (Zhang and Kaneko 2015).|$|R
50|$|Hybrid {{filters are}} also possible, {{typically}} involving {{a combination of}} analog amplifiers with mechanical resonators or <b>delay</b> <b>lines.</b> Other devices such as CCD <b>delay</b> <b>lines</b> have also been used as discrete-time filters. With the availability of digital signal processing, active digital filters have become common.|$|R
40|$|The {{conversion}} efficiency of electric microwave signals into {{surface acoustic waves}} in different types of superconducting transducers is studied {{with the aim of}} quantum applications. We compare <b>delay</b> <b>lines</b> containing either conventional symmetric transducers (IDTs) or unidirectional transducers (UDTs) at 2. 3 GHz and 10 mK. The UDT <b>delay</b> <b>lines</b> improve the insertion loss with 4. 7 dB and a directivity of 22 dB is found for each UDT, indicating that 99. 4 % of the acoustic power goes in the desired direction. The power lost in the undesired direction accounts for more than 90 % of the total loss in IDT <b>delay</b> <b>lines,</b> but only ~ 3 % percent of the total loss in the FEUDT <b>delay</b> <b>lines.</b> Comment: 4 pages (5 including references), 3 figure...|$|R
25|$|The {{rotation}} of the beam inside the cavity alters the polarization state of the beam. To compensate for this, a single pass <b>delay</b> <b>line</b> is also needed, made of either a three or two mirrors in a 3d respective 2d retro-reflection configuration {{on top of a}} linear stage. To adjust for beam divergence a second car on the linear stage with two lenses can be used. The two lenses act as a telescope producing a flat phase front of a Gaussian beam on a virtual end mirror.|$|E
25|$|The Olivetti Programma 101 was {{introduced}} in late 1965; it was a stored program machine which could read and write magnetic cards and displayed results on its built-in printer. Memory, implemented by an acoustic <b>delay</b> <b>line,</b> could be partitioned between program steps, constants, and data registers. Programming allowed conditional testing and programs could also be overlaid by reading from magnetic cards. It {{is regarded as the}} first personal computer produced by a company (that is, a desktop electronic calculating machine programmable by non-specialists for personal use). The Olivetti Programma 101 won many industrial design awards.|$|E
25|$|The ENIAC {{design was}} frozen in 1944 to allow construction. Eckert and Mauchly were already {{aware of the}} {{limitations}} of the machine and began plans on a second computer, to be called EDVAC. By January 1945 they had procured a contract to build this stored-program computer. Eckert had proposed a mercury <b>delay</b> <b>line</b> memory to store both program and data. Later that year, mathematician John von Neumann learned of the project and joined in some of the engineering discussions. He produced what was understood to be an internal document describing the EDVAC.|$|E

Switchable delay blocks stacked like building blocks to form incrementally adjustable <b>delay</b> <b>lines.</b> <b>Delay</b> <b>lines</b> also stacked to form high-density multiple-channel delay systems.

25|$|Unlike the GL/EL display, the Mk. II used {{a single}} {{receiver}} for {{each pair of}} antennas. The switch rapidly alternated {{one or the other}} signal into the receiver. It also sent one of the signals through a short <b>delay</b> <b>line.</b> It did not, however, move the Y-axis baseline. The result was a single trace along the center of the display, with two slightly separated blips, one from each antenna. By comparing the relative lengths of the two blips, the operator could determine which antenna was more closely aligned with the target, and continue to rotate it until the blips were equal length.|$|E
25|$|Performance of cross {{interleaver}} : As {{shown in}} the above interleaver figure, the output is nothing but the diagonal symbols generated {{at the end of}} each <b>delay</b> <b>line.</b> In this case, when the input multiplexer switch completes around half switching, we can read first row at the receiver. Thus, we need to store maximum of around half message at receiver in order to read first row. This drastically brings down the storage requirement by half. Since just half message is now required to read first row, the latency is also reduced by half which is good improvement over the block interleaver. Thus, the total interleaver memory is split between transmitter and receiver.|$|E
25|$|ENIAC was a one-of-a-kind {{design and}} was never repeated. The freeze on design in 1943 meant that the {{computer}} design would lack some innovations that soon became well-developed, notably the ability to store a program. Eckert and Mauchly started work on a new design, to be later called the EDVAC, which would be both simpler and more powerful. In particular, in 1944 Eckert wrote his description of a memory unit (the mercury <b>delay</b> <b>line)</b> which would hold both the data and the program. John von Neumann, who was consulting for the Moore School on the EDVAC, sat in on the Moore School meetings at which the stored program concept was elaborated. Von Neumann wrote up an incomplete set of notes (First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC) which were intended {{to be used as}} an internal memorandum—describing, elaborating, and couching in formal logical language the ideas developed in the meetings. ENIAC administrator and security officer Herman Goldstine distributed copies of this First Draft to a number of government and educational institutions, spurring widespread interest in {{the construction of a new}} generation of electronic computing machines, including Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator (EDSAC) at Cambridge University, England and SEAC at the U.S. Bureau of Standards.|$|E
5000|$|In 1924, Robert Mathes of Bell Telephone Laboratories filed a broad patent {{covering}} essentially all electromechanical <b>delay</b> <b>lines,</b> but {{focusing on}} acoustic <b>delay</b> <b>lines</b> where an air column {{confined to a}} pipe served as the mechanical medium, and a telephone receiver {{at one end and}} a telephone transmitter at the other end served as the electromechanical transducers. [...] Mathes was motivated by the problem of echo suppression on long-distance telephone lines, and his patent clearly explained the fundamental relationship between inductor-capacitor ladder networks and mechanical elastic <b>delay</b> <b>lines</b> such as his acoustic line.|$|R
40|$|There {{has been}} a {{tremendous}} growth in the computer, television and RADAR fields. As a result, demands on the components that give time control over pulse information {{have led to the}} development of a great variety of <b>delay</b> <b>lines.</b> <b>Delay</b> <b>lines</b> are used in the systems that relate electrical information to time like computers, television, telemetering systems, guiding missiles, navigating systems, identifying coders and decoders, radar systems and video tape recorders are typical systems that use <b>delay</b> <b>lines.</b> <b>Delay</b> <b>lines</b> are also used in electronic objects for making decision point, in sound reinforcements. In a delay network, for a given bandwidth, the amount of delay increases as the order increases. Therefore we propose an idea of optimizing the poles of the filter in order to get more delay over a given order and bandwidth...|$|R
40|$|I present several {{classes of}} {{analytical}} and semi-analytical {{solutions for the}} design of high-speed rotary optical <b>delay</b> <b>lines</b> that use a combination of stationary and rotating curvilinear reflectors. Detailed analysis of four distinct classes of optical <b>delay</b> <b>lines</b> is presented. Particularly, I consider <b>delay</b> <b>lines</b> based on a single rotating reflector, a single rotating reflector and a single stationary reflector, two rotating reflectors, and two rotating reflectors and a single stationary reflector. I demonstrate that in each of these cases it is possible to design an infinite variety of the optical <b>delay</b> <b>lines</b> featuring linear dependence of the optical delay on the rotation angle. This is achieved via optimization of the shapes of rotating and stationary reflector surfaces. Moreover, in the case of two rotating reflectors a convenient spatial separation of the incoming and outgoing beams is possible. For the sake of example, all the blades presented in this paper are chosen to fit into a circle of 10 cm diameter and these <b>delay</b> <b>lines</b> feature in excess of 600 ps of optical delay...|$|R
