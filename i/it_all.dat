In between touring, the group had written several new pieces that they wanted to record. Having had problems self-producing the previous album, If I Could Do <b>It</b> <b>All</b> Over Again, I'd Do <b>It</b> <b>All</b> Over You, the group decided to collaborate with producer David Hitchcock.

The album after that is a departure from Weiss' trademark shouting and the band's rough grooves. The mile-a-minute rants, thick with lyrical angst, are traded for simpler melodies with lyrics about anthropomorphic food and animals. Similarly, the band has scaled back their edgier post-hardcore sound, at times trading riffs for chords and guitars for pianos and harp. Even a classical composer was called into their Fishtown, Philadelphia studio for various arrangements on several tracks. The album was produced by Dan Smith (Danielson, Sufjan Stevens) and Brian McTear and was mixed by Brad Wood. Pale Horses, has songs about various colored farm animals and lyrics that mention Islam specifically.|$|R
