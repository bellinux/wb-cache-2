25|$|Massey and Denton {{propose that}} the {{fundamental}} cause of poverty among African Americans is segregation. This segregation has created the inner city black urban ghettos that create poverty traps and keep blacks {{from being able to}} escape the underclass. It is sometimes claimed that these neighborhoods have institutionalized an inner city black culture that is negatively stigmatized and purports the economic situation of the black community. Sociolinguist, William Labov argues that persistent segregation supports the use of African American English (AAE) while endangering its speakers. Although AAE is stigmatized, sociolinguists who study it note that it is a legitimate dialect of English as systematic as any other. Arthur Spears argues that there is no inherent <b>educational</b> <b>disadvantage</b> in speaking AAE and that it exists in vernacular and more standard forms.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND Brazil has {{witnessed}} {{dramatic changes in}} its fertility patterns in recent decades. The decline to below-replacement fertility {{has been accompanied by}} increases in the proportion of children born to young mothers. Yet we know little about the well-being of children born to young mothers in Brazil. OBJECTIVE Using data from the 2006 Pesquisa Nacional de Demografia e Saúde and a quasi-natural experimental approach, this study examines the implications of maternal age at first birth for the education of Brazilian adolescents. RESULTS We find that being born to a young mother is associated with <b>educational</b> <b>disadvantages</b> in adolescence, but that these disadvantages are attenuated once we account for mothers' selection into early childbearing. We also find that, in southern Brazil, adolescents born to young mothers have poorer educational outcomes compared with their peers born to older mothers, but that in northern Brazil no such disparities exist. CONCLUSIONS Adolescent <b>educational</b> <b>disadvantages</b> associated with being born to a young mother are not an artifact of selectivity, at least in southern Brazil. Regional variation in the effect of maternal age at first birth on adolescent education suggests the important role of the extended family and the father's presence as mechanisms through which disadvantages operate...|$|R
30|$|Poverty {{research}} has demonstrated that monetary resources restrict opportunities for participation but that withdrawal also occurs because of shame. Poor children and youth are ashamed of the poverty of their parents and internalise their parents’ lack of self-esteem (Gillen and Möller 1992). Thus, they withdraw from previous contacts or avoid them from the beginning (Kern 2004). Both mechanisms—financial constraints and social withdrawal because of shame—result in an accumulation of <b>educational</b> <b>disadvantages</b> for children and young individuals affected by poverty, although the socio-political approach only focuses on the first mechanism.|$|R

While a percentage of Southern Rhodesian Coloureds could meet these standards, owing to their longstanding <b>educational</b> <b>disadvantages</b> {{and the lack of}} schools few Coloureds in Northern Rhodesia had received anything more than the most basic primary education.

Finally, it draws on primary international research to show that the training advantages that local-level organisations can provide are valued by employers and vocational training practitioners, confirming the potential benefit of such interventions...|$|R
