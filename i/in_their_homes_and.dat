5|$|The {{threat of}} Emily {{prompted}} hurricane warnings {{for much of}} the North Carolina coast and northward through Delaware. A mandatory evacuation for Ocracoke and Hatteras islands displaced 160,000people during the busy Labor Day weekend; the loss in tourism revenue amounted to $10million (1993USD). About 1,600residents on these islands rode out the storm <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>homes,</b> <b>and</b> emergency officials stayed behind. Most of the evacuees went to hotels or stayed with friends or relatives, causing an increase in business across southeastern Virginia, where effects were minimal. Due to uncertainty in forecasting Emily's path, there were also evacuations from the coasts of Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, and Fire Island in New York.|$|E
5|$|They {{designed}} and built the telemetry modules <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>homes</b> <b>and</b> garages but they were only able to sell a few hundred units. Mims had sold a feature article about the new solid-state device, light-emitting diodes, to Popular Electronics (circulation 400,000) that May. With the hope of selling kits to the larger readership; Roberts and Mims designed a device that would transmit voice over a beam of light, the Opticom. The editors accepted the project story and both articles were featured {{on the cover of}} the November 1970 issue. The payment for the articles was $400 but meeting Les Solomon, Popular Electronics technical editor, proved to be significant to both Mims and Roberts future success.|$|E
5|$|Following the raids, {{tensions}} {{were high}} {{in the streets of}} the cities. Police were ordered to shoot those who defied the 21:00 to 05:00 curfew, and troops in full camouflage battle dress guarded every major intersection and bridge with automatic weapons bearing fixed bayonets. The empty pagodas were ringed by troops and armored cars. All outgoing news was censored, forcing reporters to smuggle their copy out with travelers flying to foreign countries. The telephone lines in the homes and offices of all U.S. military and embassy staff were disconnected. The head of the USAID mission, Joe Brant, was stopped and searched while commuting to work, and other American officials had their meetings with Vietnamese officials and applications for permits to travel after the curfew hours delayed. The 14,000 U.S. military advisers in the country were given orders to stay <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>homes,</b> <b>and</b> all leave was canceled.|$|E

5|$|Gods were worshiped in cult temples {{administered}} by priests {{acting on the}} king's behalf. At {{the center of the}} temple was the cult statue in a shrine. Temples were not places of public worship or congregation, and only on select feast days and celebrations was a shrine carrying the statue of the god brought out for public worship. Normally, the god's domain was sealed off from the outside world and was only accessible to temple officials. Common citizens could worship private statues <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>homes,</b> <b>and</b> amulets offered protection against the forces of chaos. After the New Kingdom, the pharaoh's role as a spiritual intermediary was de-emphasized as religious customs shifted to direct worship of the gods. As a result, priests developed a system of oracles to communicate the will of the gods directly to the people.|$|E

25|$|In later years, a {{more subtle}} method of disrupting Christian {{holidays}} involved broadcasting very popular movies {{one after the other}} on the major holidays when believers are expected to participate in religious processions, especially during the Easter celebration.

25|$|Tactics {{became even}} more brutal when the Zionists were ready to {{complete}} their occupation of the Galilee in October. By that time the Arab villagers, having seen what had happened elsewhere, had become adamant about staying put <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>homes</b> <b>and</b> on their lands. To frighten them away, the occupying forces started a strategy of planned massacres, which were carried out in Eilabun, Faradiyya, Safsaf, Sa'sa', and other villages. In places where this was not to their advantage {{for one reason or}} another, the army would resort to forceful expulsion. I was to wittnes some of these tactics in Rameh a month or so later.|$|E

25|$|Occupational {{therapists}} {{work with}} older adults to maintain independence, participate in meaningful activities, and live fulfilling lives. Some examples of areas that occupational therapists address with older adults are driving, aging in place, low vision, and dementia or Alzheimer's Disease (AD). When addressing driving, driver evaluations are administered {{to determine if}} drivers are safe behind the wheel. To enable independence of older adults at home, occupational therapists perform falls risk assessments, assess clients functioning <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>homes,</b> <b>and</b> recommend specific home modifications. When addressing low vision, occupational therapists modify tasks and the environment. While working with individuals with AD, occupational therapists focus on maintaining quality of life, ensuring safety, and promoting independence.|$|E
25|$|Muslim Cham Albanians that fled in Albania, were {{organised}} {{as refugees}} by the communist-led Albanian government. The Anti-Fascist Committee of Cham Immigrants was created since 1944, {{as part of}} the Anti-Fascist National Liberation Front, led by the communists, in order to lobby for the returning of Chams <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>homes</b> <b>and</b> to create the facilities for their surviving in the refugee camps that were created in Albania. The new post-war Communist government of Albania took the Cham issue to the Paris Peace Conference to demand the repatriation of the Chams and the return of their property, but no answer was given. At the same time, they established refugee camps and distributed Chams throughout Albania, especially in regions like Fier, Durrës and Tirana.|$|E
25|$|The shock was {{comparatively}} slight in Beirut, {{but many}} houses were damaged and others completely destroyed. The wintertime slowed {{communication in the}} area, and nearly eight days passed before reliable reports came in from Safed regarding the nature of damage there. The letters stated that the town, along with Tiberias and many other villages, had been overthrown. Sidon was damaged considerably, and in Tyre the fallen homes made the streets nearly impassable, with people sleeping in boats and in tents alongside the shore. The village of Rumaish was mostly destroyed, with thirty deaths occurring as people were crushed <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>homes,</b> <b>and</b> many more would have suffered the same had they not been at evening prayers at the church there, which was a small building that was not seriously damaged.|$|E

25|$|Beth Israel {{was founded}} as the House of Israel in North Adams, Massachusetts {{in the early}} 1890s. Jewish {{immigrants}} first arrived in the North Adams area in 1867, and by 1890 comprised twenty-five families in North Adams and five more in Adams. They met to hold High Holy Days services as early as 1888, and in subsequent years held regular services <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>homes,</b> <b>and</b> rented halls for the High Holy Days. The Jewish origins of the founders were fairly homogeneous; most came from the Minsk Province of Belarus, and of those, most came {{from the town of}} Kletsk. Because the North Adams region had few of the more assimilated Sephardi Jews or German Jews of earlier migrations to the United States, there was little conflict over maintaining traditional Orthodox services.|$|E
25|$|The city at {{this time}} was in a terrible confusion. Crowds of the people, on horse and foot, rushed in {{disorder}} on the streets, vainly searching for already deceased Khan. Bewildered residents hid <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>homes</b> <b>and</b> barns, women filled the air with frantic cries. Meanwhile, Russian soldiers with bayonets cleared the street, entirely covered with dead bodies, and seized the booty, finding on a horseback some precious gold jewelry. By noon the battle began to subside, and broke again {{only for a moment}} when, according to Tstsianov, the soldiers came upon five hundred men, who have entrenched themselves in the Juma mosque. At first they offered to surrender, but when one Armenian said that among them are some Lezgins, it was the signal for the death of all defenders, because the hatred of Lezghins was so strong among the Russian troops.|$|E
25|$|Nurses {{practice}} {{in a wide range}} of settings, from hospitals to visiting people <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>homes</b> <b>and</b> caring for them in schools to research in pharmaceutical companies.

Nurses have also been delving into the world of informatics, acting as consultants to the creation of computerized charting programs and other software.|$|E
