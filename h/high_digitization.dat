The proposed digital architectures {{are based on a}} novel algorithmic approach that uses carry save adders for the nonlinear arithmetic modular calculations arising when computing piecewise linear maps with a finite precision. As a result, the system can be implemented by digital circuits obtaining high throughputs, which are not dependent on the digital resolution while involving a hardware complexity linearly proportional to the number of bits used for representing the discretized state. The proposed solutions result to be particularly suitable for the implementation of pseudorandom number generators based on pseudochaos, or for the definition of efficient digital blocks that can be integrated in most of the pseudochaotic cyphers proposed in the literature...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The “Great Turning ” {{is a time}} of {{transition}} from societies dominated by the digital mode of communication to a global civilization grounded in imagination. Our current way of communicating has been so infatuated with digital and analytical thinking that it made it easy to overlook the significance of analog in imagining new realities. The mass rush to digitization comes with a <b>high</b> price. <b>Digitization,</b> while it is an advantageous technological achievement in speed, accuracy and efficiency, it impoverishes the role of the analog mode in simultaneously capturing infinite imaginative possibilities. Imagination transforms ideas into images, which in turn need to be communicated through language. The very nature of imagination depends on the undifferentiated seamless qualities of an analog experience. While the proposed conceptualization process utilizes words as vehicles of thought, imaginative thinking does not rely on the digital sequential syntax of language. This idea raises challenging questions: How do we communicate imagination by using language, which is sequential and linear in nature? How do we use the digital mode of language in an analog manner to conceptualize? By deconstructing familiar symbolic digital taxonomies into qualities, we open the potentiality for imaginative connections that give rise to breakthrough and discovery.

RITC is primarily designed to digitize broadband radio signals produced by the Askaryan effect, and thus targets an analog bandwidth of > 1 GHz, with a sample-and-hold architecture capable of storing up to 2. 6 gigasamples-per-second. An array of flash analog-to-digital converters perform 3 -bit conversion of sets of stored samples while acquisition continues elsewhere in the sampling array. A serial interface is provided to access an array of on chip digital-to-analog converters that control the digitization thresholds for each channel {{as well as the}} overall sampling rate. Demultiplexed conversion outputs are read out simultaneously for each channel via a set of 36 LVDS links, each running at 650 Mb/s. We briefly describe the design architecture of RITC.

Wide acceptance of morphometric methods has, however, been hampered by the tedious and time consuming nature of the manual segmentation of nuclei {{and the lack of}} equipment for <b>high</b> throughput <b>digitization</b> of slides. Recently, whole slide imaging became more affordable and widely available, making fully digital pathology archives feasible. In this study, we employ an automatic nuclei segmentation algorithm to extract nuclear morphometry features related to size and we analyze their prognostic value in male breast cancer. The study population comprised 101 male breast cancer patients for whom survival data was available (median follow-up of 5. 7 years). Automatic segmentation was performed on digitized tissue microarray slides, and for each patient, the mean nuclear area and the standard deviation of the nuclear area were calculated. In univariate survival analysis, a significant difference was found between patients with low and high mean nuclear area (P 0. 022), while nuclear atypia score did not provide prognostic value. In Cox regression, mean nuclear area had independent additional prognostic value (P 0. 032) to tumor size and tubule formation. In conclusion, we present an automatic method for nuclear morphometry and its application in male breast cancer prognosis. The automatically extracted mean nuclear area proved to be a significant prognostic indicator.

40|$|Recently, new spectroscopic {{techniques}} {{have been developed}} such as photocurrent detected two-dimensional spectroscopy [1], which measure the response from a sample that is excited by a high intensity laser pulses. The responses are linear and nonlinear signals that have very different amplitudes; the linear signal can be from 103 to 105 {{times larger than the}} nonlinear signal. These two signals have to be digitized and transferred to a computer to be able to isolate the photocurrent nonlinear signal. This requires analog to digital converters (ADC) with very high dynamic range. Some ADCs in the market meet these requirements but they can only sample one channel and this application requires two. Using two separate converters is not optimal due to phase delays in the sampling. Therefore, in this project, a two-channel high-speed and high-precision digitizing system is built. It is a complete system that includes both analog and digital hardware as well as software. It consists of two ADC boards that are controlled using a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) included in an FPGA board. In order to communicate this modules, an interfacing board has been designed. The code elaborated in this project for the FPGA programming has been written in VSIC Hardware Description Language (VHDL). In order to control the data communication with the PC, a software interface application is developed. The digitizing system built can function at a sample rate up to 4 MS/s and has a resolution of 23 bits. This system only uses one programmable module, which reduces its cost drastically compared to two separate one channel digitizing systems. The tests performed with the system demonstrate that even with just one programmable block, a <b>high</b> speed <b>digitization</b> and data transfer can be achieved. The data acquisition system is able to sample one million samples per channel per acquisition event in 780 ms. Moreover, it can sample up to 4 MS per channel per acquisition event.

The second chapter, The beginnings of digitization, was prepared likewise, although {{it also has a}} thread of analysis of subsequent attempts to coordinate digitization, from the lowest to the <b>highest</b> level. The <b>digitization</b> dealt with in this chapter is understood broadly as a process consisting of many different stages from selecting, through scanning to Internet availability. In the next chapter, entitled Description, a range of standards used by archivists to describe archival material is presented, beginning with ISAD(G), providing details on the criteria for archival description and EAD, which standardises the electronic exchange of data. Other standards, including EAG, ISDIAH 45, EAC 46 and ISAAR 47, as well as METS and PREMIS are also mentioned. This chapter also touches upon the issue of software used by German archives to describe archive records, such as HADIS, scopeArchiv, BASYS, AUGIAS or Faust, as well as the issue of electronic inventories and related retroconversion. The fourth chapter, Digitization of records, covers the process of digitization as it is broadly understood, equipment, digitization laboratories and formats of stored scanned documents, and presents models for digitization projects based on in-house digitization or out-sourcing. The fifth chapter, Archives on the Internet, is devoted to the issues related to the development of internet archives services, namely their websites and portals. The last chapter, Future Archives, deals with the developing and unavoidable trend in the formation of new electronic archives that collect electronically developed archive materials, which include electronic documents, databases, websites and digitized objects. As in the first two chapters, there is a theoretical introduction, which guides the reader into the issue and makes an attempt to estimate the advance in creating that sort of archives.

40|$|In {{semiconductor}} industry new approaches are employed for increasing functionality and complexity while reducing a systems footprint by integrating {{components in the}} third spatial dimension. However, this new design concept requires new and adapted methods for failure analysis and quality assessment. Acoustic microscopy is a powerful method providing detailed information of a samples interior while operating non-destructively. By employing the methods capability of acquiring the information in 3 D by performing a rapid acquisition scan full access {{is given to the}} samples interior structure and parameters including the elastic properties. However, the new concept of 3 D integration required the development of new solutions for providing the full performance of this technique to the developers, manufacturers and failure analysis engineers of 3 D integrated technologies. Recent trends in semiconductor technologies utilize the third spatial dimension for increasing functionality and performance of microelectronic systems and components while continuously reducing a devices footprint. This new concept however, challenges existing and state of the art methods for diagnostics, failure analysis and quality assessment. Therefore the adjustment of existing methods for non-destructive inspection is strongly demanded since, especially in the development phase of a new technology, the non-destructive and total-view assessment of the condition and the localization of defects is of major importance. Acoustic microscopy is capable of providing 3 D information from a samples interior, allowing an exact depth localization of defects and enabling the access to mechanical properties. New semiconductor chip technologies and technologies for 3 D integration require exact these information of packaging and interface defects in 3 dimensions. In the current paper novel methodical approaches in acoustic microscopy for non-destructive failure analysis on 3 D integrated TSV samples are introduced. The approach combines new concepts in transducer design, customized pulse excitation, <b>high</b> performance <b>digitization</b> hardware systems and intelligent focus solutions for increased accuracy and sample through put. Also the potential of acoustic microscopy hardware operating in the frequency band of up to 2 GHz equipped with specific acoustic lenses allowing for lateral resolutions in the 1 μm range will be demonstrated. In case of full wafer inspection for high level 3 D integration processes, non-destructive inspection commonly faces a high degree of wafer bow. This warpage however, will lead to significant artefacts interfering with features in the bond interface. Due to the high refractive indices encountered in acoustic imaging the spacing between the sample surface and the acoustic lens largely influences the focal position inside the sample. For avoiding these imaging artefacts an intelligent z-axis has been developed that prevents an axial displacement of the focal area allowing for high imaging contrast and resolution with an increased performance in defect localization. By aiming at ever higher imaging resolutions an increase in acoustic frequency is desired. However, acoustic attenuation exponentially increases with frequency resulting in spectral downshifts and decreased signal intensities. These issues are met by the design of application specific acoustic lenses allowing for a minimum propagation path in the coupling fluid. Acoustic signals received by these transducers contain a large variety of information about the interaction of the acoustic wave on the propagation path [1]. Newly developed signal analysis methods allow for the extraction of these information and also largely contributes to an increased imaging resolution and defect detection. The increased performance of these novel approaches has been evaluated on a variety of flip-chip devices containing regular and micro-bump interconnects as well as TSV’s. Acoustic imaging and defect localization will be shown on both the condition of the electrical connections {{as well as on the}} integrity of the underfiller required for ensuring mechanical and thermal stability in high performance 3 D-integrated devices. The decreased lateral dimensions of structures contained in 3 D- relevant technologies require imaging resolutions in the 1 μm range and detection limits even below that. For meeting those demands a novel high frequency acoustic microscope has been developed operating in the frequency band of up to 2 GHz providing an imaging resolution of approx. 1 μm (@ 1. 2 GHz) combined with an excellent sensitivity to surface and near-surface features. Figure 1 contains an electron micrograph in direct comparison with an acoustic GHz-micrograph showing and verifying delaminations non-destructively found approx. 5 μm below the samples surface. The SEM image in the upper part of fig. 1 verifies the acoustically found defects demonstrating the high potential of this new acoustic imaging technique...|$|R
