5|$|Brachytherapy <b>for</b> <b>prostate</b> <b>cancer</b> {{may cause}} erectile {{dysfunction}} in approximately 15-30% of patients. However, {{the risk of}} erectile dysfunction is related to age (older men are at a greater risk than younger men) and also the level of erectile function prior to receiving brachytherapy. In patients who do experience erectile dysfunction, {{the majority of cases}} can successfully be treated with drugs such as Viagra. Importantly, the risk of erectile dysfunction after brachytherapy is less than after radical prostatectomy.|$|E
5|$|Transient {{increased}} bowel frequency, diarrhoea, constipation or minor rectal bleeding, {{may also}} occur. Acute and subacute side effects usually resolve over {{a matter of}} days or a few weeks.

5|$|Along with Senators Ted Kennedy and Orrin Hatch, Clinton was a {{force behind}} {{the passage of the}} State Children's Health Insurance Program in 1997, a federal bill that gave state support to {{children}} whose parents could not provide them health coverage and conducted outreach efforts on behalf of enrolling children in the program once it became law. She promoted nationwide immunization against childhood diseases and encouraged older women to get a mammogram for breast cancer screening, with coverage provided by Medicare. She successfully sought to increase research funding <b>for</b> <b>prostate</b> <b>cancer</b> and childhood asthma at the National Institutes of Health. The First Lady worked to investigate reports of an illness that affected veterans of the Gulf War, which became known as the Gulf War syndrome.|$|E
5|$|In 1967 Olivier {{was caught}} in the middle of a {{confrontation}} between Chandos and Tynan over the latter's proposal to stage Rolf Hochhuth's Soldiers. As the play speculatively depicted Churchill as complicit in the assassination of the Polish prime minister Władysław Sikorski, Chandos regarded it as indefensible. At his urging the board unanimously vetoed the production. Tynan considered resigning over this interference with the management's artistic freedom, but Olivier himself stayed firmly in place, and Tynan also remained. At about this time Olivier began a long struggle against a succession of illnesses. He was treated <b>for</b> <b>prostate</b> <b>cancer</b> and, during rehearsals for his production of Chekhov's Three Sisters he was hospitalised with pneumonia. He recovered enough to take the heavy role of Edgar in Strindberg's The Dance of Death, the finest of all his performances other than in Shakespeare, in Gielgud's view.|$|E

Queen Elizabeth II honorarily knighted Schwarzkopf and he was awarded many other military accolades from foreign countries. He led the Pegasus Parade at the Kentucky Derby and was an honorary guest at the Indianapolis 500. He supported several children's charities and national philanthropic causes, and he was a spokesperson <b>for</b> <b>prostate</b> <b>cancer</b> awareness, recovery of the grizzly bear from endangered species status, and served on the Nature Conservancy board of governors.

The PSA level was decreased more than 50 % in 11 out of 15 (73. 3 %) patients. Median re-relapse-free survival was 15 (3 - 32) months. This effectiveness was as good as intravenous high-dose diethylstilbestrol diphosphate (DES-DP) treatment which was used as a secondary endocrine therapy <b>for</b> relapsed <b>prostate</b> <b>cancer</b> at our institute previously.
