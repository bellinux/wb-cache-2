5|$|Gerd Heidemann {{was born}} in Hamburg in 1931. During the rise of Hitler his parents {{remained}} apolitical, but Heidemann, like many other young boys, joined the Hitler Youth. After the war he trained as an electrician, and pursued an interest in photography. He began working in a photographic laboratory and became a freelance photographer for the Deutsche Presse-Agentur and Keystone news agencies, {{as well as some}} local Hamburg papers. He had his first work published in Stern in 1951 and four years later joined the paper as a full-time member of staff. From 1961 he covered wars and hostilities across Africa and the Middle East; he became obsessed with these conflicts and other stories on which he worked, such as the search <b>for</b> <b>identity</b> of the German writer B. Traven. Although he was an excellent researcher—his colleagues called him , the Bloodhound—he would not know when to stop investigating, which led to other writers having to finish off the stories from large quantities of notes.|$|E
5|$|Most {{countries}} place {{dietary supplements}} {{in a special}} category under the general umbrella of foods, not drugs. As a result, the manufacturer, and not the government, has the responsibility of ensuring that its dietary supplement products are safe before they are marketed. Regulation of supplements varies widely by country. In the United States, a dietary supplement is defined under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994. There is no FDA approval process for dietary supplements, and no requirement that manufacturers prove the safety or efficacy of supplements introduced before 1994. The Food and Drug Administration must rely on its Adverse Event Reporting System to monitor adverse events that occur with supplements. In 2007, the US Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 21, part III took effect, regulating Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs) in the manufacturing, packaging, labeling, or holding operations for dietary supplements. Even though product registration is not required, these regulations mandate production and quality control standards (including testing <b>for</b> <b>identity,</b> purity and adulterations) for dietary supplements. In the European Union, the Food Supplements Directive requires that only those supplements that have been proven safe can be sold without a prescription.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} associative algebras with involution graded by {{a finite}} abelian group G over {{a field of}} characteristic zero. Suppose that the involution {{is compatible with the}} grading. We represent conditions permitting PI-representability of such algebras. Particularly, it is proved that a finitely generated (Z/qZ) -graded associative PI-algebra with involution satisfies exactly the same graded identities with involution as some finite dimensional (Z/qZ) -graded algebra with involution for any prime q or q = 4. This is an analogue of the theorem of A. Kemer <b>for</b> ordinary <b>identities,</b> and an extension of the result of the author <b>for</b> <b>identities</b> with involution.

40|$|We {{consider}} associative algebras with involution over a {{field of}} characteristic zero.

As a consequence we obtain the positive solution of the Specht problem <b>for</b> <b>identities</b> with involution: any associative algebra with involution over {{a field of}} characteristic zero has a finite basis of identities with involution.

40|$|Research on face {{learning}} {{has tended to}} use sets of images that vary systematically on dimensions such as pose and illumination. In contrast, we have proposed that exposure to naturally varying images of a person may be {{a critical part of}} the familiarization process. Here, we present two experiments investigating face learning with “ambient images”—relatively unconstrained photos taken from internet searches. Participants learned name and face associations <b>for</b> unfamiliar <b>identities</b> presented in high or low within-person variability—that is, images of the same person returned by internet search on their name (high variability) versus different images of the same person taken from the same event (low variability). In Experiment 1 we show more accurate performance on a speeded name verification task <b>for</b> <b>identities</b> learned in high than in low variability, when the test images are completely novel photos. In Experiment 2 we show more accurate performance on a face matching task <b>for</b> <b>identities</b> previously learned in high than in low variability. The results show that exposure to a large range of within-person variability leads to enhanced learning of new identities...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{intended}} to reveal {{the phenomenon of the}} struggle of the community of Sedulur Sikep in Pati Regency, Central Java Province <b>for</b> its <b>identity</b> with the approach of cultural studies. The problems of the study can be formulated as follows (1) what was the struggle <b>for</b> the <b>identity</b> of the community of Sedulur Sikep like?; (2) what caused the struggle <b>for</b> the <b>identity</b> of the community of Sedulur Sikep to appear?; (3) what was the meaning of the struggle <b>for</b> the <b>identity</b> of the community of Sedulur Sikep to its existence. This study is a qualitative one with the researcher as the main instrument supported by an interview guide. The data were collected using the techniques of in-depth interview, observation, and documentary study. After the data were analyzed, the data were descriptively and narratively presented.   The results of the study showed that the current identity of the community of Sedulur Sikep {{was the result of a}} dialogic discourse between the community of Sedulur Sikep and the non-Sedulur Sikep communities. Based on the description above, it was found that the struggle made by the community of Sedulur Sikep <b>for</b> its <b>identity</b> was reflected in various forms of its daily life. The factors contributing to the struggle <b>for</b> the <b>identity</b> of the community of Sedelur Sikep were economic, political, social and cultural factors. The botoh Sedulur Sikep that was used as a model also contributed to it.
