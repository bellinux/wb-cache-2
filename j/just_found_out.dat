25|$|The best-known mole {{is named}} after the city of Puebla, mole poblano. The origin of this sauce is disputed {{and there are two}} {{versions}} of the legend that are most often cited. The first states that 16th century nuns from the Convent of Santa Rosa were worried because they had <b>just</b> <b>found</b> <b>out</b> that the archbishop was going to visit them and they had nothing to prepare for him except for an old turkey in the yard. Supposedly due to divine inspiration, they began to mix together many of the spices and flavorings they had on hand in the kitchen, including different types of chili peppers, other spices, day-old bread, chocolate and approximately twenty other ingredients. They let the sauce simmer for hours and poured it over the turkey meat. Fortunately, the archbishop was very pleased with the meal and the nuns were able to save face.|$|E
25|$|It was {{revealed}} following Mayweather vs Pacquiao that Pacquiao had sustained an undisclosed injury {{to his right}} shoulder while training, and that while it had healed {{in time for the}} fight, he re-injured it during the 4th round. , currently Pacquiao is facing a lawsuit of 5 million dollars by two fans for failing to disclose the shoulder injury in the lead up to his bout with Floyd Mayweather, Jr. Pacquiao failed to disclose the injury to the Nevada State Athletic Commission in the pre-fight injury evaluation. The commission did a standard injury report with Pacquiao filling out the form saying that he had no injuries heading into the bout. Pacquiao said he had sustained the injury weeks out from the fight after the loss to Mayweather. However, after facing lawsuits due to Pacquiao's statement, Pacquiao has said that he sustained the injury during the fight in which it flared up in the 3rd round. The Nevada State Athletic Commission stated and the post fight press conference that they had only <b>just</b> <b>found</b> <b>out</b> about Pacquiao's injury that evening at the post fight press conference. Speculation arose that the injury was an excuse for the loss to Mayweather because Pacquiao did not mention an injury in the post fight interview with Max Kellerman. Pacquiao's promoter Bob Arum stated that Pacquiao suffered the injury back in 2008 causing even more confusion as Pacquiao just stated that he suffered the injury during the fight now that he is facing lawsuits.|$|E
