5|$|At {{the opening}} of the summer hard court swing Federer was {{defeated}} in the final of the Montreal Masters by Alexander Zverev after injuring his back during the match. Due to the injury, he opted to withdraw from the Cincinnati Masters to be fit for the US Open. This injury effectively cost him the #1 ranking as he would have attained it by reaching the Cincinnati final, a tournament he has won seven times. Despite his withdrawal from Cincinnati, Federer had little time to recover for the US Open, and the back injury severely affected his practice sessions. Even from the start, he looked uncomfortable and it took him five sets to win each of the first two rounds against Frances Tiafoe and Mikhail Youzhny. His campaign at the US Open finally ended in the last 8, where he lost to Juan Martin del Potro in four sets. His game was hampered by unforced errors at crucial points in the match and even he admitted that he never felt <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> win the tournament.|$|E
5|$|In mid-2010, Leblanc's QMJHL {{rights were}} owned by Montreal Junior Hockey Club (Montreal Juniors)—his rights having been traded from Val-d'Or to the Chicoutimi Saguenéens in 2009, {{then to the}} Juniors in June 2010. On July 30, Leblanc signed a three-year {{contract}} with the Canadiens, and he attended a training camp with the team in September. By signing a professional contract, he forfeited his National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) eligibility and had to leave Harvard, being considered a professional according to NCAA standards. Following the camp, the Canadiens announced on September 27 that they were returning him to the Juniors for the 2010–11 season. He finished 2010–11 with 58 points in 51 games for the Juniors. In the off-season, the team relocated to Boisbriand, a suburb of Montreal, and were renamed the Blainville-Boisbriand Armada; the team traded Leblanc's major junior rights to the Shawinigan Cataractes. Before <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> play for the Cataractes, the Canadiens exercised their contract rights to him, putting him in the Hamilton Bulldogs of the American Hockey League (AHL), the Canadiens' minor league affiliate.|$|E
5|$|When Nabis {{found out}} that Gythium had fallen to the allies he decided to abandon the {{remaining}} Laconian countryside that he controlled. Nabis sent envoys to Flamininus who offered Nabis a parley. The Romans attacked Sparta when the parley ended but the Spartans withstood the initial allied assaults. Nabis, however, seeing that the situation was hopeless agreed to surrender {{the city to the}} Romans. The Romans forced Nabis to abandon Argos and most of the coastal cities of Laconia. The Romans formed all the cities that had broken off from Sparta on the Laconian coast into the Union of Free Laconians. However, the Romans didn't strip Nabis of his powers because they wanted a state in the Peloponnese to counter the growing Achaean League. Nabis attacked Gythium two or three years later only to retreat after being unable to capture the city but in 192 BC he was assassinated by the Aetolians before <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> attempt another attack on the city. In 189 BC, the Spartans, having been deprived of a port, attacked and captured the city of Las. The Acheans, threatened by the attack, demanded the surrender of those responsible for the attack and when that was refused they captured the city.|$|E

25|$|Alfred George Ernest Tasker (born 16 June 1934 in Southwark, London) was an English cricketer {{who played}} a single {{first-class}} match, keeping wicket for Worcestershire against Cambridge University in 1956. He took a single catch, to dismiss future Test player Bob Barber, but Worcestershire declared in both their innings before <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> bat; he never did get an opportunity.|$|E
25|$|Métraux {{thought at}} first that the London tablet was a forgery, due to the {{engraving}} being of the poor quality seen in modern carvings for tourists. However, after <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> see it in person, and after Barthel declared it authentic, his 'skepticism was dispelled' (1957:184). The evidence is principally the paraphrasing rather than copying of text Gr, which would have required literacy in the script to accomplish.|$|E
25|$|It was {{not until}} 18 April that Napoleon {{realized}} that 80,000 Austrians menaced Davout. He decided to send Masséna toward Landshut to threaten Archduke Charles' rear {{in an attempt to}} take the pressure off Davout.

25|$|Wogan's {{first foray}} into TV interviewing, and indeed to British television, was in 1972 on Lunchtime with Wogan on ITV.

25|$|Returned to the Navy after a {{long period}} of unemployment, Latouche took command of the Flottille de Boulogne, where he {{repelled}} the Raids on Boulogne organised by Nelson. He then served in the Saint-Domingue expedition, which irrevocably compromised his health. After his return, he took command of the fleet in Toulon, reorganising it into a potent tool again, but he succumbed to a relapse of illness before <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> use it. Under his successor Villeneuve, the fleet he had refurbished was crushed at the Battle of Trafalgar.|$|E
25|$|Nationwide {{construction}} of new, dedicated buildings for workers' clubs (combining propaganda, educational and community center functions) {{was launched in}} 1926 and peaked in 1927, when trade unions commissioned 30 clubs in Moscow region (10 {{in the city of}} Moscow). Melnikov won five of these ten projects (his sixth club is located in Likino-Dulyovo). Absence of public contests for these buildings was favorable to Melnikov, who was promoted by enthusiastic trade union commissioners, regardless of design complexity or political and artistic affiliations. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> build practically exactly as planned, with very little changes by the client (notably, omission of swimming pools).|$|E

25|$|In June, Gravano was {{approached}} by Ruggiero and, supposedly at Gotti's behest, given orders to murder capo Robert DiBernardo for making negative remarks about Gotti's leadership. Gravano was friendly with DiBernardo {{and tried to get}} the murder called off until <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> speak with Gotti after his trial. Ruggiero claimed to have met again with Gotti and told Gravano that the boss wanted DiBernardo killed right away. Gravano arranged a meeting with DiBernardo where Joe Paruta, a member of Gravano's crew, shot DiBernardo twice {{in the back of the}} head as the underboss watched. Gravano later learned that Ruggiero was $250,000 in debt to DiBernardo and realized Ruggiero may have fabricated the orders from Gotti or simply lied to Gotti about what DiBernardo was accused of saying in order to erase the debt and improve his own standing in the family. In any event, DiBernardo's death proved profitable for Gravano, as he took over the deceased man's control of Teamsters Local 282.|$|E
25|$|In the Rhine Campaign of 1796, two French armies {{successfully}} breached the Rhine River {{to invade}} Germany, Moreau's {{army in the}} south and Jean-Baptiste Jourdan's Army of Sambre-et-Meuse in the north. The French armies operated independently while Charles commanded both Maximilian Anton Karl, Count Baillet de Latour's Army of the Upper Rhine {{in the south and}} Wilhelm von Wartensleben's Army of the Lower Rhine in the north. Charles hoped to concentrate superior strength against one of the two French armies. To keep his enemies separated, the archduke wished to lure Moreau south of the Danube River by crossing to the south bank. To allow his columns to cross the river safely, Charles attacked the French, hoping to push them back. Though he failed to defeat the French, the battle gave the archduke enough space to get his troops over the Danube without interference. Though <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> join his army to Jourdan's in the north, Moreau soon crossed to the south bank in pursuit.|$|E

His wife made {{artificial}} flowers from extremely flammable celluloid. They caught fire, engulfing the wagon in flames almost immediately. Reinhardt dragged himself and his wife through the fire to safety, but suffered extensive burns on his left hand and other areas. He received first- and second-degree burns over half his body. His right leg was paralyzed, and the fourth and fifth fingers of his left hand were badly burned. Doctors believed that he would never play guitar again, and they intended to amputate one of his legs. Reinhardt refused to have the surgery and left the hospital after a short time; he was able to walk within a year {{with the aid of a}} cane.|$|E

25|$|Jackson held true to his threat not to sign, and the Buccaneers {{forfeited}} {{his rights}} before the 1987 draft. Jackson was {{in spring training}} with the Royals when someone informed him that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> play football again. Inquiring who it was, Jackson {{found out that he}} was taken in the seventh round of the draft with the 183rd pick by the Los Angeles Raiders. Initially Jackson had said he would continue to focus on baseball and would not sign, but his interest was piqued. Raiders owner Al Davis was a fan of Jackson and was receptive to the idea of Jackson playing both baseball and football. Thus, a contract was negotiated where Jackson would be permitted to play the entire baseball season with the Royals and would report to the Raiders once the season was finished. In addition to this, Davis gave Jackson a salary that was in line with what a top-flight starter at halfback would make.|$|E

In 1927 he had a victory over Henner Henkel at the Youth Games. In 1929 at the age of 13 he already defeated then-Polish champion Maximilian Stolarow. In 1931, he won the Austrian junior tennis championships as well as the international junior championships of Berlin in singles and doubles. He was ranked tenth on the Austrian rankings. The next year he was classified fifth. While in 1934 he climbed to number four on the same list. In 1935 he won the national singles and doubles championships and drew attention with back to back straight victories against famed players Franz Wilhelm Matejka and Hermann Artens to be crowned champion. Subsequently, he rose to the second place after Matejka. Later he became member of the Wiener Park Club.|$|E
25|$|Marquess Wellington {{drove the}} French from {{northern}} Spain by his decisive {{victory at the}} Battle of Vitoria on 21 June 1813. During the afternoon of 24 June, the defeated army of Joseph Bonaparte and Marshal Jean-Baptiste Jourdan streamed past Pamplona. The soldiers {{were not allowed to}} enter the fortress for fear that they would plunder the garrison's food supplies. The following day, Victor Alten's British cavalry brigade appeared before Pamplona, followed by the infantry of the Anglo-Portuguese Light Division. One authority stated that the blockade around Pamplona was set up on 25 June. A second source asserted that 26 June was the date that Pamplona was invested. On 26 June, Wellington intended to close off Pamplona on the south side with the Light and 4th Divisions and on the north side by the 3rd and 7th Divisions. However, the British army commander found that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> cut off Bertrand Clausel's divisions, so he sent the Light and 4th Divisions marching after the French. The 3rd and 7th Divisions were ordered to follow the other two divisions when Rowland Hill's corps arrived to relieve them.|$|E
