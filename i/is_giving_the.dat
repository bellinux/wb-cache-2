One such theme is that Sam continually gives criminals the updated version {{of the right to}} silence warning, which was changed in 1994. When he does so, someone around him usually points out that he <b>is</b> <b>giving</b> <b>the</b> warning incorrectly.|$|E

This <b>is</b> <b>giving</b> <b>the</b> star an oblate spheroid shape with an equatorial bulge that is 24% {{larger than the}} polar radius.

500|$|The single reel drama, {{approximately}} 1,000 feet long, {{was released}} on July 1, 1910. An article in the The Moving Picture World gave a positive review, but recognized that the tensions amongst the Union and Confederate states of the Civil War could pose a concern for viewers and stated that no offense {{will come from the}} showing of this patriotic picture. The reviewer said that it would please American audiences and foreign ones as well. This possibility of an audience taking offense over the content of the picture was a reasonable one because the film was within living memory. The movement and influence of members in the Grand Army of the Republic was strong and memberships still exceeded 200,000 persons in 1910. A review by The New York Dramatic Mirror stated, [...] "This is a sure enough 'classy' picture, full of human feeling and good acting. It is one of the kind that <b>is</b> <b>giving</b> <b>the</b> Thanhouser people the fine reputation they are gaining. ... The picture is strongly effective." [...] One advertisement billed the film as a patriotic masterpiece and would have musical accompaniment by the vaudeville musician Etta Hyland.|$|E
