500|$|Lovato {{collaborated with}} Beckett on a song titled [...] "For the Love of a Daughter". Although not {{planning}} to write a personal song, a [...] "really long talk" [...] with Beckett resulted in the song being written. The song chronicles Lovato's relationship with her estranged birth father, who left the family when she was two years old. In the song, she pleads with her father to [...] "put the bottle down" [...] and questions him: [...] "How could you {{put your hands on}} the ones that you swore you loved?" [...] The song was set to appear on the album, but Lovato and her management felt of the song's subject would be too much for her young audience and later was removed from the album. In an interview with Women's Wear Daily, she explained: [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> back, I realized I wouldn't like those subjects being talked about in somebody else's home, with a seven-year-old and their mom." [...] Several other [...] "emotional" [...] songs were also put on hold. The song was later selected and included on her third studio album Unbroken released in September 2011, when Lovato had left Disney Channel.|$|E

40|$|In recent years, {{the number}} of {{theoretical}} models on sovereign default exploded. <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> back and investigate how good our current theoretical understanding of real world sovereign debt crisis really is. This is done by deriving implications that are hard wired into our models and comparing the evolution of nearly 20 sovereign debt crises in Latin America with them. I find that the available models capture aspects of virtually all crises, yet {{there are only a}} few crisis that are fully consistent with the available models...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> forward, {{but before}} I could gain the threshold, {{the door was}} slammed in my face, and as I stood there, quivering with anger and disappointment, I heard the bolts being shot within.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, gentlemen?" [...] I {{asked in}} a tone of persiflage, as <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> towards them. [...] "Have you naught to say to me, now that I have {{answered}} your imperious summons? What! All dumb?" ...|$|E
60|$|Presently I {{distinguished}} {{two eyes}} peering {{at us from}} the vegetation. <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> in their direction, and as I did so a youth arose and fled precipitately in the direction we had been going. Raja struggled to be after him, but I held tightly to his neck, an act {{which he did not}} seem to relish, for he turned on me with bared fangs.|$|E
6000|$|... "Celia," [...] cried Elmore, [...] "this I cannot bear. Did <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> single <b>step</b> in that {{business}} without her request and your full approval? Didn't you both {{ask me to}} write?" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> few <b>steps</b> back, and he {{then opened}} the door {{sufficiently}} to allow his head to come through. He said nothing, but {{he looked at me}} for a long time in a very searching manner.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> had <b>taken</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> in the dark, and I {{was afraid}} for Cynthia. I had {{undertaken}} {{to give her}} happiness. Was I certain that I could succeed? The glow of chivalry had left me, and I began to doubt.|$|R
60|$|It was a villanous speech. Antoinette turned away, her {{shoulders}} quivering, and <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> towards him; but Madame la Vicomtesse made a swift gesture, and I stopped, I know not why. She gave an exclamation so sharp that he flinched physically, {{as though he}} had been struck. But it was characteristic of her that when she began to speak, her words cut rather than lashed.|$|E
60|$|Seeing how {{the gentlemen}} took my part, and deeming--in their blessed ignorance--that what gentlemen did must be perforce well done, they grew calm in the {{twinkling}} of an eye. Thereupon St. Auban, turning to me, counselled me {{in a whisper}} to be gone, whilst the tide of opinion flowed in my favour. Intent to act upon this good advice, <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> towards the little knot that had collected round Canaples, and with natural curiosity inquired {{into the nature of}} his hurt.|$|E
60|$|After all, {{although}} {{the thought of}} it shocked me at first, the price I was asked to pay was not so very heavy, merely one of the usual election platform formulas, whereby the candidate binds himself to support all sorts of things in which he has little or no beliefs. Already I was half committed to this anti-vaccination crusade, and, if <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> or two farther in it, what did it matter? One crank more added to the great army of British enthusiasts could make little difference in the scheme of things.|$|E
40|$|In her 1997 OSSA paper, Trudy Govier {{discusses}} {{in detail}} my thesis that arguers have dialectical obligations. In a 1998 paper she further examines this thesis {{to see whether}} it is viable and concludes that it faces serious problems. In this paper, I assess {{the state of the}} thesis in light of Govier 2 ̆ 7 s discussion of it. I urge that we have something to gain from the empirical turn [...] from investigating best practices. At the end, <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> back to ask what is really at issue here and how it connect s to other issues in the theory of argument...|$|R
60|$|But {{scarcely}} had <b>I</b> <b>taken</b> <b>a</b> hundred <b>steps</b> in {{the direction}} of the farther gate when the sound of marching troops, the clank of metal, and the squealing of thoats just within the city apprised me of the fact that the Kaolians were already moving toward the other gate.|$|R
40|$|Since {{controversy}} {{began to}} swirl surrounding then-President-elect Barack Obama 2 ̆ 7 s alleged overreliance on policy czars in late 2008, political scientists and pundits alike have {{been quick to}} view this approach to White House staffing {{as an extension of the}} imperial presidency and, to some, a threat to the constitutional order. In this article, <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> back and ask whether the phenomenon under attack is exactly what scholars assume it is. In doing so, I investigate the conceptualization problem czars pose as well as how and why presidents actually use czars. I conclude with a series of suggestion for future presidents on how best to use policy czars to advance the interests of their administration and manage the executive institution...|$|R
60|$|I {{was coming}} from over the ridge, one dayit was the 15th of May, '28and when I got {{to the edge of}} the oak forest and was about to step out of it upon the turfy open space in which the haunted beech tree stood, I {{happened}} to cast a glance from cover, firstthen <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> backward, and stood in the shelter and concealment of the foliage. For I had caught sight of Joan, and thought I would devise some sort of playful surprise for her. Think of itthat trivial conceit was neighbor, with but a scarcely measurable interval of time between, to an event destined to endure forever in histories and songs.|$|E
6000|$|I {{had barely}} started, when, looking up, I saw {{the sky above}} me: a star was {{twinkling}} just above my head. Had I been wide awake, and had the cow stopped bellowing for just one minute, I should have guessed that somehow or another I had got into a chimney. But as things were, the wonder and the mystery of it all appalled me. [...] "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" [...] would have appeared to me, at that moment, {{in the nature of}} a guide to travellers. Had a rocking-horse or a lobster suddenly appeared to me I should have sat and talked to it; and if it had not answered me I should have thought it sulky and been hurt. <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> forward and the star disappeared, just as if somebody had blown it out. I was not surprised in the least. I was expecting anything to happen.|$|E
6000|$|Now {{began the}} most arduous {{undertaking}} {{mentioned in the}} [...] "York----," [...] I mean in history. Lighting my pipe, and fixing my eye upon the ink and paper, I put my hands behind my back and took my departure from the hearthrug toward the Interior. Language fails me; I throw myself upon the reader's imagination. Before I had taken two steps, my vision alighted upon the circular of a quack physician, which I had brought home the day before around a bottle of hair-wash. I now saw the words, [...] "Twenty-one fevers!" [...] This prostrated me for I know not how long. Recovering, <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> forward, when my eyes fastened themselves upon my pen-wiper, worked into the similitude of a tiger. This compelled me to retreat to the hearthrug for reinforcements. The red-and-white dog displayed upon that article turned a deaf ear to my entreaties; nothing would move him.|$|E
40|$|Scholars {{characterize}} the nonprofit sector according to several, often overlapping the- ories. Unfortunately, these theories, {{do not offer}} testable hypotheses {{and it is hard}} to tell whether nonprofits exist because of historical accident, path dependence, different organizational goals, consumer demand, or government regulation. Therefore, rather than trying to answer such broad questions {{about the role of the}} entire sector, in this paper <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> toward filling <b>a</b> research gap by asking this simple question: Do ownership types behave differently? To answer this question, I test the provision of the Italian health care services. If ownership seems to matter, I then assess alternative explanations for those differences. I mainly consider whether ownership types have different objectives and I then investigate whether hospital types behave differently...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hold him, Don, hold him!" [...] I yelled, and <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> {{backward}} <b>step.</b> The lion {{put forward}} one big paw, his eyes now all purple blaze. I backed {{again and he}} came forward. Don gave ground slowly. Once the lion flashed a yellow paw at him. It was frightful to see the wide-spread claws.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hoitie toitie," [...] {{answered}} the traveller, [...] "why, how came you here, {{if you go}} to that, squire?--Egad, Lady Penelope is trembling for her souchong, so <b>I</b> just <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> here to save her ladyship the trouble of looking after Mrs. Jones in person, which, I think, might have been a worse interruption than mine, Mr. Mowbray." ...|$|R
60|$|As {{you come}} to the {{farmhouse}} from the front, you pass up a garden, with little enough in it, which leads out by a wicket-gate to the road; the same gate at which we stood on the night when the beacons were lit, the night that we saw Walter Scott ride past on his way to Edinburgh. On the right of this gate, on the garden side, {{was a bit of a}} rockery which was said to have been made by my father's mother many years before. She had fashioned it out of water-worn stones and sea shells, with mosses and ferns in the chinks. Well, as we came in through the gates my eyes fell upon this stone heap, and there was a letter stuck in a cleft stick upon the top of it. <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> forward to see what it was, but Edie sprang in front of me, and plucking it off she thrust it into her pocket.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Brunton, the butler, {{was in the}} library. He was sitting, fully dressed, in an easy-chair, with a slip {{of paper}} which looked like a map upon his knee, and his {{forehead}} sunk forward upon his hand in deep thought. I stood dumb with astonishment, watching him from the darkness. A small taper {{on the edge of the}} table shed a feeble light which sufficed to show me that he was fully dressed. Suddenly, as I looked, he rose from his chair, and walking over to a bureau at the side, he unlocked it and drew out one of the drawers. From this he took a paper, and returning to his seat he flattened it out beside the taper on the edge of the table, and began to study it with minute attention. My indignation at this calm examination of our family documents overcame me so far that <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> forward, and Brunton, looking up, saw me standing in the doorway. He sprang to his feet, his face turned livid with fear, and he thrust into his breast the chart-like paper which he had been originally studying.|$|E
6000|$|The hares (Lepus Americanus) {{were very}} familiar. One had her form under my house all winter, {{separated}} from me {{only by the}} flooring, and she startled me each morning by her hasty departure when I began to stir--thump, thump, thump, striking {{her head against the}} floor timbers in her hurry. They used to come round my door at dusk to nibble the potato parings which I had thrown out, and were so nearly the color of the ground that they could hardly be distinguished when still. Sometimes in the twilight I alternately lost and recovered sight of one sitting motionless under my window. When I opened my door in the evening, off they would go with a squeak and a bounce. Near at hand they only excited my pity. One evening one sat by my door two paces from me, at first trembling with fear, yet unwilling to move; a poor wee thing, lean and bony, with ragged ears and sharp nose, scant tail and slender paws. It looked as if Nature no longer contained the breed of nobler bloods, but stood on her last toes. Its large eyes appeared young and unhealthy, almost dropsical. <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>step,</b> and lo, away it scud with an elastic spring over the snow-crust, straightening its body and its limbs into graceful length, and soon put the forest between me and itself--the wild free venison, asserting its vigor and the dignity of Nature. Not without reason was its slenderness. Such then was its nature. (Lepus, levipes, light-foot, some think.) ...|$|E
60|$|And then <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> {{few more}} <b>steps</b> and saw <b>a</b> vine-covered cottage near the small stream. And {{in a little}} grassy glade I saw May Martha Mangum {{plucking}} wild flowers.|$|R
60|$|My blood boiled. To stand there, inactive, while a negro {{struck down}} that brave girl {{of my own}} race! Instinctively <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> forward <b>step</b> to place myself in the man's path. But {{at the same instant}} Menelek raised his hand in a gesture that halted the officer. The emperor seemed interested, but in no way angered at the girl's attitude.|$|R
6000|$|... "Another glance of Edith's eye, another walk by Edith's side, and my {{resolution}} would melt away. <b>I</b> will <b>take</b> <b>an</b> irrevocable <b>step,</b> therefore, {{and then}} see her for the last time." ...|$|R
60|$|At that instant, just as <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> {{backwards}} {{from the}} telephone, {{the thing was}} on us. It was {{as if we were}} bathers, up to our shoulders in water, who suddenly are submerged by a rolling wave. An invisible hand seemed to have quietly closed round my throat and to be gently pressing the life from me. I was conscious of immense oppression upon my chest, great tightness within my head, a loud singing in my ears, and bright flashes before my eyes. I staggered to the balustrades of the stair. At the same moment, rushing and snorting like a wounded buffalo, Challenger dashed past me, a terrible vision, with red-purple face, engorged eyes, and bristling hair. His little wife, insensible to all appearance, was slung over his great shoulder, and he blundered and thundered up the stair, scrambling and tripping, but carrying himself and her through sheer will-force through that mephitic atmosphere to the haven of temporary safety. At the sight of his effort I too rushed up the steps, clambering, falling, clutching at the rail, until I tumbled half senseless upon by face on the upper landing. Lord John's fingers of steel were in the collar of my coat, and a moment later I was stretched upon my back, unable to speak or move, on the boudoir carpet. The woman lay beside me, and Summerlee was bunched in a chair by the window, his head nearly touching his knees. As in a dream I saw Challenger, like a monstrous beetle, crawling slowly across the floor, and a moment later I heard the gentle hissing of the escaping oxygen. Challenger breathed two or three times with enormous gulps, his lungs roaring as he drew in the vital gas.|$|E
6000|$|Leaving the sheep, I rode to it {{with three}} of the men; aad after {{securing}} our horses on the lower slope, we began our laborious ascent. Now the gaucho when taken from his horse, on which he lives {{like a kind of}} parasite, is a very slow-moving creature, and I soon left my friends far behind. Coming to a place where ferns and flowering herbage grew thick, I began to hear all about me sounds of a character utterly unlike any natural sound I was acquainted with--innumerable low clear voices tinkling or pealing like minute sweet-toned, resonant bells--for the sounds were purely metallic and perfectly bell-like. I was completely ringed round with the mysterious music, and as I walked it rose and sank rhythmically, keeping time to my steps. I stood still, and immediately the sounds ceased. <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> forwards, and again the fairy-bells were set ringing, as if at each step my foot touched a central meeting point of a thousand radiating threads, each thread attached to a peal of little bells hanging concealed among the herbage. I waited for my companions, and called their attention to the phenomenon, and to them also it was a thing strange and perplexing. [...] "It is the bell-snake!" [...] cried one excitedly. This is the rattle-snake; but although at that time I had no experience of this reptile, I knew that he was wrong. Yet how natural the mistake! The Spanish name of [...] "bell-snake" [...] had made him imagine that the whirring sound of the vibrating rattles, resembling muffled cicada music, is really bell-like in character. Eventually we discovered that the sound was made by grasshoppers; but they were seen only to be lost, for I could not capture one, so excessively shy and cunning had the perpetual ringing of their own little tocsins made them. And presently I had to return to my muttons; and afterwards there was no opportunity of revisiting the spot to observe so singular a habit again and collect specimens. It was a very slender grasshopper, about {{an inch and a half}} long, of a uniform, tawny, protective colour--the colour of an old dead leaf. It also possessed a protective habit common to most grasshoppers, of embracing a slender vertical stem with its four fine front legs, and moving cunningly round so as to keep the stem always in front of it to screen itself from sight. Only other grasshoppers are silent when alarmed, and the silence and masking action are related, and together prevent the insect from being detected. But this particular species, or race, or colony, living on the sides of the isolated sierra, had acquired a contrary habit, resembling a habit of gregarious birds and mammals. For this informing sound (unless it mimicked some warning-sound, as of a rattlesnake, which it didn't) could not possibly be beneficial to individuals living alone, as grasshoppers generally do, but, on the contrary, only detrimental; and such a habit was therefore purely for the public good, and could only have arisen in a species that always lived in communities.|$|E
5000|$|I {{was at the}} end of {{the line}} signing autographs, when out the corner of my eye I saw someone stage-diving over the barrier at me. <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> back; this guy had latched onto my lapels. I looked down and the nutter was trying to bury his face in my crotch, so I cracked him twice in the back of the head -- not too hard -- but enough to get his attention, because he did let go. I think he was then just {{grabbing}} for a hand hold because the guys were on him, and he reached up and caught my glasses.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. If {{we are to}} {{understand}} human-level intelligence, we need {{to understand}} how meanings can be learned without explicit instruction. <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> toward that understanding by showing how symbols can emerge from a system that looks for regularity in the experiences of its visual and proprioceptive sensory systems. More specifically, the implemented system builds descriptions up from low-level perceptual information and, without supervision, discovers regularities in that information. Then, the system, with supervision, associates the regularity with symbolic tags. Experiments conducted with the implementation shows that it successfully learns symbols corresponding to blocks in a simple 2 D blocks world, and learns to associate the position of its eye with the position of its arm. In the course of this work, I propose a model of an adaptive knowledge representation scheme that is intrinsic to the model and not parasitic on meanings captured in some external system, such as the head of a human investigator. ...|$|R
