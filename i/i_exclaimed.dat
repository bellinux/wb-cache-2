2500|$|When Ament {{became aware}} of the {{criticism}} of his activities and the subsequent controversy, he was affected adversely. Ament admitted the strain {{in a letter to his}} wife on Sunday, 27 January 1901: [...] "I am doing what I do not recall that I ever did before, remaining at home deliberately and missing all the services. I need the rest and felt that it was imperative. You see there is no let up for me. It is a constant strain from morning till night." [...] Missionary colleague Miss Nellie Naomi Russell (born Ontonagon, Michigan, 31 March 1862; died 22 August 1911 in China) records: ...when he was weary in body and mind, there came like a thunderbolt the article by Mark Twain in the North American Review. I remember that day I went to his study on a matter of business, and found him sitting at his desk as if stricken at the heart. <b>I</b> <b>exclaimed,</b> [...] "What is it? Are you ill?" [...] "If I am what that man says, I am not fit for you to speak to me ! I feel as though I should go off and hide myself in a cave in the mountain, never again to be seen of man." [...] I thought he had gone out of his head with all his cares, and I replied, [...] " [...] What you need is rest and a doctor, and I am going to send for one." [...] If the writer of that article could have seen how he suffered he would have felt that every cent he received for that article would be a red hot coal of fire. A brave, masterful man he was, ever ready to relieve, not to add to the sum of human suffering, and while in some things he may have been unwise, his mistakes, whatever they may have been, were of the head and not the heart.|$|E

She had, indeed, a {{very slight}} smattering of that language--of which more hereafter--but [...] "Noble heroine" [...] was not {{at that time in}} her vocabulary! ...|$|E
60|$|But I {{lifted the}} apron. ‘Why, it’s “The Master of Ballantrae!”’ <b>I</b> <b>exclaimed,</b> shocked.|$|E
6000|$|... "Gets to Heidelberg at 4?" [...] <b>I</b> <b>exclaim.</b> [...] "Does {{the whole}} {{distance}} {{in two and}} a quarter hours? Why, we were all night coming down!" ...|$|R
60|$|I will here record my experience. Ever when I {{meet with}} the {{doctrine}} of regeneration and faith and free grace simply announced--"So it is!"--then I believe; my heart leaps forth to welcome it. But as soon as an explanation nation or reason is added, such explanations, namely, and reasonings as I have any where met with, then my heart leaps back again, recoils, and <b>I</b> <b>exclaim,</b> Nay! Nay! but not so.|$|R
6000|$|Prosp. So am not I. No marriages can prosper, [...] Which {{are with}} murderers made; look on that corpse. [...] This, whilst he lived, was young Hippolito; [...] That infant duke of Mantua, sir, whom you [...] Exposed with me; and here I bred him up, [...] Till that blood-thirsty man, that Ferdinand---- [...] But why do <b>I</b> <b>exclaim</b> on him, when justice [...] Calls to unsheath her sword against his guilt? ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Nonsense, Steerforth!' <b>I</b> <b>exclaimed.</b> 'You don't mean to {{say that}} there is any {{affinity}} between nautical matters and ecclesiastical matters?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'There {{never was}} a happier one!' <b>I</b> <b>exclaimed,</b> laying down the carving-knife and fork. 'There is nothing Traddles likes so much!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You seem to {{have almost}} as low an opinion of foreigners as your {{respected}} aunt!' <b>I</b> <b>exclaimed,</b> looking quizzically at him.|$|E
6000|$|Will our grandsons {{believe in}} these times ... that this Ophir--that this California, where every river is a Tmolus and a Pactolus, every hillock is a gold-field--does not contain a cradle, a puddling-machine, a quartz-crusher, a pound of mercury? That half the {{washings}} are wasted because quicksilver is unknown? That whilst convict labour is attainable, not a company has been formed, not a surveyor has been sent out? <b>I</b> <b>exclaim</b> with Dominie Sampson--'Pro-di-gious!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Take counsel first, <b>I</b> entreat,' <b>exclaimed</b> Mericour. 'The Ribaumonts {{have much}} {{influence}} with the Guise family, {{and now you}} have offended Monsieur.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'And <b>I</b> say,' <b>exclaimed</b> Mrs Nickleby, {{laying the}} paper down in triumph, 'that if your uncle don't object, it's {{well worth the}} trial.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, surely," [...] <b>I</b> <b>exclaimed,</b> {{crossing}} over {{to examine the}} animal more closely, [...] "why, yes, you've got Dick Dunkerman's cat." ...|$|E
60|$|I grew grave at once; Harold Tillington and the {{situation}} were serious. 'What can he want here?' <b>I</b> <b>exclaimed,</b> drawing back.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, I see," [...] <b>I</b> <b>exclaimed,</b> interrupting--"the {{industrial}} classes {{fear that}} the army may destroy, or at least subdue, their discontent." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Of {{course he}} will,' said Mr. Jingle pausing--'outrageous.' 'Oh, Mr. Jingle, what CAN <b>I</b> say!' <b>exclaimed</b> the {{spinster}} aunt, in another flood of despair.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, <b>I</b> know!' <b>exclaimed</b> Alice, {{who had not}} {{attended}} to this last remark, 'it's a vegetable. It doesn't look like one, but it is.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'There, {{what have}} <b>I</b> done?' <b>exclaimed</b> Miss Vincent in dismay. 'But I {{had only just}} got the letter, and had barely glanced through it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then, 'come on, Macduff,'" [...] <b>I</b> <b>exclaimed,</b> {{stepping}} out briskly, {{and though he}} had never read Shakespeare, Marût understood and followed.|$|E
6000|$|... "My mother--my noble-hearted, right-judging and right-feeling mother--never!" [...] <b>I</b> <b>exclaimed,</b> in a {{burst of}} feeling I found it {{impossible}} to control.|$|E
6000|$|... "She!--the beautiful!--the gorgeous!" [...] <b>I</b> <b>exclaimed.</b> [...] "And {{how have}} you prevailed with such a woman to work in this squalid element?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dolt that I am," [...] <b>I</b> {{suddenly}} <b>exclaimed,</b> [...] "to be fooling away my {{time when}} the nearest railway station or hotel is perhaps twenty miles away." ...|$|R
60|$|He said a {{good deal}} more to this effect, and <b>I</b> {{remember}} <b>exclaiming,</b> 'Oh, Clarence, the old story!' and then being frightened at the whiteness that came over his face.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, <b>I</b> see,' <b>exclaimed</b> the Grand Master, looking {{extremely}} pleased; 'yes, yes--good, good--better and better. You are {{the gentleman}} of {{whom we have}} heard. Yes; we know you, Mr. Pickwick; we know you.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Stuff and rubbish!" [...] <b>I</b> <b>exclaimed,</b> {{then turned}} and listened to Harût who, not {{understanding}} our Dutch conversation, was speaking once more.|$|E
6000|$|... 'And {{are there}} Snobs in this Elysium?' <b>I</b> <b>exclaimed,</b> {{jumping into the}} lavender-perfumed bed. Ponto's snoring boomed from the {{neighbouring}} bed-room in reply.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{would that}} I could let Monmouth {{know that his}} letters were delivered,' <b>I</b> <b>exclaimed,</b> seating myself {{on the side of}} the bed.|$|E
60|$|Before <b>I</b> could <b>exclaim,</b> {{he assured}} {{me that he had}} taken no liberty, that he had not intruded. He was called in. Otherwise he would not have dreamed of {{breaking}} in upon Heyst's privacy.|$|R
6000|$|... “Dear me, {{how stupid}} <b>I</b> am!” <b>exclaimed</b> Will after a pause. “You know that wall we were {{repairing}} to-day? It {{was only about}} fourteen {{feet above the ground}} outside, so we should have no difficulty in dropping down.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘Heavens! what do <b>I</b> hear?’ <b>exclaimed</b> Mr. Cymon Tuggs. ‘Is it possible! can I believe my—Come up!’ (This last unsentimental {{parenthesis}} {{was addressed}} to the donkey, who, with his head between his fore-legs, appeared to be examining the state of his shoes with great anxiety.) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But I {{must speak}} to him, Guilbert," [...] <b>I</b> <b>exclaimed,</b> setting foot upon the top step. [...] "I have {{travelled}} expressly from Paris." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But, dear me, Abdul," [...] <b>I</b> <b>exclaimed,</b> [...] "surely this {{situation}} is desperate? What can your nation subsist on in such a situation?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How could I!" [...] <b>I</b> <b>exclaimed.</b> [...] "You were {{surrounded}} by prime ministers and ambassadors, and Heaven knows how many other great people." ...|$|E
6000|$|... [232] ["By the way--I have {{a charge}} against you. As the great Mr. Dennis roared {{out on a}} similar occasion--'By G-d, that is my thunder!' so do <b>I</b> <b>exclaim,</b> 'This is my lightning!' I allude to a speech of Ivan's, in the scene with Petrowna and the Empress, where the thought and almost {{expression}} are similar to Conrad's in the 3d canto of The Corsair. I, however, do not say this to accuse you, but to exempt myself from suspicion, {{as there is a}} priority of six months' publication, on my part, between the appearance of that composition and of your tragedies" [...] (Letter to W. Sotheby, September 25, 1815, Letters, 1899, iii. 219). The following are the lines in question:-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What do you mean?" [...] <b>exclaimed</b> <b>I,</b> {{adopting}} the familiar phraseology of my acquaintances:--"Attwood off?--has {{he cut his}} stick?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hallo! <b>I</b> say!" [...] <b>exclaimed</b> Brown, in consternation. [...] "More coffee, Brown," [...] {{demanded the}} ladies simultaneously, at that inauspicious moment.|$|R
