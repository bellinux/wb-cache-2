On September 24, Armstrong signed with Astana.|$|E
25|$|George Peppard's screen {{presence}} {{has some}} agreeable anomalies. He is tough, assured and insolent – {{in a way}} that recalls late Dick Powell rather than early Bogart; but his bright blue eyes and blond hair, his boyish face suggest the all-American athlete, perhaps going to seed. The sophistication is surface deep: you can <b>imagine</b> <b>him</b> in Times Square on a Saturday night, sulky, defiant, out of his depth, not quite certain how he wants to spend the evening.|$|E
25|$|The {{head of the}} {{delivery}} company, Ariel Żurawski, reported that his cousin Łukasz Robert Urban had been driving the truck to Berlin, but {{that he could not}} <b>imagine</b> <b>him</b> being responsible for the attack. Żurawski's company last contacted Urban between 15:00 and 16:00, when Urban reported that he had arrived a day early to the Berlin warehouse and that he had to wait there overnight to unload his truck the following morning. The last photo of Urban still alive was taken at a kebab shop near the ThyssenKrupp warehouse at about 14:00.|$|E

25|$|The murder remains unsolved. Under torture, the {{surviving}} Hashshashin claimed that Richard {{was behind the}} killing, though this is impossible to prove. A less likely suspect was Humphrey IV of Toron, Isabella's first husband. Saladin's involvement has also been alleged, but as Conrad {{was in the middle}} of negotiations with him, but this also seems unlikely as Saladin himself apparently had no love for the Hashshashin. In 1970, Patrick A. Williams argued a plausible case for Henry of Champagne's guilt, but if so, it is difficult to <b>imagine</b> <b>him</b> taking such a bold step without his uncle Richard's approval.|$|E
500|$|Fermi {{received}} {{numerous awards}} {{in recognition of}} his achievements, including the Matteucci Medal in 1926, the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1938, the Hughes Medal in 1942, the Franklin Medal in 1947, and the Rumford Prize in 1953. He was awarded the Medal for Merit in 1946 for his contribution to the Manhattan Project. Fermi was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1950. The Basilica of Santa Croce, Florence, known as the Temple of Italian Glories for its many graves of artists, scientists and prominent figures in Italian history, has a plaque commemorating Fermi. In 1999, Time named Fermi on its list of the top 100 persons of the twentieth century. Fermi was widely regarded as an unusual case of a 20th-century [...] physicist who excelled both theoretically and experimentally. The historian of physics, C. P. Snow, wrote that [...] "if Fermi had been born a few years earlier, one could well <b>imagine</b> <b>him</b> discovering Rutherford's atomic nucleus, and then developing Bohr's theory of the hydrogen atom. If this sounds like hyperbole, anything about Fermi is likely to sound like hyperbole".|$|E

2500|$|In {{the test}} Cartwright scored 37 off 121 balls (including a four off his first ball) and took 0–15 off four overs. Australia won the game. According to one report [...] "Cartwright's balls were sluggish, {{and not just}} after he was struck a low blow at short leg. He {{delivered}} only four overs in this Test and barely broke the 125kph barrier. It is hard to <b>imagine</b> <b>him</b> worrying batsmen at that pace. Marsh and Shane Watson at their quickest have both operated above 140kph." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to the clemency petition, in {{his closing}} arguments, prosecuting District Attorney Robert Martin {{described}} Williams as a [...] "Bengal tiger in captivity in a zoo" [...] {{and said that}} the jury needed to <b>imagine</b> <b>him</b> in his natural [...] "habitat" [...] which was like [...] "going into the back country, into the hinterlands." [...] In a radio interview, Martin insisted that the analogy was not meant to be racial, and instead was a metaphor to the fact that Williams appeared in court dressed in business attire much like an animal in a zoo appears more docile than {{it would be in the}} wild.|$|E
2500|$|A {{more subtle}} but perhaps {{fundamental}} aspect to Nabokov's delineation of his characters {{is that while}} Ivanov, spiritually free, escapes the view of others, the Soviet is already trapped under the others' gaze. How their faces and appearances are revealed to others becomes a defining characteristic of their personalities. The reader is told at the very start that Razor lacks a facade, and when acquaintances tried to recall his appearance they [...] "could only <b>imagine</b> <b>him</b> in profile". Whereas {{as soon as the}} Soviet enters the barber, [...] "the newcomer's reflection appeared in all the mirrors at once, in profile, three-quarter-face, and shown the waxen bald spot in back". The point is more subtle but important nevertheless - the free man escapes the view of others while the man who denies that freedom is forever trapped in the gaze of other people.|$|E

2500|$|At {{that time}} diplomats were {{recruited}} from public schools, and it was said of Bevin {{that it was hard}} to <b>imagine</b> <b>him</b> filling any other job in the Foreign Office except perhaps that of an old and truculent lift attendant. In praise of Bevin, his Permanent Secretary at the Foreign Office (Alexander Cadogan) wrote, [...] "He knows a great deal, is prepared to read any amount, seems to take in what he does read, and is capable of making up his own mind and sticking up for his (and our) point of view against anyone." [...] An alternative view is offered by Charmley, who writes that Bevin read and wrote with some difficulty, and that examination of Foreign Office documents shows little sign of the frequent annotations made by Anthony Eden, suggesting that Bevin preferred to reach most of his decisions after oral discussion with his advisers.|$|E
2500|$|Seven {{unpublished}} {{drawings for}} the book were also displayed at the museum's exhibit, including fearsome looking baobab trees ready to destroy the prince's home asteroid, {{as well as a}} picture of the story's narrator, the forlorn pilot, sleeping next to his aircraft. That image was likely omitted to avoid giving the story a 'literalness' that would distract its readers, according to one of the Morgan Library's staff. According to Christine Nelson, curator of literary and historical manuscripts at the Morgan, [...] "he image evokes Saint-Exupéry's own experience of awakening in an isolated, mysterious place. You can almost <b>imagine</b> <b>him</b> wandering without much food and water and conjuring up the character of the Little Prince." [...] Another reviewer noted that the author [...] "chose the best illustrations... to maintain the ethereal tone he wanted his story to exude. Choosing between ambiguity and literal text and illustrations, Saint-Exupéry chose in every case to obfuscate." [...] Not a single drawing of the story's narrator–pilot survived the author's editing process; [...] "he was very good at excising what was not essential to his story".|$|E
2500|$|The unnamed, {{oblivious}} {{manager of}} the engineering division of Dilbert's company. Scott Adams states that he never named him {{so that people can}} <b>imagine</b> <b>him</b> to be their boss. In earlier strips he was depicted as a stereotypical late-middle-aged balding middle manager with jowls; it was not until later that he developed his signature [...] "pointy hair" [...] and the jowls disappeared. He is hopelessly incompetent at management, and often tries to compensate for his lack of skills with countless group therapy sessions and business strategies which rarely bear fruit. He does not understand technical issues but always tries to disguise this, usually by using buzzwords he also does not understand. The Boss treats his employees alternately with enthusiasm or neglect; he often uses them to his own ends regardless of the consequences to them. Adams himself wrote that [...] "He's not sadistic, just uncaring". His level of intelligence varies from near-vegetative to perceptive and clever, depending on the strip's comic needs. [...] His utter lack of consistent business ethics, however, is perfectly consistent. His brother is a demon named [...] "Phil, the Prince of Insufficient Light", and according to Adams, the pointy hair is intended to remind one of devils' horns.|$|E
6000|$|The late Sir Percy and Lady Shelley had {{in these}} days {{attached}} [...] themselves warmly to R. L. S., and saw in his ways and character a [...] living image of those of the poet, Sir Percy's father, as they [...] <b>imagined</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R

2500|$|While {{the details}} of his {{biography}} are vague and fragmentary, {{the details of}} Rameau's personal and family life are almost completely obscure. Rameau's music, so graceful and attractive, completely contradicts the man's public image and what we know of his character as described (or perhaps unfairly caricatured) by Diderot in his satirical novel Le Neveu de Rameau. Throughout his life, music was his consuming passion. It occupied his entire thinking; Philippe Beaussant calls him a monomaniac. Piron explained that [...] "His heart and soul were in his harpsichord; once he had shut its lid, there was no one home." [...] Physically, Rameau was tall and exceptionally thin, as can be seen by the sketches we have of him, including a famous portrait by Carmontelle. He had a [...] "loud voice." [...] His speech was difficult to understand, just like his handwriting, which was never fluent. As a man, he was secretive, solitary, irritable, proud of his own achievements (more as a theorist than as a composer), brusque with those who contradicted him, and quick to anger. It is difficult to <b>imagine</b> <b>him</b> among the leading wits, including Voltaire (to whom he bears more than a passing physical resemblance), who frequented La Pouplinière's salon; his music was his passport, and it made up for his lack of social graces.|$|E

5000|$|The anime Mononoke {{is about}} a {{medicine}} seller that searches and kills monsters found in the Japanese folklore. One arc features a Noppera-bo that resembles his appearance a lot.
