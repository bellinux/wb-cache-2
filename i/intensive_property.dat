500|$|The terms {{elastance}} and elastivity were {{coined by}} Oliver Heaviside in 1886. [...] Heaviside coined {{a great many}} of the terms used in circuit analysis today, such as impedance, inductance, admittance, and conductance. [...] Heaviside's terminology followed the model of resistance and resistivity with the -ance ending used for extensive properties and the -ivity ending used for intensive properties. [...] The extensive properties are used in circuit analysis (they are the [...] "values" [...] of components) and the intensive properties are used in field analysis. [...] Heaviside's nomenclature was designed to highlight the connection between corresponding quantities in field and circuit. [...] Elastivity is the <b>intensive</b> <b>property</b> of a material corresponding to the bulk property of a component, elastance. [...] It is the reciprocal of permittivity. [...] As Heaviside put it, ...|$|E
2500|$|Thermodynamic entropy is an {{extensive}} property, {{meaning that it}} scales with the size or extent of a system. In many processes {{it is useful to}} specify the entropy as an <b>intensive</b> <b>property</b> independent of the size, as a specific entropy characteristic of the type of system studied. Specific entropy may be expressed relative to a unit of mass, typically the kilogram (unit: [...] ).

5000|$|J.G. Kirkwood and I. Oppenheim define {{thermodynamic}} equilibrium as follows: [...] "A {{system is in}} a state of {{thermodynamic equilibrium}} if, during the time period allotted for experimentation, (a) its <b>intensive</b> <b>properties</b> are independent of time and (b) no current of matter or energy exists in its interior or at its boundaries with the surroundings." [...] It is evident that they are not restricting the definition to isolated or to closed systems. They do not discuss the possibility of changes that occur with [...] "glacial slowness", and proceed beyond the time period allotted for experimentation. They note that for two systems in contact, there exists a small subclass of <b>intensive</b> <b>properties</b> such that if all those of that small subclass are respectively equal, then all respective <b>intensive</b> <b>properties</b> are equal. States of thermodynamic equilibrium may be defined by this subclass, provided some other conditions are satisfied.|$|R
50|$|The {{distinction}} between <b>intensive</b> and extensive <b>properties</b> has some theoretical uses. For example, in thermodynamics, {{according to the}} state postulate, a sufficiently simple system consisting of a single substance requires only two independent intensive variables to fully specify the system's entire state. Other <b>intensive</b> <b>properties</b> are derived from those two variables.|$|R
2500|$|An assay is {{an investigative}} (analytic) {{procedure}} in laboratory medicine, pharmacology, environmental biology and molecular biology for qualitatively assessing or quantitatively measuring the presence, amount, or functional activity {{of a target}} entity (the analyte). [...] The analyte can be a drug, a biochemical substance, or a cell in an organism or organic sample. The measured entity is generally called the analyte, the measurand or {{the target of the}} assay. The assay usually aims to measure an <b>intensive</b> <b>property</b> of the analyte and express it in the relevant measurement unit (e.g. molarity, density, functional activity in enzyme international units, degree of some effect in comparison to a standard, etc.).|$|E
2500|$|When {{performing}} a thermodynamic analysis, it is typical {{to speak of}} intensive and extensive properties. Properties which depend {{on the amount of}} gas (either by mass or volume) are called extensive properties, while properties that do not depend on the amount of gas are called intensive properties. Specific volume is an example of an <b>intensive</b> <b>property</b> because it is the ratio of volume occupied by a unit of mass of a gas that is identical throughout a system at equilibrium. 1000 atoms a gas occupy the same space as any other 1000 atoms for any given temperature and pressure. This concept is easier to visualize for solids such as iron which are incompressible compared to gases. [...] Since a gas fills any container in which it is placed, volume is an extensive property.|$|E
50|$|The {{ratio of}} two {{extensive}} {{properties of the}} same object or system is an <b>intensive</b> <b>property.</b> For example, the ratio of an object's mass and volume, which are two extensive properties, is density, which is an <b>intensive</b> <b>property.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Properties can be {{combined}} to give new properties, which may be called derived, or composite properties. For example, mass and volume can {{be combined}} to give density. These composite properties can also be classified as intensive or extensive. Suppose a composite property, , {{is a function of}} a set of <b>intensive</b> <b>properties,</b> , and a set of extensive properties, , which can be shown as [...] If the size of the system is changed by some scaling factor, , only the extensive properties will change, since <b>intensive</b> <b>properties</b> are independent {{of the size of the}} system.

5000|$|The {{corresponding}} {{expression for}} {{the ratio of}} specific heat capacities remains the same since the thermodynamic system size-dependent quantities, whether on a per mass or per mole basis, cancel out in the ratio because specific heat capacities are <b>intensive</b> <b>properties.</b> Thus: ...|$|R

50|$|A {{specific}} {{property is}} obtained by dividing an extensive property {{of a system}} by {{the mass of the}} system. For example, heat capacity is an extensive property of a system. Dividing heat capacity, Cp, by the mass of the system gives the specific heat capacity, cp, which is an <b>intensive</b> <b>property.</b> When the extensive property is represented by an upper-case letter, the symbol for the corresponding <b>intensive</b> <b>property</b> is usually represented by a lower-case letter.

50|$|The {{reciprocal}} of {{the density}} of a substance is occasionally called its specific volume, a term sometimes used in thermodynamics. Density is an <b>intensive</b> <b>property</b> in that {{increasing the amount of}} a substance does not increase its density; rather it increases its mass.|$|E
50|$|Mass {{transfer}} coefficients can {{be estimated}} from many different theoretical equations, correlations, and analogies that are functions of material <b>properties,</b> <b>intensive</b> <b>properties</b> and flow regime (laminar or turbulent flow).

40|$|We {{estimated}} photospheric velocities by separately {{applying the}} Fourier Local Correlation Tracking (FLCT) and Differential Affine Velocity Estimator (DAVE) methods to 2708 co-registered pairs of SOHO/MDI magnetograms, with nominal 96 -minute cadence and ~ 2 " pixels, from 46 active regions (ARs) from 1996 - 1998 {{over the time}} interval t 45 when each AR was within 45 ^o of disk center. For each magnetogram pair, we computed the average estimated radial magnetic field, B; and each tracking method produced an independently estimated flow field, u. We then quantitatively characterized these magnetic and flow fields by computing several extensive and <b>intensive</b> <b>properties</b> of each; extensive properties scale with AR size, while <b>intensive</b> <b>properties</b> do not depend directly on AR size. <b>Intensive</b> flow <b>properties</b> included moments of speeds, horizontal divergences, and radial curls; extensive flow properties included sums of these properties over each AR, and a crude proxy for the ideal Poynting flux, the total |u| B^ 2. Several magnetic quantities were also computed, including: total unsigned flux; {{a measure of the}} amount of unsigned flux near strong-field polarity inversion lines, R; and the total B^ 2. Next, using correlation and discriminant analysis, we investigated the associations between these properties and flares from the GOES flare catalog, when averaged over both t 45 and shorter time windows, of 6 and 24 hours. We found R and total |u| B^ 2 to be most strongly associated with flares; no <b>intensive</b> flow <b>properties</b> were strongly associated with flares.

50|$|An <b>intensive</b> <b>property</b> is a {{physical}} quantity whose value {{does not depend on}} the amount of the substance for which it is measured. For example, the temperature of a system in thermal equilibrium {{is the same as the}} temperature of any part of it. If the system is divided the temperature of each subsystem is identical. The same applies to the density of a homogeneous system; if the system is divided in half, the mass and the volume change in the identical ratio and the density remains unchanged. Additionally, the boiling point of a substance is another example of an <b>intensive</b> <b>property.</b> For example, the boiling point of water is 100 °C at a pressure of one atmosphere, which remains true regardless of quantity.|$|E

50|$|One {{major theme}} is the intensive, which opposes (and for Deleuze, precedes) the extensive.

In science, an object's <b>intensive</b> <b>properties</b> are those, like density and specific heat, that do not change with quantity. Correspondingly, while extensive properties can be subject to division (the object can be cut in half), intensive qualities cannot be simply reduced or divided without transforming their bearer entirely.|$|R
