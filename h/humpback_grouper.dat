50|$|The <b>humpback</b> <b>grouper</b> is a {{medium-sized}} fish which grows up to 70 cm.Its particular body shape makes this grouper quite impossible to mix {{up with other}} fishes. Its body is compressed laterally and is relatively high. This stocky and strange visual effect is accented by its concave profile and its elongated snout which gives it a humpbacked appearance.|$|E
50|$|The diet of this grouper {{is based}} on small fishes and crustaceans. Like the members of its family, the <b>humpback</b> <b>grouper</b> is demersal, solitary (except during mating periods), defends a territory, and is an ambush predator. Its feeding {{activity}} is maximal at sunrise and/or at sunset. This species is a protogynous hermaphrodite, which means {{it is able to}} change from the sex it was born as to the opposite sex.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{different}} initial time of artificial feeding {{to the growth}} and the activities of digestive enzymes of <b>humpback</b> <b>grouper</b> larvae Cromileptes altivelis (Valenciennes 1828). <b>Humpback</b> <b>grouper</b> is an economically marine finfish commodity, so {{it is important to}} scale up its culture. In aquaculture, feed is dominantly affecting to fish growth. Besides live feeds, theartificial feed is also given to fulfill the need of nutrient for larvae. However, the capability of larvae to digest the artificial feed is still limited because of its simplicity and immaturity of digestive system structure. Digestive enzymes are a biological indicator to figure out the capability of larvae to digest the artificial feed. This research was conducted to find out the influence of different initial time of artificial feeding to the growth and digestive enzyme activity of <b>humpback</b> <b>grouper</b> larvae. Larvae rearing were done in hatchery. Larvae were fed with live feed rotifers started in the evening of the second day. The treatment given in this research was the difference initial time of artificial feeding, i. e: (A) given at 8 days old larvae and (B) given at 13 days old larvae. The variable observations were the growth and digestive enzyme activity of larvae. The results indicate that the different initial time of artificial feeding influenced to thegrowth and digestive enzyme activity of <b>humpback</b> <b>grouper</b> larvae. Total length, body weight, length of dorsal spine and ventral spine of 30 days old <b>humpback</b> <b>grouper</b> larvae on treatment A were 17. 47 ± 2. 35 mm, 0. 11 ± 0. 04 g, 6. 83 ± 0. 45 mm and 5. 07 ± 0. 50 mm, respectively, while on treatment B were 13. 23 ± 2. 53 mm, 0. 04 ± 0. 02 g, 5. 73 ± 1. 11 mm and 4. 48 ± 0. 50 mm, respectively. Up to 30 days old larvae, protease and amylase enzymes activities of larvae on treatment A was higher than on treatment B, while lipase enzymes activity of larvae on treatment B was higher than on treatment A.

The eggs that used were including orange spotted grouper (Epinephelus coiodes), brown marbled grouper (E. microdon), tiger grouper (E. fuscoguttatus) and <b>humpback</b> <b>grouper</b> (Cromileptes altivelis). Investigated variables were embryonic development pattern, incubation time and hatching rate. The result showed that the eggs incubated in temperature range of 24 - 31 °C had the normal sequence of embryonic development pattern, but in temperature of 21 - 22 °C performed irregular sequence and the embryonic development stopped at blastula or gastrula stage or even the eggs could still develop but the body of hatched larvae were abnormal. In lower temperature incubation, the incubation time was longer and the hatching rate of eggs was lower than those in higher temperature. Therefore the optimum temperature for incubation of orange spotted grouper, marbled grouper, tiger grouper and <b>humpback</b> <b>grouper</b> eggs ranged between 24 - 31 ºC, while the lowest possible temperature was 24 ºC...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} {{to determine the effects of}} inorganic selenium (sodium selenite) and organic selenium (selenomethionine) supplementation on growth and viability of juvenile <b>humpback</b> <b>grouper</b> (Cromileptes altivelis). The experiment was designed as a completely randomized design with eight treatments and three replications. The treatment being tested was source and dosages of selenium ie., inorganic selenium (sodium selenite) supplementation with dosages of 0. 5, 1, 2, and 4 mg Se/kg diet and organic selenium (selenomethionine) with dosages of 1, 2, and 4 mg Se/kg diet. Another treatment was unsupplemented selenium. Juveniles <b>humpback</b> <b>grouper</b> at an initial average length of 6, 39 ± 0, 41 cm and body weight of 4, 49 ± 0, 65 g were reared in 90 × 40 × 35 cm 3 aquaria and fed artificial diet (pellet) two times daily (08. 00 and 16. 00) at satiation. Fishes were reared for 40 days at a stocking density of 12 fish per aquarium on sea water with salinity of 30 – 31 ppt and temperature of 28 – 29 °C. The results of this study showed that the source of selenium supplementation (inorganic or organic) affected growth performance, glutathione peroxidase (GPx) enzyme activity, and blood profiles of the experimental fish. Generally, it was found that selenomethionine supplementation resulted in better fish performance than sodium selenite. In sodium selenite supplementation, survival declined with the increased dosages of Se in the diet, and the supplementation at dosage of 0, 5 mg Se/kg diet showed a toxic effects. Histopatological test showed that there were damage in livers, kidneys, and intestines of fish supplemented with sodium selenite from 0. 5 to 4 mg Se/kg diet. On the contrary, supplementation of selenomethionine up to 4 mg Se/kg did not show any signs of toxicity and the survival was on 86. 11 to 97. 22 %. Feed efficiency, protein retention, lipid retention, and Se retention indicated that a dosage of 4 mg Se/kg selenomethionine supplementation was the best dosage.

30|$|Grouper is a {{high value}} cultured marine fish {{especially}} in the Southeast Asia countries including Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines (Liao et al., 2001; Yashiro, 2008). The major cultured species are giant grouper, Epinephelus lanceolatus (Yashiro, 2008), tiger grouper, Epinephelus fuscoguttatus (Sugama et al., 2008), malabar grouper, Epinephelus malabaricus (Yashiro, 2008), orange spotted grouper, Epinephelus coioides (Toledo et al. 1996), <b>humpback</b> <b>grouper,</b> Cromileptes altivelis (Marte, 2003), leopard coralgrouper, Plectropomus leopardus (De Silva, 1998) and hybrid grouper, (Epinephelus lanceolatus X Epinephelus fuscoguttatus). Heemstra and Randall (1993) estimated that 90 % of the world’s harvest on marine food is derived from artisanal fisheries, which groupers are the major component. According to Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) (2013), world aqu of (2880 saculture production of groupers was around 6000 – 7000 tones per annum, valued at about USD 60 million and the bulk of this production came from wild seed stock {{due to lack of}} reared seed that suffered disease problems.|$|E

40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were to find out the {{potential}} of Patikan kerbau (Euphorbia hirta) as antibacterial on Aeromonas hydropilla and Vibrio alginolyticus. Phytochemical study on E. hirta leaves was carried out to determine the chemical compounds group and resulted in the presence of phenolic, terpenoid and tannin group in the leaves. The antibacterial assay by diffusion agar using paper disc showed that methanol and aqueou extract either of using dried powder leaves boiling method or fresh leaves boiling method were able to inhibit the growth of Aeromonas. hydropilla and Vibrio alginolyticus. The highest antibacterial activity against those bacteria was shown by methanol extract. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of this methanol extract was found to be 0. 156 and 0. 625 % by using agar dilution method. In addition, the toxicity study exhibited that treatment of cat fish (Clarias batrachus) larvae and <b>humpback</b> <b>grouper</b> (Cromileptes altivelis) larvae with E. hirta methanol extract at the concentration of 1 % for 5 minutes did not give any toxic effect...|$|E
40|$|Appropriate feed {{composition}} {{is important for}} growth, disease resistance, and immune activi-ty in aquacultured fish. A nutritionally adequate diet satisfies 3 needs: fuel (chemical energy), the organic raw materials for biosynthesis, and a sup-ply of essential nutrients. Proteins, lipids, and car-bohydrates are the critical components of the diet for supplying the carbon skeleton and energy. Fish may convert protein into an energy source if non-protein energy sources (carbohydrates and fats) are not present in sufficient quantities in the diet. Therefore, {{a certain amount of}} lipids is usual-ly included in diets as an energy source and also to increase the protein efficiency (Cho and Kaushik 1990, Williams et al. 2003). It was also reported that increasing the level of dietary lipids beyond about 9 %- 10 % did not improve fish growth rates, but instead reduced the fish s appetite in <b>humpback</b> <b>grouper</b> (Cromileptes altivelis) (Williams et al. 2004). High protein requirements (Chen and Tsai 1994, Shiau and Lan 1996) and low utilization of carbohydrates and lipids in groupers have been reported (Shiau and Lin 2001 2002, Lin and Shiau 2003). So it can be inferred that groupers, marine carnivores, are adapted to using protein as the preferred energ...|$|E
40|$|In fish grouper escpecially <b>humpback</b> <b>grouper</b> culture, {{seed and}} {{broodstock}} quality and availability determine the production success. Main supply of wild broodstock still dominates grouper hatchery activities, therefore, {{the exploitation of}} the wild broodstock is very high. Efforts to use the supply of cultured broodstock through selection and breeding processes will greatly determine their culture success. The purpose of this experiment was to get seeds from the cross breeding between F- 2 and F- 0. The research used two (2) concrete tanks with volume of 75 m 3 each. Each tank was filled with 20 fishes consisting of 10 fishes of F- 2 and 10 fishes of F- 0. The experiment was conducted the Institute of Mariculture Research and Development, Gondol, Bali. The result showed a good gonadal development and natural spawning of cross breeding between F- 2 and F- 0. Total number of eggs (1. 320. 000) was found the highest in May in tank A, while the highest fertilized eggs of 385. 000 were found in June.

The aim {{of this study}} was to produce recombinant of GSDIV capsid protein and its protection to humpback grouper Cromileptes altivelis against grouper sleepy disease iridovirus (GSDIV). A major capsid protein (MCP)  was selected for use as a crude subunit vaccines. This gene target (MCP) was inserted to the protein expression system vector of pET SUMO and cloned in cells bacteria Escherichia coli strain BL- 21. The MCP was succeded to be induced using 1 mM of IPTG. Results of protein analysis using MALDI TOF-TOF indicated that the MCP has measurement of 49. 566 kDa with PI index of 6. 00, and contained 453 amino acids. BLAST homology analysis exhibited that the amino acid sequence of the MCP showed high similarity with MCP of Red Sea Bream Iridovirus (RSIV). E. coli expressing MCP protein was inactivated using 0. 03 % formalin overnight and washed using PBS. The inactivated E. coli as a crude subunit vaccine was then injected intramuscularly to <b>humpback</b> <b>grouper</b> juveniles. Subsequently, the juveniles were challenged tested with GSDIV.
