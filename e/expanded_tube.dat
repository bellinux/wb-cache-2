The connections are reinforced with Densified Veneer Wood. A good energy dissipative capacity is observed for each joint tested, making them particularly suited {{for use in}} earthquake-prone regions. Hence, a numerical model for the cyclic behaviour of these joints is presented and validated against the experimental data. The proposed modelling approach represents a beam-column joint schematized with shell elements for the wooden parts and non-linear one-degree-of-freedom springs for each tube employed in the connections. The model is able to accurately reproduce the hysteretic behaviour of the joint, minimising the differences in total potential energy between numerical curves and experimental results.

The <b>tube</b> <b>expanding</b> percentages within the ranges of expanding pressure from 160 MPa to 300 MPa for different materials joints were obtained.

Pull-out force is less than the push-out force and both of them increase with increasing expansion pressures.

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{has been carried}} out into a new technique for upheaving soil bodies. An example of where this technique can be applied is a road embankment that has settled at a different rate from a bridge because of the weight and properties of the subsoil. The conventional technique for remedying the situation involves closing the road, removing the asphalt and supplementing the underlying material. All this is expensive, time consuming and causes additional traffic jams. The new method under investigation involves upheaving the road embankment by means of <b>expanding</b> <b>tubes.</b> In this technique, tubes of woven material are thrust horizontally into the road embankment, starting at the slope, by means of steel tubes.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study to}} the moment-rotation aspects of two 3 -member DVW reinforced timber connections with an inter-connecting steel plate used as middle member. Previous studies showed that reinforcing dowel-type timber connections with ‘densified veneer wood’ (DVW) and using <b>expanded</b> <b>tube</b> fasteners results in connections with superior structural properties compared to all conventional connections. In this connection type, the DVW prevents premature timber splitting. The tube fasteners aid a high initial stiffness, a high ductility and a high reliability. A drawback of the connection, already in a 3 -member connection, is the total thickness. By using only two side members and a much thinner, steel middle member, the thickness is strongly reduced. The steel middle member {{is used as a}} connecting interface in a flitch plate connection. This generally results in a 50 % reduction of the rotational stiffness. However, it is shown by an analytical and numerical study, that the rotational stiffness of two closely spaced, flitch plate DVW connections acting in series remains unchanged if certain conditions are fulfilled. Two full connection tests are performed to confirm the analytical and numerical results.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the effect of process {{parameters}} on the peak load and the energy absorption of the expansion of thin walled tubes using a die. The energy absorption and peak load during the expansion process were calculated for various punch angles (α) and with different expansion ratios (rp/ro) at different temperatures (T) by finite element analysis where rp is the punch outer radius and ro is the tube inner radius. The effect of these input parameters on the response parameters peak load, energy absorption and local buckling have been critically analyzed using Taguchi method. It is observed that the peak load and energy absorption of the expansion tube is influenced by expansion ratio (rp/ro), punch angle followed by tube temperature. The energy absorption of the <b>expanded</b> <b>tube</b> increases as the rp/ro ratio increases and also larger punch angle improves the energy absorption. Whereas the minimum expansion ratio (rp/ro) decreases the peak load at higher temperature and medium punch angle.

40|$|New and {{promising}} treatments for {{coronary heart disease}} are enabled by vascular scaffolds made of poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA), as demonstrated by Abbott Vascular’s bioresorbable vascular scaffold. PLLA is a semicrystalline polymer whose degree of crystallinity and crystalline microstructure depend on the thermal and deformation history during processing. In turn, the semicrystalline morphology determines scaffold strength and biodegradation time. However, spatially-resolved information about the resulting material structure (crystallinity and crystal orientation) is needed to interpret in vivo observations. The first manufacturing step of the scaffold is tube expansion in a process similar to injection blow molding. Spatial uniformity of the tube microstructure {{is essential for the}} consistent production and performance of the final scaffold. For implantation into the artery, solid-state deformation below the glass transition temperature is imposed on a laser-cut subassembly to crimp it into a small diameter. Regions of localized strain during crimping are implicated in deployment behavior. To examine the semicrystalline microstructure development of the scaffold, we employed complementary techniques of scanning electron and polarized light microscopy, wide-angle X-ray scattering, and X-ray microdiffraction. These techniques enabled us to assess the microstructure at the micro and nano length scale. The results show that the <b>expanded</b> <b>tube</b> is very uniform in the azimuthal and axial directions and that radial variations are more pronounced. The crimping step dramatically changes the microstructure of the subassembly by imposing extreme elongation and compression. Spatial information on the degree and direction of chain orientation from X-ray microdiffraction data gives insight into the mechanism by which the PLLA dissipates the stresses during crimping, without fracture. Finally, analysis of the microstructure after deployment shows that it is inherited from the crimping step and contributes to the scaffold’s successful implantation in vivo. ...|$|E

40|$|Poly (L-lactic Acid) (PLLA) is a semicryst. and {{biocompatible}} polymer {{that is used}} in bioresorbable vascular scaffolds {{for the treatment of}} Coronary Heart Disease (CHD). To treat CHD, a PLLA scaffold is deployed in the occluded artery to restore blood circulation. Implants made of PLLA undergo hydrolysis to form L-lactic acid that is readily metabolized by the human body, allowing them to harmlessly disappear in two years. The polymer is subjected to tube expansion and laser cutting before it is crimped onto a balloon. When the crimped scaffold is in position in the diseased artery, the balloon is inflated to deploy the scaffold. The resulting semicryst. structure changes over distances of a few microns, requiring X-ray microdiffraction to shed light on the structural changes that occur in PLLA vascular scaffolds which govern their therapeutic function. Crimping places the outer bend (OB) of a U-crest under elongation and the inner bend (IB) under compression. X-ray diffraction patterns indicate highly oriented PLLA crystallites where elongation was imposed (near the OB) and crystallites tilted out of plane where compression was imposed (at the IB). Between the IB and the OB, there is an unperturbed region with an orientation similar to the <b>expanded</b> <b>tube.</b> Deployment profoundly alters the structure created during crimping. The tilting of crystallites at the IB during crimping allows them to gracefully sep. into diamond shaped voids when the IB is placed under tension during deployment. Consequently, the OB experiences relatively mild compressive stress during deployment and a highly uniform structure is obsd. Despite PLLA's reputation as a brittle plastic, the solid state deformation does not fracture the scaffold; rather, the deployed PLLA scaffold has a high degree of orientation, giving the scaffold the radial strength to hold the blood vessel open...|$|E

This included visual inspection and comparison of heat exchangers manufactured using pressure expansion and mechanical expansion, physical testing of heat exchanger strength and construction, measurement of heat exchanger dimensions, and physical testing of heat transfer performance.

Consistency between coils was maintained in order to isolate the manufacturing method, to the extent possible, for comparison purposes.
