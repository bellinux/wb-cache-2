5|$|After the new Burgundians realise {{they are}} not subject to post-war {{rationing}} or other bureaucratic restrictions, the district <b>is</b> <b>quickly</b> flooded with black marketeers and shoppers; Spiller is unable to handle the rising problems by himself. In response, the British authorities surround the Burgundian territory with barbed wire. The residents retaliate against what they see as heavy-handed bureaucratic action; they stop a London Underground train as it passes through Burgundy, and ask to see passports of all passengers: those without documents are unable to proceed.|$|E
5|$|As {{reported}} in the Prose Edda book Skáldskaparmál, Thor once engages in a duel with Hrungnir, there described as the strongest of the jötnar. Prior to this, Hrungnir had been drunkenly boasting of his desire to, amongst other things, kill all of the gods except Freyja and Sif, whom {{he wanted to take}} home with him. However, at the duel, Hrungnir <b>is</b> <b>quickly</b> killed by the enraged Thor.|$|E
5|$|During an {{inspection}} by Superintendent Chalmers, Principal Skinner lures Bart, Jimbo, Kearney, Dolph and Nelson into a utility basement {{with the promise}} of free mountain bikes and locks the door. Bart escapes through a ventilation shaft and takes Groundskeeper Willie's tractor for a joyride, crashing into Superintendent Chalmers. Rather than giving him detention, Principal Skinner instead expels Bart. After Bart <b>is</b> <b>quickly</b> expelled from a new private Christian school, Marge decides to homeschool Bart.|$|E
50|$|Robert Propst of the Herman Miller {{company is}} usually {{credited}} with inventing systems furniture. His original system named Action Office <b>was</b> <b>quickly</b> copied by other companies. Although these systems were not {{originally intended to}} compress office workers to maximum density, they <b>were</b> <b>quickly</b> adapted to that purpose.|$|R

5|$|In {{a distant}} village, Raja and Kundu meet Dhoopati Viyyanna, a zamindar (aristocrat) and the {{president}} of the panchayat. Viyyanna is a complex character of declining fortunes and generous spirit who believes in respecting his guests. Raju and Viyyanna's daughter Savitri fall in love and their wedding <b>is</b> <b>quickly</b> arranged. Viyyanna also finds a bridegroom named Venkata Ramana, a pleader living in Madras (now Chennai), for Ammadu. Ramana's father, Venkatapathy, demands a large dowry, which Viyyanna promises to pay.|$|E
5|$|In {{the skies}} over Iraq's border with Turkey, an Iraqi fighter pilot shoots down a UFO. Later, in Lexington, Tennessee, a truck driver named Ranheim shoots {{something}} in the dark as another UFO flies overhead. Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) investigate the sighting the next day, but Ranheim <b>is</b> <b>quickly</b> let go by the uncooperative local authorities. In a seemingly inconsequential event, a woman briefly borrows Scully's pen before they leave Tennessee.|$|E
5|$|Mulder {{waits in}} the hotel bar while Scully guards Judy in a hotel room. The assassin enters the room to attack them but <b>is</b> <b>quickly</b> killed by Skinner, who was also there.

After Mulder leaves, he reaches into his drawer and puts his wedding ring back on.|$|E
30|$|Network {{modelling}} {{using only}} one rerouting path cannot significantly minimize additional capacity, {{which means that}} physical resource limits <b>are</b> <b>quickly</b> reached and the network is paralysed for a moment. Because the physical resource limits <b>are</b> <b>quickly</b> reached in [7, 8], the number of failures handled is also reduced.|$|R

5|$|Previous {{practices}} had required {{ships to}} withstand the flooding of a single forward hold, but did not guard against situations where two holds would flood. The case where two after (rear) holds are flooded is no better, because the engine room <b>is</b> <b>quickly</b> flooded, leaving the ship without propulsion. If two holds {{in the middle of}} the ship are flooded, the stress on the hull can become so great that the ship snaps in two.|$|E
5|$|The cliffhanger <b>is</b> <b>quickly</b> resolved, {{while the}} story of the lab plays through Series Two, telling more about the backstory of the virus and the lab's direct {{connection}} with that. The production team's intention was to spend more time exploring the details of survival in the post-virus world and how the various characters cope.|$|E
5|$|The {{most potent}} {{are members of}} the genus Psilocybe, such as P.azurescens, P.semilanceata, and P.cyanescens, but {{psilocybin}} has also been isolated from about a dozen other genera. As a prodrug, psilocybin <b>is</b> <b>quickly</b> converted by the body to psilocin, which has mind-altering effects similar, in some aspects, to those of LSD, mescaline, and DMT. In general, the effects include euphoria, visual and mental hallucinations, changes in perception, a distorted sense of time, and spiritual experiences, and can include possible adverse reactions such as nausea and panic attacks.|$|E

5|$|The {{southern}} Essonne department specialises {{in science}} and technology, and the south-eastern Val-de-Marne, with its wholesale Rungis food market, specialises in food processing and beverages. The Paris region's manufacturing decline <b>is</b> <b>quickly</b> being replaced by eco-industries: these employ about 100,000 workers. In 2011, while only 56,927 construction workers worked in Paris itself, its metropolitan area employed 246,639, in an activity centred largely around the Seine-Saint-Denis (41,378) and Hauts-de-Seine (37,303) departments and the new business-park centres appearing there.|$|E
5|$|A frog's skin is protective, has a {{respiratory}} function, {{can absorb}} water and helps control body temperature. It has many glands, {{particularly on the}} head and back, which often exude distasteful and toxic substances (granular glands). The secretion is often sticky and helps keep the skin moist, protects against the entry of moulds and bacteria, and make the animal slippery and more able to escape from predators. The skin is shed every few weeks. It usually splits {{down the middle of the}} back and across the belly, and the frog pulls its arms and legs free. The sloughed skin is then worked towards the head where it <b>is</b> <b>quickly</b> eaten.|$|E
5|$|Acetylsalicylic acid is a weak acid, {{and very}} little of it is ionized in the stomach after oral administration. Acetylsalicylic acid <b>is</b> <b>quickly</b> absorbed through the cell {{membrane}} in the acidic conditions of the stomach. The increased pH and larger surface area of the small intestine causes aspirin to be absorbed more slowly there, as more of it is ionised. Owing {{to the formation of}} concretions, aspirin is absorbed much more slowly during overdose, and plasma concentrations can continue to rise for up to 24 hours after ingestion.|$|E

5|$|Afterwards, T'Pol {{returns to}} her cabin and is {{surprised}} to find Rajiin inside. She tries to resist, but is soon overcome. Rajiin attempts to flee using the transporter, but <b>is</b> <b>quickly</b> captured {{and placed in the}} brig. As Archer attempts to question her, Lieutenant Reed informs him that two Reptilian ships are on an intercept course. Rajiin admits she was gathering information for the Xindi. Reptilians, after running battles with the crew, retrieve Rajiin and take her back to one of the ships. Enterprise attempts to pursue, but the Xindi enters a subspace vortex. Afterwards, the Council convenes again to discuss the development and construction of a new bio-weapon, a project helped by Archer's bio-data that was stolen by Rajiin.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the fire}} <b>is</b> <b>quickly</b> brought under control, Prescott is {{completely}} cut off. News {{of the events}} in Spoke City soon arrives on Tracy Island. Jeff dispatches Scott in Thunderbird 1, while Virgil and Alan take off in Thunderbird 2 equipped with newly commissioned fire-fighting apparatus. Lowered into the shaft in a protective cage fitted with diacetylene sprinklers, Virgil and Alan clamp the stricken lift and return to ground level, whereupon Prescott is arrested. Police Commissioner Garfield notes that classified documentation regarding criminal organisations, including the Erdman Gang, has been destroyed in the fire. Prescott's claims about the hitch-hiker are validated when the charred remnants of the bracelet are discovered.|$|E
5|$|Back at Stonehenge, the Doctor {{discovers that}} the {{volunteer}} legionaries, including Rory, are Autons, and he <b>is</b> <b>quickly</b> captured as his other orbiting foes materialise around him. Above ground, as Rory fights to retain his human identity, Amy suddenly remembers him, but as his Auton identity emerges he unwillingly shoots {{her in the}} stomach and she dies. The Doctor struggles against his captors, who reveal that they have formed an alliance to imprison him in the Pandorica. Knowing the TARDIS exploding would cause the cracks destroying reality, they believe only the Doctor can operate the TARDIS, and thus removing him will prevent the explosion and save the universe. As the Doctor is sealed into the Pandorica, explosions surround the Earth in space before everything fades to black and silence.|$|E
