50|$|The European Union's <b>General</b> <b>Food</b> <b>Law</b> {{came into}} force in 2002, making {{traceability}} compulsory {{for food and}} feed operators and requiring those businesses to implement traceability systems. The EU introduced its Trade Control and Expert System, or TRACES, in April 2004. The system provides a central database to track movement of animals within the EU and from third countries.

40|$|Purpose: The {{research}} {{presented in}} this paper aims at understanding the views of European food risk management experts on food traceability implementation, implementation of the <b>general</b> <b>food</b> <b>law,</b> and the advantages the system can offer for effective risk mitigation. Design/methodology/approach: Delphi methodology was applied to understand experts' views on the efficiency of existing traceability systems in Europe following the implementation of the <b>General</b> <b>Food</b> <b>Law.</b> An internet survey was administered in two rounds, in order to elicit expert views on changes needed to current traceability practices, if traceability systems are to contribute to improved food safety. Findings: Traceability was considered to be an effective safety- and quality-monitoring system with potential to improve safety within food chains, as well as increasing consumer confidence in food safety and consumer protection. However, the results underlined the need for further improvements, particularly regarding the definition of food chain traceability, enforcement of regulations, and harmonisation of practice. Research limitations/implications: Expert opinion regarding food traceability and its implementation was confined to Europe and the impact of European legislation. Further research at a global level is needed, given the need to trace food and food ingredients across the regional boundaries imposed by European legislation, the increased globalisation of food chains, and the need for pan-global harmonisation of food traceability legislation. Originality/value: The results provide important insights into the advantages and shortcomings of the present European traceability approach enshrined in the European <b>General</b> <b>Food</b> <b>Law.</b> © Emerald Group Publishing Limited...|$|E

50|$|A common {{misconception}} is that Boshintang (and dog meat in general) is outright {{illegal in}} South Korea, {{this is not}} quite true. It is not classified as a livestock (under the Livestock Sanitation Management Act - livestock covered are cattle, horse, donkey, sheep, goat, pig, chicken, duck, geese, turkey, quail, pheasant, rabbit and deer), which some have taken to indicate its illegality, but it simply means it is unregulated except by the more <b>general</b> <b>Food</b> Sanitation <b>Law.</b> As such, restaurants serving Boshintang are subject to regular inspection by city food hygiene inspections (including testing of the dog meat for contaminants), as are all other restaurants. The conditions of the raising and of the slaughtering of the animals {{are not subject to}} inspection, unlike the above regulated livestock.

40|$|The European Economic Community {{was created}} in 1957 when the six {{countries}} signed the Treaty of Rome. Its original goal has been to create a common market. The main instruments in achieving this goal could be defined as four freedoms: the free movement of labour, the free movement of services, the free movement of capital and the free movement of goods. The free movement of goods {{has been the most}} important segment for developing the food law. Although all Member States agreed generally about the free common market, in practice each of the states has been looking for and finding different ways of protecting its own markets. This tendency of Member States is evident through the development of European food law. The European food law development can be divided into two main phases: the first phase that was oriented on the market and the second phase with orientation on food safety and the market. There are two periods during the fi rst, market oriented phase: the period of harmonisation through vertical legislation and the period of harmonisation through horizontal legislation. In the second phase preceded by the ”White Paper on Food Safety“ of European Commission emphasis was on the high level of food safety in the area on the food law and not only on the development of a common market. Th e Regulation No 178, well known as <b>General</b> <b>Food</b> <b>Law</b> adopted in 2002, followed changes in the policy.

If taken seriously, this provision may make it difficult to reach a fair balance of interests. In particular, commercial interests seem to be excluded from the legislature’s balancing of interests. Interests of the food industry are mainly protected through the principle of proportionality as operationalised in Article 6 GFL from which follows that only those burdens may be imposed that on the basis of scientific risk assessment can be considered necessary. The scope of this protection, however, is limited by legislation purportedly based on the precautionary principle reversing the burden of scientific proo...|$|E

Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) can be a reliable way whereby traceability data can be communicated through different paths, through computer-to-computer or mobile phone networks, Internet, or private networks.

40|$|In {{this chapter}} food safety control in {{relation}} to quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa Willd) as food and food ingredient was discussed and evaluated through a critical examination of the current statutory provisions at United Kingdom (UK) and European Union (EU) Levels. The risk if any, posed by quinoa seeds from production to consumption were identified and suggestions for compliance were made. Quinoa though novel in the UK and marketed loosely as superfood apparently does not warrant any specific (vertical) food safety control requirements and thus is not restricted by the Novel Food Regulation (EC) No. 258 / 97. This assertion is supported through the composition; the constituents are non-toxic, consumption of quinoa in South America dates to back to several centuries {{and there is no}} reported adverse food safety incident. However quinoa, like all foods must meet food safety requirements as stated in the Food Safety Act 1990 as amended and Regulation (EC) 178 / 2002 on <b>general</b> <b>food</b> <b>law...</b>|$|E
40|$|The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) was {{strongly}} criticized {{for the food}} safety crises of the 1990 s which included Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE), dioxin, {{foot and mouth disease}} and swine fever to name a few. Even though the first rules on food safety date from the very early days of the EU, a need was recognized to replace a number of these rules accumulated through the years, whose implementation was difficult to monitor, with a simpler and more comprehensive approach. The result was the <b>General</b> <b>Food</b> <b>Law</b> (REGULATION (EC) No 178 / 2002). A core concept introduced was traceability, namely “the ability to trace and follow food, feed, and ingredients through all stages of production, processing and distribution”. Furthermore after the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) Agreements on Agriculture (AoA) stated at the Uruguay Round and the current negotiations within the World Trade Organization (WTO), the EU has to transform a number of domestic support policies in order to be compliant with the Green Box criteria and non- or minimally trade distorting. Lastly taking into account the great concern of consumers worldwide for safe and healthy agricultural and food products, traceability would be suitable for motivating the European agricultural and food producers to differentiate their products from other competitors. The aim {{of this paper is to}} study how traceability has been included within the framework of the new CAP. In the first part of this paper we review the ways in which the issues of food safety were taken into consideration in the various reforms of the CAP from the beginning until the Agenda 2000. In the second part we briefly present the objectives and aims of the <b>General</b> <b>Food</b> <b>Law,</b> paying special attention to the meaning and content of traceability. Finally, in the third part we investigate the ways in which the issue of traceability has affected the shaping of the Mid-term Review of the CAP (2003) and the “Health check on CAP” (2008) through the aspects of Cross Compliance, Market Orientation and Rural Development. Traceability, CAP reforms, Cross Compliance, Market Orientation, Rural Development, Agricultural and Food Policy, Food Consumption/Nutrition/Food Safety,...|$|E
30|$|In {{more recent}} works, the {{relation}} between origin and traceability emerges quite strongly (Leonetti et al., 2009; Chan-Halbrendt et al. 2010; Mane-Kapaj et al. 2010; Gázquez‐Abad and Sánchez‐Pérez 2009; Cicia et al. 2005; Menapace et al. 2008; Deselnicu et al. 2013; Gambaro et al. 2013). Traceability and related labeling information have become increasingly analyzed elements. Traceability means the ability to track food through all stages of production, processing and distribution. Traceability was introduced by the EU’s <b>General</b> <b>Food</b> <b>Law</b> (EC Reg. 178 / 2002). It has been generally shown that information on traceability influences consumer choices, which are ever more geared to food safety (Soler et al. 2002; Krystallis and Ness, 2005). However, the studies in question indicate that consumers consider information {{about the origin of}} the olives the most important element for traceability of the product. Knowledge of all stages of production, processing and distribution does not seem to affect consumer choice, the information about the origin of the raw material seems more important (Cicia et al. 2005; Di Vita et al. 2013).|$|E
