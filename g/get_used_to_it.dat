500|$|Another {{element of}} game {{mechanics}} which received significant criticism was the game's handling of space flight. Paragon's attempt to simulate realistic space physics, including planetary gravitational fields and spaceship inertia, {{is a potential}} source of difficulty for some players.

500|$|The title's {{controls}} and overall gameplay {{were not as}} well-received, with certain critics questioning their accuracy and depth. MacDonald finished every level in first place within one hour using {{only one of the}} four initial characters. While the game also features a hard mode, MacDonald concluded that [...] "Sonic R has more in the personality department than in the depth department". MacDonald and Reiner cited finding the Chaos Emeralds and hidden coins as [...] "difficult", but MacDonald argued that such optional tasks offered little in return, because the hidden characters [...] "are mostly robot versions of the already playable ones". Moreover, Sackenheim noted that the game's controls initially [...] "take some practice to get used to", but added: [...] "Start sliding around corners and letting off the gas at the right times and you'll be finding all of the secrets that Sonic R conceals in no time". Likewise, Nutter called the controls [...] "initially tricky... but incredibly playable," [...] Next Generation stated [...] "the proper techniques, with time, can be learned," [...] and John concluded [...] "once you <b>get</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>it,</b> you'll find a real solid game". The latter reviewer thought the game played better with the digital pad as opposed to Sega's analogue controller. Dan Elektro agreed that the controls were [...] "responsive", but [...] "to a fault": [...] "At high speeds, it's nearly impossible to run in a straight line".|$|E

50|$|Kotaku {{praised the}} game's {{quick and easy}} take on the shooter genre along with the game's visuals and clever enemy design. Its only {{criticism}} was that sometimes controls can feel sluggish.

2500|$|Peter Jackson {{claimed that}} the poor {{reception}} [...] "wasn't particularly surprising" [...] because [...] "it does take you a while to <b>get</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>it.</b> Ten minutes is sort of marginal, it probably needed a little bit more". However, once the entire film was released, many critics retained their complaints. While many noted the clarity and immediacy of the action scenes, they also criticised the picture quality as [...] "hyper-real," [...] clear enough to detect [...] "painted sets" [...] and [...] "prosthetic noses". Some critics did respond positively to the overall effect of the higher frame rate, saying it just {{takes a while to}} get used to– still allowing that the extra clarity can make some scenes look like [...] "actors on a set rather than a scene in a movie".|$|E
2500|$|The ram {{air ducts}} {{at the front}} of the drooping, rounded nose {{squeezed}} frontal area away from the headlight, and this, along with the need for a narrow frontal area, necessitated a stacked headlight and high beam behind a single lens. Moreover, the need to reduce the extreme drag encountered at high speeds determined the Hayabusa's entire bulbous, and much-criticized, bodywork design. Koblenz remarked, [...] "non-traditional styling generates the main controversy of the Hayabusa." [...] When viewed through the eyes of those who judged its beauty on the basis of its functionality, or given a little time to <b>get</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>it,</b> the bike's looks did find admirers. The striking two-tone copper/silver paint scheme was similarly loved by some and hated by others, but was successful if the intent of an all-new, flagship product is to make a bold statement. So while it was called ugly by some in the press, those who aren't appalled by its bulbous silhouette... Styling reminiscent of a walleye pike." [...] this aerodynamic shape was key to the Hayabusa's ability to reach record-setting speeds.|$|E

2500|$|The {{down side}} to this {{performance}} is recoil. The amount of recoil the cartridge generates is a step up from the non-magnum [...]30 caliber (7.62mm) cartridges. Its recoil is about 30% {{greater than that of}} the [...]30-06 Springfield, which is known as a 'stout' cartridge. This would put the [...]300 Winchester Magnum at the upper limit of what most shooters can shoot comfortably for extended shooting sessions. As a rough comparison, the recoil of the [...]300 Winchester Magnum is roughly comparable to a 12 gauge shotgun shooting 1 oz. slugs. This greater recoil can make the [...]300 Winchester Magnum, despite its inherent accuracy advantages, a harder cartridge to shoot accurately, when compared to non-magnum [...]30 caliber cartridges such as the [...]30-06 Springfield or the [...]308 Winchester. On the other hand, recoil is subjective (some are more sensitive to it than others) and one can <b>get</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> with practice. Also, many rifles available today now have effective recoil attenuating features built into them, such as muzzle compensators and energy absorbing stocks and butt-pads, that can significantly lessen recoil as it is felt by the shooter.|$|E

But the veterans have been helpful." [...] Discussing all the Titans rookies (including Ringer), offensive coordinator Mike Heimer-dinger said [...] "Right now, you can tell they're all rookies. But that's about it." [...] Ringer was one of three Titans rookies who remained unsigned trough July 20. Bruce Tollner, Ringer's agent, said of signing Ringer “We are continuing to talk with the Titans, and hopefully we should have something done pretty soon." [...] However, Ringer and the Titans agreed to a multi-year deal on July 21, 2009. His base salary is expected to be $310,000. Titans' running backs coach Earnest Byner said of the running backs, “Each one knows that they're competing for playing time and a position on this team, so there's something to be said about that.” He also said of Ringer, “Bringing in Javon has definitely added to the mix because, right away, guys know he's something to reckon with because they see what he's done out here." ...|$|E
