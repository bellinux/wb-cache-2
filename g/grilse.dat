2500|$|The salmon {{spend about}} {{one to five}} years (depending on the species) in the open ocean, where they {{gradually}} become sexually mature. The adult salmon then return primarily to their natal streams to spawn. Atlantic salmon spend between one and four years at sea. When a fish returns after just one year's sea feeding, it is called a <b>grilse</b> in Canada, Britain, and Ireland. <b>Grilse</b> may be present at spawning, and go unnoticed by large males, releasing their own sperm on the eggs. [...] Prior to spawning, depending on the species, salmon undergo changes. They may grow a hump, develop canine-like teeth, or develop a kype (a pronounced curvature of the jaws in male salmon). All change from the silvery blue of a fresh-run fish from the sea to a darker colour. Salmon can make amazing journeys, sometimes moving hundreds of miles upstream against strong currents and rapids to reproduce. Chinook and sockeye salmon from central Idaho, for example, travel over [...] and climb nearly [...] from the Pacific Ocean as they return to spawn. Condition tends to deteriorate the longer the fish remain in fresh water, and they then deteriorate further after they spawn, when they are known as kelts. In all species of Pacific salmon, the mature individuals die {{within a few days}} or weeks of spawning, a trait known as semelparity. Between 2 and 4% of Atlantic salmon kelts survive to spawn again, all females. However, even in those species of salmon that may survive to spawn more than once (iteroparity), postspawning mortality is quite high (perhaps as high as 40 to 50%.) ...|$|E

40|$|Over {{the last}} 10 years, {{there have been}} {{sporadic}} increases in early sexual maturation (<b>grilsing)</b> in Atlantic salmon (AS) in seawater grow-out sites in New Brunswick with an apparent upward trend. <b>Grilsing</b> in AS reduces flesh quality and growth. With estimated gross revenue of $ 250 million in 2002, losses due to <b>grilsing</b> were estimated {{to be in the}} range of $ 11 -$ 24 million, making <b>grilsing</b> one of the largest economic problems for the salmon aquaculture industry in New Brunswick at the present time. Reasons for <b>grilsing</b> have been experimentally investigated, but remain obscure with complex interactions of husbandry and environmental variables. Some factors believed to influence <b>grilsing</b> include feed intake, growth rate, size, lipid reserves, and water temperature. To maximize the value of fanned AS, knowledge of the factors that may trigger or predict high levels of <b>grilsing</b> would be beneficial to producers and fish health personnel. The objective {{of this study was to}} identify factors associated with an increase in <b>grilsing</b> at AS farms in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, Canada. Results of a questionnaire given to company production managers were analyzed to determine the median prevalence of <b>grilsing</b> and to evaluate the impact of a variety of risk factors. The median prevalence of <b>grilsing</b> for the 266 study cages was 6. 6 % with a within-cage prevalence range of 0 %- 64. 1 %, and for the within farm prevalence for the 24 farms was 6. 6 % with a range of 1. 6 %- 38. 7 %. Significant risk factors included average fish weight in the second August in seawater, the difference in temperature between the first February and the second September in seawater, size of cages, not feeding any moist feed, and feeding intensity. It is possible to adjust management factors to try to reduce the risk of <b>grilsing.</b> The presence of these risk factors may also be used as predictors for <b>grilsing.</b> If they are present, early harvesting of a cage may be warranted. Future studies should concentrate on collecting new information such as the use of lights at the cages to alter the physiologic process of <b>grilsing.</b> To facilitate this and other data collection for future studies, improved and potentially standardized records for companies are essential.

40|$|Early sexual {{maturation}} {{is considered a}} serious drawback for Atlantic salmon aquaculture as it retards growth, increases production times and affects flesh quality. Although both growth and {{sexual maturation}} {{are thought to be}} complex processes controlled by several genetic and environmental factors, selection for these traits has been continuously accomplished since the beginning of Atlantic salmon selective breeding programs. In this genome-wide association study (GWAS) we used a 6. 5 K single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array to genotype ∼ 480 individuals from the Cermaq Canada broodstock program and search for SNPs associated with growth and age at sexual maturation. Using a mixed model approach we identified markers showing a significant association with growth, <b>grilsing</b> (early sexual maturation) and late sexual maturation. The most significant associations were found for <b>grilsing,</b> with markers located in Ssa 10, Ssa 02, Ssa 13, Ssa 25 and Ssa 12, and for late maturation with markers located in Ssa 28, Ssa 01 and Ssa 21. A lower level of association was detected with growth on Ssa 13. Candidate genes, which were linked to these genetic markers, were identified and some of them show a direct relationship with developmental processes, especially for those in association with sexual maturation. However, the relatively low power to detect genetic markers associated with growth (days to 5 kg) in this GWAS indicates the need to use a higher density SNP array in order to overcome the low levels of linkage disequilibrium observed in Atlantic salmon before the information can be incorporated into a selective breeding program...|$|R

40|$|Current Atlantic {{salmon farming}} {{practice}} induces early smoltification with artificial photoperiod regimes, however {{the importance of}} these photoperiods on parr maturation and interactions with smoltification are poorly understood. These questions were addressed in the present investigation, which examined the effects of photoperiod manipulation on the development, maturation and smoltification of individually tagged parr. Approximately 9000 salmon parr from a high <b>grilsing</b> stock were exposed to continuous light (LL) from first feeding. Three sub-groups of 2400 parr, each sub-group in triplicate tanks, were then exposed to an 8 week “winter photoperiod” (LD 10 : 14) starting on either the 18 th May, the 9 th August or the 20 th September (defined respectively as the May, August and September groups). Following the artificial winter each group was returned to LL. A fourth group of 1600 fish was maintained in replicate tanks on LL throughout. The highest levels of maturation (approx. 20 %) were recorded in the May group. August and September groups showed low levels of maturity (< 5 %) with constant LL throughout resulting in intermediate levels (< 9 %). However, only groups exposed to the August photoperiod showed high levels of smoltification. It is concluded that the photoperiod to which parr are exposed early in their life acts as an important trigger for precocious maturation but does not necessarily phase shift the endogenous rhythm which is thought to control its timing. Smoltification is strongly influenced by the timing of exposure to winter photoperiod with clear evidence indicating that maturation and smoltification are not mutually exclusive processes...|$|R

40|$|Selective {{breeding}} {{practices in}} Atlantic salmon aquaculture {{have been carried}} out intensively since the 1970 s. Along with the phenotypic improvement of fish, we expect to observe genomic regions showing evidence of selection for traits related to growth and age at sexual maturation, as well as traits involved in the domestication process. This is mainly linked to the increase in the frequency of favourable alleles at loci that affect the traits of interest in the breeding population. In this study we searched for signatures of selection in the Cermaq Atlantic salthon broodstock, a Mowi strain, which was derived from wild Norwegian populations, and is now farmed in British Columbia, Canada. A 6. 5 K SNP array was used to genotype 202 fish from the Cermaq population, and the genotypes were compared with four wild populations from Norway. We used three methods based on F-ST values to detect signatures of selection. Forty four markers showing divergence in allele frequency were identified as outliers by the three detection methods, suggesting the presence of signatures of selection in the Cermaq population relative to their wild counterparts. Markers identified as outliers are associated with molecular functions that could be related to the selection for economically important traits (e. g., growth) as well as the domestication process (e. g., response to pathogens and environmental stressors). Of particular interest were three outlier markers that had been previously associated with <b>grilsing</b> (i. e., early sexual maturation) an undesirable trait, which has been heavily selected against in Atlantic salmon aquaculture. This study provides clear evidence of the presence of signatures of selection and domestication in a farmed Atlantic salmon population. NSERC STPGP/ 381479 - 200...|$|R

60|$|Well, crabs, I need hardly {{explain in}} this age of enlightenment, are not fish; but their actions help to throw a side-light on the migratory {{instinct}} in salmon, eels, and so many other true fish which have changed with time their aboriginal habits. The salmon himself, for instance, is by descent a trout, and in the parr stage he is even now almost indistinguishable from many kinds of river-trout that never migrate seaward at all. But at some remote period, the ancestors of the true salmon took to going down to the great deep in search of food, and being large and active fish, found much more to eat in the salt water than ever they had discovered in their native streams. So they settled permanently in their new home, as far as their own lives went at least; though they found the tender young could not stand the brine that did no harm to the tougher constitutions of the elders. No doubt the change was made gradually, a bit at a time, through the brackish water, the species getting further and further seaward down bays and estuaries with successive generations, but always returning to spawn in its native river, as all well-behaved salmon do to the present moment. At last, the habit hardened into an organic instinct, and nowadays the young salmon hatch out like their fathers as parr in fresh water, then go to the sea in the <b>grilse</b> stage and grow enormously, and finally return as full-grown salmon to spawn and breed in their particular birthplace.|$|E
