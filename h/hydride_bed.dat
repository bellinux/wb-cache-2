40|$|The {{design of}} hydride-based {{hydrogen}} storage systems is non-trivial because numerous physical, chemical and engineering principles {{have to be}} considered. In particular, gas and heat transport properties of the <b>hydride</b> <b>bed</b> are crucial for a high-dynamic tank operation. Since most hydrides show low intrinsic heat conductivities, auxiliary materials or structures inside the reaction zone are beneficial. For that purpose, hydride-graphite composites with strong anisotropic thermal conductivities have been developed recently. Here, a comprehensive numerical model to simulate the dynamics of hydrogen storage tanks based on pelletized hydride-graphite composites is presented. Among other common characteristics it includes anisotropic thermal conduction properties, convective heat transport {{as well as local}} shrinkage and swelling effects in the <b>hydride</b> <b>bed.</b> For experimental validation, a room temperature AB 2 -type hydrogen storage alloy was used in form of alloy-graphite pellet s whose specific materials parameters were experimentally obtained and implemented into the computer simulation. In view of the thermodynamic properties of the AB 2 -type alloy, a novel mathematical formalism was developed to describe realistic pressure-composition isotherms. The comparison of experimental and simulation results reveals a good agreement. Thus, the validated model allows predictive studies on tank design and operation scenarios...|$|E

After metal hydride beds {{have reached the}} end of their useful life, the beds will {{replaced}} with new beds and the old beds prepared for disposal. One acceptance criteria for <b>hydride</b> <b>bed</b> waste disposal is that the material inside the bed not be pyrophoric. To determine the pyrophoric nature of spent metal hydride beds, controlled air ingress tests were performed. A simple gas handling manifold fitted with pressure transducers and a calibrated volume were used to introduce controlled quantities of air into a metal <b>hydride</b> <b>bed</b> and the bed temperature rise monitored for reactivity with the air. A desorbed, 4. 4 kg titanium prototype hydride storage vessel (HSV) produced a 4. 4 C internal temperature rise upon the first air exposure cycle and a 0. 1 C temperature rise upon a second air exposure. A total of 346 scc air was consumed by the bed (0. 08 scc per gram Ti). A desorbed, 9. 66 kg LaNi{sub 4. 25 }Al{sub 0. 75 } prototype storage bed experienced larger temperature rises over successive cycles of air ingress and evacuation.

40|$|Applications of {{hydriding}} {{materials for}} solid state hydrogen storage, hydrogen compression, {{thermal energy storage}} and sorption heating and cooling systems have been demonstrated successfully. However, the performance of these devices significantly depends upon heat and mass transfer characteristics of the reactive packed beds. One of the important parameters regulating heat and mass transfer in the <b>hydriding</b> <b>bed</b> is its effective thermal conductivity (ETC), which is dependent on several operating parameters such as pressure and temperature. ETC also varies significantly due to the variation of hydrogen concentration during the hydriding and dehydriding processes. Based on the extensive studies done by the authors on ETC of metal <b>hydride</b> <b>beds,</b> a review of experimental methods, mathematical studies and augmentation techniques is presented in this paper, with emphasis {{on the effects of}} operating parameters on ETC.

40|$|The {{performance}} of metal hydride based solid sorption cooling systems {{depends on the}} driving pressure differential, {{and the rate of}} hydrogen transfer between coupled metal <b>hydride</b> <b>beds</b> during cooling and regeneration processes. Conventionally, the mid-plateau pressure difference obtained from `static' equilibrium PCT data are used for the thermodynamic analysis. It is well known that the processes are `dynamic' because the pressure and temperature, and hence the concentration of the <b>hydride</b> <b>beds,</b> are continuously changing. Keeping this in mind, the pair of La 0. 9 Ce 0. 1 Ni 5 - LaNi 4. 7 Al 0. 3 metal hydrides suitable for solid sorption cooling systems were characterised using both static and dynamic methods. It was found that the PCT characteristics, and the resulting enthalpy (Delta H) and entropy (Delta S) values, were significantly different for static and dynamic modes of measurements. In the present study, the solid sorption metal hydride cooling system is analysed taking in to account the actual variation in the pressure difference (Delta P) and the dynamic enthalpy values. Compared to `static' property based analysis, significant decrease in the driving potentials and transferrable amounts of hydrogen, leading to decrease in cooling capacity by 57. 8 % and coefficient of performance by 31. 9 % are observed when dynamic PCT data at the flow rate of 80 ml/min are considered.

40|$|Although battery {{technology}} is relatively mature, power sources continue to impose serious limitations for small, portable, mobile, or remote applications. A potentially attractive alternative to batteries is chemical fuel-to-electric conversion. Chemical fuels have volumetric energy densities 4 to 10 times those of batteries. However, realizing this advantage requires efficient chemical fuel-to-electric conversion. Direct electrochemical conversion {{would be the}} ideal, but, for most fuels, is generally not within the state-of-the-science. Next best, chemical-to-thermal-to-electric conversion can be attractive if efficiencies can be kept high. This small investigative project was an exploration into the feasibility of a novel hybrid (i. e., thermal-electrochemical) micropower converter of high theoretical performance whose demonstration {{was thought to be}} within near-term reach. The system is comprised of a hydrogen concentration electrochemical cell with physically identical hydrogen electrodes as anode and cathode, with each electrode connected to physically identical <b>hydride</b> <b>beds</b> each containing the same low-enthalpy-of-formation metal hydride. In operation, electrical power is generated by a hydrogen concentration differential across the electrochemical cell. This differential is established via coordinated heating and passive cooling of the corresponding hydride source and sink. Heating is provided by the exothermic combustion (i. e., either flame combustion or catalytic combustion) of a chemical fuel. Upon hydride source depletion, the role of source and sink are reversed, heating and cooling reversed, electrodes commutatively reversed, cell operation reversed, while power delivery continues unchanged. This 'regenerative flip' of source and sink <b>hydride</b> <b>beds</b> can be cycled continuously until all available heating fuel is consumed.

40|$|Prasad, Ajay K. Advani, Suresh G. The overall {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to accelerate the rate at which hydrogen gas can be charged into a hydride-based hydrogen storage tank. During the charging process, the absorption reaction of hydrogen gas into a metal <b>hydride</b> <b>bed</b> is exothermic. The temperature of the system will increase if the heat released is not removed quickly from the system and reduce the absorption rate. Hence, the rate of hydrogen storage into a tank containing metal hydride materials strongly depends on the heat removal rate from the hydrogen storage system. To increase the heat removal rate the following four approaches were explored: (i) Enhancement of the thermal conductivity of the metal <b>hydride</b> <b>bed</b> by incorporating conductivity-enhancing materials such as aluminum (Al) foam. (ii) The use of genetic algorithms to optimize the parameters and placement of spiral coil heat exchangers with fins. (iii) Introduction of an active cooling environment by embedding a helical coil heat exchanger into the hydrogen storage tank. (iv) Use of a physical mixing method to improve the heat removal rate. In order to investigate the effectiveness and the role of various factors in the above proposed approaches, we developed a numerical model that incorporates flow, reaction kinetics and heat transfer within the software package ANSYS. Simulations were used to explore various storage tank designs containing hydride materials and various cooling enhancement methods to find the optimal materials and design for accelerating the charging rate of the hydrogen into the tank. An experimental setup was also designed and fabricated to charge the hydrogen into a hydride-based storage tank.

40|$|A 38 cm (15 inch) long metal <b>hydride</b> <b>bed</b> {{fabricated}} using 11. 4 cm (4. 5 inch) O. D., standard schedule 316 / 316 L {{stainless steel}} pipe was fitted with 22 strain gauges to measure tangential and longitudinal stress resulting from hydride absorption and desorption cycling. Tests were conducted using two different LaNi 4. 25 Al 0. 75 metal hydride fill-levels in the bed. Tests conducted with hydride filled to two-thirds (1. 75 L) of the 2. 63 L total bed volume resulted in a maximum stress less {{than one-third of the}} pipe's ASME Code allowable, for hydride absorption up to a hydrogen-to-metal ratio (H/M) of 0. 86. After 15 absorption/desorption tests and hydride passivation, examination of the bed interior revealed a significant decrease in particle size and increase in hydride height. The second fill level had 0. 4 L of fresh hydride added to the bed's cycled hydride material, and 56 absorption/desorption tests, up to a gas loading of 0. 83 H/M performed. Second fill tests resulted in maximum stresses less than 40 percent of the ASME Code allowable. Post-test bed radiographs showed a further increase in the apparent hydride fill height, and internal component deformation...|$|E
40|$|Recently, {{metal hydride}} {{composites}} (MHC) {{have been proposed}} which consist of a hydride forming metal alloy and a highly heat conduction secondary phase such as expanded natural graphite (ENG) {{in order to improve}} the thermal conductivity of metal <b>hydride</b> powder <b>beds.</b> However, only little data is available in the literature on the effects of extensive cycling on technically relevant properties of MHC. In this paper, hydrogenation characteristics, thermal conductivity and geometrical stability of Hydralloy (R) C 5 -based MHC were thoroughly investigated over 1000 cycles. The obtained results suggest that the MHC under study did not significantly alter their hydrogen uptake characteristics throughout cycling, despite the fact that their thermal conductivity decreased during the first 250 cycles but remained constant thereafter. Although the cylindrical MHC maintained their geometrical stability, radial cracks were detected after cycling. Based on these results, MHC are suitable for high-dynamic applications such as hydrogen storage or thermochemical devices...|$|R
40|$|An {{entirely new}} class of {{light-weight}} reversible hydrides was recently discovered (the Ti-doped alanates) [1]. These NaAIH{sub 4 }-based materials have demonstrated reversible hydrogen storage capacities of up to 5 wt%, nearly 4 times the gravimetrically density of commercial metal hydrides. For this reason, they have been considered a breakthrough for hydrogen storage in fuel cell vehicles. This project {{is the first to}} publish the use of alanates for the generation of electrical power and the first demonstration of a hydride-fueled elevated-temperature PEM Fuel Cell. Because the kinetics of hydrogen uptake and release by the alanate improves with elevated temperatures, novel concepts were tested for the purpose of developing a highly efficient stand-alone power system. A major focus of this work was on the modeling, design, construction and testing of an integrated fuel cell stack and hydrogen storage system that eliminates the need of complicated heat transfer systems and media. After extensive modeling efforts, a proof-of-concept system was built that employs an integrated fuel cell stack and <b>hydride</b> <b>beds</b> that balancing the generation of fuel cell waste heat with the endothermic release of hydrogen from the alanates. Our demonstration unit was capable of greater than one hour of operation on a single charge of hydrogen from the integrated 173 gram alanate bed. In addition, composite hydride materials with synergistic reaction heats were evaluated and tested to enhance the operational performance of the alanates. The composites provide a unique opportunity to utilize the heat produced from hydriding classic metal hydrides to improve both absorption and desorption rates of the alanates. A particular focus of the mixed storage materials work was to balance the thermodynamics and kinetics of the hydrides for start-up conditions. Modeling of the sorption properties proved invaluable in evaluating the optimum composition of hydrides. The modeling efforts were followed by full validation by experimental measurements. This project successfully completed the proof-of-concept goals and generated a powerful set of tools for optimizing the complete power-generation system. It has also created a new direction for hydrogen power generation as well the potential for new R&D based on this work...|$|R
40|$|Answering {{the call}} for the {{eco-friendly}} energy development, the thermally driven metal hydride heat pump (MHHP) {{is one of the}} feasible approaches for its great potential in the recovery of low-grade heat without greenhouse-gas emissions, making it a leading contender among different alternate fuels. The main challenge for the practical application of MHHP is the relatively poor system performance, which is mainly considered due to the low effective thermal conductivity (ETC) of metal <b>hydride</b> reaction <b>bed.</b> Therefore, aiming for improving heat transfer performance, previous researches have proved that inserting high-conductivity sheet such as Metal Hydride (MH) sheet and Aluminum Foam (AF) sheet into the reactor {{is one of the most}} practical methods. However,there is no significant improvement of system performance when enhancing the effective thermal conductivity (E. T. C) of reaction bed. Thus for the purpose of improving the system performance of MHHP, this paper first identifies the relationship between the ETC of metal <b>hydride</b> reaction <b>bed</b> and the system in terms of two performance indicators: COP and cooling power (kW/kg) with a numerical model. Â By adjusting the cycle time, it is shown that when cycle time increasing, the available hydrogen capacity increases, and thus the heat output increases, resulting in a better coefficient of performance. However, once a certain cycle time has been reached it has less effect on the hydrogen capacity. In addition, the heat loss caused by the systemâ€™s heat capacity is proportional to cycle time, and the average flow rate of hydrogen would be decreased when cycle time increasing, allowing COP to reduce. Therefore, there existed an optimal cycle time. As an important factor affecting cycle time, the ETC is related mathematically to find out the optimal value for a better performance of MHHP. The experimental confirmation is conducted eventually, and the comparison of results shows a reasonable agreement with an acceptable error range. To sum up, the optimization of the ETC based on the relationship with the system performance is proposed in this paper, which can help to find the optimal value overall situation toward to a more efficiency system of MHHP...|$|R
