5|$|Extremists will {{probably}} deplore {{the fact that}} the composer is still a respecter of form, still a devotee of beauty, still a believer in the potency of melody; but this is rather a matter for congratulation than regret...

5|$|In 1988, Larry Livermore, {{owner of}} Lookout! Records, saw the band play an early show and signed {{the group to}} his label. In 1989, the band {{recorded}} its debut extended play, 1,000 Hours. Before 1,000 Hours was released, the group dropped the name Sweet Children; according to Livermore, this was done to avoid confusion with another local band Sweet Baby. The band adopted the name Green Day, due to the members' <b>fondness</b> <b>for</b> cannabis.|$|E
5|$|In December 1891, May {{was engaged}} to her second cousin once removed, Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale, the eldest son of the Prince of Wales.

However, Albert Victor died six weeks later, in a recurrence of the worldwide 1889–90 influenza pandemic.|$|E

5|$|Although both Futurama and The Simpsons {{were created}} by Matt Groening, overt {{references}} to the latter are mostly avoided in Futurama. One of the few exceptions to this rule is the appearance of Blinky, a three-eyed orange fish seen on The Simpsons, as Fry is going through the tube. A running gag of the series is Bender's <b>fondness</b> <b>for</b> Olde Fortran malt liquor, named after Olde English 800 malt liquor and the programming language Fortran. The drink was first introduced in this episode and became so {{closely associated with the}} character that he was featured with a bottle in both the Rocket USA wind-up toy and the action figure released by Moore Action Collectibles.|$|E
5|$|Between 1945 and 1950 the US {{fleet of}} battleships had been entirely decommissioned; however, Missouri was spared this fate {{due to the}} {{influence}} of President Harry S. Truman, a native Missourian, who refused to allow the battleship to be decommissioned, and against the advice of Secretary of Defense Louis Johnson, Secretary of the Navy John L. Sullivan, and Chief of Naval Operations Louis E. Denfeld, Truman ordered Missouri to be maintained with the active fleet partly because of his <b>fondness</b> <b>for</b> the battleship and partly because the battleship had been christened by his daughter. As a result, Missouri was involved in various training and flag waving exercises at home and abroad between World War II and the Korean War.|$|E
5|$|Disraeli's {{political}} views embraced certain Radical policies, particularly democratic {{reform of the}} electoral system, and also some Tory ones, including protectionism. He began to move in Tory circles. In 1834 he {{was introduced to the}} former Lord Chancellor, Lord Lyndhurst, by Henrietta Sykes, wife of Sir Francis Sykes. She {{was having an affair with}} Lyndhurst, and began another with Disraeli. Disraeli and Lyndhurst took an immediate liking to each other. Lyndhurst was an indiscreet gossip with a <b>fondness</b> <b>for</b> intrigue; this appealed greatly to Disraeli, who became his secretary and go-between. In 1835 Disraeli stood for the last time as a Radical, unsuccessfully contesting High Wycombe once again.|$|E

50|$|Mazarin sent to {{his father}} in Rome a great sum of money and a casket of jewels, for which {{he always had a}} great <b>fondness,</b> as dowry <b>for</b> his three sisters. Service to the King of France seemed to him the easiest route to a cardinal's hat, his {{constant}} ambition. Richelieu, in spite of his <b>fondness</b> and admiration <b>for</b> Mazarin, was loath to crown his career so early; he offered a bishopric worth 30,000 écus a year. Mazarin, who aspired to more, for his part, turned it aside amiably. In 1636 he returned to Rome, with the thought of attaching himself to Cardinal Antonio Barberini, nephew of the Pope, with an eye to preferment by that route.|$|R

5|$|During {{most of his}} {{own life}} {{conservationism}} wasn't yet on the political agenda, and Tolkien himself did not directly express conservationist views—except in some private letters, in which he tells about his <b>fondness</b> <b>for</b> forests and sadness at tree-felling. In later years, a number of authors of biographies or literary analyses of Tolkien conclude that during his writing of The Lord of the Rings, Tolkien gained increased interest in the value of wild and untamed nature, and in protecting what wild nature was left in the industrialized world.|$|E
5|$|Ferb was {{originally}} {{going to be}} voiced by actor Mitchel Musso. However, when Phineas and Ferb was picked up as a full series, Povenmire and Marsh chose to make Ferb British and cast Thomas Sangster as his voice. However, they enjoyed Musso to a level that they recast him {{as the voice of}} the character Jeremy Johnson; although Musso no longer voices a title character, his new role allows him more lines. Sangster himself is a British actor and was among several cast members hired that hailed from England. Marsh himself had lived in the country for seven years and developed a <b>fondness</b> <b>for</b> the culture and people.|$|E
