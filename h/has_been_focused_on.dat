5|$|As {{a result}} of {{appearing}} in the series mostly in his armor, Arakawa <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> searching ways {{to make it appear}} as Alphonse is expressing emotions despite not having a body. Alphonse has also appeared in materials related to the manga, including video games and light novels that follow his journey. His character has been well received by readers of the series; he has consistently appeared in the top ten series' popularity polls. The character has received positive remarks from critics, with some commending his design and his relationship with Edward.|$|E
5|$|Much of the {{research}} into the properties of neptunium since then <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> understanding how to confine it as a portion of nuclear waste. Because it has isotopes with very long half-lives, it is of particular concern {{in the context of}} designing confinement facilities that can last for thousands of years. It has found some limited uses as a radioactive tracer and a precursor for various nuclear reactions to produce useful plutonium isotopes. However, most of the neptunium that is produced as a reaction byproduct in nuclear power stations {{is considered to be a}} waste product.|$|E

5|$|Juniper Networks {{originally}} {{focused on}} core routers, {{which are used}} by internet service providers (ISPs) to perform IP address lookups and direct internet traffic. Through the acquisition of Unisphere in 2002, the company entered the market for edge routers, which are used by ISPs to route internet traffic to individual consumers. Juniper Networks entered the IT security market with its own JProtect security toolkit in 2003 before acquiring security company NetScreen Technologies the following year. It entered the enterprise segment in the early 2000s, which accounted for one-third of revenues by 2005. As of 2014, Juniper <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> developing new software-defined networking products. However, in 2016, the company encountered some controversy for allegedly putting backdoors into its ScreenOS products.|$|E

This has led to militancy {{on both sides of the}} Durand Line.

25|$|Alcohol is {{the most}} widely used of these drugs, and for that reason, the {{majority}} research on prenatal drug use <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> it. Research shows that prenatal exposure to alcohol can have many negative consequences, and is significantly associated with memory problems, attention problems and decreased cognitive functioning (mental processes involved in memory, perception, thinking etc.) for the offspring later in life. Also, it can lead to the development of alcohol-related problems in later years, such as alcohol dependence.|$|E

25|$|Bioarchaeology in Europe {{is not as}} {{affected}} by these repatriation issues as American bioarchaeology but regardless the ethical considerations associated with working with human remains are, and should, be considered. However, because much of European archaeology <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> classical roots, artifacts and art have been overemphasized and Roman and post-Roman skeletal remains were nearly completely neglected until the 1980s. Prehistoric archaeology in Europe is a different story, as biological remains began to be analyzed earlier than in classical archaeology.|$|E
25|$|More {{recently}} virus research <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> {{understanding the}} genetics and molecular biology of plant virus genomes, {{with a particular}} interest in determining how the virus can replicate, move and infect plants.

In particular, viral-derived sequences have been used to provide an understanding of novel forms of resistance. The recent boom in technology allowing humans to manipulate plant viruses may provide new strategies for production of value-added proteins in plants.|$|E
25|$|Emphasis {{is placed}} upon this group because {{the years between}} the late teens and the mid-twenties are {{believed}} to be a critical period during which young people form adult identities and move toward independence. The effects of youth disconnectionâ€”limited education, social exclusion, lack of work experience, and fewer opportunities to develop mentors and valuable work connectionsâ€”can have long-term consequences that snowball across the life course, eventually influencing everything from earnings and self-sufficiency to physical and mental health and marital prospects. Much discussion <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> how to reach these young people and connect them with broader social institutions in order to prevent these negative consequences.|$|E
