40|$|AbstractBased on <b>fomesafen</b> residue {{toxicity}} in soil, {{the strain}} FB 5, which can utilize <b>fomesafen</b> {{as the sole}} carbon source, was isolated from a fomesafen-contaminated soybean field in Heilongjiang province, China. It was found to degrade 88. 32 % of 500 mg/L <b>fomesafen</b> within 96 h. Conbined with morphological, physiological, biochemical characteristics and 16 S rDNA sequence, the strain was identified as Shigella flexneri. After evaluating the effects of environmental factors such as temperature, <b>fomesafen</b> concentration, and primary pH, the optimum growth conditions of the strain were obtained. A remarkable remediation ability of the strain to fomesafen–polluted soils was demonstrated by a sensitive crop bioassay in pot soil. This will provide a new suitable candidate for <b>fomesafen</b> biodegradation and a workable pathway for solving the hazards of <b>fomesafen</b> residues in agricultural soils...|$|E

40|$|Três experimentos foram realizados para verificar se o local de aplicação de <b>fomesafen,</b> folhas ou solo, afeta a eficácia desse herbicida em biótipos de E. heterophylla resistente e suscetível a ele; e determinar quais estruturas da planta são mais importantes no processo de absorção desse herbicida. Nos dois primeiros experimentos, testaram-se curvas de dose-resposta de <b>fomesafen</b> em biótipos com e sem resistência a inibidores da PROTOX, em pré-emergência (primeiro experimento) e em pós-emergência (segundo experimento). No terceiro experimento, diferentes locais de deposição de <b>fomesafen</b> foram avaliados, por meio do método de vaso duplo, para verificar quais as estruturas das plantas de E. heterophylla mais importantes na absorção do herbicida. Os resultados, em geral, indicam menor eficiência de controle quando o <b>fomesafen</b> é aplicado na parte aérea das plantas de E. heterophylla resistentes a esse herbicida, em comparação às suscetíveis, e que as diferenças entre os biótipos foram menores na aplicação em pré-emergência. Detectou-se maior eficiência do herbicida <b>fomesafen</b> aplicado ao solo quando este foi colocado junto à parte aérea emergente das plantas suscetíveis e resistentes do que junto ao sistema de raízes destas. Esses resultados apóiam a hipótese de que diferenças foliares entre plantas resistentes e suscetíveis podem dificultar a absorção de <b>fomesafen</b> nos biótipos resistentes aos inibidores da PROTOX. Three {{trials were}} carried out to verify if the site of formesafen, {{absorption}} leaves or soil, affects the efficacy of controling this herbicide in wild poinsettia biotypes resistant and susceptible to the product; and to determine which plant structures are more important for <b>fomesafen</b> absorption. In the first two trials, <b>fomesafen</b> dose-response was evaluated on biotypes susceptible and resistant to PROTOX inhibitors, in the pre (first trial) and post emergence (second trial) applications. In a third trial, different deposition sites of <b>fomesafen</b> were evaluated using the double pot system to verify the structures of wild poinsettia plants which were most important to <b>fomesafen</b> absorption. Overall, {{the results indicated that}} shoot absorption of <b>fomesafen</b> was more limited on wild poinsettia biotypes with PROTOX resistance than on susceptible ones and that these differences between biotypes were less important when applied in pre-emergence. When applied to soil, <b>fomesafen</b> efficacy increased when the herbicide was placed near wild poinsettia shoots than close to their roots.

O experimento foi conduzido no município de Rio Verde-GO, no plantio das águas, na safra de 2005 / 2006. O delineamento experimental utilizado foi de blocos ao acaso, em parcelas subdivididas, com três repetições, sendo o fator da parcela principal os tratamentos com herbicidas [fomesafen (225 g ha- 1); <b>fomesafen</b> (225 g ha- 1) + chlorimuron-ethyl (7, 5 g ha- 1); <b>fomesafen</b> (225 g ha- 1) + imazethapyr (50 g ha- 1); <b>fomesafen</b> (225 g ha- 1) + cloransulam-methyl (30, 24 g ha- 1); e testemunha sem herbicida]; e o da subparcela, os cultivares (BRS Grafite, BRS Horizonte, Pérola, BRS Pitanga, BRS Pontal, BRS Requinte, BRS Supremo, BRS Timbó, BRS Valente e BRS Vereda). As parcelas foram mantidas capinadas, para que não houvesse interferência das plantas daninhas. Os tratamentos com herbicidas foram fitotóxicos; todavia, de forma geral, os sintomas mais severos foram verificados no tratamento que continha chlorimuron-ethyl. A associação de <b>fomesafen</b> com chlorimuron-ethyl provocou as maiores reduções na altura das plantas e no acúmulo de massa da parte aérea das plantas secas, além de prolongar o ciclo de maturação de todos os cultivares. A aplicação isolada de <b>fomesafen</b> reduziu a produtividade de grãos dos cultivares BRS Timbó e BRS Vereda. Quando se adicionou o imazethapyr ao <b>fomesafen,</b> observou-se redução na produtividade dos cultivares BRS Supremo, BRS Timbó e BRS Vereda. A adição de cloransulam-methyl, além de reduzir a produtividade desses três cultivares, também diminuiu a produtividade do cultivar BRS Requinte. Os cultivares Pérola, BRS Pitanga, BRS Pontal e BRS Valente não tiveram suas produtividades reduzidas pela mistura chlorimuron-ethyl + <b>fomesafen.</b> O imazethapyr mostrou potencial para ser utilizado na cultura do feijão. This study {{aimed to}} evaluate the selectivity of the herbicides chlorimuron-ethyl, imazethapyr and cloransulam-methyl when applied in association with <b>fomesafen</b> on ten common bean cultivars. The experiment {{was carried out in}} Rio Verde-Goias during the growing season of 2005 / 2006, in a completely randomized block design, with three replicates, in split-plots. The herbicide treatments [fomesafen (225 g ha- 1), <b>fomesafen</b> (225 g ha- 1) + chlorimuron-ethyl (7. 5 g ha- 1), <b>fomesafen</b> (225 g ha- 1) + imazethapyr (50 g ha- 1), <b>fomesafen</b> (225 g ha- 1) + cloransulam-methyl (30. 24 g ha- 1), and control without herbicide] were tested in the plots and the cultivars (BRS Grafite, BRS Horizonte, Pérola, BRS Pitanga, BRS Pontal, BRS Requinte, BRS Supremo, BRS Timbó, BRS Valente and BRS Vereda), in the split-plots. The plots were kept hoed to avoid weed interference. All treatments caused phytotoxicity to the cultivars, but the treatment with chlorimuron-ethyl showed more severe symptoms. This same treatment also resulted in greater reduction of plant height, shoot dry matter and an extended maturation cycle. The sole application of <b>fomesafen</b> caused a decrease in grain productivity of BRS Timbó, and BRS Vereda. When <b>fomesafen</b> was applied in a mixture with imazethapyr, a decrease in grain productivity was observed for the cultivars BRS Timbó, BRS Vereda, and BRS Supremo. Cloransulam-methyl addition led to a productivity reduction of these three cultivars and BRS Requinte, as well. The productivity of Pérola, BRS Pitanga, BRS Pontal, and BRS Valente cultivars was not affected by the application of chlorimuron-ethyl + <b>fomesafen.</b> Imazethapyr presented potential to be used in common bean crop...|$|E

A positive effect of treatments on phytoplankton taxonomic diversity also was observed, indicating that, like natural disturbances of intermediate strength, xenobiotics sometimes may enhance the diversity of algal communities. <b>Fomesafen</b> alone did not have any clear effect on zooplankton. Abundance of calanoid copepods was reduced significantly in the mixture-treated ponds, suggesting either a direct effect of the adjuvant and/or an enhancement of herbicide toxicity by Agral 90. The abundance of other zooplanktonic herbivorous groups increased due to a reduced competition for food for herbivorous species and a higher availability of preys for predators.

The following herbicides: <b>fomesafen</b> (250 g/ha), lactofen (192 g/ha), fluazifop-p-butyl (187 g/ha) e haloxyfopmethyl (240 g/ha) and <b>fomesafen</b> + fluazifop-p-butyl (250 g/ha + 187 g/ha) (factor B) were assigned at random within each plot. Composite the soil samples were taken on the subplots at random at three different periods to study the persistence of the herbicides. The effects of the herbicides upon the weeds were evaluated in the 10 th and 20 th day after the treatment (DAT); the soil persistence at 0, 28 and 56 DAT; the stand and grain yield at harvest. Seed inoculation did not affect the weed control. On the 20 th day, grasses were fully controlled (100 %) by fluazifop-p-butyl and haloxyfop-methyl. <b>Fomesafen</b> and lactofen were efficient to control Alternanthera ficoidea and regular to Sida spp. The mixture <b>fomesafen</b> + fluazifop-p-butyl did not present any advantage on the control of A. ficoidea, Sida spp., Cenchrus echinatus and Eleusine indica. Fluazifop-p-butyl and haloxyfop-methyl, at 28 DAT, did not cause phytotoxicity to the test-plant, showing a soil persistence lesser than 28 days. In the non-inoculated treatment, <b>fomesafen</b> and lactofen still persisted at 28 days. None of the herbicides used persisted for period over 56 days...|$|E

The design utilized was a randomized complete block, organized in a split-plot arrangement, with four replications. For that, 24 herbicides were evaluated with <b>fomesafen</b> (0. 45 and 0. 625 kg ha- 1), prometryn (1. 25 kg ha- 1), diuron (1. 25 kg ha- 1), trifluralin (1. 8 kg ha- 1), and S-metolachlor (0. 77 kg ha- 1), applied as preemergent, with or without S-metolachlor (0. 77 kg ha- 1) applied in early postemergence. The variables evaluated were: phytotoxicity, insertion height of the first reproductive branch, plant height, stand, number of reproductive branches per plant, number of bolls per plant, bolls weight, and productivity of cotton seed. <b>Fomesafen</b> alone or in a tank mixture with preemergent prometryn, diuron, trifluralin and S-metolachlor was selective to cotton plant. Preemergent <b>fomesafen</b> isolated application followed by the application of S-metolachlor in early postemergence was also selective. However, on average, preemergent tank mixtures applied in association with preemergent S-metolachlor early application was not selective to cotton crop...|$|E

The objective of this study was to evaluate the sensitivity of cassava plants to herbicides with different mechanisms of action, as well as the damage caused by the application of herbicides on the photosynthetic apparatus of these plants. An experiment was conducted in a randomized block design with four replications. The treatments were constituted of the application of the following post- emergence herbicides in cassava: bentazon, clomazone, <b>fomesafen,</b> fluazifop-p-buthyl, glyphosate, nicosulfuron, chlorimuron, fluazifop-p-buthyl + <b>fomesafen,</b> sulfentrazone, besides a control without application. The visual intoxication and chlorophyll a fluorescence assessments were performed at 2, 9, 16 and 23 days after herbicide application. The herbicides evaluated affected differently the cassava plants. Sulfentrazone and glyphosate promoted plant death. Herbicides clomazone, <b>fomesafen,</b> fluazifop-p-buthyl and chlorimuron-ehtyl caused low toxicity to cassava plants and did not affect the ratio Fv / Fm and ETR.

However at Harrow, the addition of dimethoate to quizalofop-p-ethyl increased injury (0 % vs 4. 9 %) in 2007 and the addition cyhalothrin-lambda or dimethoate to sethoxydim increased injury in 2008 in dry bean. The addition of cyhalothrin-lambda to quizalofop-p-ethyl also increased injury (0 % vs 4. 5 %) in 2008. There was no adverse effect on dry bean injury with other treatments at Harrow in 2007 or 2008.

Twenty-four microcosms were used and treatments were performed with substances alone or with herbicide–adjuvant binary mixtures, at two concentrations levels (44. 4 and 222. 2 μg/L for the herbicides, and 100 and 500 μg/L for Agral 90). Toxicity was assessed weekly for 1 month through growth measurements, as inferred from the relative frond number (RFN) and relative frond area (RFA). Concentrations of diquat and <b>fomesafen</b> in water and sediments were measured weekly. The herbicides showed very different behaviour in microcosms, with a rapid disappearance of diquat from the aqueous phase whereas <b>fomesafen</b> levels remained almost constant over time. Diquat strongly inhibited the growth of L. minor whereas <b>fomesafen</b> {{had no effect on}} plant growth. Presence of the adjuvant only slightly reduced the effect of the lowest concentration of diquat, probably as a result of dispersion of the herbicide at the water surface.

O objetivo deste estudo foi {{investigar}} a eficácia de doses de <b>fomesafen</b> aplicado via água de irrigação por aspersão no controle de Euphorbia heterophylla. Os tratamentos foram dispostos no esquema fatorial (4 x 3 x 2) + 3, sendo quatro doses do <b>fomesafen</b> (60, 120, 180 e 240 g ha- 1), três estádios de desenvolvimento de E. heterophylla (1, 7 e 14 dias após a emergência - DAE), dois métodos de aplicação (pulverização e herbigação) e testemunhas sem herbicida (uma para cada estádio de desenvolvimento da planta daninha). Foi empregado o delineamento inteiramente casualizado, com quatro repetições. Cada unidade experimental constou de um vaso com 4, 0 L de solo, onde foram distribuídas 50 sementes dessa planta daninha. A pulverização foi feita com 200 L ha- 1 de calda; na herbigação foi usada lâmina de água de 4, 72 mm, aplicada por simulador de irrigação. E. heterophylla foi mais suscetível ao <b>fomesafen</b> com 1 DAE. Neste estádio, a herbigação controlou-a melhor que a pulverização nas doses de 180 e 240 g ha- 1. Na aplicação aos 7 DAE, geralmente a pulverização foi mais eficaz que a herbigação, mas o controle da planta daninha não foi satisfatório. Aplicado com 14 DAE, o herbicida, independentemente da dose e do método de aplicação, proporcionou controle pobre ou nenhum. Herbicide application via {{irrigation water}} (herbigation) has been increasingly used in Brazil, mainly through center pivot. The {{aim of this}} study was to investigate the efficacy of <b>fomesafen</b> rates applied via overhead sprinkler irrigation for the control of Euphorbia heterophylla. A (4 x 3 x 2) + 3 factorial experiment was used consisting of: <b>fomesafen</b> rates (60, 120, 180, and 240 g ha- 1), weed development stages (1, 7, and 14 days after emergence - DAE), application methods (spray and herbigation) and checks that did not receive the herbicide (one for each weed development stage). A completely randomized design with four replications was used. The experimental unit was a pot with four liters of soil, where 50 seeds of the weed were sown. The spray consisted of 200 liters ha- 1; for herbigation, a volume of 4. 72 mm of water was applied with an irrigation simulator. The most susceptible stage of E. heterophylla was at 1 DAE, when herbigation was more efficient than spraying at the rates of 180 and 240 g ha- 1. At 7 DAE, spraying was generally more efficient than herbigation, but the level of weed control was inadequate. <b>Fomesafen</b> was not efficient when applied at 14 DAE, regardless of the rate and the application method...|$|E

Os experimentos foram desenvolvidos no período {{de janeiro}} a maio de 2006, em vasos, mantidos em condições de ambiente não controlado, no Departamento de Fitossanidade, UNESP, Campus de Jaboticabal (SP). Os tratamentos avaliados foram: glyphosate (1, 20 kg ha- 1 e. a.), chlorimuron-ethyl (0, 02 kg ha- 1), lactofen (0, 18 kg ha- 1), <b>fomesafen</b> (0, 25 kg ha- 1), flumioxazin (0, 025 kg ha- 1), imazethapyr (0, 10 kg ha- 1), chlorimuron-ethyl (0, 01 kg ha- 1) mais lactofen (0, 096 kg ha- 1), chlorimuron-ethyl (0, 01 kg ha- 1) mais <b>fomesafen</b> (0, 125 kg ha- 1), lactofen (0, 096 kg ha- 1) mais <b>fomesafen</b> (0, 125 kg ha- 1), as misturas de glyphosate (0, 60 kgha- 1) com chlorimuron-ethyl (0, 01 kg ha- 1), lactofen (0, 096 kg ha- 1), <b>fomesafen</b> (0, 125 kg ha- 1), flumioxazin (0, 0125 kg ha- 1), imazethapyr (0, 05 kg ha- 1) e uma testemunha sem aplicação de herbicida. No experimento com C. benghalensis, testou-se também a aplicação seqüencial de glyphosate (0, 96 mais 0, 72 kg ha- 1 e. a.). A associação de ghyphosate a herbicidas utilizados em soja convencional ocasionou danos visuais às plantas de soja. Em alguns casos, como nas misturas de glyphosate com lactofen e glyphosate com flumioxazin, os sintomas foram severos, com necroses e pontos cloróticos nas folhas. Mesmo assim, essa fitointoxicação não influenciou no desenvolvimento vegetativo e reprodutivo da soja. A mistura de glyphosate a outros herbicidas, assim como a sua aplicação seqüencial, não foram eficazes no controle de C. benghalensis, nas doses testadas e quando as plantas estavam no estádio de 4 a 6 folhas totalmente expandidas. The {{objective of this}} study was to evaluate phytotoxicity effects of herbicides applied during post-emergence, either alone or in mixture with other chemicals in transgenic glyphosate-tolerant soybean (cv. M-SOY 8008 RR) and in Commelina benghalensis. Two experiments were carried out from January to May 2006, in pots, under uncontrolled conditions, at Plant Protection Department of UNESP, Jaboticabal (SP), Brazil. The following herbicides were used: glyphosate (1, 20 kg a. e. ha- 1), chlorimuron-ethyl (0, 02 kg ha- 1), lactofen (0, 018 kg ha- 1), <b>fomesafen</b> (0, 25 kg ha- 1), flumioxazin (0, 025 kg ha- 1), imazethapyr (0, 10 kg ha- 1), chlorimuron-ethyl (0, 01 kg ha- 1) plus lactofen (0, 096 kg ha- 1), chlorimuron-ethyl (0, 01 kg ha- 1) plus <b>fomesafen</b> (0, 125 kg ha- 1) and lactofen (0, 096 kg ha- 1) plus <b>fomesafen</b> (0, 125 kg ha- 1). It was also used the glyphosate (0, 60 kg a. e. ha- 1) in mixture with chlorimuron-ethyl (0, 01 kg ha- 1), lactofen (0, 096 kg ha- 1), <b>fomesafen</b> (0, 125 kg ha- 1), flumioxazin (0, 0125 kg ha- 1) and imazethapyr (0, 05 kg ha- 1) and a no treated control. Also the sequential application of glyphosate (0, 96 plus 0, 72 kg a. e. ha- 1) was used in the experiment with C. benghalensis. The association of glyphosate and conventional soybean herbicides caused soybean injury. In some cases, such as in the glyphosate-lactofen and glyphosate-flumioxazin mixtures, the symptoms were severe, with necrosis and clorosis. Although there were phytotoxic symptoms in the plant, the herbicide did not affect vegetative and reproductive soybean development.
