Methane (CH 4), propane (C 3 H 8) and acetylene (C 2 H 2) {{were used as}} the carbon source. Distinctive carbon nanostructures were produced depending on the fuel type and fuel flow rate. The quantitative analysis of many transmission electron microscope (TEM) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) images was performed. The nanotubes synthesized by <b>acetylene</b> <b>flames</b> were of different types that included helically coiled nanotubes depending on the fuel flow rate. Methane produced thin multi wall carbon nanotubes as well as nanorods and nanofibers within the fuel flow rate range of 7. 18 E- 07 m 3 /s to 9. 57 E- 07 m 3 /s. Propane yielded nanotubes only at the fuel flow rate of 4. 20 E- 07 m 3 /s. ^ A flame synthesis technique of coiled carbon nanotubes using <b>acetylene</b> jet <b>flames</b> and galvanized steel catalyst is presented.

Laser-induced fluorescence spectra from glyoxal vapor using the same excitation wavelength of 428 nm showed the same strongest lines as the signal from the flame. Glyoxal was visualized in two different modes; two-dimensional imaging and a spatial-spectral mode where spectra were obtained at different spatial positions in the flame simultaneously. For the premixed laminar rich flame it is shown that glyoxal is produced early in the flame, before the signals for C 2 and CH appear. For the turbulent non-premixed flames it is shown that glyoxal is produced in a layer on the fuel rich side of the flames. Here the fuel is premixed with ambient air. This layer is thin and has a high spatial resolution. The general trend was that the glyoxal signal appeared in regions with a lower temperature compared with the emission from C 2 and CH. The imaging of glyoxal in turbulent <b>acetylene</b> <b>flames</b> is a promising tool for achieving new insight into flame phenomena, as it gives very good structural information on the flame front.

40|$|While the {{formation}} and growth of soot particles has received much attention, the subsequent destruction of the particles is less well understood. Soot particles are destroyed though two parallel processes: oxidation and fragmentation. Oxidation is the removal of mass from particles due to chemical reactions with molecular oxygen and hydroxyl radicals. Fragmentation is the break-up of large aggregates into smaller aggregates. Here, a new model for fragmentation inspired by previous experimental investigations is proposed and formulated within the Hybrid Method of Moments (HMOM). With the formulation, the rate of particle loss due to oxidation is closed, resolving a long-standing problem with the Method of Moments. Less important, secondary unclosed terms are introduced, and models for these terms are proposed. The oxidation and fragmentation models are validated using a set of laminar premixed methane flames and then applied {{to a series of}} laminar counterflow diffusion <b>acetylene</b> <b>flames.</b> The role of fragmentation is distinctly different in the two flame types.
