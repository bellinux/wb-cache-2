5000|$|Lumped <b>damage</b> <b>mechanics</b> or LDM is {{a branch}} of {{structural}} mechanics that {{is concerned with the}} analysis of frame structures. It is based on continuum <b>damage</b> <b>mechanics</b> and fracture mechanics. It combines the ideas of these theories with the concept of plastic hinge LDM can be defined as the fracture mechanics of complex structural systems. In the models of LDM, cracking or local buckling as well as plasticity are lumped at the inelastic hinges. As in continuum <b>damage</b> <b>mechanics,</b> LDM uses state variables to represent the effects of damage on the remaining stiffness and strength of the frame structure. In reinforced concrete structures, the damage state variable quantifies the crack density in the plastic hinge zone; in unreinforced concrete components and steel beams, it is a dimensionless measure of the crack surface; in tubular steel elements, the damage variable measures the degree of local buckling The LDM evolution laws can be derived from continuum <b>damage</b> <b>mechanics</b> or fracture mechanics. In the latter case, concepts such as the energy release rate or the stress intensity factor of a plastic hinge are introduced. LDM allows for the numerical simulation of the collapse of complex structures with a fraction of the computational cost and human effort of its continuum mechanics counterparts. LDM is also a regularization procedure that eliminates the mesh-dependence phenomenon that is observed in structural analysis with local damage models ...|$|E

5000|$|<b>Damage</b> <b>mechanics</b> is {{concerned}} with the representation, or modeling, of damage of materials that is suitable for making engineering predictions about the initiation, propagation, and fracture of materials without resorting to a microscopic description that would be too complex for practical engineering analysis. <b>Damage</b> <b>mechanics</b> illustrates the typical engineering approach to model complex phenomena. To quote Dusan Krajcinovic, [...] "It is often argued that the ultimate task of engineering research is to provide not so much a better insight into the examined phenomenon but to supply a rational predictive tool applicable in design". <b>Damage</b> <b>mechanics</b> is a topic of applied mechanics that relies heavily on continuum mechanics. Most of the work on <b>damage</b> <b>mechanics</b> uses state variables to represent the effects of [...] on the stiffness and remaining life of the material that is damaging as a result of thermomechanical load and ing. The state variables may be measurable, e.g., crack density, or inferred from the effect they have on some macroscopic property, such as stiffness, coefficient of thermal expansion, remaining life, etc. The state variables have [...] thermodynamic forces that motivate further damage. Initially the material is pristine, or intact. A damage activation criterion is needed to predict damage initiation. Damage evolution does not progresses spontaneously after initiation, thus requiring a damage evolution model. In plasticity like formulations, the damage evolution is controlled by a hardening function but this requires additional phenomenological parameters that must be found through experimentation, which is expensive, time consuming, and virtually no one does. On the other hand, micromechanics of damage formulations are able to predict both damage initiation and evolution without additional material properties.|$|E

50|$|Microscopic {{material}} {{failure is}} {{defined in terms of}} crack propagation and initiation. Such methodologies are useful for gaining insight in the cracking of specimens and simple structures under well defined global load distributions. Microscopic failure considers the initiation and propagation of a crack. Failure criteria in this case are related to microscopic fracture. Some of the most popular failure models in this area are the micromechanical failure models, which combine the advantages of continuum mechanics and classical fracture mechanics. Such models are based on the concept that during plastic deformation, microvoids nucleate and grow until a local plastic neck or fracture of the intervoid matrix occurs, which causes the coalescence of neighbouring voids. Such a model, proposed by Gurson and extended by Tvergaard and Needleman, is known as GTN. Another approach, proposed by Rousselier, is based on continuum <b>damage</b> <b>mechanics</b> (CDM) and thermodynamics.

5000|$|The base rules {{revolve around}} ships {{with just a}} few key attributes: drive {{indicates}} the speed of the craft, damage reduction its armor, and defensive value its difficulty to hit, based on size, speed, and energy shielding. Most attacks are made with a single roll of three dice. The size of two of the dice is determined by the type of weapons. For example, the more accurate laser and ion weapons receive d8s, whereas clumsier (but potentially deadlier) blaster and plasma weapons receive d6s. The third die is determined by a crewman's gunnery skill, and can vary between a d4 and a d10. If the sum of the dice, after a few modifications, is {{greater than or equal to}} the defender's defensive value, the shot is a hit, with the damage also being shown on the same dice. A Splattergun, for instance, does [...] "medium" [...] damage, and so the middle of the three dice values would be the amount of damage delivered, after subtracting the defender's damage reduction. Different <b>damage</b> <b>mechanics</b> apply for ships equipped with (slow-moving) torpedoes or (fast-moving) missiles. The damage taken is marked off on a ship's damage track, which will show special damage taken at certain levels, including losing weapons, armor, and drive, or taking a special critical hit. These simple attack rules make for much more fast-paced combat than most of ICE's games.|$|E

On account of these diffused damages, a synergistic <b>damage</b> <b>mechanic</b> model was proposed for the stiffness properties. The model included the microcosmic responses of the physical damage and macroscopic performance of the material's stiffness. In micro-level, mesoscopic RVE(representative volume element) model was established to obtain crack opening displacement and crack sliding displacement, which were used to define the damage tensor. In macro- level, through homogenizing the material strain and the surface displacement of the damage, {{the relationship of the}} stiffness matrix of unidirectional laminate or laminates in damage statue and damage tense was set up. Due to restriction of NDT (non- destructive testing) technology development, only the constitutive relations of matrix cracks were constructed.

40|$|The {{study of}} {{defected}} axisymmetric structures is among important industrial applications. Detection of such defects, and or {{the evaluation of}} intrinsic parameter leads to a better design of those mechanical parts. The {{first part of the}} conducting research concerns the evaluation of the stress intensity factors (SIF) in axisymmetric elastic structures with internal or circumferential edge crack using the dual boundary element method (DBEM). Its application to axisymmetric problems requires a stress (hypersingular) boundary integral equation together with the displacement (standard) boundary integral equation, one applied to each side of the crack. This process requires a great algebraic handling due to the complexity of the axisymmetric kernels. Crack surfaces are discretized with discontinuous quadratic boundary elements to satisfy the existence of the finite-part integrals and the continuity of the unit outward normal at corners. SIF evaluation is done using displacements extrapolation at the crack tip. Examples of axisymmetric geometries are analyzed and obtained results are compared to others researchers. <b>Damage</b> and Fracture <b>Mechanics</b> <b>Damage</b> and Fracture <b>Mechanics</b> Look Inside Other actions Export citation About this Book Reprints and Permissions Add to Papers Share Share this content on Facebook Share this content on Twitter Share this content on LinkedI...|$|R

The results from the initial panels show the degradation of the effective stiffness with loading time. These results also show that the evolution of the effective stiffness, for these test conditions, is slower than commonly assumed. This evolution appears to be a function of the loading conditions, and level of pre-existing damage, at a particular time-step. A statistical determination of the evolution of the damage parameter for a ceramic material requires firstly, the development of a repeatable time varying load pattern. Secondly, the pattern should resemble the essential characteristics of relevant earthquake loading on realistic masonry buildings, preferably from earthquakes recorded in both interplate and intraplate regions. Finally, the pattern should pass the criteria of similarity to existing patterns, whilst providing sufficient statistical information to allow the encapsulation of the internal Damage Variable.
