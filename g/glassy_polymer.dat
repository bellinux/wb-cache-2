50|$|Like other biomaterials, resilin is a hydrogel, {{meaning it}} is swollen with water. The water content of resilin at neutral pH is 50-60%, {{and the absence}} of this water will make a big {{difference}} on the material’s property: while the hydrated resilin behaves like a rubber, the dehydrated resilin has the properties of a <b>glassy</b> <b>polymer.</b> However, dehydrated resilin is able to return to its rubbery state if water is available.  Water serves as a plasticizer in resilin network by increasing the amount of hydrogen bonds. The high concentration of proline and glycine, polyproline helices, and hydrophilic portions all serves to increase water content in resilin protein network. The increase in hydrogen bonds lead to an increase in chain mobility, thus decreases glass transition temperature. The more water content is in resilin network, the less stiff and more resilience the materials is. Dehydrated resilin behaves as a glass polymer with low stiffness, strain, and resilience, but a relatively high compressible modulus and glass transition temperature.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{possible}} for a phase transition from polymer to glassy state to take place. Polymer glass transitions have many determinants including relaxation time, viscosity and cage size. At low temperatures the dynamics become very slow (sluggish) and relaxation time increases from picoseconds to seconds, minutes, or more. At high temperatures, the correlation function has a [...] regime for very short times (when particles do not interact) and a microscopic regime. In the microscopic regime, the correlation functions decay exponentially at high temperatures. At low temperatures the correlation functions have an intermediate regime in which particles have both slow and fast relaxations. The slow relaxation {{is an indication of}} cages in the glassy system. In glassy state density is not homogeneous i.e. particles are localized in different density distributions in space. It means that density fluctuations are present in the system. Particle dynamics become very slow because temperature is directly proportional to kinetic energy causing the particles trapped in local regions by each other. Particles are doing rattling motion inside these cages and cooperate with each other. These regions in the <b>glassy</b> <b>polymer</b> are called cages. In the intermediate regime each particle has its own and different relaxation time.|$|E
5000|$|Professor Donald's deeply {{innovative}} and productive research is in experimental soft condensed matter physics, incorporating polymer and colloidal physics, {{and more recently}} biological physics. Her early Cornell work on <b>glassy</b> <b>polymer</b> crazing remains very influential and was followed by insightful studies of shear deformation in liquid crystal polymers (LCPs).Here {{she was able to}} demonstrate the ubiquity of the so-called banded texture after shear of LCP's and study the underlying packing of the molecules by electron microscopy showing how they followed a serpentine trajectory in several thermotropics. She also carried out important work on lyotropic systems, including a synthetic polypeptide, studying its gelation and phase diagram.Donald's mid-career launch into biological physics followed naturally from this polymer work leading to the physics of food and thence to starch. The starch granule structure and its changes during different processing histories were brilliantly analysed using a novel X-ray scattering technique. Structural changes during cooking, with the amylopectin molecule imaginatively treated as a side chain liquid crystalline polymer, brought understanding to different processing treatments. The misfolding of proteins forming amyloid fibrils is well recognized in the aetiology of many diseases, particularly those of old age. Donald's recent work has demonstrated that this important and challenging problem can be powerfully addressed by the approaches of polymer science and furthermore suggests an intriguing connection between the structures observed in both fields.Donald's impressive achievements in biological physics are strongly based on the imaginative use environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM), neutron and X-ray scattering, optical microscopy and infrared spectroscopy. With ESEM in particular her success is supported by her many earlier pioneering investigations of its basic physics. To maintain this vital interchange between soft matter physics and biology, Donald has founded a well resourced Biology and Soft Systems (BSS) Group at the Cavendish.|$|E

A clear correlation between the measured work of adhesion and the chemical nature of the Al surface, specifically the hydroxyl coverage and the iso-electric point is found. The magnitude of the work of adhesion points to important contributions from plastic deformation in the <b>glassy</b> <b>polymer</b> for some cases. Delamination is shown to be accompanied by the formation of microscopic shear bands at such interfaces. The non-monotonous stress-strain behaviour of the <b>glassy</b> <b>polymer</b> that gives rise to the shear bands is also shown to lead to peculiar pinning events at the crack front. Evidence indicates that the occurrence of protrusions in the crack front deriving for example from the presence of stress concentrators and crack initiation sites ahead of the front, combined with mode and rate dependence of the local energy release rate along the front may pin the front at positions adjacent to a protrusion.

The major effect of the plasticization by small molecules is on {{the reduction of the}} glass transition temperature. The present study suggests that the dependence of diffusion coefficients of small molecules on the penetrant concentration can be affected by the reduction of the glass transition of the penetrant/polymer system caused by a plasticization effect of the penetrant. With a WLF type shift factor, the concentration-dependent diffusion coefficient can be predicted. It is found that the calculated diffusion coefficient correlates very well to the experimental data.
