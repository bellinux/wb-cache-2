25|$|The burrows of a {{southern}} hairy-nosed wombat can have air temperatures around of 14°C in midwinter to 26°C in midsummer, the wombat's preferred thermo-neutral zone, while the ambient temperatures outside range <b>from</b> <b>down</b> to around 2°C in Winter and up to 36°C or above during Summer. Warrens can make surface conditions in habitats of low humidity and high temperatures better for the wombat. A wombat retires deep in the burrow after foraging. The next night, the wombat moves to the entrance to check if conditions are right before emerging again. In the evening, wombats leave their burrows as the ambient temperature and burrow temperature are the same. In the early morning, when the surface temperature is lower, they retire.|$|E
25|$|Nadal won the 2013 French Open {{after beating}} Djokovic in the {{semifinal}} and Ferrer in the final, breaking {{the record for}} the most match wins in the tournament in the process with his 59th match victory. His match with Djokovic was widely considered one of the greatest clay court matches ever played, as Nadal came back <b>from</b> <b>down</b> a break in the fifth set to take out a hard-fought 4-hour, 37-minute victory. However, because of the nuances of how rankings are calculated (including an improvement in performance by the then world No. 5 David Ferrer at the French Open), Nadal's world ranking dropped from No. 4 to No. 5, with Ferrer replacing him at No. 4.|$|E
