5|$|Abelisaurid hindlimbs {{were more}} typical of ceratosaurs, with the astragalus and {{calcaneum}} (upper ankle bones) fused {{to each other and}} to the tibia, forming a tibiotarsus. The tibia was shorter than the femur, giving the hindlimb stocky proportions. There were three functional digits on the foot (the second, third, and fourth), while the first digit, or <b>hallux,</b> did not contact the ground.|$|E
5|$|Daspletosaurus {{shared the}} same body form as other tyrannosaurids, with a short, S-shaped neck {{supporting}} the massive skull. It walked on its two thick hindlimbs, which ended in four-toed feet, although the first digit (the <b>hallux)</b> did not contact the ground. In contrast, the forelimbs were extremely small and bore only two digits, although Daspletosaurus had the longest forelimbs in proportion to body size of any tyrannosaurid. A long, heavy tail served as a counterweight to the head and torso, with {{the center of gravity}} over the hips.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Mayr and Peters {{described}} {{the anatomy of}} a very well preserved specimen of Archaeopteryx, and determined that its anatomy was more like non-avian theropods than previously understood. Specifically, they found that Archaeopteryx had a primitive palatine, unreversed <b>hallux,</b> and hyper-extendable second toe. Their phylogenetic analysis produced the controversial result that Confuciusornis was closer to Microraptor than to Archaeopteryx, making the Avialae a paraphyletic taxon. They also suggested that the ancestral paravian was able to fly or glide, and that the dromaeosaurids and troodontids were secondarily flightless (or had {{lost the ability to}} glide). Corfe and Butler criticized this work on methodological grounds.|$|E

2500|$|Most {{birds have}} at least one opposable digit on the foot, in various configurations, but these are seldom called [...] "thumbs". They are more often known simply as <b>halluxes.</b>|$|R
50|$|As {{with other}} members of the genus Callithrix, the common {{marmosets}} have claw-like nails known as tegulaes on most of their fingers. Only their <b>halluxes</b> (big toes) have the flat nails or ungulaes that most other primates have. Marmosets have an arboreal locomotion similar to squirrels. They can hang on to trees vertically and leap between them, as well as run across branches quadrupedally. Tegulaes are an adaptation of this type of locomotion. Other Callithrix traits shared include enlarged, chisel-shaped incisors and specialized cecums for their diet.|$|R
5|$|Additional traits {{shared with}} other {{prosimian}} primates (strepsirrhine primates and tarsiers) include a bicornuate (two-horned) uterus and epitheliochorial placentation. Because their thumbs are only pseudo-opposable, making their movement less {{independent of the}} other fingers, their hands are less than perfect at grasping and manipulating objects. On their feet, they have a widely abducted <b>hallux</b> (first toe) which facilitates the grasping of tree limbs. A common misconception is that lemurs have a prehensile tail, a trait found only in New World monkeys, particularly atelids, among primates. Lemurs also rely heavily on their sense of smell, a trait shared with most other mammals and early primates, {{but not with the}} visually oriented higher primates. This sense of smell is important in terms of marking territory as well as provide an indication of whether or not another lemur is a viable breeding partner.|$|E
5|$|Hindfoot {{length is}} 37mm (1.5in). The upper {{sides of the}} feet are covered with grayish white fur, which extends around the claws to form ungual tufts. On the hindfeet, the fifth digit is {{relatively}} short at 6mm (0.2in); the <b>hallux</b> (first digit) is 8mm (0.3in) long, and the other digits 11 to 12mm (0.4 to 0.5in). The tail is 238mm (9.4in) long and naked in part. At the base, it is dark brown both above and below, but slightly lighter below. The upper side remains dark brown for much of its length, though the color does become lighter towards the tip. The lower side becomes mottled at about 55mm (2.2in) from the tip and then whitish at about 65mm (2.6in). It has a well-developed tuft at its tail tip, consisting of whitish and occasional light brown hairs. This tuft commences at about 130mm (5.1in) from the base with fairly short hairs and becomes more pronounced at 180mm (7.1in). In contrast, the greater big-footed mouse has a weaker, dark brown tuft.|$|E
5|$|Slow lorises have a {{powerful}} grasp with both their hands and feet due to several specializations. They can tightly grasp branches with little effort because of a special muscular arrangement in their hands and feet, where the thumb diverges at nearly 180Â° {{from the rest of}} the fingers, while the <b>hallux</b> (big toe) ranges between being perpendicular and pointing slightly backwards. The toes have a large flexor muscle that originates on the lower end of the thigh bone, which helps to impart a strong grasping ability to the hind limbs. The second digit of the hand is short compared to the other digits, while on the foot, the fourth toe is the longest. The sturdy thumb helps to act like a clamp when digits three, four, and five grasp the opposite side of a tree branch. This gives their hands and feet a pincer-like appearance. The strong grip can be held for hours without losing sensation due to the presence of a rete mirabile (network of capillaries), a trait shared among all lorises. Both slender and slow lorises have relatively short feet. Like nearly all lemuriforms, they have a grooming claw on the second toe of each foot.|$|E
25|$|With the forelimbs being {{approximately}} 64% of the hindlimbs, Postosuchus {{had small}} hands bearing five toes. Only the first toe bore a large claw, {{which was used}} as an offensive weapon, and the forelimbs were robust, probably to hold the prey. The feet were much larger than the hands, with the fifth metatarsal forming a hook shape. The <b>halluxes</b> were more slender than the other toes and the marginal ones could not touch the ground. Being a crurotarsan, the heel and ankle of Postosuchus resemble those of modern crocodiles.|$|R
40|$|Saethre-Chotzen {{syndrome}} is an autosomal acrocephalosyndactyly syndrome whose gene {{has been assigned}} to chromosome 7 p (TWIST). A case of a 13 -year-old girl with Saethre-Chotzen syndrome (ACS III) is described. The features of the syndrome include: turriplagiocephaly with a cranial circumference of 52 cm, facial asymmetry, low hairline, proptosis, antimongoloid slanting of palpebral fissures, nasal deviation with high bridge, angled ears, scoliosis and torticollis, clinodactyly of {{the fourth and fifth}} toes, large <b>halluxes,</b> and neurosensorial hypoacusia. For correction of the deformity, a cranioorbital remodeling was performed. The craniofacial approach with remodeling of the frontal bar and reduction of the turricephaly resulted in a satisfactory morphological and functional outcome, with complete three-dimensional reshaping and remodeling of the frontonasoorbital area...|$|R
50|$|With the forelimbs being {{approximately}} 64% of the hindlimbs, Postosuchus {{had small}} hands bearing five toes. Only the first toe bore a large claw, {{which was used}} as an offensive weapon, and the forelimbs were robust, probably to hold the prey. The feet were much larger than the hands, with the fifth metatarsal forming a hook shape. The <b>halluxes</b> were more slender than the other toes and the marginal ones could not touch the ground. Being a crurotarsan, the heel and ankle of Postosuchus resemble those of modern crocodiles. The limbs were located underneath the body giving Postosuchus an upright stance. Historically, there has been debate over whether or not rauisuchids like Postosuchus were mainly bipedal or quadrupedal. Each one of Postosuchuss two forelimbs was slightly over half the size of the hindlimbs. This characteristic of short forelimbs can usually be seen in bipedal reptiles. Chatterjee suggested that Postosuchus could walk in an erect stance, since the short forelimbs were probably used only during slow locomotion. In 1995 Robert Long and Phillip A. Murry argued that Postosuchus was heavily built and quadrupedal. Peyer et al. 2008, argued that the thick pectoral girdle served for locomotion of the forelimbs. However, they noted that this does not detract from the theory that Postosuchus could also walk bipedally. In 2013, a major study of the skeletal structure concluded that Postosuchus may have been an obligate biped based on evidence from the anatomy of the digits, vertebrae, and pelvis. The proportions of the limbs and weight-bearing sections of the spine were very similar to many theropod dinosaurs, nearly all of which are thought to have been strictly bipedal.|$|R
5|$|The mystacial vibrissae (whiskers on {{the upper}} lips) reach {{the tips of the}} ears when pressed against the head. The short, rounded ears {{themselves}} are naked on the inside, but covered with short brown hairs on the outer surface. Females have three pairs of mammae. The digits and metapodials are mostly covered by white hairs. Short ungual tufts of hairs surrounding the bases of the claws are present. There are five pads on the forefeet and six on the hindfeet. On the hindfeet, the fifth digit is nearly as long as the middle three and the first (the <b>hallux)</b> is much shorter. The tail is longer than the head and body and appears naked for most of its length, but fine hairs are visible near the tip. Although the lower side is slightly lighter, there is no clear difference in coloration between the upper and lower sides. The skin of the tail is gray, and it is covered lightly by fine hairs that are dark brown over most of the length of the tail, but white near the tip.|$|E
5|$|Woodpeckers, piculets and wrynecks all possess {{characteristic}} zygodactyl feet, {{consisting of}} four toes, the first (<b>hallux)</b> {{and the fourth}} facing backward and {{the second and third}} facing forward. This foot arrangement is good for grasping the limbs and trunks of trees. Members of this family can walk vertically up a tree trunk, which is beneficial for activities such as foraging for food or nest excavation. In addition to their strong claws and feet, woodpeckers have short, strong legs. This is typical of birds that regularly forage on trunks. Exceptions are the black-backed woodpecker and the American and Eurasian three-toed woodpeckers, which have only three toes on each foot. The tails of all woodpeckers, except the piculets and wrynecks, are stiffened, and when the bird perches on a vertical surface, the tail and feet work together to support it.|$|E
5|$|Strickland and Melville {{established}} that the dodo was anatomically similar to pigeons in many features. They pointed to the very short keratinous portion of the beak, with its long, slender, naked basal part. Other pigeons also have bare skin around their eyes, almost reaching their beak, as in dodos. The forehead was high {{in relation to the}} beak, and the nostril was located low on the middle of the beak and surrounded by skin, a combination of features shared only with pigeons. The legs of the dodo were generally more similar to those of terrestrial pigeons than of other birds, both in their scales and in their skeletal features. Depictions of the large crop hinted at a relationship with pigeons, in which this feature is more developed than in other birds. Pigeons generally have very small clutches, and the dodo is said to have laid a single egg. Like pigeons, the dodo lacked the vomer and septum of the nostrils, and it shared details in the mandible, the zygomatic bone, the palate, and the <b>hallux.</b> The dodo differed from other pigeons mainly in the small size of the wings and the large size of the beak in proportion {{to the rest of the}} cranium.|$|E
40|$|The {{degree of}} {{multiscale}} complexity in human behavioral regulation, {{such as that}} required for postural control, appears to decrease with advanced aging or disease. To help delineate causes and functional consequences of complexity loss, we {{examined the effects of}} visual and somatosensory impairment on the complexity of postural sway during quiet standing and its relationship to postural adaptation to cognitive dual tasking. Participants of the MOBILIZE Boston Study were classified into mutually exclusive groups: controls [intact vision and foot somatosensation, n = 299, 76 Â± 5 (SD) yr old], visual impairment only (< 20 / 40 vision, n = 81, 77 Â± 4 yr old), somatosensory impairment only (inability to perceive 5. 07 monofilament on plantar <b>halluxes,</b> n = 48, 80 Â± 5 yr old), and combined impairments (n = 25, 80 Â± 4 yr old). Postural sway (i. e., center-of-pressure) dynamics were assessed during quiet standing and cognitive dual tasking, and a complexity index was quantified using multiscale entropy analysis. Postural sway speed and area, which did not correlate with complexity, were also computed. During quiet standing, the complexity index (mean Â± SD) was highest in controls (9. 5 Â± 1. 2) and successively lower in the visual (9. 1 Â± 1. 1), somatosensory (8. 6 Â± 1. 6), and combined (7. 8 Â± 1. 3) impairment groups (P = 0. 001). Dual tasking resulted in increased sway speed and area but reduced complexity (P < 0. 01). Lower complexity during quiet standing correlated with greater absolute (R = â 0. 34, P = 0. 002) and percent (R = â 0. 45, P < 0. 001) increases in postural sway speed from quiet standing to dual-tasking conditions. Sensory impairments contributed to decreased postural sway complexity, which reflected reduced adaptive capacity of the postural control system. Relatively low baseline complexity may, therefore, indicate control systems that are more vulnerable to cognitive and other stressors...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Title: ATYPICAL PRESENTATION OF TRISOMY 13 IN THE CONTEXT OF MATERNAL AMPHETAMINE AND BENZODIAZEPINE ABUSE Abstract ID: 244 Abstract Category: Clinical Research Patrick Staso MD and Theotonius Gomes MD â¨ABSTRACT: â¨An {{atypical}} case of Trisomy 13 (47,+ 13) {{with three}} independent copies of Trisomy 13 identified by Microarray Analysis confirmed with limited chromosomal analysis. â¨CASE: â¨A term appearing infant later confirmed {{to be of}} 38 weeks gestational age was delivered in the pre-hospital setting via spontaneous vaginal delivery to a 33 year old G 4 P 1022 mother with no prenatal care in ambulance en route to hospital. She had meconium stained amniotic fluid, ruptured at delivery with unknown GBS status. APGAR scores were noted at 3 and 6 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. Mother was unaware of her current pregnancy and {{had a history of}} preeclampsia, 2 prior spontaneous abortions, and depression. There was no history of maternal medication use; however, a urine drug screen was positive for amphetamines, methamphetamines and benzodiazepines. Motherâs history was also significant for prior previous term twin delivery. â¨The child presented to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit and was found to have an un-ruptured omphalocele (beside reduced at 9 hrs of life), postaxial polydactyly of bilateral hand and toes, partial syndactally of bilateral <b>halluxes,</b> and dysmorphic facial features. A portable CXR was obtained which showed meso/dextrocardia. A 3 / 6 loud systolic murmur was noted and a cardiac echo demonstrated a small secundum ASD, large mal-aligned VSD or possible double outlet right ventricle (DORV) and moderate sized PDA with mild biventricular hypertrophy. â¨Discussion: â¨Patau syndrome has a prevalence between 1 : 7, 000 - 29, 000 depending on the source and is the third most common autosomal trisomy. The average length of survival is approximately 9 months with 90 % of patients dying before the age of 1 year. Methamphetamines have only been mentioned in one other case report as a possible cause and no association of benzodiazepines were found. As well, an omphalocele is not common to Patau, but rather, is associated with Edward Syndrome (Trisomy 18). Most cases of trisomy 13 result from nondisjunction and have a low chance of recurrence. Overall, the low prevalence of this disorder, distinct abnormalities to this case, and possible etiologies from illicit substances makes this case important to share with the medical community...|$|R
25|$|In some Muridae the <b>hallux</b> is clawless {{and fully}} opposable, {{including}} arboreal {{species such as}} Hapalomys, Chiropodomys, Vandeleuria, and Chiromyscus; and saltatorial, bipedal species such as Notomys and possibly some Gerbillinae.|$|E
25|$|The {{trouble with}} this account is that Gigantopithecus {{was not a}} hominin and maybe not even a crown group hominoid; yet the {{physical}} evidence implies that Bigfoot is an upright biped with buttocks and a long, stout, permanently adducted <b>hallux.</b> These are hominin autapomorphies, not found in other mammals or other bipeds. It seems unlikely that Gigantopithecus would have evolved these uniquely hominin traits in parallel.|$|E
25|$|An {{osteotomy}} is {{a surgical}} operation whereby a bone is cut to shorten or lengthen it or {{to change its}} alignment. It is sometimes performed to correct a <b>hallux</b> valgus, or to straighten a bone that has healed crookedly following a fracture. It {{is also used to}} correct a coxa vara, genu valgum, and genu varum. The operation is done under a general anaesthetic.|$|E
25|$|Zhang et al. {{also noted}} that the foot of Epidendrosaurus is unique among non-avian theropods. While the Epidendrosaurus {{specimen}} does not preserve a reversed <b>hallux,</b> the backward-facing toe seen in modern perching birds, its foot was very similar in construction to more primitive perching birds like Cathayornis and Longipteryx. These adaptations for grasping ability in all four limbs makes it likely that Epidendrosaurus spent a significant amount of time living in trees.|$|E
25|$|After {{three weeks}} of age, Maguari stork nestlings develop {{defensive}} behaviour if their nest is approached by an intruder; which is not known for nestlings of other stork species. They crouch forward, partially spread their wings and erect the black feathers on their head, neck and back; followed by a shrill, rasping scream and an attempt to grab a persistent intruder with their bill. In many other stork species, akinesia lasts {{throughout much of the}} nestlingsâ early life, and the constantly white plumage makes them appear as eggs to potential chick predators. However, in maguari stork nestlings, akinesia ceases much earlier, and the unusual aggressiveness of the young has probably developed as a specialised anti-predator strategy in compensation for the young chicksâ inability to leave the nest due to their slow-developing <b>hallux</b> and the vulnerable position of the nest on the ground. However, at 25â35 days old, the <b>hallux</b> is sufficiently developed to allow the chicks to leave ground nests in search of food. Chicks also occasionally beg for food from their parents outside the nest, but parents have never been observed to feed their young outside the nest.|$|E
25|$|The legs of {{the chimney}} swift, like those of all swifts, are very short. Its feet are small but strong, with very short toes that are tipped with sharp, curved claws. The toes are anisodactylâthree forward, one backâlike those of most birds, but the chimney swift can swivel its back toe (its <b>hallux)</b> forward to help it get a better grip. Unlike the legs and feet of most birds, those of the chimney swift have no scales; instead, they are covered with smooth skin.|$|E
25|$|Coelophysis had narrow hips, forelimbs {{adapted for}} grasping, and narrow feet. Its neck and tail {{were long and}} slender. The pelvis and hindlimbs of C. bauri are also slight {{variations}} on the theropod body plan. It has the open acetabulum and straight ankle hinge that define the Dinosauria. The hindlimb ended in a three-toed foot (pes), with a raised <b>hallux.</b> The tail had an unusual structure within its interlocking prezygapophysis of its vertebrae, which formed a semi-rigid lattice, apparently to stop the tail from moving up and down.|$|E
25|$|The pelvis was {{connected}} to a sacrum formed by seven sacral vertebrae. The pubis was strongly pointing backwards. The left and right ischia were not fused. The femur was straight; the tibia only slightly longer. The metatarsals of the foot were relatively short and fused {{to each other and}} to the lower ankle bones, forming a tarsometatarsus. A rudimentary fifth metatarsal is present. The first metatarsal was attached to the lower shaft of the second and supported a first toe or <b>hallux,</b> pointing to the back. The formula of the toe phalanges was 2-3-4-5-0. The proportions of the toes suggest that they were used for both walking and perching, while the large claws of the thumb and third finger were probably used for climbing.|$|E
25|$|Anchiornis {{had very}} long legs, {{which is usually}} an {{indication}} that an animal is a strong runner. However, the extensive leg feathers indicate {{that this may be}} a vestigial trait, as running animals tend to have reduced, not increased, hair or feathers on their legs. Like most paravians, Anchiornis had four toes on the foot, with the third and fourth toes the longest. The first toe, or <b>hallux,</b> was not reversed as in perching species. The hindwings of Anchiornis were also shorter than those of Microraptor, and were made up of 12â13 flight feathers anchored to the tibia (lower leg) and 10â11 to the tarsus (upper foot). Also unlike Microraptor, the hindwing feathers were longest closer to the body, with the foot feathers being short and directed downward, almost perpendicular to the foot bones.|$|E
25|$|High-heeled shoes slant {{the foot}} forward and down while bending the toes up. The more the feet are forced into this position, {{the more it}} may cause the {{gastrocnemius}} muscle (part of the calf muscle) to shorten. This may cause problems when the wearer chooses lower heels or flat-soled shoes. When the foot slants forward, a much greater weight is transferred to the ball of the foot and the toes, increasing the likelihood of damage to the underlying soft tissue that supports the foot. In many shoes, style dictates function, either compressing the toes or forcing them together, possibly resulting in blisters, corns, hammer toes, bunions (<b>hallux</b> valgus), Morton's neuroma, plantar fasciitis and many other medical conditions, {{most of which are}} permanent and require surgery to alleviate the pain.|$|E
25|$|In {{describing}} Scansoriopteryx, Czerkas & Yuan cited {{evidence for}} an arboreal (tree-dwelling) lifestyle. They noted that, unlike all modern bird hatchlings, the forelimbs of Scansoriopteryx are {{longer than the}} hind limbs. The authors argued that this anomaly indicates the forelimbs {{played an important role}} in locomotion even at an extremely early developmental stage. Scansoriopteryx has a well-preserved foot, and the authors interpreted the <b>hallux</b> as reversed, the condition of a backward-pointing toe being widespread among modern tree-dwelling birds. Furthermore, the authors pointed to the short, stiffened tail of the Scansoriopteryx specimen as a tree-climbing adaptation. The tail may have been used as a prop, much like the tails of modern woodpeckers. Comparison with the hands of modern climbing species with elongated third digits, like iguanid lizards, also supports the tree-climbing hypothesis. Indeed, the hands of Scansoriopteryx are much better adapted to climbing than the modern tree-climbing hatchling of the hoatzin.|$|E
25|$|In the Venezuelan llanos, the maguari stork is {{also found}} to nest in low, thick-trunked trees {{including}} Ficus pertusa and Randia venezuelansis. These nests comprise sticks that are usually less than a metre long and less than 2cm in diameter, and often from the palm species Copernicia tectorum. Nevertheless, the species {{does not seem to}} naturally perch in trees because unlike its sympatric heterospecifics such as the jabiru, it cannot stand on its <b>hallux.</b> Therefore, it probably only nests opportunistically above the ground. The same nest may be used by a pair in successive years, sometimes for as long as seven years. However, ground nests composed of herbaceous plants usually disintegrate after a year, whereupon the same breeding pair returns to the nest site to rebuild the nest. Both partners participate in building and lining the nest, which continues throughout incubation and brooding. Nest lining usually begins when the base is about a metre wide, and lining material largely consists of wet grass that dries and hardens in the intense sun.|$|E
25|$|Three of the {{anterior}} muscles are extensors. From its origin on the lateral {{surface of the}} tibia and the interosseus membrane, the three-sided belly of the tibialis anterior extends down below the superior and inferior extensor retinacula to its insertion on the plantar side of the medial cuneiform bone and the first metatarsal bone. In the non-weight-bearing leg, {{the anterior}} tibialis dorsal flexes the foot and lifts the medial edge of the foot. In the weight-bearing leg, it pulls the leg towards the foot. The extensor digitorum longus has a wide origin stretching from the lateral condyle of the tibia down along the anterior side of the fibula, and the interosseus membrane. At the ankle, the tendon divides into four that stretch across the foot to the dorsal aponeuroses of the last phalanges of the four lateral toes. In the non-weight-bearing leg, the muscle extends the digits and dorsiflexes the foot, and in the weight-bearing leg acts similar to the tibialis anterior. The extensor hallucis longus has its origin on the fibula and the interosseus membrane between the two other extensors and is, similarly to the extensor digitorum, is inserted on the last phalanx of big toe ("hallux"). The muscle dorsiflexes the <b>hallux,</b> and acts similar to the tibialis anterior in the weight-bearing leg.|$|E

500|$|Albertosaurus {{shared a}} similar body {{appearance}} {{with all other}} tyrannosaurids. Typically for a theropod, Albertosaurus was bipedal and balanced the heavy head and torso with a long tail. However, tyrannosaurid forelimbs were extremely small for their body size and retained only two digits. The hind limbs were long and ended in a four-toed foot on which the first digit, called the <b>hallux,</b> was short and did not reach the ground. The third [...] digit was longer than the rest. Albertosaurus may {{have been able to}} reach walking speeds of 14â21km/hour (8â13mi/hour). At least for the younger individuals, a high running speed is plausible.|$|E
500|$|The hindlimbs were long, slender, {{and ended}} in four toes, {{the first of which}} (the <b>hallux)</b> did not contact the ground. Uniquely for ornithischians, several bones of the leg and foot were fused: the tibia and fibula were fused with upper tarsal bones (astragalus and calcaneus), forming a tibiotarsus, while the lower tarsal bones were fused with the {{metatarsal}} bones, forming a tarsometatarsus. This constellation can also [...] be found in modern birds, where it has evolved independently. The tibiotarsus was about 30% longer than the femur. The ungual bones of the toes were claw-like, and not hoof-like as in more advanced ornithischians.|$|E
500|$|The early {{primates}} {{include both}} nocturnal and diurnal small-bodied species, {{and all were}} arboreal, with hands and feet specially adapted for maneuvering on small branches. Plesiadapiforms from the early Paleocene are sometimes considered [...] "archaic primates" [...] because their teeth resembled those of early primates, and because they possessed arboreal adaptations, such as a divergent <b>hallux</b> (big toe). Although plesiadapiforms were closely related to primates, they may represent a paraphyletic group from which primates {{may or may not}} have directly evolved, and some genera may have been more closely related to colugos, also known as dermopterans or [...] "flying lemurs", which are thought to be closely related to primates.|$|E
500|$|The <b>hallux</b> (the first toe of the foot) {{showed a}} large claw that was {{flattened}} laterally, {{as seen in}} [...] "prosauropods". However, the claws of {{the second and third}} toe were unusual in being nail-like and broader than deep. This feature was also found in the probably closely related Tazoudasaurus, but is absent in all other sauropods. The feet of Vulcanodon were semiplantigrade as in later sauropods (where both the digits and part of the metatarsals contact the ground), a derived feature not found in more basal sauropods like Isanosaurus. However, they also retained primitive features, like the fact that the phalanges were not reduced.|$|E
