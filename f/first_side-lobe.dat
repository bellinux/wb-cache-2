50|$|Unfortunately, the {{distinction}} between dBd and dBi is often left unstated and the reader is sometimes forced to infer which was used. For example, a Yagi-Uda antenna is constructed from several dipoles arranged at precise intervals to create better energy focusing (directivity) than a simple dipole. Since it is constructed from dipoles, often its antenna gain is expressed in dBd, but listed only as dB. Obviously this ambiguity is undesirable with respect to engineering specifications. A Yagi-Uda antenna's maximum directivity is 8.77 dBd = 10.92 dBi. Its gain necessarily must be less than this by the factor η, which must be negative in units of dB. Neither ERP nor EIRP can be calculated without knowledge of the power accepted by the antenna, i.e., it is not correct to use units of dBd or dBi with ERP and EIRP. Let us assume a 100 Watt (20 dBW) transmitter with losses of 6 dB prior to the antenna. ERP < 22.77dBW and EIRP < 24.92dBW, both less than ideal by η in dB. Assuming that the receiver is in the <b>first</b> <b>side-lobe</b> of the transmitting antenna, and each value is further reduced by 7.2 dB, which is the decrease in directivity from the main to side-lobe of a Yagi-Uda. Therefore, anywhere along the side-lobe direction from this transmitter, a blind receiver could not tell the difference if a Yagi-Uda was replaced with either an ideal dipole (oriented towards the receiver) or an isotropic radiator with antenna input power increased by 1.57 dB.|$|E
40|$|Reduction of <b>first</b> <b>side-lobe</b> level (SLL) and nulls in {{artificial}} fishnet metalenses {{is accomplished}} here {{by applying the}} reference phase concept along with the zoning technique. Higher focusing efficiency is achieved for a specific reference phase when comparing numerically and experimentally four different designs. For such best design, an improvement of the first SLL (~ 2. 4 dB), first null (~ 13 dB), and gain (~ 1. 77 dB) is achieved experimentally compared to the design without reference phase...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} a secondary-element spider support {{structure}} on optical antenna transmitter gain is analyzed. An expression describing {{the influence of the}} struts on the axial gain, in both the near and far fields, is derived {{as a function of the}} number of struts and their width. It is found that, for typical systems, the struts degrade the on-axis gain by less than 0. 4 dB, and the <b>first</b> <b>side-lobe</b> level is not increased significantly. Contour plots have also been included to show the symmetry of the far-field distributions for three- and four-support members...|$|E

The objectives of this array are to achieve wide impedance bandwidth, improve reflection coefficient, S- 11 and Voltage Standing Wave Ratio (VSWR). Additionally, a Probe-Fed Microstrip based Dipole (PFMD) array is also constructed to compare {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed SCMD array. Both designs are simulated using a three-dimensional electromagnetic simulation tool for design evaluation. In addition, hardware prototypes are also constructed and antenna parameters measurement are conducted in the multipurpose and wideband anechoic chamber in order to verify the actual performance of both designs. Comparison between simulated and measured results for both microstrip based dipole array with different feeding structure of balun is carried out.

40|$|International audienceAn {{integrated}} {{solution for}} the development of multilayer antenna modules for fifth-generation (5 G) communications, based on low temperature cofired ceramic (LTCC), is presented. The design exploits the 3 -D integration capabilities of the LTCC process, enabling the realization of a full-corporate feed network (CFN) in vertical configuration. A novel implementation of the CFN employing dielectric-embedded parallel plate waveguides (PPWs) is proposed. The PPW lines are delimited by via-rows. As opposed to standard substrate-integrated waveguide feed networks, guided fields are orthogonal to the via-rows and propagate along the vertical axis of the structure. The CFN feeds four long slots, without any coupling structure, and provides broadband operation. The final prototype comprises 18 LTCC tapes, with a total thickness of 3. 4 mm. The measured - 10 -dB impedance bandwidth spans from 51. 2 to 66 GHz (> 25. 2 %). The module generates a fixed broadside beam, but multibeam operation in H-plane can be easily achieved. In the 50 - 66 -GHz band, the peak gain is 14. 25 dBi and the average <b>first</b> <b>side-lobe</b> level in H-plane is - 20. 6 dB. The proposed technology and the design concept are suited for highly integrated millimeter-wave systems, such as access points in the future V-band high data-rate wireless networks. © 1963 - 2012 IEEE...|$|E
40|$|The {{need for}} {{flexibility}} in array design and more accurate {{control over the}} slot radiation level {{has led to the}} design of post slot antenna. A post slot waveguide antenna consists of a centreline longitudinal slot with a tuning post. By varying the probe depth and slot length, it is possible to produce beam steering effect electromechanically. The objective {{of this paper is to}} propose a novel post slot configuration for waveguide antenna design. The desired operating frequency is 1. 4 GHz for L-band remote sensing application. This paper presents the simulation and measurement of the proposed post slot waveguide antenna. Simulation on a four-element of conventional shunt slot and the proposed post slot antenna arrays has been carried out by using a three-dimensional electromagnetic simulation tool. It is shown that the post slot array antenna has superior performance as compared to the conventional shunt slot array antenna in terms of <b>first</b> <b>side-lobe</b> level. A series of measurement on two hardware prototypes (proposed post slot and conventional shunt slot array antennas) has been conducted in an indoor anechoic chamber. The measurement results clearly indicate the flexibility of the proposed post slot in controlling radiation pattern as compared to the conventional shunt slot configurations...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} the antenna {{far-field}} power pattern limits the imaging performance of modern wide-bandwidth, high-sensitivity interferometric radio telescopes. Given {{a model for the}} aperture illumination pattern (AIP) of the antenna, referred to as the A-term, the wide-band (WB) A-Projection algorithm corrects for the effects of its time, frequency, and polarization structure. The level to which this correction is possible depends on how accurately the A-term, represents the true AIP. In this paper, we describe the A-Solver methodology that combines physical modeling with optimization to holographic measurements to build an accurate model for the AIP. Using a parametrized ray-tracing code as the predictor, we solve for the frequency dependence of the antenna optics and show that the resulting low-order model for the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) antenna captures the dominant frequency-dependent terms. The A-Solver methodology described here is generic and can be adapted for other types of antennas as well. The parameterization is based on the physical characteristics of the antenna structure and optics and is therefore arguably a compact representation (minimized degrees of freedom) of the frequency-dependent structure of the antenna A-term. In this paper, we also show that the parameters derived from A-Solver methodology are expected to improve sensitivity and imaging performance out to the <b>first</b> <b>side-lobe</b> of the antenna.

40|$|For {{the purpose}} of pre Galileo system {{verification}} and testing, the Galileo Test Environment (GATE) is setup in the German Alps to reproduce a realistic test bed for the Galileo satellite navigation system. In fact, a complete miniature navigation system is built up consisting of a control, ground and pseudo-space segment. For system monitoring and testing a receiver is required, which is capable of processing all signals specified in the Galileo system specification. To prove interoperability and for reference purposes the receiver will also process Galileo and GPS signals on L 1 in a common processing chain. This paper describes a modular receiver design, developed for the use as a user receiver {{as well as a}} system monitor receiver. Detailed results from performance tests will be presented. Up to three single band receivers with radio frequency front-end and base band processor occupy up to nine slots of the PXI framework to serve any of the Galileo radio frequency ban ds E 5, E 6 and L 1. One base-band board and a front-end system consisting of two cPCI boards cover each frequency band. The front-end system consists of a digital signal conditioning board and an analog front-end board. As the base-band units are based on field programmable gate arrays (FPGA), the actual band specific functionality of the receiver is implemented in a HDL and uploaded to the system. This flexibility allows all base-band units to be designed identically. The three receiver front-ends similarly have an identical PCB-layout, which reduces costs. The digital signal conditioning boards are all identical. The analog front-end boards have identical PCB layout, but differ in the components fitted (filters, LO-frequencies). Receiving the whole E 5 band (i. e. E 5 a and E 5 b) including the <b>first</b> <b>side-lobe</b> (71 MHz) through one front-end system is the single most challenging requirement on the front-end system. To fulfill the required amplitude and group delay flatness in the pass-band is very challen...|$|E
