500|$|Hail to the Thiefs lyrics were {{influenced}} by what Yorke called [...] "the general sense of ignorance and intolerance and panic and stupidity" [...] following the 2000 election of US President George W. Bush. He took words and phrases from discussion of the unfolding War on Terror and used them in the album's lyrics and artwork. He denied any intent to make a [...] "political statement" [...] with the songs, and told the Toronto Star: [...] "I desperately tried not to write anything political, anything expressing the deep, profound terror I'm living with day to day. But it's just fucking there, and <b>eventually</b> <b>you</b> {{have to give it}} up and let it happen." ...|$|E
500|$|They and {{the episode}} writers {{developed}} a storyline {{in which a}} victim's childhood experimentation, when they were injected with something, was now [...] "coming back to haunt them." [...] Whitman noted that the concept, like others in the show, was based on real scientific knowledge, [...] "The notion is, {{some kind of a}} medical treatment that they were given allowed their brain to command vibrations that would take place. It really is true that essentially what heat is is vibrations of atoms, so if your brain can cause some kind of vibration to take place, <b>eventually</b> <b>you</b> could create enough heat to even create a flame." [...] Pinkner added, [...] "And if you haven't yet mastered pyrokinesis and the ability to excite molecules that are outside your body, well then you're going to excite the ones inside your body and you're going to blow up, sadly." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{designing}} Dragon Quest, Horii play-tests {{the games}} {{to make certain}} the controls feel right. This includes going into meticulous details such as how fast a page opens or the way a door opens. According to Horii, [...] "... little things like here and there the controls not feeling right and such can really grate the players' nerves if the tempo isn't right." [...] He believes players {{should be able to}} control the game unconsciously, which is not easy to accomplish. Horii tries to design the games {{in such a way that}} players never need to read a manual nor play through a tutorial in order to figure out how to play the game, and tries to create good storylines with short dialogues. Ryutaro Ichimura, who has worked on Dragon Quest titles with Horii since Dragon QuestVIII, has implemented Horii's suggestions even when it is not obvious why his ideas will work. [...] " [...] lot of the time when he [...] points these things out, we cannot see them at first, but <b>eventually</b> <b>you</b> get it." ...|$|E

A skinhead that told Davis to [...] "go back to Bakersfield" [...] attempted to hit Davis but he dodged and the band's road manager, Jeff, knocked the skinhead out. [...] "Helmet in the Bush" [...] was about Davis' drug abuse, and the fear that gripped him {{at the height of}} his drug problem. He pleaded for a divine intervention to deliver him from his nightmare, as if he cannot help himself. Davis explained: [...] "I'd wake up in the morning and do a line to get out of bed. Speed in the morning, I'd have it all lined up for breakfast so when I'd lay down and go to sleep, I'd wake up and just snort and it's like 'Yeah, okay, I'm up. ' It was bad. It's like, you do one line and stay up all night, but then you have shit to do the next day so you have to do another line to be able keep staying up to get that shit done. <b>Eventually</b> <b>you</b> start spinning-out from sleep deprivation. You get hallucinations and shit like that." [...] Davis said that [...] "Helmet in the Bush" [...] "is about meth. It's about when you do meth and you look down at your dick and it's literally a helmet in the bush [...] ". [...] "Basically it's what happens when you do too much drugs and your girl wanna get with you and you got some man problems down below. Just another reason not to do drugs, children," [...] Fieldy elaborated.|$|E
2500|$|Screenwriter Nicholas Pileggi said of Saul and Elaine Bass, [...] "You {{write a book}} of 300 to 400 {{pages and}} then you boil {{it down to a}} script of maybe 100 to 150 pages. <b>Eventually</b> <b>you</b> have the {{pleasure}} of seeing that the Basses have knocked you right out of the ballpark.

"I {{never had}} a son, and after Elizabeth's mother died I {{have lived in the}} hope somehow that she would marry the sort of chap who would really take the place of such a son as every man dreams of--some one who will take his place and carry on his work when he is ready to lay aside his tools.
