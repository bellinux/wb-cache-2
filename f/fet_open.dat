40|$|Large graphs are {{difficult}} to browse and to visually explore. This note adds up evidence that some graph drawing techniques, which produce readable layouts when applied to medium-size graphs, yield self-similar patterns when launched on huge graphs. To prove this, we consider the problem of assessing the self-similarity of graph drawings, and measure the box-counting dimension of the output of three algorithms, each using a different approach for producing orthogonal grid drawings with a reduced number of bends.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study the {{clustered}} graphs whose underlying graph is a cycle. This {{is a simple}} family of clustered graphs that are "highly non connected". We start by studying 3 -cluster cycles, that are clustered graphs such that the underlying graph is a simple cycle and there are three clusters {{all at the same}} level. We show that in this case testing the c-planarity can be done efficiently and give an efficient drawing algorithm. Also, we characterize 3 -cluster cycles in terms of formal grammars. Finally, we generalize the results on 3 -cluster cycles considering clustered graphs that at each level of the inclusion tree have a cycle structure. Even in this case we show efficient c-planarity testing and drawing algorithms.

40|$|The {{project is}} a circuit that will {{basically}} supply current from the battery to the different stator coils at opportune moments. With a hall-effect sensor on the shaft as a feedback to a microcontroller, I was able to toggle switches based on {{the position of the}} shaft at the moments where we would be using as little power as possible. The operation of the control circuit works similar to a stepper motor; it takes a signal from the microcontroller that is sent to some FET drivers, which in turn sends signals to the <b>FETs</b> to <b>open</b> or close as the shaft is rotating. Since the stator coils are set at a certain angle apart from each other, it was an advantage to know where the starting point was, and extrapolate where every other magnet was with respect to the coils by putting the hall-effect sensor in line with one set of permanent magnets. This way, current was only sent to the stator coils when it was necessary to turn the motor. The idea was that we could conserve power by drawing from the battery less often, but made little progress in the final testing stages in conjunction with the motor. We ran into many problems with the inductor coils on the stator due to a communication error, so the core for the inductors needed to be completely redesigned...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the design improvement of a Sequential Shunt Switching Regulator (S 3 R) {{based on a}} power cell composed of one switching FET and one Diode connecting the Solar Array (SA) section to the Main Bus. This topology allows to minimize the S 3 R cells dimensions, to optimize the efficiency figures and complies with the electrical Single Point Failure Free (SPFF) requirement on the Main Bus. The single switching FET can cause the loss of one Solar array section if it fails in short circuit, while its failure in open can be compensated {{by the presence of}} one additional (spare) shunt section positioned on Main Bus to drain the power eventually in excess. If the series redundancy of the Diode is removed, its failure in short circuit, causes overload on the Main Bus when the switching FET turns ON. To avoid the possible subsequent failure in short circuit of the switching FET due to over-heating, with permanent loss of Main Bus, the maximum current drawn by the FET in failure condition and the duration of this operation mode must be strictly controlled in order to avoid thermal overstress and consequently thermal failure propagation. The adopted solution foresees a circuitry that controls the current in the FET, both the peak in the first transient and the subsequent limited value, and forces the <b>FET</b> in permanent <b>open</b> status after a short period, compatible with the overheat of the FET junction. No spurious cause leads to the permanent loss of the S 3 R section due to permanent activation of the protection, causing the switching element (FET) to be continuously open. In fact a dedicated circuit, activated by sensing of the Error Signal, unlatches the section to restore the power control. The presented design has found its first application in the PCDU for the COSMO-SkyMed Second Generation (CSG) satellite power system.

40|$|Incluye {{material}} complementarioSound can levitate {{objects of}} different sizes and materials through air, water and tissue. This allows us to manipulate cells, liquids, compounds or living things without touching or contaminating them. However, acoustic levitation has required the targets to be enclosed with acoustic elements or had limited manoeuvrability. Here we optimize the phases used to drive an ultrasonic phased array and show that acoustic levitation can be employed to translate, rotate and manipulate particles using even a single-sided emitter. Furthermore, we introduce the holographic acoustic elements framework that permits the rapid generation of traps and provides a bridge between optical and acoustical trapping. Acoustic structures shaped as tweezers, twisters or bottles emerge as the optimum mechanisms for tractor beams or containerless transportation. Single-beam levitation could manipulate particles inside our body for applications in targeted drug delivery or acoustically controlled micro-machines that do not interfere with magnetic resonance imaging.

Moreover this technique allows for (sub) micrometric control on the positioning thanks to a new three-step protocol that has been designed with this aim. With this methodology the exact target coordinates are registered by scanning the tip over the predetermined area previous to its coating with the ink and deposition.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{influence}} that resource availability has on cooperation {{in the context of}} hunter-gatherer societies. This paper proposes a model based on archaeological and ethnographic research on resource stress episodes, which exposes three different cooperative regimes according to the relationship between resource availability in the environment and population size. The most interesting regime represents moderate survival stress in which individuals coordinate in an evolutionary way to increase the probabilities of survival and reduce the risk of failing to meet the minimum needs for survival. Populations self-organise in an indirect reciprocity system in which the norm that emerges is to share the part of the resource that is not strictly necessary for survival, thereby collectively lowering the chances of starving. Our findings shed further light on the emergence and evolution of cooperation in hunter-gatherer societies.

We {{report on}} a {{comparative}} study of electronic and magnetic properties of Mn 6 single-molecule magnets (SMMs) grafted on gold surface. Two derivatives with spin-ground states S = 4 and S = 12 have been functionalized with 3 -tp-CO 2 − (3 -thiophene carboxylate, tpc) ligands and characterized as thick films (TFs) as well as sub-monolayers (sMLs) by synchrotron based techniques. X-ray absorption spectroscopy at the Mn L 2, 3 edges shows the modification of the spectral lineshape in the sMLs {{with respect to the}} TFs suggesting that the local symmetry at the Mn sites changes once the molecules are deposited on gold surface. In spite of this, the expected MnIII oxidation state is preserved. X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) spectra show that the total magnetic moment is only given by spin part because of the quenched orbital moment. Moreover, variable temperature and variable field XMCD spectra reveal an effective decrease of the Mn spin moment for both derivatives.

The {{question}} of how symbol systems can be instantiated in neural network-like computation is still open. Many technical challenges remain and most proposals do not scale up to realistic examples of symbol processing, for example, language un- derstanding or language production. Here we use a top-down approach. We start from Fluid Construction Grammar, a well- worked out framework for language processing that is compatible with recent insights into Construction Grammar and inves- tigate how we could build a neural compiler that automatically translates grammatical constructions and grammatical processing into neural computations. We proceed in two steps. FCG is translated from symbolic processing to numeric processing using a vector symbolic architecture, and this numeric processing is then translated into neural network computation.

40|$|The overall {{aim of this}} book, {{an outcome}} of the European FP 7 <b>FET</b> <b>Open</b> NESS project, is to {{contribute}} to the ongoing effort to put the quantitative social sciences on a proper footing for the 21 st century. A key focus is economics, and its implications on policy making, where the still dominant traditional approach increasingly struggles to capture the economic realities we observe in the world today - with vested interests getting too often in the way of real advances. Insights into behavioral economics and modern computing techniques have made possible both the integration of larger information sets and the exploration of disequilibrium behavior. The domain-based chapters of this work illustrate how economic theory is the only branch of social sciences which still holds to its old paradigm of an equilibrium science - an assumption that has already been relaxed in all related fields of research in the light of recent advances in complex and dynamical systems theory and related data mining. The other chapters give various takes on policy and decision making in this context. Written in nontechnical style throughout, with a mix of tutorial and essay-like contributions, this book will benefit all researchers, scientists, professionals and practitioners interested in learning about the 'thinking in complexity' to understand how socio-economic systems really work...|$|E
40|$|We {{introduce}} {{a new type of}} diagram called the VV(c) -diagram (the Visibility–Voronoi diagram for clearance c), which is a hybrid between the visibility graph and the Voronoi dia-gram of polygons in the plane. It evolves from the visibility graph to the Voronoi diagram as the parameter c grows from 0 to ∞. This diagram can be used for planning natural-looking paths for a robot translating amidst polygonal obstacles in the plane. A natural-looking path is short, smooth, and keeps — where possible — an amount of clearance c from the obstacles. The VV(c) -diagram contains such paths. We also propose an algorithm that is capable of preprocessing a scene of configuration-space polygonal obstacles and constructs a data struc-ture called the VV-complex. The VV-complex can be used to efficiently plan motion paths for any start and goal configuration and any clearance value c, without having to explicitly construct the VV(c) -diagram for that c-value. The preprocessing time is O(n 2 logn), where n is the total number of obstacle vertices, and the data structure can be queried directly for any c-value by merely performing a Dijkstra search. We have implemented a Cgal-based software package for computing the VV(c) -diagram in an exact manner for a given clearance value, and used it to plan natural-looking paths in various applications. ∗This work has been supported in part by the IST Programme of the EU as Shared-cost RTD (<b>FET</b> <b>Open...</b>|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the behavior of}} Stuart–Landau oscillators as generic limit-cycle oscillators when they are interacting with delay. We investigate the role of amplitude and phase instabilities in producing symmetry-breaking/restoring transitions. Using analytical and numerical methods we compare the dynamics of one oscillator with delayed feedback, two oscillators mutually coupled with delay, and two delay-coupled elements with self-feedback. Taking only the phase dynamics into account, no chaotic dynamics is observed, and {{the stability of the}} identical synchronization solution is the same {{in each of the three}} studied networks of delay-coupled elements. When allowing for a variable oscillation amplitude, the delay can induce amplitude instabilities. We provide analytical proof that, in case of two mutually coupled elements, the onset of an amplitude instability always results in antiphase oscillations, leading to a leader-laggard behavior in the chaotic regime. Adding selffeedback with the same strength and delay as the coupling stabilizes the system in the transverse direction and, thus, promotes the onset of identically synchronized behaviorWe would like to thank T.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to explain some of the ways in which multi agent system (MAS) theory can be used to describe, design and enhance social {{machines}} (also referred to as Socio-Cognitive Systems). We believe there is a really opportunity for the MAS community to engage with emerging theory and practice of designing such systems. Social machines - also referred to as Socio-Cognitive Systems from the MAS community - are terms used to refer to the recent breed of technological systems which allow human and computational agents to socially interact, typically on a large scale and sometimes towards achieving shared goals. Examples include social networking platforms and crowd sourced encyclopaedias. The discussion of social machines and MAS is taken from three perspectives. Firstly, the theoretical notion of an abstract social machine as a socio-cognitive system containing humans and agents is introduced. Secondly, a speci# 12;c instance of a social machine which has been designed to enable social music learning supported by agents is described. Thirdly, an agent architecture which is designed for operation within educational social machines is discussed, with particular focus on what we believe is the core currency of these machines: feedback.

40|$|In industry, society, and science, {{advanced}} {{software is}} used for planning, scheduling, and allocating resources {{in order to improve}} the quality of service, reduce costs, or optimize resource consumption. Examples include power companies generating and distributing electricity, hospitals planning their surgeries, and public transportation companies scheduling their time-tables. This type of problem is often referred to as constraint satisfaction and combinatorial optimization problems. Despite the availability of effective and scalable solvers that are applicable to a wide range of applications, current approaches to this problem are still unsatisfactory. The reason is that in all these applications it is very hard to acquire the constraints and criteria (that is, the model) needed to specify the problem, and, even if one has succeeded in capturing the model at one point, it is likely that it needs to be to changed over time to reflect changes in the environment. Therefore, there is an urgent need for optimizing and revising a model over time based on data that should be continuously gathered about the performance of the solutions and the environment they are used in. Exploiting gathered data to modify the model is difficult and labour intensive with state-of-the-art solvers, as these solvers do not support data mining (DM) and machine learning (ML). However, existing frameworks for constraint satisfaction and combinatorial optimization problems do not support ML/DM techniques. In current ICT technology, DM and ML have almost always been studied independently from solving technology such as constraint programming (CP). On the other hand, a growing number of studies indicate that significant benefits can be obtained by connecting these two fields. This led us to believe – almost five years ago – that it was the right time to develop the foundations of an integrated and cross-disciplinary approach to these two fields. A successful integration of CP and DM has the potential to lead to a new ICT paradigm with far-reaching implications that would change the face of DM/ML as well as CP technology. It would not only allow one to use DM techniques in CP to identify and update constraints and optimization criteria, but also to employ such constraints and criteria in DM and ML in order to discover models compatible with such prior knowledge.
