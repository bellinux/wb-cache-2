40|$|In {{an appeal}} {{from a federal}} {{district}} court verdict and judgment in a wrongful death action, appellees requested that damages be assessed against the appellant because the {{appeal to the court}} of appeals was sued out merely for delay. The appellees’ request was made under a rule of court which is common to all 11 circuit courts of appeals and is found in the rules of the United States Supreme Court and many state appellate court rules. The Federal Judiciary Act of 17896 contained a provision penalizing appeals taken only for purposes of delay, and the uniform rules for circuit courts of appeal adopted in 1891 also contained a section providing for assessment of damages against the appellant in cases of appeals sued out only to delay proceedings on the judgment in the lower court. In the instant case, a wrongful death action, the court held that the appeal was not sued out merely for purposes of delay although the court did find that there was little question but what the verdict and the judgment below should be affirmed. The court expressed a reluctance to award <b>damages</b> <b>for</b> <b>delay</b> largely because of the “cogently put and earnestly argued brief of the appellant. ...|$|E
40|$|Despite the {{seemingly}} universal introduction {{of social science}} methods of instruction, the staples of legal education today differ little from those of many decades ago. Even the most sophisticated modern lawyer continues to remember and understand {{the basic principles of}} civil law in terms of rules propounded to resolve discrete disputes between two single parties. If asked to name the foundations of our civil law, the lawyer today, like the lawyer of the 1920 s, would almost certainly list Pennoyer v. Neff, Hadley v. Baxendale, Brown v. Kendall, and, perhaps, Palsgraf v. Long Island R. R. Company. These cases are recognized today as possessing a certain quaintness, but they remain the building blocks from which our conceptions of civil liability derive. Regrettably, this conception of civil law is becoming increasingly anachronistic. The caseload of the modern civil judge is less likely to be dominated by an action involving an attempt to collect on a note against land (Pennoyer), or <b>damages</b> <b>for</b> <b>delay</b> in delivery (Hadley), or for suffering a hit from a stick (Brown) or a scale (Palsgraf), than by an action involving thejoinder of multiple parties with complex third-party liability claims asserting a causative link that requires complicated scientific understanding. However deeply they are revered, our ancient cases provide no more than a starting point for the unravelling of the difficult issues that are progressively overwhelming modern civil litigation...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this Comment is to urge the California {{legislature}} to revise section 7102 of the Public Contract Code in order to render an NDFD (2 ̆ 2 no <b>damage</b> <b>for</b> <b>delay</b> 2 ̆ 2) clause void as against public policy in every construction contract when delay is caused {{in whole or in}} part by the acts or omissions of the owner or its agents. Part I of this Comment provides the reader with a brief explanation of how construction contracts are formed and describes the nature of liability associated with delay in the construction industry. Part II includes a brief overview of the general enforceability of NDFD clauses and chronicles the numerous exceptions to their enforcement that have evolved through common law and state statutes. Part III presents policy arguments against the enforcement of NDFD clauses and rebuts some common arguments posed in favor of their enforcement. Part IV discusses the current treatment of NDFD clauses in California and challenges the effectiveness of existing legislation in the wake of Harper/Neilson-Dillingham. Part V presents suggested language for the revision of section 7102, modeled on the current Ohio Revised Code Annotated, and explains the practical effect of the proposed revisions. Finally, this Comment concludes by urging the California legislature to revise California Public Contract Code section 7102 to render NDFD clauses unenforceable in all public and private contracts where the owners cause delay.

The thesis consists of five chapters, introduction and conclusion, each of them dealing with different aspects of the legal rules regulating main topic. In the introduction, there are illustrated particular points, which determine tasks of the paper. Chapter One shortly defines general terminology as a liability, legal liability, conditions of liability and a classification of liability. Chapter Two refers to sources of law concerning the liability for defects. The analysis of the sources and the reciprocal relation between the main statutes - Civil Code and Commercial Code - and its particular provisions is very important for the comprehension of the topic. Chapter Three examines the differences between various types of legal liability. There is a brief description of liability <b>for</b> <b>damages,</b> liability <b>for</b> <b>delay</b> and unjust enrichment. These instruments of law must be distinguished from liability for defects, as they are often confused. Chapter Four consists of six parts, which represent [...] ...|$|R

The Iranian government stated that Yanikian was paid in full, and the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal dismissed in 1985 the claims of Yanikian's attorneys citing the lack of jurisdiction over items of the claim.

Memories of the genocide lingered in his mind and visions of his dead brother haunted him for years. The Republic of Turkey's continual denial of the genocide remained a source of anguish and pain. Eventually, Yanikian, believing he had little left to live for, resolved to avenge the deaths of his family members and bring greater awareness to the genocide by organizing the assassination of the perpetrator country's agents, an act that took its cue from the example set by Soghomon Tehlirian fifty years earlier.|$|R

40|$|The {{topic of}} this thesis is {{liability}} for defects in business transactions, or using the terminology of the effective Civil Code, obligations from non-performance. Rights from non- performance {{are one of}} the most important legal instruments regarding liability, together with liability <b>for</b> <b>damage</b> and liability <b>for</b> <b>delay,</b> all arising from pecuniary contracts, mainly from purchase contracts and contracts for work. With respect to the elapsed recodification of civil law, obligations arising from non- performance are no longer subject to two codes (in Act No. 40 / 1964 Coll., Civil Code and in Act No. 513 / 1991 Coll., Commercial Code), they are now governed only by Act No. 89 / 2012 Coll., the effective Civil Code. Civil code and its provisions are therefore the main part of this thesis. Moreover, some parts of the thesis contain comparison of the effective Civil Code to the preceding legislation, i. e. the Commercial Code, and to some international treaties as well. The first chapter, which follows right after the preface, contains sources of this thesis. The second chapter deals with the concept of obligations arising from non-performance, compares them to other areas of civil law dealing with liability, and later deals with the concept of commercial obligation.

40|$|One of {{the main}} duties of the housing {{developer}} under the statutory sale and purchase agreement is to complete {{the construction of the}} house on time. Under the Malaysian housing law, the period of completion and handling over vacant possession for landed property is 24 months and for sub-divided building is 36 months. However in practice, very rare buyers get the keys to their houses on time. According to clause 20 (2) of Schedule G of the Housing Development (Control and Licensing) Act 1966, the buyer is entitled to claim <b>for</b> Liquidated Ascertained <b>Damages</b> (LAD) <b>for</b> the <b>delay</b> in completion. It is a statutory remedy to compensate the buyer for the failure of the developer to fulfill his obligation under the agreement to hand over vacant possession on a specific date.

40|$|Lending {{money to}} one another {{is one of the}} common {{transactions}} among people. The borrowed property is sometimes {{in the form of the}} very property itself, such as gold and rice, and sometimes in the form of currency, i. e., paper money. Given the inflation issue and the decrease in the economical value of money, the lenders undoubtedly do not take back their money with the same economical value that they have lent it to the borrower the year before. To compensate the damage and to prevent the loss incurred, some believe that from the beginning the exchange of money for gold or for other goods can be postulated as a condition for lending money. Others have suggested the "purchase power" as a basis for paying off one's debt. Yet, others due to the symbolic nature of paper money believe that the same amount of money that has been borrowed is to be paid back; and, finally, another group have set forth the inflation rate as the basis for calculation. In this article the above theories are dealt with and critically reviewed. The first and the second theories can be taken as suitable approaches. However, with respect to the nature of the loan contract which is based on risk (gharar), its philosophy which is rendering voluntary help and benevolence to the needy without expecting any benefits, and the lender's intention to acquire Divine pleasure and otherworldly reward, the third theory, i. e., the calculation of the inflation rate in lending paper money, would be in contradiction with the philosophy of loan. Paper money as being symbolic is also subject to more deliberation due to its credit value and has no application in paper money loan in view to the definition given for money; although, according to the advocates of this theory in order to compensate the decrease of the value of money a condition as to paying <b>for</b> the <b>damage</b> due to delay in payment can be stipulated in the loan contract, which is irrelevant to our discussion.

The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the relationship between the recurrence risk after hip HO excision in Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) and Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) patients and the preoperative extent of HO. Methodology/Principal Findings: A case control study including TBI or SCI patients following surgery for troublesome hip HO with (case, n = 19) or without (control, n = 76) recurrence. Matching criteria were: sex, pathology (SCI or TBI) and age at the time of surgery (+/ 24. 5 years). For each etiology (TBI and SCI), the residual cognitive and functional status (Garland classification), the preoperative extent (Brooker status), the modified radiological and functional status (GCG-BD classification), HO localization, side, mean age at the CNS <b>damage,</b> mean <b>delay</b> <b>for</b> the first HO surgery, and for the case series, the mean operative <b>delay</b> <b>for</b> recurrence after the first surgical intervention were noted.
