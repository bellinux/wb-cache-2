40|$|Differences in whole-genome {{expression}} patterns {{between the}} classical and El Tor biotypes of Vibrio cholerae O 1 were determined under conditions that induce virulence gene expression <b>in</b> the <b>classical</b> biotype. A total of 524 genes (13. 5 % of the genome) {{were found to}} be differentially expressed in the two biotypes. The expression of genes encoding proteins required for biofilm formation, chemotaxis, and transport of amino acids, peptides, and iron was higher in the El Tor biotype. These gene expression differences may contribute to the enhanced survival capacity of the El Tor biotype in environmental reservoirs. The expression of genes encoding virulence factors was higher <b>in</b> the <b>classical</b> than <b>in</b> the El Tor biotype. In addition, the vieSAB genes, which were originally identified as regulators of ctxA transcription, were expressed at a fivefold higher level <b>in</b> the <b>classical</b> biotype. We determined the VieA regulon in both biotypes by transcriptome comparison of wild-type and vieA deletion mutant strains. VieA predominantly regulates gene expression <b>in</b> the <b>classical</b> biotype; 401 genes (10. 3 % of the genome), including those encoding proteins required for virulence, exopolysaccharide biosynthesis, and flagellum production as well as those regulated by σE, are differentially expressed <b>in</b> the <b>classical</b> vieA deletion mutant. In contrast, only five genes were regulated by VieA in the El Tor biotype. A large fraction (20. 8 %) of the genes that are differentially expressed <b>in</b> the <b>classical</b> versus the El Tor biotype are controlled by VieA <b>in</b> the <b>classical</b> biotype. Thus, VieA is a major regulator of genes <b>in</b> the <b>classical</b> biotype under virulence gene-inducing conditions...|$|R

5|$|Since {{approximately}} 1850, clarinets {{have been}} nominally tuned according to twelve-tone equal temperament. Older clarinets were nominally tuned to meantone. A skilled performer can use {{his or her}} embouchure to considerably alter the tuning of individual notes or produce vibrato, a pulsating change of pitch often employed in jazz. Vibrato is rare <b>in</b> <b>classical</b> or concert band literature; however, certain clarinetists, such as Richard Stoltzman, use vibrato <b>in</b> <b>classical</b> music. Special fingerings {{may be used to}} play quarter tones and other microtonal intervals.|$|E
5|$|The {{morphology}} of Proto-Central-Semitic shows {{significant changes}} compared with Proto-Semitic, especially in its verbs, and {{is much like}} <b>in</b> <b>Classical</b> Arabic. Nouns in the singular were usually declined in three cases: /-u/ (nominative), /-a/ (accusative) or /-i/ (genitive). In some circumstances (but never in the construct state), nouns also took a final nasal after the case ending: nunation (final /-n/) occurred in some languages, mimation (final /-m/) in others. The original meaning of this marker is uncertain. <b>In</b> <b>Classical</b> Arabic, final /-n/ on nouns indicates indefiniteness and disappears when the noun is preceded by a definite article or otherwise becomes definite in meaning. In other languages, final /-n/ may be present whenever a noun {{is not in the}} construct state. Old Canaanite had mimation, of uncertain meaning, in an occurrence of the word urušalemim (Jerusalem) as given in an Egyptian transcription.|$|E

5|$|Ancient texts use ahimsa to mean non-injury, {{a broader}} concept than non-violence. Non-injury implies not killing others, {{as well as}} not hurting others mentally or verbally; it {{includes}} avoiding all violent means—including physical violence—anything that injures others. <b>In</b> <b>classical</b> Sanskrit literature of Hinduism, another word Adrohi is sometimes used instead of Ahimsa, {{as one of the}} cardinal virtues necessary for moral life.

5|$|As {{intriguing}} as geometric Newtonian gravity may be, its basis, classical mechanics, {{is merely}} a limiting case of (special) relativistic mechanics.
