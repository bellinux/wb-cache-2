We had an anti-Franco rally, which was a worthy cause. You could raise a question about how relevant it {{was likely to be}} in Columbia, Missouri, but it was in any case a worthy cause. We also planned a socialist picnic, which we spent quite a lot of time organizing. <b>Eventually,</b> <b>I</b> regret to say, the YPSL chapter, after much discussion, many debates and some downright quarrels, broke up over the socialist picnic. I thought that was rather discouraging.|$|E
500|$|An initial {{pilot of}} the show was ordered in 2003 by ITV, from {{production}} company FremantleMedia, and was commissioned by Claudia Rosencrantz, who was the controller of entertainment at ITV at the time. It was presented by Brian Conley, but was not broadcast; a series was not produced. Rosencrantz spoke of the pilot in 2011, [...] "I didn't believe {{people would like to}} see someone win a vast sum of money, with no skills at all involved. Second, gambling is not a spectator sport, you get an adrenaline rush from participating in it." [...] Richard Holloway, who worked with FremantleMedia at the time of producing the pilot, said, [...] "It was a novel idea, you could win a million pounds <b>eventually,</b> <b>I</b> was surprised it didn't go to series." [...] Rosencrantz left ITV in 2006, {{and there has been a}} significant turnover in staff since the pilot was originally put together.|$|E

[...] "The recordings were made so we could use them, then the tapes were destined for Michael 's private library. They have a real unguarded honesty to them." [...] Ortega stated that he had gotten the idea to use the rehearsal footage from Jackson's fans after his death: [...] "At first I got so many messages from fans around the world asking to see the shows, asking to see the footage and <b>eventually</b> <b>I</b> realized the journey wasn't over and we had to do this", and Ortega also stated that the film was made only for the Jackson fans: [...] " [...] is for the fans and the film will show the development and intentions of the show, and the concert as it moved closer to London." ...|$|E
500|$|Two {{months prior}} to her death, Alcorn sought out help on the social media website Reddit, asking users whether the {{treatment}} perpetrated by her parents was considered child abuse. There, she revealed that while her parents had never physically assaulted her, [...] "they always talked {{to me in a}} very derogatory tone" [...] and [...] "would say things like 'You'll never be a real girl' or 'What're you going to do, fuck boys?' or 'God's going to send you straight to hell'. These all made me feel awful about myself, I was Christian at the time so I thought that God hated me and that I didn't deserve to be alive."

500|$|In 1963 Waldron {{had a major}} {{breakdown}} caused by a heroin overdose. He recounted in 1998 {{that a lot of}} musicians in the 1950s and 1960s felt that taking drugs was necessary for career progression. The police assumed they were all doing it, according to Waldron: The police would stop the musicians and search us as we came out of the clubs after work. We had to turn our pockets inside out. After a while, the musicians thought ... well, if you have the name you might as well have the game. <b>Eventually,</b> <b>I</b> overdosed. I couldn't remember my own name. My hands were trembling, I couldn't play the piano. I needed shock treatments and a spinal tap to bring me back. [...] Waldron always felt that he had to return to playing, but this was a slow process. About a year after the overdose, his physical recovery was sufficient to allow him to start relearning his skills, which he did partly by listening to his own records. His recovery as a musician continued for another two years, as his speed of thought was still too slow over that period to allow genuine improvisation: [...] "I worked out my solos in advance and played what I had written out, until gradually all my faculties returned".|$|E

500|$|In December 2010, Murphy {{announced}} that the cast of Glee would be replaced {{at the end of}} the third season to coincide with their graduation. He said, [...] "Every year we're going to populate a new group. There's nothing more depressing than a high schooler with a bald spot." [...] He also revealed that some of the original cast would leave as early as 2012: [...] "I think you have to be true to the fact that here is a group of people who come and go in these teachers' lives." [...] Murphy stated in July 2011 that Colfer would be one of the actors leaving {{at the end of the}} third season, and Colfer commented on the report, saying, [...] "We had kind of known since the beginning, since we started the show, that these characters were going to grow up and they were going to graduate <b>eventually.</b> <b>I</b> don't think I thought it was going to happen so soon, necessarily, but I think we knew something like this was coming." [...] However, Falchuk later said that while Colfer, along with Lea Michele and Cory Monteith, would graduate at the end of the third season, their graduation does not mean that they will leave the show.

My heart was beating so fast. I'm a very bold person, so I ran down to the coach and said, 'Who is number 9?' I just had to have that guy. And he said, 'His name is Harry.' And then he told Harry that I had asked who he was. And Harry looked up at me, and I'll never forget it; it was love at first sight." [...] She recalls he was a playboy,"Harry was real popular and had tons of girlfriends, but <b>eventually</b> <b>I</b> got him, and we went steady for a year." [...] The reason for their break-up she says, [...] "Harry and I broke up because he started playing around. He started dating a girl named Theresa, and by the time he and I got back together, she had become pregnant. He felt he should marry her. I wish he had told me his decision himself, but he didn't. One morning I got on the bus to school, and my friend said, 'Did you hear that Theresa and Harry got married?' I had to go a full day without crying. At the end of the day, I cried it all out." ...|$|E
