In the implementation, accurate and efficient methods are developed especially for evaluation of the density matrix and treatment of boundaries between the scattering region and the leads. Equilibrium and nonequilibrium contributions in the density matrix are evaluated with very high precision by a contour integration with a continued fraction representation of the <b>Fermi-Dirac</b> <b>function</b> and by a simple quadratureon the real axis with a small imaginary part, respectively.

The efficiency of the implementation is demonstrated by rapid convergence properties of the density matrix.
