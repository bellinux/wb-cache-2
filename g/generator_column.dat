5000|$|... 99mTcO4 is {{advantageous}} for {{the synthesis}} {{of a variety of}} radiopharmaceuticals because Tc can adopt a number of oxidation states. [...] The oxidation state and coligands dictate the specificity of the radiopharmaceutical. The starting material Na99mTcO4, made available after elution from the <b>generator</b> <b>column,</b> as mentioned above, can be reduced in the presence of complexing ligands. Many different reducing agents can be used, but transition metal reductants are avoided because they compete with 99mTc for ligands. Oxalates, formates, hydroxylamine, and hydrazine are also avoided because they form complexes with the technetium. Electrochemical reduction is impractical.|$|E
50|$|Ideally, the {{synthesis}} of the desired radiopharmaceutical from 99mTcO4, a reducing agent, and desired ligands should occur in one container after elution, and the reaction must be performed in a solvent that can be injected intravenously, such as a saline solution. Kits are available that contain the reducing agent, usually tin(II) and ligands. These kits are sterile, pyrogen-free, easily purchased, and can be stored {{for long periods of}} time. The reaction with 99mTcO4 takes place directly after elution from the <b>generator</b> <b>column</b> and shortly before its intended use. A high organ specificity is important because the injected activity should accumulate in the organ under investigation, as there should be a high activity ratio of the target organ to nontarget organs. If there is a high activity in organs adjacent to the one under investigation, the image of the target organ can be obscured. Also, high organ specificity allows for the reduction of the injected activity, and thus the exposure to radiation, in the patient. The radiopharmaceutical must be kinetically inert, in that it must not change chemically in vivo en route to the target organ.|$|E

In this study, the solubility of C 60 was measured in mixtures of toluene-acetonitrile, toluene-ethanol, toluene-tetrahydrofuran, and acetonitrile-tetrahydrofuran and the solubility data were modeled using Wohl 2 ̆ 7 s equation. The estimated crystal energy term for C 60 in tetrahydrofuran was different than that in the other solvents indicating that C 60 may form solvates in tetrahydrofuran. ^ The log Kow of C 60 {{was measured to be}} 6. 67, and the toluene-water partition coefficient was measured at log Ktw = 8. 44. From these values and the respective solubilities of C 60 in water-saturated octanol and water-saturated toluene, C 602 ̆ 7 s aqueous solubility was calculated to be 7. 96 ng/L. Because it is widely known that clusters form in aqueous solutions upon mixing crystalline C 60 with water, this value can be regarded as the hypothetical solubility in water, as the activity of C 60 in water at this concentration will result in the more thermodynamically favorable clusters in which C 60 has a lower activity, resulting in an associated lower dissolved aqueous concentration of molecular C 60 at equilibrium. Additionally, solubility of C 60 was measured in mixtures of ethanol-water and tetrahydrofuran-water and modeled with Wohl 2 ̆ 7 s equation, to confirm the accuracy of the 2 ̆ 2 hypothetical 2 ̆ 2 solubility value. Results of a <b>generator</b> <b>column</b> experiment strongly support the notion that clusters form at aqueous concentrations below the solubility limit.

Further, {{there are a number}} of supply points, each with a certain assortment, and a number of vehicles of a given capacity, to be used for transport. The log truck scheduling problem consists of finding a set of minimal costs routes, one for each vehicle, such that the customers’ demands are satisfied without exceeding the supplies available at the supplies. Each route has to satisfy a number of constraints concerning time windows, truck capacity, timetable of the driver, lunch breaks, et cetera. The model used to describe the log truck scheduling problem is based on the route concept, and each variable, or column, represents one feasible route. Since the number of feasible routes is huge, we work only with restricted versions of this problem, which are similar to restricted master problems in a Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition scheme. We use three solution methods based on the column generation principle, together with a pool strategy which allows us to deal with the feasible routes outside the restricted master problem.

These values were higher than determined for polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polychlorinated naphthalenes (PCNs) having {{the same degree of}} chlorination. When plotted against the subcooled liquid vapor pressure on a log−log scale, KOA values for PCDD/Fs separated into two groupings. Group 1 (n = 5) defined as any PCDD/F not in group 2, and group 2 (n = 5) defined as any tetra- to hexachlorinated PCDD/F having 3 or 4 chlorine atoms in the 2, 3, 7, 8 substitution positions. Published retention time indices (RTI) were used to develop an expression for determining the KOA value for any PCDD/F at any temperature, i. e., log KOA = a‘ + b‘ (RTI). For group 1 : a‘ = 1672 /T − 2. 98 and b‘ = 0. 857 /T + 7 e- 5. For group 2 : a‘ = 986 /T + 0. 55 and b‘ = 1. 714 /T − 0. 0032. This was used to assess the soil−air equilibrium status of several PCDD/Fs (n = 17) using previously measured maximum and minimum congener-specific total (i. e., gas + particulate) air concentrations at a semirural location in the northwest U. K. and mean residues for rural soil. A KOA-based absorption model was used to predict the partitioning of PCDD/Fs to atmospheric particulate matter and to estimate gas-phase concentrations. For low air concentration events, the calculated soil/air fugacity ratio (fS/fAmin) was less than unity for most congeners but within a factor of 5 − 10 indicating that soil-to-air transfer may at least partially contribute to atmospheric burdens. When maximum air concentrations were used, all congeners were far-removed from soil−air equilibrium and fS/fAmax values were much less than unity, indicating net gas-phase deposition to soil. In summary then, unlike many other persistent organic pollutants (e. g., PCBs and OC pesticides) the net flux across the air−soil interface is still into the soil at the present time. This wide range in soil−air fugacity ratios is due to the complexity of PCDD/F atmospheric burdens that are influenced by a combination of primary and secondary emissions, superimposed by a seasonally dependent primary combustion signal (domestic burning) ...|$|E

If you are the author please contact PEARL Admin (pearladmin@plymouth. ac. uk) to discuss options. Unresolved complex mixtures (UCMs) of aromatic hydrocarbons {{have been found in}} a wide range of environmental matrices at high concentrations. However, limited consideration has been given to the potential detrimental effects of the accumulation of these compounds in the marine environment. In particular, there is a need to evaluate these compounds in the light of recent evidence that points to the long term effects of oil in the marine environment. The overall aim of this work was therefore to investigate unresolved complex mixtures of aromatic hydrocarbons in the marine environment with particular emphasis on assessment of toxicity, aqueous solubility and photodegradation behaviour. A previously established link between the reduced Scope for Growth (SFG) of mussels with the concentration of 2 - 3 ringed aromatic hydrocarbons in mussels from petroleum impacted sites was found also to correlate well with concentrations of aromatic hydrocarbon UCMs in mussel tissues found at the same sites. This suggests that aromatic hydrocarbon UCMs or components within may be responsible for the observed effects. To determine whether an aromatic hydrocarbon UCM was capable of eliciting a toxic response in mussels, a monoaromatic UCM was isolated from a Gullfaks (North Sea) produced crude oil. At the highest nominal aqueous concentration tested, mussel feeding rate was reduced by - 40 % in the 24 hour exposure period, during which the mussels accumulated a body burden similar to the body burden of monoaromatic UCM hydrocarbons in wild mussel populations, previously shown to exhibit reduced SFG. Recent studies of hydrocarbon UCM composition using chemical degradation methods have led to the proposition of alkylcyclohexyltetralins as `average' structures for some monoaromatic UCM hydrocarbons. The aromatic hydrocarbon 7 -cyclohexyl-lmethyltetralin was synthesised herein in good yield and purity. This compound reduced mussel feeding rate by 50 % during the 24 -hour exposure period. The aqueous solubility of a compound is an important physicochemical parameter that influences behaviour within the marine environment and is thought to be a limiting factor in the onset of measurable toxicological response. The aqueous solubilities of three `model' aromatic UCM hydrocarbons were determined in distilled water at 25 °C using a <b>generator</b> <b>column</b> set-up. The effects of salinity and temperature on aqueous solubility were also investigated. An aqueous solution comprising an aromatic UCM was also generated. Another influence on the fate of aromatic hydrocarbons in the environment is the action of sunlight (phototransformation). Therefore aqueous solutions of three model aromatic UCM hydrocarbons were exposed to light simulated under environmental conditions. The halflives of these compounds suggested that if these compounds are indeed representative of the aromatic UCM phototransformation may influence its fate in the marine environment. The results of this study have furthered knowledge on the environmental behaviour of unresolved aromatic hydrocarbons, and suggest that these compounds should be considered in the long term impacts of oil in the environment and also warrant further study.

40|$|Following {{release to}} the environment, crude oil becomes subject to {{weathering}} processes which remove the simple, volatile hydrocarbons leaving an unresolved complex mixture (UCM) comprising the more environmentally persistent components. Aromatic UCMs {{have been reported}} {{in a wide variety of}} environmental matrices. Recent studies indicate such material, particularly monoaromatic hydrocarbons, is sufficiently bioavailable to marine organisms (e. g. mussels) to elicit toxicological responses. However, little else is known about the environmental fate and composition of petroleum-derived aromatic UCMs. The overall aim of this work was to investigate aromatic UCMs with particular emphasis on their biodegradability, water solubility and composition. To assess persistence in the environment, an 'aromatic' UCM was isolated from Tia Juana Pesado crude oil (Venezuela) and this UCM exposed to the hydrocarbon degrading bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens (Texaco). Five synthesised alkylcyclohexyltetralins and an alkylcyclohexylnaphthalene, proposed previously as 'average' structures for some aromatic UCM components, were also exposed under the same conditions. After 50 days, biodegradation of the compounds had not exceeded 20 %, the most resistant (- 2 % biodegradation) being those with C 3 -C 5 alkyl chains. These latter results were comparable to those observed for the 'aromatic' UCM (- 2 %). Using North Sea oil or n-hexadecane as co-substrates, the synthetic compounds were also exposed to a natural consortium of bacteria to provide more environmentally realistic conditions. After 119 days the branched chain C 5 homologue (- 60 %) and the naphthalene (- 12 %) still remained, yet under these severe conditions the components of the North Sea crude oil co-substrate were extensively degraded with even the highly bioresistant pentacyclic hopanes exhibiting biodegradation. Aqueous solutions of an 'aromatic' and 'monoaromatic' UCM were produced (at 25 'C) using a <b>generator</b> <b>column</b> technique. These 'solubilised' UCM fractions may represent UCM hydrocarbons which are bioavailable, and which are most toxic to aquatic organisms. An altered UCM was clearly evident in the aqueous phase extracts, suggesting that many of the compounds in the original aromatic and monoaromatic UCMs exhibited similar physicochemical properties and mole fractions. However, higher molecular weight hydrocarbons were absent from the generated 'solutions', indicating a solubility cut-off point based predominantly on molecular weight. The molecular weight distribution differed significantly for the 'solubilised' aromatic and monoaromatic UCMs, indicating that Raoult's Law may describe a critical control in the dissolution of complex mixtures. Comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography-time of flight-mass spectrometry (GCxGC-ToF-MS) analysis was used to provide vastly increased separation power and characterisation of a water 'soluble' monoaromatic UCM. Over 1200 compounds were separated by the chromatography, of which about 500 had distinct mass spectra from the ToF-MS analysis. A detailed characterisation of some of these monoaromatic UCM hydrocarbons via comparison to mass spectra registered in the NIST library permitted the identities of over 100 monoaromatic UCM components to be inferred. Compounds identified include novel alkylated homologues of benzene, indene, indan, tetralin, biphenyl, diphenylmethane and tetrahydrophenanthrene. This study has shown that a UCM appeared to be comprised of the geochernically minor isomers and analogues of known major crude oil constituents. This finding is extremely important given that the narcotic toxicity of petroleum hydrocarbons is additive. As UCMs often account for a large proportion of crude oil mass, these persistent residues may also contribute significantly to the observed narcotic toxicity of crude oil.

40|$|Introduction: Newer {{applications}} of radiopharmaceuticals in nuclear medicine require pertechnetate of moderate to high radioactive concentration. Hence {{there is a}} need to develop simple procedures for the concentration of pertechnetate. In this paper the influence of the addition of ascorbic acid to the eluent saline solution on the 99 mTc elution yield is examined. Methods: Molybdenum- 99 produced by neutron activation of molybdenum [98 Mo(n,&gamma;) 99 Mo] in the research reactor of Tehran was converted to zirconium molybdate gel under controlled conditions. The resulting Zr 99 Mo granules were load in two glass columns (internal diameter of 15. 3 mm and length of 70 mm). Initially the 99 Mo activity of each column was measured in a dose calibrator and then calculated for the subsequent days using decay corrections. In order to study the influence of ascorbic acid in the elution efficiency of the generators following solvents used for the elutions: 8 ml of normal saline solution (0. 9 %) and 8 ml of saline containing 20 - 120 &micro;g ascorbic acid per ml. Eluted 99 mTc activity in each column was measured in a dose calibrator and the elution efficiency was calculated. The elution profile of 99 mTc was determined by collecting 2 ml volume fractions of eluates. Results: 99 mTc activity was measured for each column and the 99 mTc (measured) / 99 mTc (theoretical) ratio is determined as a yield. The elution yield for the column eluted with saline solution was 70 % but elution of the <b>generator</b> <b>columns</b> with saline solution containing ascorbic acid increase in radioactive concentration of 99 mTc and its elution efficiency was obtained about 78 %. 99 Mo breakthrough percentage, the proportion of the total radioactivity in the eluate that is present as 99 Mo, molybdenum- 99 activity is measured by dose calibrator was about &lt; 0. 015 % for both columns. Conclusion: We have evaluated the influence of addition of ascorbic acid to the saline solution in an attempt to minimize the reduced yields observed after storage of 99 Mo/ 99 mTc generators. The results demonstrate that addition of ascorbic acid at low concentrations in the saline eluant was found to be an effective method of maintaining good 99 mTc yields. However, for a possible routine use of this procedure further investigations are needed. &nbsp...|$|R
