500|$|The album {{contains}} the singles [...] "If I Ruled the World", which features guest vocals from Lauryn Hill, and [...] "Street Dreams". Music critic J.R. Reynolds {{wrote that the}} former has Nas [...] "rapping his way to anarchy in an imagined world where <b>he</b> <b>kicks</b> discipline to the curb and good times rule." [...] In the song, he states that he would [...] "open every cell in Attica/send them to Africa". The latter is an account {{on the impact of}} drugs in Nas's neighborhood. The song contains smooth bass lines and frail drums, and it features an interpolation of the Eurythmics' [...] "Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)" [...] (1983). The album also features guest appearances from Mobb Deep and The Firm, a supergroup which was initially composed of Nas, AZ, Cormega and Foxy Brown. The group makes an appearance on the song [...] "Affirmative Action", a tale of robbery and three characters with mob connections.

500|$|Arnold Judas Rimmer Bsc Ssc ("Bronze {{swimming}} certificate" [...] and [...] "Silver swimming certificate"), {{played by}} Chris Barrie, was the second-lowest ranking {{member of the}} crew while they were all alive. He is a fussy, bureaucratic, neurotic coward who, by failing to replace a drive plate properly, is responsible for the Red Dwarf cadmium II accident that kills the entire crew (including himself). Nevertheless, Holly chose him to be the ship's one available hologram because he considered him the person most likely to keep Lister sane. From the Series III episode [...] "Timeslides" [...] onwards, the timeline of the crew is adjusted and Rimmer's death is newly attributed to a moment in which he hits a cardboard box filled with explosives. During Series VII, Rimmer leaves the dimension shared by his crewmates to become the new Ace Rimmer. Along with the Red Dwarf ship and its crew, Rimmer is resurrected at the start of Series VIII by nanobots. He comes face to face with Death {{at the end of the}} series, whom <b>he</b> <b>kicks</b> in the groin.

[...] During a charity camp-out, which has been organised by Scotty's girlfriend, Georgia (Saskia Hampele), Scotty visits Chris' tent and says something that makes Chris believe he is making a move on him. Mason commented that the storyline has [...] "a serious side" [...] because everyone believes Scotty is straight, especially his girlfriend. However, he added {{that there would be}} some funny moments in the lead up to the big revelation. Not long after the camp-out incident, Scotty lets his attraction to Chris get the better of him and he tries to kiss Chris. Uhlich explained [...] "There's no mistaking this as Scotty hitting on Chris. He's really put it out there now, but Chris doesn't go for it. So <b>he</b> <b>kicks</b> Scotty out of the house, but even then Scotty doesn't realise what the kiss means." [...] A shocked Chris then confides in his housemate, Kyle Canning (Chris Milligan), about the kiss and they decide that they need to tell Georgia about it. However, they soon learn that Scotty has proposed to Georgia and decide to remain silent to stop her from having her heart broken.|$|E

2500|$|The {{story is}} {{set against a}} {{historical}} background of ca 400 BC. In Syracuse, Chaereas falls {{madly in love with}} the supernaturally beautiful Callirhoe. [...] She is the daughter of Hermocrates, a hero of the Peloponnesian War and the most important political figure of Syracuse, thus setting the narrative in time and social milieu.

[...] They are married, but when her many disappointed suitors successfully conspire to trick Chaereas into thinking she is unfaithful, <b>he</b> <b>kicks</b> her so hard that she falls over as if dead. There is a funeral, and she is shut up in a tomb, but then it turns out she was only in a coma, and wakes up in time to scare the pirates who have opened the tomb to rob it; they recover quickly and take her to sell as a slave in Miletus, where her new master, Dionysius, falls in love with her and marries her, she being afraid to mention that she is already married (and pregnant by Chaereas).
