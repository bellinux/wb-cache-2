40|$|The UK economy {{continues}} to be depressed {{and is likely to}} remain so over the coming year. Preliminary estimates suggest that GDP fell in both the final quarter of 1978 and the first of 1979, and this pattern is likely to have persisted into the second quarter of this year. Indicators in the early months of 1979 were distorted by widespread industrial action, accounting in part for the 1 % drop in GDP during the first quarter. However, though industrial production subsequently recovered rapidly, the level for the quarter as a whole remained below the average 1978 level, suggesting a zero or even negative underlying rate of growth. Recent <b>falls</b> <b>in</b> <b>registered</b> unemployment are therefore unlikely to be maintained and will probably be reversed given the conjunction of deflationary forces which the UK economy faces...|$|R
40|$|The {{disincentive}} {{effects of}} social assistance programs on registered employment are a first order policy concern in developing countries. Means tests determine eligibility {{with respect to}} some income threshold, and governments can only verify earnings from registered employment. The loss of benefit at some level of formal earnings is an implicit tax that results in a strong disincentive for formal employment. We study an income-tested program in Uruguay and extend previous literature by developing an anatomy of the behavioral responses to this program. Our identification strategy {{is based on a}} sharp discontinuity in the program's eligibility rule and uses information from the program's records, social security administration data, and a follow-up survey. First, we establish that beneficiaries respond to the program's incentives by reducing their levels of registered employment by about 8 percentage points. Second, we find the program induces a larger reduction of formal employment for individuals with a medium probability to be a registered employee, suggesting some form of segmentation 2 ̆ 013 those with a low propensity to work formally do not respond to the financial incentives of the program. Third, we find evidence that the <b>fall</b> <b>in</b> <b>registered</b> employment is due to a larger extent to an increase in unregistered employment, {{and to a lesser extent}} to a shift towards non-employment. Fourth, we find an elasticity of participation <b>in</b> <b>registered</b> employment of about 1. 7, implying a deadweight loss from the behavioral responses to the program of about 3. 2...|$|R

40|$|This report {{presents}} {{information on}} drug-related deaths, both of addicts and non–addicts, {{that occurred during}} 2011 and for which coronial inquests and similar formal investigations have been completed. Its main purpose is to provide an analytical summary of data received and provide high-quality and consistent surveillance, and to detect and identify emerging trends and issues in respect of this phenomenon. In this way, it contributes to the reduction and prevention of drug-related deaths in the UK due to the misuse of both licit and illicit drugs. The findings show {{a decrease in the}} number of deaths in 2011 reported directly to np-SAD by Coroners from England, Wales, Northern Ireland and the Islands when compared to the number reported in last year’s report. Death notifications recorded by the Scottish Police also decreased. Part of the <b>fall</b> <b>in</b> Coroners’ notifications may be attributed to a slightly lower notification rate, and partly to a <b>fall</b> <b>in</b> actual fatalities. The latter would be in line with official statistics which showed a <b>fall</b> <b>in</b> deaths <b>registered</b> <b>in</b> 2011. As in the previous fifteen years, the statistics in this report are intended to inform authorities at the local, regional and national levels, as well as health professionals and the general public, about the serious consequences of drug abuse, especially polydrug use. The report also provides a number of indications of changes in patterns of drug abuse, trends over time, and emerging issues from our surveillance activities so that appropriate and timely action can be taken. This programme owes its existence to the commitment and dedication that Professor Ghodse demonstrated, and we can only hope and trust that this excellent work continues as a memorial to him...|$|R

40|$|Background A 2003 survey {{suggested}} {{the number of}} noncommercial trials in the UK was declining. Formation of the NIHR in 2006 and increased research spending by the Department of Health may have {{increased the number of}} noncommercial trials but no data are available. Methods Available data on UK noncommercial trials (were obtained from the two relevant registries: ISRCTN register for the UK, and US ClinicalTrials. gov. Data on each trial were sorted by start year, and compared with the: 2003 survey, and UKCRN portfolio database from 2007. Results The number of UK noncommercial trials registered rose from 25 in 1990 to 188 in 1999, peaked at 533 in 2003, and fell back to 334 in 2009. Total trials registered was similar to but slightly above those in the 2003 survey up to 1998, then rose sharply to 2002 before falling to 2007. From 2007 to 2009 the number registered to start each year was similar to but slightly above the UKCRN database. Less than 10 % of UK noncommercial trials registered with ClinGov for most years before 2005, but this rose to 35 % by 2009. Conclusions For the periods of overlap, trial registration data provide fairly similar totals to other sources on the number of noncommercial trials starting each year. The rise and <b>fall</b> <b>in</b> the number of trials registered between 1999 and 2007 was due to those <b>registered</b> <b>in</b> the ISRCTN database as funded by NHS Trusts. After 2007, the number of trials registered as funded by NHS Trusts has <b>fallen</b> <b>in</b> the ISRCTN <b>register</b> but these trials may have migrated to the US ClinGov register. The total number of noncommercial trial starts, excluding those funded by NHS Trusts, has been upward since around 2002. By 2009 the two main funders were NIHR and charities. Feasibility of using registration data to monitor the number of noncommercial trials has been demonstrated but is complicated by the use of two <b>registers</b> and difficulties <b>in</b> accessing the data. We recommend an annual report on the number of noncommercial trials registering each year...|$|R
40|$|Unique experiment, {{not only}} with respect to time, is ongoing within the two small {{watersheds}} in Beskid Mts. The year 2009 represents already the 56 -th year of this long-term forestry-hydrological research. Experimental watershed Červík (CE) is situated near the village Staré Hamry, watershed Malá Ráztoka (MR) near Trojanovice. The {{aim of the research}} is to study the impact of forest on the water runoff from the watershed, and the impact of forest management on water balance in the headwater regions. Compared to the long-term time series, the data measured in 2009 seems to be relatively balanced. In 2009 the year precipitation amount within two watersheds was only slightly higher than the long-term average.

40|$|Just {{before the}} global crisis soaring {{commodity}} prices pushed up inflation significantly, not least in EU neighbour countries at the Mediterranean. These price shocks affected public finances {{in the southern}} Mediterranean region, notably via government subsidies. Partly due to lags in the transmission of commodity prices into prices for final users the subsidies burden continued to be felt, despite the price <b>falls</b> <b>registered</b> <b>in</b> {{the wake of the}} credit crisis. We show that downward price rigidities play a role. Recently, commodity price pressures have re-emerged. We focus on food prices and analyse recent developments in food inflation in Algeria, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, the occupied Palestinian territories, Syria and Tunisia in comparison with other middle income economies. Subsidies on food and fuel are quantified per country for the period 2002 - 2010. The incremental government subsidies entail an estimated deterioration of the government balances of up to more than 2 % of GDP in 2008 and, for most countries only slight improvements in the global recession year 2009. Ensuing longer-term challenges for public finances remain as inflation rises on the back of higher global economic growth. As recent events in Tunisia and Egypt illustrate, these can have important political implications. Finally, the paper discusses some options that can lead to more efficient government spending, even in the event of sharp swings in prices of basic necessities. ...|$|R
