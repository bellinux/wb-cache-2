5|$|The {{northern}} {{entrance to}} the cave is flanked by two panels of Shiva dated to the Gupta period, both damaged. The left panel depicts Yogishvara (Shiva as the Lord of Yoga) and the right shows Nataraja (Shiva as the Lord of Dance). The Sadashiva is flanked by two large friezes, one of Ardhanarishvara and the other of Gangadhara. The walls of the mandapa feature other Shaivism legends. All the friezes, states Stella Kramrisch, feature the vyaktavyakta concept of Samkhya, where the state of spiritual existence transitions between the unmanifest-manifest, the figures leap {{out of the cave}} walls towards the spectator as <b>if</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> greet the narrative. Even the manifested Sadashiva is shown to be rising out of the rocks.|$|E
5|$|The Doctor {{explains}} that crossing the Void causes a traveller to become saturated in Void material. If {{he opens the}} breach and reverses it, anything saturated in Void material will be pulled in. Everyone except Jackie has crossed the breach and is thus vulnerable to being trapped in the Void, so the Doctor sends them all to the parallel universe. Rose decides she would rather be with the Doctor than her family and jumps back to help him. The Cybermen attempt to stop the Doctor but are repelled by a converted Ms. Hartman, who has resisted the effects of her conversion and at least partially retains her sense of self. The Doctor and Rose open the breach and hang on to magnetic clamps as the Cybermen and Daleks are pulled in. The Cult of Skaro use an emergency temporal shift to escape. Rose's lever slips, and in resetting it she loses her grip and plunges toward the Void. At the last second, Pete reappears and grabs her, and together they transport back to the parallel universe. The breach closes, leaving a devastated Rose trapped in the parallel universe. The devices used to travel between the two worlds have also stopped working. The Doctor presses his ear against the wall, as a tearful Rose does {{the same in the}} other universe, as <b>if</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> listen for each other.|$|E

25|$|The {{conventional}} color descriptions {{are traditional}} in astronomy, and represent colors {{relative to the}} mean color of an A-class star, which {{is considered to be}} white. The apparent color descriptions are what the observer would see <b>if</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> describe the stars under a dark sky without aid to the eye, or with binoculars. However, most stars in the sky, except the brightest ones, appear white or bluish white to the unaided eye because they are too dim for color vision to work. Red supergiants are cooler and redder than dwarfs of the same spectral type, and stars with particular spectral features such as carbon stars may be far redder than any black body.|$|E
25|$|A {{locomotive}} cut {{the car in}} half, killing {{my father}} instantly. When two brakemen jumped from the halted train, they saw a woman standing – dazed but erect – beside a mangled machine; with blood spouting (as the older said to me) out of her head. One of her hands (the younger added) kept feeling her dress, as <b>if</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> discover why it was wet. These men took my sixty-six year old mother by the arms and tried to lead her toward a nearby farmhouse; but she threw them off, strode straight to my father's body, and directed a group of scared spectators to cover him. When this had been done (and only then) she let them lead her away.|$|E
25|$|Using a {{transparent}} proxy has the unintended side effect, quite independent of IWF filtering, of appearing to websites connected to as originating from the proxy IP {{instead of the}} user's real IP. Some sites detect the user's IP and adjust their behaviour accordingly. For example, <b>if</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> download files from a file distribution website which restricts free-of-charge usage by enforcing a delay of typically 30 minutes between downloads, any attempt to download is interpreted as originating from the ISP's proxy rather than the user. The consequence is that if any user of that ISP has downloaded any file from the site in the last half-hour (which is very likely for a large ISP), the download is not allowed. This is an unintended consequence of ISP's use of proxy servers, not IWF filtering. File sharing sites distribute files of all types; for example Linux distribution files, which are very large. The use of proxy servers is also reported to have caused the problem with editing Wikipedia (but not the blocking of the actual offending web page) reported above.|$|E

500|$|B. marginata is {{generally}} {{fairly easy to}} grow in a well-drained sunny or part-shaded position in the garden. It can be leggy in shadier positions, or a more compact bushy shrub in full sun. Some varieties from drier areas seem to do poorly in areas of summer humidity. The flowers are not prominent unless they are numerous. Established plants can withstand drought, coastal exposure and temperatures as low as [...] Propagation of plants can be by seed or cuttings; the latter is essential <b>if</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> replicate plants of particular habit (such as dwarf specimens). Some Banksia marginata seed of subalpine provenance require stratification, namely keeping at [...] for 60 days before germination takes place over 6 to 25 days. Salkin proposed this was necessary so that seed released in a summer or autumn bushfire would lie dormant over the winter months before germinating in the spring. Banksia saxicola and [...] Banksia canei seed also share this trait.|$|E
2500|$|Play {{continues}} {{until one}} of the players has played all the dominoes in his or her hand, calls [...] "Out!", [...] "I win", or [...] "Domino!" [...] and wins the hand, or until all players are blocked and no legal plays remain. This is sometimes referred to as locked down or sewed up. In a common version of the game, the next player after the block picks up all the dominoes in the bone yard as <b>if</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> find a (nonexistent) match. If all the players are blocked, or locked out, the player with the lowest hand (pip count) wins. In team play, the team with the lowest individual hand wins. In the case of a tie, the first of tied players or the first team in the play rotation wins.|$|E

2500|$|Xavier Thaxton, {{protagonist of}} Count Geiger's Blues: A Comedy (Tor Books, 1992), is {{the fine arts}} editor for a {{newspaper}} in the fictional Southern metropolis of Salonika (a satirical/alternate reality version of contemporary Atlanta) with a particularly low opinion of pop culture. [...] When he is accidentally exposed to illegally dumped nuclear waste, the radiation exposure turns him into a superhero (or, as Bishop has designated, a [...] "stalwart"). Analog reviewer Tom Easton writes about the novel's resolution: [...] "This is where Bishop falters. The satire he has painstakingly [...] created now teeters {{on the brink of}} farce. He quite properly makes the decision to yank it back from that brink, but then he loses the satire. [...] He becomes heavy-handed and obvious." [...] Faren Miller disagrees: [...] "The most ambitious comic books are no longer merely comic – may even incorporate tragedy in a critique of modern life as savage and acute, in its way, as the ferocious satire of Dante's Inferno. Count Geiger's Blues also goes beyond humor – well beyond, in its remarkable closing chapters. [...] But they build on all that has gone before. In unleashing a startling talent for comedy and a wide-ranging knowledge of pop culture in both its absurdity and its splendor, Michael Bishop has written his best book yet." [...] John Kessel writes [...] "Comedy is certainly a new tone from Bishop, and he demonstrates a talent for it…But it seems to me Bishop doesn't really want to write comedy. It's as if Bishop is running riffs on whatever wacky ideas come to hand, without much plan, holding his characters at arm's length; as <b>if,</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> avoid sententiousness, he has to avoid caring – but in the end can't.

50|$|The game is an {{interesting}} application of Game theory. As only the Sheriff is known, {{it is hard to}} know who has what role.

Others' role can be implied <b>if</b> they <b>try</b> <b>to</b> harm those who harmed the Sheriff.
