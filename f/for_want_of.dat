Wilhelm Furtwängler had accepted the orchestra's invitation to fill the post, but he was politically unacceptable to a section of the Philharmonic's audience because he continued to live and work in Germany under the Nazi government.

About fifteen minutes after this, Italia was hit on the starboard side underneath her fore main turrets, while Roma was hit on the same side somewhere between frames 100 and 108.

The flooding caused the inboard propellers to stop <b>for</b> <b>want</b> <b>of</b> power and started a large amount of arcing, which itself caused many electrical fires in the aft half of the ship.|$|E
