60|$|I {{am writing}} this in Major Hapgood's office--it is bright and pleasant, only the dust <b>here</b> <b>in</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>is</b> a great nuisance. Mother, your shirts do first rate--I am wearing them; the one I have on to-day suits me {{better than any}} I have ever yet had. I have not worn the thin coat {{the last week or}} so, as it has not been very hot lately. Mother, I think {{something}} of commencing a series of lectures and reading, etc., through different cities of the North, to supply myself with funds for my hospital and soldiers' visits, as I do not like to be beholden to the medium of others. I need a pretty large supply of money, etc., to do the good I would like to, and the work grows upon me, and fascinates me--it is the most affecting thing you ever see, the lots of poor sick and wounded young men that depend so much, in one word or another, upon my petting or soothing or feeding, sitting by them and feeding them their dinner or supper--some are quite helpless, some wounded in both arms--or giving some trifle (for a novelty or a change, it isn't for the value of it), or stopping a little while with them. Nobody will do but me--so, mother, I feel as though I would like to inaugurate a plan by which I could raise means on my own hook, and perhaps quite plenty too. Best love to you, dearest mother, and to sister Mat, and Jeff.|$|E
6000|$|Our Brooklyn people, {{not only}} from having so many {{hundreds}} of their own kith and kin, and almost everybody some friend or acquaintance, here in the clustering military hospitals of Washington, would doubtless be glad to get some account of these establishments, but also to satisfy that compound of benevolence and generosity which marks Brooklyn, I have sometimes thought, {{more than any other}} city in the world. A military hospital <b>here</b> <b>in</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>is</b> a little city by itself, and contains a larger population than most of the well-known country towns down in the Queens and Suffolk county portions of Long Island. I say one of the Government hospitals here is a little city in itself, and there are some fifty of these hospitals in the District of Columbia alone. In them are collected {{the tens of thousands of}} sick and wounded soldiers, the legacies of many a bloody battle and of the exposure of two years of camp life. I find these places full of significance. They have taken up my principal time and labor for some months past. Imagine a long, one-story wooden shed, like a short, wide ropewalk, well whitewashed; then cluster ten or a dozen of these together, with several smaller sheds and tents, and you have the soldiers' hospital as generally adopted here. It will contain perhaps six or seven hundred men, or perhaps a thousand, and occasionally more still. There is a regular staff and a sub-staff of big and little officials. Military etiquette is observed, and it is getting to become very stiff. I shall take occasion, before long, to show up some of this ill-fitting nonsense. The harvest is large, the gleaners few. Beginning at first with casual visits to these establishments to see some of the Brooklyn men, wounded or sick, here, I became by degrees more and more drawn in, until I have now been for many weeks quite a devotee to the business--a regular self-appointed missionary to these thousands and tens of thousands of wounded and sick young men here, left upon Government hands, many of them languishing, many of them dying. I am not connected with any society, but go on my own individual account, and to the work that appears to be called for. Almost every day, and frequently in the evenings, I visit, in this informal way, one after another of the wards of a hospital, and always find cases enough where I can be of service. Cases enough, do I say? Alas! there is, perhaps, not one ward or tent, out of the seven or eight hundred now hereabout filled with sick, in which I am sure I might not profitably devote every hour of my life to the abstract work of consolation and sustenance for its suffering inmates. And indeed, beyond that, a person feels that in some one of these crowded wards he would like to pick out two or three cases and devote himself wholly to them. Meanwhile, however, to do the best that is permitted, I go around, distributing myself and the contents of my pockets and haversack in infinitesimal quantities, with faith that nearly all of it will, somehow or other, fall on good ground. In many cases, where I find a soldier [...] "dead broke" [...] and pretty sick, I give half a tumbler of good jelly. I carry a good-sized jar to a ward, have it opened, get a spoon, and taking the head nurse in tow, I go around and distribute it to the most appropriate cases. To others I give an orange or an apple; to others some spiced fruits; to others a small quantity of pickles. Many want tobacco: I do not encourage any of the boys in its use, but where I find they crave it I supply them. I always carry some, cut up in small plugs, in my pocket. Then I have commissions: some New York or Connecticut, or other soldier, will be going home on sick leave, or perhaps discharged, and I must fit him out with good new undershirt, drawers, stockings, etc.|$|E

5000|$|In early 2014, Johnson {{criticized the}} ability of Congress to {{continue}} using pre-tax employer contributions {{to help pay for}} their medical care, rather than being subject to the full text of the Affordable Care Act {{that the rest of the}} nation must follow.

In July 2014, a court ruled that the Senator did not have standing and dismissed the case.

Here is the new address: George A. Bunnell, Jr. 3516 10 th Street N. W. Washington, D. C. 2. 		I am a little late in doing this, but {{thanks very much for the}} Christmas present.

From the weather we have <b>been</b> getting <b>here</b> <b>in</b> <b>Washington</b> I <b>am</b> going to have to use it again soon. 3. 		You have received many letters from other Bryant graduates saying that they had found no other schools with a service club like yours. I will echo their statements. I have met many fellows who have attended many different business schools and collegs [sic], and none of them have attended schools that have service clubs like Bryant’s. 4. 		A word of advice to those of you studying typing. Learn how to use carbon. If you ever have to do any work for the Army, Navy, or any governmental agency you will use carbon, carbon, and more carbon.
