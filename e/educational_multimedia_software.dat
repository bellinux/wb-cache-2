Methods: This is a quasi-experimental study. All medical students studying in the 2014 - 2015 academic year in AJA University of Medical Sciences who had taken the microbiology course were entered in the study. Students were divided randomly into two groups, control and trial (16 subjects in each). After designing and producing the <b>educational</b> <b>multimedia,</b> the trial group was trained in concepts of the microbiology course using <b>multimedia</b> <b>educational</b> <b>software</b> during 6 sessions over 6 continuous weeks. Finally, they were given post-test questions to determine the educational progress level among the students. Results: The mean ± standard deviation for pre-test and post-test in the trial group were 4. 44 ± 1. 99 and 12. 75 ± 1. 06, respectively, and {{in the control group}} they were 3. 75 ± 2. 32 and 9. 31 ± 1. 25, respectively. The results of the analysis of covariance between adjusted means of both groups for variable of learning show {{a significant difference between the}} two groups (F(29, 1) = 65. 69; P= 0. 001).
