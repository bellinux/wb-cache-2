Anthranilic acids are extremely sensitive <b>environmental</b> <b>probes,</b> and hold promise as general but selective agents for cancer-cell detection {{if they can}} be equipped with the appropriate targeting groups. The optical properties of a small library of N-isopropyl invariant anthranilic acids were investigated in methanol and chloroform. Points of variation included: fluoro, trifluoromethyl, or cyano substitution on the aromatic ring, and derivitization of the parent carboxylic acid as esters or secondary carboxamides. Phenylboronic acid conjugation at the carboxylic acid alongside un-, mono-, and dimethylated 2 -amino groups was also explored. The boron-containing anthranilic acids were also evaluated as sensitive fluorescent probes for cancer cells using laser scanning confocal microscopy. In general, the compounds produced blue fluorescence that was strongly influenced by substitution and environment. 4 -Trifluoromethyl and 4 -cyano esters proved to be the most sensitive <b>environmental</b> <b>probes</b> with quantum yields as large as 100 % in chloroform, and enhancements of up to 30 -fold on going from methanol to chloroform. Stokes shifts ranged from 63 to 120 nm, generally increasing with ortho-substitution and environmental polarity. It was demonstrated that phenylboronic acid conjugation was an attractive method for cancer cell detection via boronate ester formation with overexpressed glycoproteins (with no interference from normal, healthy cells), presumably due to favorable boron-sialic acid interactions.

Affinity selection was then carried out using intact, non-germinated ascospores. The binding of selected phage antibodies was monitored by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy.

Heat-induced aggregation of all mutants started at lower temperatures than for the wild type protein. All mutations decreased susceptibility of the N- and C-terminal parts of HspB 1 to chymotrypsinolysis. All mutants formed stable homooligomers with a slightly larger apparent molecular weight compared to the wild type protein. All mutations analyzed decreased or completely prevented phosphorylation-induced dissociation of HspB 1 oligomers. When mixed with HspB 6 and heated, all mutants yielded heterooligomers with apparent molecular weights close to ~ 400 kDa. Finally, the three HspB 1 mutants possessed lower chaperone-like activity towards model substrates (lysozyme, malate dehydrogenase and insulin) compared to the wild type protein, conversely the <b>environmental</b> <b>probe</b> bis-ANS yielded higher fluorescence with the mutants than with the wild type protein.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Mössbauer {{spectroscopy}} is {{the technique}} of recoil-free resonant emission and absorption of gamma rays. It {{has the advantage of}} being oblivious to all elements except the one under survey. In the case of materials formed on the earth’s surface, such as soils and clays, the only propitious element is Fe. Iron is the fourth most abundant element in the Earth’s crust, it is essential for life, and almost all environmental materials contain at least some Fe. It is also fortuitous that 57 Fe Mössbauer spectroscopy is among the most straightforward to operate. 57 Fe Mössbauer spectroscopy thus allows the characterization of iron speciation, and thereby of environmental conditions, over a wide range of concentrations, making it an extremely effective <b>environmental</b> <b>probe.</b> Straightforward as it may seem, Mössbauer spectroscopy nevertheless has many pitfalls. Besides problems arising from the basic physics, complications can arise among other causes from imperfect crystallinity (small particle size), non-stoichiometry, interparticle effects and isomorphous substitutions.

The HT site showed greater numbers of larvae and post-larvae than the IT site for both years, with the highest numbers of post-larvae observed at both sites during the warmer summer of 2006.

30|$|The natural {{environment}} {{is a good}} source of industrially useful strains. In our previous work we isolated from the <b>environmental</b> <b>probe</b> the new bacteria strains able to 1, 3 -PD from glycerol (Leja et al. 2011), which have a variety of industrial applications, such as chemical intermediates used in the manufacture of polymers, cosmetics, medicines and heterocyclic compounds (Kośmider et al. 2011). During that experiment we obtained Cl. bifermentans strains which were not known as 1, 3 -PD producers yet. It occurred that these isolates are also able to produce another industrially useful metabolite from glycerol, lactic acid (Myszka et al. 2012), which is widely used in the food, cosmetic, pharmaceutical, and chemical industries and has received increased attention for potential use as a monomer in the production of biodegradable poly (lactic acid) (Wee et al. 2006). In the existing literature there is no information that the species of Cl. bifermentans is able to lactic acid synthesis. Generally, the metabolite profile of the species of Cl. bifermentans is not investigated sufficiently as yet. Thus the present authors decided to investigate into lactic acid production by these species. Our work’s aim was to check whether or not a medium pH and a carbon source exert an influence on lactic acid production by Cl. bifermentans strains. Some scientists argued that Cl. bifermentans exhibit adaptability in extreme environmental conditions (Lauro et al. 2004) and that they are able to survive in extreme pH levels (Sengupta et al. 2011). Moreover, Gibbs (1964) stated that even incubation at pH 10.0 or pH 3.0 has no significant effects on the ability of spores of Cl. bifermentans to germinate and that the vegetative cells are able to survive in these extreme conditions. We decided thus to investigate changes in metabolite profiles depending on the pH level of a fermentative medium which includes radical values such as 3 or 13. It occurred that the decreasing of pH value to 8.0, 7.0, and 6.0 results in the increased yield of lactic acid production. The data presented in the existing literature confirms this observation: lactic acid production requires strict control of the pH, mostly at values between 6 and 8 (Kascak et al. 1996; Litchfield 1996; Hofvendahl & Hahn-Hägerdal 2000). For example, the optimal pH for lactic acid synthesis for Lactobacillus bulgaricus is 6.0 (Venkatesh et al. 1993) and for Lactobacillus casei is 6.5 (Panesar et al. 2010). Our isolates prefer pH 7 (KM 371 and KM 374) and 6 (KM 376).|$|E

In this work, we use absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy to characterize ultrasmall Si-np prepared through anodic etching and ultrasonic fractionation of a crystalline Si wafer. Their behavior is studied over time in 2 -propanol and during treatments with water, NaOH, HCl, and H 2 O 2. The observed population {{is divided into two}} types of material: bright species consisting of well-etched Si-np, - 1 nm in diameter, and dark species derived from partially etched or aggregated Si structures. The dark material is seen by its scattering in the 2 -propanol and water solutions and is largely removed via precipitation with the NaOH or HCl treatment. The bright material includes three distinct species with their respective emissions in the UV-B, UV-A, and hard-blue regions of the spectrum. The hard-blue PL is shown to have a simple pH dependence with a pK a - 3, providing an important insight into its chemical origin and signaling for possible application of Si-np as <b>environmental</b> <b>probes.</b> Our results offer some potential for tailoring the PL properties of ultrasmall Si-np through control of their surface chemistry. © 2005 American Chemical Society...|$|R

Also, a variety of manipulations are employed, such as temperature changes or varying connectivity in spatial microcosm networks.

However, due to the complexity of coastal ecosystems, few tools are available to determine the inter-relationships and rates of these events. It is only when all of the important variables are understood and computationally described that effective ecological risk analysis can be accomplished. Model packages already exist which describe and predict specific coastal processes and further refinement of subroutines and user-interfaces has some value; however the truly significant advances lie in synergistic integration of different codes. Predictive ecological risk analysis requires transport models predicting contaminant concentrations under a range of environmental scenarios and bioaccumulation and trophic-transfer models using keystone species (or critical groups) identified by models elucidating trophic structure. In an attempt to elucidate natural processes, or solve environmental problems, stable and radioisotope tracers have a number of advantages over conventional techniques. Stable isotope studies replace visual observations of prey-predator interactions with statistically interpretable chemical data. Radiotracers provide real time kinetic data on uptake and transfer of specific contaminants and environmental transport processes.

The clouds and regions in the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ, i. e. the inner 250 pc) of the MW are indistinguishable from high-redshift clouds and galaxies. The presently low star formation rate in the CMZ therefore implies that either (1) its gas represents the initial conditions for high-redshift starbursts or (2) some yet unidentified process consistently suppresses star formation over ≳ 108 [*]yr time-scales. We conclude that the MW contains large reservoirs of gas with properties directly comparable to most of the known range of star formation environments and is therefore an excellent template for studying star formation across cosmological time-scales...|$|R
40|$|Culture-dependent {{studies have}} implicated sulfur-oxidizing {{bacteria}} as the causative agents of acid mine drainage and concrete corrosion in sewers. Thiobacillus species {{are considered the}} major representatives of the acid-producing bacteria in these environments. Small-subunit rRNA genes {{from all of the}} Thiobacillus and Acidiphilium species catalogued by the Ribosomal Database Project were identified and used to design oligonucleotide DNA probes. Two oligonucleotide probes were synthesized to complement variable regions of 16 S rRNA in the following acidophilic bacteria: Thiobacillus ferrooxidans and T. thiooxidans (probe Thio 820) and members of the genus Acidiphilium (probe Acdp 821). Using 32 P radiolabels, probe specificity was characterized by hybridization dissociation temperature (Td) with membrane-immobilized RNA extracted from a suite of 21 strains representing three groups of bacteria. Fluorochrome-conjugated probes were evaluated for use with fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) at the experimentally determined Tds. FISH was used to identify and enumerate bacteria in laboratory reactors and <b>environmental</b> samples. <b>Probing</b> of laboratory reactors inoculated with a mixed culture of acidophilic bacteria validated the ability of the oligonucleotide probes to track specific cell numbers with time. Additionally, probing of sediments from an active acid mine drainage site in Colorado demonstrated the ability to identify numbers of active bacteria in natural environments that contain high concentrations of metals, associated precipitates, and other mineral debris...|$|R
40|$|AbstractMicrobial {{capsules}} {{are important}} for virulence, but their architecture and physical properties are poorly understood. The human pathogenic fungus Cryptococcus neoformans has a large polysaccharide capsule that is necessary for virulence and is the target of protective antibody responses. To study the C. neoformans capsule we developed what we believe is a new approach whereby we probed the capsular elastic properties by applying forces using polystyrene beads manipulated with optical tweezers. This method allowed us to determine the Young's modulus for the capsule in various conditions that affect capsule growth. The {{results indicate that the}} Young's modulus of the capsule decreases with its size and increases with the Ca 2 + concentration in solution. Also, capsular polysaccharide manifests an unexpected affinity for polystyrene beads, a property that may function in attachment to host cells and <b>environmental</b> structures. Bead <b>probing</b> with optical tweezers provides a new, nondestructive method that may have wide applicability for studying the effects of growth conditions, immune components, and drugs on capsular properties...|$|R
