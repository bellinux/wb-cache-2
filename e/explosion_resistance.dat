Kirov Factory produced 93 new mine sweeps and Factory No. 174 produced an additional 49. These disc mine sweeps (metal discs 700-900 mm in diameter with a thickness of 10-25 mm on a common axis; {{the weight of the}} whole construction was 1,800-3,000 kg) were issued to army field forces in February and March 1940. Despite low <b>explosion</b> <b>resistance</b> (the discs would bend after the first mine explosion), these mine sweeps were used successfully by the 35th tank brigade and tank battalions of the 8th Army during the Winter War.|$|E

In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the <b>explosion</b> <b>resistance</b> performance of perforated masonry walls strengthened with polyurethane, nine numerical models with different layer number and different strip width of polyurethane are established in this paper.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{results of}} development and experimental investigation of <b>explosion</b> <b>resistance</b> and destruction unit performance in multiple detonation of ammunition with an explosive weight up to 0. 7 kg of TNT. A preliminary evaluation of the <b>explosion</b> <b>resistance</b> was carried out using a model of <b>explosion</b> <b>resistance</b> localizer, represented as a thick-walled tube. As a result of explosive tests, the nature and characteristics of tube deformation under repeated explosions have been revealed. The findings allowed us to develop the first embodiment of the destruction unit with a turning non-separable heater and a two-layer localizer, which was heated by the induction field. The explosive life tests have revealed the following drawbacks: low resource localizer, jamming rotating mechanism {{in contact with the}} splinters, and impossible replacement of damaged localizer. In the second embodiment of the destruction unit a plate-assembled easychange localizer is mounted on the heater, and it is heated by heat transfer from the core. Tests have shown that, with such a placement, the uniform heating of the localizer is not reached. This leads to incomplete destruction of ammunition. Besides, because of the low strength of the pins connecting the plates, occurrs their rapid destruction. Taking into consideration the shortcomings of the previous two designs, the third option of the destruction unit with a replaceable localizer and induction heating of a localizer has been designed. A localizer material having high mechanical strength at high temperatures and good ferromagnetic properties has been selected. The paper offers an all-metal localizer design with the thickest wall at the bottom that is the most damageable. The paper has experimentally determined a critical deformation of the localizer when destroying the ammunition with varying weight of explosive and defined the heater and bump resource. As a result, the work proposes the destruction unit design, ensuring complete destruction of ammunition, high working life, and reliable protection of the explosion chamber walls from the hitting splinters. The destruction unit can be used to destroy a wide variety of weapons, including those containing toxic or explosive substances, as part of automated flow lines...|$|E
40|$|Multidrug {{resistant}} (MDR) Klebsiella pneumoniae is {{a common}} cause of nosocomial infections worldwide. Recent years have seen an <b>explosion</b> of <b>resistance</b> to extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs) and emergence of carbapenem resistance. Here, we examine 198 invasive K. pneumoniae isolates collected from over a decade in Kilifi County Hospital (KCH) in Kenya. We observe {{a significant increase in}} MDR K. pneumoniae isolates, particularly to third generation cephalosporins conferred by ESBLs. Using whole-genome sequences, we describe the population structure and the distribution of antimicrobial resistance genes within it. More than half of the isolates examined in this study were ESBL-positive, encoding CTX-M- 15, SHV- 2, SHV- 12 and SHV- 27, and 79 % were MDR conferring resistance to at least three antimicrobial classes. Although no isolates in our dataset were found to be resistant to carbapenems we did find a plasmid with the genetic architecture of a known New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase- 1 (NDM) -carrying plasmid in 25 isolates. In the absence of carbapenem use in KCH and because of the instability of the NDM- 1 gene in the plasmid, the NDM- 1 gene has been lost in these isolates. Our data suggests that isolates that encode NDM- 1 could be present in the population; should carbapenems be introduced as treatment in public hospitals in Kenya, resistance is likely to ensue rapidly...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This {{paper has}} {{examined}} the hardening effect and mechanism of explosive working on high-manganese steel. According to the experiment result, the surface hardness of high-manganese steel is improved greatly after explosive working and the hardened depth exceeds 40 mm. The surface hardness and hardened depth increase slightly, the tensile strength is improved and ductility is reduced after three times of explosion. Charpy impact test demonstrates that it has still high ductility, the fatigue performance isn’t inferior to that before the <b>explosion,</b> the abrasive <b>resistance</b> is higher than that before the explosion and macroscopic residual deformation is extremely small. Such changes are related with the internal stress and changes of metallographic structure after explosion. After explosion, the surface is at stress state and the metallographic structure still retains the single-phase austenite matrix; and it produces high-density dislocation, stacking fault, cross-slip, lattice torsion, twin-crystal and refinement of austenite crystal grains...|$|R

With the worldwide <b>explosion</b> of drug <b>resistance,</b> there is {{renewed interest in}} the investigation of alternate essential cellular processes, including bacterial central metabolic pathways, as a drug target space {{for the next generation of}} antibiotics. However, the validation of targets in central metabolism is more complex, as essentiality of such targets can be conditional and/or contextual. Bearing in mind our enhanced understanding of prokaryotic central metabolism, a key question arises: can central metabolism be bacteria’s Achilles' heel and a therapeutic target for the development of new classes of antibiotics? In this review, we draw lessons from oncology and attempt to address some of the open questions related to feasibility of targeting bacterial central metabolism as a strategy for developing new antibacterial drugs...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{summarizes}} {{the results of}} the development of special concrete intended for the <b>explosion</b> <b>resistance</b> applications, with the emphasis on minimal secondary fragments formation at the explosion. The fine-grained concrete matrix has been reinforced by various types of short dispersed fibers (metallic, mineral and polymer) of different sizes and by their combination and the effect of the fibre reinforcement on the physico-mechanical properties and blast resistance was observed. The concrete prism specimens have been subjected to the determination of mechanical parameters (compressive and flexural strength at quasi-static load). The blast tests were conducted on the slab specimens prepared from selected mixtures. The material characteristics and explosion test data have been used for numerical investigation, which defined the optimal wall composition and dimensions of the concrete element which should resist the explosion defined by type, size, weight and placement of the blast. In the next step the test elements resistance was verified by real explosion test...|$|E
30|$|For decades, {{previous}} studies have utilized fiber-reinforced composites at both material and structural levels to improve the blast and impact resistance of cement-based composite materials (Yamaguchi et al. 2011; Silva and Lu 2007; Ohkubo et al. 2008; Ha et al. 2011; Wu et al. 2009; Mosalam and Mosallam 2001; Razaqpur et al. 2007; Xie et al. 2014; Ohtsu et al. 2007; Lan et al. 2005; Soe et al. 2013; Nam et al. 2010; Kim et al. 2015; Li et al. 2016; Coughlin et al. 2010; Yoo et al. 2015; Kim et al. 2015; Yoo and Yoon 2016; Nam et al. 2016). Yamaguchi et al. (2011) reported that polyethylene fiber-reinforced concrete has superior blast resistance under contact explosions as compared with normal RC. Silva and Lu (2007) examined the blast resistance of RC slabs containing fiber-reinforced polymers (FRP). The fiber reinforcing was applied on one or both sides and subjected to a close-in blast test. The <b>explosion</b> <b>resistance</b> of RC slabs was improved by the inclusion of FRP, {{and the effect of}} reinforcement on both sides was found to have a larger effect than reinforcement of only one side. Ohkubo et al. (2008) used contact-blast testing to identify the reduction of spall due to applying a reinforcing carbon fiber sheet and an aramid fiber sheet on the back side of a concrete slab. Ha et al. (2011) also used a close-in blast test to evaluate the reduction of fracture of concrete panels due to reinforcement with CFRP and polyuria (PU). To control the destruction and suppressed cracking, it is necessary to review the blast resistance of the fiber-reinforced cementitious composites (FRCCs). Wu et al. (2009) evaluated the <b>explosion</b> <b>resistance</b> of slabs manufactured with both ultra-high performance fiber concrete (UHPFC) and reinforced ultra-high performance fiber concrete (RUHPFC). The blast resistance of the RUHPFC slab was good compared to the other concrete slabs in the close-in blast tests. However, there have been very limited studies on the local damage of FRCC panels with various blended fibers and comparison of their blast resistance to that of conventional concrete.|$|E
40|$|AbstractSize {{effect on}} {{explosion}} intensity of methane-air mixture in spherical vessels and pipes was studied in this paper. The experimental results suggested {{diameter of the}} spherical vessel, the length of connection pipes of single vessel {{and the length of}} connection pipes between two spherical vessels {{played a significant role in}} explosion intensity of methane-air mixture in spherical vessels and pipes. The maximum explosion pressure was almost constant, while the maximum rate of pressure rise decreased with an increasing diameter of the vessel. The maximum explosion pressure and the maximum rate of pressure rise in single vessel with connection pipes both decreased due to the increase of the length of connection pipes. There was a linear relationship between explosion intensity and the length. And the maximum explosion pressure and the maximum rate of pressure rise appeared at the end of connection pipes. For linked vessels, the explosion intensity in secondary vessel increased with an increasing length of connection pipes with linear relationships. The conclusions provided important references for safety design of explosion venting and <b>explosion</b> <b>resistance...</b>|$|E
40|$|Fiber Bragg grating (FBG) is {{an optical}} fiber sensor and is {{suitable}} for acoustic emission (AE) measurements of structures such as chemical plants that require water <b>resistance,</b> <b>explosion</b> proofing, and so forth, However, directionality {{has been a problem}} in conventional usage which glues the grating range of an FBG to the inspection surface. This study proposes a cylinder-FBG (C-FBG) sensor with the FBG glued to a cylindrical sensor holder. Effectiveness of the sensor was evaluated by characterizing directionality and frequency sensitivity of the sensor and by comparing the detected AE signals in a 3 -point bending test of a carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) laminate against a conventional wide-band piezoelectric AE sensor. The features of the detected signals were similar to the signals detected by the wide-band AE sensor. These results show {{that it is possible to}} produce a wide-band cylindrical sensor without the directionality limitations of the conventional usage of FBG...|$|R
40|$|A {{failure of}} the {{security}} system of a community leads to a socio-economic instability and consequently to {{the decline of the}} community. Nowadays like in the past, a protective design against man-made attacks is important, especially considering that the Free World is constantly prone to destabilization by terrorism. A protective construction should principally guarantee the maximum reasonable survivability of the occupants. If the prevention strategies of defense fail (e. g. intelligence and police activities), the design for blast offers the only possibility to limit the consequences of an <b>explosion.</b> The <b>resistance</b> of a generic structure subjected to a blast load is measured in terms of collapse resistance, defined as the exceeding of a performance limit. The collapse resistance can be assessed directly by applying the blast demand to the structure (un-decomposed approach) or by decomposing the collapse resistance (decomposed approach) in three components: the hazard mitigation, the local resistance, and the global resistance. In this Thesis the decomposed approach is preferred and methods for a quantitative assessment of the collapse resistance’s components are proposed and applied to case-study structures. Concerning the hazard mitigation, deterministic computational fluid dynamic simulations are carried out for assessing the influence of three crucial parameters determining the severity of the blast load due to the deflagration of a gas cloud. The fragility analysis is carried out in the framework of the performance-based blast engineering, in order to quantify the local resistance of both precast concrete cladding wall panels and steel built-up blast resistant doors. Furthermore detailed finite element simulations are carried out for investigating the behavior of concrete slabs and insulated panels subjected to far-field and close-in detonations respectively. Finally, the global resistance is investigated by two methods that take into account the consequences of extreme loads on structures, focusing on the influence that the loss of primary elements has on the structural load bearing capacity...|$|R
40|$|A brief {{review of}} the results {{obtained}} in recent research of underwater electrical wire explosions using microsecond and nanosecond generators is presented. It was shown {{that the increase in}} the rate of energy input into the exploding wire allows one to increase the wire temperature and amplitude of shock waves (SWs). Estimated energy deposition into Cu and Al wire material of up to 200 eV/atom was achieved. In microsecond time scale wire explosion, a good agreement was attained between the wire resistance calculated using the equation of state (EOS) and that obtained experimentally. Conversely, in nanosecond time scale wire <b>explosion,</b> the wire <b>resistance</b> of EOS was modified in order to fit experimental data. Analysis of the emitted radiation showed that black body approximation cannot be used to characterize exploding wire radiation. It was found that <= 24 % of the deposited energy is transferred into the water flow's mechanical energy. Also, it was shown that converging SWs formed by the explosion of cylindrical wire arrays can be used to achieve a pressure up to 250 kbar at the axis of implosion. Hydrodynamic simulations showed that with the use of relatively moderate pulsed power generators with stored energy of several hundred kilojoules, a pressure of several megabar can be achieved at the axis of implosion...|$|R
40|$|This paper summarises an {{evaluation}} of an existing Australian explosion research facility {{in order to examine}} its suitability for determining the <b>explosion</b> <b>resistance</b> of ventilation control devices (VCDs). A combination of computational fluid dynamics (to model the methane/air explosion through time and space), finite element analysis (to model the structure’s response to the pressure impulse) and measurements from full-scale tests were used in this study. Comparisons were made between the theoretically predicted, practically measured results and those found for the same designs tested at an established experimental mine, namely the Lake Lynn Experimental Mine (LLEM). This paper also summarises the results of a survey of current Australian coalmine ventilation practices.

40|$|Damage Tolerance of {{aircraft}} fuselage structures {{has a strong}} link to <b>explosion</b> <b>resistance.</b> Though accidental explosions can and do occur, intentional explosions are more common as the terrorist threat increases. Structural toughness is as welcome in these scenarios as it is under penetration of non contained engine debris. Guidelines in structural design for such conditions are obviously lacking along with knowledge of typical consequences. The EU-sponsored project VULCAN addresses blast and fire behaviour of civil fuselage structures (cabin) {{with the aim of}} achieving significant improvements. This paper deals with blast only. Characterisation and vulnerability of existing monolithic aluminium structures as well as modern laminated materials (Glare, CFRP). is undertaken in this four year program. It aims at understanding typical catastrophic failure behaviour on a dynamic materials and mechanical level and improving this through well-balanced design guidelines. A twofold approach is used, firmly building on a dedicated experimental program and validating and applying numerical simulation tools from there as well. A building block approach was conceived. First level dynamic behaviour is studied at simplified structural and materials level, addressing crack initiation and propagation. A second level introduces increasing complexities due to curvature, stringers frame (castellations) and joints. First test results from the first level are presented, concentrating on dynamic Glare prestressed panel behaviour under a special explosively generated instantaneous large crack. A comparison to a bursting pressurised cylinder as a simple model of a passengers cabin, is ongoing...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{dust explosion}} research conducted in an experimental mine {{and in a}} 20 -L laboratory chamber at the Pittsburgh Research Laboratory (PRL) of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). The primary purpose {{of this research is}} to improve safety in mining, but the data are also useful to other industries that manufacture, process, or use combustible dusts. Explosion characteristics such as the minimum explosible concentration and the rock dust inerting requirements were measured for various combustible dusts from the mining industries. These dusts included bituminous coats, gilsonite, oil shales, and sulfide ores. The full-scale tests were conducted in the Lake Lynn experimental mine of NIOSH. The mine tests were initiated by a methane-air explosion at the face (closed end) that both entrained and ignited the dust. The laboratory-scale tests were conducted in the 20 -L chamber using ignitors of various energies. One purpose of the laboratory and mine comparison is to determine the conditions under which the laboratory tests best simulate the full-scale tests. The results of this research showed relatively good agreement between the laboratory and the large-scale tests in determining explosion limits. Full-scale experiments in the experimental mine were also conducted to evaluate the <b>explosion</b> <b>resistance</b> characteristics of seals that are used to separate non-ventilated, inactive workings from active workings of a mine. Results of these explosion tests show significant increases in explosion overpressure due to added coal dust and indications of pressure piling...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Advanced {{researches}} {{on concrete}} are directed toward investigating {{the behavior of}} reinforced concrete structures in severe conditions such as those promoted by impact loads. Some particular structures (protective shelters, nuclear reactor containment, offshore structures, military structures, chemical or Energy production plant) may be subjected to loading at very high rate of stress or strain caused by impact of missiles or flying objects, also by vehicle collisions or impulses due to <b>explosions</b> and earthquakes. <b>Resistance</b> to impact loads is guaranteed by using cementitious materials having both high strength and ductility. In order to improve ductility cementitious mortars with Glass Reinforced Plastics (GRP) replacing partially the natural sand were manufactured. Moreover, glass fiber (GF) reinforced mortars were produced to enhance toughness. For this scope two types of glass fibers were used different in length and diameter. Since the use of GRP and GF don’t produce any increase in strength of the mortars Carbon Nanotubes were added in the cement matrix to enhance tensile strength of the cementitious composite.

40|$|The {{protection}} of buildings and infrastructure against highly dynamic load-ings caused by explosions requires a profound {{analysis of the}} dynamic struc-tural and material behavior. High speed recording devices are a valuable in-strumentation to support the respective studies. The present chapter gives dif-ferent examples that {{emphasize the importance of}} high speed videos for the study of loadings, damage behavior of structures and the determination of dy-namic material parameters. One of the main threats for humans and buildings are flying fragments for example vehiclecomponents in case of a Vehicle Born Improvised Explosive Device. It is shown how the trajectory of such fragments can be calculated by tracing their launch conditions after an <b>explosion.</b> At the <b>resistance</b> side material parameters can differ significantly under highly dynamic conditions. Split-Hopkinson bar tests are often used to deter-mine dynamic parameters of brittle materials. For the determination of the fracture energy the experimental analysis requires a high speed video to eval-uate the velocity of the specimen´s fragments. The respective coherences are explained. Furthermore, the design of members and the whole structure is based on the knowledge about their resistance behavior to extreme loadings like blast. Capturing the initiation and the propagation of a fracture process by high speed videos therefore is essential.

40|$|In 1875, 7 {{years prior}} to the {{description}} of the Koch bacillus, Klebs visualized the first Streptococcus pneumoniae in a pleural fluid. Since then, this organism has played a determinant role in biomedical science. From a biological point of view, it was largely implicated in the development of passive and active immunization by serotherapy and vaccination, respectively. Genetic transformation was also first observed in S. pneumoniae, leading to the discovery of DNA. From a clinical point of view, S. pneumoniae is still today a prime cause of otitis media in children and of pneumonia in all age groups, as well as a predominant cause of meningitis and bacteremia. In adults, bacteremia is still entailed with a mortality of over 25 %. Although S. pneumoniae remained very sensitive to penicillin for many years, penicillin-resistance has emerged and increased dramatically over the last 15 years. During this period of time, the frequency of penicillin-resistant isolates has increased from &lt; or = 1 % to frequencies varying from 20 to 60 % in geographic areas as diverse as South Africa, Spain, France, Hungary, Iceland, Alaska, and numerous regions of the United States and South America. In Switzerland, the current frequency of penicillin-resistant pneumococci ranges between 5 and &gt; or = 10 %. The increase in penicillin-resistant pneumococci correlates with the intensive use of beta-lactam antibiotics. The mechanism of resistance is not due to bacterial production of penicillinase, but to an alteration of the bacterial target of penicillin, the so-called penicillin-binding proteins. Resistance is subdivided into (i) inter mediate level resistance (minimal inhibitory concentration [MIC] of penicillin of 0. 1 - 1 mg/L) and (ii) high level resistance (MCI &gt; or = 2 mg/L). The clinical significance of intermediate resistance remains poorly defined. On the other hand, highly resistant strains were responsible for numerous therapeutical failures, especially in cases of meningitis. Antibiotics recommended against penicillin-resistant pneumococci include cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, imipenem and in some instances vancomycin. However, penicillin-resistant pneumococci tend to present cross-resistances to all the antibotics of the beta-lactam family and could even become resistant to the last resort drugs mentioned above. Thus, in conclusion, the <b>explosion</b> of <b>resistance</b> to penicillin in pneumococci is a ubiquitous phenomenon which must be fought against by (i) a strict utilization of antibiotics, (ii) the practice of microbiological sampling of infected foci before treatment, (iii) the systematic surveillance of resistance profiles of pneumococci against antibiotics and (iv) the adequate vaccination of populations at risk...|$|R
