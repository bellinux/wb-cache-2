First, the magnitude of aerosol indirect effect could be larger with the analysis of columnar <b>droplet</b> <b>sizes</b> than that derived from the cloud-top <b>droplet</b> <b>sizes,</b> since column-droplet size can account for the broader droplet spectra in the cloud layers.

The optical setup is straightforward, but the interpretation of the data is a problem when particle images overlap. We propose a new way to analyze the images.

25|$|One {{study found}} that during {{atomization}} biodiesel and its blends produced droplets were greater in diameter than the droplets produced by traditional petrodiesel. The smaller droplets were attributed to the lower viscosity and surface tension of traditional petrol. It was found that droplets at {{the periphery of the}} spray pattern were larger in diameter than the droplets at the center this was attributed to the faster pressure drop {{at the edge of the}} spray pattern; there was a proportional relationship between the <b>droplet</b> <b>size</b> and the distance from the injector tip. It was found that B100 had the greatest spray penetration, this was attributed to the greater density of B100. Having a greater <b>droplet</b> <b>size</b> can lead to; inefficiencies in the combustion, increased emissions, and decreased horse power. In another study it was found that there is a short injection delay when injecting biodiesel. This injection delay was attributed to the greater viscosity of Biodiesel. It was noted that the higher viscosity and the greater cetane rating of biodiesel over traditional petrodiesel lead to poor atomization, as well as mixture penetration with air during the ignition delay period. Another study noted that this ignition delay may aid in a decrease of NOx emission.|$|E

25|$|An {{increase}} in cloud droplet number {{due to the}} introduction of aerosol acts to reduce the cloud <b>droplet</b> <b>size,</b> as the same amount of water is divided between more droplets. This has the effect of suppressing precipitation, increasing the cloud lifetime, known as the cloud lifetime aerosol effect, second indirect effect or Albrecht effect. This has been observed as the suppression of drizzle in ship exhaust plume compared to ambient clouds, and inhibited precipitation in biomass burning plumes. This cloud lifetime effect is classified as a climate feedback (rather than a radiative forcing) by the IPCC due to the interdependence between it and the hydrological cycle. However, it has previously been classified as a negative radiative forcing.|$|E
25|$|Mayonnaise {{emulsions}} eventually break as the oil droplets coalesce, {{although the}} kinetics and the precise {{mechanisms by which}} the droplets coalesce are not fully understood. As samples of mayonnaise age, the size distribution of the oil droplets changed to produce fewer, larger droplets which eventually led to separation of the phases of the mayonnaise. The shift in <b>droplet</b> <b>size</b> could be measured either microscopically (through light or scanning electron micrographs) or by {{a decrease in the}} absorbance at 500nm. When mayonnaise is stored at elevated temperatures, increases in Brownian motion of the droplets, decrease in the viscosity of the continuous phase, and solubilization of the surfactants all contribute to the breakdown of the emulsion.|$|E

The average <b>droplets</b> <b>size</b> of clove oil nanoemulsion decreased {{with an increase in}} duty cycle; whereas pulsed ultrasound with proper intervals was more efficient than continuous ultrasonication.

500|$|Cumulus clouds can be {{composed}} of ice crystals, water droplets, supercooled water droplets, or a mixture of them. The water droplets form when water vapor condenses on the nuclei, and they may then coalesce into larger and larger droplets. In temperate regions, the cloud bases studied ranged from [...] above ground level. These clouds were normally above , and the concentration of droplets ranged from 23to 1300droplets per cubic centimeter (380to 21,300droplets per cubic inch). This data was taken from growing isolated cumulus clouds that were not precipitating. The droplets were very small, ranging down to around 5micrometers in diameter. Although smaller droplets may have been present, the measurements were not sensitive enough to detect them. The smallest droplets {{were found in the}} lower portions of the clouds, with the percentage of large droplets (around 20to 30micrometers) rising dramatically in the upper regions of the cloud. The <b>droplet</b> <b>size</b> distribution was slightly bimodal in nature, with peaks at the small and large droplet sizes and a slight trough in the intermediate size range. The skew was roughly neutral. Furthermore, large <b>droplet</b> <b>size</b> is roughly inversely proportional to the droplet concentration per unit volume of air. In places, cumulus clouds can have [...] "holes" [...] where there are no water droplets. These can occur when winds tear the cloud and incorporate the environmental air or when strong downdrafts evaporate the water.|$|E

Droplets in such configuration {{have been found to}} be distorted and not in perfect spherical shape from experimental results of our previous study. Droplet distortion is computed by Taylor-Analogy Breakup (TAB) distortion model.
