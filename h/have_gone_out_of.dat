25|$|Palestinians are {{barred from}} using Al-Shuhada Street, a {{principal}} commercial thoroughfare.″Those who still live on Shuhada Street can’t enter {{their own homes}} from the street. Some use the rooftops {{to go in and}} out, climbing from one roof to another before issuing into adjacent homes or alleys. Some have cut gaping holes in the walls connecting their homes to other (often deserted) houses and thus pass through these buildings until they can exit into a lane outside or up a flight of stairs to a passageway on top of the old casba market. According to a survey conducted by the human-rights organization B’Tselem in 2007, 42 per cent of the Palestinian population in the city center of Hebron (area H2)—some 1,014 families—have abandoned their homes and moved out, most of them to area H1, now under Palestinian control.″ As a result, about half the Arab shops in H2 <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> business since 1994.|$|E
25|$|There {{has been}} a {{revolution}} in the island's retail sector since the opening of the Confederation Bridge. Before 1997, big box stores were rare and mostly found in larger centres in the Maritimes such as Halifax, Moncton, or Saint John. Prince Edward Island had a larger number of smaller, family-owned retail stores than other provinces, with few shopping malls and less selection of consumer goods. The opening of the Confederation Bridge was viewed with concern by government and the retail sector alike, as many thought Islanders would use the quicker transportation connection to drive to Moncton for many large-item purchases. While there was a small {{increase in the number of}} off-Island shoppers, the provincial government established a program of encouraging big box retailers to establish in the province. This included the elimination of provincial sales tax on clothing and footwear, resulting in a plethora of chains such as Walmart, Sears, Future Shop, Staples, and The Home Depot building stores on the Island. However, many smaller locally owned stores <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> business. This is one of the more visible impacts since the opening of the Confederation Bridge.|$|E

25|$|Like {{many other}} codes of football, {{the way to}} score points is to score goals. In Australian Football, {{there are two types}} of scores: a goal and a behind. There are four posts at each end of the ground; the two middle (and taller) posts are the goal posts, and the two outer (and shorter) posts are the behind posts. The area between the goal posts is the goal; kicking the ball between these posts scores a goal which is worth six points. Kicking the ball between a goal and a behind post scores a behind, which {{constitutes}} a single point. A behind is also scored if the ball passes between the goal posts but has not been kicked by the attacking team (e.g., it comes off the hands of either team, or is kicked by the defending team), or if the ball hits or passes directly above the goal post. (If the ball hits the behind post, the ball is considered to <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> bounds.) A rushed behind (also worth one point) is scored when the defending team deliberately forces the ball between any of the posts. This may occur in pressure situations where a defender decides that it is safer to concede one point to the opposing team rather than risk a goal being scored.|$|E

500|$|Baroš {{moved to}} Premiership side Aston Villa {{for a fee}} of £6.5 million in August 2005, signing a {{four-year}} contract. He was given the number 10 shirt. Just ten minutes into his Aston Villa debut, he scored the only goal in his new team's league victory over Blackburn. [...] He {{played a crucial role}} in Villa's League Cup second round victory against Wycombe Wanderers in September. With Villa trailing 3–1 at half time, Baroš scored shortly after the beginning of the second half and won a penalty, which Gareth Barry converted. He also provided the cross for Barry's second goal of the game as Villa scored seven goals in the second half, resulting in a final score of 8–3, their biggest win in over 40 years. He set up the first Aston Villa goal in a November match against Sunderland in dubious circumstances; back-heeling the ball, which [...] "looked to <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> play" [...] to Aaron Hughes. Hughes' pass found Kevin Phillips, who opened the scoring against his old club. He later scored a goal himself in the same game, which ended 3–1 to Villa.|$|E
500|$|The film {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} in trade publications. The Moving Picture World remarked that the play itself was not well-known, {{but that the}} plot was depicted adequately enough that it may encourage a re-perusal of the play. There was no fault found by the reviewer who stated, [...] "The characters of Hardcastle, Kate and Marlow are admirably done and seem to correctly interpret the original. The staging and costuming are {{in harmony with the}} play and reproduce the scenery of the time depicted with accuracy. The usefulness of a work of this sort does not end with the presentation of the play itself. There is an educational value which includes the costuming and reproduction of the surroundings of the time. These are so unfamiliar now that they afford not a little addition to the interest and pleasure of such a film. The work has been done so well that the company deserves commendation for undertaking the task. It is not an easy manner to reproduce a play of this character, and when it is well done the company performing it deserves praise." [...] The New York Dramatic Mirror disagreed on almost all points, [...] "In numerous details the illusion is dispelled, for the scenery is manifestly not of the eighteenth century. No contemporary of Goldsmith ever rode in such a barouche as appears in this film, nor lived in such a house as Mr. Hardcastle. The final tableau is as artificial as set pieces which <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> style at funerals. With all of its imperfections there is considerable of virile comedy in the film." [...] Though the Mirror reviewer stated that despite the elimination of the Hastings and Constance Neville subplot, the acting is clear enough that audiences do not need prior knowledge of the play to appreciate the film.|$|E
