The effect is the strongest at B ≃ 1 kG, where the magnetoresistivity develops a minimum emerging at T ≲ 2 K. Unlike the zero-field resistivity which saturates at T ≃ 2 K, the resistivity at this minimum continues to drop at an accelerated rate to much lower temperatures and becomes several times smaller than the zero-field resistivity.
