40|$|Excerpt] Supporters of {{comprehensive}} immigration reform have urged the President and Congress to pursue reform legislation. While legislative action on comprehensive reform does not appear likely during {{the remainder of the}} 1111 Congress, there are efforts to enact a measure, commonly referred to as the 2 ̆ 2 DREAM Act, 2 ̆ 2 to enable certain unauthorized alien students to legalize their status. On December 8, 2010, the House approved DREAM Act language as part of an unrelated bill, the Removal Clarification Act of 2010 (H. R. 5281). Unauthorized aliens in the United States are able to receive free public education through high school. They may experience difficulty obtaining higher education, however, for several reasons. Among these reasons is a provision enacted in 1996 that prohibits states from granting unauthorized aliens certain postsecondary educational benefits on the basis of state residence, unless equal benefits are made available to all U. S. citizens. This prohibition is commonly understood to apply to the granting of 2 ̆ 2 in-state 2 ̆ 2 residency status for tuition purposes. Unauthorized alien students also are not eligible for federal student financial aid. More broadly, as unauthorized aliens, they are not legally allowed to work and are subject to being removed from the country. Multiple bills have been introduced in recent Congresses to address the unauthorized student population. Most have proposed a two-prong approach of repealing the 1996 provision and enabling some unauthorized alien students to become U. S. legal permanent residents (LPRs) through an <b>immigration</b> <b>procedure</b> known as cancellation of removal. Bills proposing this type of relief for unauthorized students are commonly referred to as the DREAM Act. While there are other options for dealing with this population, this report deals exclusively with the DREAM Act approach in light of the widespread congressional interest in it. A number of stand-alone DREAM Act bills have been introduced in the 111 * Congress. Some of these bills (H. R. 1751, S. 729, S. 3827), like most DREAM Act bills introduced in prior Congresses, would repeal the 1996 provision and enable eligible unauthorized students to adjust to LPR status through a two-stage process. Other bills (H. R. 6327, H. R. 6497, S. 3962, S. 3963, S. 3992) would establish a two-stage adjustment of status mechanism for unauthorized students, but would not repeal the 1996 provision. The DREAM Act language approved by the House as part of H. R. 5281 is the same as in H. R. 6497. Under this version of the DREAM Act, aliens granted cancellation of removal would initially obtain conditional nonimmigrant status (as opposed to conditional permanent resident status, as under most other DREAM Act bills). To become LPRs, the aliens would need to meet additional requirements. This report will be updated as legislative developments occur...|$|E

40|$|The {{experiences}} that push {{people to leave}} their countries to seek asylum in foreign countries are stressful {{and in some cases}} traumatic. Unfortunately, in many countries, the <b>immigration</b> <b>procedure</b> that asylum seekers traverse to be officially recognised as refugees is complex and arduous. It may exacerbate their existing stress and re-traumatise them. In New Zealand, besides stress from the refugee status determination process, asylum seekers have less access to government funded resources than their counterparts, resettled refugees. Given this environment, the primary question addressed in this thesis is: what are the coping strategies used by asylum seekers to manage stress from the refugee status determination process? To address this question, I study a sample of asylum seekers from Sub-Saharan Africa in New Zealand using an explanatory mixed methods research approach. The mixed methods design consisted of two phases. In the first phase (quantitative), I used the Brief COPE scale (Carver, 1997) to collect data on the coping strategies of the asylum seekers. The objective of this phase was to assess and describe their major strategies of dealing with stress from the refugee status determination process. In the second phase (qualitative), I used semi-structured interviews to collect data on the experience of coping from a smaller number of asylum seekers selected from the quantitative sample. The objective of this phase was to describe their perceptions and experiences of the coping strategies assessed in the Brief COPE scale, and to investigate the appropriateness of the Brief COPE scale for Sub-Saharan African asylum seekers. Despite the stressful nature of the process, the asylum seekers tend to endorse more adaptive than maladaptive coping behaviours. Their levels of use of various coping behaviours differs significantly by the stage of their progress though their refugee claim process. Religion is a fundamental coping strategy for the sample, and self-blame is conceptualised in a different way from the Western worldview. The study also provides a new perspective on self-distraction as an adaptive coping. Lastly, the results indicate that the Brief COPE scale is appropriate for assessing coping behaviours in asylum seekers from Sub-Saharan Africa, although adaptation is recommended on two items - humour and self-distraction. The implications of the results to New Zealand and other destination countries for asylum seekers are far reaching. They indicate that asylum seekers are endowed with strengths, capabilities and resilience in spite of the challenges and vulnerabilities they experience. Thus, they could quickly and readily grow into becoming assets to the host countries with more timely interventions, opportunities and resources. Practitioners could tap into their strengths to support them more effectively. There is a need for research about strengths-based interventions in order to promote adaptive coping behaviours, and encourage change in order to decrease maladaptive coping behaviours...|$|E
40|$|Od 1892. do 1954. više od 12 milijuna imigranata 1 ušlo je u Sjedinjene Američke Države kroz poznata američka vrata, otok Ellis. Siromaštvo, glad, težak rad na polju i političke opresije natjerali su mnogo Hrvata da potraže bolji život u Americi. Većinom su bili vrlo mladi, prosjek godina tih prvih imigranata nije bio veći od 22. Uglavnom su bili muškarci samci, i zajedno su, sa svim ostalim putnicima iz potpalublja, prolazili brze medicinske preglede, tzv. "preglede u šest sekundi", za kojih su provjeravani simptomi zaraznih bolesti, mogućih psiholoških poremećaja, "ludila", "slaboumnosti" ili nekih fizičkih nedostataka. Ovaj članak pokušava propitati kako su takvi segregacijski postupci koji su odmah na ulasku u novi svijet definirali Hrvate kao potencijalno nezdrave, lude ili nesposobne, utjecali na stvaranje i razvoj hrvatske dijaspore u sjevernoj Americi i pridonijeli njihovu statusu dijasporske zajednice koja je sačuvala svoj kulturni identitet. From 1892 to 1954 {{more than}} 12 million {{immigrants}} entered the United States through its famous gateway, Ellis Island. They were processed through <b>immigration</b> <b>procedure</b> and majority of them, from that period, {{were allowed to}} enter the US and become the citizens of their choice. Poverty, scarcity and hard field labour forced many Croats to seek better life in America. Almost four millions of them went through the Ellis Island in the period from 1880 to 1930. Very young, of average age not more than 22, most of them single males, together with all other steerage passengers, underwent the quick medical examinations, "six seconds physicals" through which they were checked for signs of infectious diseases, insanity, "feeblemindedness" of physical defects. To avoid the trap of being too easily critical 100 years after Ellis Island happenings, {{it has to be}} said that they were a practical solution to immigration admission. The number of people entering the US through Ellis Island could reach 5000 up to 11000 people per day during America 2 ̆ 7 s peak immigration years from 1890 - 1924. However, Ellis Island practices legitimatized and deepened the division between the ethnically desirable (North and Western Europe immigrants) and less desirable (South-Eastern Europe and Asia). Furthermore, they provided a mass demonstration of power and political practices, which used health as an instrument of separation between those who were eligible to become the members of a politically stable, healthy labour force, and those who were not. This paper tries to examine in what way did such "segregatory" practices, which already {{at the entrance to the}} New World, defined Croats and other immigrants as possibly unhealthy, insane or inapt, influence the formation of Croatian Diaspora in North America as a culturally distinct ethnic group. It also raises the question as to how will the newly emerging medical borders affect notions of ethnicity and the ways in which dispersed/displaced peoples construct their identities in the time of "global ethnoscapes" (Appadurai) The fact that this first "legalized" segregation on the basis of a six-second medical examination was going on under the shadow of the Statue of Liberty, shows to what extent it was assumed as "scientifically" reasonable and politically correct, and explains the existence of its current practices of creating medical borders. Who remains on the other side of the medical border? The ethnical and cultural "Others", or, just "the ill"...|$|E
