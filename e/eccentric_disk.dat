The principal approximation in these models is that the disk stars travel in a Kepler potential, i. e., we neglect {{the mass of the}} disk relative to the black hole. We consider both ``aligned'' models, in which the <b>eccentric</b> <b>disk</b> lies in the plane of the large-scale M 31 disk, and ``non-aligned'' models, in which the orientation of the <b>eccentric</b> <b>disk</b> is fitted to the data.

In comparison with the best available ground-based spectroscopy, the models reproduce the asymmetric rotation curve, the peak height of the dispersion profile, and the qualitative behavior of the Gauss-Hermite coefficients h_ 3 and h_ 4. Aligned models fail to reproduce the observation that the surface brightness at P 1 is higher than at P 2 and yield significantly poorer fits to the kinematics; thus we favor non-aligned models.

The most famous example of an <b>eccentric</b> nuclear <b>disk</b> is the double nucleus of Andromeda, and there is strong evidence for many more in the local universe. Despite their apparent ubiquity however, a dynamical explanation for their longevity has remained a mystery: differential precession should wipe out large-scale apsidal-alignment on a short timescale.

The stabilizing mechanism drives oscillations of the eccentricity vectors of individual orbits, both in direction (about the mean body of the disk) and in magnitude. Combined with the negative eccentricity gradient, the eccentricity oscillations push some stars near the inner edge of the disk extremely close to the black hole, potentially leading to tidal disruption events. Order of magnitude calculations predict extremely high rates in recently-merged galaxies (∼ 0. 1 - 1 yr^- 1 gal^- 1). Unless the stellar disks are replenished, these rates should decrease with time as the disk depletes in mass.

40|$|The favored {{model for}} the nucleus of M 31 {{consists}} of an <b>eccentric</b> <b>disk</b> with an off-center density concentration. If the disk is in equilibrium, the requirement that it precess uniformly under self-gravity creates an observable feature in the rotation curve, which may be visible in current HST data. 1. Introduction Currently, the leading explanation for the double nucleus of M 31 (Lauer et al. 1993, 1998) is that the off-center brightness peak, P 1, is an equilibrium configuration, resulting from an accumulation of stars near the apocenters of their orbits in an <b>eccentric</b> <b>disk</b> (Tremaine 1995, hereafter T 95).

40|$|We {{present a}} {{calculation}} of the profiles of emission lines originating in a relativistic, <b>eccentric</b> <b>disk,</b> and show examples of the resulting model profiles. Our calculations are motivated {{by the fact that}} in about one­ quarter of the double-peaked emission lines observed in radio-loud active galactic nuclei (and in the mildly active nucleus of NGC 1097), the red peak is stronger than the blue peak, which is contrary to the prediction of relativistic, circular disk models. Using the <b>eccentric</b> <b>disk</b> model we fit some of the observed profiles that cannot be fitted with a circular disk model. We propose two possible scenarios for the formation of an <b>eccentric</b> <b>disk</b> in an active galactic nucleus: (a) tidal perturbation of the disk around a supermassive black hole by a smaller binary companion, and (b) formation of an elliptical disk from the debris resulting from the tidal disruption of a star by the central black hole. In the former case we show that the eccentricity can be long-lived {{because of the presence of}} the binary companion. In the latter case, although the inner parts of the disk may circularize quickly, we estimate that the outer parts will maintain their eccentricity for times much longer than the local viscous time. If any of the observed double-peaked emission lines do indeed arise in an <b>eccentric</b> <b>disk,</b> their profiles are likely to vary due to precession of the disk, thus providing a means of testing our proposed scenario. We estimate that for a black hole with a mass of order 10 6 Mʘ, the precision period due to general relativistic advance of the pericenter can be as short as a decade. However, for a black hole with a mass of the order of 10 8 Mʘ the precession period is of the order of a few centuries, be it due to general relativistic effects or due to the tidal effects of a binary companion. We suggest that it may nevertheless be possible to detect profile variability on much shorter timescales by comparing the evolution of the line profile with detailed model predictions. We argue that line-profile variability may also be the most promising dis­ criminant among competing models for the origin of asymmetric, double-peaked emission lines...|$|E

We compare with hydrodynamic simulations of such disks around a super-massive BH, with star formation, gas cooling, and feedback.

If the M 31 double nucleus is an <b>eccentric</b> <b>disk</b> with an off-center density concentration, as suggested by Tremaine, then the self-gravity of the disk can produce just such a disturbance. The expected kinematic signature is calculated approximately by examining sequences of closed periodic orbits in a Kepler potential perturbed by a model disk potential that precesses at constant frequency. The perturbation forces a steep negative eccentricity gradient in the sequence of closed orbits through the densest part of the disk, which reverses the arrangement of periapsis and apoapsis {{with respect to the}} central mass. Stars making up the inner part of the density concentration are at apoapsis, while stars making up the outer part are at periapsis, producing a steep local velocity gradient.

40|$|In {{order to}} be in a {{long-lived}} configuration, the density in a fluid disk should be constant along streamlines to prevent compressional (PdV) work from being done cyclically around every orbit. In a pure Kepler potential, flow along aligned, elliptical streamlines of constant eccentricity will satisfy this condition. For most density profiles, differential precession driven by the pressure gradient will destroy the alignment; however, in the razor-thin approximation there is a family of simple equilibria in which the precession frequency is the same at all radii. These disks may therefore be long-lived at significant eccentricities. The density can be made axisymmetric as r → 0, while maintaining the precession rate, by relaxing the requirement of constancy along streamlines in an arbitrarily small transition region near the center. In the limit of small eccentricity, the models can be seen as acoustically perturbed axisymmetric disks, and the precession rate is shown to agree with linear theory. The perturbation is a traveling wave similar to an ocean wave, with the fluid rising and falling epicyclically in the gravitational field of the central mass.

40|$|Context. Imaging {{of debris}} disks has found {{evidence}} for both eccentric and offset disks. One {{hypothesis is that}} they provide evidence for massive perturbers, for example, planets or binary companions, which sculpt the observed structures. One such disk was recently observed in the far-IR by the Herschel Space Observatory around Zeta 2 Reticuli. In contrast with previously reported systems, the disk is significantly eccentric, and the system is several Gyr old. Aims. We aim to investigate the long-term evolution of eccentric structures in debris disks caused by a perturber on an eccentric orbit around the star. We hypothesise that the observed <b>eccentric</b> <b>disk</b> around Zeta 2 Reticuli might be evidence of such a scenario. If so, {{we are able to}} constrain the mass and orbit of a potential perturber, either a giant planet or a binary companion. Methods. Analytical techniques were used to predict the effects of a perturber on a debris disk. Numerical N-body simulations were used to verify these results and further investigate the observable structures that may be produced by eccentric perturbers. The long-term evolution of the disk geometry was examined, with particular application to the Zeta 2 Reticuli system. In addition, synthetic images of the disk were produced for direct comparison with Herschel observations. Results. We show that an eccentric companion can produce both the observed offsets and eccentric disks. These effects are not immediate, and we characterise the timescale required for the disk to develop to an eccentric state (and any spirals to vanish). For Zeta 2 Reticuli, we derive limits on the mass and orbit of the companion required to produce the observations. Synthetic images show that the pattern observed around Zeta 2 Reticuli can be produced by an <b>eccentric</b> <b>disk</b> seen close to edge-on, and allow us to bring additional constraints on the disk parameters of our model (disk flux and extent). Conclusions. We conclude that eccentric planets or stellar companions can induce long-lived eccentric structures in debris disks. Observations of such eccentric structures thus provide potential evidence of the presence of such a companion in a planetary system. We considered the specific example of Zeta 2 Reticuli, whose observed <b>eccentric</b> <b>disk</b> can be explained by a distant companion (at tens of AU) on an eccentric orbit (ep greater than approx. 0. 3) ...|$|E
40|$|Detections {{of planets}} in eccentric, close (separations of 20 AU) binary {{systems such as}} α Cen or γ Cep provide an {{important}} test of planet formation theories. Gravitational perturbations from the companion are expected to excite high planetesimal eccentricities resulting in destruction, rather than growth, of objects with sizes of up to several hundred km in collisions of similar-size bodies. It was recently suggested that gravity of a massive axisymmetric gaseous disk in which planetesimals are embedded drives rapid precession of their orbits, suppressing eccentricity excitation. However, disks in binaries are themselves expected to be eccentric, leading to additional planetesimal excitation. Here we develop secular theory of eccentricity evolution for planetesimals perturbed by the gravity of an elliptical protoplanetary disk (neglecting gas drag) and the companion. For {{the first time we}} derive an expression for the disturbing function due to an <b>eccentric</b> <b>disk,</b> which can be used for a variety of other astrophysical problems. We obtain explicit analytical solutions for planetesimal eccentricity evolution and delineate four different regimes of dynamical excitation. We show that in systems with massive (> 10 ^- 2 M_Sun) disks, planetesimal eccentricity is usually determined by the gravity of the <b>eccentric</b> <b>disk</b> alone, and is comparable to the disk eccentricity. As a result, the latter imposes a lower limit on collisional velocities of solids, making their growth problematic. This fragmentation barrier can be removed if the gaseous disk rapidly precesses or if its own self-gravity is efficient at lowering disk eccentricity.

40|$|Context. Transition disks {{typically}} {{appear in}} resolved millimeter observations as giant dust rings surrounding their young host stars. More accurate observations with ALMA have shown {{several of these}} rings to be in fact asymmetric: they have lopsided shapes. It has been speculated that these rings act as dust traps, which would make them important laboratories for studying planet formation. It {{has been shown that}} an elongated giant vortex produced in a disk with a strong viscosity jump strikingly resembles the observed asymmetric rings. Aims. We aim to study a similar behavior for a disk in which a giant planet is embedded. However, a giant planet can induce two kinds of asymmetries: (1) a giant vortex, and (2) an <b>eccentric</b> <b>disk.</b> We studied under which conditions each of these can appear, and how one can observationally distinguish between them. This is important because only a vortex can trap particles both radially and azimuthally, while the eccentric ring can only trap particles in radial direction. Methods. We used the FARGO code to conduct the hydro-simulations. We set up a disk with an embedded giant planet and took a radial grid spanning from 0. 1 to 7 times the planet semi-major axis. We ran the simulations with various viscosity values and planet masses for 1000 planet orbits to allow a fully developed vortex or disk eccentricity. Afterwards, we compared the dust distribution in a vortex-holding disk with an <b>eccentric</b> <b>disk</b> using dust simulations. Results. We find that vorticity and eccentricity are distinguishable by looking at the azimuthal contrast of the dust density. While vortices, as particle traps, produce very pronounced azimuthal asymmetries, eccentric features are not able to accumulate millimeter dust particles in azimuthal direction, and therefore the asymmetries are expected to be modest...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} the dust velocity and spatial distribution in an <b>eccentric</b> protoplanetary <b>disk</b> under the secular gravitational perturbation of an embedded planet of about 5 Jupiter masses. We first employ the FARGO code {{to obtain the}} two-dimensional density and velocity profiles of the <b>eccentric</b> gas <b>disk</b> exterior to the gap opened up by the embedded planet in the quasi-steady state. We then apply the secular perturbation theory and incorporate the gas drag to estimate the dust velocity and density on the secular timescale. The dust-to-gas ratio of the unperturbed disk is simply assumed to be 0. 01. In our fiducial disk model with the planet at 5 AU, we find that 0. 01 cm- to 1 m-sized dust particles are well coupled to the gas. Consequently, the particles behave similarly to the gas and exhibit asymmetric dynamics {{as a result of}} eccentric orbits. The dust surface density is enhanced around the apocenter of the disk. However, for the case of a low-density gaseous disk (termed "transition disk" henceforth in this work) harboring the planet at 100 AU, the azimuthal distributions of dust of various sizes can deviate significantly. Overall, the asymmetric structure exhibits a phase correlation between the gas velocity fields and dust density distribution. Therefore, our study potentially provides a reality check as to whether an asymmetric disk gap detected at sub-millimeter and centimeter wavelengths is a signpost of a massive gas giant planet.

40|$|About 20 % of exoplanets {{discovered}} by radial velocity surveys reside in stellar binaries. To clarify their origin {{one has to}} understand the dynamics of planetesimals in protoplanetary disks within binaries. The standard description, accounting for only gas drag and gravity of the companion star has been challenged recently, as {{the gravity of the}} protoplanetary disk was shown to {{play a crucial role in}} planetesimal dynamics. An added complication is the tendency of protoplanetary disks in binaries to become eccentric, giving rise to additional excitation of planetesimal eccentricity. Here, for the first time, we analytically explore secular dynamics of planetesimals in binaries such as α Cen and γ Cep under the combined action of (1) gravity of the <b>eccentric</b> protoplanetary <b>disk,</b> (2) perturbations due to the (coplanar) eccentric companion, and (3) gas drag. We derive explicit solutions for the behavior of planetesimal eccentricity e_p in non-precessing disks (and in precessing disks in certain limits). We obtain the analytical form of the distribution of relative velocities of planetesimals, which is a key input for understanding their collisional evolution. Disk gravity strongly influences relative velocities and tends to push sizes of planetesimals colliding with comparable objects at the highest speed to small values, ∼ 1 km. We also find that planetesimals in <b>eccentric</b> protoplanetary <b>disks</b> apsidally aligned with the binary orbit collide at lower relative velocities than in mis-aligned disks. Our results highlight a decisive role that disk gravity plays in planetesimal dynamics in binaries. Comment: 18 pages, 9 figures, resubmitted after addressing ApJ referee repor...|$|R
40|$|Theories {{of planet}} {{formation}} predict {{the birth of}} giant planets in the inner, dense, and gas-rich regions of the circumstellar disks around young stars. These are the regions from which strong CO emission is expected. Observations have so far been unable to confirm the presence of planets caught in formation. We have developed a novel method to detect a giant planet still embedded in a circumstellar disk by the distortions of the CO molecular line profiles emerging from the protoplanetary disk's surface. The method {{is based on the}} fact that a giant planet significantly perturbs the gas velocity flow in addition to distorting the disk surface density. We have calculated the emerging molecular line profiles by combining hydrodynamical models with semianalytic radiative transfer calculations. Our results have shown that a giant Jupiter-like planet can be detected using contemporary or future high-resolution near-IR spectrographs such as VLT/CRIRES or ELT/METIS. We have also studied the effects of binarity on disk perturbations. The most interesting results have been found for <b>eccentric</b> circumprimary <b>disks</b> in mid-separation binaries, for which the disk eccentricity - detectable from the asymmetric line profiles - arises from the gravitational effects of the companion star. Our detailed simulations shed new light on how to constrain the disk kinematical state as well as its eccentricity profile. Recent findings by independent groups have shown that core-accretion is severely affected by disk eccentricity, hence detection of an <b>eccentric</b> protoplanetary <b>disk</b> in a young binary system would further constrain planet formation theories.
