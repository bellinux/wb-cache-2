40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{deals with}} a new site of {{dolomite}} formation in supratidal evaporite flats, at the southernmost edge of the Ojo de Liebre evaporitic omplex (Baja California, Mexico). The sedimentary context is mostly siliciclastic, except for calcareous outcrops around the flats. Both chemical and isotopic data on the <b>interstitial</b> <b>solutions</b> demonstrate a mixing between MgZ+-rich marine-derived brines and calcium bicarbonate-bearing continental waters, which are subjected to concentration by capillary evaporation. The lack of any in situ solid CaCO 3 in the sedimentary matrix argues for direct crystallization ofdolomite from aqueous olutions. This is documented by the oxygen isotope compositions of the dolomite which are consistent with deposition under equilibrium con-ditions of ambient emperature and ~t 60 of water of the <b>interstitial</b> <b>solutions.</b> Furthermore, the low fil 3 C values of the dolomites {{and the absence of}} living plants or organisms in the basin indicate that a fraction of the total dissolved inorganic arbon reservoir is biogenic and is mostly provided by continental groundwaters.

40|$|International audienceThis {{study focused}} on {{comparison}} of polysaccharide addition methods, either in powder form, or as a solute in the mixing water. The influence of the methods was assessed by measuring water retention and rheological properties with one cellulose ether and two guar ethers. Polysaccharides were more efficient to enhance water retention and rheological properties when they are pre-dissolved in the mixing water. This is related to differences in polymer concentration in the pore solution of mortar. These differences are not stemming from a difference in dissolution kinetics, but from a difference in adsorption on growing hydrates. Being immediately available when it is pre-dissolved, the admixture slows down the nucleation and growth of hydrates limiting in turn the surface area for further adsorption. Consequently, more molecules are left in the <b>interstitial</b> <b>solution</b> and a lower dosage is required to achieve the overlapping of polymer coils, responsible for the effectiveness of polysaccharides...|$|E
