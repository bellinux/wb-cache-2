5|$|Part IV {{of the act}} {{covers the}} <b>delegation</b> <b>of</b> <b>powers</b> to agents, and the {{trustees}} liability for their acts. This {{is an area that}} has long been criticised by practitioners and academics, particularly the provisions of the Trustee Act 1925. The Act allowed the trustees to appoint an agent in good faith, and gave them no liability for the agent's acts. In Re Vickery it was confirmed that a trustee may escape liability for an agent's acts if he acted in good faith, which was simply a test of honesty rather than reasonableness.|$|E

For instance, under the <b>Delegation</b> <b>of</b> <b>Powers</b> (Ministry of Law) (Consolidation) Notification, the Senior Minister of State for Law is deputed to exercise certain powers of the Minister for Law under the Copyright Act, Criminal Procedure Code, Land Acquisition Act, Land Surveyors Act, and Pawnbrokers Act; while the Parliamentary Secretary for Home Affairs is deputed the powers of the Minister for Home Affairs under regulation 157 of the Prisons Regulations pursuant to the <b>Delegation</b> <b>of</b> <b>Powers</b> (Ministry of Home Affairs) (Consolidation) Notification.|$|E

5000|$|... b. <b>Delegation</b> <b>of</b> <b>powers</b> is made {{necessary}} by {{the structure}} of the enterprise: only the decision-maker who cannot effectively assume his legal obligations can delegate his responsibilities to a third party. The mechanism of <b>delegation</b> <b>of</b> <b>powers</b> is not a means for the decision-maker to escape his criminal responsibility, but a mechanism to assure the effectiveness of legal limitations. It's when the scale or material organization of an enterprise do not allow a decision-maker to confront his obligations that delegation of power is authorized and even desirable. In the same spirit delegation cannot be general but must concern a precise sector of activity. This special character thedegation is strictly interpreted by judges.|$|E
