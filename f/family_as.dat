50|$|<b>Family</b> {{resilience}} emerged <b>as</b> scholars incorporated together {{ideas from}} general systems theory perspectives on families, family stress theory, and psychological resilience perspectives. Two prominent approaches to family resilience are to view <b>families</b> <b>as</b> contexts of individual resilience and <b>families</b> <b>as</b> systems. In {{the field of}} family therapy the <b>families</b> <b>as</b> systems approach to family resilience is often used {{based on the assumption}} that significant risk, protective mechanisms, and positive adaptation occur at multiple interrelated system levels (individual, subsystem, system, or ecosystem). Thus, family resilience involves the application of concepts such as resilience, adaptation and coping to a significant stressor or adversity from a family systems perspective.|$|R
