40|$|This paper {{examines}} the noncooperative interactions between two <b>exporting</b> <b>countries</b> and one im-porting country {{when all of}} them are seeking the optimal policies to improve their welfare. Whereas the importing country has the incentive to impose tariffs on the goods coming fi-om the two <b>exporting</b> <b>countries,</b> the <b>export</b> policies chosen by the <b>exporting</b> <b>countries</b> depend on the tariff regime, whether uniform or discriminatory tariffs are used. It is argued that export taxes are chosen by both <b>exporting</b> <b>countries</b> in some cases, and that whereas the importing country prefers a uniform tariff regime, the <b>exporting</b> <b>countries</b> find a discriminatory tariff regime preferable.

40|$|The paper {{explores the}} trade {{competitiveness}} of seven major shrimp <b>exporting</b> <b>countries,</b> namely Vietnam, China, Thailand, Ecuador, India, Indonesia and Mexico, to the USA. Specifically, we investigate whether the United States (US) antidumping petitions {{impact upon the}} bilateral revealed comparative advantage (RCA) indexes {{for each of the}} seven shrimp <b>exporting</b> <b>countries</b> with the USA. Monthly data from January 2003 to December 2014 and the panel data model are used to examine the determinants of the RCA for the shrimp <b>exporting</b> <b>countries.</b> The empirical results show the shrimp <b>exporting</b> <b>countries</b> have superior competitiveness against the shrimp market in the USA. Moreover, the RCA indexes are significantly negatively influenced by shrimp prices, and are positively affected by US income per capita. However, the EMS (Early Mortality Syndrome) shrimp disease, domestic US shrimp quantity, exchange rate, and US antidumping laws are found to have no significant impacts on the RCA indexes. In terms of policy implications, the USA should try to reduce production costs of shrimp in the US market instead of imposing antidumping petitions, and the shrimp <b>exporting</b> <b>countries</b> should maintain their comparative advantage and diversify into new markets...|$|R

In a successive international Cournot oligopoly, we analyse incentives for using tax instruments strategically to shift rents vertically, between <b>exporting</b> and importing <b>countries,</b> and horizontally, between <b>exporting</b> <b>countries.</b> We {{show that the}} equilibrium outcome depends crucially on the relative degree of competitiveness in the upstream and downstream parts of the industry. With respect to national welfare, a more competitive upstream industry may benefit an <b>exporting</b> (upstream) <b>country</b> and harm an importing (downstream) country.

40|$|Previous {{work has}} {{documented}} that oil price changes have nonlinear {{effects in the}} economy and in stock market returns. We show that the nonlinear effects are different depending on whether countries are energy dependent or not. While price soars seem to {{have a negative effect on}} the stock markets of oil energy dependent countries, they have a positive effect on the stock markets of oil <b>exporting</b> <b>countries.</b> Stock market returns are negatively affected by oil price volatility in energy dependent countries and positively in oil <b>exporting</b> <b>countries.</b> Moreover, we find bi-directional effects between oil price increases and some oil volatility measures that can be reinforced with volatility feedback. The asymmetric effects found in oil dependent and oil <b>exporting</b> <b>countries</b> seem to fit into the offset mechanism proposed in the literature where oil price shocks interact both with oil price volatility and the economy. The results are also consistent with the finding that oil <b>exporting</b> <b>countries</b> benefit economically from oil price hikes...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{empirical}} determinants of import demand in oil <b>exporting</b> <b>countries.</b> Using a new dataset including a large {{cross section of}} oil <b>exporting</b> <b>countries,</b> we show with a panel cointegration analysis that import demand in these countries depends positively on domestic demand and exports, the real exchange rate {{and the price of}} oil. Fiscal surpluses, on the other hand, tend to reduce the demand for imports. More specifically, our import elasticities estimated for oil <b>exporting</b> <b>countries</b> are not far from estimates found in the literature on industrial countries. In particular, we conclude that the import elasticity with respect to domestic activity is larger than one â€“ a finding which is in contrast to standard theoretical predictions but in line with most empirical findings for other countries. These results are robust over a wide set of alternative specifications. JEL Classification: F 14, F 01, Q 43 Import Equation, oil <b>exporting</b> <b>countries,</b> Panel Cointegration...|$|R
