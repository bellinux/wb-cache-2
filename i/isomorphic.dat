5|$|The medial graph {{of a plane}} graph is <b>isomorphic</b> to {{the medial}} graph of its dual. Two planar graphs can have <b>isomorphic</b> medial graphs {{only if they are}} dual to each other.|$|E
5|$|As Hilary Putnam writes, Von Neumann {{replaced}} {{classical logic}} with a logic constructed in orthomodular lattices (<b>isomorphic</b> to the lattice of subspaces of the Hilbert {{space of a}} given physical system).|$|E
5|$|Since πi−1(S1) vanishes for i {{at least}} 3, the first row shows that πi(S2) and πi(S3) are <b>isomorphic</b> {{whenever}} i is at least 3, as observed above.|$|E
5|$|Two {{irreducible}} representations are <b>isomorphic</b> if {{and only}} if they have the same highest weight.|$|E
5|$|Two {{protactinium}} oxides were obtained: PaO2 (black) and Pa2O5(white); {{the former}} is <b>isomorphic</b> with ThO2 and the latter is easier to obtain. Both oxides are basic, and Pa(OH)5 is a weak, poorly soluble base.|$|E
5|$|A nonzero scalar {{multiple}} of an identity matrix {{is called a}} scalar matrix. If the matrix entries come from a field, the scalar matrices form a group, under matrix multiplication, that is <b>isomorphic</b> to the multiplicative group of nonzero elements of the field.|$|E
5|$|Every finite {{group is}} <b>isomorphic</b> to a matrix group, {{as one can}} see by {{considering}} the regular representation of the symmetric group. General groups can be studied using matrix groups, which are comparatively well understood, by means of representation theory.|$|E
5|$|Hassler Whitney {{showed that}} if the graph is 3-connected then the embedding, and thus the dual graph, is unique. By Steinitz's theorem, these graphs are exactly the {{polyhedral}} graphs, the graphs of convex polyhedra. A planar graph is 3-vertex-connected {{if and only if}} its dual graph is 3-vertex-connected. More generally, a planar graph has a unique embedding, and therefore also a unique dual, if and only if it is a subdivision of a 3-vertex-connected planar graph (a graph formed from a 3-vertex-connected planar graph by replacing some of its edges by paths). For some planar graphs that are not 3-vertex-connected, such as the complete bipartite graph , the embedding is not unique, but all embeddings are <b>isomorphic.</b> When this happens, correspondingly, all dual graphs are <b>isomorphic.</b>|$|E
5|$|It {{is common}} in {{mathematics}} to regard the Lorentz group to be, foremost, the Möbius group {{to which it is}} <b>isomorphic.</b> The group may be represented in terms of a set of functions defined on the Riemann sphere. These are the Riemann P-functions, which are expressible as hypergeometric functions.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the dual}} graph {{depends on a}} {{particular}} embedding, the dual graph of a planar graph is not unique {{in the sense that}} the same planar graph can have non-isomorphic dual graphs. In the picture, the blue graphs are <b>isomorphic</b> but their dual red graphs are not. The upper red dual has a vertex with degree 6 (corresponding to the outer face of the blue graph) while in the lower red graph all degrees are less than 6.|$|E
5|$|The case i = n {{has also}} been noted already, and is an easy {{consequence}} of the Hurewicz theorem: this theorem links homotopy groups with homology groups, which are generally easier to calculate; in particular, it shows that for a simply-connected space X, the first nonzero homotopy group πk(X), with k > 0, is <b>isomorphic</b> to the first nonzero homology group H'k(X). For the n-sphere, this immediately implies that for n ge& 2, πn(S'n) = H'n(S'n) = Z.|$|E
5|$|Vanadinite {{is in the}} apatite {{group of}} phosphates, and forms a {{chemical}} series with the minerals pyromorphite (Pb5(PO4)3Cl) and mimetite (Pb5(AsO4)3Cl), with both of which it may form solid solutions. Whereas most chemical series involve the substitution of metallic ions, this series substitutes its anion groups; phosphate (PO4), arsenate (AsO4) and vanadate (VO4). Common impurities of vanadinite include phosphorus, arsenic and calcium, where these may act as an <b>isomorphic</b> substitute for vanadium. Vanadinite when containing a high amount of the arsenic impurity is known as endlichite.|$|E
25|$|If {{the line}} graphs of two {{connected}} graphs are <b>isomorphic,</b> then the underlying graphs are <b>isomorphic,</b> {{except in the}} case of the triangle graph K3 and the claw K1,3, which have <b>isomorphic</b> line graphs but are not themselves <b>isomorphic.</b>|$|E
25|$|Two curves can be birationally {{equivalent}} (i.e. have <b>isomorphic</b> function fields) {{without being}} <b>isomorphic</b> as curves. The situation becomes easier {{when dealing with}} nonsingular curves, i.e. those that lack any singularities. Two nonsingular projective curves over a field are <b>isomorphic</b> {{if and only if}} their function fields are <b>isomorphic.</b>|$|E
25|$|Conjugate subgroups are <b>isomorphic,</b> but <b>isomorphic</b> subgroups {{need not}} be conjugate. For example, an abelian group may have two {{different}} subgroups which are <b>isomorphic,</b> but they are never conjugate.|$|E
25|$|Theorem. A Banach space <b>isomorphic</b> to all its infinite-dimensional closed subspaces is <b>isomorphic</b> to a {{separable}} Hilbert space.|$|E
25|$|More formally, as sets {{these are}} <b>isomorphic,</b> but not {{naturally}} <b>isomorphic</b> (there are multiple choices of isomorphism), while as ordered sets they are naturally <b>isomorphic</b> (there {{is a unique}} isomorphism, given above), since finite total orders are uniquely determined up to unique isomorphism by cardinality.|$|E
25|$|Two cographs are <b>isomorphic</b> if {{and only}} if their cotrees (in the {{canonical}} form with no two adjacent vertices with the same label) are <b>isomorphic.</b> Because of this equivalence, one can determine in linear time whether two cographs are <b>isomorphic,</b> by constructing their cotrees and applying a linear time isomorphism test for labeled trees.|$|E
25|$|Any two {{countable}} well orderings are comparable. That is, {{they are}} <b>isomorphic</b> or one is <b>isomorphic</b> to a proper initial {{segment of the}} other.|$|E
25|$|The {{center of}} 2O is the {{subgroup}} {±1}, {{so that the}} inner automorphism group is <b>isomorphic</b> to O. The full automorphism group is <b>isomorphic</b> to O times& Z2.|$|E
25|$|If two simple graphs are <b>isomorphic</b> {{then their}} line graphs are also <b>isomorphic.</b> The Whitney graph {{isomorphism}} theorem provides a converse to this {{for all but}} one pair of graphs.|$|E
25|$|A {{bijective}} module homomorphism is an isomorphism of modules, {{and the two}} modules {{are called}} <b>isomorphic.</b> Two <b>isomorphic</b> modules are identical for all practical purposes, differing solely in the notation for their elements.|$|E
25|$|To {{take another}} example, {{elliptic}} geometries with different radii of curvature have <b>isomorphic</b> automorphism groups. That {{does not really}} count as a critique as all such geometries are <b>isomorphic.</b> General Riemannian geometry falls outside {{the boundaries of the}} program.|$|E
25|$|Ordered {{fields are}} totally ordered by definition. They include the {{rational}} {{numbers and the}} real numbers. Every ordered field contains an ordered subfield that is <b>isomorphic</b> to the rational numbers. Any Dedekind-complete ordered field is <b>isomorphic</b> to the real numbers.|$|E
25|$|A {{group that}} is <b>isomorphic</b> (as topological groups) to its dual group is called self-dual. While the reals and finite cyclic groups are self-dual, the group and the dual group are not {{naturally}} <b>isomorphic,</b> and should {{be thought of as}} two different groups.|$|E
25|$|For {{each line}} or plane of reflection, the {{symmetry}} group is <b>isomorphic</b> with Cs (see point groups in three dimensions), {{one of the}} three types of order two (involutions), hence algebraically <b>isomorphic</b> to C2. The fundamental domain is a half-plane or half-space.|$|E
25|$|The {{additive}} {{groups of}} R and C are <b>isomorphic.</b>|$|E
25|$|Every subordering is <b>isomorphic</b> to {{an initial}} segment.|$|E
25|$|R is <b>isomorphic</b> to the ordinal number ω + ω.|$|E
25|$|For C, {{and hence}} by the Lefschetz {{principle}} for every algebraically closed field of characteristic zero, the torsion group of an abelian variety of dimension g is <b>isomorphic</b> to (Q/Z)2g. Hence, its n-torsion part is <b>isomorphic</b> to (Z/nZ)2g, i.e. {{the product of}} 2g copies of the cyclic group of order n.|$|E
25|$|For genus 3 {{the order}} is maximized by the Klein quartic, with order 168; {{this is the}} first Hurwitz surface, and its {{automorphism}} group is <b>isomorphic</b> to the unique simple group of order 168, which is the second-smallest non-abelian simple group. This group is <b>isomorphic</b> to both PSL(2,7) and PSL(3,2).|$|E
25|$|Two {{probability}} {{spaces are}} <b>isomorphic,</b> if there exists an isomorphism between them.|$|E
25|$|A related result {{concerns}} edge partitions {{instead of}} vertex partitions: for every partition of {{the edges of}} the Rado graph into finitely many sets, there is a subgraph <b>isomorphic</b> to the whole Rado graph that uses at most two of the colors. However, there may not necessarily exist an <b>isomorphic</b> subgraph that uses only one color of edges.|$|E
25|$|The space ℝ⊕V {{with this}} {{multiplication}} is then <b>isomorphic</b> to the octonions.|$|E
25|$|Thus, the lattice of flats of this matroid is {{naturally}} <b>isomorphic</b> to.|$|E
25|$|PSL groups arise as Hurwitz groups (automorphism {{groups of}} Hurwitz {{surfaces}} – algebraic curves of maximal possibly symmetry group). The Hurwitz surface of lowest genus, the Klein quartic (genus 3), has automorphism group <b>isomorphic</b> to PSL(2, 7) (equivalently GL(3, 2)), while the Hurwitz surface of second-lowest genus, the Macbeath surface (genus 7), has automorphism group <b>isomorphic</b> to PSL(2, 8).|$|E
