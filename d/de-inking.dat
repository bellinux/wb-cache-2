Recycling paper decreases the demand for virgin pulp, thus reducing the overall amount of air and water pollution associated with paper manufacture. Recycled pulp can be bleached with the same chemicals used to bleach virgin pulp, but hydrogen peroxide and sodium hydrosulfite are the most common bleaching agents. Recycled pulp, or paper made from it, is known as PCF (process chlorine free) if no chlorine-containing compounds were used in the recycling process.

The paper-like substance, called <b>de-inking</b> residue, was evaluated for use as a soil amendment on land used for crop production in northeast Minnesota. Research plots were established in the fall of 1993 in Grand Rapids, Minnesota. The 10 - by 20 -foot plots were arranged in a randomized block design with 3 replications consisting of 3 levels of <b>de-inking</b> residue, 3 nitrogen rates, 1 manure rate, and 2 crops commonly produced in the region, for a total of 19 treatment combinations. Thirty-six lysimeters were installed to monitor changes in subsurface water quality. Soils were evaluated to determine impacts of <b>de-inking</b> residue on soil chemical properties. Crop yields and plant nutrient levels were determined in the late summer and early fall of 1994. <b>De-inking</b> residue was not a significant source of plant nutrients and cannot be classified as an Agricultural Liming Material (ALM). <b>De-inking</b> residue had a minimal impact on the chemical properties of soils and on subsurface water quality.

This had lead to the suggestion of enzymatic approach to overcome the problem encountered by commonly employed deinking techniques. The present study aimed to investigate 7 commercially available enzymes for their suitability use in deinking of laser printed paper. Methodology and results: 3 cellulases, hemicellulases, xylanase and 2 lipases were used in enzymatic deinking of laser-printed wastepaper. Cellulase A “Amano” 3 (C), Hemicellulase (H) and lipase (L) were selected for used in deinking because they possess either highest activity or broad pH stability compared to others enzymes.

40|$|<b>De-inking</b> sludge is a {{waste product}} {{generated}} from secondary fibre paper mills who manufacture recycled paper into new paper sheets; it refers directly to the solid residues which evolve during the <b>de-inking</b> stage of the paper pulping process. The current practice for the disposal of this waste is either by land-spreading, land-filling or incineration which are unsustainable. This work has explored the intermediate pyrolysis of pre-conditioned <b>de-inking</b> sludge pellets in a recently patented 20 kg/h intermediate pyrolysis reactor (The Pyroformer). The reactor is essentially two co-axial screws which are configured {{in such a way}} as to circulate solids within the reactor and thus facilitate in the cracking of tars. The potential application of using the volatile organic vapours and permanent gases evolved would be to generate both combined heat and power (CHP) located at paper making sites. The results show that <b>de-inking</b> sludge could be successfully pyrolysed and the organic vapours produced were composed of a mixture of aromatic hydrocarbons, phenolic compounds and some fatty acid methyl esters as detected by liquid GC-MS. The calorific value of the oil after condensing was between 36 and 37 MJ/kg and the liquid fuel properties were also determined, permanent gases were detected by a GC-TCD and were composed of approximately 24 % CO, 6 % CH and 70 % CO (v/v%). The solid residue from pyrolysis also contained a small residual calorific value, and was largely composed of mainly calcium based inert metal oxides. The application of applying intermediate pyrolysis to <b>de-inking</b> sludge for both CHP production and waste reduction is in principle a feasible technology which could be applied at secondary fibre paper mills. © 2013 Elsevier B.

40|$|During paper recycling, {{two types}} of waste are {{typically}} derived {{as a result of}} extracting cellulose fibre from paper.

These wastes are usually disposed of by means of landfilling or by incineration. In this paper, plastic extrusion is evaluated as a disposal method for these wastes. The DIR was dried to a moisture content of < 8 %. The MWP was prepared for the experiments by grinding to 6 mm diameter and cleared of 'foreign debris' before being dried to a moisture content of < 8 %. Samples were processed in a twin-screw extruder at three varying material ratios of the waste materials (75 : 25, 25 : 75, and 50 : 50). Tensile, flexural, and Charpy impacts were carried out to establish the mechanical properties of the samples. It was found that 75 % loadings of DIR did not consolidate. Of the other two blends, higher loading of DIR produced better strength and modulus properties, but with reduced elongation and toughness. The project demonstrated that waste byproduct materials from the paper recycling industry can be effectively prepared and extruded into suitable sample components. However, the highly variable nature of the MWP provides potential problems for further utilisation of this technology without plastic sorting...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – This paper aims to {{describe}} and evaluate the traditional methods for effective ink removal during the recycling of printed papers. Additionally, novel techniques {{for dealing with the}} newer “difficult to deink” inks such as toners from photocopiers, UV-cured ink films and liquid toner suspensions or Electroinks® are to be evaluated. Design/methodology/approach – High intensity ultrasound was applied to pulps derived from papers printed with these newer inks in order to evaluate its effectiveness in detaching the inks from paper and establishing the resultant ink particle size distributions. Findings – When exposed to ultrasound at a frequency of 20 ?kHz, it was found that “difficult to deink” pulps did exhibit significant ink detachment. In the case of toners, temperature did have an effect on particle breakdown with larger numbers of particles produced at temperatures well below the softening point which was attributed to a greater brittleness of the toner at lower temperatures. Electroinks® can be effectively <b>de-inked</b> by exposure to ultrasound coupled with washing under neutral conditions. With all the inks investigated, exposure to ultrasound resulted in the detached ink having particle size distributions that can be removed by conventional flotation and washing techniques. Research limitations/implications – The exposure of the pulp to ultrasound was only carried out using a batch-wise process. A future development would be to use a continuous flow system incorporating an annular ultrasound horn. Practical implications – Introducing ultrasound exposure into a conventional deinking plant, all post-consumer printed waste paper could be deinked without the use of deinking chemicals. Originality/value – The findings are of interest to those in paper recycling...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 1996 Laser {{printers}} {{and copy}} machines produce an increasing quantity of difficult-to-recycle paper. In {{the last several}} years, {{the need for an}} effective process to <b>de-ink</b> the toner has prompted a number of facilities to try toner agglomeration. The method requires the use of small amounts of an appropriate oil which serves to collect the toner into agglomerates that can be removed from paper fibers by screens or centrifugal cleaners. The technique shows promise by being simple, economical, and often very effective; however, it currently requires high-temperature and performs inconsistently, preventing significant use. A fundamental study of agglomeration is needed to determine how it operates, the key variables and their interactions. Therefore, the present study provides a fundamental understanding of agglomeration, laying the groundwork for process enhancement. We identify the key factors in agglomeration: concentration of cationic starch released from sheets in the repulper, oil composition, agitation rate, time and temperature. Furthermore, we examine how and why each factor influences agglomeration, and a population balance model is developed to help determine the quantitative relationships between the key variables. Cationic starch adsorbs to toner and oil interfaces, rendering them electrosterically stable to coalescence, thus preventing oil drops from reaching toner particle surfaces. However, when the oil contains an oil-soluble surfactant, the cationic starch adlayer is engulfed and some agglomeration resumes. Direct and novel use of the atomic force microscope provides insight into the cationic starch-induced reduction in oil-toner collision efficiency. Agitation rate and temperature influence the particle breakup rate, the latter by increasing aggregate strength by fusing toners above 35 ∘C. The model effectively predicts the experimental results, and shows how the competition between aggregate growth and breakup determines both the rate and degree of agglomeration. The results yield the agglomeration mechanism, quantitative expressions relating key variables and performance, and practical suggestions...|$|R

The mineland reclamation rules specify that a 90 percent vegetative cover shall be established on tailings after three growing seasons, however this level of cover on coarse tailings has not been consistently achieved in Minnesota using standard restoration practices. Research plots were established in 1992 at Eveleth Mines arranged in a randomized block design with three replications using five levels of <b>de-inking</b> residue, five levels of fertilization and two plant mixes. A total of twenty-five treatment combinations were assigned to 2. 5 m- by- 4. 0 m plots and lysimeters were installed to monitor changes in sub-surface water quality. Coarse tailings were evaluated {{to determine the effects of}} <b>de-inking</b> residue on their chemical properties. Vegetative cover was measured in July and September in 1992 and 1993 and nutrient levels were determined in plant samples. Fertilization and <b>de-inking</b> residue amendments had significant effects on the vegetative cover of both introduced and native plant species. <b>De-inking</b> residue had a minimal impact on the chemical properties of coarse tailings at rates up to 80 dry ton/acre and on sub-surface water quality at a depth of four feet. Vegetative cover for introduced species increased from no cover, to 49 percent the first growing season, to 90 percent at the end of the second growing season on tailings fertilized at the highest level and amended with residue at 10 ton/acre. At the same fertilizer and <b>de-inking</b> residue rate, vegetative cover for native plants increased from no cover to 7 percent the first growing season, to 69 percent at the end of the second growing season. Alfalfa had lower levels of boron, magnesium, and manganese on residue amended plots in 1992 and 1993. Bluestem had higher levels of calcium and zinc, but lower levels of magnesium and manganese on residue amended. plots. Cadmium, chromium, copper, nickel, lead, and zinc in alfalfa and bluestem did not accumulate to toxic levels.

The optimal condition for the present <b>de-inking</b> process was carried out at 20 degrees C for 7 min with <b>de-inking</b> additives consisting of 0. 8 wt%NAISA 20 (a solvent mixture) as <b>de-inking</b> solvent and 0. 3 wt% LAUEO 3 (lauryl alcohol polyethylene glycol) as the surfactant. During toner's adsorption process in the presence of preferred PET films, the residual ink speck population in the regenerated paper could be reduced from 67, 900 ppm to about 12 ppm (99. 98 % improvement) after two-stage treatments. The brightness of the final de-inked pulps could then be improved to 85 % GE (unit of brightness), almost identical to 86 % GE of virgin unprinted paper. Furthermore, the regenerated paper meets the standard of high quality grade paper which are suitable for reuse as the printing paper. The adsorption method as described in the study is advantageous because of its low chemical dosages and energy consumption. Additionally, the wastewater and the plastic films used in the process could be recycled. The simple and practical laboratory method can be adapted to conventional process plants for the economy benefits from scaling up. (C) 2009 Taiwan Institute of Chemical Engineers.

40|$|The {{research}} {{area is the}} recycling of post consumer waste paper using novel techniques. The aim of this work {{was to investigate the}} use of high intensity ultrasound in the <b>de-inking</b> of papers printed with UV-cured inks. Thick ink films printed by screen process printing were subjected to 20 kHz ultrasound. The effects of different exposure times were studied under conditions of neutral pH. The treatment resulted in the controlled breakdown and detachment of solid and halftone printings into particle sizes that could be removed by commercial flotation and washing methods. The temperature rise during sonication does not appear to influence either ink particle breakdown or their degree of removal. This suggests that ultrasound treatments could be used successfully to assist the <b>de-inking</b> of UV-cured inks at the temperatures employed in conventional <b>de-inking</b> plants without significant loss of ultrasound efficiency. This paper is the first reported use of ultrasound to breakdown UV-cured ink films. Previously it had been assumed that UV-cured inks would present a recycling problem as they form an impenetrable layer that resists alkaline recycling solutions. Some reports suggested that UV-cured inks were either ‘difficult or impossible to de-ink,’ the findings reported here present a solution to that problem...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the original work carried {{out into the}} novel application of high intensity ultrasound to the <b>de-inking</b> of waste papers printed with digitally printed inks. These inks include fused toners, Indigo inks (ElectroInks) and UV cured coatings. They were previously considered to be ‘difficult to de-ink’ when present in conventional recycling <b>de-inking</b> plants because they are difficult both to detach from paper fibres and to break down into particle sizes that can be removed by conventional flotation techniques. The significance of this work is that for all the systems investigated {{it was possible to}} both detach and reduce the size of ink particles down to a desired flotatable size range of between 20 to 120 microns. Thus digitally printed papers that had been seen as presenting a treat to effective paper recycling can be recycled using the techniques described. Temperature was found {{to play a role in}} heat fusible toner printed materials. <b>De-inking</b> of the tough films produced by UV curing inks showed no temperature dependence. Indigo ink that had been feared to present problems to the recycling industry was found to be relatively easy to de-ink using these techniques. The general conclusions are that the application of ultrasound can be used to aid the <b>de-inking</b> of waste paper and reduce the number of chemicals used. The paper was an invited presentation for the Non-impact Printing Conference (NIP 23) held in Anchorage, Alaska during September 2007. The NIP conference is organised the Society for Imaging Science and Technology (IS&T) with assistance from the Imaging Society of Japan and is considered to be the premiere event in evaluating the latest research developments in digital printing, attracting world class researchers from Japan and the USA...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} of xerography wastepaper recycling by estimating the solubility parameter of toner {{to select a}} suitable <b>de-inking</b> agent has been accomplished in aqueous media. The major <b>de-inking</b> agents {{used in this study}} were composed of combinations of a suitable organic solvent and a surfactant. This research focused on the addition of water insoluble solvents, with their solubility parameters closely proximate to the polymeric binders in toner, to assist its initial dissolution. Subsequently, the addition of surfactant to the mixture promotes the formation of an emulsion. The ink could then be easily washed away from the pulp aqueous slurry. The most suitable <b>de-inking</b> agent has been identified to be the mixture of naphthalene (20 %), isoamyl acetate (80 %) and surfactant. At 20 degrees C, styrene-acrylate copolymer binder in the toner was emulsified in the pulp aqueous slurry to form a stable emulsion with a particle size of 527 nm. After repeated water washings of the pulp, the ink specks on the paper were washed away as a water emulsion and the speck of the recycled paper was lowered from 5760 ppm to less than 10 ppm. In the meantime, the brightness of the final de-inked pulp was improved from 80 % GE to 85 % GE, which is almost identical to the brightness of virgin unprinted paper (86 % GE).
