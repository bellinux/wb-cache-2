5|$|On October 23 Biden {{revealed}} his <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>plan.</b> It called for expanded coverage {{for children and}} adults but stops short of mandates for complete universal coverage. It aimed to encourage wellness and modernization of treatment. Biden stated it would cost between $80billion and $110billion per year. He said it could have been paid with a rollback of tax cuts of the richest 1% bracket, capital gains and dividends and the elimination of tax loopholes for hedge fund managers and private equity partners. The plan would also had increased the SCHIP program to include children 300% above the poverty level.|$|E
5|$|In 1988, Pittston {{still felt}} {{the strain of}} {{providing}} benefits, with the cost per miner increasing by $3,746 from the 1979 amount. The company was still going into debt and having a difficult time paying for the miners' benefits. To avoid losing more money, Pittston doubled health deductibles, lowered the coverage from 100% to 80%, and discontinued benefits to miners who retired before 1974. This change in the <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>plan</b> was still not enough {{for the company to}} gain a profit, so they decided to keep the mines running 24hours a day and seven days a week, with no overtime for the workers. Pittston also did away with successorship clauses, which meant that the miners of Pittston would not have job security or transfer of job rights in mines that were leased or sold. Miners were now working longer hours with more expensive health care plans, while the mine was losing no production time because it was never closed.|$|E
5|$|On September 22, 1993, Clinton {{made a major}} {{speech to}} Congress {{regarding}} a health care reform plan; the program aimed at achieving universal coverage through a national <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>plan.</b> This {{was one of the}} most prominent items on Clinton's legislative agenda and resulted from a task force headed by Hillary Clinton. The plan was well received in political circles, but it was eventually doomed by well-organized lobby opposition from conservatives, the American Medical Association, and the health insurance industry. However, Clinton biographer John F. Harris stated that the program failed because of a lack of coordination within the White House. Despite the Democratic majority in Congress, the effort to create a national health care system ultimately died when compromise legislation by George J. Mitchell failed to gain a majority of support in August 1994. The failure of the bill was the first major legislative defeat of the Clinton administration.|$|E

5|$|With no presidential ambitions left, Kennedy {{formed a}} good {{relationship}} with Democratic President Bill Clinton upon the latter taking office in 1993, despite his having initially backed former fellow Massachusetts Senator Paul Tsongas in the 1992 Democratic presidential primaries. Kennedy floor-managed successful passage of Clinton's National and Community Service Trust Act of 1993 that created the AmeriCorps program, and despite reservations supported the president on the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). On the issue Kennedy cared most about, national health insurance, he supported but was not much involved in formation of the Clinton <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>plan,</b> which was run by First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and others. It failed badly and damaged the prospects for such legislation for years to come. In 1994, Kennedy's strong recommendation of his former Judiciary Committee staffer Stephen Breyer played a role in Clinton appointing Breyer to the U.S. Supreme Court. During 1994 Kennedy became the first senator with a home page on the World Wide Web; the product of an effort with the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, it helped counter the image of Kennedy as old and out of touch.|$|E

40|$|AIM: Legislation {{relating}} to advance <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>planning</b> was introduced into Queensland in 1998. All states and territories apart from Western Australia, New South Wales and Tasmania now have legislation {{relating to}} this issue. The {{aim of this}} pilot study was to: determine current usage of advance health directives (AHDs) in an individual general practice; and encourage appropriate use of AHDs in general practice. METHOD: One hundred clinical records were audited for evidence of advance <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>planning</b> and 100 adult patients were surveyed regarding advance care preferences. RESULTS: One percent of clinical records showed evidence of advance <b>health</b> <b>care</b> discussion and 5 % of those surveyed stated they had a current AHD. Only 10 % of those surveyed were aware of AHDs; 70 % {{wanted to know more}} about them; 83 % wished family members to be substitute decision makers regarding health matters if the individual was too ill to be involved; 54 % nominated doctors to be among their preferred decision makers. CONCLUSIONS: Lack of familiarity with advance <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>planning</b> options was very common, however most patients wished to be involved in their own advance <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>planning</b> or wished to involve a family member. Legislation now exists in the majority of states and territories for this to occur.
