40|$|Given a good <b>{{importance}}</b> <b>function,</b> importance sampling is able {{to achieve}} satisfactory precisions within a reasonable time. In addition to the well known requirement that the <b>importance</b> <b>function</b> should have a similar shape to the target density (Rubinstein, 1981), it is also highly recommended that the <b>importance</b> <b>function</b> possess heavy tails (Geweke, 1989; MacKay, 1998; Yuan and Druzdzel, 2004). To achieve this, the ɛ-cutoff heuristic (Cheng and Druzdzel, 2000; Yuan and Druzdzel, 2003) was used to cut off extremely small probabilities in the <b>importance</b> <b>function</b> (Yuan and Druzdzel, 2003). However, ɛcutoff demonstrates inconsistent performance on different networks. In this paper, we analyze the underlying reasons and propose another heuristic, if-tempering, based on simulated tempering.

40|$|AbstractApproximate Bayesian {{inference}} by importance sampling derives probabilistic {{statements from}} a Bayesian network, {{an essential part}} of evidential reasoning with the network and an important aspect of many Bayesian methods. A critical problem in importance sampling on Bayesian networks is the selection of a good <b>importance</b> <b>function</b> to sample a network’s prior and posterior probability distribution. The initially optimal importance functions eventually start deviating from the optimal function when sampling a network’s posterior distribution given evidence, even when adaptive methods are used that adjust an <b>importance</b> <b>function</b> to the evidence by learning. In this article we propose a new family of Refractor Importance Sampling (RIS) algorithms for adaptive importance sampling under evidential reasoning. RIS applies “arc refractors” to a Bayesian network by adding new arcs and refining the conditional probability tables. The goal of RIS is to optimize the <b>importance</b> <b>function</b> for the posterior distribution and reduce the error variance of sampling.

However if someone of the invited people cannot join the meeting it would be desirable for this person to have a kind of browser that enables him to get an automatically generated summary of the meeting and to watch any section of the video recording that seems to be interesting for him. In order to provide such a tool, several steps have to be performed on the videostream. In the first part of analyzing the recorded video the person has to be detected in each frame of the video. For this detection we use a tracker based on the ICondensation algorithm [1]. This algorithm is an extension of the standard condensation method and additionally uses a so-called <b>importance</b> <b>function</b> to draw samples from. In our implementation we have chosen the skin color distribution as such an <b>importance</b> <b>function.</b> Now samples can be drawn both from the <b>importance</b> <b>function</b> on the one side and from the face distribution on the other side. The great advantage of this extended algorithm is, that a track, that has been lost, can be found again by sampling from this <b>importance</b> <b>function.</b> This reinitialization is performed in every frame with a certain probability, i. e. some samples are drawn from the <b>importance</b> <b>function</b> to avoid a loss of the track, and the remaining samples are drawn from the face probability distribution with standard condensation sampling.
