Macrophages are specialized phagocytes that remove dying <b>or</b> <b>dead</b> cells <b>or</b> cellular debris. Within adipose tissue, presence of dead adipocytes is a hallmark of obesity.

5|$|Ayane was {{originally}} introduced as an unnamed training dummy in the Sega Saturn version of <b>Dead</b> <b>or</b> Alive, before {{she became a}} player character in the 1998 PlayStation port, in which she is an opponent character in the practice and tournament modes (Ayane was later included in the <b>Dead</b> <b>or</b> Alive ++ arcade edition) {{as well as an}} unlockable secret character.

5|$|She {{returns as}} a playable {{character}} in <b>Dead</b> <b>or</b> Alive 5, set {{two years after}} the events of <b>Dead</b> <b>or</b> Alive 4. Ayane follows Kasumi upon Hayate's orders, and later discovers that she is in fact really an Alpha clone. Ayane and Hayate learn from Helena that Victor Donovan and his new organization, MIST, plan to sell his Alpha clones as super soldiers to various countries around the world. They infiltrate the oil rig platform where Helena believes MIST's secret laboratory is hidden. After Ayane and Hayate kill Kasumi's clone, they breach into the lab, but Hayate is captured by Rig and Ayane is forced to flee. After Ryu summons the real Kasumi to battle and Hayate is rescued, they destroy the laboratory and Alpha-152.|$|E

However, {{in an interview in}} 1975 or '76, Buñuel claimed that he had used a dead calf's eye.

5|$|In {{addition}} to protein- and solution-mediated processes, {{it is also}} possible for lipid bilayers to participate directly in signaling. A classic example of this is phosphatidylserine-triggered phagocytosis. Normally, phosphatidylserine is asymmetrically distributed in the cell membrane and is present only on the interior side. During programmed cell death a protein called a scramblase equilibrates this distribution, displaying phosphatidylserine on the extracellular bilayer face. The presence of phosphatidylserine then triggers phagocytosis to remove the <b>dead</b> <b>or</b> dying cell.|$|E

5|$|In an animal, {{cells are}} {{constantly}} dying. A balance between cell division and cell death keeps {{the number of}} cells relatively constant in adults. There are two different ways a cell can die: by necrosis or by apoptosis. In contrast to necrosis, which often results from disease or trauma, apoptosis—or programmed cell death—is a normal healthy function of cells. The body has to rid itself of millions of <b>dead</b> <b>or</b> dying cells every day, and phagocytes {{play a crucial role}} in this process.|$|E
5|$|In {{marine and}} {{freshwater}} environments, gastrotrichs {{form part of}} the benthic community. They are detritivores and are microphagous, sucking <b>dead</b> <b>or</b> living organic material, diatoms, bacteria and small protozoa into their mouths by the muscular action of the pharynx. They are themselves eaten by turbellarians and other small macrofauna.|$|E
