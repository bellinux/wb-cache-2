50|$|The {{number of}} the mud tanks that are needed on the {{drilling}} rig depends on {{the depth of the}} well, and also the mud demands of drilling. Normally the shale shaker and vacuum degasser and desander are mounted together on the same mud tank as the first tank at the oilfield, while desilter and centrifuge on the second tank. Also, the drilling rig has other different tanks such as a reserve tank, <b>emergency</b> <b>tank,</b> etc.|$|E
5000|$|Goods {{traffic was}} at a peak during the interwar period, when the sidings saw a variety of {{interesting}} traffic. Horseboxes and cattle wagons were numerous, and during the war, it was a stabling point for an <b>emergency</b> <b>tank</b> train. A large banana ripening shed was opened in the late 1950s and this received supplies direct from Avonmouth Docks. This closed on 1 October 1971 as bananas were now containerised and transported by road. Race traffic has also decreased and the track layout was progressively simplified, leaving the remaining traffic {{to be dealt with}} by strengthening ordinary services. Further modifications were carried out in 1972 when the station was [...] "modernised" [...] by demolishing the goods shed and removing the down platform canopy. However, the main buildings, together with the adjoining stationmaster's house, have survived as good examples of an LBSCR country station.|$|E
50|$|Anatoly Dyatlov, {{the deputy}} chief engineer, {{supervised}} the test. At the moment reactor power slipped to 30MW, he insisted the operators continue the test. He overrode Akimov's and Toptunov's objections, threatening to hand the shift to Tregub (the previous shift operator who had remained on-site), intimidating them into attempting to increase the reactor power. During {{this period of time}} the reactor protection system was vetoed to prevent automatic shutdown of the reactor. The power stabilized at 200MW at around 1:00 am and did not rise further, due to continued xenon poisoning of the core. Later the test was commenced, then the reactor showed power excursion and was scrammed. As the control rods dropped into the core, their design (which incorporated a graphite plug at the bottom of each rod) introduced additional moderation and hence reactivity into the reactor system. The explosion occurred as the control rods were falling, and the subsequent damage prevented insertion into the reactor. Dyatlov ordered reactor cooling with emergency speed, assuming the reactor was intact and the explosion had been caused by hydrogen accumulating in the <b>emergency</b> <b>tank</b> of the safety control system. Other employees went to the control room, reporting damage. Dyatlov went to the backup control room, pressing the AZ-5 button there and disconnecting power to the control rod servodrives; despite seeing the graphite blocks scattered on the ground outside the plant, he still believed the reactor was intact. Kudryavtsev and Proskuryakov returned to report the reactor damage they had seen, but Dyatlov insisted what they had seen was the results of an explosion of the <b>emergency</b> <b>tank,</b> claiming the explosion of the 110 m³ tank at Level +71 was sufficient to destroy the central hall roof. Dyatlov reported his assumptions as reality to Bryukhanov and Fomin, the higher-level managers. In the corridor, he met Genrikh and Kurguz and sent them to the medical station. He ran to the control room of Block 3, ordered Bagdasarov to shut down Reactor 3, then returned to control room 4 and ordered Akimov to call the daytime shift and get people to the affected unit; namely Lelechenko, whose crew had to remove hydrogen from the Generator 8 electrolyzer. At 2:00, Dyatlov ordered Akimov to feed water to the reactor, and together with Gorbachenko went to survey the plant from the outside. Despite seeing the fuel and graphite scattered around, he still believed the reactor was intact. They then returned to the control room. At 5:00 am, he got sick and together with Gorbachenko went to the medical unit. Fomin replaced him at his post with Sitnikov.|$|E

5000|$|Kudryavtsev and Proskuryakov, the SIUR {{trainees}} {{from other}} shifts, were present to watch Toptunov and learn. After the explosion {{they were sent}} by Dyatlov or Akimov to the central hall to turn the handles of the system for manual lowering of the presumably seized control rods. They ran through the de-aerator gallery {{to the right to}} the VRSO unit elevator, found it destroyed, so climbed up the staircase instead, towards Level 36; they missed Kurguz and Genrikh, who used another stairwell. Level 36 was destroyed, covered with rubble. They went through a narrow corridor towards the central hall, entered the reactor hall, and found it blocked with rubble and fragments; dangling fire hoses were pouring water into the remains of the reactor core, the firemen not there anymore. The Upper Biological Shield was slanted, jammed into the reactor shaft; a blue and red fire raged in the hole. The minute the two stood above the reactor was enough to darken their bodies with [...] "nuclear tan" [...] and give them a fatal radiation dose. They returned to Level 10 and to the control room, reporting the situation; Dyatlov insisted they were wrong, assuming the explosion had been caused by hydrogen-oxygen mixture in the 110 m³ <b>emergency</b> <b>tank</b> and the reactor itself was intact.|$|E

The Project {{was made}} in TRIMPOT ELECTRONICAS Ltda. This is an {{electronical}} components manufacturing enterprise. The East plant has a water supply system conformed by a deep well pump which feeds two capture tanks automatically and feeds manually an <b>emergency</b> <b>tank.</b> The level control systems of the tanks was installed more than 25 years ago and it has undergone many modifications due to component failures. Furthermore, {{it did not have}} any monitoring system interface, which allowed observing and controlling the actuators, besides identifying failures generating alarm messages on the computer screen. In this project, the control system for filling the process tanks was updated and improved, and the <b>emergency</b> <b>tank</b> was included in the control system. This was done with an Omron PLC controlled by ultrasonic sensors, flow sensors and pressure transmitters. The sequence also considers the time to decrease the probability that the well pump will start in the peak period of CNFL billing and increase in the night period An application was also designed in LabVIEW that communicates with the PLC via FINS / UDP, Omron protocol, with which it is possible to monitor the status of tank levels and volumes, pressures and specific pipeline flows, remotely control the solenoid valves and the deep well pump, perform configurations and also displays system alerts. Finally, a database was implemented in Microsoft Access, which carries a record of some variables of the system, which communicates with the LabVIEW application through an ODBC.

40|$|In {{order to}} study the {{operating}} characteristics of a second-loop Passive Residual Heat Removal System (PRHRS), the transient thermal analysis code RELAP 5 is used to build simulation models of the main coolant system and second-loop PRHRS. Transient calculations and comparative analyses under station blackout accident and one-side feed water line break accident conditions are conducted for three critical design factors of the second-loop PRHRS:design capacity, <b>emergency</b> makeup <b>tank</b> and isolation valve opening speed. The impacts of the discussed design factors on the operating characteristics of the second-loop PRHRS are summarized based on calculations and analyses. The analysis {{results indicate that the}} system safety and cooling rate should be taken into consideration in designing PRHRS's capacity,and water injection from <b>emergency</b> makeup <b>tank</b> to steam generator can provide advantage to system cooling in the event of accident,and system startup performance can be improved by reducing the opening speed of isolation valve.

50|$|This {{incident}} was revisited, when the USS Greeneville (SSN-772), on 9 February 2001, also conducted an <b>emergency</b> main ballast <b>tank</b> blow {{off the coast}} of Oahu while hosting several civilians. The Greeneville struck the 191-foot (58 m) Japanese fishery high school training ship Ehime Maru (えひめ丸), causing the fishing boat to sink in less than ten minutes with the death of nine crew members, including four high school students. The USS Von Steuben (SSBN-632) had conducted an <b>emergency</b> main ballast <b>tank</b> blow due to its planes tangled in the submerged towline of the tug, jamming them so that the sub threatened to sink. The Greenville blew her main ballast tanks merely to demonstrate a maneuver and not to escape from danger. Her captain consciously surrendered control of the vessel. The captain of the Von Steuben had acted properly in ordering the emergency blow. He had lost control of his ship, his stern planes were jammed, and the possibility of an irreversible plunge {{to the bottom of the}} ocean was very real. However, the captain of the Greenville had to face a court of inquiry and possibly a full court-martial, until his request to retire was approved.|$|R
