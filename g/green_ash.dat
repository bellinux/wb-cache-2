In Europe, Fraxinus excelsior is the main ash species colonized by EAB. Ash susceptibility can vary due to the attractiveness of chemical volatiles to adults, or the ability of larvae to detoxify phenolic compounds. Emerald ash borer has also been found infesting white fringe tree in North America, which is a non-ash host, but {{it is unclear whether}} the trees were healthy when first infested, or were already in decline due to drought.|$|E

40|$|Speciation is {{a central}} process in {{evolutionary}} biology and {{is responsible for the}} diversity of life on Earth. While there has been much progress in evolutionary research over the last 150 years, understanding the many facets of speciation remains a major challenge. In this thesis, I focus on a group of Eucalyptus species called the <b>green</b> <b>ashes</b> (subgenus Eucalyptus section Eucalyptus). The <b>green</b> <b>ashes</b> comprise tall trees on fertile soils (e. g. the tallest flowering plant in the world, Eucalyptus regnans), as well as medium trees and mallees on low nutrient soils. Although Eucalyptus is Gondwanan in origin, fossil and molecular evidence suggest that many eucalypt groups (including the <b>green</b> <b>ashes)</b> diverged within the last 10 million years. Since the <b>green</b> <b>ashes</b> are highly diverse, occur across a range of habitats and are considered recently radiated, they are an appropriate group for investigating speciation mechanisms. Phylogenetic and population genetic analyses using genome-wide scans based on Diversity Arrays Technology (DArT) were used to reconstruct the evolutionary history of the species relationships. A common garden experiment was conducted to examine how seedling response to variable resource availability is associated with evolutionary events across species. Environmental modelling was used to investigate differences in the predicted range and climatic niche of species. I found that species boundaries in the <b>green</b> <b>ashes</b> were not always consistent with classifications based on morphology and there was evidence of hybridisation and ongoing gene flow between lineages. The findings suggest that the <b>green</b> <b>ashes</b> are at varying stages of speciation, with some species being highly genetically differentiated and others being at earlier stages on the speciation continuum. Inter-specific differences in seedling traits were significant, with traits such as leaf width and biomass being highly plastic across resource treatments for most species. Predicted environmental niches varied amongst species, and species with lower seedling plasticity tended to be restricted to narrower environmental ranges. Overall, this study demonstrates that an approach incorporating phylogenomics, population genomics, a common garden experiment and environmental modelling can provide insights into the speciation of a group of closely related species, where a number of speciation mechanisms (e. g. reticulate evolution, vicariance and ecological speciation) are operating in concert...|$|R
40|$|CSIRO 2015. Eucalyptus is a genus {{that occurs}} {{in a range of}} {{habitats}} in Australia, Papua New Guinea, Timor, Sulawesi and the Philippines, with several species being used as sources of timber and fibre. However, despite its ecological and commercial significance, understanding its evolutionary history remains a challenge. The focus of the present study is the <b>green</b> <b>ashes</b> (subgenus Eucalyptus section Eucalyptus). Although previous studies, based primarily on morphology, suggest that the <b>green</b> <b>ashes</b> form a monophyletic group, there has been disagreement concerning the divergence of taxa. The present study aims to estimate the phylogeny of the <b>green</b> <b>ashes</b> and closely related eucalypts (37 taxa from over 50 locations in south-eastern Australia), using genome-wide analyses based on Diversity Arrays Technology (DArT). Results of analyses were similar in topology and consistent with previous phylogenies based on sequence data. Many of the relationships supported those proposed by earlier workers. However, other relationships, particularly of taxa within the Sydney region and Blue Mountains, were not consistent with previous classifications. These findings raise important questions concerning how we define species and discern relationships in Eucalyptus and may have implications for other plant species, particularly those with a complex evolutionary history where hybridisation and recombination have occurred...|$|R

Many of the specialized predators and parasitoids that suppressed emerald ash borer in Asia were not present in North America. Predators and parasitoids native to North America do not sufficiently suppress emerald ash borer, so populations continue to grow. Emerald ash borer populations can spread between [...] a year. It primarily spreads through flight or by transportation of ash bark containing products such as firewood or nursery stock, which allows it to reach new areas and create satellite populations outside of the main infestation.|$|E
40|$|The emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis; EAB) is a wood-boring beetle {{that was}} {{introduced}} to North America from Asia c. 1990. Larval feeding on ash trees (Fraxinus spp.) has caused extensive mortality of North American ashes. This study was initiated {{in the early stages}} of an EAB infestation at Point Pelee National Park in Essex County, Ontario, Canada to monitor an infestation in a natural environment, and included assessment of tree health and quantification of beetle emergence.

6000|$|There is a {{delightful}} account {{of such a}} log cabin by John S. Williams, whose father settled in the woods of Belmont County in 1800. [...] "Our cabin," [...] he says, [...] "had been raised, covered, part of the cracks chinked, {{and part of the}} floor laid, when we moved in on Christmas day. There had not been a stick cut except in building the cabin, which was so high from the ground that a bear, wolf, panther, or any animal less in size than a cow could enter without even a squeeze.... The <b>green</b> <b>ash</b> puncheons had shrunk so as to leave cracks in the floor and doors from one to two inches wide. At both the doors we had high, unsteady, and sometimes icy steps, made by piling the logs cut out of the walls, for the doors and the window, if it could be called a window, when perhaps it was the largest spot in the top, bottom, or sides of the cabin where the wind could not enter. It was made by sawing out a log, and placing sticks across, and then by pasting an old newspaper over the hole, and applying hog's lard, we had a kind of glazing which shed a most beautiful and mellow light across the cabin when the sun shone on it. All other light entered at the doors, cracks, and chimneys. Our cabin was twenty-four by eighteen. The west end was occupied by two beds, the center of each side by a door.... On {{the opposite side of the}} window, made of clapboards, supported on pins driven into the walls, were our shelves. On these shelves my sister displayed in simple order, a host of pewter plates, and dishes and spoons, scoured and bright.... Our chimney occupied most of the east end; with pots and kettles opposite the window, under the shelves, a gun on hooks over the north door, four split-bottomed chairs, three three-legged stools, and a small eight by ten looking glass sloped from the wall over a large towel and comb case.... We got a roof laid over head as soon as possible, but it was laid of loose clapboards split from a red-oak, and a cat might have shaken every board in our ceiling.... We made two kinds of furniture. One kind was of hickory bark, with the outside shaved off. This we would take off all around the tree, the size of which would determine the caliber of our box. Into one end we would place a flat piece of bark or puncheon, cut round to fit in the bark, which stood on end the same as when on the tree.... A much finer article was made of slippery-elm bark, shaved smooth, with the inside out, bent round and sewed together, where the end of the hoop or main bark lapped over.... This was the finest furniture in a lady's dressing room," [...] and such a cabin and its appointments were splendor and luxury beside those of the very earliest pioneers, and many of the latest. The Williamses were Quakers, and the mother was recently from England; they were of far gentler breeding and finer tastes than most of their neighbors, who had been backwoodsmen for generations.|$|E
