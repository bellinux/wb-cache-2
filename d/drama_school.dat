Wiseau also drew on the chamber plays of Tennessee Williams, whose highly emotional scenes he enjoyed acting out in <b>drama</b> <b>school</b> – many advertising materials for The Room make explicit parallels to Williams's work.|$|E

In 1930 he had his first important West End success in Noël Coward's Private Lives, and he appeared in his first film. In 1935 he played in a celebrated production of Romeo and Juliet alongside Gielgud and Peggy Ashcroft, {{and by the end}} of the decade he was an established star.
