Many credit cards {{can also be used}} to take cash advances through ATMs, which also attract interest charges, usually calculated from the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> cash <b>withdrawal.</b> Some merchants charge a fee for purchases by credit card, as they will be charged a fee by the card issuer.|$|R

40|$|Knowledge <b>of</b> onset and <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> {{effective}} monsoon as well as, {{occurrence of}} critical dry spells and its duration helps in deciding sowing or transplantation dates and in planning of storage or removal {{of water from}} paddy fields according to irrigation or drainage needs of rice. June 17 and October 29 are the mean <b>dates</b> <b>of</b> onset and <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> effective monsoon and on average 2 to 3 critical dry spells of about 18 days occur in a year at Bhubaneswar. Water balance simulation studies indicate that runoff and number of irrigation applications are correlated with deep percolation rates as well as ponding due to bund heights. With increase in deep percolation rates, mean per cent runoff decreases and mean number of irrigation application increases. With increase in bund height, percentage runoff and number of irrigation applications decrease...|$|R

Canadian Minister of National Defence, Peter MacKay, declared at the forum, that Canada was considering staying in Afghanistan with a training mission.At a forum {{panel on the}} Iranian nuclear conflict US Senator Graham called for a military strike on Iran to “neuter” the regime. Michèle Flournoy, Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, confirmed a new approach of the US Administration towards Iran, from an attempt to engage the Iranian government “toward a pressure track with the imposition of sanctions”. Canadian Minister MacKay favored collective international sanctions against Iran and its nuclear program.Speaking at Halifax that same year, Janet Napolitano, United States Secretary of Homeland Security, emphasized the prominent role of regular citizens in thwarting terrorist attacks.|$|E
40|$|Background: There {{are limited}} {{published}} comparative data regarding the sensitivity {{and timing of}} early signal detection with commonly used signal detection methods (SDMs), including the reporting odds ratio (ROR), proportional reporting ratio (PRR), information component (IC) and gamma Poisson shrinker (GPS). Objective: To examine the sensitivity and timing of early signal detection across four SDMs using the Adverse Events Reporting System (AERS) database of the US Food and Drug Administration. Methods: The four SDMs were applied to retrospectively detect ten confirmed drug-event combinations (DECs). The sensitivity to detect adverse events {{was defined as the}} percentage of DECs detected by the respective SDMs as positive signals. The timing of early signal detection was measured by comparing the index <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>withdrawal</b> (IDW), defined as the date on which the drug was removed from the market, with the index date of detection (IDD), defined as a date on which the signal was significantly detected by the SDM. Results: The estimated sensitivity was 100 % for ROR, 90 % for PRR and IC and 70 % for GPS. The sensitivity increased with increasing numbers of reports per DEC. Compared with the IDW, the signals were detected on average 10 quarters earlier by ROR, 9 quarters earlier by PRR, 9. 9 quarters earlier by the IC and 4. 7 quarters earlier by GPS. Conclusions: The sensitivity and timing of early signal detection varies across the four SDMs. Numerically, the ROR showed better performance in sensitivity and early signal detection based on ten selected DECs. Given the limited number and range of DECs selected in this study and the unavailability of specificity assessment, further large-scale prospective studies are warranted in order to provide better guidance on the selection of SDMs. © 2008 Adis Data Information BV.

50|$|The {{title of}} Associate in Physical Science (Associate in Science from 1879) {{was used by}} the University of Durham College of Physical Sciences (now Newcastle University) from the 1870s.

As a university-level qualification lying below the bachelor's degree, this is considered to be the world's first associate degree in the modern sense, having been first awarded in 1873, 25 years prior to the introduction of associate degrees into the U.S. by the University of Chicago. Durham also introduced an Associate in Theology in 1901. Both of these have since been discontinued, although the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> their <b>withdrawal</b> is unknown.

The discussion revealed a critical assessment of the negotiations, including the fixed <b>date</b> <b>of</b> the <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> Soviet troops from Poland and making the consent to transit the troops from Germany subject to their prior evacuation from Poland.

Both the U.S. and the Soviet Union supported the resolution.

The five members of the Arab League, who were voting members at the time, voted against the Plan.|$|R
