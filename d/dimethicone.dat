5000|$|Cyclomethicones are a {{group of}} methyl siloxanes, a class of liquid {{silicones}} (cyclic polydimethylsiloxane polymers) that possess the characteristics of low viscosity and high volatility {{as well as being}} skin emollients and in certain circumstances useful cleaning solvents. Unlike <b>dimethicones,</b> which are linear siloxanes that do not evaporate, cyclomethicones are cyclic: both groups consist of a polymer featuring a monomer backbone of one silicon and two oxygen atoms bonded together, but instead of having a very long [...] "linear" [...] backbone surrounded by a series of methyl groups (which produces a clear, non-reactive, non-volatile liquid ranging from low to high viscosity), cyclomethicones have short backbones that make closed or nearly-closed rings or [...] "cycles" [...] with their methyl groups, giving them many of the same properties of <b>dimethicones</b> but making them much more volatile. They are used in many cosmetic products where eventual complete evaporation of the siloxane carrier fluid is desired. In this way they are useful for products like deodorants and antiperspirants which need to coat the skin but not remain tacky afterward. Most cyclomethicone is manufactured by Dow Corning. Cyclomethicones have been shown to involve the occurrence of silanols during biodegration in mammals.|$|R

40|$|Investigated complex fluids {{comprised}} polymer-surfactant-mixtures (PTMs) and oil-in-water (o/w) -emulsions. The {{mechanical properties}} were probed by oscillatory and continuous flow rheometry, microstructures of emulsions {{were evaluated by}} optical microscopy while droplet size and droplet size distribution were studied by flow particle image analysis (FPIA). 0. 3 - 4. 0 wt% of hydrophobically modified (hm) -(acrylic acid) copolymers and hm-(poly) urethans were combined with 0. 0 - 2. 0 wt% low molecular surfactant (sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS) - anionic, cetyltrimethylammonium-bromide (CTAB) - cationic, ethoxylated fatty alcohol (Arylpon F, Dehydol LS 9. 5) - nonionic). The resulting PTMs revealed different polymer-surfactant interactions, due to surfactant / polymer charge and structure. In case of nonionic surfactants and SDS, polymer-surfactant interactions resulted in {{a more or less}} pronounced "thin-to-thick"-effect of PTMs depending on surfactant concentration and structure, whereas in CTAB-PTMs thickening as well as phase separation were observed depending on CTAB concentration. For PTMs from 1. 0 wt% crosslinked polymer and surfactants an uncommon second shear thinning region, which is not mentioned in the literature so far, region was observed in the flow curves, which could be related to shear induced structural changes. The investigations on PTMs gave basic understanding of a possible applicability of polymeric thickeners in emulsions. Because low molecular surfactants showed some disadvantages in emulsions, only polymeric stabilized emulsions were investigated which contain silicon-based polymeric emulsifiers (<b>dimethicones).</b> Rheological properties and microstructures of polymer stabilized emulsions were compared to properties of classic emulsions with low molecular emulsifiers as stabilizing components. The investigations concerning rheological properties and droplet size of emulsions, presented here, dealt with o/w-emulsions containing polymeric thickener Pemulen TR- 1 (TR- 1) and silicone based emulsifier (DC 193). By varying thickener and emulsifier content rheological properties and droplet size of emulsions changed significantly. Experimental results and a statistical analysis showed that the physical network, build up by TR- 1 in a concentration range from 0. 1 - 1. 0 wt%, was the dominating factor for rheological properties and increased moduli and viscosity of emulsions. The development of droplet diameters revealed that a systematic control of droplet parameters was possible by increasing the DC 193 concentration from 0. 0 - 5. 0 wt%. In contrast, increasing TR- 1 concentration led to either large or small droplets. The influence of larger droplets in the emulsions was revealed when the arithmetic diameter and the Sauter diameter were compared and displayed huge differences. These differences resulted from a rather small amount of big droplets with diameters above 40 micrometer, which could be seen in the droplet size distributions of emulsions. An influence of oil droplets on emulsion elasticity was only observed for emulsions with low TR- 1 concentration (~ 0. 1 wt%), because at higher concentrations the influence of oil droplets was superimposed by thickening properties of TR- 1...|$|R

5000|$|Silicone-based make-up uses a {{silicone}} — or a {{blend of}} water and silicone — as the main ingredient. The most typical silicones used are <b>dimethicone,</b> polysiloxane and volatile silicones such as cyclomethicone and phenyl trimethicone. The silicone provides lubrication and viscosity (what some artists refer to as [...] "slip") at a level equal to, or often, even better than oil allowing a product to apply and blend over the skin smoothly and evenly. Silicones have a lighter weight and are thus more comfortable on the skin, as well as resisting filling in lines or large pores on the face. Conventional silicones stay supple and smooth, even in dry climates, whereas volatile silicones last long enough to blend over the face, then evaporate (like alcohol), leaving little to no feel behind. Silicone-based makeups {{are less likely to}} oxidise or change colour during wear. One of the biggest challenges facing silicone bases is the tendency for the product to break and/or ball up on the skin, something unique to silicones and out of control of the user. Ionizing the silicones (electrically charging the silicone positive) helps it adhere to (negatively charged) skin, although this technology is in its infancy and thus rather expensive.

40|$|Aluminium {{zirconium}} tetrachlorohydrex glycine (AZG) is {{a popular}} antiperspirant/deodorant agent, formulated in various forms including the clear gels. Silicones are used for the preparation of these gels, giving them desirable characteristics. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the influence of various silicones, when used in combination, on the rheological properties of the resulting AZG gels prepared. Based on preliminary studies, various AZGcontaining silicone-based gel formulations were prepared. Silicones used (as ternary mixtures) included ABIL® EM 97, ABIL® 8839 and ABIL® 8852. Formulations prepared were then examined rheologically and their plastic viscosity and yield values determined. Results showed that the amount of ABIL® EM 97 (used as an emulsifier) present within the gel formulation is critical. An increase in the amount of this silicone, corresponding to a small decrease in theamount of the hydrophobic structure building (gelling agent) ABIL® B 8839, increased the plastic viscosity and yield values of the gel. On the other hand, an excess amount of ABIL® B 8852, as a hydrophilic co-surfactant, reduced the viscosity and yield values of the resulting gel. Eventually, among the formulations prepared, formulation F 5 with suitable aesthetic and skin feel properties, spreadability and rheological behaviors, was selected for further studies. By constructing the up-curve and down-curve of this formulation, presence of a plastic thixotropic behavior was confirmed. Inclusion of various amounts of the hydrophobic siliconebased agent, <b>dimethicone,</b> within formulation F 5 showed that by increasing the amount of <b>dimethicone</b> present, the plastic viscosity and yield values of the gel would be reduced. This reduction was significant at <b>dimethicone</b> concentrations above 0. 5 %. Furthermore, by increasing the amount of <b>dimethicone</b> present, the calculated "percentage of reduction in plastic viscosity" also increased. This means that the extent of thixotropicity of the gel formulation increases by the addition of <b>dimethicone.</b> This finding was also backed up by theresulting rheograms constructed. Overall, addition of 0. 75 % <b>dimethicone</b> produced the most acceptable product in terms of an appropriate viscosity, yield value and extent of thixotropicity. In conclusion, this study shows that in-depth rheological assessment of AZG gels prepared from silicones could be used as an important tool during their formulation and characterization in order to obtain an effective formulation with desirable properties...|$|E
