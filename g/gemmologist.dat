50|$|Edward Charles Richard Taaffe (1898-1967), {{known as}} Richard, was an Austrian <b>gemmologist</b> {{who found the}} first cut and {{polished}} taaffeite in November 1945. He {{was the son of}} Count Henry Taaffe, 12th Viscount Taaffe, an Austrian landowner who once held hereditary titles from two different countries: he was a Count (Graf) in the Holy Roman Empire and a viscount in the Peerage of Ireland. Richard Taaffe, however, inherited neither the viscountcy, which was suspended by the British Crown in 1919 as his father had served on the Austrian side in World War I, nor the title of Count, as Austria had generally abolished titles of nobility in 1919. With Richard Taaffe's death in 1967, no heirs to either title remained and both the Austrian and the Irish titles became extinct.|$|E
50|$|There {{is in fact}} little {{evidence}} that the superstition was common before the 1850s. A popular gift book of the 1840s was entitled The Opal, which would seem an unlikely title if {{the notion of the}} opal's unluckiness were well established. In 1875, less than fifty years after the publication of Scott's novel, Sir Henry Ponsonby felt compelled to write to Notes and Queries to ask for the foundation of the superstition, and received several different answers, none of which mention Anne of Geierstein. A brief assertion of such a connection is made by Sir John Piggot in an earlier issue, but it is hedged with a quotation from the <b>gemmologist</b> Charles Barbot (who ascribes it to the influence of Robert le Diable) and the scholars responding to Queen Victoria's secretary do not refer to it.|$|E
50|$|The Crest is in {{the form}} of a lynx. This species of wildcat is {{traditionally}} renowned for its keenness of sight and, with perhaps just a touch of humour, was employed here as a perfect symbol for <b>gemmologists</b> and gemmology students. In its paws it holds one of the oldest heraldic emblems, an ‘escarbuncle’. This is a symbol of supremacy, but also represents a brilliant jewel with light radiating from it. Its tips are jewels of many different colours. Gem-A is often referred to as the central jewel, with gem education and knowledge radiating from it with the jewelled tips being the graduates and members of the Association.|$|R

Recently, however, pieces of amber-like fossil resin {{have been discovered}} on remote beaches near Cape Weymouth {{on the east coast}} of Cape York Peninsula in north. Queensland. They appear to derive from Quaternary deposits bordering the coast. The material ranges in colour from clear pale yellow through to dark brown and almost opaque. Numerous inclusions are present,. including fossilised insects. Tests show specimens include both copal and amber, making them of interest to <b>gemmologists.</b> l<iIR spectra show the fossil resins to be broadly similar to Baltic amber and Kauri gum (copal) but markedly different in their finer detail...|$|R
50|$|In 1852, Prince Albert, {{the husband}} of Queen Victoria, was unhappy with its dull and {{irregular}} appearance, and he ordered it cut down from 186 carat g by Coster Diamonds. It emerged 42 percent lighter as a dazzling oval-cut brilliant weighing 105.6 carat g and measuring 3.6 cm x 3.2 cm x 1.3 cm. By modern standards, the cut is far from perfect, in that the culet is unusually broad, giving {{the impression of a}} black hole when the stone is viewed head-on; it is nevertheless regarded by <b>gemmologists</b> as being full of life. As the diamond's history involves a great deal of fighting between men, the Koh-i-Noor acquired a reputation within the British royal family for bringing bad luck to any man who wears it. Since arriving in the country, it has only ever been worn by female members of the family.|$|R
5000|$|The DGemG {{was founded}} by the {{gemstone}} dealer and <b>gemmologist</b> Georg Otto Wild from Idar-Oberstein in 1932. Therefore the DGemG {{is one of the}} three oldest gemmological institutes worldwide. Gemmological courses have been offered since 1935 and since 1952 the journal ”GEMMOLOGIE. Journal of the German Gemmological Association” has been published.Beginning in 1968 the education was systematized in three fields: Gemmology of coloured stones, grading of diamonds and pearls/organic substances. The fundamental research and applied gemmology was done at the University of Heidelberg.In 1969 the “Professor-Dr.-Karl-Schlossmacher-Stiftung” {{was founded by}} the DGemG, which was renamed as “Deutsche Stiftung Edelsteinforschung” (DSEF) in 1979. 1975 the new building of the German Gemmological Association and facilities of the German Gemmological Education Center - German public vocational development office for Gemmology - were opened in the Professor-Schlossmacher-Straße. The international qualification F.G.G. (Fellow of the German Gemmological Association)was introduced in 1986 to support economy-related gemmological projects by the financial district parliament of Rhineland-Palatinate. In 2000 the gemmological courses and refresher-courses were improved to be more oriented towards the branch of trade.

40|$|Abstract: Grazing {{incidence}} illumination of gemstones on the gemmologist’s refractometer is now little used, but {{offers some}} significant advantages. The authors review {{the history of}} such use, give detailed explanations of how it is accomplished, and provide suggestions for its application to practical problems. There are three principal applications of grazing incidence illumination that can aid the <b>gemmologist</b> in practical discrimination between gems. One is in easier and better determination of the refractive index, or indices for birefringent stones. The second is in estimation of relative dispersion, {{and the third is}} in being able to observe polarized absorption spectra of gems...|$|E
40|$|Davina Gordon {{was born}} in 1933 and went to primary school during the Second World War. She remembered only large classes with very little history being taught. At Goldolphin & Latymer grammar school she was taught history chronologically, {{starting}} with Roman Britain. The teacher taught by talking. The girls sat listening to her without making notes but then used the textbook afterwards to make notes and write essays for homework. She was a very interesting teacher and Davina found it all fascinating and particularly remembered a lesson {{when they had to}} decide what they would have done to stabilise the country if they had been Elizabeth 1. After the war ended, soon after she went to the grammar school, there were trips to London museums and further afield. She did a course of general history for a year in the sixth form while doing a secretarial course at the school. There was now a new teacher who liked to bring in newspapers and talk about politics. After school she initially did secretarial work but then trained to be a <b>gemmologist</b> and worked in a jeweller’s shop for many years. Interviewed by Jenny Keating...|$|E
5000|$|Despite being outmoded, {{strontium}} titanate {{is still}} manufactured and periodically encountered in jewellery. It {{is one of}} the most costly of diamond simulants, and due to its rarity collectors may pay a premium for large i.e. >2 carat (400 mg) specimens. As a diamond simulant, strontium titanate is most deceptive when mingled with melée i.e. <0.20 carat (40 mg) stones and when it is used as the base material for a composite or doublet stone (with, e.g., synthetic corundum as the crown or top of the stone). Under the microscope, <b>gemmologists</b> distinguish strontium titanate from diamond by the former's softness—manifested by surface abrasions—and excess dispersion (to the trained eye), and occasional gas bubbles which are remnants of synthesis. Doublets can be detected by a join line at the girdle ("waist" [...] of the stone) and flattened air bubbles or glue visible within the stone at the point of bonding.|$|R
40|$|Among organic gems, pearls {{are widely}} used for decorating artworks and {{precious}} jewels; due to their attributes of beauty, they are also in high demand in the nowadays gemstone trade. The nature of color in pearls is still debated, even if recent studies have attributed to mixtures of methylated (carotenoids) or non-methylated polyenes with different UV-VIS absorption spectra and chain lengths [1]. Previous studies have demonstrated the potential of Raman spectroscopy in detecting pigments in cultured freshwater pearls [2]. With the aim to improve knowledge {{on the nature of}} pigments in natural and cultured pearls, several pearls species (Japanese cultured saltwater, Chinese natural and dyed freshwater, oriental natural, Tahitian cultured pearls) have been investigated by Raman spectroscopy using several equipment (laboratory set-up vs. portable) and excitation sources (632. 8, 532, 473. 1 nm). Colored natural species showed characteristic Raman double peak indicating pigment belonging to the carotenoid family, with C-C (ν 2) and C=C (ν 1) stretching modes at 1159 cm- 1 and at 1516 cm- 1. Overtones and combination modes are observed for all species up to > 4000 cm- 1 at 473 nm, in resonance conditions. The ν 2 and ν 1 frequencies depend on the polyene chain length, i. e. on the number N of the conjugated double bonds. The Raman spectra of pinkish pearls may be interpreted {{on the basis of a}} mixture of polyene pigments with different chain lengths. A linear relationship between ν 1 and ν 2 and a simple approximate rule for their dependence on N: ν 1 = 254 * 103 /(N+ 157); ν 2 = 189 * 103 /(N+ 157) has been proposed [1]. On this basis, contributions from N= 6 to N= 11 may be found by peak deconvolution. Polyenes have been identified as responsible of color in freshwater and saltwater pinkish and yellowish pearls; finally, in some Chinese freshwater pearls Raman spectra suggested the use of synthetic dyes.

40|$|The new mineral abellaite (IMA 2014 - 111), ideally NaPb 2 (CO 3) 2 (OH), is a {{supergene}} mineral {{that was}} found {{in one of the}} galleries of the long-disused Eureka mine, in the southern Pyrenees (Lleida province), Catalonia, Spain. Abellaite is found as sparse coatings {{on the surface of the}} primary mineralization, it forms subhedral crystals not larger than 10 mm as well as larger pseudohexagonal platelets up to ∼ 30 μm. Individual crystals commonly have a tabular to lamellar habit and form fairly disordered aggregates. The mineral is associated with a large number of primary minerals (roscoelite, pyrite, uraninite, coffinite, 'carbon', galena, sphalerite, nickeloan cobaltite, covellite, tennantite and chalcopyrite) and supergene minerals (hydrozincite, aragonite, gordaite, As-rich vanadinite andersonite, čejkaite, malachite and devilline). Abellaite is colourless to white, with a vitreous to nacreous lustre. The mineral is translucent, has a white streak and is non-fluorescent. The aggregates of microcrystals are highly friable. The calculated density using the ideal formula is 5. 93 g/cm 3. The chemical composition of the mineral (the mean of 10 electron microprobe analyses) is - Na 3. 88, Ca 0. 29, Pb 72. 03, C 4. 17, O 19. 47 and H 0. 17, total 100. 00 wt% (H, C and O by stoichiometry assuming the ideal formula). On the basis of 7 O atoms, the empirical formula of abellaite is Na 0. 96 Ca 0. 04 Pb 1. 98 (CO 3) 2 (OH). The simplified formula of the mineral is NaPb 2 (CO 3) 2 (OH). The mineral is hexagonal, space group P 63 mc, a = 5. 254 (2), c = 13. 450 (5) Å, V= 321. 5 (2) Å 3 and Z = 2. The strongest powder-diffraction lines [d in Å (I) (h k l) ] are: 3. 193 (100) (0 1 3), 2. 627 (84) (1 1 0), 2. 275 (29) (0 2 0), 2. 242 (65) (0 2 1, 0 0 6), 2. 029 (95) (0 2 3). Abellaite has a known synthetic analogue, and the crystal structure of the mineral was refined by using crystallographic data of the synthetic phase. The mineral is named in honour of the mineralogist and <b>gemmologist</b> Joan Abella i Creus (b. 1968), who has long studied the deposits of the Eureka mine and who collected the mineral. © 2017 E.
