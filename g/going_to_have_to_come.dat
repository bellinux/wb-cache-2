The live titles, {{you have to put}} something like that. So, we were watching Bill O'Reilly and we kept listening to him say, 'Fuck it, we'll do it live.' That's kind of how quick we threw that DVD together. We didn't know we were putting it together like 4 days before so we were like, 'fuck it, we'll do it live.' We didn't do any overdubs on it, everybody in the band was sick and we just went with it." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{an effort}} to {{crossover}} with music listeners outside of reggae's market, Sly and Robbie heightened their experimentation with other musical sounds, particularly funk and occasional hip hop music. Despite his eclectic output, Laswell himself had {{started out as a}} bass player in funk groups, an experience that inspired him to compose his musical arrangements with a rhythmic foundation. Dunbar explained their approach for the album in an interview for Musician at the time, saying that [...] "We're trying to get new fans. Once they come into the funk, they're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> into the reggae, because that's where we're going to take them." [...] Sly and Robbie's direction was also influenced by the supervision of Blackwell who, according to Dunbar, [...] "wanted us to make two tracks, 17 minutes long. So we cut two tracks and extended them, each side consisting of three songs. Non-stop dancing, that's the idea." ...|$|E
40|$|In late 2006, {{shortly before}} the end of his tenure as {{secretary}} of defense, Donald Rumsfeld made the following remark regarding the ongoing U. S. role in Iraq: “The biggest mistake would be not to pass things over to the Iraqis. It’s their country. They’re <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> govern it. They’re <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> provide security for it. And they’re <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> do it sooner rather than later. ” This remark is striking for its ahistorical crassness and demonstrated a striking amount of chutzpah even by Secretary Rumsfeld’s standards. However, it also raises some interesting questions about sovereignty and responsibility in foreign affairs...|$|R

[...] He also criticized Bush's White House Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives saying, [...] "This is basically the Department of Religious Outreach.... It's essentially a public-relations outreach arm for the Bush administration {{to reach out to the}} far right of the evangelical Christian movement. That's really all it is." ...|$|E
2500|$|Those {{who were}} {{involved}} in the NATO airstrikes have stood by the decision to take such action. U.S President Bill Clinton's Secretary of Defense, William Cohen, said, [...] "The appalling accounts of mass killing in Kosovo and the pictures of refugees fleeing Serb oppression for their lives makes it clear that this is a fight for justice over genocide." [...] On CBS' Face the Nation Cohen claimed, [...] "We've now seen about 100,000 military-aged men missing. ... They may have been murdered." [...] Clinton, citing the same figure, spoke of [...] "at least 100,000 (Kosovar Albanians) missing". Later, Clinton said about Yugoslav elections, [...] "they're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> to grips with what Mr. Milošević ordered in Kosovo. ... They're going to have to decide whether they support his leadership or not; whether they think it's OK that all those tens of thousands of people were killed. ..." [...] In the same press conference, Clinton also claimed [...] "NATO stopped deliberate, systematic efforts at ethnic cleansing and genocide." [...] Clinton compared the events of Kosovo to the Holocaust. CNN reported, [...] "Accusing Serbia of 'ethnic cleansing' in Kosovo similar to the genocide of Jews in World War II, an impassioned Clinton sought Tuesday to rally public support for his decision to send U.S. forces into combat against Yugoslavia, a prospect that seemed increasingly likely with the breakdown of a diplomatic peace effort." [...] President Clinton's State Department also claimed Serbian troops had committed genocide. The New York Times reported, [...] "the Administration said evidence of 'genocide' by Serbian forces was growing to include 'abhorrent and criminal action' on a vast scale. The language was the State Department's strongest up to that time in denouncing Yugoslav President Slobodan Milošević." [...] The State Department also gave the highest estimate of dead Albanians. In May 1996, Defense Secretary William Cohen suggested that there might be up to 100,000 Albanian fatalities." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{costs of}} filming Titanic {{eventually}} began to mount and finally reached $200million. Fox executives panicked and suggested {{an hour of}} specific cuts from the three-hour film.
