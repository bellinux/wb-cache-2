500|$|Kevin Clash {{was born}} in Baltimore, Maryland, on September 17, 1960, the third of four {{children}} born to George Clash, a <b>flash</b> <b>welder</b> and handyman, and Gladys Clash, who ran a small daycare center in their two-bedroom, one-bath home in the Turner Station of Dundalk, Maryland. [...] Clash developed an interest in puppetry at an early age, inspired by children's shows like Kukla, Fran and Ollie and Sesame Street. [...] He made his first puppet, a version of Mickey Mouse, {{at the age of}} 10. [...] When he was twelve, he created a monkey puppet out of the lining of his father's coat. [...] His first performances were for his mother's daycare children.|$|E

50|$|Welders can get {{a painful}} {{condition}} called arc eye. While it is caused by bright light as is <b>flash</b> blindness, the <b>welder's</b> arc lasts for much longer than a flash, and emits ultraviolet rays that can damage the cornea. Flash blindness, in contrast, {{is caused by a}} single very brief exposure which oversaturates the retina, and is not usually accompanied by reports of pain.|$|R
50|$|The injury may be {{prevented}} by wearing eye protection that blocks {{most of the}} ultraviolet radiation, such as welding goggles with the proper filters, a welder's helmet, sunglasses rated for sufficient UV protection, or appropriate snow goggles. The condition is usually managed by removal from the source of ultraviolet radiation, covering the corneas, and administration of pain relief. Photokeratitis is known {{by a number of}} different terms including: snow blindness, arc eye, <b>welder's</b> <b>flash,</b> bake eyes, corneal flash burns, sand man's eye, flash burns, niphablepsia, potato eye, or keratoconjunctivitis photoelectrica.|$|R
40|$|Subject: To compare {{usage of}} bandage contact lens (BCL) and eye {{patching}} on treatment of patient’s {{signs and symptoms}} with ultraviolet (UV) light exposure photo keratitis. Method: This prospective study included 32 patients with bilateral UV photo keratitis, due to <b>welder’s</b> <b>flash</b> with equal severity. After primary evaluation BCL is placed for one eye and patching is done for another one. Reexamination performed after 12 to 24 hours and severity of pain, Superficial Punctate Keratopathy (SPK) and duration of symptom improvement compared in both eyes. Results: Our findings revealed that SPK and duration of improvement were not different statistically significant but were more satisfied and comfortable with BCL. Conclusion: According to this study, BCL can use in patients with photo keratitis instead of eye patchin...|$|R
