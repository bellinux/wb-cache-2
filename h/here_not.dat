25|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{remarkable}} large-scale example of Rococo church building was the Frauenkirche at Dresden, recently rebuilt after its almost total destruction in World War II. The entire structures embodies a dynamic, surging motion which combines with a delicacy of architectural detail that {{is typical of the}} Rococo style. This church is dominated by its bell-shaped cupola which imitates in form those to be found on countless church towers in the region, but recreated <b>here</b> <b>not</b> in wood sheathed with metal, but as a mighty masonry dome.|$|E

25|$|Dances & Marches for the Orphan Age {{was created}} {{over a period}} of seven years. The {{preference}} of uneven or incomplete rhythms is hard to miss. The dominant female melodic vocals assumes a distinctly sorrowful voice, sometimes non-verbal with a transcendental character, and the most important instrument <b>here,</b> <b>not</b> by its predominance, but by its content, is the organ, which has the role of disquieting and dramatizing the figurative, fierily symbolism of Saivon's lyrics. The album was released after extensive remixes by Vladimír Hirsch in March 2005 by the Portugal label Dagaz Music.|$|E
25|$|Indirect free-kicks {{can throw}} a defence into {{confusion}} when taken quickly, or in unexpected directions. The third goal of Brazil's 1970 World Cup victory over Italy illustrates the method. Brazil's midfield general Gerson Nunes approached rapidly and lofted the dead ball {{in a high}} arc almost from the midfield line. It found Pele perfectly positioned near the Italian goal. The Brazilian headed down softly and accurately, straight {{into the path of}} the onrushing winger Jairzinho, who virtually walked the ball into the net. Italy's catenaccio defence was caught out of position <b>here,</b> <b>not</b> only failing to neutralise Pele, but providing little cover to stop Jairzinho. A rapid, daring set-piece kick will often accomplish this unbalancing of defences.|$|E
25|$|Ruiz’s {{work does}} focus on race issues, {{considering}} she calls for “an essential Latin ‘difference,’ believing Latinos to be culturally and morally superior,” but her work also encompasses political issues. She warns against U.S. expansionism and corporate monopolies. For instance, in both her novels, she feminizes the male characters in order “to depict the subordinated status of those ‘handicapped’ by societal constraints”. These male characters are hurt by forces of decay and corruption. For example, in Squatter and the Don, the Californio men are victim to both illnesses and land loss {{because of the}} government. This novel centers on {{the corruption of the}} United States government due to the combination of capitalism with democracy. Ruiz paints the enemy <b>here</b> <b>not</b> to be the squatters, but the railroad barons. Even the Alamars and the Darrells, who in the end foster true love and marriage despite race, fall victim to the railroad barons.|$|E

25|$|But now {{suppose that}} the {{electrons}} in the experiment are subject to electric or magnetic fields. For example, if an electric field was imposed {{on one side of}} the axis but not on the other, the results of the experiment would be affected. The part of the electron wave passing through that side oscillates at a different rate, since its energy has had −eV added to it, where −e is the charge of the electron and V the electrical potential. The results of the experiment will be different, because phase relationships between the two parts of the electron wave have changed, and therefore the locations of constructive and destructive interference will be shifted to one side or the other. It is the electric potential that occurs <b>here,</b> <b>not</b> the electric field, and this is a manifestation of the fact that it is the potentials and not the fields that are of fundamental significance in quantum mechanics.|$|E
25|$|The German cruisers Scharnhorst and Gneisenau {{hastened to}} Samoa after Admiral von Spee {{learned of the}} occupation. He arrived off Apia on 14 September 1914, {{three days after the}} {{departure}} of the last of the Allied cruisers and transports. The approach of the German ships was observed and the New Zealanders promptly manned their defences while many civilians, fearing exchanges of gunfire, made for the hills. By this stage artillery has been set up on the beach but there was no exchange of gunfire. One historian, Ian McGibbon, wrote that this was likely due to von Spee's fears of damage to German property should he open fire. Instead, von Spee steamed off and landed a small party further down the coast and learned from a German resident there the apparent strength of the occupation. Patrols dispatched to the area later interned the German resident. According to the historian J. A. C. Gray, von Spee considered a landing by the forces under his control would only be of temporary advantage in an Allied-dominated sea and so the German ships then made for Tahiti, a French possession. <b>Here,</b> <b>not</b> having to be concerned with the welfare of the local population and their property, von Spee would direct the bombardment of Papeete. He then rejoined the rest of his fleet and headed for South America.|$|E

500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the novel, the General is 46years old and slowly dying on his last journey to the port of Cartagena de Indias, where he plans to set sail for Europe. As Palencia-Roth notes, [...] "Bolívar is cast <b>here</b> <b>not</b> only as a victim but as an agent of Latin America's tragic political flaws". The fortunes of the historical Simón Bolívar began to decline in 1824 after the victory of his general Antonio José de Sucre at Ayacucho. The novel draws {{on the fact that the}} historical Bolívar never remarried after the death of his wife, María Teresa Rodríguez del Toro y Alayza. García Márquez uses other documented facts as starting points for his fictional portrait of Bolívar–for example, his dedication to the army above all else, his premature aging, and his bad temper. Of the latter, Bolívar's aide-de-camp O'Leary once remarked that [...] "his imperious and impatient temperament would never tolerate the smallest delay in the execution of an order".|$|E
500|$|Variety {{magazine}} called the film [...] "well-executed and original", praising the performances, and the editing by Gerry Hambling. Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader wrote, [...] "If [...] can't resist the occasional fancy or cutesy flourishes... {{that tend to}} compromise his work, he still allows his material to exist on its own level and makes it fun to watch." [...] Hal Hinson of The Washington Post wrote that the film was [...] "a deadly funny movie; nearly every scene is broken off with a punch line. But Parker's sense of comedy is organic; he never lets the jokes elbow the characters, or the music, out of the spotlight." [...] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times wrote, [...] "... Parker has loosened up quite a bit <b>here,</b> <b>not</b> forcing the action {{as much as he}} did in the similar Fame and bringing a surprisingly loony touch to characters like Jimmy's Elvis-obsessed father." [...] Time magazine reviewer Richard Corliss wrote, [...] "The film offers no message, no solutions, only a great time at the movies." ...|$|E

500|$|According to Greg Forman from The Post and Courier, {{the album}} shows that [...] "There's an {{important}} difference between {{having a great}} voice and being a great singer. Whitney Houston or Mariah Carey can sing circles (and octaves) around the most famous woman on the planet, but Madonna, through sheer force of personality sells her slow numbers with a panache few modern singers can match." [...] John Wirt from The Advocate said that the album shows that Madonna [...] "can craft slow songs as effectively as she knocks out dance numbers" [...] and found [...] "an unaffected simplicity and sincerity" [...] in her ballad singing. Writing for The Baltimore Sun, J. D. Considine believed that with the album [...] "Madonna not only reminds us that there's more to her music than dance tunes, but also demonstrates that her voice is nowhere near as thin and chirpy as her detractors imagine." [...] He further explained, [...] "one {{of the most amazing}} things about the album is how sultry and assured she sounds... The Madonna on display <b>here</b> <b>not</b> only has a richer, deeper voice than you imagined, but more interpretive insight as well." ...|$|E
500|$|Before long, {{all three}} of her daughters became active with the WSPU. Christabel was arrested after {{spitting}} at a policeman during {{a meeting of the}} Liberal Party in October 1905; Adela and Sylvia were arrested a year later during a protest outside Parliament. Pankhurst was arrested {{for the first time in}} February 1908, when she tried to enter Parliament to deliver a protest resolution to Prime Minister H. H. Asquith. She was charged with obstruction and sentenced to six weeks in prison. She spoke out against the conditions of her confinement, including vermin, meagre food, and the [...] "civilised torture of solitary confinement and absolute silence" [...] to which she and others were ordered. Pankhurst saw imprisonment as a means to publicise the urgency of women's suffrage; in June 1909 she struck a police officer twice in the face to ensure she would be arrested. Pankhurst was arrested seven times before women's suffrage was approved. During her trial on 21 October 1908 she told the court: [...] "We are <b>here</b> <b>not</b> because we are law-breakers; we are here in our efforts to become law-makers." ...|$|E
500|$|To avoid a {{scheduling}} {{conflict with}} Revolutionary Road, Winslet {{turned down an}} offer to star in The Reader. After her replacement Nicole Kidman left the project due to her pregnancy, Winslet was signed to it. Directed by Stephen Daldry, The Reader is based on Bernhard Schlink's novel {{of the same name}} and is about Hanna Schmitz, an illiterate Nazi camp guard (Winslet), who has an affair with a teenage boy. Winslet researched on the Holocaust and the SS guards, and was traumatised by what she learnt. To educate herself on the stigma attached to illiteracy, she spent time with students at the Literacy Partners, an organisation that teaches adults to read and write. A merkin was designed for her frontal nude scenes, but she refused to wear it. Winslet was unable to sympathise with Schmitz, saying that [...] "there was nothing of her that I could relate to", and struggled to find [...] "honesty and truthfulness" [...] to the part without humanising her actions. Despite this, certain historians criticised the film for making Schmitz an object of audience's sympathy and accused the filmmakers of Holocaust revisionism. Even so, Winslet's performance was acclaimed; the critic Todd McCarthy commended her for supplying [...] "a haunting shell to this internally decimated woman", and writing for The Daily Telegraph, Sukhdev Sandhu considered her to be [...] "absolutely fearless <b>here,</b> <b>not</b> just in her willingness to expose herself physically, but her refusal to expose her character psychologically".|$|E

500|$|Hartman {{became one}} of the stars of the NBC sitcom NewsRadio in 1995, portraying radio news anchor Bill McNeal. He signed up after being {{attracted}} by the show's writing and use of an ensemble cast, and joked that he based McNeal on himself with [...] "any ethics and character" [...] removed. Hartman made roughly $50,000 per episode of NewsRadio. Although the show was critically acclaimed, it was never a ratings hit and cancellation was a regular threat. After the completion of the fourth season, Hartman commented, [...] "We seem to have limited appeal. We're on the edge <b>here,</b> <b>not</b> sure we're going to be picked up or not", but added he was [...] "99percent sure" [...] the series would be renewed for a fifth season. Hartman had publicly lambasted NBC's decision to repeatedly move NewsRadio into different timeslots, but later regretted his comments, saying, [...] "this is a sitcom, for crying out loud, not brain surgery". He also stated that if the sitcom were cancelled [...] "it just will open up other opportunities for me". Although the show was renewed for a fifth season, Hartman died before production began. Ken Tucker praised Hartman's performance as McNeal: [...] "A lesser performer [...] would have played him as a variation on The Mary Tyler Moore Shows Ted Baxter, because that's what Bill was, on paper. But Hartman gave infinite variety to Bill's self-centeredness, turning him devious, cowardly, squeamish, and foolishly bold from week to week." [...] Hartman was posthumously nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series in 1998 for his work on NewsRadio, but lost to David Hyde Pierce.|$|E
