5|$|As of 2012, 57% {{of women}} of childbearing age want to avoid {{pregnancy}} (867 of 1520million). About 222 million women however were not able to access birth control, 53million of whom were <b>in</b> <b>sub-Saharan</b> <b>Africa</b> and 97million of whom were in Asia. This results in 54million unplanned pregnancies and nearly 80,000 maternal deaths a year. Part of the reason that many women are without birth control is that many countries limit access due to religious or political reasons, while another contributor is poverty. Due to restrictive abortion laws <b>in</b> <b>Sub-Saharan</b> <b>Africa,</b> many women turn to unlicensed abortion providers for unintended pregnancy, resulting in about 2–4% obtaining unsafe abortions each year.|$|E

5|$|Large scale {{changes in}} weather {{patterns}} {{may also have}} been caused by global dimming. Climate modelers speculatively suggest that this reduction in solar radiation at the surface may have led to the failure of the monsoon <b>in</b> <b>sub-Saharan</b> <b>Africa</b> during the 1970s and 1980s, together with the associated famines such as the Sahel drought, caused by Northern hemisphere pollution cooling the Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|The Nok {{civilisation}} of Northern Nigeria flourished between 500 BC and AD 200, producing life-sized terracotta {{figures that}} {{are some of}} the earliest known sculptures <b>in</b> <b>Sub-Saharan</b> <b>Africa.</b> Further north, the cities Kano and Katsina have a recorded history dating to around 999 AD.

5|$|A {{number of}} factors make people more {{susceptible}} to TB infections. The most important risk factor globally is HIV; 13% of all people with TB are infected by the virus. This is a particular problem <b>in</b> <b>sub-Saharan</b> <b>Africa,</b> where rates of HIV are high. Of people without HIV who are infected with tuberculosis, about 5–10% develop active disease during their lifetimes; in contrast, 30% of those coinfected with HIV develop the active disease.|$|E

5|$|The human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) is the virus that – when the infection is not treated – can cause AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome).

5|$|Circumcision has a {{protective}} effect against {{the risks of}} penile cancer in men, and cervical cancer in the female sexual partners of heterosexual men.
