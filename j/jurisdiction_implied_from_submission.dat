50|$|Another {{division}} that is sometimes made is between overt consent and tacit consent. Overt consent, to be valid, would require voluntariness, a specific {{act on the}} part of the consenters, a particular act consented to, and specific agents who perform this action. Immigrating into a particular jurisdiction is sometimes regarded as an overt act indicating consent to be ruled by that jurisdiction's government. Not all who are ruled by a particular government have immigrated to that jurisdiction, however; some were born there; however others argue that the power to emigrate from (i.e. leave) a <b>jurisdiction</b> <b>implies</b> such consent omission.|$|R

40|$|The {{establishment}} of the intendencia system in the West Indies was a complex process. An analysis of the decision-making process enables us to highlight some of its major characteristics. We argue that decision-making was not only limited by royal approval, but involved strategic, tactical and operational aspects. The creation of intendencias was adapted to the local circumstances of the particular region of the West Indies. This flexibility also transformed the nature of intendencias, since those created by the Marquis of Esquilache {{did not have the}} same objectives as those created by José de Gálvez. On the whole, these new <b>jurisdictions</b> <b>implied</b> a new vision of Superior Gobierno...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} equilibrium {{properties of}} local <b>jurisdictions</b> <b>implied</b> by the Tiebout-style model. A set of equilibrium conditions {{are derived from}} a general equilibrium model of local jurisdictions. The conditions are parameterized and empirically estimated in a two-stage procedure. The method is applied to communities in a Portland metropolitan area with an extension of public-good provision to include environmental amenities. The {{results suggest that the}} model can replicate many of the empirical regularities observed in the data. For example, the predicted income distributions across communities closely matched the observed distribution. The estimated income elasticity of housing demand is consistent with previous findings. One important finding of this paper is that the parameter estimates would be biased if environmental amenities are not considered. Environmental Economics and Policy,...|$|R
