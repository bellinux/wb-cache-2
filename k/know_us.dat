The show at Folk City was not a success, because [...] "The Replacements were so loud and obnoxious that the people just cleared right out," [...] according to manager Jesperson. The band supported R.E.M. on an eight-date tour later that summer, deciding that they should alienate the audience as much as possible. It was not a successful tour; by the end, various members had threatened to leave the Replacements.

2500|$|Selma {{is caught}} and {{eventually}} put on trial. It {{is here that}} she is pegged as a Communist sympathizer and murderess. Although she tells as much truth about the situation as she can, she refuses to reveal Bill's secret, saying that she had promised not to. Additionally, when her claim that the reason she didn't have any money was {{because she had been}} sending it to her father in Czechoslovakia is proven false, she is convicted and given the death penalty. Cvalda and Jeff eventually put the pieces of the puzzle together and get back Selma's money, using it instead to pay for a trial lawyer who can free her. Selma becomes furious and refuses the lawyer, opting to face the death penalty rather than let her son go blind, but she is deeply distraught as she awaits her death. Although a sympathetic female prison guard named Brenda tries to comfort her, the other state officials show no feelings and are eager to see her executed. Brenda encourages Selma to walk. On her way to the gallows, Selma goes to hug the other men on death row while singing to them. However, on the gallows, she becomes terrified, so that she must be strapped to a collapse board. Her hysteria when the hood is placed over her face delays the execution. Selma begins crying hysterically and Brenda cries with her, but Cvalda rushes to inform her that the operation was successful and that Gene will see. Relieved, Selma sings the final song on the gallows with no musical accompaniment, although she is hanged before she finishes. A curtain is then drawn in front of her body, while the missing part of the song shows on the screen: [...] "They say it's the last song/They don't <b>know</b> <b>us,</b> you see/It's only the last song/If we let it be." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} line-up, {{formed in}} May 1999, consisted of Adam Easterbrook, Karl Sabino, Ian Johnsen and Mark Nicholas. They played their first gig in October supporting Guided By Voices at the Bristol Flee & Firkin. Debut single [...] "A Dull Today is Darker Yesterday's Bright Tomorrow" [...] {{was released in}} June 2000 on {{what appeared to be}} a one-sided 7" [...] single, although the silent b-side, included as a bonus track on their first CD album, was later revealed to be a 'cover' of Crass's [...] "The Sound of Free Speech". Another early gig was in New York City [...] followed by shows supporting bands such as Beachwood Sparks, And You Will <b>Know</b> <b>Us</b> By The Trail Of Dead, Cheap Trick and further dates with Guided By Voices. In November 2001 the band released the single [...] "Gadfly Adolescence", which was described by NME as 'a magnificent debut from these shamelessly prog-tinged guitar alchemists, running the gamut of classic English teen anthems from [...] "Pinball Wizard" [...] to [...] "All The Young Dudes" [...] to [...] "Eton Rifles" [...] and beyond...a heady mix of ragged riffs, symphonic song structures and heart-tugging lyrics about lazy childhood summers spent [...] "deep in the gloaming".' This song was re-recorded for the group's debut album The Spring Heel Penny Dreadful & Other Tales of Morbid Curiosity, released in May 2003 by the indie label Must Destroy who were at the time finding success with one of their other signings, The Darkness. Opening song [...] "I Are Becoming Instinct" [...] was also released as a single. The album's sequencing was influenced by Guided By Voices' Bee Thousand, The Beatles' The White Album and Faust's The Faust Tapes and was championed by Julian Cope ('The best and most disconcerting psychedelia I’ve heard these past coupla years ... managed to heft several vats of raw Faust in the direction of post-Oasis Beatlemania'), and DJ John Peel who invited them to record a session for his Radio One show. The album also garnered positive reviews in Mojo ('Crunchy, punchy, proggy - and very English ... how lovely to see rock still has a decent vocabulary') ...|$|E
