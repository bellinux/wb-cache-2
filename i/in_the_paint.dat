5|$|Forgeries {{in which}} modern lead or white lead pigment {{has been used}} can be {{recognized}} by using a technique called Pb(Lead)-210-Dating. Pb-210 is a naturally occurring radioactive isotope of lead {{that is part of}} the uranium-238 Radioactive decay series, and has a half-life of 22.3 years. To determine the amount of Pb-210, the alpha radiation emitted by another element, polonium-210 (Po-210), is measured. Thus it is possible to estimate the age of a painting, within a few years' span, by extrapolating the Pb-210 content present <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>paint</b> used to create the painting.|$|E
5|$|The North Carolina Tar Heels were {{coached by}} Frank McGuire, {{who was in}} his fifth season as {{head coach of the}} Tar Heels. His {{offensive}} philosophy was centered around passing before shooting. McGuire's starting line up and most of the roster consisted of players primarily from around the New York area. Tommy Kearns and Pete Brennan were two offensive specialists. Center Joe Quigg provided a solid presence <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>paint</b> and grabbed almost nine rebounds per game. Guard Bob Cunningham was one of the teams best defensive players. The team was led by Lennie Rosenbluth who averaged almost twentyeight points a game and served as the team's clutch performer.|$|E

5|$|The cousins {{went back}} to the {{farmhouse}} to search for the source of the red paint on the silencer. In the kitchen they found marks in the red paint {{on the underside of the}} mantelpiece above the Aga cooker. DI Cook, a scenes-of-crime officer, took a paint sample from the mantelpiece on 14 August. This was found to contain the same 15 layers of paint and varnish that were <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>paint</b> flake found on the silencer. Casts were taken of the marks on the mantel, and the marks were deemed consistent with the silencer having come into contact several times with the mantelpiece. The implication was that the silencer had scratched the mantelpiece during a fight for the gun.|$|E
5|$|The {{panels of}} Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion are painted on light Sundeala boards, a {{material}} Bacon was using {{at the time}} as an inexpensive alternative to canvas. Each bears a single taut sculptural form pitched against a harsh orange background. The orange hue displays inconsistently across the canvasses, {{due in part to the}} low level of oil <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>paint,</b> which resulted in varying rates of absorption into the board. The pallid flesh tones of the figures were achieved by overlaying grey and white brushstrokes, while the figures' props were coloured using a variety of yellow, green, white, and purple tones.|$|E
5|$|During the {{following}} possession, Harp changed Jayhawks' defense to a mantoman. The change in defense caused the Tar Heels {{to become more}} active on offense with several screens and movement on offense. The possession resulted in an off the ball foul that sent Rosenbluth to the free throw line where he made both shots. Kansas pushed the ball up the court quickly with King, who took an eight-foot shot and Carolina collected the rebound and continued to slow the tempo in the half court as Kansas shifted back into a 23 zone. The Tar Heels passed the ball back and forth until the Jayhawks broke from their zone and went into a mantoman again. Kearns made a close quarters shot <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>paint.</b> Kansas stepped up their defense {{at the behest of}} coach Harp and held Carolina scoreless for two minutes. During the period, Kansas made four free throws to cut their deficit to two points, with the score being 1917. The Tar Heels continued to slow the pace and work the ball around to get the open shot, while the Jayhawks would rush up the court and attempt to give the ball to Chamberlain before taking a poor shot. This resulted in moderate success for both teams as North Carolina scored eight points to Kansas' three before the final two minutes began. In the closing two minutes, the two teams would both score two free throws to bring the score to 2922 in favor of North Carolina.|$|E

However, the Illini responded with an 80–71 advantage {{to take control of the}} game. The Bulldogs recovered from their first loss of the season by beating Kansas State in the annual State Farm Battle in Seattle game, 68–52. The team outscored Kansas State <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>paint</b> 38–12 and limited the Wildcats to 33 percent shooting. Olynyk led the team with 20 points, while Bell added 11 points.

25|$|Having {{exhausted}} the I-series plates, in November 1977, reflective green-on-white {{plates were}} introduced, beginning at AAA-000 and running to FZZ-999, and then skipping to a brief run of RAA-000 to RBZ-999 in 1994, bearing the slogan Victoria – Garden State {{at the bottom}} of the plate initiated by the then premier Rupert Hamer. In the early 1990s, it was discovered that the reflective properties of many registration plates in the range from AAA-000 to EZZ-999, and the principally the C-series, were defective and this had coincided with the rapid introduction of traffic enforcement cameras in Victoria. Due to the number of plates which were unidentifiable in photographs, all defective plates were recalled and new plates issued free of charge. This caused the rapid consumption of the plate stocks especially late in the F-series and some plates (those starting with FVA-000 to FVZ-999 and FYA-000 to FYZ-999) were produced in Queensland to meet demand. These plates are identifiable by their different embossed dies and vertical diamond separator (as opposed to Victoria's horizontal diamond). It is a popular myth that the defective paint was caused by prisoners manufacturing the plates urinating <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>paint</b> mixture.|$|E
25|$|On January 17, the Bulldogs went on {{the road}} to play Portland, whom they beat 71–49. Despite two early fouls on Olynyk in the first half, Gonzaga shot 46.6% from the field. Olynyk would come back with a strong second half to finish with 21 points, eight rebounds, one steal, and two blocks. The game {{extended}} Gonzaga's best start in school history with an eight-game winning streak. Two days later, they would travel to Hinkle Fieldhouse to play a non-conference game at #13 Butler {{as a part of the}} debut game of ESPN's College GameDay for the 2013 college basketball season. Gonzaga was ahead 33–32 at halftime, but Butler scored the first five points of the second half to take the lead. Ahead 63–62 with 3.5 seconds left, Stockton threw the ball inbounds and watched as it was stolen by Butler sophomore Roosevelt Jones, who took the buzzer beater shot to give Butler the 64–63 win. The team would recover and return home from their second loss of the season on January 24 by beating BYU 83–63. Olynyk scored 26 points on 9-for-9 shooting and was also 8-for-8 on free throws. The Zags won the rebound battle 37–29 and outscored BYU 42–28 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>paint</b> while shooting 56.9% from the field.|$|E
25|$|Six {{days after}} North Carolina avenged their earlier loss at Duke in February with a 90-83 {{victory at the}} Dean Dome, the two teams would face off in the semifinals of the ACC Tournament, this time in Brooklyn, New York in the Barclays Center.

North Carolina {{controlled}} the first half by outscoring Duke <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>paint</b> 32-10, with North Carolina's Kennedy Meeks leading the charge. North Carolina led by as many as 13 points and threatened to turn the game into a blowout, but Duke's Grayson Allen made four 3-pointers to get Duke within 7 points at the half, with North Carolina leading 49-42. In the second half, with North Carolina leading Duke 56-48 with 15:04 left, North Carolina's Joel Berry II picked up his fourth foul, which forced North Carolina to take him out of the game. Though North Carolina led by 13 points at 61-48 with 13:53 remaining, Duke used a 20-4 run over the next five minutes, thanks to steals and three-pointers from Duke's Jayson Tatum and Luke Kennard, to put Duke up 68-65 over North Carolina with 8:24 left. Duke then pulled away and won 93-83 to complete a 45-22 run over North Carolina in the final 14 minutes of the game.|$|E
