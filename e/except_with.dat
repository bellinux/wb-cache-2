5|$|In May 2006, former Sports Illustrated writer Jeff Pearlman {{released}} a revealing biography of Bonds entitled Love Me, Hate Me: Barry Bonds and the Making of an Anti-Hero. The book also contained many allegations against Bonds. The book, which describes Bonds as a polarizing insufferable braggart with a legendary ego and staggering ability, relied on over five hundred interviews, <b>except</b> <b>with</b> Bonds himself.|$|E
5|$|Outside {{of hockey}} Stuart {{worked as a}} bricklayer, and later in his life he also worked with his father in construction.

5|$|The current Emperor's flag is a 16-petal chrysanthemum, colored in gold, {{centered}} on a red background with a 2:3 ratio. The Empress uses the same flag, except the shape {{is that of a}} swallow tail. The crown prince and the crown princess use the same flags, <b>except</b> <b>with</b> a smaller chrysanthemum and a white border {{in the middle of the}} flags. The chrysanthemum has been associated with the Imperial throne since the rule of Emperor Go-Toba in the 12th century, but it did not become the exclusive symbol of the Imperial throne until 1868.|$|E
5|$|The pale {{crag martin}} is much drabber than most African swallows, and {{confusion}} is unlikely <b>except</b> <b>with</b> other crag martins or with sand martins {{of the genus}} Riparia. It is 15% smaller, paler and greyer than the Eurasian crag martin, and has smaller tail spots. It is smaller, paler, and has a more contrasting throat than the rock martin. In the far east of its range, the pale crag martin always has lighter underparts than the dusky crag martin. Although only slightly larger than the sand martin and brown-throated sand martin, the pale crag martin is more robust, has white tail spots, and lacks a breast band. Separation of similar species in flight may be complicated by the difficulty of judging colours accurately in strong desert light, particularly with juveniles. The fast flight of the brown-throated sand martin also makes identification more difficult.|$|E
5|$|Through {{studies of}} carbon isotope ratios (similar to the {{methodology}} used in carbon dating, <b>except</b> <b>with</b> the stable isotopes C-12 and C-13), {{it has been}} shown that the carbon found in diamonds comes from both inorganic and organic sources. Some diamonds, known as harzburgitic, are formed from inorganic carbon originally found deep in the Earth's mantle. In contrast, eclogitic diamonds contain organic carbon from organic detritus that has been pushed down from the surface of the Earth's crust through subduction (see plate tectonics) before transforming into diamond. These two different source of carbon have measurably different 13C:12C ratios. Diamonds that have come to the Earth's surface are generally quite old, ranging from under 1billion to 3.3billion years old. This is 22% to 73% of the age of the Earth.|$|E
