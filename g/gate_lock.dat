5000|$|Jacob Yates and the Pearly <b>Gate</b> <b>Lock</b> Pickers is a {{band from}} Glasgow, Scotland, fronted by Jake Lovatt, former front man with Uncle John & Whitelock.

50|$|In studies, gate evasion {{rate was}} found to be 1.5% {{unlocked}}, and only 0.8% when <b>locked.</b> Interestingly, unlocked <b>gates</b> also invite more “questionable” entries; rate was 1.8% unlocked, but only 0.9% <b>locked.</b> Keeping <b>gates</b> <b>locked</b> potentially halves gate-related evasions. Following this finding, NYCS reinstructed station supervisors and agents on importance and revenue impacts of keeping <b>gates</b> <b>locked.</b> Questionable <b>gate</b> entries decreased from 1.5% to 0.4% following this change, but illegal gate entries did not show statistically significant decrease when seasonality effects were accounted for. This measure seems to target mostly casual evasions.|$|R

50|$|Jacob Yates and the Pearly <b>Gate</b> <b>Lock</b> Pickers {{were formed}} in 2007 by Jake Lovatt, former front man with Uncle John & Whitelock. The band was {{initially}} a three-piece, consisting of Lovatt on vocals and guitar, Ric Holmes on bass guitar and Michael Bleazard on drums. This lineup was later augmented {{by the addition}} of former Uncle John & Whitelock member, Jamie Bolland, on keyboards and guitar. In 2011, former Paper Planes guitarist Christopher Haddow was added to the lineup.|$|E

5000|$|On December 16, 1937, a {{dense fog}} {{swept through the}} San Francisco Bay, impeding marine traffic and {{reducing}} visibility on Alcatraz Island. Cole and Roe were working in a tire repair shop. A routine headcount at 12:50 p.m. showed all prisoners accounted for. At the next count, at 1:30 p.m., {{the two men were}} gone. Two iron bars and three heavy glass panes of a window in the shop had a hole 8+3/4 in high and 18 in long. Once through the window, they slipped down to the gate of a high wire fence, concealed by the fog. With a wrench taken from the tire shop, they forced the <b>gate</b> <b>lock</b> and dropped twenty feet to a beach. Their trail vanished at that point.|$|E
40|$|Concurrent {{programs}} are well-known for containing errors {{that are difficult}} to detect, reproduce, and diagnose. Deadlock is a common concurrency error, which occurs when a set of threads are blocked, due to each attempting to acquire a lock held by another. This paper presents a collection of highly scalable static and dynamic techniques for exposing potential deadlocks. The basis is a known algorithm, which, when locks are acquired nestedly, captures the nesting order in a lock graph. A cycle in the graph indicates a deadlock potential. We propose three extensions to this basic algorithm in order to eliminate, or label as low severity, false warnings of possible deadlocks (“false positives”). These false positives may be due to cycles within one thread, cycles guarded by a <b>gate</b> <b>lock</b> (an enclosing lock that prevents deadlocks), and cycles involving several code fragments that cannot possibly execute in parallel. We also present a technique that combines information from multiple runs of the program into a single lock graph, to find deadlock potentials that would not be revealed by analyzing one run at a time. The paper finally describes the use of static analysis to automatically reduce the overhead of dynamic checking for deadlock potentials. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an improvement {{of a standard}} algorithm for detecting dead-lock potentials in multi-threaded programs, in that it reduces the number of false positives. The standard algorithm works as follows. The multi-threaded program under observation is executed, while lock and unlock events are observed. A graph of locks is built, with edges between locks symbolizing locking orders. Any cycle in the graph signifies a potential for a deadlock. The typical standard example is the group of dining philosophers sharing forks. The algorithm is interesting because it can catch deadlock potentials even though no deadlocks occur in the examined trace, {{and at the same}} time it scales very well in contrast t o more formal approaches to deadlock detection. The algorithm, however, can yield false positives (as well as false negatives). The extension of the algorithm described in this paper reduces the amount of false positives for three particular cases: when a <b>gate</b> <b>lock</b> protects a cycle, when a single thread introduces a cycle, and when the code segments in different threads that cause the cycle can actually not execute in parallel. The paper formalizes a theory for dynamic deadlock detection and compares it to model checking and static analysis techniques. It furthermore describes an implementation for analyzing Java programs and its application to two case studies: a planetary rover and a space craft altitude control system...|$|E

40|$|The Netherlands {{contains}} more than 400 hydraulic structures, of which 120 are locks. Inspections carried out since 2010 by Rijkswaterstaat revealed {{that a number of}} cracks per <b>lock</b> <b>gate</b> have been found. Based on experience and an evaluation of the photos made during the inspections it is assumed that the cracks occur due to fatigue. At this moment there is no good insight in the fatigue calculation of steel <b>lock</b> <b>gates.</b> The standard EUROCODE 3 used at the moment, has a part dedicated to fatigue strength, but describes that it is only applicable to structures in atmospheric conditions. As <b>lock</b> <b>gates</b> function in (sea) water conditions, it is questionable whether this standard can be used. Another aspect {{is that there is no}} guideline how to determine a load spectrum of forces on <b>lock</b> <b>gates.</b> The following topics are covered: a description of the forces on <b>lock</b> <b>gates,</b> a summation of the observations where cracks have been found, which part of the <b>lock</b> <b>gates</b> should be investigated and the standard that should be used and it’s limitations. Two calculations of fatigue damage based on a simplified model of the forces on <b>lock</b> <b>gates</b> are made. The first investigated case is the West lock of Sambeek and the second is the East lock of Terneuzen. For these <b>lock</b> <b>gates</b> the waterlevel spectrum is determined based on the waterlevel measurements of Rijkswaterstaat. From this spectrum a fatigue damage calculation is made. The results of the fatigue damage calculation based on the simplified schematisation of forces on <b>lock</b> <b>gates</b> did not match the fatigue cracks that have been found during the investigations. Some aspects causing this disparity might be that the schematisation of the <b>lock</b> <b>gate</b> is too simplified and the influence of waves is neglected. Another aspect that could influence the fatigue damage is the maintenance. A poor state of the wooden sealing at the back post, the coating layer and/or the cathodic protection system, could result in lower fatigue damage values. All these aspects have a negative influence on the S-N curve. The fatigue damage calculated with a simplified model cannot determine correct fatigue damage values. Therefore a FEM-model should be used to determine the stresses in the <b>lock</b> <b>gate.</b> The stresses in the <b>lock</b> <b>gate</b> itself should be monitored. A <b>lock</b> <b>gate</b> could be fitted with strain gauges to determine the real stresses in the <b>lock</b> <b>gate.</b> These real stresses could be compared with the result of the FEM-model and confirm the reliability of the FEM-model. Research on the influence of the salt and fresh water condition with or without cathodic protection should be done and rules included in the EUROCODE 3 on the influence of salt and fresh water.
