5000|$|An {{acoustic}} cloak is {{a hypothetical}} device {{that would make}} objects impervious towards sound waves. This {{could be used to}} build sound proof homes, advanced concert halls, or stealth warships. The mathematics and physics behind acoustic cloaking has been known for several years. The idea of acoustic cloaking is to deviate the sounds waves around the object that has to be cloaked. But realizing it in materials has been difficult, since mechanical metamaterials are needed. The key to this problem are acoustic metamaterials also known as [...] "Sonic Crystals". Making a metamaterial for sound means identifying the acoustic analogues to permittivity and permeability in light waves.

50|$|Consider an {{idealized}} rubber sheet suspended {{in a uniform}} gravitational field normal to the sheet.

The mass density may be viewed as intrinsic to the sheet or as belonging to objects resting on top of the sheet.This equilibrium condition is identical in form to the gravitational Poisson equationwhere Φ(x) is the gravitational potential and ρ(x) is the mass density. Thus, to a first approximation, a massive object placed on a rubber sheet will deform the sheet into a correctly shaped gravity well, and (as in the rigid case) a second test object placed near the first will gravitate toward it in an approximation of the correct force law.|$|E

40|$|In the {{residual}} stress measurement by X-ray or neutron diffraction, the diffraction <b>elastic</b> <b>constants</b> {{are essential to}} determine the stresses from measured lattice strains. Since the lattice strains of a particular lattice plane in the crystal grains are measured selectively, the diffraction <b>elastic</b> <b>constants</b> {{are different from the}} macroscopic constants of polycrystalline materials.

50|$|Crystals are {{somewhat}} sensitive to radiation damage. Natural quartz {{is much more}} sensitive than artificially grown crystals, and sensitivity can be further reduced by sweeping the crystal - heating the crystal to at least 400 °C in a hydrogen-free atmosphere in an electric field of at least 500 V/cm for at least 12 hours. Such swept crystals have a very low response to steady ionizing radiation. Some Si(IV) atoms are replaced with Al(III) impurities, each having a compensating Li+ or Na+ cation nearby. Ionization produces electron-hole pairs; the holes are trapped in the lattice near the Al atom, the resulting Li and Na atoms are loosely trapped along the Z axis; the change of the lattice near the Al atom and the corresponding <b>elastic</b> <b>constant</b> then causes a corresponding change in frequency. Sweeping removes the Li+ and Na+ ions from the lattice, reducing this effect. The Al3+ site can also trap hydrogen atoms. All crystals have a transient negative frequency shift after exposure to an X-ray pulse; the frequency then shifts gradually back; natural quartz reaches stable frequency after 10-1000 seconds, with a negative offset to pre-irradiation frequency, artificial crystals return to a frequency slightly lower or higher than pre-irradiation, swept crystals anneal virtually back to original frequency. The annealing is faster at higher temperatures. Sweeping under vacuum at higher temperatures and field strength can further reduce the crystal's response to X-ray pulses. Series resistance of unswept crystals increases after an X-ray dose, and anneals back to a somewhat higher value for a natural quartz (requiring a corresponding gain reserve in the circuit) and back to pre-irradiation value for synthetic crystals. Series resistance of swept crystals is unaffected. Increase of series resistance degrades Q; too high increase can stop the oscillations. Neutron radiation induces frequency changes by introducing dislocations into the lattice by knocking out atoms, a single fast neutron can produce many defects; the SC and AT cut frequency increases roughly linearly with absorbed neutron dose, while {{the frequency of the}} BT cuts decreases. Neutrons also alter the temperature-frequency characteristics. Frequency change at low ionizing radiation doses is proportionally higher than for higher doses. High-intensity radiation can stop the oscillator by inducing photoconductivity in the crystal and transistors; with a swept crystal and properly designed circuit the oscillations can restart within 15 microseconds after the radiation burst. Quartz crystals with high levels of alkali metal impurities lose Q with irradiation; Q of swept artificial crystals is unaffected. Irradiation with higher doses (over 105 rad) lowers sensitivity to subsequent doses. Very low radiation doses (below 300 rad) have disproportionately higher effect, but this nonlinearity saturates at higher doses. At very high doses, the radiation response of the crystal saturates as well, due to the finite number of impurity sites that can be affected.|$|E
