6000|$|... "But {{the little}} ones," [...] said my oldest matron daughter, {{who had not}} as yet spoken,--"they are the problem. Oh, this weary labor of making {{children}} keep Sunday! If <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>it,</b> <b>I</b> have no rest at all myself. If I must talk to them or read to them {{to keep them from}} play, my Sabbath becomes my hardest working day." ...|$|R

60|$|This was not indeed my own invention, but {{was given}} me by {{one that had}} practised it with success, and my governess liked it extremely; and indeed <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>it</b> again several times, though never twice near the same place; for the next time <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>it</b> in White Chapel, just by the corner of Petticoat Lane, where the coaches stand that go out to Stratford and Bow, and {{that side of the}} country, and another time at the Flying Horse, without Bishopgate, where the Cheston coaches then lay; and I had always the good luck to come off with some booty.|$|E

60|$|I {{should not}} {{wonder if it}} were equally good for a stitch in the side; but I cannot say <b>I</b> ever <b>tried</b> <b>it</b> for that.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, no!" [...] {{the woman}} broke out, almost in anguish. [...] "Not what I wanted! What <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> for. <b>It</b> never gave me what I wanted. It--couldn't!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, you're a scientist. Oh, <b>I</b> will <b>try</b> and get {{the music}} out of Mr. Elder. Only, why can't he let it COME out, instead of being ashamed of it, and always talking about hunting dogs? But <b>I</b> will <b>try.</b> <b>Is</b> <b>it</b> all right now?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Never told you, eh? Well, <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>it</b> once, {{down in the}} States. That's why I'm here. Been raised together, too. I {{came away}} {{to give her a}} chance for divorce. She got it.|$|E
6000|$|... "I cannot imagine," [...] she remarked, [...] "how I {{could have}} made such a mistake about the door. <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>it</b> twice or three times and it {{certainly}} {{seemed to me to}} be locked." ...|$|E

6000|$|The devil's main {{excuse for}} his nervelessness was his {{profound}} ignorance of human nature. [...] "So far as I can see," [...] he said, [...] "they might all be Wild Asses. <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>it</b> once----" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, <b>I</b> will <b>try</b> <b>it.</b> Do thou {{leave the}} fish under that bush, and follow me. It needs three big fish {{to make a}} good feast for my father's household." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't whack round," [...] said Robin; [...] "I always aim at something. When you <b>try</b> and <b>it</b> doesn't come off, you say it's 'hard luck;' {{and when}} <b>I</b> <b>try</b> and <b>it</b> does come off, you say it's fluking. So like a man." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Well, {{they only}} catch them, now. <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>it</b> myself once. I set out at low tide, about ten o'clock, one night, and got between {{the water and}} the biggest seal on the bank. We fought it out on that line till daylight." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Where can I go? What can I do? There 's {{nobody in}} all the world to lend me a hand, just as there never has been. <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>it</b> once, and learned my lesson too well to do it again in a hurry." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am not certain," [...] said Jonas, [...] "that my dye will color hair; <b>I</b> never <b>tried</b> <b>it,</b> {{except on}} wood. Do {{you think that}} black would be a pretty color?" ...|$|R
