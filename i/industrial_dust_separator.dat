The main difference between them is that one has anti-clogging properties and the other does not.

Filtration took place at a velocity of 2 cm s 21. Two parameters, namely pressure drop and efficiency, were monitored according to the collection and cleaning cycles. The comparison of the filtration efficiency of the two media and that of the corresponding <b>industrial</b> <b>dust</b> <b>separator</b> {{at the end of the}} cycles showed a close agreement.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this project {{is to improve the}} productivity and lower the expense of existing vacuum blasting technology. This technology is used to remove radioactive contamination, PCBs, and lead-based paint and provides worker protection by continuously recycling the material and dust for the decontamination tasks. The proposed work would increase the cleaning rate and provide safe and cost-effective decontamination of the DOE sites. This work focuses on redesigning and improving existing vacuum blasting technology including blast head nozzles, ergonomic handling of the blast head by reducing its weight; brush-ring design, vacuum level regulator, efficiency of the <b>dust</b> <b>separator,</b> and operational control sensors. The redesign is expected to enhance the productivity and economy of the vacuum blasting system by at least 50 % over current vacuum blasting systems. There are three phases in the project. Phase I consists of developing and testing mathematical models. Phase II consists of pre-prototype design and fabrication and pre-prototype unit testing. Phase III consists of prototype design and field verification testing. In phase I, mathematical models are developed and analyzed for the nozzle, blast head, wind curtain, and <b>dust</b> <b>separator,</b> first as individual devices and then combined as an integrated model. This allows study of respective airflow and design parameters. The Contractor shall, {{based on the results of}} the mathematical modeling studies, design experimental models of the components and test these models. In addition, the Contractor shall develop sensors to detect the relationship of the blast head to the blast surfaces and controls to minimize the dependency on an operator's skill and judgment to obtain optimum positioning, as well as real-time characterization sensors to determine as the blast head is moving the depth to which coatings must be removed, thereby improving production and minimizing waste. In phase II, the Contractor shall design and construct a pre-prototype of the nozzle, blast head with wind curtain, sensors, and <b>dust</b> <b>separator</b> and test this system to assess the performance of the new design under controlled conditions at the contractor's facility. In phase III, the Contractor shall design and construct a prototype of the High Productivity Vacuum Blasting System, based on the results of the pre-prototype design and testing performed.

40|$|Background: The paper {{presents}} {{the incidence of}} occupational diseases in Poland (2013). Material and Methods: Occupational disease reporting forms, supplied to the Central Register of Occupational Diseases, were used as the study material. The incidence was specified in terms of rates per 100 000 employed people. Results: The number of new cases was 2214 with the incidence rate of 15. 6. The downward trend recorded over several years continues; compared to 2012, {{the number of new}} cases decreased by 7. 8 %. Exposure to dusts (35 % cases), mostly inorganic (carbon, asbestos, and <b>industrial</b> <b>dusts</b> containing free crystalline silica) was {{the most common cause of}} occupational diseases. Among the organic dusts allergenic effects of flour and vegetable dusts predominated. Every 3 rd case of occupational disease was attributable to physical agents, mainly the way the work is done, excessive vocal effort and noise. The sections of national economy with the highest incidence comprised mining and quarrying (271. 1), manufacturing (24. 3), education (22. 4), agriculture, forestry, hunting and fishing (21. 0), human health and social assistance (20. 5). Conclusions: The decreased incidence of ‘traditional’ diseases observed over the recent 15 years and the analysis of the 2013 incidence indicate a need to revise the Polish list of occupational diseases by exposures found in the modern work environment. Particular attention should be paid to conditions prevailing in workplaces with high exposures to <b>industrial</b> <b>dusts</b> containing free crystalline silica.
