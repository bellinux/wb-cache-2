2500|$|In 1920 Pace {{amicably}} dissolved his long-standing {{partnership with}} Handy, {{with whom he}} also collaborated as lyricist. As Handy wrote, [...] "To add to my woes, my partner withdrew from the business. He disagreed with some of my business methods, but no harsh words were involved. He simply chose this time to sever connection with our firm in order that he might organize Pace Phonograph Company, issuing Black Swan Records and making a serious bid for the Negro market[...] [...] [...] With Pace went {{a large number of}} our employees[...] [...] [...] Still more confusion and anguish grew out of the fact that people did not generally <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> no stake in the Black Swan Record Company." ...|$|E

I think the wives and the loving women, the Natalie Wood thing, were {{a bit of a}} cover." [...] Dean Hargrove, executive producer of the Perry Mason television films, said in 2006, [...] "I had always assumed that Raymond was gay, because he had a relationship with Robert Benevides for a very long time. Whether or not he had relationships with women, I had no idea. I did <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> trouble keeping track of whether he was married or not in these stories. Raymond had the ability to mythologize himself, to some extent, and some of his stories about his past … tended to grow as time went by." ...|$|E

2500|$|When Lucas {{drafted the}} script for The Phantom Menace, he envisioned a [...] "link between Padmé and Princess Leia, the {{daughter}} who follows so closely in her footsteps." [...] According to Natalie Portman, [...] "It definitely did come into play how strong and smart a character Carrie Fisher portrayed, because I {{think that a lot}} of that is passed on from parent to child. I think George wrote Amidala as a strong, smart character, but it helped to <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> this great woman before me who had portrayed her character as a fiery woman." [...] Paul McDonald notes that there are [...] "inevitable comparisons" [...] between the two characters: [...] "both develop soft spots for rogue pilots, and both have a knack for slipping into and out of stilted British accents." [...] Despite being diplomats, each is also the best marksman of her respective trilogy, rarely missing.|$|E
2500|$|In 1977, Cruyff {{announced}} his irreversible decision {{to retire from}} international football {{at the age of}} 30, despite still lean and wiry, after helping the country qualify for the 1978 World Cup. A move which was shrouded in mystery and met with disbelief back in late 1977, was only finally stripped of its mystique in 2008, when Cruyff lifted the lid on his decision in an interview with Catalunya Radio. It was while still living in Barcelona as a player in late 1977, Cruyff and his family became the victims of an armed attacker who forced his way into his flat in Barcelona. And the man who was then the ultimate football superstar was confronted with the choice between family values and a highly promising World Cup glory {{at the end of his}} international career. But for Cruyff, family comes first. In the interview with Catalunya Radio, he said that the attempted kidnap was the reason he decided not to go to the World Cup in Argentina in 1978. As he recalled, “You should <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> problems at the end of my career as a player here and I don't know if you know that someone [...] a rifle at my head and tied me up and tied up my wife in front of the children at our flat in Barcelona. The children were going to school accompanied by the police. The police slept in our house for three or four months. I was going to matches with a bodyguard. All these things change your point of view towards many things. There are moments in life in which there are other values. We wanted to stop this and be a little more sensible. It was the moment to leave football and I couldn't play in the World Cup after this.” ...|$|E
2500|$|In January 2000, Suzuki {{released}} [...] "Don't Need to Say Good Bye" [...] which debuted {{at number}} 5. A week later, Suzuki released her second studio album, Infinity Eighteen Vol. 1, which sold 1,063,000 copies and debuted at number one.　Suzuki has said {{of this first}} period of her career {{that she was not}} free to do what she wanted and only followed what she was told, leaving her feeling [...] "pretty disheartened and down, like there was no future.". Suzuki had been writing lyrics from an early age and passing them to her manager and producers. The first song to feature them, with the help of Mitsuko and Tetsuya Komuro, was her tenth Sony single, [...] "Don't Need to Say Good Bye". The lyrics were influenced by events occurring in her personal life at that time, specifically her upcoming high school graduation and she has said [...] "it was more important to me than sales and chart rankings to <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> put my thoughts and feelings into what I was singing."　Three months after Infinity Eighteen Vol.1, Suzuki released her twelfth single, [...] "Thank You 4 Every Day Every Body" [...] in the beginning of April and third studio album, Infinity Eighteen Vol.2 at the end of April. [...] "Thank You 4 Every Day Every Body" [...] sold a total of 234,000 copies reaching number one and Infinity Eighteen Vol.2 sold a total of 427,000 copies reaching number two. [...] "Reality/Dancin' in Hip-Hop" [...] was Suzuki's 12th single released under the Sony Music Japan label, on 27 September 2000. It reached number 3 on Oricon weekly chart and sold a total of 211,000 copies. A compilation album of Suzuki's tracks, Fun for Fan, was released on 30 May 2001. It reached number 1 on the Oricon charts, despite the fact that by this point, Suzuki herself had vanished from the public eye and Sony had taken all of her previous singles and albums off CD shelves.|$|E
