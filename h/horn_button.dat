2500|$|The last jukebox {{produced}} by the Mills Novelty Company was the Constellation (model number 951). [...] By some mechanism, {{it appears that the}} front grille medallion from the jukebox ended up being incorporated in the 1948 Tucker Sedan, as a <b>horn</b> <b>button.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{television}} series The Dukes of Hazzard (1979–1985) featured an orange 1969 Dodge Charger that was named The General Lee. [...] "The General" [...] sported the Confederate battle flag {{painted on the}} roof and the words [...] "GENERAL LEE" [...] over each door. The windows were always open, as the doors were supposedly welded shut for racing, and the actors would do a window slide to get in and out. The number [...] "01" [...] is painted on both doors. Also, when the <b>horn</b> <b>button</b> was pressed, it played the first 12 notes from the de facto Confederate States anthem [...] "Dixie". The car performed spectacular jumps in almost every episode, and the show's popularity produced consumer interest in the car.|$|E
2500|$|Henry Ford {{purchased}} {{the property in}} 1921, but did not use it for some time. [...] Eventually, he constructed a new building constructed on the site, and the plant opened in 1939. [...] It employed up to 130 people making workers <b>horn</b> <b>buttons</b> and starter switches. During World War II, production shifted to brass spark plug bushings for B-24 bombers. [...] After the war, the line returned to making <b>horn</b> <b>buttons</b> and starter switches until 1954, when production shifted to armrests and lamp lenses.|$|R
50|$|The Delta Electric Company was an American {{electronics}} manufacturer {{formed in}} 1913 in Marion, Indiana (after moving from Chicago, Illinois) that produced lanterns, flashlights, automotive and bicycle lighting, battery tubes, <b>horns,</b> <b>horn</b> <b>buttons,</b> light switches, other battery-powered electrical parts, and bilge pumps.|$|R

2500|$|Only a {{few changes}} {{were made to the}} 1978 VAM Gremlin. The {{dashboard}} design was from the new U.S. market Concord being restricted to the unit with black surfaces only (no wood imitation or brushed aluminum versions). For the Gremlin X there was a new VAM logo on the steering wheel <b>horn</b> <b>button,</b> smaller pointy volcano hubcaps with bright exposed lug nuts, while a new full-length body side decal incorporated the [...] "Gremlin X" [...] logo on the rear quarter panel. The sporty model also got the set of four bumper guards as standard equipment. The base model got another set of new hubcaps with exposed lug nuts, but with a flat top instead. Production fell just below 6,000 VAM Gremlins.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "Spyder" [...] {{nameplate}} {{had been}} used to designate the 1962-1964 Corvair turbocharged model. The [...] "Spyder" [...] name was introduced for the Chevrolet Monza in 1976. This package included performance equipment and some small appearance items. [...] The Monza Spyder equipment package was available on all 2+2 hatchbacks and Monza Towne Coupes (with the [...] "sport equipment" [...] package) with five-speed manual and Turbo Hydra-matic automatic transmissions. [...] The Spyder equipment package included a two-barrel, Dura-Built 2.3 litre engine, floor console unit, large front and rear stabilizer bars, special shock absorbers, steel-belted radial ply blackwall tires, wheel opening mouldings (chrome), day-night inside mirror, a sport steering wheel (two-spoke), a special instrumentation and [...] "stitched" [...] instrument panel pad with added wood-grain vinyl accents (standard on 2+2), distinctive [...] "Spyder" [...] identification (script fender emblems, steering wheel <b>horn</b> <b>button</b> insert) and Spyder front facia and rear-lock cover.|$|E
2500|$|In the interior, both {{cars were}} far more different. The VAM car had {{woodgrain}} overlays over the front dashboard surfaces instead of brushed aluminum, digital tachometer, Hurst T-shaped shifter, VAM logo over the <b>horn</b> <b>button,</b> a [...] "Rally" [...] emblem over the glove box door, reclining front bucket seats with round border pattern on the fabric plus inhouse side and door panels. In the midyear, just like it happened with the grille, VAM replaced the round border pattern of with a horizontal-line design {{in one or two}} tones due to criticism and rejection from customers. Mechanically, the model is restricted to a single engine, the [...] VAM [...] inline six cylinder engine with TREMEC 170-F four-speed manual transmission with Hurst linkage or optional Chrysler TorqueFlyte A998 three-speed automatic transmission with a 3.31:1 rear differential gear ratio. Factory equipment included power front disk and rear drum brakes, power steering, front sway bar, heavy duty springs and shocks, as well as D70×14 radial tires.|$|E
5000|$|In {{its history}} the village has been {{involved}} in the trade of plated buckles and <b>horn</b> <b>buttons,</b> and the manufacture of dowlas. During the 19th century, the village was home to the Dorset Ooser, a wooden mask brought out during [...] "Rough Music" [...] ceremonies.|$|R
5000|$|Inside {{the main}} changes from the Giulia Sprint GT were {{imitation}} wood dashboard fascia {{instead of the}} previous anti-glare grey finish, front seats revised to a mild [...] "bucket" [...] design, and a dished three aluminium spoke steering wheel, with a black rim and <b>horn</b> <b>buttons</b> through the spokes.|$|R
50|$|In 1860 {{he settled}} in Leipzig {{as a master}} turner, making <b>horn</b> <b>buttons.</b> He joined various labor organizations. Although {{initially}} an opponent of socialism, Bebel gradually was won over to socialist ideas through pamphlets of Ferdinand Lassalle, which popularized the ideas of Karl Marx. In 1865 he came {{under the influence of}} Wilhelm Liebknecht and was thereafter committed fully to the socialist cause.|$|R
2500|$|The Teletouch {{pushbutton}} {{automatic transmission}} selector {{was an extremely}} complex feature. [...] It proved problematic {{in part because the}} steering wheel hub, where the pushbuttons were located, was the traditional location of the <b>horn</b> <b>button.</b> [...] Some drivers inadvertently shifted gears when they intended to sound the horn. [...] While the Edsel was fast, the location of the transmission pushbuttons was not conducive to street racing. There were also jokes among stoplight drag racers about the buttons: D for Drag, L for Leap, and R for Race (instead of Drive, Low and Reverse). [...] The control wires for Teletouch were also routed too close to the exhaust manifold, which often caused unpredictable movement of the selector mechanism and, in some cases, complete failure. The electrical design required drivers to shift from Park to Reverse to Neutral to Drive, in that order, to avoid overloading the Teletouch motor. The motor was also not powerful enough to bring the car out of Park while on a hill, so dealerships would instruct drivers to set the parking brake before pushing the Park button.|$|E
2500|$|Z02 - Spyder {{appearance}} : Black highlights on front, {{side and}} rear of body headlight openings, parking light openings, windshield, rear window and side window moldings, body sill, door and center pillar louvers, {{rear end panel}} - (bright window moldings with black exterior), black or gold rear accents (taillight blackouts and rear end panel decals), body color front air dam and rear spoiler, Spyder emblems (front facia, rear lock cover and sport steering wheel <b>horn</b> <b>button</b> insert), body side stripes with Spyder lettering in red, white or gold depending on body color, black painted styled-steel wheels with trim rings and center caps, black sport mirrors, special hood decal and rear spoiler decal. For the 1980 model year, Chevrolet combined the Spyder equipment and appearance packages into one Spyder equipment package with an RPO code of Z29 and included newly re-designed bold Spyder side decals and a new front air dam that blends into the front fender wheel openings. [...] Spyder decal color choices (five) were based primarily upon the interior color specified rather than the body color as in previous years.|$|E
2500|$|Davis {{nearly died}} in an {{automobile}} accident on November 19, 1954, in San Bernardino, California, as he was making a return trip from Las Vegas to Los Angeles. During the previous year, he had started a friendship with comedian and host Eddie Cantor, who had given him a mezuzah. Instead of putting it by his door as a traditional blessing, Davis wore it around his neck for good luck. The only time he forgot it was the night of the accident. The accident occurred at a fork in U.S. Route 66 at Cajon Boulevard and Kendall Drive (...) [...] Davis lost his left eye to the bullet-shaped <b>horn</b> <b>button</b> (a standard [...] feature in 1954 and 1955 Cadillacs) as a result. His friend, actor Jeff Chandler, said he would give one of his own eyes if it would keep Davis from total blindness. Davis wore an eye patch for at least six months following the accident. He was featured with the patch on the cover of his debut album and appeared on What's My Line? wearing the patch (March 13, 1955). Later, he was fitted for a glass eye, which he wore {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
50|$|The reefer {{jacket was}} of naval origin, and {{described}} the short double breasted jacket worn by sailors in harsh weather, when they perform duties such as reefing the sails. It is descendants of this which are now commonly described by the term blazer. Originally with black <b>horn</b> <b>buttons,</b> these jackets evolved to the modern dark blazer, now single as well as double breasted, and with metallic buttons.|$|R
5000|$|Hudson dealers {{also sold}} Rambler and Metropolitan models under the Hudson brand. When sold by Hudson dealers, both cars were {{identified}} as Hudson vehicles via hood/grille emblems and <b>horn</b> <b>buttons.</b> Hudson Ramblers also received [...] "H" [...] symbols on fuel filler caps (and, in 1956, also on hubcaps). For 1957, Rambler and Metropolitan became makes in their own rights, and no longer {{were identified as}} Hudson or Nash.|$|R
5000|$|Automaker Henry Ford {{began to}} test farm crops for their {{industrial}} potential around 1930, and soon settled on hemp and the soybean as particularly promising (the famous Hemp Body or Soybean Car). The Ford Motor Company used soybeans in such parts as gearshift knobs and <b>horn</b> <b>buttons,</b> and hemp {{for the body}} of the car. The automobile was designed to run on hemp diesel. Ford Motor Company accessed these innovations via the discovery and ingenuity of George Washington Carver, Tuskegee Scientist and Father of Chemurgy.|$|R
2500|$|The 1974 Rallys {{were mostly}} {{unchanged}} from the 1973s. Just {{like on the}} Rambler American, their largest difference was the new rear five-mile-per-hour bumper and relocated rear license plate. These models incorporated {{the first set of}} VAM's original five-spoke wheels, which carried full volcano-shaped hubcaps and trim rings. Due to this, wheelcovers were removed as available accessories for this model. For the first time a set of factory side stripes decorated the exterior of the model including a stylish manuscript [...] "Rally" [...] emblem over the rear quarter panel, creating a two-tone appearance. Front seats were mostly the same as the year before, now shared with the brand-new Classic AMX (Matador X) model. The discontinuation of the original VAM logo during 1973 in favor of the new arrow-type one meant its removal from the dial of the tachometer. The shifter was changed into a T-shaped Hurst unit. A new AMC logo over a black background replaced the American Motors legend over the transparent acrylic cap in the steering wheel's <b>horn</b> <b>button.</b> The 258 six engine got a slight drop in compression ratio from 8.5:1 to 8.3:1.|$|E
2500|$|All {{the quality}} and {{engineering}} upgrades and revisions seen on AMC cars for 1972 were also present in Mexico. The 1972 VAM Javelin saw considerable improvements {{in terms of both}} performance and sportiness. Heavy duty springs and shocks along with front sway bar were passed on to the standard equipment list, as also were power front disk brakes and power steering, all regardless of transmission. Units equipped with the four-speed manual transmission changed to a rear differential gear ratio of 3.31:1 and included a center console with locking compartment as standard equipment. The [...] "Shift-Command" [...] Borg-Warner automatic transmissions were replaced by the new [...] "Torque Command" [...] Chrysler-built A998 TorqueFlite. The chromed grille applied on the tail light lenses and the new rectangular grid front grille of the AMC Javelins arrived for the VAM models. The exterior included for the first time factory stripe designs. The interior saw new seat patterns and a new three-spoke sports steering wheel with an [...] "American Motors" [...] legend on the transparent plastic cap of the <b>horn</b> <b>button.</b> A new steering column design with a built-in safety lever to engage the steering lock came and the mechanism blocking the shifters to ignition switch departed.|$|E
2500|$|The 1950 Oldsmobile 98 {{repeated}} its 1948 precedent of previewing some of next years styling cues for the 88. The 98 was restyled {{after only}} two years. It {{was the first}} totally slab sided Oldsmobile and the first sedan with wraparound rear windows. A 4-door 98 fastback appeared for one year only in 1950 and was called the Town Sedan, selling only 1,778 units. Standard equipment included bumper guards, dual horns, parking lamps, dome light, rubber floor mats, aluminum sill plates, foam rubber seat cushions, chrome interior trim, lined luggage compartment and counterbalanced trunk lid. Deluxe 98 equipment included rear seat armrest, Deluxe electric clock, Deluxe steering wheel and <b>horn</b> <b>button,</b> special door trim and stainless steel wheel trim rings. Upholstery choices spanned nylon fabric, striped broadcloth or leather. Standard tire size was [...] by [...] In 1950, Oldsmobile stopped naming the 98 series and so from then through 1996, {{with the exception of}} 1957 when it was called the Starfire 98, and in 1961 when it was called the Classic 98, it was simply known as the Oldsmobile 98. Sales of the 98 Holiday nearly tripled to 8263, approaching the 11,989 sold of the Club coupe. Given the rapidly growing popularity of the 2-door Holiday hardtop, 1950 was the last year for the pillared Club coupe. Total sales set yet another record of 106,220.|$|E
50|$|The Allstate was {{essentially}} a Henry J, but {{with a number of}} differences that included Allstate badges on the hood and rear deck, a more upscale interior of Saran plaid or occasionally leather or smooth vinyl, special hubcaps/wheel covers, <b>horn</b> <b>buttons</b> and instrument bezels, a locking glove box and trunk lid, special engine color (blue), custom armrests and sunvisors, revised door locks and keys, and special parking and taillamp assemblies. Most notably, the Allstate featured a unique two-bar grille and jet-plane hood ornament designed by Alex Tremulis, who had come to Kaiser-Frazer from the Tucker Corporation.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are some}} other buttons of the Regiment also. The {{miniature}} <b>horn</b> <b>buttons</b> are worn {{on either side of}} the Kat Service Dress to hold chin strap in Place, two are worn in front of the [...] "Cap line’ below the cherry and one each on the gorget patches worn by the officers of the rank of colonel and above. All the Regimental buttons have a crossed Katara and the bugle present on them. The custom of usage is that the buttons are always black and should only be stitched by the usage of black thread.|$|R

2500|$|For 1981, the Spirit sedan-based VAM Gremlin saw the {{greatest}} changes since 1979. Both versions obtained a 55-amp alternator, coolant recovery tank and fan shroud regardless of trim level or {{the presence of}} the air conditioning system, as well as a new shared grille design with vertical bars and a single horizontal one in the bottom plus a shared new seat pattern design. For the first time, door panels completely covered all previously exposed metal parts. International symbols appeared in the instrument cluster warning lights and the light beam switch was integrated to the steering column marker light lever. The Gremlin X received numerous updates. All chromed items were deleted other than the front end and rear licence plate light housings while the rear spoiler passed on to the option list. Both bumpers changed to blacked out units. Side decals were almost gone, with only a small [...] "Gremlin X" [...] one at the bottom corner of each C-pillar. A new leather-wrapped sports steering wheel with six simulated hex socket bolts on the <b>horn</b> <b>button</b> was used. A four speed manual transmission with Hurst linkage and a 3.07:1 rear gear ratio became standard. Units with automatic transmission retained the 3.31:1 rear gear ratio of all previous years. The optional equipment list now included eight-spoke sports-style steel wheels using the same volcano hubcaps as the standard wheels.|$|E
2500|$|The Pacer X was {{available}} in only three colors (black, white and wine red), carried body-colored bumpers and had most bright items deleted, was applied with unique thin golden stripes surrounding the door and side glass areas extending through the roof from side to side, used VAM's eight-spoke sports steel wheels painted in gold with blacked out volcano hubcaps, rear and side glass moldings were also blacked out and the lower front corners of the doors had [...] "Pacer X" [...] decals in place. In the interior, the Pacer X held its own design of reclining bucket seats, had a center console with locking compartment and ashtray instead of the armrest, a set of Rallye gauges (water temperature, clock, ammeter and oil pressure) instead of the in-dashboard ashtray, a 6000 rpm tachometer {{in place of the}} electric clock, three-arm spoked sports steering wheel with a cylindrical <b>horn</b> <b>button</b> with a VAM logo, floor-mounted three-speed automatic transmission, remote-controlled driver's side door mirror, and reading dome light. Air conditioning was standard in this model and most units included a tinted glass pop-up sunroof. The rest of the equipment was the same as the standard model: power brakes, power steering, front sway bar, stiff shock absorbers and springs, 3.07:1 rear gears, heavy duty cooling system, AM FM monaural radio, tinted windshield, light group, inside hood release, and three-point retractable seatbelts. The VAM Pacer X was a limited edition model of only 250 units and is the most collectible Pacer model in Mexico.|$|E
2500|$|Both VAM {{versions}} incorporated manual front disk brakes, front sway bar, floor-mounted three-speed manual transmissions, a 3.31:1 rear {{differential gear}} ratio, and the [...] I6 engine with a Carter YF one-barrel carburetor, 266 degree camshaft and 8.0:1 compression ratio rated at [...] at 3900rpm. Both versions were {{equipped with a}} 140km/h / 90mph speedometer, individual fold-down front seats, three-point seat belts, parcel shelf, front and rear ashtrays, cigarette lighter, locking glove-box, padded sun visors, carpeting, round dome light, inside hood release, rear spoiler, AM radio and antenna. The Gremlin X model included a Hurst linkage for the manual transmission, power steering, bumper guards, wheel trim rings, narrow longer volcano hubcaps, blacked out side glass and door window frames, wider 70X14 radial tires, front fender [...] "4.2 Litros" [...] decals, a sports grille designed by VAM, tinted windshield, AMC's three-arm spoked sports steering wheel with a VAM logo on the <b>horn</b> <b>button,</b> light group (lighter, glove box, courtesy and hood), bright molding package (rocker panels, wheel lips and drip rails), digital tachometer and retractable three-point seatbelts instead of the non-retractable fixed units. Door panels were the same in both versions except that the X had lower carpet inserts and map pouches. The roof rack that was standard on the base model was optional on the X version. The heater was optional on the base Gremlin with manual transmission and standard for other versions. The base Gremlin had few options, while the Gremlin X offered a greater list. The base model offered bumper guards, power steering, light group, bright molding package, tinted windshield, sports steering wheel and wheel trim rings. The X versions could be ordered with air conditioning, reading dome light, AM/FM radio, rear defogger, and sunroof. Options shared by both versions were limited to a TorqueFlite A904 three-speed automatic transmission, power brakes, passenger's side remote mirror, and dual remote controlled mirrors.|$|E
5000|$|The {{original}} {{leather binding}} has a fold-over flap with three <b>horn</b> <b>buttons</b> that were probably used {{to secure a}} thong or straps, now missing, that tied the cover up; {{it does not seem}} to have been physically attached to the gathered and sewn-together pages inside, forming what we might call today a folder or wallet. Similar covers seem to be shown in some images in manuscripts, but no comparable covers have survived. The outside of the cover was [...] "painted with black carbon-based pigment". The leather seems to have been used as a trial piece or sketchpad for composing patterns of interlace for other objects. On the inside there is a sheet of papyrus, presumably used as a liner to stiffen the cover somewhat.|$|R

2500|$|The {{novelties}} {{are found}} in the interior: the four-spoke steering wheel that includes the <b>horn,</b> new <b>buttons</b> and new chrome lines to suggest a new look.

2500|$|Mazda {{introduced}} the 10th Anniversary RX-7 in 1988 as a {{limited production run}} based on the RX-7 Turbo II. Production was limited to 1,500 models. The 10th Anniversary RX-7 features a Crystal White (paint code UC) monochromatic paint scheme with matching white body side mouldings, taillight housings, mirrors and 16-inch alloy 7-spoke wheels. There were two [...] "series" [...] of 10th Anniversary models, with essentially a VIN-split running production change between the two. The most notable difference between the series {{can be found on}} the exterior- the earlier [...] "Series I" [...] cars had a black [...] "Mazda" [...] logo decal on the front bumper cover, whereas most if not all [...] "Series II" [...] cars did not have the decal. Series II cars also received the lower seat cushion height/tilt feature that Series I cars lacked. Another distinctive exterior feature is the bright gold rotor-shaped 10th Anniversary Edition badge on the front fenders (yellow-gold on the Series II cars). A distinctive 10th Anniversary package feature is the all black leather interior (code D7), which included not just the seats, but the door panel inserts as well and a leather-wrapped MOMO steering wheel (with 10th Anniversary Edition embossed <b>horn</b> <b>button)</b> and MOMO leather shift knob with integrated boot. All exterior glass is bronze tinted (specific in North America to only the 10th Anniversary), and the windshield was equipped with the embedded secondary antenna also found on some other select models with the upgraded stereo packages. Other 10th Anniversary Edition specific items were headlight washers (the only RX-7 in the US market that got this feature), glass breakage detectors added to the factory alarm system, 10th Anniversary Edition logoed floormats, 10th Anniversary Edition embroidered front hood protector and accompanying front end mask (or [...] "bra"), and an aluminum under pan.|$|E
2500|$|The 1981 {{model year}} {{represented}} a radical upgrade for VAM's top performance line. An all-new [...] "rally" [...] emblem design in all-lower case letters and computer-like typography appeared on both front fenders. The Rally AMX obtained a new [...] "waved" [...] stripe design {{located on the}} front edge of the hood and fenders with an integrated [...] "AMX" [...] leyend on the right front corner. It was very discreet compared to the last year's decals while the [...] "AMX over Rally" [...] and [...] "4.6 Litros" [...] stickers were removed. The Rally GT got also discreet [...] "GT" [...] stickers for the front of the hood bulge and [...] "GT 4.6/X" [...] stickers for the right corner of the rear spoiler. The previous year's [...] "American GT" [...] side decals and [...] "GT" [...] central rear spoiler emblem were deleted. Both versions shared all-new impressive Recardo-type reclining bucket seats with adjustable headrests, all new door panels in vinyl with cloth and carpet inserts but that no longer had map pouches, AMC's barred grille design used in the Eagle models made in aluminum instead of plastic, international symbols on the instrument cluster warning lights, the high beams switch integrated to the steering column, a new leather-wrapped sports steering wheel design with six fake Allen bolts on the <b>horn</b> <b>button</b> forming a hexagon, AM/FM stereo radio with four speakers as standard equipment and higher quality dashboard woodgrain panels. Mechanically, the coolant recovery tank and fan shroud became present. The optional equipment list was vastly improved; the set of power doorlocks and windows that debuted the year before in the American (Concord) line became available in the Rally. The GT got the electric antenna while the AMX included the rear spoiler with electric trunk release, both as standard equipment. The full optional equipment list for the Rally AMX was air conditioning, automatic transmission, intermittent wipers, reading dome light, rear defroster, sports steel wheels, electric antenna, power door locks and power windows; the list of the Rally GT was restricted to the electric locks and windows only {{while the rest of the}} accessories were standard except for the unavailable automatic transmission and air conditioning.|$|E

60|$|The man was of fine figure, swarthy, {{and stern}} in aspect; {{and he showed}} in profile a facial angle so {{slightly}} inclined as to be almost perpendicular. He wore a short jacket of brown corduroy, newer than {{the remainder of his}} suit, which was a fustian waistcoat with white <b>horn</b> <b>buttons,</b> breeches of the same, tanned leggings, and a straw hat overlaid with black glazed canvas. At his back he carried by a looped strap a rush basket, from which protruded at one end the crutch of a hay-knife, a wimble for hay-bonds being also visible in the aperture. His measured, springless walk was the walk of the skilled countryman as distinct from the desultory shamble of the general labourer; while in the turn and plant of each foot there was, further, a dogged and cynical indifference personal to himself, showing its presence even in the regularly interchanging fustian folds, now in the left leg, now in the right, as he paced along.|$|R
