An <b>electret</b> is a ferroelectric material that has been permanently electrically charged or polarized.

25|$|An <b>electret</b> {{microphone}} {{is a type}} of condenser microphone, which {{eliminates the}} need for a power supply by using a permanently charged material. <b>Electret</b> materials have been known since the 1920s, and were proposed as condenser microphone elements several times, but were considered impractical until the foil <b>electret</b> type was invented at Bell Laboratories in 1962 by Jim West, using a thin metallized Teflon foil. This became the most common type, used in many applications from high-quality recording and lavalier use to built-in microphones in small sound recording devices and telephones.|$|E

The effectiveness of <b>electrets</b> was assessed while comparisons were made with hydrogen chloride measuring devices from chamber and field tests, and computed results from a multilayer diffusion model.

The results show that the <b>electrets</b> (a passive device which needs no power) can be used effectively alongside existing measuring devices (which need power). By placing <b>electrets</b> in areas where no power is available, measurements may be obtained. Consequently, it is a valuable complementary instrument in measuring rocket exhaust effluents in areas where other measuring devices {{may not be able to}} assess the contaminants...|$|R

25|$|Condenser {{microphones}} {{span the}} range from telephone transmitters through inexpensive karaoke microphones to high-fidelity recording microphones. They generally produce a high-quality audio signal {{and are now}} the popular choice in laboratory and recording studio applications. The inherent suitability of this technology {{is due to the}} very small mass that must be moved by the incident sound wave, unlike other microphone types that require the sound wave to do more work. They require a power source, provided either via microphone inputs on equipment as phantom power or from a small battery. Power is necessary for establishing the capacitor plate voltage, and is also needed to power the microphone electronics (impedance conversion in the case of <b>electret</b> and DC-polarized microphones, demodulation or detection in the case of RF/HF microphones). Condenser microphones are also available with two diaphragms that can be electrically connected to provide a range of polar patterns (see below), such as cardioid, omnidirectional, and figure-eight. It is also possible to vary the pattern continuously with some microphones, for example the Røde NT2000 or CAD M179.|$|E

50|$|In {{order to}} have an {{electric}} polarization that can be reversed, ferroelectric polymers are often crystalline, much like other ferroelectric materials. Ferroelectric properties are derived from <b>electrets,</b> which are defined as a dielectric body that polarizes when an electric field and heat is applied. Ferroelectric polymers differ in that the entire body undergoes polarization, and the requirement of heat is not necessary. Although they differ from <b>electrets,</b> they {{are referred to as}} <b>electrets</b> often. Ferroelectric polymers fall into a category of ferroelectric materials known as a 'order-disorder' material.

2500|$|Due {{to their}} good {{performance}} {{and ease of}} manufacture, hence low cost, {{the vast majority of}} microphones made today are <b>electret</b> microphones; a semiconductor manufacturer estimates annual production at over one billion units. Nearly all cell-phone, computer, PDA and headset microphones are <b>electret</b> types. They are used in many applications, from high-quality recording and lavalier use to built-in microphones in small sound recording devices and telephones. Though <b>electret</b> microphones were once considered low quality, the best ones can now rival traditional condenser microphones in every respect and can even offer the long-term stability and ultra-flat response needed for a measurement microphone. Unlike other capacitor microphones, they require no polarizing voltage, but often contain an integrated preamplifier that does require power (often incorrectly called polarizing power or bias). This preamplifier is frequently phantom powered in sound reinforcement and studio applications. [...] Monophonic microphones designed for personal computer (PC) use, sometimes called multimedia microphones, use a 3.5mm plug as usually used, without power, for stereo; the ring, instead of carrying the signal for a second channel, carries power via a resistor from (normally) a 5V supply in the computer. Stereophonic microphones use the same connector; there is no obvious way to determine which standard is used by equipment and microphones.|$|E
2500|$|A crystal {{microphone}} or piezo microphone uses {{the phenomenon of}} piezoelectricity—the ability of some materials to produce a voltage when subjected to pressure—to convert vibrations into an electrical signal.

Crystal microphones were once commonly supplied with vacuum tube (valve) equipment, such as domestic tape recorders. [...] Their high output impedance matched the high input impedance (typically about 10megohms) of the vacuum tube input stage well. They were difficult to match to early transistor equipment, and were quickly supplanted by dynamic microphones for a time, and later small <b>electret</b> condenser devices.
