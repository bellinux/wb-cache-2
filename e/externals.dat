40|$|Background: Risky {{driving is}} a common cause of traffic {{accidents}} and injuries. However, {{there is no clear}} evidence of how difficulties in emotion regulation contribute to risky driving behaviour, particularly in small Post-Soviet countries. The present study aimed to investigate the relationship between difficulties in emotion regulation and self-reported risky driving behaviour in a sample of Lithuanian drivers. Methods: A total of 246 non-professional Lithuanian drivers participated in a cross-sectional survey. Difficulties in emotion regulation were assessed using the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS; Gratz and Roemer 2004 (<b>external)</b> (<b>external)</b> (<b>external)</b> (<b>external)</b> Gratz KL, Roemer L.

Females scored higher for the non-acceptance of emotional responses, while males had more difficulties with emotional awareness than females. More difficulties in emotion regulation were positively correlated with driving errors, lapses, aggressive violations and ordinary violations for both males and females. Structural equation modelling showed that difficulties in emotion regulation explained aggressive and ordinary violations more clearly than lapses and errors. When controlling for interactions among the distinct regulation difficulties, difficulties with impulse control and difficulties engaging in goal-directed behaviour predicted risky driving. Furthermore, non-acceptance of emotional responses and limited access to emotion regulation strategies were related to less violations and more driving errors. Conclusion: Emotion regulation difficulties were associated with the self-reported risky driving behaviours of Lithuanian drivers. This provides useful hints for improving driver training programmes in order to prevent traffic injuries...|$|R

The film (co-starring Vidya Balan) was Mukerji's first commercial success since Ta Ra Rum Pum, and was especially noted for being a success {{despite the absence of}} a prominent male actor. The film was a semi-biographical thriller based on the Jessica Lal murder case in which Mukerji played the fictional character of Meera Gaity, a foul-mouthed television journalist who is deeply involved with the case. To promote the film, she reprised the role of Gaity on the C.I.D. television series. In an interview with The Telegraph she said, [...] "It was such a different role to portray. It wasn't a role that was typical of a Hindi film heroine. Meera was more like a hero. It was a character that actually took the story forward. [...] Meera made a lot of things happen. It wasn't something that I had ever done before. I actually had to play a man!" [...] Certain critics, however, were critical of her performance, including Anupama Chopra of NDTV, who called her role, [...] "the fatal, false note in No One Killed Jessica," [...] arguing that [...] "the character is written superficially and Rani's portrayal of her is equally banal. It's all about <b>externals.</b> She argues a lot and proudly labels herself a bitch but her hair stays perfectly in place and in the end, she even gets to do a super-hero-like slow motion walk."

[...] When betting, they primarily focus on safe and moderate wagers.

2500|$|Rotter (1975) {{cautioned that}} internality and {{externality}} represent two {{ends of a}} continuum, not an either/or typology. Internals tend to attribute outcomes of events to their own control. People who have {{internal locus of control}} believe that the outcomes of their actions are results of their own abilities. Internals believe that their hard work would lead them to obtain positive outcomes. They also believe that every action has its consequence, which makes them accept the fact that things happen and it depends on them if they want to have control over it or not. <b>Externals</b> attribute outcomes of events to external circumstances. People with an external locus of control tend to believe that the things which happen in their lives are out of their control, and even that their own actions are a result of external factors, such as fate, luck, the influence of powerful others (such as doctors, the police, or government officials) and/or a belief that the world is too complex for one to predict or successfully control its outcomes. Such people tend to blame others rather than themselves for their lives' outcomes. It should not be thought, however, that internality is linked exclusively with attribution to effort and externality with attribution to luck (as Weiner's work – see below – [...] makes clear). This has obvious implications for differences between internals and <b>externals</b> in terms of their achievement motivation, suggesting that internal locus is linked with higher levels of need for achievement. Due to their locating control outside themselves, <b>externals</b> tend to feel they have less control over their fate. People with an external locus of control tend to be more stressed and prone to clinical depression.|$|E
