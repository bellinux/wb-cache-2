Sampling design benefits from previous knowledge of environmental variability that can be obtained from free remote sensing data. Environmental predictors derived from this remote sensing information alone, combined with automatic procedures for predictor selection and model fitting, can render cost-effective predictive distribution models for wildlife.

40|$|A large {{selection}} of polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners was determined in tissues from several British bird species including three sea birds, four birds of prey, and herons (Ardea cinerea). The congener “signatures” were consistent between different tissues {{of the same}} individual, but varied within and between species. Congeners 138, 153, and 180 were dominant in most samples. Nevertheless, ∑PCB values were wide ranging (0. 02 – 105 μg/g wet weight) and also differed considerably in subsamples of different tissues from individual birds. Applying recently reported toxicity equivalency factors (TEFs) for non-ortho, mono-ortho, and di-ortho substituted PCBs to liver concentrations of such congeners, {{it appears that the}} mono-ortho congeners 105 and 118 make a high contribution to TEFs when their toxicities are weighted by concentration.

We use least-cost methods, the most accurate and up-to-date land conversion dataset for East Africa, and interview <b>data</b> <b>on</b> <b>wildlife</b> corridors, to develop a single, consistent methodology to systematically assess wildlife corridors at a national scale using Tanzania as a case study. Our research aimed {{to answer the following}} questions; (i) which corridors may still remain open (i. e. structurally connected) at a national scale, (ii) which have been potentially severed by anthropogenic land conversion (e. g., agriculture and settlements), (iii) where are other remaining potential wildlife corridors located, and (iv) which protected areas with lower forms of protection (e. g., Forest Reserves and Wildlife Management Areas) may act as stepping-stones linking more than one National Park and/or Game Reserve. We identify a total of 52 structural connections between protected areas that are potentially open to wildlife movement, and in so doing add 23 to those initially identified by other methods in Tanzanian Government reports. We find {{that the vast majority of}} corridors noted in earlier reports as "likely to be severed" have actually not been cut structurally (21 of 24). Nonetheless, nearly a sixth of all the wildlife corridors identified in Tanzania in 2009 have potentially been separated by land conversion, and a third now pass across lands likely to be converted to human use in the near future. Our study uncovers two reserves with lower forms of protection (Uvinza Forest Reserve in the west and Wami-Mbiki Wildlife Management Area in the east) that act as apparently crucial stepping-stones between National Parks and/or Game Reserves and therefore require far more serious conservation support. Methods used in this study are readily applicable to other nations lacking detailed <b>data</b> <b>on</b> <b>wildlife</b> movements and plagued by inaccurate land cover datasets.

40|$|Interest in the {{epidemiology}} {{of emerging}} diseases {{of humans and}} livestock {{as they relate to}} wildlife has increased greatly over the past several decades. Many factors, most anthropogenic, have facilitated the emergence of diseases from wildlife. Some livestock diseases have ‘‘spilled over’’ to wildlife and then ‘‘spilled back’’ to livestock. When a population is exposed to an infectious agent, depending on an interaction of factors involving the host, agent, and environment, the population may be resistant to infection or may become a dead-end host, a spillover host, or a maintenance host. Each exposure is unique; the same species of host and agent may respond differently in different situations. Management actions that affect the environment and behavior of a potential host animal may allow {{the emergence of a new}} or as yet undetected disease. There are many barriers in preventing, detecting, monitoring and managing wildlife diseases. These may include political and legal hurdles, lack of knowledge about many diseases of wildlife, the absence of basic <b>data</b> <b>on</b> <b>wildlife</b> populations, difficulties with surveillance, and logistical constraints.

In order {{to clarify the}} role of red fox (Vulpes vulpes) as the most abundant canid species in Europe in maintaining the parasite in natural foci, an initial survey of dirofilariosis in this carnivore species was conducted in Slovakia. The samples of 183 red foxes hunted in 2007 - 2009 in regions of South-Eastern and Northern Slovakia with different geographical and climate characteristics were examined by means of PCR method using specific D. repens, D. immitis and Acantocheilonema recognitum primers. The DNA was isolated from spleen samples using commercial kit and PCR approach was used for diagnostics. After amplification selected products were purified and sequenced to elucidate any homologies with previously deposited sequences in Gen Bank. The results showed 105 out of 183 examined specimens (57. 4 %) being infected, with great regional differences in prevalence. Phylogenetic relationships within Dirofilaria species indicate that obtained isolates belong to D. repens. The results confirmed the role of red foxes as the reservoir of parasite.

The WARS system enables highway planners to reduce the fragmenting effect of highway corridors on wildlife habitats by ensuring wildlife migration routes which cross highway alignments are identified and protected.

We assessed the conservation significance of this site using <b>data</b> <b>on</b> <b>wildlife</b> and habitat conditions collected during a comprehensive primate survey. Scores were attributed to a system of variables and sub-variables to assess the conservation value of the proposed park at the national level. We identified a total of 10 diurnal primate species (eight monkeys, two apes) and flooded forests were considered as a key habitat for primates as they hold a greater number of species than terra firma forests. We recorded the presence of 12 mammal species listed under the 2000 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, including four classified as Endangered (two Primates, one Proboscidae and one Insectivora). We found that the conservation value of the proposed park ranked second out of the 15 existing protected areas of the country. Primate abundance was found to be generally higher than in the nearby Dzanga-Ndoki National Park (the sole other park located in the same vegetation unit), in particular for the species occurring in flooded forests. This highlights the fact that the proposed Mbaere-Bodingue National Park is an important area for the conservation of species associated with flooded forests, a habitat which is currently underrepresented in the national protected area system.
