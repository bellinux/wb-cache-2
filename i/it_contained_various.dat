2500|$|One of {{the appeals}} of the Almanack was that <b>it</b> <b>contained</b> <b>various</b> [...] "news stories" [...] in serial format, so that readers would {{purchase}} it {{year after year}} {{to find out what}} happened to the protagonists.

Appealing to his readers, Franklin urged them to purchase the next year or two or three or four editions to show their support for his prediction. The following year, Franklin expressed his regret that he was too ill to learn whether he or Leeds was correct. Nevertheless, the ruse had its desired effect: people purchased the Almanack to find out who was correct. (Later editions of the Almanack would claim that Leeds had died and that the person claiming to be Leeds was an impostor; Leeds, in fact, died in 1738, which prompted Franklin to applaud the supposed impostor for ending his ruse.) ...|$|E
