5|$|During the Battle of Britain, Hitler {{gave the}} German armed forces (Wehrmacht) a {{directive}} (<b>Directive</b> <b>No.</b> 16) that ordered provisional preparations for invasion of Britain. This operation was codenamed Operation Sea Lion (Unternehmen Seelöwe). Before {{this could be}} carried out, air superiority or air supremacy was required. The Luftwaffe was to destroy the RAF {{in order to prevent}} it from attacking the invasion fleet or providing protection for the Royal Navy's Home Fleet which might attempt to prevent a landing by sea. On 1 August Hitler gave the Luftwaffes commander-in-chief, Reichsmarschall (Empire Marshal) Hermann Göring and the Oberkommando der Luftwaffe (High Command of the Air Force) a (<b>Directive</b> <b>No.</b> 17) to launch the air assault.|$|E
5|$|On 13 April 1941, Hitler issued <b>Directive</b> <b>No.</b> 27, {{including}} his occupation policy for Greece. He finalized jurisdiction in the Balkans with <b>Directive</b> <b>No.</b> 31 issued on 9 June. Mainland Greece was divided between Germany, Italy and Bulgaria, with Italy occupying {{the bulk of}} the country (see map opposite). German forces occupied the strategically more important areas of Athens, Thessaloniki, Central Macedonia and several Aegean islands, including most of Crete. They also occupied Florina, which was claimed by both Italy and Bulgaria. Bulgaria, which had not participated in the invasion of Greece, occupied most of Thrace {{on the same day that}} Tsolakoglou offered his surrender. The goal was to gain an Aegean Sea outlet in Western Thrace and Eastern Macedonia. The Bulgarians occupied territory between the Struma river and a line of demarcation running through Alexandroupoli and Svilengrad west of the Evros River. Italian troops started occupying the Ionian and Aegean islands on 28 April. On 2 June, they occupied the Peloponnese; on 8 June, Thessaly; and on 12 June, most of Attica. The occupation of Greece—during which civilians suffered terrible hardships, many dying from privation and hunger—proved to be a difficult and costly task. Several resistance groups launched guerrilla attacks against the occupying forces and set up espionage networks.|$|E

5|$|The Soviet Air Force {{practice}} of harassing German ground forces using antiquated Polikarpov Po-2 and R-5 biplanes {{at night to}} drop flares and fragmentation bombs, inspired the Luftwaffe to form its own Störkampfstaffeln (harassment squadrons). On 23 July 1942, Junkers offered the Ju 87 B-2, R-2 and R-4s with Flammenvernichter ("flame eliminators"). On 10 November 1943, the RLM GL/C-E2 Division finally authorised the design in <b>directive</b> <b>No.</b> 1117. This new equipment made the Ju 87 more difficult to detect from the ground in darkness.|$|E
5|$|On 1 August 1940, Adolf Hitler {{had issued}} Führer <b>Directive</b> <b>no.</b> 17 (Weisung Nr. 17); the {{strategic}} objective {{of which was}} to engage and defeat the Royal Air Force (RAF) so as to achieve air superiority in preparation for Operation Sea Lion (Unternehmen Seelöwe), the proposed amphibious invasion of Great Britain. Reichsmarschall (Marshal of the Realm) Hermann Göring, {{in his role as}} commander-in-chief of the Luftwaffe ordered an attack on RAF Fighter Command's ground organization, code named Adlertag (Operation Eagle Attack). On 13 August, 485 bomber and approximately 1,000 fighter sorties were flown, targeting British airfields in southern England. Lützow claimed his first aerial victory in the Battle of Britain on 16 August 1940, shooting down a Supermarine Spitfire over Kent.|$|E
5|$|Planning for the {{operation}} started in December 1940. Erich Buschenhagen, {{chief of staff of}} Army of Norway visited Finland and drew up a plan which would determine Finland's role in the war, including the first draft of German-Finnish joint operations against the Soviet Union. On 8 December 1940 Hitler issued <b>Directive</b> <b>No.</b> 21, which detailed his plan for Operation Barbarossa as whole and included the targets for proposed German-Finnish cooperation. The detailed operational plan was created by Nikolaus von Falkenhorst with Army of Norway staff in January 1941.|$|E

According to the 28 March <b>Directive</b> <b>No.</b> 25, the Twelfth Army was to create a mobile task force to attack via Niš toward Belgrade. With only nine days left before their final deployment, every hour became valuable and each fresh assembly of troops took time to mobilise.

5|$|Aerial {{operations}} {{in what would}} become the Battle of Britain began for his unit on 12 July 1940. The fighting reached a climax on 7 August when Eagle Day was launched (code name Adlertag). Hitler had issued Führer <b>Directive</b> <b>no.</b> 17 (Weisung Nr. 17) on 1 August 1940; the strategic objective was to engage and defeat the Royal Air Force (RAF) to achieve air supremacy, or at least air superiority, in preparation for Operation Sea Lion (Unternehmen Seelöwe), the proposed amphibious invasion of Great Britain. From 7 September onwards, the Luftwaffe switched to attack British towns and cities, with London coming under particularly heavy attack, during what was dubbed The Blitz by the British. In total, Philipp flew 130 missions over England. His number of aerial victories increased, including his 12th to 15th on 27 September, which led to the presentation of the Honor Goblet of the Luftwaffe on 28 September 1940. He claimed his 20th victory on 20 October, and was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross. He was the second pilot of JG54 to receive this award. The first was his Gruppenkommandeur (group commander) Hauptmann Dietrich Hrabak, who received the award one day earlier.|$|E

This coordination consists in the obligation to apply European Union legislation towards persons travelling within the EU, regardless of internal laws. Basic acts which regulate such coordination are as follows: the Council <b>Directive</b> (EEC) <b>No</b> 1408 / 71 dated 14 June 1971 referring to the application of systems of social security for hired workers, self-employed individuals and members of their families travelling within {{the borders of the}} Union, as well as the Council <b>Directive</b> (EEC) <b>No</b> 574 / 72 dated 21 March 1972 defining the way of applying the <b>directive</b> (EEC) <b>No</b> 1408 / 71. With regard to pension funds, the Union regulates pensions resulting from inability to work, dependents’ pensions, pensions for injuries at work and work-related illnesses, funeral benefits. Basic principles for coordination are: equal treatment, applying legislation of one country and adding up periods covered by insurance.

25|$|On 11 July, Hitler {{agreed with}} Raeder that {{invasion}} {{would be a}} last resort, and the Luftwaffe advised that gaining air superiority would take 14 to 28 days.

25|$|Initial {{planning}} for the operation started in its earnest, in December 1940. Erich Buschenhagen, {{chief of staff of}} Army of Norway (AOK Norwegen) visited Finland and drew up a plan which would determine Finland's role in the war, which included the first draft of German-Finnish joint operations against the Soviet Union.

25|$|The Germans {{viewed the}} British naval {{withdrawal}} and suspension of merchant traffic {{as a success}} {{but the lack of}} targets for the Germans, eliminated the need for Fighter Command to engage the Luftwaffe over the Channel. The Germans now had to fly into southern England, which put the Bf109, the best German fighter, at the limit of its endurance. Hitler's <b>Directive</b> <b>No.</b> 17 expanded the scope of the air offensive from the English Channel to British airfields. When Göring held a meeting with the OKL staff at The Hague on 1 August, he emphasised the need for German fighters to conserve fuel, which remained a severe handicap for the Germans.|$|E
25|$|As the war ended, the {{structure}} of the Soviet military was reorganized from a war-time to a peace-time mode. <b>Directive</b> <b>No.</b> 11097 of 10 June 1945 created several new formations, known as Groups of Forces, equivalent to military districts, but used for command and administration of Soviet forces outside the Soviet Union itself. One of those new formations, at that time 300,000-400,000 strong, was to be stationed in Poland. It was mostly based on the 2nd Belorussian Front of General Konstantin Rokossovsky (formerly stationed around Mecklenburg and Brandenburg). With the exception of Szczecin (Stettin), which fell under the operational territory of the Western Group of Forces, the Northern Group of Forces was located entirely within the territory of Poland.|$|E
25|$|The navy {{insisted on}} a narrow beachhead and an {{extended}} period for landing troops; the army rejected these plans: the Luftwaffe could begin an air attack in August. Hitler held a meeting of his army and navy chiefs on 31 July. The navy said 22 September was the earliest possible date, and proposed postponement until the spring, but Hitler preferred September. He then told von Brauchitsch and Halder that he would decide on the landing operation eight to fourteen days after the air attack began. On 1 August he issued <b>Directive</b> <b>No.</b> 17 for intensified air and sea warfare, to begin with Adlertag on or after 5 August subject to weather, keeping options open for negotiated peace or blockade and siege.|$|E

25|$|After the {{collapse}} of the German Sixth Army at Stalingrad, the Soviet counter-offensives, and the Battle of Kursk later in 1943, it became apparent that the tide of war was turning against Germany. Soviet forces were, all along the front, approaching the pre-war border. Partly because of Führer <b>Directive</b> <b>No.</b> 51, which funneled all new men and materials to the Western Front, to meet the expected Allied Invasion, issued on 3 November 1943, Axis forces along the Eastern Front were severely inadequately equipped in comparison to their Soviet opponents, reinforcements were rare, and reserves were stretched thin. Although in this directive Hitler implied that he might be willing to allow withdraws, trading space for time, this proved to be false. This, combined with Hitler's insistence on holding onto captured territory at all costs, made Soviet victories in 1944 nearly inevitable.|$|E
25|$|The OKL did {{not view}} sea {{communications}} {{as the principal}} target of the air arm. Göring and his chief of staff, Hans Jeschonnek, thought an aerial assault on mainland Britain would destroy its armament factories, the Royal Air Force (RAF), and British morale. The air offensive of the Battle of Britain, they hoped, {{would be enough to}} convince the British to sue for peace. The Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (OKW) hoped peace negotiations would avoid a hazardous amphibious landing in Britain, codenamed Operation Sea Lion, from being carried out. Hitler was receptive to this idea, and his Führer <b>Directive</b> <b>No.</b> 17 made sure German efforts went into planning and executing Operation Eagle Attack, which intensified the prolonged struggle for air superiority over southern England after 13 August. In this operation, targeting British shipping came a distant second to destroying the RAF and military industries on land. The strategy demonstrated {{the extent to which the}} OKL hoped to win the war purely by the use of air power against land targets. The preceding German air operations against seaports and shipping in July and August 1940—a phase in the battle known as the Kanalkampf—were merely a prelude to the battle for air superiority which was a necessary precondition for Operation Seelöwe, the proposed invasion of the United Kingdom. Anti-shipping operations fell by 239 sorties in August to 90 in September 1940.|$|E
