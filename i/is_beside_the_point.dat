500|$|Should science aim to {{determine}} ultimate truth, {{or are there}} questions that science cannot answer? [...] Scientific realists claim that science aims at truth and that one ought to regard scientific theories as true, approximately true, or likely true. [...] Conversely, scientific anti-realists argue that science does not aim (or at least does not succeed) at truth, especially truth about unobservables like electrons or other universes. [...] Instrumentalists argue that scientific theories should only be evaluated on whether they are useful. In their view, whether theories are true or not <b>is</b> <b>beside</b> <b>the</b> <b>point,</b> because the purpose of science is to make predictions and enable effective technology.|$|E

2500|$|Following the {{production}} of series one, Davies took Clarke and Coduri out for dinner to discuss their contracts for the second series. Davies reveals that Clarke was excited about Mickey's development in the second series, particularly having the chance to carry a large gun and be an action hero. Clarke noted that he was [...] "amazed" [...] by the scripts for the second series, as he felt Mickey had at times been written as a [...] "buffoon". He felt that the character had gotten [...] "progressively braver" [...] throughout the series and that as an actor he found it fulfilling that people had gone from disliking the character to saying [...] "how they love this guy now". Mickey's character arc sees him join the Doctor and Rose as a companion, becoming in turn the shows first ethnic minority companion. Billie Piper explained that this upsets Rose initially because she [...] "likes to keep her life separate" [...] and [...] "wants The Doctor to herself because she's selfish like that". Tennant stated that through his actions, Mickey [...] "earns his spot on board the TARDIS". Clarke stated that he didn't {{want to focus on}} his status as the show's first ethnic minority companion, stating [...] "the fact that I happen to be a black actor <b>is</b> <b>beside</b> <b>the</b> <b>point,</b> I'm an actor first". However, he felt that it provided a positive effect in that young fans of ethnic origin would no longer have to be a monster or alien when role-playing characters from the series.|$|E

[...] "If a Nazi regime persecutes Jews, it is not, within the ordinary meaning of language, engaging in persecution on account of political opinion; and if a fundamentalist Moslem regime persecutes democrats, it is not engaging in persecution on account of religion.
