He also became a lightweight boxer. McCain did well in academic subjects that interested him, such as literature and history, but studied only enough to pass subjects that gave him difficulty, such as mathematics. He came into conflict with higher-ranking personnel and did not always obey the rules, which contributed to a low class rank (894 of 899), despite a high IQ. McCain graduated in 1958.|$|E

5|$|Born into {{a family}} of the Lincolnshire landed gentry, Boucherett became {{involved}} in local politics in Lincolnshire, and (owing mainly to his marriage) with artistic and mercantile circles in London. He {{was the chairman of}} the Grimsby Haven Company, which oversaw the reopening and expansion of Grimsby's first dock. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> of the artist Sir Thomas Lawrence and the proprietor of Willingham, Lincolnshire, where he constructed his country seat, Willingham House, in 1790. For his investment in the Haven Company, he received the support of Lord Yarborough, one of its main investors and a principal land-owner in Grimsby; owing largely to Lord Yarborough's patronage, Boucherett was returned as the Member of Parliament for that borough at the 1796 election. He was not a frequent voter, but used his position to further the interests of his corporation. Nonetheless, the company met with financial difficulties after it opened the Harbour in 1800. In 1803, Boucherett resigned his seat in favour of Yarborough's heir and pursued a quieter political life. He died in a carriage accident in 1815.|$|E
5|$|<b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> of Queen guitarist and {{astrophysicist}} Brian May, who was {{an occasional}} guest on The Sky at Night. May bought Moore's Selsey home in 2008, leasing {{it back to him}} for a peppercorn rent the same day to provide financial security. May, Moore and Chris Lintott co-wrote a book Bang! The Complete History of the Universe. In February 2011, Moore completed (with Robin Rees and Iain Nicolson) his comprehensive Patrick Moore's Data Book of Astronomy for Cambridge University Press. In 1986 he was identified as the co-author of a book published in 1954 called Flying Saucer from Mars, attributed to Cedric Allingham, which was intended as a money-making venture and practical joke on UFO believers; Moore never admitted his involvement. He once joined the Flat Earth Society as an ironic joke.|$|E
5|$|As the war progressed, Hitler's {{attention}} became {{focused on}} foreign affairs and {{the conduct of the}} war, to the exclusion of all else. Hess, not directly engaged in either of these endeavours, became increasingly sidelined from the affairs of the nation and from Hitler's attention; Bormann had successfully supplanted Hess in many of his duties and usurped his position at Hitler's side. Also concerned that Germany would face a war on two fronts as plans progressed for Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of the Soviet Union scheduled to take place in 1941, Hess boldly decided to attempt to bring Britain to the negotiating table by travelling there himself to seek meetings with the British government. He asked the advice of Albrecht Haushofer, who suggested several potential contacts in Britain. Hess settled on fellow aviator Douglas Douglas-Hamilton, the Duke of Hamilton, whom he had never met. On Hess's instructions, Haushofer wrote to Hamilton in September 1940, but the letter was intercepted by MI5 and Hamilton did not see it until March 1941. Hamilton was chosen in the mistaken belief {{that he was one of}} the leaders of an opposition party opposed to war with Germany, and because <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> of Haushofer.|$|E
