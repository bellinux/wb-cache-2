25|$|Simultanagnosia: {{where the}} patient can only {{describe}} single objects without {{the ability to}} perceive it {{as a component of}} a set of details or objects in a context (as in a scenario, e.g. the forest <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>trees).</b>|$|E
25|$|If a {{tree species}} in a dense forest grows taller than {{surrounding}} tree species, it {{is able to}} absorb more of the incoming sunlight. However, less sunlight is then available <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> that are shaded by the taller tree, thus interspecific competition. Leopards and lions can also be in interspecific competition, since both species feed on the same prey, and can be negatively impacted by the presence of the other because they will have less food.|$|E
50|$|No {{specific}} aging statistics <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> are available, however, {{based on}} its size, numerous forestry sources, including the county's historical marker <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>tree,</b> estimate that <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> is at least 2,000 years old.|$|R

Since we use constant timestep <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> part, <b>the</b> calculation costs of the integration of particles per unit time <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> part is proportional to O ([...] θ^- 3 N N/Δ t_soft [...]).|$|R

25|$|In {{commercial}} forestry, the transplanting of crop {{trees in}} new locales often requires an accompanying ectomycorrhizal partner. This {{is especially true}} of trees that have a high degree of specificity for their mycobiont, or trees that are being planted far from their native habitat among novel fungal species. This has been shown time and again in plantations involving obligate ectomycorrhizal trees, such as Eucalyptus and Pinus species. Mass planting of these species often require human addition of inoculum from native EcM fungi in order <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> to prosper.|$|E
25|$|Contractors begin soliciting {{ornaments}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> {{along the}} Pathway of Peace {{about the same}} time, usually around a theme. Other vendors begin contacting nationally known singers, performers, and the providers of children's characters (such as Warner Bros. Animation, Sesame Workshop, or The Walt Disney Company) for their availability. Various contractors build the decorations, depending on what is required. In 2000, Brilliant Electric Sign Co. of Cleveland, Ohio, spent four weeks building the 200 ornaments required for that year's display. Many of the decorations in 2000 and 2002 were manufactured with the same high-tech plastic {{used to make the}} faceplates of astronaut helmets.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the trailers being swept away by the torrent, many houses, with people still in or on top of them, were swept into Lake Ontario. Many people were saved when the houses in which they took shelter were stopped by trees from going into the lake. The reeve, Marie Curtis, {{was quoted in the}} Globe and Mail saying that if it were not <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>trees,</b> half of the village would have been swept into the lake. She also described a house with 35 people on its roof that was stopped by two trees from floating into the lake.|$|E

This is {{also a part of}} the green belt that runs through the fairy world. It is all part of Aeval’s plant network. Though others may doubt it, Aeval always knew that the trees saw and remembered everything. Over time they have been used to hide treasures and secrets. In The Book of Air, someone within the fairy world has turned the trees to gold, keeping them from “speaking” with Aeval. The trees are being used to protect a key – the very key the Clockmaker needs to fix his Time Synchronization Machine.

500|$|Molyneux {{said that}} might have been [...] "insanely ambitious" [...] with regard to the {{standards}} they set themselves for the graphics, because the system requirements were high and much of the custom software needed to be written. One such program was a terrain-editing tool named Leadhead. He stated that they went from [...] "bizarre ideas", to [...] "the best game I have ever seen". The villagers' artificial intelligence had to be restricted by giving some control to the Village Centre as there was no limit on the number of villagers. Molyneux said of the creature's artificial intelligence, [...] "part of the game itself learns from everything you do and tailors itself to you", and described the creature as [...] "an astonishing piece of work". He also commented that the last months of development were [...] "the hardest any of us has ever had to work", and that [...] "without the right team, this game never would have happened." [...] The models <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>trees,</b> bushes, and other landscape features were created in 3D Studio Max, and initial graphics development was done in 2D using Adobe Photoshop. Later development was done using other custom software. Clan multiplayer, where multiple players play as one god, was developed in a rush; its interface had to be developed in two weeks. Black & Whites online community was handled by two servers in London, where the clan creatures were stored to minimise the possibility of cheating.|$|E

2500|$|A [...] {{forest on}} the {{property}} known as the Montpelier Forest (also known as the Landmark Forest) was designated as a National Natural Landmark by the National Park Service in 1987. The forest was recognized as {{being one of the}} best examples of a mature Piedmont forest dominated by tulip poplar and spicebush; various species of oak and hickory are also common in the forest. The relatively undisturbed forest contains several trees up to 300 years old. Ideal growing conditions at the site, including fertile soils, allow <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> to attain great size; tulip poplars attain heights of up to [...] by the time they reach 50 years of age, and some trees have been measured to have diameters of up to [...]|$|E
2500|$|A pre-Slavic period began [...] 1500 to 1000BC, whereby certain phonological {{changes and}} {{linguistic}} contacts did not disperse evenly through all Balto-Slavic dialects. The development into Proto-Slavic probably occurred {{along the southern}} periphery of the Proto-Balto-Slavic continuum. The most archaic Slavic hydronyms are found here, along the middle Dnieper, Pripet and upper Dniester rivers. This agrees well {{with the fact that}} inherited Common Slavic vocabulary does not include detailed terminology for physical surface features peculiar of the mountains or the steppe, nor any relating to the sea, to coastal features, littoral flora or fauna, or salt water fishes. On the other hand, it does include well-developed terminology for inland bodies of water (lakes, river, swamps) and kinds of forest (deciduous and coniferous), <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>trees,</b> plants, animals and birds indigenous to the temperate forest zone, and for the fish native to its waters.|$|E

Some seeds are shed when the cone scales shrink during hot weather in late summer, but most are liberated when the cone dries from fire heat or is damaged by insects.|$|E
2500|$|Between April 11 and June 19, 2013, the {{railroad}} {{was in a}} crisis following the collapse of Tunnel #1 on April 11. The financially strapped railroad sought donations for $300,000 to hire an outside company to remove the blockage. Had the funding not been raised, the cash-starved railroad would have shut down. On June 19, a Redwood tree conservation group announced they would buy all of the Redwood trees along the 40-mile right-of-way, and would pay {{the railroad}} well more than their goal <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>trees.</b> The railroad resumed full service in August. Tunnel #1 was once again closed in 2016 after sustaining damage from the 2015-16 El Nino, but the railway was in a better position, having equipment at the Willits {{end of the line}} (which was not the case during the 2013 crisis) to allow the running of trains to Northspur; trains from the Fort Bragg end are limited to running on a seven-mile trip officially called the [...] "Pudding Creek Express"; no announcements regarding the status of Tunnel #1 have been made recently, though they are fully committed to its reopening.|$|E
