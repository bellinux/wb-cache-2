2500|$|Scleral buckle {{surgery is}} an {{established}} treatment {{in which the}} eye surgeon sews one or more silicone bands (or tyres) to the sclera (the white outer coat of the eyeball). The bands push {{the wall of the}} eye inward against the retinal hole, closing the break or reducing fluid flow through it and reducing the effect of vitreous traction thereby allowing the retina to re-attach. Cryotherapy (freezing) is applied around retinal breaks prior to placing the buckle. [...] Often subretinal fluid is drained as part of the buckling procedure. The buckle remains in situ. The most common side effect of a scleral operation is myopic shift. That is, the operated eye will be more short sighted after the operation. Radial scleral buckle is indicated for U-shaped tears or <b>Fishmouth</b> tears, and posterior breaks. Circumferential scleral buckle is indicated for multiple breaks, anterior breaks and wide breaks. Encircling buckles are indicated for breaks covering more than 2 quadrants of retinal area, lattice degeneration located on more than 2 quadrant of retinal area, undetectable breaks, and proliferative vitreous retinopathy.|$|E

50|$|The opening match, a Tag Team, was {{originally}} announced {{as the team}} of Hombre Bala, Jr. and Super Halcon, Jr. vs. Bobby Zavala and Disturbio, but on October 9 {{it was announced that}} Hombre Bala, Jr. and Super Halcon, Jr. had been replaced by Leono and Sensei, with no explanation for the change given. During the third fall Distubio was pinned and eliminated from the match, only for him to remove his boot and use it against Sensei and Leono to allow Bobby Zavala to gain the third and deciding fall for his team. In the second match tecnico Tritón unveiled a new mask design, including a stylized fish fin running down the back of his mask and a <b>fishmouth</b> pattern around the mouth opening of his mask, Tritón teamed up with Fuego and Starman, facing off against Los Guerreros Tuareg (Arkangel de la Muerte and Skándalo) and Okumura.

40|$|The 'fishmouth phenomenon' seen in some {{previously}} treated retinal detachments {{is associated}} with large horeshoe tears and scleral buckling techniques. A method of treating patients with this complication is described in which scleral buckling with implant or explant is not used. The technique utilises intravitreal air tamponade with cryopexy and gives good results. The incidence of patients developing the <b>fishmouth</b> phenomenon as a complication of parimary simple retinal detachment surgery is much lower when an intravitreal air technique is used than the expected incidence following a primary scleral buckling operation...|$|E
40|$|Plant macrofossils from packrat middens in two southeastern Utah caves outline {{development}} of modern plant zonation {{from the late}} Wisconsin. Allen Canyon Cave (2195 m) and <b>Fishmouth</b> Cave (1585 m) are located along a continuous gradient of outcropping Navajo Sandstone that extends from the Abajo Mountains south to the San Juan River. By holding the site constant, changes in the floral composition for a plot of less than one hectare can be observed, even if sporadically, over tens of millennia. At Allen Canyon Cave, engelmann spruce-alpine fir forest {{was replaced by the}} present vegetation consisting of pinyon-juniper woodland on exposed ridgetops and cliffside stands of Douglas fir, ponderosa pine, and aspen. Xerophytic woodland plants such as pinyon, Plains prickly pear, and narrowleaf yucca arrived sometime in the middle Holocene between 7200 and 3400 B. P. At <b>Fishmouth</b> Cave, Utah juniper in Holocene middens replaced blue spruce, limber pine, Douglas fir, and dwarf and Rocky Mountain junipers in late Wisconsin samples. Disharmonious associations for the late Wisconsin occur only at the lower site with the xerophytes Mormon tea, Plains prickly pear, and narrowleaf yucca growing alongside subalpine conifers. One possible explanation involves the late Wisconsin absence of ponderosa and pinyon pines from the Colorado Plateaus. Released from competition at their lower limits, subalpine conifers were able to expand into lower elevations and mix with xerophytic plants found today in understories of pinyon-juniper and ponderosa pine woodlands. Quantitative climatic estimates are derived for the late Wisconsin by applying vertical lapse rates for temperature and precipitation to the amount of vegetation depression. The <b>Fishmouth</b> Cave sequence indicates a minimum lowering of 850 m for blue spruce, limber pine, and dwarf juniper. A depression of at least 700 m for engelmann spruce and alpine fir is suggested for the Allen Canyon locality. Use of conservatively low lapse rates for stations below 2080 m yields a 3 - 4 °C cooling from present mean annual temperature and 35 to 60 percent more rainfall than today. Steeper lapse rates associated with more mountainous terrain suggest a 5 °C lowering in temperature and up to 120 percent increase over modern precipitation...|$|E
40|$|Foliation boudinage {{is a form}} of boudinage that {{develops}} in foliated rocks independent of lithology contrast. This paper describes foliation boudins from the Cine Massif in SW Turkey and the Furka Pass-Urseren Zone in central Switzerland. Four common types of foliation boudin structures can be distinguished in the field, named after vein geometries in their boudin necks in sections normal to the boudin axis: lozenge-, crescent-, X- and double crescent-type. The boudin necks are mostly filled with massive quartz in large single crystals, commonly associated with tourmaline, feldspar and biotite and in some cases with chlorite spherulites. The presence of blocky crystals and chlorite spherulites suggests that these veins formed as open, fluid-filled cavities during the initiation and development of foliation boudin structures, even in ductilely deforming gneiss at a depth of mid-crustal levels (7 - 10 kbar). The presence of cavities allowed the formation of closed <b>fishmouth</b> structures that are typical for many foliation boudins. The geometry of foliation boudin structures mainly depends on initial fracture orientation, propagation of the fracture during further deformation, and flow type in the wall rock...|$|E
40|$|Clinical and cytogenetical {{findings}} are reported and discussed on two siblings with discordant phenotypes despite having both a terminal 11 q deletion and a distal 12 q duplication resulting from an unbalanced segregation {{of a balanced}} translocation t(11 : 12) (q 23 :q 24. 1) mat. The oldest child, a girl, is the index patient. Her clinical features include intrauterine and postnatal growth retardation, fetal distress, mild hypotonia, early feeding difficulties, moderate developmental delay, especially in language acquisition, a velopharyngeal insufficiency with repeated otorhinopharyngeal infections, facial dysmorphism, heart ventricular septal defect, and abnormal hyperactive behaviour with sometimes autistic tendencies. The facial dysmorphic features notably consist of microcephaly, hypertelorism, large palpebral fissures, large eyes with alternant divergent strabismus, long eyelashes, a long and broad nasal bridge, a short "crested" nose with salient tip, a <b>fishmouth</b> with large spaces between teeth and flat palate, retrognathism, large ears and multiple dimples. The second affected child is a boy showing low birthweight, moderate developmental retardation with mainly no active language at 32 months, behaviour abnormalities with an autistic tendency, and no major physical anomalies apart from a slight facial hypotonia with often open mouth, dimples on the shoulders and right cryptorchidism. The authors stress the variable clinical expression of the chromosomal imbalance in this family resulting in low birthweight, developmental delay, abnormal behaviour, but different degrees of physical features and dysmorphism. The possible contribution {{of each of the}} two aneusomies to the phenotype is discussed. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Five {{cases of}} painful diaphyseal {{pseudarthrosis}} of the distal phalanx {{were treated with}} a longitudinal compression AO mini screw, without bone graft, and all healed uneventfully in 3 to 4 months. Journal of Hand Surgery (British and European Volume, 1995) 20 B: 5 : 618 - 619 Delayed union and pseudarthrosis of transverse and open fractures of the shaft of the distal phalanx receive brief mention in some textbooks (Biddulph, 1988), little being written about their treatment (Read, 1982). Richards et al (1988) reported a case of such a fracture treated with a Herbert screw. During the last 10 years five such cases of painful delayed union have been seen, 3 to 4 months after the original fracture, open i three of them (Botelheiro, 1993). There were three thumbs (Fig 1), one index and one middle finger.

40|$|This {{article is}} {{dermatological}} atlas of the morphologic presentations of Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS). It includes: superficial abscesses (boils, furnucles, carbuncles), abscesses that are subcutaneous and suprafascial, pyogenic granulomas, cysts, painful erythematous papules and plaques, folliculitis, open ulcerations, chronic sinuses, fistulas, sinus tracts, scrotal and genital lyphedema, dermal contractures, keloids (some {{that are still}} pitted with follicular ostia), scarring, skin tags, fibrosis, anal fissures, fistulas (i. e. circinate, linear, arcuate), scarring folliculitis of the buttocks (from mild to cigarette-like scarring), condyloma like lesions in intertrigous areas, <b>fishmouth</b> scars, acne inversa, honey-comb scarring, cribiform scarring, tombstone comedones, and morphia-like plaques. HS can co-exist with other follicular diseases such as pilonidal cysts, dissecting cellulitis, acne conglobata, pyoderma gangrenosum, and acanthosis nigricans. In sum, the variety of presentations of HS as shown by these images supports the supposition that HS is a reaction pattern. HS is a follicular based diseased and its manifestations involve a multitude of follicular pathologies [1, 2]. It {{is also known as}} acne inversa (AI) because of one manifestation that involves the formation of open comedones on areas besides the face. It is as yet unclear why HS is so protean in its manifestations. HS severity is assessed using the Hurley Staging System (Table 1). It also remains unclear why hidradentitis may remain limited to Hurley Stage 1, evolve to the more confluent (Hurley Stage 2), or progress even further to the fully confluent (Hurley Stage 3). In addition, HS can be associated with other follicular based diseases such as pilonidal cysts (PCs) of the sacrum and buttocks, dissecting cellulitis (DC), and acne conglobata (AC), which usually involves the face, chest, When HS occurs with PCs, DC, and/or AC it {{is referred to as the}} follicular occlusion triad or tetrad [2]. HS can more rarely be associated with pyoderma gagrenosum (PG) or Crohn disease (CD), other inflammatory diseases of the skin that are not follicular. The reason for this is unclear [2]. What AC, DC, HS, CD, and PG share is that they occur in bacterially rich environments. HS probably occurs with acanthosis nigricans because many HS patients are obese [2].
