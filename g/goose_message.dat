30|$|In smart substation, {{multicast}} transmission is adopted for SMV and <b>GOOSE</b> <b>messages.</b> Namely, switch will broadcast and transmit SMV and <b>GOOSE</b> <b>messages,</b> and all intelligent devices will receive related messages, {{which will be}} filtered by network card and then be transmitted to application module, thus the network load of SMV and GOOSE will have influences on the intelligent devices in the whole network. In present smart substation, the SMV flow and GOOSE flow of one bay do not exceed 8  Mbps and 0.1  Mbps respectively. For a substation with 30 bays, the load of process level network in the whole substation won’t exceed 240  Mbps. If Gigabit LAN is adopted, the load of process level network won’t exceed 25 %. This flow is relatively small for switch, but not so for intelligent devices like protection devices and BCU, etc., and the load of process level network needs to be reduced by proper means. Process level messages may be isolated in one bay through {{virtual local area network}} (VLAN), static multicast management or GARP multicast registration protocol (GMRP), in order to control the flow of process level data.

Rapid penetrations of communication into power grid, and growing concerns about cyber security have attracted significant attention towards smart grid cyber security. Cyber security in the smart grid must be carefully designed to meet power system operation’s functional and reliability requirements. This thesis discusses {{issues related to the}} security of power system communication and their counter measures. It focuses on development of security mechanisms for secure substation communication, and analyzes the impact of security overhead on communication performance. We analyze IPSec as a security protocol on a substation gateway, and propose a secure substation gateway solution. Since security gateway solution does not provide sufficient security against an inside attacker, providing cyber security for each critical IED independently is required. Due to computational constraints, Intelligent Electronic Devices (IEDs) do not have cyber security measures implemented in them. Hence, we propose a security device that provides required cyber-security for an IED. Security device has a bump-in-the-wire IPSec implementation. We examine IPSec tunnel configurations with di erent encryption and authentication algorithms to identify the proper IPSec tunnel configuration for the security device at IED level.

30|$|Another {{feature that}} {{has been added to}} Edition 2 is the possibility, to {{subscribe}} to GOOSE messages or sampled value messages from simulation or test equipment. The approach is explained in Fig.  3. GOOSE or sampled value messages have a flag indicating if the message is the original message or if it is a message produced by a simulation. On the other side, the IED has in the logical node LPHD (the logical node for the physical device or IED) a data object defining, if the IED shall receive the original GOOSE or sampled value messages or simulated ones. If the data object Sim is set to TRUE, the IED will receive for all GOOSE messages it is subscribing the ones with the simulation flag set to TRUE. If for a specific <b>GOOSE</b> <b>message</b> no simulated message exists, it will continue to receive the original message. That feature can only be activated for the whole IED, since the IED shall receive either the simulated message or the original message. Receiving both messages at the same time would create a different load situation and therefore create wrong test results.|$|E

While security aspects of power grid network have been studied much, security mechanisms are rarely adopted in power gird communication network. For security issues, strict timing requirements are defined in IEC 61850 for mission critical messages (i. e., GOOSE). In this paper, we apply security algorithms (i. e., MD- 5, SHA- 1, and RSA) and measure their processing time and transmission delay of secured mission critical messages.
