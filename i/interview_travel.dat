40|$|Future adaptations in {{vehicle design}} should be linked {{in some parts}} to the age-related changes often faced by the older users. The aim of this {{research}} is to investigate the multiple age-related changes of Chinese older vehicle users in order to assist designers to better understand current and future older users’ needs. Although qualitative interpretative approaches have rarely been applied in the field of traffic gerontology research, they are widely used in current design research to explore persons’ lived experiences, behaviours and emotions. Therefore, this study employed qualitative research methods consisting of observation, <b>interview,</b> <b>travel</b> logbook and co-discovery to explore older vehicle users’ travel needs. The interpretative analysis confirmed that multiple methods such as <b>interview,</b> <b>travel</b> logbook, and co-discovery are useful to gain a holistic understanding of older drivers’ travel needs. However, the one journey driving observation cannot provide valuable categories to explore older users’ multiple travel needs due to daily living context absence in the one trip experiment. It is clear that the useful methods for determining research for older users will depend on the product. The findings demonstrate that Chinese future older generations are more concerned about their age-related differences from social and cultural perspective rather than physiological perspective. Social and cultural context play important role to shape older vehicle users’ future travel needs. From design a point of view, understanding the social activity and cultural context surrounds older vehicle users should make it possible to predict older drivers’ needs related to vehicle property.

This paper presents findings of exploratory {{analysis of the data}} collected in this test. Clustering of day patterns from FMS data reveals large day-to-day variability of user behavior, which cannot be captured by a snapshot with a one-day survey. Even the high cross-sectional variability from the larger sample size of a traditional survey would not have achieved the comprehensive set of heterogeneous patterns as provided by FMS. Some common problems in traditional surveys – such as under-reporting of trips, over-estimation of travel times, and inaccuracy of locations and times – can apparently be reduced by FMS. The FMS data, as compared to HITS, have higher resolution and better accuracy. In addition, FMS is well suited to collect multi-day data as additional costs are marginal and user burden reduces overtime.

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 28 th Annual Southern African Transport Conference 6 - 9 July 2009 "Sustainable Transport", CSIR International Convention Centre, Pretoria, South Africa. Internationally, travel diaries of various forms have served as the principal means of collecting revealed preference travel data. Household <b>interview</b> <b>travel</b> survey experiences in African cities,however, have demonstrated that the collection of travel diary data is problematic for both respondents and interviewers. This paper reports {{on the development of}} a travel diary instrument for use in a planned 24 -hour recall home interview survey in Cape Town, Dar es Salaam and Nairobi. As part of the development of this survey instrument an experiment was undertaken to assess the appropriateness and feasibility of different travel diary forms. In {{other parts of the world}} travel diaries have taken three main forms: trip-based, activity-based and place-based diaries. Variations of these three basic diary forms include: the recording of trips in either tabular or sequential question format; the prospective or retrospective request for respondent recall; and the use of memory joggers. The paper describes the impact of alternative travel diary forms on respondent burden, trip and trip stage recall rates, interviewer cognition and item recording or nonresponse errors, and respondent cognition and item recording errors. On the basis of the experiment findings, it is concluded that place-based diaries in sequential question format, with associated memory joggers, are likely to yield highest rates of trip recall and lowest rates of measurement error and item non-response in city contexts with respondent populations similar in socio-demographic nature to those in Cape Town and Dar es Salaam.

40|$|Households {{are one of}} {{the core}} agents in the urban system. Household {{behavior}} plays a crucial role in urban system performance and can profoundly shape the urban landscape. This thesis examines households' behavior in the housing market. Current integrated urban systems models provide few insights into the capability of random bidding models in simulating household residential choice behavior; rarely have random bidding models been applied in a micro-simulation context, due to insufficient data. Therefore, the main goal of this thesis is to explore a possible technique - Multiple Imputation - to integrate observations from dissimilar data sets to meet the data requirements of random bidding models of the housing market, and to test the capability of such a model. The data used in this thesis come from two distinct data sets: 1) Singapore's Household <b>Interview</b> <b>Travel</b> Survey 2008, providing household demographic, socioeconomic and travel information; and 2) the Urban Redevelopment Authority's Real Estate Information System, which includes detailed descriptions of attributes of private dwellings that were purchased during 2008. Observations from these data sets, households and dwelling units, are firstly matched using Multiple Imputation; the resulting data are used to estimate a random bidding model using the bid-auction approach in a micro-simulation context - providing a rare example of a microscopic application of random bidding models. This thesis validates the effectiveness of the Multiple Imputation method for matching observations from household and real estate data sets for estimating behavioral models. The estimation of the random bidding model shows that family structure is the most important factor shaping a household's willingness-to-pay for dwelling attributes. Households with children apparently more strongly consider the living environment for their children. Household income influences references as well, {{but not as much as}} family structure does. In general, households' willingness-to-pay increase with income level. The limitations of this thesis include the need to and means of grouping households and the few variables to represent dwelling and zonal attributes. Future research should aim to better represent dwelling units and their neighborhoods as well as incorporate more behavioral economics to better understand and predict household behavior in the housing market. by Weixuan Li.

40|$|This thesis {{begins by}} {{thoroughly}} reviewing classical theories of adoption {{such as the}} diffusion of innovation theory, and the technology acceptance model, and subsequently analyses literature on pertinent theories which have been highlighted as drivers of adoption such as the Resource-Based View, Firm Strategy, Culture and the Digital Divide. Prior to this however, the afore-mentioned classical adoption theories were contrasted with the Post-Internet debate which explored Information Asymetry and Disintermediation. Having conducted this review {{it was determined that}} the leadership/ownership role had not been sufficiently emphasized in technology adoption, therefore this work sought to more clearly identify these personal factors in combination with the previously explored factors. The overarching theory of Organizational Decision-Making was used to provide a framework to identify drivers of decision-making processes in general and then apply these to the internet adoption context. This thesis aims to identify the combination of antecedents of technology adoption for travel firms and distil factors to identify the key determinant of the adoption of the internet for sales and marketing purposes in small, owner-managed travel firms. It examines the firm characteristics which are associated with adoption behaviour such as strategy and resources, as well as external factors such as culture and the digital divide. In addition to external and firm factors, personal factors such as ownership and leadership are explored at various stages of adoption. A predominantly qualitative methodology was used to <b>interview</b> <b>travel</b> agencies in the context of Jamaica. All firms which have similar characteristics in terms of ownership and management structure, in particular where owners are themselves the managers and provide leadership for the organization, were interviewed. The owner-managers of these firms were interviewed to gather deep perspectives from local industry experts on industry challenges, current technology involvement and future directions. Exploratory descriptive quantitative methods were used to analyze firm characteristics and their relationships to internet adoption for sales and marketing as well as the intention to use these technologies in firms, while a deeper exploration into owner-managers was achieved through qualitative enquiry. A pilot study and 2 phases of data collection were carried out. The findings indicate that the leadership role is more significant than has been previously posited. The contribution to knowledge is new in that it takes a unique approach to an understanding of technology adoption in firms by creating a comprehensive conceptual framework for adoption based on previous research and then creates a model that shows the factors and variables that drive adoption at each stage of the adoption process from a personal leadership perspective as well as the organizational perspective. Ultimately it is hoped that this focus on each stage of adoption will provide insights into firm adoption behaviour as a consequence of leadership characteristics...|$|E
