30|$|Information {{retrieval}} {{results are}} usually {{presented as a}} list of <b>documents</b> <b>sorted</b> by relevance (similarity) to the query. It is often enough to present a small set of documents that a user can browse to locate the needed information. For this reason, IR models are commonly evaluated by their ability to retrieve relevant documents at the first N positions of a list using Top-N or Hit@N metrics. Another widely used metric for the effectiveness of IR models is the mean average precision (MAP). MAP provides a single-figure measure {{of the quality of}} information retrieval when a query may have multiple relevant documents (Manning et al. 2008).|$|R

40|$|International audienceScript {{identification}} {{has always}} been a topic of much research interest in the field of document analysis. The accurate determination of the identity of the script is paramount to many post-processing steps such as <b>document</b> <b>sorting,</b> translation and in determining the choice of linguistic resources to use for OCR or handwriting recognition. However, few works exist with regards to the identification of online handwritten scripts, partly due to the large variations and challenges innate in handwritten scripts. This paper proposes a novel approach for online handwritten script identification based on the Information Retrieval model. We attempt to identify among three script families; Arabic, Roman and Tamil scripts, which attained an average accuracy of 93. 3 % from our results. This signifies promising potential in utilizing Information Retrieval models for script identification...|$|R
40|$|Traditional {{information}} retrieval systems return documents in a list, where <b>documents</b> are <b>sorted</b> {{according to their}} publication dates, titles, or similarities to the user query. Users select interested documents by searching them through the returned list. In a distributed environment, documents are returned {{from more than one}} information server. A simple document list is not efficient to present a large volume data to the users. In this paper, we propose a two-dimensional visualization scheme for Internet resource discovery.

In addition, it provides a customized view that arranges data in favor of user's preference terms.

40|$|CAMIR is a {{collection}} of programs for running information retrieval experiments. The files handled by CAMIR consist of binary records in VBS format. Each record consists of N words (i. e. 4 N bytes) where N is at least 2 and has no effective upper bound. The first word contains N, the length of the record. The second word contains a numeric identifier for the record in the file. This will be called the id-word. Words 3 to N contain data for the particular record. All, or almost all, data handled by CAMIR goes into this form, even when it not quite convenient. In fact this form of data is quite suitable for almost all of the experimental work that we have been doing.

40|$|During receptor-mediated endocytosis, receptors are transported {{from one}} {{membrane}} compartment to another. From each compartment, {{they can be}} routed to different destinations, and intracellular transport therefore requires sorting (reviewed in references 18, 54). The best <b>documented</b> <b>sorting</b> is the one which functions at the plasma membrane to concentrate receptors in clathrin-coated pits. It involves internalization signals, short peptides in the cytosolic part of receptors which have been classified in two groups, a tyrosine based motif and a di-leucine based motif (reviewed in reference 49). After internalization from the plasma membrane, receptors rapidly reach early/recycling endosomes. From there, some receptors recycle back to the cell surface while others are sorted to different destinations (46). Recycling to the plasma membrane is generally considered as the default pathway (34, 54). For receptors to exit from the recycling pathway and move to other intracellular destinations (e. g., in most cases towards late endosomes and lysosomes, or to the trans-Golgi network or major histocompatibility complex class II compartments) or to new domains on the cell surface (as in transcytosis) requires selective routing and depends upon the possession of additional, specific sorting signals...|$|R

40|$|Does social {{promotion}} perpetuate shortfalls in student achievement, or can low-achieving students {{catch up with}} their peers when they are pushed ahead? Using data from Brazilian primary schools, this paper presents evidence of substantial catch up among socially promoted students. After <b>documenting</b> <b>sorting</b> across schools {{in response to the}} policy, in particular away from gated- promotion private schools, we show that {{social promotion}} cycles has no significant effect on municipality enrolment figures or on the percentage of students dropping out mid-year. Cohorts of students exposed to episodes of social pro- motion display higher rates of age-appropriate study than their peers who faced the threat of repetition each year: by age eleven, 5. 6 fewer students out of 100 have fallen behind in their studies, while 5. 1 fewer students out of 100 are two or more years delayed. These gains, which arise mechanically during the period of social promotion, are highly persistent over time – even through educational stages which are typically high-stakes. This evidence suggests that, absent the social promotion policy, retention rates in Brazilian primary schools are inefficiently high: many promoted students successfully pass gateway exams after being pushed ahead, and go on to complete junior primary school on time.

(2) Adaptive governance as a bottom-up strategy giving priority to institutional adaptation policy and collaborative polices for responding to climate change has become the hot direction in recent years.
