5|$|Because Corman did {{not believe}} that The Little Shop of Horrors had much {{financial}} prospect after its initial theatrical run, he did not bother to copyright it, resulting in the film <b>falling</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> public domain. Because of this, the film is widely available in copies of varying quality. The film was originally screened theatrically in the widescreen aspect ratio of 1.85:1, but has largely only been seen in open matte at an aspect ratio of 1.33:1 since its original theatrical release.|$|E

5|$|Hōshō {{was fitted}} with a net used as a crash barrier aft of the forward {{elevator}} between 10 March and 2 July 1925. The barrier was intended to prevent landing aircraft from colliding with aircraft preparing to take off, and stop them from <b>falling</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> open elevator well. The barrier was hydraulically operated and could be erected in three seconds.|$|E
5|$|In December 2016, a homebrew remake was {{released}} that, {{for the most}} part, kept the original game the same. However, the mechanic of E.T. <b>falling</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> pit was amended so that a keypress was required before the player fell into the pit. The holes were also visually removed and were discovered with an indicator at the bottom left of the screen.|$|E
5|$|Some comets meet a more {{spectacular}} end – either <b>falling</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Sun or smashing into a planet or other body. Collisions between comets and planets or moons were {{common in the}} early Solar System: {{some of the many}} craters on the Moon, for example, may have been caused by comets. A recent collision of a comet with a planet occurred in July 1994 when Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9 broke up into pieces and collided with Jupiter.|$|E

In the skydiving, rocket belt, and hang glider modes, landing on moving {{platforms}} rewards players with a perfect score, and a bonus stage for extra points may be earned by <b>falling</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> water of a target area. These stages include maneuvering a diving penguin into a pool, bouncing a winged man across a series of trampolines, and flying another winged man as far as possible.|$|E
5|$|The Model 1897 {{was used}} by American troops for {{purposes}} in World War I other than a force multiplier. American soldiers who were skilled at trap shooting were armed with these guns and stationed where they could fire at enemy hand grenades in midair. This would deflect the grenades from <b>falling</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> American trenches and therefore protect American soldiers.|$|E
5|$|The crust-like genera Boidinia, Gloeopeniophorella, and Pseudoxenasma, {{formerly}} {{placed in}} the Corticiaceae or Gloeocystidiellaceae, are now classified in the Russulaceae and basal to the clade of mushroom-forming species described above. Studies have so far failed to clearly circumscribe and place these genera within the family. Boidinia in its current extent is polyphyletic, with some species not <b>falling</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Russulaceae.|$|E

5|$|The {{wilderness}} area is managed by Metsähallitus {{a government agency}} which manages the state-owned land in Finland. The area is not a strictly protected area, instead <b>falling</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Natura 2000 network. Limitations include the mandatory maintenance of forests in their natural state and a ban on logging. The sale and leasing of land is prohibited, as is construction of permanent roads and mining.|$|E
5|$|As an example, the {{execution}} scene in The Kingdom of This World puts European and autochthonous cultures in opposition {{through the use}} of the spectator-performer relationship. In this spectacle situation, Carpentier is able to juxtapose the Europeans' experience of Macandal's body <b>falling</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> flames with the autochthonous (Afro-Haitian) experience of Macandal's body flying off the stake. Through the different, mutable views of the performance that he creates, Carpentier is able to represent an unstable cultural identity. As a second example, the scene that Ti Noel constructs around himself after the sacking of the Sans-Souci Palace presents the reader with a dramatic rehearsal in which Ti Noel represents culturally mobile subjectivity by performing different identities on his own.|$|E

5|$|In Asgard, Loki betrays {{and kills}} Laufey, {{revealing}} his true {{plan to use}} Laufey's attempt on Odin's life {{as an excuse to}} destroy Jotunheim with the Bifröst Bridge, thus proving himself worthy to his adoptive father. Thor arrives and fights Loki before destroying the Bifröst Bridge to stop Loki's plan, stranding himself in Asgard. Odin awakens and prevents the brothers from <b>falling</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> abyss created {{in the wake of the}} bridge's destruction, but Loki allows himself to fall when Odin rejects his pleas for approval. Thor makes amends with Odin, admitting he is not ready to be king; while on Earth, Jane and her team search for a way to open a portal to Asgard.|$|E
5|$|In this ending, Loco {{draws his}} gun without {{waiting to be}} {{prompted}} by Silence. Suddenly, Burnett, having survived <b>falling</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> frozen lake, rides into town on horseback and shoots Loco in the head, allowing Silence to kill the remaining bounty killers. Burnett frees the outlaws as Pauline takes the bandages on Silence's burnt right hand off, revealing a gauntlet that he used for protection, before applying bandages to his wounded left hand. As Burnett takes the thieves to the local jail to await their amnesty, he asks Silence to become his deputy, which he accepts with a smile.|$|E
5|$|Launched in January 2001 after a {{short delay}} due to a problem with Mir, on 27 January Progress M1-5 became the last {{spacecraft}} to dock with the station. It spent two months attached to the Kvant-1 module before deorbiting the station on 23 March 2001. Mir re-entered the atmosphere with Progress M1-5 still docked, disintegrating over the Pacific Ocean, with debris <b>falling</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> ocean at around 06:00 GMT. During {{the early stages of}} the unmanned Progress M1-5 mission, a manned Soyuz was placed on standby to launch in order to complete the mission if a problem occurred. The decision to deorbit Mir attracted both praise and criticism for Rosaviakosmos, while several campaigns to save the station were conducted.|$|E

It smashes on the deck, with the diamond <b>falling</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> sea. Tintin, Alonso and Ramón struggle, and fall overboard.
