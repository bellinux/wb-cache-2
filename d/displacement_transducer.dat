40|$|The small strain {{stiffness}} of soils {{has a significant}} role in geotechnical design and analysis. In laboratory, the small strain behavior is examined by different techniques including the bender element method for measuring the maximum shear modulus and local <b>displacement</b> <b>transducer</b> (LDT) for measuring Young's modulus at small strains. However, most commonly used LDTs are based on electrical components and have limitations, such as electromagnetic interference and possibility of short circuit in the presence of water. To overcome these limitations, in the present study, a conventional triaxial apparatus has been modified to measure and study the stress-strain behavior of soils at small strains. The major modifications include addition of piezoceramic sensors (bender elements) for measuring the maximum shear modulus and fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensor-based local displacement transducers (FBG-LDTs) for measuring the stress-strain behavior at small strains. The modified triaxial apparatus has been used to conduct several tests on a completely decomposed granite soil from a site in Hong Kong. The stress-strain behaviors measured by the newly developed FBG-LDTs and an external <b>displacement</b> <b>transducer</b> are compared and discussed. In particular, the shear modulus values obtained using the bender elements, FBG-LTDs, and the external <b>displacement</b> <b>transducer</b> are also compared, discussed, and evaluated.

40|$|Highly {{redundant}} or statically undetermined structures, {{such as a}} cable-stayed bridge, {{have been}} of particular concern to the engineering community nowadays because of the complex parameters that {{must be taken into}} account for healthy monitoring. The purpose of this study was to verify the reliability and practicability of using GPS to characterize dynamic oscillations of small span bridges. The test was carried out on a cable-stayed wood footbridge at Escola de Engenharia de Sao Carlos-Universidade de Sao Paulo, Brazil. Initially a static load trial was carried out to get an idea of the deck amplitude and oscillation frequency. After that, a calibration trial was carried out by applying a well known oscillation on the rover antenna to check the environment detectable limits for the method used. Finally, a dynamic load trial was carried out by using GPS and a <b>displacement</b> <b>transducer</b> to measure the deck oscillation. The <b>displacement</b> <b>transducer</b> was used just to confirm the results obtained by the GPS.

30|$|Deformation measurement, {{especially}} three-dimensional (3 D) deformation measurement, {{is essential}} to the quantitative description of object change and the accurate determination of mechanical properties. Traditionally, deformation measurement is carried out by the use of <b>displacement</b> <b>transducers,</b> such as strain gauges [1]. However, <b>displacement</b> <b>transducers</b> suffer from the disadvantage of being a spot measurement technique, which leads to low spatial resolution and insufficient information for full-field deformation measurement. Optical techniques such as digital speckle pattern interferometry (DSPI) [2, 3], digital image correlation [4], and Moiré method [5] have become preponderant methods in the measurement of deformation for objects with rough surfaces due to their full-field, stand-off, and non-contact measurement nature. Moreover, optical methods, particularly DSPI, are also very precise tools. DSPI is mainly divided, based on their optical setups and interferometric phase extraction methods, into two categories: phase-shifting DSPI (PS-DSPI) and spatial-carrier DSPI (SC-DSPI). The SC-DSPI is also known as digital holographic interferometry [6, 7].|$|R

40|$|The {{examination}} of time effects on soft PZT ceramics {{caused by an}} electric field (up to 2, 0 kV/mm) {{is one of the}} topics at the institute for material research (IMF) of the Karlsruhe Research Center. This work describes several experiments dealing with this field. During the experiments done with different electric load histories in which several hold times were being embed, strain and polarisation hystereses have been measured. An important point of this work is the realisation of the experimental set-up for running these experiments. Problems like arcing especially appeared during the experiments with strain gauges. The presentation of the technical solutions for the problems is a main part of this work. A special point of discussion within this work is the behaviour of the strain and the polarisation during the holding time. Therefore, besides the experimental strain and polarisation hystereses you can also find curves which show the course of the strain and polarisation over the time during the hold times. During the experiments relating to experimental strain and polarisation hystereses the strain was take by an inductive <b>displacement</b> <b>transducer.</b> Another point of discussion of this work is a confrontation of different methods for measuring the strain. Besides the method with an inductive <b>displacement</b> <b>transducer</b> there exists the method of strain gauges. For the reason of comparison the strain was taken with both inductive <b>displacement</b> <b>transducer</b> and one strain gauge. It seems that the readings of strain gauges might be affected by the presence of high electric fields. (orig.) 13 refs.
