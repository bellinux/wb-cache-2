40|$|Modern, Western post-industrial {{societies}} and our complex technological systems {{are subject to}} risks unparalleled {{in the history of}} mankind. These risks expose vulnerabilities in our technologies, our {{societies and}} our personal selves, as we become immersed in technologies without which our cultures cannot function. The proliferation of information and communication technologies (ICTs) into all aspects of life poses unique risks <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us.</b> <b>At</b> the heart of ICTs lies the software which gives the computer its purpose. The aim of this thesis is to investigate how social and organizational factors influence the vulnerability of software systems and their users. The site where software is produced is studied through interviews among software developers. An interdisciplinary approach is employed; using theories of risk and vulnerability of complex technological systems, as well as theories from organizational sociology and software engineering. Scott A. Snook’s theory of practical drift is used as the basis for further analysis. Four areas are identified where social factors compel software developers to drift away from a global set of rules constituting software development processes and methods. Issues of pleasure and control, difference in mental models, undue production pressures, and fragmentation of responsibility all contribute to an uncoupling from established practices designed to guarantee the reliability of software. The implications of these factors in terms of vulnerabilities of software systems, its users, and ultimately of our societies are discussed. Directions for future research are identified, and a hope for the future is expressed, where software will be produced that instead of avoiding risks, tries to anticipate them.

40|$|In today's society {{it is not}} {{uncommon}} <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>at</b> some point to suffer from stress. There may be situations where {{we have a lot to}} do at work, in family relationships, death, illness, relationships with our friends, the pace of our surroundings, external and internal demands that we often carry with us. The children are also affected to a greater extent of stress and distress of it. The purpose of this essay was to study the awareness of teachers and recreation instructors have about the causes of stress in children. A further aim was to study the preventive work looks to counter negative stress. A qualitative study with six interviewees was used to study this subject. Which awareness has teachers and recreation instructors at three elementary schools in central Sweden on the causes of stress in children '. What is the reason that children are stressed in school? How prevent teachers and leisure educators ́ negative stress? The results showed that there was a relatively high level of awareness amongst four of the interviewees and a little less awareness of the causes among two of the interviewees. There were ideas on how to work to prevent negative stress and what actions they wanted to put in to prevent negative stress. The biggest action is to create smaller groups and thus create less stress factors for children. The conclusion is that the interviewee mention similar causes of children's stress that the research mentions. One reason could be that the children have many activities in their free time while also having to deal with school and the requirements that both bring. One solution to this problem might be to create smaller groups of children in school. Where there are opportunities for kids to be both heard and seen, which can give the effect that the children are less stressed at school and able to handle the day overall. The conclusion also shows that awareness of the causes of stress in children is still relatively high among most of the interviewees. Four of the six interviewees exhibit awareness of the causes and come up with ideas for solutions to the prevention work that causes negative stress.  I dagens samhälle är det inte ovanligt att vi alla någon gång drabbas av stress. Det kan vara i situationer där vi har mycket att göra på jobbet, i familjerelationer, dödsfall, sjukdom, i relationer med våra vänner, tempot i vår omgivning, yttre och inre krav som vi ofta bär med oss. Barnen drabbas även de i större utsträckning av stress och far illa av det. Syftet är med denna undersökning var att studera vilken medvetenhet lärare och fritidspedagoger har om orsakerna till stress hos barn. Vidare var syftet att undersöka hur det förebyggande arbetet ser ut för att motverka negativ stress. En kvalitativ intervjustudie med sex intervjupersoner användes för att besvara dessa frågeställningar, vilken medvetenhet har lärare och fritidspedagoger på tre grundskolor i Mellansverige om orsakerna till stress hos barn?. Vad är anledningen till att barn blir stressade i skolan? Hur förebygger lärare och fritidspedagoger negativ stress? Resultatet visade att det var en relativt hög medvetenhet bland fyra av de intervjuade och lite sämre medvetenhet om orsakerna bland två av de intervjuade. Det fanns idéer på hur arbete för att förebygga negativ stress skulle gå till och vilka åtgärder de ville sätta in för att förebygga negativ stress. Främst handlande det om att skapa mindre barngrupper och därmed skapa mindre stressfaktorer för barnen. I diskussionen jämfördes litteratur och resultatet av intervjuerna. Slutsatsen blev de att de intervjuade nämner liknande orsaker till barns stress som den forskningen nämner. En orsak kunde vara att barnen har många aktiviteter på fritiden samtidigt som de måste hantera skolan och de krav som båda för med sig. En lösning på detta problem kan vara att skapa mindre barngrupper i skolan. Där det ges möjligheter för barnen att både höras och synas, vilket kan ge effekten att barnen blir mindre stressade i skolan och klarar av att hantera dagen som helhet. Slutsatsen visar även att medvetenheten om orsakerna till stress hos barn ändå är relativt hög bland de flesta av de intervjuade. Fyra av sex intervjuade uppvisar medvetenhet om orsakerna och kommer med idéer på lösningar till det förebyggandet arbetet som orsakar negativ stress. ...|$|E

40|$|First, food! When your {{horizon is}} the next harvest, and your choice of food for eating or selling is between too little and not enough, the {{long-term}} and the long words take second place. We look at the simmering clash between those who plea for production, and those who chant protection. 'The first human right {{of the day is}} breakfast!' is a lament often heard in dialogues between people submitting funding requests, their sights fixed on the possible, and donor agencies, focused on the desirable. Such exchanges take place at every level, from village to national and regional institutions. Most readers of Spore will have witnessed, perhaps participated in, or even run, several in the last year. The geographer Georges Rossi is convinced that the debate will continue for a good while yet, and have to be tolerated even if no party feels at all comfortable with them. 'In poor countries, the basic needs of tomorrow and the wish {{to improve the quality of}} life will make sure that the Western vision of ecology will be noticeable for a long while yet with its policies seemingly driven from afar by aesthetics, the whims of the well-off. These policies are suffered patiently as politically correct external constraints, the prerequisites which governments pretend to accept as a way to loans and to meet a conditionality of aid. Farmers and local authorities implement them under pressure and then do their best to get round them or drop them as quickly as possible. ' In one sense, it is a practice that, despite its ambiguities, works reasonably well for all concerned. There are signs though that there is less and less room for niceties in the negotiations between the haves and the have-nots affecting ACP agriculture and rural development and several other sectors. The issue is about who shapes the relevant global policies, and with what. Hey, look, I m all global! While most people have been emphasising the local in development, we have also moved much further along the road of global governance than most people realise. Even if our physical horizons have remained largely unchanged, we have each become plugged into a global culture and a global economy. Like clouds and winds, goods can move across the face of the earth in days, information and opinions in seconds. Such proximity is new and while it can be very enriching it makes us all more vulnerable. We can all be more aware of what is happening in parts of the world within and beyond our horizon, and how these events interact. For those who have a global view, and are linked into world networks, you can get a good picture of market trends in other continents, or an early warning of storms or plagues of locusts, and make plans accordingly. You can look further and observe, for example, soil degradation and erosion, deforestation and man-induced climate change and its impact on food production. Many observers feel that the totality of world agriculture has overstepped the limits of the acceptable. According to the Earth Council, a body of observers based in Costa Rica, we are, using the law of averages, depleting more biological resources than we are replenishing and are using more space than we have. Agriculture in The Netherlands, for example, uses seven times more land outside its borders than inside, principally in Latin America, Africa and Asia, to grow its flowers, tomatoes and animal feedstuffs. There are much such ecological footprints. Thou shalt neither pollute nor grow There are many more direct constraints to ACP agriculture than just footprints. Trawl through the world s conventions on biodiversity and climate change, or the Agenda 21 Plan of Action, and you will be able to compose your own list of Do Nots. All these treaties, launched in 1992, are due for revision at the World (Earth) Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg in September 2002. Their environmental considerations now determine agriculture in ACP countries and elsewhere mainly in a restrictive way. It is almost as if there is a timetable of measures which, however well-intentioned, will hit agricultural productivity and incomes. There are already restrictions on the use of fertilisers, herbicides and pesticides, even though often a farmer has no alternative to generate a secure income. Within the next five years, the cost of these inputs, plus that of fuel for local transport and export freight, will rise as eco-taxes are levied on energy in many countries. Over a similar period, the requirements of such standards as ISO 14000 (ISO = International Standardization Organization) for environmental quality will make it harder to enter export markets in the West. These measures in effect raise new barriers in the place of the tariff barriers dismantled by the World Trade Organisation; they are often seen as protection by any other name. Further downstream, there is talk of restricting access to world markets for certain exotic products, such as many tropical fruits, because of the excessive use of energy in their long-distance marketing. There are other pressures on the operating space of the ACP farmer. The guideline launched by the World Commission on Environment and Development in 1987 for each country to preserve 12 % of its ecological capacity (read: land and water area) for biodiversity protection causes a real dilemma: 12 % for the other 30 million species on the planet, and 88 % <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>at</b> an average of 1. 65 hectares of biologically productive area per person! Rossi questions the approach: 'To withhold from rural communities the right to manage all or part of their space just to set up parks and reserves, is that really the best way to assure the unbroken evolution of these ecosystems, and those who live in them?' Remember the day before tomorrow Of course, many steps are being taken to help agriculture become greener, especially in being less of the third culprit after industry and transport as a major source of methane, one of the greenhouse gases causing global warming. The widespread research into changing rice cultivation in paddies and into low-cost production of modified livestock feed to reduce gas emissions by animals, are examples of greening. The trouble is that those who prescribe tomorrow s solutions are not necessarily those who can solve today s problems. With the formulation of agricultural policy being de facto defined by such global events as the Earth Summit, these are the people who are most active in the global culture and who have most access to global information networks. They do not necessarily have the wisdom that comes from the field, a wisdom fashioned not only by success but also by the failure of a harvest or the loss of a market. They sometimes have too much information, and too few tools to make sound judgements. Why, otherwise, would so much debate be dominated by the false position of 'Organic Yes, GMO No'? Hard questions Perhaps it is time for the agricultural community to ask some hard questions, and make public the hard answers, about what is being prescribed and which is, in effect, hindering today s production. Are organic methods of production automatically more benign and sounder than inorganic? Can organic farming feed the world, in terms of accessible proteins? Under what conditions? Can small-scale, labour-intensive production meet food security needs adequately? Are we approaching a division into two systems: food production at its most efficient, and agriculture as a modest rural livelihood? These questions need to be raised as the international community enters the next round of environmental agenda-setting. If they could be raised by representatives of farmers, of all hues and hoes, and others on the food chain, then all the better. No-one would claim that the world s agriculture should be practised on individual plots of 1. 65 hectares that is only an average. Averages do have their uses though. One average approach, which takes all points into account, would be a fairer debate about the future which includes policies that give ACP agriculture more breathing space in which to meet the needs of today. From there we can reach tomorrow. [caption to illustration] Above us only sky? Some greenhouse gases come from rice paddy fields.
