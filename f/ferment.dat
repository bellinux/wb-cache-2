The objectives of our study are to clarify the clinical and laboratory features and to characterize the allergens in allergy due to <b>fermented</b> soybeans. MethodsSeven patients with suspected hypersensitivity to <b>fermented</b> soybeans, from whom informed consent had been obtained, underwent skin prick-prick tests with <b>fermented</b> soybeans and challenge test with <b>fermented</b> soybeans. Additionally, specific IgE against <b>fermented</b> soybeans and the allergens of <b>fermented</b> soybeans were detected by ELISA and IgE-immunoblotting, respectively. ResultsSeven male patients, aged 26 to 42 years (mean age, 33. 1 years), participated. All patients reported generalized urticaria and dyspnea; 5, loss of consciousness; 2, collapse; 2, vomiting; and 2, diarrhea after <b>fermented</b> soybean ingestion. The interval between <b>fermented</b> soybean ingestion and onset of symptoms was 5 to 14 hours (mean, 9. 6 hours). All patients were positive on skin prick-prick tests with <b>fermented</b> soybeans. In 2 patients, oral challenge with <b>fermented</b> soybeans was positive 5. 5 and 13 hours after ingestion. In ELISA, all 5 patients tested showed elevated IgE levels to the <b>fermented</b> soybean extract.

40|$|The {{influence}} of the ratio of <b>fermented</b> rice straw, rice bran and cassava solid waste upon the In vitro digestibility and rumen fermentation product ABSTRACT. Chemical and physical treatments have been attempted to improve the utilization of agro industrial wastes, but the result is not efficient and caused pollution. Besides, biological treatments using the microbes {{have been used to}} improve the nutritive value and utilization of agro industrial wastes. The current experiment was conducted to find out the optimal ratio of <b>fermented</b> rice straw, <b>fermented</b> rice bran and <b>fermented</b> tapioca waste. There were five kinds of ratio of <b>fermented</b> rice straw, <b>fermented</b> rice bran and <b>fermented</b> tapioca waste, namely: K 1 (70 % <b>fermented</b> rice straw + 15 % <b>fermented</b> rice bran + <b>fermented</b> tapioca waste), K 2 (60 % <b>fermented</b> rice straw + 20 % <b>fermented</b> rice bran + 20 % <b>fermented</b> tapioca waste), K 3 (50 % <b>fermented</b> rice straw + 25 % <b>fermented</b> rice bran + 25 % <b>fermented</b> tapioca waste), K 4 (40 % <b>fermented</b> rice straw + 30 % <b>fermented</b> rice bran + 30 % <b>fermented</b> tapioca waste) and K 5 (30 % <b>fermented</b> rice straw + 35 % <b>fermented</b> rice bran + 35 % <b>fermented</b> tapioca waste) An in vitro technique, using completely Randomize Block Design was applied and each treatment was repeated four times. Variables measured were Dry matter and Organic matter digestibility and rumen fermentation products (volatile fatty acid and N-NH 3 concentration). The dry matter digestibility of K 1, K 2, K 3, k 4 and K 5 was 29. 39, 31. 27, 32. 33, 33. 71 and 34. 82 %, respectively. The organic matter digestibility of K 1, K 2, K 3, K 4 and 5 was 30. 82, 31. 27, 32. 73, 34. 94, and 34. 92, respectively. Volatile fatty acid concentrations of K 1, K 2, K 3, K 4 and K 5 were 95. 19, 91. 77, 87. 21, 104. 31, 106. 59 mM/l, respectively. N-NH 3 concentrations of K 1, K 2, K 3, K 4 and K 5 were 0. 97, 0. 93, 0. 93, 1. 00, 1. 04 mM/l, respectively.

5|$|The beak of the kakapo {{is adapted}} for {{grinding}} food finely. For this reason, the kakapo {{has a very}} small gizzard compared to other birds of their size.

It is particularly fond of {{the fruit of the}} rimu tree, and will feed on it exclusively during seasons when it is abundant. The kakapo has a distinctive habit of grabbing a leaf or frond with a foot and stripping the nutritious parts of the plant out with its beak, leaving a ball of indigestible fibre. These little clumps of plant fibres are a distinctive sign of the presence of the bird. The kakapo is believed to employ bacteria in the fore-gut to <b>ferment</b> and help digest plant matter.|$|E
5|$|Plants {{provide the}} greater part of the food for people and their {{domestic}} animals: much of human culture and civilisation came into being through agriculture. While a large number of plants have been used for food, a small number of staple crops including wheat, rice, and maize provide most of the food in the world today. In turn, animals provide much of the meat eaten by the human population, whether farmed or hunted, and until the arrival of mechanised transport, terrestrial mammals provided {{a large part of the}} power used for work and transport. A variety of living things serve as models in biological research, such as in genetics, and in drug testing. Until the 19th century, plants yielded most of the medicinal drugs in common use, as described in the 1st century by Dioscorides. Plants are the source of many psychoactive drugs, some such as coca known to have been used for thousands of years.

5|$|To {{maintain}} a high constant body temperature is energy expensive – mammals therefore need a nutritious and plentiful diet. While the earliest mammals were probably predators, different species have since adapted {{to meet their}} dietary requirements {{in a variety of}} ways. Some eat other animals – this is a carnivorous diet (and includes insectivorous diets). Other mammals, called herbivores, eat plants, which contain complex carbohydrates such as cellulose. An herbivorous diet includes subtypes such as granivory (seed eating), folivory (leaf eating), frugivory (fruit eating), nectarivory (nectar eating), gummivory (gum eating) and mycophagy (fungus eating). The digestive tract of an herbivore is host to bacteria that <b>ferment</b> these complex substances, and make them available for digestion, which are either housed in the multichambered stomach or in a large cecum. Some mammals are coprophagous, consuming feces to absorb the nutrients not digested when the food was first ingested. An omnivore eats both prey and plants. Carnivorous mammals have a simple digestive tract because the proteins, lipids and minerals found in meat require {{little in the way of}} specialized digestion. Exceptions to this include baleen whales who also house gut flora in a multi-chambered stomach, like terrestrial herbivores.|$|E
5|$|Yeasts {{have been}} used since ancient times to leaven bread and to <b>ferment</b> beer and wine. More recently, mould fungi have been {{exploited}} to create {{a wide range of}} industrial products, including enzymes and drugs. Medicines based on fungi include antibiotics, immunosuppressants, statins and many anti-cancer drugs. The yeast species Saccharomyces cerevisiae is an important model organism in cell biology. The fruiting bodies of some larger fungi are collected as edible mushrooms, including delicacies like the chanterelle, cep, and truffle, while a few species are cultivated. Mould fungi provide the meaty (umami) flavour of fermented soybean products such as tempeh, miso and soy sauce, and contribute flavour and colour to blue cheeses including Roquefort and Stilton. Moulds also yield vegetarian meat substitutes like Quorn. Some fungi, especially the fly agaric and psilocybin mushrooms are used for the psychoactive drugs that they contain; these in particular are the focus of academic study in the field of ethnomycology.|$|E
5|$|In his 2006 re-evaluation, Carpenter {{examined}} the paleobiology of giant sauropods, including Amphicoelias, and addresses {{the question of}} why this group attained such a huge size. He pointed out that gigantic sizes were reached early in sauropod evolution, with very large sized species present as early as the late Triassic Period, and concluded that whatever evolutionary pressure caused large size was present from the early origins of the group. Carpenter cited several studies of giant mammalian herbivores, such as elephants and rhinoceros, which showed that larger size in plant-eating animals leads to greater efficiency in digesting food. Since larger animals have longer digestive systems, food is kept in digestion for significantly longer periods of time, allowing large animals to survive on lower-quality food sources. This is especially true of animals with a large number of 'fermentation chambers' along the intestine which allow microbes to accumulate and <b>ferment</b> plant material, aiding digestion. Throughout their evolutionary history, sauropod dinosaurs were found primarily in semi-arid, seasonally dry environments, with a corresponding seasonal drop in the quality of food during the dry season. The environment of Amphicoelias was essentially a savanna, similar to the arid environments in which modern giant herbivores are found, supporting the idea that poor-quality food in an arid environment promotes the evolution of giant herbivores. Carpenter argued that other benefits of large size, such as relative immunity from predators, lower energy expenditure, and longer life span, are probably secondary advantages.|$|E
