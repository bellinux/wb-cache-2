40|$|Abstract: In today's highly {{competitive}} global economy, the <b>farm</b> <b>enterprises</b> are confronted, as any manufacturing enterprises, with permanent {{changes in their}} environment. Responsiveness and flexibility are required to support <b>farm</b> <b>enterprise</b> performance and adaptation to their new contexts of production. Enterprise Modeling is a powerful tool supporting the design process of adaptive enterprise system in the manufacturing sector. It allows semi-formal models to be defined to provide a common understanding and communication on various enterprise aspects. This paper explores {{the use of such}} enterprise models to characterise and manage flexibility in <b>farm</b> <b>enterprise</b> through the example of the relationships between a <b>farm</b> <b>enterprise</b> and its business environment...|$|R

In South Africa {{emerging}} <b>farm</b> <b>enterprises</b> are {{a primary}} focus of government interventions with the view of improving and increasing productivity and profitability of the land redistribution beneficiaries. However, the state of productivity and profitability of the emerging <b>farm</b> <b>enterprises</b> is not well documented. The problem faced by emerging <b>farm</b> <b>enterprises</b> in South Africa {{is that they are}} not graduating from emerging to commercial <b>farming</b> <b>enterprises</b> as was expected from 1994. Smallholder farmers find it difficult to participate in the markets because of a range of constraints and barriers reducing incentives to participation. There are several factors contributing to this, but lack of information on productivity and profitability seem to champion the dilemma. Not much is known about the productivity and profitability of emerging <b>farming</b> <b>enterprises.</b> The aim {{of this study was to}} contribute to the body of knowledge, in pursuance of measures of productivity and profitability for improving the emerging farmers' situation...|$|R

40|$|Maatiloilla, joilla on monialaista yritystoimintaa, on voitu lisätä käytettävissä olevaa tuloa ja parantaa nettotulosta. Tulokset vuodelta 1996 perustuvat 40 sellaisen maatilan kirjanpitoon, joilla on maatalouden ohella myös yhtä tai useampaa muuta yritystoimintaa. Nämä tilat ovat maatiloina yleensä pienehköjä. Pääasialliset muut toimialat olivat koneurakointi, elintarvikkeiden jatkojalostus, puun jatkojalostus ja maatilamatkailu. Nettotuloksella mitattuna parhaiten näytti kannattavan puun jatkojalostus. Monialaisten maatilayritysten talousseuranta on toistaiseksi ollut kovin vähäistä. Maaseudun kehittämisen näkökulmasta seurannan laajentaminen ja eri toimialojen kattavuuden lisääminen on erittäin tarpeellista. This {{article is}} {{concerned}} with pluriactive <b>farm</b> <b>enterprises,</b> i. e. <b>farms</b> practising other entrepreneurial activities besides traditional agricultural production, and the benefits obtained from such pluriactivities. The objective {{is to find out}} whether pluriactivity has improved the profitability of the <b>farm</b> <b>enterprise.</b> The study is based on data from the profitability bookkeeping of <b>farm</b> <b>enterprises,</b> and the reference data concerning agriculture consists of results from the FADN farms. The profitability bookkeeping of pluriactive <b>farm</b> <b>enterprises</b> was started in 1996, and in the first year 40 farms participated in the bookkeeping. The article concerning the economy of pluriactive <b>farm</b> <b>enterprises</b> deals with machine contracting, wood processing, farm holidays and processing of agricultural products as separate branches of industry, and the profitability of these has been compared with that of traditional <b>farm</b> <b>enterprises.</b> According to the results of 1996, the profitability of pluriactive <b>farm</b> <b>enterprises</b> was weaker than that of traditional farms. However, {{on the basis of the}} financial statements of one single year no direct conclusions concerning the unprofitability of pluriactivity can be made. The area of the pluriactive farms participating in the bookkeeping was smaller than on the traditional farms, and thus the income from agriculture only would also very likely have been smaller than in the reference group. vokMTT Taloustutkimus (MTTL...|$|R

40|$|Current {{consumers}} are demanding food that is produced more sustainably, safely and transparently. To meet these demands <b>farm</b> <b>enterprises</b> {{need to improve}} production. To support this, a variety of high-tech tools are available. Despite this availability, farmers face difficulties in adopting and integrating them effectively. This paper presents a method to identify bottlenecks that hinder arable <b>farm</b> <b>enterprise</b> integration, in which a reference model serves {{as a base for}} models describing arable <b>farm</b> <b>enterprise</b> architectures. This reference model, described in a standard modeling language, shows the interrelations between the business, application and technology layers of <b>farm</b> <b>enterprises.</b> It was validated by two experts with expertise in the creation of reference models of arable farms. This reference model was used to create enterprise architectural descriptions of three arable farms in the Netherlands, showing a series of bottlenecks. The bottlenecks that we found are: nonexistence of services and interfaces to support farm processes, (partly) overlapping applications, inability of applications to share a data repository, skills required of farmers to exchange data and unavailability of business services to configure tools of different vendors. These bottlenecks, applicable for potato production in the Netherlands, were validated with national and international experts who have expertise in arable farming. Based on this validation, we conclude that these bottlenecks are valid for other cultivations and in other countries. This papers shows that our approach, i. e. describing the arable <b>farm</b> <b>enterprise</b> architecture, is also a valuable method to gain insight in different aspects of arable <b>farm</b> <b>enterprise</b> integration and {{can be used to make}} the first steps towards prioritizing and removing bottlenecks...|$|R
