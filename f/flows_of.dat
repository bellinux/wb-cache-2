5|$|Edziza's shield volcanoes {{are built}} {{almost entirely of}} fluid lava flows. They formed {{as a result of}} lava flowing out in all {{directions}} from central summit vents and from groups of vents, building a broad, gently sloping cone of flat, domical shape. They are built up slowly by the accretion of thousands of lava <b>flows</b> <b>of</b> highly fluid basaltic lava, which spread widely over great distances, and then cool as thin, gently dipping sheets. In some shield volcano eruptions, basaltic lava has poured out quietly from fissure vents instead of central vents, flooding the surrounding countryside with lava flow upon lava flow, forming Edziza's broad lava plateau.|$|E
5|$|Level Mountain basalt and {{andesite}} flows {{were presented}} in the 1926 Canada Department of Mines Summary Report, 1925, Part A. The andesites were described as porphyritic rocks with phenocrysts of feldspar of various size in a greyish or greenish matrix. Both hornblende and augite andesites were noted to have been represented under a microscope. The basalts were described as black rocks with basic plagioclase with or without olivine and were noted in many cases to contain a considerable percentage of brownish glass. Although there was not sufficient time available to study these flows in detail it was revealed at several points that the andesites formed the older and the basalts the younger flows. G. M. Dawson of the Geological Survey of Canada (GSC) was able to demonstrate that on the Stikine River {{there were at least}} four <b>flows</b> <b>of</b> basalt. The basalts and andesites were considered to be younger than all the rocks they were observed in contact with, namely granitic intrusives, porphyries and greenstones. More definite evidence as to their age was obtained by W. A. Johnston and F. A. Kerr of the GSC who placed them in the Tertiary {{with some of the most}} recent <b>flows</b> <b>of</b> the Stikine valley probably belonging to the Pleistocene.|$|E
5|$|One {{important}} {{characteristic of}} the planets is their intrinsic magnetic moments, which in turn give rise to magnetospheres. The presence of a magnetic field indicates that the planet is still geologically alive. In other words, magnetized planets have <b>flows</b> <b>of</b> electrically conducting material in their interiors, which generate their magnetic fields. These fields significantly change {{the interaction of the}} planet and solar wind. A magnetized planet creates a cavity in the solar wind around itself called the magnetosphere, which the wind cannot penetrate. The magnetosphere can be much larger than the planet itself. In contrast, non-magnetized planets have only small magnetospheres induced by interaction of the ionosphere with the solar wind, which cannot effectively protect the planet.|$|E

5|$|Since then, thermal {{anomalies}} (hot spots) and {{gas emissions}} (including hydrogen sulfide) have occurred {{especially on the}} summit plateau and indicate that Adams is dormant, not extinct. Future eruptions from Adams will probably follow patterns set by previous events and will thus be flank lava <b>flows</b> <b>of</b> andesite or basalt. Because the primary products were andesite, the eruptions that occur on Adams {{tend to have a}} low to moderate explosiveness and present less of a hazard than the violent eruptions of St. Helens {{and some of the other}} Cascade volcanoes. However, since the interior of the main cone is little more than a pile of fragmented lava and hydrothermally-altered rock, there is a potential for very large landslides and other debris flows.|$|E
5|$|Since {{urbanization}} {{began in}} the 1960s, sudden high and sediment-lacking <b>flows</b> <b>of</b> polluted water began to destroy the native riparian vegetation once found along much of the creek. Exotic plants, including tobacco tree, castor bean, pampas grass, periwinkle, and Artichoke thistle, but most notably the giant reed, then replaced the historic live oaks, sycamores and alders as riparian vegetation. These plants have crowded out native vegetation, {{and in the case}} of giant reed, crowded out native animals—giant reed does not provide habitat for any native Southern California animals. These invasive species are most prevalent along upper Sulphur Creek (Sulphur Creek Reservoir prevents these plants from spreading downstream), much of the Aliso Creek mainstem, and some parts of Wood Canyon Creek.|$|E

5|$|The {{proportion}} of skilled workers in Jordan {{is among the}} highest in the region in sectors such as ICT and industry, due to a relatively modern educational system.

5|$|Anisotropy {{of liquid}} {{crystals}} is a property not observed in other fluids. This anisotropy makes <b>flows</b> <b>of</b> liquid crystals behave more differentially {{than those of}} ordinary fluids. For example, injection of a flux of a liquid crystal between two close parallel plates (viscous fingering) causes orientation of the molecules to couple with the flow, with the resulting emergence of dendritic patterns. This anisotropy is also manifested in the interfacial energy (surface tension) between different liquid crystal phases. This anisotropy determines the equilibrium shape at the coexistence temperature, and {{is so strong that}} usually facets appear. When temperature is changed one of the phases grows, forming different morphologies depending on the temperature change. Since growth is controlled by heat diffusion, anisotropy in thermal conductivity favors growth in specific directions, which has also an effect on the final shape.|$|E
5|$|Argentina, {{like many}} other countries, entered into a {{recession}} following the beginning of World War I as international <b>flows</b> <b>of</b> goods, capital and labour declined.

And after the opening of the Panama canal in 1914, Argentina and the other Southern cone economies declined, as investors turned their attention to Asia and the Caribbean. The United States, which came out of the war a political and financial superpower, especially perceived Argentina (and to a lesser extent Brazil) as a potential rival on world markets. Neither the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange nor the private domestic banks developed rapidly enough to fully replace British capital.|$|E

5|$|The global {{financial}} {{system is the}} worldwide framework of legal agreements, institutions, and both formal and informal economic actors that together facilitate international <b>flows</b> <b>of</b> financial capital for purposes of investment and trade financing. Since emerging in the late 19th century during the first modern wave of economic globalization, its evolution is marked by the establishment of central banks, multilateral treaties, and intergovernmental organizations aimed at improving the transparency, regulation, and effectiveness of international markets. In the late 1800s, world migration and communication technology facilitated unprecedented growth in international trade and investment. At the onset of World War I, trade contracted as foreign exchange markets became paralyzed by money market illiquidity. Countries sought to defend against external shocks with protectionist policies and trade virtually halted by 1933, worsening {{the effects of the}} global Great Depression until a series of reciprocal trade agreements slowly reduced tariffs worldwide. Efforts to revamp the international monetary system after World War II improved exchange rate stability, fostering record growth in global finance.|$|E
5|$|These fossils {{have been}} {{preserved}} in a distinctive style known as Burgess shale type preservation, which preserves fairly tough tissues such as cuticle as thin films, and soft tissues as solid shapes, quickly enough that decay has not destroyed them. Moderately soft tissues, such as muscles, are lost. Scientists are still unsure about {{the processes that}} created these fossils. While {{there is little doubt}} that the animals were buried under catastrophic <b>flows</b> <b>of</b> sediment, it is uncertain whether they were transported by the flows from other locations, or lived in the area where they were buried, or were a mixture of local and transported specimens. This issue is closely related to whether conditions around the burial sites were anoxic or had a moderate supply of oxygen. Anoxic conditions are generally thought the most favourable for fossilization, but imply that the animals could not have lived where they were buried.|$|E
5|$|Water {{security}} and food security are inextricably linked. In the decade 1951–60 human water withdrawals were four {{times greater than}} the previous decade. This rapid increase resulted from scientific and technological developments impacting through the economy—especially the increase in irrigated land, growth in industrial and power sectors, and intensive dam construction on all continents. This altered the water cycle of rivers and lakes, affected their water quality and {{had a significant impact on}} the global water cycle. Currently towards 35% of human water use is unsustainable, drawing on diminishing aquifers and reducing the <b>flows</b> <b>of</b> major rivers: this percentage is likely to increase if climate change impacts become more severe, populations increase, aquifers become progressively depleted and supplies become polluted and unsanitary. From 1961 to 2001 water demand doubled—agricultural use increased by 75%, industrial use by more than 200%, and domestic use more than 400%. In the 1990s it was estimated that humans were using 40–50% of the globally available freshwater in the approximate proportion of 70% for agriculture, 22% for industry, and 8% for domestic purposes with total use progressively increasing.|$|E
