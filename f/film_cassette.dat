25|$|The {{new season}} depicts the band {{shooting}} their initial theatrical film called the Magical Mystery Girl Movie. Nat stars as Daniel, Rosalina as herself, Miranda Cosgrove as Daniel's girl friend, Alex as Oliver, Juanita {{as the girl}} in Oliver's new music video, with Mr. Wolff and Jesse playing themselves and Principle Schmoke and Tuffy portraying sumo wrestlers in diapers. Christophe is the stubborn director; he is later overthrown and replaced by Cooper, the producer of the movie. Christophe appears again in The Premiere, who pilfers the movie's metal <b>film</b> <b>cassette.</b>|$|E
5000|$|First he {{retrieved}} the <b>film</b> <b>cassette</b> from the Panoramic Camera and returned {{that to the}} cabin. After inspecting the [...] "V-over-H" [...] sensor on the Mapping Camera he retrieved its <b>film</b> <b>cassette.</b> He {{found that there was}} nothing obscuring the sensor as had been postulated by Mission Control as a cause for its problems. Later analysis would find that the problem was related to the optical signal-to-noise ratio.|$|E

These were very useful if a photographer had a motor drive mounted {{and needed to}} take more than seven seconds worth of photographs. Note that the MF-2 and its MZ-2 cassettes are very rare.|$|R
5000|$|While Kodak {{had invented}} the Kodak 135 daylight-loading <b>film</b> <b>cassette</b> in 1934, prior to 1938 they only offered the German made Kodak Retina {{to work with}} this cartridge. US built 35mm cameras used the 828 paper backed 35mm roll-film (Bantam Series).|$|E

50|$|At {{the end of}} the mission, {{the crew}} took the <b>film</b> <b>cassettes</b> and other items they were {{returning}} to Earth and stowed them in the descent module. The retrofire, re-entry, and landing took place without incident on 23 September.|$|R
50|$|The Leica 250 Reporter {{is a body}} {{variant of}} the Leica screw mount rangefinder. It was {{designed}} to take bulk film by rolls of 10 metres, allowing 250 exposures. The film was charged in special <b>film</b> <b>cassettes</b> (code KOOBF).|$|R
50|$|A <b>film</b> <b>cassette</b> {{is similar}} to a film can in that it is a {{light-tight}} enclosure containing a spool of film. However a cassette also has a light trap, usually a set of lips covered with velvet, that allow film through without allowing light into the can. This allows a cassette to be loaded into a camera in daylight, then the camera back closed and light-sealed before use.|$|E
50|$|The Minolta 16 can {{be traced}} back to the Mica Automat built by Konan in 1947. Minolta bought out Konan in the early 1950s and {{continued}} producing cameras under the Konan name for several years. The first camera labeled Minolta 16 rather than Konan 16 was the Minolta 16 Automat of 1955. The Minolta 16 used a newly designed <b>film</b> <b>cassette</b> which was not compatible with the Konan models.|$|E
50|$|DX Encoding (Digital indeX), or DX coding was {{initially}} developed by Kodak in the 1980s, and eventually adapted by all camera and film manufacturers. It {{provides information on}} both the <b>film</b> <b>cassette</b> and on the film regarding the type of film, number of exposures, speed (ISO/ASA rating) of the film. It consists of three types of identification. First is a barcode near the film opening of the cassette, identifying the manufacturer, film type and processing method (see image below left). This is used by photofinishing equipment during film processing. The second part is a barcode {{on the edge of}} the film (see image below right), used also during processing, which indicates the image film type, manufacturer, frame number and synchronizes the position of the frame. The third part of DX coding, known as the DX Camera Auto Sensing (CAS) code, consists of a series of 12 metal contacts on the <b>film</b> <b>cassette,</b> which beginning with cameras manufactured after 1985 could detect the type of film, number of exposures and ISO of the film, and use that information to automatically adjust the camera settings for the speed of the film.|$|E
50|$|Since the 1980s <b>film</b> <b>cassettes</b> {{have been}} {{marked with a}} DX {{encoding}} pattern; conforming cameras detect this and set their light meters according to film speed. Different films are sensitive to light at different degrees; this film speed is standardised by ISO.|$|R
50|$|Apollo 15 {{spent one}} more day in lunar orbit, {{continuing}} Worden's observations. After releasing a subsatellite, they ignited their Service Propulsion system {{to put them on}} a trajectory back to Earth. The next day, Worden performed an EVA to retrieve the <b>film</b> <b>cassettes</b> from the SIM bay cameras.|$|R
50|$|Mission Control {{ran over}} the stowage of {{items in the}} cabin. It was {{extremely}} important that stowed items were placed such that the spacecraft's centre-of-gravity was within the set limits. Especially important were items like the rock samples weighing 170 lb (77 kg) and the 55 lb (25 kg) <b>film</b> <b>cassettes</b> from the Panoramic Camera.|$|R

5000|$|Inside, the <b>film</b> <b>cassette</b> {{engages the}} rewind fork at the top, {{and it is}} {{held in place by}} a hinged {{retaining}} ring at the bottom. The film lead passes under the fixed black film-pressure plate {{on its way to the}} slotted large diameter take-up spool. The spool always rotates the same angular amount to advance the film without a sprocket wheel drive. Acceptable frame spacing is accomplished by the large diameter take-up spool that reduces the effect of increasing spool diameter as more film is wound onto it.|$|E
50|$|Since Kalvar film used no {{chemicals}} for processing, {{the equipment}} needed {{to use it}} was limited only by {{the speed of the}} transport mechanism {{and the power of the}} ultraviolet light. Used as duplication film for photoreconnaissance on carriers during the Vietnam War, processing speeds in excess of 1000 feet per minute were routinely done. A recon plane would make its run over the selected area, and on its way back to the carrier, the silver film used was developed in the aircraft. When it landed on the carrier, the silver <b>film</b> <b>cassette</b> was taken from the plane for duplication and distribution to the various specialists.|$|E
50|$|When still cameras using 35 mm film, {{originally}} {{used for}} cinematography, were introduced they were widely known as miniature cameras to distinguish {{them from the}} then commonplace rollfilm cameras. While the term {{could be used for}} a camera larger than a subminiature and smaller than a rollfilm camera, it was mostly used for cameras taking 135 <b>film</b> <b>cassettes,</b> or other 35 mm cassettes.|$|R

40|$|The {{stereometric camera}} was {{designed}} for close-range techniques in biostereometrics. The camera focusing distance of 360 mm to infinity covers a broad field of close-range photogrammetry. The design provides for a separate unit for the lens system and interchangeable backs on the camera {{for the use of}} single frame film exposure, roll-type <b>film</b> <b>cassettes,</b> or glass plates. The system incorporates the use of a surface contrast optical projector...|$|R
50|$|At long last, Rollei had {{a camera}} that could match the Hasselbad 500C. Indeed, {{had it been}} {{released}} earlier, around 1960 say, {{it could have been}} enormously successful. On top of that, despite declining profit margins and tough competition from the Japanese, Rollei continued to target its advertising at the amateur market. In contrast, other companies such as Leitz and Hasselblad had better understood how to promote their expensive cameras in photographic magazines - not just through paid advertising, but also through feature articles in the editorial pages. As a result, the SL66 never sold in the numbers that the company had hoped for or needed. Nevertheless, Rollei owes its survival as a company to the SL66 camera system, along with its enduring reputation for quality. Its successor, the SL66E, was released in 1984; externally the camera was largely unchanged, but it now had a built-in light meter. Additional lenses were released, such as the Fisheye-Distagon (f/3.5, 30 mm), the Distagon (f/4, 40 mm), and the Sonnar (f/4, 150 mm) with a between-the-lens shutter along with more accessories including close-up lenses, extension bellows, a Polaroid <b>film</b> <b>cassette,</b> a sheet <b>film</b> <b>cassette,</b> an underwater housing, and a ring flash unit. Its successor, the SL66-X, released in 1968 only had TTL flash metering, while the SL66-SE (Special Edition) also included a standard light meter. Prior to this, TTL metering required a special prism viewfinder with a built-in light meter. The release in 1992 of the SE Exclusive Professional incorporating selective gold-plating on the housing marked the end of the SL66 series.|$|E
50|$|Many of his {{observations}} were of far side features {{that had not}} been seen in great detail. The panoramic camera was {{a modified version of the}} U.S. Air Force's KA-80A camera for its spy satellites, using a 610 mm f/3.5 lens. This particular camera was similar to those used by the Lockheed U-2, A-12 Oxcart and SR-71 Blackbird. It could see features as small as 3 ft (1 m) across on the lunar surface. It would take long strips, 205 by 13 mi (330 by 21 km) of the surface, on 3.8 foot by 4.5 inch (114.8 by 11.4 cm) strips of film. Over the course of the mission it would take 1,529 usable images, exposing 2 km of film. The <b>film</b> <b>cassette</b> weighed 55 lb (25 kg).|$|E
50|$|The <b>film</b> <b>cassette</b> {{system was}} {{redesigned}} {{but it was}} only with the Robot IIa launched in 1951 that film could accept a standard 35 mm cassette. The special Robot cassettes type-N continued their role for take up. A small bakelite box was sold to allow people to rewind colour film into the original cassettes as demanded by the film processing companies. The camera was synchronized for flash. The swinging viewfinder was retained but now operated by a lever rather than moving the entire housing. Both the deep purple filter and the yellow filter were eliminated in the redesign. Some versions were available with a double wind motor which could expose 50 frames. The Second World War stopped civilian production of the Robot but it was used as a gun camera by the Luftwaffe.|$|E
5000|$|The course {{comprised}} {{a self-contained}} kit of course materials, <b>film</b> <b>cassettes,</b> visual aids, and games. Some {{of the activities}} were very imaginative; a game based upon reindeer [...] had a loaded die to introduce discussion about instincts, and a paper seal would be cut up and shared among class members representing various people in the Netsilik community, according to a ritual governing who was entitled to which part of the animal.|$|R
500|$|At a {{distance}} of about [...] from Earth, Mattingly performed a [...] "deep-space" [...] extra-vehicular activity, or spacewalk, during which he retrieved several <b>film</b> <b>cassettes</b> from the CSM's SIM bay. While outside the spacecraft, Mattingly set up a biological experiment, the Microbial Ecology Evaluation Device (MEED). The MEED experiment was only performed on Apollo 16. The crew carried out various housekeeping and maintenance tasks aboard the spacecraft and ate a meal before concluding the day.|$|R
40|$|Extendible booms used {{to convey}} <b>film</b> <b>cassettes</b> {{weighing}} 56. 7 kg (125 lb) between the Airlock Module and the Apollo Telescope Mount are described {{along with the}} dispensing mechanism. Problems encountered with the mechanism during the test program are discussed. These problems were mainly associated with operation in cold temperature, lubrication, and the motor/gearhead assembly. Another set of problems which arose during crew training in the MSFC water tank is also discussed...|$|R
50|$|The {{camera back}} is {{removable}} for changing film. A milled button {{next to the}} tripod socket rotates either way to lock the back, while in a position in between it is unlocked. The back comes off downwards as a single unit including the base-plate. A quite small film-pressure plate of thick glass is mounted {{on a piece of}} rubber foam on the back. Inside the camera, on the left-hand side, is the 35mm <b>film</b> <b>cassette</b> chamber, and to the right is the counter clockwise rotating film take-up drum. It has a narrow slit for the film leader, and it rotates freely whenever the small film rewind button on the top plate is depressed. No sprocket wheel is employed; instead, the film is pulled by, and wound onto the drum that always rotates the same angular amount for next picture frame. Acceptable frame spacing is accomplished by the large diameter take-up spool that reduces the effect of increasing spool diameter as more film is wound onto it.|$|E
50|$|Ground parties {{scoured the}} {{countryside}} looking for wreckage; {{critical to the}} investigation was the film from the cockpit camera. The weekend after the accident, an unofficial FRC search party found the camera; disappointingly, the film cartridge was nowhere in sight. Engineers theorized that the <b>film</b> <b>cassette,</b> being lighter than the camera, might be further away, blown north by winds at altitude. FRC engineer Victor Horton organized a search and on 29 November, during the first pass over the area, Willard E. Dives found the cassette. Most puzzling was Adams' complete lack of awareness of major heading deviations in spite of accurately functioning cockpit instrumentation. The accident board concluded that he had allowed the aircraft to deviate {{as the result of}} a combination of distraction, misinterpretation of his instrumentation display, and possible vertigo. The electrical disturbance early in the flight degraded the overall effectiveness of the aircraft's control system and further added to pilot workload. The MH-96 adaptive control system then caused the airplane to break up during reentry.|$|E
50|$|In 1938 Berning {{introduced}} the Robot II, a slightly larger camera with some significant improvements but still using the basic mechanism. Among the standard lenses were a 3 cm Zeiss Tessar and a 3.75 cm Zeiss Tessar in f/2.8 and 3.5 variations, a f/2.0, 40 mm Zeiss Biotar and f/4, 7.5 cm Zeiss Sonnar. The <b>film</b> <b>cassette</b> system was redesigned, and the 1951 IIa accepted a standard 35 mm cassette. The special Robot cassettes type-N {{continued to be}} used for take-up. A small Bakelite box was sold to allow colour film to be rewound into the original cassettes as required by film processing companies. The camera was synchronized for flash. The swinging viewfinder was retained, but now operated by a lever rather than moving the entire housing. Both the deep purple and yellow filters were eliminated in the redesign. Some versions were available with a double-wind motor which could expose 50 frames on one winding. Civilian versions of the Robot were discontinued {{at the outset of the}} Second World War, but it was used as a gun camera by the Luftwaffe.|$|E
50|$|Photographers {{praise the}} {{beautiful}} intermediate gray or color gradation {{that results from}} making prints this way. Each print is necessarily {{the same size as}} the corresponding image on the negative. This makes contact prints from large-format negatives, especially 5×7 inch and larger, most usable for fine-art work. Smaller contact prints, from films and formats such as 135 <b>film</b> <b>cassettes,</b> 35 mm (24×36 mm images), and 120/220 roll film (6 cm), are useful for evaluation of exposure, composition, and subject.|$|R
5000|$|At a {{distance}} of about 170000 nmi km from Earth, Mattingly performed a [...] "deep-space" [...] extra-vehicular activity, or spacewalk, during which he retrieved several <b>film</b> <b>cassettes</b> from the CSM's SIM bay. While outside the spacecraft, Mattingly set up a biological experiment, the Microbial Ecology Evaluation Device (MEED). The MEED experiment was only performed on Apollo 16. The crew carried out various housekeeping and maintenance tasks aboard the spacecraft and ate a meal before concluding the day.|$|R
5000|$|In December 1980, the West German Federal Ministry of Finance {{told the}} Bundestag that between January 1978 and December 1979, [...] "200 {{shipments}} of right-wing content, including books, periodicals, symbols, decorations, <b>films,</b> <b>cassettes,</b> and records" [...] had been intercepted entering West Germany; these shipments [...] "came overwhelmingly from Canada." [...] On April 23, 1981, the West German government {{sent a letter}} to the Canadian Jewish Congress, confirming that the source of the material was Samisdat Publishers.|$|R
