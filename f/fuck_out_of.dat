500|$|Rick Ross drops by to say hi, {{keeping his}} {{appearance}} so brief that I can't {{help but wonder}} what he's even doing here. Justin Vernon inexplicably bookends the thing, pushing his falsetto into Antony range on the outro and muttering befuddling lyrics {{that have nothing to}} do with the rest of the song. All this over the straight-up funkiest beat Kanye West has made in years, a rippling electro push-pull that adds an effortless strut to his recent progged-out chilliness. But all that other stuff fades into the background when Nicki Minaj shows up. [...] She's a whirlwind of energy, showing her full repertoire of nutso voices and kicking the living <b>fuck</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the beat, sounding like she's having an absolute blast the whole time." ...|$|E
500|$|Gossard said [...] "No Way" [...] {{expresses the}} idea that people just need to live [...] "and quit trying to prove something." [...] According to Vedder, [...] "Given to Fly" [...] is about [...] "rising above anybody's {{comments}} about what you do and still giving your love away," [...] "Do the Evolution" [...] is about [...] "someone who's drunk with technology, who thinks they're the controlling living being on this planet," [...] "MFC" [...] takes place in a car and is about [...] "getting the <b>fuck</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> a problem," [...] and [...] "In Hiding" [...] is about [...] "taking a fast from life." [...] Ament said that [...] "Pilate" [...] concerned a question he was asking himself, dealing with a recurring dream Ament had with being old sitting with his dog on the porch, while [...] "Low Light" [...] was the answer, and that it deals with [...] "a kind of gratefulness at finding that place of calm and peace at my center and getting a glimpse of the person I could choose to be." ...|$|E
500|$|Slay Tracks found {{unexpected}} attention {{after the}} Leeds, England-based band The Wedding Present covered [...] "Box Elder" [...] {{on their own}} 1990 EP, Brassneck. The Wedding Present's bassist, Keith Gregory, had been introduced to Slay Tracks by future Pavement bassist Mark Ibold while visiting New York City. The Wedding Present cover {{is different from the}} original in that the line [...] "that I had to get the <b>fuck</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> this town" [...] was changed to [...] "that I had to get right out of this town". The [...] "Box Elder" [...] cover received radio airplay from influential English disc jockey John Peel, which generated publicity for both The Wedding Present and Pavement. Neither member of Pavement was aware of the cover until Kannberg was informed of it. Kannberg remembered [...] "I was kind of mad. I had no idea that people could do that, so I was all offended." [...] However, his opinion of the cover and its significance later changed: [...] "It was so cool that some band from the UK wanted to cover this obscure, horribly recorded song. At the time I probably never appreciated the full extent of how them covering the song helped Pavement, especially in the UK, but it really did, and I'll always be grateful to them for that." ...|$|E

In the letter, {{he said that the}} party's ailing {{fortunes}} were a direct result of [...] "attacks on the party". He also defended questions by the Electoral Commission about the transparency of BNP funding. In November 2009, Griffin was a witness at the trial of an Asian man, Tauriq Khalid, at Preston Crown Court. The prosecution claimed that in November 2008 Khalid repeatedly drove past a demonstration that Griffin was attending, and on the second occasion shouted [...] "white bastards". Khalid admitted shouting derisory comments at Griffin and other demonstrators, telling the jury he shouted [...] "Nick Griffin, you fucking wanker" [...] and [...] "Get the <b>fuck</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Burnley, you're not welcome here", but denied shouting [...] "white bastard". Griffin gave evidence against Khalid, and affirmed that Khalid had shouted [...] "white bastard" [...] at him. Griffin said the man [...] "leaned {{out of the car and}} pointed at me and made a gun and gang gesture", and that he threatened him by shouting [...] "I'm going to...". Griffin said he had left the demonstration early, fearing for his safety. The 23-year-old defendant denied his comments had any racial intent, and was found not guilty. Griffin later commented [...] "I think it's unfortunate and I think it's wrong, but that's the jury's right. They saw all the evidence, I accept their decision. I'm not going to lose any sleep over it." ...|$|E
500|$|In January1994, Simon co-created with comedian George Carlin {{the sitcom}} The George Carlin Show for Fox. It aired for 27 episodes before being {{canceled}} in December1995. Simon served as showrunner throughout its run and directed several episodes. Simon persuaded Carlin {{to do the}} show after writing it as something which would not be [...] "typically sitcomy." [...] He conceived the show as what Carlin's {{life would have been}} like had he never become a comedian; Carlin played a heavy drinking New York taxi driver. Simon commented: [...] "When I was doing The Simpsons, people couldn't see how smart {{it was because of the}} low moments. There's something about this show. People who like it say it's classy. They don't see how vulgar it is." [...] Carlin wrote negatively of his relationship with Simon. On his own website, Carlin wrote of the show: [...] "always check mental health of creative partner beforehand. Loved the actors, loved the crew. Had a great time. Couldn't wait to get the <b>fuck</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> there." [...] In his final book, the posthumously published Last Words (2009), Carlin elaborated: [...] "I had a great time. I never laughed so much, so often, so hard as I did with cast members Alex Rocco, Chris Rich, Tony Starke. There was a very strange, very good sense of humor on that stage ... The biggest problem, though, was that Sam Simon was a fucking horrible person to be around. Very, very funny, extremely bright and brilliant, but an unhappy person who treated other people poorly." [...] Simon described himself as [...] "combative" [...] and said that most people see him as having a [...] "bad attitude".|$|E

5000|$|The song {{consists}} {{mainly of}} keyboards and drum machines, along with Prince's vocals. Two verses followed by choruses form the main {{basis of the}} song. The song breaks down to an instrumental section with Prince repeating [...] "I wanna fuck you" [...] followed by him saying [...] "Look here, Marsha; I'm not saying this just to be nasty. I sincerely wanna <b>fuck</b> the taste <b>out</b> <b>of</b> your mouth." [...] The final part of the song is an a cappella with Prince stating his philosophy on life—he loves God for fear of the afterlife but he's going to have fun while he can, a theme echoed in [...] "1999". The song was performed live on the Purple Rain Tour.|$|R
5000|$|Like many of {{the films}} {{produced}} by the Dark Brothers, Let Me Tell Ya 'bout Black Chicks is controversial. One scene in particular led to {{the withdrawal of the}} film from the home video market. In the scene involving Sahara, Steve Powers, and Mark Wallice, the two men are dressed as members of the Ku Klux Klan, a white supremacist organization. When the pair encounter Sahara they say [...] "Let's <b>fuck</b> the shit <b>out</b> <b>of</b> this darky!" [...] and begin a series of racist remarks that continues throughout the scene. Despite the insults, or perhaps because of them, Sahara is portrayed as an enthusiastic participant in the sexual encounter, which includes fellatio and double penetration. In relating the encounter to the other maids, Sahara describes the experience as [...] "too good".|$|R
5000|$|To {{create the}} rhythm in [...] "Machine Gun", Portishead sampled the drum machine {{in an old}} {{electronic}} organ. The song's synthesiser outro {{was inspired by the}} film soundtracks of John Carpenter. For [...] "Magic Doors", the band added hurdy-gurdy, and saxophone played by Will Gregory of Goldfrapp. According to Utley, [...] "we made Gregory be a free jazz player that day ... we told him just to go fucking mad, to freak the <b>fuck</b> <b>out.</b> He had to move <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the room, so we couldn't see him, so he'd feel less inhibited." ...|$|R

I remember waking up and seeing the girls and then later I asked Beckett where we were and he said Victoria, on the main road somewhere. And I went off my head.

2500|$|On August 25, 2005 Garbage {{cancelled}} their scheduled October tour {{dates in}} France, Belgium and United Kingdom.

Ahead of the Australian tour, [...] "Sex Is Not The Enemy" [...] was released to Australian radio. The end of the tour {{marked the end of}} active promotion for Bleed Like Me.

2500|$|In 1964, as lead guitarist, Barry Lyde {{joined a}} R group, The Impacts, which {{had formed a}} year earlier with Bob Dames on bass guitar, Mick Hadley on vocals, Fred Pickard on rhythm guitar and Adrian Redmond on drums. The Impacts {{supported}} The Rolling Stones 1965 tour of Australia and when they arrived in Melbourne found another group with the same name, so were renamed The Purple Hearts. They were named for the pep-pills (see purple hearts) favoured by band members – not the US military decoration of same name (see Purple Heart). Their debut recordings were covers of [...] "Gloria" [...] and Graham Bond's [...] "Long Legged Baby" [...] cut to acetate disc in 1965 at Soundtrack Studios, Brisbane. A different version of [...] "Long Legged Baby" [...] was issued as their debut single on Sunshine Records later in 1965. Their highest charting single, [...] "Early in the Morning", was released in October 1966 and peaked at No.24 on Go-Sets National Top40.

[...] "Dames started calling me Lobby because I would lobby the <b>fuck</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> people ... My last name's' L-y-d-e, so he put the 'o' in because it rhymed better". 'Lobby' is also used in Queensland for a freshwater crayfish where other Australians would say 'yabby'.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{conflicting}} {{accounts of}} the events following her arrest in Ghazni. American authorities said that two FBI agents, a US Army warrant officer, a US Army captain, and their US military interpreters arrived in Ghazni the following day on 18 July to interview Siddiqui at the Afghan National Police facility where she was being held. They reported they congregated in a meeting room that was partitioned by a curtain, but did not realise that Siddiqui was standing unsecured behind the curtain. The warrant officer sat down and put his loaded M4 carbine {{on the floor by}} his feet near the curtain. Siddiqui drew back the curtain, picked up the rifle, and pointed it at the captain. [...] "I could see the barrel of the rifle, the inner portion of the barrel of the weapon; that indicated to me that it was pointed straight at my head," [...] he said. Then, she was said to have threatened them loudly in English, and yelled [...] "Get the <b>fuck</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> here" [...] and [...] "May the blood of [...] be on your [...] ". The captain dove for cover to his left as she yelled [...] "Allah Akbar" [...] and fired at least two shots at them, missing them. An Afghan interpreter who was seated closest to her tried to disarm her. At that point the warrant officer returned fire with a 9-millimeter pistol, hitting her in the torso, and one of the interpreters disarmed her. A Justice Department statement said that Siddiqui struck and kicked the officers during the ensuing struggle; [...] "she shout in English that she wanted to kill Americans" [...] and then lost consciousness.|$|E
