And then, from somewhere, he found a third thing. And a fourth," [...] and [...] "pressure piled on pressure relentlessly throughout this brilliant finale as each new success only led to the next, even bigger problem." [...] Gimmers called the chase sequence in the episode [...] "one of the most thrilling traditional chase sequences ever seen on British TV," [...] the interplay between the characters [...] "was handled expertly," [...] and ended with [...] "already I can't wait for the next series!" ...|$|E

60|$|Denis de Beaulieu {{was not yet}} two-and-twenty, but {{he counted}} himself a grown man, and a very {{accomplished}} cavalier into the bargain.

He had put up his horse with due care, and supped with due deliberation; and then, in a very agreeable frame of mind, went out to pay a visit in the grey of the evening. It was not a very wise proceeding on the young man's part. He would have done better to remain beside the fire or go decently to bed. For the town was full of the troops of Burgundy and England under a mixed command; and though Denis was there on safe-conduct, his safe-conduct was like to serve him little on a chance encounter.|$|E
