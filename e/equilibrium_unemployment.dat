40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the existence and}} stability of a long-run <b>equilibrium</b> rate of <b>unemployment</b> in a Post-Keynesian growth model and contrasts it with the NAIRU model. In the latter the <b>equilibrium</b> rate of <b>unemployment</b> determines unanticipated inflation {{in the short run}} and actual unemployment and output in the long run. The real balance effect plays the pivotal role in the transition from the short run to the long run. For the Keynesian model we take the Marglin-Bhaduri (1990) model as our starting point and complement it by Okun's Law for the labor market and a wage curve type of relation for distribution. The distinction between wage-led and profit-led growth regimes in the Marglin-Bhaduri model turns out to be crucial for the long-run <b>equilibrium</b> rate of <b>unemployment.</b> In the profit-led regime, there is a stable <b>equilibrium</b> rate of <b>unemployment</b> that, NAIRU-like, determines growth. In the wage-led regime, however, the <b>equilibrium</b> rate of <b>unemployment</b> is not stable. The long run is thus but a succession of short-run equilibria. Therefore the goods market dominates the labor market even in the long run. ...|$|R

50|$|While general {{equilibrium}} {{theory and}} neoclassical economics generally were originally microeconomic theories, new classical macroeconomics builds a macroeconomic theory on these bases. In new classical models, the macroeconomy {{is assumed to}} be at its unique equilibrium, with full employment and potential output, and that this equilibrium is assumed to always have been achieved via price and wage adjustment (market clearing). The best-known such model is Real Business Cycle Theory, in which business cycles are considered to be largely due to changes in the real economy, unemployment is not due to the failure of the market to achieve potential output, but due to equilibrium potential output having fallen and <b>equilibrium</b> <b>unemployment</b> having risen.|$|E
50|$|The shirking model {{does not}} predict (counterfactually) {{that the bulk}} of the {{unemployed}} at any one time are those who are fired for shirking, because if the threat associated with being fired is effective, little or no shirking and sacking will occur. Instead the unemployed will consist of a (rotating) pool of individuals who have quit for personal reasons, are new entrants to the labour market, or who have been laid off for other reasons. Pareto optimality, with costly monitoring, will entail some unemployment, since unemployment plays a socially valuable role in creating work incentives. But the <b>equilibrium</b> <b>unemployment</b> rate will not be Pareto optimal, since firms do {{not take into account the}} social cost of the unemployment they help to create.|$|E

He published partial research results in a 1994 book, Structural Slumps: The Modern Equilibrium Theory of Employment, Interest and Assets.

50|$|In {{efficiency}} wage models, {{workers are}} paid at levels that maximize productivity instead of clearing the market. For example, in developing countries, firms might {{pay more than}} a market rate to ensure their workers can afford enough nutrition to be productive. Firms might also pay higher wages to increase loyalty and morale, possibly leading to better productivity. Firms can also pay higher than market wages to forestall shirking. Shirking models were particularly influential.Carl Shapiro and Joseph Stiglitz's 1984 paper <b>Equilibrium</b> <b>Unemployment</b> as a Worker Discipline Device created a model where employees tend to avoid work unless firms can monitor worker effort and threaten slacking employees with unemployment. If the economy is at full employment, a fired shirker simply moves to a new job. Individual firms pay their workers a premium over the market rate to ensure their workers would rather work and keep their current job instead of shirking and risk having {{to move to a}} new job. Since each firm pays more than market clearing wages, the aggregated labor market fails to clear. This creates a pool of unemployed laborers and adds to the expense of getting fired. Workers not only risk a lower wage, they risk being stuck in the pool of unemployed. Keeping wages above market clearing levels creates a serious disincentive to shirk that makes workers more efficient even though it leaves some willing workers unemployed.|$|E

40|$|Distinguishing between profit led {{and growth}} led demand regimes, we analyze the {{conditions}} of existence and stability of long run <b>equilibrium</b> of <b>unemployment.</b> The model we employ has at its center the relation between growth and distribution. Growth can be either wage led or profit led. Distribution itself {{is a function of}} the unemployment rate, with higher unemployment leading to a higher profit share. We use Okun's Law to close the model, making the change of the rate of unemployment a function of growth. The interesting result of our analysis is that in profit led demand regime the short run and long run equilibrium are stable. However, if the demand regime is wage led, the same conditions that guarantee stability of the goods market equilibrium in the short run render impossible the existence of a long run <b>equilibrium</b> rate of <b>unemployment,</b> and vice versa. Thus, if Kalecki's proposition that higher wages lead to higher growth is true, there will be no <b>equilibrium</b> rate of <b>unemployment</b> in the long run that serves as an anchor for the economic system.
