40|$|Three {{groups of}} 10 age- and sex-matched nondiabetic volunteers took 0, 750, or 1500 mg of vitamin C {{each day for}} 12 weeks. Glycohemoglobin (GHb) was {{measured}} <b>by</b> <b>HPLC,</b> electrophoresis, affinity chromatography, and immunoassay at baseline (- 4 weeks and - 1 day), during supplementation (6 weeks and 12 weeks), and after supplementation ended (6 and 12 weeks). Plasma vitamin C increased twofold during supplementation but, {{in contrast with the}} results of Davie et al. (Diabetes 1992; 41 : 167 - 73), there were no between-group differences in GHb, glucose, and fructosamine concentrations. Fructosamine may have increased with storage time. The net effects of vitamin C on absolute GHb at 12 weeks vs - 1 day (and at 12 weeks vs 12 weeks after) in %GHb amounted to: HPLC - 0. 035 (- 0. 050); electrophoresis + 0. 005 (+ 0. 035); affinity chromatography - 0. 070 (+ 0. 015); and immunoassay - 0. 110 (+ 0. 025). We conclude that supplementation of nondiabetics with 750 or 1500 mg of vitamin C daily for 12 weeks does not cause interference in GHb <b>determinations</b> <b>by</b> <b>HPLC,</b> electrophoresis, affinity chromatography, or immunoassay, and does not reduce in vivo Hb glycation...|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} study, we explore the {{feasibility}} of Raman spectroscopy for intracellular monitoring of carotenoid in filamentous fungi Blakeslea trispora. Although carotenoid production from this fungus has been extensively studied through various chromatographic methods and ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, no intracellular monitoring has been demonstrated until now. The intensity of the Raman spectrum, and more conveniently that of the strongest ν 1 carotenoid band at ∼ 1, 519 cm- 1, exhibits a good linear correlation with the carotenoid content of the sample as determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy. Our results suggest that Raman spectroscopy can serve as an alternative method for the study and quantification of carotenoid in batch-mated submerged cultivations of B. trispora and similar organisms.

The two compounds were separated on a reversed-phase (C 18) column combined with ion-pair chromatography and detected photometrically or electrochemically. The method was applied successfully to biological systems in which formation of either 3 -hydroxyanthranilic or cinnabarinic acid had been described previously. Thus, interferon-gamma-treated human {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} formed and released {{significant amounts of}} 3 -hydroxyanthranilic acid into the culture medium and mouse liver nuclear fraction possessed high "cinnabarinic acid synthase" activity.

40|$|The {{extraction}} of mercury species (methylmercury, ethylmercury, phenylmercury and inorganic mercury(II)) from fish tissue, its <b>determination</b> <b>by</b> reverse phase <b>HPLC,</b> UV-photochemical generation of cold vapour, and detection by {{atomic absorption spectrometry}} is described in this work. Various extraction agents and digestion methods were compared {{in order to find}} the best alternative. The mixture of 6. 25 % tetramethylammonium hydroxide and 0. 05 mol·l- 1 hydrochloride acid was chosen as the best extraction agent. In addition to the high extraction efficiency, the solution involved positively not only UV-photochemical generation, but also separation of observed species. On the contrary, the poor repeatability was achieved with the microwave-assisted digestion due to the proved sorption of mercury species on the Teflon vessels. Therefore, the extraction by high temperature (50 - 60 řC) in glass bottles was preferred. The results of the determination of the mercury species after the extraction from the real samples were compared to the outcomes obtained by AMA 254. The proposed extraction technique together with the RP-HPLC-UV-CVG-QTAAS is suitable for the speciation analysis of mercury...|$|R

Jiří Plíšek, 2008 Application of {{technology}} new stationary phases in HPLC analysis of biologically active compounds - determination of vitamin E (Abstract) The aim of my graduation thesis {{was to find}} the acceptable stationary phase for pretreatment of biological material [blood plasma] and isolation of vitamin E (α-tocopherol) by SPE technique and subsequent <b>determination</b> <b>by</b> <b>HPLC</b> analysis by using the developed method. LLE was then altered by SPE. I used vitamin A (retinol) as standard for my own work, {{because there is a}} possibility that the simultaneous determination of both vitamins for the laboratory GMK FN HK will be an advantageous combination. The main emphasis was put on vitamin E. Sample preparation - optimized SPE procedure: Blood samples were drawn from the peripheral vein after twelve hours of overnight fast. The samples were then centrifuged (1600 ×g, 10 min, 4 řC) and plasma was separated. Then 250 μl of plasma was added and deproteinized by absolute ethanol (625 μl, 10 min, 4 řC). After centrifugation (1600 ×g, 15 min, 4 řC), the supernatant was separated and applied on the SPE column. Before application of the sample, the SPE column was activated by 1 ml methanol and then washed by 1 ml of purified water. After application of the sample the precipitate was diluted in 625 μl of absolute [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Commonly used herbicides, such as sulfentrazone, {{pose the}} risk of soil {{contamination}} due to their persistence, bioaccumulation and toxicity. Phytoremediation by green manure species has been tested using biomarkers, but analytical data are now required to confirm the extraction of sulfentrazone from soil. Thus, the present work was carried out to analyze sulfentrazone residues in soil based on liquid chromatography with a comparison of these values to {{the sensitivity of the}} bioindicator Pennisetum glaucum. The soil samples were obtained after cultivation of Crotalaria juncea and Canavalia ensiformis at four seeding densities and with three doses of sulfentrazone. The seedlings were collected into pots, at two different depths, after 75 days of phytoremediator sowing and then were used to determine the herbicide persistence in the soil. A bioassay with P. glaucum was carried out in the same pot. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), using UV-diode array detection (HPLC/UV-DAD), was used to determine the herbicide residues. The HPLC determination was optimized and validated according to the parameters of precision, accuracy, linearity, limit of detection and quantification, robustness and specificity. The bioindicator P. glaucum was more sensitive to sulfentrazone than residue <b>determination</b> <b>by</b> <b>HPLC.</b> Changes in sulfentrazone concentration caused by green manure phytoremediation were accurately identified by the bioindicator. However, a true correlation between the size of the species and the analyte content was not identified...|$|E
40|$|The nitrate {{assimilation}} pathway {{represents a}} useful model {{system in which}} to study the contribution of a mycorrhizal fungus to the nitrogen nutrition of its host plant. In the present work we cloned and characterized the nitrate reductase gene (tbnr 1) from Tuber borchii. The coding region of tbnr 1 is 2787 nt in length, and it encodes a protein of 929 amino acids. Biochemical and Northern-blot analyses revealed that nitrate assimilation in T. borchii is an inducible system that responds mainly to nitrate. Furthermore, we cloned a nitrate reductase cDNA (tpnr 1) from Tilia platyphyllos {{to set up a}} quantitative real-time PCR assay that would allow us to determine the fungal contribution to nitrate assimilation in ectomycorrhizal tissue. Using this approach we demonstrated that the level of tbnr 1 expression in ectomycorhizae is eight times higher than in free-living mycelia, whereas tpnr 1 transcription was found to be down-regulated after the establishment of the symbiosis. Enzymatic assays showed that NADPH-dependent nitrite formation markedly increases in ectomycorrhizae. These findings imply that the fungal partner plays a fundamental role in nitrate assimilation by ectomycorrhizae. Amino acid <b>determination</b> <b>by</b> <b>HPLC</b> revealed higher levels of glutamate, glutamine and asparagine in symbiotic tissues compared with mycelial controls, thus suggesting that these amino acids may represent the compounds that serve to transfer nitrogen to the host plant...|$|E

Title of diploma thesis: Secondary {{metabolites}} {{of plant}} cultures in vitro I. Key words: Suspension cultures, Trifolium pratense, phytoestrogens, flavonoids, isoflavonoids Explant cultures are source of plant secondary metabolites. Nevertheless {{the production of}} secondary metabolites is usually low in explant cultures. This production can be increased by elicitation metods. Suitable elicitor is added into the cultivate medium and leads to gene expression and production of secondary metabolites. The {{aim of this study}} was to observe the influence of sodium chloride on the production of flavonoids and isoflavonoids by the Trifolium pratense L. suspension culture (Tempus variety). The culture was cultivated on Gamborg nutriet medium with addition of 2 mg. l- 1 2, 4 - dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and 2 mg. l- 1 6 -benzylaminopurine. Cultivation proceed in 25 řC temperature and 16 hours light/ 8 hours dark period. Then determination of flavonoids in according to Czech Pharmacopoeia 2009 and the <b>determination</b> of isoflavonoids <b>by</b> <b>HPLC</b> method was performed. The best elicitation effect on the production of flavonoids was 175 mmol. l- 1 of sodium chloride after a 3 [...] ...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} performed on virgin olive oils from Coratina and Ogliarola salentina cultivars extracted from green, partially blackened and totally blackened olives in order to evaluate changes in the organoleptic properties and in the shelf-life of the oil. The aim of the investigation was to identify the optimal stage of olive maturation for each cultivar to produce higher quality oils. Routine analyses in accordance with EC regulation no. 2568 / 91, the <b>determination</b> of phenols <b>by</b> <b>HPLC</b> and induction times were carried out. On the whole, the simple phenolic compounds increased as darker olives were used whereas the hydrolysable phenolic compounds decreased. In both the cultivars, total phenols and induction times were significantly higher in the oils obtained from green olives than in oils from totally blackened olives. Hence, it seems advisable to delay olive harvesting for cultivars usually yielding bitter to pungent oils (e. g. Coratina), but to anticipate harvesting for olives producing sweet tasting oils (e. g. O. Salentina). This would produce less bitter Coratina oils, with organoleptic features which may better fulfil consumers' expectations, and O. Salentina oils more resistant to oxidation...|$|R
40|$|Carotenoids are a {{group of}} phytochemicals that are {{recognized}} as playing {{an important role in}} the prevention of several degenerative diseases due to their antioxidant activity. The low water-solubility and poor photostability of b-carotene, a potentially important dietary antioxidant, prompted us to investigate b-carotene complexes able to increase its water solubility as well as its photostability in aqueous solution. In this work we have used humic acid in order to synthesize b-carotene–humic acid complexes in different ratios. Complexes were characterized by FT-IR and DSC. b-Carotene <b>determination</b> were performed <b>by</b> <b>HPLC</b> and antioxidant activity of b-carotene, humic acid and the complexes were determined by the TEAC method. The formulation b-carotene–humic acid 2 : 1 showed the highest photostability and water solubility. The antioxidant activity of the complexes was about 20 times lower than ‘‘free’’ b-carotene, suggesting a decreased chemical reactivity of the carotenoid in the complex. We showed that complexation of b-carotene with humic acids was able to increase its water solubility and photostability, and to affect the antioxidant activity of b-carotene after inclusion in HAs. This work provides a useful tool to avoid antioxidants photodegradation and oxidation by radicals, thus maintaining their biological activity...|$|R
