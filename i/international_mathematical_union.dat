A prize for young mathematicians from developing countries has been created in Ramanujan's name by the International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP) {{in cooperation with the}} <b>International</b> <b>Mathematical</b> <b>Union,</b> which nominate members of the prize committee. The SASTRA University, based in the state of Tamil Nadu in South India, has instituted the SASTRA Ramanujan Prize of US$10,000 to be given annually to a mathematician not exceeding the age of 32 for outstanding contributions in an area of mathematics influenced by Ramanujan. Based on the recommendations of a high level committee appointed by the University Grants Commission (UGC), Government of India, Srinivasa Ramanujan Centre, established by SASTRA, has been declared as an OFF-CAMPUS CENTRE under the ambit of SASTRA University. House of Ramanujan Mathematics, a museum on life and works of the Mathematical prodigy, Srinivasa Ramanujan, also exists on this campus. SASTRA purchased the house where Srinivasa Ramanujan lived at Kumabakonam and renovated it. Vasavi College of Engineering named its Department of Computer Science and Information Technology [...] "Ramanujan Block".|$|E
