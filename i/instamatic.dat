5|$|Pang's book of photographs, <b>Instamatic</b> Karma, was {{published}} in 2008. Besides the candid personal portraits, the book contains some historically important photographs, such as Lennon signing the official dissolution of The Beatles' partnership, and the last known photograph of Lennon and Paul McCartney together. Cynthia Lennon also provided a back cover endorsement, acknowledging Pang's role in reuniting Lennon with his estranged first son, Julian.|$|E

5000|$|A {{new series}} of <b>Instamatics</b> was {{introduced}} in 1970 {{to take advantage of}} the new Magicube flash technology. Magicubes used mechanically triggered pyrotechnic detonators for each bulb, an improvement over flashcubes in that the need for batteries was eliminated. <b>Instamatics</b> with Magicube sockets were denoted by an [...] "X" [...] in the model number (e.g. X-15 or 55X).|$|R

50|$|The first <b>Instamatics</b> went on {{sale for}} $16 in early 1963. They were the first cameras to use Kodak's new 126 format. The easy-load film {{cartridge}} made the cameras very inexpensive to produce, as it provided the film backing plate and exposure counter itself and thus saved considerable design complexity and manufacturing cost for the cameras. A wide variety of print and slide film was sold by Kodak in the 126 format.|$|R
25|$|The photos, {{taken with}} a cheap <b>Instamatic</b> camera, show {{what appears to be}} a male ivory-billed {{woodpecker}} perched on the trunks of two trees in the Atchafalaya Basin of Louisiana. The bird's distinctive bill is not visible in either photo and the photos– taken from a distance– are very grainy. Lowery presented the photos at the 1971 annual meeting of the American Ornithologists Union. Skeptics dismissed the photos as frauds; seeing that the bird is in roughly the same position in both photos, they suggested they may have been of a mounted specimen.|$|E

5000|$|The format was {{introduced}} by Kodak under the brand name Kodapak, together with the <b>Instamatic</b> camera. Although the <b>Instamatic</b> name is sometimes treated as synonymous with the 126 format, Kodak also used it on its later 110-format cameras, which they called Pocket <b>Instamatic</b> and on its [...] "M" [...] series 8 mm movie cameras.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Instamatic</b> is {{a series}} of inexpensive, easy-to-load 126 and 110 cameras made by Kodak {{beginning}} in 1963. The <b>Instamatic</b> was immensely successful, introducing a generation to low-cost photography and spawning numerous imitators.|$|E
5000|$|The lead {{designer}} for the <b>Instamatic</b> program was Dean M. Peterson, also later known {{for most of}} the innovations in the point-and-shoot camera revolution of the 1980s. The first <b>Instamatic</b> to be released was the <b>Instamatic</b> 50, which appeared in the UK in February 1963, about a month before the 100. The first model released in the US was the basic <b>Instamatic</b> 100. With fixed shutter speed of 1/90th of a second, aperture and focus, it continued in the tradition of Kodak's earlier Brownie cameras, providing a simple snapshot camera anyone could use. It also featured a built-in flashgun for AG-1 [...] "peanut" [...] bulbs, a feature lacking in the 50.|$|E
50|$|The Reflex III of 1961 and Reflex IV of 1964 brought minor {{improvements}} {{with the}} former offering a metering needle visible in the finder, and the latter allowing shutter and aperture settings to be visible in the finder. The Reflex IV was produced until 1967. From 1968 to 1974 Kodak AG produced an <b>Instamatic</b> Reflex (SLR) based on the Retina Reflex, accepting the S series lenses, but using <b>instamatic</b> 126 film cartridges and <b>instamatic</b> style flash cubes.|$|E

It was introduced in 1967 to accept Kodak 126 (<b>Instamatic)</b> cartridges. It was one of the very few SLRs taking 126 film, and one of the very few ambitious cameras using that film. (Two other examples of 126 SLRs are the Rolleiflex SL26 and Kodak <b>Instamatic</b> Reflex.) ...|$|E

50|$|Peterson's {{invention}} {{and development of}} the <b>Instamatic</b> camera at Eastman Kodak in the 1960s heralded an unprecedented explosion in amateur snapshot photography. With over 70 million units sold by 1970, there were very few American households without an <b>Instamatic.</b> Based on the simple idea that loading and unloading the film in a camera ought to be a one-step process, the development of the drop-in film cartridge and a line of easy-to-use cameras for it created a phenomenon. Not since George Eastman's introduction of roll film had there been such a sales spike in the photo industry.|$|E
5000|$|... 126 is {{the number}} given to a cartridge-based film format used in still photography. It was {{introduced}} by Kodak in 1963, and is associated mainly with low-end point-and-shoot cameras, particularly Kodak's own <b>Instamatic</b> series of cameras.|$|E
50|$|Rollei also {{produced}} the Rolleiflex SL26, an <b>Instamatic</b> camera with interchangeable lenses. It was {{widely regarded as}} the best camera that used 126 film cartridges, even though this film format was only ever intended for beginners. Although Kodak, too, made an <b>Instamatic</b> SLR camera, their primary objective was to draw attention to their brand of film rather than make money from the camera. Despite the high cost of tooling up to manufacture the SL26, only around 28,000 were ever made. The SL26 cost 628.23 DM, and two accessory lenses were available for it: the wide-angle Pro-Tessar (f/3.2, 28 mm) costing 232.43 DM, and the Pro-Tessar (f/3.2, 28 mm) costing 282.88 DM.|$|E
5000|$|During its heyday, {{the range}} was so {{ubiquitous}} that the <b>Instamatic</b> name is still frequently used (erroneously) {{to refer to}} any inexpensive point-and-shoot camera. (It is also frequently used incorrectly to describe Kodak's line of instant-picture cameras, the Kodamatic series.) ...|$|E
