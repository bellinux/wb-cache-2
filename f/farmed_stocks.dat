50|$|The {{accidental}} {{introduction of}} invasive species is also of concern. Aquaculture {{is one of}} the main vectors for invasives following accidental releases of <b>farmed</b> <b>stocks</b> into the wild. One example is the Siberian sturgeon (Acipenser baerii) which accidentally escaped from a fish farm into the Gironde Estuary (Southwest France) following a severe storm in December 1999 (5,000 individual fish escaped into the estuary which had never hosted this species before). Molluscan farming is another example whereby species can be introduced to new environments by ‘hitchhiking’ on farmed molluscs. Also, farmed molluscs themselves can become dominate predators and/or competitors, as well as potentially spread pathogens and parasites.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the primary}} {{concerns}} with mariculture {{is the potential for}} disease and parasite transfer. <b>Farmed</b> <b>stocks</b> are often selectively bred to increase disease and parasite resistance, as well as improving growth rates and quality of products. As a consequence, the genetic diversity within reared stocks decreases with every generation - meaning they can potentially reduce the genetic diversity within wild populations if they escape into those wild populations. Such genetic pollution from escaped aquaculture stock can reduce the wild population’s ability to adjust to the changing natural environment. Also, maricultured species can harbour diseases and parasites (e.g., lice) which can be introduced to wild populations upon their escape. An example of this is the parasitic sea lice on wild and farmed Atlantic salmon in Canada. Also, non-indigenous species which are farmed may have resistance to, or carry, particular diseases (which they picked up in their native habitats) which could be spread through wild populations if they escape into those wild populations. Such ‘new’ diseases would be devastating for those wild populations because they would have no immunity to them.|$|E
40|$|AbstractAquaculture of the Eurasian perch, Perca fluviatilis, in {{recirculating}} {{systems has}} emerged {{over the past}} decades to become a significant way of diversification for inland areas in Europe. The development of such a production relies partly on the improvement of growth performance (i. e., reducing production costs), which requires suitable genetic management of broodstocks {{and the development of}} selective breeding programs. In this context, the present study was undertaken assessing {{for the first time the}} genetic diversity of <b>farmed</b> <b>stocks</b> of perch. Twelve microsatellite loci were used to investigate the genetic diversity of nine <b>farmed</b> <b>stocks</b> (547 individuals) from two perch farms located in France and their supposedly wild founder population from Lake Geneva (394 individuals). First, the wild population displayed the lowest genetic diversity and differed genetically from all farmed populations except one, XB 2. Second, genetic diversity did not decrease between farmed breeders and their potential offspring. However, in the three groups of broodstock-offspring the number of alleles decreased by 10 %, 21 %, and 15 %, respectively. In addition, effective population size decreased in all offspring groups. A family structuring was also observed among broodstocks and their offspring, with an unequal family contribution being suspected. In the absence of parental information, these results attest to the utility of genetic tools to evaluate genetic diversity and the necessity of a monitoring program to maintain genetic variability among farmed perch. Genetic variability among <b>farmed</b> <b>stocks</b> appears to be sufficient for perch production to be sustainable and selective breeding programs to be developed...|$|E

40|$|Although {{aquaculture}} in the Mediterranean is {{a relatively}} young industry, finfish diseases {{have been reported to}} cause considerable problems and mortalities among the <b>farmed</b> <b>stocks.</b> In general, the farming activity and the open design of Mediterranean aquaculture systems allow the transmission of infectious pathogens within and among farm facilities. Fish health and biosecurity programmes at farms have focused on the most obvious pathways for transmission of pathogens, i. e. through transport of infected farmed fish from hatcheries, infected equipment, staff and vessels, as well as through water currents. However, little attention has been devoted to the potential risk of pathogen and disease transmission in Mediterranean open-sea aquaculture through movements of fish. The present study focuses on the importance of considering possible pathogen transmission between reared fish, farmed escapees and farm-aggregated fish when making management decisions.

40|$|The escape of cultured {{fish from}} a marine {{aquaculture}} facility {{is a type}} of biological invasion that may lead to a variety of potential ecological and economic effects on native fish. This paper develops a general invasive species impact model to capture explicitly both the ecological and economic effects of invasive species, especially escaped farmed fish, on native stocks and harvests. First, the possible effects of escaped farmed fish on the growth and stock size of a native fish are examined. Next, a bioeconomic model to analyze changes in yield, benefit distribution, and overall profitability is constructed. Different harvesting scenarios, such as commercial, recreational, and joint commercial and recreational fishing, are explored. The model is illustrated by a case study of the interaction between native and farmed Atlantic salmon in Norway. The results suggest that both the harvest and profitability of a native fish stock may decline after an invasion, but the total profits from the harvest of both native and <b>farmed</b> <b>stocks</b> may increase or decrease, depending on the strength of the ecological and economic parameters. ...|$|E

Aquaculture propagule pressure was a good predictor of the incidence of farm escapees, which represented 16 % of all free-ranging rainbow trout and were present in 80 % of the study rivers. Hybrids between farm escapes and established trout were present in all rivers at frequencies ranging between 7 and 69 %, and population admixture was positively correlated with genetic diversity. We suggest that non-native salmonids introduced into the Southern Hemisphere could benefit from admixture because local adaptations may not have yet developed, and there may be initially little fitness loss resulting from outbreeding depression.

Surveys of grassland plant species at field level, parasitoid Hymenoptera at the field and farm scale, and bird populations and habitats at farm scale were carried out on 119 grass-based farms across three regions in the Republic of Ireland. In addition, habitat richness and aquatic macroinvertebrates were quantified at landscape scale. Agricultural intensity on the surveyed farms was quantified by mean <b>farm</b> <b>stocking</b> rate, calculated as livestock units per ha (LU/ha), and generalised linear mixed models used to evaluate relationships between stocking rate and the incidence of chosen bioindicator groups. Field scale bioindicators (plant species richness and parasitoid taxon richness and abundance) were negatively associated with mean <b>farm</b> <b>stocking</b> rate. Over much of its observed range, mean <b>farm</b> <b>stocking</b> rate was positively associated with total bird species richness and abundance, and the species richness and abundance of farmland bird indicator species recorded in the winter season. However, these relationships were quadratic, and above a relatively high upper limit of 2. 5 – 3. 5 LU/ha, further increase in <b>farm</b> <b>stocking</b> rate had a negative influence. Results demonstrate that different bioindicators measured at different spatial scales vary in their response to agricultural intensity. The lack of a consistent bioindicator response to <b>farm</b> <b>stocking</b> rate suggests that within predominantly farmed regions, maximising biodiversity requires a careful targeting and monitoring with bioindicator taxa that are informative of influences at relevant operational scales.

The presence of OsHV- 1 infecting these wild populations was detected in all the Adriatic beds, demonstrating high diversity of genotypes, and showing that these individuals {{may play a role}} as reservoir of infection in <b>farmed</b> <b>stocks</b> allocated in the same sites.

30|$|Analysis of the {{chemical}} composition of otoliths has also been widely used as a technique to differentiate among fish stocks within the same species, reflecting differences in {{the chemical}} composition of the individual fish habitat or geographic-associated fish origin (Campana 1999; Thresher 1999). Gillanders et al. (2001) suggested {{that it is difficult}} to detect substantial differences in trace elemental signatures among different populations of wild fish in the Mediterranean, since they move among various coastal habitats. However, our results showed a clear discrimination between wild stocks for sea bass (85.7 – 90  % of wild fish correctly classified) and for sea bream (93.3 – 100  % of fish correctly classified). On the contrary, it was not possible to distinguish with accuracy between <b>farmed</b> <b>stocks</b> for both species. These results might reflect the proximity between farms with similar water chemistries in both areas, but also the similarities among fish culture techniques in the Mediterranean off-shore farms, in terms of net-pen environments, stocking densities, and feeding regimes. Thus, the analysis of trace elements composition in otoliths of sea bass and sea bream can be suggested as a useful method to distinguish between wild fish stocks from different geographical areas, but also to identify escaped fish from farms in the wild. Further researches are necessary to better understand the potential use of the trace elements in otoliths on fish ecology and populations dynamic studies (e.g., migrations, reproduction and growth studies of farmed, escaped, and wild fish), as well as to evaluate their applicability on sustainable coastal aquaculture and fisheries management.|$|E

40|$|The {{aquaculture}} {{industry has}} increasingly {{aimed at improving}} economically important traits like growth, feed efficiency and resistance to infections. Artificial selection represents an important window of opportunity to significantly improve production. However, the pitfall is that selection will reduce genetic diversity and increase inbreeding in the <b>farmed</b> <b>stocks.</b> Genetic tools are very useful in this context as they provide accurate measures of genetic diversity together with many additional insights in the stock status and the selection process. In this study we assessed the level of genetic variability and relatedness over several generations of two lines of experimentally selected European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax L.). The first line was selected for growth over three generations and the second line for both high and low weight loss under a starvation regime over two generations. We used a genomic approach (2549 single nucleotide polymorphism markers derived from double digest restriction site associated DNA sequencing) in combination with eight microsatellites to estimate genetic variation, relatedness, effective population size and genetic differentiation across generations. Individual heterozygosity estimates indicated that the selected lines showed no significant reduction in diversity compared with wild populations. There was, however, a decreasing trend in allelic richness, suggesting the loss of low frequency alleles. We compared the estimates of effective population size from genetic markers with pedigree information and found good correspondence between methods. This study provides important insights in the genetic consequences of selective breeding and demonstrates the operational use of the latest genomic tools to estimate variability, inbreeding and at a later stage domestication and artificial selection...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Betanodaviruses are the causative {{agents of}} Viral Encephalopathy and Retinopathy (VER). To date, more than 50 species {{have proved to}} be {{susceptible}} and among them, those found in genus Epinephelus are highly represented. Clinical disease outbreaks are generally characterized by typical nervous signs and significant mortalities mainly associated with aquaculture activities, although some concerns for the impact of this infection in wild fish have been raised. In this study, the authors present the first documented report describing an outbreak of VER in wild species in the Mediterranean basin. Case presentation In late summer - early winter 2011 (September-December), significant mortalities affecting wild Dusky grouper (Epinephelus marginatus), Golden grouper (Epinephelus costae) and European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) were reported in the municipality of Santa Maria di Leuca (Northern Ionian Sea, Italy). The affected fish showed an abnormal swimming behavior and swollen abdomens. During this epizootic, five moribund fish showing clear neurological signs were captured and underwent laboratory investigations. Analytical results confirmed the diagnosis of VER in all the specimens. Genetic characterization classified all betanodavirus isolates as belonging to the RGNNV genotype, revealing a close genetic relationship with viral sequences obtained from diseased farmed fish reared in the same area in previous years. Conclusion The close relationship of the viral sequences between the isolates collected in wild affected fish and those isolated during clinical disease outbreaks in farmed fish in the same area in previous years suggests a persistent circulation of betanodaviruses and transmission between wild and <b>farmed</b> <b>stocks.</b> Further investigations are necessary to assess the risk of viral transmission between wild and farmed fish populations, particularly in marine protected areas where endangered species are present. </p...|$|E
40|$|International audienceSince 2008, mass mortalities of 1 -yr-old Crassostrea gigas {{associated}} with the ostreid herpesvirus OsHV- 1 μVar have occurred along all the coasts of France when seawater temperature reaches 16 to 17 °C. The present study aimed to characterize the effect of temperature on oyster survival in combination with OsHV- 1 DNA quantification by standard real-time PCR and total vibrio population levels in oyster tissues. To {{examine the effect of}} seawater temperature on disease transmission and related mortality of oysters, cohabitation experiments were conducted between healthy naïve oysters and oysters previously exposed to field conditions in areas where mortalities were occurring. Oysters initially maintained in controlled conditions (free of mortality and negative for OsHV- 1), and then transferred to an area where high mortalities were occurring among <b>farmed</b> <b>stocks,</b> became infected with OsHV- 1 and exhibited high loads of vibrios followed by significant mortalities. When previously exposed oysters were maintained indoors at 13. 0 °C for 40 d and then at 20. 6 °C, they exhibited no mortality, were negative for OsHV- 1 detection, and did not transmit the disease to healthy oysters. Survival of previously exposed oysters maintained indoors at 8 temperatures ranging from 13. 4 to 29. 0 °C varied from 25 to 48 % and was negatively correlated with holding temperature. Concomitantly, survival of naïve cohabiting animals (62 to 98 %) decreased with increasing seawater temperature until a plateau was reached between 16. 2 and 21. 9 °C, and increased at higher temperatures. Therefore, the optimal temperature range for disease transmission from field-exposed to naïve animals was between 16. 2 and 21. 9 °C. Our results suggest that a long-term period (40 d) at low temperature (13 °C) may offer a method of mitigating mortalities in oysters that have been exposed to an infective environment...|$|E

However, {{a wide range}} of applications, accuracies, time-consuming, and economic costs were showed among these techniques. Based on the assumption that farmed fish is grown in a different environment, stocking densities, and feeding regimes compared with wild fish, method based on the features of otoliths is regarded as very successful for stock discrimination (Campana and Neilson 1985; Campana et al. 2000). Otoliths are considered metabolically inert and grow throughout the life of the fish. Due to the trace element, concentrations in otoliths are a function of physiology and environment, they have been used as an indicator of fish populations inhabiting different environments or stock identity (e.g. Geffen et al. 1998; Thorrold et al. 1998; Campana et al. 2000; Gillanders and Kingsford 2000; Sanchez-Jerez et al. 2002; Rooker et al. 2003). Specifically, some studies have successfully attempted to discriminate through trace elements in otoliths, the wild and farm origin of Atlantic salmon Salmo salar (Veinott and Porter 2005; Perrier et al. 2011), trout Salmo trutta and Oncorhyncus mykiss (Zitek et al. 2010), and yellowtail kingfish Seriola lalandi (Gillanders and Joyce 2005). In addition, other studies used the differences on morphology and shape contours of the otoliths to successfully distinguish the wild or farm origin on Atlantic salmon (Hindar and L’Abéelund 1992), cod Gadus morhua (Higgins et al. 2010), but also on sea bass and sea bream (Arechavala-Lopez et al. 2012 a). However, {{there is a lack of}} studies on the latter Mediterranean fish species, regarding the trace elements profiles in otoliths.

40|$|Background Atlantic salmon {{have been}} subject to {{domestication}} for approximately ten generations, beginning in the early 1970 s. This process of artificial selection will have created various genetic differences between wild and <b>farmed</b> <b>stocks.</b> Each year, hundreds of thousands of farmed fish escape into the wild. These escapees may interbreed with wild conspecifics raising concerns for both the fish-farming industry and fisheries managers. Thus, {{a better understanding of the}} interactions between domesticated and wild salmon is essential to the continued sustainability of the aquaculture industry and to the maintenance of healthy wild stocks. Results We compared the transcriptomes of a wild Norwegian Atlantic salmon population (Figgjo) and a Norwegian farmed strain (Mowi) at two life stages: yolk sac fry and post first-feeding fry. The analysis employed 44 k oligo-microarrays to analyse gene expression of 36 farmed, wild and hybrid (farmed dam x wild sire) individuals reared under identical hatchery conditions. Although some of the transcriptional differences detected overlapped between sampling points, our results highlighted the importance of studying various life stages. Compared to the wild population, the Mowi strain displayed up-regulation in mRNA translation-related and down regulation in nervous and immune system -related pathways in the sac fry, whereas up-regulation of digestive and endocrine activities, carbohydrate, energy, amino acid and lipid metabolism and down-regulation of environmental information processing and immune system pathways were evident in the feeding fry. Differentially regulated pathways that were common among life stages generally belonged to environmental information processing and immune system functional groups. In addition, we found indications of strong maternal effects, reinforcing the importance of including reciprocal hybrids in the analysis. Conclusions In agreement with previous studies we showed that domestication has caused changes in the transcriptome of wild Atlantic salmon and that many of the affected pathways are life-stage specific We highlighted the importance of reciprocal hybrids to the deconvolution of maternal/paternal effects and our data support the view that the genetic architecture of the strains studied highly influences the genes differentially expressed between wild and domesticated fish...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{considers}} the factors {{involved in the}} determination of egg quality and fecundity in <b>farmed</b> <b>stocks</b> of rainbow trout (Salmo gairdneri R) • Measurements of egg quality, ie. percentage survivals of eggs and fry, from the production batches of eggs of seven fish farms, showed mean survivals of 70 % to eying but levels of only 35 % to 4. 5 g fry (approx. 130 days post-fertilisation). Under optimum conditions survivals may reach 85 % suggesting that husbandry methods exert significant influences on egg quality. Chemical analyses of the protein, fat, vitellogenin, ash, amino acids, free fatty acid and mineral levels of eggs of varying quality and from parents of different strains showed compositional differences even between individuals of the same stock. However, none of these differences were correlated with egg quality. Egg size showed similar variations but, again under hatchery conditions there was no correlation with differences in egg quality. The only factor which {{has been shown to}} exert a significant influence on egg quality is the time of stripping after ovulation. At 1 0 °C eggs should be removed from gravid females within ten days of ovulation to achieve optimum egg and fry survival. Studies of egg production from approximately 10, 000 broodstock revealed that total fecundity and egg size increased and relative fecundity decreased with increasing fish size. In general, most fish appeared to produce a constant volume of eggs. This is consistent with a hypothesis that egg size can only be increased by parallel reductions in fecundity. Feeding broodstock at half-ration (0. 35 % body weight day- 1) did not affect egg quality but reduced total fecundity and egg size and increased relative fecundity when compared with eggs produced by fish on full-ration. Comparisons of regressions of total fecundity against fish weight for three strains using ANOCO revealed that one strain was significantly more fecund than two other strains considered. Trout of the same strain maintained on different farms behaved similarly suggesting there was some reproducibility of strain characteristics...|$|E
