5|$|These {{features}} were absent from earlier Sumerian excavations. Sophisticated techniques of arrangement of texts, coupled with their composition, evidence the great antiquity of archival and library practices, {{which may be}} far older than {{was assumed to be}} the case before the discovery of the Ebla library. A sizable portion of the tablets contain literary and lexicographic texts; evidence seems to suggest the collection also served—at least partially—as a true library rather than a collection of archives intended solely for use by the kings, their ministers, and their bureaucracy. The tablets show evidence of the early transcription of texts into foreign languages and scripts, classification and cataloging <b>for</b> <b>easier</b> <b>retrieval,</b> and arrangement by size, form and content. The Ebla tablets have thus provided scholars with new insights into the origin of library practices that were in use 4,500 years ago.|$|R

50|$|The {{underlying}} {{storage mechanism}} of graph databases can vary. Some {{depend on a}} relational engine and “store” the graph data in a table (although a table is a logical element, therefore this approach imposes another level of abstraction between the graph database, the graph database management system and the physical devices where the data is actually stored). Others use a key-value store or document-oriented database for storage, making them inherently NoSQL structures. Most graph databases based on non-relational storage engines also add the concept of tags or properties, which are essentially relationships having a pointer to another document. This allows data elements to be categorized <b>for</b> <b>easy</b> <b>retrieval</b> en masse.|$|E

40|$|With the {{development}} of a number of problem-solving method (PSM) libraries, recent work has focused on the need for a method description language to describe PSMs <b>for</b> <b>easier</b> <b>retrieval,</b> understanding and reuse. Fensel, et al. (1999) have proposed a Unified Problem-solving Method Development Language (UPML) to address this need. However, to date, this language is focused on formal descriptions of capabilities, and on ontologies that describe inputs and outputs. While these technical descriptions of a method are clearly important, we suggest that other extra-technical information about PSMs can be essential for cost-effective reuse. This information is especially important for those PSMs that are available as an implemented software product. In some user communities, these informal, pragmatic data about a method are as important as any description of the capabilities of a method. Thus, we suggest that expanding UPML in this direction is an important research task. As an initial step, we p [...] ...|$|R
50|$|Demand signal {{repository}} (DSR) is {{the data}} warehouse designed to integrate and cleanse demand data, and leverage that data to consumer goods manufacturers, service retailers, and end customers efficiently.

When {{focusing on the individual}} parts of the face, persons with ASD direct their gaze primarily to {{the lower half of the}} face, specifically the mouth, varying from the eye trained gaze of typically developing people.

The client part of the PI (PI client) system is suitable for providing BMS in the described building. PI clients are PI software applications, with which end users work and which present the data in a user-friendly environment with interesting graphics. These are desktop applications (PI DataLink, PI ProcessBook, PI Data Access) and web applications (PI WebParts, PI ActiveView, PI Vision).|$|R
