Mielziner, along with some small changes, and concurrently, the approbations by Rabbis Ovadia Yosef and Aharon Feldman were removed. In the second edition (revised and expanded, 1996) however, the approbations were reinstated and other changes were made including mention of Mielziner on the <b>inside</b> <b>title</b> page (similar to the reprinted first edition) but {{no longer on the}} book's front cover; on the back cover, explicit mention of the book being [...] "an adaptation of one section in Mielziner's book" [...] (i.e., part III); and the omission of chapter 12.|$|E

40|$|On Sunday, October 10 th, 2004, the New York Times Magazine {{featured}} {{an article}} with the cover title, “Really, What Does He Think? John Kerry and the Post- 9 / 11 World” (Bai 2004). On {{the cover of}} the magazine was a serious-looking photo of Senator Kerry, superimposed with keywords such as “Terrorism,” “Iraq,” “Al Qaeda,” “Multilateralism,” “Nuclear proliferation,” and so on. While the article itself was intriguing, even more intriguing was the magazine's attempt to capture Kerry's core ideas on American national security with the use of keyword graphics—namely, the keywords on the cover, placed {{in what appeared to be}} a random order around the photo of Kerry, and the underlining of “John Kerry,” “terrorism,” and “Americans” in the <b>inside</b> <b>title.</b> Catchy graphics, but hardly an accurate depiction of the keywords that might actually represent Kerry's thinking on American national security. And, for all the comparison made in the article itself with President Bush's stance on national security, where were the graphics for George W. ? (They did not emerge in the next New York Times Magazine.) The magazine was, nonetheless, making an important point: that words (and the ideas they represent) are emotive—particularly in the highly charged climate of the 2004 presidential campaign...|$|E
40|$|Search Engine queries {{often have}} {{duplicate}} {{words in the}} search string. For example user searching for 2 ̆ 2 pizza pizza 2 ̆ 2 a popular brand name for Canadian pizzeria chain. An efficient search engine must return the most relevant results for such queries. Search queries also have pair of words which always occur {{together in the same}} sequence, for example “honda accord”, “hopton wafers”, “hp newwave” etc. We will hereafter refer to such pair of words as bigrams. A bigram can be treated as a single word to increase the speed and relevance of results returned by a search engine that is based on inverted index. Terms in a user query have a different degree of importance based on whether they occur <b>inside</b> <b>title,</b> description or anchor text of the document. Therefore an optimal weighting scheme for these components is required for search engines to prioritize relevant documents near the top for user searches. The goal of my project is to improve Yioop, an open source search engine created by Dr Chris Pollett, to support search for duplicate terms and bigrams in a search query. I will also optimize the Yioop search engine by improving its document grouping and BM 25 F weighting scheme. This would allow Yioop to return more relevant results quickly and efficiently for users of the search engine...|$|E
