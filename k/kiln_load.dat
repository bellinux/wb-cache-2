40|$|During {{my career}} {{producing}} functional ceramics, I have followed a very traditional working methodology. As with many functional potters, I have always maintained {{a high level}} of productivity. Making many similar pieces allows me to develop an idea and to refine it through the working process. My method for developing a new piece is to first design the form, then to decide upon the desired manipulation of the surface planes and surface, and finally to consider the glazing and decoration to refine this new piece of pottery. I work with the new form systematically attempting to isolate and change specific elements, attempting to make each piece in the series more successful. Finally, changes are made to alter the form and decoration in order to achieve an integration of the new design into the present whole of my work. I make every piece intending that quality and craftsmanship will define each piece as an exceptional piece of pottery. Although my intention is that every piece be exceptional, the percentage of exceptional pots is not that high. In each <b>kiln</b> <b>load,</b> a minority of pieces meets my specific criteria of exceptionality. Although the other pots in each <b>kiln</b> <b>load</b> are of high quality in craftsmanship and finish, these pieces do not have the force, presence and dynamics of the exceptional pieces. In this problem, I attempted to isolate and specify the different characteristics in my present body of work that resulted in a piece I considered exceptional...|$|E

5000|$|The {{firing process}} for paper clay {{is similar to}} firing of {{conventional}} clay. The clay {{still needs to be}} completely dry before firing so the change of water into steam does not cause the clay to explode. Maximum firing temperatures, firing schedules and types of glaze to use for paper clay, are the same as that used for the specific clay used in the paper clay. Some recommend slightly higher firing temperatures. Because dry paper clay is more porous and has greater tensile strength than dry clay, single glaze firing is possible. Due to its higher dry tensile strength there are less breakages during handing and <b>kiln</b> <b>loading.</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{model for}} the {{simulation}} of timber drying in a batch kiln {{has been used for}} the investigation of a set of different questions related to this drying process.

This model has been utilized to investigate the following situations:The effect of sticker thickness on airflow, drying time and final MC standard deviation is illustrated. Thicker stickers mean less timber in a given kiln, but results in shorter drying time. The kiln drying capacity is not influenced very much, but the final MC spread is decreased. The influence of kiln parameters on the final MC standard deviation is investigated and simple formulas are presented for the estimation of this variatio...|$|E
40|$|This thesis principally {{concentrates}} on the prevention of degrade due to collapse during the controlled kiln drying of timber. Collapse is an abnormal shrinkage which occurs in wood during drying to fibre saturation point (FSP). Formation of internal checking {{is often associated with}} it. Collapse is particularly common in native Australian eucalypt timbers. Specific work was also performed on the drying of karri (Eucalyptus diversicolor F. Muell) and brushbox (Tristania conferta R. Br.) as part of the commercialisation process of the Clever Kiln Controller® (CKC). The CKC is a personal computer based kiln control package which uses sensed acoustic emissions (AE) and on-line modelling of drying to optimise the seasoning process. Collapse shrinkage occurs {{as a result of the}} physical flattening of water filled fibre cells due to the action of internal tension. The work on collapse presented in this thesis begins with stress-strain modelling of a single fibre under such conditions. This model predicted that collapse of fibres is precipitated at the inner fibre wall, and that fibre collapse is strongly dependant on temperature. Following the predictions of the single fibre model and observations of drying trials, the concept of a "collapse threshold temperature" was introduced. If wood at moisture content (MC) above FSP is dried at temperatures above the collapse threshold temperature, then it will collapse. If it is dried at temperatures below the collapse threshold temperature, then it will not collapse. This concept was first tested on a 20 m 3 <b>kiln</b> <b>load</b> of Eucalyptus regnans F. Muell. The timber was successfully dried to 40...|$|E

5000|$|The glaze firing {{times for}} raku ware are short: {{an hour or}} two as opposed to up to 16 hours for {{high-temperature}} cone 10 stoneware firings. This is due to several factors: raku glazes mature at a much lower temperature (under , as opposed to almost [...] for high-fire stoneware); kiln temperatures can be raised rapidly; and the <b>kiln</b> is <b>loaded</b> and unloaded while hot and can be kept hot between firings.|$|R
50|$|Additionally, most kilns have {{temperature}} {{differences from}} top to bottom. The amount of difference depends {{on the design of}} the kiln, the age of the heating elements, the load distribution in the kiln, and the cone number to which the kiln is fired. Usually, kilns have a greater temperature difference at cooler cone numbers. Cones should be used on the lower, middle and top shelves to determine how much difference exists during firing. This will aid in the way the <b>kiln</b> is <b>loaded</b> and fired to reduce the difference. Downdraft venting will also even out temperatures variance.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{improvement}} and optimization of air-distribution systems in drying kilns {{contributes to the}} preservation of the quality, safety and shelf life of perishable products. The present study reports on the numerical solution of airflow within a two dimensional drying <b>kiln</b> enclosure <b>loaded</b> with wooden pallets. The performance of air flow field is examined with and without supply of wooden pallets. Different arrangements of the supplied wooden pallets are investigated as well as the use of a screen in order to improve the airflow filed. The steady state RANS equations that formulate the flow problem are solved along with a turbulence model that is the standard k-εor the rng k-ε. The effect of the turbulence modeling is distinguished through direct comparisons of the derived airflow patterns. The results obtained show the presence of stagnant zones inside the pallets columns and above of them and the presence of recirculation regions in different zones of the drying kiln with the two turbulence models. ...|$|R
40|$|Scheduling {{research}} has mainly focused on development of efficientÃ‚Â· algorithms for solving deterministic and single criterion models {{to overcome the}} associated computational time complexity. However, scheduling in practice, demands development of effective approaches in order {{to fill the gap}} between the theory and practice. As many other decision processes, scheduling usually involves imprecisely defined problem parameters and multiple conflicting criteria in real-life domains. This thesis aims to put forward novel methodologies for solving some real-life production scheduling problems. In particular two problems have been tackled that are faced in the production process of the collaborating establishment Denby Pottery Ltd: an integrated loading and scheduling problem of a batch processing kiln that is used to fire glazed products and scheduling of parallel flow-lines where products to be input to the firing kiln are glazed. The first problem concerns both short-term criteria of relevance to the shop-floor and criteria that are related to the longer term objectives of the firm. The short-term objectives, which are reduction of energy consumption and work-in-process inventories, can be modelled using crisp objective functions. The longer-term objectives of meeting financial targets of the firm and attaining balanced end-product inventory levels constitute imprecise goals to be achieved. Moreover, the relative importance of criteria is also iniprecisely defmed. A novel fuzzy goal programming method is developed for solving the <b>kiln</b> <b>loading</b> and scheduling problem. This method takes into account not only fuzzy goals but also fuzzy Ã‚Â•importance relations among the goals. A new fuzzy goal programming model of the problem is built. A prototype decision support system is developed that involves this model as its model base. The effectiveness of the developed methodolo. gy in producing different non-. dominated solutions has been demonstrated. The second problem considers scheduling of a set ofjobs on parallel non-identical flow. ~ ines with respect to sequence dependent set-ups, flow-line eligibilities and fuzzy due-dates.

40|$|The lumber {{drying process}} uses about 80 % {{of the total}} heat {{consumption}} in sawmills. Efforts to increase energy efficiency in lumber kilns were very restricted due to the low biomass prices between the 80 th and 90 th. Today with higher production and biomass prices, companies want to decrease their own use of biomass and increase the heating system efficiency. The study proposes alternative {{ways to reduce the}} heat consumption at batch kilns by recirculation of the evacuation air and addresses particular problem encountered in sawmills. Which produce their own heat and suffer from bottlenecks in the heating system due to high heat load from the dryers and increased production. The study shows the possibility to recycle the evacuation air from each kiln which reduces the overall heat consumption of the kilns by 12 %. At nationally basis this corresponds to a decrease of heat consumption of 440 GWh annually, among Swedish sawmill. This will decrease the individual heat consumption of the <b>kilns,</b> heat <b>load</b> in the heating system and the bottleneck effect in the drying process. The decreased own use of biomass brings benefits of more available biomass to the market and increased profits for the sawmill. Godkänd; 2010; 20101208 (janand...|$|R

40|$|The {{white liquor}} {{preparation}} {{is one of}} the main purposes of the recovery cycle in a kraft pulp mill and the lime kiln, being the single unit operation handling bulk solid materials, poses particular challenges in the recovery cycle. In this study, the influence of a dusting lime kiln on the preparation of white liquor was studied. The investigation showed that the dusting lime kiln produced a burned lime with a substantial fraction of fines at the expense of the fraction of granules, whereas a clear lime kiln had virtually no fines and more granules instead. Burned lime from both dusting and clear periods were collected and separated into fines and granules. The different fractions were slaked and causticized in a synthetic green liquor. The study found that the fines always delivered a lower effective alkali in the resulting white liquor, and that the particle sizes of the lime mud were always larger than those originating from the granules, implying that the fines were sintered harder. The industrial consequence is that a dusting lime <b>kiln</b> increases the <b>load</b> on the <b>kiln</b> because the yield of effective alkali is lower; it also introduces a greater dead load into the liquor cycle...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2008 A {{mathematical}} {{and then}} a numerical model were developed for simulating a convective batch lumber drying process. The model incorporates mass and heat transfer relationships within the lumber stack, as well as thermodynamic properties of the wood and drying air. It takes into account a change of air properties along the stack {{and its effect on}} the mass and heat transfer parameters. Kiln and individual board properties as well as a drying schedule are the input parameters that are defined and entered by a user. The model relies on the drying rate functions which are empirical correlations based on single-board tests. The drying rate function for hemlock was obtained based on experiment results from 23 small charges dried over a range of conditions used in industry. Three larger batches of hemlock were also dried using three different industrial schedules. The change of average moisture content with time predicted by the model was verified by weighing a <b>kiln</b> charge with <b>load</b> cells during drying. The change of board temperatures and temperature drop along the stack were verified by measuring the actual temperatures in the kiln during drying. The model was first validated against data available in the literature. Then the experimentally-determined drying function for hemlock was used as the model input and the model output was compared to the larger hemlock batches. Validated variables for both cases were board temperatures, temperature drop through the package and average moisture content of the package...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the influence of the converter of frequency use on the reduction of the electric energy consumption during the fans work in kiln drying operations. The study was carried out in a conventional kiln, masonry made, truck loaded, with nominal capacity of 200 m, used for drying Pinus taeda wood. The kiln ventilation system was superior, provided by 7 fans with engines of 25 HP each one, totalizing 175 HP of installed potency. It was utilized Pinus taeda wood with 40 mm of thickness, which was dried until 10 % of final moisture content. Initially, it was done an analysis of the air velocity distribution inside the <b>loaded</b> <b>kiln</b> at the lowest and highest fans potency (36 and 60 Hz). The fans velocities were controlled by a converter of frequency. To evaluate the influence of the converter of frequency in the consumption of electric energy, there were kiln dried two loads: one at constant and other at changeable air velocity, but with the same drying schedule. The results showed a significant saving of electric energy of around 35 %. The costs of electric energy were reduced from US$ 4. 49 to US $ 2. 92 per cubical meter of dried wood, which resulted in an annual economy of approximately US $ 32, 950, 00. The economic analysis demonstrated that the pay back of the investment applied with the acquisition of the converter of frequency occurs in less than 12 months, making the investment feasible...|$|R
40|$|Proyecto de Graduación (Licenciatura en Ingeniería Ambiental) Instituto Tecnológico de Costa Rica, Escuela de Química, 2015. Approximately 40 % of {{residual}} biomass in Costa Rica is wasted. Lignocellulosic wastes are a part; {{though they are}} generated in significant quantities in Costa Rica, they often lack proper management. Their disposal in landfills involves transportation and handling costs, implies later emissions of greenhouse gases, and shortens the lifespan of the landfills. One way to valorize these wastes is carbonization. A portable, 55 gallon capacity, low cost carbonizer that is simple to operate, was designed and constructed at the Instituto Tecnológico de Costa Rica in 2012. This carbonizer is evaluated in the present work; to assess its performance, two locally common wastes were used: construction waste and waste from a pallet factory. Three carbonization essays per feedstock were made. Charcoal yield, firewood requirements, temperatures, times and processes, smoke emission, and charcoal quality were assessed. Charcoal quality was assessed by its organoleptic properties, densities, moisture, resistance to compression, volatiles, ash and heat content, germination inhibition and earthworm refusal. These tests were chosen considering {{the use of the}} charcoal as an energy vehicle and its use as a soil amendment. Yields were 32 % and 29 % relative to the processed feedstock mass, respectively, which is better than the expected yields according to the type of kiln. Firewood required for the process was in average 34 % relative to the total mass of feedstock. The average processing time was 5 hours. Processing time and firewood requirements can be reduced by combining 2 or more reactors. Charcoal obtained had good quality fuel, according to the most analyzed properties; as a soil amendment, results of the germination test and the earthworm test refusal suggest it did not contain harmful substances. The performance of the carbonizer was very good, however, improvement options were pinpointed, regarding use of wasted heat, completion of gas combustion, maintenance of the <b>kiln</b> and <b>loading</b> of the biomass. The carbonizer showed to be a useful tool for the valorization of lignocellulosic wastes and it produces a good quality charcoal. The eventual annual cost of disposition of the wastes in a landfill was estimated in approximately US $ 36 thousand for the pallet waste and US $ 75 thousand for the construction waste. The value of the charcoal that could be produced annually from the wastes considered was estimated in approximately US 20 $ 450 thousand for the pallet waste and approximately US $ 650 thousand for the construction waste.
