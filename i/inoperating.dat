40|$|Conventional DRAM {{architectures}} havereached their practical {{upper limit}} <b>inoperating</b> frequency and bus width. Mass-market CPUs operating at over 200 MHz and media processors executing more than 2 GOPs (gigaoperations per second) 1, 2 {{are now in}} production. Their external memory band-width of approximately 500 Mbytes/s cannot meet increasing application demands. In addition, no longer does just the CPU con-sume the majority of main memory band-width. A modern multimedia PC’s graphics accelerator, media processor, and system I/O all consume significant memory bandwidth. Efforts to extend conventional DRAMs have included scaling the SDRAM’s memo-ry clock from 66 -MHz to 100 -MHz operation...|$|E
40|$|There is {{proposed}} system control by operability, survivability {{and safety of}} complex technical systems (CTS) {{under the influence of}} destabilizing risk factors, the conceptual and information uncertainty as the system of timely decisions making on operational prevent potential accident and catastrophic situations. The strategy of guaranteed survivability functioning CTS is based on the proposal axiom risk situations and the principle of timely detection and elimination of causes for the possible transition of the operating object state to the <b>inoperating</b> state taking into account the margin of permissible risk in the dynamics of abnormal mode of CTS operation. The developed methodical-algorithmic tools to support guaranteed survivability functioning CTS in the real time is implemented as an information platform of technical diagnostics, which allows for contingencies and emergencies timely decision to change the mode of operation of the facility, artificial adjustment of some parameters in order to return their values in normal mode. The principal criteria are timely identification of the causes of abnormal and accident states taking into account the threshold time limit. ?????????? ????????? ?????????? ??????????????????, ?????????? ? ????????????? ???????????????? ??????? ??????????? ??????

40|$|The {{design and}} {{establishment}} of the operating theatre (OT) {{is not a simple}} architecture engineering work. This project needs a specialized planning and execution effort from all engineering specialists driven andcoordinated by the needs, preferences and safety of the medical/surgical team. More than one reference <b>inoperating</b> theatre design is available, but each reference is dedicated for the design of a special part of theproject. This paper presents a complete comprehensive integrated paperless database application programcalled Operating Theatre Design Analyzer (OTDA). This application is used to ensure the OT designcompliance with seven international standards and three accreditation programs integrated with eachother. It helps the owners of healthcare facilities or those who are interested in this area to identify andsolve the problems in the OT design. The program was introduced to some hospitals in different Arabcountries for evaluation; the percentage of compliance with standard for each item in OTDA was recorded. The analysis of the results reflects a lack of infection control awareness and misunderstanding of the roleof the clinical engineer in OT design and healthcare facilities design as whole...|$|E
40|$|In a {{prospective}} study {{conducted in the}} Postgraduate Department of Orthopaedics Govt. Medical College,Jammu, {{over a period of}} 2 years. Forty cases, both male and female in the age group of 20 to 50 years withthoracolumbar spinal injury between D 11 and L 2 vertebra with neurological deficit were included. Out ofthese forty cases, 20 cases were managed by posterior decompression and stabilization with Steffeeplating and 20 cases of similar injuries were managed conservatively and comparison of the two groupswas made. The results were analyzed according to neurological improvement as per Frankel's grading, thecomplications and the duration of hospital stay in both the groups. In operative group; 50 % of the patientsshowed some degree of recovery with 30 % of the patients showed full recovery. The mean postoperativecorrection of kyphosis was 12. 5 % and the average hospital stay was 23. 7 days. 15 % of the patients <b>inoperated</b> group developed complications. In the conservative group; 30 % of the total patients showedneurological recovery with 20 % patients showed significant recovery (Grade D). There were variouscomplications in 65 % patients and the average hospital stay was recorded as 40. 5 days. General complicationswere more in conservative group. In view of increased incidence of neurological recovery, decreasedincidence of complications, decrease in hospital stay and ease of nursing care in case of operated group,we recommend posterior spinal fixation with Steffee plate system in patients with unstable dorsolumbarspinal fractures especially with incomplete neurological deficit to be adopted in oprative practise...|$|R
