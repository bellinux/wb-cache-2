25|$|Originally, Ion Luca {{was known}} as Ioanne L. Caragiali. His family and friends <b>knew</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> Iancu or, rarely, Iancuţu—both being antiquated hypocoristics of Ion. The {{definitive}} full version of his features the syllable ca twice in a row, which is generally avoided in Romanian due to its scatological connotations. It has however {{become one of the}} few cacophonies accepted by the Romanian Academy.|$|E
25|$|When {{he first}} arrived in Paris, he wrote home {{regularly}} to his mother, he sketched his nudes at the Académie Colarossi, and he drank wine in moderation. He {{was at that time}} considered by those who <b>knew</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> a bit reserved, verging on the asocial. He is noted to have commented, upon meeting Picasso who, at the time, was wearing his trademark workmen's clothes, that even though the man was a genius, that did not excuse his uncouth appearance.|$|E

In 1984, {{the family moved to}} the Beeston area of Leeds, then to Colwyn Road (also in Beeston) when Tanweer was seven. Known as Kaka (little one) by his family, he attended Wortley High School, where he was described as politically moderate by his friends, who <b>knew</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> an outstanding sportsman, excelling at cricket, triple jump, long-distance running, football, and ju-jitsu.|$|E

Most {{customers}} <b>knew</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> “Eli.” He was cited for giving alcohol to a minor July 29, the same day a 59-year-old man was stabbed in Flint, Michigan. Abuelazam’s legal address is in Bradenton, Florida, according to the warrant. He previously lived in Grand Blanc, Michigan, according to Michigan Secretary of State records.

25|$|U Hla {{was imprisoned}} {{for the fifth}} time in 1978, this time with his wife Daw Amar and their {{youngest}} son Nyein Chan (b. 1952) who were both released later than U Hla in 1979. His second son Po Than Gyaung had gone underground in 1976 to join the Communists like his brother before him. U Hla's death at the age of 72, in August 1982, was unexpected by most who <b>knew</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> someone who had always lived a healthy life, although he developed diabetes later in life. He was suddenly taken ill just {{as he was about to}} be interviewed by a Japanese woman researcher accompanied by the writer Maung Tha-ya, rushed to hospital, and he died the same evening.|$|E
25|$|In the 1960s Gryce reinvented {{himself as}} a public school teacher in New York. He was {{somewhat}} interested in education throughout his life, and {{was said to be}} an excellent music instructor. He received a master's degree in education from Fordham University in 1978 and developed an incredible passion for teaching. He left a lasting legacy at Elementary School No. 53 in the Bronx, which was renamed in his honor after his death. Students, colleagues, and parents who encountered Gryce during this time <b>knew</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> a very private, serious, passionate, and caring man. Believing that music aided literacy, Gryce was a strict but caring teacher, and {{went out of his way}} to aid students at educational risk, working at an under-resourced mostly black and Hispanic school.|$|E

25|$|Early in {{the morning}} {{somebody}} wakens me, I open my eyes and that's when my roommate from the Mexico Olympic Games says, 'Get up, Monie was killed by Arab terrorists'. I <b>knew</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> a joker but that sounded too serious, so without thinking much, in my pyjamas, I went to the entrance door of the apartment, opened it and looked around. I have seen guards from the village and they were speaking to somebody that {{was standing in the}} entrance to apartment number one. I have noticed his dark skin and the hat and I listened, still without being afraid or thinking that something is very dangerous for me, and the guards are asking the permission to let the Red Cross enter apartment one and provide some aid to a wounded person and the man, he refuse. They said, 'Why should you be inhumane ?', and the man replied something like either, the Jews or the Israelis 'are not humane either.' At that point I understood that something is going on and I closed the door.|$|E
500|$|Fellow {{students}} described Cho as a [...] "quiet" [...] {{person who}} [...] "would not respond if someone greeted him." [...] Student Julie Poole recalled {{the first day}} of a literature class the previous year when the students introduced themselves one by one. When it was Cho's turn to introduce himself, he did not speak. According to Poole, the professor looked at the sign-in sheet and found that, whereas all the others had written out their names, Cho had written only a question mark. Poole added that [...] "we just really <b>knew</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> the question mark kid".|$|E
500|$|By 1965 Karman {{had become}} a {{respected}} member of the PKI, although the public <b>knew</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> a member of Partindo. However, following {{the failure of the}} 30September Movement ( [...] , or G30S) coup in the national capital at Jakarta– orchestrated by the PKI– Karman realised that his position was unsound. He and his fellow PKI members began praying regularly, but many were ultimately killed– including Triman and Margo. Karman escaped from Pegaten hours before soldiers came to arrest him and managed to avoid capture for nearly two months, generally hiding in cemeteries. After his capture Karman was exiled to Buru.|$|E

40|$|Edward Osborne Wilson, Pellegrino University Professor and Curator in Entomology at the Museum of Comparative Zoology, Harvard University, is {{probably}} known {{to different people}} for different things.

Some <b>know</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> the social insect specialist, author of Insect Societies and, the Pulitzer prize winning, The Ants written with Bert Hölldobler.

500|$|After the shooting, {{authorities}} intercepted {{a number}} of packages he sent to her, which included such items as a gun holster and ammunition, a textbook on serial killers for her class, the book The Antichrist by Friedrich Nietzsche, and a final note written for her, signed with his given name and family name. The shooting was baffling to those who <b>knew</b> <b>him,</b> <b>as</b> he appeared outgoing and never appeared to have social problems. This has also confused investigators, who have not found a suicide note. Some of Kazmierczak's former NIU roommates described him as a quiet man who usually stayed to himself. [...] They stated that, while fairly normal, they did not see him spend much time with other students.|$|E
500|$|Perhaps {{the best-known}} story about Washington's {{childhood}} {{is that he}} chopped down his father's favorite cherry tree and admitted the deed when questioned: [...] "I can't tell a lie, Pa." [...] The anecdote was first reported by biographer Parson Weems, who interviewed people after Washington's death who <b>knew</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> a child over a half-century earlier. The Weems text was very widely reprinted throughout the 19th century, for example in McGuffey Readers. Adults wanted children to learn moral lessons from history, especially as taught by example from the lives of great national heroes like Washington. After 1890 historians insisted on scientific research methods to validate every statement, {{and there was no}} documentation for this anecdote apart from Weems' report that he learned it from one of the neighbors who knew the young Washington. Joseph Rodman claimed in 1904 that Weems plagiarized other Washington tales from published fiction set in England, but no one has found an alternative source for the cherry tree story.|$|E
500|$|A. O. Scott of The New York Times was not {{impressed}} with Reeves' performance, commenting that [...] "even Klaatu looks bored and distracted, {{much as he}} did back when we <b>knew</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> Neo." [...] William Arnold of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer gave the film a B minus and wrote, [...] "It's a decent enough stab at being what the old movie was to its time, following the same basic plot, full of respectful references to its model, updated with a gallery of fairly imaginative special effects." [...] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film two stars and noted that the film had [...] "taken its title so seriously that the plot stands still along with it", but also stated that it was [...] "an expensive, good-looking film that is well-made by Scott Derrickson". Claudia Puig of USA Today gave the film two stars and wrote in her review she felt the film was [...] "musty and derivative" [...] and thought its only bright spot was 10-year-old Jaden Smith's [...] "engaging, lively performance".|$|E

500|$|In Hawaii, Rosenberg {{was known}} for his long white beard and his personality, which was {{described}} by those who <b>knew</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> charming and witty. He cast optimistic horoscopes for anyone who asked, and soon became popular with Hawaiians. He was nicknamed [...] "Rosey", owing to his cheery attitude and witty remarks. After Rosenberg became well known, he {{came to the attention of}} King Kalākaua, who granted him a royal audience. Rosenberg was present at a birthday celebration for King Kalākaua at ʻIolani Palace in November 1886. Rosenberg's fame led to satire: he regularly appeared in a Hawaiian Gazette gossip column, which mockingly called him [...] "Holy Moses", and was satirized by a troupe of amateur minstrels at the Hawaii Opera House. In February 1887, he paid for a notice to be placed in The Honolulu Advertiser, in which he claimed to have lost a letter that was sent to him by Queen Victoria. There has been speculation that the advertisement was a hoax designed by Rosenberg to lend himself prestige.|$|E
500|$|Macaulay's bowling {{action was}} relaxed and effortless, being admired by his contemporaries. Kilburn wrote: [...] "His run-up was half-shambling, his steps short and his {{shoulders}} swaying, but {{his feet were}} faultlessly placed and his aim was high at the instant of delivery". However, critics and team-mates more widely <b>knew</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> passionate, hostile and fiery when bowling. Kilburn said that batsmen were Macaulay's [...] "mortal enemies". He knew many tricks to dismiss or unsettle them, including the tactic of bowling the ball straight at their head without pitching, which was usually considered dangerous and unfair. Kilburn observed that [...] "should the batsman survive he would be rewarded with a glare of concentrated venom calculated to stagger any but the stoutest heart... Every scrap of his heart and soul went into every ball he bowled. He never gave up and his persistence was invariably triumphant sooner or later". The Yorkshire Post, after his death, observed: [...] "Macaulay will always be remembered for the fierceness of his enthusiasm {{when there was a}} fighting chance of victory".|$|E
500|$|Newton {{undertook}} {{the first}} of his fifty-two operational sorties on 1January 1943, under the leadership of his commanding officer, Squadron Leader Keith Hampshire. During February, Newton flew low-level missions through monsoon conditions and hazardous mountain terrain, attacking Japanese forces ranged against Allied troops in the Morobe province. In early March, he took part in the Battle of the Bismarck Sea, one of the key engagements in the South West Pacific theatre, bombing and strafing Lae airfield to prevent its force of enemy fighters taking off to intercept Allied aircraft attacking the Japanese fleet. Newton gained a reputation for driving straight at his targets without evasive manoeuvre, and always leaving them in flames; this earned him the nickname [...] "The Firebug". The Japanese gunners, however, reportedly <b>knew</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> [...] "Blue Cap", from his habit of wearing an old blue cricket cap on operations. In spite of the hazards of the air war in New Guinea, he was quoted as saying, [...] "The troops on the ground should get two medals each, before any airman gets one".|$|E

500|$|On 5March 1917, {{shortly after}} commencing {{operations}} with No.1 Squadron, Williams narrowly avoided crash-landing when his engine stopped {{while he was}} bombing the railway terminus at Tel el Sheria. At first believing {{that he had been}} struck by enemy fire, he found that the engine switch outside his cockpit had turned off. Within 500feet of the ground he was able to switch the engine back on and return to base. On 21April, Williams landed behind enemy lines to rescue downed comrade Lieutenant Adrian Cole, having the day before pressed home an attack on Turkish cavalry whilst under [...] "intense anti-aircraft fire"; these two actions earned him the Distinguished Service Order for [...] "conspicuous gallantry". He was promoted major in May and given command of No.1 Squadron, which was re-equipped with Bristol Fighters later that year. [...] "Now for the first time," [...] wrote Williams, [...] "after 17 months in the field we had aircraft with which we could deal with our enemy in the air." [...] His men <b>knew</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> a teetotaller and non-smoker, whose idea of swearing was an occasional [...] "Darn me!".|$|E
500|$|Having no {{permanent}} drummer, Paul McCartney looked {{for someone to}} fill the Hamburg position. Best had been seen playing in the Casbah with his own group, the Black Jacks, and {{it was noted that}} he was a steady drummer, playing the bass drum on all four beats in the bar, which pushed the rhythm. In Liverpool, his female fans <b>knew</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> being [...] "mean, moody, and magnificent", which convinced McCartney he {{would be good for the}} group. After the Black Jacks broke up, McCartney convinced Best to go to Hamburg with the group, by saying they would each earn £15 per week (equivalent to £ in [...] ). As Best had passed his school exams (unlike Lennon, McCartney and Harrison, who had failed most of theirs), he had the chance to attend teacher-training college, but he decided that playing in Hamburg would be a better career move. Best had an audition in the Jacaranda club, which Williams owned, and travelled to Hamburg the next day. Williams later said that the audition with Best was unnecessary, as the group had not found any other drummer willing to travel to Hamburg, but did not tell Best in case he asked for more money.|$|E
500|$|Within the {{contemporary}} American literary scene Griswold {{became known as}} erratic, dogmatic, pretentious, and vindictive. As historian Perry Miller wrote, [...] "Griswold was about as devious as they came {{in this era of}} deviousness; did not ample documentation prove that he actually existed, we might suppose him... one of the less plausible inventions of Charles Dickens". Later anthologies such as Prose Writers of America and Female Poets of America helped him become known as a literary dictator, whose approval writers sought even while they feared his growing power. Even as they tried to impress him, however, several authors voiced their opinion on Griswold's character. Ann S. Stephens called him two-faced and [...] "constitutionally incapable of speaking the truth". Even his friends <b>knew</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> a consummate liar and had a saying: [...] "Is that a Griswold or a fact?" [...] Another friend once called him [...] "one of the most irritable and vindictive men I ever met". Author Cornelius Mathews wrote in 1847 that Griswold fished for writers to exploit, warning [...] "the poor little innocent fishes" [...] to avoid his [...] "Griswold Hook". A review of one of Griswold's anthologies, published anonymously in the Philadelphia Saturday Museum on January 28, 1843, but believed to have been written by Poe, asked: [...] "What will be [...] fate? Forgotten, save only by those whom he has injured and insulted, he will sink into oblivion, without leaving a landmark to tell that he once existed; or if he is spoken of hereafter, he will be quoted as the unfaithful servant who abused his trust." ...|$|E
