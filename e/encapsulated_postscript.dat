50|$|In computers, J2STask is a {{software}} product {{that was developed}} by J2S to streamline the workflow of people who process digital raster graphics (or <b>Encapsulated</b> <b>PostScript)</b> files. It is designed to automatically complete repetitive operations on large numbers of image files stored on a local hard disk, or on an ftp server (J2S, n.d.). It requires Mac OS X v10.2 or newer, and costs 1,200 EUR (MacMinute, 2004).|$|E
5000|$|... gnuplot {{can produce}} output {{directly}} on screen, or in many formats of graphics files, including Portable Network Graphics (PNG), <b>Encapsulated</b> <b>PostScript</b> (EPS), Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG), JPEG and many others. It is also {{capable of producing}} LaTeX code that can be included directly in LaTeX documents, making use of LaTeX's fonts and powerful formula notation abilities. The program can be used both interactively and in batch mode using scripts.|$|E
50|$|The <b>encapsulated</b> <b>postscript</b> {{produced}} by Metapost can {{be included in}} TeX, ConTeXt, and LaTeX documents via standard eps-inclusion commands. This output can also {{be included in the}} PDFTeX dialect of TeX, thus directly giving PDF output from TeX. This ability is implemented in ConTeXt and in the LaTeX graphics package, and can be used from plain TeX via the supp-pdf.tex macro file. ConTeXt even supports the creation of MetaPost files from within the TeX file.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Encapsulated</b> <b>PostScript</b> (EPS) is a DSC-conforming PostScript {{document}} {{with additional}} restrictions which {{is intended to}} be usable as a graphics file format. In other words, EPS files are more-or-less self-contained, reasonably predictable PostScript documents that describe an image or drawing and can be placed within another PostScript document. Simply, an EPS file is a PostScript program, saved as a single file that includes a low-resolution preview [...] "encapsulated" [...] inside of it, allowing some programs to display a preview on the screen.|$|E
5000|$|The Generic Mapping Tools (GMT) are an {{open-source}} {{collection of}} computer software tools for processing and displaying xy and xyz datasets, including rasterisation, filtering and other image processing operations, and {{various kinds of}} map projections. The software stores 2-D grids as COARDS-compliant netCDF files and comes with a comprehensive collection of free GIS data, such as coast lines, rivers, political borders and coordinates of other geographic objects. Users convert further data (like satellite imagery and digital elevation models) from other sources and import them. GMT stores the resulting maps and diagrams in PostScript (PS) or <b>Encapsulated</b> <b>PostScript</b> (EPS) format.|$|E
5000|$|SCORE runs {{under the}} DOS {{operating}} system. Music is entered using an ASCII input code. Optionally a MIDI keyboard {{can be used}} to enter pitches. Less common is entering music from a so-called menu staff using a one-click copy-and-paste method. Music notation can be saved in SCORE's proprietary format. These files in most cases have the extensions [...] ".mus" [...] or [...] ".pag" [...] (note that Finale also uses the extension [...] ".mus" [...] while the file format is different). SCORE outputs PostScript graphics that can either be sent to a PostScript printer directly or can be saved as an <b>Encapsulated</b> <b>PostScript</b> file. For creating publications some users import the EPS-graphics into a desktop publishing program.|$|E

5000|$|... dvipdfm is a DVI-to-PDF {{translator}} {{developed by}} Mark A. Wicks. The early documentation of dvipdfm specifically mentions the limited availability of Lesenko's dvipdf {{as a reason}} for creating dvipdfm. dvipdfm supports most of the newer special functions of the PDF format, including bookmarks, annotations, thumbnails, and dvips specials—a feature making possible the inclusion of <b>Encapsulated</b> <b>PostScript</b> (.eps) files like METAPOST output—as well inclusion of JPEG and PNG images; other features of dvipdfm include partial font embedding (reducing file size) and balancing the internal PDF document trees to speed up rendering of large documents. Many of these features (except for the direct support for [...]eps files) are also present in pdfTeX, which typesets TeX directly to PDF. The 2004, 4th edition of the Guide to LaTeX compares them in the following way: ...|$|E
50|$|The 'Escape' {{mechanism}} in question allows applications (not metafiles) to access output device features not yet abstracted by GDI, such as hardware accelerated Bézier curves, <b>encapsulated</b> <b>postscript</b> support, etc. This {{is done by}} passing an opcode, a size and a pointer to some data to the call, which will usually just {{pass it on to}} the driver. Because most Escape calls produce actual graphics, the general escape mechanism is allowed in metafiles with little thought originally given to the possibility of using it for things like SETABORTPROC, modern non-vulnerable metafile interpreters now checks the opcode against a blacklist or whitelist, while keeping the full set of opcodes available to regular code that calls the GDI escape functions directly (because such code is already running {{in the same way as}} the code it could make GDI call, there is no security risk in that case).|$|E
5000|$|In {{contrast}} to the grid format of bitmap images, Vector graphics file formats use geometric modeling to describe an image {{as a series of}} points, lines, curves, and polygons. Because the image is described using geometric data instead of fixed pixels, the image can be scaled to any size while retaining [...] "resolution independence", meaning that the image can be printed at the highest resolution a printer supports, resulting in a clear, crisp image. Vector file formats are usually superior in resolution and ease of editing as compared to bitmap file formats, but are not as widely supported by software and are not well-suited for storing pixel-specific data such as scanned photographs. In the early years of electronic clip art, vector illustrations were limited to simple line art representations. However, by the early 2000s, vector illustration tools could produce virtually the same illustrations as bitmap illustration tools, while still providing all of the advantages of vector file formats. The most common vector file format is Adobe's EPS (<b>Encapsulated</b> <b>PostScript)</b> file format. Microsoft has a much simpler, less sophisticated vector file format called WMF (Windows Metafile). The World Wide Web Consortium has developed a new, XML-based vector file format called SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) and all major modern web browsers - including Mozilla Firefox, Internet Explorer 9, Google Chrome, Opera, and Safari have at least some degree of support for SVG and can render the markup directly. For those with image-editing experience or interest to work with vector file formats, vector clip art provides the most flexible, highest quality images.|$|E
40|$|The Holstein-Hubbard {{model is}} {{examined}} {{in the limit of}} infinite dimensions. Conventional folklore states that charge-density-wave (CDW) order is more strongly affected by Coulomb repulsion than superconducting order because of the pseudopotential effect. We find that both incommensurate CDW and superconducting phases are stabilized by the Coulomb repulsion, but, surprisingly, the commensurate CDW transition temperature is more robust than the superconducting transition temperature. This puzzling feature is resolved by a detailed analysis of perturbation theory. Comment: 13 pages in ReVTex including 3 <b>encapsulated</b> <b>postscript</b> files (embedded in the text).
