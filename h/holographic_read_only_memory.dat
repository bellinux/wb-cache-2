50|$|Electronic access card/Smart card - Smart card are credit card-sized plastic {{cards that}} house an {{embedded}} integrated circuit. They {{can be used}} in electronic commerce for providing personal security, stored value and mobility. At the functional level, smart cards can be categorised as either memory cards or microprocessor cards. Memory cards, such as disposable pre-paid payphone cards or loyalty card, are the most cheapest form of smart card. They contain a small amount of memory in the form of ROM (<b>read</b> <b>only</b> <b>memory)</b> and EEPROM (electrically erasable programmable <b>read</b> <b>only</b> <b>memory).</b> Microprocessor cards are more advanced than simple memory cards in that they contain a microprocessor CPU (central processing unit) and RAM (random access memory) in addition to ROM and EEPROM.

40|$|Abstract—Various code {{patterns}} of a via-programming <b>read</b> <b>only</b> <b>memory</b> (ROM) cause significant fluctuations in coupling noise between bitlines (BLs). This crosstalk between BLs leads to read failure in high-speed via-programmable ROMs and limits {{the coverage of}} applicable code patterns. This work presents a content-aware design framework (CADF) for via-programming ROMs to overcome the crosstalk induced read failure. The CADF ROMs employ a content-aware structure and correspondent code-structure programming algorithm {{to reduce the amount}} of coupling noise source while maintaining nonminimal BL load for crosstalk reduction. A 256 -Kb conventional ROM and a 256 -Kb CADF ROM were fabricated using a 0. 25 - m logic CMOS process. The measured results ascertain that the read induced read failure is suppressed significantly by CADF. The CADF ROM also reduced 86. 2 % and 94. 5 % in power consumption and standby current compared to the conventional ROM, respectively.
