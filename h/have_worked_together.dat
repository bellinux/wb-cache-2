5|$|Icelandics were {{exported}} to Great Britain before the 20th century {{to work as}} pit ponies in the coal mines, because of their strength and small size. However, those horses were never registered and little evidence of their existence remains. The first formal exports of Icelandic horses were to Germany in the 1940s. Great Britain's first official imports were in 1956, when a Scottish farmer, Stuart McKintosh, began a breeding program. Other breeders in Great Britain followed McKintosh's lead, and the Icelandic Horse Society of Great Britain was formed in 1986. The number of Icelandic horses {{exported to}} other nations has steadily increased since the first exports of the mid-19th century. Since 1969, multiple societies <b>have</b> <b>worked</b> <b>together</b> to preserve, improve and market these horses {{under the auspices of}} the International Federation of Icelandic Horse Associations.

25|$|In recent years, drug {{companies}} <b>have</b> <b>worked</b> <b>together</b> to combine these complex regimens into simpler formulas, termed fixed-dose combinations. For instance, {{there are now}} several options that combine 3 or 4 drugs into one pill taken once daily. This greatly increases {{the ease with which}} they can be taken, which in turn increases the consistency with which medication is taken (adherence), and thus their effectiveness over the long-term. Not taking anti-retrovirals regularly is a cause of resistance development in people who have started taking them previously. Patients who take medications regularly can stay on one regimen without developing resistance. This greatly increases life expectancy and leaves more drugs available to the individual should the need arise.|$|E
