5|$|Holographic {{interferometry}} is {{a technique}} which uses holography to monitor small deformations in single wavelength implementations.

5|$|Lieberman Aiden {{contributed to}} the {{founding}} of evolutionary graph theory along with his PhD supervisor Martin Nowak. He has since been involved in researching the three <b>dimensional</b> structure {{of the human genome}} and the field of culturomics.|$|E
5|$|The {{equivalence}} {{of measurement}} of energy {{per unit area}} to force per unit length can be proven by <b>dimensional</b> analysis.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} {{is centered}} mostly around puzzle solving, with action-RPG gameplay elements, similar to previous Kingdom Hearts games. Mini-games and platforming are also featured, with three <b>dimensional</b> backgrounds and two <b>dimensional</b> characters. In mid-2007, game director Tetsuya Nomura {{decided to create}} a Kingdom Hearts spin-off for mobile phones {{that would have a}} different gameplay style than previous titles and allow players to explore the game like a playground. The game was originally released in eight parts and one preview to mobile phone gamers from June 2009 to January 2010. To reach a wider audience, it was remade for the Nintendo DS and released internationally.|$|E

25|$|The {{most basic}} rule of <b>dimensional</b> {{analysis}} {{is that of}} <b>dimensional</b> homogeneity. Only commensurable quantities (physical quantities having the same dimension) may be compared, equated, added, or subtracted.|$|E
25|$|The form of F {{can be used}} {{to predict}} which terms are most {{important}} by <b>dimensional</b> analysis. <b>Dimensional</b> analysis is not completely straightforward, because the scaling of H needs to be determined.|$|E
25|$|As can be seen, {{when the}} <b>dimensional</b> units {{appearing}} in the numerator and denominator of the equation's right hand side are cancelled out, {{both sides of the}} equation have the same <b>dimensional</b> units.|$|E
25|$|Two <b>dimensional</b> {{correlation}} analysis is a mathematical technique {{that is used}} to study changes in measured signals. As mostly spectroscopic signals are discussed, sometime also two <b>dimensional</b> correlation spectroscopy is used and refers to the same technique.|$|E
25|$|In finance, economics, and accounting, <b>dimensional</b> {{analysis}} is most {{commonly referred to}} {{in terms of the}} distinction between stocks and flows. More generally, <b>dimensional</b> {{analysis is}} used in interpreting various financial ratios, economics ratios, and accounting ratios.|$|E
25|$|Two <b>dimensional</b> {{terminal}} singularities are smooth.|$|E
25|$|Similarly, {{while one}} can {{evaluate}} monomials (x'n) of <b>dimensional</b> quantities, one cannot evaluate polynomials of mixed degree with dimensionless coefficients on <b>dimensional</b> quantities: for x2, the expression (3m)2=9m2 makes sense (as an area), while for x2+x, the expression (3m)2+3m=9m2+3m {{does not make}} sense.|$|E
25|$|For {{manifolds}} of dimension at most 6, any {{piecewise linear}} (PL) structure can be smoothed in an essentially unique way, so {{in particular the}} theory of 4 <b>dimensional</b> PL manifolds {{is much the same}} as the theory of 4 <b>dimensional</b> smooth manifolds.|$|E
25|$|Wood drying may be {{described}} as the art of ensuring that gross <b>dimensional</b> changes through shrinkage are confined to the drying process. Ideally, wood is dried to that equilibrium moisture content as will later (in service) be attained by the wood. Thus, further <b>dimensional</b> change will be kept to a minimum.|$|E
25|$|<b>Dimensional</b> {{tolerances}} are not {{closer than}} necessary.|$|E
25|$|A <b>dimensional</b> {{equation}} {{can have}} the dimensions reduced or eliminated through nondimensionalization, which begins with <b>dimensional</b> analysis, and involves scaling quantities by characteristic units of a system or natural units of nature. This gives insight into the fundamental properties of the system, as illustrated in the examples below.|$|E
25|$|There are infinite-dimensional analogues {{of general}} linear groups, {{orthogonal}} groups, and so on. One important aspect {{is that these}} may have simpler topological properties: see for example Kuiper's theorem. In M-theory, for example, a 10 <b>dimensional</b> SU(N) gauge theory becomes an 11 <b>dimensional</b> theory when N becomes infinite.|$|E

25|$|<b>Dimensional</b> terms: {{the first}} <b>dimensional</b> {{adjectives}} acquired are {{big and small}} because they belong to the size category. The size category is the most general one. Later children acquire the single dimension adjectives, such as, tall-short, long-short, high-low. Eventually they acquire the adjectives that describe the secondary dimension, such as thick-thin, wide-narrow and deep-shallow.|$|E

25|$|Protein {{secondary}} structure is the three <b>dimensional</b> form of local segments of proteins. The two most common secondary structural elements are alpha helices and beta sheets, though beta turns and omega loops occur as well. Secondary structure elements typically spontaneously form {{as an intermediate}} before the protein folds into its three <b>dimensional</b> tertiary structure.|$|E

25|$|While most {{mathematical}} identities about dimensionless numbers translate in {{a straightforward}} manner to <b>dimensional</b> quantities, {{care must be}} taken with logarithms of ratios: the identity log(a/b) = log a − log b, where the logarithm is taken in any base, holds for dimensionless numbers a and b, but it does not hold if a and b are <b>dimensional,</b> because in this case the left-hand side is well-defined but the right-hand side is not.|$|E
25|$|Dummy head mics were {{utilized}} for Blood Covered, Book of Shadows, and Blood Drive to provide perceived three <b>dimensional</b> sound.|$|E
25|$|The {{speed of}} light is a <b>dimensional</b> {{quantity}} and so, as has been emphasized in this context by João Magueijo, it cannot be measured. Measurable quantities in physics are, without exception, dimensionless, although they are often constructed as ratios of <b>dimensional</b> quantities. For example, when {{the height of a}} mountain is measured, what is really measured is the ratio of its height to the length of a meter stick. The conventional SI system of units is based on seven basic <b>dimensional</b> quantities, namely distance, mass, time, electric current, thermodynamic temperature, amount of substance, and luminous intensity. These units are defined to be independent and so cannot be described in terms of each other. As an alternative to using a particular system of units, one can reduce all measurements to dimensionless quantities expressed in terms of ratios between the quantities being measured and various fundamental constants such as Newton's constant, the {{speed of light}} and Planck's constant; physicists can define at least 26 dimensionless constants which can be expressed in terms of these sorts of ratios and which are currently thought to be independent of one another. By manipulating the basic <b>dimensional</b> constants one can also construct the Planck time, Planck length and Planck energy which make a good system of units for expressing <b>dimensional</b> measurements, known as Planck units.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} sizing systems for these punches. The two most common are those sized for {{standard}} electrical knockout sizes {{and those that}} are for true <b>dimensional</b> holes. A 3/4 inch conduit size punch actually punches a hole that is approximately 1.1 inches diameter for 3/4 nominal size conduit. A <b>dimensional</b> size punch makes a hole very close to the indicated size. Punch sets are available on both imperial and metric sizes.|$|E
25|$|Nanomaterials can be {{classified}} in 0D, 1D, 2D and 3D nanomaterials. The dimensionality {{play a major role}} in determining the characteristic of nanomaterials including , chemical and biological characteristics. With the decrease in dimensionality, an increase in surface-to-volume ratio is observed. This indicate that smaller <b>dimensional</b> nanomaterials have higher surface area compared to 3D nanomaterials. Recently, two <b>dimensional</b> (2D) nanomaterials are extensively investigated for electronic, biomedical, drug delivery and biosensor applications.|$|E
