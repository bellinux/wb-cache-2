50|$|From 1568 to 1569 {{the former}} {{church on the}} main square was {{transformed}} into the city's town hall by implementing an <b>intermediate</b> <b>ceiling.</b> In the first floor the Marienkapelle was built. The cabinetmaker Jakob Barth of Retz was working for over 30 years on the carvings.|$|E
50|$|It {{was built}} in 1972 as {{replacement}} for a smaller telecommunication tower, built in 1952. After {{the construction of the}} Hünenburg Telecommunication Tower, the old telecommunication tower was rebuilt into an observation tower, whereby the antenna decks were removed and some <b>intermediate</b> <b>ceilings</b> were installed. Today, it is called the Hünenburg Observation Tower and houses a museum with its history and the history of Hünenburg Telecommunication Tower and a restaurant.|$|R
50|$|After 1028, the Greek monk Simeon {{lived as}} a hermit {{in the ruins}} of the Porta Nigra. After his death (1035) and sanctification, the Simeonstift monastery was built next to the Porta Nigra to honor him. To save it from further destruction, the Porta Nigra was {{transformed}} into a church: the inner court of the gate was roofed and <b>intermediate</b> <b>ceilings</b> were inserted. The two middle storeys of the former gate were converted into church naves: the upper storey being for the monks and the lower storey for the general public. The ground floor with the large gates was sealed, and a large outside staircase was constructed alongside the south side (the town side) of the gate, up to the lower storey of the church. A small staircase led further up to the upper storey. The church rooms were accessible through former windows of the western tower of the Porta Nigra that were enlarged to become entrance doors (still visible today). The top floor of the western tower was used as church tower, the eastern tower was leveled, and an apse added at its east side. An additional gate (the much smaller Simeon Gate) was built adjacent to the East side of the Porta Nigra and served as a city gate in medieval times.|$|R
30|$|The ThermalZone {{objects are}} {{separated}} {{from each other and}} from the environment by ThermalBoundary objects, which are assumed to be planar or quasi-planar surfaces. Each ThermalZone is geometrically closed by its whole set of bounding ThermalBoundary objects (relation boundedBy). On the other hand, a ThermalBoundary object must refer to one (boundary between a ThermalZone object and the building environment) or two corresponding ThermalZone objects via the ordered relation delimits. In the case a ThermalBoundary object separates two adjacent ThermalZone objects, actually corresponding to an <b>intermediate</b> floor, <b>ceiling,</b> interior or shared wall, its geometrical representation coincides with the plane lying at the middle of the construction thickness.|$|R
40|$|The {{change from}} an <b>intermediate</b> mission (cost <b>ceiling</b> of $ 300 million) to a solar-terrestrial probe class mission (cost ceiling of $ 150 million) will require some {{major changes in}} the {{configuration}} of the IMI mission. One option being considered is to move to a small spin-stabilized spacecraft (with no despun platform) which could be launched with a smaller Taurus or Conestoga class booster. Such a change in spacecraft type would not present any fundamental problems (other than restrictions on mass and power) for the He plus 304 A plasmasphere imager, the high and low energy neutral atom imagers, and the geocoronal imager, but would present a challenge for the FUV auroral imager since the original plan called for this instrument to operate from a despun platform. Since the FUV instrument is part of the core payload it cannot be dropped from the instrument complement without jeopardizing the science goals of the mission. A way must be found to keep this instrument and to allow it to accomplish most, if not all, of its science objectives. One of the subjects discussed are options for building an FUV instrument for a spinning spacecraft. Since a number of spinning spacecraft have carried auroral imagers, a range of techniques exists. In addition, the option of flying the FUV imager on a separate micro-satellite launched with the main IMI spacecraft or with a separate pegasus launch, was considered and is discussed...|$|R
