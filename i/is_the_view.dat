5|$|Agnosticism <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>view</b> {{that the}} {{existence}} of God, of the divine or the supernatural is unknown or unknowable.|$|E
5|$|Ignosticism <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>view</b> that a {{coherent}} {{definition of a}} deity must be put forward before {{the question of the}} existence of a deity can be meaningfully discussed. If the chosen definition is not coherent, the ignostic holds the noncognitivist view that the existence of a deity is meaningless or empirically untestable.|$|E
5|$|Interactionist dualism, {{or simply}} interactionism, is the {{particular}} form of dualism first espoused by Descartes in the Meditations. In the 20th century, its major defenders have been Karl Popper and John Carew Eccles. It <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>view</b> that mental states, such as beliefs and desires, causally interact with physical states.|$|E

5|$|Non-reductive Physicalism <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>view</b> {{that mental}} {{properties}} form a separate ontological class to physical properties: mental states (such as qualia) are not reducible to physical states. The ontological stance towards qualia {{in the case}} of non-reductive physicalism does not imply that qualia are causally inert; this is what distinguishes it from epiphenomenalism.|$|E
5|$|Many {{contemporary}} Orthodox scholars {{rule that}} the area {{in front of the}} Wall has the status of a synagogue and must be treated with due respect. This <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>view</b> upheld by the authority in charge of the wall. As such, men and married women are expected to cover their heads upon approaching the Wall, and to dress appropriately. When departing, the custom is to walk backwards away from the Wall. On Saturdays, it is forbidden to enter the area with electronic devices, including cameras, which infringe on the sanctity of the Sabbath.|$|E
5|$|Occasionalism <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>view</b> {{espoused by}} Nicholas Malebranche that asserts that all {{supposedly}} causal relations between physical events, or between {{physical and mental}} events, are not really causal at all. While body and mind are different substances, causes (whether mental or physical) are related to their effects {{by an act of}} God's intervention on each specific occasion.|$|E

5|$|Panpsychism <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>view</b> {{that all}} matter has a mental aspect, or, alternatively, all objects have a unified center of {{experience}} or point of view. Superficially, {{it seems to}} be a form of property dualism, since it regards everything as having both mental and physical properties. However, some panpsychists say mechanical behaviour is derived from primitive mentality of atoms and molecules—as are sophisticated mentality and organic behaviour, the difference being attributed to the presence or absence of complex structure in a compound object. So long as the reduction of non-mental properties to mental ones is in place, panpsychism is not a (strong) form of property dualism; otherwise it is.|$|E
5|$|Being a scientist, {{above all}} else, Huxley {{presented}} agnosticism {{as a form}} of demarcation. A hypothesis with no supporting objective, testable evidence is not an objective, scientific claim. As such, there would be no way to test said hypotheses, leaving the results inconclusive. His agnosticism was not compatible with forming a belief as to the truth, or falsehood, of the claim at hand. Karl Popper would also describe himself as an agnostic. According to philosopher William L. Rowe, in this strict sense, agnosticism <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>view</b> that human reason is incapable of providing sufficient rational grounds to justify either the belief that God exists or the belief that God does not exist.|$|E
5|$|Eliminativism about a {{class of}} {{entities}} <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>view</b> that that class of entities does not exist. For example, materialism tends to be eliminativist about the soul; modern chemists are eliminativist about phlogiston; and modern physicists are eliminativist {{about the existence of}} luminiferous aether. Eliminative materialism is the relatively new (1960s–1970s) idea that certain classes of mental entities that common sense takes for granted, such as beliefs, desires, and the subjective sensation of pain, do not exist. The most common versions are eliminativism about propositional attitudes, as expressed by Paul and Patricia Churchland,and eliminativism about qualia (subjective interpretations about particular instances of subjective experience), as expressed by Daniel Dennett and Georges Rey. These philosophers often appeal to an introspection illusion.|$|E

25|$|As a {{religious}} position, some describe pantheism as the polar opposite of atheism. From this standpoint, pantheism <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>view</b> {{that everything is}} part of an all-encompassing, immanent God. All forms of reality may then be considered either modes of that Being, or identical with it. Some hold that pantheism is a non-religious philosophical position. To them, pantheism <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>view</b> that the Universe (in the sense of the totality of all existence) and God are identical (implying a denial of the personality and transcendence of God).|$|E
