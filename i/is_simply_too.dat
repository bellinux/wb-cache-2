To compensate, another two layers are added on, outside the first three. These layers have a lower refractive index than the centre layers, and hence confine the light effectively. Such a design is called a separate confinement heterostructure (SCH) laser diode.|$|E

25|$|Though {{there is}} no doubt that the {{demographic}} crisis of the 14th century caused a dramatic fall in production and commerce in absolute terms, there has been a vigorous historical debate over whether the decline was greater than the fall in population. While the older orthodoxy held that the artistic output of the Renaissance was a result of greater opulence, more recent studies have suggested that there might have been a so-called 'depression of the Renaissance'. In spite of convincing arguments for the case, the statistical evidence <b>is</b> <b>simply</b> <b>too</b> incomplete for a definite conclusion to be made.|$|E

500|$|A common {{objection}} to evolution {{is that it}} <b>is</b> <b>simply</b> <b>too</b> unlikely for life, in its complexity and apparent [...] "design," [...] to have arisen [...] "by chance." [...] It is argued that the odds of life having arisen without a deliberate intelligence guiding it are so astronomically low that it is unreasonable not to infer an intelligent designer from the natural world, and specifically from the diversity of life. A more extreme version of this argument is that evolution cannot create complex structures (see the Creation of complex structures section below). The idea that it <b>is</b> <b>simply</b> <b>too</b> implausible for life to have evolved is often wrongly encapsulated with a quotation that the [...] "probability of life originating on Earth is no greater than the chance that a hurricane, sweeping through a scrapyard, would have the luck to assemble a Boeing 747"—a claim attributed to astrophysicist Fred Hoyle and known as Hoyle's fallacy. Hoyle was a Darwinist, atheist and anti-theist, but advocated the theory of panspermia, in which abiogenesis begins in outer space and primitive life on Earth is held to have arrived via natural dispersion.|$|E

That night Peter goes to Lincoln's office as Spider-Man {{to find out if the}} rumors are true.

500|$|According to Levine and Jim Farber of the New York Daily News, [...] "Only Girl (In the World)" [...] was Rihanna's most pop-sounding song since [...] "Don't Stop the Music". Analyzing the song, the BBC's Fraser McAlpine {{questioned}} why [...] "Only Girl (In the World)" [...] {{leaves a}} [...] "positive impression" [...] on the listener despite its arrogant, domineering tone. Critical at first ("Listen to the pneumatic hiss {{at the heart}} of this song. Try and endure the pumping thrust without getting winded. There <b>is</b> <b>simply</b> <b>too</b> much pressure being stuffed into our ears, with too much brutal force"), he concluded that Rihanna sings the song with great passion and gave it four stars out of five. James Dolan gave the song two-and-a-half stars out of five in Rolling Stone, writing that [...] "the trance beat won't keep you in the club unless someone else is paying for the drinks." ...|$|E

500|$|Nick De Semlyen of the UK film {{magazine}} Empire had criticisms, even while giving the film four of five stars. Finding it [...] "a swinging caper with wit, balls, heart and exploding baubles," [...] {{he said the}} villainous [...] "super-soldiers who can regenerate body parts and survive astounding damage [...] visually interesting ... but their motivation is murky and unconvincing." [...] Likewise Joshua Rothkopf of Time Out New York bestowed 3 of 5 stars, saying, [...] "Black has massively upped the verbal sparring and kept the broad inventiveness of comic-book malleability in mind. ... The most wonderful of Black's surprises harkens back to his '80s reputation for character revision and <b>is</b> <b>simply</b> <b>too</b> good to ruin here." [...] But, he asked, [...] "hy, finally, are we down at the docks—in the dark, no less—for one of those lumbering climaxes involving swinging shipping cranes?

500|$|Arguing for {{the renewal}} of the series for a third season {{following}} its low viewership, Ryan said that [...] "letting the show die would be a serious mistake, for the network and for the bigger Disney-ABC conglomerate...These days, entertainment properties have to be viewed not just {{through the lens of}} their ratings (admittedly weak for Agent Carter). They have to be evaluated {{within the context of the}} overall value they bring to any entertainment colossus, and what Agent Carter adds to Disney-ABC <b>is</b> <b>simply</b> <b>too</b> valuable to give up... something different to the company's superhero portfolio." [...] She suggested if ABC did not renew the series for broadcast, that it should explore other opportunities, such as debuting on its online Watch ABC app, or being sold to Netflix, where [...] "fans of super-heroic storytelling already flock to" [...] and Agent Carters [...] "status as a period piece—which may have harmed it on broadcast—could be a real draw for Netflix viewers". Ryan also felt Marvel [...] "could copy what CBS is [...] " [...] by creating a subscription service for a monthly fee, where consumers could access Marvel's films and televisions shows [...] "as well as premium exclusives like a third season of Agent Carter". Ryan concluded, [...] "A third Agent Carter season could help solidify Marvel's standing not just with female fans, but with everyone who appreciates excellent and adventurous storytelling." ...|$|E
500|$|Eastwood married Margaret Neville [...] "Maggie" [...] Johnson (born 1931; {{then working}} for an auto parts {{suppliers}} company) on December 19, 1953 in Pasadena. They had met {{six months earlier}} {{on a blind date}} in Los Angeles, although Eastwood subsequently had a serious relationship in Seattle that summer with a young woman who became pregnant with his child—an alleged daughter who was given up for adoption, per biographer Patrick McGilligan—before Johnson announced her engagement to him in October. The marriage would not prove altogether smooth. [...] "He thought they were too young, not well enough established," [...] remarked biographer Richard Schickel in the only authorized book ever written about Eastwood. A decade later, an ongoing affair Eastwood was involved in (said to have lasted 14 years) with dancer and Rawhide stuntwoman Roxanne Tunis (who was also married yet separated) produced his earliest verified child, daughter Kimber Eastwood (born Kimber Tunis; June 17, 1964), whose existence was kept secret from the public until July 1989, when the National Enquirer revealed her identity. Biographer Marc Eliot wrote of Johnson, [...] "It is difficult to say for sure that she actually knew about the baby, although it would have been nearly impossible for her not to. Everyone on the set knew ... and it <b>is</b> <b>simply</b> <b>too</b> difficult to keep a secret like that when the mother and the illegitimate child live in the same small town, especially when that small town is Hollywood." [...] The source for the 1989 Enquirer article that originally broke the story claimed Johnson was aware of Kimber's existence at all times and even met Roxanne Tunis in person when making an unannounced visit to the set of Breezy in 1972. Actress Barbara Eden, a onetime Rawhide guest star and witness to the affair with Tunis, said of Eastwood's relationship with Johnson: [...] "They conducted a somewhat open marriage." ...|$|E

500|$|Homer {{decides not to}} {{tell his}} family and pretends {{to go to work}} every day, {{although}} he is actually just going to the local Krusty Burger. The next day, Bart's class stops at the Krusty Burger after a field trip and Bart is shocked to discover Homer sitting at a booth alone. Homer comes clean and explains to Bart that his job interview did not go so well when his interviewer, the Rich Texan, discovered that Homer knows nothing about copper tubing. Bart convinces Homer that he should tell Marge what has happened and Homer calls her from a pay phone. But when Homer hears Marge’s happy voice he cannot bring himself to disappoint her and tell her the truth about his [...] "new" [...] job. Instead he concocts a story about him having to fly on the [...] "company" [...] jet for work and instructs Marge to meet him at the airport in an hour. Homer pays a Marine to fly him into the air, so he can tell Marge up in the air with luxury so she would not get upset. Once in the air, Marge cannot believe all the luxuries the private jet has to offer. Homer sits Marge down to tell her the truth, but just before he can, the plane endures turbulence. Homer and Marge head into the cockpit to see what the problem is, only to discover that the pilot had passed out. Homer shoves the pilot aside and takes hold of the jet’s controls. As the jet is about to hit the ocean, Marge pulls the jet's yoke up giving the jet altitude. Marge pulls out her cell phone and calls Colby Kraus and frantically asks for his guidance. Thanks to Colby's motivation, Homer manages to land the plane safely on the ground, however, his attempt to taxi back to the terminal fails and the plane falls into the ocean. After being airlifted out of the plane, Homer explains to Marge that flying in private jets <b>is</b> <b>simply</b> <b>too</b> dangerous and that he plans {{to go back to work}} at the Power Plant.|$|E
