The more extensive the subcortical heterotopia, the greater the deficit; bilateral heterotopia are almost invariably associated with severe developmental delay or mental retardation. The cortex itself often suffers from an absence of gray matter and may be unusually thin or lack deep sulci. Subependymal heterotopia are frequently accompanied by other structural abnormalities, including an overall decrease in cortical mass.

40|$|Previous reports {{indicate}} that in utero knockdown of doublecortin (DCX) results in the genesis of a <b>subcortical</b> <b>heterotopia</b> reminiscent of the doublecortex observed in female patients with DCX mutations.

Neuroradiologists classify heterotopias on MRI by location and appearance into three types: subependymal, subcortical and band types. Signs of subependymal heterotopia on CUS include ventricular wall irregularity, hyperechoic periventricular band and isolated hyperechoic periventricular nodules protruding into the ventricle. They are rarely associated with cortical lesions. CUS signs of <b>subcortical</b> <b>heterotopia</b> include abnormal hyperechoic regions in the white matter.

40|$|X-linked {{isolated}} lissencephaly {{sequence and}} <b>subcortical</b> band <b>heterotopia</b> are allelic human disorders associated with mutations of doublecortin (DCX), giving both familial and sporadic forms. DCX encodes a microtubule-associated protein involved in neuronal migration during brain development. Structural {{data show that}} mutations can fall either in surface residues, likely to impair partner interactions, or in buried residues, likely to impair protein stability. Despite the progress in understanding the molecular basis of these disorders, the prognosis value of the location and impact of individual DCX mutations has largely remained unclear. To clarify this point, we investigated a cohort of 180 patients who were referred with the agyria–pachygyria <b>subcortical</b> band <b>heterotopia</b> spectrum. DCX mutations were identified in 136 individuals. Analysis of the parents’ DNA revealed the de novo occurrence of DCX mutations in 76 cases [62 of 70 females screened (88. 5 %) and 14 of 60 males screened (23 %) ], whereas in the remaining cases, mutations were inherited from asymptomatic (n = 14) or symptomatic mothers (n = 11). This represents 100 % of families screened. Female patients with DCX mutation demonstrated three degrees of clinical–radiological severity: a severe form with a thick band (n = 54), a milder form (n = 24) with either an anterior thin or an intermediate thickness band and asymptomatic carrier females (n = 14) with normal magnetic resonance imaging results. A higher proportion of nonsense and frameshift mutations were identified in patients with de novo mutations. An analysis of predicted effects of missense mutations showed that those destabilizing {{the structure of the}} protein were often associated with more severe phenotypes. We identified several severe- and mild-effect mutations affecting surface residues and observed that the substituted amino acid is also critical in determining severity. Recurrent mutations representing 34. 5 % of all DCX mutations often lead to similar phenotypes, for example, either severe in sporadic <b>subcortical</b> band <b>heterotopia</b> owing to Arg 186 mutations or milder in familial cases owing to Arg 196 mutations. Taken as a whole, these observations demonstrate that DCX-related disorders are clinically heterogeneous, with severe sporadic and milder familial <b>subcortical</b> band <b>heterotopia,</b> each associated with specific DCX mutations.

40|$|Disorders of {{neuronal}} migration are {{a heterogeneous}} group of disorders of nervous system development. One {{of the most}} frequent disorders is lissencephaly characterized by a paucity of normal gyri and sulci resulting in a "smooth brain". There are two pathologic subtypes: classical and cobblestone. Classical lissencephaly results from an arrest of neuronal migration, whereas cobblestone lissencephaly results from overmigration. Another important neuronal migration disorder is heterotopia characterized by a cluster of normal neurons in abnormal locations and it {{is divided into three}} main groups: periventricular nodular <b>heterotopia,</b> <b>subcortical</b> <b>heterotopia</b> and marginal glioneural heterotopia. Polymicrogyria develops at the last stages of neuronal migration to the earliest phases of cortical organization; bilateral frontoparietal form is characterized by bilateral, symmetric polymicrogyria in the frontoparietal regions. Bilateral perisylvian polymicrogyria results in a clinical syndrome manifested by mild mental retardation, epilepsy and pseudobulbar palsy.
