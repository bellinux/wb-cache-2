40|$|In {{relation}} {{to the events of}} the current Ebola outbreak in West Africa, the European Commission requested EFSA to identify the drivers for occasional spillover event of Ebola virus, i. e. the transmission from animals to humans. As part of this work SciencesPo was contracted by EFSA to perform an analysis to visualise and communicate the drivers for spillover of Ebola virus. Based on information available in the peer-reviewed scientific literature, a set of drivers for spillover of infectious diseases was identified and a set of scientific studies was used to structure a corpus of relevant arguments. This corpus was used to analyse the driver network and visualise the driver behaviour. The analysis led to the identification of 40 drivers, connected through 142 linkages. The visualisation of the driver network showed that central drivers involved in spillover are 'Hunting', 'Deforestation/forest fragmentation', and 'Demographic changes of wildlife'. The most frequent <b>driver</b> <b>links</b> identified were 'Deforestation/forest fragmentation' leading to 'Ecosystem changes' and 'Livelihoods resilience' leading to 'Hunting'. Different publication biases may affect this methodology, therefore the findings reported should be interpreted as a representation of the current view of the scientific community on Ebola virus spillover, rather than a comprehensive analysis of drivers of spillover. The methodology used in this report demonstrates a more structured and transparent approach to analysing drivers for infectious diseases. Such visualisations help in apprehending and analysing the whole system, which is complex in nature since it involves bio-ecological, technical, political and socio-economic aspects. Furthermore the understanding of environmental, epidemiological and social factors that lead to such an outbreak may help to prevent future ones...|$|E

40|$|<b>Link</b> <b>driver</b> concept {{proposed}} by Hilderink is very useful for embedded control application. The reason {{lies on the}} fact that one can use the same program in different platform by changing hardware dependent part only. This feature is in the Communicating Threads (CT) Library developed by Control Engineering group, University of Twente, the Netherlands. Therefore, it is necessary to write <b>link</b> <b>drivers</b> for all peripheral in a microcontroller. This paper discusses the implementation of peripheral <b>link</b> <b>drivers</b> for ADSP- 21992, 16 -bit fixed point DSP from Analog Devices, Inc. The chosen perihperals are Analog to Digital Converter (ADC), Auxiliary Pulse Width Modulation (AuxPWM) and Encoder Interfaace Unit (EIU).

According to the {{situation}} that the transistor output interface type of PLC output current {{is too small to}} meet requirements of high-speed, frequently on or off electromagnetic valve and other great current load drives, a current driver amplifier was developed which connected PLC output interface and load. Its key realization technologies include signal acquisition input, bidirectional conducting, input and output display, and designs of isolation circuit of input and output and output amplification processing circuit. The device uses bidirectional optocoupler and bidirectional LED to gather small DC current signal which does not distinguish between positive and negative polarities and achieve photoelectric isolation, controls drive load work of MOS transistor conducting and achieves current amplification through amplification <b>driver</b> <b>link</b> of emitter output, and has high frequently on-off operation, simple wiring, great drive current, strong versatility, high reliability and other characteristics...|$|R

40|$|Traditional {{operating}} systems use magnetic disks as paging devices, {{even though the}} cost of a disk transfer measured in processor cycles continues to increase. In this paper we explore the use of remote main memory for paging. We describe the design, implementation and evaluation of a pager that uses main memory of remote workstations as a faster-than-disk paging device and provides reliability in case of single workstation failures. Our pager has been implemented as a block device <b>driver</b> <b>linked</b> to the DEC OSF/ 1 operating system, without any modi cations to the kernel code. Using several test applications we measure the performance of remote memory paging over an Ethernet interconnection network and nd it to be faster than traditional disk paging. We evaluate the performance of various reliability policies and prove their feasibilityeven over low bandwidth networks, like Ethernet. We conclude that the bene ts of reliable remote memory paging in workstation clusters are signi cant today and will probably increase in the near future...|$|R

40|$|This paper’s {{contribution}} to research {{on food and}} social justice or food justice is threefold. Firstly the paper considers how the processes that shape urban space {{also contribute to the}} production of food injustice. This intervention pushes the food justice literature to consider how contextual <b>drivers</b> <b>linked</b> to urban governance are key forces that shape access to food in cities. The second contribution critiques the current emphasis on race-based disadvantage and white privilege by considering how racism as an aspect of food injustice can have shifting influence. Finally, the vast majority of food justice research focuses on the United States, which goes some way toward explaining why race and white privilege play such an important role in current explanations. This paper draws on the context of Hong Kong to highlight how the ways in which place-making projects shift over time and how these spatial projects impact on food injustice. These three research interventions extend the concept and applicability of food justice to make it a more international concept, {{while at the same time}} open the concept out to new groups of people who also struggle to feed themselves...|$|R

40|$|Land use {{change is}} the most {{significant}} <b>driver</b> <b>linked</b> to global species extinctions. In Northern Australia, the landscape is still relatively intact with very low levels of clearing. However, a re-energized political discourse around creating a northern food bowl means that currently intact ecosystems in northern Australia could be under imminent threat from increased land clearing and water extraction. These impacts are likely to be concentrated in a few regions with suitable soils and water supplies. The Daly River Catchment in the Northern Territory is an important catchment for both conservation and development. Land use in the Daly catchment has been subject to clearing guidelines that are largely untested in terms of their eventual implications for the spatial configuration of conservation and development. Given the guidelines are not legislated they might also be removed or revised by subsequent Territory Governments, including the recently-elected one. We examine the uncertainties around the spatial implications of full implementation of the Daly clearing guidelines and their potential effects on equity of opportunity across land tenures and land uses. We also examine how removal of the guidelines could affect conservation in the catchment. We conclude that the guidelines are important in supporting development in the catchment while still achieving conservation goals, and we recommend ways of implementing th...|$|R

40|$|This project elaborates <b>link</b> <b>drivers</b> for the ADSP- 21992. They are <b>link</b> <b>drivers</b> for Analog to Digital Converter (ADC), Encoder Interface Unit (EIU), Auxiliary PWM and the Control Area Network (CAN) bus. All <b>link</b> <b>drivers</b> {{are derived}} from the {{abstract}} LinkDriver class available in the CT Library. These <b>link</b> <b>drivers</b> are applied to a DC motor speed control with the PID Controller. This project will use two ADSP- 21992 EZ-KIT LITE boards (evaluation board). There are two configurations, i. e. one-way and two-way configurations. For the one-way configuration, board 1 reads reference signal (from ADCLinkDriver) and actual speed (from EIULinkDriver) then send the difference between those two to board 2 via CAN bus (CANLinkDriver). Before sending this data to board 2, board 1 send synchronization pulse to board 2 to write PWM value. Upon receiving this data, board 2 calculates the PID Controller output, then wait for synchronization pulse from board 1. There is only one communication between two boards. For the two-way configuration, board 1 reads value from ADC and encoder, actuates the PWM by writing PWM value and sends the difference between reference signal and actual speed as in one-way configuration. The process on board 2 is almost {{the same as in}} the one-way configuration, except the result is not written to PWM but to CAN bus. The main issue is the highest sampling frequency for each configuration. The sampling frequency also depends on the CAN speed. Therefore, this is presented based on the CAN speed. From the experiment, it can be concluded that sampling frequency depends on the CAN speed. The relationship between CAN speed and sampling frequency is not linear. This {{is due to the fact}} that reading data from ADC and EIU (encoder) do not depend on CAN speed...|$|R

40|$|The {{workplace}} has {{a direct}} impact on the physical, psychological, economic and social well-being of the workers. A healthy workplace leads to increased health among the employees which also makes the employees more productive (Källestål, 2004). A poor working environment can have negative consequences for individuals, companies and society (SOU, 2009 : 47). This is a qualitative study that investigates companies’ view of health promotion and how they practice health promotion in working life. Five private and five public companies, with representatives from the management were interviewed. The result showed that the companies looked at health promotion as means to support and create opportunities for the health of the employees. Ergonomics and work environment were the main <b>drivers</b> <b>linked</b> to health promotion. All companies had efforts for health promotion and the foremost was health care contributions which were offered annually. However, it appeared that few workers took advantage of it. Leadership proved to be very important for a healthy workplace. The companies´ visions for health promotion were that they would be an attractive workplace and that they wanted the employees to feel good at work. This was important because the companies wanted to benefit the business as well as the workers. The result agrees well with the literature, but it was unexpected that the companies would have such a broad view of health and health promotion...|$|R

40|$|Global {{climate change}} affects marine fish through drivers such as ocean warming, {{acidification}} and oxygen depletion, causing changes in marine ecosystems and socioeconomic impacts. While experimental and observational results can inform about anticipated effects of different <b>drivers,</b> <b>linking</b> between these results and ecosystem-level changes requires quantitative integration of physiological and ecological processes into models to advance research and inform management. We give {{an overview of}} important physiological and ecological processes affected by environmental drivers. We then provide a review of available modelling approaches for marine fish, analysing their capacities for process-based integration of environmental drivers. Building on this, we propose approaches to advance important research questions. Examples of integration of environmental drivers exist for each model class. Recent extensions of modelling frameworks increase the potential for including detailed mechanisms and improving model projections. Experimental results on energy allocation, behaviour and physiological limitations will advance the understanding of organism-level trade-offs and thresholds in response to multiple drivers. More explicit representation of life cycles and biological traits can improve description of population dynamics and adaptation, and data on food web topology and feeding interactions help to detail the conditions for possible regime shifts. Identification of relevant processes will also benefit the coupling of different models to investigate spatial–temporal changes in stock productivity and integrated responses of social–ecological systems. Thus, a more process-informed foundation for models will promote the integration of experimental and observational results and increase the potential for model-based extrapolations into a future under changing environmental conditions...|$|R
