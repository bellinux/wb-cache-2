He ordered Indian Agent Felix St. Vrain to join the <b>group</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> discovered Durley's body and travel with them to Galena. The group left Dixon and traveled north where they found, and interred the remains of Durley at Buffalo Grove.|$|E
5|$|In September 2013, Mayor Rahm Emanuel {{terminated}} {{negotiations to}} privatize the airport, {{noting that the}} process was no longer competitive {{after one of the}} two finalists had backed out. The one remaining was Great Lakes Airport Alliance – a partnership of Macquarie Infrastructure and Real Assets and Ferrovial. Macquarie was one of the investors in the Chicago Skyway. The <b>group</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> backed out was a group that included the Australia-based Industry Funds Management and Manchester Airports Group. The Great Lakes proposal had been valued at $2 billion and would have involved a 40-year lease.|$|E
5|$|Initially, the FBI {{had three}} {{hypotheses}} regarding {{who might have}} been responsible for the bombing. The first was international terrorists, possibly the same <b>group</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> carried out the World Trade Center bombing two years earlier. The FBI also thought that a drug cartel might have been carrying out an act of vengeance against DEA agents as the building held a DEA office. The last hypothesis was that the bombing was done by anti-government right-wing radicals attempting to start a rebellion against the federal government.|$|E

5|$|Butch {{women were}} not a novelty in the 1950s; even in Harlem and Greenwich Village in the 1920s some women assumed these personae. In the 1950s and 1960s, however, the roles were {{pervasive}} and not limited to North America: from 1940 to 1970, butch/femme bar culture flourished in Britain, though there were fewer class distinctions. They further identified members of a <b>group</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> been marginalized; {{women who had been}} rejected by most of society had an inside view of an exclusive group of people that took a high amount of knowledge to function in. Butch and femme were considered coarse by American lesbians of higher social standing during this period. Many wealthier women married to satisfy their familial obligations, and others escaped to Europe to live as expatriates.|$|E
5|$|The Road World Championships {{took place}} in Cancellara's native country Switzerland and he stated that he wished to win both events. Cancellara {{dominated}} the time trial event and won {{by a margin of}} close {{a minute and a half}} over the second-place finisher. This was Cancellara's third world championship in the time trial discipline, which was tied for most ever with Australia's Michael Rogers. Cancellara's next goal was the road race, which was to take place three days later. During the final lap of the race, Cancellara crossed the gap to the race's leading <b>group</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> just formed. At the bottom of the final climb Cadel Evans (Australia) attacked, but no other riders reacted. Cancellara crossed the line in fifth.|$|E
5|$|They {{decided on}} Simon & Garfunkel, a <b>group</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> formed in New York City in the 1960s, {{and had been}} one of the most {{successful}} folk rock groups through the late 60s/early 70s. Simon & Garfunkel had broken up at the height of their popularity and shortly after the release of their fifth studio album, Bridge Over Troubled Water, which is deemed to be their artistic peak and which topped the 1970 Billboard charts for ten weeks. They had grown apart artistically and did not get along well with each other. In the following eleven years, both continued musical careers as solo artists, and worked together only sporadically on single projects. Garfunkel made brief guest appearances at Simon's concerts, which were always successful.|$|E

5|$|In 1939 {{the museum}} began hosting the annual {{exhibitions}} of American Abstract Artists, a group devoted to expanding appreciation of non-objective art {{that had been}} formed in 1936. The show included more than 300 oils, watercolors, pastels, collages, drawings, constructions, and sculpture. That year it also began hosting exhibitions held by the New York Society of Women Artists, a <b>group</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> been founded in 1926 to promote the work of avant garde women artists. Other 1939 shows included contemporary works by artists from Poland, documentary photographs of child laborers by Lewis Hine, an international exhibition of works by women artists, and a large display of Pan-American art. Over {{the next few decades}} the museum would specialize in exhibitions by members of artists' groups. In addition to the two already named, these included the Silvermine Guild of Artists (a Connecticut summer art colony), the Manhattan Camera Club, the Photo-Engravers' Art Society, the Brooklyn Society of Artists, the Artists Equity Group, and USCO (a collective from the Woodstock, New York art colony and Garnerville, New York). The museum was organized as a unit of the Master Institute of United Arts. As it had previously done, the institute gave art classes, provided studio space, and sponsored lectures, concerts, poetry readings, art clinics, and other cultural events.|$|E
5|$|When {{the crowd}} finally reached Versailles, it {{was met by}} another <b>group</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> {{assembled}} from the surrounding area. Members of the Assembly greeted the marchers and invited Maillard into their hall, where he fulminated about the Flanders Regiment and the people's need for bread. As he spoke, the restless Parisians came pouring into the Assembly and sank exhausted on the deputies' benches. Hungry, fatigued, and bedraggled from the rain, they seemed {{to confirm that the}} siege was a simple demand for food. The unprotected deputies {{had no choice but to}} receive the marchers, who shouted down most of the speakers and demanded to hear from the popular reformist deputy Mirabeau. The great orator declined this chance at demagoguery but nonetheless mingled familiarly with the market women, even sitting for some time with one of them upon his knee. A few other deputies welcomed the marchers warmly, including Maximilien Robespierre who was still at that time a relatively obscure figure in politics. Robespierre gave strong words of support to the women and their plight, and his efforts were received appreciatively; his solicitations helped greatly to soften the crowd's hostility towards the Assembly.|$|E

25|$|The average {{bottle of}} Champagne {{contains}} enough carbon dioxide to potentially produce 49 million bubbles. (Wine expert Tom Stevenson puts the number at 250 million.) The bubbles initially form at 20 micrometers {{in diameter and}} expand as they gain buoyancy and rise to the surface. When they reach the surface they are approximately 1 millimeter in size. It is speculated that the bubbles in sparkling wine may speed up alcohol intoxication by helping the alcohol to reach the bloodstream faster. A study conducted at the University of Surrey in the United Kingdom gave subjects equal amounts of flat and sparkling Champagne which contained the same levels of alcohol. After 5 minutes following consumption, the <b>group</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> the sparkling wine had 54 milligrams of alcohol in their blood while the <b>group</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> the same sparkling wine, only flat, had 39 milligrams.|$|E
