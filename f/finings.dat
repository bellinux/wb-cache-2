25|$|Broadly speaking, cask ale brewing {{starts the}} same as that of keg beer. The same brew run could be used to make cask, keg, and bottled beer. The {{difference}} is what happens after the primary fermentation is finished and the beer has been left to condition. Typically keg and bottled beers are either sterile-filtered or pasteurised or both, but beer destined for cask is simply 'racked' (poured) into the cask in its natural state. <b>Finings</b> are usually placed in the cask to assist 'dropping' the yeast giving a clear beer. Extra hops and priming sugar may also be added. The cask is sealed and sent off to the pub. In this state it is like a bottle-conditioned beer and, like bottle-conditioned beers, the beer will continue to develop for a certain period of time. Also like bottle-conditioned beers, the length of time the beer can last in the cask will depend on the nature of the beer itself: unopened, stronger beers can last for months; light, delicate beers need to be tapped and sold quickly. Stronger beers may also need longer to settle and mature. Some pubs have been known to keep very strong beers in a sealed cask for a year or more to allow them to fully develop.|$|E
2500|$|Cask ale {{usually has}} <b>finings</b> added which drag the yeast to the bottom; when the <b>finings</b> have cleared the beer {{it is said}} to have [...] "dropped bright" [...] and the beer will look clear rather than cloudy. However, if a beer has been filtered, or has been cleared of yeast by using <b>finings,</b> and then [...] "racked"—transferred to another container—this is [...] "bright" [...] or re-racked beer. Bright beer is {{essentially}} unpasteurised beer that has been cleared of yeast and placed in a different container. It no longer sits on the yeast. As such, strictly speaking, it is not real ale because it cannot continue to ferment in the container in which it now finds itself.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} enzyme {{treatment can}} improve the settling of the <b>Finings.</b> Bentonite plays a mechanical role of ballast to settle the colloids – it accelerates the sedimentation rate. Gelatin {{is also used to}} flocculate the suspended tannins extracted by the press. Often associated with a bitter taste, their removal is generally beneficial for white wine. Polyvinylpolypyrrolidone or [...] "PVPP" [...] allows the fixing of polyphenols and eliminating them. These molecules are responsible for the browning of wine and their removal gives an element of stability in the future drink.|$|E
6000|$|This {{measure would}} not have so much infuriated the devout as did the {{introduction}} of [...] "black prelacy," [...] and the ejection of some 300 adored ministers, chiefly in the south-west, and [...] "the making of a desert first, and then peopling it with owls and satyrs" [...] (the curates), as Archbishop Leighton described the action of 1663. There ensued the <b>finings</b> of all who would not attend the ministrations of [...] "owls and satyrs,"--a grievance which produced two rebellions (1666 and 1679) and a doctrine of anarchism, and was only worn down by eternal and cruel persecutions.|$|E
50|$|Unfortunately, {{beneficial}} antioxidant flavonoids {{are removed}} by some <b>finings.</b> Quercetin {{is removed from}} red wines via the <b>finings</b> gelatin, casein, and PVPP to reduce astringent flavors. If other fining methods are used, the quercetin remains in the wine. Similarly the catechin flavonoids are removed by PVPP and other <b>finings</b> that target polyphenolic compounds.|$|E
50|$|The enzymatic <b>finings</b> are pectin and pectinase. They aid in {{destroying}} the large polysaccharide molecule named pectin, which otherwise causes haze in fruit wines and juices. They {{are among the}} few <b>finings</b> that are added before juices are fermented.|$|E
50|$|Beer is {{typically}} made from barley malt, water, hops and yeast {{and so is}} often suitable for vegans and vegetarians. Some beer brewers add <b>finings</b> to clarify the beer when racking into a barrel. <b>Finings</b> can include plant-derived products, like Irish moss, or animal-derived products, like isinglass and gelatin.|$|E
50|$|Isinglass <b>finings</b> {{is widely}} used as a {{processing}} aid in the British brewing industry to accelerate the fining, or clarification, of beer. It is used particularly {{in the production of}} cask-conditioned beers, although a few cask ales are available which are not fined using isinglass. The <b>finings</b> flocculate the live yeast in the beer into a jelly-like mass, which settles {{to the bottom of the}} cask. Left undisturbed, beer will clear naturally; the use of isinglass <b>finings</b> accelerates the process. Isinglass is sometimes used with an auxiliary fining, which further accelerates the process of sedimentation.|$|E
50|$|Other than bottle conditioned, beers {{which are}} {{packaged}} in cans, bottles or kegs are filtered in some form, either pasteurised or cold-filtered. In general filtering doesn't {{require the use}} of <b>finings,</b> though animal <b>finings</b> may be used on some batches that are too hazy to be cleared easily by the regular filtering methods.|$|E
5000|$|Irish moss is {{commonly}} used as a clarifying agent or <b>finings</b> {{in the process of}} brewing (beer), particularly in homebrewing. A small amount is added to the kettle or [...] "copper" [...] where it is boiled with the wort, attracting proteins and other solids, which are then removed from the mixture after cooling along with the copper <b>finings.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Cask ale {{usually has}} <b>finings</b> added which drag the yeast to the bottom; when the <b>finings</b> have cleared the beer {{it is said}} to have [...] "dropped bright" [...] and the beer will look clear rather than cloudy. However, if a beer has been filtered, or has been cleared of yeast by using <b>finings,</b> and then [...] "racked"—transferred to another container—this is [...] "bright" [...] or re-racked beer. Bright beer is {{essentially}} unpasteurised beer that has been cleared of yeast and placed in a different container. It no longer sits on the yeast. As such, strictly speaking, it is not real ale because it cannot continue to ferment in the container in which it now finds itself.|$|E
50|$|The ionic <b>finings</b> are {{copper sulfate}} and PVPP. When {{dissolved}} in aqueous beverages, copper sulfate's copper ions can chemically bind undesirable sulfides. The resulting complexes {{must be removed}} by other <b>finings.</b> The action of PVPP appears to be through the formation of hydrogen bonds between its carbonyl groups and the phenolic hydrogens of the polyphenols. It attracts the low molecular weight polyphenols rather than the condensed tannins and leucanthocyanins that are removed by gelatin.|$|E
50|$|<b>Finings</b> can be {{introduced}} during {{the production of}} beer in order to induce it to drop bright more readily. For British beers, the most common fining agent is isinglass, and most breweries producing Real Ale introduce isinglass into the shipment cask so that the beer will drop bright readily upon the cask's being breached; this process can take from several hours {{to two or three}} days and may require the addition of supplementary <b>finings</b> by the cellarman.|$|E
50|$|<b>Finings</b> are {{substances}} {{that are usually}} added {{at or near the}} completion of the processing of brewing wine, beer, and various nonalcoholic juice beverages. Their purpose is for removal of organic compounds; either to improve clarity or adjust flavor/aroma. Specifically, the removed compounds may be sulfides, proteins, polyphenols, benzenoids, or copper ions. Unless they form a stable bottom sediment in the final container, the spent <b>finings</b> are usually discarded from the beverage along with the target compounds that they capture.|$|E
50|$|Polyphenols in wine, {{beer and}} various nonalcoholic juice {{beverages}} {{can be removed}} using <b>finings,</b> substances that are usually added {{at or near the}} completion of the processing of brewing.|$|E
50|$|Wine is {{sometimes}} finished with animal products. Specifically, <b>finings</b> used to remove organic impurities and improve clarity and flavour include several animal products, including casein, albumen, gelatin and isinglass.|$|E
5000|$|Most beer is {{filtered}} {{without the}} need for animal products, and so remains vegetarian; however British cask ale producers don't filter the beer {{at the end of the}} production process. When beer is left unfiltered, the yeast that fermented the wort, and turned the sugar in the barley into alcohol, remains in suspension in the liquid. The yeast that remains suspended in the beer creates a cloudy appearance, and can have a yeasty flavour. <b>Finings</b> are used to clear the beer of yeast [...] - [...] there are a variety of agents used as <b>finings,</b> including silicon dioxide, gelatin, polyclar, and isinglass.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike kegs, {{which can}} be simply stood upright on the floor, casks are used lying on their sides. This allows the beer to run from the tap under gravity, with room in the [...] "belly" [...] of the cask below the outlet for the <b>finings</b> to collect. The shive with the spile will then be the highest point on the cask. As the beer clears (see <b>finings),</b> {{the inside of the}} cask becomes coated with sediment. It is {{important}} that the stillage holds the cask absolutely still with no rocking or shaking, otherwise the sediment will be shaken into suspension and the beer will be cloudy.|$|E
50|$|Top-fermenting yeasts stay on {{the surface}} of fermenting beer whilst active, hence top-fermented beers tend to be less {{naturally}} clear than lagers and <b>finings</b> are sometimes used to clarify them. Modern breweries carefully maintain their own distinctive strains of yeast.|$|E
5000|$|When a beer {{has been}} left to allow the yeast to settle {{at the bottom of}} the vessel in which it is held (usually a {{conditioning}} or lagering tank), it has [...] "dropped bright". <b>Finings</b> can be introduced during the production of beer in order to induce it to drop bright more readily.|$|E
50|$|Historically, various {{substances}} such as egg whites, blood, milk, isinglass, and Irish moss {{have been}} used as <b>finings.</b> These are still used by some producers, but more modern substances have also been introduced and are more widely used, including bentonite, gelatin, casein, carrageenan, alginate, diatomaceous earth, pectinase, pectolyase, PVPP (Polyclar), kieselsol (colloidal silica), copper sulfate, dried albumen, hydrated yeast, and activated carbon.|$|E
50|$|Non-cask beers {{that are}} destined for kegs, cans, or bottles are often pasteurized and filtered. The yeast in these beers tends to settle {{to the bottom}} of the storage tank naturally, so the {{sediment}} from these beers can often be filtered without using isinglass. However, some breweries still use isinglass <b>finings</b> for non-cask beers, especially when attempting to repair bad batches.|$|E
5000|$|To be {{considered}} kosher, Sabbath-observant Jews must supervise and sometimes handle the entire winemaking process, {{from the time}} the grapes are crushed until the wine is bottled and any ingredients used, including <b>finings,</b> must be kosher. Wine that is described as [...] "kosher for Passover" [...] must have been kept free from contact with chametz, examples being grain, bread and dough.|$|E
5000|$|Examples {{of animal}} {{products}} used as <b>finings</b> are gelatin, isinglass, chitosan, casein and egg albumen. Bull's blood {{is also used}} in some Mediterranean countries but (as a legacy of BSE (mad cow disease)) is not allowed in the U.S. or the European Union. Kosher wines use isinglass derived from fish bladders, though not from the sturgeon, since the kosher status of this fish is in debate [...]|$|E
50|$|Isinglass <b>finings</b> {{are also}} used in the {{production}} of kosher wines, although for reasons of kashrut, they are not derived from the beluga sturgeon, because this fish is not kosher. Whether the use of a nonkosher isinglass renders a beverage nonkosher is a matter of debate in Jewish law. Rabbi Yehezkel Landau, in Noda B'Yehuda, first edition, Yore Deah 26, for example, permits such beverages. This is the position followed by many kashrut-observant Jews today.|$|E
50|$|Wineries {{might use}} animal-derived {{products}} as <b>finings.</b> To remove proteins, yeast, and other organic particles {{which are in}} suspension during {{the making of the}} wine, a fining agent is added {{to the top of the}} vat. As it sinks down, the particles adhere to the agent, and are carried out of suspension. None of the fining agent remains in the finished product sold in the bottle, and not all wines are fined.|$|E
50|$|Because {{of the way}} ale is conditioned, upending the cask {{to bring}} the {{keystone}} above {{the level of the}} liquid would render the beer undrinkable for at least a day and probably longer, and depending on the condition of the <b>finings</b> may have a permanent effect. Instead, the keystone must be changed in situ. Perhaps surprisingly, this can be achieved without serious loss of beer - half a pint or so is reasonable and half that again is eminently possible.|$|E
5000|$|The Co-operative Group {{became the}} first {{retailer}} to list the ingredients in its own-brand wines on the label in 1999 {{in a move that}} was illegal at the time. They justified their move by stating that they [...] "believe it's in the consumer's interest" [...] to know what is in their wine - as many ingredients, including charcoal and fish <b>finings,</b> have been used to give wines distinctive flavours. Ten years later the UK government pushed for labelling of this kind.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} enzyme {{treatment can}} improve the settling of the <b>Finings.</b> Bentonite plays a mechanical role of ballast to settle the colloids - it accelerates the sedimentation rate.

5000|$|Aunt Sally is a {{traditional}} English throwing game played in pub gardens or fairgrounds {{dating back to the}} 17th Century [...] in which players throw sticks or battens at a model of an old woman's head.In 2011 the inaugural World Aunt Sally Open Singles Championship (WASOSC) took place at the Charlbury Beer Festival in Charlbury, West Oxfordshire which was attended by former prime minister David Cameron and the tournament has continued there annually ever since. The tournament is a knock out competition for individuals, the winner's name is engraved onto the <b>Finings</b> Cup Trophy and the runner-up receives a case of beer.|$|E
50|$|The {{resulting}} wort is then boiled, {{usually for}} 60-90 minutes. Hops are added {{at different times}} during the boil, depending on the desired result. Hops added {{at the beginning of}} the boil contribute bitterness, hops added in the last thirty minutes contribute flavor. Hops added in the last few minutes or even after the end of the boil contribute both flavor and hop aroma. These hop additions are generally referred to as bittering, flavor, and aroma additions respectively. <b>Finings</b> such as Irish moss, a form of seaweed, and others can be added in the final 15-30 minutes of the boil to help prevent haze in the resulting beer.|$|E
5000|$|In 2000 the beers became {{strictly}} {{organic and}} later the same year they became strictly vegan. Marble's ingredients are sourced from non-intensive agriculture {{and they do not}} use isinglass <b>finings,</b> usually made from the swim bladder of the sturgeon, to clear the beer. Despite this the beer is seldom cloudy. Marble's head brewer, James Campbell, has said [...] "We're busier than ever. The beer sells because it tastes good, but the vegetarian side is proving good for business. I've had people tell me that they hadn't been able to drink a pint of beer since they became vegetarians 10 years before. Then they found us." ...|$|E
5000|$|Although {{very little}} {{isinglass}} {{remains in the}} beer when it is drunk, many vegetarians consider beers that are processed with these <b>finings</b> (such as most [...] cask-conditioned ales in the UK) to be unsuitable for vegetarian diets (although acceptable for pescetarians). A beer-fining agent that is suitable for vegetarians is Irish moss, a type of red algae also known as carrageenan. However, carrageenan-based products (used in both the boiling process and after fermentation) primarily reduce hazes caused by proteins, but isinglass is used {{at the end of}} the brewing process, after fermentation, to remove yeast. Since the two fining agents act differently (on different haze-forming particles), they are not interchangeable, and some beers use both.|$|E
5000|$|Anheuser-Busch states {{they do not}} use animal derived products, {{artificial}} ingredients, additives or preservatives at any {{stage of}} the brewing process {{or as part of}} the packaging in any of their range, with the exception of three Michelob products and two Bud Light products, which contain honey and shellfish respectively, and are marketed as such. [...] All other Anheuser-Busch beers are brewed using water, yeast, barley malt, hops, and additional cereal grains. Anheuser-Busch eliminates the need for isinglass <b>finings</b> by settling and removing particles before fermentation. The beechwood aging process also helps to attract and remove yeast from the brew before the lagering process has ended. This only applies to the beers the company brews itself.|$|E
50|$|The only {{adsorbent}} {{types of}} <b>finings</b> in use are activated carbon and specialized fining yeasts. Although activated carbon may be implemented as a flow-through filter, {{it is also}} commonly utilized as a batch ingredient, which later must be separated and discarded from the beverage. It can completely/partially remove benzenoid compounds and all classes of polyphenols non-specifically, decolorizing and deodorizing juices and wines. Traditionally, yeast fining has involved the addition of hydrated yeasts used as adsorption agents. Consisting of approximately 30% protein, yeast cell walls have a chemical affinity with wine compounds, {{such as those that}} may be polyphenolic or metallic. Indeed, yeast fining is a practical means of removing excess copper ions (greater than 0.5 mg/L) when copper sulfate is used to bind selected volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs).|$|E
50|$|The Swedish Lancashire hearth {{consisted}} of a rectangular closed furnace with a chimney (8 metres high) {{at one end and}} a working arch in front of the hearth proper at the other. Pig iron was charged through a door {{at the foot of the}} chimney and stacked on an iron-clad bridge so that it could be heated by the waste gases from the hearth. The hearth was blown through a single water-cooled tuyere with pre-heated air. The hearth {{consisted of}} a rectangular box of iron plates, the bottom plate being water-cooled. Surplus slag was removed with a shovel between <b>finings,</b> but some was left to help the process. Pig stacked on the bridge at the back of the hearth was then pulled forward with a hook and charcoal added. The blast was then turned on and fining began.|$|E
