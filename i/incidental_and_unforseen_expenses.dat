40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to increase}} vocabulary mastery through <b>incidental</b> <b>and</b> contrived learning {{for the first}} year student of machine engineering of SMK Negeri 2 Klaten. The objectives of this research is to describe the implementation of <b>incidental</b> <b>and</b> contrived learning to increase the student’s vocabulary mastery at the first year of Engineering of SMK Negeri 2 Klaten and describe {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} teaching vocabulary by using <b>incidental</b> <b>and</b> contrived learning. This research is classroom action research. The analysis is qualitative method where the data are taken from documentation, interview, test, and observation analysis. The object of the study is the implementation of <b>incidental</b> <b>and</b> contrived learning to increase the student’s vocabulary mastery to the first year students of Mechanical Engineering of SMK Negeri 2 Klaten. The result of the research shows that <b>incidental</b> <b>and</b> contrived learning can increase the students’ vocabulary mastery. Before the observation, the teacher’s teaching technique was monotonous and the students easily get bored. The students tended to speak with other friends than listen to what the teacher said, so the material cannot be learned well, so the result of vocabulary mastery us poor. After the observation using <b>incidental</b> <b>and</b> contrived learning, the vocabulary mastery of the first year students of Mechanical Engineering of SMK 2 Klaten increases. The advantages of using <b>Incidental</b> <b>and</b> Contrived learning on teaching vocabulary are: The material are flexible, depending on the atmosphere or the situation within the class, the student will not get bored if the teacher able to use the method correctly, the students will have an extra new vocabulary from the new material of incidental learning, the teacher can create their own technique with the incidental learning. The disadvantages of using <b>Incidental</b> <b>and</b> Contrived learning on teaching vocabulary are: the students were confused when sometimes teacher changed the material that is not based on the curriculum, the teacher needed more material from the both <b>incidental</b> <b>and</b> contrived learning...|$|R

40|$|CONTEXT: Renal cell {{carcinoma}} {{is the third}} most frequent genitourinary neoplasia, and there is currently {{an increase in the}} incidental diagnosis of tumors confined to the kidneys. OBJECTIVE: To study the survival of patients with <b>incidental</b> <b>and</b> symptomatic renal tumors who have undergone nephrectomy. DESIGN: Retrospective. SETTING: Hospital Sírio Libanês and Beneficência Portuguesa de São Paulo. PARTICIPANTS: 115 patients with diagnosis of renal {{cell carcinoma}}, operated on by the same group of surgeons and evaluated by a single pathologist. MAIN MEASUREMENTS: Sex, age and diagnosis method, analyzed in two groups, according to the tumor diagnosis: Group 1 with <b>incidental</b> diagnosis <b>and</b> Group 2 with symptomatic tumors. The anatomopathological characteristics and patient survival in both groups were evaluated. A statistical analysis was performed using the Student t, chi-squared, log rank and Kaplan-Meyer tests. RESULTS: Among the studied patients, 59 (51 %) had an incidental diagnosis, with 78 % diagnosed by ultrasonography, 20 % by computerized tomography scan and 2 % during surgeries; 56 patients (49 %) were symptomatic. Tumor locations were equally distributed between the two kidneys, and the surgery was conservative for 24 % of the <b>incidental</b> <b>and</b> 9 % of the symptomatic group. In the incidental group only one patient had tumor progression and there was no death, while in the symptomatic group there were 5 progressions and 10 deaths. The 5 -year specific cancer-free survival was 100 % in the <b>incidental</b> <b>and</b> 80 % in the symptomatic group (p = 0. 001) while the disease-free rate was 98 % in the <b>incidental</b> <b>and</b> 62 % in the symptomatic group (p < 0001). CONCLUSION: Incidental renal tumor diagnosis offers better prognosis, providing longer disease-free survival...|$|R

40|$|Abstract This article {{reviews the}} {{historical}} evolution of hepatic vascular clamping and their indications. The anatomic basis for partial and complete vascular clamping will be discussed, as will the rationales of continuous and intermittent vascular clamping. Specific techniques discussed and described include inflow clamping (Pringle maneuver, extra-hepatic selective clamping and intraglissonian clamping) and outflow clamping (total vascular exclusion, hepatic vascular exclusion with preservation of caval flow). The fundamental {{role of a}} low Central Venous Pressure during open and laparoscopic hepatectomy is described, as is the difference in their intra-operative measurements. The biological basis for ischemic preconditioning will be elucidated. Although the potential dangers of vascular clamping {{and the development of}} modern coagulation devices question the need for systemic clamping; the pre-operative factors <b>and</b> <b>unforseen</b> intra-operative events that mandate the use of hepatic vascular clamping will be highlighted. </p...|$|R

40|$|The radical {{restructuring}} of New Zealand's planning system in 1991 {{was based on}} the Resource Management Act and significant amendments to the Local Government Act 1974. In this paper we report a study of urban planning in New Zealand under this new regime. Amendments to the Local Government Act were designed in large part to facilitate the administration of the Resource Management Act, the authors of which wanted to emphasise the sustainable management of the biophysical environment and dramatically to limit local government's involvement in urban and social planning. Ironically, the strategic planning provisions of the amended Local Government Act gave local government contradictory powers. We discuss the nature of this contradiction and its impacts on the ways in which district planning under the Resource Management Act and strategic planning under the Local Government Act have combined to create new <b>and</b> <b>unforseen</b> approaches to urban planning and management in New Zealand. ...|$|R
40|$|The IEEE P 1394 Serial Bus {{standard}} provides {{high performance}} connections for data transfer between hardware components and is especially {{well suited for}} connecting multimedia devices. To achieve its mechanical verification, a high level specification is developed for the asynchronous part of the P 1394 Link layer, using the verification tool PVS. We derive a formal framework which closely resembles the state machine approach used in the standard document. In this framework, a new parallel combinator characterizes synchronous message passing between transitions for which a set of messages is exchanged atomically. The combinator is mechanically checked for being commutative and associative. As expected, unclarities, ambiguities <b>and</b> <b>unforseen</b> properties need to be resolved in the specification of the Link layer. To date, important Link Layer properties have been handproved using linear time temporal logic; the next aim of the authors is the mechanization of these proofs in PVS...|$|R
