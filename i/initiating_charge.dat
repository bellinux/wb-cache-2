40|$|A newly {{investigated}} measurement {{approach to}} analysing {{the effects of}} long-term memory effects in wide band-gap semiconductor radio-frequency (RF) transistors is presented. This approach utilises a combination of hybrid-active load-pull and time-domain waveform measurement analysis, whilst adopting a novel measurement technique for <b>initiating</b> <b>charge</b> trapping-based transients in a gallium nitride (GaN) HEMT transistor. Switching actively between two load impedances with theoretically common power amplifier (PA) performance characteristics, a step function in the dynamic drain-voltage (vd) is initiated, whilst minimising gate-voltage and average drain-current variation. In isolating the step function to the drain side of the device only {{it is possible to}} extract dependencies of the RF drain-voltage on trap states in the transistor such as those that may occur when subjected to dynamic traffic in in-the-field applications.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to find a material and configuration that could reliably detect the proper functioning of a slapper (non-explosive) detonator. Because of the small size of the slapper geometry (on the order of a 15 mils), most diagnostic techniques are not suitable. This program has the additional requirements that the device would be used on centrifuge so that it could not use any electrical power or output signals. This required that the diagnostic be completely passive. The paper describes the three facets of the development effort: complete characterization of the slapper using VISAR measurements, selection of the diagnostic material and configuration, and testing of the prototype designs. The VISAR testing required that use of a special optical probe to allow the laser light to reach both bridges of the dual-slapper detonator. Results are given in the form of flyer velocity as a function of the <b>initiating</b> <b>charge</b> voltage level. The selected diagnostic design functions in a manner similar to a dent block except that the impact of the Kapton disk from a properly-functioning slapper causes a fracture pattern. A quick visual inspection is all that is needed to determine if the flyer velocity exceeded the threshold value. Sub-threshold velocities produce a substantially different appearance...|$|E

Bare cylindrical charges of PE 4 (RDX/binder 88 / 12 [*]%) were used with length to diameter ratios of 1 / 3. 7 to 5. 75 / 1 and masses of 0. 25 to 0. 45  kg.

50|$|These {{principles}} {{are useful in}} the application of highly energetic materials (explosives). If an explosive charge is placed on a target, the sudden release of energy causes compression waves to propagate through the target radially from the point-charge contact.

40|$|AbstractWe {{investigated}} the electronic {{structure of the}} photosystem II reaction center (PSII RC) {{in relation to the}} light-induced charge separation process using Stark spectroscopy on a series of site-directed PSII RC mutants from the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. The site-directed mutations modify the protein environment of the cofactors involved in charge separation (PD 1, PD 2, ChlD 1, and PheD 1). The results demonstrate that at least two different exciton states are mixed with charge-transfer (CT) states, yielding exciton states with CT character: (PD 2 δ+PD 1 δ−ChlD 1) ∗ 673 nm and (ChlD 1 δ+PheD 1 δ−) ∗ 681 nm (where the subscript indicates the wavelength of the electronic transition). Moreover, the CT state PD 2 +PD 1 − acquires excited-state character due to its mixing with an exciton state, producing (PD 2 +PD 1 −) δ∗ 684 nm. We conclude that the states that <b>initiate</b> <b>charge</b> separation are mixed exciton-CT states, and that the degree of mixing between exciton and CT states determines the efficiency of charge separation. In addition, the results reveal that the pigment-protein interactions fine-tune the energy of the exciton and CT states, and hence the mixing between these states. This mixing ultimately controls the selection and efficiency of a specific charge separation pathway, and highlights the capacity of the protein environment to control the functionality of the PSII RC complex...|$|R
