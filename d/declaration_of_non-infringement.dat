500|$|The OdioWorks {{case was}} one of the first {{high-profile}} cases illustrating Apple's attempts to employ federal police power in its litigation practices by invoking the anti-circumvention provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) as a means of shielding its intellectual property from reverse engineering. In November 2008, Apple sent a cease-and-desist letter to BluWiki, a non-commercial wiki provider, alleging BluWiki infringed Apple's copyrights in publishing a discussion of how to make the latest iPods interoperate with other software and that, by so doing, violated the DMCA. [...] In April 2009, OdioWorks, the operators of BluWiki, backed by the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), defensively sued Apple seeking a <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-infringement</b> and non-circumvention. In July 2009, Apple ceased claiming infringement, stating it was [...] "withdrawing [...] takedown notifications" [...] and that [...] "Apple no longer has, nor will it have in the future, any objection to the publication of the itunesDB Pages which are the subject of the OdioWorks complaint". After Apple withdrew its complaint and cited code obsolescence as a contributing factor in its decision to withdraw, BluWiki then republished its discussion of the issue. The EFF noted, [...] "While we are glad that Apple retracted its baseless legal threats, we are disappointed that it only came after 7 months of censorship and a lawsuit".|$|E

Decisions would be valid for the full territory of the state where the patent is valid.

The proceedings include a counterclaim from the opposed party. The competence includes supplementary protection certificates.|$|R

Calmar was {{a producer of}} “hold-down” sprayers for bottles of chemicals such as insecticides, and Colgate-Palmolive was a purchaser of these sprayers. Inventor Baxter I. Scoggin, Jr. had assigned his patent for sprayer design to Cook Chemical Co. Calmar and Colgate-Palmolive sought a <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> invalidity and <b>non-infringement</b> <b>of</b> the patent, and Cook Chemical Co. sought to maintain an action for infringement. The validity of the patent was sustained by the District Court, and the Eighth Circuit affirmed.|$|R

40|$|In declaratory {{judgment}} actions brought by alleged infringers against rights holders, such as actions for <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> invalidity or <b>non-infringement</b> <b>of</b> intellectual property rights, U. S. courts have long maintained that sending a cease-and-desist letter alone, absent other acts in an alleged infringer 2 ̆ 7 s forum, {{is not a}} sufficient basis for personal jurisdiction over the rights holder who mailed them to the alleged infringer 2 ̆ 7 s forum. Notwithstanding the similarities between cease-and-desist letters and notifications under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals recently decided that sending a notification alone does establish a basis for personal jurisdiction over the rights holder. Contrary to {{the decision of the}} Tenth Circuit, this article suggests that cease-and-desist letters and DMCA notifications should be treated similarly. First, as a matter of doctrine, the two instruments are similar enough to warrant application of the same rule. If a letter does not support the exercise of personal jurisdiction in {{declaratory judgment}} actions against the rights holder, neither should a notification. Second, as a matter of policy, maintaining the same approach to the two instruments would promote settlements. The Tenth Circuit 2 ̆ 7 s approach defeats this pro-settlement policy because it discourages rights holders from using notifications to achieve a speedy removal of allegedly infringing material from the Internet. To avoid personal jurisdiction in the infringer 2 ̆ 7 s forum, rights holders must refrain from using a notification and are thereby deprived of the option to stop further infringements immediately; without such an option {{they are less likely to}} seek settlement before filing a lawsuit. It is important to clarify whether notifications will be a basis of personal jurisdiction over a rights holder because the result will determine how practicable the use of notifications will be for rights holders and therefore how effective the notification system will be...|$|R

50|$|The {{two most}} common {{defenses}} to {{a claim for}} patent infringement are non-infringement and invalidity.

The defense of invalidity is a counter-attack on the patent itself., i.e., the validity of the patent and the allegedly infringed claims.|$|R
