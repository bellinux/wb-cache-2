5|$|Examples of {{matching}} include the Head Start program, which requires that recipients provide 20% {{of the total}} annual expenses in either monetary or <b>in-kind</b> contributions. Recipients of these funds may contribute money to cover teacher payroll, or may contribute a building to house the program classrooms. However, the federal government requires that <b>in-kind</b> contributions be properly valued and evidenced (such as estimating {{the value of a}} building {{to make sure that it}} meets the 20% of the program budget), and certain programs specifically require that matching be made by contributing money only.|$|E
5|$|In 1787, Benjamin Grayson {{sold the}} tavern to Robert Craddock, who {{subsequently}} converted {{it into his}} private residence. The replica that stands in Constitution Square houses {{the offices of the}} Convention and Tourism Bureau and The Great American Brass Band Festival. When Boyle County took over Constitution Square, the fiscal court agreed to waive the rent paid by the Convention and Tourism Bureau in exchange for its <b>in-kind</b> services managing the park jointly with the Boyle County Industrial Foundation. Danville Mayor Bernie Hunstad opposed the arrangement, fearing that park management would dilute both organizations' primary missions of bringing jobs to the area. In March 2013, Hunstad resigned his ex-officio membership on the Boyle County Industrial Foundation in protest.|$|E
5|$|Like Ladislaus I, Coloman {{proved to}} be a great legislator, but he {{prescribed}} less severe punishments than his uncle had done. He ordered that transactions between Christians and Jews were to be put into writing. His laws concerning his Muslim subjects aimed at their conversion, for instance, by obliging them to marry their daughters to Christians. The presence of Jewish and Muslim merchants in the kingdom was due to its role as a crossroad of trading routes leading towards Constantinople, Regensburg and Kiev. Local trade also existed, which enabled Coloman to collect the marturina, the traditional <b>in-kind</b> tax of Slavonia, in cash.|$|E
5|$|Land {{transport}} {{utilized the}} advanced system of Roman roads. The <b>in-kind</b> taxes paid by communities included {{the provision of}} personnel, animals, or vehicles for the cursus publicus, the state mail and transport service established by Augustus. Relay stations were located along the roads every seven to twelve Roman miles, and tended to grow into a village or trading post. A mansio (plural mansiones) was a privately run service station franchised by the imperial bureaucracy for the cursus publicus. The support staff at such a facility included muleteers, secretaries, blacksmiths, cartwrights, a veterinarian, and a few military police and couriers. The distance between mansiones was determined by how far a wagon could travel in a day. Mules were the animal most often used for pulling carts, travelling about 4mph. As {{an example of the}} pace of communication, it took a messenger a minimum of nine days to travel to Rome from Mainz in the province of Germania Superior, even on a matter of urgency. In addition to the mansiones, some taverns offered accommodations as well as food and drink; one recorded tab for a stay showed charges for wine, bread, mule feed, and the services of a prostitute.|$|E
5|$|Matching, also {{referred}} to as “cost sharing”, is a requirement for the recipient to provide contributions or donations (usually non-federal) of a specified amount or percentage to supplement federal assistance received. In other words, when the recipient participates in a federal program (e.g. it receives federal assistance) and an operating budget is prepared, the federal government may require the recipient to provide contributions to cover a portion of that program’s operations. The matching requirement is based on the assertion that total program expenses are 100% and that, although the federal government provides assistance for most of those expenses, the recipient must still cover a portion of them. Such proportion is solely decided by the federal government, but usually the recipient decides how that contribution is provided and to which expenses, so long as the contribution is verifiable, generally does not originate from another federal program, and is considered in the operating budget. The expenses must be necessary and reasonable, allowed under cost principles (see B section above), and not used for another federal program. Matching may be in the form of contributing the recipient’s own funds or money to suffrage program allowable costs (e.g., paying program utility bills, paying part of program personnel payroll, etc.) or, in some cases, in the form of <b>in-kind</b> contributions, which are donations of non-monetary objects such as services, materials, property, etc.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, GM gave $51,200,000 in cash {{contributions}} and $17,200,000 <b>in-kind</b> donations to charitable causes.|$|E
25|$|The Federal Election Commission fined the Republican Party of Virginia and {{the company}} owned by Jeff Frederick for {{problems}} that arose when his company made an <b>in-kind</b> contribution in a federal election year but intended for state political activities.|$|E
25|$|In addition, various private {{groups and}} {{organizations}} have supported RWB through <b>in-kind</b> donations of their services. The photography books are one example, {{as is the}} work of Saatchi & Saatchi which created various communication campaigns free (for instance, concerning censorship in Algeria).|$|E
25|$|One {{column and}} window were {{restored}} in 2004, {{the first time}} since the church's deconsecration that any work had been done on the building's decorative elements. In 2006, the remaining three columns were restored through a combination of <b>in-kind</b> repayment and donated services.|$|E

25|$|Through 2002, the PACE Awards program, led by GM, EDS, and SUN Microsystems, {{has given}} over $1.2billion of <b>in-kind</b> {{contributions}} which includes computers to over 18 universities to support engineering education. In 2009, the GM led group {{has helped the}} Pace Awards program worldwide.|$|E
25|$|The public {{response}} to helping Springer was overwhelming. In {{a matter of}} weeks, OOF successfully raised the matching funds triggering the Prescott grants. There was now approximately $266,666 USD in cash and <b>in-kind</b> services and equipment available to the project, by most accounts {{more than enough to}} get Springer home.|$|E
25|$|The Network, a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt organization, {{finances}} its {{conservation efforts}} through donations from private corporations, Puerto Rico Legislature Community Funds and limited endangered species {{funds from the}} Commonwealth and Federal governments. <b>In-kind</b> donations from several key corporations have been crucial in allowing the Network and the PRMCC to continue its conservation efforts.|$|E
25|$|Contrary {{to popular}} beliefs, most child labourers are {{employed}} {{by their parents}} rather than in manufacturing or formal economy. Children who work for pay or <b>in-kind</b> compensation are usually found in rural settings, then urban centres. Less than 3 percent of child labour aged 5–14 across the world work outside their household, or away from their parents.|$|E
25|$|In claims court, {{lands are}} valued at {{the date of}} purchase, not at present value, and without interest. Recovery is limited to that fair market value, {{and may not be}} {{increased}} to another measure, such as restitution of the profit gained by the United States through breaching its duty. Other payments or <b>in-kind</b> services may be offset from judgements.|$|E
25|$|Besides {{off-site}} adoption program partnerships, shelters {{may also}} partner with veterinarians, veterinary and local businesses for funding, <b>in-kind</b> donations and sponsorships. Maddie's Fund has given grants to veterinary groups and veterinarians who have provided low-cost spay/neuter programs, {{as well to}} as veterinary schools for shelter medicine programs, including UC Davis Veterinary College, Auburn University and Cornell University.|$|E
25|$|Poet in the City is {{supported}} by a panel of corporate organisations that provide <b>in-kind</b> support and ad-hoc sponsorship, and it operates a Friends’ scheme whereby individuals can support its work.

Majora then took StartUp Box to victory at the national Blogher Conference in 2015, winning the pitch contest with $250,000 worth of <b>in-kind</b> services from SheKnows Media.|$|E
25|$|On February 21, 2006, the Iowa Democratic Party {{filed an}} ethics {{complaint}} against Nussle for not reporting any <b>in-kind</b> donations {{from the federal}} “Nussle for Congress Committee”.

25|$|The {{attendance}} {{rate was}} 91% in 2011, while in 2010 it was 89%. In 2011, the school reports {{that all the}} teachers are certified and highly qualified. In 2010 the enrollment was 268 students. During the summer of 2011, the pupils participated in First Lady Obama's Healthy Foods Initiative by growing a vegetable garden. The project was supported by an Earth Force Southeastern Pennsylvania service-learning grant and <b>in-kind</b> donations from the Home Depot in Folsom.|$|E
25|$|Agriculture and Consumer Protection Act of 1973 (P.L. 93-86, August 10, 1973) {{required}} States {{to expand}} the program to every political jurisdiction before July 1, 1974; expanded the program to drug addicts and alcoholics in treatment and rehabilitation centers; established semi-annual allotment adjustments, SSI cash-out, and bi-monthly issuance; introduced statutory complexity in the income definition (by including <b>in-kind</b> payments and providing an accompanying exception); and required the Department to establish temporary eligibility standards for disasters.|$|E
25|$|UNBRO was a {{temporary}} agency, {{created by the}} UN General Assembly to address a specific crisis. It had a mandate but no charter or independent governing council. Nor did it have an independent budget; it {{had to rely on}} the support of donor countries from the General Assembly, solicited through pledges at donor meetings twice a year. UNBRO received its monetary and <b>in-kind</b> donations primarily from the United States, the European Commission, Japan, France, the United Kingdom, Australia and Canada.|$|E
25|$|In a pay-to-play gig, the {{performer}} will either pay the promoter {{some money to}} be allowed to perform at the show, or will have to offer some <b>in-kind</b> payment. In a conventional comedy club, the promoter will pay the acts for their performance, and will raise the money to stage the gig by charging the audience. Some clubs offer open mic slots, where newer acts are allowed to learn the craft, unpaid; this {{is not the same as}} pay-to-play. Many comedians are against pay-to-play schemes, which they consider exploitative.|$|E
25|$|In 1973, Grand Rapids hosted Sculpture off the Pedestal, {{an outdoor}} {{exhibition}} of public sculpture, which assembled works by 13 world-renowned artists, including Mark di Suvero, John Henry, Kenneth Snelson, Robert Morris, John Mason, Lyman Kipp and Stephen Antonakos, in a single, citywide celebration. Sculpture off the Pedestal was a public/private partnership, including financial support by the National Endowment for the Arts, educational {{support from the}} Michigan Council for the Arts, and <b>in-kind</b> contributions from individuals, business and industry. Fund-raising events, volunteers and locals housing artists contributed to the public character of the event.|$|E
25|$|Its {{primary goal}} {{continues}} to be to transform education, by enabling children in low-income countries {{to have access to}} content, media and computer-programming environments. At the time that the program launched, the typical retail price for a laptop was considerably in excess of $1,000 (US), so it was infeasible to achieve this objective without also bringing a low-cost machine to production. This became the OLPC XO Laptop, a low-cost and low-power laptop computer. The project was originally funded by member organizations such as AMD, eBay, Google, Marvell Technology Group, News Corporation, Nortel. Chi Mei Corporation, Red Hat, and Quanta provided <b>in-kind</b> support.|$|E
25|$|VISTA was {{conceived}} and {{developed by a}} consortium of 18 universities in the United Kingdom led by Queen Mary, University of London, and it became an <b>in-kind</b> contribution to ESO {{as part of the}} UK's ratification agreement. The telescope's design and construction were managed by the Science and Technology Facilities Council's UK Astronomy Technology Centre (STFC, UK ATC). Provisional acceptance of VISTA was formally granted by ESO at the December 2009 ceremony at ESO headquarters in Garching, which was attended by representatives of Queen Mary, University of London and STFC. Since then the telescope has been operated by ESO, capturing quality images since it began operation.|$|E
25|$|In February 2015, Sharon Pearce {{announced}} that she was stepping down from her role as President of the Miss America Organization. At that time, the then-current CEO Sam Haskell was named Executive Chairman of the Miss America Organization, retained the title of CEO, and assumed all of Pearce's responsibilities. In addition, Miss America 2014, Nina Davuluri, was appointed {{one of the new}} trustees to the Miss America Foundation. In September 2015, Miss America officials {{announced that}} the organization grants $5.5 million in scholarships, a number which still includes adding together offers of <b>in-kind</b> tuition waivers from multiple schools when a contestant could accept one at most.|$|E
25|$|In modern {{taxation}} systems, governments levy {{taxes in}} money; but <b>in-kind</b> and corvée taxation {{are characteristic of}} traditional or pre-capitalist states and their functional equivalents. The method of taxation and the government expenditure of taxes raised is often highly debated in politics and economics. Tax collection is performed by a government agency such as the Canada Revenue Agency, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in the United States, or Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC) in the United Kingdom. When taxes are not fully paid, the state may impose civil penalties (such as fines or forfeiture) or criminal penalties (such as incarceration) on the non-paying entity or individual.|$|E
25|$|Since China bordered Vietnam, it was {{an immensely}} {{important}} conduit of material on land, although the Soviets also delivered some of its aid by sea. Soviet aid outstripped that of China, averaging over {{half a billion dollars}} per year in the later stages of the war, with some $700million in 1967 alone. China provided an estimated $150 million to $200 million annually, along with such <b>in-kind</b> aid as the deployment of thousands of troops in road and railway construction in the border provinces. China also provided radar stations and airfields where North Vietnamese aircraft could marshal for attack, or flee to when in trouble against American air forces. These military airbases were off-limits to American retaliation.|$|E
25|$|ETF {{distributors}} only {{buy or sell}} ETFs {{directly from}} or to authorized participants, which are large broker-dealers with whom they have entered into agreements—and then, only in creation units, which are large blocks {{of tens of thousands}} of ETF shares, usually exchanged <b>in-kind</b> with baskets of the underlying securities. Authorized participants may wish to invest in the ETF shares for the long-term, but they usually act as market makers on the open market, using their ability to exchange creation units with their underlying securities to provide liquidity of the ETF shares and help ensure that their intraday market price approximates the net asset value of the underlying assets. Other investors, such as individuals using a retail broker, trade ETF shares on this secondary market.|$|E
25|$|On January 23, 1997, Metro-North {{acquired}} the property {{necessary for the}} extension of service on the Upper Harlem Division to Wassaic. In August 1997, the Final Environmental Impact Study for the Wassaic extension was completed, recommending that preferred option, the extension of service to Wassaic be completed. One of the rejected alternatives, was the restoration of service to Millerton and Mount Riga in Dutchess County. A layover yard would have also been built {{as part of this}} alternative. This alternative was rejected due to the presence of the Harlem Valley Rail Trail, and replacing it with rail service would have required an <b>in-kind</b> replacement of any taking of parkland. Since a majority of the line was not owned by Metro-North it was viewed as being cost-prohibitive.|$|E
25|$|The {{ability to}} attract greater {{research}} funds is needed to meet {{the goals of the}} plan, and the university has set a goal of $100million annually. Fourteen years later, in FY2013, research expenditures reached this goal. To help raise money the university mounted a $1billion capital campaign, of which the public phase began in September 2004 and was expected to finish by 2008. In 2001, a major milestone of the campaign was the pledging of an unrestricted gift of $360million by an anonymous donor, believed to be the largest such gift to a U.S.university at the time. The university had been a relative stranger to such generosity as the prior largest single gift was $15million. By September 2006, the $1billion goal has been exceeded much in part to an <b>in-kind</b> contribution of software commercially valued at $513.95million by the Partners for the Advancement of Collaborative Engineering Education (PACE). In light of this, the board of trustees increased the goal of the $1billion capital campaign to $1.4billion by June 30, 2009. The new goal was met by October 1, 2008.|$|E
25|$|Income {{grants are}} argued to be vastly more {{efficient}} in extending basic needs {{to the poor}} than subsidizing supplies whose effectiveness in poverty alleviation is diluted by the non-poor who enjoy the same subsidized prices. With cars and other appliances, the wealthiest 20% of Egypt uses about 93% of the country's fuel subsidies. In some countries, fuel subsidies are a larger part of the budget than health and education. A 2008 study concluded that {{the money spent on}} <b>in-kind</b> transfers in India in a year could lift all India's poor out of poverty for that year if transferred directly. The primary obstacle argued against direct cash transfers is the impractically for poor countries of such large and direct transfers. In practice, payments determined by complex iris scanning are used by war-torn Democratic Republic of Congo and Afghanistan, while India is phasing out its fuel subsidies in favor of direct transfers. Additionally, in aid models, the famine relief model increasingly used by aid groups calls for giving cash or cash vouchers to the hungry to pay local farmers instead of buying food from donor countries, often required by law, as it wastes money on transport costs.|$|E
500|$|When Atlantic Gulf & Pacific Dredging Company John McMullen {{left his}} estate to Cornell to {{establish}} scholarships for engineering students, Cornell's Trustees decided to invest those funds, and eventually sold the dredging company. The resulting fund is Cornell's largest single scholarship endowment. Since 1925, {{the fund has}} provided substantial assistance to more than 3,700 engineering students. (Cornell has received a number of unusual non-cash (<b>in-kind)</b> gifts over the years, including: Ezra Cornell's farm, the Cornell Aeronautical Laborary (see below), a copy of Lincoln's Gettysburg Address, a Peruvian mummy, and the Ostrander elm trees.) ...|$|E
500|$|Dwarf Fortress has {{attracted}} a significant cult following. The game's difficulty, with most fortresses eventually succumbing to various forms of defeat, led to its unofficial slogan [...] "Losing is fun!" [...] Adams {{has said that the}} slogan was originally a throw-away joke from the game manual, and is meant to create comfort with the concept of permadeath. Tarn and Zach Adams answer questions from players on the game's official podcast, [...] "Dwarf Fortress Talk." [...] Donors receive personalized crayon drawings or short stories from Tarn Adams, and their names are displayed on a [...] "Champions' List" [...] online. In addition to cash donations, Adams said he has received many <b>in-kind</b> donations. For example, volunteers handle the bug tracking system.|$|E
500|$|Taxation {{under the}} Empire {{amounted}} to about 5% of the Empire's gross product. The typical tax rate paid by individuals ranged from 2 to 5%. The tax code was [...] "bewildering" [...] in its complicated system of {{direct and indirect}} taxes, some paid in cash and some in kind. Taxes might be specific to a province, or kinds of properties such as fisheries or salt evaporation ponds; they might be in effect for a limited time. Tax collection was justified {{by the need to}} maintain the military, and taxpayers sometimes got a refund if the army captured a surplus of booty. <b>In-kind</b> taxes were accepted from less-monetized areas, particularly those who could supply grain or goods to army camps.|$|E
