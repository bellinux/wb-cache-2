5|$|In January 2011, the Danish Ministry of Defence {{reportedly}} {{could not}} afford the retrofitting of the AW101 fleet for Afghanistan operations, against earlier reports of a deployment in 2012. In February 2013, Aviation Week reported that earlier reliability problems had been resolved and that a full upgrade package would be applied to Danish AW101s; these included the addition of electronic warfare pods and a new <b>electro-optical</b> <b>system,</b> in advance of a deployment in Afghanistan in 2014. In September 2013, Danish AW101s were to receive L-3 Wescam MX-15 electro-optical/infrared (EO/IR) sensors; SAR aircraft already carry the FLIR Systems Star Safire II EO/IR sensor.|$|E
25|$|The UOMZ 101KS Atoll <b>electro-optical</b> <b>system</b> {{includes}} the 101KS-V infra-red search and track turret {{mounted on the}} starboard side {{in front of the}} cockpit. This sensor can detect, identify, and track multiple airborne targets simultaneously. The 101KS-O infrared countermeasure system has sensors housed in turrets mounted on the dorsal spine and forward fuselage and uses laser-based countermeasures against heat-seeking missiles.

25|$|Kh-101/102 (Izdeliye 111) - {{developed}} as a very stealthy replacement for the Kh-55SM in the late 1990s, the Kh-101 has a conventional warhead and the Kh-102 is thermonuclear. This missile weighs some 2,200 - 2,400kg, the weight of warhead is 400–450kg. According to reports, the Kh-101 has a maximum range of 4500–5500km and a variable flight profile at altitudes ranging from 30 – 70 m to 6000 m, a cruising speed of 190–200m/s and a maximum speed of 250–270m/s. The missile is equipped with an <b>electro-optical</b> <b>system</b> for correcting the flight trajectory and with a TV guidance system for terminal guidance. Its official range is 4,500km or 3,000km with a conventional payload. It is re-targetable. The missiles {{are expected to be}} accurate within 10–20 m CEP. They are expected to be in service in those numbers by 2023. The new missile complex has been successfully tested and in recent years put into series production to equip modernized Tu-160 and Tu-95MSM bombers.|$|E

50|$|Optical or <b>electro-optical</b> <b>systems</b> detect {{either the}} {{physical}} {{phenomenon of the}} muzzle flash of a bullet being fired or the heat caused by the friction of the bullet as it moves through the air.

Although a general line of sight to the shot event is required, detections are sometimes available as the infrared flash event bounces off surrounding structure.

40|$|Present-day naval {{operations}} {{take place}} in coastal environments as well as narrow straits all over the world. Coastal environments {{around the world are}} exhibiting a number of threats to naval forces. In particular, a large number of asymmetric threats can be present in environments with cluttered backgrounds as well as rapidly varying atmospheric conditions. The automatic detection of small targets by <b>electro-optical</b> <b>systems</b> may be hampered by small surface structure variations at the surface and near the horizon. In current <b>electro-optical</b> sensor <b>systems</b> processing of imagery is seldom task-specific. Using task-specific settings of sensors, processing and fusion, can improve the performance of <b>electro-optical</b> <b>systems</b> dramatically. This paper discusses the effect of dynamic sensor settings as function of specific tasks and environmental parameters and how these can {{play a role in the}} management of sensors in a naval application. In addition, a series of experiments with different targets are presented to demonstrate the benefit of sensor management. Some sensor management approaches for application in infrared systems are discussed. © 2010 Copyright SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering...|$|R
