5|$|In {{addition}} to the four nationwide tours {{and all the other}} concerts, what little time remained was taken up with TV shows, press interviews, and recording sessions for the singles and albums released that year. The Beatles also had a weekly radio show. The music papers were full of stories about the Beatles, and magazines for teenage girls regularly contained interviews with the band members, colour posters and other Beatle-related articles. The intense public interest in the Beatles, coupled with Epstein's demanding schedule, ensured that they had no time for family matters. Lennon's August 1962 marriage to Cynthia Powell was kept from public view as a closely guarded secret. When Lennon's son Julian was born on 8 April 1963, Lennon, visiting the hospital to see his wife and meet his new son for the first time, attempted to disguise himself to prevent people in the hospital from recognising him. Lennon's attempt to keep the secret was not successful as other patients could see <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>him.</b> After the hospital visit, Epstein's schedule prevailed once more.|$|E
5|$|Vanessa {{learns that}} Rhys altered his test results and he begs {{her to keep}} his secret. Jessica later asks Rhys to retake the EMG and informs him that his nerves will never improve to the {{standard}} required for a surgeon. Realising Vanessa spoke to Jessica, Rhys breaks up with her. When Rhys learns that Vanessa is marrying Lucas, he urges her not {{to go through with}} it. Rhys attends the wedding and Vanessa struggles with her vows and leaves the church.

When Vanessa goes into labour, Rhys takes her to the hospital and stays by her side while her son is born. He tells her that he has never stopped loving her and when he proposes, Vanessa accepts. However, when Rhys discovers that her son, Patrick (Lucas MacFarlane) has ebstein's anomaly, Vanessa calls off the engagement to focus her attention on him. Rhys sets up a fund raising webpage for Patrick and sells his car to kick start the donations.

5|$|The most {{prominent}} rivalry {{heading into the}} pay-per-view was between then-WWF Champion Diesel and his storyline rival Sid. At the previous pay-per-view, WrestleMania XI, Diesel defeated Shawn Michaels to retain the WWF Championship, partly due to an interference by Michaels' bodyguard Sid backfiring. The following night, Michaels stated that for a potential rematch, he would give Sid the night off, causing the bodyguard to turn on Michaels by powerbombing him three times. Diesel eventually came out to help Michaels. Michaels was legitimately injured, and this sidelined him for six weeks, effectively shelving plans for a rematch between Diesel and Michaels. Diesel was then scheduled to defend his title against Bam Bam Bigelow, {{a member of the}} Million Dollar Corporation stable, after a staged confrontation between the two on the April 16, 1995 episode of Action Zone, a secondary television program for the WWF. On the same day, on Wrestling Challenge, another secondary television program, in a segment featuring the Corporation, Bigelow was noticeably snubbed, signaling a turn. Over the weekend of April 16, a match between Sid and Diesel was scheduled for In Your House, in which Sid could potentially face Diesel for the WWF Championship, depending on whether he retained or lost his title against Bigelow. On the April 24 episode of Raw, Sid stated he was unhappy about this stipulation, as it meant that if Bigelow won, Sid would not get a shot at the title. Diesel retained the title when the Corporation turned on Bigelow, with Tatanka tripping Bigelow as he ran off the ropes. Diesel hit Bigelow with a big boot and executed a powerbomb for the win. After the contest, Bigelow was insulted by Ted DiBiase and attacked by the Corporation. Diesel, who had gone back to the locker room, came to Bigelow's aid. In Sid's match with Razor Ramon on the May 1 episode of Raw, Diesel approached the ring ready to fight Sid, who, along with the Corporation's manager DiBiase, left the arena abruptly. The following week on Raw, DiBiase revealed that he and Sid had been working together for a while, admitting that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>him</b> who told Shawn Michaels to get a bodyguard.|$|E
