40|$|Salinity Gradient Power by Reverse Electrodialysis (SGP-RE) {{technology}} {{allows the}} production of electricity from the different chemical potentials of two differently concentrated salty solutions flowing in alternate channels suitably separated by selective ion exchange membranes. In SGP-RE, {{as well as in}} conventional ElectroDialysis (ED) technology, the process performance dramatically depends on the stack geometry and the internal fluid dynamics conditions: optimizing the system geometry in order to guarantee lower pressure drops (DP) and uniform flow rates distribution within the channels is a topic of primary importance. Although literature studies on Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis and optimization of spacer-filled channels have been recently increasing in number and range of applications, only a few efforts have been focused on the analysis of the overall performance of the process. In particular, the proper attention should be devoted to verify whether the spacer geometry optimization really represents the main factor affecting the overall process performance. In the present work, realized within the EU-FP 7 funded REAPower project, CFD simulations were carried out in order to assess the effects of different parameters on the global process efficiency, such as the choice of spacer material and morphology, and the optimization of feed and blowdown distribution systems. Spacer material and morphology can affect the fluid dynamics inside each channel. In particular, the appropriate choice of net spacer material can influence the slip/no-slip condition of the flow on the spacer wires, thus significantly affecting the channel fluid dynamics in terms of pressure drops. A Unit Cell approach was adopted to investigate the effect of the different choices on the fluid flow along the channel. Also, the possibility of choosing a porous medium to substitute the net spacer was theoretically addressed. Such investigation focused on the porosity and the fiber radius required to respect the process constrains of pressure drops and mechanical stability. On the other hand, the overall pressure drops of a SGP-RE or ED stack can be considered as resulting from different contributions: the pressure drop relevant to the <b>feed</b> <b>distributor,</b> the pressure drop inside the channel, and the pressure drop in the discharging collector. The choice of the optimal stack geometry is, therefore, strongly related to the need of both minimizing each of the above terms and obtaining the most uniform feed streams distribution among the stack channels. In order to investigate such aspects, simulations were performed on a simplified ideal planar stack with either 50 spacer-less or 50 spacer-filled channels. The effect of the distribution/collector channel thickness and geometry on single-channel flow rates and overall pressure drops in the system was analyzed and a significant influence of distributor layout and size on the overall process performance was found...|$|E

40|$|As {{the result}} of 15 years of {{research}} (50 staff years of effort) Argonne National Laboratory (ANL), through its involvement in fluidized-bed combustion, magnetohydrodynamics, {{and a variety of}} environmental programs, has produced extensive computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software and models to predict the multiphase hydrodynamic and reactive behavior of fluid-solids motions and interactions in complex fluidized-bed reactors (FBRS) and slurry systems. This has resulted in the FLUFIX, IRF, and SLUFIX computer programs. These programs are based on fluid-solids hydrodynamic models and can predict information important to the designer of atmospheric or pressurized bubbling and circulating FBR, fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) and slurry units to guarantee optimum efficiency with minimum release of pollutants into the environment. This latter issue will become of paramount importance with the enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendment (CAAA) of 1995. Solids motion is also the key to understanding erosion processes. Erosion rates in FBRs and pneumatic and slurry components are computed by ANL`s EROSION code to predict the potential metal wastage of FBR walls, intervals, <b>feed</b> <b>distributors,</b> and cyclones. Only the FLUFIX and IRF codes will be reviewed in the paper together with highlights of the validations because of length limitations. It is envisioned that one day, these codes with user-friendly pre and post-processor software and tailored for massively parallel multiprocessor shared memory computational platforms will be used by industry and researchers to assist in reducing and/or eliminating the environmental and economic barriers which limit full consideration of coal, shale and biomass as energy sources, to retain energy security, and to remediate waste and ecological problems...|$|R

40|$|This Working Paper for the South Asia {{regional}} {{hub of the}} Pro-Poor Livestock Policy Initiative presents the case for using poultry, in very small units of 5 - 10 adult birds, {{as a means of}} alleviating the poverty of rural women in the region. Policies and procedures that affect the success of such initiatives are examined. The author draws on personal experience and an extensive literature review. The main focus of the paper is a review of {{what is known as the}} Bangladesh Model. Emphasising that this is not a static model, the author explains its evolution by Bangladesh's largest NGO, BRAC, working with the government department responsible for livestock services. The main feature of the model is that the supply of inputs and services are turned into income earning opportunities for poor people. The focus is on poverty reduction, rather than on increasing the supply of eggs and poultry meat. The main components are the involvement of NGOs that have access to groups of very poor women, the provision by NGOs of micro-credit and training to help groups establish small, semi-scavenging, egg-laying units, and special training for poultry workers, <b>feed</b> <b>distributors</b> and egg traders. The Bangladesh model has been incorporated into several major, Danida-sponsored development projects. The paper includes a discussion of its impact on poor families, and the policy and institutional implications that have arisen, in particular the role of government support in terms of the provision of veterinary and other services, research and training. The Bangladesh experience is contrasted to that of India where, in some States, the commercial sector has a strong presence. The author recommends that a survey be undertaken in India and Nepal that should examine livestock policies at (selected) State and at central level. The experiences of NGOs that have used poultry as a means of alleviating poverty should be explored and also the degree to which understanding, skills and knowledge exist in organisations responsible for policy, field level implementation, and research and training.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to study the cuniculture industry in Spain, according to the Food Value Chain model, and analyse what its main operators are. Four components were identified in the rabbit meat production chain: input suppliers, producers, abattoirs and cutting plants and distribution. Distribution can follow 2 paths, the traditional channel and the modern or large-scale distribution channel. Rabbit feed, which represents the main input for producers, is a minority product, especially when compared to feeds formulated for other livestock species, as its manufacture calls for specialist companies. Rabbit production is linked to the rural environment and constitutes a significant economic option, not only for farms but also for the industry around it, such as <b>feed</b> producers and <b>distributors,</b> technicians, slaughterhouses or leather processors, among others. Rabbit farms are generally independent and not usually integrated, as found in other types of livestock. Slaughterhouses currently represent one of the main axes of the rabbit meat production chain and are either focused on traditional or large-scale distribution. The main strategic changes are apparent in slaughterhouses focused on large-scale distribution by seeking cooperative ways of working, using slaughterhouse groupings and vertical integration processes. This way, they manage to adjust margins by working with economies of scale and, ultimately, lower prices. Slaughterhouses whose strategies are based on traditional distribution may achieve higher margins than those focusing their efforts on large-scale distribution, but their growth is limited. In traditional retail premises, the majority of sales consist of whole carcasses in bulk, which are prepared and quartered as per consumer tastes. Large-scale retail distribution outlets sell both cut produce from the meat counters located in their own premises and pre-packaged products, more suited to self-service formulae. Brand presence is minimal, as is that of processed or semiprocessed products. This current situation requires support from the entire sector in order to provide rabbit meat with new features better adapted to consumers’ needs, above and beyond price and with greater added value...|$|R
5000|$|The Paraho {{process can}} be {{operated}} in two different heating modes, which are direct and indirect. [...] The Paraho Direct process evolved from gas combustion retort technology and is classified as an internal combustion method. [...] Accordingly, the Paraho Direct retort is a vertical shaft retort similar to the Kiviter and Fushun retorts, used correspondingly in Estonia and China. [...] However, compared to the earlier gas combustion retorts the Paraho retort's raw oil shale <b>feeding</b> mechanism, gas <b>distributor,</b> and discharge grate have different designs. In the Paraho Direct process, the crushed and screened raw oil shale is fed {{into the top of}} the retort through a rotating distributor. The oil shale descends the retort as a moving bed. [...] The oil shale is heated by the rising combustion gases from {{the lower part of the}} retort and the kerogen in the shale decomposes at about [...] to oil vapour, shale oil gas and spent shale. Heat for pyrolysis comes from the combustion of char in the spent shale. The combustion takes place where air is injected at two levels in the middle of the retort below the pyrolysis section raising the temperature of the shale and the gas to [...] to [...] [...] Collecting tubes at the top of the retort carry shale oil mist, evolved gases and combustion gases into the product separation unit, where oil, water and dust are separated from the gases. For combined removal of liquid droplets and particulates, a wet electrostatic precipitator is used. Cleaned gases from the precipitator are compressed in a compressor. Part of the gas from the compressor is recycled to the bottom of the retort to cool the combusted shale (shale ash) and carry the recovered heat back up the retort. Cooled shale ash exits the retort through the discharge grate in the bottom of the retort. After processing, shale ash is disposed of. The liquid oil is separated from produced water and may be further refined into high quality products. The mixture of evolved gases and combustions gases is available for use as a low quality fuel gas for drying or power generation.|$|R
40|$|Experimental and {{theoretical}} studies {{were carried out}} to investigate the performance of a batch, fluidized/expanded bed ion-exchange system. Exchange of scL-phenylalanine on cation exchange resin was studied in columns of 1 - 4 cm diameter and in the linear velocity range 5 - 40 cm/min. The breakthrough curves were obtained at various design and operating conditions with changing column size, <b>distributor,</b> <b>feed</b> pH, bed height, flow rate, and number of stages. ^ The breakthrough data were analyzed by two theoretical models. A CSTR-type model which is called a lumped model fitted the data well when bed aspect ratio (bed height/bed diameter) was less than 1. 5 and column diameter was 4 cm or less. The fluidized bed was considered a bed that can be well simulated by the lumped model which assumes uniform mixing for the bulk phase, and the expanded bed was considered a bed where the lumped model fails because of reduced backmixing. A packed bed model (VERSE) with axial dispersion, film diffusion, and intraparticle diffusion, fitted the data for both fluidized beds and expanded beds successfully. Experimental {{and theoretical}} results showed the bed-type changes from a fluidized bed to an expanded bed as the bed aspect ratio increases. The breakthrough curves for the expanded bed and a packed bed were almost identical except at very short times. When sieve plates were used as liquid distributors, the plate with more holes of a smaller size resulted in better sorption efficiency. Mass transfer at different flow rates and the effects of bed-type and multiple stages are discussed. ^ Intraparticle diffusion models were studied with VERSE simulations and experimental breakthrough data from packed beds. The surface diffusion model was more appropriate for this ion-exchange resin than the pore diffusion model. The parallel diffusion model was successfully used to predict column breakthrough at different conditions (feed concentration, flow rate, column diameter, and bed height) with reasonably consistent diffusivities. Mass transfer parameters in the bulk phase of fluidized/expanded beds were studied with VERSE simulations and experimental breakthrough data. Very large axial dispersion coefficients were needed for small bed aspect ratios, but packed bed correlations were successfully used for large bed aspect ratios. The study showed there is more dispersion in columns with larger diameters or shorter bed heights. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{flow loop}} system for study of fibre {{flocculation}} insuspensions has been developed. The {{system is designed}} tosimulate the flow conditions in a paper machine headbox. It isequipped with a radial <b>distributor</b> <b>feeding</b> a step diffuser pipepackage, after which the flow is contracted in a 2 -D nozzle. The flow system is also equipped with a secondary flowcontraction with an area reduction ratio of 2 : 1 after theheadbox nozzle, mimicking accelerations that may take placeduring forming. The flow system is equipped with heating andcooling devices {{for the study of}} temperature effects on fibresuspension flocculation. An online dosage device for the studyof chemical effects on fibre suspension flocculation is alsoincluded. The maximum flow velocity in the system is 16 m/s. Flowing fibre suspensions were studied using a high speedCCD video camera and transmitted infra-red laser light pulseillumination. Images were taken either separately before andafter or along the secondary contraction. Images of fibreflocculation were evaluated by power spectrum analysis, and themean floc size and the flocculation index were calculated. Aconcept of mean floc area reduction, based on power spectrum,has been introduced to characterise the fibre network insuspensions. By comparingthe fibre flocculation before andafter the secondary contraction, or by following the fibreflocs along the secondary contraction, floc rheologyinformation can be obtained. The effects of chemical additivesand fibre surface modification can also be studied by comparingthe corresponding fibre flocculation. For a bleached softwood kraft pulp suspension at a fibreconcentration of 5 g/l, the fibre flocs along the secondarycontraction have been manually evaluated, and the resultsconfirm that the power spectrum analysis is applicable. Ca 1 / 5 of the flocs were broken into two by the contraction. The meanfloc size increases in MD while in CD it decreases during theflow contraction. Both the floc aspect ratio and the flocorientation in MD increase during the flow contraction. The netfibre floc area is decreased and the fibre flocs areconcentrated by the flow contraction, which is confirmed by anincrease of gray value of the flocs in the light transmissionimages. The dewatering of fibre flocs may thus have alreadybeen started in the suspension before reaching the wires in theforming zone. Some physical influences on fibre suspension flocculationhave been investigated. The results confirm that fibreconcentration and fibre length are the dominating factorsaffecting fibre suspension flocculation. Increasing absoluteflow velocity has an insignificant effect on fibre flocs in theflow contraction. Suppressing turbulence, by increasingsuspension viscosity via a decrease of medium temperature,shows a clear effect on reducing fibre suspensionflocculation. Some chemical influences on fibre suspension flocculationhave also been investigated. A retention aid, flocculant,cationic polyacrylamide, C-PAM, increases fibre suspensionflocculation by a bridging mechanism, and a formation aid,class II, anionic polyacrylamide, A-PAM, decreases fibresuspension flocculation by suppressing turbulence. Fibresuspension flocculation can also be reduced by surfacemodification with carboxymethyl cellulose, due to a reductionof the friction between fibres. The amount of fibre dispersiondepends on the ionic form of the grafted CMC, due to theelectrostatic repulsion between negatively charged groups onthe grafted CMC moieties. Xyloglucan, a non-ionic polymer,which is strongly adsorbed on cellulosic fibre surfaces, showsa similar influence on reduction of fibre suspensionflocculation by decreasing the friction between fibres. The fibre flocculation data in the flow loop system werealso compared with the corresponding paper formation data inthe sheets produced on a pilot paper machine, both with andwithout chemical additives. The results show that the fibresuspension flocculation is well correlated with the paper sheetformation: when the fibre suspension flocculation is increased,the corresponding paper sheet formation deteriorates,especially in the large scale range...|$|R
40|$|The North West Province (NWP) {{identified}} {{dairy farming}} {{as a priority}} as it has the potential, not only for job creation, {{but also as a}} sustainable source of high quality protein for rural communities. With the correct type of management systems, small-scale dairy farms have the potential to be economically feasible. For the purposes of this study, a small-scale dairy farm was defined as a farm which produced less than 500 litres of milk a day irrespective of the number of cows or size of the farm. The study area was Central North West Province and the study was a longitudinal observational study conducted with 15 small-scale dairy farmers from 2002 - 2006. Nutrition was found to be a major constraint to the production capacity of dairy cows studied. It was found that farmers were deficient in the knowledge, skills and experience required to develop an affordable and balanced feeding system based on locally available ingredients. Dairy rations were given to prevent malnutrition or starvation, rather than to increase production. It was also shown that feeding of the cattle on the farms investigated, was influenced more by availability and affordability of locally obtained feed ingredients than by planning nutrition to increase milk production. Available statistics show that there are approximately 257 000 dairy cattle in NWP, with the greatest numbers in the Central Region (175 235) and smaller numbers in the Western (59 852) and Eastern (21 873) Regions. These cattle produced approximately 230. 4 million litres of milk annually (12. 5 % of national production) with an estimated value of R 304. 1 million at R 1. 32 /l, excluding value-added products in the form of cheese, yoghurt, milk powder, and others in 2002. The method used was a longitudinal study conducted from 2002 to 2006 in three phases. In the first phase, situational analysis using participatory rural appraisal (PRA) and observation was used to outline the extent of the constraints and start to design appropriate interventions. Feeds used by the farmers for feeding dairy cows – both supplements and roughage - were tested and evaluated. In the second phase, three different feeding systems were designed from the data obtained from PRA, in consultation with small-scale dairy farmers, established commercial dairy farmers, state veterinary and agriculture staff, <b>feed</b> manufacturers and <b>distributors</b> and the commodity organization (MPO) to optimize the nutrition of the dairy cows. The third phase was field testing of interventions and observations of the implementation by farmers. It was found during the PRA phase that the majority (n= 9) of farmers had been in dairy farming for not more than five years, five farmers had six to ten years in dairy farming and only one farmer had 11 to 15 years in dairy farming. Dairy farming is a very highly skilled operation and farmers need to have experience and knowledge to succeed. Five years is insufficient. Therefore capacity building and training were instituted over the period 2002 to 2005. Also, 60 % (n= 9) of the farmers were not affiliated to any agricultural organisation, so membership of the Milk Producers Organisation was facilitated for all farmers in the study. It was also found that the cattle were not identified and neither production nor financial records were kept. Testing and evaluation of feed used showed that it was of poor quality, deficient in protein, energy and minerals and no effort was made to balance the ration. In the second phase, three feeding systems were developed form data obtained and observations during phase one. These were A: a semi-intensive farm based ration using available crops, pastures and crop residues with minimal rations purchased; B: an intensive, zero-grazing dairy system using a total mixed ration (TMR) for farmers with smallholdings of less than 5 hectares per cow and C: Traditional, extensive or dual purpose system where the calf drank from the cow until weaning and milking was done only once a day, for farmers with more than 5 ha grazing available per cow. The last was a low-input/low output system and was implemented by a majority (n= 8) of the farmers. System B was chosen by two farmers and not adopted by any of the two farmers in the long run. System A was adopted by three farmers. Four farmers left dairy farming for various reasons during the study. By July 2006, the farmers had changed to commercially formulated rations or licks and the body condition score of the cows had improved. Milk production per cow did not increase, but this may have been due to the increased price of meat and the fact {{that a majority of the}} farmers were using a dual purpose system and selling calves at weaning for a very good price. It was concluded that extension officers should get extra training in dairy if there are dairy farmers in their areas as this is a very specialist type of extension. They should also work closely with veterinary services including veterinarians, animal health technicians and the health inspectors. Further research should be done to optimise the traditional model as this is relatively profitable, has a lower risk and is less labour intensive. It is probably a good way to increase food security, particularly in families when only one or two members have an income from a pension or part-time employment. The prices realised from informal sales of milk and calves can give a stable income. The “community farms” should be economically evaluated in terms of each beneficiary being able to get a “living wage” out of the projected profits of the farm. The MPO and other stakeholders should give very specific training to new dairy farmers, based on the models that were used in this study. It is essential that framers be taught to “look forward” and get a pro-active attitude. They must also understand that quality, balanced rations are the key to success – poor rations are expensive rations, because they result in unhealthy cows and poor production. Finally, ongoing and effective monitoring and evaluation of extension is an effective instrument for project sustainability – farmers must be involved and participate in their own evaluation - extension is not all about paper work it is about measuring performance and good service delivery.
