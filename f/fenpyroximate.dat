40|$|The coconut {{production}} system, {{in which}} the coconut mite Aceria guerreronis is considered a key pest, provides an interesting model for integration of biological and chemical control. In Brazil, the most promising biological control agent for the coconut mite is the phytoseiid predator Neoseiulus baraki. However, acaricides are widely used to control the coconut mite, although they frequently produce unsatisfactory results. In this study, we evaluated the simultaneous direct effect of dry residue contact and contaminated prey ingestion of the main acaricides used on coconut palms (i. e., abamectin, azadirachtin and <b>fenpyroximate)</b> on life-history traits of N. baraki and their offspring. These acaricides are registered, recommended and widely used against A. guerreronis in Brazil, and they were tested at their label rates.

Resistance factors for these compounds were 184, 1547, 5971 and 35, respectively. A 23. 5 -fold increase in 7 -ethoxy- 4 -trifluoromethylcoumarin O-deethylation activity suggested that metabolic resistance through elevated levels of cytochrome P 450 dependent monooxygenase-activity is a possible resistance mechanism. However, synergism studies with different metabolic inhibitors revealed some contrasting resistance mechanisms between the METI-acaricides. Tebufenpyrad resistance could only be synergized after pre-treatment with the monooxygenase inhibitor piperonyl butoxide (PBO), whereas pyridaben resistance was strongly synergized both by PBO and the esterase inhibitor S,S,S-tributylphosphorotrithioate (DEF). Resistance levels to <b>fenpyroximate</b> could neither be suppressed by PBO nor by DEF. Although METI-acaricides are structurally related, these findings probably reflect a different role of esterases and monooxygenases in metabolic detoxification between these compounds. The overall lack of synergism by diethylmaleate (DEM) suggests that glutathione-S-transferases are not {{an important factor in}} resistance to METIs.

In order to accommodate for the authorized uses in European Member States, the EMS Germany proposed to raise the existing MRLs of <b>fenpyroximate</b> in peaches, raspberries, blackberries, peppers and beans (with pods) and to lower MRLs for citrus fruit, loquat, quinces, medlar, plums, apricots, wine grapes and strawberries. No need to modify MRLs was identified for apples, pears, tomatoes and aubergines. The EMS drafted an evaluation report according to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005, which was submitted to the European Commission and forwarded to EFSA. According to EFSA, the submitted residue data are sufficient to support the lowering of the existing EU MRLs for citrus fruit, pome fruit, plums, wine grapes and strawberries. The submitted residue data on raspberries, blackberries, peppers and beans (with pods) substantiate the proposal to raise the existing EU MRL.

As such, these compounds act as drugs to mitigate bee losses but may also stress the bees. This dissertation quantifies differences between queen and worker tolerance of five acaricides and clarifies the honey bee mechanism of tolerance for coumaphos. Selected acaricides were topically applied to adult queen and worker bees to generate dose-response curves and LD 50 s. Twenty-four hours after treatment, queens were 3 -times more tolerant of tau-fluvalinate and 6 -times more tolerant of thymol than workers when adjusted for body weight differences between workers (108 mg) and queens (180 mg). Queens survived the highest administered doses of <b>fenpyroximate</b> (1620 μg/g) and coumaphos (2700 μg/g) indicating that queens are at least 12 -fold more tolerant of coumaphos and at least 40 -fold more tolerant of <b>fenpyroximate</b> than workers. However, queens treated with as little as 54 μg/g of <b>fenpyroximate</b> exhibited reduced survival over 6 weeks following treatment. Amitraz was the only acaricide tested for which queens were not more tolerant than workers. Differences between queen and worker tolerance of coumaphos was explored further by topical bioassays with the metabolite coumaphos oxon. Coumaphos oxon was only half as toxic as the parent compound to Apis mellifera. This insensitivity to both coumaphos and coumaphos oxon is unique as both castes were highly susceptible to chlorpyrifos, with chlorpyrifos oxon being twice as toxic as the parent compound. Using Ellman’s assay, honey bee and house fly acetylcholinesterase were all shown to be similarly inhibited by both chlorpyrifos oxon and coumaphos oxon. Target site insensitivity is therefore not the mechanism of honey bee tolerance. Finally, bee metabolism was compared using GC/MS and LC-MS/MS at 24 hr time intervals for 5 days. Most notably, coumaphos oxon was not found. Queen and worker acetone rinse and worker internal recovered coumaphos concentrations decreased over time. Therefore, coumaphos is likely being metabolized to a less toxic coumaphos metabolite. Caste differences are likely due to metabolism, but further {{studies are needed to}} determine specific mechanisms. Advisors: Marion Ellis 2 ̆ 6 Blair Siegfrie...|$|E

[...] et al. Pesticide risk {{assessment}} on terrestrial vertebrates {{is based on}} oral exposure of birds and mammals, being such scenario considered to cover risks to reptiles. However, topic exposure during egg incubation, as well as dermal uptake and/or overspray of pesticides once hatchlings leave the nest could constitute relevant exposure ways for reptiles. We conducted a two-stage exposure of Podarcis muralis eggs and hatchlings to three pesticides in order to analyse the effects of pesticide exposure on each developmental stage and to compare {{the relative importance of}} dermal and oral exposure of juveniles through different exposure routes. Eggs were incubated in soils previously sprayed with a pesticide solution corresponding to 40 % of the field application rate (to consider relevant crop interception) of formulations of either glufosinate ammonium (herbicide), folpet (fungicide) or <b>fenpyroximate</b> (insecticide). Eggs exposed to folpet hatched with a lower body mass than controls, whereas <b>fenpyroximate</b> showed effects on morphological differentiation. Upon hacthing, animals were assigned to a juvenile treatment consisting in the exposure through spiked soil (dermal) or food (oral) in a factorial block design considering both in-ovo and hatchling exposure. Concentrations during the hacthling exposure corresponded to 25 % of the application rate. Interestingly, egg exposure but not hatching exposure determined the body mass gain during the post-hatch stage of lizards exposed to glufosinate ammonium, which highlights the importance of considering lagged effects in pesticide {{risk assessment}}. Effects of pesticides on juveniles exposed either dermally or orally were very similar, which suggests the convenience of considering dermal exposure in risk assessment for reptiles as an additional route of pesticide uptake.

These include compounds that were widespread and frequently used in the past, but also some recently registered compounds. We investigated two T. urticae strains collected from rose growers where control failures were reported (SAN and PSE), together with a strain collected from unsprayed vegetables (BOSA). Adult females of the rose strains (SAN and PSE) were resistant to tebufenpyrad and <b>fenpyroximate</b> when compared to the susceptible BOSA strain. Lethal concentrations for these products were higher than the registered field rate. The PSE strain proved to be highly resistant to abamectin. Variation in bifenazate susceptibility was detected amongst strains, but LC 90 values of SAN and PSE were still in the range of the registered field rate. In egg bioassays, the SAN and PSE strains exhibited high resistance levels to clofentezine, hexythiazox and flufenoxuron. But the recently introduced ovi/ larvicides etoxazole and spirodiclofen exhibited high activity on all strains.

Foram testados tebufenozida, fosmete, metidationa, clorpirifós, abamectina, fenpiroximato, piridabem, captana, mancozebe (duas dosagens) e ditianona. Para o cálculo do efeito total (E%) sobre os adultos, avaliaram-se a mortalidade, a oviposição e a viabilidade dos ovos, e para os imaturos, somente a mortalidade. Os resultados do E% foram avaliados 96 horas após a pulverização. Os produtos foram classificados quanto ao efeito total (E%) de toxicidade proposta pela IOBC/WPRS. Fosmete, tebufenozida e metidationa foram inócuos; abamectina, fenpiroximato, clorpirifós, captana, mancozebe (nas duas dosagens testadas) e ditianona foram levemente nocivos, e piridabem foi moderadamente nocivo aos adultos de N. californicus. O fungicida mancozebe, na maior dosagem (320 g,i. a. / 100 L), foi o que mais afetou o ácaro predador. Quanto à seletividade dos agrotóxicos aos imaturos, constatouse que abamectina e piridabem foram moderadamente nocivos, e os demais foram inócuos. Nenhum produto foi classificado como nocivo, evidenciando a tolerância de N. californicus a estes agrotóxicos. Estes resultados permitem uma escolha e manejo mais adequado para os agrotóxicos utilizados nos pomares comerciais de macieira, de forma que a presença deste ácaro predador exerça pressão de controle do ácaro-vermelho. The {{objective of}} this study was to evaluate the side effects of the main pesticides used in adult and immature Neoseiulus californicus (McGregor) (Acari: Phytoseiidae).

It was tested tebufenozide, phosmet, methidation, chlorpyrifos, abamectin, <b>fenpyroximate,</b> pyridaben, captan, mancozeb (two concentrations) and dithianon. To calculate the total effect (E%) on the adults, it was evaluated the mortality, oviposition and viability of eggs, and for the immature ones, only the mortality. The results of E% were assessed 96 hours after the spraying. The products were classified considering the total effect (E%) of toxicity proposed by the IOBC/WPRS. Phosmet, tebufenozide and methidation were innocuous; abamectin, <b>fenpyroximate,</b> chlorpyrifos, captan, mancozeb (two concentrations), and dithianon were slightly harmful, and pyridaben was moderately harmful to the N. californicus adults.

Protegeram-se, com copos de plástico transparente de 500 mL, 64 frutos nas plantas tratadas com calda e 64 frutos nas plantas não-tratadas, totalizando 128 frutos protegidos. Decorridos 30 dias da aplicação, os frutos foram colhidos e levados para o laboratório. Estes frutos foram parcialmente parafinados, deixando-se em cada fruto uma arena de 2, 5 cm de diâmetro com verrugose e sem parafina, delimitada com cola entomológica. Em seguida, procedeu-se à aplicação sobre os frutos em Torre de Potter dos seguintes acaricidas nas concentrações expressas em mg de ingrediente ativo por litro de água: {{propargite}} a 720 mg, óxido de fenbutatina a 400 mg, cyhexatin a 250 mg, azocyclotin a 250 mg, <b>fenpyroximate</b> a 50 mg, dicofol a 960 mg e dinocap a 738 mg e a testemunha sem aplicação de acaricida.

Next lime sulfur application, 64 fruits in the plants with lime sulfur application were protected with plastic cups and others 64 fruits also were protected in the plants without lime sulfur application with plastic cups. After 30 days of field application, fruits were harvested and transported to the laboratory. These fruits were partially waxed, leaving an arena of approximately 2. 5 cm in diameter with scab and without paraffin and entrapped with entomological glue.

40|$|Background: Chemical {{analysis}} shows that honey bees (Apis mellifera) and hive products contain many pesticides derived from various sources. The most abundant pesticides are acaricides applied by beekeepers to control Varroa destructor. Beekeepers also apply antimicrobial drugs to control bacterial and microsporidial diseases. Fungicides may enter the hive {{when applied to}} nearby flowering crops. Acaricides, antimicrobial drugs and fungicides are not highly toxic to bees alone, but in combination there is potential for heightened toxicity due to interactive effects. Methodology/Principal Findings: Laboratory bioassays based on mortality rates in adult worker bees demonstrated interactive effects among acaricides, {{as well as between}} acaricides and antimicrobial drugs and between acaricides and fungicides. Toxicity of the acaricide tau-fluvalinate increased in combination with other acaricides and most other compounds tested (15 of 17) while amitraz toxicity was mostly unchanged (1 of 15). The sterol biosynthesis inhibiting (SBI) fungicide prochloraz elevated the toxicity of the acaricides tau-fluvalinate, coumaphos and <b>fenpyroximate,</b> likely through inhibition of detoxicative cytochrome P 450 monooxygenase activity. Four other SBI fungicides increased the toxicity of tau-fluvalinate in a dose-dependent manner, although possible evidence of P 450 induction was observed at the lowest fungicide doses. Non-transitive interactions between some acaricides were observed. Sublethal amitraz pre-treatment increased the toxicity of the three P 450 -detoxified acaricides, but amitraz toxicity was not changed by sublethal treatmen...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Ozone is {{a strong}} oxidizer, and we {{evaluated}} its potential to eliminate pesticides from honeycomb and empty honey bee hives. Honey bees are exposed to pesticides when foraging for nectar and pollen and when beekeepers use in-hive chemical pest control measures. Persistent pesticides can accumulate in the hive over years, potentially harming the bees. Honeycomb is removed from bee colonies for honey extraction and then placed back on the colonies at a later date, providing a time when combs could be fumigated to eliminate or reduce pesticide residues. We found that ozone gas at a rate> 920 mg O 3 /m 3 for 10 - 20 h lowers coumaphos residues on a glass surface by 93 - 100 % and tau-fluvalinate by 75 - 98 %. Ozone was less effective at eliminating pesticides on beeswax, and residues were more effectively eliminated with new combs (comb built by bees within 3 y) than with old combs (combs used by beekeepers for> 10 y). Ozone significantly reduced dimethylphenyl formamide, chlorpyrifos, and <b>fenpyroximate</b> contaminations in comb. When comb is treated with ozone, an off-odor is created, but the volatiles {{were found to be}} primarily straight chain aldehydes and carboxylic acids that are probably harmless to bees and humans. Ozone may have some utility for lowering pesticide residues in bee hives, but it would be more effective if a mechanism could be found that provides better penetration into wax, a goal no...|$|E

40|$|Consumers {{are exposed}} daily to several {{pesticide}} residues in food, {{which can be}} of potential concern for human health. Based on a previous study dealing with exposure of the French population to pesticide residues via the food, we selected 14 pesticides frequently found in foodstuffs, {{on the basis of}} their persistence in the environment or their bioaccumulation in the food chain. In a first step, the objective of this study was to investigate if the 14 selected pesticides were potentially cytotoxic and genotoxic. For this purpose, we used a new and sensitive genotoxicity assay (the γH 2 AX test, involving phosphorylation of histone H 2 AX) with four human cell lines (ACHN, SH-SY 5 Y, LS- 174 T and HepG 2), each originating from a potential target tissue of food contaminants (kidney, nervous system, colon, and liver, respectively). Tebufenpyrad was the only compound identified as genotoxic and the effect was only observed in the SH-SY 5 Y neuroblastoma cell-line. A time-course study showed that DNA damage appeared early after treatment (1 h), suggesting that oxidative stress could be responsible for the induction of γH 2 AX. In a second step, three other pesticides were studied, i. e. bixafen, <b>fenpyroximate</b> and tolfenpyrad, which - like tebufenpad - also had a methyl-pyrazole structure. All these compounds demonstrated genotoxic activity in SH-SY 5 Y cells at low concentration (nanomolar range). Complementary experiments demonstrated that the same compounds show genotoxicity in a human T-cell leukemia cell line (Jurkat). Moreover, we observed an increased production of reactive oxygen species in Jurkat cells in the presence of the four methyl-pyrazoles. These results demonstrate that tebufenpyrad, bixafen, fenpyroximat and tolfenpyrad induce DNA damage in human cell lines, very likely by a mode of action that involves oxidative stress. Nonetheless, additional in vivo data are required before a definitive conclusion can be drawn regarding hazard prediction to humans...|$|E

40|$|The cotton whitefly, Bemisia tabaci Genn. and Two-Spotted Spider Mites (TSSM), Tetranychus urticae Koch are {{emerging}} as important sucking pests of cotton crop. The indiscriminate {{use of pesticides}} against insect pests {{have resulted in the}} development of resistance among these pests as well as environmental and health hazards. The use of microbial control agents is an important approach to combat this menace. The present study was therefore, carried out to determine the efficacy of some strains of entomopathogenic fungi viz.,Metarhizium anisopliae, Isaria fumosorosea, Lecanicillium muscarium and Beaveria bassiana against all immature stages of whitefly and eggs and adult females of TSSM in the Department of Entomology at University of Agriculture, Faisalabad, Pakistan and Department of Pure and Applied Ecology, Swansea University, Swansea U. K. for the bioassays on whitefly. The potential of various entomopathogenic fungi was evaluated on 2 nd instar nymphs of whitefly and four of them were found promising. The detailed studies were carried out on other immature stages of whitefly with the promising strains. The dosemortality response was observed by using serial dilutions, 1 ï¿½ 105 to 1 ï¿½ 108 conidia mL- 1 against most susceptible stage using detached leaf immersion method for whitefly and spraying the detached leaf for bioassay with TSSM. All tested fungal isolates caused mortality in the tested stages of both insects under consideration except eggs of whitefly for which very low susceptibility was observed. The L. muscarium (V 17) isolate was highly virulent among the tested ones for whitefly nymphs while Pf (n 32) isolate was highly virulent against both the stages of TSSM. The mortality of each stage was recorded daily up to 8 days for both the insects under study. The % mortality significantly differed based on fungal isolates, stage of the insect and conidial concentrations. The % mortality increased with increasing the dose of conidial concentration of each fungal isolate in each insect. For whitefly, the most virulent isolate, (V 17) has LC 50 value of 1. 9 ï¿½ 105 conidia mL- 1 and it killed about 89. 58 % of the treated second instar nymphs 8 days post treatment while its LT 50 value at higher concentration is 4. 03 days. For TSSM, the most virulent isolate was Pf (n 32) with lowest LC 50 value of 9. 1 ï¿½ 104 conidia mL- 1 on 8 th day and LT 50 value of 4. 58 days at 1 ï¿½ 108 conidia mL- 1. It killed about 82. 16 % of the inoculated females 8 days post treatment. The results indicated that L. muscarium and I. fumosorosea strains have potential as microbial control agent against cotton whitefly and mites, respectively, in Pakistan. The studies were also carried out to determine the LC 50 values and also efficacy of some commercial insecticides and acaricides against whitefly and TSSM in the laboratory. Four different insecticides were evaluated in the lab against 2 nd instar nymphs of whitefly on cotton. All the tested insecticides caused significant mortality of whitefly from 3 - 5 days post treatment. However, the most effective insecticides for whitefly, up to 5 days were Mospilonï¿½ and Confidorï¿½ with very low LC 50 values while others were also equally effective but with high LC 50 values. Similarly, the chlorfenapyr 36 SC, pyridaben 15 EC and <b>fenpyroximate</b> 5 SC proved to be the best miticides among the tested ones for the control of TSSM based on their LC 50 values. The nine commercial pesticides and their effects on germination of conidia and mycelial growth of highly efficacious fungal strains viz., I. fumosorosea and L. muscarium were investigated in vitro. There was a significant variation in conidial germination as well as mycelial growth by all tested pesticides depending upon the dose of pesticide and type of fungus. Among the pesticides tested azocyclotin was proved to be highly toxic to germination of spores as well as mycelial growth followed by pyridaben, acetamiprid and propergite while buprofezin was the least toxic. Isaria was proved to be more sensitive at field recommended doses than Lecanicillium strain to all pesticides. Generally, among all pesticides used the insecticides were more compatible to fungi than acaricides although these also inhibited germination of spores and fungal growth to some extent. The combined application of pesticides with selective fungi proved to be synergistic giving more control than used alone. The combined effects were tested under greenhouse conditions on potted plants. Buprofezin, acetamiprid, imidacloprid and diafenthuron were used against 2 nd instar nymphs of whitefly while chlorfenapyr, pyridaben and <b>fenpyroximate</b> were used against TSSM. Only buprofezin and imidacloprid insecticides showed synergistic effects and others additive while no one showed antagonistic results. Chlorfenapyr combined with fungus yielded highest mortality among acaricides tested. However, further investigations under field conditions may reveal more comprehensive results...|$|E
