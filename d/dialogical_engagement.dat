This allows for the production and co-creation of knowledge with them, as well as bringing to them feminist political economic and political ecological analyses, which together contest neoliberal globalization.Training is accomplished though the creation of training institutes, which act as spaces for intensive participatory education. This provides an avenue for the dissemination and mobilization of knowledge, so that new feminists can use it for change.|$|E
40|$|After {{reviewing}} {{a representative}} sample of current and historical research in religious fundamentalism, the author addresses the epistemological presuppositions supporting both quantitative and qualitative methodologies and argues for epistemological flexibility and metamethodology, both of which support and are supported by metatheoretical thinking. Habermas’ concept of the scientistic self-understanding of the sciences is used to point up the limitations of positivist epistemology, especially in the context of fundamentalism research. A metamethodological approach, supported by epistemological flexibility, makes <b>dialogical</b> <b>engagement</b> between researchers and those they research possible, and an example of how this would look in an actual research design is provided. The article concludes with a theoretical statement and graphic representation of a model for <b>dialogical</b> <b>engagement</b> between Western scholars and non-Western religious fundamentalists. Such engagement, the author argues, is necessary before any real progress on the “problem” of radicalized fundamentalism can be made...|$|E

40|$|Building on {{original}} ethnographic work {{carried out}} in a cosmopolitan, multicultural British context, {{as well as on}} <b>dialogical</b> <b>engagements</b> with textile experts, artists and designers, this study prioritizes — in an attempt to fill a void in the existing literature — the analysis of privately-informed, emotional, spiritual, artistic, idiographic (versus public, political/ideological, or class-related) aspects of modest gear appropriation. Drawing {{on a wide range of}} scholarship, from anthropology, history and fashion studies to psychology and design theory, the project looks into the creative individuations and taste (in) formation mechanisms of contemporary modest wear, with a particular stress on the Islamic headscarf. In concrete terms, the focus falls on agency-driven, (micro) cultural and psycho-sartorial dynamics of hijab observance, and the ways these are enmeshed, in real life cases, within a socio-biographical tableau of a far more complex facture than has been generally acknowledged. I will evidence throughout how, alongside publicly-evident aspects, there can, indeed, exist an incredibly rich depth 'inside' a textile's surface. Above all, the nexus of relationships between (material) dress, as it is worn and/or created by a subject at a given point in time, and its (immaterial) projections into the person's imagination, memory, and value system — in other words, the idiographic, often self-enhancing experience resulting from its wearing or making — will be brought to the fore...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{originates}} {{from the}} realization that the pedagogy of history is becoming dangerously obsolete, as it does not always relate to the contemporary needs of 21 st century learners, who often find learning history irrelevant to their present situation. This challenge is attributed to, among other reasons, the way history is taught employing largely behaviorist pedagogies with significantly reduced active learner engagement and little alignment to the way today's students learn. Gadamer's historical hermeneutic theory was employed to advocate for a dialogical approach between the past (part) and the present (whole) mediated by Emerging Technologies, specifically Wikis. Thus, the study is guided by three research questions: firstly, how is historicity constructed on the Wiki platform among pre-service teachers at Makerere University? Secondly, how is authenticity of history meanings constructed among pre-service teachers? Thirdly, what design principles guide a pedagogical framework for construction of historicity? A Design Based Research Methodology (DBR), with theoretically informed solutions aligned to the study problem, was used among pre-service teachers enrolled at Makerere University, Uganda, for the period 2013 - 2016. Consequently, four phases of DBR were employed: identification of the problem by the researcher in collaboration with practitioners; development of solutions informed by existing design principles and technological innovation; iterative cycles of testing and refinement of solutions and finally, reflection to produce design principles and enhance solutions (Reeves, 2006). Data from questionnaires, interviews and observations on the Wiki was gathered and analyzed through a hermeneutic cycle-driven analysis during DBR phase three. Key findings demonstrated that historicity is constructed through <b>dialogical</b> <b>engagements</b> between educator/researcher and students mediated on the Wiki. Authenticity of history meanings is achieved through collaborative editing, reviewing and sharing understandings on a Wiki. The practical contribution of this research lies in the creation of design principles (i. e. connecting with the present, appreciating heritage, dialogue in history, doing history, validating history and applying history) and a pedagogical framework to be used for the construction of historicity mediated by Wikis, while the theoretical contribution lies in the methodological approach of using DBR to systematically implement and operationalize historical hermeneutics theoretical constructs in History Education in the Ugandan context...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: This paper aims {{to argue}} that climate justice {{constitutes}} a contested discourse reflecting the material interests of social groups that contribute to its production. For climate justice to have integrity, it must be rooted in the material interests of those social groups negatively affected by, and engaged in struggles against, the hydrocarbon economy. The paper locates contestation of discourse production in an understanding of social movement processes. Design/methodology/approach: The paper is a theoretical contribution to the debate about climate justice, drawing on data (published and unpublished) from Scotland. Findings: The paper concludes that scholars engaged in climate justice work should have consideration to the material interest embedded in the discourse. The pedagogical and <b>dialogical</b> work of <b>engagement</b> with the militant particularism of local struggles against the hydrocarbon industry is {{an important contribution to}} discourse construction, and ultimately social transformation is required to achieve climate justice. Research limitations/implications: This is primarily a theoretical paper, although it draws on limited case study data from environmental conflicts in Scotland. Practical implications: The argument has practical implications for work in climate justice, including research, policy development and social movement mobilisation. Social implications: This is intended as a contribution to the social transformation required to achieve climate justice. Originality/value: The paper draws on existing theoretical frameworks, especially Marxian approaches to discourse and social movement studies, to critique and contribute to the newly developing field of climate justice. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited...|$|R

40|$|The {{interpersonal}} {{dimension of}} language use has attracted {{growing interest in}} English for Academic Purposes (EAP) for its important role in representing the writer’s evaluative position in a text and in constructing successful interpersonal relationship between the writer and the reader. The present study explores the construction of evaluative meanings in English for second/foreign language (ESL/EFL) writing under exam conditions – still an under-explored area in EAP research. This study analyses short argumentative essays written in response to Task 2 of the Academic Writing Module of the International English Language Testing Systems (IELTS) as a high-stakes gatekeeping genre by drawing on Appraisal theory and Genre theory developed within Systemic Functional Linguistics (SFL) {{as well as the}} theory of intertextuality. In so doing, it focuses on the linguistic and rhetorical resources deployed by IELTS writers to construct the intersubjective relationship between the writer and the reader and the intertextual relationship between the task prompt and the exam script. The findings of the research demonstrate that there are differences in linguistic choices of evaluative resources depending on grades awarded. Specifically, the study provides important insights into the distinguishing features of successful and less successful IELTS texts in terms of the degree of the writer’s <b>dialogical</b> or subjective <b>engagement</b> with the reader as well as the degree of intertextual density between the examination response and the task prompt as construed in the choice of what is evaluated (i. e. appraised). The results suggest that the evaluative patterns which can be identified through the different ‘voices’ that the IELTS writer projects in the IELTS task provide insights into what is valued in more successful IELTS writing. The study makes a significant contribution {{to our understanding of the}} interpersonal expectations which are ‘hidden’ or implicit in the current IELTS assessment criteria in the public domain. The tentative framework on intertextuality put forward in the study extends the current description of engagement resources captured in the existing Appraisal theory.

At the taskforce meeting on December 18 2006 initial formulations of its objective included “educate, get rid of ignorance,” “advocate and push for CCS implementation in Member States” and “provide information but also sell CCS.” The assumption within the taskforce appears to have been that its role was to provide ways to frame CCS efficiently and positively, and discussion summaries indicate a conscious effort to establish at least an appearance of <b>dialogical</b> <b>engagement</b> with autonomous publics, recommending {{the use of the term}} “‘inform’ rather than ‘educate’ (too arrogant).” [...]...|$|E

Calls for increasing student participation in mathematics classroom from K- 12 settings (e. g., National Council of Teachers of Mathematics [NCTM], 2000) have been promoted also at the tertiary level (Blair, 2006), specifically for moving from a ‘teacher centered ’ paradigm of instruction towards a ‘student centered ’ one.

Following from Tileagă’s work and Power’s critique, we must continue on to question if resolution of conflict is, in fact, possible when individuals are being dehumanized. The arguments Power puts forward are persuasive. The linear model proposed by Tileagă is simplistic, and the analysis flawed and underdeveloped. Considering the data Tileagă presented, Power suggests a model of <b>dialogical</b> <b>engagement</b> where there are two possibilities: firstly, further distancing of self from other, which has the possibility of escalating into actual violence, or secondly, a change in perspective where self can identify with the other through perspective taking and recognition.

40|$|This article {{seeks to}} explore {{something}} {{of the significance of}} the notion of necessary non-apodicity as a leitmotif for the reading of sacred text in the context of Christian-Muslim <b>dialogical</b> <b>engagement.</b> Far from being a contentious challenge to received traditions of the status and reception of our respective scriptures, it contends that the notion of an inherent requirement to apply hermeneutic tools and approaches to sacred text is a mark of the mode of divine revelation as such. The absolute word of God was and is spoken into and through multifarious concrete contexts; the apprehension of the divine message throughout changing contexts and differing situations is thus intended to invite interpretive engagement necessarily. Or, put otherwise, the hermeneutical task that necessarily applies to the reading of scripture suggests that the sacred text of divine revelation is marked by necessary non-apodicity. In exploring this idea further, the article addresses some general issues of Christian and Muslim perspectives on sacred text then turns to an examination of the 2007 letter, 'A Common Word', from Muslims to Christians that seeks a renewed emphasis on dialogue...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the findings of}} a research project on older workers transitioning into work as vocational educators through online undergraduate university study. The study involved interpretive phenomenological analysis of the experiences of 10 older learners. Their experience of online learning was found to be shaped by diverse influences and to comprise three distinct but interrelated elements: their use of technology, their use of hypermedia and their independent learning. Challenges raised by each of these elements called for a distinctive response from the university, respectively: short-term, readily available technical advice and support; tutoring to develop Web navigation and exploration skills, or the provision of selected readings; and opportunities for online or face-to-face <b>dialogical</b> <b>engagement</b> with others. Recommendations for the online provision of higher education for such learners, then, pointed to the need for an appropriately distinctive response to challenges {{in each of the three}} elements: the use of technology calling for individualised and immediate responsiveness to learner issues; the use of hypermedia calling for aggregated advice and resources prepared in advance; and independent learning calling for the prior structuring of opportunities for interactive engagement. Further research is suggested focusing on the relative cost and effectiveness of different approaches to addressing those needs.

40|$|Social {{representations}} {{are produced}} and reproduced through social interactions. Gerard Duveen made {{an important contribution}} by revealing the subtle processes through which the microgenetic production of knowledge is constrained by the identity relations between the participants in an interaction. Relations of symmetry and asymmetry constrain what can be said and heard. In this paper, we show how these ideas yield fruitful analyses {{in the context of}} two research projects. First, in a project concerning professional advice-giving by Health Visitors to parents, we elucidate the identity stakes involved in offering, receiving and resisting advice. Giving advice is not simply presenting new knowledge, it re-positions the advice-giver and advice- receiver with complex consequences for each person’s knowledge and action. Second, in an experimental study of communication conflict we show how hierarchical identity positions constrain what can be both said and heard. Across both studies, we draw attention to the processes allowing speaking and listening on the one hand, or self- silencing and dismissing on the other. To take this line of inquiry further, we conclude by suggesting directions for future research, calling for investigations of how specific identity content and identity relations mediate knowledge construction, and for studies of the kinds of social contexts that might make transformative <b>dialogical</b> <b>engagement</b> more likely...|$|E
40|$|This thesis raises {{concerns}} about current heritage practice regarding notions of inclusivity, {{the agency of}} audiences and the authority of heritage institutions, such as museums. Experts including Tony Bennet (1998), Graham Black (2005), and Eileen Hooper-Greenhill (1994) claim that recent developments in heritage practice have directed museums towards offering experiences that invite active, participatory viewing, rather than that which is passive, or merely receptive. Similarly, {{in the field of}} contemporary art practice Grant Kester and Claire Bishop argue the importance of audiences’ participation, inclusivity and agency to current approaches. Evidently, certain standpoints within the literature concerned with each of these fields, state an attitude of sensitivity to imbalances of power between audiences and either artistic or heritage practices. However, this thesis recognizes and demonstrates that authoritative, or hierarchical approaches to audiences exist within each field, and guided by poststructurally informed theoretical perspectives, it confronts these approaches. Moreover, this thesis claims to establish a unique, interactive and practical autoethnographic approach to artistic research, which supported by its theoretical perspectives, generates non-authoritative and democratic methods. In particular, this thesis establishes that, <b>dialogical</b> <b>engagement</b> prompted by audiences’ responses to artistic situations and aesthetic objects, results in non-authoritative, or democratic encounters with heritage and contemporary art...|$|E

40|$|James Gillray (1756 - 1815) {{produced}} maritime themed prints {{that were}} responses to Britain’s contemporary naval wars against revolutionary and Napoleonic France (1793 - 1815). Diverse visual representations, publications, theatre performances {{and the press}} informed Gillray and his audiences’ interpretations of the Navy, loyalist patriotism and emerging notions of national identity. This thesis shows that Gillray’s discursive position towards naval actualities, symbolism, heroic representation and monumental sculpture are evident in his work, particularly concerning the characters of the sailor Jack Tar, the officer Horatio Nelson, and the contemporary sculptural projects of St. Paul’s Cathedral and the Naval Pillar. Through distortion of the representational resources of high art, Gillray derided official representations of naval heroism {{and the culture of}} patriotic public display within which they existed, attacking their idealism, socio-political exclusivity and links with loyalist propaganda and excess. This thesis interprets Gillray’s work as being indicative of his political ambivalence and critical attitude towards the establishment and cultural pretension. It is argued that Gillray’s oeuvre demonstrates his <b>dialogical</b> <b>engagement</b> with, and perceptive awareness and exploitation of, the relationships between, official and unofficial discourses.

Therefore, the human-becoming school of thought (Parse, 1981, 1998, 2007, 2010) was an appropriate choice of theoretical perspective to underpin this study. The purposes of this research study were to: discover and explicate {{the structure of the}} lived experience of feeling grateful as a universally lived phenomenon, contribute to the advancement of nursing knowledge through a scientifically rigorous process enhancing the theory of humanbecoming (Parse, 2007), and add to the body of knowledge about the phenomenon of feeling grateful.

Using the Parse methodology, {{the purpose of this}} project was to explore the challenges faced by inpatient hospice facility night shift nursing staff in providing a continuum of care for dying patients and their families. Nine night shift hospice nurses participated in 45 - 60 minute interviews.

The core concepts addressed by the participants were feeling isolated and disrespected, staff development, and using coping strategies.

In {{a sample of}} healthy participants (N = 325), 108 participants reported H&H AVHs and answered subsequent questions on their phenomenology. AVHs in the H&H state were found (1) to {{be more likely to}} only feature the occasional clear word than to be clear, (2) to be more likely to be one-off voices than to be recurrent voices, (3) to be more likely to be voices of people known to the individual than unknown persons, (4) to be more likely to talk directly to the person rather than not, and (5) to only rarely give commands, ask questions, or to result in an interactive conversation. Their phenomenology was similar to normative AVHs in wakefulness (as established by previous research) in that the voice-hearer was usually the target of the voice, and the voice was more likely to be of a recognized person. However, H&H AVHs differed from AVHs in wakefulness in that commands and questions were rare, and there was typically no <b>dialogical</b> <b>engagement</b> with the voice. We conclude by proposing that two distinct types of H&H AVHs may exist (which we term "dialogic" and "monologic"), based on an analysis of the phenomenology of the experience, and suggest avenues for future research. 12 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Since the {{publication}} of Joseph Conrad’s novella Heart of Darkness, published in serial form in 1899, there were several texts that purported to ‘rewrite’ the Conrad text. Often {{the relationship with the}} master text was remote, if not tenuous. Another rewriting of Conrad’s text came with {{the publication}} of Eben Venter’s Trencherman, first published under the Afrikaans title Horrelpoot. This text studiously mimicked the master text not only by using excerpts from it as epigraphs to each chapter, but overtly and covertly wove images and words from the Urtext into its narrative. The questions confronting a reader like myself, who is not conversant with Afrikaans, were whether this was an act of plagiarism or an exercise in intertextuality; or whether this was an act of sensationalism designed to promote sales. These questions formed the basis of an intertextual exploration of both texts. What followed was a close reading of Conrad’s text, side-by-side with Trencherman to identify their intertextual links. The theoretical basis was provided by Kristeva and Barthes. The investigation confirmed that Trencherman was indeed an exercise in intertextuality, not simply qua intertextuality but rather as a <b>dialogical</b> <b>engagement</b> with the Conradian master text. The conclusion arrived at was that Trencherman validated itself as an intertextual response to deconstruct the Conrad text and to transpose its scenario to a dystopian, post-democratic South Africa...|$|E
40|$|Similar {{tendencies in}} the work of {{philosophers}} Ludwig Wittgenstein and Jacques Derrida appear in their thoughts on language and lead to similarities in their respective ethical thought. Their views are such that {{the way in which they}} conceive the operation of meaning lead to a stance that rejects the possibility of total knowledge or command of concepts, and therefore refuses the idea of a "correct" account of meaning, morality, history, knowledge, and so on. This thesis is an attempt to identify and elaborate the overlap between Wittgenstein and Derrida's work in light of the role that proper names play in their philosophies of language and ethics. The philosophical account of proper names is important because it clarifies the view of subjectivity and also serves as a model for understanding the general operation of language. The fact that we are revealed to be inextricably dependent on the "otherness" of other people in order for each of us to be "selves" implies we are indebted to others and therefore must initiate any ethical project based on that indebtedness. Furthermore, the instability of language insures that we cannot have the "correct" interpretation of all concepts and must therefore maintain a certain charity in our <b>dialogical</b> <b>engagement</b> with others. This thesis argues in favour of the ethical stance that results from Wittgenstein and Derrida's perspective...|$|E
40|$|In {{my thesis}} I {{explain why the}} common, pre-theoretical {{understanding}} of morality {{is an important part}} of Kant’s ethics, and I critically evaluate what the strengths and weaknesses are of doing ethics with the common perspective as a point of reference. In chapter 1, I discuss the significance of common rational capacities for the deduction in Groundwork III as well as for the Fact of Reason. Attention to the fundamental role of common rational capacities in the Second Critique reveals that Kant intends to provide further warrant for the Fact than its introspective self-evidence. In chapter 2, I discuss what it means for a rational agent to be endowed with common rational capacities. The agent has everything she needs to reason on her own about what she ought to do and act from rational judgements. Furthermore, I critically evaluate Kant’s claim that his ethics spells out fundamental, pre-theoretical convictions. In chapter 3, I discuss Kant’s conception of rationalizing (“Vernünfteln”). I analyse rationalizing as a process of self-deception in which an agent tries to justify or excuse violations of the moral law. This can lead to loss of the reliable use of common rational capacities. I discuss what help critical practical philosophy and moral education can afford against rationalizing. In chapter 4, I argue that Kant saw <b>dialogical</b> <b>engagement</b> with ordinary agents as an important way of obtaining data concerning the correct starting point of practical philosophy. Kant demands that whatever we get from dialog and observation has to be isolated from its contingent elements. I conclude that the main problem for Kant’s method is how we can, on the one hand, exclude non-rational content, and, on the other hand, be open to what other agents actually have to say about morality...|$|E
40|$|The growing {{acknowledgement}} {{of the value of}} listening to children's views and experiences in social research, popularly termed as “listening to their voices,” brings with it methodological consequences. Regarding children as expert informants about their own lives carries with it the simultaneous call for researchers to be experts in developing and employing appropriate strategies that can effectively elicit the insights that children can bring to a research topic. With younger children, the use of participatory methodologies has been foregrounded as the key to unlocking their potential to contribute rich and useful perspectives to inform research into their lives. This article explores the usefulness of employing preschoolers' drawings {{within the context of a}} co-construction process to facilitate the children's construction of ideas and reinforce their voices in research. The case is made that the quality of the <b>dialogical</b> <b>engagement</b> is as important as the drawing itself, and both visual images and the verbal exchanges are central to the children's meaning-making process. In the co-construction process, both adult and child are (ideally) equal players and the resulting dialogical process plays a major role in the constitution of the phenomena. The role of the researcher as the co-constructor can be a challenging one because it entails engaging and supporting children's views and the expression of these views. The discussion and illustrations from the first author's research projects contribute to the literature base on positioning preschool children as valid social actors in their communities. We operate through an ethos of empowerment of all participants, and aim for participatory research practice which has at its heart an active involvement in promoting the rights of children as citizens with voice and power.

40|$|Participation {{has been}} linked with better health {{outcomes}} for young people {{in a range of}} settings, with an extensive literature extolling the benefits of a participatory approach to youth-focused HIV-prevention programs in particular. However the processes of participation, and how the ideals outlined in the participation literature can be achieved in the difficult circumstances in which many youth health promotion programs operate, are less often discussed. This thesis responds to calls for more nuanced documentation of situated participatory practices by developing a detailed and contextualised analysis of youth participation in a Photovoice project in the Highlands of Papua New Guinea. The analysis draws upon data generated over a ten-month period (photo-stories, individual interviews, written accounts of participation, group discussions, artefacts produced during participatory analysis, and field-notes) to describe how participation in a project of self-reflection and self-representation can support <b>dialogical</b> <b>engagement</b> and the demonstration of critical thinking. The thesis explores the relationship between these psycho-social changes and young people’s subsequent ability to enact strategies to improve their health and well-being. Findings challenge idealised representations of youth participation, demonstrating that young people’s ability to act is mediated and bounded by the health-related contexts in which they live. They also demonstrate a disconnect between youth health priorities and the priorities of the programs ‘targeting’ them; and point to the importance of HIV-prevention programs working to support ‘in-between’ spaces where youth and community leaders can connect in order to affect wider social environments. In providing a detailed examination of a Photovoice process, this thesis extends the theoretical basis of an increasingly popular participatory research tool. In analysing the relationship between young people’s participation in a research project and their ability to take action on health, this thesis also contributes to social psychological understandings of the pathways through which participation may impact upon health, and in particular affect efforts to prevent HIV.

40|$|Marginalized {{students}} face disparities {{that impact}} {{their ability to}} successfully navigate higher education. Educational institutions that provide spaces for these students to express and explore their experiences can create a foundation for their academic and social development throughout their collegiate experience. Hip Hop Theater is an emerging subgenre rooted in Hip Hop culture that uses {{some or all of}} the five elements of Hip Hop to express the narratives of underrepresented identities and communities. It serves as a platform to voice the stories of those silenced across generations. Hip Hop Theater becomes a space of learning, understanding, and exchanging ideas amongst artists and audiences to incite a stronger engagement with the various topics and sociopolitical issues experienced by marginalize communities that are addressed in the productions. Exploring professional and student-based sites of Hip Hop Theater, this work observes the genre?s utility in educational spaces through a textual analysis of three prominent productions, Manikin, Rose Gold, and Break the Cycle, written by scholars within a Hip Hop arts program in higher education. This analysis examines Hip Hop Theater as a site for evoking critical consciousness in the authors, performers, and potentially audience members in educational spaces. It highlights the transformative and empowering aspects of the genre for the authors and performers with data collected from ethnographic interviews. This work further analyzes the <b>dialogical</b> <b>engagement</b> talk backs offer to ignite the necessary conversations that produce positive change for underrepresented students in higher education. Hip Hop Theater is analyzed as a versatile and accessible artistic genre that can empower, transform, educate, and inspire by providing a platform for the expression and reclamation of underrepresented identities and experiences in higher education. This work establishes a format for Social Justice Theater that can be used as a method in multicultural educational spaces, highlighting Hip Hop Theater?s utility as a form of Social Justice Theater. This work concludes with Hip Hop Theater?s applicability in secondary education, higher education, and non-profit arts-based initiatives that serve marginalized youth. It explores Hip Hop Theater?s as an alternative mode of knowledge production that values embodied knowledge and helps marginalized students evolve their own critical consciousness of their lived experiences both within and outside of academia...|$|E
40|$|The broader aim of {{this study}} is to probe {{participation}} of learners in waste management activities in selected primary schools in Botswana and through these activities, explore opportunities for action competence development. The study starts by tracing and outlining the socio-ecological challenges that confront children and the historical background of learner-centred education which gave rise to an emphasis on learner participation in Botswana education policy. It then maps out the development of children's participation in the global, regional and Botswana contexts by tracing the development of environmental education from early ecological and issue resolution goals of environmental education to sustainable development discourses. The focus is on policy issues and how learner participation has been represented and implemented in environmental education. The study then probes the rhetorical and normalised emphases on participation, and seeks further insight into how learners can be engaged in participatory learning processes that are meaningful, purposeful and that broaden their action competence and civic agency. The study uses the Cultural Historical Activity Theory (CHAT) methodology to build a picture of waste management activity systems in primary schools and to bring to the surface contradictions and tensions in learner participation in these activity systems. These contradictions are used to open up expansive learning participatory processes with learners using the Danish action competence framework. The expansive learning process uses action competence models that provide potential for transformative participation with learners, and new and different opportunities for learner participation. Case study research was used and conducted in the south eastern region of Botswana in three primary schools in three contexts, namely urban, peri-urban and rural. The data was largely generated through focus group interviews during workshops with children and observations of waste management activities. These two methods formed the main data generation methods. They were complemented by semi-structured interviews with teachers, and other actors in the waste management activities, learners' activities and work, learners' notes, photographs and children's drawings as well as show-and-tell explanations by learners. Content analysis and the abductive mode of inference were used to analyse data in all three case studies. Findings from the first phase of the study reveal that participation of learners in waste management activities was largely teacher-directed. This resulted in a mis-match between teachers views of what practices are necessary and important, and children's views of what practices are necessary and important in and for environmental education. Due to culturally and historically formed views of environmental education, the study reveals that teachers wanted children to pick up litter, and this was their primary environmental education concern. Learners on the other hand, identified sanitation management in the school toilets as their primary waste management concern. Teachers had not considered this an environmental education concern. Using the action competence expansive learning approach, the second phase of the study addressed this tension by opening up dialogue between teachers and learners and amongst the learners themselves through an expansive learning process supporting children's participation and action competence development. Through this teacher-learner <b>dialogical</b> <b>engagement,</b> a broader range of possibilities became available and ideas around participation were radically changed. The study further reveals that the achievement of this open dialogue provided for a better relationship within the school community. And with improved communication came better ideas to solve waste management issues that the community still face on a daily basis, such as too much litter. Newly devised solutions were practical and had a broader impact than the initial ones that teachers had always focussed on. They included mobilising the maintenance of toilets, landscaping the school premises and even re-contextualising the litter management that had always caused tensions between learners and teachers. Children seemed to be developing not only a better understanding of the environment, but also developing the ability to resolve conflict amongst themselves and with their elders. By engaging in dialogue with children, they became co-catalysts for change in the school community. This study shows that if children's participation is taken seriously, and if opportunities for dialogue exist between teachers and children, positive changes for a healthier environment can be created in schools. It reveals that children also appeared to be feeling more confident and more equipped to consider changes in their environment outside of the school community. The study further shows that participation in environmental education involves more than cognitive changes as proposed in earlier constructivist literature; it includes in-depth engagement with socio-cultural dynamics and histories in the school context, such as the cultural histories of teachers, schooling and authority structures in the cultural community of the school. The study recommends that there is need to strengthen Teacher Education programmes to develop teaching practices and support for teachers to identify ways of engaging learners' views on issues in the school in open, dialogical ways. Such Teacher Education programmes should deepen teachers' understandings of learners' zone of proximal development (ZPD), demonstrating how dialogue and scaffolding are part of a teacher's role in supporting learning. This is shown in the three case studies that form part of this study. Finally, the study also deepens insights of using the Cultural Historical Activity theory (CHAT) to shed light on issues surrounding learner participation within the socio-cultural and historical environmental education contexts of the schools. The action competence models used in the study provide a tool for revealing forms of learner participation. This tool can be used for critical reflections and monitoring of teaching practices in schools...|$|E
