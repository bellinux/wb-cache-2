We will drive out after luncheon, and pay a round of visits." [...] When this prospect was placed before me, I remembered having read in books of sensitive persons receiving impressions which made their blood run cold; I now found myself one of those persons, {{for the first time}} in my life. [...] "In the meanwhile," [...] Mrs. Roylake continued, [...] "I must tell you--excuse me for laughing; it seems so very absurd that you should not know who Lord Uppercliff's daughters are--I must tell you that Lady Rachel is the eldest. She is married to the Honorable Captain Millbay, of the Navy, now away in his ship. A person of extraordinary strength of mind (I don't mean the Captain; I mean Lady Rachel); I admire her intellect, but her political and social opinions I must always view with regret. Her younger sister, Lady Lena--not married, Gerard; remember that!--is simply the most charming girl in England. If you don't fall in love with her, you will be the only young man in the county who has resisted Lady Lena. Poor Sir George--she refused him last week; you really must have heard of Sir George; our member of parliament; conservative of course; quite broken-hearted about Lady Lena; gone away to America to shoot bears. You seem to be restless. What are you fidgeting about? Ah, <b>I</b> <b>know!</b> <b>You</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> smoke after breakfast. Well, I won't be in your way. Go out on the terrace; your poor father always took his cigar on the terrace. They say smoking leads to meditation; I leave you to meditate on Lady Lena.

It was not, as you seem to remember, with the sight of Mr. Mitchett that the {{question}} of Aggie's hand began to occupy me. I should be ashamed of myself if it weren't constantly before me and if I hadn't my feelers out in more quarters than one. But I've not so much as thought of Mr. Mitchett--who, rich as he may be, is the son of a shoemaker and superlatively hideous--for a reason I don't at all mind telling you. Don't be outraged if I say that I've for a long time hoped you yourself would find the right use for him." [...] She paused--at present with a momentary failure of assurance, from which she rallied, however, to proceed with a burst of earnestness that was fairly noble. [...] "Forgive me if I just tell you once for all how it strikes me, I'm stupefied at your not seeming to recognise either your interest or your duty. Oh <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to,</b> but you appear to me--in your perfect good faith of course--utterly at sea. They're one and the same thing, don't you make out? your interest and your duty. Why isn't it convincingly plain to you that the thing to do with Nanda is just to marry her--and to marry her soon? That's the great thing--do it while you CAN. If you don't want her downstairs--at which, let me say, I don't in the least wonder--your remedy is to take the right alternative. Don't send her to Tishy--" ...|$|E

40|$|Translation begins] Darling- Rather {{my darling}} Lieutenant Just arrived home from New York. I’m so glad you’re a Lieutenant! But, honey, there’s one thing. We’ve {{got to get}} married down there. I have a funny feeling about that darling + I {{honestly}} {{think it would be}} much better for everyone if we were married down here. Here {{are a few of the}} reasons. First, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> get married on the day you graduate. 2. I want to get married on the day you graduate 3. We’re going down to see you graduate anyway. 4. Mother will have a two week vacation if we go down. I we don’t then she’ll work herself into a complete collapse rushing around making plans for the wedding + the reception. 5. it’s much less expensive this way. 6. I want to get married down there in the army chapel. 7. Mother wants to see the south. She’s never been there + this will be the only chance she has. 8. Mother + I had a real long talk + she said no matter what she + Hilda + I were going down south to see you graduate + get married. 9. Oh, honey, I can’t remember the other reasons now but please darling, let’s get married down there. I want it that way + I’m sure you do too- no matter what you may say. Oh, about the night letter. That might be slightly confusing because I added a few sentences in there. Mother wrote, “Wedding plans unchanged- leaving March 7 th”. And the reason I wrote as you probably gathered. Oh, honey, I’m so glad that you are a Lieutenant. You’re going to be the handsomest officer. Really, though, honey, the only thing to do is have the wedding down there. Please, honey, it means so much to me. I’d be broken hearted if you said you didn’t want to get married down there. Really, I would. I’ve counted on it so, Judd. You don’t know how much it means to me. I’m so sorry that I wasn’t here when you called honey. I’m so upset about now. You haven’t any idea how much we’ve all counted on this. Judd, honey, what has happened that made you change your mind. Golly, darling, have you forgotten you said you were going to marry me March 11 th- I haven’t. Honey, it would be so unreasonable to have it at home. Hilda + mother + I are so excited about the trip + getting married down there. If you could have seen how disappointed we all were you never would have suggested it. No, honey, it would be awful to have the wedding here. I was so disappointed. I was sure they were fooling when they told me that you said you wanted to get married home. Honey, I know you don’t- you just can’t. Honey, it’s awfully late. I hope you call tomorrow. I’ll send this air mail special. Hope you get it soon. Honey, you couldn’t mean it when you said you didn’t want us to come down to see you graduate. Getting your wings means more to you than anything else and, honey, I want to be with you then. It’s the most important moment in your life and, honey, please don’t say you don’t want me to be there. I love you so, my darling. I mean sir- should I be more formal now, Lieutenant? Goodnight, darling, I love you with all my heart. Always, Dottie [Translation ends...|$|E
