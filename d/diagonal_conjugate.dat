40|$|Introduction: Clinical pelvimetry is {{very uncomfortable}} {{for the patient}} and is {{associated}} with subjective error, while external pelvimetry is a simple and acceptable method for patients. The objective {{of this study was}} to compare the diagnostic accuracy of clinical and external pelvimetry in prediction of dystocia in nulliparous women. Methods: In this study between December 2008 and January 2009, 447 nulliparous women with a single pregnancy in vertex presentation and gestational age 38 - 42 weeks referring to the Ommolbanin hospital of Mashhad were included. External pelvic dimensions were assessed at the time of admission and clinical pelvimetry was performed by another examiner. These measurements were not available to the clinician in charge of the delivery. Dystocia was defined as caesarean section and vacuum or forceps delivery for abnormal progress of labor (active uterine contractions, arrest of cervical dilatation or cervical dilatation less than 1 cm /h in the active phase for 2 hours, prolongation of second stage beyond 2 hours or fetal head descent less than 1 cm/h). Statistical tests included Fisher exact test and Chi- square test. Results: The highest sensitivity obtained from clinical pelvimetry was 33. 3 % and related to <b>diagonal</b> <b>conjugate</b> less than 11. 5 cm. The sensitivity of external pelvic dimensions was higher than clinical pelvimetry that was highest for the Michaelis transverse diameter(60. 72 %). Conclusion: External pelvimetry in comparison to clinical pelvimetry is a better method for identifying dystocia in nulliparous women and can replace clinical pelvimetry in antenatal care programs...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: We {{assessed}} retrospectively {{the reference}} values of pelvic dimensions by 3 D CT performed for non-obstetrical indications in non-pregnant multiparous {{women with a}} successful vaginal delivery. We further aimed to evaluate the impact of maternal short stature on these parameters. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The 3 D CT pelvimetry was performed retrospectively in 203 non-pregnant women selected consecutively if they {{had at least one}} singleton term delivery with head presentation and if there was no history of maternal or fetal birth trauma or cerebral palsy after childbirth. With standard sagittal and reformatted axial-oblique views, anteroposterior including three conjugates of pelvic inlet, transverse, posterior sagittal diameters of pelvic inlet, the plane of greatest diameter, the plane of least diameter, and pelvic outlet were measured. Selected obstetric parameters were collected. RESULTS: Overall, the pelvises had transverse oval appearance in inlet and size of the female pelvis. The <b>diagonal</b> <b>conjugate</b> was at least 15 mm longer than the obstetric conjugate. Women with short stature had lower maximal birth weight, and this was in accordance with their somewhat lower pelvic diameters. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study present the reference values of the main planes of the true pelvis by 3 D CT pelvimetry in a relatively large group of multiparous women who passed a trial of labor successfully. Overall, the pelvises had features of female pelvic bony structure although pelvic diameters were somewhat lower in multiparous women with short stature. The 3 D pelvimetry with CT applications may be used as an adjunct to clinical and ultrasonographic examinations to rule out cephalopelvic dystocia in selected cases...|$|E

Operator splitting in the basic equations leads to a coupling of the Method of Characteristics with the Finite-Element Method (FEM). The set of linear equations in the FEM are solved using <b>diagonal</b> preconditioning and <b>Conjugate</b> Gradient Methods. The mesh partitioning for unstructured grids is carried out with the Recursive Spectral Bisection Method for the dual graph {{in combination with the}} Kernighan [...] Lin procedure.

40|$|In {{this report}} we present {{parallel}} solvers for large linear systems {{arising from the}} finite-element discretization of the three-dimensional steady-state groundwater flow problem. Our solvers are based on multigrid and Krylov subspace methods. The parallel implementation {{is based on a}} domain decomposition strategy with explicit message passing using NX and MPI libraries. We have tested our parallel implementations on the Intel Paragon XP/S 150 supercomputer using up to 1024 parallel processors and on other parallel platforms such as SGI/Power Challenge Array, Cray/SGI Origin 2000, Convex Exemplar SPP- 1200, and IBM SP using up to 64 processors. We show that multigrid can be a scalable algorithm on distributed memory machines. We demonstrate the effectiveness of parallel multigrid based solvers by solving problems requiring more than 70 million nodes in less than a minute. This is more than 25 times faster than the <b>diagonal</b> preconditioned <b>conjugate</b> gradient method {{which is one of the}} more popular methods for large sparse linear systems. Our results also show that multigrid as a stand alone solver works best for problems with smooth coefficients, but for rough coefficients it is best used as a preconditioner for a Krylov subspace method such as the conjugate gradient method. We show that even for extremely heterogeneous systems the multigrid pre-conditioned conjugate gradient method is at least 10 times faster than the diagonally preconditioned conjugate gradient method...|$|R
40|$|Previously defined {{equivalence}} relation, l, on Kekulé counts, K(B) ’s of catacondensed benzenoids, classifies Kekule structures {{according to}} the number of their terminal conjugated circuits. The function l, is an enumeration method which uncovers the less transparent combinatorial properties of K(B) ’s, such as their numerical self-similarity 1, graph generation, 2, 4 modeling quasicrystals 3 and modeling of Feigenbaum’s theory of chaos 5. Here, we consider two benzenoid system; Bq, an all-kinked unbranched benzenoid, and B 3, an all-kinked benzenoid which has one branched hexagon and for which ali branches are equal which are characterized by the peculiar property that the statistical distribution of the hypercubes (vertices, edges, squares, [...] .) which constitute their Kekulé spaces remains invariant under the effect of the l function. For these two systems, l is analogous to a percolation process. This property leads to a <b>diagonal</b> equality of <b>conjugated</b> circuit counts of members of the Bo series, which is scaled down by the powers of the golden-mean {{in the case of the}} B 3 series. K(Bo) ’s and/or KCB^j’s are shown to model a one-dimensional quasicrystal...|$|R

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Iterative methods are widely used to solve sparse linear systems due to the improvements which can be achieved in reducing the solution time and increasing the size of the problem which can be solved on a given computer compared to traditional direct solvers. The theory behind the convergence rate relationship and storage requirements for the preconditioned conjugate gradient methods using the diagonal scaling, incomplete Cholesky decomposition and SSOR preconditioners is explained in detail in this study. Sparse matrix storage techniques, such as profile, element-by-element, and compact row storage, are described along with the redefined matrix operations for each storage technique which must be used to eliminate the operations on zero elements. A procedure to directly assemble the global stiffness in compact row storage format from element stiffness matrices is introduced. Numerical studies have been performed to compare the storage requirements, the convergence rate, and the solution time for the direct and PCG methods using various storage formats. Effects of different material properties and external loading on the convergence rate and solution time are also analyzed. The test problems for this study are based on the three-dimensional linear elasticity finite element equations. The physical memory of 64 MB of RAM of the IBM RISC/ 6000 Model 355 workstation was the limiting factor for the size of the sparse linear system that could be solved in this study. The <b>diagonal</b> preconditioned <b>conjugate</b> gradient method with the compact row storage has solved a three-dimensional finite element problem up to a maximum of 50, 000 equations on an IBM RISC/ 6000 Model 355 workstation with 64 MB of RAM. To apply adaptive mesh refinement on certain regions of a coarse mesh, the modeling error over a coarse mesh must be estimated. This thesis will show that the modeling error from an intermediate unconverged coarse mesh solution will closely match the modeling error from the converged solution. This result may lead to quicker solution times for a highly accurate mesh based on adaptive mesh refinement iterative methods...|$|R
