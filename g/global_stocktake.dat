40|$|One of {{the most}} {{fundamental}} questions surrounding the new Paris Agreement is whether countries’ proposals to reduce GHG emissions after 2020 are equally ambitious, considering differences in circumstances between countries. We review a variety of approaches to assess the ambition of the GHG emission reduction proposals by countries. The approaches are applied illustratively to the mitigation part of the post- 2020 climate proposals (nationally determined contributions, or NDCs) by China, the EU, and the US. The analysis reveals several clear trends, even though the results differ per individual assessment approach. We recommend that such a comprehensive ambition assessment framework, employing a large variety of approaches, is used in the future to capture a wide spectrum of perspectives on ambition. POLICY RELEVANCE Assessing the ambition of the national climate proposals is particularly important as the Paris Agreement asks for regular reviews of national contributions, keeping in mind that countries raise their ambition over time. Such an assessment will be {{an important part of the}} regular <b>global</b> <b>stocktake</b> that will take place every five years, starting with a ‘light’ version in 2018. However, comprehensive methods to assess the proposals are lacking. This article provides such a comprehensive assessment framework. </p...|$|E
40|$|The 21 st Conference of Party (COP 21) held in Paris {{at the end}} of 2015 {{has opened}} a new era for the joint {{response}} dealing with climate change globally, and built up a new mode of global climate governance, that is, “all Parties submit INDC – <b>global</b> <b>stocktake</b> – enhance effort of actions – all Parties resubmit INDC – finally achieve the ultimate objective of the Convention. ” With 160 INDC reports (covering 188 Parties) that the UNFCCC Secretariat has currently received as research objects, this study classifies the mitigation targets of all Parties, and focuses on the systematic analysis of the financial demand, mitigation cost and priority investment areas for developing countries. The results are as follows: among 160 INDC reports, 122 reports clearly include the finance content; 64 reports propose specific amount of financial demand for the implementation of INDC; 31 reports pre-estimate domestic amount and financial demand for greenhouse gas mitigation in 2030, based on which they have calculated that the average mitigation cost for developing countries in 2030 would have reached up to US$ 22. 3 per ton CO 2; 28 Parties reclassify the financial demand for mitigation and adaptation areas, and reach the conclusion that the overall financial demand ratio for mitigation and adaptation is 1. 4. Should the current mitigation commitments of the Parties from developed countries be used as benchmark, then in 2030 the total amount of financial demand for developing countries in response to climate change would have reached up to US$ 474 billion...|$|E
40|$|The {{hybrid model}} of {{international}} climate policy {{embodied in the}} Paris Agreement requires countries to regularly deliver their nationally determined contributions (NDCs) and to progressively increase collective and individual efforts over time. To be effective, this type of regime requires international review processes that provide robust information about countries’ efforts to address climate change and the support they offer other countries to do so, {{as well as their}} future plans and trajectories. The regime must also provide substantial opportunities for state and non-state actor engagement with this information, as well as sharing of best practices. The Paris Agreement creates three different review processes, but leaves critical details regarding each and their relation to each other to future decisions: • a review of implementation of individual NDCs under an “enhanced transparency framework” for action and support, comprising a technical expert review and multilateral consideration (Article 13). • a <b>global</b> <b>stocktake</b> every five years to assess collective progress towards achieving the purpose and long-term goals of the Agreement (Article 14), preceded by a mitigation-focused facilitative dialogue in 2018. • a mechanism to facilitate implementation and promote compliance through a committee that is expert-based, non-adversarial and non-punitive (Article 15). It is essential for Parties to develop effective modalities, procedures and guidelines for each of these processes, ideally before the Paris Agreement enters into force. To this end, this discussion brief highlights essential considerations and, where possible, potential options for each process. The aim is to show what is at stake as the Parties negotiate the implementation of the Paris Agreement and, to clarify the questions that need to be resolved going forward. </p...|$|E
40|$|In the lead-up to the Paris Agreement, {{every country}} {{was invited to}} submit an {{intended}} nationally determined contribution (INDC), and indicate how it is fair. We analyse how countries have explained the equity of mitigation and adaptation in 163 INDCs, providing a bottom-up analysis of equity to complement a literature that has focused on top-down allocations. While no single indicator of equity was used by all INDCs, a menu of quantified indicators or tiered approaches could provide bounded flexibility across different national circumstances. The most common equity indicator used in mitigation INDCs is the country’s ‘small share’ of global emissions, followed by per capita emissions. The emissions of individual ‘small share’ INDCs add up to 24 % of annual global emissions when using a consistent data set. Per capita emissions are used {{across a range of}} countries with low (0. 5) to high (25 t CO 2 –eq per capita) values for that indicator. Adaptation is included in 89 % of INDCs, of which more than half quantify impacts in some manner, and two-thirds use vulnerability as an equity argument. Broadly, we find that most claims to equity are either unsubstantiated or drawn from analysis by in-country experts. Only two INDCs refer to independent evidence, and none consider the consequences of their approach when applied to all countries. Given that the aggregate effect of INDCs will not be sufficient to keep global temperature increase well below 2 °C, and even less to keep temperature below a 1. 5 °C rise, the INDCs have distributional implications. More rigorous information is needed to assess relative fair shares, which could be provided officially in future nationally determined contributions (NDCs). Absent improved information, it is likely that researchers and civil society will continue to assess informally what could be considered fair. A hybrid approach to equity—combining bottom-up assessment and top-down allocation—would be consistent with the hybrid architecture of the Paris Agreement, which comprises bottom-up elements such as NDCs and top-down elements such as global goals. Improved information on equity in NDCs will be an important input to the <b>global</b> <b>stocktake</b> ‘in the light of equity’. </p...|$|E
40|$|To provide modellers with an {{emission}} dataset that {{is indicative}} of the possible future emissions in Europe under two different policy pathways we use two global emission scenarios developed by the EDGAR team in the CIRCE project (Doering et al., 2010). The selected scenarios are a business-as-usual (BAU) and a climate change (CC) scenario. The two CIRCE scenarios contain detailed information about the development of individual source sector categories. By coupling these scenarios to TNO-CAMS gridded CO 2 data, the emission changes in each grid-cell and for each region can be estimated in a spatially explicit manner. The projections start from the latest historic year in the the TNO_CAMS-CO 2 data set, being 2014. The emission data can be used for e. g. for sensitivity tests, for example when designing a possible future observational system. The years covered in the data set are 2018, 2020, 2023, 2028, 2030, 2033, 2050. This selection has been made to include the 5 -year time steps fro the <b>global</b> <b>stocktake</b> in the Paris Agreement. The emission grid consists of UNECE-Europe in WGS 84 projection (lon-lat) with a spatial resolution of 1 / 8 x 1 / 16 degrees (lon x lat). The lower left of the grid is at lon = - 60, lat = 30 and the upper right is at lon = 60, lat = 72. The netcdf grid files (. nc) contain annual total emissions per grid cell for the years 2018, 2020, 2023, 2028, 2030, 2033, 2050. A separate file has been prepared for each year and each scenario (BAU or CC). The unit in the. nc files is kg/gridcell/yr Sectoral breakdown uses the SNAP classification. Compared to the default SNAP 1 sectors (1 to 10), the following change was made: 	 	SNAP 3 and SNAP 4 are grouped as SNAP 34 	 	 	SNAP 7 is split in SNAP 71 to 75 	 The dataset is described in Denier van der Gon, H.
