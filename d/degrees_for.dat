5|$|Eclipses {{can occur}} {{only when the}} Sun is within about 15 to 18 degrees of a node, (10 to 12 <b>degrees</b> <b>for</b> central eclipses). This is {{referred}} to as an eclipse limit. In the time it takes for the Moon to return to a node (draconic month), the apparent position of the Sun has moved about 29 degrees, relative to the nodes. Since the eclipse limit creates a window of opportunity of up to 36 degrees (24 <b>degrees</b> <b>for</b> central eclipses), it is possible for partial eclipses (or rarely a partial and a central eclipse) to occur in consecutive months.|$|E
5|$|For cut flowers, bulbs {{larger than}} 12cm in size are preferred. To bloom in December, bulbs are {{harvested}} in June to July, dried, stored {{for four days}} at 34°C, two weeks at 30 and two weeks at 17–20°C and then placed in cold storage for precooling at 9 <b>degrees</b> <b>for</b> about 15–16 weeks. The bulbs are then planted in light compost in crates in a greenhouse for forcing at 13°C–15°C and the blooms appear in 19–30 days.|$|E
5|$|However, {{through the}} written {{dialogue}} in his diary, Choe did express slight {{differences between the}} cultures of China and Korea. For example, when the Chinese asked him {{whether or not the}} Korean education system offered <b>degrees</b> <b>for</b> specialists who dealt with only one of the Five Classics, Choe wrote that a Korean student who only studied one of the Classics and not all five of them was doomed to failing his exam and never attaining the rank of a full-fledged Confucian scholar.|$|E

40|$|Discussions at the local, state, and {{national}} level often {{focus on the}} value of and prospect for a change from the current entry-level master’s degree to the doctorate degree as the required entrance <b>degree</b> <b>for</b> occupational therapists (OTs). While this debate is not without merit, what appears to be lacking is comparable attention to and consideration of the entry-level bachelor’s <b>degree</b> <b>for</b> occupational therapy assistants (OTAs). The present study examined the attitudes and opinions of OTs and OTAs in regard to the entry-level bachelor’s <b>degree</b> <b>for</b> OTAs. Responses from 144 OTs and 77 OTAs to a postal mailed survey found the majority of the participants did not agree with the profession moving to the entry-level bachelor’s <b>degree</b> <b>for</b> OTAs. However, they varied significantly in responses as to whether such a move would result in OTAs being paid more or being more current in evidence-based practice/research. Further, respondents were diverse in their opinions as to whether the bachelor’s degree would become the entry-level <b>degree</b> <b>for</b> OTAs in the near future. The results of this study support the need for an open national debate combined with applied research into the worth and option of moving to the entry-level bachelor <b>degree</b> <b>for</b> OTAs...|$|R

Under the first 25 years of Caspersen's stewardship, the trust donated over $118million to the four institutions. Caspersen was awarded honorary <b>degrees</b> <b>for</b> his service to education; Washington College conferred an honorary Doctor of Humanities degree in 1981 and Hood College awarded Caspersen with an honorary Doctor of Laws degree in 1983.|$|E
5|$|The Boeing 747 is a large, {{wide-body}} (two-aisle) airliner {{with four}} wing-mounted engines. The wings {{have a high}} sweep angle of 37.5 <b>degrees</b> <b>for</b> a fast, efficient cruise of Mach0.84 to 0.88, depending on the variant. The sweep also reduces the wingspan, allowing the 747 to use existing hangars. Seating capacity is more than 366 with a 3–4–3 seat arrangement (a cross section of 3 seats, an aisle, 4 seats, another aisle, and 3 seats) in economy class and a 2–3–2 arrangement in first class on the main deck. The upper deck has a 3–3 seat arrangement in economy class and a 2–2 arrangement in first class.|$|E

5|$|The school {{opened on}} September 15, 1914 as Bowling Green State Normal School in two {{temporary}} locations at the Bowling Green Armory {{and at a}} branch school in Toledo for the 1914–1915 academic year. It initially enrolled 304 students from Ohio, Michigan, and New York who were taught by 21 faculty members. The school graduated its first class in 1915, consisting of 35 certified teachers. University Hall and Williams Hall opened that year, the school's first two permanent buildings. Two years later the first baccalaureate <b>degrees</b> <b>for</b> teacher education were awarded. On March 28, 1920 a tornado, part of the 1920 Palm Sunday tornado outbreak, damaged three of the school's buildings. The tornado touched down near Bowling Green and strengthened as it moved into Ottawa County where it killed two people in Genoa.|$|E

Enforcing these new measures proved problematic, as the laboratory based measurement systems used had a margin of error of at least 1 degree, and video based measurement systems were likely to have more, especially if inappropriately executed.|$|E

30|$|Brouwer [1] {{initiated}} a topological <b>degree</b> <b>for</b> continuous maps in the Euclidean space. Leray and Schauder [2] developed the <b>degree</b> theory <b>for</b> compact operators in infinite-dimensional Banach spaces. Since then numerous generalizations and applications {{have been investigated}} in various ways of approach; see, e.g., [3 – 6]. Browder [7, 8] introduced a topological <b>degree</b> <b>for</b> nonlinear operators of monotone type in reflexive Banach spaces, where the Galerkin method is used to apply the Brouwer degree. Berkovits [9, 10] gave a new construction of the Browder degree, based on the Leray-Schauder degree.

25|$|The {{internal}} nasal valve {{comprises the}} area bounded by the upper lateral-cartilage, the septum, the nasal floor, and the anterior {{head of the}} inferior turbinate. In the narrow (leptorrhine) nose, this is the narrowest portion of the nasal airway. Generally, this area requires an angle greater than 15 <b>degrees</b> <b>for</b> unobstructed breathing; for the correction of such narrowness, {{the width of the}} nasal valve can be increased with spreader grafts and flaring sutures.|$|E
25|$|Both enantiomers of {{fluoxetine}} bind to the extracellular vestibule on the LeuT {{protein is}} {{such a way that}} the three fluorine atoms of the methylphenoxy ring bind into the HBP that is formed by Leu25, Gly26, Leu29, Arg30 and Tyr108. The halogens additionally make Van der Waals interaction with Leu29 and Tyr108, where the (S)-enantiomer additionally binds to Phe253 and makes Van der Waals contact with it among with previously mentioned amino acids. Because of the (S)-enantiomers opposite chirality to the (R)-enantiomer the rest of the molecule is reversed in the HBP, where the amine tail points towards the extracellular space and interacts with the N-terminal of Leu400, Asp401 and Ala319 (amino acids which are a part of the TM10). In this LeuT bound form the complex is rather rigid. The methylphenoxy ring rotates about the O5-C6 bond by 46 <b>degrees</b> <b>for</b> the (R)-enantiomer and 16 <b>degrees</b> <b>for</b> the (S)-enantiomer, but rigidity in the molecular structure indicates that the drug maintains its low-energy configuration upon binding to its protein target.|$|E
