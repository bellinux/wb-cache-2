5|$|W5 {{is found}} in Thoroughbreds {{descending}} from Puchilingui, a 1984 stallion with sabino-like white spotting and roaning. Horses with the W5 allele exhibit a huge range in white phenotype: a few have been pure white or near-white, while others have sabino-like spotting limited to high, irregular stockings and blazes that covered the face. Twenty-two members of this family were studied, and the 12 {{with some degree of}} dominant white spotting were found to have a deletion in exon 15 (p.T732QfsX9), {{in the form of a}} frameshift mutation. A later study found that the members of this family with the greatest <b>depigmentation</b> were compound heterozygotes who also carried the W20 allele.|$|E
5|$|Jackson's {{skin was}} a medium-brown color {{throughout}} his youth; however, {{starting in the}} mid 1980s, his skin gradually grew paler, which was partly due to vitiligo, but also widely considered {{to be due to}} skin bleaching and changing of his features to appear white. According to Jackson's biographer, J. Randy Taraborrelli, in 1984, Jackson was diagnosed with vitiligo, which Taraborrelli stated was sometimes considered by doctors to be a consequence of damage done by bleaching chemicals over the years. However, vitiligo is a rare non-contagious disease; the causes are not known, but a range of genetic, auto-immune, and environmental factors are suspected {{to play a role in}} this disease. Between 1% and 2% of the world population is considered to be affected. The <b>depigmentation</b> occurs in patches and affects all ethnic/racial groups equally.|$|E
5|$|Three months later, Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) {{calls in}} Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and informs her that four African American {{men have been}} kidnapped in Philadelphia. One of them has been found dead exhibiting <b>depigmentation.</b> A {{specialist}} from the CDC believes that the men have died from a disease, and has requested Scully to investigate the case. Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) joins Scully and {{has some of the}} evidence samples from Sanders' autopsy analyzed by Agent Pendrell, who finds a seed from a rare West African passionflower. Mulder takes the seed to his UN informant Marita Covarrubias and asks for her help; she provides him with information on the incident on the plane.|$|E
40|$|Background : In {{analogy with}} melanoma-associated leucoderma, halo naevi may trigger in some {{patients}} the development of additional <b>depigmentations</b> which are in distribution, extent and prognosis not in accordance with classic vitiligo. Objective : The {{aim of this study}} was to support the hypothesis that in a subset of halo naevi patients vitiligo-like lesions develop directly linked to the halo phenomenon. Methods : Forty-one patients with halo naevi were examined for the development of <b>depigmentations</b> not corresponding to typical vitiligo lesions. Results : We identified a subset of five halo naevi patients with additional subtle <b>depigmentations.</b> After the occurrence of multiple halo naevi, they developed leucoderma that showed a different disease pattern than vitiligo (variable asymmetric distribution, limited extent and lack of progression). Moreover, the characteristics of these halo naevi patients with associated leucoderma were different from classic vitiligo patients (high number of halo naevi, absence of family history for vitiligo and absence of autoimmune diseases) and the timing of occurrence of the leucoderma suggested a direct relation with the halo phenomenon. Conclusions : In this article, we describe in a limited subset of patients with multiple halo naevi discrete <b>depigmentations</b> at distance from halo naevi which may result from a temporary autoimmune process directly linked to the halo phenomenon. This finding illustrates the collateral damage resulting from skin immunosurveillance and may have clinical consequences as the evolution pattern in this subset of patients is less progressive compared with vitiligo. We present clinical data that support this hypothesis and suggest to call it halo naevi-associated leucoderma...|$|R

5|$|Swedish {{zoologist}} Carl Linnaeus {{first described}} the genus Elephas and an elephant from Sri Lanka (then known as Ceylon) under the binomial Elephas maximus in 1758. In 1798, Georges Cuvier classified the Indian elephant under the binomial Elephas indicus. Dutch zoologist Coenraad Jacob Temminck described the Sumatran elephant in 1847 under the binomial Elephas sumatranus. English zoologist Frederick Nutter Chasen classified all three as subspecies of the Asian elephant in 1940. Asian elephants vary geographically in their colour {{and amount of}} <b>depigmentation.</b> The Sri Lankan elephant (Elephas maximus maximus) inhabits Sri Lanka, the Indian elephant (E.m.indicus) is native to mainland Asia (on the Indian subcontinent and Indochina), and the Sumatran elephant (E.m.sumatranus) is found in Sumatra. One disputed subspecies, the Borneo elephant, lives in northern Borneo and is smaller {{than all the other}} subspecies. It has larger ears, a longer tail, and straighter tusks than the typical elephant. Sri Lankan zoologist Paules Edward Pieris Deraniyagala described it in 1950 under the trinomial Elephas maximus borneensis, taking as his type an illustration in National Geographic. It was subsequently subsumed under either E.m.indicus or E.m.sumatranus. Results of a 2003 genetic analysis indicate its ancestors separated from the mainland population about 300,000years ago. A 2008 study found that Borneo elephants are not indigenous to the island but were brought there before 1521 by the Sultan of Sulu from Java, where elephants are now extinct.|$|E
25|$|White colorings, whether white markings, white {{patterns}} or dominant white are collectively {{known as}} <b>depigmentation</b> phenotypes, and are all caused by areas of skin that lack pigment cells (melanocytes). <b>Depigmentation</b> phenotypes have various genetic causes, {{and those that}} have been studied usually map to the EDNRB and KIT genes.

40|$|Autologous noncultured cell {{suspension}} transplantation {{is an effective}} treatment for repigmentation in segmental vitiligo and piebaldism. Full surface laser ablation is frequently used to prepare the recipient site before {{cell suspension}} transplantation, even though the optimal laser settings and ablation depth are unknown. To assess the efficacy and safety of less invasive recipient-site preparations. In a randomized, observer-blinded, controlled trial we compared different recipient-site preparations before cell suspension transplantation in segmental vitiligo and piebaldism. In each patient, we randomly allocated three CO 2 laser recipient-site preparations (209 and 144 μm full surface, and fractional) and a control (no treatment) to four <b>depigmentations.</b> After 6 months we assessed repigmentation and side-effects. We included 10 patients with vitiligo (n = 3) and piebaldism (n = 7). Compared with the control site, we found more repigmentation after full surface ablation at 209 μm (median 68 · 7 %, P = 0 · 01) and 144 μm (median 58 · 3 %, P = 0 · 007), but no repigmentation after fractional ablation (median 0 · 0 %, P = 0 · 14).

40|$|Background: The {{significance}} of associated autoimmune/autoinflammatory diseases in generalized vitiligo patients {{with respect to}} their clinical profile has not yet been completely established. Objective: The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the clinical {{significance of}} associated autoimmune/autoinflammatory diseases in generalized vitiligo patients with respect to some general clinical variables, distribution pattern, disease activity and treatment response. Methods: Seven hundred generalized vitiligo patients were included in this retrospective observational cohort study. Results: Associated autoimmune/autoinflammatory diseases were present in 15. 4 % of the patient population and were more common in women compared with men, especially concerning thyroid disease. Only vitiligo patients with thyroid disease had clear different clinical characteristics. The percentage of total body surface area involvement was significantly (P= 0. 005) higher in the presence of thyroid disease which was more pronounced in women compared with men. Patients with thyroid disease had a particular predisposition to acral and joint <b>depigmentations.</b> No clear differences in disease activity or response to therapy were observed in vitiligo patients with or without autoimmune/autoinflammatory disorders. Conclusion: The presence of associated autoimmune/autoinflammatory diseases seems to influence the clinical profile of generalized vitiligo patients. Our results support the hypothesis that in the presence of a thyroid disorder, the disease activity of vitiligo is more extensive, in particular on areas prone to friction...|$|R

25|$|Vitiligo is a {{condition}} that causes <b>depigmentation</b> of sections of skin. It occurs when melanocytes die or are unable to function. The cause of vitiligo is unknown, but research suggests that it may arise from autoimmune, genetic, oxidative stress, neural, or viral causes. The incidence worldwide is less than 1%. Individuals affected by vitiligo sometimes suffer psychological discomfort because of their appearance.|$|E
40|$|Background: Vitiligo is {{a common}} {{pigmentation}} disorder affecting approximately 1 % of the world population. Nonetheless, its distribution pattern is not well investigated. Objective: The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate whether the distribution pattern of vitiligo is dependent on the clinical characteristics. Methods: A total of 700 generalized vitiligo patients were included in this retrospective observational cohort study. Results: The most important predilection areas were the face (87 %), followed by acral areas (76. 3 %) and extremities (59. 7 %). In women, joints (P= 0. 002) (especially elbows), hips (P< 0. 001), trunk (P< 0. 001) and body folds (P< 0. 001) (especially axillas) were more frequently affected compared to men. In contrast, in men more <b>depigmentations</b> in the beard area and genital area were observed (P< 0. 001). Vitiligo at a young age is more prone to be localized at the lower extremities whereas the upper extremities are more susceptible at an older age. In the face, the periocular area is linked to a younger age, in contrast to the perioral area. Acral areas were more frequently affected in patients with autoimmune disorders (in particular thyroid disease) (P= 0. 001). Conclusion: These results point to important differences in the distribution pattern according to the clinical characteristics. Although in some of these areas Koebner's phenomenon probably plays a role, other differences may represent a specific characteristic vulnerability related to the age, gender or typical association with autoimmune disease...|$|R
25|$|Photosensitivity {{reactions}} {{are characterized by}} severe {{inflammation of the skin}} with <b>depigmentation</b> and ulceration.

500|$|Vitiligo {{occurs in}} three {{different}} patterns. Segmental <b>depigmentation</b> means only {{one side of the}} body is affected, whereas generalized [...] <b>depigmentation</b> means many parts of the body are affected.

In Jackson's case, there were 5 affected areas.|$|E
500|$|Early {{embryonal}} lethality, {{also known}} as early embryonic death or a non-viable embryo, may occur when the embryo possesses two dominant white alleles, or have the homozygous genotype. The {{reason for this is}} that many mutations for W are caused by nonsense mutations, frameshift mutations or DNA deletions, which, if homozygous, would make it impossible to produce a functional KIT protein. [...] However, it is possible that homozygous embryos from alleles of missense and splice site mutations might be viable because they have less effect on gene function. A 2013 study also unearthed horses that were compound W5/W20 heterozygotes, almost completely white, essentially with greater <b>depigmentation</b> than could be accounted for by either allele alone.|$|E
500|$|An elephant's skin is {{generally}} very tough, at [...] thick {{on the back}} and parts of the head. The skin around the mouth, anus, and inside of the ear is considerably thinner. Elephants typically have grey skin, but African elephants look brown or reddish after wallowing in coloured mud. Asian elephants have some patches of <b>depigmentation,</b> particularly on the forehead and ears and the areas around them. Calves have brownish or reddish hair, especially on the head and back. As elephants mature, their hair darkens and becomes sparser, but dense concentrations of hair and bristles remain {{on the end of the}} tail as well as the chin, genitals and the areas around the eyes and ear openings. Normally the skin of an Asian elephant is covered with more hair than its African counterpart.|$|E
500|$|Elephants {{belong to}} the family Elephantidae, the sole {{remaining}} family within the order Proboscidea which belongs to the superorder Afrotheria. Their closest extant relatives are the sirenians (dugongs and manatees) and the hyraxes, with which they share the clade Paenungulata within the superorder Afrotheria. Elephants and sirenians are further grouped in the clade Tethytheria. Three species of elephants are recognised; the African bush elephant (Loxodonta africana) and forest elephant (Loxodonta cyclotis) of sub-Saharan Africa, and the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus) of South and Southeast Asia. African elephants have larger ears, a concave back, more wrinkled skin, a sloping abdomen, and two finger-like extensions {{at the tip of}} the trunk. Asian elephants have smaller ears, a convex or level back, smoother skin, a horizontal abdomen that occasionally sags in the middle and one extension {{at the tip of the}} trunk. The looped ridges on the molars are narrower in the Asian elephant while those of the African are more diamond-shaped. The Asian elephant also has [...] bumps on its head and some patches of <b>depigmentation</b> on its skin. In general, African elephants are larger than their Asian cousins.|$|E
500|$|To {{treat these}} conditions, Jackson used Solaquin, Tretinoin, and Benoquin. On June 29, 2009, {{multiple}} tubes of Benoquin and hydroquinone {{were found in}} Jackson's home. Both creams are commonly used to treat vitiligo; Dr. David Sawcer said some patients with vitiligo {{get to the point}} where it makes more sense to remove the brown bits because so much of the skin is pale. On the other hand, getting depigmented skin to darken is extremely difficult. <b>Depigmentation</b> causes a permanent and extreme sensitivity to the sun. Vitiligo patients are at risk to contract melanoma, and an annual cancer check-up is recommended. Jackson also had hydroxychloroquine injected directly into his scalp regularly. Another common way of treating vitiligo is using makeup to camouflage depigmented skin. The treatments Jackson used for his condition further lightened his skin tone, and with the application of pancake makeup to even out his skin tone, he could appear very pale. For example, Stevie Nicks recalled in a Rolling Stone interview: [...] "I remember before , Michael sent somebody to find out if I had any foundation make-up he could borrow. I was using some light Chanel foundation at that time, and Michael sent back a note to say, thanks, but the foundation wasn't quite light enough for him." [...] Jackson also covered his skin disorder with clothing wearing long sleeves and long pants. In the music video for [...] "Remember the Time," [...] all dancers and actors except for Jackson are lightly dressed following the example set by ancient Egyptians. Jackson usually avoided wearing patterned clothing to avoid attention to the disorder.|$|E

2500|$|Italian Fascism {{strongly}} {{rejected the}} common Nordicist {{conception of the}} Aryan race that idealised [...] "pure" [...] Aryans as having certain physical traits that were defined as Nordic such as fair skin, blond hair and light eyes. The antipathy by Mussolini and other Italian Fascists to Nordicism was over the existence of what they viewed as the Mediterranean inferiority complex that they claimed had been instilled into Mediterraneans by the propagation of such theories by German and Anglo-Saxon Nordicists who viewed Mediterranean peoples as racially degenerate and thus in their view inferior. However traditional Nordicist claims of Mediterraneans being degenerate due to having a darker colour of skin than Nordics had long been rebuked in anthropology through the <b>depigmentation</b> theory that claimed that lighter skinned peoples had been dipigmented from a darker skin. This theory has since become a widely accepted view in anthropology. Anthropologist Carleton S. Coon in his work The races of Europe (1939) subscribed to <b>depigmentation</b> theory that claimed that Nordic race's light-coloured skin {{was the result of}} <b>depigmentation</b> from their ancestors of the Mediterranean race. Mussolini refused to allow Italy to return again to this inferiority complex, initially rejecting Nordicism.|$|E
2500|$|Coon's (1939) {{theory that}} the Nordic race was a depigmentated {{variation}} of the greater Mediterranean racial stock was also supported by his mentor Earnest Albert Hooton who {{in the same year}} published Twilight of Man, which notes: [...] "The Nordic race is certainly a depigmented offshoot from the basic long-headed Mediterranean stock. It deserves separate racial classification only because its blond hair (ash or golden), its pure blue or grey eyes". A 1990s study by Ulrich Mueller found that <b>depigmentation</b> of Nordic peoples around the Baltic Sea likely occurred due to vitamin D deficiency amongst peoples living there 10,000-30,000 years ago who had a lack of access to vitamin D foods such as dairy products at the time. <b>Depigmentation</b> allowed greater amount of ultraviolet B light to be absorbed through the skin to synthesize to produce vitamin D.|$|E

[...] Additionally, detection of porphyria cutanea tarda can sometimes be made when urine turns pink upon illumination with Wood's lamp. Wood's lamps have also been used to differentiate hypopigmentation from <b>depigmentation</b> such as with vitiligo. A vitiligo patient's skin will appear yellow-green or blue under the Wood's lamp.

2500|$|Kwashiorkor {{is mainly}} caused by {{inadequate}} protein intake. The main symptoms are edema, wasting, liver enlargement, hypoalbuminaemia, steatosis, and possibly <b>depigmentation</b> of skin and hair.

The term means ‘displaced child’ and is derived from a Ghana language of West Africa, means [...] "the sickness the older one gets when the next baby is born," [...] as this is when the older child is deprived of breast feeding and weaned to a diet composed largely of carbohydrates.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>depigmentation</b> theory {{received}} notable {{support from}} later anthropologists, thus in 1947 Melville Jacobs noted: [...] "To many physical anthropologists Nordic means {{a group with}} an especially high percentage of blondness, which represent a depigmentated Mediterranean". In her work Races of Man (1963, 2nd Ed. 1965) Sonia Mary Cole went further {{to argue that the}} Nordic race belongs to the [...] "brunette Mediterranean" [...] Caucasoid division but that it differs only in its higher percentage of blonde hair and light eyes. The Harvard anthropologist Claude Alvin Villee, Jr. also was a notable proponent of this theory, writing: [...] "The Nordic division, a partially depigmised branch of the Mediterranean group." [...] Collier's Encyclopedia as late as 1984 contains an entry for this theory, citing anthropological support. Early 21st century genetic studies have provided new insights into the origins of Irish people as well as their neighbours {{from other parts of the}} British Isles. Correspondingly, researchers in the field have suggested that migrations from prehistoric Iberia can be viewed as the primary source for their genetic material, having demonstrated marked similarities with modern representatives of the aforementioned time period in that of the Basque people. However, the majority of Irish males fall under the R1b sub-clade L-21, which is quite rare for Basques.|$|E
