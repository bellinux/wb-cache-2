25|$|The {{fourth day}} {{was one in}} which {{numerous}} records tumbled and the game changed dramatically with an incredible partnership between Laxman and Dravid. Laxman struck 44 fours {{on his way to}} a record-breaking double hundred. With a single off Matthew Hayden, he crossed the mark of 236 set by Sunil Gavaskar against West Indies at Chennai in 1983, for the highest score by an Indian batsman in tests. Dravid, meanwhile also reached his century and celebrated in uncharacteristic fashion <b>gesturing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> press box, having been criticised in the media for his recent poor form.|$|E
500|$|As the Confederate charge {{struck the}} Union position, {{a gap in}} the Union line opened in front of the 19th Massachusetts between their brigade and the {{adjacent}} brigade commanded by Brig. Gen. Webb. [...] Seeing the break, Devereux turned to the colonel of the 42nd New York and, <b>gesturing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> gap said, [...] "Mallon, we must move!" [...] At that moment, Maj. Gen. Winfield S. Hancock rode by and Devereux called out to Hancock, [...] "They have broken through! [...] Shall I get in there?" [...] To which Hancock replied, [...] "Go at them!" [...] The 19th Massachusetts and the 42nd New York together filled the gap, entering a pandemonium of hand-to-hand combat. [...] In the brutal fighting, the 19th Massachusetts captured four Confederate regimental flags which Devereux personally delivered to his brigade commander after the battle.|$|E
500|$|Delft, {{captured}} {{in the early stages}} of the battle, was under the command of the Dutch Lieutenant Heilberg and the British Lieutenant Charles Bullen, with a small prize crew of 69 men. Ninety-three Dutch prisoners had been removed, and among the remaining Dutch sailors were 76 wounded men. As the gale intensified, it rapidly became clear that despite a tow line attached from Veteran the ship would never reach Britain, and a large board was raised on deck with the chalked message [...] "The ship is sinking". Reacting at once, boats from nearby ships organised an evacuation and began loading the Dutch prisoners for transfer to more seaworthy vessels. Bullen offered a place in the first rescue boat, from Veteran, to Heilberg, but the Dutch officer refused, <b>gesturing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> immobile wounded who had been brought onto the maindeck as the lower decks had flooded and replying [...] "But how can I leave these men?". In response, Bullen cried out [...] "God bless you, my brave fellow! Here is my hand; I give you my word I will stay her with you!". The prize crew left on the second rescue boat sent from Russell, and Bullen and Heilberg waited for a third trip to bring them off with the remaining 30 wounded men and three junior Dutch officers who had also elected to stay. Before further help could arrive, however, Delft suddenly foundered, Bullen and Heilberg throwing themselves clear as the ship sank. Both were seen in the water but only Bullen reached safety, swimming to Monmouth alone.|$|E

30|$|In sum, {{there is}} a range of {{possible}} reasons that might explain why <b>the</b> teacher’s <b>gestures</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> equation were detrimental for students’ learning in this study. A trade-off in attention {{may be part of}} the reason; greater attention <b>to</b> <b>the</b> equation may lead to inadequate attention <b>to</b> <b>the</b> graphs. Alternatively, the greater redundancy between the information expressed in speech and in <b>gestures</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> equations may have evoked detrimental, extraneous processing, as suggested by Mayer’s redundancy principle.|$|R

30|$|In this research, we {{investigated}} whether teacher <b>gestures</b> <b>to</b> linked representations—including symbolic representations (equations) and visuospatial representations (graphs)—would promote student learning from a lesson about {{the links between}} those representations. Instead, we found that teachers’ <b>gestures</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> equations were detrimental to students’ learning. We did not find compelling evidence that teachers’ <b>gestures</b> <b>to</b> graphs were beneficial for students’ learning.|$|R
30|$|But, was the {{information}} in <b>the</b> teacher’s <b>gestures</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> equations actually more redundant than {{the information}} in <b>the</b> teacher’s <b>gestures</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> graphs? Perhaps so. As noted above, the teacher's speech referred quite unambiguously <b>to</b> <b>the</b> digits in the equations (e.g., pointing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> “ 2 ” in the equation while saying “ 2 ”), and in this sense, her gestures were redundant with her speech. The information expressed in <b>gestures</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> graph was also redundant with speech (e.g., the teacher said, “we go over <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 2 on the x-axis” while tracing along the x-axis from <b>the</b> origin <b>to</b> (0, 2)). However, there are inherent differences in how verbal and visuospatial representations present information; Schnotz (2002) characterized this {{difference in terms of}} the distinction between descriptive representations (such as text or equations), which represent content via convention, and depictive representations (visual displays, such as diagrams or graphs), which represent content via common structural features that are either concrete or abstract. One potential consequence of these differences is that <b>gestures</b> <b>to</b> visuospatial representations may be inherently less redundant with speech about those representations than are <b>gestures</b> <b>to</b> symbolic representations that occur with speech about those representations. If this is <b>the</b> case, then <b>gestures</b> <b>to</b> equations, by virtue of being more redundant with speech, should be more likely than <b>gestures</b> <b>to</b> graphs to evoke extraneous processing that can be detrimental to performance.|$|R

5000|$|The {{concept of}} the uncanny was perhaps first fixed by Sigmund Freud in his 1919 essay Das Unheimliche. For Freud, the uncanny's mixture of the {{familiar}} and the eerie confronts the subject with unconscious, repressed impulses. Expanding on the idea, psychoanalytic theorist Jacques Lacan wrote that the uncanny places us [...] "in the field where {{we do not know}} how to distinguish bad and good, pleasure from displeasure," [...] resulting in an irreducible anxiety <b>gesturing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Real. The concept has since been taken up by a variety of subsequent thinkers and theorists.|$|E

30|$|The {{arguments}} {{discussed above}} offer {{a possible explanation}} for why <b>the</b> teacher’s <b>gestures</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> equations were not beneficial for student learning, but they cannot explain why <b>the</b> teacher’s <b>gestures</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> equations were actually detrimental for learning. What might account for the negative effect of the teacher's <b>gesture</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> equations that we observed? One possibility is that the redundancy of information in the teacher’s gestures and speech actually interfered with learning, in accord with Mayer’s “redundancy principle” for multi-media learning (see, e.g., Mayer, Heiser & Lonn, 2001). According to this principle, redundant information can evoke extraneous processing and thereby tax learners’ working memory capacity. Indeed, we insured {{that all of the}} teacher’s gestures in this study were redundant with the accompanying speech because we {{wanted to be able to}} examine whether that speech (in the no-gesture condition) would effectively communicate about links on its own. However, this feature of our design, while allowing us strong experimental control, also created a situation in which gesture was always redundant. From the perspective of Mayer’s cognitive theory of multi-media learning (e.g., Mayer, 2014), the redundant gestures may have evoked extraneous processing without contributing relevant, new information.|$|R
30|$|Why did {{students}} learn less when <b>the</b> teacher <b>gestured</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> equations?

5000|$|On 4 September 2009, three Hong Kong {{journalists were}} tackled and {{detained}} by paramilitary police while filming a disturbance.

50|$|The {{first of}} five {{championship}} matches, for the WWF Light Heavyweight Championship, {{started with the}} champion Taka Michinoku kicking Christian {{out of the ring}} and flooring him with a suicide top rope crossbody. When Christian tried to reenter the ring, kicks to his midsection left him hanging on the rope and Taka flew a knee drop onto him. Christian managed to gain some momentum after kicking out of the turnbuckle, slowing Taka's dynamism with a falling reverse DDT and afterward delivering a succession of two suplexes and a facebuster. With Taka thrown out of the ring, Christian mimicked the champion with a suicidal crossbody dive. The match was reset even after a big splash from Christian left him floored. Christian then became the recipient of a dropkick to the outside, then a baseball slide finished by an Asai Moonsault. His <b>gesturing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> crowd allowed Christian some rest time though, and Taka could not pin Christian inside the ring, especially after he escaped a Michinoku Driver II. A second attempt at the driver was reversed into a cradle pin, allowing Christian to win the championship on his debut appearance, with Edge watching on {{from the back of the}} crowd.|$|E
