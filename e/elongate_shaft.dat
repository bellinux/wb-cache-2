The opposing spring fingers are adapted to grasp a surgical device and power the surgical device via physical conductors on the spring fingers or graspers attached thereto, resulting in the surgical device being fully functional. A first trigger mechanism opens and closes the spring fingers via a piston disposed within the <b>elongate</b> <b>shaft.</b> A second trigger mechanism rotates the surgical device grasped by the spring fingers...|$|E
40|$|A new genus {{and species}} of Monogenoidea, Susanlimae ianwhittingtoni gen. nov., sp. nov., are {{proposed}} for dactylogyrids collected from the "Nuayang tipis", Pseudeutropius moolenburghae Weber & de Beaufort, 1913, which inhabits freshwater in Sumatra. While clearly {{a member of a}} putative clade that includes Asian and African catfish parasites, S. ianwhittingtoni sp. nov. differs from most members of this clade by having a bifurcated haptor that embraces the gill rakers of its host. This haptoral morphology and mode of attachment also occur in species of Bifurcohaptor Jain, 1958. However, species of Susanlimae gen. nov. are easily distinguished by the comparative morphology of their haptoral armature. In Susanlimae gen. nov., the ventral and dorsal bars are single, elongated, and inverted u-shaped (ventral bar short and two short dorsal bars in Bifurcohaptor spp.); the dorsal anchor is robust with well-defined roots (reduced roots and <b>elongate</b> <b>shaft</b> in Bifurcohaptor spp.); and the ventral anchor has an elongated, deep root (inconspicuous in Bifurcohaptor spp.) ...|$|E
25|$|During this time, {{there was}} a {{diversity}} of styles in which the Quran was written. One characteristic seen {{in most of these}} manuscripts is the <b>elongated</b> <b>shafts</b> of the free-standing alif and the right-sided tail (foot) of the isolated alif. Also, these manuscripts do not have headings of chapters (suras). Instead, a blank space is left {{at the end of one}} sura and at the beginning of another.|$|R
40|$|A ski carrier (10) for {{carrying}} {{a pair of}} skis (36) is described. The ski carrier (10) comprises a pair of ski poles (12), each having an <b>elongated</b> <b>shaft</b> (16) and a handle (22) that can be attached in a first and a second orientation relative to the shaft. The first orientation is suitable for skiing. Each ski pole further has a wheel (24) with an axis of rotation (26) that is transverse to the shaft in the second orientation. The ski carrier further has a lock (46) for releasably locking the handles together {{so that they can}} support the pair of skis and functions as a rolling cart...|$|R
50|$|The {{basic form}} of minarets {{consists}} of three parts: a base, shaft, and a gallery. For the base, the ground is excavated until a hard foundation is reached. Gravel and other supporting materials {{may be used as}} a foundation; it is unusual for the minaret to be built directly upon ground-level soil. Minarets may be conical (tapering), square, cylindrical, or polygonal (faceted). Stairs circle the shaft in a counter-clockwise fashion, providing necessary structural support to the highly <b>elongated</b> <b>shaft.</b> The gallery is a balcony that encircles the upper sections from which the muezzin may give the call to prayer. It is covered by a roof-like canopy and adorned with ornamentation, such as decorative brick and tile work, cornices, arches and inscriptions, with the transition from the shaft to the gallery typically sporting muqarnas.|$|R
50|$|Males {{are entirely}} yellow-green, with paler underparts and head. The two central tail {{feathers}} are <b>elongated</b> with bare <b>shafts</b> and terminated with black rackets. Females are generally darker and less yellowish, while the bare tail shafts are shorter. Juveniles {{do not have}} rackets at the tail. Total length is about 29 centimeters.|$|R
50|$|The shaft-tailed whydah or queen whydah (Vidua regia) is a small, sparrow-like bird in {{the genus}} Vidua.

After the breeding season is over, the male sheds its long tail and grows olive brown female-like plumage.|$|R
40|$|Vessel {{sprouting}} by endothelial cells (ECs) during angiogenesis {{relies on}} a navigating tip cell and on proliferating stalk cells that <b>elongate</b> the <b>shaft.</b> To date, only genetic signals {{have been shown to}} regulate vessel sprouting. However, emerging evidence indicates that the angiogenic switch also requires a metabolic switch. Indeed, angiogenic signals not only induce a change in EC metabolism but this metabolic adaptation also co-determines vessel sprouting. The glycolytic activator PFKFB 3 regulates stalk cell proliferation and renders ECs more competitive to reach the tip. We discuss the emerging link between angiogenesis and EC metabolism during the various stages of vessel sprouting, focusing only on genetic signals for which an effect on EC metabolism has been documented. status: publishe...|$|R
50|$|Kritsky, Bakenhaster & Adams (2015) {{wrote that}} Pseudorhabdosynochus meganmarieae is easily {{distinguished}} {{from all other}} known congeners from the western Atlantic region by having ventral anchors with short roots and an <b>elongate</b> straight <b>shaft.</b> Based {{on the presence of}} two small chambers and a distal funnel-shaped tube in the vaginal sclerites, P. meganmarieae most closely resembles P. yucatanensis, but the vaginal sclerite in P. meganmarieae is more robust and its distal end has a more pronounced funnel shape than that of P. yucatanensis. It differs further from P. yucatanensis by lacking tegumental scales and by having a comparatively deep medial constriction in the ventral bar and a tapered cone and thinner walls of the chambers of the male copulatory organ.|$|R
50|$|The {{origins of}} the Do 335 trace back to World War I when Claude Dornier {{designed}} a number of flying boats featuring remotely driven propellers and later, due to problems with the drive shafts, tandem engines. Tandem engines were used {{on most of the}} multi-engine Dornier flying boats that followed, including the highly successful Do J Wal and the gigantic Do X. The remote propeller drive, intended to eliminate parasitic drag from the engine entirely, was tried in the innovative but unsuccessful Do 14, and <b>elongated,</b> tubular drive <b>shafts</b> as later used in the Do 335 saw use in the rear engines of the four-engined, twinned tandem-layout Do 26 flying boat.|$|R
40|$|Background: Hair loss {{is seen as}} an {{irreversible}} process. Most research {{concentrates on}} how to elongate the anagen, reduce the negative factors of obstructing hair growth and improve the hair number and size. Aim: In our experiment, we tried to prove that the cow placenta extract can promote hair growth by <b>elongating</b> hair <b>shaft</b> and increasing hair follicle number. Materials and Methods: Cow placenta extract (CPE), water and minoxidil applied separately on the back of depilated B 57 CL/ 6 mice for the case, negative and positive control respectively. We checked the proliferation of cells which are resident in hair sheath, and the expression of a few growth factors which stimulate hair growth. Results: Result shows that placenta extract more efficiently accelerates cell division and growth factor expression, by raising the insulin-like growth factor (IGF- 1) mRNA and protein level to increase HF size and hair length. Conclusions: The extract is not a purified product; so, it is less effective than minoxidil, which is approved by the US FDA for the treatment of male pattern baldness. If refinement is done, the placenta extract would be a good candidate medicine for hair loss...|$|R
40|$|The {{morphology}} of the canine cardiac myosin molecule {{has been}} investigated in the electron microscope with Hall's mica-replica technique. The molecule is an <b>elongated</b> rod (<b>shaft)</b> of nonuniform diameter with a globular expansion (head) on one end. Statistical analysis of the lengths of 1908 molecules showed that the mean length was 1610 ± 250 A; the mean length of the head was 210 ± 20 A; and {{the diameter of the}} head and that of the shaft were 35 to 40 and 15 to 20 A, respectively. About one-third of the molecules had single or multiple, fairly sharp, angulations along their shafts. Rarely, some details of the substructure of the molecule have been observed. Large, spindle-shaped aggregates, measuring 0. 5 to 1 µ in length and 50 to 100 A in diameter, were produced by dilution of the myosin solutions. These aggregates were readily visualized in the electron microscope by means of Huxley's negative-staining technique. Projections often were visible {{along the length of the}} aggregates except at a central zone where they were frequently absent. The aggregates resembled the thick myofilaments of the myocardium and appeared similar to those produced by Huxley from skeletal myosin solutions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract – Aristocleidus mexicanus n. sp. and Aristocleidus lacantuni n. sp. are {{described}} from the gills of the Mex-ican mojarra Eugerres mexicanus (Gerreidae, Perciformes) from the Rio Lacantún basin, Chiapas State, Mexico. These new species differ from previously described congeneric {{species in the}} characteristics of several structures, including: (a) ventral anchors, with differences in length (i. e. 46 – 50 lm in A. mexicanus vs. 38 – 43 lm, 34 – 37 lm, and 26 – 33 lm in Aristocleidus hastatus Mueller, 1936, Aristocleidus sp. of Mendoza-Franco, Violante-González & Roche 2009, and Aristocleidus lamothei Kritsky & Mendoza-Franco, 2008, respectively) and shape (i. e. slightly angular union of <b>elongate</b> arcing <b>shaft</b> and point in A. mexicanus vs. point and shaft united at a conspic-uous angular bend in A. hastatus and Aristocleidus sp., and evenly curved shaft and point in A. lamothei); (b) male copulatory organ, i. e. a coiled tube with less than one ring in A. mexicanus and A. lacantuni (vs. a coiled tube of about 1 in Aristocleidus sp.); (c) distal end of the accessory piece (ornate in A. mexicanus vs. distally flattened and trifid in A. hastatus and A. lamothei, respectively); (d) vaginal tube (moderately long in A. mexicanus vs. short in A. lamothei and looping in Aristocleidus sp.); and (e) ventral bar (anteromedial process with terminal horn-like ornamentation in A. lacantuni vs. ornamentation absent in the other species).

40|$|We {{report a}} new basal crocodyliform taxon, Neuquensuchus universitas gen. nov., sp. nov., from Neuquén Province, Argentina, {{belonging}} to Bajo de la Carpa Formation, representing {{the first and}} only “protosuchian” from the Cretaceous of Gondwana. The articulated and fragmentary materials belonged to a willowy, slender species, with very long and thin extremities. As in Shantungosuchus, the cervical centers are lengthened, with prominent ventral keel and well developed anteroventral parapophyses. As in basal crocodylomorphs, it possesses two sacral vertebrae. Also, a much enlarged scapular blade, with well developed acromial ridge and the posterior edge similar to Sichuanosuchus. The pronounced deltopectoral crest in the complete humerus is equivalent to Sichuanosuchus and as this, a circular, <b>elongated</b> and thin <b>shaft</b> with the medial condyle longer than the lateral one. Also, the complete ulna and radius is similar in their proportions to Sichuanosuchus. As this, the pubis is lengthened, very thin in the half section and not very expanded distally. The femur, tibia and fibula are elongated and similar to other non-derivated crocodyliforms. Besides representing the first Cretaceous “protosuchian ” of Gondwana, the occurrence of these outside of Asia and Europe during the Cretaceous offers new evidence of pre-Albian dispersion between Gondwana and Centra...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND:Bacterial macrofibers twist as they grow, writhe, {{supercoil}} {{and wind}} up into plectonemic structures (helical forms the individual filaments of which cannot be taken apart without unwinding) that eventually carry loops at both of their ends. Terminal loops rotate about the axis of a fiber's shaft in contrary directions at increasing rate as the <b>shaft</b> <b>elongates.</b> Theory suggests that rotation rates should vary linearly {{along the length of}} a fiber ranging from maxima at the loop ends to zero at an intermediate point. Blocking rotation at one end of a fiber should lead to a single gradient: zero at the blocked end to maximum at the free end. We tested this conclusion by measuring directly the rotation at various distances along fiber length from the blocked end. The movement of supercoils over a solid surface was also measured in tethered macrofibers. RESULTS:Macrofibers that hung down from a floating wire inserted through a terminal loop grew vertically and produced small plectonemic structures by supercoiling along their length. Using these as markers for shaft rotation we observed a uniform gradient of initial rotation rates with slopes of 25. 6 degrees/min. mm. and 36. 2 degrees/min. mm. in two different fibers. Measurements of the distal tip rotation in a third fiber as a function of length showed increases proportional to increases in length with constant of proportionality 79. 2 rad/mm. Another fiber tethered to the floor grew horizontally with a length-doubling time of 74 min, made contact periodically with the floor and supercoiled repeatedly. The supercoils moved over the floor toward the tether at approximately 0. 06 mm/min, 4 times faster than the fiber growth rate. Over a period of 800 minutes the fiber grew to 23 mm in length and was entirely retracted back to the tether by a process involving 29 supercoils. CONCLUSIONS:The rate at which growing bacterial macrofibers rotated about the axis of the fiber shaft measured at various locations along fibers in structures prevented from rotating at one end reveal that the rate varied linearly from zero at the blocked end to maximum at the distal end. The increasing number of twisting cells in growing fibers caused the distal end to continuously rotate faster. When the free end was intermittently prevented from rotating a torque developed which was relieved by supercoiling. On a solid surface the supercoils moved toward the end permanently blocked from rotating as a result of supercoil rolling over the surface and the formation of new supercoils that reduced fiber length between the initial supercoil and the wire tether. All of the motions are ramifications of cell growth with twist and the highly ordered multicellular state of macrofibers...|$|R
