5|$|There {{are various}} {{societal}} pressures that combine {{to create the}} double burden, including some economic thinking of domestic work, thoughts about net household gain, and the perceived notion {{that women are more}} likely to ask for maternity leave than men. Many classical economists believe that child care does not contribute to economic growth of the nation. They believe that welfare states such as Sweden are subsidizing work that is unproductive, and often think of children like a pet that only consumes without growing up to be productive workers. There is also the notion that the net household gain of a woman taking an hour away from her unpaid labor in order to do paid labor is always more than the net household gain of a man taking an hour away from paid labor to do unpaid labor. This creates the thought that women should do paid work and lose some time doing domestic jobs without the man taking time away from paid work to do domestic jobs, creating a deficit of hours necessary to do unpaid work that need to get filled. In addition, women are seen as more likely to ask for maternity leave than men, meaning that it is more difficult for them to obtain a well paying job, which has negative effects on <b>female</b> <b>employment.</b>|$|E

25|$|Women {{also played}} an {{important}} role in British industrial production during the war, in areas such as metals, chemicals, munitions, shipbuilding and engineering. At the beginning of the war in 1939 17.8% of women made up employment in these industries and by 1943 they made up 38.2%. With the start of the war there was an urgent need to expand the country’s labour force and women were seen as a source of factory labour. Before the war women in industrial production were exclusively on assembly, which was seen as cheap and undemanding work but during the war women were needed in other areas in the production process that were previously done by men such as Lathe operators. The Ministry of Labour created training centres that gave an introduction to the engineering process, and by 1941 women were allowed entrance as the importance of the engineering industry grew and became a large source of <b>female</b> <b>employment.</b> Areas such as aircraft manufacture, light and heavy general engineering and motor vehicle manufacturing all saw an increase in <b>female</b> <b>employment</b> during the war. Aircraft production saw the largest rise in <b>female</b> <b>employment</b> as it rose from 7% in 1935 to 40% in 1944. At the start of the war men who were already in engineering were prevented from going to war because engineering was seen as an important industry to war production but in 1940 there became a need for more female workers to supply the necessary labour for factory expansion. By 1941 with the shortage of skilled labour the Essential Workers Order was introduced which required all skilled workers to register and prevented workers from quitting from jobs that were deemed essential to the war effort without agreement from a National Service Officer. The Registration for the Employment Order in 1941 and the Women of Employment Order in 1942 also attempted to get more women into the workforce. The Women of Employment Order required women ages 18–45 to register for labour exchanges and by 1943 the maximum age was raised to 50, which brought an additional 20,000 women into the workforce. Aircraft production was given the top labour priority and many women were diverted into it with some even being transferred from agricultural production.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we develop}} and {{estimate}} {{a model of}} violence between romantically linked men and women. Physical violence is viewed as both a source of direct gratification and as an instrument for controlling the victim's behavior. Our model is a Stackleberg type model in which the assailant maximizes expected utility subject to the stochastic reaction function of the victim. Our model is estimated by a bounded-?influence regression technique because the process generating violence appears {{to lead to a}} heavy-tailed error distribution. Our empirical results suggest that increases in the assailants(i. e. the male's) income serve to increase violence, while increases in the proportion of the year that he is employed serve to decrease violence. Further, the employment effect is larger than the income effect. By way of contrast, our results suggest that the effect of a change in the <b>female's</b> <b>employment</b> or income depends heavily onher economic status relative to the male's. Finally, we find that improvements in the female's opportunites outside the relationship significantly reduce the level of violence. ...|$|R

A 2012 World Bank study showed that the expansion of public day care had no effect on female labor force participation. The low number of women entering the labor force causes Chile to rank low amongst upper-middle class countries regarding women in the work force despite higher educational training. In Chile, poorer women make up a smaller share of the workforce. A 2004 study showed that 81.4 percent of women worked in the service sector.|$|E

25|$|While {{prostitution}} controls {{have been}} relaxed {{at a local}} level, there is no impetus for legalisation at the central government level.

Given the underdeveloped nature of the Chinese economy and legal system, there is an argument that legalisation would further complicate the already difficult task of establishing the legal responsibility for third-party involvement in forced prostitution and the traffic in women. Surveys conducted in China suggest that clandestine forms of prostitution will continue to proliferate alongside the establishment of legal prostitution businesses, because of social sanctions against working or patronising a red-light district. Problems associated with <b>female</b> <b>employment</b> also limit the effectiveness of legalisation.

40|$|This paper {{estimates}} {{the effect of}} minimum wage regulation in 16 OECD countries, 1970 - 2008. Our treatment is motivated by Neumark and Wascher's (2004) seminal cross-country study using panel methods to estimate minimum wage effects among teenagers and young adults. Apart from the longer time interval examined here, a major departure {{of the present study}} is the focus on prime-age females, a group typically neglected in the component minimum wage literature. Another is our deployment of time-varying policy and institutional regressors. Yet another is our examination of unemployment and participation outcomes in addition to employment effects. We report strong evidence of adverse employment effects among adult females and lower participation, even if the unemployment effects are muted. Although we report some similar findings to Neumark and Wascher as to the role of labor market institutions and policies, we do not observe the same patterns in the institutional data; in particular, we can reject for our target group their finding of stronger disemployment effects in countries with the least regulated markets. minimum wages, wage fixing machinery, prime-age <b>females,</b> <b>employment,</b> unemployment, participation, cross-section time-series data, OECD countries, labor market flexibility, labor market institutions and policies...|$|R

25|$|Among {{the biggest}} {{obstacle}} to higher education for women is the physical and cultural distance of the universities from Negev Bedouin towns. Even the nearest universities require significant travel time to and from campus. In many instances, Bedouin women are only permitted {{to make the trip}} if accompanied by a male relative. Moreover, the university is a very different cultural space than Negev Bedouin towns. Jewish-Israeli culture is largely modern and secular, as opposed to the traditional, religious culture in Negev Bedouin society. This pronounced cultural difference is both an obstacle to enrolling at universities and a challenge women must overcome once they arrive. Additionally, societal pressure to marry young can conflict with attaining a university education. While there have been cases where women could attain a university education after marrying, the familial responsibilities (childcare and housework, for instance) provide additional challenges to completing their studies. Further, studying after marriage is entirely dependent upon the approval of the women's husbands. In other words, women are always dependent upon male consent for their studies, either from their fathers (or other male guardians) or their husbands. Finally, the lack of <b>female</b> <b>employment</b> opportunities means that studying at a university {{does not seem to be}} a reasonable investment, especially in instances where family resources are limited.|$|E

By 1923, in celebrating the 75th anniversary of the Seneca Falls Convention, only Harriot Stanton Blatch paid tribute to the role her mother had played in instigating the women's rights movement. Even as late as 1977, Anthony received the most attention as the founder of the movement, while Stanton was not mentioned. Over time, however, Stanton received more attention.|$|E

30|$|As {{shown in}} {{the lower part of}} Table  2, the {{increase}} in <b>female</b> full-time <b>employment</b> rates in the older age groups was accompanied by substantial increases in the part-time employment rates in both west and east Germany. These increases were substantially larger than for women aged  25 – 54, as shown by the pure time effects in the table which refer to the youngest age group. The increase in part-time employment among older women was particularly strong in both regions in the second period amounting to about 14  percentage points in the west and 16  percentage points in the east. Given the already quite high level of <b>female</b> part-time <b>employment</b> rates in west Germany (see Table  7), its substantial increase over the whole period seems even more remarkable than the somewhat larger increase estimated for women in the east where part-time employment was at a relatively low level {{at the beginning of the}} observation period. For men aged  60 – 65, the relatively low part-time employment rate has increased by about 6  percentage points since 2000 – 01 in west Germany, while no significant effects can be observed among men in east Germany.

500|$|Variously {{throughout}} the war, serious shortage of able-bodied men ("manpower") {{occurred in the}} country, and women were required to take {{on many of the}} traditional male roles, particularly in the area of arms manufacture; though this was only significant in the later years of the war, since unemployed men were often prioritised by employers. Women both found work in the munitions factories (as [...] "munitionettes") despite initial trade union opposition, which directly helped the war effort, but also in the Civil Service, where they took men's jobs, releasing them for the front. The number of women employed by the service increased from 33,000 in 1911 to over 102,000 by 1921. The overall increase in <b>female</b> <b>employment</b> is estimated at , from 5.9 to , and female trade union membership increased from 357,000 in 1914 to over a million by 1918—an increase of 160 percent. Beckett suggests that most of these were working class women going into work at a younger age than they would otherwise have done, or married women returning to work. This taken together with the fact that only 23 percent of women in the munitions industry were actually doing men's jobs, would limit substantially the overall impact of the war on the long-term prospects of the working woman.|$|E
500|$|This {{migration}} of {{women into the}} workforce shook the traditional ideology of gender roles, but importantly, it was the catalyst to the double burden becoming noticeable. The 1930s [...] "encouraged women to fulfill what Stalin termed the [...] "great and honorable duty that nature has given" [...] them. Evident in the Soviet Union, [...] "an officially sponsored cult of motherhood, buttressed by anti-abortion legislation" [...] accompanied by a [...] "depression of living standards" [...] led to industry's immense demand for laborers which got women into the industrial workforce in unprecedented numbers". Urban women thus found themselves assuming the [...] "double burden" [...] (also known as the [...] "double shift") of waged {{work outside the home}} and the lion's share of unpaid labor within it." [...] The Second World War is typically seen as a catalyst for increasing <b>female</b> <b>employment.</b> Best exemplified by [...] Rosie the Riveter propaganda of an efficient, patriotic, woman worker, World War II increased demand for female labor to replace that of the [...] "16million men mobilized to serve in the Armed Forces". While a substantial number of women worked in war factories, the majority of jobs were in the service sector. This caused the gendered expectations for that time to be altered and roles to be both tested and reassigned for the incoming decades.|$|E
500|$|One of the {{political}} pressures, it is suggested by Susan Himmelweit {{is the issue of}} whom to empower. When there are considerations of policies, politicians usually only consider work as paid labor, and do {{not take into account the}} interdependence between unpaid work and paid work. It is also often common to think that women make economic decisions similarly to men. This is typically not the case, because for men, payment is simply a compensation for lost leisure time. However, for women, when they are working in the paid sector, they are still losing money because they have to make provisions for the domestic labor they are unable to do, such as caring for children or making dinner from scratch due to lack of resources such as child care. Her net financial gain is less than the financial gain of a man because she has to spend her earnings on providing for these provisions. In addition, increasing paid work hours in order to have more money may have negative effects on the woman due to the increased total work hours and decreased leisure time. [...] Therefore, policies that give greater power to people who do paid labor, such as cutting back on public expenditure in order to lessen income taxes have an adverse effect on <b>female</b> <b>employment</b> and the effect that the double burden has on females. Such policies give greater power and consideration towards people who work in the paid sector, and less towards people who work in the unpaid sector.|$|E
