The Colt {{had a number of}} initial problems, due to ill <b>fitting</b> <b>parts</b> in the trigger mechanism, which eventually required the attention of a manufacturer's representative, who fitted a new trigger mechanism. Once this was done, the pistol fired the remaining 293 rounds of the 500 allotted for the endurance test, plus an additional 150 rounds with no malfunctions. Another supply of ammunition, consisting of 350 rounds of low velocity [...]38 ACP ammunition (935 ft/s) was also tested, with no adjustments to the recoil spring. This was done to test the repaired trigger mechanism, and while it was not expected to function with the pistol tuned for the 1200 ft/s ammunition, only four failures were experienced with this ammunition. The pistol fired all ten rounds with no malfunctions during the dust test. After accelerated rusting with sal ammoniac, the pistol was frozen so that the slide would not move. A sharp blow {{on the edge of a}} table with the slide freed it enough to allow the slide to operate, and a round to be chambered. After firing the first round, the slide failed to return to battery, but was readily closed, and the remaining rounds functioned without malfunction. All remaining ammunition, 23 rounds, was then fired through the rusted gun with no malfunction.|$|E

This shape is {{those of the}} corner <b>fitting</b> <b>parts</b> used as corner brackets. The device shows that is possible to obtain such geometry by punch and die forming thanks to strong blank holder loads and an appropriate reinforcement. There is no wrinkle in the tetrahedral part of the formed shape but the six blank holders create wrinkles in the plane part of the preform. The shear angles reach 60 ° {{but there is no}} wrinkling in this zone. The presented forming process enables the experimental validation of a semi-discrete simulation approach. It is shown that shear angles and wrinkle shapes obtained by this numerical approach are in good agreement with the forming experiment. The computation of the shape of wrinkles after forming is necessary to check that these wrinkles do not expand to the useful part of the preform. This needs to take the bending stiffnesses into account. This is not the case when the simulation is based on a membrane approach...|$|E

30|$|The {{algorithm}} for {{the evaluation}} of parameters of rotationally symmetric aspheric surfaces was described and tested. The sub-nanometre precision of fitting was reached with this new robust and fast algorithm. The algorithm also does not need precise estimation of parameters for the initial iteration. It allows ISO 10110 characterization with the conic section parameters of surfaces that are rotated and translated as it is common in the data output from measurement devices and alignment markers on lens are not needed. The additional criterion for residuals can effectively remove unuseful data to keep results for the main part of aperture unaffected by local imperfections. Moreover, the part of algorithm that finds the correct coordinate system and removes outliers can be used independently on the conic section <b>fitting</b> <b>part.</b> Thus the algorithm will be useful for the optical community for precise characterisation and testing of aspheric lens.|$|R

40|$|Insulin binding to the insulin {{receptor}} (IR) is {{the first}} key step in initiating downstream signaling cascades for glucose homeostasis in higher organisms. The molecular details of insulin recognition by IR are not yet completely understood, but a picture of hormone/receptor interactions {{at one of the}} epitopes (Site 1) is beginning to emerge from recent structural evidence. However, insulin-bound structures of truncated IR suggest that crystallographic conformation of insulin cannot be accommodated in the full IR ectodomain due to steric overlap of insulin with the first two type III fibronectin domains (F 1 and F 2), which are contributed to the insulin binding-pocket by the second subunit in the IR homodimer. A conformational change in the F 1 -F 2 pair has thus been suggested. In this work, we present an all-atom structural model of complex of insulin and the IR ectodomain, where no structural overlap of insulin with the receptor domains (F 1 and F 2) is observed. This structural model was arrived at by flexibly <b>fitting</b> <b>parts</b> of our earlier insulin/IR all-atom model into the simulated density maps of crystallized constructs combined with conformational sampling from apo-IR solution conformations.

40|$|Pigments {{preserved}} on arrow and dart weaponry fragments from Gypsum Cave, Nevada, {{were analyzed}} by laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS), X-Ray diffraction (XRD), and electron microprobe (EM) to determine their chemical composition, mineralogy, and physical structure. Results show {{that a variety of}} minerals were used to produce the green, red, pink, brown and black pigments. Although variation in composition and mineralogy suggests some degree of experimentation, similarities in the pigments suggest the application of standardized recipes for certain colors. Pigments applied to the more ancient darts are systematically different for cane vs. wooden implements, despite the finding that cane and wooden fragments were often used as <b>fitting</b> <b>parts</b> of the same composite weapon. For example, greens applied to darts are based on malachite while greens applied to cane are based on green earth minerals. The smaller sample of arrows shows many similarities to the more ancient darts, suggesting the transmission of information about pigmenting was fairly conservative over thousands of years in the southwest Great Basin, but does not show the same wood-cane dichotomy. hile the ethnographic record suggests pigment was widespread in the ancient Great Basin of North America, archaeological examples and studies of such pigments are relatively few.

40|$|Deformable models {{represent}} a useful approach to approximate objects from collected data points. We propose {{to augment the}} basic approaches designed to handle mostly compact objects or objects of known topology. Our approach can fit simultaneously more than one curve or surface to approximate multiple topologically complex objects by using (1) the residual data points, (2) the badly <b>fitting</b> <b>parts</b> of the approximating surface, and (3) appropriate Boolean operations. In 2 -D, B-snakes [3] are used to approximate each object (pattern). In 3 -D, an analytical surface representation, based on the elements detected, is presented. The global representation of a 3 -D object, in terms of elements and their connection, {{takes the form of}} B-spline and Bézier surfaces. A Bézier surface is used to connect different elements, and the connecting surface itself conforms to the data points nearby through energy minimization. This way, a G 1 continuity surface is achieved for the underlying 3 -D object. We present experiments on synthetic and real data in 2 -D and 3 -D. In these experiments, multiple complex patterns and objects with through holes are segmented. The system proceeds automatically without human interaction or any prior knowledge of the topology of the underlying object. c ○ 1999 Academic Press Key Words: snakes; deformable model; B-spline; segmentation; energy minimization...|$|E
