40|$|This study {{examines}} two complex syntactic dependencies (complement control and sentence-final temporal adjunct control) and one pragmatic dependency (controlled verbal gerund subjects) {{in children with}} ASD. Sixteen high-functioning (HFA) children (aged 6 to 16) with a diagnosis of autism and no language impairment, matched on age, gender and non-verbal MA to one TD control group, and on age, gender and verbal MA to another TD control group, undertook three picture-selection tasks. Task 1 measured their base-line interpretations of the empty categories (ec). Task 2 preceded these sentence sets with a weakly established topic cueing an alternative referent and Task 3 with a strongly established topic cueing an alternative referent. In complement control (Ron persuaded Hermione ec to kick the ball) and sentence-final temporal adjunct control (Harry tapped Luna while ec feeding the owl), the <b>reference</b> of the <b>ec</b> is argued to be related obligatorily to the object and subject respectively. In controlled verbal-gerund subjects (ec Rowing the boat clumsily made Luna seasick), the <b>ec’s</b> <b>reference</b> is resolved pragmatically. Referent choices across the three tasks were compared. TD children chose the object uniformly in complement control across all tasks but in adjunct control, preferences shifted towards the object in Task 3. In controlled verbal-gerund subjects, they exhibited a strong preference for an internal-referent interpretation in Task 1, which shifted {{in the direction of}} the cues in Tasks 2 and 3. HFA children gave a mixed performance. They patterned with their TD counterparts on complement control and controlled verbal-gerund subjects but performed marginally differently on adjunct control: no TD groups were influenced by the weakly established topic in Task 2 but all groups were influenced by the strongly established topic in Task 3. HFA children were less influenced than the TD children, resulting in them making fewer object choices overall but revealing parallel patterns of performance. In this first study of three sub-types of control in ASD, we demonstrate that HFA children consult the same pragmatic cues to the same degree as TD children, in spite of the diverse pragmatic deficits reported for this population...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Medulloblastoma (MB) is {{the most}} common type of {{malignant}} childhood brain tumour. Although deregulated microRNA (miRNA) expression has been linked to MB pathogenesis, the selection of appropriate candidate endogenous control (<b>EC)</b> <b>reference</b> genes for MB miRNA expression profiling studies has not been systematically addressed. In this study we utilised reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) to identify the most appropriate <b>EC</b> <b>reference</b> genes for the accurate normalisation of miRNA expression data in primary human MB specimens and neural stem cells. Results Expression profiling of 662 miRNAs and six small nuclear/ nucleolar RNAs in primary human MB specimens, two CD 133 + neural stem cell (NSC) populations and two CD 133 - neural progenitor cell (NPC) populations was performed using TaqMan low-density array (TLDA) cards. Minimal intra-card variability for candidate <b>EC</b> <b>reference</b> gene replicates was observed, however significant inter-card variability was identified between replicates present on both TLDA cards A and B. A panel of 18 potentially suitable <b>EC</b> <b>reference</b> genes was identified for the normalisation of miRNA expression on TLDA cards. These candidates were not significantly differentially expressed between CD 133 + NSCs/ CD 133 - NPCs and primary MB specimens. Of the six sn/snoRNA <b>EC</b> <b>reference</b> genes recommended by the manufacturer, only RNU 44 was uniformly expressed between primary MB specimens and CD 133 + NSC/CD 133 - NPC populations (P [*]=[*] 0. 709; FC[*]=[*] 1. 02). The suitability of candidate <b>EC</b> <b>reference</b> genes was assessed using geNorm and NormFinder software, with hsa-miR- 301 a and hsa-miR- 339 - 5 p found to be the most uniformly expressed <b>EC</b> <b>reference</b> genes on TLDA card A and hsa-miR- 425 * and RNU 24 for TLDA card B. Conclusions A panel of 18 potential <b>EC</b> <b>reference</b> genes that were not significantly differentially expressed between CD 133 + NSCs/ CD 133 - NPCs and primary human MB specimens was identified. The top ranked <b>EC</b> <b>reference</b> genes described here should be validated in a larger cohort of specimens to verify their utility as controls for the normalisation of RT-qPCR data generated in MB miRNA expression studies. Importantly, inter-card variability observed between replicates of certain candidate <b>EC</b> <b>reference</b> genes has major implications for the accurate normalisation of miRNA expression data obtained using the miRNA TLDA platform. </p...|$|E

In order {{to characterize the}} associated geochemical processes through major-ion and determination of stable (δ 18 O; δ 2 H; δ 11 B) and radiogenic isotopic ratios (δ 87 Sr) a total of 46 wells were sampled in Graciosa and Pico, as well as 51 wells from other islands. New hydrological insights for the region: The overall groundwater chemistry is mainly controlled by Cl and Na, which account respectively for 10. 4 %– 46. 9 % and 16 %– 39. 7 % of the relative major-ion content. Mean electrical conductivity (EC) in Graciosa is in the range 308 − 3462  μS/cm, while hand-dug wells in Pico are highly mineralized (1758 – 9732  μS/cm). Drilled wells in Pico {{are in the range}} of 186  μS/cm to 5625  μS/cm. Besides mixture with seawater, groundwater chemistry is also influenced by dissolution of silicate minerals which also contributes to water composition. Moreover, 18 O and 2 H stable isotope data show that a few samples depict an evaporative effect, resulting in heavier isotopic compositions besides mixing with a marine source. About 70 % of the wells in Graciosa and Pico exceed the 200  mg Cl/L and the <b>EC</b> Portuguese <b>reference</b> values, severely constraining water supply.

40|$|The lack of {{standard}} reference materials for calibrating, troubleshooting and intercomparing instruments that measure {{the properties of}} black carbon, {{commonly referred to as}} soot, has been a major obstacle that hinders improved understanding of how climate and health is impacted by this ubiquitous component of the atmosphere. A different approach is offered here as a means of constructing precisely controlled material with fractions of organic carbon (OC) on the surface of elemental carbon (EC) whose structure reflects that of combustion particles found in the atmosphere. The proposed soot reference material (SRM) uses elemental carbon as a basis substrate for surface coatings of organic compounds that are representative of main classes of organics identified in the coverage of soot produced by fossil fuel burning.

Comparison of the nominal fraction of OC deposited on the EC substrate with the fraction measured with thermal/optical analysis (TOA) shows excellent agreement.

Negative mass balances of some pharmaceuticals and metabolites were observed within the WWTW, suggesting possible back-transformation of ECs during wastewater treatment.

At both sites, ET PT approximated mid-period ET EC more closely than the ASCE equations ((ET PT -ET EC) < 170 mm). Analysis of applied water and precipitation, soil moisture, leaf stomatal resistance, and canopy cover suggest that the lower observed ET EC was not the result of water stress or reduced vegetation cover. Use of a custom-calibrated bulk canopy resistance improved the reference ET estimate and reduced seasonal ET discrepancy relative to ET PT and ET EC in the less windy field and had mixed performance in the windier field.

The health status ranges from specific pathogen free animals to minimal disease and conventional animals. IAH's unique facilities and scientific capabilities make research from the single gene through to the whole animal possible. The institute has four divisions: immunology and pathology, epidemiology, molecular biology and environmental microbiology. IAH aims to advance scientific knowledge of the major farm animal diseases and has an international lead in many of its research programmes. The Institute also has important international responsibilities such as providing reference diagnostic facilities for foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV) and rinderpest (it maintains emergency vaccine banks for FMDV). IAH supplies rinderpest vaccine to control outbreaks and a seed virus to vaccine laboratories throughout Asia and Africa. It plays {{a leading role in the}} Pan African Rinderpest Campaign. A new live capripox/rinderpest vaccine developed by IAH is proving highly effective in controlled trials in Kenya. This very stable vaccine can be freeze-dried and re-constituted on site. Simple-to-use FMDV detection kits have been developed and are distributed world-wide. Part of the Institute's role as a World and <b>EC</b> <b>Reference</b> Laboratory is to carry out and standardize diagnostic tests and also to supply reagents for diagnostic kits world-wide. At short notice the IAH laboratory can provide at least half a million doses of fully formulated vaccine of each of six strains of FMDV antigens. The Institute is also designated as the FAO Regional Centre for bluetongue, rinderpest, peste des petite ruminants and African Horse sickness. As an OIE Reference Laboratory for Marek's Disease of poultry, lAH's responsibilities include providing standard strains of the virus, diagnostic standards, collecting and processing data and providing training. Training in diagnostic methods is provided by IAH as part of the Pan African Rinderpest Campaign. It supplies all rinderpest ELISA kits for the 28 African countries that are part of the Campaign and demand for the kits is still increasing. Other recent examples of technology transfer are the commercialization of vaccines against coccidiosis in poultry, and respiratory syncytial disease and mucosal disease in cattle. IAH has a specialist animal health library, available to bona fide scientists by prior arrangement. It also runs an abstract service for exotic diseases and information service. Copies of lAH's annual report are available from the Institute.

40|$|Abstract Background The new microcapillary and fluorescence-based EC IVD-qualified Muse™ Auto CD 4 /CD 4 % single-platform assay (EMD Millipore Corporation, Merck Life Sciences, KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) for CD 4 T cell {{numeration}} {{in absolute}} number and in percentage was evaluated using Central African patients’ samples compared against the <b>reference</b> <b>EC</b> IVD-qualified BD FACSCount (Becton–Dickinson, USA) flow cytometer. Methods EDTA-blood samples from 124 adults, 10 adolescents, 13 children and 3 infants {{were tested in}} parallel at 2 reference laboratories in Bangui. Results The Muse™ technique was highly reproducible, with low intra- and inter-run variabilities less than 15 %. CD 4 T cell counts of Muse™ and BD FACSCount in absolute number and percentage were highly correlated (r 2  =  0. 99 and 0. 98, respectively). The mean absolute bias between Muse™ and BD FACSCount cells in absolute number and percentage were − 5. 91  cells/µl (95 % CI − 20. 90 to 9. 08) with limits of agreement from − 77. 50 to 202. 40  cells/µl, and + 1. 69 %CD 4 (95 % CI ± 1. 29 to + 2. 09), respectively. The percentages of outliers outside the limits of agreement were nearly similar in absolute number (8 %) and percentage (10 %). CD 4 T cell counting by Muse™ allowed identifying the majority of individuals with CD 4 T cell < 200, < 350 or < 750  cells/µl corresponding to the relevant thresholds of therapeutic care, with sensitivities of 95. 5 – 100 % and specificities of 83. 9 – 100 %. Conclusions The Muse™ Auto CD 4 /CD 4 % Assay analyzer is a reliable alternative flow cytometer for CD 4 T lymphocyte enumeration {{to be used in}} routine immunological monitoring according to World Health Organization recommendations in HIV-infected adults as well as children living in resource-constrained settings...|$|R
40|$|Large {{measurement}} {{networks of}} Black Carbon (BC) aerosol {{are important for}} understanding its impacts on climate and health. PM 2. 5 filter samples were collected at three urban US locations and one India urban location and were analyzed for Elemental Carbon (EC) and Organic Carbon (OC) concentrations using thermo-optical analysis (TO) following the IMPROVE protocol for US samples and NIOSH protocol for India samples. Site and season-specific calibrations of an inexpensive photo-reference (PR) method were created with TO EC measurements of the US filter samples whereas method-specific calibration was prepared using India filter samples. Piece-wise calibration based on filter loading was also explored. Calibrations were applied across different sites, seasons and methods to determine Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and average absolute error in each calibration by comparing with <b>reference</b> <b>EC</b> measurements. This paper investigates various calibrations of PR method to improve the agreement between PR method and TO EC measurements. Difference in BC estimated error remained within ± 10 % among three urban US site-specific calibrations, which suggests that site-specific calibrations are not necessary. Season based calibrations were found to perform best (least RMSE/Mean EC), when applied to same season test samples but resulted in large errors of up to 60 % RMSE/Mean EC when applied to different seasons, thus warranting the use of season-specific calibrations of the PR method. RMSE relative to mean EC was 50 % when calibration prepared from US samples (IMPROVE protocol) {{was used to test}} India samples (NIOSH protocol). However, method-specific calibration prepared from India samples reduced the error to 24 %, showing the large dependency of PR method on reference BC measurement method. Calibration based on filter loading reduced the RMSE slightly for both US urban and India samples and indicated that filters with loadings higher than 20 μg cm− 2 are not suitable for estimating BC by PR method...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} broad-brush {{survey of the}} phenomenology, history and {{importance}} of the electron-cloud effect (ECE). We briefly discuss the simulation techniques used to quantify the electron-cloud (EC) dynamics. Finally, we present in more detail an effective theory to describe the EC density build-up {{in terms of a}} few effective parameters. For further details, the reader is encouraged to refer to the proceedings of many prior workshops, either dedicated to EC or with significant EC contents, including the entire “ECLOUD ” series [1 – 22]. In addition, the proceedings of the various flavors of Particle Accelerator Conferences [23] contain a large number of EC-related publications. The ICFA Beam Dynamics Newsletter series [24] contains one dedicated issue, and several occasional articles, on <b>EC.</b> An extensive <b>reference</b> database is the LHC website on EC [25]. THE BASIC OVERALL PICTURE The qualitative picture of the development of an electron cloud for a bunched beam is as follows: 1. Upon being injected into an empty chamber, a beam generates electrons by one or more mechanisms, usually referred to as “primary, ” or “seed, ” electrons. 2. These primary electrons get rattled around the chamber from the passage of successive bunches. 3. As these electrons hit the chamber surface they yield secondary electrons, which are, in turn, added to the existing electron population. This process repeats with the passage of successive bunches. The EC density ne grows until a saturation level is reached. The density gradually decays following beam extraction, or during the passage of a gap in the beam. In many cases of interest, the net electron motion in the longitudinal direction, i. e. along the beam direction, is not significant, hence the electron cloud is sensibly localized. For this reason, in first approximation, it makes sense to study it at various locations around the ring independently of the others. In addition, given that the essential dynamics of the electrons is in the transverse plane, i. e. perpendicular to the beam direction, two-dimensional simulation...|$|R
