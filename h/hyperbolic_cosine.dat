Under the effects of sine <b>hyperbolic</b> and <b>cosine</b> <b>hyperbolic</b> oscillations, the general solutions are derived for the motions of incompressible Maxwell fluid.

2500|$|This <b>hyperbolic</b> <b>cosine</b> {{function}} {{describes the}} shape of a catenary. A chain that supports only its own weight forms a catenary; the chain is purely in tension. Likewise, an inverted catenary arch that supports only its own weight is purely in compression, with no shear. The catenary arch is the stablest of all arches since [...] "the thrust passes down through the legs and is absorbed in the foundations, whereas in other arches, the pressure tends to force the legs apart." [...] The Gateway Arch itself is not a common catenary, but a more general curve of the form y=Acosh (Bx). This makes it an inverted weighted catenary. Saarinen chose a weighted catenary over a normal catenary curve because it looked less pointed and less steep. In 1959, he caused some confusion about the actual shape of the arch when he wrote, [...] "This arch is not a true parabola, as is often stated. Instead it is a catenary curve—the curve of a hanging chain—a curve in which the forces of thrust are continuously kept within the center of the legs of the arch." [...] William V. Thayer, a professor of mathematics at St. Louis Community College, later wrote to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch calling {{attention to the fact that}} the structure was a weighted catenary.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{univariate}} Taylor formula without remainder allows {{to reproduce}} a function completely from certain derivative values. Thus one {{can look for}} Hilbert spaces in which the Taylor formula acts as a reproduc-tion formula. It turns {{out that there are}} many Hilbert spaces which allow this, and they should be called Taylor spaces. They have certain reproduc-ing kernels which are either polynomials or power series with nonnegative coecients. Consequently, Taylor spaces can be spanned by translates of various classical special functions such as exponentials, rationals, <b>hyperbolic</b> <b>cosines,</b> logarithms, and Bessel functions. Since the theory of kernelbased interpolation and approximation is wellestablished, this leads to a variety of results. In particular, interpolation by shifted exponentials, rationals, <b>hyperbolic</b> <b>cosines,</b> logarithms, and Bessel functions provides exponentially convergent approximations to analytic functions, generalizung the classical Bernstein theorem for polynomial approximation to analytic functions...|$|R

Six sets of multibeam observations of the lower atmosphere made by the Indian Mesosphere-Stratosphere-Troposphere (MST) radar are used for the results analysis.
