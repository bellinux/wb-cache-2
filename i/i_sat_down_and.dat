Soon after, she began focusing upon script writing and one of her first screenplays was a feature film adaptation of Elizabeth Smart's poem By Grand Central Station <b>I</b> <b>Sat</b> <b>Down</b> <b>and</b> Wept. Despite interest from various producers, the film was never made. However, the quality of the script opened doors for Lamson.|$|E

500|$|Hardly {{knowing what}} I was doing... <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> {{started to work}} out an agonized craving for the sun and a furious revolt against that terrible cheerless, heartless food by writing down {{descriptions}} of Mediterranean and Middle Eastern cooking. Even to write words like apricot, olives and butter, rice and lemons, oil and almonds, produced assuagement. Later I {{came to realize that}} in the England of 1947, those were dirty words I was putting down.|$|E
500|$|She and <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> {{wrote this}} song about some serious insecurities {{that we had}} {{when we first started}} down this road with each other, and we both had trust issues.

500|$|Series creator Chris Carter {{noted that}} the episode's {{creation}} [...] "was {{the culmination of a}} lot of ideas. Generally, when we pitch stories to the staff everyone comments on them, and Darin Morgan called this the kitchen sink episode, because it had so much in it, he didn't know how we would pull it off. But I'm very proud of the script. David Duchovny and I worked quite closely on the story and {{he had a lot of}} input, and then <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> wrote the script". He felt that the episode ended the season in the best manner possible, asking more questions than it answered. The episode tried to make similar cliffhangers as the previous season finale, with revelations such as Mulder's father being part of the conspiracy and later killed to [...] "prove anything could happen in [...] The X-Files".|$|E

500|$|Despite {{the racial}} and social {{implications}} of R and {{country at the}} time, Charles {{did not agree with}} contemporary views of race records and other genres, including pop and country, as essentially different. In an interview with Ben Fong-Torres of Rolling Stone, Charles said of the similarities between the blues and country music, [...] "he words to country songs are very earthy like the blues, see, very down. They're not as dressed up, and the people are very honest and say, 'Look, I miss you, darlin', so I went out and I got drunk in this bar.' That's the way you say it. Where in Tin Pan Alley will say, 'Oh, I missed you darling, so I went to this restaurant and <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> I had dinner for one.' That's cleaned up now, you see? But country songs and the blues is like it is." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{release of}} the duet was first {{announced}} via Stefani's Twitter account, where she posted the album notes of If I'm Honest, which revealed her name in the track listing. In an interview with People, Shelton expressed that {{the best part of}} the duet was [...] "the honest way it came about". He stated: [...] "There's not a third ghost writer, there's not five writers on it. It's just she and <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> wrote this song [...] and I couldn't be happier about [...]" [...] He further explained that the song was written about [...] "some serious insecurities that we had when we first started down this road with each other"; he called the end result [...] "perfect". The concept for [...] "Go Ahead and Break My Heart" [...] was developed by both singers, and began with Shelton writing the first verse, followed by Stefani creating the second, which Shelton described: ...|$|E
500|$|On 14 October 2005 Eon Productions, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Sony Pictures Entertainment {{announced}} {{at a press}} conference in London that Daniel Craig would be the sixth actor to portray Bond in the Eon series (although seventh film Bond overall). A tuxedo- and lifejacket-clad Craig arrived via a Royal Navy speedboat. Craig had based his acceptance of the role on the strength of the script for the first film, Casino Royale; he later recalled that [...] "once <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> read the story, I just thought that I wanted to tell ... I'm a big Bond fan, and I love what he represents". Significant controversy followed the decision, with some critics and fans expressing doubt the producers had made the right choice. Throughout the entire production period, Internet campaigns such as danielcraigisnotbond.com expressed their dissatisfaction and threatened to boycott the film in protest. Craig, unlike previous actors, was not considered by the protesters to fit the tall, dark, handsome and charismatic image of Bond to which viewers had been accustomed. Many disparagingly called him [...] "James Blonde", believing the [...] blond-haired blue-eyed rugged Craig to be far fitting from the traditional tall, dark and suave actors who had earlier portrayed him. The Daily Mirror ran a front-page news story critical of Craig, with the headline, The Name's Bland – James Bland.|$|E

2500|$|Meanwhile, By Grand Central Station <b>I</b> <b>Sat</b> <b>Down</b> <b>and</b> Wept {{had been}} {{circulating}} in London and New York, acquiring a cult following {{that led to}} its paperback reissue in 1966 and critical acclaim.

2500|$|So <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> did a huge list of {{everything}} I had read ... and when I finished the list I {{handed it to}} them [...] They said that's impossible, you couldn't read that many books in a year, two years, and I had read all of those books in {{two and a half}} weeks - and well, that's The Secret.|$|E
60|$|Having been {{unsuccessful}} {{in my first}} attempt to make her speak, and having now stood silent for some moments, I felt it might be unwise to make another trial just then, for my object would be too plain. <b>I</b> therefore <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> began dictating.|$|R
60|$|So <b>I</b> just <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> rested, {{letting the}} oxen feed {{throughout}} {{the hours of}} light on the rich grasses which grew upon the bottom-most slopes of the big mountain where we were camped by a stream, not more than a hundred yards above the timber line.|$|R

2500|$|In 1941, after {{becoming}} pregnant, Smart returned to Canada, settling in Pender Harbour, British Columbia {{to have the}} child she would name Georgina. Barker attempted to visit her in Canada, but Smart's family exerted influence on government officials, and consequently he was turned back at the border, cited with [...] "moral turpitude." [...] It was during this time that Smart produced what would become her best-known work, By Grand Central Station <b>I</b> <b>Sat</b> <b>Down</b> <b>and</b> Wept (1945).|$|E
2500|$|Just 2000 {{copies of}} By Grand Central Station <b>I</b> <b>Sat</b> <b>Down</b> <b>and</b> Wept were {{published}} in 1945, {{and it did not}} achieve popularity until a good deal later. It is a fictional work, largely based on Smart's affair with Barker up until that point. [...] "The power of emotion to transform one’s perspective on the world," [...] a recent Open Letters Monthly review of the novel states, [...] "is the theme of this wildly poetic novel. The inspiration for Smart’s classic work of prose poetry is just as famous as the book itself.|$|E

I'd always had this {{reservation}} about my first encounter with top dog players and I thought they were rubbishing me, but with traditional black people communication always happens very slowly and that's how it was. After a while I got to understand that they were pleased at seeing it being played by a whitefella with his own spirit.

2500|$|In April 1940 he {{was traded}} to the Detroit Lions in {{exchange}} for two rookie players. However, Smukler decided to leave football and join the United States Army. He said, “I got $3,000 a year for playing football professionally. It was great during the season. Everybody shook your hand, slapped you on the back, and told you what a swell fellow you were. But the rest of the time, I couldn’t get a job.” Between football seasons Smukler could only make money doing piecework as a glove cutter. “It was enough to discourage any man, and I kept thinking about what I was going to do when I couldn’t play football anymore. <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> figured it out and then decided my best bet was the Army.” ...|$|E
2500|$|The music {{came from}} Brian Wilson's first {{psychedelic}} experience. He was quoted saying in 1986, [...] " [...] something I'm {{very proud of}} in a sense because it represents the Beach Boys really greatest record production we’ve ever made. It goes back to 1965 when I was sitting in my apartment, wondering {{how to write a}} song about girls, because I love girls. I mean, everybody loves girls." [...] He added in 2007, [...] "I was thinking about the music from cowboy movies. And <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> started playing it, bum-buhdeeda, bum-buhdeeda. I did that for about an hour. I got these chords going. Then I got this melody, it came pretty fast after that." [...] Inspiration came from the rhythm of [...] "Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring". In 2015, he explained: [...] "'California Girls' had that beat — it's called a shuffle beat — and that's definitely a Bach influence." ...|$|E
2500|$|Michael Chabon, in his {{afterword}} to his Pulitzer Prize-winning novel The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay, {{a fictional}} account of two early comics pioneers, wrote, [...] "I want {{to acknowledge the}} deep debt I owe in this and everything else I've ever written {{to the work of}} the late Jack Kirby, the King of Comics." [...] Director James Cameron said Kirby inspired the look of his film Aliens, calling it [...] "not intentional in the sense <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> looked at all my favorite comics and studied them for this film, but, yeah, Kirby's work was definitely in my subconscious programming. The guy was a visionary. Absolutely. And he could draw machines like nobody's business. He was sort of like A.

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>sat</b> {{there some}} moments {{straddling}} that branch. Then I descended, {{and went back}} to the place I had dropped my rifle, and securing that I stood a moment listening.

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> accordingly, <b>and</b> {{tried to}} compose myself; but, to say truth, I {{was so much}} overjoyed and excited {{by the sight of}} my old friend and {{companion}} that I had some difficulty at first in fixing my attention on what he said, the more especially that he spoke with extreme volubility, and interrupted his discourse very frequently, in order to ask questions or to explain.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>sat</b> me <b>down</b> <b>and</b> {{stared at}} the house of Shaws.
