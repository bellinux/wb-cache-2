During the film's production he ended {{his relationship with his}} common-law wife Marguerite and began another with script girl Dido Freire, whom he <b>had</b> <b>known</b> <b>for</b> twelve years and was Alain Renoir's nanny. Eventually Dido married Renoir.|$|E
5|$|Since his death, {{multiple}} {{people have}} been arrested for helping Clemmons {{during and after the}} Lakewood shooting. Authorities claim the accomplices misled police about his whereabouts, gave him cell phones and money, applied first aid to his gunshot wounds and tried to help him leave the state. Among those arrested were Clemmons' sister, who bandaged his wounds and provided him transportation. Authorities arrested five other people for assisting Clemmons: Letricia Nelson, Quiana Williams, Douglas Davis, Eddie Davis, and Ricky Hinton. Darcus Allen {{was arrested and charged with}} aggravated first-degree murder for his alleged role as Clemmons' getaway driver. Allen claims he did not know Clemmons' plans when he drove him to the coffee shop, but authorities argued he <b>had</b> <b>known</b> <b>for</b> days that Clemmons planned to murder police officers.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. VIII Corps {{had arrived}} in the United Kingdom in December 1943, and was {{commanded}} by Major General Emil F. Reinhardt, who Middleton <b>had</b> <b>known</b> <b>for</b> many years. While he was an able commander, his lack of combat experience resulted in his being replaced by Middleton (though Reinhardt would later command a division in the European fighting). Middleton's first stop in Europe before assuming command of VIII Corps was to confer with his friend and commander, Dwight Eisenhower. Eisenhower had asked Middleton about his views on making Patton the commander of an army. Middleton {{thought it was a good}} idea since Patton was such an able fighter. Eisenhower agreed, but was concerned about Patton's propensity to embarrass the Army by things he said to the press. Following this Patton was given command of the Third Army, which was headquartered north of London during the preparation for the invasion of Normandy.|$|E

5|$|U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) {{documents}} declassified in 2006 {{show that}} the capture of Eichmann caused alarm at the CIA and West German Bundesnachrichtendienst (BND). Both organizations <b>had</b> <b>known</b> <b>for</b> {{at least two years}} that Eichmann was hiding in Argentina, but did not act, because it did not serve their interests in the Cold War to do so. Both were concerned about what Eichmann might say in his testimony about West German national security advisor Hans Globke, who had coauthored several antisemitic Nazi laws (including the Nuremberg Laws). The documents also revealed that both agencies had used some of Eichmann's former Nazi colleagues to spy on European communist countries.|$|E
5|$|Silent Civilians {{signed to}} Corporate Punishment Records in January, 2005 and {{began work on}} their debut album, Rebirth of the Temple. However, in May Santos {{announced}} they left CPR for reasons {{he was unable to}} discuss. The band began talking to several labels after this and pushed the release of their debut to late 2005 or early 2006. The album was recorded at Undercity Recordings, with production duties handled by former Machine Head and Soulfly guitarist Logan Mader, and co-production handled by his partner, Lucas Banker. The band also announced they had changed their name to Silent Civilian. In June, guitarist Ryan Ready left the band due to personal reasons, not relating to the band. Santos sought a replacement, and the following day to Ready's departure set up auditions. Tim Mankowski, who Santos <b>had</b> <b>known</b> <b>for</b> 15 years and played in the band Basic Enigma with him, was hired as the new guitarist.|$|E

Inos crew, unaware that the war had ended on 15 February 1815, fired grapeshot and small arms at the British boats, causing them to shear off. Ino crew then set fire to her and took to their boats and some improvised rafts. A schooner that came out from Charleston rescued almost all. The Inos crew believed that Captain Nourse of Severn <b>had</b> <b>known</b> <b>for</b> some days that the war had ended. The delay of payment of the head money may have been due to the need to adjudicate the case.|$|E

25|$|Upon Starr's {{retirement}} in 2000, he was succeeded by Daily News writer Jay Maeder and artist Andrew Pepoy, beginning Monday, June 5, 2000. Pepoy was eventually succeeded by Alan Kupperberg (2001–2004) and Ted Slampyak (2004–2010). The new creators updated the strip's settings and characters {{for a modern}} audience, giving Annie a new hairdo and jeans rather than her trademark dress. However, Maeder's new stories never managed {{to live up to}} the pathos and emotional engagement of the stories by Gray and Starr. Annie herself was often reduced to a supporting role and was a far less complex character than the girl readers <b>had</b> <b>known</b> <b>for</b> seven decades. Maeder's writing style tended to make the stories feel like tongue-in-cheek adventures compared to the serious, heartfelt tales Gray and Starr favored. Annie gradually lost subscribers during the 2000s, and by 2010, it was running in fewer than 20 U.S. newspapers.|$|E
25|$|On November 28, Arbuckle testified as the defense's final witness. Arbuckle was simple, direct, and unflustered in both {{direct and}} cross examination. In his testimony, Arbuckle claimed that Rappe (whom he {{testified that he}} <b>had</b> <b>known</b> <b>for</b> five or six years) came into the party room (1220) around noon that day, and that some time {{afterward}} Mae Taub (daughter-in-law of Billy Sunday) asked him for a ride into town, {{so he went to}} his room (1219) to change his clothes and discovered Rappe in the bathroom vomiting in the toilet. Arbuckle then claimed Rappe told him she felt ill and asked to lie down, and that he carried her into the bedroom and asked a few of the party guests to help treat her. When Arbuckle {{and a few of the}} guests re-entered the room, they found Rappe on the floor near the bed tearing at her clothing and going into violent convulsions. To calm Rappe down, they placed her in a bathtub of cool water. Arbuckle and Fischbach then took her to room 1227 and called the hotel manager and doctor. After the doctor declared that Rappe was just drunk, Arbuckle then drove Taub to town.|$|E
500|$|Heydrich became {{notorious for}} his countless affairs. In December 1930 he {{attended}} a rowing-club ball and met Lina von Osten. They became romantically involved and soon announced their engagement. Lina was already a Nazi Party follower; she had attended her first rally in 1929. In 1931 Heydrich was charged with [...] "conduct unbecoming to an officer and gentleman" [...] for breaking an engagement promise to a woman he <b>had</b> <b>known</b> <b>for</b> {{six months before the}} von Osten engagement. Admiral Erich Raeder dismissed Heydrich from the navy that April. The dismissal devastated Heydrich, who found himself without career prospects.

500|$|The formal {{casting process}} began in February 1995, {{though some of}} the actors met with Thompson the {{previous}} year to help her conceptualise the script.

Amanda Root had also worked with Thompson on the screenplay, but had already committed to star in the 1995 film Persuasion. Commenting on the casting of Laurie, whom she <b>had</b> <b>known</b> <b>for</b> years, Thompson has said, [...] "There is no one [...] on the planet who could capture Mr. Palmer's disenchantment and redemption so perfectly, and make it funny." ...|$|E

The former, although lacking any footage of Sorabji, was significant in that it brought about his first meeting with Ronald Stevenson, whose music and writings he <b>had</b> <b>known</b> <b>for</b> more than 20 years. After they met, Sorabji wrote Villa Tasca, a composition for Stevenson. While working on it, Sorabji received his only commission; it came from Gentieu, acting on behalf of the Philadelphia branch of the Delius Society. Sorabji fulfilled it with Il tessuto d'arabeschi (1979). He dedicated it [...] "To the memory of Delius" [...] and received £1,000 for it (equivalent to £ in present-day terms).|$|E
