40|$|We {{describe}} {{a method of}} text summarization that produces indicative-informative abstracts for technical papers. The abstracts are generated by a process of conceptual identification, topic extraction and re-generation. We have carried out an evaluation to assess indicativeness and text acceptability relying on human judgment. The results so far indicate good performance in both tasks when compared with other summarization technologies. 1 Introduction We have specified a method of text summarization which produces indicative-informative abstracts for technical documents. The method was designed to identify the "topics" of a document and present them in an <b>indicative</b> <b>abstract.</b> Eventually, they can be elaborated in specific ways. In Figure 1, we present an <b>indicative</b> <b>abstract</b> for the document "Facilitating designercustomer communication in the World Wide Web" (Internet Research: Electronic Networking Applications and Policy, Vol 8, Issue 5, 1998) produced with our implementation of this [...] ...|$|E
40|$|<b>Indicative</b> <b>abstract</b> Not {{only can}} the reader get {{information}} of whom the beginning teacher is {{but he can}} also find plausible reasons leading individuals to choose pedagogical profession in theoretical part of the bachelor's thesis. It is also possible to read about specifics of pedagogical profession such as ageing of pedagogical staff, feminization, vocational deformation and more. One chapter is devoted both to uncertainties of beginning teachers and to their activities. Students of pedagogical branches {{might be interested in}} chapters concerning pedagogical preparation of teachers to-be, supremacy and nonstandard situations. Final chapter is dedicated to teachers' quality in the Czech and international context. Results of the investigation inquiry among beginning teachers at primary schools are presented in the practical part. The inquiry offers insight into the pedagogical profession through young eyes. It is possible to conclude from results which activities are the most troublesome for beginning teachers at primary schools and which they have no troubles with...|$|E

Highly beneficial to information professionals and researchers who work and publish in different fields, this book summarizes {{the most important and}} up-to-date theory of abstracting, as well as giving advice and examples for the practice of writing different kinds of abstracts. The book discusses the length, the functions and basic structure of abstracts, outlining a new approach to informative and <b>indicative</b> <b>abstracts.</b> The abstractors' personality, their linguistic and non-linguistic knowledge and skills are also disc...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to {{describe}} how to write a good abstract. There are two different kinds of <b>abstracts</b> : <b>indicative</b> <b>abstracts</b> and informative abstracts. The later is more frequently encountered and has a standardized structure: “Introduction, Methods, Results and Discussion”. In addition, there are two distinct types of informative summaries : the structured summary and the summary intended for a scientific congress. Drafting the summary is an important part of writing a scientific paper and can have a great influence on the audience reached by the article...|$|R
40|$|We {{present an}} {{automated}} method of generating human-readable summaries {{from a variety}} of text documents including newspaper articles, business reports, government documents, even broadcast news transcripts. Our approach exploits an em-pirical observation that much of the written text display certain regularities of organization and style, which we call the Discourse Macro Structure (DMS). A summary is therefore created to reflect the components of a given DMS. In order to pro-duce a coherent and readable summary we select continuous, well-formed passages from the source document and assemble them into a mini-document within a DMS template. In this paper we describe an automated summarizer that can generate both short <b>indicative</b> <b>abstracts,</b> useful for quick scanning of a list of documents, as well as longer informative digests that can serve as surrogates for the full text. The summarizer can assist the users of an informa-tion retrieval system in assessing the quality of the results returned from a search, preparing reports and memos for their customers, and even building more effective search queries...|$|R
40|$|Is a {{secondary}} source of scientific information {{which can help}} scientists to get the gist of relevant information needed for their study. Scientific article usually provides informative abstracts to facilitate readers to know the essential content of the article. The quality of an abstract depends on the accuracy and completeness of abstract components or elements. This research was intended {{to find out the}} completeness of abstract elements, finite verb tenses, and the voice of coconut research abstracts. A total of 34 abstracts from the last three-year issues of CORD journal were analyzed. The result of the analysis showed that there were two categories i. e. <b>indicative</b> <b>abstracts</b> (21 %) and comprehensives abstracts (79 %). The most complete informative abstracts consisting of 5 elements accounted for 23 %, the informative abstracts with four elements had the highest amount which was 41 %, and the informative/comprehensive abstracts with three elements had the least amount which is 15 %. It can be concluded that most informative/ comprehensive abstracts contain four elements which are background (introduction), objectives, methodology, and result. Four tenses are usually used in abstract writing; they are simple present, simple past, present and past perfect tense. Both active and passive voices are used in writing abstracts...|$|R
40|$|In {{this part}} of the study it {{concerns}} pumping stations which extract groundwater from so-called phreatic aquifers. These stations are characterized as the most vulnerable extractions. For a pumping site the recharge area and the development of the concentration were calculated. There has been a sensitivity which was adapted to the values of measurements. The half life is the most important factor affecting a spread in groundwater quality. A ban of the use of pesticides will not lead in all considered scenarios to a reduction of the concentration at a short time. Several limitations and uncertainties are attached. The effect of the neglects and simplifications implies an <b>indicative</b> result. <b>Abstract</b> not availabl...|$|R
40|$|The occurrence, form, {{and content}} of the {{elements}} of research papers used in bibliographical control is examined in the whole range of disciplines [...] -natural sciences, social sciences and humanities. Instructions given by primary journals to authors about these elements are considered in the light of requirements for bibliographic control. 1. The information content of titles is assessed firstly by counting the number of keywords in them, and variations with discipline, time and language are reported. A more refined measure depending on the probabilities of occurrence of title words is then used for samples taken from journals in chemistry, history and philosophy. 2. Suggestions are made for improving the presentation of author details to facilitate bibliographic control. 3. The information in abstracts of experimental papers is analysed into the four divisions traditionally used for the text: introduction, experimental/method, results, and discussion, and the proportion of each type is compared with that in the text. A wider range of abstracts are also analysed into informative and indicative content. Literature on the uses of abstracts is reviewed in a consideration of their purpose, and arguments are presented for <b>indicative</b> <b>abstracts.</b> 4. A comparison of authors' keywords with terms assigned by indexing services shows that such keywords are not usually adequate or accurate enough for indexing purposes. Instructions to authors to use a controlled vocabulary, e. g. Medical Subject Headings, {{did not seem to be}} observed very closely. 5. The average number of references per paper is reported for various subjects, broken down for experimental papers into the sections used in studying abstracts. The value of including the titles of cited papers in references is stressed. As the use of on-line services takes over from use of printed indexes, reliance is likely to be placed entirely on authors (and editors) for index terms. Titles and abstracts seem to be a more reliable source than separate lists of keywords...|$|R
40|$|Children's (Grades 1 to 5) {{implicit}} learning of French orthographic regularities were investigated through nonword judgment (Experiments 1 and 2) and completion (Experiments 3 a and 3 b) tasks.

The later effect transferred to never doubled consonants, although with a decrement in performance. Moreover, this decrement persisted without any trend towards fading even after the massive amounts of experience provided by years of practice. This result runs against the idea that transfer to novel material is <b>indicative</b> of <b>abstract</b> rule-based knowledge, and suggests instead the action of mechanisms sensitive to the statistical properties of the material.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the apparent mismatch between the normative and descriptive literatures in the cognitive science of conditional reasoning. Descriptive psychological theories still regard material implication as the normative {{theory of the}} conditional. However, over the last 20 years {{in the philosophy of}} language and logic the idea that material implication call account for everyday indicative conditionals has been subject to severe criticism. The majority view is now apparently in favour of a subjective conditional probability interpretation. A comparative model fitting exercise is presented that shows that a conditional probability model call explain as much of the data oil <b>abstract</b> <b>indicative</b> conditional reasoning tasks as psychological theories that supplement material implication with various rationally unjustified processing assumptions. Consequently, when people are asked to solve laboratory reasoning tasks, they call be seen as simply generalising their everyday probabilistic reasoning strategies to this novel context...|$|R
30|$|In reality, it is {{our opinion}} that, from the very same {{practices}} and from the rare instances of critical thinking, new tendencies emerge, which are probably irreversible, towards new modes of convergence of {{the traditions of the}} two disciplines. There is little doubt, in fact, that we must test the potential effects of urban-planning regulation in space and on site, in other words, to perfect form-based normative codes instead of the traditional zoning systems. More in general, we certainly need an adequate “design code”, whether it be Quaroni’s idea plan, or the more current master plan, to place the territorial transformations in the physical and spatial context. The issue of the urban project is undoubtedly fundamental to the conception and realisation of important urban transformations, however, it should respect a double-barrelled requirement, which is often neglected. On one hand, the emerging projects must be well-rooted within a spatial development framework in order to find coherence and validation (Oosterlynck et al. 2011). Furthermore, it seems indispensable that the programming visions must not be merely <b>indicative,</b> i.e. too <b>abstract</b> or vague. It is not enough to resort to the methodologies of management by objective, which some would like to borrow from the world of corporate planning (where they have also been criticised: see Mintzberg 1994 and Bryson and Einsweiler 1988). Strategic spatial visions should also be more deeply-rooted in these effective places. Perhaps {{this is the only way}} to justify their future relaunch, after the clear crisis in recent years, both in institution contexts and in practice. Finally, it is a pleasure to note that some interesting strands of thought have already emerged which wed a policy tools approach with real processes of urban development (Tiesdell and Adams 2011). This is a direction to be developed, as it is potentially coherent with the place-oriented vision described herein.|$|R
