5|$|Kohlberg's stages are not {{culturally}} neutral, {{as demonstrated}} by its application {{to a number of}} different cultures. Although they progress through the stages <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>order,</b> individuals in different cultures seem to do so at different rates. Kohlberg has responded by saying that although different cultures do indeed inculcate different beliefs, his stages correspond to underlying modes of reasoning, rather than to those beliefs.|$|E

As the junior high school teenagers and the elementary children were still developing their logical reasoning, they would need more time in comprehending counterfactual stimuli.

50|$|Simple Machines 7"s 1990-1993 {{also known}} as The Machines is a {{compilation}} album created by Simple Machines records. The compilation consisted of six of the earliest EPs; Wedge (SMR 01; 1990), Wheel (SMR 02; 1990), Pulley (SMR 03; 1991), Screw (SMR 04; 1991), Lever (SMR 05; 1992), and Inclined Plane (SMR 06; 1993). None of the songs are necessarily listed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>orders</b> as they are on their respected EPs.|$|R
5|$|The Estonian embryologist Karl Ernst von Baer stated {{what are}} now called von Baer's laws in 1828, noting that related animals begin their {{development}} as similar embryos and then diverge: thus, {{animals in the}} same family are more closely related and diverge later than animals which are only <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>order</b> and have fewer homologies. von Baer's theory recognises that each taxon (such as a family) has distinctive shared features, and that embryonic development parallels the taxonomic hierarchy: not the same as recapitulation theory.|$|E
5|$|Just like {{individual}} competitions, {{there are}} two rounds, but with a difference. Each round is divided into four rotations or 'legs', in which a member of every team jumps once <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>order.</b> Points are scored {{the same as they}} are in individual competitions; however, an athlete's points for a jump are instead added to their team's total tally. The starting order of teams in the first round, and first three legs of the second round, is based on their standings in the Nations Cup. Teams are narrowed down to eight for the second round based on points scored, with the same four athletes jumping in their order of rotation as before.|$|E
5|$|Long {{thought to}} be related to frigatebirds, cormorants, tropicbirds, gannets and boobies, {{pelicans}} instead are now known to be most closely related to the shoebill and hamerkop, and are placed in the order Pelecaniformes. Ibises, spoonbills, herons and the desolate bitterns have been classified <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>order.</b> Fossil evidence of pelicans dates back to at least 30 million years to the remains of a beak very similar to that of modern species recovered from Oligocene strata in France. They are thought to have evolved in the Old World and spread into the Americas; this is reflected in the relationships within the genus as the eight species divide into Old World and New World lineages.|$|E

5|$|The plural form of {{the common}} name {{narcissus}} has caused some confusion. British English sources such as the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary give two alternate forms, narcissi and narcissuses. In contrast, in American English the Merriam-Webster Dictionary provides for a third form, narcissus, used for both singular and plural. The Oxford dictionaries only list this third form under American English, although the Cambridge Dictionary allows of all three <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>order.</b> However, Garner's Modern American Usage states that narcissi is the commonest form, narcissus being excessively sibilant. For similar reasons, Fowler prefers narcissi in British English usage. Neither support narcissus as a plural form. Common names such as narcissus do not capitalise the first letter {{in contrast to the}} person of that name and the Latin genus name.|$|E
5|$|The San Diego Chargers got 16 first downs, {{compared}} to 5 for the Buccaneers. Chargers {{players and coaches}} praised the Buccaneers’ defense, who held them to 9 points until the final three minutes of the game, saying that they played the equivalent of five quarters. Three Tampa Bay quarterbacks completed a combined 3 of 8 passes for −4 yards. Buccaneers receiver Bob Moore said, “We’re at rock bottom now...but if we start pointing a finger, we’ll go 0–14”. The Chargers finished with 325 yards of offense to the Buccaneers’ 125. Inconsistent blocking was blamed for the offensive problems, a situation that was not helped by the injury to tackle Dave Reavis. Mercury Morris, who had been picked up on waivers by the Chargers from the Miami Dolphins after the Buccaneers’ preseason game against the Dolphins, commented that the difference in Buccaneers’ offensive line protection between the two games was like watching two different teams. The Buccaneers’ lack of speed was also noticeable. The loss {{marked the first time}} since 1961 that a professional football team was shut out {{in the first two games}} of the season, when the Oakland Raiders were shut out by the same two teams <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>order.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{greater number}} of naturalists who have taken into {{consideration}} the whole structure of man, including his mental faculties, have followed Blumenbach and Cuvier, and have placed man in a separate Order, under {{the title of the}} Bimana, and therefore on an equality with the orders of the Quadrumana, Carnivora, etc. Recently many of our best naturalists have recurred to the view first propounded by Linnaeus, so remarkable for his sagacity, and have placed man <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>Order</b> with the Quadrumana, under the title of the Primates. The justice of this conclusion will be admitted: for in the first place, we must bear in mind the comparative insignificance for classification of the great development of the brain in man, and that the strongly marked differences between the skulls of man and the Quadrumana (lately insisted upon by Bischoff, Aeby, and others) apparently follow from their differently developed brains. In the second place, we must remember that nearly all the other and more important differences between man and the Quadrumana are manifestly adaptive in their nature, and relate chiefly to the erect position of man; such as the structure of his hand, foot, and pelvis, the curvature of his spine, and the position of his head. I absolutely know of none. If only someone might tell me a single one! If I would have called man a simian or vice versa, I would have brought together all the theologians against me. Perhaps I ought to have by virtue of the law of the discipline.|$|E

5|$|The opening {{movie to}} Ever 17 {{was created by}} the game's producer, who picked out CGs and {{keywords}} from the game to include. Nakazawa gave instructions to have the characters appear <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>order</b> as the recommended route playing order the developers had decided on, hoping for the order to leave an impression and influence players to play the game in that order. The ending movie was created by Nakazawa, who was not used to the tools used in video creation. He added a timeline to the credits roll, intending for it to feel emotional to get an overview of the story after having finished it, and finding it fitting to have a timeline scrolling along with the calm ending theme. For the PlayStation Portable version, {{the creation of a new}} opening movie was outsourced to a video design company, chosen specifically for one designer working there. Nakazawa sent them instructions on what text and graphics to use, and they created an animatic based on it, before adding the details. The ending movie for this version {{was created by the}} publisher, Cyberfront, without Nakazawa's involvement.|$|E
5|$|Another virtual safety car period ensued on lap 34, {{caused by}} Verstappen who crashed his {{car into the}} barrier after locking up his tyres. As the VSC ended on lap 37, Ricciardo once more failed {{in an attempt to}} regain the lead. At the chicane coming out of the tunnel, Hamilton misjudged the corner and backed Ricciardo off at the exit of the chicane, causing the latter to {{complain}} about the move on team radio. While the incident was investigated by the stewards, the decision was not to take action against Hamilton. At that point, the order stood as follows: Hamilton, Ricciardo, Pérez, Vettel, Alonso, Rosberg, Hülkenberg, Sainz, Button and Gutiérrez. The top four drivers pulled away cleanly {{from the rest of the}} field behind them. On lap 50, the two Sauber cars collided at Rascasse corner, after Felipe Nasr had ignored instructions from the pit lane to let his teammate Ericsson behind him pass. Another VSC period was called while both Sauber drivers made pit stops to repair damages, only for both to retire some laps later. In front, the race carried on <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>order.</b> On lap 68, the fourth virtual safety car period occurred when a large plastic sheet fell onto the start–finish straight. Hamilton was able to extend his lead over Ricciardo at that point, setting the fastest lap of the race on lap 71. Three laps from the finish, rain started to fall again, although no driver changed tyres before the chequered flag fell. Hamilton crossed the finish line to take victory ahead of Ricciardo and Pérez. This win for Hamilton marked his second at Monaco, the other being in 2008. These two races featured many similarities, such as the Hamilton starting third on the grid, the race starting in wet conditions and finishing in the dry, as well as Hamilton taking the lead on lap 33. Vettel hung on to fourth, followed by Alonso in fifth. Rosberg however lost his sixth place to Nico Hülkenberg on the very last lap.|$|E
