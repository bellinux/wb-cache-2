The menu for the 2009 inaugural luncheon, which often features dishes representative of the home states of the new President and Vice President, included seafood stew, duck and pheasant entrees with Pinot noir wine, and a dessert of apple cinnamon sponge cake with sweet cream glac√©. Since 1985, a painting has served as a backdrop for the <b>head</b> <b>table.</b> For the 2009 inaugural luncheon, the featured painting was Thomas Hill's 1865 View of the Yosemite Valley, a painting that commemorated Abraham Lincoln's 1864 signing of the Yosemite Grant, which was the first time the federal government protected park lands for public use.|$|E

40|$|On the Great Northern Peninsula, western Newfoundland, the transqressive <b>Table</b> <b>Head</b> Formation (Middle Ordovician) overlies the Lower Ordovician St. George Group. The <b>Table</b> <b>Head</b> strata are overlain by {{carbonate}} breccias and easterly derived flysch deposits. The <b>Table</b> <b>Head</b> sediments include limestones, mainly rubbly, with dolostones at {{the base}} (lower <b>Table</b> <b>Head),</b> overlain by limestones interbedded with shales (middle <b>Table</b> <b>Head)</b> and black graptolitiferous shales at the top (upper <b>Table</b> <b>Head).</b> The lower <b>Table</b> <b>Head</b> limestones represent the last platform carbonate deposit before the bank foundered {{probably due to the}} emplacement of Lower Ordovician allochthons in western Newfoundland. [...] The formation has been studied in detail from eight localities in the area from Bellburns community in the south to St. John Island in the north. Additional information from localities on Port au Port Peninsula and Hare Bay is included. The <b>Table</b> <b>Head</b> sediments all along on the west coast of Newfoundland compare with those in the study area. The thickness of the different units varies considerably and reaches its maximum at Table Point. The detailed investigation of the rocks revealed that carbonate accumulation was interrupted by "catastrophic" downwarps of the shelf. These {{may be related to the}} emplacement of the allochthons. [...] A total of approximately 17, 000 conodonts was recorded within the study area. An additional 3, 000 were recorded from elsewhere in western Newfoundland. The conodont fauna is described in multi-element taxonomy, and a supragenetic classification is applied. 35 genera and Panderodontidae, and the new recognized family Cornuodontidae n. fam [...] [...] Two phylo-zones and four biointerval-zones are defined. The phylo-zones are based on phylogenetically related and facies independent species of Histiodella. The species from the basal lower <b>Table</b> <b>Head</b> on Newfoundland belong to Midcontinent Fauna 4, and are correlative with strata from North America. The conodonts reinforce trilobite and cephalopod data that indicate a late Whiterockian (early Llanvirnian age for these strata. The North Atlantic Province conodonts from the middle <b>Table</b> <b>Head</b> have a number of species in common with the Eoplacognathus suecicus Zone of Scandinavia. The top of the middle <b>Table</b> <b>Head</b> at <b>Table</b> Point may be as young as the E. suecicus-P. sulcatus Subzone. [...] The <b>Table</b> <b>Head</b> strata accumulated in lagoonal, shelf (inner-outer) and slope environments. The lateral distribution of conodonts can be directly related to these depositional environments, and a sequence of three biofacies and sub-biofacies is introduced. The lagoonal (Midcontinent Province) and slope (North Atlantic Province) biofacies are distinct, whereas the shelf biofacies is less distinct. The occurrence of occasional invaders from the open oceanic biofacies can be related to the oscillating transgression...|$|R

Again the negotiators met in the fortress in Brest Litovsk, while the delegates were housed in temporary wooden structure in its courtyards, because the city had been burnt to the ground in 1915 by the retreating Russian army.
