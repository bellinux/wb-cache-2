5|$|Of {{the nine}} species of Orthoptera identified, two are {{considered}} heritage: the sickle-bearing bush cricket (Phaneroptera falcata), {{rare in the}} region, enjoys the dry and high herbaceous areas and the long-horned <b>groundhopper</b> (Tetrix tenuicornis) is a pioneer species of poor vegetation settings.|$|E
5|$|Wood small-reed (Calamagrostis epigejos) {{is present}} {{in the center of the}} site and threatens to spread into {{herbaceous}} areas. It compromises sustainability of stations, including man orchid and bee orchid populations. Two distinct zones can be distinguished. The first, where the wood small-reed has a very high rate of recovery, is not hosting any heritage value. It is mowed early and disposed of. Grazing is not possible at the moment. The second, on the contrary, not densely colonized by this plant is much more of a fragile situation due to the presence of orchids and the sickle-bearing bush cricket or long-horned <b>groundhopper.</b> Differentiated management is applied depending on the issues. At orchid stations, slight thinning is done early by hand pruning. The less dense areas where the grass is sparse (conducive to the long-horned <b>groundhopper</b> (Tetrix tenuicornis)) are pulled. In the newly opened areas, a systematic and annual pulling avoids expansion. Finally, dense areas, well exposed, are left in that state.|$|E

5000|$|Tetrigidae is {{a family}} in the order Orthoptera, which also {{includes}} similar families such as crickets, grasshoppers, and their allies. Species within the Tetrigidae are variously called <b>groundhoppers,</b> pygmy grasshoppers or (mostly historical) [...] "grouse locusts".|$|R
50|$|Groundhopping is a hobby that {{involves}} attending matches at {{as many different}} stadiums or grounds as possible. Participants are known as <b>groundhoppers,</b> hoppers or travellers. Largely a football-related pastime, groundhopping probably found its origin in football in the 1970s in England. From the late 1980s fans in Germany started groundhopping as well. Currently it is especially popular in the United Kingdom, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium and Norway.|$|R
25|$|A common {{example of}} {{polyandrous}} mating {{can be found}} in the field cricket (Gryllus bimaculatus) of the invertebrate order Orthoptera (containing crickets, grasshoppers, and <b>groundhoppers).</b> Polyandrous behavior is also prominent in many other insect species, including the red flour beetle and the species of spider Stegodyphus lineatus. Polyandry also occurs in some primates such as marmosets, mammal groups, the marsupial genus' Antechinus and bandicoots, around 1% of all bird species, such as jacanas and dunnocks, insects such as honeybees, and fish such as pipefish.|$|R
5000|$|Tetrix ceperoi, {{commonly}} named Cepero's <b>groundhopper,</b> is {{a member}} of the Tetrigidae family and is very similar to common grasshoppers. Grasshopper is defined as a [...] "plant eating insect with long hind legs that are used for jumping and for producing a chirping sound". However, unlike the common grasshopper, the wings of T. ceperoi extend beyond its pronotum (the upper surface of the first segment of the thorax). The front wings have evolved throughout history to be stumps, and the back wings are very well developed. Thanks to the front wings only, T. ceperoi is capable of flying. Furthermore, T. ceperoi sports wide shoulders while covering its narrow abdomen beneath the pronotum. T. ceperoi are classified as Orthoptera, which describes crickets, grasshoppers, and locusts. Furthermore, these Orthoptera have incomplete metamorphosis, which also affects sexual dimorphism later. T. ceperoi reach an average length of about 10 mm. T. ceperoi is a multi-coloured ground dweller with the ability to blend into its surroundings. The ability of T. ceperoi to be different colours makes it able to evolve colour schemes better adapted to specific habitats. This cryptic nature of their outer layer provides protection from predators as it is able to blend into its surroundings. T. ceperoi is diurnal, which means it is solely active in the daytime. However, although it is diurnal, it continues to hibernate during a late nymphal instar or later on in life as adults.|$|E
40|$|Orthoptera (grasshoppers, <b>groundhoppers,</b> crickets, bushcrickets), earwigs (Dermaptera) and {{cockroaches}} (Blattaria) {{collected in}} the Netherlands in the years between 1800 and 2002. Occurrence information is provided on a 10 x 10 km scale. The original source is the database of the Dutch branch of European Invertebrate Survey (EIS-NL). At the time this dataset was generated for publication in GBIF (2004) the specimen were deposited in several separate collections. In the years thereafter most of these collections have been merged into the main natural history collection of Naturalis Biodiversity Center. In due time this dataset shall be checked for possible duplication of information...|$|R
50|$|In {{behavioral}} ecology, polyandry is a {{class of}} mating system where one female mates with several males in a breeding season. Polyandry is often compared to the polygyny system based on the cost and benefits incurred by members of each sex. Polygyny is where one male mates with several females in a breeding season (e.g., lions, deer, some primates, and many systems where there is an alpha male).A common example of polyandrous mating {{can be found in}} the field cricket (Gryllus bimaculatus) of the invertebrate order Orthoptera (containing crickets, grasshoppers, and <b>groundhoppers).</b> Polyandrous behavior is also prominent in many other insect species, including the red flour beetle and the species of spider Stegodyphus lineatus.
