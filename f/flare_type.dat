The two stars orbit their common barycenter {{in a period of}} 659 years, with a mean separation of about 84 AU—84 times the separation between the Earth and the Sun. The relatively large orbital eccentricity of 0.48 means that the two stars are separated by about 44 AU at periapsis and 124 AU at apoapsis. The leisurely orbit of the pair has made it difficult to pin down their respective masses, and the accuracy of these values remain somewhat controversial. In the future this issue may be resolved through the use of asteroseismology. 61 Cygni A has about 11% more mass than 61 Cygni B.|$|E

40|$|We {{report on}} an {{approximately}} twelve hour long X-ray flare from the low-mass X-ray binary KS 1731 - 260. The flare has a rise time {{of less than}} 13 min and declines exponentially with a decay time of 2. 7 hours. The flare emission is well described by black-body radiation with peak temperature of 2. 4 keV. The total energy release from the event is 10 ^{ 42 } erg (for an assumed distance of 7 kpc). The flare has all the characteristics of thermo-nuclear X-ray bursts (so-called type I X-ray bursts), except for its very long duration and therefore large energy release (factor of 1500 - 4000 longer and 250 - 425 more energy than normal type I X-ray bursts from this source). The flare is preceded by a short and weak X-ray burst, possibly of type I. Days to weeks before the <b>flare,</b> <b>type</b> I X-ray bursts were seen {{at a rate of}} ~ 3 per day. However, after the <b>flare</b> <b>type</b> I X-ray bursting ceased for at least a month, suggesting that the superburst affected the type I bursting behaviour. The persistent emission is not significantly different during the non-bursting period. We compare the characteristics of this event with similar long X-ray flares, so-called superbursts, seen in other sources (4 U 1735 - 44, 4 U 1820 - 30, 4 U 1636 - 53, Ser X- 1, GX 3 + 1).

40|$|We {{study the}} {{properties}} of powerful X-ray flares from 161 pre-main sequence (PMS) stars observed with the Chandra X-ray Observatory in the Orion Nebula region. Relationships between flare properties, protoplanetary disks and accretion are examined in detail to test models of star-disk interactions at the inner edge of the accretion disks. Previous studies had found no differences in flaring between diskfree and accreting systems other than a small overall diminution of X-ray luminosity in accreting systems. The most important finding is that X-ray coronal extents in fast-rotating diskfree stars can significantly exceed the Keplerian corotation radius, whereas X-ray loop sizes in disky and accreting systems do not exceed the corotation radius. This is consistent with models of star-disk magnetic interaction where the inner disk truncates and confines the PMS stellar magnetosphere. We also find two differences between flares in accreting and diskfree PMS stars. First, a subclass of super-hot flares with peak plasma temperatures exceeding 100 MK are preferentially present in accreting systems. Second, we tentatively find that accreting stars produce flares with shorter durations. Both results may be consequences of the distortion and destabilization of the stellar magnetosphere by the interacting disk. Finally, we find no evidence that any <b>flare</b> <b>types,</b> even slow-rise flat-top flares are produced in star-disk magnetic loops.

We discuss the changing light curve, the shift in phase of the maxima and point to <b>flare</b> <b>type</b> variability seen in one night. Small amplitude variations are reported in another night. We have investigated the change of the average visual magnitude over a time span of 18 years and found a tentative cyclic variation with a time scale of 2425 d (6. 6 yr) with a range of 0 :m 07. This, of course, should be veried. If true, a precession phenomenon may oer an explanation. The trend of the maximum light amplitude of the 3 :d 766 cycle is also investigated and it shows a saw-tooth character with a timescale of 400 d. A possible relation with the magnetic activity of the star is discussed. We conclude that the line emission variability can be caused by both a single star model with an ever-changing wind and a binary (WN+NS) model. ?...|$|E

It is characterized by recurrent itchy wheal and <b>flare</b> <b>type</b> skin reactions and angioedema. The overall aim was to investigate interleukin- 31 (IL- 31) as therapeutic biomarker during the treatment of CSU patients with Omalizumab. To achieve this goal, three independent studies were performed. In the first study, CSU patients were treated with Omalizumab, a therapeutic anti-IgE antibody, and the clinical improvement was monitored. This study raised the question for an objective therapeutic biomarker. In the second study, IL- 31, a potential biomarker for CSU, was investigated for its biologic activity and relevance regarding itch induction and sustainment. In the last retrospective study, the potential suitability of IL- 31 as a therapeutic biomarker in CSU was investigated. Here, IL- 31 was retrospectively analyzed from serum samples of CSU patients of the first study and correlated with their clinical data. In brief, the first study showed that Omalizumab, but not placebo, significantly (p= 0. 0089) reduced the urticaria symptom score UAS 7 (- 17. 8). Two thirds of the CSU patients were even completely free of symptoms. The second study demonstrated {{for the first time that}} IL- 31 induces a delayed itch after 143 minutes in humans. The last study exhibited that the improvement of the clinical scores in the first study was linked to a significant reduction (- 48 %; p= 0. 004) of IL- 31 levels in the serum. Non-responder or placebo treated patients had no changes of their IL- 31 levels. In summary, IL- 31 may be an appropriate therapeutic biomarker for the monitoring of the therapeutic response of CSU patients to Omalizumab. Furthermore, IL- 31 could play an important role in the pathophysiology of CSU and appears to be an interesting target for new therapeutic treatment options...|$|E
40|$|The SDO EUV {{observations}} {{have revealed}} interesting characteristics of warm coronal emissions, which peak {{soon after the}} hot coronal X-ray emissions peak during a flare and then sometimes peak {{for a second time}} hours after the X-ray flare peak. This <b>flare</b> <b>type,</b> with two warm coronal emission peaks but only one X-ray peak, has been named the EUV late phase. These flares have the distinct properties of i) having a complex magnetic field structure with two initial sets of coronal loops, with one upper set overlaying a lower set, ii) having an eruptive flare initiated in the lower set and disturbing both loop sets, iii) having the hot coronal emissions emitted only from the lower set, and iv) having the first peak of the warm coronal emissions associated with the lower set and its second peak emitted from the upper set much later. The disturbance of the coronal loops by the eruption is at about the same time, but the relaxation and cooling down of the heated coronal loops during the post-flare reconnections have different time scales with the longer, upper loops being significantly delayed from the lower loops. The difference in these cooling time scales is related to {{the difference between the two}} peak times of the warm coronal emission and is also apparent in the decay profile of the X-ray emissions having two distinct decays, with the first decay slope being steeper and the delayed decay slope being smaller during the time of the warm coronal emission second peak. The frequency and relationship of the EUV late-phase decay times between the Fe XVI two flare peaks and X-ray decay slopes are examined using three years of SDO/EVE data, and the X-ray dual-decay character is then exploited to estimate the frequency of EUV late-phase flares during the past four solar cycles.

It is suggested that mild activity by IRc 9, such as a T Tauri type wind or FU Orionis <b>type</b> <b>flare,</b> {{would be consistent with}} its apparent nature and could have caused the necessary density structure in the cloud...|$|R
5000|$|Because of its {{relative}} proximity, some—in particular, Edward Sion, astronomer & astrophysicist at Villanova University, {{and his team}} therefrom—contend that a type 1a supernova could {{have a significant impact}} on Earth. The received gamma radiation would equal the total (all spectra) radiation of approximately 1,000 solar <b>flares,</b> but the <b>type</b> Ia supernova would have to be closer than [...] to cause significant damage to the ozone layer, and perhaps closer than 500 parsecs. The X-radiation that reaches Earth in such an event, however, would be less than the X-radiation of a single average solar flare.|$|R
