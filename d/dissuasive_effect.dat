40|$|Counterfeiting {{has been}} a menacing problem to global economies; however, {{it has been more}} devastating to {{developing}} and under-developed countries {{as a result of its}} impacts on various aspects of the economic development and health conditions of those countries. The consequences are abundantly documented, evidential and troubling. In addition to the fact that counterfeiting results in distribution of fake, cheap, and substandard products, it has very <b>dissuasive</b> <b>effects</b> on the entrepreneurial fabrics of a society. As various governments and agencies attempt to combat the menace and mitigate the consequences, the perpetuators are becoming even more sophisticated and resolute – encouraged and motivated by the current technological terrains. Most current methods and techniques utilized in combating product counterfeiting usually tend to concentrate on the “detect, catch and prosecute” approach by those governments and agencies. Besides the resource extensiveness of this approach, which is mostly unattainable, the “detect or catch” part may happen, but the “prosecute” part has always been greatly marred by the corruptive environments that are usually endemic in those societies. When technology-based approaches are used in the war against counterfeiting to empower the consumers, either it’s non-ubiquitous, easily compromised by counterfeiters, difficult to use or not cost-effective to the consumers. As a result, what is needed is a technology and consumer-centric, ubiquitous, secure, easy-to-use, and cost-effective system to greatly alleviate this nuisance...|$|R
40|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the nineteen’s, problems on the application of law concerning copyrights have raised due to the development of computers and Internet and the proliferation of illegal exchange of files. Anti-pirate devices were applied, but without any truly <b>dissuasive</b> <b>effects.</b> New devices will probably applied in an approached future, but their effectiveness is not proved and they imply significant restrictions of rights of utilization and would be socially contestable. The nature of technologies make status quo impossible and force a reconfiguration of authors and users rights. We will have to do a social choice: restrict the access to works or implant the taxation of devices that give access to works. The last one appear more appropriate for today’s technologies. It is largely recognized that copyright must guarantee an adequate remuneration for authors in support of artistic and intellectual live in our society. But at this time, we’re entering into a trouble phase of our history. Computers and Internet, both, allow to pirate any musical, cinematographic, literary and software works. This paper tries to demonstrate that legislative and technical efforts intending to protect author’s work against this phenomenon are at best socially contestable, at worst technically impossible.

40|$|In Australia, young drivers aged 17 to 25 years {{comprise}} 13 % of {{the population}} yet account for 22 % of all road deaths with young males overrepresented in such trauma. Speeding represents a major contributing factor and advertising campaigns have long focused on promoting anti-speeding messages {{in the effort to}} reduce drivers’ speeds. Positioned within a larger program of research aimed at developing, piloting, and evaluating a range of theoretically-informed anti-speeding messages, the current study reports results relating to the final phase of the research, the evaluation. Six messages were devised in accordance with the guiding framework, the Step approach to Message Design and Testing ([SatMDT]; Lewis et al., 2016) and based on the findings emerging from earlier qualitative and quantitative studies within the program of research. N = 938 licensed drivers (n = 455 males, 48 %) aged 17 - 62 years completed an online survey. To ensure a controlled test of the persuasiveness of the message content, the messages were presented in an audio-based format and thus were devoid of potential confounds, such as images. The messages sought to address a particular belief (i. e., behavioural, normative, control) and to focus either on emphasising the positive aspects which make speeding less likely or challenging the negative aspects which make speeding more likely. Thus, key to this evaluation was to test the persuasiveness of the message content in terms of the particular belief and focus it was addressing. Participants were randomly assigned to either the Control condition (i. e., no exposure to a message) or the Intervention condition (i. e., exposed to one of the six messages presented as an audio-recorded message within the survey). Persuasiveness was assessed via a range of outcome measures including both direct (i. e., third-person perceptions, message rejection) as well as indirect measures (i. e., intentions, willingness to speed). Age, gender, and message type were independent variables (IVs), together with issue involvement as a covariate (or IV) in the study’s analyses. Overall, positive persuasive effects, and a relative absence of any negative, <b>dissuasive</b> <b>effects,</b> were found for two messages, Glass Cars and The Lift. These messages addressed the same salient belief, control beliefs, with the former emphasising the factors which discourage speeding and the latter message challenging those factors which encourage speeding. The implications of the findings are discussed in terms of the insights they offer for the key content of future anti-speeding messages...|$|R

40|$|This {{empirical}} paper {{investigates the}} determinants of the arbitration taking place after a corporate default. Two ways of resolving financial distress are conceivable: either the creditors privately renegotiate with the debtor, or a formal bankruptcy procedure is triggered off. This arbitration depends on the legal context and, more specifically, on the national bankruptcy code. No study {{has been done on}} the French Civil Law. Yet, this legal system has inspired other important legislations in continental Europe. We use original data coming from the recovery units of five French commercial banks. Our sample gathers 735 credit lines allocated to 386 distressed companies (233 of them are used in our econometric regressions). Our variables encompass the profile of the company, the origin of the default (with a specific focus on faulty management), the nature of the credit relationship, and the type of borrowings. We test four hypotheses. Hypothesis H 1 focuses on a tradeoff between the arguments based on coordination issues and the counterarguments based on the stakeholders’ bargaining power. Such tradeoff may depend on the legal environment. Hypothesis H 2 suggests that, to support renegotiation, a bank needs information on the project’s profitability (adverse selection), and on the managers’ reliability (moral hazard). To reach an agreement, the bank must believe both conditions prevail. Hypothesis H 3 predicts the likelihood of renegotiation increases with the bank’s financial involvement (size effect). Hypothesis H 4 focuses on the level of collateralization (when the bank has inclination for liquidation, collaterals may increase the occurrence of bankruptcy, provided the law facilitates such liquidation and protects the bank’s priority on junior claims). To test H 1 to H 4, we use sequential LOGIT modeling to split between the variables explaining the decision to engage (or not) renegotiation and the variables explaining the success (or the failure) of renegotiation. Regarding H 1, we find the “coordination argument” is of secondary importance compared to the “bargaining power counterargument”. Indeed, whatever the coordination issues, a major bank may not wish to renegotiate simply because the competition with the other minor creditors is expected to be weak under bankruptcy, and/or because the debtor cannot survive without the bank’s financial support. Consequently, even a court-administered procedure (as in France) may not have <b>dissuasive</b> <b>effects</b> provided the bank’s bargaining power is strong enough. Regarding H 2, we show the project profitability and the managers’ reliability are two essential conditions to escape bankruptcy, but it needs time to discover them. Consequently, the first step of the arbitration (i. e. renegotiation attempt vs. direct bankruptcy) does not depend on these conditions. Regarding H 3, our results suggest that, when the lending is bigger and/or when the debt contract is longer, the chance of undertaking renegotiation is higher, but this does not predict such renegotiation shall be successful. Last, regarding H 4, we do not find any evidence that the level of collateralization significantly influence the tradeoff between informal renegotiation and formal bankruptcy. Indeed, in France, liquidation is viewed as a secondary objective, and the social claims outrank the secured ones. Bankruptcy, Renegotiation, Banks, SME, Sequential LOGIT. ...|$|R

50|$|While many {{challenge}} {{the idea that}} house demolitions have a <b>dissuasive</b> <b>effect,</b> one study by a Northwestern and Hebrew University group concluded that prompt demolitions brought about a lowering of suicide attacks for a month.

An internal IDF report of 2005, analyzing the effectiveness of the policy during the Al-Aqsa Intifada in which 3,000 civilian homes were demolished, found that terror attacks increased after house demolitions, only stimulated hatred of Israel, the damage caused outweighed any benefits, and recommended the practice be dropped.|$|E
50|$|These {{provisions}} {{have the}} double <b>dissuasive</b> <b>effect</b> of nullifying any utility in using torture {{with the purpose}} of eliciting confession, as well as confirming that should a person extract statements by torture, this can be used against him or her in criminal proceedings. The reason for this because experience has shown that under torture, or even under a threat of torture, a person will say or do anything solely to avoid the pain. As a result, {{there is no way to}} know whether or not the resulting statement is actually correct. If any court relies on any evidence obtained from torture regardless of validity, it provides an incentive for state officials to force a confession, creating a marketplace for torture, both domestically and overseas.|$|E

Methods:Data come from the 2014 wave of a cross-sectional in-home survey with 11 - to 16 -year olds (N = 1205) from across the UK, with participants recruited {{from the general population}} using random location quota sampling. Participants were shown an image of a standard cigarette which displayed the warning “Smoking kills” and asked whether they thought this would (not) put people off starting to smoke, (not) make people want to give up smoking, and whether all cigarettes should (not) have health warnings on them. Results:Most (71 %) thought that an on-cigarette warning would put people off starting, although this decreased with age. Never smokers were more likely than current smokers to think that it would put people off starting. Approximately half (53 %) thought that an on-cigarette warning would make people want to give up smoking, with this higher for never smokers and experimenters/past smokers than for current smokers. Most (85 %) supported a warning on all cigarettes. There was support among each smoking group, although this was higher for never smokers and experimenters/past smokers than for current smokers, and higher for those indicating that most of their close friends do not smoke than for those indicating that most of their close friends do smoke. Conclusions:The perception among adolescents that an on-cigarette warning could deter smoking, and the high support for a warning on all cigarettes, warrants further research. Implications:Research on dissuasive cigarettes is at a nascent stage. This is the first study to explore how adolescents perceive a health warning (“Smoking kills”) on cigarettes.
