The noble metal materials applied to the WcBiM chip were Ag as the inner metal layer and Au as the outer metal layer. Moreover, ZnS-SiO 2 was used as a waveguide layer due to the high force of adhesion between the two metals. It is easy and robust to integrate this waveguide layer with electrical and optical systems [18]. The characteristics of the WcBiM chip in the <b>intensity</b> <b>measurement</b> were investigated by evaluating the FWHM and slope of the SPR reflectance curve.

40|$|In many applications, {{signals are}} {{measured}} {{according to a}} linear process, but the phases of these measure-ments are often unreliable or not available. To reconstruct the signal, one must perform {{a process known as}} phase retrieval. This paper focuses on completely determining signals with as few <b>intensity</b> <b>measurements</b> as possible, and on efficient phase retrieval algorithms from such measurements. For the case of complex M-dimensional signals, we construct a measurement ensemble of size 4 M − 4 which yields injective inten-sity measurements; this is conjectured to be the smallest such ensemble. For the case of real signals, we devise a theory of “almost” injective <b>intensity</b> <b>measurements,</b> and we characterize such ensembles. Later, we show that phase retrieval from M + 1 almost injective <b>intensity</b> <b>measurements</b> is NP-hard, indicating that computationally efficient phase retrieval must come at the price of measurement redundancy...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the efficiency of fluorescence <b>intensity</b> <b>measurement</b> of PAH metabolites in fish bile (by Fixed Wavelength Fluorescence, FF) to study and assess PAHs contamination in aquatic organism. Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) was exposed to benzene, fluorene, anthracene, chrysene, and benzo[a]pyrene at non-lethal concentrations. The results showed that the fluorescence intensity and EROD activity were significantly increased with increase in exposure times and PAH concentrations. Moreover, the results of both methods had significantly positive relation. The maximum values were reached in 16 day after exposure.

Both {{the problem of}} phase retrieval from two intensity measurements (in electron microscopy or wave front sens-ing) {{and the problem of}} phase retrieval from a single <b>intensity</b> <b>measurement</b> plus a non-negativity constraint (in astronomy) are considered, with emphasis on the latter. It is shown that both the error-reduction algo-rithm for the problem of a single <b>intensity</b> <b>measurement</b> and the Gerchberg-Saxton algorithm for the prob-lem of two intensity measurements converge. The error-reduction algorithm is also shown to be closely re-lated to the steepest-descent method. Other algorithms, including the input-output algorithm and the con-jugate-gradient method, are shown to converge in practice much faster than the error-reduction algorithm.

40|$|International audienceDirect {{inversion}} of coherent X-ray diffraction patterns {{is a powerful}} method to image strains in individual crystals with a high spatial resolution, less than 10 nm. The possibility to invert the diffraction pattern is in principle ensured by the oversampling of the measurement. In addition, {{the resolution of the}} reconstructed object requires the <b>measurement</b> of the <b>intensity</b> distribution as far as possible in reciprocal space. Thus, fulfilling the oversampling and resolution constraints, in 3 D, implies very long acquisition times, hardly compatible with the stability of the X-ray synchrotron source or sample. To overcome this problem, we present a method based on partial crossed intensity measurements: it consists in two irregularly spaced <b>intensity</b> <b>measurements</b> taken in two orthogonal directions. This paper demonstrates that partial crossed <b>intensity</b> <b>measurements</b> are in principle sufficient to reconstruct 2 D objects using a phase retrieval algorithm. We also describe how such measurements can be achieved in practice for 3 D imaging. 3 D <b>intensity</b> <b>measurements</b> taken in two orthogonal directions for a 111 Bragg peak of a sub-micrometer Au grain are shown...|$|R

30|$|There {{are four}} {{different}} SPR detection modes, which indicate angular interrogation, <b>intensity</b> <b>measurement,</b> phase interrogation, and wavelength measurement [19, 21]. Among these approaches, the angular and intensity detection schemes {{have been widely}} used as the SPR measurement mode. Angular interrogation [22] detects the SPR angle change by monitoring the SPR reflectance dip shift. This offers highly sensitive performance by measuring extremely small angle changes of the SPR using the Au chip with a broad SPR reflectance curve. The <b>intensity</b> <b>measurement</b> [23] monitors the intensity of the reflected light at a fixed angle where the maximum slope of the SPR reflectance curve is located. This method is very effective {{in the case of an}} SPR reflectance curve with a narrower full width at half maximum (FWHM), leading to great reflectance variation at this fixed angle [24, 25].|$|E
