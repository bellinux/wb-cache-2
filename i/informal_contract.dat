The study aimed to compare the effectiveness of formal and <b>informal</b> <b>contracts</b> in the decision of cooperation of the agent and also to investigate their joint effects of substitution or complement on the cooperation of the agents. For that, an experiment was performed to test in a laboratorial environment the behavior of agents under the pressure of both contracts. The results of the experiment showed that <b>informal</b> <b>contracts</b> are more effective to guarantee cooperation among agents. Furthermore, formal and <b>informal</b> <b>contracts</b> can be used as substitutes or complements according to the order in which they are applied. When formal <b>contracts</b> precede <b>informal</b> ones, there is an increase in cooperation levels among agents...|$|R

We find that these <b>informal</b> <b>contracts</b> increased spot prices, as argued by some industry members, while the effect on spot price volatility varied by production region.

40|$|In this paper, {{we develop}} {{a model that}} captures stylized facts of {{informal}} labor markets. We show how justice interference on <b>informal</b> <b>contracts</b> leads to penalties in the equilibrium wage of informal workers. We also state that, in a repeated game situation, an equilibrium where the wage gaps between formal and <b>informal</b> <b>contracts</b> diminish with the worker skills exists and is unique. These claims are supported by two assumptions: (i) {{the existence of a}} technology that makes possible a ?rm to buy information about the worker productivity and past actions; (ii) unskilled workers have a more homogenous productivity than the skilled workers.

Relationships in this market are valuable if they mitigate potential hold-up problems and incentives for ex post rene- gotiation due to contractual incompleteness. An important characteristic of <b>informal</b> <b>contracts</b> are that they must be self-enforcing, so that the value of relationships between ¯rms and suppliers depend on the extent of possibilities for future interaction. We construct measures of the stock of contractors' prior interactions with relevant subcontractors and ¯nd that a larger stock of relationships leads to lower bids and a greater likelihood of entry. Importantly, this relationship does not hold in periods of time and areas with little future contract volume, suggesting that the self-enforcement mechanism is crucial in providing value for <b>informal</b> <b>contracts...</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} theory that {{explains}} why rational agents start to believe in a causal relationship between unrelated events. Agents send and collect messages through a communication network. If they are convinced of a relationship between two events, they send messages confirming their belief with higher probability than messages contradicting it. The network aggregates this communication bias over individuals. Therefore, agents may find a strong relationship between unrelated events even if the communication bias is very small. We apply this model to an informal economy where the fear of punishment by supernatural forces prevents agents from cheating others.

30|$|The {{positive}} effect of labor inspections on both margins of worker flows {{may seem a}} surprise. However, the main data we exploit, RAIS, only captures formal sector jobs even if the establishment keeps some unregistered workers. Hence, what is computed as accession may represent a worker flow within the establishment from an informal to a formal position. That could explain the {{positive effect}} on accessions. The positive effect on separations is interpreted in two ways: firstly, as an employer’s reaction aiming cost reduction. Dismissing employees compensates the labor cost increase due to the formalization procedure aforementioned. Secondly, for a given turnover rate, the more formal workers the establishment has, the more separations will be registered at RAIS. This interpretation depends on firms employing part of their workforce under <b>informal</b> <b>contracts.</b> Hence, the magnitude of our results should increase the higher the propensity of firms to hire workers under <b>informal</b> <b>contracts.</b> We will provide some suggestive evidence consistent with this interpretation.|$|R

40|$|The {{rapid growth}} in demand for pork in Viet Nam {{presents}} an opportunity for rural households raising pigs to improve their incomes. This market potential could be exploited to improve incomes of rural smallholders through institutional arrangements that provide improved access to livestock markets and services, through formal and <b>informal</b> <b>contract</b> arrangements. Contract arrangements, however, have explicit and implicit barriers to entry that tend to exclude smallholders, depending {{on the nature of}} the contracts. Based on data from a field survey conducted in four provinces in Northern Viet Nam in 2005 - 06, comprising a sample of 400 pig raising households (200 independent producers, 166 farmers with informal contracts, and 34 farmers with formal contracts with a large integrator), a multinomial logit model was used to identify the factors that determine the likelihood of engagement in formal or informal contracts. A simple probit model was subsequently developed for the determinants of engagement in <b>informal</b> <b>contract</b> arrangements. Results indicate that farmers with higher levels of education and larger physical asset holdings are more likely to be engaged in formal contracts. The latter are largely limited to large-scale farmers (with mean holdings of about 600 pigs per farm) that specialized in pig fattening. In contrast, informal contracts are less exclusionary of smallholder producers. Households with higher levels of education, managing full-cycle pig operations, and with pig production being a main occupation, are more likely to engage in informal contracts, than remain independent producers. However, rather than size of physical assets, social capital appears to be a more important determinant of engaging in informal contracts. Providing a supportive policy and institutional environment for various informal contracting arrangements in pig production and marketing could improve access to markets and services by rural smallholder pig producers...|$|E

In our model, connections between individuals generate social collateral {{that can be used}} to control moral hazard when agents interact in a borrowing relationship. We define trust between two agents as the amount that one can borrow from the other, and derive a simple reduced form expression for trust as a function of the social network. We show that trust is higher in more connected and more homogenous societies, and relate our trust measure to commonly used network statistics. The model implies that dense networks generate greater welfare when arrangements typically require high trust, and loose networks create more welfare otherwise. Using data on social networks and behavior in dictator games, we document evidence consistent with the quantitative predictions of the model...|$|E

(2) For job recommendation networks, we show that strong ties between employers and trusted recommenders reduce asymmetric information about the quality of job candidates.

A contract can describe contingencies and actions at a more or less detailed level, and the cost of writing a contract is proportional to the amount of detail. We consider both formal (externally enforced) and <b>informal</b> (self-enforcing) <b>contracts.</b> The presence of writing costs has important implications both for the optimal structure of formal contracts, particularly the tradeoff between contingent and spot contracts, and for the interaction between formal and <b>informal</b> <b>contracting.</b> Our model sheds light on these implications and generates a rich set of predictions about the determinants of the optimal mode of contracting. ...|$|R

40|$|A large {{theoretical}} and empirical literature suggests that the salience of network-based ties in contract enforcement under relation-based governance systems limits market expansion. This paper illustrates the incorporation of new agents into market exchange under conditions of <b>informal</b> <b>contract</b> governance using {{a case study of}} the cycle-rickshaw rental market in a city in central India. Our analytical model formalizes features of this market through a higher penalty of default for migrants that introduces a gap between the ex ante risk for out-of-network agents and the ex post risk. The model predicts a sorting equilibrium such that migrants are more likely to participate in the rental contract. We test this prediction using primary survey data with multidimensional measures of migrant status and find that it is a significant predictor of rental contract participation, even controlling for credit access and other variables that moderate the rickshaw driver’s ability to own a cycle-rickshaw. ...|$|E
30|$|The {{interaction}} between {{formal and informal}} institutions is particularly important in less developed countries. In these countries de facto practices are quite different from de jure rules – and these differences are often shaped by the {{interaction between}} formal and informal institutions. The only theoretical exposition of such interactions that we have come across is Dixit (2004) where {{he argues that the}} development of the formal may have a detrimental effect on the informal mechanisms. The informal system relies heavily on the reputation mechanism, where someone with a reputation of cheating does not get a job within his/her community. People using formal contracts however do not care about reputation – punishment under formal contracting is direct and enforced by a third party (fine, imprisonment). Hence one can always cheat someone using the <b>informal</b> <b>contract</b> and then find their next employment with another employer using a formal contract.|$|E

In this paper we examine how formal and <b>informal</b> <b>contract</b> enforcing institutions interact {{in a competitive}} market where consumers do not observe quality before purchase. Firm level incentives for high quality can be achieved with an informal enforcement mechanism, reputation, the efficacy of which is enhanced by consumers investing in “connectedness, ” or with a for-mal mechanism, legal enforcement, the effectiveness {{of which can be}} reduced by means of bribes. Higher levels of development (proxied by the lower frequency of bad productivity shocks) are associated with a lower efficacy of informal enforcement, and – up to a certain threshold – better performance of formal institutions as well as lower incentive compatible market prices, and higher con-sumer welfare. In addition, the theory predicts that any market characteristic that causes prices to be lower is associated with better performing judicial in-stitutions...|$|E

Most farmers do not engage in contracting {{and for those who}} do, many of these contracts are found to be informal. In addition, most of these contracts (whether formal or informal) were breached. However, some buyers appear to be associated with contract breaches. A distinct pattern emerges showing that larger milk producers are more likely to make formal contracts than small producers while the results also confirm that most of the contracts between farmers and individual consumers as well as traders and middlemen are informal and subject to contract breaches. Using a multiple correspondence analysis, these associations between contract breaches and farmer characteristics are explored. Results indicate that collective action institutions might encourage formalization of contracts while households that do not engage in some form of collective action engagements in most cases make <b>informal</b> <b>contracts</b> although both formal and <b>informal</b> <b>contracts</b> are equally subject to contract breaches. An examination of the underlying institutional, psychological and sociological drivers to contract breaches is recommended as such information can reveal how best to upgrade successful contract farming arrangements. ...|$|R

Firm level incentives for producing high quality can be achieved with an informal enforcement mechanism, reputation, the efficacy of which is enhanced by consumers investing in "connectedness:" or with a formal mechanism, legal enforcement, the effectiveness {{of which can be}} reduced by means of bribes. We show that formal and informal enforcement mechanisms do not necessarily substitute each other: while high levels of judicial efficiency decrease consumers' incentives to connect, higher consumers' connectedness leads to higher levels of judicial efficiency.

In doing so we show the presence of a new, physical, channel that can affect institutions-i. e. the frequency of bad productivity shocks that, in less developed settings, can impact on firms' incentives to cheat.

The major question {{in this study is}} how informal and formal contracting processes differ between projects procured through the CD and comparable projects that are traditionally procured. In a theoretical framework, it is shown that both the negotiations and the commitment stages consist of a formal part (formal bargaining/formal legal contract) and an informal part (informal sense-making/informal psychological contract), and that these dynamically interact as problems of understanding are identified and resolved. These elements and their interactions are studied in four comparable construction projects.
