40|$|The Nordic {{countries}} have no tradition {{of judicial review}} by courts and have generally been hesitant {{to make use of}} the <b>preliminary</b> <b>ruling</b> <b>procedure</b> in the European Union. New data indicate that Nordic courts prefer to solve as many EU-related judicial disputes as possible without involving a supranational organ such as the ECJ. Building on two comprehensive surveys of Danish and Swedish courts and judges, this study challenges the theory of judicial empowerment when explaining judicial integration in the EU. The article argues that in order to explain when and why Member State courts make use of the <b>preliminary</b> <b>ruling</b> <b>procedure,</b> a much deeper understanding of the prevalent legal/political culture and concept of democracy in each Member State is required. In particular, the distinction between majoritarian versus constitutional democracies may help us understand why majoritarian democracies express greater scepticism towards supranational judicial review.

40|$|For years, the Court of Justice of the European Union {{has been}} {{overloaded}} with requests for <b>preliminary</b> <b>rulings,</b> given that these proceedings make {{up more than}} three-quarters of the Court caseload. Such circumstances constitute a significant constraint to the operation of the Court, which is unable to quickly and effectively respond to the preliminary questions which are referred to this Court by the national courts of Member States. In addition, the duration of the regular <b>preliminary</b> <b>ruling</b> proceedings jeopardizes the European standards {{not only in terms of}} the lengthy procedure but also in terms of observing the right of each individual to effective judicial protection within a reasonable time. In order to make the proceedings faster and more effective, the procedural rules have been repeatedly amended and supplemented. The applicable Rules of Procedure of the Court stipulate some exceptions from the regular <b>preliminary</b> <b>ruling</b> <b>procedure.</b> The first one is the so-called simplified procedure, where the Court renders a final decision in the form of a reasoned order, without scheduling an oral hearing and obtaining the written opinion of the Advocate-General. The Court may also decide to institute the expedited procedure, by means of which the case at issue is given absolute priority over other cases. The last exception is the urgent procedure, which is applicable only in the area of freedom, security and justice; it implies the omission of certain stages of the regular <b>preliminary</b> <b>ruling</b> <b>procedure.</b> The analyses presented in this paper show that the results achieved in terms of reducing the length of the regular <b>preliminary</b> <b>ruling</b> <b>procedure</b> are generally positive. Thus, the average time required for rendering a decision in the expedited procedure is approximately four and a half months, which is certainly a significant improvement as compared to the length of the regular procedure which takes sixteen to seventeen months. The initial results accomplished by instituting the urgent procedure are even more encouraging, as the average duration of this procedure is approximately two months. The time required for deliberation in an urgent procedure has never exceeded three months, which makes this procedure faster and more efficient than the expedited procedure...|$|R

40|$|The article {{deals with}} the {{relation}} between the action for annulment under Art 230 EC and the control of validity within the scope of the <b>preliminary</b> <b>ruling</b> <b>procedure</b> under Art 234 (1) (b) EC. Despite some fundamental differences between both procedures - Art 230 EC is a direct action before the community courts, while Art 234 EC is a procedure of co-operation between national courts and the ECJ - overlaps are possible: After expiration of the time-limit, pursuant to Art. 230 (5) EC, legal acts of community institutions become final. Yet, since the institution of a <b>preliminary</b> <b>ruling</b> <b>procedure</b> is not subject to any time-limit, such legal acts can be subject to a preliminary reference concerning their validity after the time limit pursuant to Art 230 (5) has already expired. Making a reference in favour of a person who could bring an action for annulment against such an act but has failed to do so, would thus circumvent the finality of that act. For this reason the ECJ rejects references concerning the validity of acts under Art 234 EC, if an annulment action of the person in whose favour the reference is made was obviously admissible but no such action was brought. The article analyses the case-law existing on this issue and attempts to determine more precisely the criterion of obviousness. In addition, the article highlights constellations of overlap that have not yet been subject of the existing case-law...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{recently}} debated issues about the <b>preliminary</b> <b>ruling</b> <b>procedure</b> is about State liability for breaches of EU law by the judiciary. Stemming from the implications of three sets of cases by the Court of Justice of the European Union, namely Köbler, Kühne and Kempter, Lucchini and Fallimento Olimpiclub, the issue calls for a reflection on the possibility to sanction at national level a judicial decision not to refer. The issue is of particular relevance since the European Court of Human Rights has ruled that an arbitrary decision not to refer a question for a <b>preliminary</b> <b>ruling</b> theoretically could infringe {{the right to a}} fair trial. The work by Laurent Coutron, L’Obligation De Renvoi Préjudiciel: Une Obligation Sanctionnée ?, offers detailed analyses on this issue in nineteen EU Member States, including Ireland. Some legal systems such as Germany regard the <b>preliminary</b> <b>ruling</b> <b>procedure</b> as a right for individuals who are entitled to an appropriate remedy when this right has been infringed by failure to refer by a supreme court which has the obligation to do so. Other countries have started to hint in this direction, for example the French Court of Cassation which has recently decided that the refusal to refer could be regarded as a ‘denial of justice’ leading to possible State liability proceedings. The report on Ireland is divided in three parts. A first part gives an overview of the practice of preliminary procedure by Irish courts with updated figures and trends. A second part presents preliminary observations about the domestic courts subject to the obligation to refer. The third part analyses the mechanisms aimed at 2 ̆ 7 sanctioning 2 ̆ 7 the failure to refer by courts against which there is no remedy. While such mechanisms are absent in Irish law, the chapter puts forward two potential options, namely the possibility of judicial review and State liability for a decision not to refer by the Supreme Court, the High Court and instances involving lower courts against which there is no further remedy...|$|R

His lecture focuses on the <b>preliminary</b> <b>ruling</b> <b>procedure</b> of Article 267 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. This procedure gives every national court the power – and even imposes an obligation on some courts – to refer preliminary questions concerning the interpretation of European law and the validity of the acts of EU institutions to the Court of Justice of the European Union. This procedure is a vital and successful dialogue between national courts and the Court of Justice – one beset by old problems and facing new challenges. The author looks more closely at the <b>preliminary</b> <b>ruling</b> <b>procedure</b> and its functioning. What factors affect the success of this dialogue? And how can we ensure that it continues to be successful? More specifically, Professor Jurian Langer examines the opportunities for national courts and the Court of Justice – within the current parameters of the European treaties – to influence the dialogue and to continue successful cooperation. The author argues that if the main actors involved continue to shoulder their shared responsibility underlying the procedure, it {{will continue to be a}} success. In this context, his lecture suggests, among other things, an increased 'European' role for the highest national courts by relaxing the CILFIT-criteria, an increased use of Article 101 of the Rules of Procedure as well as a stricter admissibility rule regarding references in relation to internal situations.

In this contribution we study the differences in the level of self-evaluation of EU law knowledge among judges, which consequently influence the way judges approach EU law.

40|$|Recent {{quantitative}} {{research has shown}} a sizable impact of the European Commission’s written observations on the <b>preliminary</b> <b>rulings</b> of the Court of Justice of the European Union. In explaining the high success rate of the Commission, scholars have referred to an old assumption according to which the Court uses the Commission as a ‘political bellwether’ to determine how farMember States may be pushed towards enhanced legal integration in any given case. The present study assesses {{the validity of the}} assumption that the Commission acts according to such logic in these proceedings. Interviews with central actors in the Commission reveal internal processes and considerations made when determining the Commission’s position in three ‘most likely’ cases. Rather than a political bellwether, the empirical findings suggest that the Commission is better characterized as an activist that seeks to {{contribute to the development of}} EU law in line with its own policy preferences or legal analysis irrespective of whether such preferences are politically acceptable to Member States. Scholars seeking to understand the Commission’s success rate under the <b>preliminary</b> <b>ruling</b> <b>procedure</b> should thus consider alternative explanations to the Commission’s success. In this regard, theories stressing the Commission’s expertise, resources and judicial strategy of being a ‘repeat player’ appear to be particularly relevant...|$|R
40|$|The European Court of Justice and European {{integration}} {{has recently}} {{been the subject of}} scholarly discussion. The ECJ contributes to European integration in terms of legal integration. For legal integration to be possible, and therefore the ECJ to be successful, it is necessary for member states of the European Union to internalize the legal norms and rules of EU law, such as direct effect and EU law supremacy. The constructivist approach to European integration addresses this issue of internalization through the process of social learning whereby repeated interactions spawn new interests. The application of social learning within the member states comes from the repeated interactions of their national courts with the ECJ through the <b>preliminary</b> <b>ruling</b> <b>procedure.</b> <b>Preliminary</b> <b>ruling</b> enables national courts to learn the proper way in which EU law can be interpreted and applied. However, social learning by interaction with the ECJ is lost on the member states’ politicians because they are not in direct interaction with the ECJ. Therefore, the greater the position of the judicial system within the national politics of member states, which has undergone social learning with the ECJ, the higher the level of compliance with EU law there will be, furthering legal integration...|$|R
