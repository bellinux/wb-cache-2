40|$|SAMMENDRAG Statens rettstoksikologiske institutt har i løpet av de siste år registrert en stor økning av prøver fra bilførere mistenkt for kjøring under påvirkning av andre rusmidler enn alkohol. Antall {{positive}} saker økte 42 % fra 1994 til 1995. De hyppigste påviste stoffer er tetrahydrocannabinol, amfetamin, benzodiazepiner og opiater (morfin/kodein). Bruk av tyngre narkotiske stoffer har blitt mer vanlig i trafikksammenheng og antall positive tilfeller har økt betydelig mer enn totalt antall saker. Fra 1994 til 1995 økte antall positive amfetaminprøver med 75 % (fra 533 til 937) og antall positive prøver som følge av heroininntak økte med 87 % (fra 92 til 172). Bruk av flere stoffer samtidig er vanlig, over 60 % av sakene i 1995 var positive på mer enn ett stoff, alkohol ikke medregnet. De fleste tilfeller var representert av menn i alderen 25 - 32 år (37 %). Kvinner var representert i ca. 11 % av sakene.

ENGLISH SUMMARY The National Institute of Forensic Toxicology has registered a large {{increase in the number of}} samples from drivers suspected to drive under influence of drugs other than alcohol. The number of drug positive cases increased 42 % from 1994 to 1995. The most frequent drugs detected are tetrahydrocannabinol, amphetamine, benzodiazepines and opiates (morphine/codeine). The frequency of <b>hard</b> <b>narcotic</b> drug use has increased more than the total number of cases. From 1994 to 1995, the number of amphetamine positive samples increased 75 % (from 533 to 937) and the number of samples positive due to heroin use (detection of the metabolite 6 - monoacetylmorphine in urine) increased 87 %. Multi-drug use is common and more than one drug was detected in more than 60 % of the cases from 1995, alcohol not included. Most of the cases were represented by men 25 - 32 years old (37 %). Women were represented in about 11 % of the cases. </p...|$|E

50|$|On May 25, 2003 {{less than}} a month before the release of their first {{full-length}} album, De-Loused in the Comatorium, bandmate and close friend Jeremy Ward was found dead of a heroin overdose. This event, coupled with the memories of the suicide of his friend Julio Venegas years earlier, finally convinced both him and Bixler-Zavala to quit using <b>hard</b> <b>narcotics.</b> Since then he has been clean and credited his newfound musical work ethic on his new lifestyle. The Mars Volta's second album, Frances the Mute, would later be dedicated to Ward.|$|R
25|$|Smoking {{is one of}} {{the most}} common forms of {{recreational}} drug use. Tobacco smoking is the most popular form, being practiced by over one billion people globally, of whom the majority are in the developing countries. Less common drugs for smoking include cannabis and opium. Some of the substances are classified as <b>hard</b> <b>narcotics,</b> like heroin, but the use of these is very limited as they are usually not commercially available. Cigarettes are primarily industrially manufactured but also can be hand-rolled from loose tobacco and rolling paper. Other smoking implements include pipes, cigars, bidis, hookahs, and bongs.|$|R

During filming, the married Scorsese became romantically involved with Minnelli and began heavily using cocaine and other <b>hard</b> <b>narcotics.</b> At the time Andy Warhol wrote in his diary that Minnelli and Scorsese showed up at the door of a famous fashion designer demanding: [...] "Give me every drug you've got".|$|R
40|$|Increasing {{interest}} {{in high school}} drug use has been expressed {{in recent years by}} parents, educators, government officials, and the media. Yet little is actually known about this area. Inaccurate statistics are prevalent throughout the drug world, but perhaps no greater inaccuracy exists than on the high school level (Blum & Associates, 1969, p. 332). Most studies of adolescent drug use are based on college populations. Much less research has been done with younger teenagers: those on the high school and Junior high school level. Yet this is where knowledge of the drug user is most important. It is necessary to be able to describe the drug user in order to predict who will be the future drug user. Knowing the extent of drug use in the schools today is important in planning preventive drug education and treatment programs for tomorrow. This paper will bring together the existing data on high school drug use as reported in studies of the last five years. This will serve to define the limits of present knowledge and to point the way for future studies. Drugs covered will include alcohol, marijuana, LSD and other hallucinogens, psychoactive drags (amphetamines, barbiturates and tranquilizers), and glue and other inhalants. <b>Hard</b> drugs (<b>narcotics)</b> will not be discussed. A drug user {{for the purposes of this}} paper will include anyone who has used one or more of the above-listed drugs on one or more occasions. Prevalence of drug use, motivation for use, characteristics of drug users and their families, and attitudes toward drugs will be discussed. Thesis (M. A. ...|$|R
