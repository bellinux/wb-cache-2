They both maintain that accumulation of capital may proceed too fast, not merely for the moral but for the material interest of those who produce and accumulate; and they enjoin the rich to guard against this evil by an ample unproductive consumption.|$|E
5000|$|The United States' [...] "War on Drugs" [...] {{has added}} {{considerably}} {{to the political}} instability in South America. The huge profits to be made from cocaine and other South American-grown drugs are largely because they are illegal in the wealthy neighbouring nation. This drives people in the relatively poor countries of Colombia, Peru, Bolivia and Brazil to break their own laws in organising the cultivation, preparation and trafficking of cocaine to the States. This has allowed criminal, paramilitary and guerrilla groups to reap huge profits, exacerbating already serious law-and-order and political problems. Within Bolivia, the political rise of current president Evo Morales {{is directly related to}} his grassroots movement against US-sponsored coca-eradication and criminalization policies. However, coca has been cultivated for centuries in the Andes. Among their various legitimate uses, coca leaves are chewed for their mild stimulant & appetite suppression effects, and steeped as a tea which is known to reduce the effects of human altitude sickness. Rural farmers in the poor regions in which coca has historically been cultivated often find themselves at the difficult and potentially violent intersection of government-sponsored eradication efforts, illegal cocaine producers & traffickers seeking coca supplies, anti-government paramilitary forces trafficking in cocaine as a source of revolutionary funding, and the historical hardships of rural subsistence farming (or the its typical alternative - abandoning their land and fleeing to an urban slum). In some regions, farmers' coca and other crops are frequently destroyed by U.S.-sponsored eradication treatments (usually sprayed from the air with varying degrees of discrimination), whether or not the farmers directly supply the cocaine trade, thereby destroying their livelihoods. Agricultural producers in these countries are pushed further to grow coca for the cocaine trade by the dumping of subsidised farming products (fruit, vegetables, grain etc.) produced by Western countries (predominantly US and EU agricultural surpluses) (see BBC reference, below), which reduces the prices they could otherwise receive for alternate crops such as maize. The net effect can be a <b>depression</b> <b>of</b> <b>prices</b> for all crops, which can both make the farmer's livelihood more precarious, and make the cocaine producers' coca supplies cheaper.|$|E
40|$|Between 1872 and 1896 {{there was}} a <b>depression</b> <b>of</b> <b>prices</b> and profits in {{manufacturing}} industry. The successful industrialization of the United States and Germany eroded British confidence in the workings of laissez faire. The Royal Commissions of the 1880 's on the 'Great Depression' and Technical Instruction both considered that education has {{a crucial role in}} the successful restructuring of British industry. Government through the Department of Science and Art fostered scientific and technical studies. The Technical Training Act of 1889 increased the use of government funds for forcing scientific syllabuses on higher grade elementary and organized science schools. These syllabuses were of vocational value to school leavers becoming apprentices, draughtsmen and engineers. Education was used to improve industrial efficiency in the face of intensifying foreign competition. Many science higher grade elementary schools became local authority secondary schools under the 1902 Education Act. Within five years of the 1902 Act applied science and technical studies were phased out of state secondary schools. These schools now followed arts and pure science courses. Ninety per cent of secondary school leavers became black-coated or white-bloused workers. Schools ceased to play an effective role in educating workers for industrial employment. Education in the first decade of the (20 reacted to economic and occupational change. Britain's recovery from the 'Great Depression' owed much to a dynamic tertiary sector. Her decline from industrial pre-eminence was compensated by becoming the world's leading commercial nation. Britain dominated international shipping, banking, insurance and the provision of investment capital in developing countries. Earnings from these activities provided large surpluses on the balance of payments, profitable outlets for British capital and expanding occupational opportunities. The functional relationship between education and the tertiary sector continued throughout the 1920 's. and 1930 's. In the (20 government ceased to intervene in the curriculum. Power devolved away from government to teachers, their professional associations and University Examining Boards. The Second World War shattered much of the complacency about the structure of the economy. The tertiary sector made little contribution to the war effort. Most of Britain's overseas assets were sold to purchase essential raw materials. The Government recognized that postwar reconstruction required a massive switch of resources into manufacturing industry. This happened and in the 1940 's and 1950 's industry achieved unprecedented importance in the national economy. Changes in the economic and occupational structure evoked little response from education. Although the earnings of many clerical and professional workers fell behind those of craftsmen in industry, it had no effect on the syllabuses of secondary schools. The grammar schools continued to provide an education suitable for clerics and professionals. Teachers freed from government interference in 1907, now foiled an effective veto group pursuing its own interests even where they were inimical to economic recovery. The failure of secondary and higher education to respond positively to postwar reconstruction was a significant factor in shortages of skilled industrial workers and engineers. These shortages retarded economic expansion and contributed to manpower productivity growth rates which were the lowest in the industrialized world. The failure of education to respond to postwar reconstruction had paradoxical results. The relative decline in manufacturing forced governments to increase the size of the public sector to mop up unemployment. Education increased its bias towards the arts, social and pure sciences. These subjects provided school leavers with threshold qualifications for public sector white collar work. These trends were based upon stagnating productive industry. The developments of the 1960 's and 1970 's heightened the contradictions between education and the economy. The contradictions could only be resolved by an acceptance of permanent economic decline or a fundamental change in the role of education in the proposed regeneration of manufacturing industry...|$|E

60|$|I {{have already}} {{described}} {{the state of}} the markets for commodities which accompanies what is termed a commercial crisis. At such times there is really an excess of all commodities above the money demand: in other words, there is an under-supply of money. From the sudden annihilation of a great mass of credit, every one dislikes to part with ready money, and many are anxious to procure it at any sacrifice. Almost everybody, therefore, is a seller, and there are scarcely any buyers: so that there may really be, though only while the crisis lasts, an extreme <b>depression</b> <b>of</b> general <b>prices,</b> from what may be indiscriminately called a glut of commodities or a dearth of money. But it is a great error to suppose, with Sismondi, that a commercial crisis is the effect of a general excess of production. It is simply the consequence of an excess of speculative purchases. It is not a gradual advent <b>of</b> low <b>prices,</b> but a sudden recoil from prices extravagantly high: its immediate cause is a contraction of credit, and the remedy is, not a diminution of supply, but the restoration of confidence. It is also evident that this temporary derangement of markets is an evil only because it is temporary. The fall being solely <b>of</b> money <b>prices,</b> if prices did not rise again no dealer would lose, since the smaller price would be worth as much to him as the larger price was before. In no matter does this phenomenon answer to the description which these celebrated economists have given of the evil of over-production. That permanent decline in the circumstances of producers, for want of markets, which those writers contemplate, is a conception to which the nature of a commercial crisis gives no support.|$|R

40|$|The {{study is}} {{concerned}} with the production and marketing of dura (sorghum) and sesame in the eastern central rainlands of the Sudan. The two crops are regarded as major export commodities and considerable emphasis has been given to expanding the areas under cultivation using mechanised farming cultivation. The study examines production aspects and the marketing component of the research concentrates on comparing the performancies of the public and private sectors. Dura marketing {{is in the hands of}} the latter and sesame in the former. The thesis consists of eleven chapters and begins with an introduction to the economy of the Sudan. Four chapters then follow on dura production and marketing. The first deals with both the economic and agronomic aspects of mechanised dura production with special reference to the two main surplus areas, Gedaref and Damazine. The second chapter deals with the production of dura in the Sudan. The third chapter discusses the internal trade in dura - together with the spatial and temporal analysis. The marketing situation is also dealt with in detail. The final chapter on dura examines the world market situation. In the years with good crops the Sudan is a major exporter but when the annual crop is low, the Government bans exports. The next four chapters deal with sesame. The first concentrates on production, the second on the internal trade, the third {{is concerned with}} the internal supply, demand and price situation and the fourth with the world trade in oilseeds in which Sudanese sesame is an important commodity. Chapter ten summarises common features of both dura and sesame production and marketing in the Sudan and makes various recommendations to alleviate major problems. In the final chapter, the thesis is summarised and the conclusion presented. The private sector is characterised by oligopoly in the marketing structure, but the level of efficiency attained in the performance of marketing functions is relatively high, given the lack of infrastructure in the Sudan.

This goal of this dissertation was to conduct preclinical research experiments designed to address a set of three inter-related aims that examine the expression, mechanisms and treatment <b>of</b> pain-related <b>depression</b> <b>of</b> Intracranial Self-Stimulation (ICSS) in rats. First, studies evaluated the hypothesis that acute acid-induced <b>depression</b> <b>of</b> ICSS was mediated by a kappa opioid receptor mediated decrease in mesolimbic dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens. Results support a role for depressed mesolimbic dopamine release in pain-related <b>depression</b> <b>of</b> ICSS; however, a role for kappa opioid receptors is not supported. Second, studies evaluated the effectiveness of a more sustained inflammatory noxious stimulus (intraplantar CFA) and a sustained neuropathic stimulus (intraplantar formalin) to produce a long-term pain-related <b>depression</b> <b>of</b> ICSS, and the role of kappa opioid receptors in mediating this sustained pain-related <b>depression</b> <b>of</b> ICSS. Results indicated that only the neuropathic stimulus (formalin) was sufficient to produce sustained <b>depression</b> <b>of</b> ICSS, and as in the initial studies, our data did not support a role for kappa receptors in mediating this effect. Given the poor effectiveness of a kappa receptor antagonist to block acute or chronic pain-related <b>depression</b> <b>of</b> ICSS, the final set of studies evaluated the pharmacology of representative drugs from five different classes of established or candidate analgesics (mu opioid agonists, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, monoamine uptake inhibitors, anticonvulsants, and cannabinoid agonists) to reverse the sustained <b>depression</b> <b>of</b> ICSS produced by formalin as a neuropathic stimulus.
