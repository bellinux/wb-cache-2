A trade-off strategy between traffic offloading from the macrocell {{and the energy}} consumption of the small cell is proposed in [8], who provides a sleeping strategy for the cognitive SAPs. In [9], authors take SAPs to have cognitive capabilities and define a fundamental limit which allows robust user detection on the <b>interference</b> <b>density.</b> So an energy efficient SAP design is impossible when beyond that limit.|$|E

In case of α-stable noise, the optimal inputs of the belief propagation decoder are complex to obtain. We propose to use the simple clipping approach that reduces the impact of large noise values. Our main contribution is to give three different approaches to obtain the parameters of the clipping function and to assess the performance of the decoder. We show that a look-up table whose values are predetermined, thanks to the Density Evolution tool, is the most efficient approach.

The presented analysis, which is validated by Monte Carlo simulations, accounts for the actual transmitting/receiving antenna patterns and is based on recent mmWave channel models, which include noise, angular dispersion, mid-scale fading, and bounded path-loss. Analytical forms for the distribution of the interference-plus-noise power are derived to enable a fast and accurate computation of the capture probability when beamforming, node location, and propagation aspects must be jointly considered. The developed framework is finally used to discuss the impact of the <b>interference</b> <b>density</b> on the Shannon capacity of a mmWave uplink in realistic channel conditions...|$|E

The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) has allocated a pair of 300 MHz of spectrum in the V band for these services, which is already in use by geostationary satellite and wireless terrestrial systems as co-primary allocations. This paper addresses an in-depth co-channel interference analysis and proposes a C/I (carrier-to-interference) calculation model applicable to all the interference propagation paths as well as sharing criteria between HAPN, GEO satellite and wireless terrestrial systems extracted from simulations performed in urban, suburban and rural environments.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the power allocation with fixed rate constraint problem in multi-carrier code {{division multiple access}} (MC-CDMA) networks, that has been solved through game theoretic perspective by the use of an iterative water-filling algorithm (IWFA). The problem is analyzed under various <b>interference</b> <b>density</b> configurations, and its reliability is studied in terms of solution existence and uniqueness. Moreover, numerical results reveal the approach shortcoming, thus a new method combining swarm intelligence and IWFA is proposed to make practicable the use of game theoretic approaches in realistic MC-CDMA systems scenarios. The contribution of this paper is twofold: (i) provide a complete analysis for the existence and uniqueness of the game solution, from simple to more realist and complex interference scenarios; (ii) propose a hybrid power allocation optimization method combining swarm intelligence, game theory and IWFA. To corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed method, an outage probability analysis in realistic interference scenarios, and a complexity comparison with the classical IWFA are presented.

Nevertheless, a massive deployment of small cell access points (SAPs) leads also to a considerable increase in energy consumption. Spurred by growing environmental awareness and the high price of energy, it is crucial to design energy efficient wireless systems for both macrocells and small cells. In this work, we evaluate a distributed sleep-mode strategy for cognitive SAPs and we analyze the trade-off between traffic offloading from the macrocell and the energy consumption of the small cells. Using tools from stochastic geometry, we define the user discovery performance of the SAP and derive the uplink capacity of the small cells located in the Voronoi cell of a macrocell base station, accounting for the uncertainties associated with random position, density, user activity, propagation channel, network interference generated by uncoordinated activity, and the sensing scheme.

40|$|Given a {{wireless}} network with N nodes located uniformly at random on a finite plane, {{we consider the}} problem of distributed peer discovery: all nodes want to discover as many other nodes as possible. We assume {{that there are a}} total of K physical resources dedicated for the discovery purpose. Each node can pick one resource to transmit its node identifier on, and can receive on the remaining K - 1 resources. We assume that node identifiers are broadcast via coded transmission on one single physical resource using a single hop. This paper addresses link level strategies to maximize the average number of discovered devices when K <;<; N. A classical strategy of decoding one node per resource would lead to a maximum of K - 1 nodes being discovered. We observe that typically this number is much lower (~K/ 2). We focus on n-user joint coding schemes to improve this performance and, more particularly, on joint iterative decoding (JID). It is shown through system simulations that JID may gain by significantly more than 100 % over the classical single-user decoding, and by 20 - 25 % over interference cancellation, provided that the number n of jointly decoded identifiers matches the actual <b>interference</b> <b>density...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{localized}} charge distributions defined previously {{are used}} to calculate INDO bond moments and energies {{of a variety of}} CH bonds in acyclic hydrocarbons. The polarity of all bonds discussed is c+H-. It is found that each basic type of CH bond (primary, vinyl, ethynyl) has an overflow of electron density (a 2 ̆ 2 tail 2 ̆ 2) out of the bond region which resides on and is characteristic of those atoms trans and coplanar to the bond. It is demonstrated that, since these tails are virtually independent of each other, the basic bond moments can be used to construct a model which predicts all calculated bond moments and orientations to a high degree of accuracy. While the total energies of the bonds ei (where the molecular energy E = iei) are not very transferable, the intra bond and interference energies can be predicted rather well using a similar model. The trends in the bond moments are discussed in terms of the point charge and polarization contributions, and the interference energies are shown to correlate well with the trends in experimental CH bond energies. The trends in both properties are principally determined by the loss of <b>interference</b> <b>density</b> within the bond due to the presence of overflow atoms...|$|E
