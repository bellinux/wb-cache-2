40|$|We provide {{empirical}} evidence of volatility forecasting {{in relation to}} asymmetries present in the dynamics of both return and volatility processes. Using recently-developed methodologies to detect jumps from high frequency price data, we estimate the size {{of positive and negative}} jumps and propose a methodology to estimate the size of jumps in the quadratic variation. The leverage effect is separated into continuous and <b>discontinuous</b> <b>effects,</b> and past volatility is separated into "good" and "bad", as well as into continuous and discontinuous risks. Using a long history of the S & P 500 price index, we find that the continuous leverage effect lasts about one week, while the <b>discontinuous</b> leverage <b>effect</b> disappears after one day. "Good" and "bad" continuous risks both characterize the volatility persistence, while "bad" jump risk is much more informative than "good" jump risk in forecasting future volatility.

An optimal risk-sharing agreement maximizes the expected utility of a representative member with respect to both the coverage and the (collective) action such that efficiency is restored. We study the sustainability of the optimal agreement as equilibrium in a repeated game with indefinite number of repetitions. When the optimal agreement is not enforceable, the equilibrium with free-riding emerges. We identify an interesting trade-off: welfare generated by the optimal risk-sharing agreement increases {{with the size of}} the pool, {{but at the same time}} the pool size must not be too large for collective choices to be self-enforcing.

40|$|Effective {{design of}} models {{requires}} simplification of different {{components of the}} system. For example, interactions of the system under scrutiny with its environment are modeled as idealized sources and sinks, and system behavior is derived from idealized interactions among constituent components. Some of the more detailed behavior is governed by small parameters, that produce continuous but complex nonlinear behaviors. These nonlinear continuous behaviors are often simplified to piecewise continuous forms, which then results in discontinuities at the temporal or spatial scale of interest. The resulting models are of a mixed continuous/discrete, or hybrid, nature. Physical systems theory based on continuity of power and conservation of energy is well understood. However, once <b>discontinuous</b> <b>effects</b> are included, these laws may be violated at the macroscopic level. The challenge is to endow hybrid models with semantics that do not violate the underlying physical nature of the system.

A qualitative empirical inquiry examines a ten-year process, in which a leading industry incumbent enters the service business by crafting a triadic value proposition.

The findings offer firms {{a better understanding of how}} to involve and collaborate with key actors to initiate discontinuous changes at the firm and network levels.

40|$|Rule-based models, such as {{decision}} trees, are {{ideally suited}} to represent <b>discontinuous</b> <b>effects</b> of independent variables on discrete choice behavior in transport or spatial systems. At the same time, however, the models require that continuous attributes, such as for example travel time and travel costs, are discretisized, which may decrease the sensitivity of predictions for policy measures that involve these attributes. To overcome this problem and combine the specific strengths of the rule-based and parametric modeling approaches, this paper introduces a hybrid approach. The so-called parametric action decision tree (PADT) replaces the conventional action-assignment rule of the decision tree by a logit model or any other parametric discrete choice model. The PADT includes alternative-specific constants to take the impact of leaf-node membership into account in addition to terms for the continuous attributes. As an illustration, we show how the approach {{can be used to}} incorporate travel-costs sensitivity in Albatross - a rule-based model of activity-travel choice. The results indicate that the enhanced, hybrid model can reproduce realistic ranges of price elasticities of travel demand. ...|$|R

There is continuous firm entry and exit depending on the competitive performance of the firms.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} the {{positive}} relationship between firm size and wages is investigated {{through the application of}} hierarchy theories. Many different explanations have been proposed for this relationship, but have met only limited success at best. The strongest finding to date is that unobserved ability is a significant factor. The question of interest here is why do wages increase as the size firm increases? Hierarchy theories take a different approach towards the analysis of firms in comparison to the alternate theories which have dominated previous investigations. As a result of their focus on the organisational relationships within a firms internal structure, hierarchy theories offer certain insights to the size-wage relationship which to date have been unnoticed. An empirical investigation into the size-wage differential incorporating structural considerations into an augmented wage equation offers strong support for the propositions of hierarchy theories. I find that half of the firm size effect for workers can be explained by controlling for some aspects of management structure, and that span of control has a <b>discontinuous</b> <b>effect</b> on wages.

40|$|The kin {{facilitation}} hypothesis attributes {{red grouse}} population cycles {{to the formation}} of spatial assemblages comprising related territory holders, and to a reduction in aggressiveness within such family clusters. This well-documented process is hypothesised to increase annual recruitment into the territorial population and the resulting increase in density leads to increased aggressiveness within the population. After some years, the cumulative increase in density and aggressiveness is assumed to lead to the breakdown of the family clusters, inflation of territorial requirements and consequent population decline. The territorial dynamics of a single family cluster constitute an important and little investigated part of the hypothesis. We develop a simple deterministic model {{to examine the effects of}} crowding and family size on the formation of a single family cluster. Analysis of two versions of the model, one containing no territory sharing between neighbouring relatives and one containing a territory-sharing response function developed elsewhere, indicates that a continuous increase in crowding has a <b>discontinuous</b> <b>effect</b> on the ability of the cluster to form. In the case of the model containing territory sharing this change is irreversible as, due to the occurrence of multiple equilibria, solutions are sensitive to initial conditions.

40|$|Introduction of the benthivorous {{common carp}} (Cyprinus carpio) has been {{identified}} as one of the main causes of loss of biodiversity and water clarity in numerous shallow lakes and ponds worldwide. Recent observations in experimental fish ponds suggest that the effect of carp on the ecosystem is catastrophic in the sense that a substantial impact occurs only when a critical carp density is exceeded. In search for an explanation, we analyzed a simple model of the interaction between benthivorous fish and their invertebrate benthic prey, and of sediment resuspension resulting from fish feeding behavior. Our results suggest that benthic prey populations should be only moderately depressed until predator fish abundance grows to a critical biomass at which benthos collapses due to overexploitation. This drop in prey density is predicted to result in a sharp increase in water turbidity due to an increase in prey search activity of the fish. For less eutrophic and deeper lakes, where benthos productivity and hence benthivorous fish carrying capacity are lower, water turbidity is predicted to be much less affected. The qualitative patterns are quite robust against assumptions on parameter values and correspond closely to the experimental results and data from lakes suggesting that the model may capture the essence of the mechanism causing a <b>discontinuous</b> <b>effect</b> of benthivorous fish on lake ecosystems...|$|E
