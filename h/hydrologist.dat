40|$|As <b>hydrologists</b> {{confront the}} future of water {{resources}} on a globalized, resource-scarce and human-impacted planet, the educational preparation of future generations of water scientists becomes increasingly important. Although hydrology inherits a tradition of teacher-centered direct instruction – based on lecture, reading and assignment formats – {{a growing body of}} knowledge derived from engineering education research suggests that modifications to these methods could firstly improve the quality of instruction from a student perspective, and secondly contribute to better professional preparation of <b>hydrologists,</b> in terms of their abilities to transfer knowledge to new contexts, to frame and solve novel problems, and to work collaboratively in uncertain environments. Here we review the theoretical background and empirical literature relating to adopting student-centered and inductive models of teaching and learning. Models of student-centered learning and their applications in engineering education are introduced by outlining the approaches used by several of the authors to introduce student-centered and inductive educational strategies into their university classrooms. Finally, the relative novelty of research on engineering instruction in general and hydrology in particular creates opportunities for new partnerships between education researchers and <b>hydrologists</b> to explore the discipline-specific needs of hydrology students and develop new approaches for instruction and professional preparation of <b>hydrologists...</b>|$|R

40|$|Final Report to the Hydrologic Research Laboratory of the National Weather Service Grant NA # 87 WHO 582 Traditional model {{calibration}} by National Weather Service (NWS) River Forecast Center (RFC) <b>hydrologists</b> involves a laborious and time -consuming manual estimation of numerous parameters. The National Weather Service River Forecasting System (NWSRFS), a software system {{used by the}} RFCs for hydrologic forecasting, includes an automatic optimization program (OPT 3) to aid in {{model calibration}}. The OPT 3 program is not used operationally {{by the majority of}} RFC <b>hydrologists</b> who perform calibration studies. Lack of success with the traditional single - step, single-criterion automatic calibration approach has left <b>hydrologists</b> more comfortable employing a manual step-by-step process to estimate parameters. This study develops a Multistep Automatic Calibration Scheme (MACS), utilizing OPT 3, for the river forecasting models used by the RFCs: the Sacramento Soil Moisture Accounting (SAC-SMA). and SNOW- 17 models. Sixteen parameters are calibrated in three steps, replicating the progression of manual calibration steps used by NWS <b>hydrologists.</b> MACS is developed by minimizing different objective functions for different parameters in a step -wise manner. Model runs are compared using the MACS optimized parameters and the manually estimated parameters for six basins in the North Central River Forecast Center (NCRFC) forecast area. Results demonstrate that the parameters obtained via the MACS procedure generally yield better model performance than those obtained by manual calibration. The MACS methodology is a time-saving approach that can provide prompt model forecasts for NWS watersheds...|$|R
