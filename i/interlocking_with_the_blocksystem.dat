50|$|Various {{indicator}} lights are included, {{one of which}} indicates that the truck is plugged in for charging. This is <b>interlocked</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> start circuit, disabling it if the Avcon paddle is inserted.|$|R
50|$|Similar {{to other}} picaresque novels, The Golden Ass {{features}} several shorter stories told by characters encountered by the protagonist. Some act as independent short stories, while others <b>interlock</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> original novel's plot developments.|$|R
50|$|Fabric is woven using a 'cut shuttle technique', {{in which}} {{shuttles}} <b>interlock</b> <b>with</b> {{one another to}} form foda kumbha in the weft direction. Shuttles on both sides <b>interlock</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> main shuttle for {{the main body of}} the fabic. By tie and die bandha technique, the foda kumbha pattern is copied for multiple productions.|$|R
5000|$|Knuckle: The hollow—typically circular—portion {{creating}} the joint of the hinge {{through which the}} pin is set. The knuckles of either leaf typically alternate and <b>interlock</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> pin passing through all of them. (aka. loop, joint, node or curl) ...|$|R
50|$|A wythe is a {{continuous}} vertical section of masonry one unit in thickness. A wythe may be independent of, or <b>interlocked</b> <b>with,</b> <b>the</b> adjoining wythe(s). A single wythe of brick {{that is not}} structural in nature {{is referred to as}} a veneer.|$|R
50|$|Compatibility {{problems}} have been experienced when mounting lenses with aperture transmission levers (e.g., SMC Takumars) on older bodies such as Zenit-E or Mamiya DTL. The aperture lug or a pin can <b>interlock</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> screwheads affixing the mount, which then impedes lens removal.|$|R
50|$|Sound-on-disc is a {{class of}} sound film {{processes}} using a phonograph or other disc to record or play back sound in sync with a motion picture. Early sound-on-disc systems used a mechanical <b>interlock</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> movie projector, while more recent systems use timecode.|$|R
50|$|During the 1960-61 season, <b>the</b> WIHL played <b>interlocking</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Okanagan Senior League. In January, {{during the}} middle of season, the Trail Smoke Eaters {{traveled}} to Europe for the 1961 World Ice Hockey Championships. The East Kootenay Rams, from Cranbrook, British Columbia were formed to replace them.|$|R
5000|$|A {{corresponding}} arrangement sometimes applied where {{permanent way}} maintenance {{was carried out}} by motorised trolley. Usually this used special [...] "occupation key" [...] instruments which were <b>interlocked</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> normal token instruments and provided at intermediate places where the trolley might be off-tracked (or stored overnight).|$|R
40|$|In his 2003 book, Grin {{established}} three {{prerequisites for}} a successful language policy: effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and democracy. Each of these is of considerable importance and <b>interlocks</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> other two. <b>With</b> any language policy, the actions involved must be verifiably effective – both to the language planners and policy maker...|$|R
5000|$|Nemesis Inferno at Thorpe Park is {{the only}} {{inverted}} coaster to feature interlocking corkscrews on the same track. (A set of duelling inverted coasters, Dragon Challenge at Universal Studios' Islands of Adventure, is another example. One corkscrew on the [...] "Chinese Fireball" [...] track <b>interlocks</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> corkscrew on [...] "Hungarian Horntail".) ...|$|R
50|$|Kirtlebridge {{station was}} nearly 17 miles (27 km) north of Carlisle, on the Caledonian Railway main line to Glasgow and Edinburgh. North of the {{passenger}} platforms there was a trailing (in the northbound direction) junction from the Solway Junction Railway, and a signalbox controlled the junction; the points there were <b>interlocked</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> signals.|$|R
40|$|We {{developed}} a content delivery system using a partially recongurable FPGA to securely distribute digital content on <b>the</b> Internet. <b>With</b> partial recongurability of a Xilinx Virtex-II Pro FPGA, the system provides an innovative single-chip solution for protecting digital content. In the system, a partial circuit must be down-loaded from a server {{to the client}} terminal to play content. Content will be played only when the downloaded circuit is correctly combined (= <b>interlocked)</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> circuit built in the terminal. Since each circuit has a unique I/O conguration, <b>the</b> downloaded circuit <b>interlocks</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> corresponding built-in circuit designed for a particular terminal. Thus, the interface of the circuit itself provides a novel authentication mechanism. This paper describes the detailed architecture {{of the system and}} clarify the feasibility and eectiveness of the system. In addition, we discuss a fail-safe mechanism and future work necessary for the practical application of the system. ...|$|R
5000|$|Interlocking method - two wefts are <b>interlocked</b> <b>with</b> {{each other}} where the colour change is required. The {{figuring}} weft {{is made of}} a number of coloured threads, weaving plain with warp threads and interlocked on either side <b>with</b> <b>the</b> grounds weft threads are invariably gold threads which <b>interlock</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> figure weft threads, thus forming the figure. This system of interlocking weaves, known as kadiyal, is done so that there are no extra floats {{on the back of the}} motif thus making the design nearly reversible.|$|R

5|$|In {{addition}} to the flag of Artsakh, the Armenian flag colors influenced {{the design of the}} Pan-Armenian Games flag. In the center of the light blue flag are six interlocking rings, derived from the Olympic rings. The sixth, orange-colored ring, <b>interlocks</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> blue and red rings, which symbolize Armenia. Above the rings is a flame in the colors of the Armenian flag.|$|R
50|$|In horses, sheep, and cattle, {{ejaculation}} {{lasts for}} several seconds or fractions of a second, but in boars, it can last for 10-30 minutes or 5-10 minutes. Ejaculation in boars is stimulated when the spiral-shaped glans penis <b>interlocks</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> female's cervix. A mature boar can produce 250-300 mL of semen during one ejaculation. In llamas and alpacas, ejaculation occurs continuously during copulation.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the flag of Nagorno-Karabakh, the Armenian flag colors influenced {{the design of the}} Pan-Armenian Games flag. In the center of the light blue flag are six interlocking rings, derived from the Olympic rings. The sixth, orange-colored ring, <b>interlocks</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> blue and red rings, which symbolize Armenia. Above the rings is a flame in the colors of the Armenian flag.|$|R

40|$|A {{heat shield}} for {{thermally}} insulating {{the leading edge}} of a wing of a spacecraft during ascent and reentry includes a plurality of rigid tiles. Each tile is formed with a pie-shaped element which <b>interlocks</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> complementarily-formed element of another tile. The combination of structure afforded by the pie-shaped elements substantially impedes hypersonic flow of any gases that might enter the gaps between tiles...|$|R
5000|$|Cinemascope 55 was {{originally}} intended to have a six-track stereo soundtrack. The premiere engagement of Carousel in New York did use one, recorded on magnetic film <b>interlocked</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> visual image, as with Cinerama. This proved too impractical, and all other engagements of Carousel had the standard four-track stereo soundtrack ("sounded" [...] on the actual film) as was then used in all CinemaScope releases.|$|R
50|$|The {{foundation}} of the dome consists of basalt, while the dome itself is made from sandstone brought from Rajasthan. The individual blocks of sandstone weigh 600-700 kg each and are kept in place due to the unique design of the bricks. Each of <b>the</b> bricks <b>interlock</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> ones adjacent to it and lime mortar is used to fill in any remaining gaps. The circumambulation path is laid in marble.|$|R
50|$|The GWR sited Tackley halt {{just north}} of a level {{crossing}} on the road linking Tackley <b>with</b> <b>the</b> village of Kirtlington. This had a crossing keeper on duty 24 {{hours a day and}} <b>the</b> gates were <b>interlocked</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> railway signalling system. However, the route later ceased to be a through road between the two villages, so the railway company withdrew the crossing keeper and redesignated the crossing to be operated by its users.|$|R
5000|$|After 1931, Fox's {{feature film}} {{production}} {{moved to a}} two-machine system that Western Electric developed from <b>the</b> RCA Photophone, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> advent of a light-valve invented by Edward C. Wente. In this new system, one camera shot the frames, and a second lens-less [...] "sound camera" [...] served as an optical recorder that was mechanically <b>interlocked</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> picture. Fox did continue to make Movietone Newsreels with single-system cameras due to their easy transport.|$|R
50|$|Another {{category}} of segmented turning called Open Segmented Turning {{is similar to}} ring construction but small gaps are left between the segments. Successive rings are offset so <b>the</b> segments <b>interlock</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> ring above and below. This type of segmentation seems very delicate and is somewhat transparent but it is generally quite strong. This concept was introduced by Yosh Sugiyama in the early 1980s. For example see the work of William Smith.|$|R
50|$|After {{boarding}} the train, {{it moves}} forward and begins {{going up the}} hill. At the top, it takes a narrow turn and takes a steep dive, does its first loop, makes a wide turn, does its second loop, does a 360 degree turn that <b>interlocks</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> second loop, makes a wide turn and does another 360 degree turn, takes another large drop as it makes a last wide turn, {{and returns to the}} station.|$|R
5000|$|The newer {{section is}} {{constructed}} in concrete, and largely faced by glass. On {{the ground floor}} are entrance doors. [...] Above this, the building is based around three cylinders. The largest of these starts at the first floor and rises through two storeys. It is cantilevered from a central column. To the left is a smaller cylinder, cantilevered from a separate column, <b>interlocking</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> larger cylinder. Inside the whole is a hollow column containing the stairs.|$|R
25|$|Throughout the Cenozoic Era, {{the large}} North American and South American {{continental}} plates moved westward from the Eurasian plate. This drift <b>interlocked</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> {{development of the}} Atlantic Ocean, trending north-south, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> North Pole in the small, nearly landlocked basin of the Arctic Ocean. The Isthmus of Panama developed at a convergent plate margin about 3 million years ago, and further separated oceanic circulation, closing the last strait, outside of the polar regions, that had connected the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.|$|R
50|$|The {{steam railcar}} was revived in 1902 when Dugald Drummond of the London & South Western Railway (L&SWR) built two for a branch line near Portsmouth.Steam railcars were {{introduced}} for two main reasons, either to compete <b>with</b> <b>the</b> new electric tramways that were abstracting traffic away in suburban areas or {{to provide an}} economic service on lightly used country branch lines. To allow for inexpensive low-level halts steps were provided, <b>interlocked</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> brakes so the train could not move with them extended.|$|R

50|$|Designed {{and opened}} as the freight-only Wapping Wharf Branch, {{the bridge was}} opened on 3 October 1906 by the Lady Mayoress, Mrs A.J.Smith. With both railway and road {{operations}} and bridge maintenance undertaken by the GWR, it opened on average ten times a day until February 1934. The controlling railway signals were <b>interlocked</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> signal boxes {{on either side of}} the river, making it impossible for signals to be cleared unless the bridge span was locked in the closed position.|$|R
50|$|There {{are five}} basic {{elements}} in <b>the</b> artwork together <b>with</b> <b>the</b> symbolic figures, which {{are subject to}} one's interpretation. The first is the unchained female figure, holding a book, her arms <b>interlocked</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> male figure. The male figure holds a pen and a torch. The flame of the torch carries the letters CvSU for Cavite State University. The child figure, in a dynamic pose atop the pillar behind the male & female figure, reaching out a dove, the universal symbol peace and freedom.|$|R
