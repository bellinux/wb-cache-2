The F-105 managed 27.5 air-to-air victories.

5|$|The {{development}} of distributed element filters was {{spurred on by}} the military need for radar and <b>electronic</b> <b>counter</b> measures during World WarII. Lumped element analogue filters had long before been developed but these new military systems operated at microwave frequencies and new filter designs were required. When the war ended, the technology found applications in the microwave links used by telephone companies and other organisations with large fixed-communication networks, such as television broadcasters. Nowadays the technology {{can be found in}} several mass-produced consumer items, such as the converters (figure 1 shows an example) used with satellite television dishes.|$|E

5|$|After launch, {{the missile}} was guided towards the target {{location}} {{as determined by}} the ship using a three-axis Attitude Reference Assembly (ATA) in an AN/DSQ-44 guidance section. The ATA was less accurate than a full-fledged inertial system, but good enough for Harpoon's range. For stabilization and control, the AGM-84A had four fixed cruciform wings (3x BSU-42/B, 1x BSU-43/B) and four movable BSU-44/B tail fins. The missile flew at a low cruise altitude and at a predetermined distance from the expected target position, its AN/DSQ-28 J-band active radar seeker in the nose was activated to acquire and lock on the target. The radar switch-on distance could be set to lower or higher values, the former requiring a more precisely-known target location but reducing the risk to be defeated by enemy <b>Electronic</b> <b>Counter</b> Measures (ECM).|$|E

25|$|The Skywarrior {{could carry}} up to 12,000lb (5,443kg) of {{weaponry}} in the fuselage bomb bay, which in later versions {{was used for}} sensor and camera equipment or additional fuel tanks. An AN/ASB-1A bomb-director system was initially installed, later replaced by a revised AN/ASB-7 with a slightly reshaped nose.

25|$|China's first {{completely}} indigenous {{anti-ship missile}} program was the YJ8 series. This missile externally appears {{similar to the}} French Exocet and American Harpoon, but is essentially a Chinese designed weapon system. The basic YJ8 appeared in the early 1980s, with a short range of 22 miles (40 or so kilometers). It was successful in its test launches however, hitting and sinking targets of up to 10,000 tons with a high hit probability. Unlike older designs, the YJ8 could attack targets at low altitudes to reduce its vulnerability to CIWS, and has greater <b>Electronic</b> <b>Counter</b> Measures (ECM) to prevent enemy jamming. The YJ8 entered widespread service, becoming the standard anti-ship missile on most second and third generation Chinese built warships, ranging from destroyers and frigates, to missile craft and submarines. The missile can also be launched from shore platforms and aircraft.|$|E
25|$|The early A-3 {{variants}} had {{a crew of}} three: pilot, bombardier/navigator (BN) and crewman/navigator (aka: third crewman). An unusual cockpit configuration {{was incorporated}} with the three crew sitting under a framed canopy. In the raised compartment, the pilot and bombardier/navigator sat in a side-by-side arrangement with the pilot's station {{on the port side}} having full flight controls. On initial variants, a third crew member, who also acted as a gunner for the twin tail-mounted 20mm cannons that briefly equipped the original bomber version of the A3D/A-3A (removed and replaced by ECM equipment), sat behind the pilot in an aft-facing seat. The third crewman station had the sextant for celestial navigation and the defensive <b>electronic</b> <b>counter</b> measures equipment.

40|$|Because of {{discrepancies}} between electronically and manually measured values of mean cell hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) encountered {{in studies of}} pathologic red cells. we studied the effect of cell water content on MCHC measurements by both methods. A series of red cell samples with varying water contents (54 %-i 64 % normal) were prepared from normal cells using the antibiotic nystatin. MCHC was then measured. using the microhematocrit centrifuge and three different <b>electronic</b> cell <b>counters</b> in common laboratory use. For MCHC values above 36 g/dl {{as measured by the}} spun hematocrit method, all three <b>electronic</b> <b>counters</b> underestimated the MCHC, with increasing error as the true MCHC increased.

25|$|In June 1940, a German {{prisoner}} of war was overheard boasting that the British would never find the Knickebein, {{even though it was}} under their noses. The details of the conversation were passed to an RAF Air Staff technical advisor, Dr. R. V. Jones, who started a search which discovered that Luftwaffe Lorenz receivers were more than blind-landing devices. Jones began a search for German beams; Avro Ansons of the Beam Approach Training Development Unit (BATDU) were flown up and down Britain fitted with a 30MHz receiver. Soon a beam was traced to Derby (which had been mentioned in Luftwaffe transmissions). The first jamming operations were carried out using requisitioned hospital electrocautery machines. The counter-operations were carried out by British <b>Electronic</b> <b>Counter</b> Measures (ECM) units under Wing Commander Edward Addison, No. 80 Wing RAF. The production of false radio navigation signals by re-transmitting the originals became known as Meaconing using masking beacons (meacons). Up to nine special transmitters directed their signals at the beams in a manner that subtly widened its path, making it harder for bomber crews to locate targets and confidence in the device was diminished by the time the Luftwaffe was ready to conduct big raids.|$|E
500|$|On the {{recommendation}} of the Secretary of the Air Force, Robert Seamans, President Richard Nixon appointed Brown to be Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force, effective 1 August 1973.

Without waiting for approval from the Secretary of Defense, he ordered two squadrons of F-4 Phantoms with <b>Electronic</b> <b>Counter</b> Measures capability be delivered to Israel, along with 100,000 tons of bombs and ammunition.

Nuclear armed Jaguars were instead assigned the [...] "Pre-Strategic" [...] role, to clear a path for the Strategic strike force. The AN-52 nuclear bomb was retired from service in September 1991, when the formerly nuclear-armed squadrons of Escadron de Chasse 7 then concentrated on conventional attack.

The aircraft were also fitted to operate the ASRAAM air-to-air missile; these weapons replaced the AIM-9 Sidewinder. HUG Phase 2 comprised four sub-elements and sought to improve the Hornets' combat performance. During Phase 2.1 the APG-65 radar was replaced with the improved AN/APG-73, and the aircraft were fitted with a secure voice encryption communications system as well as various updates to their computer systems. In HUG Phase 2.2, {{the most important element}} of the program, the Hornets were fitted with a Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing System, equipment needed to share data through the Link 16 network, a new countermeasures dispensing system and several upgrades to their cockpit displays.

In Phase 2.3, an improved <b>Electronic</b> <b>Counter</b> Measures system was fitted to the Hornets; the AN/ALR-2002 was originally selected, but proved unsuccessful. It was replaced by the ALR-67 Radar Warning Receiver in late 2006.
