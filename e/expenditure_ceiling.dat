Financial ceiling is used for the total expenditure size (with relative indicators) and for the individual expenditure headings (with absolute indicators). We designed EU budget models using the methods of financial ceiling, which reflect different total expenditures size (total <b>expenditure</b> <b>ceiling</b> within the range of 2 % EU GNI, 5 % EU GNI, 20 % EU GNI, 1 % EU GNI, and 1, 24 % EU GNI), and new heading structure for total <b>expenditure</b> <b>ceiling</b> of 1, 24 % EU GNI. We tried to design the new budgetary structure to reflect the Lisbon Strategy better than actual EU budget. We strengthened following expenditure headings: 1 a Competitiveness for growth and employment, 3 Citizenship, freedom, security and justice, and 4 EU as a global player. The growth of these headings is compensated by an expenditure decre- ase of the following headings: 2 Preservation and management of natural resources, especially the section of the market-related expenditure and direct payment, and 1 b Cohesion for growth and employment.

However, central and local governments provide both cash and in-kind goods.

The Swedish fiscal framework that was introduced after the banking crisis in the early 1990 s with <b>expenditure</b> <b>ceilings,</b> a top-down budget process, balanced budget requirement for local governments has played an important role. We show that the behavior of budget deficits has changed significantly recently, from a deficit bias to a surplus bias.

The discussions focused on minimizing short-term risks and on identifying the structural reform {{priorities for the}} next government. However, household indebtedness has continued to rise rapidly, recently surpassing the EU average; the authorities viewed the related risks to growth as contained. The discussions also centered on issues of fiscal policy implementation. Although unemployment has been halved since the mid- 1990 s, it remains high {{and a number of}} rigidities persist.

Iceland''s elevated macroeconomic volatility reinforces these tendencies, as large booms unleash greater fiscal pressures as well as procyclical revenue elasticities that magnify these underlying strains.

40|$|We {{propose a}} fiscal rule that {{fulfills}} a specific debt reduction objective while maintaining significant fiscal flexibility-two overarching concerns in Israel. Not unlike the Swiss "debt brake," the rule incorporates an error-correction mechanism (ECM) through which {{departure from the}} debt objective affects binding medium-run expenditure ceilings. Two variants of our ECM rule are shown to be superior to a comparable deficit rule in terms of attaining the debt objective and allowing for fiscal stabilization while supporting medium-term expenditure planning. Given its relative sophistication, a proper implementation of the ECM rule requires supportive fiscal institutions, including independent input and assessment.

40|$|The {{economic}} restructuring and expansion after the crisis reflected {{a combination of}} private sector initiative, solid macroeconomic management, including the shift from large deficits to significant surpluses of the general government, and structural reforms. High unemployment is one indication that structural rigidities continue to hamper Finland's output potential.

40|$|Achieving fiscal {{flexibility}} and safeguarding sustainability- {{the case of}} Slovakia Euro area entry calls for more fiscal flexibility to absorb cyclical shocks that cannot {{be dealt with by}} the common monetary policy. At the same time fiscal consolidation must not be put at risk, especially given rising ageing related costs. The current fiscal framework could be improved by introducing multi-year <b>expenditure</b> <b>ceilings</b> and by removing pro-cyclical elements in fiscal rules. An adjustment account that serves to register breaches of fiscal rules and eliminates them over time could help in coping with projection errors. To ensure long-term sustainability of public finances it is essential not to dilute the substantial improvements in the long-term balance of the defined-benefit pillar associated with past pension reforms. The government should consider making participation in the defined contribution pillar mandatory for new labour market entrants or, at the very least, make it the default option. For current workers the pillars should remain closed. Moreover, further parametric changes such as increasing the retirement age in line with life expectancy gains and reducing unsustainable elements in the pension formula woul...|$|R
40|$|According to the IMF and OECD, the Dutch fiscal {{framework}} is rather unique, and its {{design and implementation}} are highly recommendable. This paper describes this framework, its role in managing Dutch public expenditure, its history since 1814, the most recent national discussions {{and the role of}} the CPB. Major features of the Dutch {{fiscal framework}} are the trend-based fiscal framework with real net <b>expenditure</b> <b>ceilings</b> for the whole term of government, the role of independent organisations, like the CPB, Statistics Netherlands and the Netherlands Court of Audit, and the intermediary role of the national advisory group on budgetary principles. The framework reflects a long learning process, e. g. how to reconcile sound public finance, political pressures and the detailed requirements for managing public expenditure. There was not only progress, but also regression (e. g. the budgetary process became hectic and short-sighted in the seventies and early eighties) and old ideas becoming relevant again, e. g. taxes should be low and stable, each generation should bear its own burden and the reintroduction of cost-benefit analysis in public decision-making...|$|R
