5|$|Coffin did {{not enjoy}} being {{in the public eye}} and {{considered}} his job soliciting financial aid as begging for money, which he thought to be demeaning. He stated in his autobiography that he gladly gave up the position once a new leader for the organization was selected. Coffin became concerned about giving money freely to all blacks, some of whom he was believed {{would never be able to}} care for themselves unless adequate education and farms were provided. He also believed the Society should give their limited resources only to those who were best able to benefit from them. The Society continued to operate until 1870, the same year that black men were <b>guaranteed</b> <b>the</b> right to vote under the Fifteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.|$|E

5|$|Having {{learned about}} the block-booking studio system that almost <b>guaranteed</b> <b>the</b> studios huge profits, Cagney was {{determined}} to spread the wealth. He regularly sent money and goods to old friends from his neighborhood, {{though he did not}} generally make this known. His insistence on no more than four films a year was based on his having witnessed actors—even teenagers—regularly being worked 100 hours a week to turn out more films. This experience was an integral reason for his involvement in forming the Screen Actors Guild in 1933.|$|E
5|$|In 1833, Wilberforce's health {{declined}} {{further and}} {{he suffered a}} severe attack of influenza from which he never fully recovered. He made a final anti-slavery speech in April 1833 at a public meeting in Maidstone, Kent. The following month, the Whig government introduced the Bill for the Abolition of Slavery, formally saluting Wilberforce in the process. On 26 July 1833, Wilberforce heard of government concessions that <b>guaranteed</b> <b>the</b> passing of the Bill for the Abolition of Slavery. The following day he grew much weaker, and he died early {{on the morning of}} 29 July at his cousin's house in Cadogan Place, London.|$|E

5|$|Initial {{efforts at}} forcing the {{conversions}} of Spanish Muslims were started by Cardinal Cisneros, {{the archbishop of}} Toledo, who arrived in Granada {{in the autumn of}} 1499. In contrast to Granada's own archbishop Hernando de Talavera, who had friendly relations with the Muslim population and relied on a peaceful approach towards conversions, Cisneros adopted harsh and authoritarian measures. He sent uncooperative Muslims, especially noblemen, to prison where they were treated severely (including reports of torture) until they converted. Cisneros ignored warnings from his council that these methods might violate the Treaty of Granada, which <b>guaranteed</b> <b>the</b> Muslims freedom of religion. Instead, he intensified his efforts, and in December he wrote to Pope Alexander VI that he converted 3,000 Muslims in a single day.|$|E
5|$|It was {{not clear}} how the fight started, with reports of it either being started by Leeds fans {{throwing}} beer glasses and insulting the Turkish flag, or being started by Galatasaray fans throwing chairs. Police arrested Ali Umit Demir and three other men for the stabbings. Demir was later found guilty of murder {{and was sentenced to}} 15 years imprisonment. As a result of the stabbings, Leeds United banned Galatasaray fans from attending the second leg at Elland Road, claiming that the safety of fans could not be <b>guaranteed.</b> <b>The</b> ban was supported by UEFA and only 80 tickets were issued to Galatasaray for officials and representatives of the Turkish government.|$|E
5|$|Louis XIV was {{angered by}} Anna Maria Luisa's {{marriage}} to his sworn foe. Cosimo, after much coaxing, persuaded him otherwise. On 9 October 1691, France, England, Spain, and the United Provinces <b>guaranteed</b> <b>the</b> neutrality of the Tuscan port of Livorno. The Empire, meanwhile, {{was attempting to}} extract feudal dues from Cosimo, and ordering him to ally with Austria. The Grand Duke replied {{that if he did}} so France would send a naval fleet from Toulon to occupy his state; the Emperor reluctantly accepted this excuse. Tuscany was not alone in its feudal ties to the Empire: The rest of Italy was also bound to pay the Emperor, but at a much higher magnitude than Cosimo, who merely paid on his few undisputed Imperial fiefs.|$|E

5|$|Nasser also {{attempted}} to maintain {{oversight of the}} country's civil service {{to prevent it from}} inflating and consequently becoming a burden to the state. New laws provided workers with a minimum wage, profit shares, free education, free health care, reduced working hours, and encouragement to participate in management. Land reforms <b>guaranteed</b> <b>the</b> security of tenant farmers, promoted agricultural growth, and reduced rural poverty. As a result of the 1962 measures, government ownership of Egyptian business reached 51percent, and the National Union was renamed the Arab Socialist Union (ASU). With these measures came more domestic repression, as thousands of Islamists were imprisoned, including dozens of military officers. Nasser's tilt toward a Soviet-style system led his aides Boghdadi and Hussein el-Shafei to submit their resignations in protest.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, Petro {{managed to}} improve his status by marrying the {{extremely}} wealthy Tertulla, whose fortune <b>guaranteed</b> <b>the</b> upwards mobility of Petro's son Titus Flavius Sabinus I, Domitian's grandfather. Sabinus himself amassed further wealth and possible equestrian status through his services as tax collector in Asia and banker in Helvetia (modern Switzerland). By marrying Vespasia Polla he allied the Flavian family to the more prestigious gens Vespasia, ensuring the elevation of his sons Titus Flavius Sabinus II and Vespasian to senatorial rank.|$|E
5|$|One of Ford's {{greatest}} challenges {{was dealing with}} the continued Vietnam War. American offensive operations against North Vietnam had ended with the Paris Peace Accords, signed on January 27, 1973. The accords declared a cease fire across both North and South Vietnam, and required the release of American prisoners of war. The agreement <b>guaranteed</b> <b>the</b> territorial integrity of Vietnam and, like the Geneva Conference of 1954, called for national elections in the North and South.

Prior to 1611, there were several regional law systems in Scotland, most notably Udal law in Orkney and Shetland, based on old Norse law.

This was the first occasion that a Byzantine Emperor left his empire to plead for a foreign monarch's assistance. According to Louis's physician, Giovanni di Conversino, at {{his first meeting with}} Louis, the emperor refused to dismount and to take off his hat, which offended Louis. John V pledged that he would promote the union of the Byzantine Church with the Papacy, and Louis promised to send him help, but neither the emperor nor Louis fulfilled their promises.

With this funding seemingly <b>guaranteed,</b> <b>the</b> counties kept other taxes much lower than other counties in the state, increasing their dependence on the timber payments.
