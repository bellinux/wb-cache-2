5|$|Current {{understanding}} of gravity {{is based on}} Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity. Formulated in 1915, general relativity explains gravity {{in terms of the}} geometry of space and time, or spacetime. It is formulated in the language of classical physics developed by physicists such as Isaac Newton and James Clerk Maxwell. The other nongravitational forces are explained in the framework of quantum mechanics. Developed in the <b>first</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>twentieth</b> century by a number of different physicists, quantum mechanics provides a radically different way of describing physical phenomena based on probability.|$|E

5|$|In {{quantum field}} theory, one {{typically}} computes the probabilities of various physical events using {{the techniques of}} perturbation theory. Developed by Richard Feynman {{and others in the}} <b>first</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>twentieth</b> century, perturbative quantum field theory uses special diagrams called Feynman diagrams to organize computations. One imagines that these diagrams depict the paths of point-like particles and their interactions. Although this formalism is extremely useful for making predictions, these predictions are only possible when the strength of the interactions, the coupling constant, is small enough to reliably describe the theory as being close to a theory without interactions.|$|E
5|$|In the <b>first</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>twentieth</b> century, {{the city}} of Norfolk {{expanded}} its borders through annexation. In 1906, the city annexed the incorporated town of Berkley, making the city cross the Elizabeth River. In 1923, the city expanded to include Sewell's Point, Willoughby Spit, the town of Campostella, and the Ocean View area. The city included the Navy Base and miles of beach property fronting on Hampton Roads and the Chesapeake Bay. After a smaller annexation in 1959, and a 1988 land swap with Virginia Beach, the city assumed its current boundaries.|$|E
5|$|In the <b>first</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>twentieth</b> century, the {{extractive}} {{industries of}} the West of Scotland underwent a metamorphosis. The small pits were either worked out or were mechanised and merged. A similar process {{took place in}} the iron and steel production industries, and the medium scale iron works in many locations closed down. Many railway branch lines had been heavily dependent on business from the mineral industries, and could not be sustained when they had gone, but some continued as passenger lines where they served sizable communities.|$|E
50|$|The Norman south doorway is 11th century. The nave and chancel {{were also}} Norman, {{built in the}} 12th century, but the chancel was rebuilt in the Early English Gothic style in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 13th century. The priest's doorway and lancet windows survive from this time.

The most common forms in this period were plain and massive Neo-Romanesque buildings. Protestant examples included H. O. Tarbolton's Bangour Village Church (1924–30) and L. G. Thomson's Fairmilehead Church (1937). Roman Catholic examples included Reginald Fairlie's Immaculate Conception Church, Fort William (1933–34), and Archibald Macpherson's St Matthew, Rosewell (completed 1926).|$|E
5|$|It {{was during}} the <b>first</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>twentieth</b> century that the first women's fraternities were established. The {{university}} first admitted women to graduate programs in 1920, although undergraduate women were not allowed at the university until much later. With these graduate women came several female Greek organizations, referred to alternately as sororities or women's fraternities. The first sorority to establish a chapter at the university was Chi Omega, whose chapter was founded in 1927. A Kappa Delta chapter followed in 1932, and a chapter of Zeta Tau Alpha was established twenty years later in 1952.|$|E
5|$|The {{controversy}} surrounding the Rampart Dam project illustrated the growing {{shift in the}} environmental movement during the 1960s. Rather than becoming focused singularly on solely preserving {{the natural beauty of}} a particular landscape, as had inspired the creation of the U.S. National Park Service in the United States during the <b>first</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>twentieth</b> century, naturalists and environmentalists began to consider the human cost of development as well. Though opposition to Rampart was founded primarily on economic and natural grounds, it consequences for the Alaska Native population in the region reflected later concerns about industrial development in more urban areas.|$|E

In the <b>first</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>twentieth</b> century, pied currawongs were shot as they were considered pests of corn and strawberry crops, as well as assisting in {{the spread of the}} prickly pear. They were also shot on Lord Howe Island for attacking chickens. However, they are seen as beneficial in forestry as they consume phasmids, and also in agriculture for eating cocoons of the codling moth.|$|E
5|$|With the {{development}} of the particle accelerator during the <b>first</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>twentieth</b> century, physicists began to delve deeper into the properties of subatomic particles. The first successful attempt to accelerate electrons using electromagnetic induction was made in 1942 by Donald Kerst. His initial betatron reached energies of 2.3MeV, while subsequent betatrons achieved 300MeV. In 1947, synchrotron radiation was discovered with a 70MeV electron synchrotron at General Electric. This radiation was caused by the acceleration of electrons through a magnetic field as they moved near the speed of light.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, {{similarities}} between Pithecanthropus erectus (Java Man) and Sinanthropus pekinensis (Peking Man) led Ernst Mayr to rename both Homo erectus in 1950, placing them {{directly in the}} human evolutionary tree. To distinguish Java Man from other Homo erectus populations, some scientists began to regard it as a subspecies, Homo erectus erectus, in the 1970s. Other fossils found in the <b>first</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>twentieth</b> century in Java at Sangiran and Mojokerto, all older than those found by Dubois, are also {{considered part of the}} species Homo erectus. Estimated to be between 700,000 and 1,000,000 years old, {{at the time of their}} discovery the fossils of Java Man were the oldest hominin fossils ever found. The fossils of Java Man have been housed at the Naturalis in the Netherlands since 1900.|$|E

5|$|The same {{social forces}} that had built these resorts {{in the nineteenth}} century proved to be their undoing in the twentieth. Transport links {{continued}} to improve and it became possible to travel overseas quickly and affordably. The Belgian coast at Ostend became popular with Northern working-class tourists in the <b>first</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>twentieth</b> century, and the introduction of package holidays in the 1970s was the death of most Northern seaside resorts. Blackpool has maintained a focus on tourism, and {{remains one of the most}} visited towns in England, but visitor numbers are far below their peak and the town's economy has suffered – both employment rates and average earnings remain below the regional average.|$|E
5|$|Aspirin, in {{the form}} of leaves from the willow tree, has been used for its health effects for at least 2,400 years. In 1853, chemist Charles Frédéric Gerhardt treated sodium {{salicylate}} with acetyl chloride to produce acetylsalicylic acid for the first time. In {{the second half of the}} nineteenth century, other chemists established the chemical structure and came up with more efficient methods to make it. In 1897, scientists at Bayer began studying acetylsalicylic acid as a less-irritating replacement for common salicylate medicines. By 1899, Bayer had named the drug Aspirin and was selling it around the world. The word Aspirin was Bayer's brand name; however, their rights to the trademark were lost or sold in many countries. Aspirin's popularity grew over the <b>first</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>twentieth</b> century leading to competition between many brands and formulations.|$|E

5|$|A {{few years}} before Leo's paper, the first small papyrus {{fragment}} was found, and the <b>first</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>twentieth</b> century would see the publication of several other pieces which added significantly to the modern text of the Catalogue. Among these finds were important passages, the Catalogue of Suitors and Epithalamium of Peleus and Thetis for example, but few advanced the modern understanding of the work's overall structure. The appearance of the proem in 1956 actually led to a major misapprehension, for the list of gods found therein, beginning with Zeus and proceeding through the divine Heracles, led some {{to believe that the}} Catalogue was not organized in a strictly genealogical manner, but presented the unions of gods and heroines organized to some extent by amorous deity. Six years later, with the publication of the 28th part of the Oxyrhynchus Papyri, the corpus of papyrus witnesses to the fragmentary Hesiodic poems was nearly doubled, with the lion's share of these new texts belonging to the Catalogue. The new papyri proved once and for all that the poem was organized by genealogies of the great families in a way similar to the Bibliotheca, and that the poet's use of the ē' hoiē-formula was not a random method of introduction but an organizing tool within an overall structure.|$|E
5|$|In the 1930s, Cowell's student Lou Harrison {{utilized}} keyboard clusters {{in several}} {{works such as}} his Prelude for Grandpiano (1937). At least {{as far back as}} 1942, John Cage, who also studied under Cowell, began writing piano pieces with cluster chords; In the Name of the Holocaust, from December of that year, includes chromatic, diatonic, and pentatonic clusters. Olivier Messiaen's Vingt regards sur l'enfant Jésus (1944), often described as the most important solo piano piece of the <b>first</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>twentieth</b> century, employs clusters throughout. They would feature in numerous subsequent piano works, by a range of composers. Karlheinz Stockhausen's Klavierstück X (1961) makes bold, rhetorical use of chromatic clusters, scaled in seven degrees of width, from three to thirty-six semitones, as well as ascending and descending cluster arpeggios and cluster glissandi. Written two decades later, his Klavierstück XIII employs many of the same techniques, along with clusters that call for the pianist to sit down on the keyboard. George Crumb's Apparitions, Elegiac Songs, and Vocalises for Soprano and Amplified Piano (1979), a setting of verse by Walt Whitman, is filled with clusters, including an enormous one that introduces three of its sections. The piano part of the second movement of Joseph Schwantner's song cycle Magabunda (1983) has perhaps the single largest chord ever written for an individual instrument: all 88 notes on the keyboard.|$|E
