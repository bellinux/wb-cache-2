25|$|Lenz {{was unable}} to {{establish}} himself professionally in Riga. An attempt to make him director of the cathedral school came to nothing, as Herder refused {{to give him a}} reference. Nor did <b>he</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> greater success in St. Petersburg, where he lived from February to September 1780. He then took a position as a private tutor on an estate near Dorpat, then, after another stay in St. Petersburg, he went to Moscow in September 1781, where initially he stayed with the historian Friedrich Müller and learned Russian.|$|E
25|$|Robinson {{graduated}} from Cambridge University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1890. In 1891 and 1892, he played first-class cricket fairly regularly for Nottinghamshire, captaining the team on occasion, {{and for some}} amateur teams, though only in 1892 did <b>he</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> success: his two first-class scores of more than 50 both came in this season. His best innings was a score of 72 in the Nottinghamshire game against Middlesex when he put on 161 for the fifth wicket with Arthur Shrewsbury, who made 212. At {{the end of the}} 1892 English cricket season he joined Lord Hawke's XI cricket team in Ceylon and India in 1892–93, where he played in a single first-class match; he did not then appear at all in first-class cricket in 1893. He reappeared in Nottinghamshire matches in 1894 and occasionally kept wicket that season, {{and at the end of}} it he went on a second tour, this time with Lord Hawke to North America, where he played in two first-class cricket matches. He played occasionally in both 1895 and 1896 with no success.|$|E

[...] However, he had been offered the office of Premier in 1905, when it had seemed more desirable than it did now; would <b>he</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> interest? [...] The question was answered May 26, when the legislature reconvened. [...] Bulyea entered the house and {{announced that he had}} accepted Rutherford's resignation and that he had asked Sifton to form a government. [...] Sifton had accepted.|$|E

500|$|Choudary {{has been}} largely criticised by most UK newspapers, some of whom {{describe}} him as an extremist, or radical cleric or preacher. In January 2010, Guardian contributor Mehdi Hasan wrote: [...] "Is Choudary an Islamic scholar whose views merit attention or consideration? No. Has he studied under leading Islamic scholars? Nope. Does <b>he</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> Islamic qualifications or credentials? None whatsoever. So what gives him the right to pontificate on Islam, British Muslims or 'the hellfire'?

500|$|Speaking {{shortly after}} the overdubbing sessions, Spector {{said that he had}} asked whether any of the Beatles would like to help him produce the album, but none of them had wanted to. He also said that his hand was forced into {{remixing}} [...] "The Long and Winding Road" [...] due to the poor quality of Lennon's bass playing. Others agreed: in his book Revolution in the Head Beatles scholar Ian MacDonald wrote: [...] "The song was designed as a standard to be taken up by mainstream balladeers. [...] It features some atrocious bass-playing by Lennon, prodding clumsily around as if uncertain of the harmonies and making many comical mistakes. Lennon's crude bass playing on 'The Long and Winding Road,' though largely accidental, amounts to sabotage when presented as finished work." [...] Spector said that McCartney was being hypocritical in his criticism: [...] "Paul had no problem picking up the Academy Award for the Let It Be movie soundtrack, nor did <b>he</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> problem in using my arrangement of the string and horn and choir parts when he performed it during 25 years of touring on his own. If Paul wants to get into a pissing contest about it, he's got me mixed up with someone who gives a shit." ...|$|E
500|$|From a gate inside Clock Tower, Link and Tatl enter Clock Town {{while its}} {{population}} prepares for the town's annual Carnival of Time also {{scheduled to take}} place in three days. Together they learn that the Skull Kid is waiting {{at the top of the}} tower, which is only accessible during the eve of the carnival. After conditions are met, Link and Tatl arrive at the top of the Clock Tower to witness Tael hurriedly speak a riddle to them: [...] "Swamp. Mountain. Ocean. Canyon... hurry, the four who are there... bring them here!" [...] Link is unable to fight the Skull Kid, nor does <b>he</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> means to take the mask from him, but manages to get the Ocarina of Time back from his hands. After playing the [...] "Song of Time" [...] on the ocarina, Link and Tatl are brought backwards through time three days earlier — with the ocarina still in his possession and with both him and Tatl having complete memory of all that happened. Meeting with the Happy Mask Salesman again, he sees that Link has retrieved his ocarina, and hence teaches him the [...] "Song of Healing", which breaks the curse, returns Link to his human form and seals his Deku Scrub form into a mask which has the power to turn him back into a Deku Scrub if needed. After he finds out Link did not bring back the mask, he panics and explains that the mask conceals an evil, apocalyptic power that was once used by an ancient tribe in hexing rituals. The troubles caused by the mask were so great, that the ancient ones [...] "sealed the mask in shadow forever" [...] to prevent it from being misused. Link must then travel between the four cardinal regions of Termina: Woodfall, Snowhead, the Great Bay, and Ikana Canyon, for each region conceals one of the Four Giants who will be able, once reunited, to halt the moon's crashing. At the same time, each region has been struck with a terrible curse by the Skull Kid which plagues its inhabitants and seals away its giant. To lift the curse and free the giants, Link must enter a dungeon in each region and defeat its boss, after doing so, obtaining the power to summon the giant he has set free. To accomplish this, he uses the [...] "Song of Healing" [...] to create a mask that can turn him into a Goron from the spirit of a deceased Goron hero, and a mask that can turn him into a Zora from the spirit of a brave deceased Zora.|$|E

[...] After establishment of the Independent State of Croatia in April 1941 he and 10 others organized the Black Legion.
