25|$|The {{origins of}} the name Frensham come from 'Frena's ham'. Frena {{was the name of}} either a Danish Earl who was killed in the battle of Ashdown in the year 871, or of a Saxon who was driven south from Northumberland by the Danes in 993. The second part 'ham' means 'settlement', and is also <b>from</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> get the word 'home', so Frensham is 'Frena's settlement'.|$|E

500|$|Grunge {{attracted}} {{media attention}} in the United Kingdom after Pavitt and Poneman asked journalist Everett True from the British magazine Melody Maker to write {{an article on the}} local music scene. This exposure helped to make grunge known outside of the local area during the late 1980s and drew more people to local shows. The appeal of grunge to the music press was that it [...] "promised the return to a notion of a regional, authorial vision for American rock". Grunge's popularity in the underground music scene was such that bands began to move to Seattle and approximate the look and sound of the original grunge bands. Mudhoney's Steve Turner said, [...] "It was really bad. Pretend bands were popping up here, things weren't coming <b>from</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> were coming from." [...] As a reaction, many grunge bands diversified their sound, with Nirvana and Tad in particular creating more melodic songs. Dawn Anderson of the Seattle fanzine Backlash recalled that by 1990 many locals had tired of the hype surrounding the Seattle scene and hoped that media exposure had dissipated.|$|E
500|$|The show {{revolved}} around themes of evolution, {{as well as}} her paranoias represented on The Fame Monster. While developing the tour Gaga spoke about original sin and demons inside human beings; [...] "So we talked about growth, and that led us into this kind of scientific space, and we started talking about evolution and the evolution of humanity and how we begin as one thing, and we become another." [...] This theme of monsters and evolution played a part in the fashion for the tour, which according to Gaga was [...] "another level <b>from</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> were with the Fame Ball. [...] It's going to be a truly artistic experience that is going to take the form of the greatest post-apocalyptic house party that you've ever been to." [...] Although Gaga stated that she was inspired by the things she and West were doing with the Fame Kills tour, she concluded that {{she did not want to}} use any of the things that they had designed together. Later, she said that Fame Kills was [...] "the great lost tour", but confirmed that some of the elements of it were incorporated into The Monster Ball.|$|E

Erickson {{reportedly}} had several dreams about the crime after seeing an article in a newspaper and, a few days later, mentioned the murder to Ferguson asking him if he thought {{he may have been}} involved. [...] "It was crazy that someone had been murdered a couple blocks away <b>from</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> had been partying". said Erickson. Ferguson reassured him that he was not involved in the crime. Over time, Erickson says, he began to think more and more about the murders and {{about the fact that he}} could not remember that evening.|$|E

2500|$|Different Test playing {{nations had}} {{different}} point of view about this structural change in the way Test Cricket has been played. Bangladesh was the voice one to voice its concern in opposing this. [...] "We do not support this system," [...] Mahbubul Anam, Vice President, Bangladesh Cricket Board said. [...] "We believe that more we play against competitive sides, the better we will get. If we didn't play against better standard sides in ODIs, we wouldn't have come this far. We were the king of the jungle <b>from</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> achieved the Test status. We were given a reality check when we were promoted to the highest level. I feel that if we go backwards, our cricket will regress." [...] Should this happen, Bangladesh, who are ranked ninth, are likely to slip into Division Two and settle for lesser Tests against top cricketing nations.|$|E
2500|$|The band {{prepared}} about 18 {{songs for}} the album and {{teamed up with}} Swedish producers Mikael Nord Andersson an Martin Hansen. All the songs from the album are new written material, except four songs: [...] "Slave Me", [...] "No Limit", [...] "Turn You On" [...] and [...] "The Best Is Yet to Come" [...] which were written during the recording sessions for Unbreakable. During those sessions [...] "Turn You On" [...] had a different title; [...] "The Best Is Yet to Come" [...] was planned to be recorded for the album following Unbreakable, but when the band received an offer from Desmond Child to record [...] they kept the song and recorded it for this album. James Kottak in the interview for Sleaze Roxx explained: [...] "The first four songs that we wrote for this record were actually dark. I call them dark songs because they were probably too heavy compared to the stuff we've done in the past. They were in the vein of [...] "The Good Die Young", but you can't have too many songs like that. I love [...] "The Good Die Young" [...] but I'm glad the way things evolved took us away <b>from</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> were headed initially in the songwriting process. We also co-wrote with our producers, Martin Hansen and Mikael Andersson, who took the whole thing to an entirely different level".|$|E
2500|$|Firing and {{fighting}} began April 14 between Moslems and Armenians, {{which resulted in}} a number of casualties on both sides... the next morning April 15, a fresh outburst of smoke near the girls' school showed that we were threatened by fire...Mr. Maurer and I took a crowbar and an axe to the destroy the wooden porches, shutters and stairways of the houses between the fires and the girls' school...When I first climbed to the roofs near the flames armed Moslems appeared...When they understood that I was not firing on them, but had come to work against the flames, they lowered their rifles and assured me with many pledges that I might go unmolested...we repeatedly begged some Armenian young men who were lurking around the street corners shielded from the Moslem fire to put away their arms and come and save the school building... we came back to the school and asked for volunteers, Mr. Rogers came at once... We had thus worked a considerable time without being harmed by the Moslems when the Armenians {{on the other end of}} the street commenced firing on the houses where the looters were at work. Suddenly two shots rang out not more than eight yards <b>from</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> were working. Mr. Rogers...was mortally wounded...The other bullet hit Mr. Maurer...Immediately after these two shots several other bullets from the Moslems, who had fired them, whizzed past me...Both men passed peacefully away. They died as good soldiers of Jesus Christ.|$|E

2500|$|Despite {{concerns}} to the contrary, Glasberg denied that Ziva [...] "friend zoned" [...] Tony in the finale. He explained, [...] "It might not satisfy everyone out there, but I think we're getting there — she even reaches {{up with her}} hand and puts it very gently, and in a lovely way, on his shoulder before that kiss happens. I think there are gestures being made that have definitely advanced <b>from</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> were a year ago." [...] In response to complaints about {{the pace of the}} development, he said, [...] "There are a lot of fans {{who would like to see}} that story advance much faster than we're doing it, but I firmly believe a little goes a long way and there are ways to tease it and to flirt that are just as significant and just as meaningful." [...] He maintained, [...] "We made huge strides. Their relationship has evolved, has changed. They're a little more open with each other and a little more emotionally connected, certainly more than where we were at the beginning of the season. [...] may not be the big leap that a lot of people would like it to be, but I also feel like we're enjoying the pace at which this is happening. That's not to say we're not headed in the direction everyone would like to go, but I think we’re getting there. It's very complicated when two agents who are working together get into a relationship, and that's something that [...] would be very conscious of. So I think they would tread lightly, which is why, in theory, we're treading lightly and being very careful about the steps that we take." ...|$|E
