2500|$|Careful {{cleaning}} of stained glass {{can be a}} very effective means of improving its overall condition, because its appearance and function are so heavily dependent on its ability to transmit light. [...] Unfortunately, owing to the fragility of corroded glass, nearly all cleaning treatments can cause changes in the surface of the glass that can expedite corrosion rates, or damage delicate paint layers (Romich et al. 2000). [...] Thus, cleaning efforts should not necessarily be concerned with the complete removal of all encrustrations, but rather the careful thinning of these layers to a point where light can be transmitted through the glass at an acceptable level (Rauch 2004, 5). [...] The simplest cleaning can be performed using carefully applied <b>deionised</b> <b>water,</b> although other mechanical or chemical means are often necessary, and must always be done slowly, in a controlled and focused manner (Rauch 2004, 5-6; Vogel et al. 2007, 9-10). [...] Scalpels or a micro-jet process* can be used to gradually, mechanically thin out these encrustations layer by layer, in the lab. [...] Conversely, poultices or gel pads steeped in a non-ionic detergent or EDTA {{can be applied to the}} surface of the glass for long periods of time for “deep, focused cleaning” (Rauch 2004, 6). [...] With any of these methods, care must be taken to ensure the stability of painted layers, before treatment can take place. [...] In the event that these layers appear particularly friable, it is necessary to clean the glass delicately with cotton swabs, and in more extreme cases, manually affix the original paint lines to the surface, under a microscope, by applying small tiny drops of resin at specific points (Rauch 2004, 6; Vogel et al. 2007, 10). [...] Care should be taken not to remove any later over-painting without due consideration, as such layers may have historic value, in their own right (Rauch 2004, 7).|$|E

Published online: 10 Nov 2015 Cerium oxide nanoparticles (CeO 2 NPs) exhibit fast valence exchange between Ce(IV) and Ce(III) associated with oxygen storage and both pro and antioxidant activities have been reported in laboratory models. The reactivity of CeO 2 NPs once they are released into the aquatic environment is virtually unknown, but this is important to determine for assessing their environmental risk. Here, we show that amphipods (Corophium volutator) grown in marine sediments containing CeO 2 NPs showed a significant increase in oxidative damage compared to those grown in sediments without NPs and those containing large-sized (bulk) CeO 2 particles. There was no exposure effect on survival, but significant increases in single-strand DNA breaks, lipid peroxidation and superoxide dismutase activity were observed after a 10 -day exposure to 12. 5 [*]mg[*]L(- 1) CeO 2. Characterisation of the CeO 2 NPs dispersed in deionised or saline exposure waters revealed that more radicals were produced by CeO 2 NPs compared with bulk CeO 2. Electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) analysis revealed that both CeO 2 NPs were predominantly Ce(III) in saline <b>waters</b> compared to <b>deionised</b> <b>waters</b> where they were predominantly Ce(IV). In both types of medium, the bulk CeO 2 consisted mainly of Ce(IV). These results support a model whereby redox cycling of CeO 2 NPs between Ce(III) and Ce(IV) is enhanced in saline waters, leading to sublethal oxidative damage to tissues in our test organism.
