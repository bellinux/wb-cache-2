500|$|Randazza {{filed an}} appeal on June 5, 2007, and {{the matter was}} {{scheduled}} for a hearing before the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board. Acworth told Orlando Weekly he considered ceasing appeals when the mark had initially been rejected by the USPTO. He {{said he was not}} intending to be the adult industry's representative for First Amendment rights. Acworth stated to Orlando Weekly, [...] "Marc talked me into it. I'm not normally this sort of person. Marc thought he <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> shot at it. I'm really going on his advice.... I have no real agenda with it." ...|$|E
500|$|Originally, a [...] "time-consuming" [...] fight scene between Skinner and Krycek was {{supposed}} to take place. The scenes were cut because of time-constraints and budgetary reasons. However, Skinner's boxing match proved easy to stage. Mitch Pileggi, who had boxed competitively in college, went for [...] "refresher course" [...] at the Goosen Gym in Los Angeles. He later remarked, [...] "It makes me happy that some people will assume there was a stunt double in the ring. There wasn't! [...] We both <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> time". Location manager Ilt Jones called [...] "S.R. 819" [...] the [...] "damn parking lot episode". He was tasked with finding the variety of parking lots used in the episode. He later joked that, [...] "I started to wake up screaming about barriers and parking tickets and entrances and exit ramps".|$|E
500|$|After {{an almost}} four-month delay, Oblivion went gold on March 2, 2006 and was {{released}} for Microsoft Windows and Xbox 360 on March 21, 2006. Early rumors notwithstanding, Oblivion shipped on a single DVD-DL disc. One journalist voiced concern for the game's release date, as it was set in the same week as that of EA's [...] Hines dismissed the suggestion, saying, [...] "We {{tend to focus on}} what we can control and not worry about what we can't control. Given the level of interest and the number of pre-orders and so forth, we <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> idea we'd be just fine no matter what else was happening that week." [...] Oblivion was the first RPG title to be released for Microsoft's Xbox 360 console. In addition to the standard release version, a Collector's Edition was released for both Windows and Xbox 360 which includes the 112-page Pocket Guide to the Empire, a bonus DVD containing concept art, renders, and an approximately 45-minute-long documentary on the making of Oblivion, and a coin replica of the in-game currency of Tamriel. Its suggested release price of US$69.99 brought back [...] "memories of game prices circa the Nintendo 64" [...] for one Kotaku commentator. Some suggested that the included coin be used to create a [...] "garish piece of jewelry".|$|E

2500|$|Prior to the {{football}} matchup against the University of Colorado on November 12, 2005 a tornado touched down in Ames, Iowa and forced fans to either stand out {{in the parking lot}} and watch the storm or flee to shelter in Hilton Coliseum. [...] It created such an atmosphere that Iowa State was able to win over the favored Buffaloes 30–16. [...] When asked about the event, Colorado coach Gary Barnett said, [...] "I thought we <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> mascot. But when we showed up at Iowa State and they had a real tornado, that's the real deal." ...|$|E
2500|$|Early in 1938, Tytla {{animated}} Yen Sid, the old magician in [...] "The Sorcerer's Apprentice," [...] {{which would}} eventually become a segment in Fantasia (1940). However the character from Fantasia which Tytla {{is better known}} for is Chernabog, {{his own version of}} Crnobog the Black God, from the [...] "Night on Bald Mountain" [...] sequence. It is often said that Chernabog was based on actor Bela Lugosi, and Walt did bring him in to do live action reference for the character. However, Bill already <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> idea of {{what he wanted to do}} and did not like Bela's interpretation of the character. Instead he had Wilfred Jackson (who is credited for the music of Steamboat Willie) act out the part for him, and that is what he used as live action reference.|$|E
2500|$|The song {{has been}} {{performed}} by Doc Watson, who learned the song from his mother. Watson relates that [...] "Naomi Wise, a little orphan girl, was being {{brought up by}} Squire Adams, a gent who <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> name in {{the community as a}} morally decent human being. Omie, however, was seeing a ne'er-do-well named John Lewis, who never meant anything about anything serious, except some of his meanness. John Lewis courted the girl, seemingly until she became pregnant, and he decided that he'd get rid of her in some secret sort of way. He persuaded her to skip off with him and get married, then pushed her into the water and drowned her. Everyone knew that he had been mean to Omie, and when the body was taken out of the water, there was evidence that she had been beaten quite a lot." ...|$|E

2500|$|Zombie was {{responsible}} for writing all of the album's songs, while he initially worked with Nine Inch Nails member Charlie Clouser to produce the album. Zombie and Clouser opted for a more [...] "electronic" [...] sound for the record, using various music software while working on the project. Clouser claimed [...] "It was me and him with a computer, {{trying to figure out}} a direction we wanted to go in. We <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> idea of the kind of elements that would be included and an overall concept of the segues between songs and the musical interludes. We even started coming up with the core riffs for the album." [...] Early into the process of recording the album, Clouser became unable to work on the album due to other obligations; however, he recommended that Zombie worked with Scott Humphrey {{for the remainder of the}} album. Humphrey had previously worked with artists such as Metallica prior to producing the album. Due to his departure, the only song on the album produced by Clouser is [...] "Superbeast". Zombie stated that making the album was [...] "weird", and he didn't believe it would do well, as [...] "most debut solo records don't." ...|$|E
2500|$|Going {{into the}} 1960 game, Missouri (9–0, #1 nationally ranked) {{was known for}} their very stingy defense that, until giving up 19 points to Oklahoma {{the week before the}} Border War match-up, had not allowed a team to reach double digits all season. They boasted three shutouts. Their offense relied heavily on a wide sweep to the right with speedsters Norris Stevenson and Mel West in the backfield. It was run out of a {{combination}} of the T-formation and the old Single Wing. The term [...] "student body right" [...] is often used to describe the USC sweep play in the mid to late 1960s, but that phrase was created to describe Missouri's wide sweep. Kansas (6–2, ranked #11, with their 2 losses coming to #1 Syracuse, 14–7, and at #1 Iowa, 21–7) was making history that day by becoming the first team to face three #1 teams in the same season. Kansas <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> defense of their own, surrendering a mere 9.1 points per game with two shutouts that season. Kansas was also loaded in the backfield. Even without Coan, Kansas' backfield consisted of three future NFL draft picks: two-time All-American John Hadl at QB had led the Big 8 in all-purpose yardage as a RB in the 1959 season; halfback Curtis McClinton (three-time All-Big 8), and Doyle Schick at fullback.|$|E
