Therefore, in 1994, it was decided that the founding of a network of existing institutions would be more feasible. In its early years (1995-1999), the AUN focused mainly on the sharing of knowledge and experiences and on small-scale student and staff exchange. As from 1999, the collaborative activities became more complex with programmes like <b>joint</b> <b>curriculum</b> development, co-operation in ICT and the establishment of sub-networks.

Abstinence-only sex education has been implemented and supported for this cause to a large degree in Uganda, to some controversy.

40|$|Abstract Background Benefits {{of online}} {{learning}} in the health sector have been demonstrated in previous studies. We examined {{the potential benefits of}} a <b>joint</b> web-based <b>curriculum</b> on atopic eczema for health personnel. Methods Enrolled doctors and nurses had access to the curriculum for 8 weeks. After the course learners completed a questionnaire. Two dermatologists rated the quality of the submitted homework assignments. Based on data from the project's budget and the Norwegian Medical Association, we estimated the saved travel expenses. Results Eighty-eight learners (46 doctors) registered for the course. We received 55 questionnaires (response rate 63 %). Twenty-seven learners (31 %; 16 doctors, 11 nurses; χ 2 = 0. 03; P = 0. 87) used the discussion forum. We found no significant differences in the total questionnaire scores between doctors and nurses. The homework assignments were given an average score of 3. 6 for doctors and 3. 5 for nurses (P = 0. 8) by rater 1. Rater 2 scored 3. 9 and 3. 6 for doctors and nurses respectively (P = 0. 2). The break-even between travel/hotel expenses and course development costs occurred at 135 saved travel refund applications. Conclusions Doctors and nurses were equally satisfied with a joint web-based course on atopic eczema. The use of an online discussion forum was limited but similar between doctors and nurses. There {{were no significant differences in}} the quality of submitted homework assignments.

40|$|Abstract: Over the years, {{there have}} been {{numerous}} definitions of curriculum integration,where the curriculum is interwoven, connected, thematic, interdisciplinary multidisciplinary, correlated, linked and holistic. [1] Curriculum integration is based on both philosophy and practicality, drawing together knowledge, skills, attitudes and values from within or across subject areas to develop a more powerful understanding of key information. Curriculum integration is best done when components of the curriculum are connected and related in meaningful ways by both students and teachers. With the large uptake of SGs in education nowadays, one must consider SGs curriculum integration an issue at large since effectiveness of SGs use in training and education is getting more and more proponents. This paper looks at SGs curriculum integration issues from two perspectives- of the teacher connecting the content of the game and the learning outcomes into the whole educational context on the one hand, and of the researcher who sees the connection between the pedagogical state-of-art in SG and what realia can offer, on the other.

This article describes the development and evaluation of a telehealth intervention (TelePain) designed to improve access to pain specialist consultation in the military health system. The study uses a wait-list cluster controlled clinical trial to test: 1) effectiveness of the intervention, and 2) interviews to assess barriers and facilitators of the intervention implementation. The intervention involves a didactic presentation based on the <b>Joint</b> Pain Education <b>Curriculum</b> followed by patient case presentations and multi-disciplinary discussion via videoconference by clinicians working in the military health system. A panel of pain specialists representing pain medicine, internal medicine, anesthesiology, rehabilitation medicine, psychiatry, addiction medicine, health psychology, pharmacology, nursing, and complementary and integrative pain management provide pain management recommendations for each patient case.
