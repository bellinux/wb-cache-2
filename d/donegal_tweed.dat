50|$|Magee of Donegal is a {{clothing}} manufacturer and retailer based in Donegal, a town {{located in the}} south of County Donegal in the Province of Ulster in Ireland. The company is best known for their <b>Donegal</b> <b>tweed,</b> but also manufactures items from linen, wool and other materials. The company traces its origins to 1866, when the founder, John Magee, opened {{a clothing}} shop in Donegal Town. The company has supplied cloth for the uniforms of Ireland's state airline, Aer Lingus.|$|E
50|$|Donegal {{is known}} for the beauty of its textiles, whose unique woolen blends are made of short threads with tiny bits of color blended in for a heathered effect. Sometimes they are woven in a rustic {{herringbone}} format and other times in more of a box weave of varied colors. These weaves are known as <b>donegal</b> <b>tweeds</b> (with a small 'd') and are world renowned.|$|R
50|$|<b>Donegal</b> <b>tweed</b> is a handwoven tweed {{manufactured}} in County Donegal, Ireland. Donegal has for centuries been producing tweed from local {{materials in the}} making of caps, suits and vests. Sheep thrive in the hills and bogs of Donegal, and indigenous plants such as blackberries, fuchsia, gorse (whins), and moss provide dyes. Towards {{the end of the eighteenth}} century The Royal Linen Manufacturers of Ulster distributed approximately six thousand flax wheels for spinning wool and sixty looms for weaving to various Donegal homesteads. These machines helped establish the homespun tweed industry in nineteenth-century Donegal.|$|E
5000|$|London couturiers {{were kept}} busy {{creating}} gowns for debutantes and society matrons in the {{run up to}} the 1953 coronation of Queen Elizabeth and Mattli was among the so-called [...] "big ten" [...] designers photographed for lavish feature in Life. As Vogue highlighted, Mattli was perhaps more at home creating practical and wearable fashion focusing on understated fine detailing. [...] His autumn 1952 collection - singled out by one fashion commentator {{as one of the}} best of the season - included traditional <b>Donegal</b> <b>tweed</b> coats and slimline afternoon and cocktail dreses in boucl√© wool, silk jersey and lace.|$|E
5000|$|Its {{original}} designer was Digby Morton, who {{is credited}} with {{coming up with the}} name because, as he later said, British women wouldn't buy high-end fashion designs unless they sounded French. Morton's first women's collection for Lachasse introduced unusual colour combinations into <b>Donegal</b> <b>tweed</b> and reduced detailing so that the cut of the suit stood out. This transformed what had previously been considered staid country wear into something chic enough for town. As Alison Adburgham noted in 1964, Morton: [...] "made it fashionable to wear tweeds in London". [...] The elegantly cut daywear suit became one of the hallmarks of Lachasse and would be refined by later house designers.|$|E
50|$|Working {{first at}} Selfridges and Liberty, he {{then moved on}} to the fashion store Jay's as a sketch artist recreating Paris designs to appeal to London customers. By 1928, he'd become {{designer}} for couture house Gray Paulette & Shingleton - bringing both his own staff and his design flair. He suggested that it be rebranded as Lachasse - he later said this was because British women wouldn't accept any designs without a French-sounding name. Lachasse specialised in sportswear - a key 1920s trend - and Morton created a debut collection featuring <b>Donegal</b> <b>tweed</b> in what were then radical colour combinations such as bright greens and pale blues blended with traditional browns. This updated hitherto 'stuffy' country tweeds into smart town clothing, especially as Morton also streamlined the cut and tailoring to make the suits more fitted and fashionable. He left Lachasse after five years (he was succeeded by Hardy Amies) in order to set up his own couture house. He married the editor of Woman and Beauty Phyllis Panting (known professionally as Anne Seymour) in 1936.|$|E
