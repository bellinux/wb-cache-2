The study examined operational as well as system issues associated with the accommodation of the Soyuz for several potential configuration options. Operational issues considered include physical hardware clearances, worst case Soyuz departure paths, and impacts to baseline operations such as Pressurized Logistics Module (PLM) exchange, Space Station Remote Manipulator System (SSRMS) attachment, Extravehicular Activity (EVA), and automatic rendezvous and docking (AR&D). Systems impact analysis included determining differences between Soyuz interface requirements and SSF capabilities for the Electrical Power System (EPS), Thermal Control System (TCS), Communications and Tracking (C&T), Audio-Video Subsystem (A/V), Data Management System (DMS), and Environmental Control and Life Support System (ECLSS). Significant findings of this study have indicated that the current AV capability of the Soyuz will need to be increased to provide adequate <b>departure</b> <b>clearances</b> for a worst case escape from an uncontrolled SSF and that an interface element will be required to mate the Soyuz vehicles to station, provide for AR&D structural loads, and to house Soyuz-to-SSF system interfaces...|$|R

40|$|Airlines {{operating}} in the United States are required to operate under instrument flight rules (EFR). Typically, a clearance is issued via voice transmission from clearance delivery at the departing airport. In 1990, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) began deployment of the Pre-Departure Clearance (PDC) system at 30 U. S. airports. The PDC system utilizes aeronautical datalink and Aircraft Communication and Reporting System (ACARS) to transmit <b>departure</b> <b>clearances</b> directly to the pilot. An objective of the PDC system is to provide an immediate reduction in voice congestion over the clearance delivery frequency. Participating airports report that this objective has been met. However, preliminary analysis of 42 Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS) reports has revealed problems in PDC procedures and formatting which have caused errors in the proper execution of the clearance. It must be acknowledged that this technology, along with other advancements on the flightdeck, is adding more responsibility to the crew and increasing the opportunity for error. The present study uses these findings {{as a basis for}} further coding and analysis of an additional 82 reports obtained from an ASRS database search. These reports indicate that clearances are often amended or exceptions are added in order to accommodate local ATC facilities. However, the onboard ACARS is limited in its ability to emphasize or highlight these changes which has resulted in altitude and heading deviations along with increases in ATC workload. Furthermore, few participating airports require any type of PDC receipt confirmation. In fact, 35 % of all ASRS reports dealing with PDC's include failure to acquire the PDC at all. Consequently, this study examines pilots' suggestions contained in ASRS reports in order to develop recommendations to airlines and ATC facilities to help reduce the amount of incidents that occur...|$|R
40|$|The {{high number}} of runway incursions and weather {{dependent}} airport throughput occurrences {{has led to the}} development of an Advanced Surface Movement Guidance and Control System (A-SMGCS). A-SMGCSÃ¢ÂÂs basic levels 1 and 2 support tower air traffic controllers through the provision of a weather independent complete traffic situation and a basic runway safety net. Level 1 and 2 are already validated and operational at nearly 20 European airports. Instead of the higher-level services of an A-SMGCS, such as routing, <b>departure</b> management (DMAN), <b>clearance</b> conformance monitoring, data link communication (TAXI-CPDLC), and onboard guidance are not fully developed so far. The A-SMGCS manual (ICAO, 2004) describes operational, functional and performance requirements for all services but for the higher-level services they are rather immature or nonexistent. Therefore, EMMA 2 (European Airport Management by A-SMGCS, part two), an Integrated Project of the 6 th European framework programme, was launched in 2006. In EMMA 2 a holistic A-SMGCS concept, including the higher levels, was developed. This concept describes all A-SMGCS services including detailed procedures and operational requirements. It was tested in extensive simulation and field trials at four European airports (Prague Ruzyne, Milan Malpensa, Toulouse Blagnac and Paris Charles de Gaulle), using diverse technical solutions and test platforms.

50|$|The Tenerife airport {{disaster}} on 27 March 1977 was {{the collision}} of two Boeing 747 passenger aircraft on the runway of Los Rodeos Airport (now known as Tenerife North Airport) in Tenerife, Spain; killing 583 people, the crash is the deadliest accident in aviation history. All 248 aboard KLM flight 4805 were killed, as were 335 people on Pan Am flight 1736. In heavy fog on the airport's only runway, Veldhuyzen van Zanten took off without clearance and crashed {{into the top of}} the Pan Am aircraft, which was backtaxiing in the opposite direction under the direction of Air Traffic Control; the KLM's flight crew had been aware of Pan Am backtaxiing behind them on the same runway. The dense fog prevented visual confirmation; the KLM captain thought that Pan Am had cleared the runway, and started to take off without further clearance to do so. Veldhuyzen van Zanten's actions were the result of a number of other factors, including communication difficulties with Air Traffic Control (accents, and non-standard phraseology); he wrongly believed he had been given take off clearance when he received a <b>departure</b> <b>clearance,</b> and the Control Tower assumed that the KLM 747 remained stationary on the runway as instructed.|$|E
5000|$|Clearance {{delivery}} is {{the position that}} issues route clearances to aircraft, typically before they commence taxiing. These clearances contain details of the route that the aircraft is expected to fly after <b>departure.</b> <b>Clearance</b> delivery or, at busy airports, Ground Movement Planner (GMP) or Traffic Management Coordinator (TMC) will, if necessary, coordinate with the relevant radar centre or flow control unit to obtain releases for aircraft.

When weather or extremely high demand for a certain airport or airspace becomes a factor, there may be ground [...] "stops" [...] (or [...] "slot delays") or re-routes {{may be necessary to}} ensure the system does not get overloaded.

At some airports, clearance delivery also plans aircraft push-backs and engine starts, in which case it is known as the Ground Movement Planner (GMP): this position is particularly important at heavily congested airports to prevent taxiway and apron gridlock.|$|E
50|$|US Summary Comments on Draft Final Report of Aircraft Accident Flash Airlines flight 604, Boeing 737-300, SU-ZCF 3 January 2004, Red Sea near Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt.Quote {{from page}} 5 of 7:"Distraction. A {{few seconds before}} the captain called for the {{autopilot}} to be engaged, the aircraft's pitch began increasing and airspeed began decreasing. These deviations continued {{during and after the}} autopilot engagement/disengagement sequence. The captain ultimately allowed the airspeed to decrease to 35 knots below his commanded target airspeed of 220 knots and the climb pitch to reach 22°, which is 10° more than the standard climb pitch of about 12°. During this time, the captain also allowed the aircraft to enter a gradually steepening right bank, which was inconsistent with the flight crew's <b>departure</b> <b>clearance</b> to perform a climbing left turn. These pitch, airspeed and bank angle deviations indicated that the captain directed his attention away from monitoring the attitude indications during and after the autopilot disengagement process.Changes in the autoflight system's mode status offer the best explanation for the captain's distraction. The following changes occurred in the autoflight system's mode status shortly before the initiation of the right roll: (1) manual engagement of the autopilot, (2) automatic transition of roll guidance from heading select to control wheel steering-roll (CWS-R), (3) manual disengagement of the autopilot, and (4) manual reengagement of heading select for roll guidance. The transition to the CWS-R mode occurred in accordance with nominal system operation because the captain was not closely following the flight director guidance {{at the time of the}} autopilot engagement. The captain might not have expected the transition, and he might not have understood why it occurred. The captain was probably referring to the mode change from command mode to CWS-R when he stated, “see what the aircraft did?,” shortly after it occurred. The available evidence indicates that the unexpected mode change and the flight crew’s subsequent focus of attention on reestablishing roll guidance for the autoflight system were the most likely reasons for the captain’s distraction from monitoring the attitude".|$|E
40|$|Increased {{efficiency}} {{at airports}} {{is necessary to}} reduce delays and fuel consumption. Many of the busiest airports in the nation {{have at least one}} pair of closely spaced parallel runways (CSPRs), defined by a separation of less than 2500 ft, with one runway dedicated to arrivals and the other to departures. CSPRs experience a large decrease in capacity under instrument conditions because they can no longer operate independently. In order to mitigate this decrease in capacity and to increase efficiency, proposed herein is a departure regulator for runways so configured, along with a plan of study to investigate the effects of this regulator. The proposed departure regulator makes use of data from precision tracking systems such as ADS-B to issue automated or semi-automated departure clearances. Assuming sequential departure separations are sufficient for clearance, the regulator will automatically issue, or advise the controller to issue, the <b>departure</b> <b>clearance</b> as soon as the arrival on the adjacent runway has descended below its decision height. By issuing the <b>departure</b> <b>clearance</b> earlier, the departure regulator reduces the gap between a pair of arrivals that is required to clear a departure. By decreasing the gap, the regulator increases the number of opportunities where a <b>departure</b> <b>clearance</b> can be issued, given a particular arrival stream. A simulation models the effects of the regulator and quantifies the resulting increases in capacity. The simulation results indicate that all forms of the regulator would provide significant gains of between 14 % and 23 % in capacity over the current operating paradigm. The results also indicate that the capacity gains are greatest at high arrival rates. Therefore, implementation of the departure regulator could significantly decrease the congestion at many major airports during inclement weather.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the results of}} a mediumfidelity piloted flight deck simulation of future surface operations. Sixteen commercial transport pilots conducted time-based taxi-out operations at DFW airport under two Next Generation Airspace (NextGen) implementations. In the Limited NextGen implementation, time-based operations were defined by providing a taxi clearance with a commanded average speed to the pilot. In the Advanced NextGen implementation, advanced avionics allowed for time-based taxi operations to be conducted with speed error-nulling algorithms and arrival time information. Results indicated that the Advanced NextGen implementation substantially improved pilots ' ability to arrive at airport traffic flow points at the required time. An additional "tailored departure " (i. e., NextGen 4 -D <b>departure)</b> <b>clearance</b> verification task assessed the impact of time-based taxi on the departure phase of flight.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new {{departure}} pushback decision-support tool (DST) for airport ramp-tower controllers. It {{is based on}} NASA's Spot and Runway Departure Advisor (SARDA) collaborative decision-making concept, except with the modification that the gate releases now are controlled by tactical pushback (or gate-hold) advisories instead of strategic pre-assignments of target pushback times to individual departure flights. The proposed ramp DST relies on data exchange with the airport traffic control tower (ATCT) to coordinate pushbacks with the ATCT's flow-management intentions under current operational constraints, such as Traffic Management Initiative constraints. Airlines would benefit in reduced taxi delay and fuel burn. The concept was evaluated in a human-in-the-loop simulation experiment with current ramp-tower controllers at the Charlotte Douglas International Airport as participants. The {{results showed that the}} tool helped reduce taxi time by one minute per flight and overall departure flight fuel consumption by 10 - 12 % without reducing runway throughput. Expect <b>Departure</b> <b>Clearance</b> Time (EDCT) conformance also was improved when advisories were provided. These benefits were attained without increasing the ramp-tower controllers' workload. Additionally, the advisories reduced the ATCT controllers' workload...|$|E
40|$|Although {{tactical}} departure scheduling {{is commonly}} used in the National Airspace System, departure prediction uncertainty has {{a big impact on}} overall system performance. This paper analyzes the predictive accuracy of individual departure events as observed during operational evaluation of an integrated tactical departure scheduling system at DFW airport. Data from a major air carrier are utilized to improve pushback predictions as well as to notify surface automation of the actual flight pushback time from the gate. Surface event predictive accuracy is analyzed including ramp taxi time predictions, spot crossing duration, airport movement area taxi time predictions, <b>departure</b> <b>clearance</b> and departure runway roll time. Airborne predictive accuracy includes the transit time through the departure fix and to the meter point. Error estimates in the presence of departure uncertainty are used to identify and prioritize areas of future work. Specific improvements implemented during this research are discussed including modifications to airborne departure routing in DFW North Flow Configuration which reduced average error of flight time predictions from 300 seconds to less than 30 seconds.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this pilot-in-the-loop {{aircraft}} taxi simulation was to evaluate a NextGen concept for surface trajectory-based operations (STBO) in which air traffic control (ATC) issued taxi clearances with a required time of arrival (RTA) by Data Communications (DataComm). Flight deck avionics, driven by an error-nulling algorithm, displayed the speed needed to meet the RTA. To ensure robustness of the algorithm, the ability of 10 two-pilot crews to meet the RTA was tested in nine experimental trials representing a range of realistic conditions including a taxi route change, an RTA change, a <b>departure</b> <b>clearance</b> change, and a crossing traffic hold scenario. In some trials, these DataComm taxi clearances or clearance modifications were accompanied by preview information, in which the airport map display showed {{a preview of the}} proposed route changes, including the necessary speed to meet the RTA.

The SATS HVO procedures were developed to increase the rate of operations at non-towered, non-radar airports in near all-weather conditions. A key element of the design is the establishment of a volume of airspace around designated airports where pilots accept responsibility for self-separation. Flights operating at these airports, are given approach sequencing information computed by a ground based automated system. The SATS HVO validation experiment was conducted in the ATOL during the spring of 2004 in order to determine if a pilot can safely and proficiently fly an airplane while performing SATS HVO procedures. Comparative measures of flight path error, perceived workload and situation awareness were obtained for two types of scenarios.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the development of}} a decision support tool for unplanned maintenance of aircraft at ramp time during airport operations. Ramp time is the time between an aircraft arrival and its next <b>departure.</b> <b>Clearance</b> of an aircraft for flight is controlled by aviation regulations. Therefore decisions regarding maintenance are taken by engineers who have to comply with the regulations that are governed outside the organizational structure of the airline. Unplanned maintenance also often disrupts the normal operational scheduling and leads to significant costs. Therefore, the decision support tool must include the relevant aviation regulations, be capable of rescheduling to minimise disruption and be able to optimise solutions based on cost. In this project an aircraft schedule is used to demonstrate the procedures. An assumed fleet of six airplanes fly between three cities. Consultation with aviation experts ensured the size of the fleet and operations are realistic. A regulation database was developed based on the Master Minimum Equipment List (MMEL) for the aircraft, and a computer programme was developed to provide different options that comply with the regulations and take into account scheduling disruption and costs. In certain cases the regulations allow an aircraft to fly with some components inoperable so long as backup systems can perform the tasks. It is possible then to postpone the maintenance until the aircraft arrives at a properly equipped airport, or until a longer scheduled stopover reduces the disruption to operations. To address the engineering aspects of the project, maintenance of a single component that appears in the MMEL for the chosen aircraft is considered. To plan maintenance following a failure, the cause of the failure needs to be identified. Only then can the resources and time required to repair the defect be defined. The programme validation has confirmed it is able to balance different aspects of decisions related to unplanned aircraft ramp maintenance. Although the programme is based on an assumed fleet operation, the structure of the programme will allow it to be applied to other fleet and route configurations...|$|E
