Primarily arranged by the French and British governments, important members of the committee also included the Soviet Union, Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany. Ultimately, the committee <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>support</b> <b>of</b> 27 nations.|$|E

5|$|In 1960, Democrats {{nominated}} {{former governor}} Keen Johnson, then {{an executive with}} Reynolds Metals, to oppose Cooper's re-election bid. Cooper <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>support</b> <b>of</b> organized labor and benefitted from {{a large segment of}} Kentuckians who voted for Republican Richard M. Nixon over Democrat John F. Kennedy as a reaction against Kennedy's Catholicism in the 1960 presidential election.

There are few details about that war, only a brief note in the Anonymous Bulgarian Chronicle that Dan I died 23 September 1386 after being poisoned.

5|$|Kubah was {{inspired}} by Indonesian history, beginning in the 1940s and continuing until the 1980s. Following the national revolution from 1945 to 1949, the country was set {{in a state of}} political turmoil and abject poverty which became increasingly severe {{towards the end of the}} 1950s. By the early 1960s the PKI and other leftist parties <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>support</b> <b>of</b> President Sukarno, giving them greater power; PKI membership grew quickly in this period, aided by a hyperinflation and widespread poverty.|$|E
5|$|Once Barroso {{put forward}} the {{candidates}} {{for his next}} Commission, another opportunity to gain concessions arose.

5|$|Shortly after dawn, Reshef {{conducted}} a reconnaissance {{of the battlefield}} from a hilltop. He saw that the Egyptians {{had set up a}} strong blocking position defending the junction, composed of Egyptian tanks situated in hull-down positions and infantrymen in foxholes and the now-dry irrigation ditches of the Chinese Farm. The infantry were from the 16th Brigade's right-flank battalion and <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>support</b> <b>of</b> recoilless rifles, RPG-7s, and some manually guided AT-3 Sagger missiles.

5|$|The {{instigator}} was, again, {{his nephew}} Máel Coluim, who now <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>support</b> <b>of</b> Óengus of Moray. King Óengus was David's most powerful vassal, a man who, as grandson of King Lulach of Scotland, even {{had his own}} claim to the kingdom. The rebel Scots had advanced into Angus, where they were met by David's Mercian constable, Edward; a battle took place at Stracathro near Brechin. According to the Annals of Ulster, 1000 of Edward's army, and 4000 of Óengus' army – including Óengus himself – died.|$|E
5|$|The papal {{election}} of February 14, 1130 was convoked {{after the death}} of Pope Honorius II and resulted in a double election. Part of the cardinals, led by Cardinal-Chancellor Aymeric de la Chatre, elected Gregorio Papareschi as Pope Innocent II, but the rest of them refused to recognize him and elected Cardinal Pietro Pierleoni, who took the name of Anacletus II. Although Anacletus <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>support</b> <b>of</b> the majority of the cardinals, the Catholic Church considers Innocent II as the legitimate Pope, and Anacletus II as Antipope.|$|E
5|$|Victoria became second-in-line to the British throne in 1827; {{to prevent}} Victoria from being {{surrounded}} by commoners, King George IV named Lehzen a Baroness of the Kingdom of Hanover later that year. Lehzen encouraged the princess to become strong, informed, and independent from the Duchess and Conroy's influence, causing friction between the two and Lehzen. Attempts to remove the governess, who <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>support</b> <b>of</b> Victoria's uncles George IV, William IV, and Leopold I of Belgium, were unsuccessful.|$|E

5|$|Winchelsey held various benefices in England, {{and was the}} Chancellor of Oxford University {{before being}} elected to Canterbury in early 1293. Although he {{initially}} <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>support</b> <b>of</b> Edward I, Winchelsey later became a forceful opponent of the king. The archbishop was encouraged by the papacy to resist Edward's attempts to tax the clergy. Winchelsey was also an opponent of the king's treasurer Walter Langton {{as well as other}} clergy. On one occasion he rebuked an abbot so sternly that the abbot suffered a fatal heart attack.|$|E
5|$|By {{contrast}} with the tensions in England, in Normandy Henry had occasional disagreements with the Church but generally enjoyed very {{good relations with the}} Norman bishops. In Brittany, Henry <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>support</b> <b>of</b> the local church hierarchy and rarely intervened in clerical matters, except occasionally in order to cause difficulties for his rival Louis of France. Further south, however, the power of the dukes of Aquitaine over the local church was much less than in the north, and Henry's efforts to extend his influence over local appointments created tensions. During the disputed papal election of 1159, Henry, like Louis, supported Alexander III over his rival Victor IV.|$|E
5|$|Command, control, and {{coordination}} {{of the operation}} {{was going to be}} problematic, especially in the highly politicized South Vietnamese command structure, where the support of key political figures was of paramount importance in promotion to and retention of command positions. Lieutenant General Lê Nguyên Khang, the Vietnamese Marine Corps commander and protege of Vice President Nguyen Cao Ky, whose troops were scheduled to participate in the operation, actually outranked General Lãm, who <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>support</b> <b>of</b> President Nguyễn Văn Thiệu. The same situation applied to Lieutenant General Dư Quốc Đống, commander of ARVN Airborne forces also scheduled to participate in the operation. After the incursion began, both men remained in Saigon and delegated their command authority to junior officers rather than take orders from Lãm. This did not bode well for the success of the operation.|$|E
