5|$|Captain Kirk, {{played by}} John Belushi, orders {{the ship to}} outrun the strange craft. Unable to do so, he orders phasers and photon torpedoes to destroy the craft. Unfortunately, all of the ship's {{equipment}} fails for no reason and the Enterprises systems break down. Suddenly, Dr. Leonard McCoy, played by Dan Aykroyd, runs onto the bridge saying that the aliens are on the ship. <b>He</b> <b>says</b> <b>they</b> did not beam aboard, but merely walked {{out from behind the}} curtains.|$|E
5|$|Scully and Doggett {{arrive at}} the crime scene in Idaho and meet Detective Yale Abbott. <b>He</b> <b>says</b> <b>they</b> are less sure that the bites were made by a human and draws their {{attention}} to the strange footprint, believing that wild animals fed on the bodies after the fact. Scully points out {{that there is only one}} footprint, which looks ominously human, and that if it were left by an animal there would be more footprints leading to the bodies. Scully and Doggett check out the house and find prints leading upstairs and into the attic. Inside, Scully and Doggett find the missing fingers of the undertaker. They look like they have been regurgitated by something and the claw marks in the attic suggest something was hanging from the rafters. Meanwhile, elderly Mrs. McKesson is killed in her attic while looking at a photo album.|$|E

25|$|The film is {{dedicated}} to director/screenwriter Jim Sheridan's brother Frankie, who {{died at the age}} of ten. In The Making of in America, a featurette on the DVD release of the film, Sheridan explains Christy and Ariel are based on his daughters (and co-writers) Naomi and Kirsten. <b>He</b> <b>says</b> <b>they</b> wanted to make a film showing how people can learn to overcome their pain and live for the future instead of dwelling on the sadness of the past.|$|E
25|$|Thredson also {{suggests}} aversion therapy to Lana (Sarah Paulson), who thinks {{there is no}} cure for her homosexuality. <b>He</b> <b>says</b> <b>they</b> should try as it will increase her chances of a release. She relents, at first, but agrees and he shows her slides of nude women to aid her repulsion. He then brings in a male patient and has Lana touch both the patient and herself in sexual manner. She cannot complete this form of therapy. Thredson later promises Lana that he will take her with him when his asylum visit is over in a week.|$|E
6000|$|He {{wondered}} giddily how old she was--she {{seemed so}} much more self-possessed and experienced than himself. Why mustn't <b>he</b> <b>say</b> <b>they</b> had met? <b>He</b> remembered suddenly his mother's face; puzzled, hurt-looking, when she answered: [...] "Yes, they're relations, but we don't know them."

25|$|Herodotus and Strabo {{place them}} {{on the banks of}} the Thermodon, while Diodorus giving the account of Dionysius of Mitylene, who, on his part, drew on Thymoetas, states that before the Amazons of the Thermodon there were, much earlier in time, the Amazons of Libya.

Later, <b>he</b> <b>says,</b> <b>they</b> {{established}} Mitylene a little way beyond the Caïcus. Aeschylus, at Prometheus Bound, places the original home of the Amazons in the country about Lake Maeotis and they later moved to Themiscyra on the Thermodon. Homer tells that the Amazons were sought and found somewhere near Lycia.|$|E
25|$|The Child of Thorns, Chise's {{master and}} fiancé, once apprenticed to Master Lindenbaum. A being with both fae and human elements, his origins are a mystery. Known as the Thorn Sorcerer, the other faeries {{see him as}} an abomination, {{something}} he does not mind. Besides using glamour to hide his appearance, he can control and also turn himself into shadows, and when angry enough, he takes on a more monstrous form. He can even change his head to a human’s using magic. Despite claiming to lack human emotions, after some time caring for Chise he has slowly developed a true fondness for her. However, his innate lack of understanding certain human emotions makes Lindenbaum call him a child. He dislikes children. <b>He</b> <b>says</b> <b>they</b> do not have magic powers, but they are talented {{in being able to}} see the true nature of things, so sometimes he is found out. He is called “Pilum Murialis” by the wizards.|$|E

500|$|Bowden {{doubts that}} afterlife beliefs {{were a very}} {{important}} aspect of mystery cults and therefore thinks their resemblance to Christianity was small. Jaime Alvar, in contrast, argues that the mysteries of Isis, {{along with those of}} Mithras and Cybele, did involve beliefs about salvation and the afterlife that resembled those in Christianity. But, <b>he</b> <b>says,</b> <b>they</b> did not become similar by borrowing directly from each other, only by adapting in similar ways to the Greco-Roman religious environment. He says: [...] "Each cult found the materials it required in the common trough of current ideas. Each took what it needed and adapted these elements according to its overall drift and design." ...|$|E
500|$|Although Satin {{argues in}} New Age Politics that Americans {{need to change}} their {{consciousness}} and decentralize their institutions, in Radical Middle <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>they</b> can build a good society if they adopt and live by Four Key Values: maximize choices for all Americans, give every American a fair start, maximize every American's human potential, and help {{the peoples of the}} developing world. [...] Instead of finding those values in the writings of contemporary theorists, Satin says they are just new versions of the values that inspired 18th-century American revolutionaries: liberty, equality, pursuit-of-happiness, and fraternity, respectively. [...] He calls Benjamin Franklin the radical middle's favorite Founding Father, and says Franklin [...] "wanted us to invent a uniquely American politics that served ordinary people by creatively borrowing from all points of view." ...|$|E
500|$|Following their Edinburgh Fringe shows, {{the group}} enjoyed {{considerable}} {{success in the}} United Kingdom, making appearances on numerous BBC comedy shows. In 1988, the group was nominated for the Perrier Comedy Award for their performances at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. Fidler says that the British people were more receptive to their act at the time than Australians had been. [...] "The whole thing exploded for us when we got there, it was quite incredible. Within {{a very short time}} we were doing national television appearances in front of millions of people and playing these enormous shows," [...] <b>he</b> <b>says.</b> <b>They</b> played extensively in Canada, Germany, America and Britain, and finished their time in Britain by appearing on the final episode of the successful Friday Night Live. However, despite the acclaim they were receiving overseas, when they returned to Australia at the end of 1988 they remained unknown. Upon arriving in Melbourne, they struggled to gain a following and went back to busking on the streets.|$|E

500|$|On April 21, 2009, The Greencards {{released}} {{their fourth}} studio album, Fascination. Warner describes the album as [...] "their most focused" [...] work. On their previous albums, the three band members had individually put forward {{ideas for the}} music, until enough cohered into the finished work. For Fascination, <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>they</b> put aside their individual pride to create a stronger work. The years of touring experience The Greencards have accumulated since their earliest work has helped them, as well. Referring to when they formed the band, he said, [...] "We just played in Austin. We just wrote probably anything, which was the only stuff we knew, which {{was more of a}} traditional thing. But since then, we've had five or six years of touring, all of the experiences, all of the people you meet. We've been so fortunate to play at all of these festivals which have a really eclectic form of music styles." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Spaniards' {{fears were}} almost {{immediately}} confirmed. The chief had prepared an ambush for the [...] Spaniards {{as they approached}} the town.

2500|$|The Hebrew prophets had to {{struggle}} against the nature gods' popularity, and Jewish mythology reflects this struggle. In fact, some Jewish myths may have been consciously designed to reflect the conflict between paganism and a new uncompromising monotheism. In Psalm 82, God stands up in the Divine Council and condemns the pagan deities: although they are gods, <b>he</b> <b>says,</b> <b>they</b> will die like mortal men. Karen Armstrong interprets the creation myth of Genesis 1 [...] "as a poised, calm polemic against the old belligerent cosmogonies", particularly the Babylonian cosmogonic myth. The Babylonian Enûma Eliš describes the god Marduk earning kingship over the other gods, battling the monster Tiamat, and creating the world from her corpse.
