50|$|The architects, Tunbridge & Tunbridge, {{designed}} a {{first class brick}} and timber hotel of 36 bedrooms, estimated to cost between £8,000 and £9,000. The Tunbridge brothers (Walter Howard and Oliver Allan) had entered into partnership in Townsville in 1887, and soon developed a substantial North Queensland architectural practice with offices in Charters Towers and later Rockhampton. Tunbridge and Tunbridge designed many Townsville hotels, including the Metropole (1887), Victoria Park (1896), Lowth's (1897 - demolished), Victoria Bridge (1900 - demolished), Empire (1901), Sovereign (1904) and <b>Carriers</b> <b>Arms</b> (1906 - demolished).|$|R
50|$|There are {{records of}} inns in Watlington since the 15th century. In 1722 the town's market {{was listed as}} being held on a Saturday. By {{the end of the}} 18th century the town had six inns, all of which were bought up {{in the next few years}} by a local brewing family, the Haywards. The number of {{licensed}} premises increased until late in the 19th century when George Wilkinson, a Methodist bought six of them and closed them down. Today Watlington has three public houses: the <b>Carriers</b> <b>Arms,</b> The Chequers and The Fat Fox Inn.|$|R
50|$|There is an information, {{that in the}} 1930s, Poland sold three {{companies}} of Renault FTs to China, {{but it was only}} to cover up their sale to Republican Spain.

There were also some L3/33 or Fiat-Ansaldo CV-33 Italian tanks that were purchased, twenty L3/33 tankettes were sold to China. In 1937, 15 Panzer I tanks Ausf.

40|$|The {{bacterial}} Sox pathway is {{an important}} route for the oxidation of inorganic sulfur compounds. Intermediates in the Sox pathway are covalently attached to the heterodimeric carrier protein SoxYZ through conjugation to a cysteine on a protein swinging arm. We have investigated how the carrier protein shuttles intermediates between the enzymes of the Sox pathway using the interaction between SoxYZ and the enzyme SoxB as our model. The carrier protein and enzyme interact only weakly but we have trapped their complex using a `suicide enzyme’ strategy in which an engineered cysteine in the SoxB active site forms a disulfide bond with the incoming <b>carrier</b> <b>arm</b> cysteine. The structure of this trapped complex, together with calorimetric data, identifies sites of protein-protein interaction both {{at the entrance to}} the enzyme active site tunnel and at a second, distal, site. We find that the enzyme distinguishes between the substrate and product forms of the carrier protein through differences in their interaction kinetics and deduce that this behaviour arises from substrate-specific stabilization of a conformational change in the enzyme active site. Our analysis also suggests how the carrier arm-bound substrate group is able to out-compete the adjacent C-terminal carboxylate of the <b>carrier</b> <b>arm</b> for binding to the active site metal ions. We infer that similar principles underlie carrier protein interactions with other enzymes of the Sox pathway...|$|R
50|$|When {{surveyed}} in 1865, the cemetery was well {{outside the town}} boundaries. However, within a decade settlement was developing around the <b>Carriers</b> <b>Arms</b> Hotel at what had become known as Townsville's West End. By 1878 a soap works, foundry and commercial buildings, together with Frederick Ashton's estate, were located close to the burial site, now situated within the town boundaries. By the 1890s West End was a thriving suburb {{as well as a}} commercial and business centre, and a state school had been established on the reserve at the corner of Wilson and Flinders Street West, adjacent to the cemetery.|$|R

50|$|The Chinese warlord Zhang Zuolin {{introduced}} {{tanks to}} China. Surprised during the Northern Expedition by Chiang Kai-shek's National Revolutionary Army, he bought several Renault FT tanks armed with 37 mm guns from France in 1927. It is uncertain how these tanks {{were used in}} combat, but they were eventually captured by the Japanese and the Chinese Nationalists. The tanks captured by the Japanese army were deployed in the Kwantung Army and later used during the Mukden Incident. The Nationalists in the meantime also bought 36 FTs. However, they saw no action but were used mainly for training. Also about 6 or 10 Renault UE light armoured <b>carriers</b> <b>armed</b> with Browning MG were bought in France.|$|R

50|$|The {{physics of}} a {{passenger}} sitting properly in a chairlift {{do not require}} use of a restraining bar. If the chairlift stops suddenly (as from use of the system emergency brake), the <b>carrier's</b> <b>arm</b> connecting to the grip pivots smoothly forward—driven by the chair's inertia—and maintains friction (and seating angle) between the seat and passenger. The restraining bar is useful for children—who do not fit comfortably into adult sized chairs—as well as apprehensive passengers, {{and for those who}} are disinclined or unable to sit still. In addition, restraining bars with footrests reduce muscle fatigue from supporting the weight of a snowboard or skis, especially during long lift rides. The restraining bar is also useful in very strong wind and when the chair is coated by ice.|$|R

By 1878 the <b>Carrier</b> <b>Arms</b> Hotel, a soap and candle factory in Morris St, the Townsville Gas and Coke Co and the Townsville Brewery Co had sprang up in the new suburb.
