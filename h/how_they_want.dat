Summerhill, founded in the 1920s, is run as a children's democracy under Neill's educational philosophy of self-regulation, where kids choose whether to go to lessons and <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> to live freely without imposing on others. The school makes its rules at a weekly schoolwide meeting where students and teachers each have one vote alike. Neill discarded other pedagogies for one of the innate goodness of the child.|$|E

Although acknowledging that corporate domination of media and government stifle any significant change to this system, he sees reason for optimism, citing the historical examples of the social rejection of slavery as immoral, the advances in women's rights, and the forcing of government to justify invasions to illustrate how change is possible. He views violent revolution to overthrow a government as a last resort to be avoided if possible, citing the example of historical revolutions where the population's welfare has worsened {{as a result of the}} upheaval.|$|E

25|$|Near {{the end of}} the book, Jaypaw and Leafpool must go to WindClan to take Onestar {{a message}} from Firestar about not {{shedding}} unnecessary blood in a battle over something that may never happen, while Hollypaw convinces Mousefur and Firestar to do something to help RiverClan. When they arrive, WindClan queen Gorsetail's kits (Sedgekit, Thistlekit and Swallowkit) are missing and WindClan blames RiverClan, saying {{that there will be a}} battle if RiverClan does not return the kits. Jaypaw and Leafpool return to camp and Lionpaw tells his brother and sister about the tunnels, where he thinks the kits may have gone. They enter the caves, coincidentally meeting up with the WindClan apprentices Breezepaw and Heatherpaw, who share their motive for being there. Jaypaw is guided by the spirit of Fallen Leaves and the group finds the kits behind a boulder that blocked the tunnel. It starts raining and the tunnel floods, but Jaypaw figures a way out just in time and they return the kits, saving the Clans from an unnecessary battle. So Breezepaw, Heatherpaw, Jaypaw, Lionpaw, and Hollypaw return the kits back to WindClan and avert the battle. Then, once again, Lionpaw and Heatherpaw meet up again. They both talk about the future and <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> things to go.|$|E

As may be expected among people of different cultures, not all Native Americans or American Indians agree on its use. No single group naming convention has been accepted by all indigenous peoples.

About 500 people also gathered to protest on the Manezhnaya Square in Moscow and the same number of people on the Saint Isaac's Square in Saint Petersburg. On 2 March, about eleven protesters demonstrated in Yekaterinburg against Russian involvement, with some wrapped in the Ukrainian flag. Protests were also held in Chelyabinsk on the same day. The opposition to the military intervention was also expressed by rock musician Andrey Makarevich, who wrote in particular: [...] "You want war with Ukraine? It will not be the way it was with Abkhazia: the folks on the Maidan have been hardened and know what they are fighting for – for their country, their independence. [...] We have to live with them. Still neighborly. And preferably in friendship. But it's up to them <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> to live".

Four female middle distance track athletes (M = 16. 5 years) participated in in-depth, semi-structured interviews / consultations and reflective journaling over a period of 10 weeks using the Resonance Performance Model (RPM; Newburg, Kimiecik, Durand-Bush & Doell, 2002) as a structural framework. Results showed that the athletes followed a process of performance similar to expert performers but were challenged in articulating <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> to feel in their training and performances. However, over the intervention period, they became more conscious of <b>how</b> <b>they</b> felt during training and daily living. An awareness of <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> to feel was perceived to positively influence overall well-being and quality of track performance. Decision making behavior was also identified as being influenced by a heightened awareness of how each athlete wanted to feel...|$|R
