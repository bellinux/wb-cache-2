Blessed and thrice-blessed symptoms I discern of Master-Workers who are not vulgar men; who are Nobles, and begin {{to feel that they}} must act as such: all speed to these, they are England's hope at present!

And not imaginary commanding; no, it is real, incessantly practical. The evil passions of so many men (with the Devil in them, as in all of us) he has to vanquish; by manifold force of speech and of silence, to repress or evade.

For these his thousand men he has to provide raw-material, machinery, arrangement, houseroom; and ever at the week's end, wages by due sale.

6000|$|To {{those who}} know Knox by hearsay only, I believe the matter of this paper will be {{somewhat}} astonishing. For the <b>hard</b> <b>energy</b> {{of the man in}} all public matters has possessed the imagination of the world; he remains for posterity in certain traditional phrases, browbeating Queen Mary, or breaking beautiful carved work in abbeys and cathedrals, that had long smoked themselves out and were no more than sorry ruins, while he was still quietly teaching children in a country gentleman's family. It does not consist with the common acceptation of his character to fancy him much moved, except with anger. And yet the language of passion came to his pen as readily, whether it was a passion of denunciation against some of the abuses that vexed his righteous spirit, or of yearning for the society of an absent friend. He was vehement in affection, as in doctrine. I will not deny that there may have been, along with his vehemence, something shifty, and for the moment only; that, like many men, and many Scotsmen, he saw the world and his own heart, not so much under any very steady, equable light, as by extreme flashes of passion, true for the moment, but not true in the long-run. There does seem to me to be something of this traceable in the Reformer's utterances: precipitation and repentance, hardy speech and action somewhat circumspect, a strong tendency to see himself in a heroic light and to place a ready belief in the disposition of the moment. Withal he had considerable confidence in himself, and in the uprightness of his own disciplined emotions, underlying much sincere aspiration after spiritual humility. And it is this confidence that makes his intercourse with women so interesting to a modern. It would be easy, of course, to make fun of the whole affair, to picture him strutting vaingloriously among these inferior creatures, or compare a religious friendship in the sixteenth century with what was called, I think, a literary friendship in the eighteenth. But it is more just and profitable to recognise what there is sterling and human underneath all his theoretical affectations of superiority. Women, he has said in his [...] "First Blast," [...] are [...] "weak, frail, impatient, feeble, and foolish"; and yet it does not appear that he was himself any less dependent than other men upon the sympathy and affection of these weak, frail, impatient, feeble, and foolish creatures; it seems even {{as if he had been}} rather more dependent than most.|$|E

40|$|We {{report the}} few hundred second anti-correlated soft lags between soft and <b>hard</b> <b>energy</b> bands in the source GX 339 - 4 using RXTE observations. In one observation, anti-correlated soft lags were {{observed}} using the ISGRI/INTEGRAL <b>hard</b> <b>energy</b> band and the PCA/RXTE soft energy band light curves. The lags were observed when the source was in hard and soft intermediate states, i. e., in a steep power-law state. We {{found that the}} temporal and spectral properties were changed during the lag timescale. The anti-correlated soft lags are associated with spectral variability during which the geometry of the accretion disk is changed. The observed temporal and spectral variations are explained using the framework of truncated disk geometry. We found that during the lag timescale, the centroid frequency of quasi-periodic oscillation is decreased, the soft flux is decreased along {{with an increase in}} the hard flux, and the power-law index steepens together with a decrease in the disk normalization parameter. We argue that these changes could be explained if we assume that the hot corona condenses and forms a disk in the inner region of the accretion disk. The overall spectral and temporal changes support the truncated geometry of the accretion disk in the steep power-law state or in the intermediate state.

The variable blazar was observed at an intermediate optical state, and a well-covered multifrequency spectrum from radio to <b>hard</b> X-ray <b>energies</b> could be derived. The SED shows the typical two-hump shape, the signature of non-thermal synchrotron and inverse-Compton (IC) emission from a relativistic jet. By the significant exposure times of INTEGRAL and Chandra, the IC spectrum (0. 3 - 100 keV) was most accurately measured, showing - {{for the first time}} - a possible bending. A comparison of this 2006 SED to the one observed in 2003, also centered on an INTEGRAL observation, during an optical low-state, reveals the surprising fact that - despite a significant change at the high-energy synchrotron emission (near-IR/optical/UV) - the rest of the SED remains unchanged. In particular, the low-energy IC emission (X- and <b>hard</b> X-ray <b>energies)</b> remains the same as in 2003, proving that the two emission components do not vary simultaneously, and provides strong constraints on the modelling of the overall emission of 3 C 279.

The time profiles of all emissions exhibit fast time structures of 200 – 300 ms half power duration which appear in excess of a slower component varying on a typical time scale of 10 s. The amplitudes of both the slow and fast variations observed at 48 GHz are not proportional to those measured in the three <b>hard</b> X-ray <b>energy</b> bands. However, the fast time structures detected in both domains are well correlated and occur simultaneously within 64 ms, the time resolution of the hard X-ray data.

The upper bound was derived since a few years by general energy equipartition arguments on observed solar particle flare. The lower bound, the most compelling one for any guarantee neutrino signal, is derived by most recent records of hard Gamma bump due to solar flare on January 2005 (by neutral pion decay). The observed gamma flux reflects into a corresponding one for the neutrinos, almost one to one. Therefore we obtain minimal bounds already {{at the edge of}} present but quite within near future Megaton neutrino detectors.
