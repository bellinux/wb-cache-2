2500|$|... "Ah," [...] I {{grabbed him}} by <b>his</b> <b>bony</b> shoulders, [...] "when I look at you like this, I cannot but see Charles Thomson's {{portrait}} of you, which I saw last night at The Real Turner Prize Show in Shoreditch." [...] I emphasized the word [...] "real" [...] with all my might. [...] "Yes," [...] Nick beamed back at me without even blinking, [...] "I must see it!" ...|$|E
2500|$|His garb was in tatters, {{his beard}} an ugly stubble, his eyes bloodshot. [...] He had the gauntiness [...] in feature of a wasted consumptive. [...] He was shackled. [...] He {{was a man}} of stalwart frame, but <b>his</b> <b>bony</b> hands looked ugly. [...] He {{might as well have been}} three weeks out of the worldâ€¦For a time, in the prison yard, he acted like one who was an utter {{stranger}} to this earth.|$|E
60|$|Isaac {{stretched}} out his thin hand. <b>His</b> <b>bony</b> forefinger pointed menacingly towards Arnold.|$|E
60|$|The Cardinal-Archbishop {{straightened}} up <b>his</b> gaunt, <b>bony</b> frame.|$|R
60|$|Summerlee {{had risen}} and was {{standing}} by the window. <b>His</b> thin, <b>bony</b> hands were trembling with his emotion.|$|R
6000|$|... "These hands," [...] {{said the}} peddler, {{stretching}} forth <b>his</b> meager, <b>bony</b> fingers, [...] "have {{spent years in}} toil, but not a moment in pilfering." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{separated}} <b>his</b> <b>bony,</b> knotted {{hands clasped}} behind his back, {{to shake his}} finger at Martin.|$|E
60|$|Lethington {{raised his}} eyebrows, licked his thin lips, and rubbed <b>his</b> <b>bony</b> hands {{one in the}} other.|$|E
60|$|In hurried Mrs. Widdup, {{and stood}} by his chair. Mr. Coulson reached <b>his</b> <b>bony</b> hand and grasped her plump one.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't pester me!" [...] said Girdlestone, {{brushing}} the little Jew aside with <b>his</b> long, <b>bony</b> arm. [...] "Can I {{have a word}} with you, Fugger?" ...|$|R
6000|$|The man in {{the corner}} took two or three photos from his pocket-book and placed them before the young girl; then, {{pointing}} at them with <b>his</b> long <b>bony</b> finger-- ...|$|R
60|$|Alvina ran downstairs. Max {{opened the}} sitting-room door and stood {{watching}} {{at the sound}} of footsteps. <b>His</b> rather <b>bony</b> fists were clenched beneath his loose shirt-cuffs, his eyebrows tragically lifted.|$|R
60|$|Wilfred's {{face was}} turned away, but <b>his</b> <b>bony</b> hands turned {{blue and white}} as they {{tightened}} on the parapet of stone.|$|E
6000|$|... "Try um on he finger?" [...] {{interrupted}} the negro, stretching forth <b>his</b> <b>bony</b> knuckles. [...] "T'ink a Miss Sally's ring go on old Caesar finger?" ...|$|E
60|$|At {{this the}} Mexican shrugged <b>his</b> <b>bony</b> {{shoulders}} {{and called out}} again in Spanish, whereupon three other Mexicans showed themselves {{at the mouth of}} the cave.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Sir Henry, {{this is kind}} of you," [...] said he, putting <b>his</b> thin, <b>bony</b> {{hand out}} upon the coverlid, by way of making an attempt at an Englishman's usual greeting.|$|R
6000|$|Fleury goes. And {{that same}} night fifty-three priests are [...] "shipped" [...] in {{accordance}} with the orders of the proconsul, and Carrier, still rubbing <b>his</b> large <b>bony</b> hands contentedly together, exclaims with glee: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If so, young man, {{why did you}} not do it before?" [...] growled Martin, and {{stretching}} out <b>his</b> great, <b>bony</b> arm he gripped him by the collar and dragged him into the boat.|$|R
60|$|Soon <b>his</b> <b>bony</b> nag was hitched up to a buckboard, {{and away}} went the farmer {{in pursuit of}} the lad, who was doing his best to get away.|$|E
60|$|The Count {{scarcely}} heeded the interruption. His whole {{form was}} shaking with eagerness; <b>his</b> <b>bony,</b> white hands were outstretched toward his four listeners. For five-and-twenty {{years he had}} dreamed of this.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Of WHAT?' cried Ralph, on whom {{a sudden}} light {{appeared}} to break, for his eyes flashed and his frame trembled with agitation as he clutched Gride by <b>his</b> <b>bony</b> arm. 'Of what?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Just {{you wait}} here," [...] old McIntyre cried, {{plucking}} at his son's sleeve with <b>his</b> thin <b>bony</b> hand. [...] "Wait {{here and see}} it pass. Then we will watch what becomes of it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Watchee! watchee!" [...] echoed Big Otter, {{returning}} the hearty salutation {{as well as}} his tongue could manage it, and giving us each a powerful squeeze with <b>his</b> huge <b>bony</b> hand, which temporary exhaustion had not appreciably reduced in strength.|$|R
60|$|The wonder {{was that}} he had remembered me! I took <b>his</b> big, <b>bony</b> hand, which {{reminded}} me of Judge Whipple's. Yes, it was just as if I had been with him always, and he were still the gaunt country lawyer.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, sir," [...] {{returned}} Tom, stretching <b>his</b> <b>bony</b> fingers, as {{he surveyed}} his broad palm, by the little light that remained, [...] "though I am a peaceable man, I can be roused." ...|$|E
60|$|The Prime Minister's manner was subdued, but I {{could see}} by {{the gleam of}} his eyes and the twitchings of <b>his</b> <b>bony</b> hands that he shared the {{excitement}} of his young colleague.|$|E
60|$|He smiled weakly, and <b>his</b> <b>bony</b> fingers stole {{round the}} tumbler which stood by his side. She {{shook her head}} at him smiling, and crossed over to him. She was not afraid any more.|$|E
60|$|Captain Griffiths {{shook his}} head. He {{was a man}} {{considerably}} older than his questioner, with long, nervous face, and thick black hair streaked with grey. <b>His</b> fingers were <b>bony,</b> <b>his</b> complexion, for a soldier, curiously sallow, and notwithstanding his height, which was considerable, he was awkward, at times almost uncouth. His voice was hard and unsympathetic, and his contributions to the tea-table talk had been almost negligible.|$|R
60|$|And in {{her eyes}} the astute Frenchman, read, no doubt, {{something}} which caused him profound satisfaction, for, with a sarcastic smile, he took a delicate pinch of snuff, then, having dusted his dainty lace jabot, he rubbed <b>his</b> thin, <b>bony</b> hands contentedly together.|$|R
60|$|He still clasped Antonina to his side, {{but it was}} unconsciously. To all outward {{appearance}} he was helpless as his helpless child, when Ulpius slowly {{removed his}} grasp from their shoulders, separated them, and locking the hand of each in <b>his</b> cold, <b>bony</b> fingers, began to speak.|$|R
6000|$|A black frown {{settled down}} upon the hermit's face, and he clenched <b>his</b> <b>bony</b> hands with a vindictive energy. He stood a few moments, {{breathing}} fast and swallowing repeatedly, then said in a husky voice-- ...|$|E
60|$|Lu-don, {{the high}} priest, licked his thin lips and rubbed <b>his</b> <b>bony</b> white hands {{together}} in gratification as Pan-sat bore Jane Clayton into his presence and laid {{her on the}} floor of the chamber before him.|$|E
6000|$|... 'No, Mr. Traddles,' replied Uriah, {{resuming}} {{his official}} seat, and squeezing <b>his</b> <b>bony</b> hands, laid palm to palm between <b>his</b> <b>bony</b> knees. 'Not {{so much so}} as I could wish. But lawyers, sharks, and leeches, are not easily satisfied, you know! Not but what myself and Micawber have our hands pretty full, in general, on account of Mr. Wickfield's being hardly fit for any occupation, sir. But it's a pleasure {{as well as a}} duty, I am sure, to work for him. You've not been intimate with Mr. Wickfield, I think, Mr. Traddles? I believe I've only had the honour of seeing you once myself?' ...|$|E
60|$|BLOOM: (In tattered mocassins with a rusty fowlingpiece, tiptoeing, fingertipping, <b>his</b> haggard <b>bony</b> bearded face {{peering through}} the diamond panes, cries out) I see her! It's she! The first night at Mat Dillon's! But that dress, the green! And her hair is dyed gold and he...|$|R
60|$|No wonder {{his friends}} {{declared}} that he had surpassed himself. It had indeed been a glorious day, and the glow of satisfaction {{as much as the}} heat, caused the Public Prosecutors to mop <b>his</b> high, <b>bony</b> cranium before he had adjourned for the much-needed respite for refreshment.|$|R
60|$|Whatever it was, he {{had been}} saved from it by <b>his</b> wife, a <b>bony</b> lady of unprepossessing appearance, but {{irreproachable}} views.|$|R
