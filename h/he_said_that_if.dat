5|$|Following the {{decision}} by Fianna Fáil not to run their own candidate, there was speculation that some party members might be prepared to nominate an independent candidate.

25|$|On {{his death}} bed Umar vacillated to appoint his successor.

25|$|In 2016 Trimble {{supported}} the Leave {{side in the}} UK referendum on EU membership. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> he had ever had any doubts about the issue, 'his eight years on the EU Select Committees in the House of Lords – which scrutinise the EU’s operations – had convinced him {{of the need to}} cut ties with Brussels'.

25|$|In a {{press conference}} November 5, 2006, Chen rebutted the charges against his wife and members of his Presidential office. He said that Taiwan {{government}} offices advised him to prepare the receipts in such a fashion, and that {{after six years of}} doing so, it is strange that they would never mention an irregularity if it was not the right way to do it. He promised that all of the money actually went to diplomatic missions and did not go into any private pockets. Furthermore, he mentioned that when he took office, he thought his salary was so excessive that he cut his own salary in half, and that reduction is more than the amount he is accused of embezzling, so {{there is no need for}} him to take that money. In addition, <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> the charges against his wife were proven in a court of law just as they were charged, then he would at that time step down as President of the Republic of China.|$|E

25|$|An 18-hour {{standoff}} ensued {{during which}} time the police talked over the phone to Bryant, still calling himself Jamie. He requested a helicopter, saying {{that he wanted to}} be flown to a plane and then on to Adelaide, South Australia. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> the helicopter arrived, he would release Pears and only keep Noelene Martin. Bryant could see the movements of SOG officers, and continually demanded their retreat each time they began to approach the house. As he appeared to have excellent awareness of the events unfurling around him, despite the pitch black of night, the police believed he had some kind of visual aid device; none was ever found, however. A man was spotted on the roof of an adjacent building at one point, believed to be Bryant. Later in the night, the cordless phone Bryant was using began to run low on batteries. Police tried unsuccessfully to get him to return the phone to the charger, but it went dead and there were no further communications.|$|E

500|$|During the {{production}} of FutureSex/LoveSounds, Timberlake was interested in rock music. This inspiration was used in his approach in recording the songs, rather than in composing them. Timberlake reveals, [...] "I wanted to sing the song like a rock and roll singer, not an R singer." [...] On the influences he drew from, <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> Justified was [...] "characterized" [...] by Michael Jackson and Stevie Wonder, FutureSex/LoveSounds is more like David Bowie and Prince. Other influences include late INXS-frontman Michael Hutchence, Arcade Fire, David Byrne, The Killers, The Strokes, and Radiohead.|$|E
500|$|Crompton was {{the last}} witness. He said that Warne and Waugh's actions [...] "amounted to a breach of the players' {{contract}} in that it brought the game of cricket into disrepute". He {{said that it was}} normal for off-field disciplinary breaches to be dealt with in private, while the fallout of on-field incidents was made public. Compton parried Pakistani accusations that he had covered-up the affair. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> the matter had been made public, it would have been confused with bribery. The front-page headline in the Melbourne tabloid Herald Sun subsequently read [...] "MATCH FIX", accompanied by pictures of Warne and Waugh. The players responded that [...] "the matter [...] was in the hands of their lawyers". The next day, the headline read [...] "INNOCENT".|$|E
500|$|Policy options {{raised by}} Findlay {{included}} increasing the minimum wage, reintroduction of council house building, {{reduction in the}} use of the private sector in NHS Scotland, and allowing councils to set their own taxes to help reverse job losses within local government. He described himself as [...] "no machine politician", and called for a return to the [...] "timeless Labour values of community, solidarity, fairness and justice". <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> elected as leader, his 2016 election campaign would focus on tackling youth unemployment, the introduction of a living wage, and improvements to health and social care. He said that he wanted to make the party more [...] "autonomous" [...] by involving its members and trade unions to create a party that was [...] "more collective and co-operative in nature". He also expressed the desire to establish a public inquiry into the practice of trade union blacklisting. Among his plans for devolution was for Holyrood to have power over employment regulations to enable the creation of a Scottish Health and Safety Executive and the introduction of corporate culpable homicide legislation.|$|E

60|$|B., however, advised {{against the}} suggestion. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> even <b>if</b> {{it did not}} turn the man's head (and {{it was more than}} {{probable}} that it would), so much jealousy would be created against him among the other railway people throughout Germany, that his life would be made a misery to him.|$|R
500|$|David Jaffe, {{creator and}} Game Director of the {{original}} God of War, spoke with NowGamer prior to the first press announcement in late April. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> he had worked on Ascension, he would have incorporated three specific elements: different myths, a co-star, and [...] "look to the Zelda structure as a jumping off point".

In May 2012, Jaffe spoke with IGN about the multiplayer element: [...] "I think it looks cool. It looks like another great, impeccably executed Sony Santa Monica game", and added, [...] "If {{it turns out to be}} the case that the single player is watered down because of , then I think they have some justification.

500|$|Amid decolonisation and the Wind of Change, the Federation {{was looking}} ever more tenuous {{and the idea}} of [...] "no {{independence}} before majority rule" [...] was gaining considerable ground in British political circles. Harper called for Southern Rhodesia to abandon the Federation and [...] "go it alone". In June 1960 he and the Southern Rhodesian branch of the Dominion Party adopted the policy of [...] "Southern Rhodesia first", prompting strong protests from the party's Northern Rhodesian division; the Dominion Party splintered into separate Federal and territorial entities a month later. When black nationalist riots broke out in the townships in October 1960, Harper condemned the Southern Rhodesian Prime Minister Sir Edgar Whitehead and the governing United Federal Party (UFP) as too lenient on the protesters, and argued that giving concessions following political violence would make black Rhodesians believe that [...] "trouble pays dividends". Arguing against black representation in the Legislative Assembly, <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> there were black MPs [...] "they will share the restaurant with us and they will share the bars with us. We will be living cheek by jowl with them, and what sort of legislation can {{the people of this country}} expect when we ourselves are being conditioned to living cheek by jowl with Africans?" ...|$|E
500|$|In June 2014, Christopher Lennertz, who {{composed}} {{the music for}} the Agent Carter One-Shot, talked about potentially working on the series, saying, D'Esposito [...] "told me last summer at Comic-Con {{that there was a}} possibility this was going to become a series. And <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> {{he was going to be}} involved, he wanted me to be involved, too." [...] In September 2014, Lennertz officially signed on to compose for the series. Lennertz combined all the different style elements of the show in the music, such as mixing jazz and period elements, with orchestra and electronic elements. Lennertz said, the music is [...] "always done from a sense of being sort of in control and savvy and clever, rather than just being strong or just having a superpower or sort of being so much further along than anybody else physically. Part of it was just trying to make it that she's just smarter than everybody else. She's got such command over so many of these situations, and that was the most important thing was to give her that personality." [...] A soundtrack album for the first season was released on iTunes on December 11, 2015, and the single [...] "Whatcha Gonna Do (It's Up to You)" [...] from the second season was released on March 18, 2016.|$|E
