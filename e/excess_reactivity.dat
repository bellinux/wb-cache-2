25|$|SL-1 was {{constructed}} with a main central control rod that {{was capable of}} producing a very large <b>excess</b> <b>reactivity</b> if it were completely removed. The extra rod worth was {{in part due to}} the decision to load only 40 of the 59 fuel assemblies with nuclear fuel, thus making the prototype reactor core more active in the center. In normal operation control rods are withdrawn only enough to cause sufficient reactivity for a sustained nuclear reaction and power generation. In this accident, however, the reactivity addition was sufficient to take the reactor prompt critical within a time estimated at 3.6 milliseconds. That was too fast for the heat from the fuel to get through the aluminum cladding and boil enough water to fully stop the power growth {{in all parts of the}} core via negative moderator temperature and void feedback.|$|E
25|$|The fuel {{channels}} {{can only}} maintain criticality {{if they are}} mechanically sound. If {{the temperature of the}} fuel bundles increases {{to the point where they}} are mechanically unstable, their horizontal layout means they will bend under gravity, shifting the layout of the bundles and reducing the efficiency of the reactions. Because the original fuel arrangement is optimum for a chain reaction and the natural uranium fuel has little <b>excess</b> <b>reactivity,</b> any significant deformation will stop the inter-fuel pellet fission reaction. This will not stop heat production from fission product decay, which would continue to supply a considerable heat output. If this process further weakens the fuel bundles, they will eventually bend far enough to touch the calandria tube, allowing heat to be efficiently transferred into the moderator tank. The moderator vessel has a considerable thermal capability on its own, and is normally kept relatively cool.|$|E
2500|$|The {{incident}} {{caused this}} design {{to be abandoned}} and future reactors to be designed so that a single control rod removal {{would not have the}} ability to produce the very large <b>excess</b> <b>reactivity</b> which was possible with this design. Today this is known as the [...] "one stuck rod" [...] criterion and requires complete shutdown capability even with the most reactive rod stuck in the fully withdrawn position. The reduced <b>excess</b> <b>reactivity</b> limits the possible size and speed of the power surge. The [...] "one stuck rod" [...] criterion did not originate {{as a result of the}} SL-1 incident. It was, in fact, a hard and fast design criterion long before the SL-1, from the beginning of the Naval Reactors program, under the leadership of Admiral Hyman Rickover. This design criterion started with the USS Nautilus, and continued throughout subsequent submarine and surface ship designs, and with the Shippingport civilian nuclear plant. It continues to be a requirement for all US reactor designs to this day.|$|E
50|$|To control {{large amounts}} of <b>excess</b> fuel <b>reactivity</b> without control rods, {{burnable}} poisons are loaded into the core. Burnable poisons are materials that have a high neutron absorption cross section that are converted into materials of relatively low absorption cross section {{as the result of}} neutron absorption. Due to the burn-up of the poison material, the negative reactivity of the burnable poison decreases over core life. Ideally, these poisons should decrease their negative reactivity at the same rate that the fuel's <b>excess</b> positive <b>reactivity</b> is depleted. Fixed burnable poisons are generally used in the form of compounds of boron or gadolinium that are shaped into separate lattice pins or plates, or introduced as additives to the fuel. Since they can usually be distributed more uniformly than control rods, these poisons are less disruptive to the core's power distribution. Fixed burnable poisons may also be discretely loaded in specific locations in the core in order to shape or control flux profiles to prevent excessive flux and power peaking near certain regions of the reactor. Current practice however is to use fixed non-burnable poisons in this service.|$|R
2500|$|In QUADRISO {{particles}} a burnable neutron poison (europium oxide or {{erbium oxide}} or carbide) layer surrounds the fuel kernel of ordinary TRISO particles to better manage the <b>excess</b> of <b>reactivity.</b> If the core is equipped both with TRISO and QUADRISO fuels, at beginning of life neutrons do {{not reach the}} fuel of the QUADRISO particles because they are stopped by the burnable poison. After irradiation, the poison depletes and neutrons stream into the fuel kernel of QUADRISO particles inducing fission reactions. This mechanism compensates fuel depletion of ordinary TRISO fuel. In the generalized QUADRISO fuel concept the poison can eventually be mixed with the fuel kernel or the outer pyrocarbon. The QUADRISO [...] concept has been conceived at Argonne National Laboratory.|$|R
50|$|The fuel used in HTGRs is coated fuel {{particles}}, such as TRISO fuel particles. Coated fuel particles have fuel kernels, {{usually made}} of uranium dioxide, however, uranium carbide or uranium oxycarbide are also possibilities. Uranium oxycarbide combines uranium carbide with the uranium dioxide {{to reduce the}} oxygen stoichiometry. Less oxygen may lower the internal pressure in the TRISO particles caused by the formation of carbon monoxide, due to the oxidization of the porous carbon layer in the particle. The TRISO particles are either dispersed in a pebble for the pebble bed design or molded into compacts/rods that are then inserted into the hexagonal graphite blocks. The QUADRISO fuel concept conceived at Argonne National Laboratory {{has been used to}} better manage the <b>excess</b> of <b>reactivity.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{integral}} once-through {{steam generator}} was an advanced derivative of the steam generators used in older B&W designs (Davis Besse). Control rod drives do not penetrate the IRV, {{as in the}} light water reactors of today, but are instead wholly enclosed within the IRV. Burnable neutron absorbers within the fuel and control rod inventory are used to suppress hot <b>excess</b> <b>reactivity.</b> Cold shut-down was accomplished with control rod insertion (as in BWRs).|$|E
50|$|The SSR is self-controlling and no {{mechanical}} control is required. There is zero <b>excess</b> <b>reactivity</b> at any time; i.e. {{the rate at}} which fission generates heat matches {{the rate at which}} heat is being removed. This is made possible by the combination of a high negative temperature coefficient of reactivity and the ability to continually extract heat from the fuel tubes. As heat is taken out of the system the temperature drops, causing the reactivity to go up. When the reactor heats up the reactivity goes down, making it stable at all times.|$|E
50|$|During {{operation}} of a reactor the amount of fuel contained in the core decreases monotonically. If the reactor is to operate {{for a long period}} of time, fuel in excess of that needed for exact criticality must be added when the reactor is fueled. The positive reactivity due to the excess fuel must be balanced with negative reactivity from neutron-absorbing material. Movable control rods containing neutron-absorbing material is one method, but control rods alone to balance the <b>excess</b> <b>reactivity</b> may be impractical for a particular core design as there may be insufficient room for the rods or their mechanisms, namely in submarines, where space is particularly at a premium.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the other}} two incidents, the reactor plants failed due to errors during a {{maintenance}} shutdown that {{was caused by the}} rapid and uncontrolled removal of at least one control rod. The SL-1 was a prototype reactor intended for use by the US Army in remote polar locations. At the SL-1 plant in 1961, the reactor was brought from shutdown to prompt critical state by manually extracting the central control rod too far. As the water in the core quickly converted to steam and expanded, the 26,000 lb reactor vessel jumped 9 ft, leaving impressions in the ceiling above. All three men performing the maintenance procedure died from injuries. 1,100 curies of fission products were released as parts of the core were expelled. It took 2 years to investigate the accident and clean up the site. The <b>excess</b> prompt <b>reactivity</b> of the SL-1 core was calculated in a 1962 report: ...|$|R
5000|$|The core {{consists}} of a graphite cylinder with a radius of 4 m and a height of 10 m which includes 1 m axial reflectors at top and bottom. The cylinder allocates three or four concentric rings, each of 36 hexagonal blocks with an interstitial gap of 0.2 cm. Each hexagonal block contains 108 helium coolant channels and 216 fuel pins. Each fuel pin contains a random lattice of TRISO particles dispersed into a graphite matrix. The reactor exhibits a thermal spectrum with a peak located at about 0.2 eV.

50|$|The AWHR is an {{innovation}} in renewable energy safety {{as it will}} limit the use of fissile uranium-235 to breeding fissile uranium-233 from fertile thorium-232. The extraction of nuclear energy from the 90th element Thorium {{is said to have}} more energy than the world's oil, coal, and uranium combined. The AHWR has safety features that distinguish it from conventional lightwater nuclear reactors. Some of these features consist of: strong safety systems, reduction of heat from core through a built in cooling system, multiple shutdown systems, and a fail-safe procedure that consist of a poison that shuts down the system {{in the case of a}} technical failure (FBR). The potential threat scientists try to avoid in reactors is the buildup of heat because nuclear energy escalates when it reacts with, high temperatures, high pressures, and chemical reactions. The AHWR has features that helps reduce the probability of this occurrence through the: negative reactivity coefficients, low power density, low <b>excess</b> <b>reactivity</b> in the core, and proper selection of material, attributes built in.|$|E
40|$|Neutron {{absorbers}} are elements {{with a high}} {{neutron capture}} cross section that are employed at nuclear reactors to control <b>excess</b> fuel <b>reactivity.</b> If these absorbers are converted into materials of relatively low absorption cross section {{as the result of}} neutron absorption, they consume during the reactor core life and so are called burnable. These elements can be distributed inside an oxide ceramic that is stable under irradiation and thus called inert. Cubic zirconium oxide is one of the preferred materials to be used as inert matrix. It is stable under irradiation, experiments very low swelling, and is isomorphic to uranium oxide. The cubic phase is stabilized by adding small amounts of dopants like Dy 2 O 3 and Gd 2 O 3. As both dysprosium and gadolinium have a high neutron cross section, they are good candidates to prepare burnable neutron absorbers. Pyrochlores, like Gd 2 Zr 2 O 7 and Dy 2 Ti 2 O 7, allow the solid solution of a large quantity of elements besides being stable under irradiation. These characteristics make them also useful for safe storage of nuclear wastes. We present a preliminary study of the thermal analysis of different compositions in the systems Gd 2 O 3 -ZrO 2 and Dy 2 O 3 -TiO 2, investigating the feasibility to obtain oxide ceramics useful for the nuclear industry...|$|R
40|$|The use {{of thorium}} in {{pressurized}} water reactor fuel assemblies is investigated in this paper. The novelty of the reported work is to study a fuel design primarily intended to control the <b>excess</b> of <b>reactivity</b> at beginning of life, and flatten the intra-assembly power distribution rather than converting fertile Th- 232 into fissile U- 233. The fuel assembly is a traditional 17 x 17 {{pressurized water reactor}} fuel design. The majority of the fuel pins contain a mixture of uranium and thorium oxides, while a few fuel pins contain a mixture between uranium and gadolinium oxides. The calculation were performed by two-dimensional transport calculations with the Studsvik Scandpower CASMO- 4 E code {{in order to determine}} the main neutronic properties of the new fuel design, compared with the traditional uranium-based fuel assembly containing gadolinium used as reference. The majority of the neutronic properties of the uranium-thorium-based fuel assembly were similar to the reference fuel assembly. The Doppler and the moderator temperature coefficients of reactivity were found to be appreciably more negative in the uranium-thorium-based design, but still within acceptable limits. One advantage of this new uranium-thorium-based design is a reduction of the pin peak power at beginning of life, because of smaller amount of gadolinium being used. This is important from an operational and safety viewpoint, since the margin to departure from nucleate boiling becomes larger. Consequently, this new type of thorium-based fuel assembly shows advantageous properties for use in power-uprated cores...|$|R
40|$|International audienceCompounds {{belonging}} to the La-U-O phase space are of technological interest in light water nuclear reactor fuel technology. Mixed uranium-lanthanide oxide compounds form in the UO 2 fuel pellets as lanthanides fission products are incorporated into the fuel during burn-up. Also, lanthanide burnable nuclear poisons (especially Gd) can be added on purpose to urania to control the <b>excess</b> of <b>reactivity</b> in enriched fuels. We believe that different annealing conditions may actually help controlling the distribution of lanthanides in the fluorite derived structures, producing local compositional fluctuations that may significantly deviate from the average random picture. The existence of short or intermediate range order (correlations) can be assessed by diffraction using TEM and X-rays. We have used experiments and simulation to determine the structures of this family of compounds. Diffuse or sharp superstructures along [111]c observed for some compositions suggest that these compounds can be modeled using alternating layers normal to that direction. In this model, the unit cell is composed of alternating planes of anions and cations, which allows us to study in-plane cation ordering. Starting with the parent fluorite phase, and the information either available from existing experimental results or by systematic exploration of the possible solutions involving small supercells, we have determined the symmetry-compatible ordered atomic arrangements of these family of compounds. Density functional theory allows to determine the lowest energy configurations of cations among these layered atom models. Using wet chemistry we have actually synthesized those samples with the most interesting compositions predicted by the numerical modelling, and characterized them by x-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy to assess the predictions...|$|R
50|$|Soluble poisons, {{also called}} {{chemical}} shim, produce a spatially uniform neutron absorption when dissolved {{in the water}} coolant. The most common soluble poison in commercial pressurized water reactors (PWR) is boric acid, which {{is often referred to}} as soluble boron. The boric acid in the coolant decreases the thermal utilization factor, causing a decrease in reactivity. By varying the concentration of boric acid in the coolant, a process referred to as boration and dilution, the reactivity of the core can be easily varied. If the boron concentration is increased, the coolant/moderator absorbs more neutrons, adding negative reactivity. If the boron concentration is reduced (dilution), positive reactivity is added. The changing of boron concentration in a PWR is a slow process and is used primarily to compensate for fuel burnout or poison buildup. The variation in boron concentration allows control rod use to be minimized, which results in a flatter flux profile over the core than can be produced by rod insertion. The flatter flux profile occurs because there are no regions of depressed flux like those that would be produced in the vicinity of inserted control rods. This system is not in widespread use because the chemicals make the moderator temperature reactivity coefficient less negative. All commercial PWR types operating in the US (Westinghouse, Combustion Engineering, and Babcock & Wilcox) employ soluble boron to control <b>excess</b> <b>reactivity.</b> US Navy reactors and Boiling Water Reactors do not.|$|E

Seventy-four cases of retinal disease and 202 control patients were studied. Patients with retinal disease had a significantly higher incidence of toxoplasma seropositivity than the control group. This was because some patients with retinal disease had acquired the infection congenitally. Half the patients investigated for toxoplasmosis were seronegative. Possible explanations for these findings included misdiagnosis, clinical uncertainty, or, the use of serology testing in the confirmation of other diseases.

The {{resulting}} four-coordinate, 14 -electron species, [PhBP 3]FeX, have been thoroughly characterized and feature high-spin (S = 2) electronic ground-states. X-ray diffraction analysis of [PhBP 3]FeCl establishes a monomeric {{structure in the}} solid state. The one electron reduction of [PhBP 3]FeCl {{in the presence of}} a triphenylphosphine cap affords a rare example of four-coordinate iron(I). This species, [PhBP 3]Fe(PPh 3), serves as a synthetic surrogate to a low-valent "[PhBP 3]Fe(I) " subunit that is readily oxidized in the presence of organic azides. The resulting S = 1 / 2 iron(III) imides of general formula [PhBP 3]Fe≡NR may be subsequently reduced by one electron to yield the anionic S = 0 derivatives. Exposure of the former to an atmosphere of CO results in cleavage of the Fe≡NR linkage to yield [PhBP 3]Fe(CO) 2 and free isocyanate (O=C=N-R). Dicarbonyl [PhBP 3]Fe(CO) 2 is itself an imide precursor and is gradually converted back to [PhBP 3]Fe≡NR upon exposure to excess organic azide. Tolyl imide [PhBP 3]Fe?N- p -tolyl readily reacts with H 2 under mild conditions to undergo a step-wise Fe-N x bond scission process to ultimately release free p -toluidine. Initially formed is the S = 2 iron(II) anilide, [PhBP 3]Fe(N(H) - p -tolyl), which has been independently prepared and shown to release p -toluidine in the presence of H 2. In benzene solvent the final iron containing product of the hydrogenation process is diamagnetic [PhBP 3]Fe(? 5 -cyclohexadienyl), which is presumably formed from benzene insertion into a low-valent iron-hydride intermediate. Reduction of the ferromagnetically coupled dimer, [PhBP 3]Fe(N 3) 2, yields the bridging nitride species, [[PhBP 3]Fe 2 (μ -N) ][Na(THF) 5]. This compound features two high-spin iron(II) metal centers that are so strongly antiferromagnetically coupled that a diamagnetic S = 0 ground-state is exclusively populated at room temperature.

40|$|Legacy {{computational}} reactor physics {{software tools}} and protocols currently used for support of Advanced Test Reactor (ATR) core fuel management and safety assurance and, to some extent, experiment management are obsolete, {{inconsistent with the}} state of modern nuclear engineering practice, and are becoming increasingly difficult to properly verify and validate (V&V). Furthermore, the legacy staff knowledge required for application of these tools and protocols from the 1960 s and 1970 s is rapidly being lost due to staff turnover and retirements. In 2009 the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) initiated a focused effort to address this situation through the introduction of modern high-fidelity computational software and protocols, with appropriate V&V, within the next 3 - 4 years via the ATR Core Modeling and Simulation and V&V Update (or 'Core Modeling Update') Project. This aggressive computational and experimental campaign will have a broad strategic impact on the operation of the ATR, both in terms of improved computational efficiency and accuracy for support of ongoing DOE programs as well as in terms of national and international recognition of the ATR National Scientific User Facility (NSUF). The ATR Core Modeling Update Project, targeted for full implementation in phase with the anticipated ATR Core Internals Changeout (CIC) in the 2014 time frame, began during the last quarter of Fiscal Year 2009, and has just completed its first full year. Key accomplishments so far have encompassed both computational as well as experimental work. A new suite of stochastic and deterministic transport theory based reactor physics codes and their supporting nuclear data libraries (SCALE, KENO- 6, HELIOS, NEWT, and ATTILA) have been installed at the INL under various permanent sitewide license agreements and corresponding baseline models of the ATR and ATRC are now operational, demonstrating the basic feasibility of these code packages for their intended purpose. Furthermore, a capability for rigorous sensitivity analysis and uncertainty quantification based on the TSUNAMI system is being implemented and initial computational results have been obtained. This capability will have many applications in 2011 and beyond as a tool for understanding the margins of uncertainty in the new models as well as for validation experiment design and interpretation. Finally we note that although full implementation of the new computational models and protocols will extend over a period 3 - 4 years as noted above, interim applications in the much nearer term have already been demonstrated. In particular, these demonstrations included an analysis that was useful for understanding the cause of some issues in December 2009 that were triggered by a larger than acceptable discrepancy between the measured <b>excess</b> core <b>reactivity</b> and a calculated value that was based on the legacy computational methods. As the Modeling Update project proceeds we anticipate further such interim, informal, applications in parallel with formal qualification of the system under the applicable INL Quality Assurance procedures and standards...|$|R

Monosulfonation of naphthalene- 1 -S yields the 1, 5 -S- 2, 1, 6 -S- 2 and 1, 7 -S- 2 derivatives in a ratio of 71 : 20 : 9. On using a large excess of SO 3, the eventual products are 1, 3, 5 -S- 3, 1, 3, 6 -S- 3 and 1, 3, 5, 7 -S- 4. Monosulfonation of naphthalene yields 5 -S, 6 -S, 7 -S and 8 -S in a 55 : 9 : 6 : 30 ratio, that of 1 -benzoylnaphthalene 5 -S, 6 -S and 7 -S in a ratio of 83 : 11 : 6, and 1 -nitronaphthalene only the 5 -S. The absence of peri sulfonation with 1 -sulfo-, 1 -benzoyl- and 1 -nitronaphthalene is due to prohibitive steric hindrance. 1 -Naphthoic acid and its methyl ester upon SO, sulfonation and aqueous work-up both yield 5 -and 8 -sulfonaphthoic acid in a ratio of 65 : 35 and 77 : 21, respectively. The initially formed peri-substituted product is the intramolecular anhydride of 8 -sulfo- 1 -naphthoic acid (5). All the 2 -substituted naphthalenes yield 5 -S and 8 -S upon SO 3 sulfonation of which the former sulfo isomer is far in <b>excess.</b> The positional <b>reactivity</b> orders for the SO 3 sulfonation of the monosubstituted naphthalene derivatives are discussed in terms of the difference in reactivity of the alpha- and beta-positions, and the steric and electronic effects of the deactivating substituent...|$|R
40|$|Destruction of {{actinides}} in accelerator-driven subcriticals and in stand-alone critical reactors is {{of contemporary}} interest {{as a means}} to reduce long-term high-level waste radiotoxicity. This topical report is focused on the neutronic design challenges of a pure critical actinide transmuter. The key objectives of the design were set to be (1) the attainment of a high actinide burning rate comparable to that of the ATW and (2) the attainment of plausible reactor physics characteristics so that the reactor safety performance is at least comparable to that of traditional fast breeder reactors. The proposed conceptual design is a Pb-Bi cooled 1800 MWth-core with innovative streaming fuel assemblies that exhibits excellent reactivity performance upon coolant voiding, even for local voids in the core center. The core employs metallic, fertile-free fuel where the transuranics are dispersed in a zirconium matrix. The large <b>reactivity</b> <b>excess</b> at BOL is compensated by a system of double-entry control rods. The arrangement of top-entry and bottom-entry control rods in a staggered pattern allows the achievement of a very uniform axial power profile and a small reactivity change from CRD driveline expansion. Excellent void reactivity performance of the proposed design was demonstrated, together with other desirable features such as a very uniform power profile and tight neutronic coupling. A relatively long refueling interval of one and a half years is achieved using a two-batch refueling scheme. In terms of the TRU destruction rate per MWt per full power year the design is comparable to the accelerator-driven systems and other studied pure burner concepts based on sodium-cooled fast reactors. The effective delayed neutron fraction was found to be about 25 % less than that of typical oxide-fueled fast reactors, making the requirements on reactor control performance more demanding. The Doppler coefficient was found to be negative with a magnitude appreciably lower than the typical values of oxide fuels in sodium-cooled reactors, but comparable to the values observed in IFR cores with metallic U-Pu-Zr fuels. The fuel thermal expansion coefficient is also negative, having a magnitude approximately equal to the Doppler coefficient. The proposed core can also incinerate long-lived fission products with an efficiency of about 2. 6 % of the initial Tc 99 inventory per FPY – about the same as critical sodium-cooled pure burners under investigation elsewhere, but less than Tc 99 incineration efficiency claimed for accelerator driven systems, like ATW. The strategy of mixing Tc 99 uniformly in the fuel within the core at the expense of zirconium matrix was found to yield slightly better Tc transmutation efficiency than the use of designated fuel assemblies with zirconium hydride rods at the core periphery. Thermalized fuel assemblies are penalized by low neutron flux because of self shielding; in addition they increase capture to fission ratio in TRU nuclides in the adjacent fuel assemblies, worsening the TRU burning capability. The incineration of Tc 99 in fast spectrum in the rods placed on the core periphery appears to be a more promising alternative than transmutation in thermalized fuel assemblies.

40|$|The North Carolina State University PULSTAR Reactor license was renewed for an {{additional}} 20 years of operation on April 30, 1997. The relicensing period added additional years to the facility operating time {{through the end of}} the second license period, increasing the <b>excess</b> <b>reactivity</b> needs as projected in 1988. In 1995, the Nuclear Reactor Program developed a strategic plan that addressed the future maintenance, development, and utilization of the facility. Goals resulting from this plan included increased academic utilization of the facility in accordance with its role as a university research facility, and increased industrial service use in accordance with the mission of a land grant university. The strategic plan was accepted, and it is the intent of the College of Engineering to operate the PULSTAR Reactor as a going concern through at least the end of the current license period. In order to reach the next relicensing review without prejudice due to low <b>excess</b> <b>reactivity,</b> it is desired to maintain sufficient <b>excess</b> <b>reactivity</b> so that, if relicensed again, the facility could continue to operate without affecting users until new fuel assistance was provided. During the NC State University license renewal, the operation of the PULSTAR Reactor at the State University of New York at Buffalo (SUNY Buffalo) was terminated. At that time, the SUNY Buffalo facility had about 240 unused PULSTAR Reactor fuel pins with 6 % enrichment. The objective of the work reported here was to develop a mixed enrichment core design for the NC State University PULSTAR reactor which would: (1) demonstrate that 6 % enriched SUNY buffalo fuel could be used in the NC State University PULSTAR Reactor within the existing technical specification safety limits for core physics parameters; (2) show that use of this fuel could permit operating the NC State University PULSTAR Reactor to 2017 with increased utilization; and (3) assure that the decision whether or not to relicense the facility would not be prejudiced by reduced operations due to low <b>excess</b> <b>reactivity...</b>|$|E
40|$|A {{diffusion}} theory based MTR fuel management methodology {{has been developed}} for finding superior core loading patterns at any stage for MTR systems, keeping track of burnup of individual fuel assemblies throughout their history. It is based on using burnup dependent group constants obtained by the WIMS-D/ 4 computer code for standard fuel elements and control fuel elements. This methodology has been implemented in a computer program named BFMTR, which carries out detailed five group {{diffusion theory}} calculations using the CITATION code as a subroutine. The core-wide spatial flux and power profiles thus obtained are used for calculating the peak-to-average power and flux-ratios along with the available <b>excess</b> <b>reactivity</b> of the system. The fuel manager can use the BFMTR code for loading pattern optimization for maximizing the <b>excess</b> <b>reactivity,</b> keeping the peak-to-average power as well as flux-ratio within constraints. The results obtained by the BFMTR code {{have been found to}} be in good agreement with the corresponding experimental values for the equilibrium core of the Pakistan Research Reactor- 1...|$|E

40|$|The {{potential}} of utilization of natural uranium without enrichment and reprocessing {{has been shown}} by using nuclear equilibrium theory [1]. The meaning of “without enrichment and reprocessing ” is that any additional fissile materials are not required after its operation is started and after the second reactor, though initial fissile inventory is required,. In this system continuous refueling operation is employed and two types of fast reactors are investigated. The neutron economy is key issue to realize this system. When we consider parasitic neutron absorption and required burnup <b>excess</b> <b>reactivity</b> are considerable, the realization of this system becomes marginal. The hard spectrum is preferable to realize this system, and metallic fuel is employed. Lead bismuth eutectic (LBE) is employed as coolant from safety point of view, though gas shows the better neutron economic performance. The group cross section set is generated with SRAC code system [2] using JENDLE- 3. 2 library [3]. For the fast trial Self-Fuel-Providing Reactor (SFPR) [4] has been investigated. The design parameters are shown in Table 1. The fuel volume fraction is set {{much higher than the}} conventional design to improve neutron economy. Core cooling becomes a difficult job. Feasibility studies on such reactor show that one of the primary difficulties of the reactor design is to provide power distribution as flat as in conventional reactors, since the fissile nuclide concentration of fuel assembly in SFPR is very different each other. For this optimization a modified method of Genetic Algorithm (GA) is employed. The optimized results show some relations between <b>excess</b> <b>reactivity</b> and power peaking. For peak fuel burnup of 22. 5 % and power peaking factor of 1. 5 the peak <b>excess</b> <b>reactivity</b> becomes 2. 15 %. To realize these values a complicated fuel-shuffling scheme should be employed...|$|E
