50|$|Carter v. State <b>Farm</b> <b>Mutual</b> <b>Insurance</b> Co., 2007-0583 (La. App. 1st Cir. --/--/--), 2008 WL --------- Majority upholds trial court’s {{denial of}} summary judgment, finding that a waiver of uninsured/underinsured motorists (UM) {{coverage}} was invalid and, therefore, that Imperial Fire and Casualty Co. (Imperial) provided coverage. Judge Kuhn dissented, stating “Imperial has carried its evidentiary {{burden of proof}} to establish the absence of genuine issues of material fact and is entitled to judgment as matter of law that the UM Rejection Form was properly completed and UM coverage was waived. The evidence establishes that no policy number was {{available at the time}} of execution of the form at issue. LIRC 98-03 specifically provides ‘In the case where a policy number is not available, the space for the policy number may be left blank or a binder number may be inserted.” On appeal, the Supreme Court reversed the majority “for the reasons assigned by the dissenting judge.” See Carter v.

50|$|Despite the law, {{consumers}} and auto repair shops like Leif's Autobody felt continued pressure from {{insurance companies to}} provide incentives for customer steering - specifically in the requirement of insurance companies to do work using refurbished instead of new parts. Hansen took additional action {{as a part of}} a class action lawsuit against State Farm in 2007 to directly combat this type of pressure. In Clark v. State <b>Farm</b> <b>Mutual</b> <b>Insurance</b> Company in 2007, judges threw out the case, claiming that it did not merit a class action status since the initial plaintiff Ricky Eugene Clark received a judgement award before additional claims came forward (Lief Hansen included).

50|$|In 1946, the Ohio Farm Bureau Federation {{first got}} into {{broadcasting}} through a radio service for farmers on WRFD, Columbus, Ohio, an AM radio station. The Ohio Farm Bureau {{was dedicated to}} serving farmers in Ohio, but as its other pursuits (chiefly the <b>Farm</b> Bureau <b>Mutual</b> Automobile <b>Insurance</b> Company) were increasingly made available to non-farmers, the Farm Bureau spun off these ventures into a separate corporation. WRFD continued to serve farmers, and indeed, still carries farm programming today under the ownership of Salem Media of Ohio. However, other Farm Bureau stations—most notably WRFD-FM, now known as WNCI—were transferred to this umbrella corporation, known today as the Nationwide <b>Mutual</b> <b>Insurance</b> Company & Affiliated Companies. The group of stations became known as Nationwide Communications, after its parent company.|$|R
50|$|We take up {{this case}} after remand from the United States Supreme Court, which {{held that the}} {{imposition}} of a $145 million punitive damages award against State <b>Farm</b> <b>Mutual</b> Automobile <b>Insurance</b> Company in favor of State Farm's insured, Curtis B. Campbell, and his wife, Inez Preece Campbell, was excessive and violated the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Campbell, 538 U.S. 408 (2003) (Campbell II) (rev'g 2001 UT 89, 65 P.3d 1134 (Campbell I)). The Supreme Court directed us to recalculate the punitive damages award under principles articulated in its decision. We have performed this task and reduced the jury's award to $9,018,780.75 in punitive damages, a figure nine times the amount of compensatory and special damages awarded to the Campbells.|$|R
5000|$|In the 1920s, {{farmers were}} paying the same rates on their {{automobile}} insurance as city drivers {{even though they}} had less accidents and claims than city drivers. The Ohio Farm Bureau decided to set up their own insurance company to offer rates that accurately reflected the driving habits of farmers. On April 10, 1926 the <b>Farm</b> Bureau <b>Mutual</b> Automobile <b>Insurance</b> Company obtained license to do business in Ohio and two days later it acquired its financing, a $10,000 loan drawn from the membership dues of the Ohio Farm Bureau Federation. [...] At that time, Ohio law required 100 people to pledge to become policyholders. The first agents managed to recruit ten times that number, and on April 12, 1926, <b>Farm</b> Bureau <b>Mutual</b> started business with over 1,000 policyholders.|$|R
2500|$|Garland {{was special}} {{assistant}} to Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti from 1979 to 1981. After the Carter administration ended in 1981, Garland joined the law firm Arnold & Porter as an associate, and was a partner at the firm from 1985 to 1989. While at Arnold & Porter, the white shoe firm founded by Justice Abe Fortas, Garland mostly practiced corporate litigation. In Motor Vehicles Manufacturers Ass'n v. State <b>Farm</b> <b>Mutual</b> Automobile <b>Insurance</b> Co. (1983) Garland acted as counsel to an insurance company suing to reinstate an unpopular automatic seat belt mandate. After winning the case in both the D.C. Circuit and the Supreme Court, Garland would write an eighty-seven page Harvard Law Review article urging courts to use a heightened [...] "hard look" [...] standard of review whenever an agency chooses deregulation. In 1985-86, while at Arnold & Porter, Garland was a lecturer in law at Harvard Law School, where he taught antitrust law. He has also published {{an article in the}} Yale Law Journal urging a broader application of antitrust immunity to state and local governments.|$|R
40|$|Administrative agency {{settlements}} {{have recently}} come under increased judicial scrutiny. Agency actions are presumptively reviewable under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), {{which means they}} are generally subject to, among other requirements, “arbitrary and capricious” review under 5 U. S. C. § 706 (2) and Motor Vehicles Manufacturing Ass’n of the United States v. State <b>Farm</b> <b>Mutual</b> Automobile <b>Insurance</b> Co. In contrast, the U. S. Supreme Court held in Heckler v. Chaney that agency no–action decisions are presumptively unreviewable because they are “committed to agency discretion by law” under 5 U. S. C. § 701 (a) (2). Are agency settlements also presumptively unreviewable? In other words, are they more like actions or no–action decisions? The Supreme Court has twice analyzed agency settlement decisions but has never reached the “committed to agency discretion by law” question. While the D. C. Circuit has ruled that such settlements are presumptively unreviewable, no other circuit has established binding precedent on the issue, and the Ninth Circuit has reviewed agency settlements in several discrete cases. This Note argues that, based on the criteria put forward in Heckler v. Chaney, agency settlements are not presumptively unreviewable. They are, in short, more like actions than no–action decisions...|$|R
40|$|Subrogation is an {{important}} concept in insurance law. There are several reasons why an insurer that has paid for a loss {{should be allowed to}} recover from those legally responsible. First, the insured is prevented from recovering twice for the same loss, preserving the principle of indemnity. Second, the insurer is reimbursed for the payment it has made. Third, the tort-feasor, who is legally responsible, is prevented from receiving a windfall by being absolved of liability. 2 ̆ 2 Stated simply, subrogation is a creature of equity having for its purpose the working out of an equitable adjustment between the parties by securing the ultimate discharge of a debt by the person who in equity and good conscience ought to pay it. In Stetina v. State <b>Farm</b> <b>Mutual</b> Automobile <b>Insurance</b> Co., the Nebraska Supreme Court restricted the insurer 2 ̆ 7 s right to subrogation on payment of a loss to its insured. If the 2 ̆ 2 no subrogation against insured 2 ̆ 2 rule is interpreted to prevent an insurer from ever having subrogation rights against one insured by it, situations may occur in which the claimant insured is allowed double recovery or where the tort-feasor insured receives the windfall of being absolved of liability, both {{at the expense of the}} insurer...|$|R
