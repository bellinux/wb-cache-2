40|$|Despite the {{inclusion}} of equity ideals {{in the design of}} many health care systems, pragmatic tools for integrating them into the efficiency categories of cost-effectiveness in HTA remain under-developed. This paper reviews approaches used to incorporate equity in HTA methods and develops a framework to help decision makers supplement the standard efficiency criteria of HTA and avoid building inequities, explicit or implicit, into their methodology. A ‘checklist’ is provided to alert decision makers {{to a wide range of}} equity considerations for HTA. This checklist is intended to be used as part of the process through which advisory bodies receive their terms of reference; the scoping of the agenda prior to the selection of a candidate <b>intervention</b> <b>and</b> its <b>comparators</b> <b>for</b> HTA; the accompanying background briefing for decision makers; and as a tool to help to structure the discussion and composition of professional and ‘lay’ advisory groups during the assessment process. The checklist is offered as only a beginning of an on-going process of deliberation and consultation, through which the matters covered can be expected to become more comprehensive and the record of past decisions and their contexts in any jurisdiction adopting the tool can serve to guide subsequent evidence gathering and decisions. In these ways, it may be hoped that equity will be more systematically and fully considered and implemented in both the procedures and decisions of HTA. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Citation {{screening}} for scoping searches and rapid review is time-consuming and inefficient, often requiring days or sometimes months to complete. We examined {{the reliability of}} PICo-based title-only screening using keyword searches based on the PICo elements—Participants, <b>Interventions,</b> <b>and</b> <b>Comparators,</b> but not the Outcomes. Methods A convenience sample of 10 datasets, derived from the literature searches of completed systematic reviews, {{was used to test}} PICo-based title-only screening. Search terms for screening were generated from the inclusion criteria of each review, specifically the PICo elements—Participants, <b>Interventions</b> <b>and</b> <b>Comparators.</b> Synonyms <b>for</b> the PICo terms were sought, including alternatives for clinical conditions, trade names of generic drugs and abbreviations <b>for</b> clinical conditions, <b>interventions</b> <b>and</b> <b>comparators.</b> The MeSH database, Wikipedia, Google searches and online thesauri were used to assist generating terms. Title-only screening was performed by five reviewers independently in Endnote X 7 reference management software using OR Boolean operator. Outcome measures were recall of included studies and the reduction in screening effort. Recall is the proportion of included studies retrieved using PICo title-only screening out {{of the total number of}} included studies in the original reviews. The percentage reduction in screening effort is the proportion of records not needing screening because the method eliminates them from the screen set. Results Across the 10 reviews, the reduction in screening effort ranged from 11 to 78 % with a median reduction of 53 %. In nine systematic reviews, the recall of included studies was 100 %. In one review (oxygen therapy), four of five reviewers missed the same included study (median recall 67 %). A post hoc analysis was performed on the dataset with the lowest reduction in screening effort (11 %), and it was rescreened using only the <b>intervention</b> <b>and</b> <b>comparator</b> keywords <b>and</b> omitting keywords for participants. The reduction in screening effort increased to 57 %, and the recall of included studies was maintained (100 %). Conclusions In this sample of datasets, PICo-based title-only screening was able to expedite citation {{screening for}} scoping searches and rapid reviews by reducing the number of citations needed to screen but requires a thorough workup of the potential synonyms and alternative terms. Further research which evaluates the feasibility of this technique with heterogeneous datasets in different fields would be useful to inform the generalisability of this technique...|$|R

40|$|Background: The use of {{information}} technology in healthcare is fast becoming an alternative and supporting method of providing many forms of services in a healthcare and health management setting. Telephone technology is used readily to deliver services such as disease management, consultations and behaviour coaching. Telemedicine provides a promising alternative and supporting service for face-to-face general practice care. The aim of this review is to utilise a systematic review to collate evidence {{on the use of}} telemedicine as a lead in and an alternative to general practice visits. Methods/design: A systematic search of MEDLINE, CINAHL, the Cochrane Library and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform will be performed using the search terms for the <b>intervention</b> (telemedicine) <b>and</b> the <b>comparator</b> (general practice) to search the databases. The systematic review aims to identify randomised control trials; however, if none are identified, an updated search will be conducted to identify lower levels of evidence. Papers will be reviewed and assessed for quality and data extracted using two reviewers; if consensus is required, a third reviewer will be consulted. If applicable, a meta-analysis of relevant outcomes will be conducted. The protocol has been reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses protocols (PRISMA-P) guidelines.

40|$|ABSTRACT – Patients {{referred}} to secondary care for specialist respiratory review frequently undergo multiple hospital atten-dances for investigations and consultations. This study evalu-ated {{the potential of}} a preclinic telephone consultation and subsequent coordination of tests and face-to-face consulta-tions to reduce hospital visits. Total hospital attendances were recorded for three cohorts (participants, non-participants <b>and</b> <b>comparators)</b> <b>for</b> 6 months from first specialist contact. Patients completed the medical interview satisfaction scale- 21 (MISS- 21). The study showed that a preclinic telephone consultation can significantly reduce hospital visits over a fixed period without reducing patient satisfaction. In total, 20. 8 % of the participant group had three or more hospital attendances compared with 42. 9 % of the non-participant group (p 0. 001) and 44. 7 % of the comparator group (p 0. 002).

40|$|This study {{reviewed}} the biological action of key herbs and evaluated systematically the efficacy {{and safety of}} oral Gentiana formula for herpes zoster (HZ). Experimental studies relevant to HZ were identified in PubMed. Randomized controlled trials using Gentiana formula for HZ were identified from nine English and Chinese databases. The primary outcome was evaluation of pain. Potential risk of bias was assessed. Meta-analysis was conducted using mean difference or risk ratio with 95 % confidence intervals. Key herbs Gentiana scabra Bunge, Gentiana triflora Pall, Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi, and Gardenia jasminoides Ellis have shown antiinflammatory actions through inhibition of inflammatory cytokines and pro-inflammatory enzymes. Twenty-six clinical studies, involving 2955 participants, were included. Modified Gentiana formula resolved pain earlier than pharmacotherapy when used alone or combined with topical Chinese herbal medicine. Incidence of postherpetic neuralgia was lower (risk ratio 0. 14, 95 % confidence interval 0. 03 to 0. 74) with modified Gentiana formula plus topical Chinese herbal medicine.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{internet}} is frequently used to share experiences {{of health and}} illness, but this phenomenon has not been harnessed as an intervention to achieve health behaviour change. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the feasibility of a randomised trial assessing the effects of a novel, experience-based website as a smoking cessation intervention. The secondary aim was to measure the potential impact on smoking behaviour of both the <b>intervention</b> <b>and</b> a <b>comparator</b> website. Methods A feasibility randomised controlled single-blind trial assessed a novel, experience-based website containing personal accounts of quitting smoking as a cessation <b>intervention,</b> <b>and</b> a <b>comparator</b> website providing factual information. Feasibility measures including recruitment, and usage of the <b>interventions</b> were recorded, <b>and</b> the following participant-reported outcomes were also measured: Smoking Abstinence Self-Efficacy Questionnaire, the single-item Motivation to Stop Scale, self-reported abstinence, quit attempts and health status outcomes. Eligible smokers from two English regions were entered into the trial and given access to their allocated website for two weeks. Results Eighty-seven smokers were randomised, 65 completed follow-up (75  %).

A secondary aim was to examine the utility of the tools to measure these outcomes in this context; the feasibility of the recruitment and retention strategy and the utility of the comparator group. A before-and after comparison design was used with non- randomised <b>intervention</b> <b>and</b> <b>comparator</b> arms. The <b>intervention</b> arm comprised 30 service users attending the IHSCDU <b>and</b> the <b>comparator</b> arm comprised 33 service users on a community nursing caseload. Measures of functional mobility (Barthel’s Index) and physical and psychological well-being (SF- 12 ) were taken from all participants in both arms at three data collection points: baseline, four and nine months later, between November 2010 and September 2012. Participants and outcomes were identified prospectively and in both arms, the individual was the unit of assignment. No significant changes were noted in functional mobility and psychological well-being and the number of medications prescribed increased in both arms. There was a trend towards a significant difference between study arms in the change in the SF- 12  physical health outcome measure and this outcome measure could be usefully explored in future studies. The recruitment and retention strategy was feasible although our comparator group had some limitations in not being closely matched in terms of age, functional mobility and mental wellbeing.

40|$|In {{this work}} a 9 -bit, 33 MHz hybrid SAR single-slope ADC for element-level {{digitization}} in 2 D ultrasound transducer arrays is presented. This hybrid architecture {{consists of a}} 5 -bit SAR ADC followed by a 4 -bit single-slope ADC. In the comparator design, the dynamic <b>comparator</b> <b>and</b> the continuous-time <b>comparator</b> <b>for</b> the SAR <b>and</b> single-slope conversion, respectively, are combined together with a shared preamplifier. The simulated ENOB is 8. 96 bit, the power consumption is 800 uW, the estimated area is 0. 015 mm 2 and the achieved FoM is 48. 7 fJ/conv-step.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Internationally, funders require {{stakeholder}} involvement throughout health {{technology assessment}} (HTA). We report successes, challenges, and {{lessons learned from}} extensive stakeholder involvement throughout a palliative care case study that demonstrates new concepts and methods for HTA. METHODS: A 5 -step "INTEGRATE-HTA Model" developed within the INTEGRATE-HTA project guided the case study. Using convenience or purposive sampling or directly / indirectly identifying and approaching individuals / groups, stakeholders participated in qualitative research or consultation meetings. During scoping, 132 stakeholders, aged ≥ 18 years in seven countries (England, Italy, Germany, The Netherlands, Norway, Lithuania, and Poland), highlighted key issues in palliative care that assisted identification of the <b>intervention</b> <b>and</b> <b>comparator.</b> Subsequently stakeholders in four countries participated in face-face, telephone and / or video Skype meetings to inform evidence collection and / or review assessment results. An applicability assessment to identify contextual and implementation barriers and enablers for the case study findings involved twelve professionals in the three countries. Finally, thirteen stakeholders participated in a mock decision-making meeting in England. RESULTS: Views about the best methods of stakeholder involvement vary internationally. Stakeholders make valuable contributions in all stages of HTA; assisting decision making about interventions, comparators, research questions; providing evidence and insights into findings, gap analyses and applicability assessments. Key challenges exist regarding inclusivity, time, and resource use. CONCLUSION: Stakeholder involvement is feasible and worthwhile throughout HTA, sometimes providing unique insights. Various methods {{can be used to}} include stakeholders, although challenges exist. Recognition of stakeholder expertise and further guidance about stakeholder consultation methods is needed...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} was to examine the {{empirical}} and methodological cost-effectiveness evidence of surgical interventions for breast, colorectal, or prostate cancer. Methods: A systematic search of seven databases including MEDLINE, EMBASE, and NHSEED, research registers, the NICE Web site and conference proceedings was conducted in April 2012. Study quality was assessed in terms of meeting essential, preferred and UK NICE specific requirements for economic evaluations. Results: The seventeen (breast = 3, colorectal = 7, prostate = 7) included studies covered a broad range of settings (nine European; eight non-European) and six were published over 10 years ago. The populations, <b>interventions</b> <b>and</b> <b>comparators</b> were generally well defined. Very few studies were informed by literature reviews and few used synthesized clinical evidence. Although the interventions had potential differential effects on recurrence and mortality rates, some studies used relatively short time horizons. Univariate sensitivity analyses were reported in all studies but less than a third characterized all uncertainty with a probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Although a third of studies incorporated patients' health-related quality of life data, only four studies used social tariff values. Conclusions: There is a dearth of recent robust evidence describing the cost-effectiveness of surgical interventions in the management of breast, colorectal and prostate cancers. Many of the recent publications did not satisfy essential methodological requirements such as using clinical evidence informed by a systematic review and synthesis. Given the ratio of potential benefit and harms associated with cancer surgery and the volume of resources consumed by these, there is an urgent need to increase economic evaluations of these technologies...|$|R
