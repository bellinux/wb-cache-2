5|$|Due to {{extremely}} {{cold winter}} temperatures, the falls freeze, creating a dramatic cascade of ice that can last {{well into the}} spring. <b>If</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> rain shortage in the autumn, the falls may virtually dry up.

5|$|If {{the leader}} of the {{opposition}} party is not a Member of Parliament, then a sitting MP takes the role of acting Leader of the Opposition until the party leader can obtain a seat. <b>If</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> leadership race occurring within the party, an MP (usually the interim party leader) will serve as Leader of the Opposition until a new party leader is chosen.|$|E

5|$|<b>If</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> {{halo effect}} {{spreading}} to anything {{connected to the}} self, then people in relationships should like the name letters of their partners more than other letters. LeBel and Campbell tested this and found a name-letter effect for initials of subjects' partners.

5|$|In addition, it {{also appears}} that an applicant's {{subjective}} motivation {{is relevant to}} {{whether he or she}} should be recognized as having public standing.

5|$|In {{philosophy}} {{the boiling}} frog {{story has been}} used as a way of explaining the sorites paradox.

5|$|Young forests (trees <2 years old) {{are most}} at risk from ash falls {{and are likely to}} be {{destroyed}} by ash deposits >100 mm. Ash fall is unlikely to kill mature trees, but ash loading may break large branches during heavy ash falls (>500 mm).

5|$|Both sexes reach sexual {{maturity}} at {{one year of}} age. The male mates with the female by swimming close to her with his head lowered and tail raised, continually whistling. <b>If</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> group of males, they will chase the female in flight until only one drake is left. The female prepares for copulation, which {{takes place in the}} water, by lowering her body; the male then bobs his head up and down and mounts the female, taking the feathers {{on the back of her}} head in his mouth. After mating, he raises his head and back and whistles.|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, the {{legislative}} branch officially holds the Union's budgetary authority. The EU's budget (which is around 155 billion euro) is subject {{to a form of}} the ordinary legislative procedure with a single reading giving Parliament power over the entire budget (prior to 2009, its influence was limited to certain areas) on an equal footing to the Council. <b>If</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> disagreement between them, it is taken to a conciliation committee as it is for legislative proposals. But if the joint conciliation text is not approved, the Parliament may adopt the budget definitively. In addition to the budget, the Council coordinates the economic policy of members.|$|E
5|$|<b>If</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> clause both {{of whose}} {{variables}} are already set, {{in a way}} that falsifies the clause, then the algorithm backtracks to its most recent choice point, undoing the assignments it made since that choice, and reverses the decision made at that choice. If there is no choice point, or if the algorithm has already backtracked over the most recent choice point, then it aborts the search and reports that the input 2-CNF formula is unsatisfiable.|$|E

There have been two ties for {{first place in the}} history of the contest. In 1969, Tommy Körberg tied for first place with Jan Malmsjö. The juries them voted for their favourite out the two, leading to Tommy Körberg winning. In 1978, Björn Skifs tied for first place with Lasse Holm and Wizex (performing together); a similar tie-break process resulting in Skifs winning.|$|E
5|$|In {{computer}} science, Putnam {{is known}} for the Davis–Putnam algorithm for the Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT), developed with Martin Davis in 1960. The algorithm finds <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> set of true or false values that satisfies a given Boolean expression so that the entire expression becomes true. In 1962, they further refined the algorithm {{with the help of}} George Logemann and Donald W. Loveland. It became known as the DPLL algorithm. This algorithm is efficient and still forms the basis of most complete SAT solvers.|$|E
5|$|Intense {{tropical}} cyclones pose {{a particular}} observation challenge, {{as they are}} a dangerous oceanic phenomenon, and weather stations, being relatively sparse, are rarely available {{on the site of}} the storm itself. In general, surface observations are available only if the storm is passing over an island or a coastal area, or <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> nearby ship. Real-time measurements are usually taken in the periphery of the cyclone, where conditions are less catastrophic and its true strength cannot be evaluated. For this reason, there are teams of meteorologists that move into the path of tropical cyclones to help evaluate their strength at the point of landfall.|$|E
