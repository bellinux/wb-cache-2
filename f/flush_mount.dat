The 1972 Torino styling emphasized the [...] "long hood short deck" [...] look and had strong elements of coke bottle styling. [...] The Torino line was also revised to {{be made up of}} basic models called [...] "Torino" [...] and more upscale models called [...] "Gran Torinos." [...] The most radical change was a large eggcrate grille in an oval opening on Gran Torinos. Tom McCahill, stated [...] "the gaping grille looks a little like it was patterned after Namu, the killer whale", but also stated that the Torino had [...] "kind of pleasing, no-nonsense styling." [...] Gran Torinos had chrome bezels surrounding the headlamps {{on each side of the}} large oval grille. [...] Base Torinos had a full width argent eggcrate grille that surrounded the headlights. Base Torinos also used a unique hood and front bumper differentiating it from the Gran Torino models. The Torino's front fenders were flared around the wheel opening and the rear quarter panel had strong character line extending to the rear bumper. The windshield had a more rakish 60-degree angle, while the A-pillars and roof were thinner. Even with this changes, structural integrity remained the same as 1971 models. The rear featured a full width bumper that incorporated thin rectangular tail lights into each bumper end.

60|$|I saw a hot <b>flush</b> <b>mount</b> to the friar's {{prominent}} cheek-bones. Indeed, {{he was a}} {{very human}} man under his conventual robe, with swift stirrings of passion which the long habit of repression had not yet succeeded in extinguishing. He cast his eyes to the ceiling in such a glance of despair as left me thoughtful. It was as an invocation to Heaven to look down upon the obstinate, ignorant folly of this woman who accounted herself wise and who so garbled the Divine teaching as to blaspheme with complacency.|$|E
6000|$|With {{a sort of}} {{pleasure}} she saw a look of bewilderment cover that old face; with a sort {{of pleasure}} she marked the trembling of the hands raising their owner from the chair; and heard the stammering in the voice: [...] "You are going? Before-before he comes? You-you won't be seeing him again?" [...] With a sort of pleasure she marked the hesitation, which did not know whether to thank, or bless, or just say nothing and creep away. With a sort of pleasure she watched the <b>flush</b> <b>mount</b> in the faded cheeks, the faded lips pressed together. Then, at the scarcely whispered words: [...] "Thank you, my dear!" [...] she turned, unable to bear further sight or sound. She went to the window and pressed her forehead against the glass, trying to think of nothing. She heard the sound of wheels-Lady Casterley had gone. And then, of all the awful feelings man or woman can know, she experienced the worst: She could not cry! ...|$|E

50|$|<b>Flush</b> <b>mount</b> albums have hard covers with thick, {{unbending}} pages. They {{consist of}} photographic prints that were dry-mounted on cardboard. The covers are mostly made of leather, leatherette or glass. The photos lie completely flat and extend {{across the whole}} page. <b>Flush</b> <b>mount</b> albums are usually designed in magazine-style. They are most often used for special occasions such as weddings and anniversaries {{due to the fact}} that they are produced at a higher quality and are more expensive to produce than coffee table books.|$|E
50|$|Digital photo {{books have}} {{digitally}} printed pages {{as opposed to}} albums that consist of traditional photos. Both <b>flush</b> <b>mount</b> albums as well as coffee table books are printed digitally. The photos of <b>flush</b> <b>mount</b> albums are printed on photographic paper, which {{is comparable to the}} quality of traditionally developed photos. Coffee table books, on the other hand, are printed with inkjet on ordinary paper and are therefore of a lower quality. Digital printing gives the album designer a vast number of design possibilities, for example magazine-style or montage albums are only possible with digital printing.|$|E

In 1973 the trunk lock was below the trunk deck and above the rear bumper in a space that no longer existed on the 1974.

5000|$|... 1993 Altimas {{came with}} a {{rosewood}} colored dash trim and only had a driver's side airbag coupled with automatic shoulder belts(the center console was slimmer to accommodate the lap belts). The 1994 Altima gained a darker burl wood dash trim, a <b>flush</b> <b>mount</b> passenger airbag and regular seat belts. 1993 and 1994 models came with chrome inner door handles standard with an auto door lock/unlock feature on the passenger side. For 1995, the inner door handles were changed to color matched plastic, and a plug replaced where the passenger auto door lock/unlock feature was. 1993 and 1994 models also had a slim [...] armrest lid, however, if an optional leather armrest was selected, it brought the height up to about 4.5 in. For 1995, all the armrest lids were thicker and about 4.5 in tall. The 1995 model year (introduced 1994) also brought a new venetian blind-like grille, new taillights (red and clear), and a new 2 leg mount spoiler with a red LED brake light for the SE. Some other changes included {{the removal of the}} rear speaker grilles for a flat rear deck, a cheaper cloth interior, a plastic cover replacing the rear ashtray, and the digital in dash clock was now optional. For the 1995.5 model year in March 1995, a raised mount passenger airbag with a new inflator was introduced in post-March 3, 1995 production. 1996 brought new wheel covers for base models. During the 1997 model year the GXE gained a new [...] "Limited Edition" [...] package including alloy wheels, keyless entry, alarm, floor mats, and a Limited Edition sticker on each side near the front wheels. The majority of final-year Altima models were dubbed [...] "1997.5" [...] models, signifying the added crash protection necessary to meet 1997 side-impact standards.|$|E
