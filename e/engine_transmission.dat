5|$|Turning {{forces are}} {{generated}} during maneuvers for balancing {{in addition to}} just changing direction of travel. These may be interpreted as centrifugal forces in the accelerating reference frame of the bike and rider; or simply as inertia in a stationary, inertial reference frame and not forces at all. Gyroscopic forces acting on rotating parts such as wheels, <b>engine,</b> <b>transmission,</b> etc., are also due to the inertia of those rotating parts. They are discussed further in the section on gyroscopic effects below.|$|E
25|$|GenX Nano {{comes in}} five variants, XE, XM, XMA, XT and XTA. Overall dimensions, <b>engine,</b> <b>transmission,</b> suspension, {{steering}} and brakes {{are the same}} in all variants. The key differences are in the car features.|$|E
25|$|Components of the SM {{lived on}} — in the Maserati Merak (<b>engine,</b> <b>transmission)</b> and the Lotus Esprit (transmission (both mirror image)). The {{successful}} Citroën CX carried forward {{most of the}} SM's dynamic qualities, including the trendsetting speed sensitive power steering.|$|E

The Fa 226 was the world's first transport helicopter and was ordered by Lufthansa in 1938.|$|E
25|$|The Bell AH-1 Cobra is a two-blade, {{single-engine}} {{attack helicopter}} manufactured by Bell Helicopter. It was developed using the <b>engine,</b> <b>transmission</b> and rotor {{system of the}} Bell UH-1 Iroquois.

25|$|From 1995 to August1997, the Nevada State Railroad Museum {{conducted}} a feasibility study {{of whether the}} McKeen could be restored to working order.

25|$|The E46 {{electronics}} {{are more}} integrated than previous generations of 3 Series, {{including the use}} of a CAN bus system. Drivetrain information (such as <b>engine,</b> <b>transmission</b> and stability control) is communicated using the CAN bus. Vehicle electronics (such as the radio, navigation, television and telecommunications) can communicate to each other via the K-bus.|$|E
25|$|When first {{accepted}} for {{service in the}} army, the Arjun relied heavily on foreign components and technology. Initially close to 50% of the tank's components were imported, which included the <b>engine,</b> <b>transmission,</b> gun barrel, tracks, and fire control system. However, several of these have since been replaced by indigenous systems or are being supplied by Indian companies. Recent comments from Army sources indicate that the Russian T-90S will form the mainstay of its future force, despite that tank’s performance issues in hot weather.|$|E
25|$|The Range Rover Classic was {{a popular}} {{platform}} for conversion vehicles built by independent coachbuilders. Some examples of common modifications include ambulances, 6x4s, convertibles, police vehicles, limos, and open top hunting cars. Though some coachbuilders utilized Range Rovers simply for the chassis and drivetrain while grafting new fabricated bodies on top, most of them retained the familiar Range Rover styling elements, while upgrading the <b>engine,</b> <b>transmission,</b> suspension, or interior design. The coachbuilders include Carbodies, Carmichael, FLM Panelcraft, Glenfrome, Rapport and Wood and Pickett.|$|E

25|$|By {{the summer}} of 1941, most of the Red Army's vast numbers of tanks were {{suffering}} from serious wear and tear. Poor quality roads, the vulnerabilities of track design in the early 1930s, and inadequate maintenance, recovery and repair services all took their toll. In some of the front line armoured units, {{up to half of}} the T-26, T-28 and BT tanks had major drive train components (<b>engine,</b> <b>transmission</b> or suspension) which were broken down or completely worn out, and these disabled tanks were parked and cannibalised for spare parts to keep the rest running. Tanks damaged during the 1939 Winter War with Finland were also cannibalised for parts.|$|E
25|$|The torque {{applied to}} each driving wheel {{is the result}} of the <b>engine,</b> <b>transmission,</b> and drive axle {{applying}} a twisting force against the resistance of the traction at that roadwheel. In lower gears, and thus at lower speeds, and unless the load is exceptionally high, the drivetrain can supply as much torque as necessary, so the limiting factor becomes the traction under each wheel. It is therefore convenient to define traction as the amount of force that can be transmitted between the tire and the road surface before the wheel starts to slip. If the torque applied to one of the drive wheels exceeds the threshold of traction, then that wheel will spin, and thus provide torque only at the other driven wheel equal to the sliding friction at the slipping wheel. The reduced net traction may still be enough to propel the vehicle slowly.|$|E
25|$|The UH-1H's dynamic {{components}} include the <b>engine,</b> <b>transmission,</b> rotor mast, main rotor blades, tail rotor driveshaft, and the 42-degree and 90-degree gearboxes. The transmission is of a planetary type {{and reduces the}} engine's output to 324 rpm at the main rotor. The two-bladed, semi-rigid rotor design, with pre-coned and underslung blades, is a development of early Bell model designs, such as the Bell 47 with which it shares common design features, including a dampened stabilizer bar. The two-bladed system reduces storage space required for the aircraft, but {{at a cost of}} higher vibration levels. The two-bladed design is also responsible for the characteristic 'Huey thump' when the aircraft is in flight, which is particularly evident during descent and in turning flight. The tail rotor is driven from the main transmission, via the two directional gearboxes which provide a tail rotor speed approximately six times that of the main rotor to increase tail rotor effectiveness.|$|E

500|$|After being {{absent from}} the WRC for the 2006 season to spend {{thirteen}} months concentrating on preparing their new [...] vehicle, the Citroën Total World Rally Team returned in 2007 ready to début it in the Monte Carlo Rally. The Citroën Xsara WRC had dominated the championship in recent years, and despite its age it was still incredibly reliable and was only replaced because the Xsara model {{was no longer in}} production. The C4's mechanical components, such as the <b>engine,</b> <b>transmission,</b> differentials and suspension were either very similar to, or came from, the Xsara, but the wheelbase and chassis were longer by [...] and , respectively, which meant that under WRC rules the C4 could be widened to [...] It was also higher than the Xsara, and the weight distribution had been fine-tuned, including raising and moving back the front seats (which had the negative effect of reducing the drivers' visibility), and attaching the wing mirrors to the midpoint along the front doors. The C4's test drivers reported that the car handled more stably.|$|E

2500|$|Through its production, the Mercury Sable was {{produced}} on the Ford D186 (1986-2005) and Ford D3 (2008-2009) platforms. [...] Sharing its <b>engine,</b> <b>transmission,</b> and suspension with the Ford Taurus, to visually distinguish the two vehicles, relatively few exterior body panels were shared on sedans (with {{the exception of}} doors). [...] Prior to 1996, Mercury Sables were given separate interior designs; on 2008-2009 examples, {{a greater degree of}} commonality is shared in exterior and interior design.|$|E

2500|$|In May 2008, Aston Martin {{announced}} new technological updates for the Vantage, {{which included}} {{changes to the}} <b>engine,</b> <b>transmission,</b> suspension and appearance. New cylinder liners that were now pressed into the aluminium block instead of the original cast-in variants allow a thinner liner, which in turn allows a larger capacity of 4.7L. The cylinder bore and stroke has been increased from [...] to [...] and [...] to [...] respectively, giving a total displacement of 4735cc. The dry sump lubrication system was also modified.|$|E
2500|$|CFEES has {{successfully}} designed and operationalized Integrated Fire Detection and Suppression Systems for Armoured vehicles like the Arjun MBT, T-72 [...] "Ajeya" [...] and Abhay ICV.

The system is capable of detection and suppression of fires in the crew compartment within 200 milliseconds and in the engine compartment within 15s.|$|E
2500|$|The initial {{design was}} a {{prototype}} {{for a light}} military vehicle {{in the style of}} the American , but its small wheels and low ground clearance made it impractical as an off-road vehicle. It was subsequently offered in a civilian version as a low-cost, easily maintained utility vehicle. The Moke finally achieved success as a beach buggy—becoming a popular [...] "cult" [...] vehicle in the Algarve, Seychelles, Australia, the United States and many tropical resorts in the Caribbean.
