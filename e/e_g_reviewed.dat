This has triggered in new forest-related policies and strategies at different political levels and across different sectors (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> <b>reviewed</b> EU Bioeconomy strategy in 2017). This study analyses on how sustainable forest management (SFM) targets have been formulated and set in national forest-focused policies and strategies for 19 European countries. Results show that SFM policy targets formulated in national forest-focused policies and strategies represent the ecological and socio-economic framework of each country. The results show also that SFM forest-focused policy targets may contradict, e. g. increasing use of wood versus increasing the area of protected forests, which may result in an increase of forest area not available for wood supply, unless the area of forest is not increased as well. 201...|$|E

40|$|Bamboo {{plants can}} be {{classified}} into two types by their growth feature (Uchimura 1990). One is monopodial and single culm-forming type which grows mainly in temperate and subtropical regions {{and the other is}} sympodial and clump-forming type which is distributed in tropical regions. Genus Phyllostachys, one of major bamboos found in Japan belongs to the former. Since bamboo plants have unique growth characteristics such as fast growing, long life span, and monocarpic mass flowering, it is quite important to investigate physiological and molecular biological events in their growth for better understanding of this unique plant species. To date, plant tissue culture is one of the essential techniques to micropropagate a target plant {{in a short period of}} time and it is also a promising tool for elucidating growth characteristics and developmental potential of the plant.

40|$|Different {{ethical issues}} arise {{according}} to how the construct of writing is defined for assessment purposes. Most formal assessments assume a pragmatic, functional definition of second-language (L 2) writing in which an examinee’s text production is judged norma-tively in respect to conventions for a discourse type or domain (Santos, 1992). This raises ethical concerns that have conventionally been addressed in high stakes language tests such as confidentiality, prior orientation, fairness, or equality of opportunity. But other, alterna-tive definitions of writing are prominent in the pedagogical literature and in educational practices, particularly for users of second languages, for example, defining writing {{as a mode of}} learning, the expression of identity, or a medium for political action (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> <b>reviewed</b> in Cumming, 2001 a; Hamp-Lyons & Kroll, 1997). Such constructs are rarely assessed in formal tests, seemingly because they raise moral issues, for example, concerning definitions of personal development, inter-cultural negotiation, knowledge, and emancipation, which necessarily have to be denied to fulfill the ethical criteria (e. g., confidentiality, prior orien-tation, fairness, and equality of opportunity) associated with the assessment of functional definitions of writing. I discuss these issues in respect to efforts to develop new task types for a new TOEFL, particularly in distinguishing between the constructs of writing tasks that solicit either independent expression or responses to substantive reading or listenin...|$|E

40|$|Nutritional {{genomics}} (nutrigenomics) {{is a broad}} {{field that}} relates the genome to nutrition, and includes the effects of dietary components on the expression of genes and on the repair of genetic damage. Bioactive forms of vitamin A (retinoids) and D (calciferols), for example, can modulate gene expression programs and thereby affect reproduction, development, and many other physiological functions, <b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> <b>reviewed</b> in [1 - 3], discussion below. An individual’s genetic and epigenetic uniqueness influences the ability to produce, metabolize, transport or store nutrients, and can result in unique nutritional requirements. Nutrients and other dietary factors can contribute to disease prevention and therapy through several strategies whereby their intake is increased or decreased to (a) help control the effects of genetic mutations that cause diseases or contribute to disease risk, and (b) influence expression of genes that typically lack such genetic mutations but contribute to disease risk. Nutritional epigenetics (nutriepigenetics, a term I use since 2008) is defined as one component of category b, and includes dietary factors that modulate gene expression {{through some of the}} covalent modifications of chromatin components. Such modifications create marks or patterns, e. g., DNA methylation, that may be heritable through somatic (mitotic) or germ cell (meiotic) divisions.

40|$|Sentiment {{classification}} aims {{to automatically}} predict sentiment polarity (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> positive or neg-ative) of user-generated sentiment data (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> <b>reviews,</b> blogs). To obtain sentiment classifica-tion with high accuracy, supervised techniques require {{a large amount}} of manually labeled data. The labeling work can be time-consuming and expensive, which makes unsupervised (or semi-supervised) sentiment analysis essential for this application. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm, called graph co-regularized non-negative matrix tri-factorization (GNMTF), from the geometric perspective. GNMTF assumes that if two words (or documents) are sufficiently close to each other, they tend to share the same sentiment polarity. To achieve this, we encode the geometric information by constructing the nearest neighbor graphs, in conjunction with a non-negative matrix tri-factorization framework. We derive an efficient algorithm for learning the factorization, analyze its complexity, and provide proof of convergence. Our empirical study on two open data sets validates that GNMTF can consistently improve the sentiment classification accuracy in comparison to the state-of-the-art methods. ...|$|R
