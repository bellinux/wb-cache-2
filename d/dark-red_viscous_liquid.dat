Method. <b>Viscous</b> <b>liquids</b> of soybean oil, octyl methoxycinnamate, flax oil, aloe vera gel, and glycerol were used in five experiments, using the same methodology for each. Liquids were applied in the peritoneal cavity before and after mechanical peritoneal trauma. Results were evaluated by multivariate analysis. Results. Compared with the control group, macroscopic and microscopic adhesion values before (P <. 001) and after (P <. 05) application of <b>viscous</b> <b>liquids</b> significantly reduced PPAs. Values were significantly lower when liquids were applied before rather than after peritoneal trauma (P <. 0001). Discussion. <b>Viscous</b> <b>liquids</b> injected into the peritoneal cavity before or after mechanical peritoneal trauma decrease PPA. Injection before trauma was more effective than after trauma.

40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{model for}} the {{dynamics}} of spherical bubble growth in a quiescent <b>viscous</b> <b>liquid</b> is presented.

The growth of the bubble in the <b>viscous</b> <b>liquid</b> {{is assumed to be}} controlled by momentum, heat and mass transfer. Using the integral method, the transport equations were transformed into ordinary differential equations, which were numerically solved. An analytical criterion of when it is justified to make the usual isothermal assumption is also derived.

We discuss ten “themes ” of <b>viscous</b> <b>liquid</b> {{physics and}} show how {{they point to}} a general {{description}} of equilibrium <b>viscous</b> <b>liquid</b> dynamics at a given temperature. This description is based on standard time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equations for the density fields, stress tensor fields, potential energy density field, and fields quantifying molecular orientations. One characteristic aspect of {{the theory is that}} density has the appearance of a non-conserved field. Another characteristic feature is long-wavelength dominance of the dynamics, an assumption that not only simplifies the theory by allowing for an ultralocal Hamiltonian (free energy), but also explains the observed independence of chemistry. This is because, whereas there are no long-ranged static (i. e., equal-time) correlations in the model, there are important long-ranged dynamic correlations on the alpha time scale.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the development of}} a new manufacturing technology, called a Variable Lip Slot Die (VLSD), used for automatically patterning <b>viscous</b> <b>liquid</b> materials (e. g., adhesives, sealants) in a controlled manner. This is not easily done due to the characteristic properties of these types of materials, i. e., high viscosity, temperature-dependent rheological properties, tendency to cure. A VLSD is essentially a standard slot die with a pinactuated variable lip that allows for real-time control over the pattern and thickness of <b>viscous</b> <b>liquids</b> deposited on a substrate. The advantages of the VLSD over other more conventional patterning methods (e. g., stenciling) include: versatility, flexibility, repeatability, accuracy, speed, little or no material waste, cost savings, and manufacturing control over the deposited liquid pattern.

40|$|Abstract. The {{solidity}} of <b>viscous</b> <b>liquids</b> – their “solid-like-ness ” – {{gives rise}} to several conjectures, here referred to as themes.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{recently}} {{reported that in}} presence of low Reynolds number (Re<< 1) transport, preformed bacterial biofilms, several hours after their formation, may degenerate in form of filamentous structures, known as streamers. In this letter, we explain that such streamers form as the highly <b>viscous</b> <b>liquid</b> states of the intrinsically viscoelastic biofilms. Such "viscous liquid" state can be hypothesized by noting that the time of appearance of the streamers is substantially larger than the viscoelastic relaxation time scale of the biofilms, and this appearance is explained by the inability of a <b>viscous</b> <b>liquid</b> to withstand an external shear. Further, by identifying the post formation dynamics of the streamers {{as that of a}} <b>viscous</b> <b>liquid</b> jet in a surrounding flow field, we can interpret several unexplained issues associated with the post-formation dynamics of streamers, such as the clogging of the flow passage or the exponential time growth of streamer dimensions...|$|R
