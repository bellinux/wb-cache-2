40|$|Using {{cellular}} phones the {{specific absorption rate}} (SAR) as a physical value must observe established and internationally defined levels to guarantee human protection. To assess human protection {{it is necessary to}} guarantee safety under worst-case conditions (especially maximum transmitting power) using {{cellular phones}}. To evaluate the exposure to electromagnetic fields under normal terms of use of cellular phones the limitations of the specific absorption rate must be pointed out. In a mobile radio network normal terms of use of cellular phones, i. e. in interconnection with a <b>fixed</b> <b>radio</b> <b>transmitter</b> of a mobile radio network, power control of the cellular phone as well as the antenna diagram regarding a head phantom are also significant for the real exposure. Based on the specific absorption rate, the antenna diagram regarding a head phantom and taking into consideration the power control a new parameter, the typical absorption rate (SAR typ), is defined in this contribution. This parameter indicates the specific absorption rate under average normal conditions of use. Constant radio link attenuation between a cellular phone and a <b>fixed</b> <b>radio</b> <b>transmitter</b> for all mobile models tested was assumed in order to achieve constant field strength at the receiving antenna of the <b>fixed</b> <b>radio</b> <b>transmitter</b> as a result of power control. The typical specific absorption rate is a characteristic physical value of every mobile model. The typical absorption rate was calculated for 16 different mobile models and compared with the absorption rate at maximum transmitting power. The results confirm the relevance of the definition of this parameter (SAR typ) as opposed to the specific absorption rate as a competent and applicable method to establish the real mean exposure from a cellular phone in a mobile radio network. The typical absorption rate provides a parameter to assess electromagnetic fields of a cellular phone that is more relevant to the consumer...|$|E
50|$|Green Bank {{is in the}} United States National Radio Quiet Zone, {{which is}} coordinated by NRAO for {{protection}} of the Green Bank site {{as well as the}} Sugar Grove, West Virginia monitoring site operated by the NSA. The zone consists of a 13000 sq mi piece of land where fixed transmitters must coordinate their emissions before a license is granted. The land was set aside by the Federal Communications Commission in 1958. No <b>fixed</b> <b>radio</b> <b>transmitters</b> are allowed within the area closest to the telescope. All other <b>fixed</b> <b>radio</b> <b>transmitters</b> including TV and radio towers inside the zone are required to transmit such that interference at the antennas is minimized by methods including limited power and using highly directional antennas. With the advent of wireless technology and microprocessors in everything from cameras to cars, it is difficult to keep the sites free of radio interference. To aid in limiting outside interference, the area surrounding the Green Bank observatory was at one time planted with pines characterized by needles of a certain length to block electromagnetic interference at the wavelengths used by the observatory. At one point, the observatory faced the problem of North American flying squirrels tagged with US Fish & Wildlife Service telemetry transmitters. Electric fences, electric blankets, faulty automobile electronics, and other radio wave emitters have caused great trouble for the astronomers in Green Bank. All vehicles on the premises are powered by diesel motors to minimize interference by ignition systems.|$|R
40|$|A {{promising}} {{approach in}} the field of personal radio-frequency (RF) dosimetry is the use of a body worn electromagnetic probe (i. e. personal RF body worn dosemeter) to record personal exposure to RF fields. Using such a dosemeter mounted on the body, an individual&# 039;s exposure could be recorded at the time and place that it occurs. This would fulfil an important criterion for epidemiological and other studies into the relationship between RF exposures and health effects in humans. The relationship between a dosemeter measurement and quantities that characterise human exposure to RF fields, such as the spatially averaged exposure field and the whole body average specific absorption rate (SAR), is not well understood nor been rigorously quantified. This thesis tackled the problem of determining the relationship by employing computational modelling and statistical simulations to generate distributions of the fields close to the surface of realistic human body models. These fields are proxies for measurements made with an ideal, isotropic responding, body worn personal RF dosemeter (or simply dosemeter). It focussed on exposures occurring remote (in the far-field) from microwave antennas such as those associated with mobile and wireless base-stations, TV and other typically <b>fixed</b> <b>radio</b> <b>transmitters.</b> Exposures from RF transmitters worn on or in close proximity to the body were not the subject of this study. Initial computational modelling using single plane waves with arbitrary incident angles and polarisation revealed the extent and nature of the distribution of electromagnetic fields close to the surface of a body. Results indicated that a dosemeter measurement could lead to an over or under-estimation of the exposure field. Other factors affecting the close fields were also investigated to quantify their impact. Additional plane wave modelling found that dosemeter measurements could be used to estimate the exposure field or the whole body averaged SAR with similar levels of uncertainty. Finally, Monte Carlo simulations were performed to provide statistical information concerning the relationship between dosemeter measurement of the field close to the body and the exposure field and whole body averaged SAR. Exposures to RF fields were modelled using statistics that describe radio wave propagation in outdoor and indoor multipath environments at 450, 900 and 2100 MHz. Correction factors and associated standard deviations derived from the output of simulations can be applied to measurements made with actual, physical dosemeters to determine estimates of both exposure field and whole body averaged SAR...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{considers}} {{the risk evaluation}} of microwaves from two important points of view. First, the methodology of the exposure studies elucidating {{the health effects of}} mobile phones is considered starting from the general aspects of designing setups and proceeding to the assessment of the exposure level (dosimetry) and practical execution of the experiments. Second, the exposure assessment in practical safety evaluations of <b>fixed</b> <b>radio</b> <b>transmitters,</b> such as mobile phone base stations, is studied. The dosimetry and the exposure setup design are critical for the success of exposure studies since the biological results are worthless if the used exposure level is not known. Furthermore, the experiments with test animals or human volunteers are always very challenging in practice. This work aimed to design, implement and analyse setups for four separate biological experiments. The first experiment related to a novel study of the effects of mobile phone (GSM) radiation in human skin in vivo. In the second experiment the brain functions of domestic pigs exposed to high level GSM type radiation were studied. The third setup was used for long term exposure of over 200 unrestrained rats. The rat setup was further utilised in another experiment searching the effects of microwave radiation on central nervous system of juvenile rats. The dosimetric analysis was performed by means of numerical simulations in all cases. The simulations were validated by measurements and the uncertainty of achieved results was analysed. The functionality of the setups was proven in practice; all experiments were successfully executed and the results of both methodological and biological studies were reported in peer reviewed journals. The need for microwave safety evaluations has increased quickly during the last decade. The number of base station (BS) antennas has increased rapidly and they are often placed on roof tops etc. where various professionals have to work. Hence, efficient methods for assessing the compliance with exposure limits are needed. The scope of the work, presented in this thesis, was to study the near field exposure caused by real commercial BS models. Experimental measurements were utilised to achieve a set of specific absorption rate (SAR) and electric field data in the near field of six commonly used antenna models. Moreover, one of the antennas was studied in more detail by numerical simulations. The results were further analysed to compare the different methods for checking the compliance of an antenna installation with the exposure limits and to find out how significant the local exposure is as compared to the whole body average at different distances. These results provide useful information for the future revisions of the exposure limits and related measurement standards...|$|R
