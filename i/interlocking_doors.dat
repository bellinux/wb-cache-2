50|$|A mantrap, air lock, sally port {{or access}} control {{vestibule}} {{is a physical}} security access control system comprising a small space with two sets of <b>interlocking</b> <b>doors,</b> such that {{the first set of}} doors must close before the second set opens.|$|E
50|$|Entrance {{security}} products include <b>interlocking</b> <b>doors,</b> turnstiles {{and other}} entrance systems which only allow entry to authorised individuals. These are used, for example, in mass transit public transport systems or at stadia to allow passage to only those people carrying a valid ticket. Entrance control {{is also used}} in airports to facilitate boarding and immigration control, and to prevent passengers returning from landside to airside.|$|E

40|$|Counting {{the number}} of people is {{something}} many security application focus on, when dealing with controlling accesses in restricted areas, as it occurs with banks, airports, railway stations and governmental offices. This paper presents an automated solution for detecting the presence of more than one person into <b>interlocked</b> <b>doors</b> adopted in many accesses. In most cases, <b>interlocked</b> <b>doors</b> are small areas where other pieces of information and sensors are placed in order to detect the presence of guns, explosive, etc. The general goals and the required environmental condition, allowed us to implement a detection system at lower costs and complexity, with respect to other existing techniques. The system consists of a fixed array of microwave transceiver modules, whose received signals are processed to collect information related to a sort of volume occupied in the <b>interlocked</b> <b>door</b> cabin. The proposed solution has been statistically validated by using statistical analysis. The whole solution has been also implemented to be used in a real time environment and thus validated against real experimental measures...|$|R
50|$|The {{streetcar}} {{companies also}} found that the safety features of the Birney, {{such as the use of}} <b>interlocked</b> <b>doors</b> to prevent the car from starting if a door was open or a passenger was stuck, could be incorporated in larger cars and that the public was not as disturbed by the absence of the conductor as the companies had feared.|$|R
5000|$|The main artwork in {{the station}} {{consists}} of murals designed by James Sutherland, entitled Spadina Summer Under All Seasons. Using thousands of pieces of glass, colourful mosaics of flowers were created directly into the station’s tiling. Two large mosaics of a giant flower in cross-section face {{each other across the}} tracks, reaching upward into a mezzanine level lined with smaller flower mosaics. Sculptor Ron Baird designed massive circular <b>interlocking</b> <b>doors</b> which provide access to the electrical substation, which is nestled behind the northwest entrance.|$|E
50|$|An orthotube is a capsule-like high {{security}} <b>interlocking</b> <b>door</b> allowing {{entry to}} a building or office by one authorised {{person at a}} time. Orthotubes are typically used by security and intelligence agencies, such as the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation and the United Kingdom Security Service to control access to buildings housing sensitive information. The devices appear in the BBC spy drama Spooks, {{in which they are}} referred to as pods.|$|R

50|$|Common {{applications}} of micro switches include the <b>door</b> <b>interlock</b> on a microwave oven, levelling and safety switches in elevators, vending machines, and to detect paper jams or other faults in photocopiers. Micro switches {{are commonly used}} in tamper switches on gate valves on fire sprinkler systems and other water pipe systems, where {{it is necessary to}} know if a valve has been opened or shut.|$|R
5000|$|The FP/FT {{units have}} a <b>door</b> <b>interlock</b> system, which {{prevents}} the driver applying power while the train doors are still open and unlocked. On the EM/ET units, drivers had to double-check the [...] "doors closed" [...] light was on before applying power, potentially leading to human error. This configuration {{led to an}} incident in March 2013 when three EM/ET units left Wingate station with their doors open and no passenger staff on board, after the driver mistakenly thought he heard the [...] "right-of-way" [...] buzzer.|$|R

2500|$|A {{miniature}} snap-action switch, also trademarked {{and frequently}} {{known as a}} micro switch, is an electric switch that is actuated by very little physical force, {{through the use of}} a tipping-point mechanism, sometimes called an [...] "over-center" [...] mechanism. Common applications of micro switches include the <b>door</b> <b>interlock</b> on a microwave oven, levelling and safety switches in elevators, vending machines, and to detect paper jams or other faults in photocopiers. The miniature snap-action switch was invented in 1932 by Peter McGall, who was an employee of the Burgess Battery Company in Freeport, Illinois.|$|R

50|$|Based on the Paris Métro's MP 59 rolling stock, the MR-63 were {{constructed}} by Canadian Vickers from 1965 - 1967 and was introduced on October 14, 1966 {{on the opening}} of the Montreal Metro, and are still in service. During this time the fleet has undergone numerous technological and reliability upgrades, starting with the introduction of Automatic Train Control in 1976 (with subsequent revisions of hardware and software), major refurbishments of the MR-63 coaches by GEC Alsthom at Pointe St. Charles workshops in 1993, solid-state <b>door</b> <b>interlocks</b> in 2003, modern ergonomic driver cabs with new digital dashboards, and automatic station announcements in 2005 (voiced by Michèle Deslauriers).|$|R
50|$|AS-Interface {{provides}} {{a basis for}} Functional Safety in machinery safety/emergency stop applications. Safety devices communicating over AS-Interface follow all the normal AS-Interface data rules. The required level of data verification is provided by dynamic changes in the data. This technology is called Safety at Work and allows safety devices and standard, non-safe devices {{to be connected to}} the same network. Using appropriate safe input hardware (e.g. light curtains, e-stop buttons, and <b>door</b> <b>interlock</b> switches), AS-Interface can provide safety support up to SIL (Safety Integrity Level) 3 according to EN 62061, CAT 4 according to EN954-1 as well as Performance Level e (PL e) according to EN ISO 13849-1.|$|R
50|$|In March 2012, TTC {{officials}} {{admitted that}} the door threshold incidents {{were the result of}} “teething issues”. Another issue that was acknowledged involves a short delay in opening of the doors when the train pulls into a station. On the older train models, the <b>door</b> release <b>interlock</b> could be triggered just before or immediately after the vehicle came to a complete stop. The TR trains must come to a complete stop with confirmation from the onboard computer before the <b>door</b> <b>interlock</b> can be released and the guard can open the doors. This causes a one- or two-second delay from the time the train appears stopped and the time the doors open.|$|R
5000|$|This model saw the {{introduction}} of a sliding side door added on both sides (although a version without the driver's side door remained available), with a full [...] "B" [...] pillar to enhance body stiffness instead of the approach used by the Nissan Prairie which had the front and rear <b>doors</b> <b>interlock.</b> Minor horsepower improvements were introduced in 1977 along with an increase in the width of the vehicle. A sunroof was added to the options list in 1979. 4WD was introduced as an option in 1980, on both the van and truck bodystyles, coinciding with the same feature being offered on the Subaru Rex.|$|R
50|$|The bow {{caps and}} {{shutters}} are mechanically {{linked to a}} hydraulically operated drive rod from within the torpedo compartment. The bow cap opens first behind the shutter, which then folds back against it forming a smooth exit tube. <b>Interlocks</b> prevent the <b>doors</b> at both ends being opened {{at the same time}} but the inner door is also provided with a test cock to check whether the tube is full of water before opening and remains held nearly closed by the swing bolt after the locking ring is released. The tube internal diameter is 22.5 in, wider than the torpedo, which is designed as a loose fit inside the tube. Torpedoes could be fired either electrically or with compressed air.|$|R
40|$|A Pit Disassembly and Conversion Facility (PDCF) will be {{built and}} {{operated}} at DOE'S Savannah River Site (SRS) in South Carolina. The facility will process over three metric tons of plutonium per year. There will be {{a significant amount of}} special nuclear material (SNM) moving through the various processing modules in the facility, and this will obviously require well-designed engineering controls to prevent criticality accidents. The PDCF control system will <b>interlock</b> glovebox entry <b>doors</b> closed if the correct amount of SNM has not been removed from the exit enclosure. These same engineering controls will also be used to verify that only plutonium goes to plutonium processing gloveboxes, enriched uranium goes to enriched uranium processing, and that neither goes into non-SNM processing gloveboxes...|$|R
5000|$|In 1875, Henry Spratt of Kent {{received}} a U.S. patent for a voting machine that presented the ballot as {{an array of}} push buttons, one per candidate. [...] Spratt's machine was designed for a typical British election with a single plurality race on the ballot. In 1881, Anthony Beranek of Chicago patented the first voting machine appropriate {{for use in a}} general election in the United States. [...] Beranek's machine presented an array of push buttons to the voter, with one row per office on the ballot, and one column per party. Interlocks behind each row prevented voting for more than one candidate per race, and an <b>interlock</b> with the <b>door</b> of the voting booth reset the machine for the next voter as each voter left the booth.|$|R
5000|$|The Isis uses {{a unique}} {{approach}} to the sliding doors in that the front passenger door and the rear passenger sliding <b>door</b> <b>interlock</b> when closed, instead of having a doorjamb that the doors attach to. Toyota calls this on the Japanese Wikipedia article [...] "Panoramic Door". This door system is used only on the passenger side. The doors on the driver's side attach with a conventional doorjamb. The front passenger seat can be folded flat upon itself and then tilted forward to further provide passenger access. The <b>doors</b> also <b>interlock</b> with {{the top and bottom}} door openings so that both doors can be opened independently of each other. This door feature was first used by Toyota on the Toyota Raum. This door approach is also used on the U.S.-spec 2000-2006 Toyota Tundra Extra Cab. This type of door was first used on the Nissan Prairie in 1981.|$|R
40|$|Recent safety {{analyses}} at nuclear explosive {{facilities have}} {{renewed interest in}} the accident phenomenology associated with explosions in nuclear explosive cells, which are {{commonly referred to as}} {open_quotes}Gravel Gerties. {close_quotes} The cells are used for the assembly and disassembly of nuclear explosives and are located in the Device Assembly Facility (DAF) at the Nevada Test Site (NTS) and at the Pantex facility. The cells are designed to mitigate the release of special nuclear material to the environment {{in the event of a}} detonation of high explosive within the Gravel Gertie. Although there are some subtle differences between the cells of DAF and Pantex, their general design, geometry, and configuration are similar. The cells consist of a round room approximately 10. 4 m in diameter and 5. 2 m high enclosed by 0. 3 -m-thick concrete. Each cell has a wire-rope cantenary roof overlain with gravel. The gravel is approximately 6. 9 m deep at the center of the roof and decreases toward the outer edge of the cell. The cell is connected to a corridor and subsequent rooms through an <b>interlocking</b> blast <b>door.</b> In the event of a accidental explosion involving significant amounts of high explosive, the roof structure is lifted by the force of the explosion, the supporting cables break, the gravel is lifted by the blast (resulting in rapid venting of the cell), and the gravel roof collapses, filling the cell. The lifting and subsequent collapse of the gravel, which acts much like a piston, is very challenging to model...|$|R
50|$|Because of the Piccadilly extensions, {{which were}} above ground, heaters were fitted, {{and the use}} of British {{materials}} in its construction was used for publicity purposes, {{at a time when there}} was an industrial depression. It became known as the 'All British' train, and operated on the Piccadilly and Northern lines. Transfer between the two was aided by the construction of a junction at Kings Cross in 1927. The Northern line offered heavier traffic, with which to assess the effectiveness of the new features. 62 production cars were ordered from Metropolitan-Cammell, which was formed from the Metropolitan Carriage Wagon and Finance Co. and Cammell Laird at this time, for delivery to the Bakerloo line. They replaced the Watford Joint Stock, which although relatively new, needed a larger crew and had to stop for longer at stations, because of its swing doors. Problems with the swing doors were highlighted by a fatal accident in which a passenger got caught in them, but the <b>door</b> <b>interlock</b> did not detect it.|$|R
50|$|An {{interlock}} is {{a feature}} that makes the state of two mechanisms or functions mutually dependent. It {{may be used to}} prevent undesired states in a finite-state machine, and may consist of any electrical, electronic, or mechanical devices or systems. In most applications, an interlock is used to help prevent a machine from harming its operator or damaging itself by preventing one element from changing state due to the state of another element, and vice versa. Elevators are equipped with an interlock that prevents the moving elevator from opening its doors, and prevents the stationary elevator (with open doors) from moving. Although both are idiot proof strategies, an interlock {{should not be confused with}} a simple safety switch. For example, in a typical household microwave oven, the switch that disables the magnetron if the door is opened is not an interlock. Rather, it would be considered an <b>interlock</b> if the <b>door</b> were locked while the magnetron is on, and the magnetron were prevented from operating while the <b>door</b> is open. <b>Interlocks</b> may include sophisticated elements such as curtains of infrared beams, photodetectors, a computer containing an interlocking computer program, digital or analogue electronics, or simple switches and locks.|$|R
50|$|On a gate stock train, each of {{the cars}} had its own conductor, who was {{responsible}} for the operation of the doors on that car. It was originally planned to work the air operated doors in a similar fashion, but the method adopted was for all the doors on a 3-car train to be controlled by a guard {{at the rear of the}} motor car. This reduced the number of staff needed to operate a 6-car train from seven to three, consisting of a driver, a rear guard and a front guard. Each guard controlled the doors on the three cars at his end of the train. The cars were initially fitted with yellow flipper arms, which protruded from the side of the vehicle when a door was open, and enabled staff to identify doors which had not yet closed. The design was unsatisfactory, and the arms were replaced by indicator lamps interlocked to the air engines in 1924. Traction control circuits and door operating circuits were carried along the train by 10-core jumpers fitted at roof height between the cars. There were two lighting circuits, one fed from {{each of the}} motor cars. It was possible to operate a 3-car train, but in order to do so, a shorting plug had to be fitted to the control trailer, to connect the lighting circuits, and to complete the <b>door</b> <b>interlock</b> circuit.|$|R
40|$|Tuberculosis is a {{major concern}} in low- and middle-income countries, but may be {{diagnosed}} using standard chest x-rays. Conventional film-screen x-ray detectors require more maintenance than digital x-ray detectors and need a good supply chain of developer chemicals and film, which make them difficult to maintain in low-infrastructure areas of the world. Current digital x-ray technology is prohibitively expensive for this market, although it brings the possibility of tele-radiology and tele-medicine, quicker diagnosis time, and virtually no cost per test compared to other diagnostics for tuberculosis. This thesis examines the requirements on a small-sized, low-cost digital x-ray detector for this application. Two small x-ray detectors were integrated into x-ray systems, then characterized for detector performance using metrics known as modulation transfer function, noise power spectrum, and detective quantum efficiency. The system designs and the results of the experiments are shown. Details are also shown about the setup of the x-ray lab, including the <b>door</b> <b>interlock</b> system for a lead-lined x-ray cabinet. To determine whether a smaller x-ray detector is diagnostically accurate enough for tuberculosis diagnosis compared to full-size chest radiography equipment, a medical study was designed and run using a web-based survey of radiologists in Pakistan, where tuberculosis is a recognized disease. In an attempt to compare x-ray detector performance, MATLAB code was written to measure the modulation transfer function, noise power spectrum, and detective quantum efficiency of x-ray systems. The details about this code, and challenges in simulating the performance of physically different detectors are explained in the thesis...|$|R
40|$|The {{control of}} {{perchloroethylene}} (127184) (PERC) exposure in commercial dry cleaning through ventilation was reviewed. Health hazards associated with PERC included {{central nervous system}} depression, liver and kidney damage, memory impairment, dermatitis, respiratory irritation, and other symptoms. Effective ventilation {{was considered to be}} one of the least expensive engineering measures for reducing worker exposures to PERC. Ventilation was used for controlling PERC exposures and thermal comfort, both of which were important in dry cleaning shops. Possible ventilation methods included local exhaust ventilation and general ventilation. Local exhaust ventilation (LEV) captured and removed the contaminant at or near the source of release, thereby reducing vapor levels in the worker's breathing zone and minimizing vapor diffusion. PERC vapor exposures were greatest during machine maintenance and loading and unloading. LEV implemented at the loading and unloading door was usually activated by a <b>door</b> <b>interlocking</b> system. The retrofitting of an external ventilation hood outside the machine door was an option for older machines lacking built in exhaust ventilation. General ventilation diluted the concentration of the contaminant before it reached the breathing zone of the worker. It was used to supply conditioned fresh air and exhaust contaminated air from the general work area. A workroom air exchange every 5 minutes involving sufficient volumes of make up air was recommended. Systems of emergency ventilation were needed to control solvent vapors resulting from solvent spills or leaks. " - NIOSHTIC- 2 [principal contributors, Gary S. Earnest, Charles S. Hayden, Daniel S.
