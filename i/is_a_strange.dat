25|$|In 1921, {{the remains}} of the estate – {{comprising}} the house and 329 acres of land – were taken up by Lt. Col. Stephen Hungerford Pollen CMG (1868–1935) after a career in the British Army, having been ADC to Lords Lansdowne and Elgin (respective Viceroys of India), winning medals for service in that country and South Africa, and serving in the Tirah Expedition in 1897. His family were the first residents to enjoy an electricity supply and water from the mains (the heating had, by this time, been converted to an oil-fired system). There remained a full complement of eleven or twelve – by differing accounts – indoor staff {{for the duration of the}} Pollens' time at Hammerwood, and he contributed the land (and a quarter of the building costs) for the building of the Hammerwood and Holtye Hall. It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> coincidence that one of Lt. Col. Pollen's ancestors, Richard Pollen (brother of Sir John Pollen, Bt.) married the daughter of S. P. Cockerell, the architect under whom Latrobe studied. After the death of Lt. Col. Pollen in 1935, the Kirwan Taylor family bought Hammerwood; they were the owners when the Second World War broke out. Like many large houses, it was requisitioned for use by the armed forces, becoming home to 200 soldiers (including the cricketer Denis Compton, and a contingent from the Canadian Army). No. 660 Squadron RAF operated from an airstrip to the north of the park from November 1943, and the SOE flew Westland Lysanders from the same strip for a time.|$|E

Whatever, it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> phenomenon." ...|$|E

500|$|Joplin's [...] "last period" [...] <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> {{collection}} of contradictions. Some of his rags reach more toward concert music than did any Jazz up to Lennie Tristano's, while others seem {{to revert to}} his 1900 style. [...] Profoundly ambitious passages lie {{side by side with}} meaningless, mechanical ditties. It is not hard to find in these compositions a reflection of approaching derangement—he lost his mind in 1916.|$|E
500|$|Not {{long after}} the {{establishment}} of the Fourth Degree, during the nadir of American race relations, a bogus oath was circulated claiming that Fourth Degree Knights swore to exterminate Freemasons and Protestants. In addition, they purportedly were prepared to flay, burn alive, boil, kill, and otherwise torture anyone, including women and children, when called upon to do so by church authorities. [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> paradox", according to some commentators, that the degree devoted to patriotism should be accused of anti-Americanism.|$|E
500|$|At [...] "The Three Pigeons" [...] inn, it is a {{good day}} for some: the miser Boomblehardt has been out {{collecting}} rents from his tenants, and Sergeant Klooque, hero of Johannesburg, has just arrived at the inn on leave and may now flirt with any lady he chooses, without the need to pretend they are his relatives to get around his tyrannical Colonel. However, it is not a good day for Martha, the landlady of the inn: staying there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> old lady, a mischievous fairy, who refuses to pay or to leave, and who needs neither food nor water. This is substantially cutting into Martha's profits. She enlists Boomblehardt and Klooque, the cowardly farmer Peter, and her extremely shy niece, Pipette, to help solve this problem.|$|E

500|$|The {{play was}} {{described}} by The Times as a [...] "strange free-wheeling piece {{about a man who}} has said goodbye to the world and simply shut himself up in his room." [...] The reviewer added [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> unpredictable world Mr. Jones conjures up and Mr. Saville, with the aid of an excellent cast (Miss Maureen Pryor and Miss Ursula Howells were particularly good) and some haunting songs by Mr. Bob Dylan, brought it powerfully to life." [...] The Observer, in 2005, reports that the play [...] "got stinking reviews" [...] according to folk singer Martin Carthy, adding that the Western Daily Mail reviewer was [...] "baffled" [...] and The Listener had [...] "noted that Dylan had 'sat around playing and singing attractively, if a little incomprehensibly'".|$|E
500|$|Truth or Square {{received}} generally mixed critical {{response from}} critics and fans, and was criticized mainly {{due to the}} [...] "Patchy the Pirate" [...] segments. Paul Mavis from DVD Talk said [...] "Truth or Square <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> mix of some truly memorable animated SpongeBob moments interrupted unfortunately by the largely unfunny Patchy the Pirate segments." [...] He added [...] "All of those amusing moments in Truth or Square, along with the A Charlie Brown Christmas ending, make one forget the patchy Patchy segments in Truth or Square." [...] Roy Hrab of DVD Verdict gave the episode a negative review saying [...] "Wow... This is without a doubt the lamest SpongeBob episode I have ever seen In fact, nothing interesting happens at all. The Patchy interludes and reliance on cameos merely {{draws attention to the}} episode's lack of substance." ...|$|E
500|$|During Howard's solo concerts from 1983to 1999, [...] "Shivers" [...] was {{the song}} most {{requested}} by audience members. However, {{by the time}} of his final tour in 2009—the year he died—he had stopped receiving requests for it. In an October 2009 interview, Howard commented on his relationship with the song, and its position in his setlists, stating: [...] "I have just tried, perhaps finally successfully, to divorce myself from the song. It's impossible for me to recreate what I was trying to do when I wrote that song so whilst I can see that people have an attachment to it, I don't. I feel like, when I did use to do it in shows, I was doing a cover of some song that had been around forever. That's how it felt. And I guess that <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> way to feel about a song you wrote, so yeah, I am happy to not have to do it these days".|$|E

500|$|In its {{original}} broadcast, [...] "The Telltale Head" [...] finished twenty-sixth in {{ratings for the}} week of February 19–25, 1990, with a Nielsen rating of 15.2, equivalent to approximately 14.0 million viewing households. It was the second highest-rated show on the Fox network that week, following Married... with Children. Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood said they enjoyed: [...] "the Simpsons [...] grossly dysfunctional in church, Homer dispensing terrible advice, and a real moral dilemma for Bart." [...] In a DVD review of the first season, David B. Grelck gave the episode a rating of 3/5 and added, [...] "This <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> episode, touching on many bizarre aspects of the show to come." [...] Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide said, [...] "Good little moments abounded, {{and this was a}} generally solid episode. I liked the objects the boys saw in the clouds, and quite a few other funny bits appeared. “Telltale” wasn’t a great episode, but it was generally entertaining and clever." ...|$|E
500|$|Boulter {{starred in}} two films in 2008, Daylight Robbery by filmmaker Paris Leonti, and Donkey Punch {{directed}} by Olly Blackburn. Boulter portrayed a character named [...] "Sean" [...] in Donkey Punch, who tags along with character [...] "Josh" [...] as the [...] "quiet brother ... who hits {{it off with}} Tammi". Boulter guest starred on a two-part episode arc [...] "Wounds" [...] in May 2008 of the television series Waking the Dead as character [...] "Jimmy Dearden". He appeared on the television series Survivors as [...] "Neil" [...] in November 2008. He had a recurring role in ten episodes of the television series Casualty in 2010, as [...] "Kieron Fletcher". He portrayed an emergency physician applying for a medical fellowship. He commented on the inherent difficulties in portraying a physician on television: [...] "Playing a doctor <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> experience. Pretending you know what you're talking about when you don't is very bizarre but there are advisers on set who are fantastic at taking you through procedures and giving you the confidence to stand there and look like you know what you're doing." [...] Boulter starred in the 2011 film Mercenaries directed by Paris Leonti.|$|E
500|$|The player {{starts in}} Atrus' old study on K'veer, an island near {{the ruins of}} the main D'ni city; in the {{antechamber}} outside the study, there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> tablet locked in place on an altar. Yeesha links in and explains that legends state that in order to fully restore D'ni, someone known as the Grower must utilize the tablet. The artifact has the ability to fully control a mysterious enslaved race known as the Bahro. As Yeesha made the wrong decision upon unlocking the tablet, she can no longer use it; Yeesha instead charges the player with uncovering the tablet's power. After leaving Yeesha, the player meets a man named Esher near [...] "the Great Shaft", connecting D'ni to the surface (as detailed in [...] ). Esher is a survivor of the fall of D'ni and tells the player that Yeesha cannot be trusted, warning the player not to give her the Tablet. Throughout the Great Shaft, the player collects twelve fragments of Yeesha's journal. The writings appear to confirm Esher's warnings, as the narration seemingly indicates that Yeesha has descended into madness, believing herself to be the Grower.|$|E

500|$|While rejecting this {{thematic}} {{concern as}} unrealized by Argento, McDonagh {{noted that the}} result of the director's experiment <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> [...] "architectural landscape" [...] that becomes the [...] "key element in differentiating Tenebrae from Argento's earlier gialli." [...] Argento's use of unusual architectural space and so-called visual [...] "hyper-realism" [...] results in an enormously fake looking environment. Seizing on the director's additional comment, [...] "...I dreamed an imaginary city in which the most amazing things happen", she notes that the film's [...] "fictive space couldn't be less 'real'", with its [...] "vast unpopulated boulevards, piazzas that look like nothing more than suburban American malls, hard-edged Bauhaus apartment buildings, anonymous clubs and parking garages." [...] The EUR district of Rome, where much of Tenebrae was filmed, was built in preparation for the 1942 World's Fair, and intended by then-Prime Minister of Italy Benito Mussolini to be a celebration of twenty years of fascism. Rostock believes that Argento used this location as an attempt to realize his theme of an imaginary city; the district gives a glimpse of a future Rome that never was, showing the city how it might have looked had fascism not fallen.|$|E
500|$|Escape from New York {{opened in}} New York and Los Angeles July 10, 1981. The film grossed $25.2 million in American theaters in summer 1981. The film {{received}} generally positive reviews. In August 2016, {{it had a}} rating of 85 percent on Rotten Tomatoes, with the critical consensus [...] "Featuring an atmospherically grimy futuristic metropolis, Escape from New York <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>strange,</b> entertaining jumble of thrilling action and oddball weirdness". Newsweek magazine wrote [...] " [...] deeply ingrained B-movie sensibility- which is both his strength and limitation. He does clean work, but settles for too little. He uses Russell well, however". In Time magazine, Richard Corliss wrote, [...] "John Carpenter is offering this summer's moviegoers a rare opportunity: {{to escape from the}} air-conditioned torpor of ordinary entertainment into the hothouse humidity of their own paranoia. It's a trip worth taking". Vincent Canby, in his review for The New York Times, wrote, [...] " [...] is not to be analyzed too solemnly, though. It's a toughly told, very tall tale, one of the best escape (and escapist) movies of the season." [...] In his review for the Chicago Reader, Dave Kehr, wrote [...] "it fails to satisfy–it gives us too little of too much".|$|E
500|$|On 4 January 1922, South Georgia was sighted, {{and late}} that morning Quest {{anchored}} at Grytviken. After visiting the whaling establishment ashore, Shackleton {{returned to the}} ship apparently refreshed. He told Frank Wild that they would celebrate their deferred Christmas the next day, and retired to his cabin to write his diary. [...] "The old smell of dead whale permeates everything", he wrote. [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> and curious place....A wonderful evening. In the darkening twilight I saw a lone star hover, gem like above the bay." [...] Later he slept, and was heard snoring by the surgeon McIlroy, who had just finished his watch-keeping duty. Shortly after 2a.m. {{on the morning of}} 5 January, Macklin, who had taken over the watch, was summoned to Shackleton's cabin. He found Shackleton complaining of back pains and severe facial neuralgia, and asking for a painkilling drug. In a brief discussion, Macklin told his leader that he had been overdoing things, and needed to lead a more regular life. Macklin records Shackleton as saying: [...] "You're always wanting me to give up things, what is it I ought to give up?" [...] Macklin replied [...] "Chiefly alcohol, Boss, I don't think it agrees with you." [...] Immediately afterwards Shackleton [...] "had a very severe paroxysm, during which he died".|$|E
