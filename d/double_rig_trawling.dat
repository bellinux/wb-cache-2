40|$|This paper {{provides}} a general feasibility study on <b>double</b> <b>rigged</b> versus single <b>rigged</b> <b>trawls.</b> This study used model experimental nets {{tested in a}} circulating water tank. Three kinds of trawls were tested, i. e. the Mexican semi ballon <b>double</b> <b>rigged</b> shrimp <b>trawl</b> designed by Nichimo (hereafter called net A), the traditional two seam single <b>rigged</b> Malaysian shrimp <b>trawl</b> (net B) and the four seam trawl modified from the above Malaysian trawl (net C). The head rope length of net A is about half that of net B and net C. Primary objectives are to determine physical characteristics, working performance and to estimate the main engine output necessary to pull these nets. To provide a <b>double</b> <b>rigged</b> shrimp <b>trawl</b> in the Malaysian shrimp fisheries, results of experiments are summarised as follows: 1) At 2 knots, which is a normal towing speed of a Malaysian shrimp trawler, net mouth height of net A is 1. 2 meter, net B is 2 meter and net C is 1. 8 meter. In accordance to the behaviour of shrimp, these net mouth height are sufficient. 2) In order to ensure {{the security of the}} catch, the most efficient average mesh opening was determined to be five vertical cross-sections. The mesh opening is bigger at the square panel and becomes smaller towards the cod end. The opening is about 3 centimeter for 5. 7 centimeter mesh size. 3) The wing tip spread of net A is 11 meter, which is 80 % of its head rope length. Net B is 14 meter (55 %) and net C is 14. 4 meter (60 %). 4) The working performance of a shrimp trawl is determined by its sweeping area. The obtained experimental equations of the sweeping area of the three net are slimplified as follows: 2 net A: A's= 2. 18 Vnet B: A"s= 1. 57 Vnet C: A‴s= 1. 58 V 5) The estimation of suitable main engine output necessary to pull the net is calculated from the conversion of total gear drag force values to horse power values. Equations of the above power of the three nets are: 2 net A: EHP'= 12. 19 V^ net B: EHP"= 11. 01 V^ net C: EHP‴= 10. 89 V< 2. 61...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} carried out {{for the purpose of}} {{determining}} some physical characteristics of scale model of the balloon type <b>double</b> <b>rigged</b> shrimp <b>trawl</b> gear in the experimental tank. The net model was constructed in accordance with Dr. Tauti's similarity-law of fishing gear. The measurements were carried out both on the shapes and on the resistances in seven stages of towing velocity (V). For the convenience of discussions, the experimental values were converted into full scale values. Results were obtained as in the following: 1) Under the consideration of the physical characteristics of the gear efficiency, we have some parameters obtained as net mouth height (H), net mouth area (A), and wing tip distance (W). The above parameters are represented as in the following: H= 2. 7 V^ A= 0. 016 V^ W= 2 V+ 10. 6 In the discussions of shrimp trawl gear efficiency, it is better for us to use the sweep area parameter of the gear (S_A), than to use the filtering volume (F_v).

Recent innovations in <b>trawl</b> design and <b>rigging,</b> including the twin <b>trawl</b> <b>rigging</b> and tongue <b>trawl</b> design, have improved the efficiency of shrimp trawling gear. A description of the construction techniques for the different designs indicate differences which affect gear performance. Measurements of horizontal spread and vertical opening for 76 trawl configurations indicate the relative efficiencies of the different designs. Maximum horizontal spreading efficiency was achieved by the "twin" and "tongue" trawl designs followed by the super X- 3, jib, balloon, and semiballoon designs. Designs having the greatest vertical openings were the tongue and flat trawl designs followed by the semiballoon. Maximum total gape dimension was demonstrated by the "Mongoose" tongue trawl. Comparison of trawl spreading efficiency and door area to headrope length ratio indicates that a range of 70 - 80 in square (per door) of door area is required for each foot of trawl headrope length for maximum efficiency with conventional trawl designs and 66 - 75 in square per foot of headrope for tongue trawl designs.

40|$|In Brazil, an {{industrial}} trawling fishery directed to Euvola ziczac started in 1973 and collapsed after 1980, when scallop landings reached 8, 800 t. Since 1995 E. ziczac landings have not surpassed {{a few hundred}} kilograms. Based on surveys carried out in 1974 - 1975 and in 1995 - 1996, this work assesses temporal changes occurred in scallop distribution and relative abundance patterns and analyzes the current stock situation under the present management regimes applied to the local demersal trawling fishery. In the 1970 ’s E. ziczac was concentrated in a main bed extending from southern São Paulo to northern Santa Catarina States and between 30 and 50 m depth. This pattern changed dramatically during the 1990 ’s, when only two very small and low-density concentrations {{were found in the}} region. Cumulative effects of reducing areas and density within the remnant concentrations produced a reduction in the stock biomass of 98 %. Management of the local <b>double</b> <b>rig</b> trawler fishery has always focused on its first main target, the shrimps Farfantepenaeus paulensis and F. brasiliensis. Additional measures have not been implemented, even after substantial part of the fleet has directed its effort to alternative shelf and slope resources. The collapse of the Brazilian scallop fishery provides a striking example of irreversible damage caused by uncontrolled fishing redirection allocated to other resources, demonstrating the need of changes in the Brazilian demersal fishery management model.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a {{rational}} viscous Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) methodology applied to sailing yacht rig aerodynamic design and analysis. After an outlook of present challenges in high speed sailing we emphasized the necessity of innovation and Computational Fluid Dynamics to think, validate and optimize new aero-hydrodynamic concepts. Then we present our CFD methodology through CAD, mesh generation, numerical and physical modelling choices and their validation on typical rig configurations through wind-tunnel tests comparisons. The methodology defined, we illustrate the relevance and wide potential of advanced numerical tools to investigate sailing yacht rig design questions like the relation between sail camber, propulsive force and aerodynamic finesse, and like the mast-mainsail non linear interaction. Through these examples, it is shown how sailing yacht rig improvements may be drawn by using viscous CFD (RANS). Then the extensive use of viscous CFD based on Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes equations rather than wind-tunnel tests on scaled models for the evaluation or ranking of improved design open the door to time saving. The last part illustrates on a preliminary study of the Y. Parlier Hydraplaneur <b>double</b> <b>rig</b> how the proposed CFD methodology may be applied to this complex largely unknown rig. We show how it is possible to increase our understanding of his flow physics with strong sails interactions and we hope this will open new roads toward optimized design. Along the paper, the necessary mutual comparison presented between CFD and wind-tunnel test will be also the occasion to focus on limitations and drawbacks of viscous CFD tools to discuss them and address their future improvements...|$|R

A distribuição espacial também é variável com maiores capturas no transecto II. Indivíduos imaturos predominam nos transectos mais internos e mais próximos da influência estuarina. Indivíduos adultos predominam nos transectos centrais e mais próximos à boca da enseada e fêmeas ovígeras são mais abundantes nos transectos interpretados como sendo aqueles que facilitariam a dispersão das larvas em direção ao mar aberto (transectos I e II).

It was captured 921 individuals distributed in 570 immature, 247 adult males, 63 females and 41 adult non-ovigerous females. There is a clear pattern of temporal variation in abundance, positively related to changes in water temperature. The spatial distribution is also variable with the greatest catches in transect II. Immature individuals predominate in transects that are innermost and closer to estuarine influence. Adults individuals predominate in transects central and closer to the mouth of the cove, and ovigerous females are more abundant in transects interpreted as those that facilitate the dispersal of larvae toward open ocean (transects I and II). Males are larger than females and the LC 50 values were 52. 2 mm CW and 48. 1 mm CW, respectively. The sex ratio varies spatially with predominance of females only in transect I, and also varies for different demographic groups. Amongst young individuals, the proportion does not differ from the observed ratio of 1 : 1, while males predominate among adults. This suggests that the imbalance between the sexes is conducted after maturity, and might be related to differential displacement patterns of males and females during reproductive activities.

The <b>double</b> panel <b>rig</b> consists of a thin aluminium panel and a honeycomb trim panel, coupled acoustically by the air cavity between them and structurally by four elastic mounts. Nine small-scale electromagnetic actuators are mounted in the cavity such that they can react against the two panels. A pair of velocity sensors is added at the two actuator-panel junction points. The two velocity signals are first asymmetrically weighted and then subtracted to form the error signal. Finally, the error signal is fed back to the actuator via a constant amplification gain. In this way the control loops produce a combination of relative and sky-hook active damping, which tends to reduce the response and sound radiation of the double panel at low resonance frequencies. The stability and performance of the control system are analyzed experimentally {{as a function of}} the weighting factor.

However, unacceptable commercial losses of sole (Solea solea L.) and damage to the BRP as a consequence of suboptimal and unsuitable rigging in the traditional beam trawl with chain mat, is hampering a successful introduction in commercial beam-trawl fisheries.

The achievements in the project have been possible because of extensive cooperation between the scientific and industrial partners. This report briefly describes the activities {{carried out in the}} MultiSEPT project in 2013. Full scale tests of the semi circular spreading gear (SCSG) showed that this ground gear was easy to rig and operate, its geometry was stable during towing and it had good bottom contact. The spreading (distance between wing-ends) was approximately 7 % higher with the SCSG than with the rockhopper gear for the same gear and door spreading. The SCSG had good bottom contact and passed bottom obstacles (e. g. stones) easily. The size distribution of fish caught with the SCSG was very similar to that caught with the rockhopper. However, the number of hauls performed with the SCSG and with the rockhopper was too small to draw a clear conclusion on catch efficiency. The SCSG is a gear that is easy to rig and handle on deck, it does not require accurate adjustments, it has few control points and low weight, and the results indicate that its performance at sea is at least comparable to the rockhopper gear for given bottom conditions. Further development of the SCSG should emphasise on improving the construction materials used today in oder to reduce the wearing and increase its lifetime. Two full scale tests were carried out in spring and autum 2013 to assess the effect of sweep length on herding of fish during semi-pelagic trawling for cod and haddock. The results showed that sweep length can {{have a significant effect on}} the catches. Fixing the 450 -kg chain weights right in front of the ground gear captured in up to 50 % less cod and up to 60 % haddock (of all sizes) than when the chain weights were fixed 45 m in front of the ground gear. These results demonstrate that at least under the conditions encountered in these trials, the sweeps have a major role on the fish herding process of the gear. The state estimator model (the core of of the Roll Royce Marine's e-Trawling system) was compared with data from small scale tests in SINTEF's test tank in Hirtshals, Denmark, carried out in July 2013. The results showed that the model apparently works well. The state estimator model is currently being validated against acoustic sensor data from full scale trials with semi-pelagic trawling carried out in November 2013. A concept for remote control of existing trawl doors, which is based on manipulating the moment Balance of the trawl doors, has been designed by SINTEF. This is achieved using control lines between points on the trawl door and external lines (warps or bridles). By tensioning such lines, the orientation of the trawl door is controlled, which again is used to control the hydrodynamic forces created by the trawl door. The energy consumption of this concept is greatly reduced by changing the <b>rigging</b> of the <b>trawl</b> door to reduce its stability. A pair of 0. 6 m 2 Injector XF 9 semi-pelagic doors are currently being instrumeted with actuator and will be tested in Hirtshals' flume tank in early 2014. Semi-pelagic shrimp trawling showed approx. 6 - 8 % lower fuel consumption than bottom shrimp trawling. The 2. 5 m 2 semi-pelagic doors tested during our trials were overdimensioned for the coastal trawler "Gullholmen", and they had to be set at the lowest angle of attack to reduce spreading force and match that of the bottom trawl doors normally used by the vessel. A set of smaller doors (approx. 2 m 2) would had been a better choice to achieve the spreading force necessary for a 1500 # shrimp trawl. This would have reduced the fuel consumption even more. Shrimp catches were too low (15 – 45 kg/hour) and very variable from haul to haul to draw any conclusion on the fishing efficiency of the gear with the different sets of doors. Further experiments with coastal shrimp trawlers are planned for winter 2014...|$|R
