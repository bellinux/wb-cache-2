500|$|Ralph Sharon and Bennett parted ways in 1965. [...] There {{was great}} {{pressure}} on singers such as Lena Horne and Barbra Streisand to record [...] "contemporary" [...] rock songs, {{and in this}} vein, Columbia Records' Clive Davis suggested that Bennett do the same. Bennett was very reluctant, and when <b>he</b> <b>tried,</b> <b>the</b> results pleased no one. This was exemplified by Tony Sings the Great Hits of Today! (1970), before which Bennett became physically ill {{at the thought of}} recording. It featured misguided attempts at Beatles and other current songs and a ludicrous psychedelic art cover.|$|E

500|$|Noé {{had tried}} various {{hallucinogens}} in his youth, and used those experiences as {{inspiration for the}} visual style. Later, when the director was already planning the film, <b>he</b> <b>tried</b> <b>the</b> psychoactive brew ayahuasca, in which the active substance is DMT. This {{was done in the}} Peruvian jungle, where the brew is legal due to its traditional use as an entheogen. Noé described the experience as very intense, and said he regarded it [...] "almost like professional research." [...] Since few on the design team had ever taken a hallucinogen, it was necessary for Noé to collect and provide visual references in the forms of paintings, photographs, music videos, and excerpts from films. One reference used was the works of biologist Ernst Haeckel, whose drawings influenced the organic patterns seen during Oscar's visions.|$|E
500|$|Stratton tried {{variations}} of the experiment {{over the next few}} years. First he wore the glasses for eight days, back at Berkeley. The first day he was nauseated and the inverted landscape felt unreal, but by the second day just his own body position seemed strange, and by day seven, things felt normal. A sense of strangeness returned when the glasses were taken out, though the world looked straight side up; he found himself reaching out with the right hand when he should have used the left, and the other way around. Then <b>he</b> <b>tried</b> <b>the</b> experiment outdoors. [...] He also tried another experiment disrupting the mental link between touch and sight. There he wore a set of mirrors attached to a harness as shown in the figure allowing, and forcing, him to see his body from above. He found the senses adapted in a similar way over three days. His interpretation was that we build up an association between sight and touch by associational learning over a period of time. During certain periods, the disconnect between vision and touch made him feel as if his body was not where his touch and proprioceptive feeling told him it was. This out-of-body experience, caused by an altered but normal sensory perception, vanished when he attended to the issue critically, focusing on the disconnect.|$|E
500|$|The {{death in}} 1135 of HenryI left England with a disputed succession; {{although}} {{the king had}} persuaded his most powerful barons to swear support for the Empress Matilda, {{just a few days}} after Henry's death Stephen of Blois arrived from France to lay claim to the throne. The importance of the city and its Tower is marked by the speed at which he secured London. The castle, which had not been used as a royal residence for some time, was usually left in the charge of a Constable, a post held at this time by Geoffrey de Mandeville. As the Tower was considered an impregnable fortress in a strategically important position, possession was highly valued. Mandeville exploited this, selling his allegiance to Matilda after Stephen was captured in 1141 at the Battle of Lincoln. Once her support waned, the following year he resold his loyalty to Stephen. Through his role as Constable of the Tower, Mandeville became [...] "the richest and most powerful man in England". When <b>he</b> <b>tried</b> <b>the</b> same ploy again, this time holding secret talks with Matilda, Stephen had him arrested, forced him to cede control of his castles, and replaced him with one of his most loyal supporters. Until then the position had been hereditary, originally held by Geoffrey de Mandeville (a friend of William the Conqueror's and ancestor of the Geoffrey that Stephen and Matilda dealt with), but the position's authority was such that from then on it remained {{in the hands of an}} appointee of the monarch. The position was usually given to someone of great importance, who might not always be at the castle due to other duties. Although the Constable was still responsible for maintaining the castle and its garrison, from an early stage he had a subordinate to help with this duty: the Lieutenant of the Tower. Constables also had civic duties relating to the city. Usually they were given control of the city and were responsible for levying taxes, enforcing the law and maintaining order. The creation in 1191 of the position of Lord Mayor of London removed many of the Constable's civic powers, and at times led to friction between the two.|$|E

Griffin burned down the boarding house he was staying in, along with all the equipment he used to turn invisible, to cover his tracks; but he soon realised that he was ill-equipped to survive in the open. He attempted to steal food and clothes from a large department store, and eventually stole some clothing from a theatrical supply shop and headed to Iping to attempt to reverse the invisibility. Now he imagines that he can make Kemp his secret confederate, describing his plan to begin a [...] "Reign of Terror" [...] by using his invisibility to terrorise the nation.|$|E

2500|$|While {{not finding}} his own {{experiences}} with MDMA particularly powerful, Shulgin {{was impressed with}} the drug's disinhibiting effects and thought it could be useful in therapy. Believing MDMA allowed users to strip away habits and perceive the world clearly, Shulgin called the drug [...] "window". Shulgin occasionally used MDMA for relaxation, referring to it as [...] "my low-calorie martini", and gave the drug to friends, researchers, and others who he thought could benefit from it. One such person was Leo Zeff, a psychotherapist who had been known to use psychedelic substances in his practice. When <b>he</b> <b>tried</b> <b>the</b> drug in 1977, Zeff {{was impressed with the}} effects of MDMA and came out of his semi-retirement to promote its use in therapy. Over the following years, Zeff traveled around the US and occasionally to Europe, eventually training an estimated four thousand psychotherapists in the therapeutic use of MDMA. Zeff named the drug [...] "Adam", believing it put users in a state of primordial innocence.|$|E
2500|$|On 6 July 1988 John Stephens, {{a relief}} tanker driver working for Bristol-based {{distribution}} firm ISC, arrived at Lowermoor Water Treatment Works on Bodmin Moor {{and found it}} unmanned. Being unfamiliar with the location, {{he had been given}} a key by another driver and told simply that [...] "once inside the gate, the aluminium sulphate tank is on the left". However, the key fitted almost every lock used by the South West Water Authority (SWWA). After twenty minutes looking for the correct tank <b>he</b> <b>tried</b> <b>the</b> key on a manhole cover and when it unlocked believed he had accessed the correct tank. He poured the load of 20 tonnes of aluminium sulphate, used to remove solid particles from raw water, into the tank, which actually held treated water prior to distribution to the consumers in Camelford. This immediately contaminated the water supply to 20,000 local people and up to 10,000 tourists. The maximum recorded aluminium concentration was 620 milligrams per litre compared with the maximum concentration admissible at the time by the European Community of 0.2 milligrams per litre.|$|E
2500|$|His {{circle of}} friends expanded, though he never {{seems to have been}} {{particularly}} close with any but the Lambs and to an extent Leigh Hunt and the painter Benjamin Robert Haydon. His low tolerance for any who, he thought, had abandoned the cause of liberty, along with his frequent outspokenness, even tactlessness, in social situations made it difficult for many to feel close to him, and at times <b>he</b> <b>tried</b> <b>the</b> patience of even Charles Lamb. In The Examiner in late 1814, Hazlitt was the first to provide a critique of Wordsworth's poem The Excursion (Hazlitt's review appeared weeks before Francis Jeffrey's notorious dismissal of the poem with the words [...] "This will never do"). He lavished extreme praise on the poet—and equally extreme censure. While praising the poem's sublimity and intellectual power, he took to task the intrusive egotism of its author. Clothing landscape and incident with the poet's personal thoughts and feelings suited this new sort of poetry very well; but his abstract philosophical musing too often steered the poem into didacticism, a leaden counterweight to its more imaginative flights. Wordsworth, who seems to have been unable to tolerate anything less than unqualified praise, was enraged, and relations between the two became cooler than ever.|$|E
