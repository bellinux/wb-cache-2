5|$|The {{success and}} {{expansion}} of Islam brought it into contact with different cultures, societies and traditions, {{such as those of}} Byzantines and Persians. With such contact, new problems emerged for Islamic law to tackle. Moreover, there was a significant distance between Medina, the Islamic capital, and the Muslims on the periphery on the Islamic state. Thus far off jurists had to find novel Islamic solutions without the close supervision of the hub of Islamic law (back in Medina). During the Umayyad dynasty, the concept of qiyas was abused by the rulers. The Abbasids, who succeeded the Umayyads defined <b>it</b> <b>more</b> strictly, in an attempt to apply <b>it</b> <b>more</b> consistently.|$|E

5|$|A 1920s {{adaptation}} {{created by}} the Stempel Type Foundry and released for hot metal typesetting by Linotype, that has remained popular. It is sharp, somewhat angular design with a crisp hook rather than a teardrop at top left of the 'a'. Stempel Garamond has relatively short descenders, allowing it to be particularly tightly linespaced. An unusual feature is the digit 0, which has reversed contrast, with the thickest points of {{the number on the}} top and bottom of the digit to make <b>it</b> <b>more</b> distinguishable from a 'o'. The Klingspor Museum credits it to Stempel's head of typeface development Dr. Rudolf Wolf.|$|E
5|$|A {{conservative}} Washington D.C. think tank, and a Republican {{member of}} Congress, among others, {{have claimed that}} Gore has a conflict-of-interest for advocating for taxpayer subsidies of green-energy technologies {{in which he has}} a personal investment. Additionally, he has been criticized for his above-average energy consumption in using private jets, and in owning multiple, very large homes, one of which was reported in 2007 as using high amounts of electricity. Gore's spokesperson responded by stating that the Gores use renewable energy which is more expensive than regular energy and that the Tennessee house in question has been retrofitted to make <b>it</b> <b>more</b> energy-efficient.|$|E

Advances in genetic engineering technologies {{make it possible}} to introduce foreign DNA into the mosquito genome and either decrease the lifespan of the mosquito, or make <b>it</b> <b>more</b> resistant to the malaria parasite. Sterile insect technique is a genetic control method whereby large numbers of sterile male mosquitoes are reared and released. Mating with wild females reduces the wild population in the subsequent generation; repeated releases eventually eliminate the target population.|$|E
5|$|A.viridimontanum is {{difficult}} to distinguish from its parent species in the field. It can generally be separated from A.pedatum by {{the shape of the}} ultimate segments (the smallest divisions of the leaf), and by its habitat on thin, exposed serpentine soils rather than in rich woodlands. <b>It</b> <b>more</b> closely resembles A.aleuticum; however, the stalks of the ultimate segments and the false indusia are longer and the spores larger.|$|E

5|$|Adidas Terrestra Silverstream was the {{official}} match ball {{used in the}} final.

The ball's design was created by British independent brand specialist company Design Bridge, and influenced by the waters, in the Netherlands and Belgium. The ball contains synthetic foam layers, making <b>it</b> <b>more</b> comfortable to grip and smoother to control.

With the backing of Emperor Shenzong (1067–1085), Wang Anshi severely criticized the educational system and state bureaucracy. Seeking to resolve {{what he saw as}} state corruption and negligence, Wang implemented a series of reforms called the New Policies. These involved land value tax reform, the establishment of several government monopolies, the support of local militias, and the creation of higher standards for the Imperial examination to make <b>it</b> <b>more</b> practical for men skilled in statecraft to pass.|$|E

On April Fools Day—the date Arkham's family was murdered—Cavendish released the patients and lured Batman to the asylum, believing him to be the bat Arkham spoke of. Cavendish accuses him of feeding the evil of the asylum by bringing <b>it</b> <b>more</b> insane souls. Batman attempts to convince Cavendish he is sick and needs treatment, but Cavendish responds by attacking him. Batman and Cavendish proceed to struggle, which ends after Adams slashes Cavendish's throat with the razor.|$|E

5|$|Along the way, {{the story}} was greatly {{modified}} to make <b>it</b> <b>more</b> suitable as a family film. By {{the time it was}} completed in 1981, the film had changed into a chronicle of the unlikely friendship of two creatures, who should be natural enemies and who learn society sometimes tries to determine their roles despite their better impulses. In the original screenplay, Chief was slated to die the same as in the novel, but Stevens did not want to have an on-screen death and modified the film so that he survived.|$|E
5|$|An oil sketch {{attributed}} to Etty, given to York Art Gallery in 1952 by Judith Hare, Countess of Listowel and entitled Three Female Nudes, is possibly a preliminary study by Etty for Youth and Pleasure, or a copy {{by a student}} of the three central figures. Art historian Sarah Burnage considers both possibilities unlikely, as neither the arrangement of figures, the subject matter or the sea serpent approaching the group appear to relate to the completed Youth and Pleasure, and considers <b>it</b> <b>more</b> likely to be a preliminary sketch for a now-unknown work.|$|E

He emphasised that students must not only be good Catholics, but also good Indonesians. The Church began further development of its schools, ranging from elementary schools to universities. Soegijapranata also began reforming the Church in his apostolic vicariate, making <b>it</b> <b>more</b> Indonesian. He advocated the use of local languages and Indonesian during mass, allowing it throughout his diocese beginning in 1956.

5|$|Association football, {{the modern}} game, also has {{documented}} early involvement of women. An annual competition in Mid-Lothian, Scotland during the 1790s is reported, too.
