He continued to identify <b>double</b> <b>stars</b> and later published the General Catalogue of 1290 <b>Double</b> <b>Stars.</b> In 1906, he published the Burnham <b>Double</b> <b>Star</b> Catalogue, containing 13,665 pairs of <b>double</b> <b>stars.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Burnham <b>Double</b> <b>Star</b> Catalogue (BDS) is a {{catalogue}} of <b>double</b> <b>stars</b> within 121° of the celestial North Pole. It was published in two parts by the Carnegie Institution of Washington in 1906, under the title A General Catalogue of <b>Double</b> <b>Stars</b> Within 121° of the North Pole. The first part gives coordinates, designations, and magnitudes for 13,665 pairs of <b>double</b> <b>stars,</b> comprising almost all <b>double</b> <b>stars</b> discovered before 1906. [...] The second part contains measures, notes, and references to publications for each pair. Its publication was a stimulus to <b>double</b> <b>star</b> observation.|$|R
2500|$|Struve's name is {{best known}} for his {{observations}} of <b>double</b> <b>stars,</b> which he carried on for many years. Although <b>double</b> <b>stars</b> had been studied earlier by William Herschel and John Herschel and Sir James South, Struve outdid any previous efforts. [...] He discovered a very large number of <b>double</b> <b>stars</b> and in 1827 published his <b>double</b> <b>star</b> catalogue Catalogus novus stellarum duplicium.|$|R
2500|$|John Michell was {{the first}} to suggest that <b>double</b> <b>stars</b> might be {{physically}} attached to each other when he argued in 1767 that the probability that a <b>double</b> <b>star</b> was due to a chance alignment was small. [...] William Herschel began observing <b>double</b> <b>stars</b> in 1779 and soon thereafter published catalogs of about 700 <b>double</b> <b>stars.</b> [...] By 1803, he had observed changes in the relative positions in a number of <b>double</b> <b>stars</b> over the course of 25 years, and concluded that they must be binary systems; the first orbit of a binary star, however, was not computed until 1827, when Félix Savary computed the orbit of Xi Ursae Majoris. [...] Since this time, many more <b>double</b> <b>stars</b> have been catalogued and measured. [...] The Washington <b>Double</b> <b>Star</b> Catalog, a database of visual <b>double</b> <b>stars</b> compiled by the United States Naval Observatory, contains over 100,000 pairs of <b>double</b> <b>stars,</b> including optical <b>doubles</b> as well as binary stars. [...] Orbits are known for only a few thousand of these <b>double</b> <b>stars,</b> [...] and most have not been ascertained to be either true binaries or optical <b>double</b> <b>stars.</b> [...] This can be determined by observing the relative motion of the pairs. [...] If the motion is part of an orbit, or if the stars have similar radial velocities and the difference in their proper motions is small compared to their common proper motion, the pair is probably physical. [...] One of the tasks that remains for visual observers of <b>double</b> <b>stars</b> is to obtain sufficient observations to prove or disprove gravitational connection.|$|R
50|$|South and John Herschel jointly {{produced}} {{a catalogue of}} 380 <b>double</b> <b>stars</b> in 1824, reobserving many of the <b>double</b> <b>stars</b> that had been discovered by William Herschel.

2500|$|The term <b>double</b> <b>star</b> {{is often}} used synonymously with binary star; however, <b>double</b> <b>star</b> can also mean optical <b>double</b> <b>star.</b> Optical <b>doubles</b> are so called because the two stars appear close {{together}} in the sky {{as seen from the}} Earth; they are almost on the same [...] Nevertheless, their [...] "doubleness" [...] depends only on this optical effect; the stars themselves are distant from one another and share no physical connection. A <b>double</b> <b>star</b> can be revealed as optical by means of differences in their parallax measurements, proper motions, or radial velocities. Most known <b>double</b> <b>stars</b> have not been studied sufficiently closely to determine whether they are optical doubles or they are doubles physically bound through gravitation into a multiple star system.|$|R

5000|$|Winnecke 4 (also {{known as}} Messier 40 or WNC 4) is a <b>double</b> <b>star</b> in the {{constellation}} Ursa Major.

Not seeing any nebulae, Messier catalogued this <b>double</b> <b>star</b> instead. It was subsequently rediscovered by Friedrich August Theodor Winnecke in 1863, and included in the Winnecke Catalogue of <b>Double</b> <b>Stars</b> as number 4.

5000|$|Dunlop's {{other major}} {{observational}} work was of 256 southern <b>double</b> <b>stars</b> or [...] "pairs" [...] below the declination of about 30° South. These were listed in Approximate Places of <b>Double</b> <b>Stars</b> in the Southern Hemisphere, observed at Paramatta in New South Wales, published in 1829. Many of these pairs were actual new discoveries, though the most northerly {{of them had}} been earlier discoveries made by other observers. These <b>double</b> <b>star</b> observations were all made roughly between December 1827 and December 1828, being observed through his homemade 9-foot 23 cm (9-inch) speculum Newtonian reflector, or by measuring the separated distances and position angles of selected <b>double</b> <b>stars</b> using the small 8.0 cm equatorial mounted refracting telescope. Most of these pairs have proved to be uninteresting to astronomers, and many of the <b>double</b> <b>stars</b> selected were too wide for the indication of orbital motion as binary stars. It seems these observations were made when the atmospheric conditions were quite unsuitable for looking at deep sky objects, either being made under unsteady astronomical seeing or when the sky was illuminated by the bright moon. John Herschel immediately on arrival in South Africa in 1834 and 1835 re-observed all of the James Dunlop's <b>double</b> <b>stars,</b> but had troubles identifying them or finding significant differences in the measured positions of the stars [...] He first began with Alpha Crucis / Acrux, the brightest star in the constellation of Crux, also commonly known as the Southern Cross, then systematically searched for all the others. Herschel also was first to designated all the Dunlop <b>double</b> <b>stars</b> to begin with the Greek letter [...] "Δ", which persists in many amateur observational references. Hence, bright southern doubles like p Eridani is known as Δ5, Gamma Crucis / Gacrux is Δ124, etc. Modern <b>double</b> <b>star</b> observers have since discarded this designation and prefer the observer abbreviation [...] "DUN", as first adopted in the Washington <b>Double</b> <b>Star</b> Catalog (WDS) as maintained by the US Naval Observatory in Washington, D.C.. Hence, p Eridani is DUN 5, Gamma Crucis / Gacrux is DUN 124, etc.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe <b>Double</b> <b>Star</b> Project is a {{collaboration}} between Chinese and European space agencies, in which two Chinese magnetospheric research spacecraft, carrying Chinese and European instruments, have been launched into equatorial (on 29 December 2003) and polar (on 25 July 2004) orbits designed to enable complementary studies with the Cluster spacecraft. The two <b>Double</b> <b>Star</b> spacecraft TC- 1 and TC- 2 each carry a <b>Double</b> <b>Star</b> Plasma Electron and Current Experiment (PEACE) instrument.

Secondly, the DPU hardware was modified and major changes of onboard software were implemented, most notably a completely different approach to data compression has been adopted for <b>Double</b> <b>Star,</b> which allows high resolution 3 -dimensional distributions to be transmitted almost every spin, a significant improvement over Cluster.
