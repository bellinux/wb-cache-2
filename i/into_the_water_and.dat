5|$|Adults of Diphyllobothrium infest fish, and the juveniles use copepod {{crustaceans}} as intermediate hosts. Excreted proglottids {{release their}} eggs <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>water,</b> <b>and</b> the eggs hatch into ciliated, swimming larvae. If a larva is swallowed by a copepod, it sheds the cilia {{and the skin}} becomes a syncitium and the larva makes {{its way into the}} copepod's hemocoel (internal cavity that is {{the main part of the}} circulatory system) and attached itself with three small hooks. If the copepod is eaten by a fish, the larva metamorphoses into a small, unsegmented tapeworm, drills through to the gut and becomes an adult.|$|E
5|$|In January 2014, Knut's full autopsy {{results were}} {{published}} by the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research in the Journal of Comparative Pathology. It was the most in-depth post-mortem ever carried out on an animal. The autopsy revealed that {{the damage to the}} bear’s brain was so severe that even if he had not fallen <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>and</b> drowned he would have died anyway. Experts hypothesized that he was suffering from a virus that caused the encephalitis.|$|E

5|$|Brody {{runs into}} Mike, who tells {{his father that}} Sean is with his friends, {{drifting}} towards Cable Junction, a small island housing an electrical relay station, and apologizes for disobeying him and putting Sean in danger. Brody accepts his apology while telling him to get to safety and quickly finds them, but when the shark returns, he panics and maroons the police boat on Cable Junction. He then tries to pull them in with a winch but hooks an underwater power cable. The shark's next attack sends most of the teenagers <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>water,</b> <b>and</b> they swim to Cable Junction while Sean and Jackie are trapped on the boats. Using an inflatable raft, Brody hits the power cable with an oar to attract the shark, and encourages it to bite the cable; the shark is fatally electrocuted, and its body sinks {{to the bottom of}} the sea. The kids rejoice as Brody picks up Sean and Jackie, and they join them on Cable Junction to await rescue.|$|E
5|$|Charlotte Shaw was a fourteen-year-old British schoolgirl who drowned while {{crossing}} a swollen stream on Dartmoor during training for Ten Tors in 2007. Her death, {{the first to}} occur in connection with Ten Tors or one of its training expeditions, made national news headlines in the United Kingdom. She was {{with a group of}} students from Edgehill College trekking the route of Ten Tors in training for the main event when the group got into difficulties {{crossing a}} stream. Shaw slipped <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>and</b> was washed downstream. She was located 20 minutes later by a Royal Navy search and rescue helicopter and airlifted to Derriford Hospital in Plymouth, where she died {{in the early hours of}} the next morning.|$|E
5|$|Droits de l'Homme was irreparably damaged, {{and many}} of the men on board were {{soldiers}} with no training for what to do {{in the event of a}} shipwreck. Each successive wave swept more men <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>and</b> desperate attempts to launch boats failed when the small craft were swept away by the waves and broken in the surf. Rafts were constructed, but several were swamped in attempts to carry a rope to the shore. The men on the one raft that remained upright were forced to cut the rope to prevent them from foundering in the heavy seas. Some of the men on this raft reached the beach, the first survivors of the wreck. Subsequent attempts were made by individuals to swim to shore with ropes, but they were either drowned or driven back to the ship by the force of the sea.|$|E

5|$|Icelandic horses {{still play}} {{a large part}} in Icelandic life, despite {{increasing}} mechanization and road improvements that diminish the necessity for the breed's use. The first official Icelandic horse race was held at Akureyri in 1874, and many races are still held throughout the country from April through June. Both gallop and pace races are held, as well as performance classes showcasing the breed's unique gaits. Winter events are often held, including races on frozen bodies of water. In 2009 such an event resulted in both horses and riders falling <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>and</b> needing to be rescued. The first shows, focused {{on the quality of}} animals as breeding stock, were held in 1906. The Agricultural Society of Iceland, along with the National Association of Riding Clubs, now organizes regular shows {{with a wide variety of}} classes. Some horses are still bred for slaughter, and much of the meat is exported to Japan. Farmers still use the breed to round up sheep in the Icelandic highlands, but most horses are used for competition and leisure riding.|$|E
5|$|In {{most species}} the sexes are separate, {{but all the}} {{freshwater}} species are hermaphroditic. Nemerteans often have numerous temporary gonads (ovaries or testes), and build temporary gonoducts (ducts from which the ova or sperm are emitted), one per gonad, when the ova and sperm are ready. The eggs are generally fertilised externally. Some species shed them <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>water,</b> <b>and</b> others protect their eggs in various ways. The fertilized egg divides by spiral cleavage and grows by determinate development, in which {{the fate of a}} cell can usually be predicted from its predecessors in the process of division. The embryos of most taxa develop either directly to form juveniles (like the adult but smaller) or to form planuliform larvae, in which the larva's long axis {{is the same as the}} juvenile's. However, some form a pilidium larva, in which the developing juvenile has a gut which lies across the larva's body, and usually eats the remains of the larva when it emerges. The bodies of some species fragment readily, and even parts near the tail can grow full bodies.|$|E
5|$|Morgan did {{not stay}} long in Port Royal and in October 1668 sailed with ten ships and 800 men for Île-à-Vache, {{a small island}} he used as a {{rendezvous}} point. His plan was to attack the Spanish settlement of Cartagena de Indias, the richest and most important city on the Spanish Main. In December he was joined by a former Royal Navy frigate, Oxford, which {{had been sent to}} Port Royal to aid in any defence of Jamaica. Modyford sent the vessel to Morgan, who made it his flagship. On 2 January 1669 Morgan called a council of war for all his captains, which took place on Oxford. A spark in the ship's powder magazine destroyed the ship and over 200 of its crew. Morgan and the captains seated {{on one side of the}} table were blown <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>and</b> survived; the four captains on the other side of the table were all killed.|$|E

5|$|On February 23, 1854, Irataba, Cairook, {{and other}} Mohave people {{encountered}} an expedition led by military officers Amiel Whipple and J.C. Ives, {{as the group}} approached the Colorado en route to California. Whipple and his men counted six hundred Mohave gathered near their camp, trading corn, beans, squash, and wheat for beads and calico. By {{the end of their}} commerce, the party had purchased six bushels of corn and two hundred pounds of flour. The Mohave played a traditional game played with a hoop and pole, and the two groups entertained themselves with target practice, the Mohave using bows and arrows and the whites firing pistols and rifles. When the expedition had difficulty crossing the Colorado on February 27, several Mohave jumped <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>and</b> helped salvage the supplies.|$|E
5|$|The Alsos Mission now {{attempted}} {{to recover the}} shipment that {{had been sent to}} France. Documentation was discovered that said that part of it had been sent to Toulouse. An Alsos Mission team under Pash's command reached Toulouse on 1 October and inspected a French Army arsenal. They used a Geiger counter to find barrels containing 31 tons of the uranium from Belgium. Conrad persuaded Major General Frank S. Ross to release the U.S. 3342nd Quartermaster Truck Company from the Red Ball Express to retrieve the shipment. The barrels were collected and transported to Marseille, where they were loaded on a ship bound for the United States. During the loading process a barrel fell <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>and</b> had to be retrieved by a Navy diver. In Marseilles, the Alsos Mission detachment also met up with the detachment that had been sent to Italy, which now rejoined them. The remaining 49 tons of the original shipment to France were never found.|$|E

In the pursuit, Reyes falls through into a sewer, where she finds {{the remains of the}} Bearded Man's victims. After a {{struggle}} with the Bearded Man who is holding Doggett at knife point, Reyes shoots.

5|$|The next morning, Brody's {{teenage son}} Mike disobeys his father by sneaking out to go sailing {{with his friends}} after his love interest, Jackie Peters, goads him to, but his younger brother, Sean, catches him, and persuades Mike to bring him along. After an {{argument}} at the dock, Marge, one of Mike's friends, playfully lets Sean come in her boat with her, and {{after a couple of}} other grouping arrangements, they head out, going past a team of divers, led by instructor Tom Andrews. Moments after going underwater, Andrews encounters the shark. Panicking, he rushes to the surface, causing an embolism. Soon after, the shark hits teenagers Tina Wilcox and Eddie Marchand; Eddie falls <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>and</b> is killed by the shark.|$|E
5|$|The sloth bear, {{though not}} as {{specialised}} as polar bears and the panda, has lost several front teeth usually seen in bears, and developed a long, suctioning tongue to feed on the ants, termites, and other burrowing insects they favour. At certain times of the year, these insects can make up 90% of their diets. Some species may raid the nests of wasps and bees for the honey and immature insects, in spite of stinging from the adults. Sun bears use their long tongues to lick up both insects and honey. Fish are {{an important source of}} food for some species, and brown bears in particular gather in large numbers at salmon runs. Typically, a bear plunges <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>and</b> seizes a fish with its jaws or front paws. The preferred parts to eat are the brain and eggs. Small burrowing mammals like rodents may be dug out and eaten.|$|E
5|$|The voyage {{from the}} United Kingdom took {{approximately}} {{three weeks and}} on 7 November 1942 Awatea arrived at its assigned station off the coast near the harbour of Algiers. At 10:15pm No. 6 Commando took to their landing craft. The launch did not go smoothly. From the outset they were hampered by the inexperience of the crews lowering the landing craft <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>and</b> this, along with other factors that arose later including poor weather, breakdowns and navigational errors meant {{that the majority of}} No. 6 Commando's landing craft missed the rendezvous with the motor launch that was to guide them to the landing beaches. As a result, many landed at the wrong spot and the schedule was ruined. In the end the first landings took place at 3:00am on 8 November, two hours later than planned, while the last wave came ashore in broad daylight at 6:30am.|$|E

5|$|A third ship, the Manantico also {{crashed into}} shore {{due to a}} {{combination}} of the storm and human error in which the captain confused Cape Henry with Cape Charles after spotting another schooner. The Manantico was also where the two deaths associated with the storm occurred. The first was when a cook on the ship was crushed to death by the cargo of lumber being hauled by the ship. The ship was then pushed towards a sand bar. The captain, who had stayed high on the starboard side for safety, began climbing down to slip the ship cables, but the ship made a sudden stop. This flung the captain <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>water,</b> <b>and</b> he drowned. Both bodies were found after the storm and were very disfigured. The captain was sent to Middletown, Connecticut for interment while the body of the cook was buried on the beach. The final ship was the Harriet Thomas, which was the schooner spotted by the Manantico. After beaching, the crew managed to get a rope to shore where fishermen had tied the other end. The crew were able to climb ashore, although the captain had to be rescued via alternate means due to being too heavy for this method. The ship was written off as a $7000 (1887 USD) loss. Although all four ships were beached, due to the loss of communications, only one wreck – that of the Mary D. Cranmer – was reported in the Norfolk Virginian newspaper. As a result, news of the two deaths from the Manantico were initially unreported.|$|E
5|$|At 22:56 on 5June, 1944, the six gliders towed by Halifax bombers {{took off}} from RAF Tarrant Rushton. Horsa number one, {{the first of the}} three headed for the Caen Canal, carried Howard with Lieutenant Den Brotheridge's platoon, number two bore Lieutenant David Wood's platoon, and number three carried Lieutenant Smith's platoon. Priday with Lieutenant Hooper's platoon made for the river bridge aboard number four. Horsa number five {{carrying}} Lieutenant Fox's platoon was followed by number six bearing Tod Sweeney's platoon. Each glider also carried five Royal Engineers. Flying over the English Channel at , the bombers crossed the Normandy coast at 00:07 on 6June, 1944 and released their towed gliders. With Wallwork at the controls, the number one glider crashed into the barbed wire surrounding the canal bridge defences at 00:16. The other two gliders followed at one-minute intervals. The number two glider broke in half and came to halt {{at the edge of a}} large pond. One of the men fell <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>and</b> drowned, becoming the first casualty of the operation. Brotheridge and Smith's platoons headed for the bridge, while Wood's platoon moved towards the trenches on its north east side.|$|E
5|$|Next, a small {{metallic}} dingy, {{known as}} an iron yawl, was carried down to the beach. Tom Fagen and Freed Waterhouse manned the yawl, in another attempt to reach the grounded schooner. Through skilled seamanship, they {{made it to the}} second set of breakers, only a short distance from the vessel. When they tried to reach the float line, a large wave struck them leaving their boat filled with water. The two men abandoned their yawl. Fagen managed to swim ashore and was met by volunteers close to the beach half-drowned. Waterhouse decided against swimming to shore. When he saw that the yawl had flipped, he swam back to it and straddled the hull. The men on the shore began pulling the flipped boat in, but another wave broke on top of it throwing Waterhouse <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>and</b> righting the yawl. Waterhouse climbed back into the boat and began getting pulled in again, only to be capsized shortly thereafter. This time Waterhouse surfaced, appearing dazed and grasping onto an oar. Shaw's rescue boat was put back in the water, but Waterhouse had already gone under and presumably drowned to death a short time later. F Waterhouse's body was never recovered, despite several searches.|$|E
