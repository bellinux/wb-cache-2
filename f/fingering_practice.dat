40|$|There is {{presently}} considerable interest among scholars and performers of early music in early keyboard <b>fingering</b> <b>practices</b> and {{their effect on}} the music’s articulation and phrasing. This is nowhere {{more evident than in}} the current reconsideration of J. S. Bach’s keyboard music in the light of primary source material on his keyboard fingering. The primary sources available to us up to now are three in number: 1. Applicatio (BWV 994) 2. Praeambulum (BWV 928) 3. Praeludium und Fughetta in C-dur (BWV 870 a) During recent research into Bach’s keyboard <b>fingering</b> <b>practices,</b> I had occasion to examine Johann Philipp Kirnberger’s Clavierübungen mit der Bachischen Applicatur. This publication has yielded yet another piece which throws considerable light on Bach’s keyboard fingering, and which corroborates the value of source 3 above as a highly accurate indication of this fingering...|$|R

40|$|It {{has long}} been known that {{practicing}} a task with one limb can result in performance improvements with the opposite, untrained limb. Hypotheses to account for cross-limb transfer of performance state that the effect is mediated either by neural adaptations in higher order control centers that are accessible to both limbs, or that there is a "spillover" of neural drive to the opposite hemisphere that results in bilateral adaptation. Here we address these hypotheses by assessing performance and corticospinal excitability in both hands after unilateral practice of a ballistic finger movement. Participants (n = 9) completed 300 practice trials of a ballistic task with the right hand, the aim of which was to maximize the peak abduction acceleration of the index <b>finger.</b> <b>Practice</b> caused a 140 % improvement in right-hand performance and an 82 % improvement for the untrained left hand. There were bilateral increases in the amplitude of responses to transcranial magnetic stimulation, but increased corticospinal excitability was not correlated with improved performance. There were no significant changes in corticospinal excitability or task performance for a control group that did not train (n = 9), indicating that performance testing for the left hand alone did not induce performance or corticospinal effects. Although the data do not provide conclusive evidence whether increased corticospinal excitability in the untrained hand is causally related to the cross-transfer of ballistic performance, the finding that ballistic practice can induce bilateral corticospinal adaptations may have important clinical implications for movement rehabilitation...|$|R
50|$|Laboratory studies {{reported}} {{many examples of}} dramatic improvements in sensitivities from appropriately structured perceptual learning tasks. In visual Vernier acuity tasks, observers judge whether one line is displaced above or below a second line. Untrained observers are often already very good with this task, but after training, observers' threshold {{has been shown to}} improve as much as 6 fold. Similar improvements have been found for visual motion discrimination and orientation sensitivity.In visual search tasks, observers are asked to find a target object hidden among distractors or in noise. Studies of perceptual learning with visual search show that experience leads to great gains in sensitivity and speed. In one study by Karni and Sagi, the time it took for subjects to search for an oblique line among a field of horizontal lines was found to improve dramatically, from about 200ms in one session to about 50ms in a later session. With appropriate practice, visual search can become automatic and very efficient, such that observers do not need more time to search when there are more items present on the search field. Tactile perceptual learning has been demonstrated on spatial acuity tasks such as tactile grating orientation discrimination, and on vibrotactile perceptual tasks such as frequency discrimination; tactile learning on these tasks has been found to transfer from trained to untrained <b>fingers.</b> <b>Practice</b> with Braille reading and daily reliance on the sense of touch may underlie the enhancement in tactile spatial acuity of blind compared to sighted individuals.|$|R

50|$|Cooking {{and eating}} in the Philippines has {{traditionally}} been an informal and communal affair centered around the family kitchen. Filipinos traditionally eat three main meals a day: agahan or almusal (breakfast), tanghalían (lunch), and hapunan (dinner) plus an afternoon snack called meriénda (also called minandál or minindál). Snacking is normal. Dinner, while still the main meal, is smaller than other countries. Usually, either breakfast or lunch is the largest meal. Food tends to be served all at once and not in courses. Unlike many of their Asian counterparts Filipinos do not eat with chopsticks. Due to Western influence, food is often eaten using flatware—forks, knives, spoons—but the primary pairing of utensils used at a Filipino dining table is that of spoon and fork, not knife and fork. The traditional way of eating is with the hands, especially dry dishes such as inihaw or prito. The diner will take a bite of the main dish, then eat rice pressed together with his <b>fingers.</b> This <b>practice,</b> known as kamayan, is rarely seen in urbanized areas. However, Filipinos tend to feel the spirit of kamayan when eating amidst nature during out-of-town trips, beach vacations, and town fiestas.|$|R
40|$|Increasing {{agricultural}} productivity through {{the dissemination of}} improved cropping practices {{remains one of the}} biggest challenges of this century. A considerable amount of literature is dedicated to the adoption of improved cropping practices among smallholder farmers in developing countries. While most studies focus on cash crops or main staple crops, traditional food grains like finger millet have received little attention in the past decades. The present study aims to assess the factors that are influencing adoption decisions among finger millet farmers in Western Kenya. Based on cross-sectional household data from 270 farmers, we estimate a multivariate probit model to compare the adoption decisions in finger millet and maize production. While improved practices such as the use of a modern variety or chemical fertilizer are well known in maize production, they are less common in finger millet production. Results show that social networks as well as access to extension services play a crucial role in the adoption of improved <b>finger</b> millet <b>practices,</b> while the same variables are of minor importance for the adoption of improved maize practices. A Cobb-Douglas production function shows a positive effect of modern varieties and chemical fertilizer on finger millet yields...|$|R
40|$|Acquiring a new skill {{requires}} learning multiple {{aspects of}} a task simultaneously. For example, learning a piano sonata requires learning the musical notes {{and being able to}} implement this goal by learning the appropriate sequence of <b>finger</b> movements. After <b>practice,</b> skill continues to develop off-line during a period of consolidation. Here we show that different {{aspects of a}} procedural memory are processed separately during consolidation: Only the movement sequence is enhanced over the day; whereas only the goal is enhanced over a night of sleep. This double dissociation suggests that distinct systems, enhancing different aspects of a procedural memory, support improvements during consolidation. Consolidation is not a single process; instead, there are multiple routes to off-line learning, and the engagement of these distinct mechanisms is determined by when consolidation takes place...|$|R

40|$|Blood {{pressure}} {{is one of}} the key measurements taken in standard clinical examinations. Its importance has long been associated with the instrumental precision offered by the sphygmomanometer, which is supposed to have replaced other, more imprecise methods of blood pressure measurement, such as feeling the pulse with the finger. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork in a neurosurgical clinic, this paper explores the co-existence of the sphygmomanometer and the <b>finger</b> methods in <b>practice.</b> I argue that in neurosurgery these methods are both independent from and interdependent with each other: independent in the way they achieve different assessments of the patient’s blood pressure at the same time; and interdependent in the way the surgeon’s and anaesthetist’s measurements are dynamically linked with each other. The paper suggests that this particular form of coordination through heterogeneity might be described, borrowing from Michel Serres’ work, as mutual parasitism, and that this metaphor might be useful in rethinking the role of science - research, or ‘evidence’ - in medical practice...|$|R

40|$|Aim In {{previous}} studies, unilateral ballistic training either increased or decreased corticospinal excitability for {{the untrained}} opposite limb. The objective {{here was to}} investigate whether these discrepancies {{can be explained by}} methodological differences such as the intensity of stimulation assessing excitability or the timing of excitability testing after training. Methods Motor evoked potentials (MEP) were elicited by stimulating the ipsilateral cortex at high intensity (70 % MEPmax) and low intensity (20 % MEPmax) at specific time-points after performance of 300 ballistic movements of the index <b>finger.</b> Results Ballistic <b>practice</b> significantly facilitated MEP size for high-intensity stimuli, whereas responses to low-intensity stimulation were variable. MEP sizes at individual time-points were not significantly facilitated until 4 min after training, although {{there was no difference between}} early and late responses when grouped over multiple time-points. Conclusions The data indicate that previous discrepancies in ipsilateral responses to ballistic training cannot be attributed to specific procedures used to assess corticospinal excitability as there was no tendency towards depression of MEP amplitude at any point post-exercise for both testing intensities. This suggests that other experimental factors such as locus of attention or availability of visual feedback are more likely to account for the discrepancies...|$|R
40|$|Cortical {{reorganization}} {{within the}} primary motor cortex (M 1) contralateral to a practicing hand {{has been extensively}} investi-gated. The {{extent to which the}} ipsilateral M 1 participates in these plastic changes is not known. Here, we evaluated the influence of unilateral hand practice on the organization of the M 1 ipsilateral and contralateral to the practicing hand in healthy human subjects. Index finger movements elicited by single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) delivered to each M 1 were evaluated before and after practice of unilateral voluntary index <b>finger</b> abduction motions. <b>Practice</b> increased the proportion and accel-eration of TMS-evoked movements in the trained direction and the amplitude of motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) in the abduction agonist first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle in the practicing hand and decreased the proportion and acceleration of TMS-evoked abduction movements and MEP amplitudes in the abduction agonist FDI in the opposite resting hand. Our findings indicate that unilateral hand practice specifically weakened the representation of the practiced movement in the ipsilateral M 1 to an extent proportional to the strengthening effect in the contralateral M 1, a result that varied with the practicing hand’s position. These results suggest a more prominent involvement of interacting bilateral motor networks in motor memory formation and probably acquisition of unimanual motor skills than previously thought...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether exposure to specific auditory sequences leads to the induction of new motor memories and to investigate the role of the dorsal premotor cortex (dPMC) in this crossmodal learning process. Fifty-two young healthy non-musicians were familiarized with the sound to key-press mapping on a computer keyboard and tested on their baseline motor performance. Each participant received subsequently either continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) or sham stimulation over the dPMC and was then asked to remember a 12 -note melody without moving. For half of the participants, the contour of the melody memorized was congruent to a subsequently performed, but never <b>practiced,</b> <b>finger</b> movement sequence (Congruent group). For the other half, the melody memorized was incongruent to the subsequent finger movement sequence (Incongruent group). Hearing a congruent melody led to significantly faster performance of a motor sequence immediately thereafter compared to hearing an incongruent melody. In addition, cTBS speeded up motor performance in both groups, possibly by relieving motor consolidation from interference by the declarative melody memorization task. Our findings substantiate recent evidence that exposure to a movement-related tone sequence can induce specific, crossmodal encoding of a movement sequence representation. They further suggest that cTBS over the dPMC may enhance early offline procedural motor skill consolidation in cognitive states where motor consolidation would normally be disturbed by concurrent declarative memory processes. These findings may contribute to a better understanding of auditory-motor system interactions and have implications for the development of new motor rehabilitation approaches using sound and non-invasive brain stimulation as neuromodulatory tools...|$|R
