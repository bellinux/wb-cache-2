There he became embroiled in discussions whether to replace the Katipunan with an <b>insurgent</b> <b>government</b> of the Cavite rebels' design. To this end, the Tejeros Convention was convened, where Aguinaldo was elected president of the new <b>insurgent</b> <b>government.</b> Bonifacio refused to recognize this and he was executed for treason in May 1897.|$|E

2500|$|When Tsar Nicholas I succeeded Alexander in December 1825, Canning {{decided to}} act immediately: {{he sent the}} Duke of Wellington to Russia, and the outcome was the Protocol of St Petersburg of 4 April 1826. According to the protocol, the two powers agreed to mediate between the Ottomans and the Greeks {{on the basis of}} {{complete}} autonomy of Greece under Turkish sovereignty. The Anglo-Russian protocol that Wellington negotiated with Nicholas in St. Petersburg attracted much scorn from Metternich, who was consistently the most pro-Ottoman and anti-Greek European statesmen. Metternich [...] dismissively wrote, [...] "If the Irish were to revolt against the British Crown, and the King of France were to offer to mediate," [...] leading him to ask: [...] "Is England then ready to regard as a Power equal to rights to that of the [...] King the first Irish Club which declares itself the <b>Insurgent</b> <b>Government</b> of Ireland? To regard as justified the French Power which would accept the office of mediator, by reason of the sole fact that the invitation had been addressed to it by the Irish Government?...Whither does this absurdity not lead us?". Prussia, whose king Frederich Wilhelm was close to Metternich, chose to follow the Austrian lead. Before he met with Wellington, the Tsar had already sent an ultimatum to the Porte, demanding that the principalities be evacuated immediately, and that plenipotentiaries be sent to Russia to settle outstanding issues. The Sultan agreed to send the plenipotentiaries, and on 7 October 1826 signed the Akkerman Convention, in which Russian demands concerning Serbia and the principalities were accepted.|$|E
60|$|In {{the mean}} time, Murray was drawing near toward the {{confines}} of Scotland. He was somewhat uncertain how to act. Having been absent for some time in France and on the Continent, he was not certain how far the people of Scotland were really and cordially {{in favor of the}} revolution which had been effected. Mary's friends might claim that her acts of abdication, having been obtained while she was under duress, were null and void, and if they were strong enough they might attempt to reinstate her upon the throne. In this case, {{it would be better for}} him not to have acted with the <b>insurgent</b> <b>government</b> at all. To gain information on these points, Murray sent to Melville to come and meet him on the border. Melville came. The result of their conferences was, that Murray resolved to visit Mary in her tower before he adopted any decisive course.|$|E

5000|$|Within Cavite, {{friction}} grew between Bonifacio and the Magdalo leaders. Earlier in October, Aguinaldo {{had issued}} a manifesto {{in the name}} of the Magdalo ruling council which proclaimed an <b>insurgent</b> <b>government.</b> This was done despite the existence of the Katipunan, which Bonifacio had already converted into an <b>insurgent</b> <b>government</b> with him as president just before the outbreak of hostilities. Once Bonifacio was in Cavite the Magdalo leaders made overtures about replacing the Katipunan with an <b>insurgent</b> <b>government</b> of their design. Bonifacio and the Magdiwang maintained they already had a government in the Katipunan. [...] After Bonifacio was acclaimed as the [...] "ruler of the Philippines" [...] by townsfolk, unflattering rumors about him began to spread. It was rumored that Bonifacio had stolen Katipunan funds, his sister was the mistress of a priest, and he was an agent provocateur paid by Spanish friars to foment unrest. Also circulated were anonymous letters which told the people of Cavite not to idolize Bonifacio because he was (allegedly) a Freemason, a mere warehouseman, an atheist, and uneducated. These letters also said Bonifacio did not deserve the title of Supremo since only God was supreme. Tirona was widely suspected to be responsible for the rumor-mongering. When confronted by Bonifacio, Tirona dismissed his accusations in such a manner that provoked him to anger. He drew a gun and would have shot Tirona if others had not intervened.|$|E
5000|$|An {{alternative}} {{definition of}} the Cry as the [...] "birth of the Filipino nation state" [...] involves the setting up of a national <b>insurgent</b> <b>government</b> through the Katipunan with Bonifacio as President in Banlat, Pasong Tamo on August 24, 1896 - after the tearing of cedulas but before the first skirmish. This was called the Haring Bayang Katagalugan (Sovereign Tagalog Nation).|$|E
