40|$|International audienceWe have {{investigated}} the physical and photo electrochemical properties of α-AgBiS 2 (schapbachite), synthesized from Bi 2 S 3 and Ag 2 S in evacuated Pyrex ampoule at 550 °C. The precursors are prepared by precipitation from nitrates in <b>ethylene</b> glycol using <b>thiourea</b> as complexing agent and sulfide source. AgBiS 2 crystallizes in a rock salt structure (Fm- 3 m). The transmission electron micrograph shows spherical nanoparticles with an average size of ~ 30 nm, a value very close to that obtained from the Williamson-Hall plot of the XRD powder pattern (33. 06 ± 1. 28 nm). HRTEM gives inter reticular distance of 0. 33 nm, a value in excellent agreement {{with that of the}} SAED analysis (d 111 = 0. 3276 nm). The diffuse reflectance spectrum indicates a direct optical transition of 0. 89 eV. The thermal variation of the electrical conductivity is characteristic of semiconducting behavior with activation energy of 0. 20 eV, electron mobility (µ 300 K) of 2. 43 × 10 − 4 cm 2 V− 1 s− 1 and an effective mass of 2. 88 mo. The intensity-potential J(V) curve in alkaline medium (pH 10. 2) shows a good electrochemical stability.

The study included 3 stages: feeding, analysis of <b>ethylene</b> <b>thiourea</b> in fish eggs and fillet by a new developed and validated HPLC (high performance liquid chromatography) method and study of the reproductive indicators. The assays of ETU in all analyzed samples (fish and water) were below the limit of quantification of the method, 0. 05 mg*l- 1, so fish do not accumulate the carcinogen degradation product of mancozeb and the maximum residue level of mancozeb is really safe for the humans as consumers. But these environmental conditions caused reproductive disorders.

Methods: We enrolled 451 pregnant women from Matina County, Costa Rica, with large-scale banana production. We visited 445 women up to three times during pregnancy to obtain urine samples (n = 872) and information on factors that possibly influence exposure. We determined urinary ETU concentrations using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LCMS). Results: Pregnant women's median urinary ETU concentrations were {{more than five times}} higher than reported for other general populations. Seventy-two percent of the women had EDIs above the RfD. Women who lived closest (1 st quartile, < 48 meters) to banana plantations on average had a 45 % (95 % CI: 23, 72 %) higher urinary ETU compared with women who lived farthest away (4 th quartile, ≥ 565 meter).

40|$|Poly(2 -chloro- 1, 3 -butadiene) (PCB, polychloroprene) has wide-ranging {{applications}} as neoprene rubber. Favourable {{chemical and}} physical {{properties in the}} material are attributed to a three-dimensional network of polymer chains, which is realised through cross-linking. <b>Ethylene</b> <b>thiourea</b> (ETU) and zinc oxide (ZnO) are the standard reagents which facilitate this in industrial processes. However, ETU is a suspected carcinogen and its usage is due tobecome severely restricted, {{so much so that}} the future production of neoprene rubber is at risk. Hence, an alternative, non-toxic cross-linking agent is required which can cross-linkPCB in the same fashion. The way in which the ETU/ZnO system functions must first beunderstood before a replacement can be proposed. Thus, mechanistic studies were initially undertaken with PCB oligomers in order to elucidate the reaction. To this end, a synthetic protocol was established for 2 -chloro- 1, 3 -butadiene (CB) and the monomer was subsequently adopted in numerous polymerisation reactions. Investigations into the reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerisation of CBproceeded to predefine low molecular weight PCB. A successful procedure was realised, employing 2 -cyano- 2 -propylbenzodithioate (CPD) CTA and conditions which were able to furnish < 1000 g/mol to 50, 000 g/mol, low dispersity PCB in a controlled manner. This invention was novel in that PCB has historically been synthesised via conventional(uncontrolled) free radical techniques. PCB oligomers were adopted in cross-linking reactions with ETU and various model compounds, alone, and with ZnO, to aid the interpretation of the ETU/ZnO mechanism. Spectroscopic analyses and the observation of by-products revealed that three disparate reactions occur; ETU and ZnO were found to act both synergistically and independently of each other. A newly-proposed mechanism describes activation of the polymer chain by ZnOand subsequent reaction through sulfur. As a result of this discovery, alternative compounds have been tested and found capable of cross-linking PCB. In a second industrial study, the eradication of allergy-causing cross-linking additives for PCBlatex (gloves) was investigated. PCB latex films were generated under various conditions and the materials physically tested.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the investigation into}} finding a safer alternative to the polychloroprene cross-linking agent <b>ethylene</b> <b>thiourea</b> (ETU). The novel approach of utilising spectroscopic analysis in combination with a study of mechanical and physical properties of polychloroprene was employed. Currently the most effective cross-linking system for polychloroprene is ETU in combination with zinc oxide (ZnO). However, due to the health risks associated with it, ETU may in the future be banned or heavily regulated, thus a replacement is sought. An investigation of the cross-linking mechanisms of ETU alone, and ETU in conjunction with ZnO was completed. This was necessary as polychloroprene cross-links differently to many other polymers. The study was carried out using model compounds, such as amines and thiols, in addition to work on more widely used accelerators, including thiurams and dithiocarbamates; this revealed that at least three disparate mechanisms are in operation. These mechanisms, comprise one of a cationic nature employed by ZnO, a bis-alkylation mechanism of ETU and a new proposed mechanism seen when ETU and ZnO work together synergistically. This new mechanism shows ZnO activating the polymer chain, followed by the sulfur of ETU creating a cross-link. Using this new mechanism, several new accelerators were proposed. These accelerators contain a dithiocarbamate group and are complexed with diamines. The diamine present acts as an activator and the dithiocarbamate group a cross-linker. These new accelerators were tested in pure polychloroprene rubber on their own, and in combination with tetrabenzyl thiuramdisulfide (TBzTD) or ZnO. All the proposed accelerators were able to cross-link. The replacement which most closely matched ETU, in terms of physical and mechanical properties of the vulcanisate was a complex of piperazine- 1 -carbodithioic acid and 1, 3 -diaminopropane (named PNA 5). This accelerator was taken forward and tested in a filled commercial master batch. As a successful conclusion to the project a complete PNA 5 -based system was shown to closely match the performance of an ETU system in a master batch.

We administered the chemicals (diethylhexyl phthalate, cinnamyl anthranilate, chlorendic acid, 1, 4 -dichlorobenzene, monuron, <b>ethylene</b> <b>thiourea,</b> diethyl thiourea, trimethyl thiourea, and d-limonene to the same strains of mice and rats used in the original NTP bioassays (nine chemicals to rats and seven to mice). Selected tissues (liver, thyroid gland, and kidney) were collected from groups of animals at 7, 28, and 90 days for evaluation. Tissue changes selected for study were monitored for all of the test groups, irrespective of the specificity of the carcinogenic responses observed in those tissues. This allowed us to assess both the carcinogen specificity and the carcinogen sensitivity of the events being monitored. We studied relative weight, cell labeling indices, and pathologic changes such as hypertrophy in all tissues; a range of cytochrome P 450 enzymes and palmitoyl coenzyme A oxidase in the liver; changes in the levels of plasma total triiodothyronine, total thyroxine, and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) as markers of thyroid gland function; and hyaline droplet formation, tubular basophilia, and the formation of granular casts in the kidney. There were no single measurements that alerted specifically to the carcinogenicity of the agents to the rodent liver, thyroid gland, or kidney. However, in the majority of cases, the chemical induction of cancer in a tissue was preceded by a range of biochemical/morphologic changes, most of which were moderately specific for a carcinogenic outcome, and some of which were highly specific for it (e. g., increases in TSH in the thyroid gland and increases in relative liver weight in the mouse). The only measurements that failed to correlate usefully with carcinogenicity were the induction of liver enzymes (with the exception of the enzymes associated with peroxisome proliferation). Most of the useful markers were evident at the early times studied (7 days and 28 days), but no overall best time for the measurement of all markers was identified.

40|$|Introduction In {{mammalian}} species, phenobarbital (PB) {{has long}} been known to induce liver phase I metabolism, via activation of specific nuclear receptors (NRs), and phase II biotransformations as well. Nevertheless, the pattern of the in vivo modulation of oxidative, hydrolytic and conjugative drug metabolizing enzymes (DMEs) by this barbiturate has never been characterized in cattle. In the present study DME catalytic activity and expression were determined in liver subfractions from PB-induced or untreated cattle. Samples from the same animals were used for RNA isolation, cDNA cloning and sequencing of some bovine liver CYPs and their transcription factor (i. e. NR) as reported in Cantiello et al. (1). The ubiquitin (Ub) -dependent 26 S proteasome system was also investigated, in view of the key role played in the proteolytic disposal of structurally aberrant, abnormal, and/or otherwise malformed proteins, including cytochrome P 450 s (CYPs) which may be damaged as the result of their catalytic activity. Materials and methods Seven male 10 months old-Friesian cattle were obtained from local farms. Four individuals received PB (18 mg/Kg b. w. /day for 7 days) by oral gavage, while the remainders remained untreated (UT). Liver subcellular fractions were isolated by differential ultracentrifugation (3) and used to measure both the haemoprotein content and the rate of the in vitro metabolism of several phase I and phase II substrates (3, 4), that, based on studies performed in human, rodent and food producing species (5, 6), are reported to be markers for a number of oxidative or conjugative isozymes. Flavin-containing monooxygenase (FMO) activities were measured with methimazole or <b>ethylene</b> <b>thiourea</b> as substrates, according to published procedures. Apoprotein levels were measured by western blotting analysis as described (3). Proteasome chymotrypsin-like activity in liver extracts was assayed by monitoring in continuo the production of 7 -amino- 4 -methylcoumarin (amc) from the fluorogenic peptide Suc-LLVY-amc (7). Data were analysed by Student’s t-test. Results and discussion As partly depicted in Table 1, PB enhanced most of the tested microsomal enzyme activities (1 - to 19 -fold increase). It is relevant to note that, as previously observed in primary cultures of hepatocytes from ruminant species (8), PB failed to significantly increase the rate of pentoxyresorufin O-depentylation, which is reported to be an extremely specific marker for CYP 2 B activity in rodents (9). As regards testosterone hydroxylation, there was an increase in the generation of 2 β- (about 4 -fold), 6 β- (3 -fold) and 16 β- (3 -fold) OH-derivatives in treated vs control samples. As expressed as per nmole of CYP (turnover number) statistically significant changes were obtained for benzyloxyresorufin O-deethylase (7. 5 -fold; P< 0. 01), aminopyrine N-demethylase (2 -fold; P< 0. 05) and 7 -methoxy- 4 -trifluoromethylcoumarin O-demethylase (9 -fold; P< 0. 001). Western immunoblots revealed a consistent increase in the expression of CYP 2 B-, CYP 2 C- and CYP 3 A-related proteins (2. 6, 2. 2 and 3. 4 fold, respectively). As expected, PB did not augment FMO activities measured with either substrate, both in the presence or in the absence of CYP inhibitors (n-octylamine). Proteasome activity in liver extracts from PB-treated animals was about twice as that found in untreated controls (P< 0. 001), suggesting a PB-mediated increase in the amount of damaged hemoproteins. In line with results of previous experiments performed in calves (10), microsomal carboxylesterase activities toward different aromatic esters were slightly induced by the treatment, showing a significant increase only in the case of -naphthylacetate (about 1. 5 -fold; P< 0. 05). Glutathione S-transferase was not induced by the treatment, either using 1 -chloro- 2, 4 -nitrobenzene (CDNB) or 1, 2 -dichloro- 4 -nitrobenzene (DCNB) as the substrates, whereas a modest rise (about 1. 4 -fold) in uridinediphosphoglucuronosyltransferase (UGT) activity was observed using p-nitrophenol (pNP) as substrate. It is well known that some isoenzymes of UGT 1 family are inducible by PB, although this phenomenon may be underestimated because of the considerable overlapping substrate specificity displayed by the multiple transferase isoforms. As an example, either pNP or 1 -naphthol are routinely used to assess the conjugative capacity of certain UGT 1 isoenzymes (UGT 1 A 6 and UGT 1 A 1, respectively); however, neither of them can be considered as a specific substrate of any UGT (11). Further research is in progress to evaluate CYP mRNA levels and to confirm the involvement of CAR and other NRs in the induction mechanisms...|$|E
