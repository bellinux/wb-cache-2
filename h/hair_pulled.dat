5|$|Amy is a 12-year-old, pink-furred {{anthropomorphic}} hedgehog girl {{created by}} Kenji Terada for the Sonic the Hedgehog manga series. She debuted in 1992, wearing a dress {{and with her}} then-orange <b>hair</b> <b>pulled</b> into 2 ponytails. The character was redesigned the next year for the Sega CD game, Sonic CD. Like the Sonic CD introduction Metal Sonic, an early grayscale concept sketch shows her very similar to her appearance in the game (except her shoes, which became larger and flatter). Her coloring was red at first (including her skirt), except for a green shirt. The character had two other names in game previews: Rosy the Rascal and Princess Sally (a character in the Sonic the Hedgehog TV series). Amy received her present design, with a red dress and boots, in Sonic Adventure.|$|E
25|$|A {{shocking}} {{series of}} incidents {{occurred in the}} locality of Hessilhead, starting on 19 July 1576 when the Lady of Hessilhead slapped one Robert Kent, servant to Gabriel, brother of John Montgomerie. The servant complained to his master and Gabriel went to his brother at the old Thirdpart mansion for advice. John advised him to seek revenge {{and the next morning}} Gabriel and Robert gained entry into Hessilhead Castle where they found the lady alone, upon which they grabbed her by the <b>hair,</b> <b>pulled</b> her onto the floor, kicked her in the bowels, and bruised her shamefully. Gabriel intended to shoot the Laird, however the whole household was now awake and the two only just managed to escape by stealing a horse and locking the castle gate from the outside. The Laird, Hew Montgomerie, hastened to Thirdpart where John and Gabriel came out with pistols and drawn swords and attacked Hew Montgomerie, injuring him on various parts of his body and leaving him for dead. He was rescued by some neighbours who took him to Hessilhead castle where he recovered from his wounds.|$|E

40|$|Etiological {{models of}} {{trichotillomania}} (TTM) conceptualize <b>hair</b> <b>pulling</b> as a dysfunctional emotion regulation strategy; accordingly, some {{research has found}} that affective states change differentially across the <b>hair</b> <b>pulling</b> cycle. We explored emotional changes in a sample of Italian individuals reporting TTM. Eighty-nine participants reporting TTM completed a 12 -item section of the Italian <b>Hair</b> <b>Pulling</b> Questionnaire online and rated {{the extent to which they}} had experienced 12 affective states before, during, and after <b>hair</b> <b>pulling.</b> Overall, participants reported increased levels of shame, sadness, and frustration from pre- to post-pulling, and decreased levels of calmness after <b>hair</b> <b>pulling</b> episodes. Moreover, participants reported increased pleasure and relief across the pulling cycle, and variations in the direction of change for anger and anxiety depending on the <b>hair</b> <b>pulling</b> phase. Lastly, reported boredom decreased across the <b>hair</b> <b>pulling</b> cycle. These findings highlight the importance of considering emotional changes experienced across the pulling cycle in Italian hair pullers...|$|R
40|$|The chronic <b>hair</b> <b>pulling</b> of a 36 -year-old {{woman with}} {{moderate}} mental retardation was initially {{treated with a}} simplified habit-reversal (SHR) procedure that consisted of aware-ness training, competing response training, and social support. When SHR did not pro-duce large and sustained reductions in <b>hair</b> <b>pulling,</b> an awareness enhancement device was added, and it reduced <b>hair</b> <b>pulling</b> to near-zero levels in two settings.

DESCRIPTORS: habit reversal, awareness enhancement device, <b>hair</b> <b>pulling,</b> aware-ness training, competing response A number of studies have demonstrated the success of habit reversal in treating <b>hair</b> <b>pulling</b> by typically functioning adults (Fri-man, Finney, & Christophersen, 1984). However, habit reversal has not been eval-uated with individuals with mental retar-dation who engage in <b>hair</b> <b>pulling.</b> Instead, punishment procedures have most often been utilized (e. g., facial screening, Friman et al., 1984). Because the prevalence of <b>hair</b> <b>pulling</b> for individuals with mental retar-dation appears to be equivalent to, or pos-sibly higher than, the prevalence in the typ-ical population (Long, Miltenberger, & Rapp, 1998), an examination of habit-re-versal procedures for treating <b>hair</b> <b>pulling</b> in individuals with mental retardation is war-ranted.

They had to consult with the American animators, who advised them to watch movies so they could properly animate the guns. The original design for Marge's police uniform had Marge's hair standing up (as it normally is) with the hat on top. Director Mark Kirkland found that it made for awkward staging in scenes, so they altered the design to have her <b>hair</b> <b>pulled</b> down. David Mirkin later stated that if the design had been used, he would have asked for it to be changed because they were trying to depict Marge as a serious cop.|$|E
500|$|The obverse {{depicts a}} head of Liberty in the Greco-Roman style, [...] facing left, with her <b>hair</b> <b>pulled</b> back—according to numismatists Jeff Garrett and Ron Guth, [...] "attractively"—in a bun. [...] Some of her hair descends {{the back of her}} neck. [...] She wears a coronet, inscribed [...] "Liberty", and is {{surrounded}} by thirteen stars, representative of the original states, and the year of issue. The reverse features a heraldic eagle, holding a double ribbon, on which [...] "E Pluribus Unum" [...] is inscribed. The double ribbon is an allusion by Longacre to the denomination of the piece he was designing. The design is a variant on the Great Seal of the United States; the eagle protects a shield, which represents the nation, and holds an olive branch and arrows. Above the bird, Longacre again placed thirteen stars, arranged as a halo, together with an arc of rays.|$|E

The first twenty seconds are mainly full of camera shots of {{different}} men, Gaga, and the city. The singer roams around with some friends, laughing and joking in a restaurant, while she stands on the seat. Gaga then comes from around the block walking with her friends in pace and singing in the camera. Next, she is shown sleeping in a bed, and waking up to reveal pink high-heeled shoes. She sings and cooks for {{a man in a}} house while dancing. She irons clothes while the man is on phone screaming at someone. The two harlequin Great Danes who appear at the start of her [...] "Poker Face" [...] music video, also appear in this one. Finally she lies on a sofa with her legs up on the man.

40|$|To help {{determine}} the specificity of “loose anagen” (LA) hairs in Loose Anagen Syndrome, {{the presence or absence}} of LA hairs on a gentle but firm <b>hair</b> <b>pull</b> was evaluated in 110 normal subjects from a 0. 5 to 83 y old. In children ≤ 10 y old, 61 % had LA <b>hairs</b> on <b>hair</b> <b>pull</b> evaluation and 73 % of all hairs obtained were LA hairs. In contrast, LA hairs were found in only two of 87 (2 %) normal postpubescent subjects. The number of LA hairs was small in normal children (1 – 2 per <b>hair</b> <b>pull)</b> and a maximum of one out of every 6 – 7 <b>hair</b> <b>pulls</b> in adults, far less than that reported with Loose Anagen Syndrome. Although the mere presence of LA hairs on a <b>hair</b> <b>pull</b> test is thus not specific for LAS in children, the number per <b>hair</b> <b>pull</b> may have diagnostic significance.

40|$|Trichotillomania is a {{disorder}} characterized by recurrent urges to <b>pull</b> out one’s <b>hair,</b> but the experiential characteristics of <b>hair</b> <b>pulling</b> urges are poorly understood. This study used a comparative approach {{to understand the}} subjective phenomenology of hair pulling: participants with trichotillomania symptoms were asked about their <b>hair</b> <b>pulling</b> urges {{as well as their}} urges to eat unhealthy foods. Participants who reported experiencing problematic unhealthy food urges were identified and asked to compare the phenomenological characteristics of their <b>hair</b> <b>pulling</b> and unhealthy food urges across a variety of dimensions. Results revealed significant differences for only some urge properties measured, and differences that existed were small to moderate in magnitude. Qualitative comparisons of the two urges revealed situational characteristics of <b>hair</b> <b>pulling</b> that could explain these small to moderate differences between the two urges. We conclude that <b>hair</b> <b>pulling</b> urges may be more comparable to ordinary urges such as unhealthy food urges than one might expect, but that <b>hair</b> <b>pulling</b> urges may nevertheless be rated as slightly more severe due to situational characteristics of these urges.

40|$|Objective: To {{examine whether}} {{personality}} traits have predictive validity for trichotillomania (TTM) diagnosis, pulling severity and control, and <b>hair</b> <b>pulling</b> style. Methods: In study 1, logistic regression was used with TTM cases (n= 54) and controls (n= 25) {{to determine if}} NEO Five-Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI) personality domains predicted TTM case vs. control classification. In study 2, hierarchical multiple regression was used with TTM cases (n= 164) to determine whether NEO-FFI personality domains predicted <b>hair</b> <b>pulling</b> severity and control as well as focused and automatic pulling styles. Results: TTM case vs. control status was predicted by NEO-FFI neuroticism. Every 1 -point increase in neuroticism scores resulted in a 10 % greater chance of TTM diagnosis. Higher neuroticism, higher openness, and lower agreeableness were associated with greater pulling severity. Higher neuroticism was also associated with less control over <b>hair</b> <b>pulling.</b> Higher neuroticism and lower openness were associated with greater focused pulling. None of the personality domains predicted automatic <b>hair</b> <b>pulling.</b> Conclusions: Personality traits, especially neuroticism, can predict TTM diagnosis, <b>hair</b> <b>pulling</b> severity and control, and the focused style of pulling.

40|$|Trichotillomania (compulsive <b>hair</b> <b>pulling)</b> in {{children}} is a complex symp-tom for which no single psychodynamic conceptualization has yet been identified. An important predisposing factor for this symptom {{appears to be an}} inconsistent, depriving relationship between mother and child. Some therapists have applied the concept of the "transitional " (soothing) object in treating young children with this disorder. A case of a 5 -year-old retarded boy is presented in which <b>hair</b> <b>pulling</b> occurred in response to psychological trauma (threatened loss of and/or injury to a beloved grandfather). Treatment was carried out through the mother and consisted of her clarifying the traumatic events and the child's anxious and angry feelings about them.
