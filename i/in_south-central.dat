5|$|Related to weapon {{dances and}} war dances is {{the dance of}} the hunt. A very early {{reference}} to a weapon dance of the hunt {{comes in the form}} of a rock engraving at Çatal Höyük, the large neolithic settlement <b>in</b> <b>south-central</b> Anatolia. It depicts a hunting ritual involving dancers holding their bows; one figure has a bow in each hand, two perform artistic leaps and another holds a horn-shaped stick and is striking a frame drum.|$|E
5|$|The {{pursuit of}} full {{dominion}} status was then regarded {{as something of}} a non-issue by most Southern Rhodesian politicians. They viewed themselves as virtually independent already; they lacked only the foreign affairs portfolio and taking this on would mean having to shoulder the expense for high commissions and embassies overseas. Huggins and the United Party instead pursued an initially semi-independent Federation with Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland, two protectorates directly administered from London, with the hope of ultimately creating a single, united dominion <b>in</b> <b>south-central</b> Africa.|$|E

5|$|A {{battle for}} Mogadishu {{followed}} {{in the first half}} of 2006 in which the ARPCT confronted the ICU. However, with local support, the ICU captured the city in June of the year. It then expanded its area of control <b>in</b> <b>south-central</b> Somalia over the following months, assisted militarily by Eritrea. In an effort at reconciliation, TFG and ICU representatives held several rounds of talks in Khartoum under the auspices of the Arab League. The meetings ended unsuccessfully due to uncompromising positions retained by both parties. Hardline Islamists subsequently gained power within the ICU, prompting fears of a Talibanization of the movement.|$|E
5|$|During the Dakota War of 1862, {{in which}} Sitting Bull's {{people were not}} involved, several bands of eastern Dakota people killed an {{estimated}} 300 to 800 settlers and soldiers <b>in</b> <b>south-central</b> Minnesota in response to poor treatment {{by the government and}} in an effort to drive the whites away. Despite being embroiled in the American Civil War, the United States Army retaliated in 1863 and 1864, even against bands which had not been involved in the hostilities. In 1864, two brigades of about 2200 soldiers under Brigadier General Alfred Sully attacked a village. The defenders were led by Sitting Bull, Gall and Inkpaduta. The Lakota and Dakota were driven out, but skirmishing continued into August.|$|E
5|$|Eventually the {{leadership}} of the SRRC and the TNG were reconciled, and the Transitional Federal Government (TFG) was formed in 2004 by Somali politicians in Nairobi. Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed from Puntland was elected as President. The TFG later moved its temporary headquarters to Baidoa. President Yusuf requested that the African Union deploy military forces in Somalia. However, as the AU lacked the resources to do so, Yusuf brought in his own militia from Puntland. Along with the U.S. funding the ARPCT coalition, this alarmed many <b>in</b> <b>south-central</b> Somalia, and recruits flocked to the ascendant Islamic Courts Union (ICU).|$|E

5|$|Poulenc {{was briefly}} a soldier {{again during the}} Second World War; he was called up on 2 June 1940 and served in an {{anti-aircraft}} unit at Bordeaux. After France surrendered to Germany, Poulenc was demobilised from the army on 18 July 1940. He spent the summer of that year {{with family and friends}} at Brive-la-Gaillarde <b>in</b> <b>south-central</b> France. In the early months of the war, he had composed little new music, instead re-orchestrating Les biches and reworking his 1932 Sextet for piano and winds. At Brive-la-Gaillarde he began three new works, and once back at his home in Noizay in October he started on a fourth. These were L'Histoire de Babar, le petit éléphant for piano and narrator, the Cello Sonata, the ballet Les Animaux modèles and the song cycle Banalités.|$|E
5|$|South American aetosaurs {{have been}} found from Argentina, Brazil, and Chile. In Argentina, they are known from the Carnian Ischigualasto Formation. Common genera from Ischigualasto include Aetosauroides and Stagonolepis. In Brazil, fossils {{have been found}} in the Santa Maria and Caturrita Formations in Rio Grande do Sul (Paleorrota). Chilean aetosaurs are {{represented}} by one genus, Chilenosuchus, from the Antofagasta Region. Aetosaurs have also been found from India, which, along with South America, was part of Gondwana during the Late Triassic. Early descriptions of aetosaurs included material from the Maleri Formation <b>in</b> <b>south-central</b> India, although it was too inadequate to assign specimens to any particular genus. Based on such descriptions, the Indian aetosaurs most closely resemble Longosuchus and Paratypothorax. Reports of aetosaurs from Madagascar are based on probable crocodylomorph scutes.|$|E

5|$|Tornadoes {{have been}} {{observed}} and documented on every continent except Antarctica. However, {{the vast majority of}} tornadoes occur in the Tornado Alley region of the United States, although they can occur nearly anywhere in North America. They also occasionally occur <b>in</b> <b>south-central</b> and eastern Asia, northern and east-central South America, Southern Africa, northwestern and southeast Europe, western and southeastern Australia, and New Zealand. Tornadoes can be detected before or as they occur through the use of Pulse-Doppler radar by recognizing patterns in velocity and reflectivity data, such as hook echoes or debris balls, as well as through the efforts of storm spotters.|$|E
5|$|Another Ottoman {{army was}} {{assembled}} in Manastir {{in the summer}} of 1434. Again under the command of Sinan Pasha, this Ottoman expedition was defeated by Gjergj Arianiti <b>in</b> <b>south-central</b> Albania in August 1434. After his defeat, all beys of the territories bordering Albania were ordered to gather their forces and attack the rebels. In December 1434 Ishak Bey, sanjakbey of Üsküb marched into south-central Albania but was defeated by Gjergj Arianiti. Contemporary sources from the senate of Ragusa mention that many Ottoman soldiers were captured, while Ishak Bey escaped with a small group. In April 1435, Arianiti defeated another Ottoman campaign and hostilities virtually ceased until the beginning of 1436, as Murat II's military efforts were focused against Ibrahim of Karaman in Anatolia. At the end of 1435 reports of the Ragusan senate assessed the situation as calm and noted that the belligerents had retreated to their respective territories.|$|E
5|$|Families {{throughout}} Han China made ritual sacrifices {{of animals}} and food to deities, spirits, and ancestors at temples and shrines, {{in the belief that}} these items could be utilized by those in the spiritual realm. It was thought that each person had a two-part soul: the spirit-soul (hun 魂) which journeyed to the afterlife paradise of immortals (xian), and the body-soul (po 魄) which remained in its grave or tomb on earth and was only reunited with the spirit-soul through a ritual ceremony. These tombs were commonly adorned with uniquely decorated hollow clay tiles that function also as a doorjamb to the tomb. Otherwise known as tomb tiles, these artifacts feature holes in {{the top and bottom of}} the tile allowing it to pivot. Similar tiles have been found in the Chengdu area of Sichuan province <b>in</b> <b>south-central</b> China.|$|E

5|$|Husayn entered caliphal {{service in}} 895, and through his {{co-operation}} with the caliphal government, he established {{himself and his}} family {{as the leader of the}} Arabs and Kurds of the Jazira, leading his troops to successful campaigns against the Qarmatians, Dulafids and Tulunids over the next few years. As one of the most distinguished generals of the Abbasid Caliphate, he rose in power and influence until 908, when he was one of the leading conspirators in the abortive coup against Caliph al-Muqtadir. Although the coup failed and Husayn was forced to flee the capital, he soon secured a pardon and served as governor in Jibal, where he again distinguished himself in military operations <b>in</b> <b>south-central</b> Iran. In ca. 911, he was appointed governor in Mosul, where he remained until rising in revolt in 914/5, for reasons that are unclear. Defeated and captured in 916, he was imprisoned in Baghdad, where he was executed in 918. Through his influence, the family rose to high offices, beginning a long period during which Mosul and the entire Jazira were ruled by the Hamdanids. His nephews, Nasir al-Dawla and Sayf al-Dawla, went on to establish autonomous emirates in Mosul and Aleppo respectively.|$|E
5|$|Most {{populations are}} resident, but the {{northern}} and eastern populations are more migratory, relocating to wintering areas between September and November and returning between February and early May. Their range expands northwards into Russia to Siberia during summer, and retracts in winter. They are vagrants to the Faroe Islands, particularly {{in the winter and}} spring, and occasionally to Iceland. Elsewhere, western jackdaws congregate over winter in the Ural Valley in north-western Kazakhstan, the north Caspian, and the Tian Shan region of western China. They are winter visitors to the Quetta Valley in western Pakistan, and are winter vagrants to Lebanon, where they were first recorded in 1962. In Syria, they are winter vagrants and rare residents with some confirmed breeding taking place. The soemmerringii subspecies occurs <b>in</b> <b>south-central</b> Siberia and extreme north-west China and is accidental to Hokkaido, Japan. A small number of western jackdaws reached the north-east of North America in the 1980s and have been found from Atlantic Canada to Pennsylvania. They have also occurred as vagrants in Gibraltar, Mauritania, and Saint Pierre and Miquelon, and one is reported to have been seen in Egypt.|$|E
5|$|While {{paralleling}} {{the coast}} of North Carolina, Irene produced heavy rainfall across the state, peaking at 11inches (280mm) in Ernul with several other locations reporting over 6inches (152mm). The rainfall caused severe river flooding in North Carolina, many of which had not receded from Hurricane Floyd's passage {{less than a month}} earlier. Due to the runoff, the Tar, Cape Fear, and Neuse Rivers all crested above their banks. The flooding also caused a dam <b>in</b> <b>south-central</b> Hoke County to overflow. Irene spawned two tornadoes; an F0 in Onslow County and an F2 in Weeksville. The F2 destroyed 2 trailers, damaged several houses, and injured one person. The heavy flooding closed several roads throughout North Carolina, causing several traffic accidents. Hurricane Irene was indirectly responsible for one death when a man hydroplaned on a wet road and crashed. Despite the severe flooding, Hurricane Irene caused little damage in North Carolina.|$|E
