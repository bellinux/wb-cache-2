30|$|In China, {{there is}} {{approximately}} 1341 Bt of proven coal resource, including 279.58 Bt of basic coal resource for coal mine construction. Among them, coal resource in thick coal seams accounts for 44  % {{of the total}} available. The annual underground coal production from thick coal seams exceeds 45  % of total coal production. Since the Eighties in the last century, {{there have been many}} research projects focusing on mechanical coal extraction from thick coal seams. The mining technologies and systems for thick and ultra-thick coal seams have been gradually developed in China. Until recently, there have been three major mechanical mining methods for thick coal seams, i.e., a <b>fully</b> <b>mechanized</b> longwall top-coal caving mining method (thereafter LTCC mining method), a <b>fully</b> <b>mechanized</b> sub-level coal mining method, and a <b>fully</b> <b>mechanized</b> mining with a large mining height method. There are some limitations with the <b>fully</b> <b>mechanized</b> sub-level coal mining method, including the thickness variation of coal seams, spontaneous combustion, unit mining cost and efficiency. Due to the low production efficiency (Qian and Shi 2003; Wang 2005; 2006 a; Mao and Yao 2010; Wang 2010 a), the <b>fully</b> <b>mechanized</b> sub-level coal mining method is currently replaced by the other two mining methods. Compared with the <b>fully</b> <b>mechanized</b> sub-level coal mining method, the <b>fully</b> <b>mechanized</b> coal mining with a large mining height method can reduce the amount of roadway development, mitigate the tension between mining and development, and simplify the mining process. With the progress of mining technologies and equipment in China, the <b>fully</b> <b>mechanized</b> coal mining with a large mining height method has seen widely used (Yan and Yin 2008; Yan 2009; Yan et al. 2011), and has achieved significant mining profit and coal recovery. The method is only applicable to the coal seams of low dip, relative stable, and good roof conditions, and is also limited by the shearer’s cutting height and coal wall spalling. For this reason, the mining height for one mining pass is 7.0  m (Wang et al. 2012), and cannot meet the requirement for safe and efficient mining in ultra-thick coal seams above 7  m. In terms of ultra-thick coal seams above 7  m, the top-coal caving mining method is the first choice. For coal seams with thicknesses ranging from 7 to 14  m, the top-coal caving mining method can be applied as the technologies and the equipment are well established and manufactured. In order to achieve safe and efficient coal extraction in ultra-thick coal seams with thicknesses ranging from 14 to 20  m, the authors propose a <b>fully</b> <b>mechanized</b> large mining height longwall top-coal caving mining method (thereafter LLTCC mining method), developed a full range of technologies and equipment for a LLTCC mining operation. The technologies and equipment developed have been successfully applied in the Tashan coal mine in Datong, China, and has achieved a production of 10 Mtpa at a LLTCC mining operation in the ultra-thick coal seam. In the early twentieth century, the top-coal caving mining method was applied at steep seams in France, Spain and former Yugoslavia. Due to the low mechanical levels in mining, the method was actually an alternative of the high caving mining method, which was only used as a special mining method under complex geological conditions. At the end of forties and early fifties of the twentieth century, the top-coal caving mining method was used to extract the thick coal seams in the former Soviet Union, France and former Yugoslavia. With the progress of hydraulic support technology, the <b>fully</b> <b>mechanized</b> top-coal caving technology was improved and successfully applied in some countries.|$|R
40|$|AbstractAccording to {{the problem}} that the high {{concentrations}} of <b>fully</b> <b>mechanized</b> caving face is difficult to control, the mathematical model of solving two-phase flow {{of gas and dust}} particles was built by established the k-ɛ-Θ-kp equation. Moreover, by basing on Eulerian-Lagrangian model and Eulerian- Eulerian, and using FLUENT software, the diffusion law of dust pollution in full-mechanized caving face was confirmed. The article focuses on existing conditions that the nozzle arrangement of hydraulic support in <b>fully</b> <b>mechanized</b> caving face is flawed so that it can cot to reduce high concentration dust in working face effectively, so we through the theoretical analysis and field test method and the arrangement of equipment at working faces, when spray of forestope is perpendicular to the coal wall, the angle of spraying of truss frames is found to be 45 ° and the pressure of spraying is 8 MPa. Therefore,we take these arguments as the most optimal nozzle arrangement of hydraulic support in <b>fully</b> <b>mechanized</b> caving face. After the research result is applied to the 1303 <b>fully</b> <b>mechanized</b> face of Dongtan Coal Mine, respirable dust fall rate can be high up to 95. 8 %, dust concentration in working face is reduced effectively, the working condition is mostly improved and the mining is prevented from the danger and low-efficiencies...|$|R
30|$|In {{the case}} of the Gushan Mine, the Pingzhuang coal mining {{district}} of Inner Mongolia, the average thickness of seam 6 - 2 was 7.5  m; the dip angle was 28 °– 41 °, and the hardness coefficient was 0.92 – 1.03. This seam showed various degrees of contact metamorphism. As a result, part of the seam was believed to be unrecoverable. However, guaranteed by the aforementioned key technology and technological research, the safe and efficient mining was achieved under such complex conditions. Industrial tests indicated that the equipment was pretty stable in the <b>fully</b> <b>mechanized</b> top coal caving faces, and top coal recovery was as high as 80  %. This example was a typical <b>fully</b> <b>mechanized</b> top coal caving face of large dip angle with safety and high efficiency, which is a good reference for the equipment antitoppling and antislip in <b>fully</b> <b>mechanized</b> top coal caving faces under similar conditions.|$|R
