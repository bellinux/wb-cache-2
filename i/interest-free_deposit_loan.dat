This paper offers explanations for the unusual success of the Russian banking sector and the determinants of individual bank performance. The evidence comes from balance sheet data for 563 Moscow banks and 160 regional banks on January 1, 1995 and January 1, 1996. Important factors include the Central Bank policy of channelling low-interest directed credits to state enterprises through banks, the ability of banks to obtain large-scale <b>interest-free</b> <b>deposits,</b> and the resulting high interest rate spreads in an environment of high inflation, and the extent to which banks were formerly part of the Soviet system.

40|$|One {{method of}} {{measuring}} {{the prices of}} <b>deposit</b> and <b>loan</b> services is to view the differentials between actual <b>loan</b> and <b>deposit</b> interest rates and appropriate “reference rates ” as the “indirectly measured prices of <b>deposit</b> and <b>loan</b> services. ” In fact, the ONS in the UK and the BLS in the US are considering the adoption {{of this type of}} estimation method for their measurements of <b>deposit</b> and <b>loan</b> services prices. This paper reviews the prior research at the ONS and BLS, identifies the problem points, and examines the feasibility of using published interest rate data “of a constant quality ” to indirectly measure <b>deposit</b> and <b>loan</b> services prices in Japan. The conclusions show: (1) published interest rate data that is indicative and “of a constant quality ” is not available for certain lending rates; and (2) there are logical inconsistencies between the published-interest-rate-data-based method for measuring <b>deposit</b> and <b>loan</b> service prices which is examined in this paper and the input-output tables, which are presently utilized to determine the weights of individual service prices in the Corporate Service Price Index (CSPI). Consequently, the paper concludes that {{it would be difficult to}} incorporate indirectly measured <b>deposit</b> and <b>loan</b> service prices in the CSPI. * The author would like to thank Professor Takanobu Nakajima of Keio University for his useful comments during th...|$|R

A curriculum of 10 units on the concepts of banking and shopkeeper profit was carried out with 38 fourth graders, who were unaware of bank interest.
