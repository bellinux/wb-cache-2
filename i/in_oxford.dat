5|$|In June 1139 {{a knight}} was killed during a fight <b>in</b> <b>Oxford</b> between {{a party of}} Roger of Salisbury's men {{and a group of}} noblemen. The king ordered Roger to attend his court to explain the {{circumstances}} of the incident and to surrender custody of his castles, which Roger refused to do, resulting in his and Alexander's arrest; Roger's other nephew, Nigel, evaded capture. Another possible explanation for the arrests is offered by the Gesta Stephani, a contemporary chronicle, which reported the king's fear that Roger and his nephews were plotting to hand their castles to the Empress Matilda. Stephen may alternatively have been attempting to assert his rights over the castles, and demonstrate his authority over powerful subjects. Alexander was imprisoned <b>in</b> <b>Oxford,</b> in conditions described by some medieval chroniclers as bad.|$|E
