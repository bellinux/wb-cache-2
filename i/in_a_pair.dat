As people are often sized up initially from their basic language skills, these studies suggest that people speaking to autistic individuals {{are more likely to}} overestimate what their audience comprehends.|$|E
30|$|The {{increment}} of {{the random}} traffic {{is larger than}} that of the uniform traffic. The reasons are as follows. Under uniform traffic, the transmission durations of links <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>pairing</b> are diverse <b>in</b> MPMH [1]. The diversities bring about the waste of time slots <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>pairing.</b> The differences among the transmission durations of links <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>pairing</b> under random traffic are worse, which result in further degradations in the throughput performance. However, the transmission durations of links <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>pairing</b> are the same under both traffic patterns in MPMH-SRSC. Thus, it outperforms the MPMH under uniform traffic and has greater performance increment under random traffic.|$|R

5|$|In November 1889, the CLR {{published}} a notice {{of a private}} bill that would be presented to Parliament for the 1890 parliamentary session. The bill proposed an underground electric railway running from the junction of Queen's Road (now Queensway) and Bayswater Road in Bayswater to King William Street in the City of London with {{a connection to the}} then-under construction, City and South London Railway (C) at Arthur Street West. The CLR was to run <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> of tunnels under Bayswater Road, Oxford Street, New Oxford Street, High Holborn, Holborn, Holborn Viaduct, Newgate Street, Cheapside, and Poultry.

5|$|Nelson {{has been}} arrested several times for {{marijuana}} possession. The first occasion was in 1974 in Dallas, Texas. In 1977 after a tour with Hank Cochran, Nelson traveled to The Bahamas. Nelson and Cochran arrived late {{to the airport and}} boarded the flight without luggage. The bags were later sent to them. As Nelson and Cochran claimed their luggage in the Bahamas, a customs officer questioned Nelson after marijuana was found <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> of his jeans. Nelson was arrested and jailed. As Cochran made arrangements to pay the bail, he took Nelson a six-pack of beer to his cell. Nelson was released a few hours later. Inebriated, he fell after he jumped celebrating and was taken to the emergency room. He then appeared before the judge, who dropped the charges but ordered Nelson to never return to the country.|$|E

In Felon, Parker played a rookie guard dealing with inner turmoil. In 2008's The Secret Life of Bees, Parker played the good-hearted love interest of Alicia Keys' character. Parker's character {{has to deal}} with the challenges of spurned love. The movie was written and directed by Gina Prince-Bythewood based on the book of the same name by Sue Monk Kidd.|$|E

5|$|The Australian swellshark is oviparous. Males have larger teeth than females, {{with which}} to bite and hold onto them for copulation. Whether there is a {{specific}} mating season is uncertain, though in terms of sperm production males are capable of breeding year-round. Females have a single functional ovary and two oviducts, ovulating a single egg into each at a time. They can store sperm for at least 15 months. Females produce eggs throughout the year, laying them in pairs approximately once every 20 days from January to June, and once every 30 days {{the rest of the}} year. The second egg <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> is deposited 1224 hours after the first.|$|E
5|$|The James Bay {{hydroelectric}} dam complex contains several {{relatively short}} 735kV power lines that send electricity to three principal substations, ordered from west to east: Radisson, Chissibi, and Lemoyne. From these substations, six 735kV power lines traverse the vast expanses of taiga and boreal forest in clear-cut stretches of land; this shows up clearly in aerial photos. The terrain {{that the power}} lines cross is {{for the most part}} not mountainous, but smooth and replete with lakes. Generally, four of the lines runs together in two pairs and the other two run solo, although the two single lines sometimes do run <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair.</b> Two intermediate 735kV power lines, one in the north and one in the south, connect all six power lines along their path to southern Quebec.|$|E
5|$|The abdomen {{consists}} of ten segments, {{some of which}} may be obscured by a large pair of operculate gills, a thoracic shield (expanded part of the prothorax) or the developing wing pads. In most taxa up to seven pairs of gills arise from the top or sides of the abdomen, but in some species they are under the abdomen, and in a very few species the gills are instead located on the coxae of the legs, or the bases of the maxillae. The abdomen terminates <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> of, or three, slender thread-like projections.|$|E

5|$|The {{evolutionary}} history of snake venom {{is a matter}} of debate. The common view of this history before 2014 was that venom originated just once among all Toxicofera approximately 170 million years ago, and then diversified into the wide range of venoms seen today. Under this hypothesis, the original toxicoferan venom was a very simple set of proteins that were assembled <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> of glands. Subsequently, this set of proteins diversified in the various lineages of toxicoferans, including Serpentes, Anguimorpha, and Iguania. Several snake lineages subsequently lost the ability to produce venom, often due to a change in diet.|$|E
5|$|This tit-tyrant {{appears to}} be {{territorial}} in defending what it regards as its feeding territory, although it only displays territorial behavior against other tufted tit-tyrants. Birds defending their territory, either alone or <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair,</b> tend to begin their defense by calling rapidly and displaying displacement behavior, such as bill wiping or wing flaring. They then raise their crest and chase the other tit-tyrant through the shrubs, occasionally physically attacking the intruder. The victorious tit-tyrant then returns to its normal foraging behavior. The southern subspecies, A. p. patagonicus, migrates to northern Argentina after the breeding season; the other populations appear to be non-migratory.|$|E
5|$|Tombaugh's {{task was}} to {{systematically}} capture sections {{of the night sky}} in pairs of images. Each image <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> was taken two weeks apart. He then placed both images of each section in a machine called a blink comparator, which by exchanging images quickly created a time lapse illusion of the movement of any planetary body. To reduce the chances that a faster-moving (and thus closer) object be mistaken for the new planet, Tombaugh imaged each region near its opposition point, 180 degrees from the Sun, where the apparent retrograde motion for objects beyond Earth's orbit is at its strongest. He also took a third image as a control to eliminate any false results caused by defects in an individual plate. Tombaugh decided to image the entire zodiac, rather than focus on those regions suggested by Lowell.|$|E

5|$|Early in {{the second}} quarter, McCarron threw a 67-yard {{touchdown}} pass to DeAndrew White for a 17–14 lead. However, {{this would be the}} last time the Crimson Tide led in the game as a pair of turnovers by the Crimson Tide later in the quarter directly resulted <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> of Oklahoma touchdowns. After the Sooners tied the game with a 47-yard Michael Hunnicutt field goal, Geneo Grissom recovered a Yeldon fumble at their eight-yard line and returned it to the 34. Seven plays later Knight threw a 43-yard touchdown pass to Saunders for a 24–17 Oklahoma lead. On the next offensive series, McCarron threw his second interception of the game to Zack Sanchez who returned it to the Alabama 13-yard line. On the next play, Sterling Shepard extended the Sooners' lead to 31–17 with his 13-yard touchdown run. The Crimson Tide was able to get into field goal range late, but Foster missed an attempt from 32-yards as time expired for the first half.|$|E
5|$|In January and February 1905, Kaiser Karl der Grosse served {{briefly as}} the {{flagship}} of the squadron.

Individual and squadron training followed, {{with an emphasis}} on gunnery drills. On 12 July, the fleet began a major training exercise in the North Sea. While on the cruise on 18 July, Kaiser Karl der Grosse was detached to visit Antwerp to represent Germany during the celebrations for the 75th anniversary of the Belgian Revolution. The rest of the fleet then cruised through the Kattegat and stopped in Copenhagen and Stockholm; Kaiser Karl der Grosse rejoined them on 3 August in Karlskrona. The summer cruise ended on 9 August, though the autumn maneuvers that would normally have begun shortly thereafter were delayed by a visit from the British Channel Fleet that month.|$|E

5|$|Like all passerines, {{the chicks}} are altricial; {{they are born}} blind and covered only by {{a thin layer of}} down. By seven days, they are {{stretching}} wings and preening, and at two weeks they are able to fly. Parents feed young for at least three weeks after leaving the nest, and have been recorded giving them spiders, and insects such as flies and moths. Males take over feeding young when females begin renesting for the next brood. In a field study near Cooma in southern New South Wales, fledglings were observed to disperse from the natal territory after four to six weeks for a single brood year, and {{in less than a week}} on both occasions <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> which raised two broods in the season. The long breeding season and multiple broods therein are an adaptation to mild climate and high levels of predation. Despite this, on average only two young are successfully fledged per year.|$|E
5|$|NASA {{maintains}} {{a catalog of}} Venus transits covering the period 2000 BCE to 4000 CE. Currently, transits occur only in June or December (see table) and the occurrence of these events slowly drifts, becoming {{later in the year}} by about two days every 243-year cycle. Transits usually occur in pairs, on nearly the same date eight years apart. This is because the length of eight Earth years is almost the same as 13 years on Venus, so every eight years the planets are in roughly the same relative positions. This approximate conjunction usually results <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> of transits, but it is not precise enough to produce a triplet, since Venus arrives 22 hours earlier each time. The last transit not {{to be part of a}} pair was in 1396. The next will be in 3089; in 2854 (the second of the 2846/2854 pair), although Venus will just miss the Sun as seen from the Earth's equator, a partial transit will be visible from some parts of the southern hemisphere.|$|E
5|$|The Knickerbockers did {{not play}} any known games against other clubs from 1847 to 1850. During these years, the team split its players into two squads, which played against each other twice per week. According to Adams, he often {{attempted}} to compel members of the Knickerbockers to attend the sessions. He was only occasionally successful, and when few Knickerbockers came, they played variants of baseball that required fewer players than regular games. Twice in June 1851, the club played against the Washington Base Ball Club, winning by scores of 21–11 and 22–20. No individual statistics are available for the first game; Adams scored twice for the Knickerbockers in the second. In 1853, Adams played in two games against the Gotham Ball Club, tallying seven runs <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> of victories. The two clubs met three times from June to October 1854, and Adams had one run in each game. After splitting the first two contests, their October 26, 1854, game lasted 12 innings before being suspended due to darkness with the score tied 12–12; both teams fell short of the 21 runs that were required to win a game under {{the rules of the}} time.|$|E
