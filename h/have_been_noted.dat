5|$|Burnham was a {{descendant}} of Thomas Burnham (1617–1688) of Hartford, Connecticut, the first American ancestor {{of a large number}} of Burnhams. The descendants of Thomas Burnham <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>noted</b> in every American war, including the French and Indian War.|$|E
5|$|Similarities between Assipatle's {{defeat of}} the monster and other dragon-slayer tales, {{including}} Herakles' destruction of a sea monster to save Hesione, <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>noted</b> by several authors. It {{has been suggested that}} tales of this genre evolved during a period of enlightenment, when human sacrifices to bestial divinities were beginning to be suppressed.|$|E
50|$|The two {{publications}} {{are consistently}} {{ranked among the}} best in the region; Denebola <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>noted</b> as one of the best scholastic online publications in the nation, while The Lion's Roar <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>noted</b> as one of the best scholastic papers in the nation.|$|R

5|$|Since the {{introduction}} of the iPhone 4S, there have been several issues reported by users on internet forums that <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>noted</b> by media organizations such as CNN, Boy Genius Report, The Guardian and PC World.|$|E
5|$|While {{based on}} true events, {{a number of}} {{historical}} inaccuracies in the film <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>noted.</b> Early in the film, the four-man SEAL reconnaissance team is discovered by three goat herders—an elderly man and two teenage boys. In fact, Marcus Luttrell wrote in his book that {{only one of the}} goat herders was a teenage boy, not two.|$|E
5|$|Wong {{appeared}} alongside Marlene Dietrich as a self-sacrificing courtesan in Sternberg's Shanghai Express. Her sexually charged {{scenes with}} Dietrich <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>noted</b> by many commentators and fed rumors {{about the relationship}} between the two stars. Though contemporary reviews focused on Dietrich's acting and Sternberg's direction, film historians today judge that Wong's performance upstaged that of Dietrich.|$|E

5|$|By contrast, a bottlenose's {{sense of}} smell is poor, because its blowhole, the {{analogue}} to the nose, is closed when underwater and it opens only for breathing. It has no olfactory nerves or olfactory lobe in the brain. Bottlenose dolphins are able to detect salty, sweet, bitter (quinine sulphate), and sour (citric acid) tastes, but {{this has not been}} well-studied. Anecdotally, some individuals in captivity <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>noted</b> to have preferences for food fish types, although it is not clear if taste mediates this preference.|$|E
5|$|Dramatic {{declines in}} {{amphibian}} populations, including population crashes and mass localized extinction, <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>noted</b> {{since the late}} 1980s from locations all over the world, and amphibian declines are thus perceived {{to be one of}} the most critical threats to global biodiversity. In 2004, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) reported stating that currently birds, mammals, and amphibians extinction rates were at minimum 48 times greater than natural extinction rates—possibly 1,024 times higher.|$|E
5|$|Helpers, {{offspring}} {{from the}} previous brood, have sometimes been noted to assist in feeding the fledglings at the nest of their parents. Cases of brood parasitism by the Asian koel <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>noted.</b> An average breeding success of 44% has been noted with {{the main cause of}} fledgling mortality being shortage of insect food which in turn was dependent on rainfall.|$|E

5|$|In South Africa, a few {{records of}} {{hybridization}} with the white-faced whistling duck <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>noted</b> in the wild, although {{in most parts}} of southern Africa, the two species breed at different times, bicolor during the dry season (April to September) and viduata during the rains (October to March). Hybridization in captivity is more frequent but limited to other species in the genus Dendrocygna.|$|E
5|$|Males {{initiate}} copulation by mounting {{the female}} and tilting her hear back 90 degrees. The male then secures his position by biting and pulling {{back on the}} hairs {{at the base of}} the female’s skull. The male then uses his thumbs to further stabilize his position and enters the female under her interfemoral membrane. Both individuals <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>noted</b> to be very quiet during the copulation process. Once the process is over the male dismounts the female and flies away to find another mate.|$|E
5|$|Philatelists {{distinguish}} several minor {{variations among}} the series. For the 10 centimes, some slight colour variations exist, described as grey-brown (brun-gris) and russet-brown (brun-roux). In the 20 centimes, variations in dark blue (bleu-foncé) and milky blue (bleu-laiteux) <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>noted.</b> Of all the colour variations, the russet-brown examples commanding the highest premium among collectors. Some double-printed (error) stamps are also known.|$|E

25|$|A notable {{decrease}} in QSER1 expression <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>noted</b> in renal mesangial cells {{in response to}} treatment with 25 mM glucose. This condition was studied as differential expression of genes involved in cell cycle regulation <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>noted</b> in these cells in response to high glucose levels seen with diabetes mellitus.|$|R

5|$|Reviewers {{have noted}} {{similarities}} between this album {{and those of}} musicians and composers in several musical genres—from pop to contemporary classical, even show tunes and jazz-based time signatures. The lyrics and their rich thematic elements <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>noted</b> for their literary quality, earning comparisons to Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau, William Carlos Williams, and Walt Whitman. Genre labels that have been applied to the album include indie folk, indie pop, baroque pop, indie rock, folk rock, , chamber folk, and lo-fi.|$|E
5|$|The {{arrival of}} Mercator on the cartographic scene would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>noted</b> by the cognoscenti who {{purchased}} Gemma's globe—the professors, rich merchants, prelates, aristocrats and courtiers {{of the emperor}} Charles V at nearby Brussels. The commissions and patronage of such wealthy individuals would provide {{an important source of}} income throughout his life. His connection with this world of privilege was facilitated by his fellow student Antoine Perrenot, soon to be appointed Bishop of Arras, and Antoine's father, Nicholas Perrenot, the Chancellor of CharlesV.|$|E
5|$|The breed has a {{reputation}} for being healthy with a long lifespan. Breeders have protected the gene pool, and direct in-line breeding has been prevented. Jack Russells can live from 13 to 16 years given proper care. However, certain lines <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>noted</b> for having specific health concerns and, therefore, could occur in any line or generation because of recessive genes. These issues can include hereditary cataracts, ectopia lentis, congenital deafness, patellar luxation, ataxia, myasthenia gravis, Legg–Calvé–Perthes syndrome, and von Willebrand disease.|$|E

5|$|The {{cattle egret}} engages in {{low levels of}} brood parasitism, {{and there are a}} few {{instances}} of cattle egret eggs being laid in the nests of snowy egrets and little blue herons, although these eggs seldom hatch. There is also evidence of low levels of intraspecific brood parasitism, with females laying eggs in the nests of other cattle egrets. As much as 30% extra-pair copulations <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>noted.</b>|$|E
5|$|Tree sparrows {{are also}} subject to {{bacterial}} and viral infections. Bacteria {{have been shown}} to be an important factor in the failure of eggs to hatch and in nestling mortality, and mass deaths due to Salmonella infection <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>noted</b> in Japan. Avian malaria parasites have been found in the blood of many populations, and birds in China were found to harbour a strain of H5N1 that was highly virulent to chickens.|$|E
5|$|A few lemurs <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>noted</b> to have {{relatively}} large brains. The extinct Hadropithecus was {{as large as}} a large male baboon and had a comparably sized brain, giving it the largest brain size relative to body size among all prosimians. The aye-aye also has a large brain-to-body ratio, which may indicate a higher level of intelligence. However, despite having a built-in tool in the form of its thin, elongated middle finger, which it uses to fish for insect grubs, the aye-aye has tested poorly in the use of extraneous tools.|$|E
