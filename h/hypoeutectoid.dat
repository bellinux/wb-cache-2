5|$|When steels with exactly 0.8% carbon (known as a {{eutectoid}} steel), are cooled, the austenitic phase (FCC) of {{the mixture}} attempts {{to revert to}} the ferrite phase (BCC). The carbon no longer fits within the FCC austenite structure, resulting in an excess of carbon. One way for carbon to leave the austenite is for it to precipitate out of solution as cementite, leaving behind a surrounding phase of BCC iron called ferrite with {{a small percentage of}} carbon in solution. The two, ferrite and cementite, precipitate simultaneously producing a layered structure called pearlite, named for its resemblance to mother of pearl. In a hypereutectoid composition (greater than 0.8% carbon), the carbon will first precipitate out as large inclusions of cementite at the austenite grain boundaries until the percenage of carbon in the grains has decreased to the eutectoid composition (0.8% carbon), at which point the pearlite structure forms. For steels that have less than 0.8% carbon (<b>hypoeutectoid),</b> ferrite will first form within the grains until the remaining composition rises to 0.8% of carbon, at which point the pearlite structure will form. No large inclusions of cementite will form at the boundaries in hypoeuctoid steel. The above assumes that the cooling process is very slow, allowing enough time for the carbon to migrate.|$|E
50|$|A <b>hypoeutectoid</b> steel {{contains}} {{less than}} 0.77% carbon.

This eutectoid mixture will then crystallize as a microstructure of pearlite. Since ferrite is softer than pearlite, the two microstructures combine to increase the ductility of the alloy. Consequently, the hardenability of the alloy is lowered.|$|E

50|$|Isothermal annealing: It is {{a process}} in which <b>hypoeutectoid</b> steel is heated above the upper {{critical}} temperature.

50|$|Eutectoid steel can in {{principle}} be transformed completely into pearlite; <b>hypoeutectoid</b> steels {{can also be}} completely pearlitic if transformed at a temperature below the normal eutectoid. Pearlite can be hard and strong but is not particularly tough. It can be wear resistant because of a strong lamellar network of ferrite and cementite. Examples of applications include cutting tools, high strength wires, knives, chisels, and nails.|$|E
50|$|When {{titanium}} hydrides {{with less}} than 1.3% hydrogen, known as <b>hypoeutectoid</b> titanium hydride are cooled, the β-titanium phase of the mixture attempts to revert to the α-titanium phase, resulting in an excess of hydrogen.

50|$|The {{eutectoid}} {{composition of}} austenite is approximately 0.76% carbon; steel with less carbon content (<b>hypoeutectoid</b> steel) will contain a corresponding proportion of relatively pure ferrite crystallites {{that do not}} participate in the eutectoid reaction and cannot transform into pearlite. Likewise steels with higher carbon content (hypereutectoid steels) will form cementite before reaching the eutectoid point. The proportion of ferrite and cementite forming above the eutectoid point can be calculated from the iron/iron—carbide equilibrium phase diagram using the lever rule.|$|E

50|$|To {{produce the}} right amount of {{hardness}} in the finished product, the smith generally begins with steel that has a carbon content that is higher than desired. In ancient times, forging often began with steel that had a carbon content much too high for normal use. Most ancient forge-welding began with hypereutectoid steel, containing a carbon content sometimes well above 1.0%. Hypereutectoid steels are typically too brittle to be useful in a finished product, {{but by the end of}} forging the steel typically had a high carbon-content ranging from 0.8% (eutectoid tool-steel) to 0.5% (<b>hypoeutectoid</b> spring-steel).|$|E
5000|$|Similarly, a <b>hypoeutectoid</b> alloy has two {{critical}} temperatures, called [...] "arrests." [...] Between these two temperatures, the alloy will exist partly {{as the solution}} and partly as a separate crystallizing phase, called the [...] "proeutectoid phase." [...] These two temperatures are called the upper (A3) and lower (A1) transformation temperatures.

5000|$|An {{important}} aspect {{in the development}} of the European sword between the early and high medieval periods is the availability of high-quality steel.Migration period as well as early medieval sword blades were primarily produced by the technique of pattern welding, also known as [...] "false Damascus" [...] steel.Blooms of high-quality steel large enough to produce an entire sword blade were only rarely available in Europe at the time, mostly via import from Central Asia, where a crucible steel industry began to establish itself from c. the 8th century.Higher quality swords made after AD 1000 are increasingly likely to have crucible steel blades.

5000|$|During {{the folding}} process, {{most of the}} {{impurities}} are removed from the steel, continuously refining the steel while forging. By the end of forging, the steel produced was among the purest steel-alloys of the ancient world. Due to the continuous heating the steel tends to decarburize, so a good quantity of carbon is either extracted from the steel as carbon dioxide or redistributed more evenly through diffusion, leaving a nearly eutectoid composition (containing 0.77 to 0.8% carbon). The edge-steel itself will generally {{end up with a}} composition that ranges from eutectoid to slightly <b>hypoeutectoid</b> (containing a carbon content under the eutectoid composition), giving enough hardenability without sacrificing ductility The skin-steel generally has slightly less carbon, often in the range of 0.5%.

5000|$|The {{purpose of}} heat {{treating}} carbon steel {{is to change}} the mechanical properties of steel, usually ductility, hardness, yield strength, or impact resistance. Note that the electrical and thermal conductivity are only slightly altered. As with most strengthening techniques for steel, Young's modulus (elasticity) is unaffected. All treatments of steel trade ductility for increased strength and vice versa. Iron has a higher solubility for carbon in the austenite phase; therefore all heat treatments, except spheroidizing and process annealing, start by heating the steel to a temperature at which the austenitic phase can exist. The steel is then quenched (heat drawn out) at a moderate to low rate allowing carbon to diffuse out of the austenite forming iron-carbide (cementite) to precipitate leaving ferrite, or at a high rate, trapping the carbon within the iron thus forming martensite. The rate at which the steel is cooled through the eutectoid temperature (about 727°C) affects the rate at which carbon diffuses out of austenite and forms cementite. Generally speaking, cooling swiftly will leave iron carbide finely dispersed and produce a fine grained pearlite and cooling slowly will give a coarser pearlite. Cooling a <b>hypoeutectoid</b> steel (less than 0.77 wt% C) results in a lamellar-pearlitic structure of iron carbide layers with α-ferrite (nearly pure iron) between. If it is hypereutectoid steel (more than 0.77 wt% C) then the structure is full pearlite with small grains (larger than the pearlite lamella) of cementite formed on the grain boundaries. A eutectoid steel (0.77% carbon) will have a pearlite structure throughout the grains with no cementite at the boundaries. The relative amounts of constituents are found using the lever rule. The following is a list of the types of heat treatments possible: ...|$|E

Findings: The nine possible schemes of splitting the first derivative curve of <b>hypoeutectoid</b> steels dilatograms were developed.

40|$|Grain growth during {{austenitization}} has {{a negative}} effect on fatigue strength. Several methods have been investigated in order to determine an accurate method of measuring the austenite grain size of 4340 steel. The McQuaid-Ehn method, an industry standard for evaluating austenite grain size, has been recognized to produce inaccurate results due to the coarsening of grains during extended austenitizing. A method utilized for <b>hypoeutectoid</b> steels, outlined by the ASTM-E 112 standard, is investigated to potentially obtain more accurate results by reducing the duration of austenitizing. Studies regarding effective etching procedures for revealing austenite grains without austenitizing are also addressed. Samples are prepared by heat treating to induce temper embrittlement in order to improve etching at these grain boundaries. Although temper embrittlement is undesirable for components in service, the process proved to effectively delineate austenite grain boundaries when etched with a picric acid based reagent. This method may be utilized to acquire an accurate measurement of austenite grain size during processing. The picric acid reagent was unsuccessful when applied to the McQuaid-Ehn and <b>Hypoeutectoid</b> samples.

Microstructural characterization of these materials {{was carried out by}} scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy. The occurrence of eutectoid decomposition in the rapidly solidified alloys was attributed to the breakaway of the ribbons or flakes (while still at an elevated temperature) from the quench wheel, resulting subsequently in a lower cooling rate. Fast quenching, as obtained in the hammer-and-anvil process, resulted in a martensitic structure free from products of eutectoid decomposition. The eutectoid morphology was nonlamellar in <b>hypoeutectoid</b> alloy ribbons, while a hitherto unreported lamellar eutectoid was observed in the near-eutectoid ribbons and flakes.

40|$|A {{number of}} {{morphological}} features of pearlite were revealed through {{scanning electron microscopy}} using deeply etched specimens. These include cementite branching, bridging, gaps, holes and curvature. The presence of cementite thin films or networks along the austenite grain boundaries in eutectoid steel and at the interface between pearlite and proeutectoid ferrite in <b>hypoeutectoid</b> steel is another characteristic of pearlite. Further-more, ferrite thin films surrounding the proeutectoid cementite in hypereutectoid steels are also observed. Hence, it is considered that in <b>hypoeutectoid</b> steels the nucleus for pearlite is a film of cementite rather than the expected proeutectoid ferrite and, similarly, in hypereutectoid steels pearlite forms from a ferrite film rather than from proeutectoid cementite. Convergent beam Kikuchi line diffraction was used to accurately determine the orientation relationships between pearlitic constituents and parent austenite in a Hadfields steel. The results show that neither the pearlitic ferrite nor the cementite is crystallographically related to the austenite grain into which the pearlite was growing and to that into which it was not growing. in addition, a new orientation relationship between pearlitic cementite and ferrite in the Hadfield steel was also observed.

40|$|This paper reviews recent {{research}} {{results on the}} formation and the pitting susceptibility of passive films formed on iron and iron-based alloys in neutral solutions, obtained in authors’ groups with electrochemical techniques including linear sweep voltammetry, alternative current impedance, electrochemical nose, and scan reference electrode techniques. At first, the formation process of the passive film on iron in neutral aqueous is described. The process involves the formations of Fe(OH) 2, Fe 3 O 4 and Fe 2 O 3. The content of Fe 2 + in a passive film reflects {{the stability of the}} passive film. Then, the electronic properties and the pitting susceptibility of passive films formed on iron and an iron-based alloy and their relation are considered. The passive film formed on iron or iron-based alloy has a structure with point defects that consist of metal interstitials, metal vacancies and oxygen vacancies. The nature of the passive film depends on the point defects that can be represented by the donor density of the passive film. Mott-Schottky relation can be used to determine the electronic properties of the passive film. The relationship between reciprocal square capacitance and potential meeting the Mott-Schottky behavior is limited at a narrow range of low potentials. At higher potentials, the reciprocal capacitance not reciprocal square capacitance is proportional to potential, which is ascribed to the increasing thickness of the passive film with potential. The pitting susceptibility of a passive film is proportional to the donor density of the passive film and influenced by the formation potential of the passive film, inhibitors and microstructures of base metals. The stability of a passive film increases with increasing formation potential of the passive film. In the case of the formation of passive films by inorganic inhibitors, the stability of the passive film formed by chromate is best, followed by nitrite and then bicarbonate. The passive film formed on ferrite is most unstable, followed by martensite and then <b>hypoeutectoid.</b> There exists interaction between different microstructures, which results in pitting initiation and propagation on the microstructure with a weaker passive film.
