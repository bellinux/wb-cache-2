5|$|It may be {{possible}} to exploit RNA interference <b>in</b> <b>therapy.</b> Although it is difficult to introduce long dsRNA strands into mammalian cells due to the interferon response, the use of short interfering RNA has been more successful. Among the first applications to reach clinical trials were in the treatment of macular degeneration and respiratory syncytial virus. RNAi has also been shown to be effective in reversing induced liver failure in mouse models.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the {{homicide}} department is requiring all the detectives to take sensitivity training with therapist Carry Westin (Jennifer Mendenhall). While {{most of them}} have positive experiences with her, Bolander (Ned Beatty) flatly refuses to participate and repeatedly avoids their scheduled sessions. When Gee (Yaphet Kotto) tells Bolander he will be suspended without pay if he does not meet with her, Bolander chooses the suspension, but later reconsiders after his partner Munch (Richard Belzer) harasses him at the bar until he changes his mind. When they finally meet, Bolander explains he does not trust therapists because when going through marriage counseling with his ex-wife, the therapist actively encouraged her to leave Bolander. He feels he was cheated out of $7,000 <b>in</b> <b>therapy</b> bills, but Westin explains his anger is not from the money, but from feelings of betrayal by his ex-wife. Bolander is ultimately impressed by Westin and even decides to ask her on a date, but she strongly hints she is a lesbian.|$|E
5|$|Players {{assume the}} role of a person {{suffering}} from depression, and the story centers on their daily life, including encounters at work and their relationship with their girlfriend. The story also features various treatments for depression. Players are periodically faced with choices that alter the course of the story. To make a choice, the player must click on the corresponding hyperlink. However, choices are often crossed out and cannot be clicked on, a mechanism that Depression Quest uses to portray the character's mental state and the fact that logical decisions may not be available to them. Beneath the choices presented to the player are a set of statements about the character, indicating their level of depression, {{whether or not they are}} <b>in</b> <b>therapy,</b> and whether or not they are currently on medication.|$|E

Following the associated publicity, some advocates of attachment therapy began to alter views and practices to be less potentially dangerous to children.

Since this is a single-case study, it is difficult to say something conclusive about the relevance and transferability of the results to other songwriting projects <b>in</b> music <b>therapy</b> among drug addicts.
