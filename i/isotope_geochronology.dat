Five major episodes of magmatism, deformation, and high-grade regional meta-morphism are recognized: Taconian (455 - 442 Ma), Acadian (423 - 385 Ma), Neo-Acadian (366 - 350 Ma), Late Pennsylvanian (300 - 290 Ma) and Alleghanian (280 - 260 Ma). In the Taconian, the passive margin of Laurentia was subducted below a complex magmatic arc lasting from 480 to 442 Ma, founded in part on continental crust of a Medial New England terrane with possible affinities with Amazonia. Questions about Medial New England involve its coherence as a single plate, {{and the nature of}} its underlying crust.

40|$|The use of {{relative}} structural timing and <b>isotope</b> <b>geochronology</b> as means of correlating Precambrian orogenic belts and testing {{the role of}} continental drift in crustal assembly was first proposed by Holmes (1951), using the network of Proterozoic orogenic belts and Archaean cratons of south-central Africa as an example. Subsequent work in the region emphasized a limited role for relative lateral movements, based principally on a distinctive outcrop pattern in which older belts occur {{on both sides of}} younger cross-cutting belts with no apparent offset. This spatial relationship is more consistent with ensialic rejuvenation than with continental collision (Kröner 1977), and perhaps the best known of these cross-cutting relationships is that between the Irumide and Zambezi belts. The Zambezi Belt is part of an east-west trending zone of Neoproterozoic tectonism that passes westwards into the Damara Orogen. It is associated with eclogite relics and reworking of older basement blocks including possible island arc and ophiolite terranes, and Coward & Daly (1984) noted that high-strain structures within the belt are consistent with significant sinistral transcurrent movement and oblique collision along a probable plate margin.

The currently accepted age of the 24 km diameter Boltysh crater, a K-Ar whole-rock age, places it in the Coniacian at 88 +/- 3 Ma.

Several of the fresh samples exhibit signs of excess argon but this seems to be concentrated in rapidly crystallized glass-rich samples. The Ar-Ar age confirms an earlier fission track measurement and thus two dating techniques have yielded an age within errors of the K/T boundary for this crater. Crucially, although the ages of Boltysh and Chixculub are within errors, they may not have formed synchronously. Craters of 24 kin diameter occur much more commonly than impacts of Chixculub dimensions, but their proximity does raise the important question of how many impacts there might have been close to the K/T boundary...|$|E

Here, sequence stratigraphic techniques may be used in order to detect tectonic movements which are an order of magnitude higher resolution than those routinely identified by either standard structural analysis or <b>isotope</b> <b>geochronology.</b> This study proves that what has been previously interpreted as a one stage growing anticline situated at the contact with the core of the orogen is, in fact, a gradually evolving antiform structure with at least four quantifiable pulses of vertical movements associated with various amounts of orogenic uplift. During collision, the interplay between the orogenic core and the anticline uplift controls the depositional area, the effects of sea-level variations being subordinated.

40|$|Over {{the last}} 100 years, the Galveston Bay (GB) Estuary has {{experienced}} {{a wide range of}} anthropogenic activities. The bay?s watershed and shoreline contains one of the largest concentrations of petroleum and chemical industries in the world, with the greatest concentration within the lower San Jacinto River/Houston Ship Channel (SJR/HSC). Extensive groundwater has been withdrawn to support these industries, and an expanding population has resulted in elevated land subsidence, with the highest rates in the lower SJR/HSC (3 cm yr^- 1, > 3 m) decreasing seaward throughout the bay to 0. 6 cm yr^- 1 near Galveston Island. Due to the industrial, commercial, and residential importance of the GB watershed, understanding the sources of sediment, and the rates of accumulation is imperative in determining the concentration, inventory and fluxes of trace metals (e. g., Hg) in the environment. Moreover, these data may be used to minimize the impact on public health, and reconstruct the historical input for improving management strategies. To examine the anthropogenic alteration in the system, 22 sediment vibra-cores were collected throughout the bay and analyzed using ^ 210 Pb and ^ 137 Cs radioisotope geochronology, grain size, XRF, X-radiography, Hg concentration, lignin content and composition, and stable carbon and nitrogen <b>isotopes.</b> <b>Geochronology</b> from these cores was used to determine sedimentation rates and correlated to Hg profiles to estimate input histories. The results show the highest sedimentation rates correspond to areas of highest Relative Sea Level Rise (RSLR), and are of the same order of magnitude. In general, sedimentation rates are as much as 50 % of RSLR, indicating that sedimentation has not kept pace with land subsidence. Profiles show significant input of Hg beginning in the 1900 s, with highest concentrations between the 1960 s- 1970 s, with a substantial decrease in concentration since, demonstrating it to be a valuable geochronology tool. Hg concentrations were found to be significantly higher proximal to the SJR/HSC, progressively decreasing seaward and to distal parts of the bay.

We provide in this study integrated in situ analyses of zircon U–Pb age and O–Hf isotopes for the troctolite and albitite within the Chenaillet Ophiolite. Our new results indicate that the troctolite and albitite crystallized synchronously at ~ 165 Ma.

In the East Lake Athabasca region of the western Canadian Shield, high pressure granulites (∼ 1. 0 + GPa) make up one of the largest exposed deep crustal terranes in the world (3 ̆e 20, 000 km 2). Important insight into the exhumation history of this region come from the study of the kinematics, timing, and metamorphic evolution of a several km-wide, oblique-slip, thrust-sense mylonitic shear zone (Legs Lake shear zone) that forms a major boundary of the high-pressure terrane.

Stratigraphic continuity within the study area is demonstrated by the large number of drill holes in the area.

40|$|Quantitative {{constraints}} on the ages of melt-forming impact events on the Moon are based primarily on <b>isotope</b> <b>geochronology</b> of returned samples. However, interpreting the results of such studies can often be difficult because the provenance region of any sample returned from the lunar surface may have experienced multiple impact events {{over the course of}} billions of years of bombardment. We illustrate this problem with new laser microprobe 40 Ar/ 39 Ar data for two Apollo 17 impact melt breccias. Whereas one sample yields a straightforward result, indicating a single melt-forming event at ca. 3. 83 Ga, data from the other sample document multiple impact melt–forming events between ca. 3. 81 Ga and at least as young as ca. 3. 27 Ga. Notably, published zircon U/Pb data indicate the existence of even older melt products in the same sample. The revelation of multiple impact events through 40 Ar/ 39 Ar geochronology is likely not to have been possible using standard incremental heating methods alone, demonstrating the complementarity of the laser microprobe technique. Evidence for 3. 83 Ga to 3. 81 Ga melt components in these samples reinforces emerging interpretations that Apollo 17 impact breccia samples include a significant component of ejecta from the Imbrium basin impact. Collectively, our results underscore the need to quantitatively resolve the ages of different melt generations from multiple samples to improve our current understanding of the lunar impact record, and to establish the absolute ages of important impact structures encountered during future exploration missions in the inner Solar System...|$|E
40|$|The {{temporal}} relationship between tectonic and volcanic activity on passive continental margins immediately {{before and after}} the initiation of mid-ocean ridge spreading is poorly understood because of the scarcity of volcanic samples on which to perform <b>isotope</b> <b>geochronology.</b> We present the first accurate geochronological constraints from a suite of volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks dredged from the 70, 000 km² submerged Wallaby Plateau situated on the Western Australian passive margin. Plagioclase ⁴⁰Ar/³⁹Ar and zircon U-Pb sensitive high-resolution ion microprobe ages indicate that a portion of the plateau formed at ca. 124 Ma. These ages are at least 6 m. y. younger than the oldest oceanic crust in adjacent abyssal plains (minimum = 130 Ma). Geochemical data indicate that the Wallaby Plateau volcanic samples are enriched tholeiitic basalt, similar to continental flood basalts, including the spatially and temporally proximal Bunbury Basalt in southwestern Australia. Thus, the Wallaby Plateau volcanism could be regarded as a (small) flood basalt event on the order of 10 ⁴- 10 ⁵ km³. We suggest that magma could not erupt prior to 124 Ma {{because of the lack of}} space adjacent to the plateau. Eruption was made possible at 124 Ma via the opening of the Indian Ocean during the breakup of Greater India and Australia along the Wallaby-Zenith Fracture Zone. The scale of volcanism and the temporal proximity to breakup challenges the prevailing theory that the Western Australian margin formed as a volcanic passive margin. Given that the volume of volcanism is too small for typical flood basalts associated with volcanic passive margins, we suggest that the two end members, magma-poor and volcanic passive margins, should rather be treated as a continuum. 4 page(s...|$|E

The timing of this event coincides with the Chewings Orogeny which largely shaped the tectonic geology further west in the Reynolds and Anmatjira Ranges. During the Chewings Orogeny the c. 1790 Ma D 1 structures were transposed into a composite S 1 /S 2 fabric. Map scale F 2 folding is interpreted to have a shallow plunge suggesting that the S 1 fabric may have originally been shallow dipping, raising the possibility that deformation was extensional in nature, and coeval with deposition of the nearby Reynolds Range Group which is constrained to the interval 1806 - 1785 Ma. Although inferred here to be Yambah aged, the timing constraints for D 1 /M 1 also overlap with the c. 1800 Ma Stafford Event which was associated with voluminous felsic magmatism, mafic magmatism and extreme geothermal gradient magmatism. This suggests that an extended period of extension, sedimentation, magmatism and deformation may have occurred at around 1800 Ma in the central Aileron Province. Thesis (B. Sc.

40|$|Mass-spectrometric {{methods of}} {{measurement}} of Ar <b>isotopes</b> for К/Аr <b>geochronology</b> after of some key development (Inghram et al., 1950, Standacher et al., 1978) are developed on {{a way of}} perfection low background equipments. Achievement low background conditions measurement of Аr isotopes is extremely a challenge, requires greater efforts {{and a lot of}} time. Here, we report a new laser GC-MS method that incorporates helium carrier gas and chromatography methods (conflo) that allow for rapid analyses for small samples. The Ar gas is swept into the mass spectrometer in a helium carrier gas, allowing for extremely small samples to be quantitatively transferred (< 5. 10 - 13 g). The laser GC-MS technique consists of six components: the overall high vacuum extraction line, the system of input tracer 38 Ar, the sample chamber, the laser, the gas chromatograph...|$|R
40|$|K-feldspars form {{important}} detrital and authigenic {{components in}} sediments {{but may be}} difficult to separate by conventional means for <b>isotope</b> analysis, particularly <b>geochronology.</b> UV lasers are being increasing applied to in situ analysis since they are strongly absorbed by clear minerals such as K-feldspar, and can achieve a spatial resolution of better than 20 mum for individual Ar/Ar analyses. Here we demonstrate separation of detrital K-feldspar {{with a mean age of}} 423 +/- 14 Ma and authigenic overgrowths with a mean age of 138 +/- 5 Ma in elastic sediments from the Msolwa Group of the Kilombero Rift of Tanzania. The young age obtained for authigenic K-feldspar overgrowth demonstrates that precipitation occurred more than 160 Ma after sedimentation, during the period of deepest burial and synchronous with the initial extensional phases of the intracontinental Anza and Sudan rifts, as well as the initial stages in the break-up and separation of South America and Africa...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} a {{synthesis}} of available data on the Velay dome that include both small- and large-scale lithologic and structural mapping, strain analysis, <b>isotope</b> geochemistry, <b>geochronology</b> and pressure – temperature estimates. The Velay dome, {{one of the largest}} granite–migmatite domes of the Variscan Belt, formed during orogenic collapse at around 300 Ma. Its study allows an assessment of the thermal and geodynamic context leading to voluminous crustal anatexis of the Variscan orogenic crust. A first melting stage developed in connection with south-verging thrust zones during the Early Carboniferous, leading to a crustal thickening estimated at 20 km minimum. The involvement of fertile lithologies and the intrusion of plutons of deep origin contributed to the development of water-saturated melts. The volume of biotite granite extracted from melt during this period was limited. The second phase of melting, corresponded to generalized melting of gneiss achieved by biotite-dehydration melting reactions and accompanied by the generation of cordierite-bearing granites. At this stage, crustal-scale detachment faults were active and partially obliterated the earlier structures. The new structures were progressively tilted to the vertical at the margin of the Velay dome due to the southward and lateral ballooning of the granitic dome. The reconstructed P, T path indicate that the large volume of melt produced was a consequence of a significant increase in temperature at the onset of biotite dehydration melting. At the base of the crust, this melting event is coeval with granulite facies metamorphism associated to underplating of mantle-derived magmas as suggested by the geochemical signature of Late Paleozoic lower crustal xenoliths sampled by Cenozoic volcanoes an...|$|R
