5|$|Offenbach often {{composed}} amidst {{noise and}} distractions. According to Keck, Offenbach would first {{make a note}} of melodies a libretto suggested {{to him in a}} notebook or straight onto the librettist’s manuscript. Next using full score manuscript paper he wrote down vocal parts in the centre, then a piano accompaniment at the bottom possibly with notes on orchestration. When Offenbach <b>felt</b> <b>sure</b> the work would be performed, he began full orchestration, often employing a codified system.|$|E
5|$|When he was fifteen, Vainio <b>felt</b> <b>sure</b> {{he would}} become a writer. As a young man he read a book about poetics, and later said that the rules were easy to break once he had learned them. It became {{apparent}} in essays written whilst at the gymnasium that Juha had talent as a writer. However, teachers sometimes had mixed feelings about his writing; at one time he received no grade for a lighthearted column-like text he had written, because the teacher felt {{that it could not}} be graded as an essay. Although essays were his strong point, school was uninteresting for Juha. He considered quitting school, but the principal persuaded him to change his mind. He was transferred to another school and was later joined there by his friend Risto Warjus. In the end, the only school subjects in which Vainio excelled were singing and sports.|$|E
5|$|Chief Gunner's Mate Michael B. Wallrath, who had {{assisted}} in lowering three lifeboats while he remained on board, jumped overboard after seeing {{to it that}} all the boats were away. Wallrath was pulled into lifeboat number 6 just before a wave capsized it and drowned two of its occupants. Lieutenant commander R. B. Vandervoort, USNRF, West Gates commanding officer, remained on board until he <b>felt</b> <b>sure</b> that the entire crew had departed the sinking ship. When he climbed up on the deckhouse to cut free a life raft and leave the ship, he discovered six men huddled on deck. Vandervoort {{was able to get}} the six on the life raft, but the suction caused by West Gates final plunge pulled him away and below the surface. After he managed {{to get back to the}} surface, he clung to floating wreckage for two hours until pulled aboard the very raft he had missed earlier. Vandervoort and the six men aboard the raft were rescued by one of Americans lifeboats at 06:00, after some 3½ hours in the water.|$|E
60|$|There was {{an influx}} of guests. Mrs. Bullsom, reduced {{to a state of}} chaotic nervousness, was pushed as far into the {{background}} as possible by her daughters, and Mr. Bullsom, banished from the hearth where he <b>felt</b> <b>surest</b> of himself, plunged into a conversation with Mr. Seventon on the weather. Brooks leaned over towards Mary.|$|R
60|$|She {{seemed a}} little taken aback. My tone, I <b>felt</b> quite <b>sure,</b> was convincing.|$|R

5|$|In April, 1972 he was reassigned {{from the}} SAC to TAC {{and to the}} 42nd Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron (42 TEWS), 388th Tactical Fighter Wing, at Korat, Thailand. He was {{familiar}} with targeting both SAC missiles and SAC airplanes, {{was one of the}} most knowledgeable missile and electronic counter-measures experts in Vietnam, and it is likely that his situation was quickly reported to U.S. intelligence services. Very few Americans remained on the ground in Vietnam, and the NVA made it a point to track particularly valuable personnel, even in Thailand. The North Vietnamese were probably supported by the Russians with decrypting American message traffic and they likely knew exactly who had parachuted into their midst. This ability was likely enabled by the then unknown American spy CWO John Anthony Walker, who had given the Soviets a radio cipher card and other high-value intelligence. Hambleton's capture would be a terrific blow to American airpower around the world and a huge prize for the North Vietnamese and indirectly, the Soviets. Hambleton said after the war that he <b>felt</b> <b>sure</b> if he were captured that he would never have been taken to Hanoi.|$|E
25|$|Trained by {{her father}} George and {{inspired}} by an illustrious club-mate, international long jumper and pentathlete Mary Rand, she concentrated on the sprints from the 1964 season {{with an emphasis on}} strength work and with a view to eventually moving up from the short sprints to the 440 and 880 yards, where George <b>felt</b> <b>sure</b> her future lay. She made her debut over both 220 yds and 880 yds in 1964, winning both events in times of 26.2 and 2:30.8, respectively.|$|E
25|$|Emma Donoghue, {{who also}} wrote the novel {{on which the}} film is based, wrote the {{screenplay}} for the film before the novel was published in 2010. She explained she <b>felt</b> <b>sure</b> the book could {{be made into a}} film because of its structured storyline, and received many offers from filmmakers after it was published, which she rejected for creative reasons. Director Lenny Abrahamson read the novel and sent Donoghue a 10-page fan letter telling her it should be a film, without knowing a screenplay already existed. Donoghue felt the letter demonstrated an understanding of her work and advocated for him as director.|$|E
60|$|I cannot {{tell the}} bitter {{disappointment}} that took possession of me when my search {{proved to be}} of so little avail; for I had <b>felt</b> so <b>sure</b> of finding the jewel or some traces of it, and had <b>felt</b> so <b>sure</b> {{of being able to}} secure it again, that I could not bear to give up my search, but continued it after every hope had expired.|$|R
60|$|But now Numa was {{crouching}} for the spring. Very slowly Tarzan {{raised his}} {{gun to his}} shoulder. He had never killed a large animal {{with a gun in}} all his life--heretofore he had depended upon his spear, his poisoned arrows, his rope, his knife, or his bare hands. Instinctively he wished that he had his arrows and his knife--he would have <b>felt</b> <b>surer</b> with them.|$|R

25|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{frequently}} discussed topic in the play's critical history is that of authorship. None of the three quarto editions of Titus name the author, which was normal for Elizabethan plays. However, Francis Meres does list the play as one of Shakespeare's tragedies in Palladis Tamia in 1598. Additionally, John Heminges and Henry Condell <b>felt</b> <b>sure</b> enough of Shakespeare's authorship to include it in the First Folio in 1623. As such, with what little available solid evidence suggesting that Shakespeare did indeed write the play, questions of authorship {{tend to focus on}} the perceived lack of quality in the writing, and often the play's resemblance to the work of contemporaneous dramatists.|$|E
25|$|One day he {{suddenly}} finds {{the energy to}} get out of bed and rededicates himself to architecture, something Summer had pressured him to do. He makes a list of firms he wants to work for, assembles a portfolio, and goes to job interviews. On day 488, Summer is waiting for Tom at his favorite spot in the city and they talk. Summer explains that Tom was right about true love existing; he was just wrong about it being with her. She says she got married because she <b>felt</b> <b>sure</b> about her husband, something she wasn't with Tom. Summer puts her hand on Tom's and says she is glad to see he is doing well. As she leaves, Tom tells her he really hopes she is happy.|$|E
25|$|In Ireland in 1904, {{on leave}} from Africa from that year until 1905, Casement joined the Gaelic League, an {{organisation}} established in 1893 to preserve and revive the spoken and literary use of the Irish language. He met {{the leaders of the}} powerful Irish Parliamentary Party (IPP) to lobby for his work in the Congo. He did not support those, like the IPP, proposing Home Rule, as he <b>felt</b> <b>sure</b> that the House of Lords would always veto their efforts as its peers had done many times before. He was more impressed by Arthur Griffith's new Sinn Féin party, which called for Irish independence through a non-violent series of strikes and boycotts, modeled on the policy of Ferenc Deák in Hungary, and he joined the party in 1905.|$|E

25|$|In 1977 the government, {{although}} reasonably unpopular, <b>felt</b> <b>sure</b> of {{an election}} victory and June date for the poll was fixed. The National Coalition's spirits had been buoyed up {{by the actions of}} the Minister for Local Government, James Tully. In {{what became known as the}} Tullymander (a pun on the word gerrymander) he re-drew every constituency in Ireland (as he had authority to do), apparently favouring Fine Gael and Labour Party candidates. However, when the election took place the coalition was swept out of office by Fianna Fáil which won an unprecedented twenty seat Dáil majority and over 50% of the first preference votes. Lynch himself received the biggest personal vote in the state. Although the large parliamentary majority seemed to restore Lynch as an electoral asset, the fact that the party was returned with an enormous vote allowed Lynch to be undermined by many new TDs who were not loyal to Lynch and wanted him removed.|$|E
25|$|The {{king and}} Foliot responded to these actions with the {{summoning}} of a council {{that was held}} at London around 24 June 1166. The council sent letters both to the pope and to Becket, appealing against the excommunications. After the dispatch of these letters, letters from the archbishop were delivered to Foliot, ordering him to publicize Becket's decisions, and disallowing any appeal to the papacy against the archbishop's sentences. Foliot and the bishops then once again sent letters to the papacy, probably from Northampton on 6 July. A more concrete effort was {{the appeal of the}} king to the Cistercian Order's general convocation in 1166, protesting the aid the Cistercian monasteries of Potigny, Cercamp and Rigny had given to Becket and threatening to expel the order from Henry's lands. Although the Order did not exactly expel Becket from Potigny, a delegation of Cistercians did meet with Becket, pointing out that while they would not throw him out, they <b>felt</b> <b>sure</b> that he would not wish to bring harm to the Order. Becket then secured aid from the king of France, who offered a sanctuary at Sens.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, in Paris, a {{more liberal}} {{government}} under the Vicomte de Martignac took office in January 1828, after an election in which the Bourbon kingdom of France's tiny electorate of 74,000 mainly aristocratic voters turned against the ultra-conservative faction. Eager to court popularity, de Martignac announced in April 1828 that, {{in view of the}} failure of diplomatic efforts, France would despatch an expeditionary force of 13,000 elite troops to expel the Egyptian and Ottoman forces from the Peloponnese. The news was greeted with wild enthusiasm by the Parisian public. As urgent preparations began in France's Mediterranean ports, Ibrahim Pasha told his father that he felt confident he could repel the French. But since the sinking of his expensive modern fleet, Ali had lost all appetite for military confrontation with the Great Powers. Ibrahim's motley force of Egyptian peasants and Albanian mercenaries, he <b>felt</b> <b>sure,</b> would stand no chance against the French professionals, who were largely officered by battle-hardened veterans of Napoleon's army. Ali now engaged in serious negotiations with Codrington, who had been despatched by London to Alexandria to try to forestall the French intervention. In August, Ali agreed terms with Codrington for the withdrawal of his forces from the Peloponnese. Ibrahim initially refused to comply with his father's evacuation orders, but gave way shortly after the French troops landed in Navarino Bay at the end of August, to a jubilant reception by the Greeks. The Egyptians finally left in October 1828, a year after the naval battle. The French proceeded to clear the remaining Ottoman garrisons in the Peloponnese, which offered only token resistance, by the end of 1828. In the subsequent months, Greek forces regained control of central Greece in a lightning campaign.|$|E

500|$|The British fleet {{was soon}} heavily engaged, passing down the French line and {{engaging}} their ships one by one. Nelson on Vanguard personally engaged Spartiate, also coming {{under fire from}} Aquilon. At about eight o'clock, he was with Berry on the quarter-deck when a piece of French shot struck him in his forehead. He fell to the deck, a flap of torn skin obscuring his good eye. Blinded and half stunned, he <b>felt</b> <b>sure</b> he would die and cried out [...] "I am killed. Remember me to my wife." [...] He was taken below {{to be seen by}} the surgeon. After examining Nelson, the surgeon pronounced the wound non-threatening and applied a temporary bandage.|$|E
500|$|In 1984, Stefan Dennis {{received}} a phone call from his agent who told him about an audition for a new soap called Neighbours. Dennis said [...] "I wasn't that keen because I was more interested in a feature film I had auditioned for and <b>felt</b> <b>sure</b> I was going to get". Dennis originally auditioned for the roles of Shane Ramsay and Des Clarke (the roles were later given to Peter O'Brien and Paul Keane respectively), but was cast as Paul Robinson instead. Neighbours was cancelled by Seven Network seven months after its debut. However, it was revived by Network Ten and Dennis reprised his role as Paul from January 1986 onwards. He is the only current cast member who appeared in the first episode on 18 March 1985.|$|E
500|$|At {{the age of}} nine, Swift became {{interested}} in musical theater and performed in four Berks Youth Theatre Academy productions. She also traveled regularly to New York City for vocal and acting lessons. Swift later shifted her focus toward country music inspired by Shania Twain's songs, which made her [...] "want to just run around the block four times and daydream about everything". She spent her weekends performing at local festivals and events. After watching a documentary about Faith Hill, Swift <b>felt</b> <b>sure</b> {{that she needed to}} go to Nashville, Tennessee, to pursue a music career. At the age of eleven, she traveled with her mother to visit Nashville record labels and submitted a demo tape of Dolly Parton and Dixie Chicks karaoke covers. However, she was rejected since [...] "everyone in that town wanted to do what I wanted to do. So, I kept thinking to myself, I need {{to figure out a way}} to be different".|$|E

500|$|The {{monument}} {{was completed}} swiftly once the location was agreed; {{the total cost}} was £2,700 (1927), of which 10% was Lutyens' fee. The design and the proposed location {{continued to be a}} source of controversy in the local community. Some residents felt that the memorial would not be in keeping with the city's existing architecture, but Bignold <b>felt</b> <b>sure</b> that he had the backing of the ex-service community. He noted that the Guildhall was in a central location and as one of Norwich's most famous buildings was a significant attraction for visitors, and thus that siting the memorial there would display Norwich's pride in its contribution to the war. In response to criticisms of the design, he wrote that [...] "the form of any war memorial depends entirely on the sum of money available for its construction. Knowing this sum, we consulted Sir Edwin Lutyens as to the best means of expending it. [...] We felt that all reasonable persons would be satisfied by the expert opinion of the man who gave London its Cenotaph".|$|E
500|$|At 17:40, West Bridges engine {{broke down}} {{once again and}} her crew was unable to repair it. West Bridge, falling {{off the back of}} the convoy and adrift, {{signaled}} Marseillaise to request a tow. At sundown, shortly before 18:00, Montanan—still in the convoy, which was by now some [...] ahead of West Bridge—was hit by one of three torpedoes launched by German submarine [...] Montanan began to settle and was quickly abandoned. On West Bridge, Lieutenant Commander Hawkins realized the potential for another submarine attack and ordered his crew to general quarters and reduced the number of men in the mechanical spaces below decks. Noma sailed back to West Bridge, ordered the freighter to extinguish her lights, and stood by. At nearly the same time, [...] approached and launched two torpedoes at the stationary cargo ship, scoring hits with both. The first struck near the No. 3 cargo hold {{in the front of the}} ship, while the second hit amidships near the engine room. West Bridge immediately began listing to starboard, and Hawkins ordered the crew to abandon the vessel. He and two crewmen remained behind until they <b>felt</b> <b>sure</b> that everyone else had departed. By the time they left the stricken ship, water was up to the gunwales and lapping at the well deck.|$|E
