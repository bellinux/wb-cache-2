5|$|Isis {{was one of}} many non-Greek deities whose cults {{became part}} of Greek and Roman {{religion}} during the Hellenistic period (323–30 BCE), when Greek people and culture spread to lands across the Mediterranean and most of those same lands were conquered by the Roman Republic. Under the influence of Greco-Roman tradition, some of these cults, including that of Isis, developed their own mystery rites. The mysteries of Isis could <b>have</b> <b>emerged</b> <b>as</b> far back as the early third century BCE, after the Greek Ptolemaic dynasty had taken control of Egypt. The Ptolemies promoted the cult of the god Serapis, who incorporated traits of Osiris and of Greek deities like Dionysus and the underworld god Pluto. Isis's cult was conjoined with that of Serapis. She too was reinterpreted to resemble Greek goddesses, particularly Demeter, while retaining many of her Egyptian characteristics. The mysteries of Isis, modeled on those in Demeter's honor at Eleusis, could have been developed at the same time, as part of this mingling of Greek and Egyptian religion.|$|E
5|$|Phosphorus, {{selenium}} and lead, {{which are}} less often recognised as metalloids, {{are also used}} in glasses. Phosphate glass has a substrate of phosphorus pentoxide (P2O5), rather than the silica (SiO2) of conventional silicate glasses. It is used, for example, to make sodium lamps. Selenium compounds can be used both as decolourising agents and to add a red colour to glass. Decorative glassware made of traditional lead glass contains at least 30% lead(II) oxide (PbO); lead glass used for radiation shielding may have up to 65% PbO. Lead-based glasses have also been extensively used in electronics components; enamelling; sealing and glazing materials; and solar cells. Bismuth based oxide glasses <b>have</b> <b>emerged</b> <b>as</b> a less toxic replacement for lead {{in many of these}} applications.|$|E

25|$|Several {{theories}} <b>have</b> <b>emerged</b> <b>as</b> to {{the motives}} for the hijacking.

25|$|In 1954 an econometric test by Wassily W.

This problem {{became known as the}} Leontief paradox. Alternative trade models and various explanations for the paradox <b>have</b> <b>emerged</b> <b>as</b> a result of the paradox. One such trade model, the Linder hypothesis, suggests that goods are traded based on similar demand rather than differences in supply side factors (i.e., H–O's factor endowments).|$|E

The program has successfully empowered women and raised rural wages, but has also attracted the ire of landowners who have to pay farm laborers more due to a higher prevailing wage.

In this last, Leopold {{sought to}} give his younger son the entire Spanish inheritance, {{disregarding}} {{the will of the}} late Charles II. Leopold started a war that soon engulfed much of Europe. The early years of the war went fairly well for Austria, with victories at Schellenberg and Blenheim, but the war would drag on till 1714, nine years after Leopold's death, which barely had an effect on the warring nations. When peace returned, Austria could not be said to <b>have</b> <b>emerged</b> <b>as</b> triumphant as it had from the war against the Turks.|$|E
25|$|The {{movement}} {{initiated by}} Ghulam Ahmad – {{which is often}} seen to <b>have</b> <b>emerged</b> <b>as</b> an Islamic religious response to the Christian and Arya Samaj missionary activity widespread in 19th century India, and is viewed by its adherents as embodying the promised latter day revival of Islam – has, since its establishment, grown in organisational strength and in its own missionary programme {{under the leadership of}} its caliphate. Although it has expanded to over 200 countries and territories of the world, numbering an estimated 10 to 20 million, it has received a largely negative (often hostile) response from mainstream Muslims who view Ghulam Ahmad as a false messiah and his teachings as heretical, particularly the teaching that he was a prophet.|$|E
25|$|The Ahmadiyya {{movement}} {{was founded in}} 1889 by Mirza Ghulam Ahmad of Qadian. He {{claimed to be the}} promised messiah and mahdi awaited by the Muslims and obtained a considerable number of followers initially within the United Provinces, the Punjab and Sindh. Ahmadis claim the Ahmadiyya movement to embody the latter day revival of Islam and the movement has also been seen to <b>have</b> <b>emerged</b> <b>as</b> an Islamic religious response to the Christian and Arya Samaj missionary activity that was widespread in 19th century India. After the death of Ghulam Ahmad, his successors directed the Ahmadiyya Community from Qadian which remained the headquarters of the community until 1947 with the creation of Pakistan. The movement has grown in organisational strength and in its own missionary programme and has expanded to over 200 countries as of 2014 but has received a largely negative response from mainstream Muslims who see it as heretical, due mainly to Ghulam Ahmad's claim to be a prophet within Islam.|$|E
