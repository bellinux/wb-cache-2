40|$|International audience: The {{cumulative}} duration of depressive episodes, and their repetition, has a detrimental effect on depression recurrence {{rates and the}} chances of antidepressant response, and even {{increases the risk of}} dementia, raising the possibility that depressive episodes could be neurotoxic. Psychomotor retardation could constitute a marker of this negative burden of past depressive episodes, with conflicting findings according to the use of clinical versus cognitive assessments. We assessed the role of the Retardation Depressive Scale (filled in by the clinician) and the time required to perform the neurocognitive d 2 attention test and the Trail Making Test (performed by patients) in a sample of 2048 depressed outpatients, before and after 6 to 8 weeks of treatment with agomelatine. From this sample, 1140 patients performed the TMT-A and -B, and 508 performed the d 2 test, at baseline and after treatment. At baseline, we found that with more past depressive episodes patients had more severe clinical level of psychomotor retardation, and that they needed more time to perform both d 2 and TMT. When the analyses were performed again after treatment, and <b>especially</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>analyses</b> were restricted to patients with clinical remission, the cognitive tests were the only ones correlated with past depressive episodes. Psychomotor retardation tested at a cognitive level was therefore systematically revealing the burden of past depressive episodes, with an increased weight for patients with less remaining symptoms. If prospectively confirmed, interventions such as cognitive remediation therapy could benefit from a more specific focus on neurocognitive retardation...|$|E

However, the genetic basis and environmental determinants of both asymmetry types {{is far from}} being completely known. The analysis of facial asymmetries in admixed individuais can be of help to characterize the impact of a genome's heterozygosity on the deveiopmental basis of both fl. uctuating and directional asymmetries. Here we characterize the association between genetic ancestry and individual asymmetry on a sample of Latin-American admixed populations. To do so, three-dimensional (3 D) facial shape attributes were explored on a sample of 4, 104 volunteers aged between 18 and 85 years. Individual ancestry and heterozygosity was estimated using more than 730, 000 genome-wide markers. Multivariate techniques applied to geometric morphometric data were used to evaluate the magnitude and significance of directional and ftuctuating asymmetry (FA), as well as correiations and multipie regressions aimed to estimate the relationship between facial FA scores and heterozygosity and a set of covariates. Resuits indicate that directional and FA are both signi:ficant, the former being the strongest expression of asymmetry in this sample. In addition, our analyses suggest that there are some specific patterns of facial asymmetries characterizing the different ancestry groups. Finally, we find that more heterozygous individuais exhibit lower leveis of asymmetry. Our results highlight the importance of including ancestry-admixture estimators, <b>especially</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>analyses</b> are aimed to compare leveis of asymmetries on groups differing on socioeconomic leveis, as a proxy to estimate developmental noise...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{investigates the}} nonlinear response up to collapse of masonry arches and arch bridges using advanced numerical descriptions. Past {{research has shown}} that the mesoscale modelling approach for brick-masonry, where bricks and mortar joints are modelled separately, may offer a realistic representation of the mechanical behaviour of masonry components. However, because of the significant computational cost, thus far the use of this modelling strategy has been mainly restricted to 2 D analysis of masonry arches and arch bridges. In some cases this may lead to a crude representation of the response which is inherently three-dimensional, <b>especially</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>analysed</b> structure is subjected to eccentric loading or is characterised by a complex geometry (e. g. skew arches). In this work, masonry arches and arch bridges are analysed using a partitioned mesoscale approach, which enables the use of a detailed model for describing material nonlinearity at structural scale. This is combined with a partitioned approach allowing for parallel computation which guarantees computational efficiency. In the 3 D mesoscale description, brick units and mortar interfaces are modelled separately accounting for the actual texture and arrangement of masonry. 3 D elastic continuum solid elements are used to model brick units while mortar interfaces are modelled by means of 2 D nonlinear interface elements. In <b>analysing</b> masonry bridges, <b>the</b> backfill material is modelled as an elasto-plastic continuum, while the physical interface between the continuum and mesoscale domain for masonry is represented by nonlinear zero-thickness interface elements allowing separation and plastic sliding. The proposed modelling approach has been applied to the analysis of multi-ring square and skew arches and masonry arch bridges. The numerical results, which also include numerical-experimental comparisons, confirm the accuracy of the adopted numerical strategy. Moreover numerical simulations have been performed to investigate the effects of the arch geometry, loading positions, material characteristics and potential settlements at the supports. The results obtained offer important information and a detailed description on the complex response of these critical structural systems under different loading and boundary conditions.

One simply uses the constructed eigenstates to diagonalize the homogeneous {{parts of the}} SBEs and SLEs. Under the steady-state conditions, the resulting equations can be solved analytically when one further approximates dephasing due to higher-order many-body effects. When such effects are fully included, one must resort to a numeric approach. After the exciton states are obtained, one can eventually express the linear absorption and steady-state photoluminescence analytically.|$|R
40|$|The {{trend towards}} {{realistic}} numerical models of (pathologic) patient-specific vascular structures brings along larger computational domains {{and more complex}} geometries, increasing both the computation time and the operator time. Hexahedral grids effectively lower the computational run time and the required computational infrastructure, but at high cost in terms of operator time and minimal cell quality, <b>especially</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> computational <b>analyses</b> are targeting complex geometries such as aneurysm necks, severe stenoses and bifurcations. Moreover, such grids generally do not allow local refinements. As an attempt to overcome these limitations, a novel approach to hexahedral meshing is proposed in this paper, which combines the automated generation of multi-block structures with a grid-based method. The robustness of the novel approach is tested on common complex geometries, such as tree-like structures (including trifurcations), stenoses, and aneurysms. Additionally, {{the performance of the}} generated grid is assessed using two numerical examples. In the first example, a grid sensitivity analysis is performed for blood flow simulated in an abdominal mouse aorta and compared to tetrahedral grids with a prismatic boundary layer. In the second example, the fluid-structure interaction in a model of an aorta with aortic coarctation is simulated and the effect of local grid refinement is analyzed...|$|R
40|$|The very aim {{of every}} brain-computer {{interface}} (BCI) is to translate stimulated brain activity into a relevant computer command. This highly depends on error free processing methods and systematic regression or classification. Classification process {{is carried out}} for predicting the categories of test data. The brain processes multiple functions simultaneously resulting in a complex EEG (Electroencephalogram) pattern. Further, {{the characteristics of the}} P 300 component are difficult to be determined a priori <b>especially</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> signals are <b>analysed</b> on single trial basis.

In this paper, we used the robust classification model Fuzzy ARTMAP to craft an efficient non-invasive P 300 based BCI from single trial visual evoked potential (VEP) signals. Fuzzy ARTMAP is an ART network for the association of analog pattern in supervised mode and is capable of overcoming the stability-Plasticity dilemma [1]. In this experiment, the VEP signals extracted during individual trials from able and severely disable bodied subjects are classified using the feature signal pattern. The high accuracy obtained as classification percentages validates the suitability of our proposed Fuzzy ARTMAP classification for single trial approach in BCI...|$|R

Various considerations must be taken to lyse the microbial cell wall of each microbe. In the present article, we compare several tissue lysis steps and commercial purification kits, to achieve a joint RNA and DNA purification protocol for the purpose of investigating the microbiota and the microbiota-host interactions in a single colonic mucosal tissue sample. Results A further optimised tissue homogenisation and lysis protocol comprising mechanical bead beating, lysis buffer replacement and enzymatic treatment, in combination with the AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) resulted in efficient and simultaneous purification of microbial and human RNA and DNA from a single mucosal colonic tissue sample. Conclusions The present work provides a unique possibility to study RNA and DNA from the same mucosal biopsy sample, making a direct comparison between metabolically active microbes and total microbial DNA. The protocol also offers an opportunity to investigate other members of a microbiota such as viruses, fungi and micro-eukaryotes, and moreover the possibility to extract data on microbiota and host interactions from one single mucosal biopsy...|$|R
40|$|Purpose Several {{factors may}} {{influence}} cycling performance and effort intensity during cycling competitions. The present study aimed {{to investigate the}} conditions that may influence the initial acceleration during the first 5 m of a cycling competition, particularly riding position, starting angle of the crank and hand position on handlebars. To this aim, eight male cyclists amateur were tested in laboratory and on track. Methods Surface electromyography was also used to verify the influence of upper body on muscle activity. Moreover, to verify the results, 59 professional cyclists were observed on the track using the same set-up. Results Standing position increased by 10 % the initial speed and acceleration compared to seated position. A starting crank angle of 71 ° and {{the position of the}} hands on the upper bar of the handlebar also improved the acceleration. The effects of these parameters were additive and, therefore, the acceleration with standing position and initial crank angle of 71 ° was about 35 % greater than that with seated position with an initial crank angle of 47 °. Conclusions These effects were <b>especially</b> important <b>when</b> <b>analysing</b> <b>the</b> results of competitive athletes, which also showed better initial acceleration under spontaneously adopted optimal initial conditions. 2014 Springer-Verlag Italia...|$|R
40|$|The {{question}} of learner participation or involvement in school governance {{has been a}} thorny issue in South Africa for decades. This study investigated secondary learners’ participation in the governance of their schools through representation by the Representative Council of Learners (RCLs), formerly known as school representative councils (SRCs). The study attempted {{to find out how}} learners participation is perceived by both the RCLs and the School Management Teams (SMTs). The study was conducted in five secondary schools in the Eastern Cape townships of Grahamstown. The research participants were members of School Management Teams and Representative Councils of Learners from these schools. The study was oriented in an interpretive paradigm following a qualitative approach. Questionnaires and in-depth semi-structured interviews were used to explore the perceptions of the two groups involved. The Department of Education documents that sanction RCL participation were referred to throughout and <b>especially</b> <b>when</b> <b>analysing</b> <b>the</b> respondents’ views. The main finding of the study is that learner involvement in school governance is still problematic, though it is presently provided for by policies that govern schools, including the South African Schools Act and the Guides for Representative Councils of Learners of 1999, in which their roles are outlined. The findings of the study reveal an indecisive and autocratic mindset among educators regarding the issue of learner involvement in governance and management. Furthermore, the Department of Education documents in place betray a narrow conception of RCL participation in school governance and still display an element of mistrust towards the learners concerning their roles in governance. As a result of these forces, the democratic potential of learner participation is undermined, and RCLs compromised as legitimate stakeholders. ...|$|R
40|$|Background: Glioblastoma is {{the most}} common and {{aggressive}} type of glioma and associated with poor prognosis. Apart from ionizing radiation and some rare genetic disorders, few aetiological factors have been identified for primary brain tumours. Inverse associations to asthma and low IgG levels for varicella zoster virus have in previous studies indicated that the immune system {{may play a role in}} glioma development. Little is known about prognostic factors in glioma. Previous studies have shown an association between age, Karnofsky performance status, O 6 -methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) hypermethylation, and prognosis. Polymorphisms in different low penetrance genes have in some studies been associated with glioma prognosis. Material and methods: In paper I, we analysed IgG levels for four different viruses, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), varicella zoster virus (VZV) and adenovirus (Ad), in prediagnostic blood samples from 197 cases with glioma and 394 controls collected from three large cohorts: the Northern Sweden Health and Disease Study; the Malmö Diet and Cancer Study; and the Diet, Cancer and Health cohort from Copenhagen. ELISA was used to measure IgG levels and for EBV response to both the nuclear antigen (EBNA 1) and the viral capsid antigen (VCA) was measured, for VCA using immunoflourescence. IgG levels were divided into quartiles and binary logistic regression was used to compare the quartiles in cases and controls. All odds ratios were adjusted for age, sex, and cohort. In paper II-IV, we studied 176 glioblastoma cases from Sweden and Denmark. We collected treatment and follow-up data on the cases. We genotyped 30 tagging SNPs in EGF, 89 in EGFR, 27 in VEGFR 2, and 17 in VEGF. We also studied 1458 SNPs in 136 DNA repair genes. Hazard ratios were calculated using Cox regression; the major allele was set as categorical variable and all HR were adjusted for age, sex, country, and treatment. For the DNA repair gene results, we adjusted the p-values for multiple testing. Significant findings were confirmed in separate datasets. Results and Discussion: We found a trend towards higher IgG VZV levels in controls compared to glioma cases, <b>especially</b> <b>when</b> restricting <b>the</b> <b>analyses</b> to only include glioma cases with at least 2 years between blood sample and diagnosis. This finding might indicate that there is an aetiological and not a disease-related association. This confirms previous findings and support that a strong immune system can detect and inhibit growth of small cancer clusters. In EGF, we found seven SNPs in one haplotype block that were significantly associated with glioblastoma survival. Four of the SNPs were available for confirmation; however, none reached statistical significance. One explanation could be age differences in the different cohorts. In EGFR, four SNPs associated with survival were found; however, as 89 polymorphisms were tested this was the expected outcome by chance. In VEGF and VEGFR 2, we found two SNPs associated with glioblastoma survival, but they could not be confirmed in the separate dataset, and due to multiple testing, were considered to be false positives. Among the DNA repair genes, we found nine SNPs in three genes-MSH 2, RAD 51 L 1 and RECQL 4 -associated with glioblastoma survival after confirmation and adjustment for age, sex, country, and treatment. After adjusting for multiple testing, one SNP in MSH 2 and one in RECQL 4 remained significant. Conclusions: Our studies provide additional knowledge to the aetiological and prognostic factors important for glioma, emphasising the possible importance of immune function mechanisms. We found limited evidence for the role of genetic variants in glioma progression genes, and some for DNA repair variants as prognostic factors for glioblastoma survival...|$|R

40|$|Household debt in South Korea is {{high and}} still rising. Household debt to GDP ratio had risen at the similar pace with that in the US until 2007 but it has still been rising whereas it has been falling since 2017 in the US. As a result, it is now higher in South Korea than in the US. There was a {{dramatic}} growth in household debt in the US preceding the recent Great Recession and high level of household debt was viewed to amplify the severity of economic recession in the US constraining consumer spending. In this context, high and continuously rising household debt could be a potential risk factor for the South Korean economy. Macroprudential policy, which indicates policy aims to reduce financial systemic risk pre-emptively, is a crucial measure {{to slow down the}} pace of household debt growth in South Korea. However, there is no established tool to analyse or evaluate its effects and relationship to monetary policy. The second chapter presents the trend and distribution of household debt in South Korea, and brief history of policy responses to continuously increasing household debt. The third chapter shows how macroprudential policy works by using a simple heterogeneous DSGE model with collateral constraint. The model is based on so-called borrower-saver model. Despite of its simplicity, the model can clearly explain how macroprudential policy affects household debt and related variables in South Korea. In addition, dynamics of this model imply increasing amortisation rate is superior measure to decreasing LTV ratio because it induces less volatility in economy. The collateral constraint in this thesis is designed to distinguish household debt (stock) and borrowing (flow). As a result, it is more realistic than the one mostly used in literature. This collateral constraint setting contributes to <b>the</b> better results <b>especially</b> <b>when</b> we <b>analyse</b> <b>the</b> phase of tightening household credit conditions. Furthermore, it enables us to see how amortization rate affects the South Korean economy. The fourth chapter extends the model mainly to see how credit tightening and monetary policy work differently and how they interact. Habit formation in non-durable good consumption, price rigidity in non-durable good producers, fixed cost in intermediate good production and monetary policy are added in the model. Not only the newly added elements themselves but also inflation make model's responses different from those in the previous chapter. Nominal and real rigidities make dynamics last longer and more realistic. Due to the structure of collateral constraint, a rise in inflation can reduce the level of real household debt whereas there is no inflation effect on real household debt with the common type of collateral constraint. This also influences responses to monetary policy shock. The results demonstrate credit tightening is better than monetary policy in slowing down the growth rate of household debt. Among all policy measures considered, decreasing amortization rate is the most effective and increasing LTV ratio is the second. These implies that ongoing policy efforts to slow down the growth rate of household debt in South Korea is on the right track. The fifth chapter shows welfare effects of macroprudential policy. The results illustrate it is impossible to get social welfare gains in a situation given in South Korea when discretionary macroprudential policy comes into effect. If government adopts countercyclical macroprudential rule, it is possible to improve social welfare but it requires welfare loss either of borrower or saver...|$|R
