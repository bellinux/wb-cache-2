50|$|The {{import prices}} for shrimp {{fluctuate}} wildly. In 2003, the import {{price per kilogram}} shrimp in the United States was US$8.80, slightly higher than in Japan at US$8.00. The average import price in the EU was only about US$5.00/kg; this much lower value is {{explained by the fact}} that the EU imports more coldwater shrimp (from catches) that are much smaller than the farmed warm water species, and thus attain lower prices. In addition, Mediterranean Europe prefers <b>head-on</b> <b>shrimp,</b> which weigh approximately 30% more, but have a lower unit price.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The U. S. shrimp farming {{industry}} has been expanding in the southern U. S. in response to strong market demand for shrimp. U. S. farmers have difficulty competing with imports in frozen shrimp commodity markets. This study identified the shrimp purchasing behavior and preferences of seafood wholesalers and retailers in nine southeastern U. S. states to provide shrimp farmers the market information needed to develop successful marketing strategies. Results of a mail survey, including a conjoint analysis experiment, of the seafood dealers are presented and discussed. There appears to be strong market potential for fresh, farm-raised shrimp {{in a variety of}} sizes, but there is considerable dealer resistance to the whole or live, <b>head-on</b> <b>shrimp</b> form. Shrimp farmers interested in successfully marketing to seafood dealers may be required to process their product in order to offer shrimp tails, rather than whole shrimp...|$|E
50|$|Extensive shrimp farms using {{traditional}} low-density methods are invariably {{located on a}} coast and often in mangrove areas. The ponds range from just a few to more than 100 hectares; shrimp are stocked at low densities (2-3 animals per square metre, or 25,000/ha). The tides provide for some water exchange, and the shrimp feed on naturally occurring organisms. In some areas, farmers even grow wild shrimp by just opening the gates and impounding wild larvae. Prevalent in poorer or less developed countries where land prices are low, extensive farms produce annual yields from 50 to 500 kg/ha of <b>shrimp</b> (<b>head-on</b> weight). They have low production costs (US$1-3/kg live shrimp), are not very labor-intensive, and do not require advanced technical skills.|$|R
30|$|For pre-cooking, whole <b>shrimp</b> (<b>head-on)</b> {{were placed}} in the {{stainless}} cooking pot filled with boiling water (100 °C) using a shrimp/water ratio of 1 : 3 (w/v). The samples were pre-cooked until the core temperature of the second segment of the shrimp reached 80 °C. The come-up time was approximately 3 min. Pre-cooked samples were suddenly transferred into the temperature-controlled water bath (Memmert, Schwabach, Germany) at 80 °C and were held for 0, 15, 30, 60, and 120 s. To measure the core temperature, the thermocouple (Union, Kowloon, Hong Kong) was inserted {{into the middle of the}} second segment of abdomen. After heating for a designated time, the samples were cooled rapidly in iced water for 1 min, and then the shrimp samples were drained for 5 min at 4 °C. The samples referred to as ‘pre-cooked shrimp’ were subjected to analyses and subsequent storage.|$|R
