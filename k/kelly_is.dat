5|$|New {{office manager}} Deangelo Vickers (Will Ferrell) picks {{favorites}} among the staff, including Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner), Jim Halpert (John Krasinski), a sycophantic Gabe Lewis (Zach Woods), and Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson), who is attending business school thanks to Deangelo.

Novak), who {{he believes is}} the head of the customer service department, and Kelly Kapoor's (Mindy Kaling) direct supervisor. <b>Kelly</b> <b>is</b> initially irate at the situation, but Ryan agrees to be a more dutiful boyfriend in exchange for Kelly keeping up the charade. Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) desperately aspires to join the inner circle, while Deangelo repeatedly attempts to win over Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson), who is still apathetic toward the new boss. Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey) sees his style as sexist, as every member of the inner circle is male, which Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) agrees to, as Deangelo has repeatedly been acting coldly towards her. To prove to the staff that he's not sexist, Deangelo hires a woman named Jordan Garfield (Cody Horn), who turns out to have no business experience (having previously worked in Anthropologie) over other qualified candidates, including a friend of Pam's. Kelly later attempts to tell Deangelo the truth about Ryan's actual position as a temp worker, but Deangelo simply appoints Ryan as the department head rather than figuring out the truth.|$|E

5|$|The Minnesota {{franchise}} {{began its}} {{life as the}} Washington Senators in Washington, D. C., where they played from their inception in 1901 to 1960. In the early 20th century, the Senators were managed consecutively by three future members of the Baseball Hall of Fame, bookended by Bucky Harris, who managed the team from 1924 to 1928 and again from 1935 to 1942. Walter Johnson, who {{was inducted into the}} Hall of Fame as a player, managed the team for four seasons from 1929 to 1932, and he was followed by Joe Cronin, also inducted as a player, who led for the next two seasons (1933–1934). Clark Griffith is the only other Hall of Famer to manage the Senators/Twins franchise. In 1960, the American League awarded an expansion franchise to Minneapolis, Minnesota; however, owner Calvin Griffith moved his team to Minnesota, and Washington was awarded the expansion team instead. Thus, the Minnesota Twins began play in Minnesota the following year, during the tenure of manager Cookie Lavagetto. Harris and Tom Kelly are the two managers to win a World Series championship with the franchise, one in the Senators era (Harris) and two during the team's tenure in Minnesota (Kelly). <b>Kelly</b> <b>is</b> also the franchise leader in wins and losses, the only manager to exceed 1,000 in each category (1,140–1,244 in 16 seasons). Ron Gardenhire was fired of managerial duties in October 2014, as he was replaced by Paul Molitor.|$|E
5|$|The video {{starts at}} the Clarksons' household. There, {{she and her husband}} are engaged in a heated {{argument}} and he threatens to smash down a picture of the family at one point. Time freezes still and her husband becomes immobile; Clarkson, however, is immune to this. Looking around her house, she sees her younger self. Hand in hand, the younger and older versions of Clarkson relive her troubled childhood as various painful memories are seen, such as the younger Clarkson making a picture for her father who tosses it into the sink while talking on the phone, and Clarkson's mother making an unappreciated dinner for her father as she puts the father's dinner into the bin. These events drive her mother to the point of taking pills before closing the door in the younger Clarkson's face, so that she doesn't see her starting to cry. The breaking point is finally seen when Clarkson's parents have a physical fight and throw objects at each other. Soon after, Clarkson's father packs his bags and leaves despite the younger Clarkson's pleas for him to stay. The older Clarkson runs back in time to the present, and instead of fighting with her husband, they make up. They then see that their daughter in the video had seen them fight, and they embrace her and each other. Throughout the music video, Clarkson is shown singing on the front porch, her mother's bed and a room full of mirrors, reflecting an image of her younger self. Note that <b>Kelly</b> <b>is</b> holding Kennedy's hand in the scene where the childhood memories are revealed.|$|E
