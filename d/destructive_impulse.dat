500|$|Sigmund Freud {{regarded}} conscience as originating psychologically {{from the}} growth of civilisation, which periodically frustrated the external expression of aggression: this <b>destructive</b> <b>impulse</b> being forced to seek an alternative, healthy outlet, directed its energy as a superego against the person's own [...] "ego" [...] or selfishness (often taking its cue in this regard from parents during childhood). According to Freud, the consequence of not obeying our conscience is guilt, {{which can be a}} factor in the development of neurosis; Freud claimed that both the cultural and individual super-ego set up strict ideal demands with regard to the moral aspects of certain decisions, disobedience to which provokes a 'fear of conscience'.|$|E
60|$|The {{next morning}} he was up, bright and early, poring over the {{manuscript}} with the sharpened wits of the new day, peering into its night, into its old, blurred, forgotten dream; and, indeed, he had been dreaming about it, and was fully possessed with the idea that, in his dream, he had taken up the inscrutable document, and read it off as glibly as he would the page of a modern drama, in a continual rapture with the deep truth that it made clear to his comprehension, and the lucid {{way in which it}} evolved the mode in which man might be restored to his originally undying state. So strong was the impression, that when he unfolded the manuscript, it was with almost the belief that the crabbed old handwriting would be plain to him. Such did not prove to be the case, however; so far from it, that poor Septimius in vain turned over the yellow pages in quest of the one sentence which he had been able, or fancied he had been able, to read yesterday. The illumination that had brought it out was now faded, and all was a blur, an inscrutableness, a scrawl of unintelligible characters alike. So much did this affect him, that he had almost a mind to tear it into a thousand fragments, and scatter it out of the window to the west-wind, that was then blowing past the house; and if, in that summer season, there had been a fire on the hearth, it is possible that easy realization of a <b>destructive</b> <b>impulse</b> might have incited him to fling the accursed scrawl into the hottest of the flames, and thus returned it to the Devil, who, he suspected, was the original author of it. Had he done so, what strange and gloomy passages would I have been spared the pain of relating! How different would have been the life of Septimius,--a thoughtful preacher of God's word, taking severe but conscientious views of man's state and relations, a heavy-browed walker and worker on earth, and, finally, a slumberer in an honored grave, with an epitaph bearing testimony to his great usefulness in his generation.|$|E
50|$|Destrudo {{is a term}} {{introduced}} by Italian psychoanalyst Edoardo Weiss in 1935 to denote {{the energy of the}} death instinct, on the analogy of libido—and thus to cover the energy of the <b>destructive</b> <b>impulse</b> in Freudian psychology.|$|E

40|$|Luddite! is a {{term used}} polemically to imply an irrational fear or hatred of technology, a violent and <b>destructive</b> <b>impulse</b> towards the new. Historically however, the Luddites {{can be seen to}} protest the {{conditions}} rather than the means of production. King Ludd led tactics of ‘direct action’ against the enclosure of the commons and the division of labour; divisions that prepared the ground for many separations: arts and crafts, technical and academic. Our imperative in the projects we will describe here was to address and understand how as artists we might work with new 3 D visualisation technologies. To do this we unpicked some historical precedents including an early ancestor of 3 D fabrication technology: a device from 1863 for turning photographs into sculpture. As a collective of students and staff we figured out how to hack and build a bastard apparatus. We produced a monster. In so doing we found that we were generating paradata: exploring the systems of the institution, the building of discipline and the vectors of control. We threw some spanners into the machine. ‘We tried a type of… performance that could influence the thinking of all the people engaged in it. It was, so to speak, art for the producer, not art for the consumer. ’ (Brecht, 1964) It seems apt {{in the light of the}} current ICA show which displays a reconstruction of Richard Hamilton’s ‘Man Machine Motion’, to discuss our own reconstruction of ‘This is Tomorrow’ from 1956, where The Independent Group worked to create a series of expanded artworks. This project is a further example of our methodology in practice: a kind of material historiography with energies aimed very much at the future...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2017 - 09 Contemporary Russian art and {{museology}} {{is experiencing}} a revival {{of interest in the}} pioneering museology of the Russian artistic and political avant-garde of the early 20 th century. This revival is exemplified in the work of contemporary Russian conceptual artist and self-styled ‘avant-garde museologist’ Arseniy Zhilyaev (b. 1984). Influential early 20 th century Russian avant-garde artist and museologist Kazimir Malevich acts as the ‘tether’ binding the museologies of the past and present together, his famous “Black Square” a recurring visual and metaphoric indicator of the inspiration that contemporary Russian avant-garde museology and art is taking from its predecessors. This thesis analyzes Zhilyaev’s artistic and museological philosophy and work and determines how and where they are informed by Bolshevik-era avant-garde museology. This thesis also asks why such inspirations and influences are being felt and harnessed at this particular juncture in post-Soviet culture. The ‘avant-garde’ museological tenets shared by Zhilyaev and his earlier Russian predecessors (most significantly Nikolai Fyodorov, b. 1829, Kazimir Malevich, b. 1878, and Aleksey Fedorov-Davydov, b. 1900) incorporate the three facets that form the subtitle of this thesis - the cosmic (future focus), the nostalgic (for a lost past or an imagined, potential future), and the transformative (social and political through education). Differences include post-Soviet Russian museology’s less cohesive ideological underpinnings. The current generation of post-Soviet artists and museologists, typified by Zhilyaev, on the one hand, desires {{to move away from the}} more traumatic elements of the Soviet period. On the other hand, he misses the ‘superstructure’ of the Soviet era, in terms of its provision of a single, cohesive ideology to both take inspiration from and rebel against. Zhilyaev is a particularly insightful focal point from which to trace earlier Russian and Soviet avant-garde museological influences not only because his work directly references those museologies but also because all of Zhilyaev’s work is centered on one theme: the museum. Most of Zhilyaev’s exhibits presuppose the existence of an imaginary superstructure (which he often adapts directly from Fyodorov’s Cosmism, Malevich’s <b>destructive</b> <b>impulse</b> and contemporary focus, and Fedorov- Davydov’s class-based didactic agenda). Zhilyaev’s larger purpose is to unveil and heighten awareness of the superstructures (ideologies, agendas, and assumptions) that lay behind most of the ‘objects’ and actions in the world. Soviet nostalgia, escapism, political activism, the art of dissent, and institutionalism play key parts in both the timing and content of Zhilyaev’s work...|$|E

A relationship has also been suggested between aggression and high catecholaminergic activity. Several studies have reported signs of aberrant dopaminergic function in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism, and schizophrenia. In 22 violent offenders undergoing pretrial forensic psychiatric investigation, interpersonal and behavioral features of psychopathy, measured by the Psychopathy Checklist Revised (PCL-R), were significantly predicted by low cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of 5 -HIAA and high CSF concentrations of HVA in multivariate regression models. CSF concentrations of MHPG did {{not contribute to the}} model.

50|$|Liberal {{democracy}} traces its origins—and its name—to the European 18th-century, {{also known}} as the Age of Enlightenment. At the time, the vast majority of European states were monarchies, with political power held either by the monarch or the aristocracy. The possibility of democracy had not been a seriously considered political theory since classical antiquity, and the widely held belief was that democracies would be inherently unstable and chaotic in their policies due to the changing whims of the people. It was further believed that democracy was contrary to human nature, as human beings were seen to be inherently evil, violent and in need of a strong leader to restrain their <b>destructive</b> <b>impulses.</b> Many European monarchs held that their power had been ordained by God, and that questioning their right to rule was tantamount to blasphemy.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: António Pedro, {{considered}} {{a pioneer of}} the Portuguese surrealist movement, stands by the assertion of a plastic thinking where word and image converge. In the work of this author, the feminine, in its multiple meanings and relations, emerges as a main theme, taking on a diversity of representations and significances. In this article, {{an analysis of the}} connections between plastic and literary works confirms a series of constant images that converge towards a representation of the feminine as a privileged object of <b>destructive</b> <b>impulses.</b> The study of women-trees present in the pictorial work of António Pedro, when {{considered a}}longside Apenas uma narrativa, enables us to identify, in the feminine metamorphoses that characterize both these compositions, a regressive or degenerative movement. This movement, a metaphor of the author’s action, aims towards immobility or inertia, in other words, towards the definitive passage to an inanimate or dehumanized state...|$|R

40|$|Background in {{cultural}} studies. Black Metal is a musical subgenre of Heavy Metal {{that appeared in}} England back in the 80 ’s. It combines radical political ideologies and left hand path religious beliefs with nihilism, misanthropy and a dark aesthetic. This subculture spread in Norway in the early 90 ’s and got infamous due to violent episodes of murdering and church-arson (Moynihan, 1998). Background in sociology. Young people of western countries are {{growing up in a}} Judeo-Christian influenced culture. One mean of rebellion is to reject the biblical and become adept of everything that is described as evil in it. In this case, they search for a social group based on their insurgent beliefs and consequently adhere to Black Metal which is unanimous in its <b>destructive</b> <b>impulses</b> toward Christianity and its parent religion, Judaism from the Middle East (Prozak, 2002). Aims. This paper aims to clarify the influence of the Internet, especially in the context of anonymous communication in a music focused online community, on the behavior and the socialization of young people member of a very extreme, highly political and religious influenced musical subculture.

Later, after bringing the cyber-tick Minitron, he was formally inducted into the Autobot ranks and began to sport Autobot symbols instead of the Decepticon ones he sported in all of the episodes prior. According to Bumblebee, the only reason Grimlock was imprisoned on the Alchemor was due to severe property damage, which Bumblebee deemed to just be him acting like himself and not being a threat. Some major changes from previous Grimlock incarnations is that along with not having a speech impediment that was shown in series prior, he also has a much more mild manner and a showingly kind personality, though he usually is shown as not the most intellectual character on the team.|$|R
50|$|As the Harvard {{community}} confronts this transition, the New Harvard Library Working Group of Occupy Harvard {{has acted}} autonomously {{to open a}} persistent community space for critical thought, engaged learning, and insistent action in the Lamont Library Café. In doing so, we strive to fulfill the promise of this library space as an open and participatory forum for learning. …We think of the proposed Harvard library transition {{as a manifestation of}} the University's accession to neoliberal imperatives. Occupy, whether at Harvard or Wall Street, challenges and refuses the devastating willingness of our broken society to view humans as expendable resources and systems as ultimately beholden to profit. A future cannot be imagined in the absence of its past, present, or future constituents. A library needs the workers who are its lifeblood, its circulatory system, just as a functioning democratic society needs the voices of the 99 percent. Systems built with profit imperatives can only serve to further perpetuate the patterns of destruction and unequal power structures that we denounce. The proposed library transition not only fails to address these systemic problems, it replicates them.We insist on an alternative vision, one that cherishes the human communities and collaborative processes that make intellectual and civic engagement—on campuses and in public parks—not only possible but also fruitful.

40|$|Research on {{insecure}} adult attachment (i. e., attachment {{anxiety and}} avoidance) indicates that insecurely attached individuals experience less sexual satisfaction. Given the relative rigidity of attachment, {{the current study}} set out to add to existing literature on more therapeutically applicable attachment-related constructs contributing to sexual dissatisfaction. We aimed to determine whether five distinct fears of intimacy partially mediate the relationship between insecure adult attachment and sexual satisfaction, through three hypotheses: (1) Attachment anxiety and avoidance predict fears of intimacy; (2) Fears of intimacy predict diminished sexual satisfaction; (3) Fears of intimacy partially mediate {{the relationship between the}} dimensions of insecure adult attachment and sexual satisfaction. Participants (N = 701) completed an online questionnaire battery containing measures of insecure adult attachment, fears of intimacy and sexual satisfaction. The results of two single multiple mediation models partially supported the hypotheses. More precisely, the results indicate that attachment anxiety and avoidance may {{contribute to the development of}} fear of merger, fear of attack, fear of exposure, fear of abandonment and fear of one’s own <b>destructive</b> <b>impulses.</b> In turn, fearing merger, attack and exposure results in the experience of less sexual satisfaction. However, only fear of merger and fear of exposure were found to mediate the negative relationships between attachment anxiety and avoidance and sexual satisfaction. Fear of abandonment was unexpectedly found to lead to increased sexual satisfaction, suppressing the negative influence of attachment anxiety on sexual satisfaction. The remaining fears of intimacy appeared to not have a mediating effect. These findings are discussed, in addition to important limitations, practical implications and directions for future research...|$|R
