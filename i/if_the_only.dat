40|$|The {{complexity}} classes PP; BPP and RP {{are usually}} defined via probabilistic Turing machines (PTMs) that {{have access to}} a perfect random source. A natural question is this: Do these classes change <b>if</b> <b>the</b> PTMs <b>only</b> {{have access to a}}n arbitrary semi-random source rather than a perfect random source? The notion of semi-randomness are defined by Satha and Vazirani in 1984, and this question was first considered by Vazirani and Vazirani in 1985, who proved that RP does not change even <b>if</b> <b>the</b> PTMs <b>only</b> have access to an arbitrary semi-random source. Later, Vazirani proved that BPP does not change, either. In this paper, we show a surprising result that PP collapses to BPP <b>if</b> <b>the</b> PTMs <b>only</b> have access to an arbitrary semi-random source. We also consider the following question: Do the classes PP; BPP and RP change <b>if</b> <b>the</b> PTMs <b>only</b> have access to a specific semi-random source? As answers to this question, we show that RP changes to NP while both BPP and PP change to PSPACE. P = 8 0 -RP = [...] ...|$|R

25|$|The {{proof of}} the {{independence}} result also shows that a wide class of mathematical statements, including all statements that can be phrased {{in the language of}} Peano arithmetic, are provable in ZF if and only if they are provable in ZFC.

When one attempts to solve problems in this class, it makes no difference whether ZF or ZFC is employed <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> question is the existence of a proof.

The plaintiff could swear to his loss by brigands, the price paid for a slave purchased abroad, or the sum due to him; but great stress was laid on the production of written evidence. It was a serious thing to lose a document. The judges might be satisfied of its existence and terms by the affidavit of the witnesses to it and then issue an order that whenever found, it should be submitted. The clay tablets of contracts that were annulled were broken. The court might even travel to view the property and take with them the sacred symbols with which oaths were made.|$|E

500|$|Barker has two {{independent}} holdings. First, the Court reaffirmed its holding from Botiller v. Dominguez (1889) that even perfect title {{was subject to}} the requirements of the Land Claims Act. Barker rejected in part the reasoning of the California Supreme Court from Byrne, noting: [...] "Surely a claimant would have little reason for presenting to the land commission his claim to land, and securing a confirmation of that claim, <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> result was to transfer the naked fee to him, burdened by an Indian right of permanent occupancy." [...] Thus, Barker has since been cited by the Court as the source of the rule that the Land Claims Act itself extinguished aboriginal title.|$|E

500|$|Mathematically, {{proving that}} zero is even {{is a simple}} matter of {{applying}} a definition, but more explanation is needed in the context of education.

A student {{in the first years of}} primary education may not yet have learned what [...] "integer" [...] or [...] "multiple" [...] means, much less how to multiply with 0. Additionally, stating a definition of parity for all integers can seem like an arbitrary conceptual shortcut <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> even numbers investigated so far have been positive. It can help to acknowledge that as the number concept is extended from positive integers to include zero and negative integers, number properties such as parity are also extended in a nontrivial way.|$|E
500|$|In late 1953, Quinn {{decided to}} run a {{competition}} for short fiction from new writers. The competition was only open to college students who had not sold a story before. The first prize was $1,000, the second prize $500, with five runner-up prizes of $100 each. Entries came in from writers who were later to become well known, including Harlan Ellison, Roger Zelazny, and Andrew J. Offutt, whose story [...] "And Gone Tomorrow", about a man unexpectedly sent a hundred years into the future, won first prize and appeared in the December 1954 issue of <b>If.</b> <b>The</b> <b>only</b> other {{one of the seven}} announced winners who had a career as a science-fiction writer was Leo P.

500|$|Since {{motion is}} continuous, space must be {{infinitely}} divisible. In order for anything to begin moving at all, {{there must be}} some mind-like, voluntaristic property or force inherent in the basic constituents of the universe that propels them. This conatus is a sort of instantaneous or [...] "virtual" [...] motion that all things possess, even when they are static. Motion, meanwhile, is just the summation of all the conatuses that a thing has, along with the interactions of things. The conatus is to motion as a point is to space. The problem with this view is that an object that collides with another {{would not be able to}} bounce back, <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> force in play were the conatus. Hence, Leibniz was forced to postulate the existence of an aether that kept objects moving and allowed for elastic collisions. Leibniz' concept of a mind-like memory-less property of conatus, coupled with his rejection of atoms, eventually led to his theory of monads.|$|E

500|$|Justice Scalia {{also criticized}} the majority's {{conclusion}} that the tip provided reasonable suspicion that Lorenzo and Jose Prado Navarette were driving while drunk, because [...] "the truck might have swerved to avoid an animal, a pothole, or a jaywalking pedestrian .... Or, indeed, he might have intentionally forced the tipster off the road because of some personal animus, or hostility to her 'Make Love, Not War' bumper sticker." [...] Furthermore, Justice Scalia argued that one discrete instance of irregular driving does not give rise to the reasonable suspicion of an ongoing threat of an intoxicated driver on the road. Justice Scalia also argued that the anonymous tip's claims of reckless driving were ultimately discredited {{by the fact that}} officers followed Lorenzo and Jose for five minutes, but observed nothing suspicious. He wrote, [...] "I take it as a fundamental premise of our intoxicated-driving laws that a driver soused enough to swerve once can be expected to swerve again — and soon. If he does not, and <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> evidence of his first episode of irregular driving is a mere inference from an uncorroborated, vague, and nameless tip, then the Fourth Amendment requires that he be left alone." [...] In his concluding remarks, Justice Scalia wrote [...] "runken driving is a serious matter, but so is the loss of our freedom to come and go as we please without police interference .... After today’s opinion all of us on the road, and not just drug dealers, are at risk of having our freedom of movement curtailed on suspicion of drunkenness, based upon a phone tip, true or false, of a single instance of careless driving." ...|$|E
500|$|During the Winter Consumer Electronics Show in January 1994, Sega of America {{research}} and development head Joe Miller took a phone call in his Las Vegas hotel suite from Nakayama, in which Nakayama {{stressed the importance of}} coming up with a quick response to the Jaguar. [...] Included on this call were Bayless, Sega hardware team head Hideki Sato, and Sega of America vice president of technology Marty Franz. [...] One potential idea for this came from a concept from Sega of Japan, later known as [...] "Project Jupiter", an entirely new independent console. [...] Project Jupiter was initially slated to be {{a new version of the}} Genesis, with an upgraded color palette and a lower cost than the upcoming Saturn, as well as with some limited 3D capabilities thanks to integration of ideas from the development of the Sega Virtua Processor chip. [...] Miller suggested an alternative strategy, citing concerns with releasing a new console with no previous design specifications within six to nine months. [...] According to former Sega of America producer Michael Latham, Miller said, [...] "Oh, that's just a horrible idea. [...] If all you're going to do is enhance the system, you should make it an add-on. [...] If it's a new system with legitimate new software, great. [...] But <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> thing it does is double the colors...." [...] Miller, however, insists that the decision was made collectively to talk about alternative solutions. [...] One idea was to leverage the existing Genesis as a way to keep from alienating Sega customers, who would otherwise be required to discard their Genesis systems entirely to play 32-bit games, and to control the cost of the new system. [...] This would come in the form of an add-on. [...] From these discussions, Project Jupiter was discontinued and the new add-on, codenamed [...] "Project Mars", was advanced.|$|E
