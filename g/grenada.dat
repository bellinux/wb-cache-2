5|$|The monarchy of <b>Grenada</b> has {{its roots}} in the French monarchy, under the {{authority}} of which the islands were first colonised in the mid 17th century, and later the English and then British monarchy, as a Crown colony. On 7 February 1974, the country gained independence from the United Kingdom, retaining the then reigning monarch, Elizabeth II, as monarch of the newly created monarchy of <b>Grenada.</b> The monarch is represented in the country by the Governor-General of <b>Grenada,</b> currently Dame Cécile La Grenade.|$|E

5|$|Early in the {{duration}} of the storm, the National Hurricane Center consistently forecast Ivan to track further to the north than it eventually did. Late on September 5, the government of Barbados issued a hurricane watch for its territory. Shortly thereafter, Saint Lucia was put under a hurricane watch and <b>Grenada</b> and its dependencies were put under a tropical storm watch. As the hurricane approached the southern Lesser Antilles, more watches were issued, and by 24hours prior to Ivan passing through the island chain a hurricane warning was in effect for Barbados, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Saint Lucia, Tobago, and <b>Grenada,</b> and a tropical storm warning was in effect for Trinidad. With the path of Ivan more southerly than predicted, the hurricane warnings were downgraded to tropical storm warnings for the northern islands, and by late on September 7 when the eye of the hurricane passed near <b>Grenada,</b> hurricane warnings were in effect for Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Trinidad and Tobago, and <b>Grenada.</b> Subsequently, a tropical storm warning was issued for the northern coast of Venezuela through the Guajira Peninsula of Colombia.|$|E

He lost in the qualifying event, although was selected by the Tripartite Commission to attend the Beijing Olympics to supplement the <b>Grenada</b> Olympic team, which historically had had less than six people and thus qualified for the aid.|$|E
5|$|On July 14, Emily hit <b>Grenada</b> {{which was}} still {{recovering}} from the impact of Hurricane Ivan {{less than a year}} earlier. Emily resulted in one reported fatality and significant damage {{in the northern part of}} the country, including Carriacou which had been spared the worst effects of Ivan. 16houses were destroyed and well over 200 more were damaged, and two of the main hospitals were flooded. Damages in <b>Grenada</b> amounted to $110.4million.|$|E
50|$|Soca, calypso, and reggae set {{the mood}} for <b>Grenada's</b> annual Carnival activities.

5|$|On September 30, a {{tropical}} storm watch was issued for the Windward Islands from St. Vincent and the Grenadines south to Trinidad and Tobago. One hour later, the watch was extended to Saint Lucia. Later that day, the watches were upgraded to warnings in Trinidad and Tobago and <b>Grenada.</b> On October 1, Trinidad's warning was downgraded to a watch. After that, the watches and warnings were gradually discontinued, first in Barbados and St. Vincent and the Grenadines, then Trinidad and Saint Lucia, then Tobago, and finally <b>Grenada.</b> In response to the approaching hurricane, emergency operations centers in <b>Grenada</b> and both main islands of Trinidad and Tobago were placed on alert.|$|E
5|$|Several nearby {{countries}} assisted <b>Grenada</b> in its aftermath. The {{government of}} Guyana shipped about $250,000 (2004USD, $40million 2004GYD) worth of sugar, {{as well as}} 100members of the Guyana Defense Force to assist in restoring order and reconstruction. The government of Trinidad and Tobago sent 190policemen, {{and the government of}} Anguilla sent 1,230cases of water. A committee of Caribbean nations realized the local governments could not provide the support that <b>Grenada</b> needed in its aftermath, and thus turned to international assistance. Within a day of Ivan passing to the south of <b>Grenada,</b> the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) deployed 67,600gallons of water, 500rolls of plastic sheeting, four 10,000liter water bladder kits, and a water treatment kit; assistance from USAID totaled $6million (2004USD) within a few weeks of the storm's passage, primarily in aid for reconstruction and rehabilitation. In the weeks subsequent to the hurricane, the European Commission Humanitarian aid Office (ECHO) provided €3million (2004EUR). By a year later, housing redevelopments and disaster preparation problems continued after being impacted by Hurricane Emily; as a result, the ECHO provided €1.2million (2005EUR) to <b>Grenada</b> in September 2005. Nine months after the hurricane, Chinese officials provided assistance in reconstruction and handling foreign debts after meeting with the Grenadian Prime Minister; in 2007, Chinese officials funded {{the construction of a new}} $40million (2007USD) cricket stadium near St. George's. The Caribbean Development Bank approved a $10million loan (2004USD) requested by the government of <b>Grenada</b> in July 2005, which was intended to assist in long-term development of the housing, business, and environmental sectors. Emergency operations in <b>Grenada</b> in coordination with the Pan American Disaster Response Unit ended in July 2005.|$|E
5|$|The Capture of <b>Grenada</b> was an amphibious {{expedition}} in July 1779 {{during the}} Anglo-French War. Charles Hector, comte D'Estaing led French forces against the British-held West Indies island of <b>Grenada.</b> The French forces landed on July 2nd and the assault {{occurred on the}} night of July 3rd-4th. The French forces assaulted the British fortifications on Hospital Hill, overlooking the island's capital, Saint George's. The British cannons were captured and turned against Fort George. British Governor Lord Macartney opened negotiations to surrender.|$|E

5|$|American {{domestic}} public {{concerns about}} intervening in foreign conflicts persisted {{from the end}} of the Vietnam War. The Reagan administration emphasized the use of quick, low-cost counter-insurgency tactics to intervene in foreign conflicts. In 1983, the Reagan administration intervened in the multisided Lebanese Civil War, invaded <b>Grenada,</b> bombed Libya and backed the Central American Contras, anti-communist paramilitaries seeking to overthrow the Soviet-aligned Sandinista government in Nicaragua. While Reagan's interventions against <b>Grenada</b> and Libya were popular in the United States, his backing of the Contra rebels was mired in controversy. The Reagan administration's backing of the military government of Guatemala during the Guatemalan Civil War, in particular the regime of Efraín Ríos Montt, was also controversial.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{controversy}} surrounding Chinese activities in Tibet, <b>Grenada</b> continued {{to support the}} upholding of the Chinese Olympic Games. As thanks, the People's Republic of China constructed a new cricket stadium on the island, among other activities.|$|E

5|$|In <b>Grenada,</b> the island's {{governor}} {{issued an}} emergency order against the hoarding {{of food in}} the aftermath of Janet, due to the food and water shortage that resulted from Janet. A United States destroyer and a British frigate were sent to bring relief supplies to <b>Grenada,</b> and ships departing from Jamaica and Trinidad were redirected to the island to help send supplies. The British government later announced that it would send £50,000 (US$155,000) in relief to the Grenadines. The Crown Agents and Red Cross delivered relief supplies to Barbados and the Grenadines, which included aluminum roofing sheets and portable electric generators.|$|E
5|$|In western <b>Grenada,</b> high waves {{affected}} {{much of the}} coastline, destroying 21small {{boats and}} causing significant beach erosion. The waves covered the entire Grand Anse Beach in Saint George Parish. The erosion heavily impacted tourist areas and also threatened {{the foundation of the}} runway at the Maurice Bishop International Airport. Storm damage cut off the towns in western <b>Grenada</b> from the capital city of Saint George's. The cut-off roads resulted in an island-wide fuel shortage. In Saint John Parish, the storm knocked out the water and power supply and forced several families to evacuate their damaged houses. The small island Carriacou, located north of <b>Grenada,</b> sustained damage to the road to its primary airport. At least 10homes were destroyed in the country, and damage totaled $94.6million; this represented 27percent of the island's gross domestic product. Effects from the storm reached as far south as Trinidad and Tobago. In the country, storm surge caused damage to boats and coastal structures, while beach erosion was reported in Tobago.|$|E
5|$|On September23 Janet passed {{directly}} between <b>Grenada</b> and Carriacou in the Grenadines, killing 122people in {{the island}} chain. An airport on <b>Grenada</b> was covered in debris strewn by the strong winds. Eight {{people were killed in}} a small town adjacent to the airport. Strong winds were also reported to have destroyed docks and warehouses, and unroofed a hotel in St. George's, <b>Grenada.</b> Houses were also unroofed, and balconies of government offices in St. George's were torn off. All bridges {{in the island}}'s interior regions collapsed, and spice crops sustained heavy damage. An estimated 75% of nutmeg plantations were destroyed, along with nearly all of the island's banana and cocoa crops. Three ships were also grounded in the local harbor. In The Carenage, the waterfront region of St. George's, debris was scattered and an 820ft (250m) pier collapsed. St. Vincent was mostly destroyed, and St. Lucia suffered significant coastal damage. Over $2.8million in damages were estimated throughout the Grenadines. Farther south, in Port of Spain, a church being used as a storm shelter collapsed, killing ten people.|$|E
