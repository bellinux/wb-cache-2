5|$|The name of {{the roller}} coaster comes from the story of Hercules in Greek Mythology. According to the story, Hercules had to perform twelve labours. After {{defeating}} the Nemean lion for the first labour, the second was to defeat the Hydra, a nine-headed creature with eight serpentine heads that would regrow each time they were cut off, including one that was immortal. Dorney Park altered {{the remainder of the}} story- after Hercules managed to defeat the Hydra initially, he buried the immortal head stuck under a stone, with the intention of sealing it for all time. Years later however, the <b>head</b> <b>slowly</b> grew back, resurrecting the Hydra and taking its revenge on Hercules by killing him; hence why the Hydra roller coaster sits where Hercules once did.|$|E
25|$|It is {{possible}} that Elasmosaurus and its kin stalked schools of fish, concealing themselves below and moving the <b>head</b> <b>slowly</b> up as they approached. The eyes of the animal were located {{at the top of}} the head and allowed them to see directly upward. This stereoscopic vision would help it find small prey. Hunting from below would also have helped by silhouetting the prey in the sunlight while concealing Elasmosaurus in the dark waters below. Elasmosaurids probably ate small bony fish and marine invertebrates, as their small, non-kinetic skulls would have limited the prey they could eat. The long, slender teeth were adapted for seizing prey and not tearing, and hence it was swallowed whole. It swallowed small stones to aid its digestion.|$|E

The Romans then routed the Veientes.|$|R

500|$|On March12, a cold-core {{stationary}} upper-level trough became established offshore {{of southern}} Brazil. A disturbance formed within the trough on the 19th, and moved east-southeastward until the 22nd, when a ridge to its southeast kept it stationary.
