50|$|These {{superseded}} wrap-spring single-revolution clutches in page printers, such as teleprinters, {{including the}} Teletype Model 28 and its successors, {{using the same}} design principles. IBM Selectric typewriters also used them. These are typically disc-shaped assemblies mounted on the driven shaft. Inside the hollow disc-shaped <b>drive</b> <b>drum</b> are two or three freely floating pawls arranged {{so that when the}} clutch is tripped, the pawls spring outward much like the shoes in a drum brake. When engaged, the load torque on each pawl transfers to the others to keep them engaged. These clutches do not slip once locked up, and they engage very quickly, on the order of milliseconds. A trip projection extends out from the assembly. If the trip lever engaged this projection, the clutch was disengaged. When the trip lever releases this projection, internal springs and friction engage the clutch. The clutch then rotates one or more turns, stopping when the trip lever again engages the trip projection.|$|E

40|$|LKAB has a {{large number}} of belt {{conveyors}} which function is to transport material in the refining process of iron ore. The drive of the belt conveyors is in general operated by an electric motor, which trough a gearbox makes a <b>drive</b> <b>drum</b> to rotate. The gearbox can be found in several brands, available in various size and designs. The numbers of variants have increased over time and LKAB wants to reverse this trend. The costs of inventories have been increasing and the production can be negatively affekted if right gear box cant be found at the storehouse, or if the mechanist who is working with the gearbox is unfamiliar to the specific type of gearbox. Therefore it can be worrying with too many different types of drives in case of breakdown. This work {{can be seen as a}} preparatory work for a standardization, in which three different producers are compared to find the best choice of drive of the belt conveyors. To get an idea of the situation at LKAB the author began the process of making an inventory of existing belt conveyors. A data store and a business system at LKAB's internal network were used in the work. The inventory revealed that three manufacturers were represented at considerable extent, therefore it was decided that these three were to be further analyzed. The manufacturers are Benzlers, Kumera and Rulmeca. Benzlers and Kumera have broad exchange programs from small handy gears to large heavy industrial gears. But most common at LKAB is Benzlers J-series also known as SALAgear, and Kumera RFM series. The main difference is that the SALA-gear is driven by belt drive and in a Kumera gearbox the engine is directly connected to the gearbox. Rulmeca has a different build-up, the entire drive package is included in the so called drive pulley, these are called motorized pulleys. To compare the three selected manufacturers each gearbox or motorized pulley was analyzed. The manufacturers were also reviewed to see what distinguishes them and how they relate in comparison with each other. Since power consumption is important measurements of power consumption during operation were made both in Svappavaara and in Kiruna. These measurements then was compared with the mass of iron ore that passed the conveyor, this to obtain a fair picture of energy consumption. The result indicated that Rulmeca, who markets itself as energy efficient actually was the cheapest alternative in energy. Economic comparisons were performed to get an idea of how the three brands relate to each other in cost terms. Investment costs and the total costs incurred during the gears lifetime was made, with help of LCC (Life Cycle Cost). Finally, to find the best drive alternative for a belt conveyor a Pugh matrix was established. Important criteria for a supplier of drive units were treated in the Pugh matrix. The criterias were reviewed to determine their importance in relation to each other (weight value). Then, all three manufacturers got their own scores for each criterion and final scores could then be determinedValiderat; 20110105 (anonymous...|$|E

50|$|In its {{simplest}} form {{an engine}} {{is connected to}} a rotating drum {{by means of an}} output shaft. A friction band is wrapped around half the drum's circumference and each end attached to a separate spring balance. A substantial pre-load is then applied {{to the ends of the}} band, so that each spring balance has an initial and identical reading. When the engine is running, the frictional force between the drum and the band will increase the force reading on one balance and decrease it on the other. The difference between the two readings multiplied by the radius of the <b>driven</b> <b>drum</b> is equal to the torque.
