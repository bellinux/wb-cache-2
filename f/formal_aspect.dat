This definition falls short of capturing the <b>formal</b> <b>aspect</b> of much aboriginal tradition. Even 19th century folklorists collecting and attempting to translate aboriginal oral literature recognized the immense challenge of bridging the culture gap.

5000|$|A special form of ascesis {{is carried}} out through art.Deeply {{interested}} in the mystical, theological and artistic tradition of the Orthodox Church, Tommaso Palamidessi brings back to light the technique for preparing and painting a sacred icon. The work he dedicates to this subject, L'Icona, I colori e l'Ascesi Artistica (tr.: Icon, Colours and Artistic Ascesis) (published posthumously in 1986) is a real handbook which aims at starting the reader off on the personal preparation of a sacred icon and on meditating on it. By following {{the rules of the}} chromatic symbolism as well as the traditional geometry of sacred art, the artist can make of his own icon a [...] "castle of meditation", by which he transcends the <b>formal</b> <b>aspect</b> of the image and becomes sensitive to the divine archetypes hidden behind it. In this sense the icon has a sanctifying effect on the conscience of the artist.|$|E
50|$|According to Dan Wingren, {{a fellow}} Texan artist writing on Culwell’s {{work in the}} 1970s, Culwell uses these symbols to suggest formal and spatial relationships:The {{principal}} elements of Culwell’s pictorial vocabulary are virtually constant, and {{were present in the}} wartime paintings. It is an iconography of power-centers and relationships. Natural energies are suggested by stars, rivers, and flamelike shapes. These are often contrasted with less animated blocks and masses. Organic energies are suggested by cellular forms, biomorphic shapes, and close approximations to heads, hands, roots, and leaves. These elements are subordinate, however, to the <b>formal</b> <b>aspect</b> of his art. He knew about Clive Bell’s theory of “significant form” as early as 1937, and has consistently used his formal means to create what he calls “modern space.” He eschews the tricks of linear perspective or opaque overlap to create the impression of space. Rather, his image is primarily a surface, often dense and heavily encrusted with paint, so much so that it might give off the aura of danger (do not touch!), and this surface, overwhelmingly singular, a distinct entity in the surrounding universe, becomes its own universe. One can look into it and find his iconographical elements heaving and dividing in their own gravitational relationships. The impression of space generated this way can be exceedingly strong.|$|E

50|$|In 1921 Arthur Szyk and {{his family}} moved to Paris where they stayed until 1933. The {{relocation}} to Paris is marked by a breakthrough in the <b>formal</b> <b>aspect</b> of Szyk's works. While Szyk's prior book illustrations were drawings in pen and ink (Szyk had illustrated six books before 1925, including three published in the Yiddish language), the illustrations for the books published in Paris were full colour and full of detail. The first book illustrated in this way was the Book of Esther (Le livre d'Esther, 1925), followed by Gustave Flaubert's dialogue The Temptation of Saint Anthony (La tentation de Saint Antoine, 1926), Pierre Benoît's novel Jacob's Well (Le puits de Jacob, 1927) and other books. Those illustrations, which are characterized by a rich diversity of colours and detailed presentation, deliberately referred to the medieval and renaissance traditions of illumination of manuscripts, often with interspersed contemporary elements. Szyk drew himself as one of the characters in the Book of Esther.. The only stylistic exception is illustrations to the two volume collection of humorous anecdotes about Jews Le juif qui rit (1926/27), in which the artist returned to simple black and white graphics. (Paradoxically, the book, one of the best known of his works, met with criticism as repeating antisemitic stereotypes.) The artist's reputation was also enhanced by exhibitions which were organized by Galeries Auguste Decour (the art gallery first exhibited Szyk's works in 1922). Szyk's drawings were purchased by the Minister of Education and Fine Arts Anatole de Monzie and the New York businessman Harry Glemby.|$|E
5000|$|Until modern {{statutory}} {{reforms in}} contract law, a seal was widely recognised by courts in common law jurisdictions as removing {{the need for}} consideration (value) in a contract. This reflects classical contract theory, in which consideration {{was viewed as a}} <b>formal</b> <b>aspect</b> of a contract, so that a seal could be considered an alternative form. A seal was not per se a type of consideration, but rather raised a presumption of consideration (courts have varied in their opinions of whether this presumption was rebuttable). See, e.g., Marine Contractors Co. Inc. v. Hurley, 365 Mass. 280, 285-86 (1974). [...] The rationale for this special treatment of sealed contracts can be understood in terms of the legal formalities that are associated with sealing a document with a wax seal. Firstly, the following of the legal formality of affixing a seal to a document was evidence of the existence of a contract. Secondly, the need to use a seal - widely known to have legal significance - served to impress upon the parties the significance of the agreement being made. This element of deliberation is important in the context of many legal theories for why donative promises are not generally enforceable {{in the same way as}} contracts: there is a concern that donative promises are sometimes made under pressure (for example, from family members) without adequate deliberation, which explains why a requirement for the legal formality of the seal might substitute for consideration to give enforceability to donative promises. Thirdly, the following of the legal formalities through the use of a seal demonstrated beyond doubt that a legal transaction was intended by the parties. In addition to these three abstract reasons, there may also have been a more practical reason, namely that the object used to imprint the wax, usually an engraved signet ring, identified its owner, thereby providing evidence that the owner of the seal was party to the contract. Besides substituting for consideration, other consequences of the seal that, at least historically, have held include: ...|$|E

The building tries to depict the essence, in its <b>formal</b> <b>aspect,</b> of the beautiful mansions that belonged to wealthy people or local gentry.Inside, you may contemplate: 1. A general store full of groceries, which was a type of shop that stocked a bit of everything and where customers were friends. 2 [...]A Barber's shop that faithfully recreates the aspect of these local grooming establishments and that was donated by Mr Arturo Villaverde. 3. The tailor shop that once belonged to Mr Antonio Vazquez and that this Museum is proud to display. 4. In the hall, {{there is a small}} provisional exhibition dedicated to communications, (but this exhibition will soon be moved to another area.) 5. On {{the first floor of the}} Mansion, the stairway corridor is dedicated to hunting and fishing, 6. Mr. Tomás Fernandez Linara's dentist surgery, 7. The Grandas de Salime clinic was a sign of the economic improvement of some villages and of the improved quality of life of their inhabitants, 8. The room dedicated to lighting displays the evolution of lighting systems from heather torches to light bulbs, 9. The bee-keeping gallery, an important activity in Western Asturias 10. A country school, often with a single classroom, where many of our neighbours learned their basic skills. 11. The weights and measurement hall where objects connected with weighing and measuring are on display. 12. The clog hall or the exhibition dedicated to wooden footwear, of which the Museum has a large collection. 13. A new area will open to public on the ground floor of La Casona in 2010: the kitchen. These kitchens, typical in wealthy homes, will lead to the end of hearth-based kitchens - like the one in the Rectory - and to the use of [...] "economical cookers" [...] that burned coal and logs. These cookers, which were very common in the larger cities of Asturias and in the mining areas, eventually extended to western Asturias. 14. Furthermore, there are plans to add a new area in 2011: the back room, which will complement and provide new contents to the grocery or general store.|$|E
