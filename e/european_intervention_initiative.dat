The AVANCE program was one of nine non-school <b>intervention</b> <b>initiatives</b> that Dr. Neuman examined. She found high performance levels for children {{who had participated in}} the program. 100% of children scored excellent or satisfactory on the Dallas school district's kindergarten test of pre-reading skills. Dr. Neuman concluded that AVANCE and the other programs demonstrated [...] "impressive results".|$|R

40|$|Minority {{students}} are overrepresented {{in special education}} in many urban school districts across the United States. The {{purpose of this study}} was to analyze the results of the implementation of policies and training related to the use of a problem solving general education intervention model in an urban school system. Disproportionate representation is problematic if the programming is stigmatizing or ineffective, or if the process of identification is not applied equally to different groups of students (NRC, 1982). The Metropolitan School District of Pike Township administrators elected to begin a general education <b>intervention</b> <b>initiative</b> to address overrepresentation of minority students in special education within the school district. The initiative included all nine of the elementary schools in the district. It included training teams in each school in the use of a problem solving process as a key component to the general education intervention team. The results of this study will be used to make further recommendations regarding the school district's general education <b>intervention</b> <b>initiative.</b> Department of Special EducationThesis (D.

40|$|In most African countries, forest-based {{climate change}} <b>intervention</b> <b>initiatives</b> {{such as the}} nationally {{appropriate}} mitigation actions (NAMAs) and national adaptation programme of actions (NAPAs) are widely accepted. This is mainly {{due to the fact}} that they are relevant in addressing multiple challenges associated with rural development, mitigation and adaptation to climate change, and sustainable forest management. However, there are concerns about the implications of strategic and practical steps taken in this context on forest-dependent communities. Thus, there is need to reconcile local socio-economic vulnerabilities and forestbased climate change <b>intervention</b> <b>initiatives.</b> In the current study, socio-economic factors influencing households’ dependence on forest resources and associated implications on climate change interventions were investigated. Proportionate stratified random sampling was used to select 366 households from forest-based rural communities in Vhembe District of South Africa. A structured questionnaire was administered to household heads in 21 villages. The Pearson Chi-square test was used to analyse the factors that influence household dependence on forest. The effects of household socioeconomic characteristics on households’ forest dependence influencing factor were determined using the binary logit model. Up to 97 % of the respondents depended on the forest resources predominantly because of low costs associated with using them. It was observed that socio-economic characteristics of households such as farm husbandry skills, years of residence (53 - 65) in the community and age of respondents (≤ 38 - 65) significantly (P < 0. 05) influenced use of the forest resources. Thus, effectiveness and sustainability of forest-based climate change <b>intervention</b> <b>initiatives</b> can be promoted if the socio-economic conditions prevailing within households in areas next to forests are improved.

One was the Armenian Revolutionary Federation (in Armenian Dashnaktsuthium, or [...] "The Federation"), a revolutionary movement founded in Tiflis (Russian Transcaucasia) in 1890 by Christapor Mikaelian. Many members {{had been part}} of Narodnaya Volya or the Hunchakian Revolutionary Party. The group published newsletters, smuggled arms, and hijacked buildings as it sought to bring in <b>European</b> <b>intervention</b> that would force the Ottoman Empire to surrender control of its Armenian territories. On August 24, 1896, 17-year-old Babken Suni led twenty-six members in capturing the Imperial Ottoman Bank in Constantinople.
