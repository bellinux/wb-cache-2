5|$|The size of {{a market}} assumes primary {{importance}} {{in the study of}} what induces investment in a country. Ragnar Nurkse referenced the work of Allyn A.

The original idea behind this was put forward by Adam Smith, who stated that division of labour (as against <b>inducement</b> to invest) is limited by the extent of the market.|$|E

5|$|Bribery. Doing {{any one of}} {{a number}} of acts to induce a person to vote or refrain from voting or to reward him for having done so, such as giving or lending money; and giving or {{procuring}} an office or employment, amounts to bribery. It is also bribery for a person to procure or promise to procure that a voter exercise his vote in a certain way or that a candidate be elected as President in return for some inducement; to give money to someone else, knowing that he will use the money for bribery at an election; to accept an <b>inducement</b> for voting or not voting or agreeing to do so; and to induce a person to consent to being nominated as a candidate, or refrain or withdraw from being a candidate in return for some <b>inducement.</b> The penalty is a fine of up to $5,000 or imprisonment not exceeding three years or both; and disqualification from being registered as a voter, voting at any election, or being elected to Parliament or the office of President for seven years.|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} explores how {{states can}} use positive <b>inducements</b> and negative sanctions to successfully bargain with nuclear proliferators {{and prevent the}} spread of nuclear weapons. It seeks to answer the following question: How effective are offers of <b>inducements</b> and threats of sanctions - i. e., 'sticks' and 'carrots' - in efforts to prevent or to roll back the proliferation of nuclear weapons? I pay particular attention to the use of positive <b>inducements,</b> asking: How effective and efficient is the use of <b>inducements</b> relative to negative sanctions? Under what circumstances is each most likely to be useful? I propose an issue-linkage theory with which the use of negative sanctions and positive <b>inducements</b> might be understood. In the theory, negative sanctions and positive <b>inducements</b> are conceptualized as bargaining proposals that link punishments or rewards to particular demands made to the target state. Negative sanctions and positive <b>inducements</b> are effective when they enhance the power and interests of domestic political factions in the target state that support compliance with the sender's nuclear demands. I argue that positive <b>inducements</b> are typically a more effective tool of foreign policy than negative sanctions. Also, the difference in the effectiveness between the two is more pronounced when dealing with adversaries than it is with allies. With allies, both sanctions and <b>inducements</b> can be effective, but <b>inducements</b> are more likely to secure long-term cooperation. With adversaries, negative sanctions are not only much less effective than <b>inducements,</b> but run the risk of triggering escalation. The theory is tested against three counter-proliferation cases: North Korea, South Korea, and Libya. I find that negative sanctions were successful only in the South Korean case, while threats and sanctions triggered escalation in both cases involving US adversaries. On the other hand, positive <b>inducements</b> were used successfully in all three cases. A detailed reading of the three cases lends support to the theory, and suggests that a broader test is warranted. by Robert J. Reardon. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|Published Online: 13 Dec 2016 This article {{sheds light}} on the new legal {{treatment}} of <b>inducements,</b> under the revised Markets in Financial Instruments Directive, and seeks {{to address the question}} whether or not that regime is beneficial for market participants. <b>Inducements</b> constitute a common practice of day-to-day conduct of business by financial institutions. Accordingly, the rules that define their realm of operation are quintessential for both investment firms and investors. The relevant paradigm of conflicts of interest is used. MiFID II has to be implemented only by 3 January 2018. However, the forthcoming regime on <b>inducements</b> derives from gold-plating practices that are already in place in the UK. An examination and assessment of the impact of <b>inducements</b> policy and their adverse effect on retail investors in the UK is an adequate apparatus to draw parallels from. After highlighting the inherent problems of the EU provisions on <b>inducements,</b> an enhanced framework is designed...|$|R

The various economic agents are temporarily unemployed and once the <b>inducement</b> to invest starts operating, the slump will be overcome. However, for an underdeveloped economy, where such resources are absent, this principle doesn't fit.|$|E

40|$|Research on {{psychological}} contracts is increasingly {{focusing on the}} mutual relationship between employee and employer. In an organization several agents act as employers towards their employees and the present study directs the attention to the supervisor’s role in the psychological contract. This study examines the relation between supervisor communication, as reported by both supervisor and employees, and employees’ rating of employer <b>inducements.</b> In addition the study tests the effect of employer <b>inducements</b> on team performance. Data were collected from 42 supervisors and 151 employees from a Norwegian hospital. The study found strong support for supervisor communication, as perceived by employees, predicting the employees’ rating of employer <b>inducements.</b> There was however no support for supervisor communication as perceived by the supervisor. The effect of employer <b>inducements</b> on team performance was also partially supported. The findings indicate that supervisor communication is an antecedent to psychological contracts, although the results are unclear about how sensitive the supervisor is to individual exchange relationships with employees. Implications and suggestions for future research are discussed...|$|R

With the added <b>inducement</b> of a bottle of sherry, Kilbride readily agreed to get into the Ford Anglia car that Hindley had hired. Brady told Kilbride that the sherry was at their home, and they would have to make a detour to collect it. On the way he suggested that they take another detour, to search for a glove he said that Hindley had lost on the moor. When they reached the moor Brady took the child with him while Hindley waited in the car. Brady sexually assaulted Kilbride and attempted to slit his throat with a six-inch serrated blade before fatally strangling him with a piece of string, possibly a shoelace.|$|E

5|$|From 1969 until 2007, the Nassif Building {{served as}} the {{headquarters}} of the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT). The building was designed to have removable interior walls to permit easy reconfiguration of the interior space. In November 1970, the federal government exercised its powers of eminent domain and seized control of the three-story basement parking garage from Nasif in order to provide inexpensive parking for DOT workers. Over the years, so many government workers complained of ailments while working in the structure that some believed it suffered from sick building syndrome. David Nassif Associates, owner of the building, disputed these claims. However, when the Department of Transportation announced it would leave the building in 2000, the owners promised a $100 million renovation that included a new air ventilation and cleaning system as an <b>inducement</b> for the agency to stay. The owners also unsuccessfully sued the General Services Administration in 1999 to force it to renew the federal lease on the building. The Department of Transportation completed their move out of the Nassif Building and into their new headquarters in June 2007.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this paper was to examine the role of {{optimism}} and pessimism as individual characteristics in anticipatory psychological contract formation. Participants were 181 final year university students (psychology and medicine) from Macedonia and Serbia without formal work expirience. Two questionnaires were administered during their regular classes to assess APC and optimism-pessimism. Hierarchical linear regression was used for data analysis. Results demonstrated that participants’ country as a control variable significantly predicted beliefs about relational employee contributions and beliefs about relational and transactional employer <b>inducements.</b> Optimism significantly predicted beliefs about relational employer <b>inducements.</b> Pessimism was significant predictor of beliefs about relational employee contributions and beliefs about relational employer <b>inducements</b> as elements in anticipatory psychological contract (ACP) content. Future studies should be extended among students from different study groups and take into consideration other individual characteristics...|$|R

5|$|Rodrigues {{is taken}} to Nagasaki, where he is imprisoned with many Japanese converts. At a tribunal, he is told Catholic {{doctrine}} is anathema to Japan. Rodrigues demands to see governor Inoue Masashige, who he learns, to his dismay, is the old man seated before him {{in charge of the}} proceedings. Rodrigues is returned to prison, and Kichijiro soon arrives to be imprisoned as well. He explains to Rodrigues that court officials threatened him in order that he betray Rodrigues. Kichijiro then says he is a Christian and asks to be absolved of his betrayal through a confession, which Rodrigues reluctantly grants him. He later is released after being told to step on a fumi-e (a crudely carved crucifix), an act symbolizing rejection of the faith. Later, Rodrigues is brought under guard to the shoreline to await someone. In the far distance, he witnesses an emaciated Garupe and three other prisoners approaching on the shoreline under separate guard. Still in the distance, the three other prisoners are taken offshore on a small boat and are about to be drowned from the boat one-by-one as an <b>inducement</b> to get Garupe to renounce his faith. Rodrigues is restrained by guards on shore as he watches Garupe refuse to apostatize. He then sees the desperate Garupe drowned next to the other three prisoners when he attempts to swim offshore trying to rescue the last prisoner from being drowned.|$|E

The mens rea elements differ in whether they require a quid pro quo; a mere nexus is an easier element to prove; more difficult elements to prove include the intent to be influenced and <b>inducement.</b> The offenses also differ in whether the act to be procured from the public official must be an official, a violation of an official duty, a fraud on the United States, or an official transaction. The offenses also differ in whether the payor may be prosecuted in addition to the public official. Finally, the offenses differ in whether they are predicates for Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act and money laundering prosecutions, and in the maximum authorized prison sentence that may be imposed upon conviction.|$|E

40|$|In {{addition}} to the organized utilization of agricultural machinery and facilities, work with their utilization is considered to include two cases: a) the work is owned by individual managements and b) the other is conducted in commission to other individual managements or agricultural machinery banks. Evaluated cost of these alternative opportunities (estimated value of <b>inducements</b> in alternative opportunities) is called as alternative <b>inducements,</b> the former case being defined as alternative inducement- 1 and the latter as alternative inducement- 2. Factors for organization in association with providing paddy fields (contributions) of the member farm households to the organization include the rent (<b>inducements)</b> received from the organization and that of lending owner cultivators to the individual cultivation of paddy or to individuals other than the organization. Estimated values of contributions in these alternative opportunities are called as alternative contributions. In order to continue the group cooperation of member farm households, their returns (<b>inducements)</b> obtained from the group in recompense for their work in association with group activities are needed to succeed estimated values of contributions obtainable by providing the same labor to other utilization opportunities, I. e., alternative contributions. When the alternative contributions are greater, the member farm householders will be dissatisfied with the <b>inducements</b> given by the organization. In the inspected cases, the actual condition of ”inducements > alternative contributions” or ”contributions < alternative inducements” is found in each case, and thus these organizations are maintained {{by the fact that}} the member farm households obtain benefits from the organization...|$|R

Experiment 1 revealed a rapid processing penalty when <b>inducements</b> (promises) and advice (tips) were anaphorically referenced using a mismatching speech act. In Experiment 2 a delayed penalty was observed when a speech act (promise or threat) was referenced by a mismatching speech act from the same category of <b>inducements.</b> This suggests that speech acts from the same category are harder to discriminate than those from different categories.

Three survey waves were administered a year apart, starting with the recruits' job offer acceptance. Analyses revealed that employee fulfillment and perceived contributions predicted particular changes in employer psychological contract obligations, whereas employer fulfillment and perceived <b>inducements</b> predicted changes in employee obligations. The effects of <b>inducements</b> on employee obligation changes and contributions on employer obligation changes were mediated by their respective fulfillment measures. Changes in obligations were greater {{in the first year}} of employment than in the second.
