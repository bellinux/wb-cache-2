25|$|In {{the spring}} of 1999, Chrétien {{supported}} Canada's involvement in NATO's bombing campaign of Yugoslavia {{over the issue of}} Kosovo, even through the operation was unsanctioned by the UN Security Council thanks to a Russian veto of an Anglo-American resolution asking for the Security Council's approval of the NATO bombing. The idea of bombing Yugoslavia caused some discomfort within the ranks of the Liberal party as the NATO campaign effectively meant supporting Kosovo separatists against a government determined to prevent Kosovo's secession from Yugoslavia. Chrétien was personally uncomfortable with the idea of bombing Yugoslavia, but supported the war because he valued good relations with the United States far more than he cared about Yugoslavia. Chrétien's foreign minister at the time, Lloyd Axworthy justified Canada's involvement in NATO bombing of Yugoslavia under the grounds that allegations of massacres against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo made the use of force legitimate on humanitarian grounds, even without the approval of the UN Security Council. Likewise, Chrétien was later to tell Lawrence Martin that it was <b>far</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> intervene {{in the internal affairs of}} Yugoslavia to stop human rights violations in the Kosovo region by Serbian forces than to do nothing.|$|E

500|$|From 1991 to 1994, {{alongside}} The Simpsons, Smith {{was one of}} {{the lead}} cast members in the sitcom Herman's Head as Louise. Her other television roles include recurring appearances as Marlene on Dharma & Greg, and Penny in two episodes of Dead Like Me. Smith has also appeared in Phil of the Future and Teen Angel. Her one-scene role as pregnant checkout girl Nancy in 1991's City Slickers earned her [...] "more attention than all [...] previous roles combined", and taught her [...] "that it's <b>far</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> have small parts in big movies that everyone sees." [...] In 1997, she appeared as Lulu the palm reader in the independent film Just Write. Her other roles include parts in Barry Levinson's Toys and James L. Brooks' As Good as It Gets. Brooks, who is also executive producer of The Simpsons, had cast Smith in his 1994 film I'll Do Anything (in one of the film's musical numbers), but her part was cut. Aside from The Simpsons, Smith has recorded few voice-over parts, only commercials and the film We're Back! A Dinosaur's Story. She [...] "had a voice-over agent for about two years, and I used to go out [...] all the time, but it never really came to anything. Everybody said, 'Oh Yeardley, you'll clean up,' and that was definitely not the case." ...|$|E
500|$|Writing for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine {{remarked that}} Neighborhoods is [...] "a {{different}} beast {{than any of}} the cheerfully snotty early Blink-182 albums, as the band picks up the gloomy thread left hanging on its eponymous 2003 album ... yet it's <b>far</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> hear Blink-182 grapple with adolescent angst via the perspective of middle age than vainly attempting to re-create their youth. Perhaps Blink could stand to sharpen their words but it's better that they concentrated on their music, creating a fairly ridiculous yet mildly compelling prog-punk spin on the suburbs here." [...] Tom Goodwyn of NME remarked that it finds the band [...] "completely at ease with its past and confident enough to acknowledge their early work, with nods on the album to moments from their whole back catalogue." [...] British rock magazine Kerrang awarded Neighborhoods a [...] "good" [...] three out of five score in their review. Critic Mark Sutherland noted that while [...] "the finished product is inevitably disjointed, Blink emerge as a surprisingly serious rock proposition." [...] He went on to add that, [...] "While it occasionally sounds like Mark, Tom, and Travis are playing three different songs at once ('Kaleidoscope', 'After Midnight'), the band are still capable of producing genuine moments of magnificence." [...] Scott Heisel of Alternative Press attributed the album's flaws to the lack of an outside producer and the fact that only a few tracks were written and recorded as a group: [...] "Blink-182's members are still capable of writing good songs, but without a strong outside influence (i.e., a producer) and no real desire or effort to consistently work {{in the same room with}} one another, the amount of truly transcendent, classic material is minimal. Ultimately, Neighborhoods is a slightly awkward entry in the band's catalog that shows as much potential as it does flaws." ...|$|E

2500|$|Also, one of {{the biggest}} criticisms of price centric Value Investing is that an {{emphasis}} on low prices (and recently depressed prices) regularly misleads retail investors; because fundamentally low (and recently depressed) prices often represent a fundamentally sound difference (or change) in a company's relative financial health. To that end, Warren Buffett has regularly emphasized that [...] "it's <b>far</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> buy a wonderful company at a fair price, than to buy a fair company at a wonderful price." ...|$|E

The Dining room is {{on the one side}} of the little entrance hall, my sitting room, on the other & my bedroom [...] – beyond. In it stands the old bed & wardrobe in our former little bedroom at Alt na Guithasach. Upstairs the rooms are equally comfortable.

2500|$|The movement's name {{is derived}} from the {{combination}} of the emotional intensity and self-denial of the German Expressionists with the anti-figurative aesthetic of the European abstract schools such as Futurism, the Bauhaus, and Synthetic Cubism. Additionally, it has an image of being rebellious, anarchic, highly idiosyncratic and, some feel, nihilistic. In practice, the term is applied to any number of artists working (mostly) in New York who had quite different styles, and even to work that is neither especially abstract nor expressionist. California Abstract Expressionist Jay Meuser, who typically painted in the non-objective style, wrote about his painting Mare Nostrum, [...] "It is <b>far</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> capture the glorious spirit of the sea than to paint all of its tiny ripples." [...] Pollock's energetic [...] "action paintings", with their [...] "busy" [...] feel, are different, both technically and aesthetically, from the violent and grotesque Women series of Willem de Kooning's figurative paintings and the rectangles of color in Mark Rothko's Color Field paintings (which are not what would usually be called expressionist, and which Rothko denied were abstract). Yet all four artists are classified as abstract expressionists.|$|E
2500|$|Sandé {{said she}} wanted her music {{to be remembered as}} that of Nina Simone, one of her {{favourite}} artists. She {{went on to say that}} Nina Simone achieved this for herself and writing her own songs is the best way possible. She also said [...] "These days nothing lasts, music is like fast food, you're in then you're out. She said, as much as she would like, she would never play the piano as well as Simone, but she would give it her best shot. She loves the songs Simone produced, including [...] "I Wish I Knew How It Would Feel to Be Free" [...] and Simone's version of [...] "I Think It's Going to Rain Today". She said that Simone's original songs are very poetic and she said [...] "So when I listen to commercial stuff at the moment, I'm just thinking 'haven't you heard Nina Simone, haven't you heard how a song should be written?" [...] She went on to say [...] "We choose and consume, feast and forget, then rush on to the next hot thing. There's no point chasing that kind of success because it's so transient. <b>Far</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> follow (our) own paths and be true to (ourselves)." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sackville-West worked tirelessly {{to lift up}} Woolf's self-esteem, {{encouraging}} her not to view {{herself as}} a quasi-reclusive inclined to sickness who should hide herself away from the world, but rather offered praise for her liveliness and sense of wit, her health, her intelligence and achievements as a writer. Sackville-West led Woolf to reappraise herself, developing a more positive self-image, and the feeling that her writings were the products of her strengths rather than her weakness. Starting {{at the age of}} 15, Woolf had believed the diagnosis by her father and his doctor that reading and writing were deleterious to her nervous condition, requiring [...] a regime of physical labour such as gardening to prevent a total nervous collapse. This led Woolf to spend much time obsessively engaging in such physical labour. Sackville-West was the first to argue to Woolf she had been misdiagnosed, and that it was <b>far</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> engage in reading and writing to calm her nerves—advice that was taken. Under the influence of Sackville-West, Woolf learned to deal with her nervous aliments by switching between various forms of intellectual activities such as reading, writing and book reviews, instead of spending her time in physical activities that sapped her strength and worsened her nerves. Sackville-West chose the financially struggling Hogarth Press as her publisher in order to assist the Woolfs financially. Seducers in Ecuador, the first of the novels by Sackville-West published by Hogarth, was not a success, selling only 1500 copies in its first year, but the next Sackville-West novel they published, The Edwardians, was a bestseller that sold 30,000 copies in its first six months. Sackville-West's novels, though not typical of the Hogarth Press, saved Hogarth, taking them from the red into the black. However, Woolf was not always appreciative {{of the fact that it}} was Sackville-West's books that kept the Hogarth Press profitable, writing dismissively in 1933 of her [...] "servant girl" [...] novels. The financial security allowed by the good sales of Sackville-West's novels in turn allowed Woolf to engage in more experimental work, such as The Waves, as Woolf had to be cautious when she depended upon Hogarth entirely for her income.|$|E
