40|$|Retailers {{strive to}} {{differentiate}} themselves from competitors to avoid commoditization and consequent price competition, using {{tools such as}} store location, store layout, and product assortment. However, such tools become ineffective on the Internet, where competitors are a few clicks away, where web page design can be easily imitated, and where online shoppers can browse a variety of product categories at ease, making price comparisons using search engines. Thus, an integrated online shopping environment such as that provided by an <b>Internet</b> <b>mall</b> {{would seem to be}} particularly unattractive to retailers. Yet, Internet malls have emerged as an important electronic shopping environment that, according to a recent Forrester Research report, may evolve into a dominant force in Internet marketing. The purpose of this essay is to provide an explanation for this puzzle. We show that an <b>Internet</b> <b>mall</b> reduces price competition among online stores by leveraging two notable features: the search engine and the featured store. The search engine facilitates price comparisons but requires consumers to spend time going through pages of search results. In contrast, consumers are directed to th...|$|E

We chose a 3 D avatar model to present a fashion product in this study. The model walked for about one minute on stage; subsequently, respondents com-pleted a questionnaire after they viewed it. The questionnaire consists of telepresence, pleasure and approach behavior. Respondents are limited to females 20 s and 30 s years old who have purchased fashion products in an <b>Internet</b> <b>mall</b> and are highly interested in fashion products. A total of 226 samples {{were used for the}} final analysis. Cronbach's alpha, cor-relation analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, and structural equation modeling were utilized in this study. The results are as follows. First, telepresence has a significant influence on pleasure; subsequently, pleasure influenced consumer approach behavior. Second, telepresence positively influenced the approach behavior (directly and indirectly). This verified the effectiveness of a 3 D avatar model using S-O-R.

By decomposing the buying process into a pattern of visits and purchase conversion at each visit, we can better understand the relationship between Web usage behavior and purchase decision. This allows us to more accurately forecast a shopper's future purchase decision at the site and hence determine the value of individual customers to the siteAccording to our research, not only information seeking behavior but also visiting duration of a customer and participative behavior such as participation in event should be considered as important predicators of purchase decision of customer in a cosmetic <b>internet</b> shopping <b>mall.</b> Keywords...|$|R
