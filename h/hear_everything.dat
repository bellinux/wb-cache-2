25|$|At Tours, Gregory {{could not}} have been better placed to <b>hear</b> <b>everything</b> and meet {{everyone}} of influence in Merovingian culture. Tours lay on the watery highway of the navigable Loire. Five Roman roads radiated from Tours, which lay on the main thoroughfare between the Frankish north and Aquitania, with Spain beyond. At Tours the Frankish influences of the north and the Gallo-Roman influences of the south had their chief contact (see map). As the center for the popular cult of St Martin, Tours was a pilgrimage site, hospital, and a political sanctuary to which important leaders fled during periods of violence and turmoil in Merovingian politics.|$|E

500|$|Many of {{the sound}} effects in Barton Fink are laden with meaning. For example, Barton is summoned by a bell while dining in New York; its sound is light and pleasant. By contrast, the eerie {{sustained}} bell of the Hotel Earle rings endlessly through the lobby, until Chet silences it. The nearby rooms of the hotel emit a constant chorus of guttural cries, moans, and assorted unidentifiable noises. These sounds coincide with Barton's confused mental state and punctuate Charlie's claim that [...] "I <b>hear</b> <b>everything</b> {{that goes on in}} this dump". The applause in the first scene foreshadows the tension of Barton's move west, mixed as it is with the sound of an ocean wave crashing– an image which is shown onscreen soon thereafter.|$|E

Jackson's entire lead vocal {{was performed in}} one take; he had received vocal training every morning throughout {{the production of the}} song. Jazz saxophonist Tom Scott played the lyricon. Bass guitarist Louis Johnson was then brought in and he played his part on every guitar he owned, before Jackson finally settled for a Yamaha bass. Greg Phillinganes was also drafted in and he played the keyboard. He later said of the song, [...] "'Billie Jean' is hot on every level. It's hot rhythmically moving action got Michael excited.

It affects you physically, emotionally, even spiritually." ...|$|E
500|$|Charlie's {{understanding}} of the world is depicted as omniscient, as when he asks Barton about [...] "the two lovebirds next door", {{despite the fact that they}} are several doors away. When Barton asks how he knows about them, Charlie responds: [...] "Seems like I <b>hear</b> <b>everything</b> that goes on in this dump. Pipes or somethin'." [...] His total awareness of the events at the Earle demonstrate the kind of understanding needed to show real empathy, as described by Audrey. This theme returns when Charlie explains in his final scene: [...] "Most guys I just feel sorry for. Yeah. It tears me up inside, to think about what they're going through. How trapped they are. I understand it. I feel for 'em. So I try to help them out." ...|$|E

Because when I write a song it's always done very quickly, completed in 20minutes or maybe half an hour. I never labour anything, or very rarely. The only labouring I've ever done in songwriting might be when I've completed a work, a song, and {{there might be a}} couple of lyrics I don't like, so sometimes I might sit with those and really put some brain power in how to fix up the lines.
