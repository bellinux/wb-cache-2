5|$|In some instances, the {{production}} of analogue pizza cheese can be similar to {{the production}} of cream cheese, although production may be different and homogenization may be avoided. In some varieties, the product is heated to remain at a specific temperature and for a specific amount of time, which causes the proteins <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mix</b> to gelatinize. During this process, salts <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mix</b> serve to emulsify it and thus improve the meltability of the final product. The heated product is then placed in packaging such as bags-in-boxes while still hot, as it is more easily handled in this state compared to when in a solid state. During packaging, these types of pizza cheeses are then quick-cooled to avoid browning of the product, which can occur vis-a-vis the Maillard reaction.|$|E

We assume that each ﬁrm can prevent pollution by undertaking abatement measures. We get that, since <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mixed</b> market <b>the</b> industry output is higher than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> private market, the abatement levels are also higher <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mixed</b> market, and, thus, environmental tax rate <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mixed</b> duopoly is higher than that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> privatized duopoly.

40|$|The {{influences}} of charge stratification on spark ignition (SI) engine combustion and NO emission {{were analyzed using}} a phenomenological model. <b>The</b> mixture <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cylinder was divided spherically into three parts: a central core with a stoichiometric air-fuel charge, a dilution region without any combustible charge, and a mixing region lying between the core and the dilution region. Three mixture stratification parameters such as the extent of dilution <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mixing</b> region, <b>the</b> extent of combustible charge <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mixing</b> region, and <b>the</b> gradient of stratification <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mixing</b> region were investigated. The {{results indicate that the}} extent of combustible charge <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mixing</b> region could reduce in-cylinder NO formation significantly, compared with the extent of dilution <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mixing</b> region. As long as the degree of dilution <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mixing</b> region is within the dilution limit of the combustible charge, the gradient of dilution has little effect on combustion and NO formation. ??

5|$|A 2001 {{report by}} Newell et al. at Southampton University {{undertaken}} for Studio Sound in 2001 {{found that the}} NS-10 had excellent time-domain response at low frequencies – its ability to start and stop in response to signal input {{was found to be}} superior to that of most other nearfield monitors.

5|$|Two {{months after}} the single's release, the Smiths {{recorded}} the song again during aborted sessions for their debut album with producer Troy Tate. This version was recorded a tone lower than the original in the key of F# minor, and features a shorter introduction. The Smiths recorded the song again with producer John Porter in October at Manchester's Pluto Studios. Morrissey rejected {{this version of the}} song. Due to impending deadlines, the version that ultimately appeared on the band's first album The Smiths was a remix of the original master recording from the Strawberry Studios session. For this version, Porter increased the separation between Marr's guitar tracks and Morrissey's vocals, emphasised drummer Mike Joyce's drum beat, pushed Rourke's bass back <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mix,</b> and created a more dramatic opening and conclusion to the song.|$|E
