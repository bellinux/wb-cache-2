The image was in the temple for 1300 years, and when Songtsen Gampo died his soul was {{believed}} to have entered the small wooden statue. During the Cultural Revolution, the clay image was smashed and the smaller Buddha was <b>given</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> Tibetan to the Dalai Lama.|$|E

The matrix depends on the choice of the bases: different choices of bases give rise to different, but equivalent matrices.

5|$|Once {{the embassy}} had been tipped off {{that there was}} a spy {{operating}} in the facility in early 1944, Bazna found it increasingly difficult to gather intelligence. The British Field Office had warned the embassy of a security leak. Bazna forwarded the document to the Germans. The warning had come to Churchill from Roosevelt, who obtained the information <b>given</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> defector to the United States. A new alarm system in the British Embassy now required Bazna to remove a fuse whenever he wanted to look in the ambassador's safe.|$|E

5|$|Prevention {{includes}} {{hand washing}} with soap, drinking clean water, proper disposal of human waste, and breastfeeding babies {{instead of using}} formula. The rotavirus vaccine is recommended in children. Treatment involves getting enough fluids. For mild or moderate cases, this can typically be achieved by drinking oral rehydration solution (a combination of water, salts, and sugar). In those who are breast fed, continued breastfeeding is recommended. For more severe cases, intravenous fluids may be needed. Fluids may also be <b>given</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> nasogastric tube. Zinc supplementation is recommended in children. Antibiotics are generally not needed.|$|E

5|$|Since antiquity {{the concept}} of force has been {{recognized}} as integral to the functioning {{of each of the}} simple machines. The mechanical advantage <b>given</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> simple machine allowed for less force to be used in exchange for that force acting over a greater distance for the same amount of work. Analysis of the characteristics of forces ultimately culminated in the work of Archimedes who was especially famous for formulating a treatment of buoyant forces inherent in fluids.|$|E

Diving hand signals are used to communicate underwater. Professional divers will also learn other methods of communication.|$|E

On 27 March 1965, {{at a dinner party}} <b>given</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> dentist, John Riley, the Lennons, Harrison, and Boyd were given LSD without their knowledge. Although told not to leave the house, Harrison drove them to various nightclubs, with Riley following them by taxi. At the Ad Lib club, they thought the lift up to the club was on fire and started screaming, before finally crawling out of the lift for which Mick Jagger, Marianne Faithfull, and Starr were waiting. Harrison later drove them back home in Boyd's Mini Cooper at no more than 10mph, as he was also feeling the effects of the drug. They stayed up all night at Kenwood, experiencing the full effects of their first LSD trip.|$|E
5|$|Frogs {{are much}} more vocal, {{especially}} during the breeding season when they use their voices to attract mates. The presence of a particular species in an area may be more easily discerned by its characteristic call than by a fleeting glimpse of the animal itself. In most species, the sound is produced by expelling air from the lungs over the vocal cords into an air sac or sacs in the throat or {{at the corner of}} the mouth. This may distend like a balloon and acts as a resonator, helping to transfer the sound to the atmosphere, or the water at times when the animal is submerged. The main vocalisation is the male's loud advertisement call which seeks to both encourage a female to approach and discourage other males from intruding on its territory. This call is modified to a quieter courtship call on the approach of a female or to a more aggressive version if a male intruder draws near. Calling carries the risk of attracting predators and involves the expenditure of much energy. Other calls include those <b>given</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> female in response to the advertisement call and a release call <b>given</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> male or female during unwanted attempts at amplexus. When a frog is attacked, a distress or fright call is emitted, often resembling a scream. The usually nocturnal Cuban tree frog (Osteopilus septentrionalis) produces a rain call when there is rainfall during daylight hours.|$|E

He publicized the letter in the Puerto Rican and American media, {{which led to a}} scandal, an official investigation, and a US whitewashing campaign to protect Rhoads and, by extension, Rockefeller interests. In the ensuing investigation, Rhoads defended himself, saying he had written his comments in anger and as a joke to a New York colleague. Neither Puerto Rico's Attorney General nor the medical community found evidence of his or the project's giving any inappropriate medical treatment, and the scandal was forgotten.|$|E

5|$|The {{building}} incorporated {{many modern}} features, such as sound-proofing and under-seat heating, {{and it was}} also the first cinema in Britain to make use of concealed neon lighting. It had a seating capacity of 1,400 in the stalls and 600 in the circle, with a further 146 seats in the café area. When built, the cinema had a short pedestrian approach to the facade, but this was removed when the A56 was widened. During the Second World War the building was used for concerts, including one <b>given</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> young Julie Andrews. It also played host to the Hallé Orchestra after the orchestra's own home, the Free Trade Hall, was bombed and severely damaged during the Manchester Blitz of 1940.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} the temple begins in 963, when it was {{recorded}} that Ten-Thousand Buddha Hall (Wànfó diàn 万佛殿) was built. The date is written on a beam in the hall, and is also the date <b>given</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> local history of Pingyao county written in the 19th century. A stela written in 1819 also confirms this date. Wanfo Hall is the oldest building at Zhenguo temple, {{and is the only}} surviving building that dates from the short-lived Northern Han dynasty. Although little is known of the temple's history, stelae record that it was renovated in 1540 and in 1816. In 1997, along with Pingyao city and Shuanglin Temple, the Zhenguo temple was inscribed on the World Heritage list as ‘Ancient City of Pingyao’.|$|E

Following this meeting the campaign to oppose the proposal gathered momentum, and in November 2003 a protest was held on the moor, led by environmental campaigner Professor David Bellamy.|$|E
