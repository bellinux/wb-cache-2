5|$|Stream erosion {{has played}} a {{significant}} role in <b>dissecting</b> the mountain range, and many of its peaks are dotted with glaciers. This dissection has resulted in a variety of landforms, such as valleys, crags and domes.

Three streams drain the Itcha Range, namely Corkscrew Creek, Downton Creek and Shag Creek. Although the Itcha Range has been dissected by stream erosion and subsequently glaciated, its original shape has been largely preserved. Rocks in the Itcha Range are a variety of colours, including red, white and yellow.|$|E

Later, while waiting to be attended to by Dr. Parenti, she has another flashback, recalling the time she sought a second opinion about her ova from Dr. Parenti, and was told that her ova might be viable with a sperm donor. In the present, she is called in to be attended to, and she is then assured her scans are in order. Later, Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) and Doggett confront Duffy about threatening letters he has been sending to both Mulder and Dr. Lev. However, when the agents leave, Duffy makes a phone call to Lev, warning him that they are being investigated. In another flashback, Scully asks Mulder to be the donor, to which he happily agrees.|$|E
5|$|Hermann Schlegel first {{proposed}} in 1857 that the species {{belonged to the}} starling family (Sturnidae), reclassifying {{it as part of}} the Sturnus genus S. capensis. This reclassification was observed by other authors; Carl Jakob Sundevall proposed the new genus name Lophopsarus ("crested starling") in 1872, yet Fregilupus varius—the oldest name—remains the bird's binomial, and all other scientific names are synonyms. In 1874, after a detailed analysis of the only known skeleton (held at the Cambridge University Museum of Zoology), James Murie agreed that it was a starling. Richard Bowdler Sharpe said in 1890 that the hoopoe starling was similar to the starling genus Basilornis, but did not note any similarities other than their crests. In 1941, Malcolm R. Miller found the bird's musculature {{similar to that of the}} common starling (Sturnus vulgaris) after he dissected a specimen preserved in spirits at the Cambridge Museum, but noted that the tissue was very degraded and the similarity did not necessarily confirm a relationship with starlings. In 1957, Andrew John Berger cast doubt on the bird's affinity with starlings due to subtle anatomical differences, after <b>dissecting</b> a spirit specimen at the American Museum of Natural History. Some authors proposed a relationship with vangas (Vangidae), but Hiroyuki Morioka rejected this in 1996, after a comparative study of skulls.|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} of intramuscular fat weight on total <b>dissected</b> muscle weight, muscle/bone ratio {{and the growth}} coefficients of ‘standard muscle groups’ was examined in 55 cattle (including foetuses and calves) with total <b>dissected</b> fat contents ranging from 1. 3 to 38. 9 %. Intramuscular fat weight was significantly correlated with total <b>dissected</b> muscle weight (r = 0. 97, P < 0. 01), percentage total <b>dissected</b> fat weight (r = 0. 82, P < 0. 01) and age (r = 0. 72, P < 0. 01). Comparison of two regressions of total muscle weight on total muscle plus bone weight, one based on <b>dissected</b> muscle weight {{and the other on}} <b>dissected</b> muscle weight less intramuscular fat weight, showed that neither the slopes nor the intercepts differed significantly. Comparison of two regressions of muscle/bone ratio on muscle plus bone weight, one based on <b>dissected</b> muscle weight and the other on <b>dissected</b> muscle weight less intramuscular fat weight, showed that neither the regression coefficients nor the intercepts differed significantly. Intramuscular fat varied from 0. 71 to 7. 46 % of chilled side muscle weight in carcasses which had total <b>dissected</b> fat contents ranging from 1. 3 to 35. 1 %.

40|$|We {{examined}} {{the effect of}} different plant architecture types on epiphytic macroinvertebrates of a shallow macrophyte-dominated lake in China.

Benn. and Vallisneria spiralis L.). Macro invertebrate richness showed significant differences among four submersed macrophyte habitats, and higher density per g of dry plant were associated with <b>dissected</b> plants than undissected plants. The average abundance in <b>dissected</b> plants was as three-six times as in undissected plants. The biodiversity of epiphytic macroinvertebrates was higher in <b>dissected</b> plants than undissected plants.

5|$|Reich {{joined the}} Austro-Hungarian Army during the First World War, serving from 1915 to 1918, {{for the last}} two years as a {{lieutenant}} at the Italian front with 40 men under his command. When the war ended he headed for Vienna, enrolling in law at the University of Vienna, but found it dull and switched to medicine after the first semester. He arrived with nothing in a city with little to offer; the overthrow of the Austria-Hungarian empire a few weeks earlier had left the newly formed Republic of German-Austria in the grip of famine. Reich lived on soup, oats and dried fruit from the university canteen, and shared an unheated room with his brother and another undergraduate, wearing his coat and gloves indoors to stave off the cold.

5|$|The dodo was {{variously}} {{declared a}} small ostrich, a rail, an albatross, or a vulture, by early scientists.

This view was met with ridicule, but was later supported by English naturalists Hugh Edwin Strickland and Alexander Gordon Melville in their 1848 monograph The Dodo and Its Kindred, which attempted to separate myth from reality. After <b>dissecting</b> the preserved head and foot of the specimen at the Oxford University Museum and comparing it with the few remains then available of the extinct Rodrigues solitaire (Pezophaps solitaria) they concluded that the two were closely related. Strickland stated that although not identical, these birds shared many distinguishing features of the leg bones, otherwise known only in pigeons.|$|E
5|$|The {{establishment}} of the Kalacoon research station enabled Beebe to research {{the ecology of the}} surrounding jungle in far more detail than had been possible during his earlier expeditions.

In a second study, Beebe performed the same task for a much larger area of jungle, approximately a quarter mile (0.4km) square. During his first season at Kalacoon in 1916, Beebe brought back 300 living specimens for the zoo. This time he succeeded at capturing a hoatzin, the bird that he had narrowly missed during his earlier trip to Guiana, although he was unable to keep it alive for the zoo during the trip back to New York.|$|E

5|$|The {{captain had}} to record his survey in {{painstaking}} paperwork, and Darwin too kept a daily log {{as well as}} detailed notebooks of his finds and speculations, and a diary which became his journal. Darwin's notebooks show a complete professionalism that he had probably learnt at the University of Edinburgh when making natural history notes while exploring {{the shores of the}} Firth of Forth with his brother Erasmus in 1826 and studying marine invertebrates with Robert Edmund Grant for a few months in 1827. Darwin had also collected beetles at Cambridge, but he was a novice in all other areas of natural history. During the voyage Darwin investigated small invertebrates, while collecting specimens of other creatures for experts to examine and describe once the Beagle had returned to England. More than half of his carefully organised zoology notes deal with marine invertebrates, and the notes record closely reasoned interpretations of what he found about their complex internal anatomy while <b>dissecting</b> specimens under his microscope, and of little experiments on their response to stimulation. His onshore observations included intense, analytical comments on possible reasons for the behaviour, distribution, and relation to their environment of the creatures he saw. He made good use of the ship's excellent library of books on natural history, but continually questioned their correctness.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Several {{white matter}} tracts {{in the brain}} cannot be {{identified}} on MR studies because they are indistinguishable from the surrounding white matter. We sought to develop a method to precisely localize white matter tracts by correlating anatomic dissections with corresponding MR images.

Progres-sive dissection was guided by using volume-rendered and cross-sectional images of the <b>dissected</b> specimens.
