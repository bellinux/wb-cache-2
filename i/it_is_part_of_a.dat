5|$|In MN 4, Seorsumuscardinus {{has been}} {{recorded}} from Oberdorf, Austria (sites 3 and 4, which yielded 6 and 17 Seorsumuscardinus alpinus teeth, respectively); Karydia, Greece (S.alpinus); and Tägernaustrasse, Switzerland (5 teeth; S. cf. alpinus). Affalterbach, Germany, where 10 teeth of S.bolligeri were found, is the only known MN 5 locality. In all these localities, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> diverse dormouse fauna. Because the distributions of the two known species are temporally distinct, Prieto suggested that the genus may be useful for biostratigraphy (the use of fossils to determine the age of deposits).

5|$|The black-throated gray warbler {{was first}} {{described}} by John Kirk Townsend from a specimen collected near today's Portland, Oregon. It {{was known to}} the Chinook inhabitants of the northwest coast, who called it Ah Kah a qual. Townsend described the species as Sylvia nigrescens, placing it with the other New World warblers and the unrelated Old World warblers in the genus Sylvia. It is now placed in the genus Setophaga along with about thirty other species, after having been classified in Dendroica for some time. Within its genus, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> group with black throats and yellow face markings that includes the hermit warbler and Townsend's warbler. It is usually considered an early offshoot among this group of species, but genetic studies suggest a close relation to Grace's warbler.|$|E

5|$|Saruman is in {{part the}} {{architect}} of his own downfall. Kocher, Randall Helms and Shippey write that Saruman's actions {{in the first half}} of The Two Towers, although intended to further his own interests, in fact lead to his defeat and that of Sauron: his orcs help split the Fellowship at Parth Galen, and in carrying off two of the hobbits initiate a series of incidents that lead to his ruin. In turn this frees the Rohirrim to intervene at the Battle of the Pelennor Fields and then together with the men of Gondor to assault Sauron's stronghold of Mordor and distract him from Frodo's final effort to destroy the Ring. Shippey says that this demonstrates the value of persistence in the face of despair, even if a way out cannot be seen; Kocher and Helms write that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> pattern of providential events and of the reversed effects of evil intentions throughout the book.|$|E
5|$|Speculation {{assigned}} Lisa's name to {{at least}} four different paintings and her identity {{to at least}} ten different people. By {{the end of the}} 20th century, the painting was a global icon that had been used in more than 300 other paintings and in 2,000advertisements, appearing at an average of one new advertisement each week. In 2005, an expert at the University Library of Heidelberg discovered a margin note in the library's collection that established with certainty the traditional view that the sitter was Lisa. The note, written by Agostino Vespucci in 1503, states that Leonardo was working on a portrait of Lisa del Giocondo. The Mona Lisa has been in custody of France since the 16th century, when it was acquired by King Francis I; after the French Revolution, however, it came into the possession of the people. Today about six million people visit the painting each year at the Louvre in Paris, where <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> French national collection.|$|E
