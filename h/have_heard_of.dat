He interviewed the program's regular hosts, and also the rapper Eminem (whom he pretended never to <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of),</b> and put a humorous slant on the local news and community calendar.|$|E
5|$|Some Japanese holdouts, {{especially}} on small Pacific Islands, refused to surrender at all (believing the declaration to be propaganda or considering surrender against their code). Some may never <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> it. Teruo Nakamura, the last known holdout, {{emerged from his}} hidden retreat in Indonesia in December 1974, while two other Japanese soldiers, who had joined Communist guerrillas {{at the end of}} the war, fought in southern Thailand until 1991.|$|E
5|$|When the {{question}} of whether a person is alive or dead arises, and it is shown that he was alive within 30 years, the burden of proving {{that he or she is}} dead lies on the person who affirms it. However, if it is proved that he or she has not been heard of for seven years by those who would naturally <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> the person if he or she had been alive, the burden of proving that the person is alive shifts to the person who affirms this.|$|E

60|$|I <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> Miss Havisham up town,--everybody {{for miles}} round <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> Miss Havisham up town,--as an immensely rich and grim lady {{who lived in}} a large and dismal house barricaded against robbers, and who led a life of seclusion.|$|R

What odious man was this whom her {{neighbours}} {{were going to}} take into their very bosom!

5|$|While some evangelical Christians {{consider}} Harry Potter {{related to}} Satanism, a poll in 2000 {{indicated that this}} position remains a minority view. Seven percent of Americans who <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> the books {{have a negative view}} of them, with 52 percent having a positive opinion and the remaining 41 percent unsure. This compares with 33 percent of Americans who identify themselves as Evangelical and 39 percent who take the Bible literally.|$|E
5|$|Hastings {{eventually}} switched {{sides and}} joined the Labour Party. His conversion, especially {{in the light of}} later events, was regarded by some as suspect: his entry in the Dictionary of Labour Biography reports speculation that Hastings foresaw that Labour may come to Government and had few senior lawyers to fill the Law Officer posts. John Paton, after speaking from the same Independent Labour Party (ILP) platform as Hastings, {{came to the conclusion that}} Hastings gave political speeches using his skill as a lawyer to master a brief; on the train home, Hastings appeared not to <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> the ILP.|$|E
5|$|Several {{sources have}} {{reported}} 610 officers as {{being involved in}} or ordering the torture of Falun Gong adherents in custody. In a letter to Chinese leaders in 2005, prominent human rights lawyer Gao Zhisheng relayed accounts of 610 officers beating and sexually assaulting Falun Gong practitioners: “of all the true accounts of incredible violence that I <b>have</b> <b>heard,</b> <b>of</b> all {{the records of the}} government’s inhuman torture of its own people, what has shaken me most is the routine practice {{on the part of the}} 6–10 Office and the police of assaulting women’s genitals,” wrote Gao. Defector Hao Fengjun described witnessing one of his 610 Office colleagues beating an elderly female Falun Gong practitioner with an iron bar. The event helped catalyze Hao's decision to defect to Australia. The 2009 report of the UN Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial Killings relayed allegations that the 610 Office was involved in the torture deaths of Falun Gong practitioners ahead of the 2008 Beijing Olympics.|$|E
30|$|Overall, {{less than}} half (n[*]=[*] 158; 45.7 %) of the {{respondents}} indicated that they <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> prostate cancer. Analysed by race group, 70.9 % of white, 46.2 % of coloured and 39.5 % <b>of</b> black respondents <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> prostate cancer (p[*]<[*] 0.0001). <b>Of</b> those who <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> prostate cancer, 20.9 % had a low level of knowledge, 73.4 % a moderate level and 5.7 % a high level of knowledge (Table  2). The media to which respondents were most commonly exposed were television (71.7 %) and radio (66.8 %) (Table  1).|$|R
60|$|Mr Tippet, whose wonted vivacity {{was quite}} subdued by the {{freezing}} {{influence of the}} Eagle, said that he <b>had</b> not <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> it; whereupon Miss Tippet said that she <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> it, and so had Willie Willders, who <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> it from his brother Frank, who <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> it from Joe Corney himself; and then she attempted to relate the matter, but failed, and finally asked Willie to tell the story, which Willie did with much gusto; looking at Miss Deemas all the time, and speaking in a very positive tone, as if {{he thought she was}} doubting every word he said, and was resolved to hurl it in her teeth, whether she chose to believe it or not.|$|R

25|$|HIV/AIDS {{education}} is somewhat limited in Gaborone. 14.5% of Gaborone residents between 10–64 who <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> HIV/AIDS believe that HIV can be spread through witchcraft, and 31.3% {{of the residents}} believe HIV can be spread through mosquito bites.|$|E
25|$|According to a 2010 survey, {{awareness}} of the reforms varies widely within the Moroccan population, with younger, urban, and educated women {{far more likely to}} <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> the law and have some familiarity with its provisions than women in rural areas, those with less education, and older women. Of Moroccans who <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> the new Mudawana, 85% of women and 59% of men support the reforms. Most men who oppose the reforms believe the law negatively impacts them, gives greater weight to their spouses' demands, and view it as contrary to their religious beliefs. Women's dissatisfaction with the Mudawana, however, reflects a belief that it is not implemented widely and successfully enough to address the problems of women's rights. Two-thirds of Moroccan women surveyed said they felt the new Mudawana had improved women's status in Morocco, and 50% of men agreed.|$|E

25|$|The Elder Wand, known {{throughout}} {{history as the}} Deathstick or the Wand of Destiny, is an extremely powerful wand made of elder wood with a core of Thestral tail hair. While most wizards <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> supposedly invincible wands in wizarding history, wand experts and seekers after the Deathly Hallows realize {{that these are the}} same wand, reappearing periodically in the hand of a new owner.|$|E
25|$|In the English-speaking world, {{many people}} who {{otherwise}} might not <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> the landing at Suvla Bay know something of its history through the song And the Band Played Waltzing Matilda written in 1972 by Eric Bogle and covered by numerous artists including the Clancy Brothers, Joan Baez and the Pogues. The song, while emotionally charged and vivid, is not an accurate historical account of the landing and subsequent events. Suvla also appears in the traditional Irish song The Foggy Dew commemorating the 1916 Easter Rising.|$|E
25|$|Some scholars, such as Carsten Peter Thiede, dispute this presentation. Early Christian leaders did {{not have}} to visit Qumran to <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> Essene beliefs and read their texts. The various Jewish groups, {{including}} Christians and Essenes, were interconnected and simultaneously adopted some practices and beliefs while rejecting others. While some similarities exist, there are many differences and similar parallels can be also drawn between the early Christians and Pharisees, and other Jewish sects. Many features of Christian faith have no parallels in the texts from Qumran, and some that do are fundamentally distinct from Essene practices and beliefs. Notably, John's act of penitent baptism bears little resemblance to the daily baptismal ritual of the Essenes.|$|E
60|$|Nikita, surnamed Necator, with a {{sinister}} aptness <b>of</b> alliteration! Razumov <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> him. He <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> so much since crossing {{the frontier of}} these celebrities of the militant revolution; the legends, the stories, the authentic chronicle, which now and then peeps out before a half-incredulous world. Razumov <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> him. He {{was supposed to have}} killed more, gendarmes and police agents than any revolutionist living. He had been entrusted with executions.|$|R

When he had found his senses again I prayed him not to suffer himself to be carried away with hope, since although Gaasha <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> Sihamba, he <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> nothing <b>of</b> Suzanne.|$|R
25|$|Following graduation, Eliot {{attended}} Milton Academy in Massachusetts for a preparatory year, {{where he}} met Scofield Thayer who later published The Waste Land. He studied philosophy at Harvard College from 1906 to 1909, earning his bachelor's degree after three years, {{instead of the usual}} four. While a student, Eliot was placed on academic probation and graduated with a pass degree (i.e. no honours). He recovered and persisted, attaining a B.A. in an elective program best described as comparative literature in three years, and an M.A. in English literature in the fourth. Frank Kermode writes that the most important moment of Eliot's undergraduate career was in 1908 when he discovered Arthur Symons's The Symbolist Movement in Literature. This introduced him to Jules Laforgue, Arthur Rimbaud, and Paul Verlaine. Without Verlaine, Eliot wrote, he might never <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> Tristan Corbière and his book Les amours jaunes, a work that affected the course of Eliot's life. The Harvard Advocate published some of his poems and he became lifelong friends with Conrad Aiken the American novelist.|$|E
500|$|While {{academics}} {{have both}} praised and criticized Tyler, the general American public has little awareness {{of him at}} all. Several writers have portrayed Tyler as among the nation's most obscure presidents. As Seager remarked: [...] "His countrymen generally remember him, if they <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> him at all, as the rhyming end of a catchy campaign slogan." ...|$|E
500|$|... "It's the American presidential seal – {{anyone can}} use it," [...] said Marky Ramone of the logo's ubiquity. [...] "We share the {{royalties}} on the t-shirt {{and on the}} merchandise. A lot of the kids wearing that shirt might not even <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> the Ramones' music. I guess {{if you have the}} shirt, your curiosity might bring you to buy the music. Whatever, it is a strange phenomenon." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{following}} day, the King suffered several heart attacks, {{but refused}} to go to bed, saying, [...] "No, I shall not give in; I shall go on; I shall work to the end." [...] Between moments of faintness, his son the Prince of Wales (shortly to be King George V) {{told him that his}} horse, Witch of the Air, had won at Kempton Park that afternoon. The King replied, [...] "Yes, I <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> it. I am very glad": his final words. At 11:30p.m. he lost consciousness for the last time and was put to bed. He died 15 minutes later.|$|E
500|$|The {{setting of}} Gone to Coney Island is Coney Island, a popular {{amusement}} park and picture subject. One review in The Moving Picture World {{went so far}} as to give a review that was devoid of meaning by stating, [...] "Not much further explanation is needed. Those who have been there and those who <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> it know what it means. Perhaps nothing further is required." [...] Bowers notes that the popularity of Coney Island was itself able to make a successful film regardless of the scenario involved. Booming Business is notable because it appears to have contained slapstick comedy if The New York Dramatic Mirror review was accurate. Edwin Thanhouser specifically stated that the company would not produce slapstick comedy in an article in The Moving Picture World.|$|E
500|$|A myth {{has arisen}} that Bryan was an unknown prior to 1896. This {{was not the}} case; Bryan was well known as an orator on the tariff and silver questions. Albert Shaw, editor of The Review of Reviews, stated that after Bryan's nomination, many easterners professed not to <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> him but: [...] "If, indeed, they had not heard of Mr. Bryan before, they had failed to follow closely the course of American {{politics}} {{in the past eight}} years. As a Democratic member of the Ways and Means Committee through two Congresses, Mr. Bryan was by all odds the ablest and strongest orator on the Democratic side of the House. His subsequent canvass [...] for the United States senatorship in Nebraska was noteworthy and conspicuous on many accounts." ...|$|E

40|$|Sources of AIDS {{awareness}} among {{rural and}} urban Indian women were analysed {{using data from the}} National Family and Health Survey (1998 – 2000). Two measures were developed to study the impact each source had on knowledge. ‘Effectiveness’ was defined as the proportion <b>of</b> women who <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> AIDS from only one source, from among women who <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> AIDS from that particular source and other sources. ‘Independent effect’ was the proportion who <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> AIDS from only one source in relation to all women who <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> AIDS. Television was the most effective medium, and also had the highest independent effect. Radio and print had very low effectiveness and independent effect. Although television and print audiences are growing in India, it is likely a sub-group of women will continue to lack media access. There is an urgent need to disseminate AIDS awareness to this ‘media underclass’. Since the media will not reach this group, other sources including health workers, community level activities such as adult education programmes, and networks of friends and relatives need to be explored...|$|R
