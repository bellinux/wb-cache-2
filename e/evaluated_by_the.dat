5|$|In 1956, {{the test}} program was {{transferred}} to Fort Eustis, Virginia, where Captain Selmer Sundby took over test-flying duties. The HZ-1 had been designed to be very easy to fly, and early testing indicated that untrained soldiers could learn to operate the craft in less than 20 minutes, and some claiming that only five minutes of instruction were required. In addition, the HZ-1 proved to be faster than other flying platform designs <b>evaluated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Army. Sundby, however, quickly determined that the craft was {{much more difficult to}} fly than had been expected, and would not be safe {{in the hands of an}} inexperienced pilot. In addition, the low-mounted rotors proved to be prone to kicking up small rocks and other debris.|$|E
5|$|Katniss and Peeta {{are taken}} to the Capitol. In the {{few days before the}} Games start, they are advised and {{supported}} by a team consisting of their drunken mentor, Haymitch Abernathy, the sole living District 12 victor of the Hunger Games; Effie Trinket; and two fashion stylists and three prep workers who help each tribute look his or her best. Katniss's stylist, Cinna, is the only person at the Capitol she considers a friend. They are also introduced to the general public, given some training, and <b>evaluated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Gamemakers. Katniss and, to a lesser extent, Peeta set themselves apart from the other tributes. Rue, the petite 12-year-old girl tribute from District 11, takes to following them around.|$|E
5|$|Small batch {{production}} of the single-seat, single-engine JF-17s began in China in June 2006. The first two small-batch-produced aircraft were delivered on 2 March 2007 and first flew in Pakistan on 10 March. They took part in an aerial display on 23 March 2007 {{as part of the}} Pakistan Day Joint Services Parade in Islamabad. Another six small-batch-produced aircraft were delivered by March 2008. These were extensively flight-tested and <b>evaluated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> PAF. Two serial production aircraft were delivered from China in 2009 and the first Pakistani-manufactured aircraft was delivered to the PAF in a ceremony on 23 November 2009.|$|E

5|$|The F-4C {{variant of}} the PhantomII was among the {{aircraft}} <b>evaluated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> RAAF in 1963 {{as part of the}} project to replace its English Electric Canberra bombers. The F-111 was selected, but when that project was delayed in the late 1960s due to long-running technical faults with the aircraft, the RAAF determined that the F-4E PhantomII would be the best alternative. As a result of continued problems with the F-111s, the Australian and United States Governments negotiated an agreement in 1970 whereby the RAAF leased 24 F-4Es and their support equipment from the USAF.|$|E
5|$|On 25 March 2010, an A-10 {{conducted}} {{the first flight}} of an aircraft with all engines powered by a biofuel blend. The flight, performed at Eglin Air Force Base, used a 1:1 blend of JP-8 and Camelina-based fuel. On 28 June 2012, the A-10 became the first aircraft to fly using a new fuel blend derived from alcohol; known as ATJ (Alcohol-to-Jet), the fuel is cellulosic-based that can be derived using wood, paper, grass, or any cellulose based material, and are fermented into alcohols before being hydro-processed into aviation fuel. ATJ is the third alternative fuel to be <b>evaluated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Air Force {{as a replacement for}} petroleum-derived JP-8 fuel. Previous types were a synthetic paraffinic kerosene derived from coal and natural gas and a bio-mass fuel derived from plant-oils and animal fats known as Hydroprocessed Renewable Jet.|$|E
5|$|The 2001 dive season {{concentrated}} on raising the ship's steam engine and condenser. Hull plates {{had to be}} removed to access the engine compartment and both the engine and the condenser had to be separated from the ship, the surrounding wreckage and each other. A Mini Rover ROV was used to provide visibility of the wreck and divers to the support staff above water. The engine was raised on 16 July and the condenser three days later by the crane barge Wotan. Saturation diving was <b>evaluated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Navy that dive season on Monitor and proved to be very successful, allowing divers to maximize their time on the bottom. The surface-supplied divers evaluated the use of heliox due to the depth of the wreck. It also proved to be successful once the dive tables were adjusted.|$|E
