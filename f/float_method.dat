50|$|Most sample {{analysis}} is conducted after the experiment is quenched and {{removed from the}} multi-anvil. However, {{it is also possible}} to perform measurements in-situ. Circuits, including thermocouples or pressure variable resistors, can be built into the assembly to accurately measure temperature and pressure. Acoustic interferometry can be used to measure seismic velocities through a material or to infer density of materials. Resistivity can be measured by complex impedance spectroscopy. Magnetic properties can be measured using amplified nuclear magnetic resonance in specially configured multi-anvils. The DIA multi-anvil design often includes diamond or sapphire windows built into the tungsten anvils to allow x-rays or neutrons to penetrate into the sample. This type of device gives researchers at synchrotron and neutron spallation sources the capacity to perform diffraction experiments to measure the structure of samples under extreme conditions. This is essential for observing unquenchable phases of matter because they are kinetically and thermodynamically unstable at low temperatures and pressure. Viscosity and density of high-pressure melts can be measured in-situ using the sink <b>float</b> <b>method</b> and neutron tomography. In this method a sample is implanted with objects, such platinum spheres, that have different density and neutron scattering properties compared to the material surrounding them, and the path of the object is tracked as it sinks, or floats, through the melt. Two objects with contrasting buoyancy can be used simultaneously to calculate the density.|$|E

First, the total flow 2 ̆ 7 rate was measured using current meters and calculated cross-sectional flow area. Second, the surface velocity was measured using four trials of the <b>float</b> <b>method,</b> and the average float travel time was calculated for each location and measurement instance. The measurements were taken on different days for various water depths in the canals. Third, the surface and mean cross-sectional velocities were divided, yielding the surface velocity coefficient, for every measurement {{at each of the}} five locations. Several channel bed elevations were also measured near each location along a distance of 100 m or more, as necessary, to define the average longitudinal bed slope. Linear equations and averages were developed from the relationship between the velocity ratios and critical depth, and between those ratios and the measured water depths. Finally, the approximate cross-sectional velocity profiles for several of the measurement instances were produced using GIS software. All the steps mentioned above were followed to determine surface velocity coefficients for use with the <b>float</b> <b>method.</b> The results in the five locations show that the coefficients are not proportional to the water depth variation, and that the presence of rocks and sediment in the channel bed affect the coefficient values. Consequently, the development of a linear relation among coefficients to correct the surface velocity obtained from <b>float</b> <b>method</b> was difficult to obtain from the available data. In the five measurement locations, the surface velocity coefficients vary from 0. 33 to 0. 81 and the measured water depths during the period of evaluation were from 0. 16 m to 0. 53 m.

30|$|In the <b>float</b> <b>method,</b> {{an object}} of low density is allowed to float for a known {{distance}} in the stream, and the time taken by the float is measured and water speed calculated (Hauet et al. 2008; Gordon et al. 2013). The speed of water and the cross-sectional area is used for calculating the water flow in the stream (Peltz and Schwartz 2008). To overcome error, 5 – 10 floats should be recorded. The floats should ideally be made of materials such as a water-soaked block of wood, or other natural material that has less per unit area mass and can be easily spotted from a distance (Harrelson et al. 1994; Harwell and Asquith 2011). This is a simple, non-polluting method and does not require extensive resources and high skills (Grant and Brian 1997; Hauer and Lamberti 2007). However, the results are often inaccurate because vertical turbulent motion causes {{the difference between the}} velocity of different surfaces of streams and float does not represent the actual flow (Hilgersom and Luxemburg 2012). This method is suitable for small and straight streams or canals with low and even flow (Hudson 1993); its applicability for larger streams is questionable. To overcome this, the integrated <b>float</b> <b>method</b> has been developed (Herschy 1978, 1995; Hilgersom and Luxemburg 2012), where a float is released {{at the bottom of a}} river or canal.

We reviewed available methods for monitoring streamflow on the basis of six criteria viz. their applicability across different terrains and size of the streams, operational ease, time effectiveness, accuracy, environmental impact that they may cause and cost involve in it. On the basis of {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} each of the methods reviewed, we conclude that the timed volume method is apt for hilly terrain having smaller streams due to its operational ease and accuracy of results. Although comparatively expensive, the weir and flume methods are suitable for long term studies of small hill streams, since once the structure is put in place, it yields accurate results. In flat terrain, the <b>float</b> <b>method</b> is best suited for smaller streams for its operational ease and cost effectiveness, whereas, for larger streams, the particle image velocimetry may be used for its accuracy.

Stream monitoring forms a critical basis for water resource management. The volume and functions of the streams are controlled by hydrologic processes that can be defined by the geology, topography and climate of the area, along with impact of human activities. Understanding the streamflow and the hydrological processes determining the streamflow is critical for the efficient and optimum allocation of water resources, so as to realize their maximum social and economic value.

A river/stream can be monitored using a method that is appropriate for the objective of the study, resources and expertise availability, stream size and terrain. On the basis of review of literature and qualitative index developed (Table  3), we concluded that, for monitoring small mountain streams, timed volume method is apt and provides a high degree of accuracy. For mountain streams with large quantity of water, weir and flume methods are more efficient and can be used for a long term study. For small streams in flat terrain, <b>float</b> <b>method</b> can be used, whereas, for larger streams, dilution gauging is a better method if tracer is properly added to all the surfaces of the stream and if tracer does not alter water quality (Table S 2).
