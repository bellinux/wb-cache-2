40|$|This paper {{presents}} the theoretical analysis and modeling of an electrodynamic tether (EDT) system under {{an assortment of}} mission scenarios and physical constraints {{with a focus on}} comparing electron emission technologies used {{at one end of the}} tether. There are three different types of electron emitters considered: thermionic cathodes, field emitter arrays, and hollow cathodes. Each is evaluated for its potential use in three different system architectures: basic grounded-emitter, basic grounded-gate and series-bias system architectures. The overall results show how the efficiencies and power consumptions change depending on the mission objectives.

40|$|We {{present for}} the first time Very-Long-Baseline Interferometry images of the radio galaxy Cygnus A at the {{frequency}} of 86 GHz. Thanks to the high spatial resolution of only ∼ 200 Schwarzschild radii (R_ S), such observations provide an extremely detailed view of the nuclear regions in this archetypal object and allow us to derive important constraints for theoretical models describing the launching of relativistic jets. A pixel-based analysis of the jet outflow, which still appears two-sided on the scales probed, was performed. By fitting Gaussian functions to the transverse intensity profiles, we could determine the jet width in the nuclear region. The base of the jets appears wide. The minimum measured transverse width of ∼ (227 ± 98) R_ S is significantly larger than the radius of the Innermost Stable Circular Orbit, suggesting that the outer accretion disk is contributing to the jet launching. The existence of a faster and Doppler <b>de-boosted</b> inner section, powered either from the rotation of the inner regions of the accretion disk or by the spinning black hole, is suggested by the kinematic properties and by the observed limb brightening of the flow.

50|$|Take, for example, the NASA Propulsive Small Expendable Deployer System (ProSEDS) {{mission as}} seen in above figure. At 300 km altitude, the Earth's {{magnetic}} field, in the north-south direction, is approximately 0.18-0.32 gauss up to ~40° inclination, and the orbital velocity {{with respect to the}} local plasma is about 7500 m/s. This results in a Vemf range of 35-250 V/km along the 5 km length of tether. This EMF dictates the potential difference across the bare tether which controls where electrons are collected and / or repelled. Here, the ProSEDS <b>de-boost</b> tether system is configured to enable electron collection to the positively biased higher altitude section of the bare tether, and returned to the ionosphere at the lower altitude end. This flow of electrons through the length of the tether {{in the presence of the}} Earth's magnetic field creates a force that produces a drag thrust that helps de-orbit the system, as given by the above equation.The boost mode is similar to the de-orbit mode, except for the fact that a High Voltage Power Supply (HVPS) is also inserted in series with the tether system between the tether and the higher positive potential end. The power supply voltage must be greater than the EMF and the polar opposite. This drives the current in the opposite direction, which in turn causes the higher altitude end to be negatively charged, while the lower altitude end is positively charged(Assuming a standard east to west orbit around Earth).|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} 1. 1 mm {{wavelength}} imaging survey covering 0. 3 deg 2 in the COSMOS field. These data, obtained with the AzTEC continuum {{camera on the}} James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT), were centred on a prominent large-scale structure overdensity which includes a rich X-ray cluster at z ≈ 0. 73. A total of 50 millimetre galaxy candidates, with a significance ranging from 3. 5 – 8. 5 σ, are extracted from the central 0. 15 deg 2 area which has a uniform sensitivity of ∼ 1. 3 mJy/beam. Sixteen sources are detected with S/N � 4. 5, where the expected false-detection rate is zero, of which a surprisingly large number (9) have intrinsic (<b>de-boosted)</b> fluxes � 5 mJy at 1. 1 mm. Assuming the emission is dominated by radiation from dust, heated by a massive population of young, optically-obscured stars, then these bright AzTEC sources have FIR luminosities> 6 × 10 12 L ⊙ and star formation-rates> 1100 M⊙/yr. Two of these nine bright AzTEC sources are found towards the extreme peripheral region of the X-ray cluster, whilst the remainder are distributed across the larger-scale over-density.

40|$|Many short GRBs show prompt tails lasting up to {{hundreds}} of seconds that can be energetically dominant over the initial sub-second spike. In this paper we develop an electromagnetic model of short GRBs that explains the two stages of the energy release, the prompt spike and the prompt tail. The key ingredient of the model is the recent discovery that an isolated black hole can keep its open magnetic flux for times much longer than the collapse time and, thus, can spin-down electromagnetically, driving the relativistic wind. First, the merger is preceded by an electromagnetic precursor wind. If {{a fraction of the}} wind power is converted into pulsar-like coherent radio emission, this may produce an observable radio burst of few milliseconds. At the active stage of the merger, two neutron stars produces a black hole surrounded by an accretion torus in which the amplified magnetic field extracts the rotational energy of the black hole and drives an axially-collimated electromagnetic wind. For observers nearly aligned with the orbital normal this is seen as a classical short GRB. After the accretion of the torus, the isolated black hole keeps the open magnetic flux and drives the equatorially (not axially) collimated outflow, which is seen by an observer at intermediate polar angles as a prompt tail. The tail carries more energy than the prompt spike, but its emission is <b>de-boosted</b> for observers along the orbital normal. Observers in the equatorial plane miss the prompt spike and interpret the prompt tail as an energetic supernova-less long GRB. We also demonstrate that episodic accretion onto the BH of magnetized clouds that carry non-zero magnetic flux can be highly efficient in extracting the spin energy of the BH, producing the outflows with the power exceeding the average accretion power...|$|R
40|$|We {{present an}} 850 -??m map and list of {{candidate}} sources in a subarea of the Groth Strip observed using the Submillimetre Common-User Bolometer Array (SCUBA). The map {{consists of a}} long strip of adjoining jiggle-maps covering the southwestern 70 arcmin of the original Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 Groth Strip to an average 1 ?? rms noise level of ??? 3. 5 mJy. We initially detect seven candidate sources with signal-to-noise ratios between 3. 0 and 3. 5 ?? and four candidate sources with signal-to-noise ratio ??? 3. 5. Simulations suggest that on average in a map this size one expects 1. 6 false positive sources ??? 3. 5 ?? and 4. 5 between 3 and 3. 5 ??. Flux boosting in maps is a well-known effect and we have developed a simple Bayesian prescription for estimating the unboosted flux distribution and used this method {{to determine the best}} flux estimates of our sources. This method is easily adapted for any other modest signal-to-noise survey in which there is prior knowledge of the source counts. We performed follow-up photometry in an attempt to confirm or reject five of our source candidates. We failed to significantly redetect three of the five sources in the noisiest regions of the map, suggesting that they are either spurious or have true fluxes close to the noise level. However, we did confirm the reality of two of the SCUBA sources, although at lower flux levels than suggested in the map. Not surprisingly, we find that the photometry results are consistent with and confirm the <b>de-boosted</b> map fluxes. Our final candidate source list contains three sources, including the two confirmed detections and one further candidate source with signal-to-noise ratio > 3. 5 ?? which has a reasonable chance of being real. We performed correlations and found evidence of positive flux at the positions of XMM-Newton X-ray sources. The 95 per cent lower limit for the average flux density of these X-ray sources is 0. 8 mJy. ?? 2005 RAS...|$|R
40|$|Express was a multi-national capsule mission, {{which was}} put into orbit by a Japanese launcher. After a nominal orbital liftime of about 5. 5 days the capsule was planned to be landed in South Australia. During this mission GSOC had the {{operational}} control and was also {{be responsible for the}} planning of the return manoeuvre never before exercised in Germany and Europe. In order to determine the re-entry manoeuvre a prototype software for re-entry calculations provided by ESA was used. This software provides a lot of optimisation options regarding <b>de-boost</b> manoeuvre size, acceleration peak, net heat rate peak, etc., whereas an optimisation (minimisation) of the landing error ellipse is not supported. As this minimisation is very important because of the time limitation for the capsule recovery,two approaches are possible:i) use the rigorous re-entry software and optimise the landing error ellipse by manually changing the input parameters; ii) use of semi- analytical algorithms. The second approach was selected using only a Keplerian orbit, a simple model for the atmosphere, a spherical shape of the Earth, and a mean ballistic coefficient for the capsule to determine the optimised thrust direction. The last orbit before the <b>de-boost</b> manoeuvre (given by a state vector within the last orbit) and the inertial radius vector to the landing point must be known as input. At each position within this orbit only one in-plane angle exists for a minimum landing dispersion. A comparsion of the results of both approaches shows that the difference in the semi-major Axes is about 200 m (length of the semi-major axis is in both cases about 80 km). Much more important is the speed improvement: about one hour would be necessary for the optimisation of the error ellipse using approach i), whereas only less than one second is needed by optimising it with the new algorithmÖ...|$|E

The system is jointly developed by Alenia Spazio and by University "La Sapienza" {{in view of}} potential commercial exploitation. An innovative engineering approach has tackled four critical issues: 1) the deployment mechanism, which ensures a purely passive extension of the tether under extremely small gravity gradients; 2) the tether structure and configuration, which guarantees a very high survivability to impacts from artificial and natural debris; 3) the inflatable passive electron collector, which increases {{the efficiency of the}} system while reducing the tether length to 4 - 5 km and 4) the electrodynamic control of the tether librations, which limits the effects of inherent dynamical system instability, while preserving high de-orbiting efficiencies.

40|$|The unique work {{presented}} in this thesis will first focus on integration of the latest theoretical and experimental electrodynamic aspects of an electrodynamic tether (EDT) into a time-independent simulation tool. Numerous elements have then be compared on a system level, including passive electron collection (or active ion emission) technologies, active electron emission technologies, bare versus insulated tether scenarios, boosting and <b>de-boosting</b> conditions, and various system element configurations. These results indicate {{that in many cases}} bare tether anodes are the optimal electron collection mechanism. In addition, it was shown that while hollow cathodes may be the best active electron emission technique, field emitter arrays result in less than 1 % difference in system thrusting and use no consumables. This {{is based on the assumption}} that several-amp field emitter arrays can be built eventually. Issues that have troubled previous systems are the efficiency at which the tether collects current, the total surface area, and the bare tether geometry. Experimental work was conducted to compare the effects of porous flat-tape tether geometries to those of slotted and solid geometries. The experiment investigated these different tether configurations to better understand the physics involved and how to apply the different tether geometries to an EDT system. This work has resulted in evidence showing that, regardless of the orientation of the probe with respect to the flowing plasma, equivalent mass holed tapes outperform that of slotted tapes. These slotted tapes, in turn, outperform solid tapes on an equivalent mass basis. Modeling of hollow cathodes and other ion emission technologies has been a key concern to EDT technology and will have great implications to EDT systems. As tether systems venture outside of the ionosphere, there will likely need to be an alternate method for collecting electrons. An initial investigation using a hollow cathode as an electron collection source in the momentum exchange electrodynamic reboost (MXER) system was conducted. Results indicated that although this technology may produce a slight enhancement in thrust over a bare tether in altitudes over 1000 km, however, it requires too much consumable mass to be feasible...|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} first polarimetric space very long {{baseline}} interferometry (VLBI) imaging observations at 22 GHz. BL Lacertae {{was observed in}} 2013 November 10 with the RadioAstron space VLBI mission, including a ground array of 15 radio telescopes. The instrumental polarization of the space radio telescope {{is found to be}} less than 9 %, demonstrating the polarimetric imaging capabilities of RadioAstron at 22 GHz. Ground-space fringes were obtained up to a projected baseline distance of 7. 9 Earth diameters in length, allowing us to image the jet in BL Lacertae with a maximum angular resolution of 21 μas, the highest achieved to date. We find evidence for emission upstream of the radio core, which may correspond to a recollimation shock at about 40 μas from the jet apex, in a pattern that includes other recollimation shocks at approximately 100 and 250 μas from the jet apex. Polarized emission is detected in two components within the innermost 0. 5 mas from the core, as well as in some knots 3 mas downstream. Faraday rotation analysis, obtained from combining RadioAstron 22 GHz and ground-based 15 and 43 GHz images, shows a gradient in rotation measure and Faraday-corrected polarization vector as a function of position angle with respect to the core, suggesting that the jet in BL Lacertae is threaded by a helical magnetic field. The intrinsic <b>de-boosted</b> brightness temperature in the unresolved core exceeds K, suggesting, at the very least, departure from equipartition of energy between the magnetic field and radiating particles.
