25|$|The {{operation}} got underway {{the next}} day without incident. Springer was brought north through Puget Sound and Haro Strait, across the border and then to Campbell River, BC, where locals donated hundreds of bags of ice {{to help keep the}} orca cool. The catamaran traveled through the Inside Passage to Johnstone Strait, then to Dongchong Bay, and Hanson Island, not far from OrcaLab. The previous day, high-tech hydrophones were installed in Dongchong Bay. A net pen was in place, filled with wild Pacific salmon caught by local First Nations fishermen under a specially granted <b>fishing</b> <b>permit.</b>|$|E
25|$|During one OOF {{meeting in}} June, a Motion {{was made on}} behalf of Dr. Spong and OrcaLab to use OOF funds to {{contract}} commercial fishermen from the Namgis First Nation of Johnstone Strait, BC, to catch and provide wild salmon for Springer {{while she was in}} her seapen in Dongchong Bay, Hanson Island, the repatriation site and territory of the Namgis. If the money were approved, Dr. Spong would help arrange an out-of-season <b>fishing</b> <b>permit</b> from DFO, and Namgis Chief Bill Cranmer would put together a boat and crew. A member of OOF, together with a representative from NMFS present at the meeting, urged instead the use of farmed Atlantic salmon provided by a local aquaculture company, even though the First Nations in the region were adamantly opposed to fish farms in their waters. It was argued that the logistics of feeding Springer wild fish was too much to take on for the team, particularly this close to the capture date.|$|E
