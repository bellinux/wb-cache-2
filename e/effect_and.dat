5|$|A Faraday filter, {{magneto-optical}} filter, FADOF or EFADOF (Excited Faraday Dispersive Optical Filter) {{works by}} rotating the polarization {{of the light}} passing through the vapor cell. This rotation occurs near its atomic absorption lines by the Faraday <b>effect</b> <b>and</b> anomalous dispersion. Only light at the resonant frequency of the vapor is rotated and the polarized plates block other electromagnetic radiation. This effect is related to and enhanced by the Zeeman Effect, or the splitting of atomic absorption lines {{in the presence of}} the magnetic field. Light at the resonant frequency of the vapor exits a FADOF near its original strength but with an orthogonal polarization.|$|E

5|$|Before the reform, in {{the north}} of the empire the Nuremberg {{standard}} had been in <b>effect,</b> <b>and</b> in Italy the local standards had been even lighter. It is not surprising that an increase by 17% and more met with some inertia. The 1770 edition of the pharmacopoeia Dispensatorium Austriaco-Viennense still used the Nuremberg standard libra medicinalis minor, indicating that even in the Austrian capital Vienna it took some time for the reform to become effective. In 1774, the Pharmacopoea Austriaco-provincialis used the new standard, and in 1783 all old apothecaries' weight pieces that were still in use were directed to be destroyed.|$|E
