The redemption fee and short-term trading fees are examples of other fees associated with mutual funds that do not exist with ETFs.

25|$|Most ETFs are {{index funds}} {{that attempt to}} {{replicate}} {{the performance of a}} specific index. Indexes may be based on stocks, bonds, commodities, or currencies. An index fund seeks to track the performance of an index by holding in its portfolio either the contents of the index or a representative sample of the securities in the index. As of June 2012, in the United States, about 1200 index ETFs exist, with about 50 actively managed ETFs. Index ETF assets are about $1.2 trillion, compared with about $7 billion for actively managed ETFs. Some index ETFs, known as leveraged ETFs or inverse ETFs, use investments in derivatives to seek a return that corresponds to a multiple of, or the inverse (opposite) of, the <b>daily</b> <b>performance</b> of the index.|$|E

A cross-sectional study was conducted on a representa-tive sample composed of 276 civil servants with ages ranging from 35 to 44 years. The Oral Impacts on <b>Daily</b> <b>Performances</b> index developed was employed to measure impacts caused by oral {{clinical conditions}}. Oral examinations were performed after the interviews. Multinomial Logistic Regression Analysis was used. After adjusting for sex and educational level, the results showed that the subjects with high DMFT scores were 5. 8 times (95 % CI = 2. 1 - 16. 1) more likely to have high impacts on their everyday life than those with low DMFT scores. Subjects that presented some coronal caries were 4. 3 times (95 % CI = 1. 9 - 9. 8) more likely to have high impacts on their everyday life than those with no coronal car-ies. Dental status assessed through the DMFT index and coronal caries are important indicators of impacts on the everyday life of the studied population...|$|R

40|$|Part 1 was {{published}} in Int. J. of Solar Energy, 8, (3), 1990 Input/output diagrams are very useful for evaluating the <b>daily</b> <b>performances</b> of solar collectors. We present a simple and accurate method to generate such diagrams for solar collection subsystems. The introduction of new dimensionless variables leads to a simplified and universal expression of I/O diagrams. The performances of the entire solar systems can then be evaluated by combining I/O diagrams to day by day simulations, which is very helpful in order to check existing installations or for design purposes. All these procedures are based on and validated by experiments, measurements and studies performed over many years. Now that we have described the main characteristics of a solar collection subsystem {{we are going to}} focus only on the solar collection subsystem as a whole, in order to analyse and evaluate by means of the G 3 -Model, its <b>daily</b> <b>performances...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Dental caries, dental {{pain and}} {{reported}} oral problems influence people's oral {{quality of life}} and thus their perceived need for dental care. So far there is scant information as to the psychosocial impacts of dental diseases and the perceived treatment need in child populations of sub-Saharan Africa. Objectives Focusing on primary school students in Kilwa, Tanzania, a district deprived of dental services and with low fluoride concentration in drinking water, this study aimed to assess the prevalence of dental pain and oral impacts on <b>daily</b> <b>performances</b> (OIDP), and to describe the distribution of OIDP by socio-demographics, dental caries, dental pain and reported oral problems. The relationship of perceived need estimates with OIDP was also investigated. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted in 2008. A total of 1745 students (mean age 13. 8 yr, sd = 1. 67) completed an extensive personal interview and under-went clinical examination. The impacts on <b>daily</b> <b>performances</b> were assessed using a Kiswahili version of the Child-OIDP instrument and caries experience was recorded using WHO (1997) criteria. Results A total of 36. 2 % (41. 3 % urban and 31. 4 % rural, p Conclusion Substantial proportions of students suffered from untreated dental caries, oral impacts on <b>daily</b> <b>performances</b> and perceived need for dental care. Dental pain and reported oral problems varied systematically with OIDP across the eight impacts considered. Eating and tooth cleaning problems discriminated between subjects who perceived need for dental treatment and those who did not. </p...|$|R
