Rowan Williams, Archbishop of Canterbury, stated that [...] " [...] will inevitably {{have a significant impact on}} the Anglican Communion throughout the world and it is too early to say what the result of that will be." [...] He added: [...] "t <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> the church in America and the rest of the Anglican Communion will have the opportunity to consider this development before significant and irrevocable decisions are made in response." [...] Desmond Tutu, Archbishop emeritus of Cape Town, stated that he did not see what [...] "all the fuss" [...] was about, saying the election would not roil the Church of the Province of Southern Africa. Other senior bishops of the church, like Peter Akinola, Archbishop of the Church of Nigeria and head of the Global South, have made Robinson a figurehead in their dispute with the Episcopal Church. Some disaffected Episcopalians have disaffiliated from the Episcopal Church and formed the Convocation of Anglicans in North America with the support of the Nigerian church.|$|E

[...] At the same time, a spokesperson for the New Democratic Party (the official opposition in the 41st Parliament), explained the party is in favour of the reforms.

It can be inferred that the majority in Madrid rallied {{to the side of the}} Republic, that uncontrolled elements roamed the capital that many rounds of gunfire were wasted out of nerves (July 29), that Nationalist propaganda was more effective (July 30) and that she understood early on that the war would be lost without foreign aid (August 24). On October 2 she wrote a revealing letter to her son in Russia, apologizing for not having written earlier and described the harrowing situation, [...] "You cannot even imagine, my son, how savage is the struggle going on in Spain now...Fighting is going on daily and round the clock.

The character and fortune of the fraternal enemies, the hall and shrubbery of Durrisdeer, the problem of Mackellar's homespun and how to shape it for superior flights; these were his company on deck in many star-reflecting harbours, ran often in his mind at sea {{to the tune of}} slatting canvas, and were dismissed (something of the suddenest) on the approach of squalls.

60|$|I {{now find}} myself {{inspired}} {{to make a}} second legend of Creative Evolution without distractions and embellishments. My sands are running out; the exuberance of 1901 has aged into the garrulity of 1930; and the war has been a stern intimation that the matter is not one to be trifled with. I abandon the legend of Don Juan with its erotic associations, {{and go back to}} the legend of the Garden of Eden. I exploit the eternal interest of the philosopher's stone which enables men to live for ever. I am not, I hope, under more illusion than is humanly inevitable as to the crudity of this my beginning of a Bible for Creative Evolution. I am doing the best I can at my age. My powers are waning; but so much the better for those who found me unbearably brilliant when I was in my prime. It <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> a hundred apter and more elegant parables by younger hands will soon leave mine as far behind as the religious pictures of the fifteenth century left behind the first attempts of the early Christians at iconography. In that hope I withdraw and ring up the curtain.|$|E
6000|$|I {{have stayed}} on in town later than {{for some years}} past, and though I had, {{at the end of}} March, all my plans made to go to Italy, have put it off till so late that, in a few days, I shall have to be content with simply {{crossing}} to Paris and seeing then what is to be further done. London is given up to carpenters and seat-mongers--being prepared, on an enormous scale and a rather unsightly way, for the [...] "circus" [...] of the 22nd. The circus is already, amid the bare benches and the mere bousculade of the preparations, a thing to fly from--in spite of the good young George Vanderbilt's having offered me an ample share of a beautiful balcony in Pall Mall to see it from. I shall spend the next few weeks in some place or places, north of the Alps, as yet utterly undefined, and be back in England before the summer is over. The voice of Venice, all this time, has called very loud. But it has been drowned a good deal in the click of the typewriter to which I dictate and which, some months ago, crept into my existence through the crevice of a lame hand and now occupies in it a place too big to be left vacant for long periods of hotel and railway life. All this time I am not coming to the great point, which <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> you may have been able to be present (I believe with all my heart of course you were) at the revelation of the Shaw Memorial. In charity, my dear Fanny, if this be the case, do write me a frank word about it. I heard from William and Alice more or less on the eve, but I fear they will have afterwards--just now be having--too much to do to be able to send me many echoes. I daresay that you will, for that matter, already have sent me one. I receive, as it happens, only this morning, a copy of Harper's Weekly with a big reproduction of St. Gaudens's bas-relief, which strikes me as extraordinarily beautiful and noble. How I rejoice that something really fine is to stand there forever for R. G. S.--and for all the rest of them. This thing of St. G.'s strikes me as a real perfection, and I have appealed to William to send me the finest and biggest photograph of it that can be found--for such surely have been taken. How your spiritual lungs must, over it all, have filled themselves with the air of the old wartime. Even here--I mean simply in the depths of one's own being--I myself, for an hour, seem to breathe it again. But the strange thing is that however much, in memory and imagination, it may live for one again, with all its dim figures and ghosts and reverberations and emotions, it appears to belong yet to some far away other world and state of being. I talked of this the other day with Sara Darwin, whose memories are so much identical with my own, and {{it was a relief to}} do so--in the absence of all other communications: that absence produced by the up-growth, since, of a whole generation, which began after the end and for which the whole history is as alien as the battles of Alexander. But I am writing you a long letter when I only meant to wave you a hand of greeting and gratitude. Correspondence is rather heavy to me, for I can tackle it only in the margin of time left over after the other matters that my machine has to grind. I hope your summer promises, and in the midst of a peculiar degree, at the present moment, of smoky London stuffiness, I envy you--for I see you in the mind's eye at Beverly--the element of wide verandahs, cut peaches--I mean peaches and cream, you know--white frocks and Atlantic airs. You make me, my dear Fanny, in these high lights, quite incredibly homesick.... Yours very constantly, ...|$|E
