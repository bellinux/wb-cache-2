500|$|In July 1977, on {{the final}} date at the Montreal Olympic Stadium, {{a small group of}} noisy and excited fans near the stage irritated Waters {{to such an extent that}} he spat at one of them. [...] He was not the only band member to feel disaffected at the show: guitarist David Gilmour refused to perform the band's usual encores ("Money" [...] and [...] "Us and Them"), leaving the band, with backup guitarist Snowy White, to improvise a slow, sad twelve-bar blues, which Waters {{described}} as [...] "some music to go home to". [...] Later that night, returning from hospital after an injury sustained to his foot while play-fighting backstage with manager Steve O'Rourke, Waters spoke with music producer Bob Ezrin, and a friend of Ezrin's, a psychiatrist sharing their car, about the feelings of alienation he was experiencing on the tour. He articulated his desire to isolate himself by constructing a wall across the stage between the performers and the audience. He later said, [...] "I loathed playing in stadiums ... I kept saying to people on that tour, 'I'm not really <b>enjoying</b> <b>this</b> ... there is something very wrong with this.'" [...] While Gilmour and Wright were in France recording solo albums, and Nick Mason was busy producing Steve Hillage's Green, Waters began to write new material. The spitting incident became the starting point for a new concept, which explored the protagonist's self-imposed isolation after years of traumatic interactions with authority figures and the loss of his father as a young child. To execute The Wall concept was to attempt to analyse the performer's psychological separation from the audience, using a physical structure as a metaphorical and theatrical device.|$|E
500|$|Performer Neal Medlyn re-enacted the DVD {{during his}} {{performance}} at the New Museum in April 2008 together with dancers Will Rawls and Erick Montes. His performance was one-hour long and it was titled The Neal Medlyn Experience Live. He sang along to the DVD audio track, complete with word-for-word between-song patter and band introductions. Booth Newspapers' Roger LeLeivre reviewed the re-enactment positively writing, [...] "The event... was a hoot, and the audience loved every second of it. Medlyn has Beyoncé's signature, often spastic, moves down pat, down to each minute hand gesture and facial expression... Unlike a drag show, Medlyn does not try to convince anyone they are seeing Beyoncé. There wasn't {{much in the way}} of costumes (well, he did enter in a black wig, tube top and hot pants, but those bit the dust rather quickly), and why bother?". He concluded that the length of the show was [...] "perfect" [...] as it [...] "ended before the shtick wore out its welcome". LeLeivre finished his review by writing, [...] "It was a delicious pop-culture skewering, right down to the back-up dancers, with their over-the-top moves and expressions... Clearly it enhanced the 'experience,' if you had a passing acquaintance with Beyoncé's songs... but such knowledge was not a prerequisite to <b>enjoying</b> <b>this</b> homage". Claudia La Rocco of The New York Times described his re-enactment as [...] "absurdly faithful" [...] and added that it wouldn't have been nearly as [...] "smart or touching" [...] without the dancing of Rawls and Montes. She further put the performance in her list of the [...] "richest" [...] moments of 2008 and noted, [...] "These astounding performers slipped between genders and among genres, enveloping Mr. Medlyn in utter fabulousness and proving just how sophisticated pop culture can be. Backup dancers everywhere should feel proud." ...|$|E

His place {{was taken by the}} young and then unknown Canadian Gilles Villeneuve, whom Amon would, later that year, recommend to Enzo Ferrari.|$|E

The answer should be obvious' That could mean the Universe is an unimaginably large space full of a diversity of life and cultures – in the memorable words of Carl Sagan, there are billions and billions of planets like Earth.” He concluded by saying: “Everyday I remind myself of where I am and how we are part of this incredible hum and vibrancy of life.
