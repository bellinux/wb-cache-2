40|$|Massive gas {{injection}} (MGI) is a promising technique for reducing tokamak wall damage during disruptions, with reductions observed in both conducted wall heat loads and in halo currents, {{when compared with}} unmitigated disruptions [1]. It is unknown at present if MGI can prevent the formation and amplification of runaway electrons (RE) in future high-current tokamaks, so RE formation during MGI remains an outstanding concern. To avoid RE during MGI shutdowns, efficient delivery of injected impurities into the plasma core is desirable. This is because complete collisional suppression of RE amplification is predicted to occur at very large total (free+bound) electron densities (ncrit 1016 cm- 3 in DIII-D). To achieve a rapid gas delivery rate, a flange holding six fast-acting gas valves was installed. With all six valves fired simultaneously, up to 1000 torr-l of argon could be delivered to the plasma edge in a pulse about 3 ms long. Previous (2005 and 2006) MGI experiments have suggested that rapid gas delivery rate is crucial for achieving large core impurity densities; this was confirmed in the present experiments. Schematics of MGI valves used {{in the last three}} years are shown in Fig. 1. In 2005, a single low-flow valve was used; this delivered about 1000 torr-l of argon to the plasma edge in a pulse about 15 ms long. In 2006, a single large-flow valve was used; this delivered about 10, 000 torr-l of argon in a pulse about 10 ms long.

Experiments were conducted using sand of mean particle size 507 mum. Water was injected into the sand through a tube of semicircular cross-section (internal diameter 0. 55 cm) located at the wall of the tank, forming a half jet. At sufficiently high flowrate a U-shaped fluidized region formed around the <b>jet</b> <b>tube.</b> The fluidized zone was characterized by measuring scour depth, diameter of the fluidized region at the jet insertion depth and diameter of the fluidized region at half the jet insertion depth. For a fixed jet insertion depth, increasing the jet velocity increased the scour depth, the diameter of the fluidized region at the jet insertion depth, and the diameter at half the jet insertion depth. For a fixed jet velocity, the scour depth was independent of the insertion depth, however the two diameters of the fluidized region decreased with increasing jet insertion depth. The profiles obtained for inclined jets were more asymmetric than those for vertical jets. The effectiveness of the 'up-flow washing' technique for the removal of a water-soluble contaminant (CuSO 4) from a saturated bed of sand was investigated for a vertical jet at jet velocities of 213 cm/s and 320 cm/s and jet insertion depths of 5. 5 cm and 7. 5 cm. Up-flow washing removed the contaminant from the sand bed. The cleaned region extended well beyond the boundary of the fluidized region as jet liquid leaked from the fluidized region and percolated through the fixed bed region.

Swirl flow is achieved with twisted tape inserts having twist ratios of 2, 3. 2, 4. 5 and 7. 5. Twisted tape inserts resulted asymmetric flame. The flame shape is found to be highly influencing the heat transfer from the flame jet to the target surface. Better heat transfer distribution is achieved with stoichiometric mixture.

40|$|A {{study was}} made of the means by which {{turbulent}} flows entrain sediment grains from alluvial stream beds. Entrainment was considered to include both the initiation of sediment motion and the suspension of grains by the flow. Observations of grain motion induced by turbulent flows led to the formulation of an entrainment hypothesis. It was based on the concept of turbulent eddies disrupting the viscous sublayer and impinging directly onto the grain surface. It is suggested that entrainment results from the interaction between fluid elements within an eddy and the sediment grains. A pulsating jet was used to simulate the flow conditions in a turbulent boundary layer. Evidence is presented to establish the validity of this representation. Experiments were made to determine the dependence of jet strength, defined below, upon sediment and fluid properties. For a given sediment and fluid, and fixed jet geometry there were two critical values of jet strength: one at which grains started to roll across the bed, and one at which grains were projected up from the bed. The jet strength K, {{is a function of the}} pulse frequency, ω, and the pulse amplitude, A, defined by K = Aω -s Where s is the slope of a plot of log A against log ω. Pulse amplitude is equal to the volume of fluid ejected at each pulse divided by the cross sectional area of the <b>jet</b> <b>tube.</b> Dimensional analysis was used to determine the parameters by which the data from the experiments could be correlated. Based on this, a method was devised for computing the pulse amplitude and frequency necessary either to move or project grains from the bed for any specified fluid and sediment combination. Experiments made in a laboratory flume with a turbulent flow over a sediment bed are described. Dye injection was used to show the presence, in a turbulent boundary layer, of two important aspects of the pulsating jet model and the impinging eddy hypothesis. These were the intermittent nature of the sublayer and the presence of velocities with vertical components adjacent to the sediment bed. A discussion of flow conditions, and the resultant grain motion, that occurred over sediment beds of different form is given. The observed effects of the sediment and fluid interaction are explained, in each case, in terms of the entrainment hypothesis. The study does not suggest that the proposed entrainment mechanism is the only one by which grains can be entrained. However, in the writer’s opinion, the evidence presented strongly suggests that the impingement of turbulent eddies onto a sediment bed plays a dominant role in the process. ...|$|R

Ninety patients with unstable cervical spine disorders (ASA I-III) with general anaesthesia were included and randomly assigned to three groups, based on the device used for intubation: lightwand only, lightwand under direct laryngoscopy, lightwand with WEI JET under direct laryngoscopy. No statistically significant differences were detected among three groups with respect to demographic characteristics and C/L grade. There were statistically significant differences between three groups for overall intubation success rate (p = 0. 015) and first attempt success rate (p = 0. 000). The intubation time was significantly longer in the WEI group (110. 8 ± 18. 3 s) than in the LW group (63. 3 ± 27. 5 s, p = 0. 000) and DL group (66. 7 ± 29. 4 s, p = 0. 000), but the lowest SpO 2 in WEI group was significantly higher than other two groups (p< 0. 01). The WEI JET significantly reduced successful tracheal intubation attempts compared to the LW group (p = 0. 043). The severity of sore throat was similar in three groups (p = 0. 185). The combined use of WEI JET under direct laryngoscopy helps to assist tracheal intubation and improves oxygenation during intubation in patients with difficult airway secondary to unstable spine disorders.

40|$|When {{a liquid}} film falls from one tube to another below it, the flow {{can take the}} form of {{discrete}} droplets, individual jets or a continuous sheet. Experiments exploring the effects of thermophysical properties and geometrical parameters on the droplet and jet flow patterns are described. Measurements of droplet and jet departure-site spacing are reported for several fluids over a wide range of liquid flow rates, tube sizes and tube spacing. For the conditions of this study, departure-site spacing increased with decreasing Re for high-Ga fluids and was nearly independent of Re for low-Ga fluids. Departure-site spacing increased slightly with tube diameter for small tubes and was nearly independent of tube size for large tubes. Departure-site spacing was nearly independent of tube spacing for the entire range of experiments; however, a relation between jet shape, <b>jet</b> spacing and <b>tube</b> spacing was observed under some conditions. A qualitative study of liquid-jet shapes shows that this flow feature depends strongly on tube spacing, and comparisons to existing models suggest that further work in this area is needed...|$|R
