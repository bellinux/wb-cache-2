40|$|A linfadenectomia laparoscópica é realizada de forma rotineira na medicina, contudo é pouco utilizada na veterinária. Neste relato, um canino fêmea apresentando tumores na cadeia mamária esquerda (M 4 e M 5), foi submetido à aplicação intradérmica do azul de metileno estéril, ao redor do maior tumor (M 5), buscando-se demarcação dos vasos linfáticos e linfonodos regionais. Após 15 minutos, iniciou-se a linfadenectomia {{abdominal}} videolaparoscópica na região inguinal esquerda, seguida da ovário-histerectomia (OVH) lapararoscópica com três portais. Realizou-se ainda mastectomia total unilateral esquerda. Pela histologia, obtiveram-se dois linfonodos abdominais livres de células tumorais. A paciente não apresentou recidiva em 60 dias. The {{laparoscopic lymphadenectomy}} is routinely performed in medicine, {{but not in}} veterinary medicine. This report describes a case of female canine with tumors in the left mammary chain (M 4 and M 5), which was subjected to <b>intra-dermal</b> <b>application</b> of sterile methylene blue, around the largest tumor (M 5) which tried to demarcate the lymphatic vessels and regional lymph nodes. After 15 minutes, laparoscopic lymphadenectomy involving the abdominal in the left pelvic region started, followed by laparoscopic ovariohysterctomy (OVH) using three portals access. It was also performed an unilateral left total mastectomy. For histology, two abdominal lymph nodes were free of tumor cells. The patient had no recurrence in 60 days...|$|E
40|$|Of the 110 dentists who had {{presented}} seroconversion 50 {{days after the}} intradermal application of three 2 µg doses of the Belgian recombinant vaccine against hepatitis B (HB), administered eight years before at an interval of one month between the 1 st and 2 nd doses and of five months between the 2 nd and 3 rd doses, 51 were included {{for the assessment of}} the persistence of immunity. None of the dentists had hepatitis or had received HB vaccine during this period. All subjects were submitted to serological tests for the detection of the following markers of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection: HBsAg, anti-HBc, HBeAg, anti-HBe, and anti-HBs, with no HBsAg, anti-HBc, HBeAg or anti-HBe being detected. A microparticle enzyme immunoassay (MEIA) revealed the presence of anti-HBs at protective titers (> 10 mIU/ml) in 42 dentists (82. 4 %), with the anti-HBs titer being higher than 100 mIU/ml in 36 of them (70. 6 %) (good responders), between 10 and 100 mIU/ml in 6 (11. 8 %) (poor responders), and lower than 10 mIU/ml in 9 (17. 6 %) (non-responders). According to clinical data and serological tests, none of the dentists {{had presented}} disease or latent HBV infection during the eight years following the first vaccination. A 2 µg booster dose was administered intradermally to eight dentists with anti-HBs titers lower than 10 mIU/ml (non-responders) and to six dentists with titers ranging from 10 to 100 mIU/ml (poor responders); the determination of anti-HBs one month later demonstrated the occurrence of seroconversion in the eight non-responders and an increase in anti-HBs titer in the six poor responders. In summary, the present results demonstrated the prolonged persistence of protection against HBV infection and the development of immunologic memory provided by vaccination against HB - with <b>intra-dermal</b> <b>application</b> of three 2 µg doses of the Belgian recombinant vaccine at 0, 1, and 6 months - carried out eight years before in 51 dentists...|$|E
