In this paper, we present {{a new approach to}} perform coordinated activation and reporting (CAR) for energy-efficient target monitoring (detection, tracking, and reporting) in WSNs. Our approach aims to minimize the responsetime by activating sensors (from sleep-mode) that are along the target’s path, and then forwarding the <b>information</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>reported</b> to the base-station from these sensors along the same coordinated path. If we are unable to meet the response-time deadline using a coordinated path, we split the tracking path and the reporting path in to independent paths, so that the base-station is reported within the response-time deadline. We perform extensive simulations on different sample target-paths, and compute average response-time and network lifetime for each scenario. We also investigate the problem of optimal base-station placement, so as to improve the average response-time in the network...|$|E

AOD is the leading provider of private label organic milk to retailers throughout the U. S., and operates five farms in Colorado and Texas as well as processing plant in Colorado. This study built on the life-cycle analysis (LCA) research conducted in the first and second phases to develop a prototype for the company???s first Corporate Sustainability Report (CSR). The study also updated select data for another year of performance reporting covering the company???s energy, greenhouse gas (GHG) and water use from April 2009 through May 2010. The research team worked with senior management to assess the company???s stakeholders and sustainability goals and determine relevant reporting metrics. The prototype reporting framework was development based on a review of published CSRs, literature on CSR reporting best practices and consultation from industry experts. The final prototype leverages previous LCA studies and current year data updates to provide recommended quantitative and qualitative <b>information</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>reported</b> in AOD???s publicly released CSR. The prototype links ongoing operational metrics to corporate sustainability goals, values and internal governance and accountability efforts to create a broad view of sustainability impacts and activities across the entire company.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this Guideline is to {{document}} CRC recommendations {{for the development of}} study Case Report Forms (CRFs). When properly designed and constructed, the CRF will minimize data collection and data entry errors, simplify database development and maximize the overall quality of data collected. Definitions Case Report Forms are the research instruments or tools designed to collect the data that are necessary to answer the research questions of a specific protocol. The Good Clinical Practice (GCP) standard developed by the International Conference on Harmonization, defines Case Report Form (CRF) as „the printed, optical or electronic document designed to record all of the protocol required <b>information</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>reported</b> to the sponsor on each trial subject. ‟ Traditionally, CRFs are hard copy paper documents completed by trained research study staff. The data recorded on the CRFs are subsequently data entered into a study database. In the circumstances of electronic CRFs (eCRF), data may be directly entered into a study database through electronic CRF screens that mimic the hard copy CRF method. This approach is referred to as electronic data capture (EDC). Even in an EDC environment, hard copy CRFs, are required to be developed in order to serve as the blue print for database development. Generally, data recorded on a CRF include basic subject-specific sociodemographic information such as birth date, ethnicity, race, education level; data from study specific examinations, measurements or specialty tests; data abstracted from the subject‟s medical record or other source documents such as ambulatory and in-patient records, laboratory results, other tests and special procedures.

In analyzing DOD's reports, GAO found that DOD addressed 18 of the 26 elements, partially addressed 3 elements and did not report on 5 elements. For the elements partially addressed [...] personnel stability, training operations tempo, and deployed equipment [...] reporting was incomplete because some services reported information and others did not report. When all the services reported on an element, they at times did so inconsistently, with varying amounts and types of information.

The services reported differently because DOD has not provided guidance on the <b>information</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>reported.</b> For the elements that DOD did not address, including borrowed manpower and training funding, GAO found that information may exist in the department but is not being reported to Congress.

However, DOD has not taken steps to analyze whether this information could be used to meet the related reporting element.

Initially, DOD provided general direction through emails, briefings, and training, which gave the military departments and SOCOM flexibility to selectively report on the initiatives that they believed were important, resulting in inconsistencies. For example, prior to February 2013, all but the Navy had chosen to report on all their initiatives. In February 2013, the DOD Comptroller issued written guidance that specified the type of <b>information</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>reported,</b> including 1) whether original net savings projections are being met, and 2) any associated program or milestone risks. In instances where original net savings projects were not met or risks were identified, the guidance required further detail such as how implementation would be achieved. As a result, in their March 2013 reports, the military departments and SOCOM only reported details on those initiatives that were not achieving original net savings estimates or where risk had been identified. GAO observed, during this review, that information on all initiatives was now unavailable to DOD decision makers, thus hindering their ability to assess implementation progress across the full range of initiatives. Comptroller officials agreed that such information would enhance DOD's oversight, and in October 2013, the DOD Comptroller issued updated guidance, directing that this information also be reported on initiatives on track to achieve savings or not experiencing risk. The military departments and SOCOM subsequently began submitting reports with this broader set of information. ...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} quality of {{reported}} consent processes of cluster-randomised trials conducted in residential facilities for older people and to explore whether the focus on improving the general conduct and reporting of cluster-randomised trials influenced {{the quality of}} conduct and reporting of ethical processes in these trials. Design: Systematic review of cluster-randomised trials reports, published {{up to the end}} of 2010. Data sources: National Library of Medicine (Medline) via PubMed, hand-searches of BMJ, Journal of the American Medical Association, BMC Health Services Research, Age and Ageing and Journal of the American Geriatrics Society, reference search in Web of Knowledge and consultation with experts. Eligibility for selecting studies: Published cluster-randomised trials where the unit of randomisation is a part or the whole of a residential facility for older people, without language or year of publication restrictions. Results: We included 73 trials. Authors reported ethical approval in 59, obtaining individual consent in 51, and using proxies for this consent in 37, but the process to assess residents’ capacity to consent was clearly reported in only eight. We rated only six trials high for the quality of consent processes. We considered that individual informed consent could have been waived legitimately in 14 of 22 trials not reporting obtaining consent. The proportions reporting ethical approval and quality of consent processes were higher in recent trials.
