5|$|Electrical {{generators}} and alternators are frequently used as portable welding power supplies, {{but because of}} lower efficiency and greater costs, they are less frequently used in industry. Maintenance also {{tends to be more}} difficult, because of the complexities of using a combustion engine as a power source. However, in one sense they are simpler: the use of a separate rectifier is unnecessary because they can provide either AC or DC. However, the <b>engine</b> <b>driven</b> units are most practical in field work where the welding often must be done out of doors and in locations where transformer type welders are not usable because there is no power source available to be transformed.|$|E

25|$|The SR.N1 was {{powered by}} a single piston <b>engine,</b> <b>driven</b> by {{expelled}} air. Demonstrated at the Farnborough Airshow in 1960, it was shown that this simple craft could carry a load of up to 12 marines with their equipment {{as well as the}} pilot and co-pilot with only a slight reduction in hover height proportional to the load carried. The SR.N1 did not have any skirt, using instead the peripheral air principle that Christopher had patented. It was later found that the craft's hover height was improved by the addition of a skirt of flexible fabric or rubber around the hovering surface to contain the air. The skirt was an independent invention made by a Royal Navy officer, C.H. Latimer-Needham, who sold his idea to Westland (by then the parent of Saunders-Roe's helicopter and hovercraft interests), and who worked with Christopher to develop the idea further.|$|E

500|$|Eleven days later, {{thousands}} of mourners watched as Dibnah's coffin (on top of which his trademark flat cap was placed) was towed through {{the centre of}} Bolton by his restored traction <b>engine,</b> <b>driven</b> by his son. [...] A cortège of steam-powered vehicles followed, as the procession {{made its way to}} Bolton Parish Church. [...] During the hour-long service, David Hall told the congregation [...] "He wasn't a posh TV presenter. [...] He was recognised as a working man who had learned through experience." [...] Following the service, led by the Vicar of Bolton—Canon Michael Williams (a friend of Dibnah)—he was buried at Tonge Cemetery, behind his home.|$|E

2500|$|Unlike the Schneider patent design, Saulnier's {{device was}} {{actually}} built, {{and may be}} considered the first practical [...] synchronization gear to be tested. For {{the first time the}} cam producing the to-and-fro movement conveying firing impulses to the gun is situated at the <b>engine,</b> (<b>driven</b> in this case by the same spindle that operated the oil pump and the tachometer) and the impulses themselves are transmitted by a reciprocating rod rather than Schneider's rotating shaft. The idea of literally [...] "interrupting" [...] the firing of the gun gives way (probably as the result of experience) to the principle of pulling the trigger for each successive shot, like the action of a semi-automatic weapon.|$|E
2500|$|Buxhall Mill {{was built}} by William Bear, the Sudbury {{millwright}} {{at a cost of}} £506 6s 9d. The lower three storeys formed the base of a smock mill which stood on the site previously. The mill was worked by wind until [...] November 1929 when the sails were damaged in a storm. The swing-pot neck bearing was removed and sold to John Bryant of Pakenham mill. It was eventually installed in that mill in 1950 by Amos Clarke, the Ipswich millwright. In the 1940s Buxhall mill was stripped of its millstones and refitted as an <b>engine</b> <b>driven</b> mill, in which form it worked until 1971. The mill had lost its cap by 1971, with the cap frame remaining {{on the top of the}} tower.|$|E
2500|$|The 12A engine {{has a long}} thin shaped {{combustion}} chamber, {{having a}} large surface area in relation to its volume. Therefore, combustion is cool, giving few oxides of nitrogen. However, the combustion is also incomplete, so there are large amounts of partly burned hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide. The exhaust is hot enough for combustion of these to continue into the exhaust. An <b>engine</b> <b>driven</b> pump supplies air into the exhaust to complete the burn of these chemicals. This {{is done in the}} [...] "thermal reactor" [...] chamber where the exhaust manifold would normally be on a conventional engine. Under certain conditions the pump injects air into the thermal reactor and at other times air is pumped through injectors into the exhaust ports. This fresh air is needed for more efficient and cleaner burning of the air/fuel mixture.|$|E

2500|$|Since its {{introduction}} the AW119 Koala {{has developed a}} reputation as one of the safest helicopters in its class. Nicknamed [...] "Volvo of light helicopters" [...] by operators and technicians, it has proven a forgiving platform when exposed to extreme conditions and operational tempos. The AW119 incorporates a level of system redundancy unparalleled in its class; a few examples being: duel hydraulic pumps driven directly by its main rotor transmission on opposite sides, two separate stability augmentation systems, electronic engine control system coupled with a direct throttle control linkage to fuel metering unit and mechanical governor allowing for a MANUAL mode, two fuel tank boost pumps in addition to <b>engine</b> <b>driven</b> fuel pump, two heading GMU sensors, two independent VHF systems available, and primary and secondary GPS sources. A high-inertia rotor system coupled with a robust box structure and separated fuel bladder tank setup has contributed greatly to crash survivability.|$|E
2500|$|The Belphégor had {{its origins}} during World War II in Marcel Roca's SNCAC NC.3020 design, an {{ultimately}} unbuilt aircraft {{powered by a}} coupled pair of Hispano-Suiza HS.12Z engines mounted {{side by side in}} the nose driving coaxial propellers. [...] When work on the design resumed at the war's end these engines were replaced with a similarly arranged Daimler-Benz pair, resulting in a revised type, the NC.3021. The Belphégor was intended to provide a high altitude laboratory for studies of the meteorology of the upper atmosphere, high altitude aerodynamics and also of incoming cosmic rays. The measurements were to be made at altitudes between [...] and [...] [...] The pressurization system was fed from a large scoop intake below the engine into <b>engine</b> <b>driven</b> compressors. The pressurized cabin, slightly wider than high had an average diameter of about [...] allowing the two observers comfortable working room and a total cabin volume of [...] They had observation windows in the cabin roof and in its floor. The crew positions were also in the pressurized region: the pilot's cockpit placed his head above the upper fuselage under a clear canopy. Two other crew, navigator and radio operator sat wholly within the cabin.|$|E
2500|$|Sometimes {{referred}} to as the 196 engine, this engine was originally designed by Nash and introduced in the 1941 Nash Ambassador 600 model. It featured only four main bearings, unlike the 7-main-bearing 234 flathead engine it replaced. It was a flathead design displacing [...] It was later enlarged to , and finally to [...] It was redesigned as an OHV engine in 1956. The flathead version was discontinued for 1956–1957, but reemerged in 1958 as the economy engine for the [...] "new" [...] Rambler American. When the engine was changed to an OHV configuration the water pump was moved from {{the left side of the}} <b>engine</b> (<b>driven</b> by a shaft extending from the back of the generator) to the front above the timing chain. When the flathead model was reintroduced it also received the new water pump. Equipped with such high quality parts as forged crankshafts and connecting rods, these engines earned a reputation for remarkable durability. The flathead, however, was prone to the typical flathead problem of overheating under sustained heavy load. This was from the hot exhaust traveling through the cylinder block to the exhaust manifold.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This {{paper is}} to review the {{research}} trend of Hybrid Electronic Vehicle (HEV) and present a novel design of a HEV based on programmable logic controller (PLC). Since a hybrid vehicle can be at one of five status: Pure Electric <b>Drive,</b> Pure <b>Engine</b> <b>Drive,</b> Parallel <b>Drive,</b> <b>Engine</b> <b>Drive</b> and Electric Power Generation, and Brake for Energy Feedback, this paper presents a design of a HEV controlled by PLC which is to optimize the energy flow according to the vehicle status and the AC permanent magnet synchronous motor. This research is based on anovel design on the transmission system including dual-clutch, transmission control box and planet-gear structure. Switching between the five statuses is automatically controlled by a PLC using {{the information from the}} transducers...|$|R
