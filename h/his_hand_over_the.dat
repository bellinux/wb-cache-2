25|$|Still the Saints {{were just}} {{trailing}} 10-3 {{near the end}} of the third quarter, and had a great chance to tie the game when defensive tackle Renaldo Turnbull blocked Butler's 45-yard field goal attempt. New Orleans defensive end Vince Buck recovered the ball and returned it 62 yards for a potential touchdown, only to see the play wiped out by an offsides penalty on teammate Robert Massey, who had lined up with <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> neutral zone. The penalty not only eliminated the score, but it also gave Chicago a first down, and seven plays later, Butler kicked a 25-yard field goal to put them up 13-3.|$|E

500|$|To {{decide who}} would become the monarch, six of them decided on a test, with Otanes abstaining, as he had no {{interest}} in being king. They were to gather outside the palace, mounted on their horses at sunrise, and the man whose horse neighed first in recognition of the rising sun would become king. According to Herodotus, Darius had a slave, Oebares, who rubbed <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> genitals of a mare that Darius favored. When the six gathered, Oebares placed his hands beside the nostrils of Darius's horse, who became excited at the scent and neighed. This was followed by lightning and thunder, leading the others to dismount and kneel before Darius in recognition of his apparent divine providence. In this account, Darius himself favored that he achieved the throne not through fraud, but cunning, even erecting a statue of himself mounted on his neighing horse with the inscription: [...] "Darius, son of Hystaspes, obtained the sovereignty of Persia by the sagacity of his horse and the ingenious contrivance of Oebares, his groom." ...|$|E

2500|$|Lawrence rewrote many of {{his novels}} several times to perfect them and {{similarly}} he returned {{to some of his}} early poems when they were collected in 1928. This was in part to fictionalise them, but also to remove some of the artifice of his first works. As he put in himself: [...] "A young man is afraid of his demon and puts <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> demon's mouth sometimes and speaks for him." [...] His best-known poems are probably those dealing with nature such as those in the collection Birds, Beasts and Flowers, including the Tortoise poems, and [...] "Snake", one of his most frequently anthologised, displays some of his most frequent concerns: those of man's modern distance from nature and subtle hints at religious themes.|$|E
2500|$|A bowler {{releases}} a normal fast delivery with the wrist locked in {{position and the}} first two fingers positioned {{on top of the}} cricket ball, giving it spin about a horizontal axis perpendicular to the length of the pitch. For a leg cutter, a right-handed bowler pulls his fingers down {{the left side of the}} ball (from his viewpoint), rolling the ball out of <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> little finger, in an action similar to bowling a leg break, only at higher speed. This changes the axis of spin to make it more like a leg break, which makes the ball deviate to the left when it bounces on the pitch. From a right-handed batsman's point of view, this deviation is to the right, or from the leg side towards the off side. This deviation is known as cut, and the delivery is called a leg cutter because it moves away from the leg side.|$|E
2500|$|Franklin chose an allegorical {{scene from}} Exodus, {{described}} in his notes as [...] "Moses {{standing on the}} Shore, and extending <b>his</b> <b>Hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Sea, thereby causing the same to overwhelm Pharaoh who is sitting in an open Chariot, a Crown on his Head and a Sword in his Hand.

[...] Jefferson suggested a depiction of the Children of Israel in the wilderness, led by a cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night for {{the front of the}} seal; and Hengest and Horsa, the two brothers who were the legendary leaders of the first Anglo-Saxon settlers in Britain, for the reverse side of the seal.
