5|$|When unoccupied, the {{children}} tended {{to their own}} needs and played with toy marbles and hobby horses. Some learned to count by playing <b>hide</b> <b>and</b> <b>seek.</b> Play was primarily for inculcating virtuous traits like courage and loyalty, but it also made life more tolerable. Black and white children played together {{before the age of}} ten, but separated afterwards based on the demands of work. Children often helped the adults, and performed chores (like fetching wood or water) that quickly escalated into full work responsibilities.|$|E
5|$|After construction, Morris invited {{friends to}} visit, most notably Burne-Jones {{and his wife}} Georgiana, as well as Rossetti and his wife Lizzie Siddal. They aided him in {{painting}} murals on the furniture, walls, and ceilings, much of it based on Arthurian tales, the Trojan War, and Geoffrey Chaucer's stories, while he also designed floral embroideries for the rooms. They also spent much time playing tricks on each other, enjoying games like <b>hide</b> <b>and</b> <b>seek,</b> and singing while accompanied by the piano. Siddall stayed at the House during summer and autumn 1861 as she recovered from a traumatic miscarriage and an addiction to laudanum; she would die of an overdose in February 1862.|$|E
5|$|The Joker forces Batman {{into a game}} of <b>hide</b> <b>and</b> <b>seek,</b> {{giving him}} one hour to escape Arkham before his adversaries are sent to hunt him down. Although Batman {{initially}} refuses, he accepts the challenge after the Joker shoots a prison guard {{in the head and}} then threatens to kill Adams. However, unbeknownst to Batman, the Joker shortens the time from one hour to ten minutes after being pressured by the other inmates. Batman subsequently encounters Clayface, Mad Hatter, the Scarecrow, and Maxie Zeus, among other villains. During a struggle with Killer Croc, Batman is thrown out of a window, grabbing onto the statue of the angel Michael. Clutching the statue's bronze spear, Batman climbs back inside and impales Croc before throwing him out the window, sustaining a severe wound from the spear in the process.|$|E

25|$|Most reef fishes have body {{shapes that}} are {{different}} from open water fishes. Open water fish are usually built for speed in the open sea, streamlined like torpedoes to minimise friction as they move through the water. Reef fish are operating in the relatively confined spaces and complex underwater landscapes of coral reefs. For this manoeuvrability {{is more important than}} straight line speed, so coral reef fish have developed bodies which optimize their ability to dart and change direction. They outwit predators by dodging into fissures in the reef or playing <b>hide</b> <b>and</b> <b>seek</b> around coral heads.|$|E

He was there the night it burned down, having a drink with a friend, Aengus Gibson, also known as 'Black Aengus'. Heir to the Gibson brewing business, Aengus was a wild drunk {{at the time of the}} fire, but has since reformed.

It is a covered approach or saungdan as in most Burmese pagodas with frescoes under the roof. Between the rows of stone-inscription stupas grow mature star flower trees (Mimusops elengi) that emanate a jasmine-like fragrance to the entire complex. Burmese families may be seen having a picnic in the cool shade under these trees, picking the flowers to make star flower chains for the Buddha or to wear in their hair, or the children playing <b>hide</b> <b>and</b> <b>seek</b> among the rows of stupas.

500|$|Equipment {{varies with}} the game. Board games, such as Go, Monopoly or backgammon need a board and markers. One of the oldest known board games is Senet, a game played in Ancient Egypt, enjoyed by the pharaoh Tutankhamun. [...] Card games, such as whist, poker and Bridge have long been played as evening {{entertainment}} among friends. For these games, {{all that is needed}} is a deck of playing cards. Other games, such as bingo, played with numerous strangers, have been organised to involve the participation of non-players via gambling. Many are geared for children, and can be played outdoors, including hopscotch, <b>hide</b> <b>and</b> <b>seek,</b> or Blind man's bluff. The list of ball games is quite extensive. It includes, for example, croquet, lawn bowling and paintball as well as many sports using various forms of balls. The options cater {{to a wide range of}} skill and fitness levels. Physical games can develop agility and competence in motor skills. Number games such as Sudoku and puzzle games like the Rubik's cube can develop mental prowess.|$|E

500|$|Nathan Cocks of PC PowerPlay complained {{the need}} for {{secondary}} weapons proves frustrating: [...] "It {{is not uncommon to}} run out of the weapons needed for the job, forcing the player to engage in a tedious game of <b>hide</b> <b>and</b> <b>seek</b> as they scour the map in the hopes of finding another cache." [...] He wrote: [...] "In fact, tedium is a frequent bedfellow in Cannon Fodder 3", {{due to the lack of}} variety in the gameplay and mission objectives. He felt the player's vehicles to be of limited effectiveness as is the ability to split the squad. Cocks complained of the game's [...] "bargain basement production" [...] ruining the tone of the game due to low quality translations and voice acting, as well as numerous bugs causing problems with running the game, crashes, spawning and using vehicles. The reviewer acknowledged the [...] "wonderfully cartoony" [...] graphics, found the gory windscreen wipers [...] "amusing" [...] and wrote [...] "It’s all over-the-top explosive goodness and contributes a great deal to what little appeal is present." [...] Cocks summarised: [...] "Cannon Fodder 3 is the ultimate coat-tail rider [...] perhaps there is some nostalgic pleasure to be taken in this but for the most part, we suggest leaving well enough alone." ...|$|E

40|$|Conflicts of {{interest}} between {{the community and}} its members are {{at the core of}} human social dilemmas. If observed selfishness has future costs, individuals may hide selfish acts but display altruistic ones, and peers aim at identifying the most selfish persons to avoid them as future social partners. An interaction involving <b>hiding</b> <b>and</b> <b>seeking</b> information may be inevitable. We staged an experimental social-dilemma game in which actors could pay to conceal information about their contribution, giving, and punishing decisions from an observer who selects her future social partners from the actors. The observer could pay to conceal her observation of the actors. We found sophisticated dynamic strategies on either side. Actors hide their severe punishment and low contributions but display high contributions. Observers select high contributors as social partners; remarkably, punishment behavior seems irrelevant for qualifying as a social partner. That actors nonetheless pay to conceal their severe punishment adds a further puzzle to the role of punishment in human social behavior. Competition between <b>hiding</b> <b>and</b> <b>seeking</b> information about social behavior may be even more relevant and elaborate in the real world but usually is hidden from our eyes...|$|R

500|$|In addition, Bramshill House {{was cited}} by the {{historian}} William Page as a possible location for the Legend of the Mistletoe Bough, a ghost story associated with several English country mansions. This legend tells of a bride who supposedly hid in a wooden chest during a game of <b>hide</b> <b>and</b> <b>seek</b> on her wedding night. In the case of Bramshill House, the story has it that this happened at Christmas time, and that the bride was found fifty years later still wearing her wedding dress and with a sprig of mistletoe in her hand; the chest is {{on display in the}} entrance hall. The woman is sometimes identified as John Cope's daughter Anne, who married Hugh Bethell of Yorkshire. An alternative claim is that she was Genevre Orsini, who was married in 1727, and that her ghost came to Bramshill from Italy together with the chest. In his monograph on the house, the Victorian writer Sir William Cope preferred this theory and added that the chest on display was not the original, which had been proved large enough by [...] "a woman of comely proportions" [...] who had tested it by lying down in it, but which had been taken away by Sir Denzil Cope's widow in 1812. The ghost of the bride {{is referred to as the}} White Lady, and she is said by Legg to haunt the Fleur de Lys room. According to Legg, Michael I of Romania asked to be moved to another room during a stay there, in order to not be disturbed by the young woman in white who passed through his bedroom every night. An old man with a grey beard, thought by Legg to be the father or husband of the White Lady, is reported to stare through windows and at the Mistletoe Chest.|$|E

50|$|How does {{perspective}} taking occur {{according to}} Mead? It {{has been argued}} that social acts (such as games and routine forms of social interaction) enable perspective taking through 'position exchange'. Assuming that games and routine social acts have differentiated social positions, and that these positions create our cognitive perspectives, then it might be that by moving between roles in a game (e.g. between <b>hiding</b> <b>and</b> <b>seeking</b> or buying <b>and</b> selling) we come to learn about the perspective of the other. This new interpretation of Mead's account of taking the perspective of the other has experimental support.|$|R
50|$|There are {{two teams}} that {{alternate}} between <b>hiding</b> <b>and</b> <b>seeking.</b> One team <b>hides</b> <b>and</b> has about {{one to two}} minutes {{to hide in the}} proximity of the base.

Each hider that successfully gets to the base without being tagged scores one point. Once a hider is tagged, they are out of the round and must return to the base without scoring a point. No players in the base can assist any other players in hiding. Players can hide in groups or individually. The round is played until all hiders return to the base safe or not. The team with the most safe players {{at the end of the}} session wins.|$|R
