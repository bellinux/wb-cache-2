In this period {{he got into the}} habit of frequent reading, developed an interest in theatre, and started singing lessons. After graduating from high school in April 1942 he was drafted into the German Arbeitsdienst. After basic training in Pirmasens, Germany, he was assigned to a unit in Quelern <b>en</b> <b>Bas,</b> near Brest (France). Feyerabend described the work he did during that period as monotonous: [...] "we moved around in the countryside, dug ditches, and filled them up again." [...] After a short leave he joined the army and volunteered for officer school. In his autobiography he writes that he hoped the war would be over {{by the time he had}} finished his education as an officer. This turned out not to be the case. From December 1943 on, he served as an officer on the northern part of the Eastern Front, was decorated with an Iron cross, and attained the rank of lieutenant. When the German army started its retreat from the advancing Red Army, Feyerabend was hit by three bullets while directing traffic. One bullet hit him in the spine. As a consequence he needed to walk with a stick for the rest of his life and frequently experienced severe pain. He spent the rest of the war recovering from his wounds.|$|E

40|$|The BA constructions ("SNO-subject +BA + SN 1 -object + SV" {{in medieval}} and modern Chinese (8 th- 16 th centuries) are not {{subjected}} {{to any of}} the fundamental constraints which regulate the same constructions in contemporary Chinese. Particularly, there is no constraint according to which the verb cannot be at the final position and must be followed by another constituent. The earliest BA forms are final verb forms, and several of these verbs are even monosyllabic, not being preceded by adverbials. It is therefore impossible that the surface structure condition of Huang Shuan-fan (1984) could explain the origin and the development of accusative markers BA. The BA constructions come from serial verbs constructions "V 1 BA + O + V 2 ", where the object (O) {{is at the same time}} object of V 1 and V 2. This structure itself comes synchronically from "V 1 BA + 01 + V 2 + 02 " by deleting the second object (02), when this latter is identical to the first (01). The verb BA's full meaning has been then taken away, and, through a grammaticalization process, a preposition has taken place to introduce pre-verbal objects. This diachronic derivation ("V 1 BA + 0 + V 2 " > "PREP BA + 0 + V") occurred between the 7 th and the 8 th centuries. Peyraube Alain.

40|$|The {{disposal}} form {{is probably}} the most studied construction so far, either in synchrony or in diachrony. However, the problem of the origin of this form is still debated. The classical hypothesis on the origin of the disposal form is the following: В A (mainly jiang and ba) were verbs in Archaic Chinese; used in V 1 position in serial verb constructions of the type "VI + О + V 2 " since early medieval, they were grammaticalized and became prepositions some time between the 7 th and 9 th centuries. This classical analysis has been challenged recently in several ways. First of ally jiang and ba could come directly from yi - through an analogous process - by a single lexical replacement, without it being necessary to speak of any grammaticalization. The disposal forms could also come from subject-patient sentences to which one could add jiang or ba. This paper discusses these new hypotheses and concludes: 1) that the hypothesis of an analogous phenomenon with yi, which might have served as a model to jiang and ba, is worth maintaining; 2) that the hypothesis whereby the disposal sentences could have come from patient-subject sentences to which a jiang or ba word has been added is not motivated; 3) that one can reasonably suppose that the two joint processes of analogy (with yi forms) and grammaticalization (V > Prep.) did {{play a role in the}} appearance and development of disposal forms.

40|$|Se calcularon las tasas de mortalidad y reclutamiento de árboles en una parcela permanente de investigación de un bosque pluvial tropical. El estudio se basó en dos mediciones, una realizada en el año 1998 y la otra en el 2005, en las cuales se midió el diámetro (DAP) a todos los árboles con DAP> 10 cm y se censaron los individuos muertos y reclutados. Se determinaron los tipos de mortalidad y se calculó el coeficiente de mortalidad, el coeficiente de reclutamiento exponencial, la biomasa aérea (BA) y la vida media del bosque. En el primer censo se registraron 709 individuos y en el segundo se encontraron 710. La tasa media anual de mortalidad de árboles fue 1, 39 % y el coeficiente de mortalidad exponencial fue 1, 41 %; los tipos de mortalidad más comunes fueron: volcamiento de raíz y muerte en pie. La tasa de reclutamiento anual fue 1, 2 % y el coeficiente de reclutamiento exponencial registró 1, 19 %. La vida media estimada de la parcela fue 58, 6 años. La BA fue de 237, 31 t ha- 1 en el año 1998, y en el 2005 fue 259, 9 t ha- 1.

We also determined the type {{of mortality}}, the mortality and exponential recruitment coefficient, the aboveground biomass (AB) and the mean life of the forest. In the first census 709 individuals were recorded and 710 in the second one. The mean annual mortality rate of trees was 1. 39 % and the exponential mortality coefficient was 1. 41 %; the most common types of mortality were uprooting and snags. Annual recruitment rate was 1. 2 % and the exponential rate of recruitment was 1. 19 %. Mean life of this forest was estimated in 58. 6 years. The AB was of 237. 31 t ha- 1 in the year 1998, and in the 2005 was of 259. 9 t ha- 1. The recruited individuals presented AB of 5. 08 t ha- 1, and the deads of 17. 72 t ha- 1; the increment of AB in survivors was 30. 97 t ha- 1 average.

6000|$|I {{must now}} desire leave to say {{something}} to a gentleman, who has been pleased to publish a discourse against a paper of mine relating to the convocation.[10] He promises to set me right, without any undue reflections or undecent language. I suppose he means in comparison with others, who pretend to answer the [...] "Examiner": So far he is right; but if he thinks he has behaved himself as becomes a candid antagonist, I believe he is mistaken. He says, in his title-page, my [...] "representations are unfair, and my reflections unjust." [...] And his conclusion is yet more severe,[11] where he [...] "doubts I and my friends are enraged against the Dutch, because they preserved us from Popery and arbitrary power at the Revolution; and since that time, from being overrun by the exorbitant power of France, and becoming a prey to the Pretender." [...] Because this author seems in general to write with an honest meaning, I would seriously put to him the question, whether he thinks I and my friends are for Popery, arbitrary power, France and the Pretender? I omit other instances of smaller moment, which however do not suit in my opinion with due reflection or decent language. The fact relating to the convocation, came from a good hand, and I do not find this author differs from me in any material circumstance about it. My reflections were no more than what might be obvious to any other gentleman, who had heard of their late proceedings. If the notion be right which this author gives us of a Lower House of Convocation, it is a very melancholy one,[12] and to me seems utterly inconsistent with that of a body of men whom he owns to have a negative; and therefore, since a great majority of the clergy differs from him in several points he advances, I shall rather choose to be of their opinion than his. I fancy, when the whole synod met in one house, as this writer affirms, they were upon a better foot with their bishops, and therefore whether this treatment so extremely de haut <b>en</b> <b>bas,</b> since their exclusion, be suitable to primitive custom or primitive humility towards brethren, is not my business to enquire. One may allow the divine or apostolic right of Episcopacy, and their great superiority over presbyters, and yet dispute the methods of exercising the latter, which being of human institution, are subject to encroachments and usurpations. I know, every clergyman in a diocese has a good deal of dependence upon his bishop, and owes him canonical obedience: but I was apt to think, when the whole representative of the clergy met in a synod, they were considered in another light, at least since they are allowed to have a negative. If I am mistaken, I desire to be excused, as talking out of my trade: only there is one thing wherein I entirely differ from this author. Since in the disputes about privileges, one side must recede; where so very few privileges remain, it is a hundred to one odds, the encroachments are not on the inferior clergy's side; and no man can blame them for insisting on the small number that is left. There is one fact wherein I must take occasion to set this author right; that the person who first moved the QUEEN to remit the first-fruits and tenths to the clergy, was an eminent instrument in the late turn of affairs;[13] and as I am told, has lately prevailed to have the same favour granted for the clergy of Ireland.[14] ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{has not had}} {{respect and}} trust enough {{for the men and}} women of whom he writes; and is too much {{inclined}} to laugh at them, and treat them de haut <b>en</b> <b>bas.</b> He has trusted too much to his own great power of logical analysis, and his equally great power of illustration, and is therefore apt to mistake the being able to put a man's thoughts into words for him, for the being really able to understand him. To understand any man we must have sympathy for him, even affection. No intellectual acuteness, no amount even of mere pity for his errors, will enable us to see the man from within, and put our own souls into the place of his soul. To do that, one must feel and confess within oneself the seed of the same errors which one reproves in him; one must have passed more or less through his temptations, doubts, hunger of heart and brain; and one cannot help questioning, as one reads Mr. Vaughan's book, whether he has really done this in the case of those of whom he writes. He should have remembered too how little any young man can have experienced of the terrible sorrows which branded into the hearts of these old devotees the truths to which they clung more than to life, while they too often warped their hearts into morbidity, and caused alike their folly and their wisdom. Gently indeed should we speak even of the dreams of some self-imagined [...] "Bride of Christ," [...] when we picture to ourselves the bitter agonies which must have been endured ere a human soul could develop so fantastically diseased a growth. [...] "She was only a hysterical nun." [...] Well, and what more tragical object, to those who will look patiently and lovingly at human nature, than a hysterical nun? She may have been driven into a convent by some disappointment in love. And has not disappointed affection been confessed, in all climes and ages, to enshroud its victim ever after in a sanctuary of reverent pity? If sorrow [...] "broke her brains," [...] as well as broke her heart, shall we do aught but love her the more for her capacity of love? Or she may have entered the convent, as thousands did, in girlish simplicity, to escape from a world she had not tried, before she had discovered that the world could give her something which the convent could not. What more tragical than her discovery in herself of a capacity for love which could never be satisfied within that prison? And when that capacity began to vindicate itself in strange forms of disease, seemingly to her supernatural, often agonising, often degrading, and at the same time (strange contradiction) mixed itself up with her noblest thoughts, to ennoble them still more, and inspire her not only with a desire of physical self-torture, which would seem holy both in her own eyes and her priest's, but with a love for all that is fair and lofty, for self-devotion and self-sacrifice--shall we blame her--shall we even smile at her if, after the dreadful question: [...] "Is this the possession of a demon?" [...] had alternated with, [...] "Is this the inspiration of a god?" [...] she settled down, as the only escape from madness and suicide, into the latter thought and believed that she found in the ideal and perfect manhood of One whom she was told to revere and love as a God, and who had sacrificed His own life for her, a substitute for that merely human affection from which she was for ever debarred? Why blame her for not numbering that which was wanting, or making straight that which was crooked? Let God judge her, not we: and the fit critics of her conduct are not the easy gentlemanlike scholars, like Mr. Vaughan's Athertons and Gowers, discussing the [...] "aberrations of fanaticism" [...] over wine and walnuts; or the gay girl, Kate; hardly even the happy mother, Mrs. Atherton; but those whose hairs are gray with sorrow; who have been softened at once and hardened in the fire of God; who have cried out of the bottomless deep like David, while lover and friend were hid away from them, and laid amid the corpses of their dead hopes, dead health, dead joy, as on a ghastly battle-field, [...] "stript among the dead, like those who are wounded, and cut away from God's hands;" [...] who have struggled drowning in the horrible mire of doubt, and have felt all God's billows and waves sweep over them, till they were weary of crying, and their sight failed for waiting so long upon God; and all the faith and prayer which was left was [...] "Thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, nor suffer thy Holy One to see corruption." [...] Be it understood, however, for fear of any mistake, that we hold Mr. Vaughan to be simply and altogether right in his main idea. His one test for all these people, and all which they said or did, is--Were they made practically better men and women thereby? He sees clearly that the [...] "spiritual" [...] is none other than the [...] "moral"--that which has to do with right and wrong; and he has a righteous contempt for everything and anything, however graceful and reverent, and artistic and devout, and celestial and super-celestial, except in as far as he finds it making better men and women do better work at every-day life.|$|E

[Aside to TOM FASHION.] Faith, sir, we had better let the postboy take the portmanteau and pay himself. Fash. [Aside to LORY.] Why, sure, there's something left in it! Lory. Not a rag, upon my honour, sir! We eat the last of your wardrobe at New Malton--and, if we had had twenty miles further to go, our next meal must have been of the cloak-bag. Fash. Why, 'sdeath, it appears full! Lory. Yes, sir--I made bold to stuff it with hay, to save appearances, and look like baggage. Fash. [Aside.] What the devil shall I do?--[Aloud.] Hark'ee, boy, what's the chaise? Post. Thirteen shillings, please your honour. Fash. Can you give me change for a guinea? Post. Oh, yes, sir. Lory. [Aside.] So, what will he do now?--[Aloud.] Lord, sir, you had better let the boy be paid below. Fash. Why, as you say, Lory, I {{believe it will be}} as well. Lory. Yes, yes, I'll tell them to discharge you below, honest friend. Post. Please your honour, there are the turnpikes too. Fash. Ay, ay, the turnpikes by all means. Post. And I hope your honour will order me something for myself. Fash. To be sure; bid them give you a crown. Lory. Yes, yes--my master doesn't care what you charge them--so get along, you-- Post. And there's the ostler, your honour. Lory. Psha! damn the ostler!--would you impose upon the gentleman's generosity?--[Pushes him out.] A rascal, to be so cursed ready with his change! Fash. Why, faith, Lory, he had nearly posed me. Lory. Well, sir, we are arrived at Scarborough, not worth a guinea! I hope you'll own yourself a happy man--you have outlived all your cares. Fash. How so, sir? Lory. Why, you have nothing left to take care of. Fash. Yes, sirrah, I have myself and you to take care of still. Lory. Sir, if you could prevail with somebody else to do that for you, I fancy we might both fare the better for it. But now, sir, for my Lord Foppington, your elder brother. Fash. Damn my eldest brother. Lory. With all my heart; but get him to redeem your annuity, however. Look you, sir; you must wheedle him, or you must starve. Fash. Look you, sir; I would neither wheedle him, nor starve. Lory. Why, what will you do, then? Fash. Cut his throat, or get someone to do it for me. Lory. Gad so, sir, I'm glad to find I was not so well acquainted with the strength of your conscience as with the weakness of your purse. Fash. Why, art thou so impenetrable a blockhead as to believe he'll help me with a farthing? Lory. Not if you treat him de haut <b>en</b> <b>bas,</b> as you used to do. Fash. Why, how wouldst have me treat him? Lory. Like a trout--tickle him. Fash. I can't flatter. Lory. Can you starve? Fash. Yes. Lory. I can't. Good by t'ye, sir. Fash. Stay--thou'lt distract me. But who comes here? My old friend, Colonel Townly. Enter COLONEL TOWNLY. My dear Colonel, I am rejoiced to meet you here. Col. Town. Dear Tom, this is an unexpected pleasure! What, are you come to Scarborough to be present at your brother's wedding? Lory. Ah, sir, if it had been his funeral, we should have come with pleasure. Col. Town. What, honest Lory, are you with your master still? Lory. Yes, sir; I have been starving with him ever since I saw your honour last. Fash. Why, Lory is an attached rogue; there's no getting rid of him. Lory. True, sir, as my master says, there's no seducing me from his service.--[Aside.] Till he's able to pay me my wages. Fash. Go, go, sir, {{and take care of the}} baggage. Lory. Yes, sir, the baggage!--O Lord! [Takes up the portmanteau.] I suppose, sir, I must charge the landlord to be very particular where he stows this? Fash. Get along, you rascal.--[Exit LORY with the portmanteau.] But, Colonel, are you acquainted with my proposed sister-in-law? Col. Town. Only by character. Her father, Sir Tunbelly Clumsy, lives within a quarter of a mile of this place, in a lonely old house, which nobody comes near. She never goes abroad, nor sees company at home; to prevent all misfortunes, she has her breeding within doors; the parson of the parish teaches her to play upon the dulcimer, the clerk to sing, her nurse to dress, and her father to dance;--in short, nobody has free admission there but our old acquaintance, Mother Coupler, who has procured your brother this match, and is, I believe, a distant relation of Sir Tunbelly's. Fash. But is her fortune so considerable? Col. Town. Three thousand a year, and a good sum of money, independent of her father, beside. Fash. 'Sdeath! that my old acquaintance, Dame Coupler, could not have thought of me, as well as my brother, for such a prize. Col. Town. Egad, I wouldn't swear that you are too late-- his lordship, I know, hasn't yet seen the lady--and, I believe, has quarrelled with his patroness. Fash. My dear Colonel, what an idea have you started! Col. Town. Pursue it, if you can, and I promise you shall have my assistance; for, besides my natural contempt for his lordship, I have at present the enmity of a rival towards him. Fash. What, has he been addressing your old flame, the widow Berinthia? Col. Town. Faith, Tom, I am at present most whimsically circumstanced. I came here a month ago to meet the lady you mention; but she failing in her promise, I, partly from pique and partly from idleness, have been diverting my chagrin by offering up incense to the beauties of Amanda, our friend Loveless's wife. Fash. I never have seen her, but have heard her spoken of as a youthful wonder of beauty and prudence. Col. Town. She is so indeed; and, Loveless being too careless and insensible of the treasure he possesses, my lodging in the same house has given me a thousand opportunities of making my assiduities acceptable; so that, in less than a fortnight, I began to bear my disappointment from the widow with the most Christian resignation. Fash. And Berinthia has never appeared? Col. Town. Oh, there's the perplexity! for, just as I began not to care whether I ever saw her again or not, last night she arrived. Fash. And instantly resumed her empire. Col. Town. No, faith--we met--but, the lady not condescending to give me any serious reasons for having fooled me for a month, I left her in a huff. Fash. Well, well, I'll answer for it she'll soon resume her power, especially as friendship will prevent your pursuing the other too far.--But my coxcomb of a brother is an admirer of Amanda's too, is he? Col. Town. Yes, and I believe is most heartily despised by her. But come with me, and you shall see her and your old friend Loveless. Fash. I must pay my respects to his lordship--perhaps you can direct me to his lodgings. Col. Town. Come with me; I shall pass by it. Fash. I wish you could pay this visit for me, or could tell me what I should say to him. Col. Town. Say nothing to him--apply yourself to his bag, his sword, his feather, his snuff-box; and when you are well with them, desire him to lend you a thousand pounds, and I'll engage you prosper. Fash. 'Sdeath and furies! why was that coxcomb thrust into the world before me? O Fortune, Fortune, thou art a jilt, by Gad! [Exeunt.|$|E

This thesis project aims to explore the possibility of using regression forests to nd bounding boxes for general subcortical structures. This is an important preprocessing step for later implementations of full segmentation, to improve the accuracy, and also to reduce the time consumption. An algorithm suggested by Criminisi et al. is implemented and extended to MR images. The extension also includes using a greater pool of used feature types. The obtained results are very good, with an average Jaccard similarity coecient as high as 0. 696, and center mean error distance as low as 3. 14 mm. The algorithm is very fast, and is able to predict the location of 43 bounding boxes within 14 seconds. These results indicate that regression forests are well suited as the method of choice for preprocessing before a full segmentation. Manuell segmentering av riskorgan i MR-bilder är en väldigt tidskrävande uppgift för läkare. Att kunna automatisera denna process vore därför av stor nytta.

According to the mica content, three perografic facies have been distinguished in the Mont&# 225;nchez granite. Facies 1, {{is made up of}} medium to coarse grained, two mica granites richer in muscovite, which occupy the northern half of the granite and have been extremely deformed. Facies II, consiting of coarse to very coarse grained, sometimes porphyrblastic, two-mica granites, richer in biotite, has not been deformed, or very little. Facies III is made up of aplitic muscovite granties which are poor in biotite and rich in tourmaline. The Mont&# 225;nchez granite frecuently contains tonalitic xenolith, sometimes quitee large. Regarding the geochemistry of the Mont&# 225;nchez granite the major and some trace elements have been analyzed on 22 samples belonging to the three different facies and the tonalitic xenoliths. As for the major elements, the chemical-mineralogical parameters of la Roche, the binary diagrams of Harker, Larsen, la Roche and Deban and Le Fort, and the ternary diagrams Na 2 O, K 2 O, CaO, Na 2 O+K 2 O, Al 2 O 3, CaO and AFM have been calculted. They indicate that these granties are made up alkaline rocks richer in Na than K, poor in Ca, and with a markedly peraluminous character. Concerning the distribution of the trace elements in the Mont&# 225;nchez granite the average conten in Rb, Ba, Sr, Zr and Nb lower and those in Sn and Zn higher, than the values reported by different autors for several world granites considered to be standard. El macizo gran&# 237;tico de Mont&# 225;nchez (C&# 225;ceres, Espa&# 241;a) est&# 225; situado al SE del granito de Albal&# 225;, del que le separa una banda fuertemente tectonizada. De acuerdo con su contenido en micas se han distinguido en &# 233;l tres facies petrogr&# 225;ficas. Facies 1, formada por grantios de dos micas, con moscovita dominante, ocupa la parte norte del macizo; es una facies muy deformada y con tama&# 241;o de grano medio a grueso. La facies Il, poco o nada deformada, est&# 225; constituida por granitos de dos micas, con biotita dominante, y tiene grano grueso a muy grueso, a veces porfiroide. La facies III est&# 225; formada por granitos moscov&# 237;ticos de car&# 225;cter apl&# 237;tico, con escasa biotita y abundante turmalina. Adem&# 225;s, el granito de Mont&# 225;nchez presenta frecuentemente enclaves de tipo tonal&# 237;tico, algunas veces de tama&# 241;o considerable. Por lo que se refiere a los caracteres geoqu&# 237;micos, se han analizado los elementos mayores y trazas en 22 muestras pertenecientes a las tres facies del granito y a los enclaves tonal&# 237;ticos.

40|$|Mesozoic basic {{magmatism}} in the External Zones of the Betic Cordilleras (S. Spain) {{is represented by}} small tectonic bodies (ophites) in Triassic formations, and submarine flows with abundant pillow-lavas interbedded with Jurassic sediments. Both basic igneous manifestations suffered very low- to low-grade metamorphism, more intense {{in the case of}} the ophites. Two types of ophites are distinguished on the basis of their primary mineralogy. In the first type, orthopyroxene is present in the less differentiated products. Clinopyroxene and Ca-plagioclase are the main primary phases and quartz appears in the more evolved rocks. In the second type, olivine is present in the less differentiated products. Ti-rich augite and Ca-plagioclase are also important primary minerals, but quartz is absent. Whole-rock chemistry (major and trace elements, including REE) also allows us to discriminate between these two groups. The first group has higher SiO 2, and lower TiO 2, P 2 O 5 and lower Na 2 O/K 2 O ratios than the second. Normative quartz is almost invariably present in this first group, whereas normative nepheline (lower than 5 %) is characteristic of the second group. Both groups are Sr, K, Ba, Rb, Th, Nb and Ce enriched with respect to normal MORB, but the first group has higher K, Rb, Ba, Th and lower Nb, Ce contents than the alkaline group. Nb/Y and Ti/V ratios are also different and show a tholeiitic affinity for the first group and transitional to alkaline for the second. Chondrite-normalised REE patterns in both groups are similar and characterized by LREE enrichment with respect to HREE. LREE/HREE ratios are, however, slightly higher in the transitional to alkaline group. Various discriminant tectonic diagrams indicate a continental intraplate setting for both ophite groups. This magmatism is related to the first extensional period of the Betic Cordilleras, during the Triassic-Jurassic. Geochemical differences between the two groups could evidence different degrees of crustal contamination, and/or different mantle sources. Trace element ratios [(La/Ce) n &# 226;&# 137;&# 187; 1, La/Nb &# 226;&# 137;&# 186; 1. 5] for both magmatism are indicative of an enriched mantle source. Differences in Th/Yb, Zr/Nb, Zr/Y and Ba/Zr ratios underline the greater influence of a lithospheric component {{in the case of the}} Triassic magmatism. El magmatismo b&# 225;sico mesozoico en las Zonas Externas de las Cordilleras B&# 233;ticas (S. Espa&# 241;a) esta representado por peque&# 241;os bloques tect&# 243;nicos (ofitas) en las formaciones tri&# 225;sicas, y coladas submarinas, con abundantes pillow-lavas intercaladas en los sedimentos jur&# 225;sicos. Ambos tipos de manifestaciones &# 237;gneas sufrieron transformaciones metam&# 243;rficas en condiciones de grado bajo a muy bajo, mas intensas en el caso de las ofitas. Sobre la base de la mineralog&# 237;a primaria se han distinguido dos tipos de ofitas. En el primer tipo, aparece ortopiroxeno en los t&# 233;rminos menos diferenciados, siendo los clino- piroxenos y plagioclasas c&# 225;lcicas las principales fases minerales, con presencia de cuarzo en las rocas mas evolucionadas. En el segundo tipo, el olivino esta presente en los t&# 233;rminos menos diferenciados, siendo tambi&# 233;n los clinopiroxenos (tipo augita rica en Ti) y las plagioclasas c&# 225;lcicas las fases minerales mas importantes, aunque no existe cuarzo en las rocas mas diferenciadas. Los datos de geoqu&# 237;mica de roca total (elementos mayores y trazas, incluyendo tierras raras) tambi&# 233;n permiten discriminar entre estos dos grupos. El primero presenta mayores valores de SiO 2 y menores contenidos de TiO 2, P 2 O 5, as&# 237; como menores relaciones Na 2 O/K 2 O que el segundo. El primer grupo presenta casi sistem&# 225;ticamente cuarzo normativo, mientras que el segundo se caracteriza por la presencia de nefelina normativa &# 194;&# 171; 5 %). Ambos grupos est&# 225;n enriquecidos <b>en</b> Sr, K, <b>Ba,</b> Rb, Th, Nb y Ce con respecto a los N-MORB, pero el primer grupo tiene mayores contenidos <b>en</b> K, Rb, <b>Ba</b> y Th y menores valores en Nb y Ce que el segundo. Las relaciones Nb/Y y T/V tambi&# 233;n son diferentes entre los dos grupos, indicando una afinidad tole&# 237;tica para el primer grupo y transicional- alcalina para el segundo. Los diagramas de tierras raras normalizados a condritos son similares en los dos grupos, y est&# 225;n caracterizados por un enriquecimiento en tierras raras ligeras con respecto alas pesadas, aunque con relaciones ligeramente mas altas en el grupo transicional-alcalino. El uso de varios diagramas de discriminaci&# 243;n tect&# 243;nica indican un contexto de g&# 233;nesis de intraplaca continental para ambos grupos. Este magmatismo esta relacionado con los primeros episodios distensivos de las Cordilleras B&# 233;ticas durante el Tri&# 225;sico-Jur&# 225;sico. Las diferencias geoqu&# 237;micas entre los dos grupos podr&# 237;an indicar distintos grados de contaminaci&# 243;n cortical y/o diferente fuente mant&# 233;lica. Las relaciones entre elementos traza [(La/Ce) n &# 226;&# 137;&# 187; 1, La/Nb &# 226;&# 137;&# 186; 1. 5] en ambos magmatismos son indicativas de una fuente mant&# 233;lica enriquecida. Las diferencias observadas en las relaciones Th/Yb, Zr/Nb, Zr/Y y Ba/Zr ponen de manifiesto la mayor influencia de un componente litosf&# 233;rico en el caso del magmatismo tri&# 225;sico...|$|R
40|$|The {{nation state}} has over time become the natural locus for {{democracy}} and consequently also legitimate governance. Both concepts have been developed within the nation state and are therefore considered closely connected to it. Nation states are, however, not the only actor on the international arena anymore. The European integration {{is an example of}} a new actor, where nation states have started collaborating. Similar to nation states, EU has decision-making authorities and must therefore attain legitimacy. The thesis questions how legitimacy can be treated within an entity such as the EU. Three different ways of attaining legitimacy are brought up. The first perceives EU as legitimate in its current design with an intergovernmental part and a regulatory part. The intergovernmental part is claimed to be legitimised through democracy from the member states, and the regulatory part is legitimised through non-majoritarian democracy. Non-majoritarian democracy implies decision-making by independent institutions, which relies on expertise and fairness. The second part emphasises the need to enhance democracy for the EU to become legitimate. The EU is considered too similar to a nation state to make do with lesser standards of legitimacy than a liberal democratic nation state. Deliberative democracy could bring legitimacy through creating a dimension where citizens become oriented towards what can be perceived or acknowledged as the “common good” through active participation in deliberative processes. Federalism is brought up as another alternative that would possibly permit for democracy to be practiced in the EU. Legitimacy is claimed to be achieved through sustaining values such as mutual respect, reciprocity, compromise and toleration, values that are connected to a commitment to working for the “common good”. The purpose of this essay is to describe different aspects on the concept “legitimacy” in the EU context and to show how it is achieved and/or how it can possibly be achieved in a future union of nation states. The purpose is not to arrive at a solution, or even to construe a common ground, but to construe a limited insight on how “legitimacy” in the EU can be treated according to theorists/theories. Nationalsstaten har kommit att bli den naturliga platsen för demokrati och legitimt styre. En trolig förklaring till detta är att båda koncepten har utvecklats inom nationsstaten och anses därför vara starkt sammankopplade med den. Nationalsstater är dock inte längre den enda aktören på den internationella arenan. Den Europeiska integrationen är ett exempel på en ny företeelse, ett forum/sammanhang där nationalsstater har börjat sammarbeta. Som med nationsstater har EU beslutsfattande befogenheter och måste därför uppnå legitimitet. Uppsatsen ifrågasätter hur legitimitet kan behandlas inom en enhet såsom EU. Tre olika sätt att uppnå legitimitet tas upp. Det första uppfattar EU som legitimt i sitt nuvarande utförande med en mellanstatlig del och en reglerande. Den mellanstatliga delen skulle kunna legitimeras genom medlemsstaternas demokrati, och den reglerande delen legitimeras genom ”icke-majoritets demokrati”. ”Icke majoritets demokrati” innebär beslutsfattande av självständiga instutitioner, som förlitar sig på experter och rättvisa som värdegrund. Den andra delen framhåller behovet av att öka demokrati för att ska bli EU legitimt. Enligt detta synsätt är EU alltför likt en nationsstat för att klara sig med en lägre standard av legitimitet än en liberaldemokratisk nationsstat. Deliberativ demokrati skulle kunna bringa legitimitet genom att tillföra en dimension där medborgare, genom aktivt deltagain i deliberativa processer, blir orienterade mot lösningar som uppfattas och erkänns som ”allmänt goda”. Federalism tas upp som ytterligare ett alternativ. Legitimitet anses kunna uppnås genom upprätthållandet av värden såsom gemensam respekt, ömsesidighet, kompromisser and tålamod. Värden som är kopplade till åtagandet att sträva mot ”det allmäna goda”. Syftet med den här uppsatsen är att beskriva olika aspekter av legitimitetsbegreppet i EU och att visa på hur legitimitet uppnås eller kan uppnås i en framtida union av nationalstater. Uppsatsen gör varken anspråk på att tillhandahålla klara lösningar eller ens att föreslå <b>en</b> gemensam <b>bas</b> av möjliga sådana, men att erbjuda läsaren en begränsad insikt i hur legitimitet behandlas utifrån några teoretiska perspektiv, och av några teoretiker...|$|R
