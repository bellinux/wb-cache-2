We propose that in drylands, the dynamics of ecosystem state change are determined by changes in the type (stabilizing vs amplifying) and strength of ecohydrological feedbacks following a change in <b>exogenous</b> <b>forces.</b> Using a selection of five case studies from drylands, we explore the characteristics of ecohydrological feedbacks and resulting dynamics of ecosystem state change. We surmise that stabilizing feedbacks are critical for the provision of plant-essential resources in drylands. <b>Exogenous</b> <b>forces</b> that break these stabilizing feedbacks can alter the state of the system, although such changes are potentially reversible if strong amplifying ecohydrological feedbacks do not develop. The case studies indicate that if amplifying ecohydrological feedbacks do develop, they are typically associated with abiotic processes such as runoff, erosion (by wind and water), and fire.

However this estimate has {{not been}} directly deduced from studies of terrestrial ecosystems themselves, but inferred from atmospheric and oceanic data. This raises a question: {{to what extent is}} the terrestrial carbon cycle intrinsically predictable? In this paper, we investigated fundamental properties of the terrestrial carbon cycle, examined its intrinsic predictability, and proposed a suite of future research directions to improve empirical understanding and model predictive ability. Specifically, we isolated endogenous internal processes of the terrestrial carbon cycle from <b>exogenous</b> <b>forcing</b> variables. The internal processes share five fundamental properties (i. e., compartmentalization, carbon input through photosynthesis, partitioning among pools, donor pool-dominant transfers, and the first-order decay) among all types of ecosystems on the Earth. The five properties together result in an emergent constraint on predictability of various carbon cycle components in response to five classes of <b>exogenous</b> <b>forcing.</b> Future observational and experimental research should be focused on those less predictive components while modeling research needs to improve model predictive ability for those highly predictive components. We argue that an understanding of predictability should provide guidance on future observational, experimental and modeling research. 15 page(s...|$|R

Fluctuations in financial market prices are sometimes driven by endogenous forces and sometimes by <b>exogenous</b> <b>forces.</b> Business news is a typical example of <b>exogenous</b> <b>forces.</b> Casual observation indicates that stock prices respond to news articles reporting on new developments concerning companies’ circumstances. Market reactions to news have been extensively studied by researchers in several different fields [1 – 14], with some researchers attempting to construct models that capture static and/or dynamic responses to endogenous and exogenous shocks [15, 16]. The starting point for neoclassical financial economists typically is what they refer to as the ‘efficient market hypothesis,’ which implies that stock prices respond at the very moment that news is delivered to market participants. A number of empirical studies have attempted to identify such an immediate price response to news but have found little evidence supporting the efficient market hypothesis [17 – 22].|$|E

I conducted an extensive literature review and document analysis, coupled with in-depth interviews with the Romanian bureaucratic education elite who influenced the country's education reforms.

Two central questions drove my research: (1) What factors impacted Romania's transition from a totalitarian regime toward democracy?

Given the estimated values of these parameters, our analytic results accurately predict a definitive set of statistics characterizing the AS topology structure. These statistics are not parts of model formulation. The MA model thus closes the “measure-model-validate-predict ” loop. We develop our model in stages adding increasing detail characterizing dynamic interaction between Internet ecosystem players. We validate each stage using recent results in Internet topology data analysis. We describe the emergence of ASs, peering links formation, bankruptcies and multihoming.

It is demonstrated that these changes do not follow the general patterns of policy change identified within previous research. Rather than as an institutional continuity through reproductive adaptation or abrupt disruptive change caused by exogenous pressures, regime change in the examined cases has a different character which combines these elements.

In the first stage of our two-step methodology, we find statistically stable long-run elasticities of domestic activity and relative price to be about 1. 5 and - 0. 5 over the sample period of estimation. In the second stage, we use the parameter estimates from the first stage and estimate the Euler equation. These empirical estimates imply that adjustment costs are about 9 to 13 times more important than disequilibrium costs. In sum, we find surprisingly encouraging evidence supporting the view that the LQ model is not inconsistent with the dynamic behaviour of Canadian aggregate imports. ...|$|R
