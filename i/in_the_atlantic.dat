5|$|An Atlantic {{hurricane}} or {{tropical storm}} is a tropical cyclone that forms <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Ocean, {{usually in the}} summer or fall. A hurricane differs from a cyclone or typhoon only {{on the basis of}} location. A hurricane is a storm that occurs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Ocean and northeastern Pacific Ocean, a typhoon occurs in the northwestern Pacific Ocean, and a cyclone occurs in the south Pacific or Indian Ocean.|$|E

5|$|The 1941 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season was the period during 1941 in which tropical cyclones formed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Basin. It {{was a relatively}} inactive {{hurricane season}}, with only six known storms. It officially began on June 16, 1941, and lasted until November 1, 1941. These dates delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones tend to form <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic</b> basin. Of the six cyclones, four attained hurricane status, and three became major hurricanes. The active season had an abnormally late start; the first system formed on September 11, nearly {{three months after the}} official beginning date. The season was also short-lived, as all six storms developed in rapid succession. On September 23, three hurricanes existed simultaneously <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic</b> basin.|$|E

5|$|An {{off-season}} Atlantic hurricane is {{a recorded}} tropical or subtropical cyclone that existed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic</b> basin {{outside of the}} official Atlantic hurricane season. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration currently defines the season as occurring between June 1 and November 30 each calendar year, which is when 97% of all Atlantic tropical cyclones occur. Peak activity {{is known to be}} between August and October. In the off-season, storms are most likely to occur in May, with approximately 60% of such storms occurring during that month. Occasionally, however, storms develop in or persist until December. As of , there have been 81 off-season cyclones <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic</b> hurricane database, which began in 1851. In addition, there were six storms before 1851, and one hurricane in 1863 that {{is not part of the}} official database.|$|E

At least 1,023deaths were attributed to Hurricane Janet, as well as $65.8million in damages.

Their data indicates that during the past thirty years, the peak intensity of these storms has shifted poleward in both hemispheres {{at a rate of}} approximately 60km per decade, amounting to approximately one degree of latitude per decade.|$|E
