5|$|Freedom for the Thought That We Hate: A Biography of the First Amendment is a 2007 non-fiction book by {{journalist}} Anthony Lewis about <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> speech, <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> the press, <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> thought, and the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. The book starts by {{quoting the}} First Amendment, which prohibits the U.S. Congress from creating legislation which limits free speech or <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> the press. Lewis traces {{the evolution of}} civil liberties in the U.S. through key historical events. He {{provides an overview of}} important free speech case law, including U.S. Supreme Court opinions in Schenck v. United States (1919), Whitney v. California (1927), United States v. Schwimmer (1929), New York Times Co. v. Sullivan (1964), and New York Times Co. v. United States (1971).|$|E
5|$|<b>Freedom</b> <b>of</b> Expression® is a {{book written}} by Kembrew McLeod about <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> speech issues {{involving}} concepts of intellectual property. The book {{was first published in}} 2005 by Doubleday as <b>Freedom</b> <b>of</b> Expression®: Overzealous Copyright Bozos and Other Enemies of Creativity, and in 2007 by University of Minnesota Press as <b>Freedom</b> <b>of</b> Expression®: Resistance and Repression in the Age of Intellectual Property. The paperback edition includes a foreword by Lawrence Lessig. The author recounts a history of the use of counter-cultural artistry, illegal art, and the use of copyrighted works in art as a form of fair use and creative expression. The book encourages the reader to continue such uses in art and other forms of creative expression.|$|E
5|$|<b>Freedom</b> <b>of</b> Speech was {{the first}} of a series of four oil paintings, {{entitled}} Four Freedoms, painted by Norman Rockwell. The works were inspired by United States President, Franklin D. Roosevelt in a State of the Union Address, known as Four Freedoms, delivered to the 77th United States Congress on January 6, 1941. Of the Four Freedoms, the only two described in the United States Constitution were <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> speech and <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> worship. The Four Freedoms' theme was eventually incorporated into the Atlantic Charter, and it became part of the charter of the United Nations. The series of paintings ran in The Saturday Evening Post accompanied by essays from noted writers on four consecutive weeks: <b>Freedom</b> <b>of</b> Speech (February 20), <b>Freedom</b> <b>of</b> Worship (February 27), Freedom from Want (March 6) and Freedom from Fear (March 13). Eventually, the series became widely distributed in poster form and became instrumental in the U. S. Government War Bond Drive.|$|E

5|$|<b>Freedom</b> <b>of</b> Worship is {{the second}} {{of a series of}} four oil {{paintings}} by Norman Rockwell entitled Four Freedoms. The works were inspired by President Franklin D.

For the essay accompanying <b>Freedom</b> <b>of</b> Worship, Post editor Ben Hibbs chose Durant, who was a best-selling author {{at the peak of his}} fame. At the time, Durant was in the midst of working on his ten-volume The Story of Civilization, coauthored with his wife, Ariel Durant. Will Durant also lectured on history and philosophy.

40|$|An {{elementary}} psychophysical {{model to}} predict ride comfort was developed using flight and simulator data where subjects {{were exposed to}} six degrees <b>of</b> <b>freedom.</b> The model presumes that the comfort response {{is proportional to the}} logarithm of the stimulus above some threshold stimulus. In order to verify this concept of comfort modeling, it was necessary to obtain ride comfort data for single degree <b>of</b> <b>freedom</b> random motions and for combinations of random motions. Accordingly, a simulator program was performed at the NASA Langley Research Center to measure subjective comfort response ratings using one degree <b>of</b> <b>freedom,</b> two degrees <b>of</b> <b>freedom,</b> three degrees <b>of</b> <b>freedom,</b> and six degrees <b>of</b> <b>freedom.</b> An analysis <b>of</b> the single degree <b>of</b> <b>freedom</b> and two degrees <b>of</b> <b>freedom</b> data is presented.
