40|$|The {{use of a}} Dynamic Headspace System (DHS) device {{combined}} with a Thermal Desorption Unit (TDU) interfaced to a Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) system is proposed for the determination of <b>furfurals</b> in oenological products. An experimental design protocol has been employed for the optimization of the instrumental settings concerning DHS and TDU extraction and desorption steps. It has been possible to individuate the following optimized conditions: incubation temperature 40 °C, purge volume 800 mL, dry volume 1500 mL, TDU hold time 5 min and incubation time 10 min. The performance of two different SPE sorbents, namely Tenax TA and Tenax GR used for the <b>furfurals</b> trapping, was investigated too. The developed DHS sampling procedure showed good reproducibility values with a RSD% lower than 10 % for all the monitored species. The optimized experimental settings {{have been used to}} determine <b>furfurals</b> in several vinegar samples obtained by traditional procedure starting from cooked grape musts, i. e. in Aceto Balsamico Tradizionale di Modena (ABTM). In fact, the control of these species is extremely important for quality and safety issues...|$|R
30|$|During the dilute acid {{pretreatment}} of SB, hemicellulose {{is converted}} into various sugars primarily xylose {{and some other}} compounds such as <b>furfurals,</b> phenolics, acids and metals. This acid pretreated SB so called cellulignin when further exposed to dilute sodium hydroxide based pretreatment, considerable fraction of lignin is removed [8]. Alkali-mediated pretreatment methods degrade the lignin and release phenolic compounds, aromatic alcohols and aldehydes which strongly inhibit the microbial metabolism [9 – 11]. Compounds derived from hemicellulose and lignin during pretreatment, if discarded in open environment, heavily pollutes the land and water. <b>Furfurals,</b> acids, and phenolic compounds (p-hydroxybenzoic acid, m-hydroxybenzoic acid, vanillic acid, syringic acid, p-hydroxybenzaldehyde, vanillin, cinnamic acid, syringaldehyde and others) [12, 13] contribute a huge environmental damage due to high toxic content, bioaccumulation in different food chains even at low concentrations [14].|$|R
25|$|<b>Furfural</b> is an {{important}} renewable, non-petroleum based, chemical feedstock. Hydrogenation of <b>furfural</b> provides furfuryl alcohol (FA) which is a useful chemical intermediate in for example the manufacture of furan resin prepolymers exploited in thermoset polymer matrix composites, cements, adhesives, casting resins and coatings. Further hydrogenation of furfuryl alcohol leads to tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFA) which {{is used as a}} nonhazardous solvent in agricultural formulations and as an adjuvant to help herbicides penetrate the leaf structure. <b>Furfural</b> is used to make other furan chemicals, such as furoic acid, via oxidation, and furan itself via palladium catalyzed vapor phase decarbonylation. <b>Furfural</b> is also {{an important}} chemical solvent.|$|E
25|$|Between 3% and 10% of {{the mass}} of crop residue {{feedstocks}} can be recovered as <b>furfural,</b> {{depending on the type of}} feedstock. <b>Furfural</b> and water evaporate together from the reaction mixture, and separate upon condensation. The global production capacity is about 800,000 tons as of 2012. China is the biggest supplier of <b>furfural,</b> and accounts for the greater part of global capacity. The other two major commercial producers are Illovo Sugar in the Republic of South Africa and Central Romana in the Dominican Republic.|$|E
25|$|In {{industrial}} production, some lignocellulosic residue remains {{after the}} removal of the <b>furfural.</b> This residue is dried and burned to provide steam for the operation of the <b>furfural</b> plant. Newer and more energy efficient plants have excess residue, which is or can be used for co-generation of electricity, cattle feed, activated carbon, mulch/fertiliser, etc. It also {{has been used as a}} glue extender in the North American board industry.|$|E
40|$|The use of {{renewable}} resources to produce fine chemicals is an underdeveloped area. A waste-free {{technology will be}} necessary to further convert platform chemicals, readily available from biomass.

30|$|By GC–MS {{we found}} mainly acetic acid, propionic acid, hydroxypropanone and levoglucosan {{in the raw}} {{pyrolysis}} oil and in the aqueous phases. All these substances are typical pyrolysis products from cellulose and hemicellulose. Some furans and <b>furfurals</b> were also present in the investigated oil. Typical lignin fragments could be found, like phenol, guaiacol and syringol. Also numerous other phenol derivatives were present. Many unidentifiable compounds had molecular weights between 200 and 300  g/mol.|$|R
40|$|Waste from {{pulp and}} paper mills consist of sugar-rich {{fractions}} comprising hemicellulose derivatives and cellulose by-products. A complete characterisation of the waste streams is necessary to study the possibilities of an existing mill. In this work, four chromatographic methods {{have been developed to}} obtain the most suitable chromatographic method conditions for measuring woody feedstocks, lignocellulosic hydrolysates and cellulose pulp in sulphite pulping processes. The analysis of major and minor monosaccharides, aliphatic carboxylic acids and <b>furfurals</b> has been optimised. An important drawback of the spent liquors generated after sulphite pulping is their acidic nature, high viscosity and adhesive properties that interfere in the column lifetime. This work recommends both a CHO- 782 Pb column for the sugar analysis and an SH- 1011 resin-based cross-linked gel column to separate low-molecular-weight chain acids, alcohols and <b>furfurals.</b> Such columns resulted in a good separation with long lifetime, wide pH operating range and low fouling issues.

25|$|Chemically, <b>furfural</b> is an {{aldehyde}} of furan. It is a colorless oily liquid {{with the}} odor of almonds, which quickly darkens when exposed to air.|$|E
25|$|At the time, {{formic acid}} {{was formed by}} the {{distillation}} of dead ants, and Döbereiner's ant bodies probably contained some plant matter. In 1840, the Scottish chemist John Stenhouse found that the same chemical could be produced by distilling {{a wide variety of}} crop materials, including corn, oats, bran, and sawdust, with aqueous sulfuric acid; he also determined an empirical formula of (C5H4O2). George Fownes named this oil furfurol in 1845 (from furfur - bran, and oleum). This name persisted prominently in the literature until 1901 when the German chemist Carl Harries deduced <b>furfural's</b> structure.|$|R
30|$|Other {{main problem}} of vinasses is its usual dark brown {{color and the}} {{presence}} of high amount of polyphenolic compounds (34 – 542  mg L− 1) (Table  2), such as tannic acid, humic acid, carbohydrates and <b>furfurals</b> from acid hydrolysis (Pant and Adholeya 2007). Phenolic compounds can have a phytotoxic effect on plant tissues during germination and seedling development (Casa et al. 2003). Additionally, phenolic compounds and melanoidins can repress biological treatments of vinasses and inhibit the activity of microorganisms in soil and water bodies (Parnaudeau et al. 2008). This will be discussed in other section of this manuscript.|$|R
30|$|Regarding the {{generation}} of inhibitory byproducts against either the metabolic bioconversion or fermentation, although the theoretical indexes of the FBSSF-treated straw were not {{higher than those of}} lignocellulose pretreated using conventional approaches, the activation of inhibitors, such as acetates, HMFs, and <b>furfurals,</b> was either negligible or not detected (Table  6). Especially, the activation of byproducts from the physicochemical treatment (especially dilute acid program; Merino and Cherry 2007) was found to result in higher than that of the green biochemistry-based platform (here EBI-based program). Regarding the metabolic cascades in fermentation biosystem, the intentional induction of major metabolic byproducts (especially cellobioses and glycerols; Table  6) was also found to result in higher intracellular bioconversion compared with substrate consumption (% theoretical indexes; Table  5) on byproduct accumulation.|$|R
25|$|The {{third class}} {{includes}} reactions describing {{the synthesis of}} FDCA from <b>furfural.</b> <b>Furfural</b> can be oxidized to 2-furoic acid with nitric acid and the latter was subsequently converted to its methyl ester. The ester was then converted via chloromethylation at position 5 to give 5-chloromethylfuroate. The latter was oxidized with nitric acid to form dimethyl 2,5-furandicarboxylate, which, after the alkaline hydrolysis gave FDCA in 50% yield. Andrisano reported that potassium 2-furoate, when heated up to 300nbsp&°C in a nitrogen atmosphere, underwent decarboxylation to furan with simultaneous carboxylation at position 5 to di-potassium 2,5-furandicarboxylate.|$|E
25|$|<b>Furfural</b> {{was first}} {{isolated}} in 1821 (published in 1832) by the German chemist Johann Wolfgang Döbereiner, who produced {{a small sample}} as a byproduct of formic acid synthesis.|$|E
25|$|<b>Furfural</b> {{was used}} as a fuel dye for all heating fuel for tax {{purposes}} in Finland before being replaced in 31.8.2003 by Solvent Yellow 124 due to EU legislation.|$|E
30|$|Further {{reaction}} products come from ring-opening reactions of heterocyclic compounds (such as <b>furfurals).</b> They {{can be described}} as linear or sparsely branched, saturated chains with 5 – 6 carbon atoms and 1 – 3 hydroxylic or caboxylic groups (e.g. hexan- 2 -one). From the analysis of the chemical compositions of the products we concluded that CO 2 has no direct influence on product distribution. The reasons are speculative. For instance it is conceivable that the solubility of hydrogen in the pyrolysis oil stays low due to the high temperature. The rheological measurements already showed that with higher temperature the GXL-effect on viscosity is decreased. We suspect the same trend in hydrogen solubility. However, the mass-transfer limitation could not be overcome, neither diminished, by adding carbon dioxide to the mixture.|$|R

The title compound, C 17 H 18 NO + I, is an adduct {{resulting}} from an intramolecular Diels–Alder reaction of methallyl chloride with 3, 4 -dihydro- 1 -furylisoquinoline. The cation comprises a fused pentacyclic system containing three fivemembered rings (dihydropyrrole, dihydrofuran and tetrahydrofuran) and two six-membered rings (tetrahydropyridine and benzene).

30|$|To {{support the}} inefficient {{limitation}} of long-term biosystem by well-known simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF), electron beam irradiated rice straw (at 80  kGy, 1  MeV, and 0.12  mA) was fermented using fungal-based simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (FBSSF) by saprophytic zygomycetes Mucor indicus. Based {{on the growth}} optimization (by response surface methodology), this eco-friendly bioprocess either without metabolic inhibitors (especially <b>furfurals</b> and acetic acids) or byproducts (especially glycerols) significantly increased the biodegradability and fermentability of lignocellulosic rice straw. Specifically, when irradiated straw was simultaneously bioconverted by M. indicus for 48  h, the ethanol yield was 57.2 % of the theoretical maximum. This value was on the similar level as the 59.8 % (for 144  h) measured from processed straw by well-known SSF. Furthermore, after FBSSF for 144  h based on large-scale mass balance, the ethanol concentration and production yield, and productivity were 34.6  g/L, 72.3 % of the theoretical maximum, and 0.24  g/L/h, respectively.|$|R
25|$|In the laboratory, furan can be {{obtained}} from <b>furfural</b> by oxidation to 2-furoic acid, followed by decarboxylation. It can also be prepared directly by thermal decomposition of pentose-containing materials, and cellulosic solids, especially pine wood.|$|E
25|$|Butadiene is {{typically}} {{isolated from the}} other four-carbon hydrocarbons produced in steam cracking by extractive distillation using a polar aprotic solvent such as acetonitrile, N-methylpyrrolidone, <b>furfural,</b> or dimethylformamide, from which it is then stripped by distillation.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to ethanol and water, most alcoholic drinks also contain congeners, either as flavoring or as {{a by-product of}} fermentation and the wine aging process. While ethanol is by itself sufficient to produce most hangover effects, congeners may potentially aggravate hangover and other residual effects to some extent. Congeners include substances such as amines, amides, acetones, acetaldehydes, polyphenols, methanol, histamines, fusel oil, esters, <b>furfural,</b> and tannins, many {{but not all of}} which are toxic. One study in mice indicates that fusel oil may have a mitigating effect on hangover symptoms, while some whiskey congeners such as butanol protect the stomach against gastric mucosal damage in the rat. Different types of alcoholic beverages contain different amounts of congeners. In general, dark liquors have a higher concentration while clear liquors have a lower concentration. Whereas vodka has virtually no more congeners than pure ethanol, bourbon has a total congener content 37 times higher than that found in vodka.|$|E
30|$|Forest {{bioenergy}} from renewable biomass {{has been}} actively reviewed {{as an alternative}} solution to the energy crisis (i.e., dependence on fossil fuels) and environmental instability (especially global warming) (Hudiburg et al. 2011). The stable production of cellulosic ethanol is dependent upon the extracellular bioconversion of crystalline-based fibers into biodegradable (or fermentable) monomers. Therefore, a few appropriate pretreatment processes (e.g., physicochemical and biochemical approach) is essential to increase the bioaccessibility (or porosity) of recalcitrant lignocellulosic substrates (Sanderson 2011; Chen and Dixon 2007). Recent trends of pretreatment technology have been focused on environmentally friendly programs (without inhibitory byproducts; e.g., <b>furfurals)</b> instead of traditional conventional processes using physicochemical methods (Menon and Rao 2012). Especially, electron beam irradiation (EBI)-based hydrolysis has been successfully developed for pretreatment of lignocellulosic feedstock (Bak et al. 2009; Hamm and Hamm 2012). In spite of high reaction rates based on enzymatic digestibility and structural crystallinity, this pretreatment method does not need the accessory processes (e.g., neutralization and cooling step).|$|R
40|$|International audienceFern (Pterisvittata L.) fronds were {{collected}} in the Reppel small-scale field experiment aiming at arsenic phytoextraction. Three organic fractions, i. e. holocellulose, hemicelluloses, and lignin, were extracted from the fronds. The frond biomass {{as well as the}} holocellulose, hemicelluloses, and lignin fractions were converted by sub- and supercritical water treatments at low temperatures, 300 °C and 400 °C with 25 MPa, and organic products were identified. This study highlighted that hemicelluloses and lignin are reported as the major sources of cyclopentenones and <b>furfurals,</b> 5 carbons-containing products. The degradation of carbohydrates part (holocellulose and α-cellulose) provided the largest range of by-products due to the thermal resistance of the lignin. The control of biochemical families's content and temperature should determine the presence of required by-products. The fact that no 'synthetic' materials but original materials, i. e. holocellulose, α-cellulose and lignin directly extracted from control fern fronds have been converted revealed the presence of benzenes and cyclopentenones, by-products which have not been reported by the literature...|$|R
40|$|Hydrothermal {{conversion}} is {{a procedure}} which emulates organic matter’s natural conversion into bio-crude having {{physical and chemical}} properties analogous to petroleum. The artificial transformation of biomass requi- res previous knowledge of the main reaction routes and product availability. The main component of biomass (depolymerisation by hydrolysis) is presented in hydrothermal cellulose conversion, producing oligosaccharides which exhibit dehydration and retro-aldol condensation reactions for transforming into <b>furfurals</b> and carboxylic acids. Other biomass components (such as lignin, proteins, and fat esters) present both hydrolysis and pyrolysis reaction routes. As long as biomass mainly contains carbohydrates, subcritical hydrothermal conversion products and their wastes will be fundamentally analogous to those displaying cellulose. These substances have added- value by far surpassing raw material’s acquisition cost. When the main hydrothermal conversion products’ O/C, H/C molar ratios as reported in literature are plotted, an evolutionary tralectory for conversion products appears to be closely or even overlapped with fossil fuels’ geological evolution...|$|R

500|$|A {{study of}} a closely related {{southeast}} Asian Astraeus species concluded that the fungus contained an abundance of volatile eight-carbon compounds (including 1-octanol, 1-octen-3-ol, and 1-octen-3-one) that imparted a [...] "mushroom-like, earthy, and pungent odor that was evident as an oily and moss-like smell upon opening the caps". The study's authors further noted that the fruit bodies after cooking have a [...] "roasted, maillard, herbal, and oily flavor". Volatile compounds detected after cooking the mushroom samples included <b>furfural,</b> benzaldehyde, cyclohexenone, and furanyl compounds. The regional differences in opinions on edibility are from sources published before it was known that North American and Asian versions of A.hygrometricus were not always the same; in some cases Asian specimens {{have been identified as}} new species, such as A.asiaticus and A.odoratus.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Furfural</b> {{participates in}} {{the same kinds of}} {{reactions}} as other aldehydes and other aromatic compounds, but has less aromatic character than benzene, as {{can be seen from the}} fact that <b>furfural</b> is readily hydrogenated to the corresponding tetrahydrofuran derivatives.

40|$|A {{new method}} has been {{developed}} that detects significant quantitative differences in the amounts of pyrazines, pyridines, <b>furfurals,</b> carboxylic acids, b-damascenone, sclareolide, and megastigmatrienones in the mainstream smoke {{of a series of}} five commercial cigarettes. This new quantitative method is based on the gas chromatographic-selected ion monitoring-mass spectrometric (GC-SIM-MS) determination of the selected smoke constituents. The accuracy and precision of the approach were well within acceptable parameters with the majority of cases relative standard deviation (RSD) values consistently around 5 %. Sample preparation was simple requiring only the dissolution of the trapped particulate material in a known volume of methanol followed by injection of this clear dark colored solution into the gas chromatograph. This approach represents an advance in the technology in terms of higher sample throughput and less sample workup. Certain products demonstrated consistent trends in concentration of specific chemical classes. The mainstream smoke from a University of Kentucky reference cigarette, 2 R 4 F, was included for reference purposes. These results are applicable in the overall evaluation of the components responsible for the taste associated with cigarette products...|$|R
30|$|A {{number of}} {{different}} processes including incineration, gasification and pyrolysis {{may be used for}} treating this waste fines stream (Monte et al. 2009). However, direct hydrolysis of the cellulose into sugars can be particularly attractive due to the simplicity of the process and ready use of the sugar solution after concentration (Wang et al. 2012). These sugars {{can be used as a}} feedstock for conversions into biofuels and bioplastics such as polyhydroxy alkanoates or into platform chemicals such as succinic acid, lactic acid, levulinic acid and <b>furfurals</b> (Zhang 2008; Bhuwal et al. 2014; Graf and Koehler 2000; Lark et al. 1997; Kádár et al. 2004) Of the varieties of paper mill fines rejects, those from recycled pulp mills using old corrugated cartons are particularly important. Some modern OCC mills find that rejecting ‘inactive’ fines into the waste stream can be more profitable than using them in the manufactured product, particularly recycled linerboard. The reject stream thus contains higher cellulosic fines contents and typically lower minerals than deinked pulp rejects in the waste streams of fine papers or tissue mills.|$|R

The formation of these two types of reaction products depends on the nucleophilicity of the arene. The same reactions under the action of acidic zeolites H-USY in high pressure tubes at 130 °C for 1 h result in the formation of only 5 -arylmethylfurfurals (yields of 45 – 79 %). 2, 5 -Diformylfuran (2, 5 -DFF) in the reaction with arenes under the action of AlBr 3 {{at room temperature for}} 1 h leads to 5 -(diarylmethyl) <b>furfurals</b> (yields of 51 – 90 %).
