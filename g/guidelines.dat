United States and European Union <b>guidelines</b> disagree somewhat about how long, and for what indications this combined therapy should be continued after surgery. U.S. <b>guidelines</b> recommend DAPT for at least 12 months, while EU <b>guidelines</b> recommend DAPT for 6–12 months after a drug-eluting stent placement. However, they agree that aspirin be continued indefinitely after DAPT is complete.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: A good {{clinical}} <b>guideline</b> for integrated traditional Chinese and Western medicine (ITCWM) {{should be}} established by multi-subject specialists, including clinical expert of ITCWM, traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine, and medical staff from different levels of health care organization, clinical and preclinical medicine researcher, statistician, clinical epidemiologist and economist, medical decision-maker and administrative expert. Establishment of <b>guideline</b> should be abided by the following scientific procedure: association of ITCWM (AITCWM) or the branch of AITCWM decides the subject of clinical <b>guideline,</b> set up a team of special subject of clinical <b>guideline</b> (or decided by research project), evaluate literature systematically, prepare a draft manuscript, consult and appraise {{it in the same}} occupation, announce the content in the academic circle, collect feedback opinions and proposals and then make analysis, modify the clinical <b>guideline,</b> publish the clinical <b>guideline,</b> apply the clinical <b>guideline,</b> collect and appraise feedback opinions and proposals, modify and consummate the clinical <b>guideline.</b> In order to supply and consummate original <b>guideline,</b> scientific and renewed evidence should be emphasized on the basis of evidence-based medicine. The author also suggested insistence on the combination of disease and syndrome, syndrome being governed by disease, standardization of syndrome type, establishment of reasonable amount of syndrome types, standard and method of modifying the treatment. The user of <b>guideline</b> should pay attention to both the principle and flexibility, and the author stressed that <b>guideline</b> was just a diagnosis and treatment reference to clinician, which should be used flexibly and not be imitated mechanically in practical application. The practicability of <b>guideline</b> should be pay attention to so that the clinician can apply and manipulate the <b>guideline</b> easily. Meanwhile, the group of <b>guideline</b> establishment has an obligation to train medical staff and to promote the practice of clinical <b>guideline.</b> Only in this way, the authority, standardization and applicability of clinical <b>guideline</b> on ITCWM can be ensured, and then the expected purpose of clinical <b>guideline</b> establishment can be attained...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: An {{evidence-based}} {{clinical practice}} <b>guideline</b> for laryngeal carcinomas {{was introduced in}} the Netherlands late 1999. The objective of this <b>guideline</b> was to ensure uniformity in the diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up. We retrospectively evaluated whether clinical practice changed according to the recommendations of this <b>guideline</b> and whether it succeeded in its aim. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In five out of eight Dutch university hospitals, chart data of 459 patients treated before the <b>guideline</b> introduction were compared to data of 363 patients treated after the <b>guideline</b> introduction. RESULTS: Patient and tumour characteristics were comparable among both groups. In general, the <b>guideline</b> recommendations were properly complied with. The patients treated before the <b>guideline</b> introduction were actually also for a large part already treated according to the <b>guideline's</b> recommendations. After its introduction, several changes according to the <b>guideline</b> were observed: increased rates of reassessment of biopsy samples taken in local hospitals, psychological screening (although still only performed in 10. 5 % of patients), application of accelerated radiotherapy schedules, clinical trial treatments, function-preserving treatments, and decreased rates of total laryngectomy, and annual chest X-rays during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Although a causal relationship cannot be established in this kind of observational studies, several positive changes were observed after the introduction of the <b>guideline,</b> and therefore the <b>guideline</b> seems to have contributed to more uniformity. The largest changes were seen for the <b>guideline</b> recommendations based on the highest levels of evidence...|$|R

40|$|Background: Extensive {{investigations}} are often performed {{to reveal the}} cause of chronic polyneuropathy. It is not known whether a restrictive diagnostic <b>guideline</b> improves cost efficiency without loss of diagnostic reliability. Methods: In a prospective multicentre study, a comparison was made between the workup in patients with chronic polyneuropathy before and after <b>guideline</b> implementation. Results: Three hundred and ten patients were included: 173 before and 137 after <b>guideline</b> implementation.

40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} <b>guideline</b> operationalization in terms of intensity threshold, bout duration, and days on the proportion of children meeting the health-related 60 -min physical activity <b>guideline</b> using a subjective and an objective assessment method. Methods: Five hundred and twenty-one children (6 - 11 yr) completed a physical activity diary for at least 4 d. A subsample of 51 children simultaneously wore an ActiGraph (ActiGraph, Pensacola, FL) accelerometer. Time spent above moderate-intensity thresholds of 3 and 5 METs, respectively, for continuous bouts of at least 1, 5, and 10 min was calculated. For each intensity threshold and bout duration, the proportion of children meeting the 60 -min <b>guideline</b> was calculated. A distinction was made between meeting the 60 -min threshold on each assessment day and meeting this threshold on average across all assessment days. Results: The proportion of children meeting the 60 -min <b>guideline</b> differed considerably by <b>guideline</b> operationalization and assessment method. It ranged from 3 % to 86 % using the diary and from 0 % to 100 % using the ActiGraph. Overall, {{a higher proportion of}} children met the <b>guideline</b> when the 3 -MET intensity threshold was used compared with the 5 -MET threshold and when a shorter bout duration was used compared with a longer bout duration. More children met the <b>guideline</b> on average across all assessment days compared with the <b>guideline</b> on each assessment day. In general, boys were found to be more active than girls, independent of <b>guideline</b> operationalization and assessment method. Conclusion: Meeting the 60 -min <b>guideline</b> highly depends on <b>guideline</b> operationalization and assessment method. Consensus about how the <b>guideline</b> should be operationalized is needed to monitor the extent to which populations of children meet the <b>guideline</b> and to simplify comparison, between studies Copyright © 2008 by the American College of Sports Medicine...|$|R
