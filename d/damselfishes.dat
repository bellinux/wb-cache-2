5|$|A {{sedentary}} ambush predator, the Pacific angelshark feeds {{mainly on}} bony fishes, including kelp bass, croakers, flatfishes, <b>damselfishes,</b> mackerels, and sardines. During {{the winter and}} early spring, spawning squid are abundant and become {{the primary source of}} food. In the southern Gulf of California, the most important prey species are, in descending order, the mackerel Decapterus macrosoma, the toadfish Porichthys analis, the lizardfish Synodus evermann, the soldierfish Myripristis leiognathus, and the shrimp Sicyonia penicillata. At Catalina Island, this species feeds mainly on the blacksmith (Chromis punctipinnis) and the queenfish (Seriphus politus). Adults and juveniles have similar diets.|$|E
5|$|Three {{types of}} habitats, mangroves, reefs and seagrasses, {{are found in}} Puerto Rico's ocean waters. A total of 677 fish species live in these habitats; 242 being reef species. Fish species found in Puerto Rican reefs are {{representative}} of the general Caribbean fauna. Common reef fishes include wrasses, <b>damselfishes,</b> white grunts (Haemulon plumieri), bluestriped grunts (Haemulon sciurus), queen parrotfish (Scarus vetula), and sharks (family Carcharhinidae). Sea breams (Archosargus rhomboidalis) and yellowfin mojarras (Gerres cinereus) are some of the species commonly found in mangrove habitats. Other species of interest include flatfishes, with 21 recorded species, and sharks, with more than 20 species. Oceanic whitetip sharks and silky sharks are common in the Mona Passage.|$|E
5|$|With its slender, lithe body, the whitetip reef shark {{specializes in}} wriggling into narrow crevices and {{holes in the}} reef and extracting prey {{inaccessible}} to other reef sharks. Alternatively, it is rather clumsy when attempting to take food suspended in open water. This species feeds mainly on bony fishes, including eels, squirrelfishes, snappers, <b>damselfishes,</b> parrotfishes, surgeonfishes, triggerfishes and goatfishes, as well as octopuses, spiny lobsters, and crabs. The whitetip reef shark is highly responsive to the olfactory, acoustic, and electrical cues given off by potential prey, while its visual system is attuned more to movement and/or contrast than to object details. It is especially sensitive to natural and artificial low-frequency sounds in the 25100Hz range, which evoke struggling fish.|$|E

5000|$|Chrysiptera cyanea is {{a species}} of <b>damselfish</b> native to the Indian and western Pacific Oceans. Common names include blue <b>damselfish,</b> blue demoiselle, blue devil, {{cornflower}} sergeant-major, [...] Hedley's <b>damselfish,</b> red tail Australian damsel, sapphire devil, and sky-blue damsel.|$|R
50|$|Dascyllus melanurus, known {{commonly}} as {{the four}} stripe <b>damselfish,</b> blacktail dascyllus, humbug <b>damselfish,</b> blacktail <b>damselfish,</b> and blacktail humbug, is {{a species of}} fish in the family Pomacentridae. It is native to the western Pacific Ocean. It is sometimes kept as an aquarium pet.|$|R
5|$|There {{are several}} {{different}} mating systems among teleosts. Some species are promiscuous, where {{both males and}} females breed with multiple partners and there are no obvious mate choices. This has been recorded in Baltic herring, guppies, Nassau groupers, humbug damselfish, cichlids and creole wrasses. Polygamy, where one sex has multiple partners can come in many forms. Polyandry consists of one adult female breeding with multiple males, which only breed with that female. This is rare among teleosts, and fish in general, but is found in the clownfish. In addition, it may also exist to an extent among anglerfish, where some females have more than one male attached to them. Polygyny, where one male breeds with multiple females, is much more common. This is recorded in sculpins, sunfish, darters, damselfish and cichlids where multiple females may visit a territorial male that guards and takes care of eggs and young. Polygyny may also involve a male guarding a harem of several females. This occurs in coral reef species, such as <b>damselfishes,</b> wrasses, parrotfishes, surgeonfishes, triggerfishes and tilefishes.|$|E
25|$|Herbivores feed on plants. The four largest {{groups of}} coral reef fishes that feed on plants are the parrotfishes, <b>damselfishes,</b> rabbitfishes, and surgeonfishes. All feed {{primarily}} on microscopic and macroscopic algae growing {{on or near}} coral reefs.|$|E
25|$|The whitetip reef shark {{is highly}} {{responsive}} to olfactory, acoustic, and electrical cues given off by potential prey. Its visual system is attuned more to movement and/or contrast than to object details. It is especially sensitive to natural and artificial low-frequency {{sounds in the}} 25100Hz range, which evoke struggling fish. They hunt primarily at night, when many fishes are asleep and easily taken. After dusk, a group of sharks may target the same prey item, covering every exit route from a particular coral head. Each shark hunts for itself and in competition with the others in its group. They feed mainly on bony fishes, including eels, squirrelfishes, snappers, <b>damselfishes,</b> parrotfishes, surgeonfishes, triggerfishes, and goatfishes, as well as octopus, spiny lobsters, and crabs. Important predators of the whitetip reef shark include tiger sharks and Galapagos sharks.|$|E

50|$|The scissortail {{sergeant}} or striptailed <b>damselfish</b> (Abudefduf sexfasciatus, family Pomacentridae) {{is a large}} <b>damselfish.</b> It earns {{its name}} from the black-striped tail and sides, which are reminiscent of the insignia of a military Sergeant, being {{similar to those of the}} Sergeant Major <b>damselfish.</b> It grows to a length of about 16 cm.|$|R
25|$|A few {{species of}} goby, such as blackeye goby and Lythrypnus dalli, can change their sexes. Sex change is {{possible}} in these gobies, since the external genitalia {{for males and females}} do not differ much. Sex changes can take from days to weeks. Most sex changes in gobies are from female to male (protogyny) rather than male to female (protandry). Female-to-male changes are observed not only in gobies but also in wrasses, <b>damselfishes,</b> and sea basses. Female-to-male change usually occurs because the resident male of the group is dead. If there is no male in the group, reproduction will be impossible. Therefore, the dominant female turns into male, allowing mating to happen. Male-to-female change occurs when the females have preference for specific features in males. For example, female gobies prefer large males, and a few large males mate with multiple females, whereas small males lose their chance to mate. Small males either choose to become sneakers (kleptogamy) or choose to transform into females because all females technically have high mating opportunities. By turning into females, males can ensure that they produce many descendants.|$|E
500|$|In {{the central}} Caribbean, Cayman Brac {{was hit by}} winds in excess of [...] which caused {{considerable}} property damage. A coral reef at Discovery Bay, Jamaica was devastated by the wave action from the storm. Offshore Jamaica, greater numbers of smaller-sized <b>Damselfishes</b> was witnessed {{in the wake of}} Allen. Eight deaths in Jamaica were attributed to Allen. Damage was very significant along the northeast coast, where the hurricane made its closest approach to the island and created a [...] storm surge. Three deaths were attributed to Allen in Cuba.|$|E
500|$|Unlike {{many of its}} relatives, the {{mangrove}} whipray {{is reportedly}} solitary in nature. It is relatively inactive during the day, often resting half-buried in sand or atop coral heads, and actively forages for food at night. The electroreceptive ampullae of Lorenzini of this species have a sensitivity of 4 nV/cm and an effective range of , enabling it to locate buried prey. Juveniles feed mainly on small crustaceans, including prawns and crabs. Adults prey on small benthic bony fishes, including rabbitfishes, gobies, blennies, wrasses, and <b>damselfishes,</b> as well as invertebrates, including peanut worms, crabs, octopuses, and bivalves. As in all stingrays, the mangrove whipray is aplacental viviparous, with the developing embryos being sustained by nutrient-rich histotroph ("uterine milk") produced by the mother. The newborns measure [...] across, and males reach sexual maturity at [...] across. Known parasites of this species include the tapeworm Rhinebothrium himanturi, and another undescribed species in the same genus.|$|E

2500|$|Cichlids [...] are {{fish from}} the family Cichlidae in the order Perciformes. Cichlids {{are members of a}} {{suborder}} known as Labroidei, along with the wrasses (Labridae), <b>damselfishes</b> (Pomacentridae), and surfperches (Embiotocidae). This family is both large and diverse. At least 1,650 species have been scientifically described, {{making it one of the}} largest vertebrate families. New species are discovered annually, and many species remain undescribed. The actual number of species is therefore unknown, with estimates varying between 2,000 and 3,000. Cichlids are popular freshwater fish kept in the home aquarium.|$|E
2500|$|The ocellaris clownfish (Amphiprion ocellaris), {{also known}} as the false percula clownfish or common clownfish, is a marine fish {{belonging}} to the family Pomacentridae, which includes clownfishes and <b>damselfishes.</b> Amphiprion ocellaris [...] are found in different colors, depending on where they are located. For example, black Amphiprion ocellaris [...] with white bands can be found near northern Australia, Southeast Asia, and Japan. Orange or red-brown Amphiprion ocellaris also exist with three similar white bands on the body and head. Amphiprion ocellaris can be distinguished from other Amphriphon species {{based on the number of}} pectoral rays and dorsal spines. Amphiprion ocellaris are known to grow about 110mm long. Like many other fish species, females are, however, larger than males. The life cycle of Amphiprion ocellaris varies in whether they reside at the surface or bottom of the ocean. When they initially hatch, they reside near the surface. However, when Amphiprion ocellaris enter into the juvenile stage of life, they travel down to the bottom to find shelter from a host anemone. Once they find their anemone, they form a [...] symbiotic relationship with them.|$|E
