25|$|We {{knew that}} we had created a new means of warfare, and the {{question}} as to what nation, to what victorious nation we were willing to entrust this brainchild of ours was a moral decision more than anything <b>else.</b> <b>We</b> wanted to see the world spared another conflict such as Germany had just been through, and we felt that only by surrendering such a weapon to people who are guided by the Bible could such an assurance to the world be best secured.|$|E
25|$|I {{bought my}} first copy in 1968 – a small, fat bundle of Pelican {{with a picture}} of a Yorkshire miner on the front – and I still have it, bandaged up and {{exhausted}} by the years of labour. From the first of its 900-odd pages, I knew, and my friends at the University of Sussex knew, that this was something <b>else.</b> <b>We</b> talked about it in the bar and on the bus and in the refectory queue. Imagine that: young male students more interested in a book than in gooseberry tart and custard.|$|E
25|$|I {{would say}} from my gut {{that we are}} {{probably}} as low as we're {{going to go in}} that valley, and heading for the next peak. That's fine with me because everybody needs a turn. We've been {{at the top of the}} mountain twice already, and, if nothing <b>else,</b> <b>we</b> need to get out of the way and let other bands have some fun. I mean, now there's variety that Christian kids can have. And they don't just grab Petra. Now they can grab Jars of Clay, dc Talk or Newsboys.|$|E

500|$|Georges Dumézil {{disagrees with}} the notion of Scadin-avia as {{etymologically}} [...] "the island of the goddess Skaði." [...] Dumézil comments that the first element Scadin must have had—or once had—a connection to [...] "darkness" [...] "or something <b>else</b> <b>we</b> cannot be sure of". Dumézil says that, rather, the name Skaði derives from the name of the geographical region, which was at the time no longer completely understood. In connection, Dumézil points to a parallel in Ériu, a goddess personifying Ireland that appears in some Irish texts, whose name he says comes from Ireland {{rather than the other way}} around.|$|E
500|$|On August 31, 2007, Diamond Rio {{signed with}} Word Records, a Christian music label based in Nashville. Their first album for Word was a Christmas album {{entitled}} , which they recorded in Olander's basement studio. Roe {{said in an}} interview with CMT that [...] "we just didn't try to copy anybody <b>else.</b> <b>We</b> tried to make up our own arrangements." [...] The group released its first contemporary Christian album, The Reason, on September 22, 2009. It earned the band three Dove Award nominations: Song of the Year for [...] "God Is There", Country Song of the Year for the title track, and Country Album of the Year.|$|E

500|$|Spin {{magazine}} {{described the}} Pixies' musical style as [...] "Surf music-meets-Stooges spikiness and oft-imitated stop/start and quiet/loud dynamics". Their music {{has also been}} pictured as [...] "an unorthodox marriage of surf music and punk rock, ... characterized by Black's bristling lyrics and hackle-raising caterwaul, Kim Deal's whispered harmonies and waspy basslines, Joey Santiago's fragile guitar, and the persistent flush of David Lovering's drums." [...] The band's music incorporates extreme dynamic shifts; Francis explained in 1991, [...] "Those are the two basic components of rock music... the dreamy side and the rockin' side. It's always been either sweaty or laid back and cool. We do try to be dynamic, but it's dumbo dynamics, because we don't {{know how to do}} anything <b>else.</b> <b>We</b> can play loud or quiet—that's it".|$|E
500|$|... "August" [...] was co-written by co-showrunners J. H. Wyman and Jeff Pinkner, {{while being}} {{directed}} by NCIS veteran Dennis Smith. They began shooting the episode {{during the second}} half of September 2009, right after wrapping production on [...] "Of Human Action". Supervising producer Josh Singer later noted how [...] "August" [...] helped them write the rest of the season, [...] "There was one episode, 'August', which was all about the Observers, that I feel was mythology without being mythology. And somehow, in working that episode, we sort of found a new creative vein. And it's not that that episode was necessarily so related to everything <b>else</b> <b>we</b> did. But I feel like it sort of opened us up in terms of how we were feeling about the year".|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{critical}} success, the third season of Parks and Recreation continued to suffer in the Nielsen ratings, {{just as it}} had during the second season. The average viewership for the 16 episodes of season three were 4.75 million household viewers, a slight increase over season two's 4.68 million average, but lower than season one's average of 5.45 million households. Michael Schur partially attributed the continually low viewership to a decline in ratings for NBC in general, as well as changing viewer trends due to a large amount of available channels. He added: [...] "I would love it if our ratings went up and up, and we've done {{a pretty good job of}} making our show inviting and friendly, welcoming to new viewers. Other than that, I'm not sure what <b>else</b> <b>we</b> can do. It’s very disconcerting." ...|$|E

500|$|A major effect {{required}} {{throughout the}} episode was face replacements, {{especially during the}} 'May vs. May' fight where it had to appear as if Wen was fighting herself. All the effects were completed in the two weeks between the filming and airing of the episode. Wen noted that [...] "Kevin Tancharoen directed [...] and he’s amazing with his directing with the Mortal Kombat series. So we had this really complicated sequence where we do this 360 and it reveals me and it reveals me again and there’s no cut and you wonder how that happens {{in one of the}} fight sequences. And that’s because they completely scanned and CGIed my face onto the stunt double. So there’s a tremendous amount of work that went into the fight scenes and we did not {{have a lot of time}} to do it." [...] She also elaborated that [...] "On the day of, you have the set and you have the cameras, and you have to deal with special effects, because on top of everything <b>else</b> <b>we</b> had to scan my face and go through this incredible process of taking a million pictures so they were able to meld it onto Sam’s face." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2004, Antestor {{changed their}} style {{into a more}} modern black metal, and {{released}} their first set of new songs since The Return of the Black Death in an EP called Det tapte liv ("The Lost Life"). Det tapte liv concentrated less on the black metal aspects of Antestor's style, instead focusing more on instrumental songs. [...] However, it hinted at what the band was preparing for their 2005 full-length, The Forsaken. The cover arts for both releases were once again done by Kristian Wåhlin, and the cover for the EP depicts the Borgund Stave Church. Hellhammer played all drums on both of these releases. In {{an interview with the}} Russian metal site Metal Library on January 7, 2007, Blomberg was asked what did his Mayhem colleagues and record company think about his participation in Antestor, and he said: [...] "To be honest, it was a big 'fuck off!' to them all. I will repeat again that I decide what I do and I play not only in black metal groups." [...] The band also asked Hellhammer to play live for them, but Blomberg refused. Hellhammer also went to state: [...] "In my opinion, black metal today is just music. I will tell you that neither I nor other members of Mayhem never really were against religion or something <b>else.</b> <b>We</b> are primarily interested in music." [...] Ronny Hansen commented on Blomberg's appearance: ...|$|E
500|$|Casting {{announcements}} {{began in}} June 2009 when Noah Wyle was announced as the lead. Wyle, {{who worked with}} TNT on the Librarian films, was sent scripts for various shows on their network. He said {{part of the reason}} he chose the part was to gain credibility from his children. [...] "With the birth of my kids, I started to really look at my career through their eyes more than my own, so that does dictate choice, steering me toward certain things and away from other things," [...] he said. He also decided to do it as he could relate with his character, stating [...] "I identified with Tom's devotion to his sons, and admired his sense of social duty." [...] Spielberg wanted Wyle for the role because he knew him from his previous series ER, which Spielberg's company produced. He had wanted Wyle to appear in his 1998 film Saving Private Ryan but due to scheduling conflicts, he was unable to star. Spielberg stated that he was determined to work with him again. In July 2009, Moon Bloodgood, Jessy Schram, Seychelle Gabriel and Maxim Knight were cast as Anne Glass, Karen Nadler, Lourdes and Matt Mason, respectively. Bloodgood, the female lead, did not have to audition for the role. She received the script and was offered the role. Bloodgood was drawn to the role because of Spielberg and Rodat's involvement. She stated: [...] "Well certainly when you get handed a script and they tell you it’s Bob Rodat and Steven Spielberg, you’re immediately drawn to it. It’s got your attention. I was a little cautious about wanting to do science fiction again. But {{it was more of a}} drama story, more of a family story. I liked that and I wanted to work with Spielberg." [...] Bloodgood added that portraying a doctor excited her. [...] "I liked the idea of playing a doctor and deviating from something I had done already," [...] she said. In August 2009, Drew Roy and Peter Shinkoda were cast as Hal Mason and Dai, respectively. Drew Roy's agent received the script and the pair joked that Roy might get the role. [...] "This one came to me through my agent, just like everything <b>else.</b> <b>We</b> even joked about the fact that it was a Steven Spielberg project. We were like, [...] "Oh yeah, I might have a chance." [...] We were just joking." [...] He auditioned four times for the part. [...] "The whole process went on for quite some time, and then towards the end, it was down to me and one other guy, and we were literally waiting for the word from Steven Spielberg ‘cause he had to watch the two audition tapes and give the okay. That, in and of itself, had me like, [...] "Okay, even if I don’t get it, that’s just cool." [...] Fortunately, it went my way." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1916, Weber {{explained}} her {{philosophy of}} directing films: [...] "I'll never {{be convinced that}} the general public does not want serious entertainment rather than frivolous", and [...] "A real director should be absolute.
