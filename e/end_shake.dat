40|$|Historically {{explosion}} {{accidents are}} linked with energetic materials. There is the further belief, that the proneness to accidents-and their severity-is {{linked with the}} sensitivity of these explosives. Consequently there exist seemingly very insensitive materials {{for which it is}} believed that their accidental explosion can be ignored, so that safety distances can be reduced to those that apply to materials for which the hazard is assumed to be mass fire rather than mass detonation. Evidence is presented here that shows these assumptions to be invalid. Reports of explosion accidents are gathered here for substances that are not generally considered to be explosives (non UN-class 1 substances, like ammonium nitrate (AN), neat alkali metal chlorates, and even hypochlorites and nitromethane). In most of these cases the proneness of accidents had not been foreseen by testing. The basic explosion mechanisms are of a more general nature than simply those that apply to high exp losives. Explosion is not solely a matter of energy, but of any physical power conversion. In order to prove this, a survey of explosion events is given: Natural events, like the impacts of celestial bodies and volcanic eruptions. Fuel/liquid interactions in nature are industrial risks too, which occur at very different occasions and sites: Cellulose processing, the oil industry, foundries, power stations, explosions of hot cinders, chemical processing, fire extinguishing, and (most common) in the kitchen, and (most catastrophic) in nuclear reactors. Explosions of similar type are Hydraulic Transients, Bubble resonance explosions with the possibility of associated chemical room explosions (BLEVE), Rollovers. Second order effects are sorption/desorption resonance explosions, which most powerful also occur in nature (Nios Lake (CO 2 -release), Kivu Lake, Monoun Lake, 1984, Tanganjika Lake, all in Africa, and the Ocracoke in the Gulf of Mexico (CH 4 -release) -and at the lowest <b>end</b> <b>shaken</b> champagne bottles...|$|R

40|$|Newmark {{method of}} slope {{displacement}} analysis {{has been extensively}} applied in many slope stability analyses. However, there are some limitations in Newmark method {{that may lead to}} non-conservative predictions of slope displacements. To provide more realistic predictions of slope displacements, these limitations are considered throughout the study for enhancing Newmark method. The following additions to the original Newmark method have been included in this study: 1) accounting for seismically induced excess pore water pressure build-up, 2) accounting for excess pore water pressure dissipation after the <b>end</b> of <b>shaking,</b> and 3) accounting for possibility of multiple failure surfaces. Those enhancements are briefly discussed hereafter. [...] During an earthquake, non-cohesive soils may experience considerable pore water pressure build-up, which in the limit can lead to a state of zero effective stress and soil liquefaction. Therefore, in such a case, an effective stress approach should be used because a total stress analysis may give highly under-conservative results. In the present effective stress approach, the effects of excess pore water pressure and subsequent changes in soil shear strength are considered. [...] Also, {{after the end of the}} strong shaking period, pore water pressure starts dissipating. Dissipation of excess pore water pressure causes the soil to regain part of its original shear strength and consequently, the yield acceleration increases and becomes positive. Therefore, in such a case, considering the effects of excess pore water pressure dissipation gives better estimation of permanent slope displacements after the <b>end</b> of <b>shaking.</b> In this study the effects of excess pore water pressure dissipation are also considered, based on the one-dimensional consolidation theory. [...] In homogeneous soil deposits the displacements are usually dist 1 ibuted with depth. For such situation, the rigid block assumption may induce significant differences between actual and predicted slope displacements. Therefore, two moving blocks have been considered to mitigate this limitation of Newmark method. The model is able to reproduce the gradual deformation of soil with depth and therefore provide a more realistic prediction for uniform sand deposits. [...] The proposed enhanced Newmark method has been implemented in a computer program...|$|R

40|$|Two correctly-scaled model {{cantilever}} {{retaining walls}} of different stiffnesses were tested under dynamic loading conditions in a centrifuge. A medium-dense fine sand was retained {{with a range}} of backfill slopes. For the centrifuge model, an earthquake-generating mechanism was designed to produce seismic shaking equivalent to that generated at ground surface in the epicentral area of an earthquake of approximate magnitude 5 – 5. The response of the model retaining walls to the input dynamic motion was measured by strain gauges, pressure transducers and accelerometers. From the measurements plots were constructed of moment, shear, pressure and displacement over the height of the walls as a function of time. The results are compared with calculations based on the quasi-static Mononobe-Okabe theory. Although the calculated resultant force is in reasonable agreement with the experiments, the moments can be substantially different. Residual values of all parameters at the <b>end</b> of <b>shaking</b> are considerably greater than the initial static values. It is recommended that dynamic behaviour be incorporated in the earthquake design of retaining walls...|$|R
