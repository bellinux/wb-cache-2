The race's defending champion Michael Andretti had secured six of his 40 career victories in Toronto and stated that he did not know if luck played a part but noted his <b>driving</b> <b>style</b> was suited to the circuit.

During the race, {{he was black}} flagged for his dangerous <b>driving</b> <b>style</b> and therefore disqualified; he did not immediately return to the pit lane as {{he was unaware of}} the regulations. Rindt entered several rallies with his Simca but did not achieve good results. It was only when he was provided with a race-prepared Alfa Romeo GT 1300 at cost price and with free servicing by a local dealer that he became more successful. In the Alfa Romeo, he achieved eight victories.|$|E
40|$|Driving styles {{have a great}} {{influence}} on vehicle fuel economy, active safety, and drivability. To recognize <b>driving</b> <b>styles</b> of path-tracking behaviors for different divers, a statistical pattern-recognition method is developed {{to deal with the}} uncertainty of <b>driving</b> <b>styles</b> or characteristics based on probability density estimation. First, to describe driver path-tracking styles, vehicle speed and throttle opening are selected as the discriminative parameters, and a conditional kernel density function of vehicle speed and throttle opening is built, respectively, to describe the uncertainty and probability of two representative <b>driving</b> <b>styles,</b> e. g., aggressive and normal. Meanwhile, a posterior probability of each element in feature vector is obtained using full Bayesian theory. Second, a Euclidean distance method is involved to decide to which class the driver should be subject instead of calculating the complex covariance between every two elements of feature vectors. By comparing the Euclidean distance between every elements in feature vector, <b>driving</b> <b>styles</b> are classified into seven levels ranging from low normal to high aggressive. Subsequently, to show benefits of the proposed pattern-recognition method, a cross-validated method is used, compared with a fuzzy logic-based pattern-recognition method. The experiment results show that the proposed statistical pattern-recognition method for <b>driving</b> <b>styles</b> based on kernel density estimation is more efficient and stable than the fuzzy logic-based method.

40|$|AbstractThis study {{attempted}} to investigate fuel economy performance of hybrid vehicles under real-world driving conditions in Bangkok. The effect of traffic conditions and <b>driving</b> <b>styles</b> {{were taken into}} account. To cover the variations in traffic conditions, city, suburban and highway traffic were selected to represent the variety of traffic flow. For the effect of <b>driving</b> <b>styles,</b> the experiment was conducted by four experienced drivers, two aggressive and two normal-calm drivers. Statistical parameters, average speed and acceleration noise, were employed to quantify and analyse the impact of Bangkok traffic conditions and <b>driving</b> <b>styles</b> on both vehicles’ fuel consumption. This study integrated microtrip segmentation technique into the data analysis. Experimental results illustrated that HVs were capable of reducing fuel consumption of CVs in all traffic conditions and <b>driving</b> <b>styles</b> covered by this study. Particularly in the congested traffic in Bangkok, HVs potentially decreased the fuel consumption by a maximum of 47. 3 %. More importantly, HVs greatly mitigated the effect of aggressiveness on excessive fuel consumption in practical driving habits, although {{they appeared to be}} more sensitive to aggressiveness than CVs...|$|R
40|$|With {{automated}} driving {{being on the}} cusp of wide spread market introduction (Rivera & van der Meulen, 2014), Human Factors aspect of design and evaluation of the exact behaviour of automated vehicles gains crucial importance. Safety margins determine an envelope of possible trajectories for the automated vehicle, but as of today, the parameterisation of the vehicle’s behaviour within that envelope to create attractive <b>driving</b> <b>styles</b> has has not received wide spread attention yet (Scherer et al., 2015). However, for acceptance of {{automated driving}} functions, deemed critical to deliver the promised reduction in accident numbers, it is essential to design automated <b>driving</b> <b>styles</b> that win end users over to activate them on public roads. In two consecutive studies we investigated how to measure preferences for automated <b>driving</b> <b>styles,</b> whether or not drivers prefer being driven similar to their own driving, or if at least default styles can be created {{that a majority of the}} users enjoy. In a first study 43 subjects drove in three scenarios on a two-lane motorway in a motion-based driving simulator. Users were instructed to drive at 120 km/h, forcing them to overtake slower vehicles on the right lane. The scenarios were varied regarding the presence and behaviour of faster cars on the left lane, compelling subjects to decide on timing and execution of overtaking manoeuvres. Based on the data from this study, four prototypical <b>driving</b> <b>styles</b> were extracted, using a multivariate time-series clustering algorithm (Griesche et al., 2014). In a second study, 35 subjects from study 1 rated the attractiveness of the prototypical <b>driving</b> <b>styles</b> gained from that study, in addition to their own style. Using a Best-Worst-Scaling technique, preferences for either one of the prototypical <b>driving</b> <b>styles</b> or their own style could be measured. The results indicate that i) many but not all subjects do like their own styles, but not in every situation, and ii) certain styles exist which are preferred by the great majority of the users...|$|R

40|$|A rapid pattern-recognition {{approach}} to characterize driver's curve-negotiating behavior is proposed. To shorten the recognition time {{and improve the}} recognition of <b>driving</b> <b>styles,</b> a k-means clustering-based support vector machine (kMC-SVM) method is developed and used for classifying drivers into two types: aggressive and moderate. First, vehicle speed and throttle opening are treated as the feature parameters to reflect the <b>driving</b> <b>styles.</b> Second, to discriminate driver curve-negotiating behaviors and {{reduce the number of}} support vectors, the k-means clustering method is used to extract and gather the two types of driving data and shorten the recognition time. Then, based on the clustering results, a support vector machine approach is utilized to generate the hyperplane for judging and predicting to which types the human driver are subject. Lastly, to verify the validity of the kMC-SVM method, a cross-validation experiment is designed and conducted. The research results show that the $ k $MC-SVM is an effective method to classify <b>driving</b> <b>styles</b> with a short time, compared with SVM method. Comment: 6 pages, 9 figures, 2 tables.

25|$|Gurney was {{particularly}} noted for an exceptionally fluid <b>driving</b> <b>style.</b> On rare occasions, as when his car fell behind with minor mechanical troubles {{and he felt}} he had nothing to lose, he would abandon his classic technique and adopt a more aggressive (and riskier) style. This circumstance produced what many observers consider the finest driving performance of his career, when a punctured tire put him nearly two laps down halfway through the 1967 Rex Mays 300 Indycar race at Riverside, California. He produced an inspired effort, made up the deficit and won the race with a dramatic last-lap pass of runner-up Bobby Unser.|$|E

Watching the dance floor at all times for a reaction, working out a more rhythmically <b>driving</b> <b>style</b> of music that was neither country nor blues, but had elements of both, Perkins kept reshaping these loosely structured songs until he had a completed composition, which would then be finally put to paper. Carl was already sending demos to New York record companies, who kept rejecting him, sometimes explaining that this strange new style of country with a pronounced rhythm fit no current commercial trend. That would change in 1955 after recording the song 'Blue Suede Shoes' (recorded 19 December 1955). Later made more famous by Elvis Presley, Perkins' original version was an early rock 'n' roll standard.|$|E

Her smooth, precise <b>driving</b> <b>style</b> was ideally suited to these single-run events where a mistake, unlike in a multiple-lap circuit race, could not be cancelled out by better driving later in the event. In addition to the little Cooper — painted in her own shade of dark powder-blue, which came to be known by others as Burt blue, with white trim — Patsy Burt also raced a 1500cc Porsche RS in 1961, becoming the first British competitor ever to complete a full season in the European Mountain Championship.|$|E

25|$|In {{the final}} stages of the season it was clear that Montoya and his car were finally adapted to one another. The Colombian has often {{attributed}} this to the greater effort made by the McLaren team than by Williams to tune the car to his <b>driving</b> <b>style.</b> In the last 7 grands prix Montoya finished, he scored 3 wins, 2 poles and 5 podiums, as well as setting a track record(fastest lap) of 1:24.770, which stands today still, at the 2005 Turkish Grand Prix. At the Brazilian GP, Montoya led home McLaren's first 1–2 result in years, ahead of newly crowned world champion Fernando Alonso in third. It was his last finish of the year. In Japan he was forced off the track by Jacques Villeneuve on lap one, while in China a loose drain cover rose up and hit his car, damaging the engine.

40|$|Hybrid {{electric}} vehicles (HEVs) {{are considered to}} be one of the energy-efficient technologies for near-term sustainability of the transportation sector. Over the years, research has focused on improving fuel economy (FE) for a given drive cycle, but FE variability over a realistic range of real-world driving patterns has been generally overlooked, and this can lead to FE benefits not being fully realized in real-world usage. No systematic methodology exists to reduce FE variability by design optimization of powertrain components. This study proposes a methodology of powertrain component optimization to reduce the FE variability due to variations in driving patterns. In the proposed methodology, powertrain components are optimum over a range of driving patterns of different traffic conditions and <b>driving</b> <b>styles</b> simultaneously.

500|$|The {{cars were}} {{modified}} BT46s—chassis numbers BT46/4 and BT46/6. Modifications {{to implement the}} fan concept were quite extensive—involving sealing the engine bay as well as adding the clutch system and the fan. They were designed and tested in some secrecy. Brabham's lead driver, Niki Lauda, realised he had to adjust his <b>driving</b> <b>style,</b> mostly for cornering. He found that if he accelerated around corners, the car would [...] "stick" [...] to the road {{as if it were}} on rails. This had the side effect of exposing the driver to very high lateral acceleration, which would become a major problem in the ground effect era. In his autobiography, Lauda described the car as being unpleasant to drive due to the lateral loads and reliance on aerodynamics over driver skill. He realised early on that the rate of ground effect development meant that in the future, every driver would be exposed to such g-loading while behind the wheel of such a car, and the physical effort needed to drive the cars would leave the drivers exhausted {{by the end of the}} races.|$|E
