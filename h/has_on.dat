5|$|Discectomy (the partial {{removal of}} a disc that is causing leg pain) can provide pain relief sooner than nonsurgical treatments.

5|$|European {{occupation}} of Australia <b>has,</b> <b>on</b> the whole, benefited black-shouldered kites through land clearing and irrigation for agriculture and grain harvesting and storage practices which provide suitable conditions for much {{larger numbers of}} mice. According to raptor researcher Dr Stephen Debus, this species did not suffer from eggshell thinning {{during the period of}} DDT use in Australia, though he believes it is possible that secondary poisoning may occur from rodenticides used during mouse plagues or from pesticides used during locust plagues. Populations in areas with high sheep and rabbit numbers may decline, as these animals compact the soil and reduce the available habitat for mice.|$|E
5|$|In 1927, Schweppes {{acquired}} from the Burrows family Pewtress Spring, in Colwall, {{on the western}} side of the Herefordshire Beacon, approximately two miles from Colwall village. The source here emerges at the fault line between the Silurian thrust and the Precambrian diorite and granite above it. The spring was renamed Primeswell Spring, and in 1929 Schweppes commenced bottling. The factory employed 25 people who filled 26 million bottles annually. It was operated by Coca-Cola Enterprises Ltd., and the water was sold under the Schweppes brand name. On 20 October 2010 Coca-Cola Enterprises, who owned the Malvern brand, announced that production would be ceasing as of 3 November 2010. This decision, which was widely criticised both in the town and beyond, was due to the declining market share Malvern <b>has</b> <b>on</b> the overall water market. On 28 October 2011, it was reported that the bottling plant is being sold to a property company.|$|E

5|$|Individuals {{with severe}} mental illness, {{including}} schizophrenia, {{are at a}} significantly greater risk of being victims of both violent and non-violent crime. Schizophrenia {{has been associated with}} a higher rate of violent acts, but most appear to be related to associated substance abuse. Rates of homicide linked to psychosis are similar to those linked to substance misuse, and parallel the overall rate in a region. What role schizophrenia <b>has</b> <b>on</b> violence independent of drug misuse is controversial, but certain aspects of individual histories or mental states may be factors. About 11% of people in prison for homicide have schizophrenia while 21% have mood disorders. Another study found about 8-10% of people with schizophrenia had committed a violent act in the past year compared to 2% of the general population.|$|E

5|$|It is {{probable}} that the planet is composed of hydrogen and helium. The planet orbits on the same plane as Kepler-9b, a second and larger gas giant located in the Kepler-9 system. While observing the planet, the Kepler team noticed that Kepler-9b and c orbited in a 1:2 ratio, where Kepler-9b orbits its star every 19 days and Kepler-9c orbits every 38 days. The gravitational pull that each planet <b>has</b> <b>on</b> the other, known as orbital resonance, keeps the planets in a stable orbit. This phenomenon {{is the first of}} its kind seen outside the Solar System. Every time Kepler-9c completed an orbit during the observation period, its orbital period decreased by about 39 minutes. At some point, however, this trend will reverse and its orbit will increase. The lengths of its orbit will oscillate slightly above and below the 2:1 ratio.|$|E

5|$|Some psychologists {{believe that}} 'while object {{permanence}} alone may not predict communicative achievement, object permanence {{along with several}} other sensorimotor milestones, plays a critical role in, and interacts with, the communicative development of children with severe disabilities'. This was observed in 2006, in a study recognizing where the full mastery of object permanence {{is one of the}} milestones that ties into a child's ability to engage in mental representation. Along with the relationship with language acquisition, object permanence is also related to the achievement of self-recognition. This same study also focused specifically on the effects that Down syndrome <b>has</b> <b>on</b> object permanence. They found that the reason why the children that participated were so successful in acquiring object permanence, was due to their social strength in imitation. Along with imitation being a potential factor in the success, another factor that could impact children with Down syndrome could also be the willingness of the child to cooperate.|$|E
