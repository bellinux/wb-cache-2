5|$|By {{the time}} the Second World War had {{finished}} the Albert Dock's future looked bleak. The owners of the dock, the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board (MDHB) were in financial crisis and chose not to repair any of the wartime bomb damage, adopting an attitude of 'if it's not broke don't fix <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> <b>if</b> it is broke we still won't fix it'. At {{the same time a}} change in geo-political orientation towards Europe, coupled with the advent of containerisation meant the whole docking system in the city of Liverpool suffered as newer, stronger ports emerged elsewhere in the UK. Nonetheless the architectural and technological value of the docks was recognised in 1952 when the Albert Dock was granted Grade I listed building status.|$|E
5|$|The Senate-passed bill {{then was}} {{transmitted}} to the House of Representatives, and was referred to the Coinage Committee on February 20. It was brought forward on February 27, 1925. When the Speaker, Frederick H. Gillett, {{asked if there was}} objection to the consideration of the bill, Ohio's James T. Begg wanted to know if there was anyone present who could give him information about <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> <b>if</b> there was not, he would object. Kvale stated that he could, and when Begg inquired if Treasury Secretary Andrew W. Mellon favored the bill, he assured the Ohioan that this was so. Kvale had the Senate-passed bill substituted for the one he had introduced, and it received the House's endorsement without objection or amendment. It was passed into law with the signature of President Calvin Coolidge on March 2, 1925.|$|E

In the scientific literature, there is a strong consensus that global surface temperatures have increased in recent decades and that the trend is caused by human-induced emissions of greenhouse gases. No scientific body of national or international standing disagrees with this view, though a few organizations with members in extractive industries hold non-committal positions. Disputes over the key scientific facts of global warming are more prevalent in the media than in the scientific literature, where such issues are treated as resolved, and such disputes are more prevalent in the United States than globally.|$|E
25|$|On 15 February 2013, a {{poll was}} opened {{allowing}} players {{to decide whether}} Jagex should open a separate incarnation of RuneScape from August 2007. Old School RuneScape was opened to paying subscribers on 22 February 2013 after the poll received 50,000 votes, and a free-to-play version was later released on 19 February 2015. It was originally created as an exact copy of RuneScape from August 2007 and receives regular content additions. Old School RuneScape is entirely community based; for any proposed update or idea to pass into the game, it needs at least 75% {{of the community to}} vote Yes for <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> <b>if</b> it does not pass it will either be dropped or reconstructed and re-polled so that the players may find the update more acceptable. On 17 July 2017, Jagex announced the development of a mobile version of Old School Runescape.|$|E
25|$|Richer {{wrote about}} another of Gerbert's last armillary spheres, which had {{sighting}} tubes {{fixed on the}} axis of the hollow sphere that could observe the constellations, the forms of which he hung on iron and copper wires. This armillary sphere was also described by Gerbert {{in a letter to}} his colleague Constantine. Gerbert instructed Constantine that, if doubtful of the position of the pole star, he should fix the sighting tube of the armillary sphere into position to view the star he suspected was <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> <b>if</b> the star did not move out of sight, it was thus the pole star. Furthermore, Gerbert instructed Constantine that the north pole could be measured with the upper and lower sighting tubes, the Arctic Circle through another tube, the Tropic of Cancer through another tube, the equator through another tube, and the Tropic of Capricorn through another tube.|$|E

NBC reported losing $500,000 in advertising revenue. Speaking of this loss, then-NBC president Warren Littlefield said, at odds with NBC's earlier denial of possible revenue loss being a factor in its scheduling decision, [...] "There are few things in broadcasting that we know for sure, {{and one of those}} is that when you do an episode of any series that deals with AIDS, {{there is going to be}} advertiser sensitivity to <b>it.</b> <b>And</b> <b>if</b> you choose to do it anyway, you better count on losing money." ...|$|E

I think a less courageous director than Tom [...] – and indeed a less courageous actor than Colin [...] – might have felt the need to slightly sanitise the degree and authenticity of that stammer, and I'm really really pleased that neither of them did." [...] In May 2011 Firth said he was finding traces of the stammer difficult to eliminate: [...] "You can probably hear even from this interview, there are moments when it’s quite infectious," [...] he said. [...] "You find yourself doing <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>if</b> I start thinking about it the worse it gets. If nothing else it’s an insight into what it feels like." ...|$|E

[...] Following the plane crash, Goldstein was prescribed painkillers and anti-anxiety medication. Celebrity doctor Drew Pinsky said it was those prescriptions which opened the [...] "floodgates" [...] to Goldstein's relapse. A friend of his reached the same conclusion, saying: [...] "I think the plane crash killed him, it just took a year for it to do it." [...] As a result of the plane crash, Goldstein developed a fear of flying, and continued consuming anxiety medication to help deal with the regular flights his lifestyle required.|$|E

500|$|Alabama Governor Thomas Kilby had a three-member {{commission}} {{headed by}} Marie Bankhead Owen decide what design {{the state should}} recommend for the coins, and it solicited proposals from the public, but rejected all submissions. [...] On June 1, 1920, Owen proposed to Kilby that one side have a depiction of the Alabama Capitol building and the other jugate heads of James Monroe (president {{at the time of}} Alabama's admission in 1819) and Woodrow Wilson (president in 1919). Kilby sent the proposal, which included rough sketches, to the Director of the Mint, Raymond T. Baker, who forwarded it to the Commission of Fine Arts for its opinion. Its sculptor-member, James Earle Fraser, designer of the Buffalo nickel, disliked the capitol as a subject, feeling that buildings never translated well to coins. When this went back through channels to Owen, her committee reconsidered the building, and on June 24 she wrote to Baker substituting a design based on the Seal of Alabama, focused upon the eagle that was then a part of <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> <b>if</b> that was not acceptable, Owen suggested the design of the half dollar current in 1819. There the matter rested for an entire year.|$|E
500|$|The console {{version of}} Crash Nitro Kart {{received}} mixed to positive reviews upon release. Manny LaMancha of GamePro {{concluded that the}} gameplay of Crash Nitro Kart was addictive though not innovative. [...] said that Crash Nitro Kart was [...] "satisfying and challenging at the same time" [...] and [...] "a great way to fill that need for speed." [...] Nintendo Power praised the karts as [...] "fast" [...] and the power-ups as [...] "creative". Official PlayStation Magazine concluded that [...] "Vicarious Visions did all it could to emulate the Naughty Dog classic (Crash Team Racing) and just added a PS2 coat of paint." [...] Play magazine said that the game was [...] "a little generic and heavily recycled, but the powerslide system from CTR pulls it together." [...] Matt Helgeson of Game Informer dismissed the game as [...] "probably {{one of the least}} exciting racing titles I've played recently." [...] Demian Linn of Electronic Gaming Monthly noted that the gameplay was [...] "nearly identical to Crash Team Racing's, even down to the speed-boosting wumpa fruits, so if you loved it before, you'll still love <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> <b>if</b> not... not." ...|$|E
500|$|For many years, Aigler was {{an outspoken}} {{opponent}} of athletic scholarships. In 1939, the Michigan Student Senate adopted a resolution favoring tuition scholarships for varsity athletes {{with at least}} a [...] "B" [...] average. The resolution was intended to rid college sports of unseemly under-the-table subsidies and to provide a [...] "fair return for services" [...] to the athletes who made possible the [...] "big business" [...] of college sports. Aigler opposed the move, saying: [...] "You can't give athletic scholarships without aspiring to the sigma of professionalism[...] [...] [...] Other schools have tried <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> <b>if</b> the practice enjoys widespread continuance, it will prove the doom of collegiate sport." [...] Aigler argued that scholarships were a form of payment that undermined the concept of the unpaid student athlete. He said: [...] "Those college teams made up of scholarship holders and the like should be grouped with the Giants, Redskins, Bears, etc., instead of with those teams made up of bona fide college students to whom athletic participation must be secondary." [...] On another occasion, he urged schools granting athletic scholarships, though [...] "ostensibly amateur", to [...] "turn square and associate themselves with the Washington Redskins and Green Bay Packers." ...|$|E

500|$|As the googly {{caused a}} {{sensation}} following its invention, many other cricketers tried to emulate Bosanquet. Reggie Schwarz, the South African cricketer {{who played for}} Middlesex, learned how to bowl the googly through observation of Bosanquet; Schwarz in turn {{passed it on to}} the South African bowlers Aubrey Faulkner, Bert Vogler and Gordon White. These four raised the bowling of the googly to a high standard and raised fears of the detrimental effect it would have on batting. Following the development of googly bowling by South Africans, it was further refined by English and Australian cricketers until it became firmly established. In later years, the googly was blamed for a deterioration in the quality and attractiveness of batting. Bosanquet refused to accept any blame and published a defence in The Morning Post during 1924, later reprinted in Wisden, which humorously downplayed the impact of the googly. He wrote: [...] "It is not for me to defend it. Other and more capable hands have taken it up and exploited <b>it,</b> <b>and,</b> <b>if</b> blame is to be allotted, let it be on their shoulders. For me is the task of the historian, and if I appear too much {{in the role of the}} proud parent, I ask forgiveness." ...|$|E
500|$|Through a Glass Darkly is a long, complex {{narrative}} that {{features more than}} 60 characters and at least 15 subplots. The title of the novel comes from the Bible verse 1 Corinthians 13. Before she began writing it, Koen envisioned creating {{a story about the}} relationship between a young woman and an older man, a plot element riddled with emotional tension that required much planning and foresight. Koen also sought to create a story that featured issues relevant to contemporary women, such as the non-existence of [...] "legal rights. If a husband wanted to beat his wife to death he could do <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> <b>if</b> her parents didn't care... No birth control. If you had any normal sexual urges you were pregnant all the time, and half the women died in childbirth. Life was very violent and short and I just wanted to show how it was without getting up on a soapbox, so someone reading it would say, 'I'm glad I live now.'" [...] According to Koen, another consistent theme throughout Through a Glass Darkly is how vital family is to our well-being, family in this case being a loose term that does not necessarily equate to being biologically-related. She was also interested in writing how people are connected to each other.|$|E
500|$|Lincoln's reply {{would become}} famous, {{much more so}} than the prayer that {{provoked}} it. [...] "My paramount object in this struggle is to save the Union, and is not either to save or to destroy slavery. If I could save the Union without freeing any slave, I would do <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> <b>if</b> I could save it by freeing all the slaves I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone I would also do that. What I do about slavery, and the colored race, I do because it helps to save the Union; and what I forbear, I forbear because I do not believe it would help to save the Union." [...] Lincoln's statement angered abolitionists; William Seward's wife Frances complained to her husband that Lincoln had made it seem [...] "that the mere keeping together a number of states is more important than human freedom." [...] Greeley felt Lincoln had not truly answered him, [...] "but I'll forgive him everything if he'll issue the proclamation". When Lincoln did, on September 22, Greeley hailed the Emancipation Proclamation as a [...] "great boon of freedom". According to Williams, [...] "Lincoln's war for Union was now also Greeley's war for emancipation." ...|$|E
