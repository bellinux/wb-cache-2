500|$|Smith {{graduated}} from Hampshire College in Amherst, Massachusetts in 1991 {{with a degree}} in philosophy and political science. [...] "Went straight through in four years", he explained to Under the Radar in 2003. [...] "I guess it proved to myself that I could do something I really didn't want to for four years. Except I did like what I was studying. At the time it seemed like, 'This is your one and only chance {{to go to college and}} you had just better do it because some day you might wish that you did.' Plus, the whole reason I applied in the first place was because of my girlfriend, and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>gotten</b> accepted already even though we had broken up before the first day." [...] After he graduated, he [...] "worked in a bakery back in Portland with a bachelor's degree in philosophy and legal theory".|$|E
500|$|Gosling was {{scheduled}} to begin filming The Lovely Bones in 2007. However, he left the production two days before filming began because of [...] "creative differences" [...] {{and was replaced by}} Mark Wahlberg. Gosling had been cast as the father of the murdered teenage girl and initially felt he was too young for the role. The director Peter Jackson and the producer Fran Walsh persuaded him that he could be aged with hair and make-up changes. Before shooting began, Gosling gained 60 pounds in weight and grew a beard to appear older. Walsh then [...] "began to feel he was not right. It was our blindness, the desire to make it work no matter what." [...] Gosling later said, [...] "We didn't talk very much during the preproduction process, which was the problem ... I just showed up on set, and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>gotten</b> it wrong. Then I was fat and unemployed." [...] He has said the experience was [...] "an important realisation for me: not to let your ego get involved. It's OK to be too young for a role." ...|$|E
2500|$|In his memoirs, Dodd {{described}} Mrs. Parker accordingly: [...] "As {{a teacher}} , I {{had taught her}} how to speak; as a legislator, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>gotten</b> her a scholarship that gave her a college education; and as lieutenant governor, I had found her a big job in our administration. She was a wonderful speaker and a good administrator, but she must have been a born ingrate." ...|$|E

2500|$|At {{the same}} Olympics, Ullrich {{finished}} 1st in the men's road race and 2nd in the men's time trial race. Unlike Armstrong, {{he said that}} he refused to return his medals if he was stripped of his finishes. In an interview with Sky Sports he said: [...] "Almost everyone at the time was taking performance-enhancing substances. I didn’t take anything that was not taken by the others. It would only have been cheating for me if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>gotten</b> an advantage which was not the case. I just wanted to ensure I had an equal opportunity." [...] To date, Ullrich has not been stripped of his finishes.|$|E
2500|$|Wilson's {{response}} {{when asked about}} LSD and [...] "Hang On to Your Ego" [...] was: [...] "I had taken a few drugs, and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>gotten</b> {{into that kind of}} thing. I guess it just came up naturally." [...] Despite concerns over the song's drug references, the key lyric [...] "they trip through the day and waste all their thoughts at night" [...] was kept for the final version. Elsewhere for [...] "Sloop John B", Wilson's lyric change from [...] "this is the worst trip since I've been born" [...] to [...] "this is the worst trip I've ever been on" [...] has also been suggested to be another subtle nod to acid culture.|$|E
2500|$|With the {{intention}} of counteracting the [...] "star" [...] cult faction that had begun to form around him, Clapton assembled a new band composed of Delaney and Bonnie's former rhythm section, Bobby Whitlock as keyboardist and vocalist, Carl Radle as the bassist, and drummer Jim Gordon, with Clapton playing guitar. It was his intention {{to show that he}} need not fill a starring role, and functioned well as a member of an ensemble. During this period, Clapton was increasingly influenced by The Band and their album Music from Big Pink, saying, [...] "What I appreciated about the Band was that they were more concerned with songs and singing. They would have three- and four-part harmonies, and the guitar was put back into perspective as being accompaniment. That suited me well, because <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>gotten</b> so tired of the virtuosity—or pseudo-virtuosity—thing of long, boring guitar solos just because they were expected. The Band brought things back into perspective. The priority was the song." ...|$|E

2500|$|On February 2, 2000, George W. Bush, as {{candidate}} for President, spoke during school's chapel hour. Bush gave a standard stump speech making no specific {{reference to the}} university. His political opponents quickly noted his non-mention of the university's ban on interracial dating. During the Michigan primary, Bush was also criticized for not stating {{his opposition to the}} university's anti-Catholicism. (The John McCain campaign targeted Catholics with a [...] "Catholic Voter Alert," [...] phone calls reminding voters of Bush's visit to BJU.) Bush denied that he either knew of or approved what he regarded as BJU's intolerant policies. On February 26, Bush issued a formal letter of apology to Cardinal John Joseph O'Connor of New York for failing to denounce Bob Jones University's history of anti-Catholic statements. At a news conference following the letter's release, Bush said, [...] "I make no excuses. I had an opportunity and I missed it. I regret that....I wish <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>gotten</b> up then and seized the moment to set a tone, a tone that I had set in Texas, a positive and inclusive tone." [...] Also during the 2000 Republican primary campaign in South Carolina, Richard Hand, a BJU professor, spread a false e-mail rumor that John McCain had fathered an illegitimate child. (The McCains have an adopted daughter from Bangladesh, and later push polling also implied that the child was biracial.) ...|$|E

5000|$|... "I'm {{a really}} good driver. In the past thirty years, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> only four {{speeding}} tickets"* This statement is true, but irrelevant if the speaker started driving a week ago.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{far from}} being certain of that; for, somehow Howel has taken up the notion that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> a grudge against England, and he listens to all I say with {{distrust}} and distaste." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{are going}} back," [...] he reasoned. [...] "I suppose now <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> away from them, Merwell and Jasniff {{will return to}} the academy as fast as they can, and Shime and the doctor will return to Rockville; and they'll all play the innocent." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's too bad it happened!" [...] murmured Dave. [...] "I wish <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>gotten</b> {{off to the}} West {{without seeing}} Aaron Poole. But I suppose there is no use in crying over spilt milk. I'll {{have to face the}} music, and take what comes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{to think}} o' the weary walk they hae gien us," [...] {{answered}} Mrs. Howden, with a groan; [...] "and sic a comfortable window as <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>gotten,</b> too, just within a penny-stane-cast of the scaffold--I could hae heard every word the minister said--and to pay twalpennies for my stand, and a' for naething!" ...|$|E
60|$|We rode up {{the east}} slope of Beaver Dam Canyon, through the forest, and {{out along the}} rim {{for five or six}} miles, way {{on the other side of}} the {{promontory}} where <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>gotten</b> lost. Here Haught left us, taking with him R.C. and Lee and Nielsen, all of whom were to have stands along the rim. We hoped to start a bear and chase him round under the high points toward Horton Thicket.|$|E

Speaking of her third fragrance, Rihanna told Women's Wear Daily, [...] "When creating my first scent, Reb'l Fleur, I {{wanted it to}} be a really strong scent - daring and bold. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> more personal with Nude." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{ran back}} to the fort, and when <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>gotten</b> my drum the three {{companies}} were falling into line, the men murmuring in undertones among themselves. They were brought to attention. Colonel Clark was seen {{to come out of the}} commandant's house, and we watched him furtively as he walked slowly to his place in front of the line. A tremor of excitement went from sergeant to drummer boy. The sentries closed the big gates of the fort.|$|E
60|$|The {{people of}} the inn were in a great hurry, the packet-boat from Holland being just come in, and two coaches just come also with {{passengers}} from London, for another packet-boat that was going off for Holland, which coaches were to go back next day with the passengers that were just landed. In this hurry it was not much minded that I came {{to the bar and}} paid my reckoning, telling my landlady <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>gotten</b> my passage by sea in a wherry.|$|E
60|$|I {{continued}} {{this work}} every day to the 15th of June, except the time necessary to get food, which I always appointed, during this part of my employment, to be when the tide was up, that I might be ready when it was ebbed out; and by this time <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>gotten</b> timber, and plank, and iron-work enough to have built a good boat, if I had known how; and also I got at several times, and in several pieces, near one hundred weight of the sheet-lead.|$|E
6000|$|Suddenly {{a thought}} swept {{on the heels}} of my {{indolent}} and rather annoying realization. Could <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> from the Navajo what Jim and Jones so characteristically called [...] "'em"? I turned cold all over. And on the very instant I received another bite that burned like fire.|$|R

6000|$|I helped Copple heave {{the load}} on his saddle and tie it securely, and I got my hands red at the job, but I {{did not really}} look at the buck again. And upon {{our way back to}} camp I rode in the lead all the way. We reached camp before sunset, where I had to endure the felicitations of R.C. and my comrades, all of whom were delighted that at last <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>gotten</b> a buck. Takahashi smiled all over his broad brown face. [...] "My goodnish! I awful glad! Nice fat deer!" ...|$|E
60|$|Relaxing, I took a short rest. Then nerving {{myself to}} be {{indifferent}} to the pain, and yielding altogether to the brutal instinct this tuna-fighting rouses in a fisherman, I lay back with might and main. Eight times <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>gotten</b> the double line over the reel. On the ninth I shut down, clamped with my thumbs, and froze there. The wire leader sung like a telephone wire in the cold. I could scarcely see. My arms cracked. I felt an immense strain that must break me in an instant.|$|E
60|$|Finding {{all three}} of the pirates to be in such a complacent mood, I asked them for some of my clothes, for those that I had hung in tatters about me, and, as said before, I was in my bare feet. But this they would not do, Master Burke asking me whether they had not granted enough already, without giving me togs to cover my bloody carcass. Upon this I {{perceived}} that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>gotten</b> all that I was likely to obtain, and so had to go without my clothes.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you, sir.

5000|$|However, {{the word}} [...] "know" [...] in the King James Version {{has been used}} to refer to sexual intercourse.
