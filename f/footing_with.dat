5|$|Women {{appear to}} have been allowed {{considerable}} freedom and independence during this period. Dutthagamani frequently sought his mother's advice during his military campaign. Rock inscriptions show that women donated caves and temples {{for the use of the}} sangha. However, there are no records of women holding any administrative posts. It is not clear if women were given equal <b>footing</b> <b>with</b> men, but they did have complete freedom in religious matters.|$|E

Instant coffee was also used in reserve rations and trench rations. During World War II, the U.S. military again relied on Washington, but this time on an equal <b>footing</b> <b>with</b> the other major instant coffee brands that had emerged in the interwar period, most notably Nescafé, {{as well as the}} new companies formed to meet a renewed military demand.|$|E

5|$|The duel {{took place}} in Indiana on January 19, 1809, just across the Ohio River from Shippingport, Kentucky. Joseph Hamilton Daveiss {{provided}} the pistols. On the first shot, Marshall missed and Clay lightly grazed Marshall's stomach. Marshall missed again on the second shot, and Clay's pistol misfired. Marshall's third shot lightly wounded Clay in the thigh, while Clay missed Marshall entirely. Clay insisted that the two each take another shot, but Marshall declined on grounds that Clay's injury put him on unequal <b>footing</b> <b>with</b> his adversary, and the matter was ended.|$|E

5|$|In 1907, {{the journal}} Zoologica {{was founded by}} Osborn and Hornaday {{specifically}} as a place for Beebe to publish his research. The first {{issue of the journal}} contained twenty papers, ten of which were written by Beebe, and two more of which were jointly written by him and Lee Saunders Crandall, the zoo's assistant curator of birds. The following year Beebe received a promotion from the Zoological Society, placing him on equal <b>footing</b> <b>with</b> the research scientists at the Museum of Natural History. This promotion explicitly granted him two months off each year, for the purpose of further research expeditions. The first expedition conducted under his new privileges, beginning in February 1908, took him to Trinidad and Venezuela to research birds and insects. During this expedition Beebe captured 40 live birds for the zoo, belonging to 14 different species.|$|E
5|$|Soon, blue whales {{were being}} hunted off Iceland (1883), the Faroe Islands (1894), Newfoundland (1898), and Spitsbergen (1903). In 1904–05 the first blue whales were taken off South Georgia. By 1925, {{with the advent}} of the stern slipway in factory ships and the use of steam-driven whale catchers, the catch of blue whales, and baleen whales as a whole, in the Antarctic and sub-Antarctic began to {{increase}} dramatically. In the 1930–31 season, these ships caught 29,400 blue whales in the Antarctic alone. By the end of World War II, populations had been significantly depleted, and, in 1946, the first quotas restricting international trade in whales were introduced, but they were ineffective because of the lack of differentiation between species. Rare species could be hunted on an equal <b>footing</b> <b>with</b> those found in relative abundance.|$|E
5|$|The {{price of}} PV modules per MW {{has fallen by}} 60 percent since the summer of 2008, {{according}} to Bloomberg New Energy Finance estimates, putting solar power {{for the first time}} on a competitive <b>footing</b> <b>with</b> the retail price of electricity in a number of sunny countries. Wind turbine prices have also fallen – by 18 percent per MW in the last two years – reflecting, as with solar, fierce competition in the supply chain. Further improvements in the levelised cost of energy for solar, wind and other technologies lie ahead, posing a growing threat to the dominance of fossil fuel generation sources in the next few years.|$|E

5|$|The {{unity of}} NATO was {{breached}} early in its history, with a crisis occurring during Charles de Gaulle's presidency of France from 1958 onwards. De Gaulle protested at the United States' strong {{role in the}} organization and what he perceived as a special relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom. In a memorandum sent to President Dwight D.

5|$|From the 13th century onwards, the Court of Common Pleas could issue its own writs, {{and was not}} {{dependent}} on the Court of Chancery, where such documents usually originated. These were sealed with the Great Seal of the King until at least 1338, along with the seal of the justices; the Chancery writs had their own independent seal. Documents were, from 1350, considered acceptable if only marked with the seal of the justices. In 1344, the king created a separate seal for the Common Pleas, allowing them to process cases without involving the Chancery or the king. The court stood on an equal <b>footing</b> <b>with</b> the Exchequer of Pleas, Court of Chancery and King's Bench in relation to transferring cases between them. Any errors {{on the part of}} the Common Pleas would be corrected by the King's Bench through a separate action brought there. Thanks to the Bill of Middlesex and other legal fictions, the King's Bench gained much of the Common Pleas's jurisdiction, although the Common Pleas remained the sole place where real property claims could be brought.|$|E
5|$|On 19 December 1914, Abbas Helmi II was deposed by the United Kingdom {{while he}} was on a visit to Vienna due to his anti-British stance. The British severed Egypt's nominal ties to the Ottoman Empire, thus ending the country's status as a khedivate. Prime Minister Hussein Rushdi Pasha served as acting head of state until Abbas Helmi II's half-uncle Hussein Kamel was chosen as the country's new monarch. For a brief while, the British had {{considered}} putting an end to the Muhammad Ali Dynasty and installing Aga Khan III as ruler. Hussein Kamel took the title of Sultan of Egypt (preceded by the untranslatable style of Sa Hautesse), thereby putting him on an equal <b>footing</b> <b>with</b> the Ottoman Sultan. However, the end of nominal Ottoman suzerainty over Egypt did not result in genuine independence; the Sultanate of Egypt was a British protectorate where real power lay in the hand of the High Commissioner.|$|E

Med. 29, 15341541 (2012) Abstract Aims Custom-made {{therapeutic}} footwear {{is often}} prescribed to patients <b>with</b> diabetic neuropathy, <b>foot</b> deformity and a healed plantar foot ulcer. Offloading these feet {{is important to}} prevent ulcer recurrence. The aim was to evaluate the offloading effect of custom-made footwear in these patients. Methods In 171 patients with diabetic neuropathy (336 <b>feet)</b> <b>with</b> <b>foot</b> deformity and a recently healed plantar foot ulcer, plantar pressures walking barefoot and inside new custom-made footwear were measured. At the previous ulcer location and at locations of highest barefoot pressure attributable to the deformity, in-shoe pressures were compared <b>with</b> non-deformed <b>feet.</b> The footwear was considered effective in offloading when in-shoe peak pressure at these locations was < 200 kPa. Results Mean in-shoe peak pressures ranged between 211 and 308 kPa in <b>feet</b> <b>with</b> forefoot deformity (vs. 191222 kPa in non-deformed feet) and between 140 and 187 kPa in <b>feet</b> <b>with</b> midfoot deformity (vs. 112 kPa in non-deformed feet). Offloading was effective in 61 % of all <b>feet</b> <b>with</b> deformity, 81 % of <b>feet</b> <b>with</b> midfoot deformity, 44 % of <b>feet</b> <b>with</b> forefoot deformity and 62 % of previous ulcer locations. Inter-subject variability in measured in-shoe plantar pressure was large. Conclusions Offloading in custom-made footwear is often not sufficiently achieved in high-risk diabetic <b>feet</b> <b>with</b> deformity. Highest offloading success rates were seen at known high-risk locations such as previous ulcer locations and Charcot feet, the lowest success rates in forefoot deformities. Together with the large inter-subject variability in pressure outcomes, this emphasizes the need for evidence-based prescription and evaluation procedures to assure adequate offloadin...|$|R

5|$|States are {{the primary}} subdivisions of the United States, and possess a number of powers and rights under the United States Constitution, such as {{regulating}} intrastate commerce, running elections, creating local governments, and ratifying constitutional amendments. Each state has its own constitution, grounded in republican principles, and government, consisting of three branches: executive, legislative, and judicial. All states and their residents are represented in the federal Congress, a bicameral legislature consisting of the Senate and the House of Representatives. Each state is represented by two Senators, while Representatives are distributed among the states {{in proportion to the}} most recent constitutionally mandated decennial census. Additionally, each state is entitled to select a number of electors to vote in the Electoral College, the body that elects the President of the United States, equal to the total of Representatives and Senators in Congress from that state. Article IV, Section 3, Clause 1 of the Constitution grants to Congress the authority to admit new states into the Union. Since the establishment of the United States in 1776, the number of states has expanded from the original 13 to the current total of 50, and each new state is admitted on an equal <b>footing</b> <b>with</b> the existing states.|$|E
5|$|The Exchequer {{stood on}} an equal <b>footing</b> <b>with</b> the other Westminster courts (the Court of Common Pleas, Court of King's Bench and Court of Chancery), with cases {{transferred}} easily from one to another, although there were problems {{in the case of}} the Court of King's Bench. The traditional method for moving a case was the writ of supersedeas, but the King's Bench represented the monarch, who could not have writs placed against him. Instead, a clerk would bring the Red Book of the Exchequer to the King's Bench and assert that the case's claimant was an officer of the Exchequer, necessitating his trial there rather than in the King's Bench. The Exchequer maintained a clear rule with the other equity court, the Court of Chancery; a case heard in one could not be re-heard in the other. Apart from that, cases of equity could be heard by either court. The Exchequer had superior status over inferior courts of equity, able to take cases from them and countermand their decisions. The jurisdiction of ecclesiastical courts also overlapped with that of the Exchequer, particularly in relation to the collection of tithes, and there are many records of disputes between the two.|$|E
5|$|The first French Grand Prix {{originated}} from the Gordon Bennett races, established by American millionaire James Gordon Bennett, Jr. in 1900. Intended to encourage automobile industries through sport, by 1903 the Gordon Bennett races had become {{some of the}} most prestigious in Europe; their formula of closed-road racing among similar cars replaced the previous model of unregulated vehicles racing between distant towns, over open roads. Entries into the Gordon Bennett races were by country, and the winning country earned the right to organise the next race. Entries were limited to three per country, which meant that although the nascent motor industry in Europe was dominated by French manufacturers, they were denied the opportunity to fully demonstrate their superiority. Instead, the rule put them on a numerical level <b>footing</b> <b>with</b> countries such as Switzerland, with only one manufacturer, and allowed Mercedes, which had factories in Germany and Austria, to field six entries: three from each country. The French governing body, the Automobile Club de France (ACF), held trials between its manufacturers before each race; in 1904 twenty-nine entries competed for the three positions on offer.|$|E

5|$|The war {{continued}} {{through the rest of}} 1675 and into the next year. The English were constantly frustrated by the Native Americans' refusal to meet them in pitched battle. They employed a form of guerilla warfare that confounded the English. Captain Benjamin Church continuously campaigned to enlist the help of friendly Native Americans to help learn how to fight on an even <b>footing</b> <b>with</b> Philip's warrior bands, but he was constantly rebuffed by the Plymouth leadership who mistrusted all Native Americans, thinking them potential enemies. Eventually, Governor Winslow and Plymouth military commander Major William Bradford (son of the late Governor William Bradford) relented and gave Church permission to organize a combined force of English and Native Americans. After securing the alliance of the Sakonnet, he led his combined force in pursuit of Philip, who had thus far avoided any major battles in the war that bears his name. Throughout July 1676, Church's band captured hundreds of Native American warriors, often without much of a fight, though Philip eluded him. Church was given permission to grant amnesty to any captured Native Americans who would agree to join the English side, and his force grew immensely. Philip was killed by a Pocasset Indian, and the war soon ended as an overwhelming English victory.|$|E
