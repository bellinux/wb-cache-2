To effectively employ PSE, {{it is necessary to}} simulate the distortion of the stressed mask membrane due to the fabrication of the stencil void pattern. Equivalent modeling techniques have been developed to determine both global and local in-plane distortions (IPD) using finite element (FE) methods. IPD is calculated by first dividing the patterned area of the membrane into subregions of equivalent void fraction. These subregions are based upon the percent void fraction as well as the pattern geometry. For each subregion, a set of equivalent elastic constants are used as input into the FE model to represent the stiffness of the actual perforated membrane. Global distortions are then computed to simulate the pattern transfer process.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this note is to present {{estimates}} of the radiation dose absorbed in critical device di-electric layers during the applica-tion of <b>ion-beam</b> <b>lithography</b> (IBL). <b>Ion-beam</b> <b>lithography</b> has been demon-strated as a technique providing sub-micrometer resolution with the capa-bil ity of large throughput in work recently reported by Rensch et al. (i) and by Seliger and Sullivan (2). These estimates should facilitate the comparison of this technique with other techniques delivering a radia-tion dose to device structures during processing. Device structures fabricated with x-ray or electron-beam litho-graphic techniques receive absorbed radiation doses in critical dielec-tric layers in excess of 1 Mrad(SiO~) (3). This process-related radiati 6 n exposure may affect the ultimate re-l iabil ity and radiation hardness of devices so fabricated (3, 4, 5). In fact, the radiation hardness of de-vices fabricated using x-ray lithog-raphy {{has been shown to}} be diminished even though the damage due to the lithography was apparently annealed out (5). In order to arrive at the de-sired estimate for radiation dose due to IBL, a description of the behavior of an ion beam passing through multi-ple thin films is required. The technique of Bernstein and Kolodny (6) has been used to obtain such a description.

An artificially induced shape anisotropy field of around 1 kG, consistent with a magnetostatic calculation, was observed for all separations studied. The field dependence of the magneto-optic Kerr effect and magnetoresistance (MR) data is consistent with a twisted magnetization configuration across the width of the sample beneath saturation for transverse applied fields.

30|$|Recently, the nanogap {{structure}} becomes {{attractive to}} researchers {{because it can}} provide enormous Raman enhancement due {{to the existence of}} enormous electromagnetic enhancement in the gap of metal nanostructure, which is called 'hot spot’ [3 – 16]. And the surface plasmonic coupling between neighboring nanounits {{is believed to be the}} main reason for the enormous electromagnetic enhancement. Many investigations on the mechanism of the surface plasmonic coupling and the fabrication of the nanogap-structured SERS substrates for practical application have been presented [3 – 17]. Compared to the nanoparticle substrates, the ordered nanopillar/nanorod array substrates are more uniform and reproducible, which make them more beneficial to practical application and theoretical analysis. But the uniform ordered nanopillar/nanorod array substrates with tunable gap size are usually fabricated by electron-beam lithography (EBL) and focused <b>ion-beam</b> <b>lithography</b> (FIBL), which require a very high fabrication cost [18 – 20]. To circumvent this difficulty, many low-cost methods and techniques have been proposed, like self-assembly [21, 22], indentation lithography [14, 20, 23 – 27], corroding ultra-thin layer [7], femto-second laser fabrication [28 – 31], and so on. But to date, for the existence of many limits of these low-cost techniques, the fabrication of the large-area low-cost high-performance SERS substrate, with tunable gap size, is still critical not only for practical applications of SERS in the chemical/biological sensor, but also in understanding surface plasmonic coupling existing inside the nanogaps.|$|E

In order to develop an efficient process to fabricate nanoscale 3 D structures, we have applied highly charged ion (HCI) beams to the <b>ion-beam</b> <b>lithography</b> (IBL) technique. Ar-ion beams with various charge states (1 + to 9 +) were applied to fabricate spin on glass (SOG) and Si {{by means of the}} IBL technique. The Ar ions were prepared by a facility built at Kochi University of Technology, which includes an electron cyclotron resonance ion source (NANOGAN, 10  GHz). IBL fabrication was performed as a function of not only the charge state but also the energy and the dose of Ar ions. The present results show that the application of an Ar 9 + beam reduces the etching time for SOG and enhances the etching depth compared with those observed with Ar ions in lower charged states. Considering the high-energy deposition of HCI at a surface, the former phenomena can be understood consistently. Also, the latter phenomena can be understood based on anomalously deep structural changes, which are remarkable for glasses. Furthermore, it has also been shown that the etching depth can be easily controlled with the kinetic energy of the Ar ions.

30|$|Metal {{nanoparticles}} (NPs) {{embedded in}} transparent matrices {{are the subject}} of large scientific and technological interest as they show significantly different properties as compared to their bulk counterpart [1, 2]. The NP size and shape, orientation, interparticle separation and dielectric constant of the surrounding matrix are the crucial parameters which control their properties. Generally, the NP shape and orientation is difficult to control by synthesis parameters. One of the interesting aspects of shape anisotropy in noble metal NPs is the splitting of the surface plasmon resonance band [3 – 6], which can be tuned from visible to infrared region. Prolate-shaped NPs/nanorods show new and improved photonic, optoelectronic, and sensing properties as compared to spherical NPs [3, 5]. On the other hand, an array of magnetic prolate-shaped NPs/nanorods with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy permits to overcome the problem of superparamagnetic instability arising due to the decrease in the particle size in magnetic recording media [6 – 8]. Another requirement for recording at high density with a minimum noise is to reduce the interaction between magnetic nanorods, which can be achieved by encapsulation of magnetic nanorods in a non-magnetic matrix. In literature, various methods are reported to prepare prolate-shaped NPs/nanorods, but the investigated methods yield randomly oriented structures (e.g., by chemical routes) [3], small areas (e.g., by electron or focused <b>ion-beam</b> <b>lithography)</b> [5, 7] or are limited to a specific class of materials (e.g., porous alumina template growth) [6, 8].|$|E

However, there is no simple nanometric system that can commonly be used for high-selectivity nanobiosensor applications. This NWA structures with functional materials at the nanometer scale have become more important as technology advances and the paradigm shifts from single material and 2 D planar structures to complex compounds and 3 D architectures. It allows for the fabrication of unique and integrated devices such as gas sensors [29], optical photonic crystals [30], fluidic devices [31], stretchable electronics [32], ring shapes with ferromagnetic materials [33], and so on. Especially, nanoimprint lithography (NIL) is a promising technique that can produce low-cost, large-area fabrication, high throughput [34, 35]. However, pattern resolution is primarily determined by the mold and E-beam lithography (EBL) or Focused <b>ion-beam</b> <b>lithography</b> (FIB), and NIL cannot overcome the resolution limits of the patterning tools and is often limited by the type of materials [36 – 38]. NIL was used to fabricate protein nanoarrays with an inert poly ethylene glycol (PEG) polymer as the resist material. The most widely used inert materials are uncharged PEG-based polymers [39, 40] and self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) [41 – 43], but the latter is incompatible with the NIL process owing to difficulties in direct imprinting. We developed a very effective and widely applicable method for fabricating nanopatterns of a PEG hydrogel for protein NWA.|$|E
