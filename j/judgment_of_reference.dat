40|$|The primary {{objectives}} of the current investigation were to: (a) examine the structure of subjective health risk perception in terms of some major variables (representativeness, availability, distress), hypothesized as influencing <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> probability and severity of consequences; (b) {{determine the effects of}} anchoring (low, middle, high), referencing (self, other), and response format (frequency, analogue), conditions on the invariance of risk ratings; and (c) explore the degree to which personality factors (health concern, hypochondriasis), contribute to <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> health risk. The stimuli used were 55 physical symptoms. A total of 500 subjects participated in this study. A threshold model of responding was used to decompose probability and severity judgments into threshold, salience and distance components for detailed analysis. LISREL modelling techniques were used in a double-cross validated study to determine the operating parameters relating components of probability and severity judgments to major cognitive, emotive and personality dimensions. Major results and conclusions of the study were: (a) A two component factor model <b>of</b> risk <b>judgment</b> was offered as an extension and refinement to models previously proposed in the literature; (b) The overriding dimensions contributing to <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> risk appear to be distress and perceived controllability; (c) Both optimistic and pessimistic biases in probability and severity judgments were observed depending on the referencing context. These biases tended to decrease as familiarity of the symptoms increased; (d) Anchoring manipulations affected individuals 2 ̆ 7 <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> probability, but did not influence <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> severity: <b>Referencing</b> manupulations affected <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> severity but did not influence <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> probability; (e) LISREL results indicated some support for the model proposed by Kahneman and Tversky, for data where the aggregation is over stimuli. The use of a two component threshold model to break judgments down into psychometric components revealed relationships between variables, otherwise missed by more molar approaches; and (f) Personality dimensions had both direct and indirect influences on probability judgments (but not on severity judgments) under self-referenced conditions...|$|R
40|$|Contemporary {{debates about}} the nature <b>of</b> {{semantic}} <b>reference</b> have {{tended to focus on}} two competing approaches: theories which emphasize the importance of descriptive information associated with a referring term, and those which emphasize causal facts about the conditions under which {{the use of the term}} originated and was passed on. Recent empirical work by Machery and colleagues suggests that both causal and descriptive information can play a role in <b>judgments</b> about the <b>reference</b> <b>of</b> proper names, with findings of cross-cultural variation in judgments that imply differences between individuals with respect to whether they favor causal or descriptive information in making reference judgments. We extend this theoretical and empirical line of inquiry to views <b>of</b> the <b>reference</b> <b>of</b> natural and nominal kind concepts, which face similar challenges to those concerning the <b>reference</b> <b>of</b> proper names. In two experiments, we find evidence that both descriptive and causal factors contribute to <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> concept <b>reference,</b> with no reliable differences between natural and nominal kinds. Moreover, we find evidence that the same individuals’ judgments can rely on both descriptive and causal information, such that variation between individuals cannot be explained by appeal to a mixed population of “pure descriptive theorists” and “pure causal theorists. ” These findings suggest that the contrast between descriptive and causal theories <b>of</b> <b>reference</b> may be inappropriate; intuitions may instead support a hybrid theory <b>of</b> <b>reference</b> that includes both causal and descriptive factors. We propose that future research should focus on the relationship between these factors, and describe several possible frameworks for pursuing these issues.

40|$|This article explores young infants' {{ability to}} learn new words in {{situations}} providing tightly controlled social and salience cues to their reference. Four experiments investigated whether, given two potential referents, 15 -month-olds would attach novel labels to (a) an image toward which a digital recording of a face turned and gazed, (b) a moving image versus a stationary image, (c) a moving image toward which the face gazed, and (d) a gazed-on image versus a moving image. Infants successfully used the recorded gaze cue to form new word-referent associations and also showed learning in the salience condition. However, their behavior in the salience condition and in the experiments that followed suggests that, rather than basing their <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> the words' <b>reference</b> on the mere {{presence or absence of}} the referent's motion, infants were strongly biased to attend to the consistency with which potential referents moved when a word was heard.

Methods : Trial 4 tested whether use of written instructions and pretrial agreement on techniques and use <b>of</b> standard <b>reference</b> values, diagnostic percentile values, or broader categorization of abnormality could reduce significant interobserver disagreement and improve agreement among clinical neurophysiologists. Results : The Trial 4 modifications markedly decreased, but did not eliminate, significant interobserver differences of measured attributes of NC. Use <b>of</b> standard <b>reference</b> values and defined percentile values of abnormality decreased interobserver disagreement and improved agreement <b>of</b> <b>judgment</b> <b>of</b> abnormality among evaluators. Therefore, the same clinical neurophysiologist should perform repeat NCs of therapeutic trial patients.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} the agreement among clinical experts in their <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> monitoring data {{with respect to}} artifacts, and to examine the effect <b>of</b> <b>reference</b> standards that consist of individual and joint expert judgments {{on the performance of}} artifact filters. DESIGN: Individual <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> four physicians, a majority vote judgment, and a consensus judgment were obtained for 30 time series of three monitoring variables: mean arterial blood pressure (ABPm), central venous pressure (CVP), and heart rate (HR). The individual and joint judgments were used to tune three existing automated filtering methods and to evaluate the performance of the resulting filters. MEASUREMENTS: The interrater agreement was calculated in terms of positive specific agreement (PSA). The performance of the artifact filters was quantified in terms of sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV). RESULTS: PSA values between 0. 33 and 0. 85 were observed among clinical experts in their selection of artifacts, with relatively high values for CVP data. Artifact filters developed using <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> individual experts were found to moderately generalize to new time series and other experts; sensitivity values ranged from 0. 40 to 0. 60 for ABPm and HR filters (PPV: 0. 57 - 0. 84), and from 0. 63 to 0. 80 for CVP filters (PPV: 0. 71 - 0. 86). A higher performance value for the filters was found for the three variable types when joint judgments were used for tuning the filtering methods. CONCLUSION: Given the disagreement among experts in their individual <b>judgment</b> <b>of</b> monitoring data with respect to artifacts, the use <b>of</b> joint <b>reference</b> standards obtained from multiple experts is recommended for development of automatic artifact filter...|$|R

40|$|The {{self-concept}} {{literature is}} characterized by a continuing controversy over whether the self-concept is stable or malleable. In this article we suggest that it is both but that the stability observed for general descriptions of the self may mask significant local variation. In this study the social environment was varied by creating a situation in which subjects found themselves to be either very unique or very similar to others. Following this manipulation, subjects responded to a series of self-concept mea-sures. Although the uniqueness and similarity subjects did not differ in the trait terms they used to describe themselves, they did differ systematically in their latency for these judgments, in positivity and negativity of their word associations, and in their <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> similarity to <b>reference</b> groups. These findings imply that subjects made to feel unique recruited conceptions of themselves as similar to others, whereas subjects made to feel similar to others recruited conceptions of themselves as unique. The results suggest that very general self-descriptive measures are inadequate for revealing how the individual adjusts and calibrates the self-concept in response to challenges from the social environment. Two seemingly contradictory aspects of the self have been emphasized in the empirical self-concept literature. The self has been regarded as a stable and enduring structure that pro-tects itself against change (e. g., Greenwald, 1980; Markus...|$|R

We carried out the first measurements of spatial frequency (SF) tuning for <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> eye gaze, and compared SF tuning for <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> facial identity and eye gaze. In Experiment 1, participants discriminated between leftward and rightward shifts of gaze, or between two male faces or two female faces. Faces were masked with visual noise that blocked one of 10 SF bands. For each task and masking SF, we measured contrast thresholds for human observers, and used an ideal observer to measure the amount of visual information available to perform the task. As in previous research, low to mid SFs were most important for <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> facial identity. Mid to high SFs were most important for <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> eye gaze, and the highest SF important for these judgments was higher than that for identity. In Experiment 2, participants discriminated horizontal and vertical shifts of gaze. The highest SF important for <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> gaze did not differ between the horizontal and vertical axes. However, SFs above and below this value were more important for <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> vertical shifts of gaze than for horizontal shifts of gaze.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} an {{overlooked}} dimension <b>of</b> time <b>judgments,</b> namely subjective <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> {{the speed of}} time passage: how fast time is judged as passing. It has examined how people make <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> the speed of time passage and what factors influence people’s <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> the speed of time passage. Chapter 2 first unravels the cognitive processes that underlie <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> the speed of time passage: the more {{attention is paid to}} non-temporal information, the faster time is judged as passing; it also disentangles <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> the speed of time passage from duration judgments (i. e., judgments about how long time lasted), demonstrating that it is not reliable to infer <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> the speed of time passage from duration judgments. Chapter 3 builds upon the previous chapter and examines two factors: presentation speed of stimuli and comparison, which might interfere with the role of attentional processes in judging the speed of time passage. It shows that both presentation speed of stimuli and comparison could influence people’s <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> the speed of time passage, but they could not replace the role of attentional processes: when either presentation speed of stimuli or comparison is missing, people can always rely on attentional processes to make <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> the speed of time passage. Chapter 4 examines the influence of unpredictability on people’s <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> the speed of time passage. It shows that time is judged as passing faster when people are in both temporal unpredictable situations where they cannot predict when the events would happen, and in content unpredictable situations where they cannot predict what events would happen next. Chapter 5 examines the influence of spatial directions <b>of</b> movements on <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> the speed of time passage. It shows the effect that people judge time as passing faster for the left-to-right movements than the right-to-left movements. This effect was also replicated with Farsi speakers. Overall, the work in this thesis shows original empirical evidence about how people make <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> the speed of time passage; specifically, it discloses the underlying mechanism <b>of</b> <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> the speed of time passage (i. e., attentional processes) as well as the factors that influence people’s <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> the speed of time passage such as presentation speed of stimuli, comparison, unpredictability and spatial directions of movements...|$|R
