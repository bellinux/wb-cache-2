40|$|Legally, butter {{must contain}} at least 80 % fat (all of {{which must be}} pure milkfat) and a maximum of 16 % water. As a {{consequence}} of these legal restrictions, {{there has been a}} reluctance for the dairy industry to blend oils with milkfat since products like this cannot be termed as butter.

A number of institutions and facilities were soon established, including the courthouse and town hall (1891), the gas and waterworks (1896) and the power plant (1907). From the beginning of the 20th century, Esbjerg prospered not only as a fishing port but became one of the country's major export centres. Established in 1895 by nine local dairies, the butter-packaging factory, Dansk Andels Smørpakkeri, employed some 150 workers until 1920, packing and dispatching butter for the London market. It was later extended to include egg marketing under the name Dansk Andels Ægeksport. Ultimately, it handled produce from 140 <b>dairies</b> <b>spread</b> across the whole of Jutland. After the Second World War, the town developed several agricultural industries, especially meat processing and packaging with a plant employing over 300. The slaughterhouse and meat packaging facility, Esbjerg Andels-Slagteri, established in 1887, became Denmark's sixth largest by 1962. It later became part of Vestjyske Slagterier in 1986, and in 2001, it was acquired by Danish Crown.|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} the efficacy on plasma cholesterol-lowering of {{plant sterol esters}} or non-esterified stanols eaten within low-fat foods as well as margarine. Design: Randomised, controlled, single-blind study with sterol esters and non-esterified plant stanols provided in breakfast cereal, bread and spreads. Study 1 comprised 12 weeks during which sterol esters (2. 4 g) and stanol (2. 4 g) -containing foods were eaten during 4 week test periods of cross-over design following a 4 week control food period. In Study 2, in a random order cross-over design, a 50 % <b>dairy</b> fat <b>spread</b> with or without 2. 4 g sterol esters daily was tested. Subjects: Hypercholesterolaemic subjects; 22 in study 1 and 15 in study 2. Main outcome measures: Plasma lipids, plasma sterols, plasma carotenoids and tocopherols. Results: Study 1 &frac 34;median LDL cholesterol was reduced by the sterol esters (- 13. 6 %; P< 0. 001 by ANOVA on ranks; P< 0. 05 by pairwise comparison) and by stanols (- 8. 3 %; P= 0. 003, ANOVA and < 0. 05 pairwise comparison). With sterol esters plasma plant sterol levels rose (35 % for sitosterol, 51 % for campesterol; P< 0. 001); plasma lathosterol rose 20 % (P= 0. 03), indicating compensatory increased cholesterol synthesis. With stanols, plasma sitosterol fell 22 % (P= 0. 004), indicating less cholesterol absorption. None of the four carotenoids measured in plasma changed significantly. In study 2, median LDL cholesterol rose 6. 5 % with <b>dairy</b> <b>spread</b> and fell 12. 2 % with the sitosterol ester fortified spread (P= 0. 03 ANOVA and < 5 % pairwise comparison). Conclusion: 1. Plant sterol esters and non-esterified stanols, two-thirds of which were incorporated into low-fat foods, contributed effectively to LDL cholesterol lowering, extending the range of potential foods. 2. The LDL cholesterol-raising effect of butter fat could be countered by including sterol esters. 3. Plasma carotenoids and tocopherols were not reduced in this study. <br /...|$|R

Mean (SD) age, weight and BMI of the population were 51 +/- 10 year, 94 +/- 18 kg and 32. 4 +/- 5. 7 kg/m 2, respectively. Reduced fat milk was the most commonly consumed dairy product (235 +/- 200 g/day), followed by whole milk (63 +/- 128 g/day) and yoghurt (53 +/- 66 g/day). Overall dairy food consumption (g/day) was inversely associated with BMI, % body fat and WC (all p < 0. 05). Dairy protein and dairy calcium (g/day) were both inversely associated with all adiposity measures (all p < 0. 05).

40|$|Retentate {{obtained}} from ultrafiltration {{was used as}} a substitute for skim milk powder, in the manufacture of ice cream and cajeta (Mexican <b>dairy</b> <b>spread).</b> The products were assessed by chemical, physical, sensory and structural analysis. Ice creams made using ultrafiltered retentate had increased ash, protein, calcium, phosphorus and magnesium, but reduced lactose, potassium and sodium contents. Physical evaluation showed that UF-products were harder, more viscous and had better melting resistance, but had lower overrun and extrusion temperature than control ice cream. In Sensory analysis UF-products scored better for iciness, sandiness and fluffiness, and resisted heat shock treatment better. No consumer preference for UF-based ice cream or control ice cream was found. The UF-ice cream took longer to soften to eating consistency. Structural examination of ice cream products by various microscopy techniques revealed air cell, ice crystal and fat droplet structures within a sugar and protein matrix. Freeze substitution was applied to ice cream for Transmission Electron Microscopy to produce unique thin sectioned samples. This showed a more agglomerated casein structure than UF-based ice cream. Heat shock changed ice cream structure. Ice crystal size increased and crystals fused into a network. Air cells could be distorted into a modified channel shape. Chemical, physical, microbiological and sensorial analysis of cajeta were carried out. UF-cajeta had slightly higher protein calcium and phosphorous contents and lower lactose, potassium and sodium contents. UF-cajeta showed better sensory attributes after storage than the control, however as shelf life was extended yeast and mould growth was possible. Structural examination of cajeta showed ultrafiltered retentate in cajeta manufacture prevented the formation of larger crystals and prevented sandiness that developed in the control product...|$|R

It considers the advantages and disadvantages of share farming for both landlords and share farmers and traces some of the social and economic consequences for the industry and the people involved. In doing so it offers a new explanation for the expansion of the industry and the problems that later developed. Few historians have written on share farming. Dunsdorfs considers its influence, but only in the wheat industry. On writing about the impact of dairying on family life in Victoria, Lake makes only passing reference to it. Davidson examines the dairying industry during the Depression, and argued that its expansion occurred as beef and sheep zone fanners changed over. He does not consider {{the role of}} share farming, and for that reason we find his explanation deficient. We argue that share farming was crucial to the expansion of the dairy industry as the means whereby those with little or no capital entered it. In times of prosperity, dairying 2 ̆ 7 on shares 2 ̆ 7 offered a modest prosperity; in depression, it offered subsistence and an alternative to the dole. After 1890 <b>dairying</b> <b>spread</b> rapidly in New South Wales, assisted mainly by changes in technology and land legislation and the development of overseas markets. Initially dairying developed through owner occupation, but, by 1916, share farming was sufficiently established and its consequences enough appreciated to attract the attention of a royal commission, and subsequently, to prompt ameliorating legislation in the Rural Tenants 2 ̆ 7 Improvements Act 1916. It was the subject of a select committee in 1920 - 1 and further legislation in 1941, when it was estimated that at least 36 per cent of dairy farms in coastal New South Wales were operated by share. We argue that share farming is the key to explaining the dynamics of the dairy industry, especially after the first world war. It explains the expansion of the industry despite many years of low farm incomes, and failing prices during the Depression of the 1930...|$|R

The first farmers in central Europe and Britain milked their animals. Pastoral and pastoral nomadic economies, which rely predominantly or exclusively on domestic animals and their products rather than crop farming, were developed as European farmers moved into the Pontic-Caspian steppe in the fourth millennium BC, and subsequently spread {{across much of the}} Eurasian steppe. Sheep and goats were introduced to Africa from Southwest Asia, but African cattle may have been independently domesticated around 7000–6000 BC.

The earliest Egyptian records of burn treatments describe burn dressings using milk from mothers of male babies. In {{the rest of the world}} (i.e., East and Southeast Asia, the Americas and Australia) milk and dairy products were historically not a large part of the diet, either because they remained populated by hunter-gatherers who did not keep animals or the local agricultural economies did not include domesticated dairy species.

The average damage caused by mastitis in Switzerland has been estimated to be CHF 350 per cow and year (Walkenhorst, 2004). Early medical treatment substantially reduces the non-reversible losses in milk production caused by this infection. Therefore, {{it is essential to}} use tests with a high probability of detecting mastitis when it is present (i. e. high sensitivity) and of providing a negative result in non-infected cows (i. e. high specificity).

It would be simple to estimate the sensitivity and specificity of the tests if a perfect test were available for comparison. However, a gold standard for the detection of mastitis does not yet exist.

40|$|International audienceIt is {{essential}} to have suitable tools able to trace the fate of manure organic matter in the environment to assess whether manure disposal on the soils of catchments could affect the organic quality of rivers. Sterol compounds ­ mainly expressed as C 29 + 28 /C 27 and 5 ß/C 27 ratios ­ {{have been shown to}} be specific molecular tracers of pig, dairy and poultry manures in soils. The objective of this study was to measure C 29 + 28 /C 27 and 5 ß/C 27 ratios in five Brittany rivers (Elorn, Yar, Léguer, Min Ran and Couesnon) draining agricultural catchments receiving massive annual inputs of pig, poultry and dairy manures and compare these ratios with ratios published for enriched soils and manure samples. The particulate organic fractions from the studied rivers yielded steroid signatures typical of animal manures. More specifically, a stanol compound diagnostic of pig slurry ­ the 5 ß-stanol known as coprostanol ­ was found to be very widespread, with particularly high concentrations in one of the rivers (Elorn). The C 29 + 28 /C 27 and 5 ß/C 27 ratios of the particulate fractions of the rivers were compared with ratios measured directly in pig, dairy and poultry manure samples, as well as with the breeding activities on river catchments. These comparisons show that the steroid profiles of the five investigated rivers correlate closely with the types of manure (i. e. pig, poultry or <b>dairy)</b> <b>spread</b> on soils in their catchments. For instance, the C 29 + 28 /C 27 and 5 ß/C 27 ratios in the Elorn river are similar to the values typical of pig slurry (e. g. 5 ß/C 27 > 4); compared with other catchments, the soils in this area receive by far the largest amount of pig slurry. By contrast, the Yar river drains a catchment receiving only poultry and dairy manures, and its soils exhibit C 29 + 28 /C 27 and 5 ß/C 27 ratios similar to those of dairy and poultry manures (e. g. 5 ß/C 27 1). Thus, this study indicates that the organic quality of rivers is modified in catchments where there is intense manure spreading on soils. It also provides evidence that rivers draining areas receiving different manure types may exhibit differences in the long-term evolution of their OM content. Indeed, two of the investigated river catchments receive dominantly dairy and poultry manure, and exhibit clear long-term upward trends in OM. On the other hand, one catchment receiving high proportions of pig slurry clearly shows a long-term downward trend in OM contents. A survey of the literature shows that the relative amount of OM and N received by soils in agricultural catchments could be the key parameter in determining the direction of the long-term OM trend of the river, rather than the absolute amount and/or type of manure that is applied to the soil. In any case, the present study suggests that sterol/stanol compounds may be of diagnostic value in determining whether a stream or a river is undergoing contamination by manure-derived organic matter...|$|R

Intensive farming methods were used to grow maize as an animal feedstuff. These measures had been supported since the middle of the 20th century by various national and European subsidy programmes. This went so far that ditches dried out in summer, heath fires broke out and, during sustained periods of drought, the land was artificially watered.|$|R
5000|$|Nutrient budgets offer {{insight into}} the balance between crop inputs and outputs. In short, they compare {{nutrients}} you apply to the soil to nutrients taken up by crops. A nutrient budget takes into account all the nutrient inputs on a farm and all those removed from the land. The most obvious source of nutrients in this situation is fertilizer, but this {{is only part of}} the picture. Other inputs come with rainfall, in supplements brought on to the farm and in effluent - either farm or <b>dairy</b> factory - <b>spread</b> on the land. In addition, nutrients can be moved around the farm - from an area used for growing silage to the area used to feed it out, from paddock to raceway, and within paddocks in dung and urine patches. Nutrients are removed from the farm in stock sold on, products (meat, milk, wool), crops sold or fed out off farm, and through processes such as nitrate leaching, volatilization and phosphate run-off etc.|$|R
40|$|Bovine paratuberculosis (PTB) is {{a chronic}} enteric {{inflammatory}} disease of ruminants caused by Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) that causes large economic {{losses in the}} <b>dairy</b> industry. <b>Spread</b> of PTB is mainly provoked by a long subclinical stage during which MAP is shed into the environment with feces; accordingly, detection of subclinical animals {{is very important to}} its control. However, current diagnostic methods are not suitable for detection of subclinical animals. Therefore, the current study was conducted to develop a diagnostic method for analysis of the expression of genes of prognostic potential biomarker candidates in the whole blood of cattle naturally infected with MAP. Real-time PCR with nine potential biomarker candidates was developed for the diagnosis of MAP subclinical infection. Animals were divided into four groups based on fecal MAP PCR and serum ELISA. Eight genes (Timp 1, Hp, Serpine 1, Tfrc, Mmp 9, Defb 1, Defb 10, and S 100 a 8) were up-regulated in MAP-infected cattle (p < 0. 05). Moreover, ROC analysis revealed that eight genes (Timp 1, Hp, Serpine 1, Tfrc, Mmp 9, Defb 1, Defb 10, and S 100 a 8) showed fair diagnostic performance (AUC≥ 0. 8). Four biomarkers (Timp 1, S 100 a 8, Defb 1, and Defb 10) showed the highest diagnostic accuracy in the PCR positive and ELISA negative group (PN group) and three biomarkers (Tfrc, Hp, and Serpine 1) showed the highest diagnostic accuracy in the PCR negative and ELISA positive group (NP group). Moreover, three biomarkers (S 100 a 8, Hp, and Defb 10) were considered the most reliable for the PCR positive and ELISA positive group (PP group). Taken together, our data suggest that real-time PCR based on eight biomarkers (Timp 1, Hp, Serpine 1, Tfrc, Mmp 9, Defb 1, Defb 10, and S 100 a 8) might be useful for diagnosis of JD, including subclinical stage cases...|$|R

Objective: The aim was to investigate how a healthy Nordic diet affects the fasting plasma lipidomic profile in subjects with metabolic syndrome. Methods: Men and women (n = 200) with features of metabolic syndrome [mean age: 55 y; body mass index (in kg/m(2)) : 31. 6] were randomly assigned to either a healthy Nordic (n = 104) or a control (n = 96) diet for 18 or 24 wk at 6 centers. Of the participants, 156 completed the study with plasma lipidomic measurements. The healthy Nordic diet consisted of whole grains, fruits, vegetables, berries, vegetable oils and margarines, fish, low-fat milk products, and low-fat meat. An average Nordic diet served as the control diet and included low-fiber cereal products, <b>dairy</b> fat-based <b>spreads,</b> regular-fatmilk products, and a limited amount of fruits, vegetables, and berries. Lipidomic profiles were measured at baseline, week 12, and the end of the intervention (18 or 24 wk) by using ultraperformance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. The effects of the diets on the lipid variables were analyzed with linear mixed-effects models. Data from centers with 18 - or 24 -wk duration were also analyzed separately. Results: Changes in 21 plasma lipids differed significantly between the groups at week 12 (false discovery rate P < 0. 05), including increases in plasmalogens and decreases in ceramides in the healthy Nordic diet group compared with the control group. At the end of the study, changes in lipidomic profiles did not differ between the groups. However, when the intervention lasted 24 wk, changes in 8 plasma lipids that had been identified at 12 wk, including plasmalogens, were sustained. There were no differences in changes in plasma lipids between groups with an intervention of 18 wk. By the dietary biomarker score, adherence to diet did not explain the difference in the results related to the duration of the study. Conclusions: A healthy Nordic diet transiently modified the plasma lipidomic profile, specifically by increasing the concentrations of antioxidative plasmalogens and decreasing insulin resistance-inducing ceramides...|$|R
