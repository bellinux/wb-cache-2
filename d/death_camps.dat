5|$|In a world {{historically}} {{receptive to}} any anti-Semitic argument, however crude, {{to put in}} Hitler's mouth a powerful rationale for blaming the Jews, however ironically, was feeding the same fires that sent Jews up the chimneys of the <b>death</b> <b>camps.</b>|$|E
5|$|In his 1987 book Belzec, Sobibor, Treblinka: The Operation Reinhard <b>Death</b> <b>Camps,</b> Israeli {{historian}} Yitzhak Arad {{stated that}} at least 763,000 people were killed at Treblinka between July 1942 and April 1943. A considerable number of other estimates followed: see table (below).|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} Holocaust during World War II, German Nazis used gas vans at Chelmno {{extermination}} camp and elsewhere to kill an estimated over 700,000 prisoners by carbon monoxide poisoning. This method was also used in the gas chambers of several <b>death</b> <b>camps</b> such as Treblinka, Sobibor and Belzec. Gassing with carbon monoxide started in action T4, the euthanasia programme developed by the Nazis in Germany to murder the mentally ill and disabled people before the war started in earnest. The gas was supplied by IG Farben in pressurized cylinders and fed by tubes into the gas chambers built at various mental hospitals, such as Hartheim Euthanasia Centre. Many key personnel were recruited from the T4 programme to murder much larger numbers {{of people in the}} gas vans and the special gas chambers used in the <b>death</b> <b>camps</b> such as Treblinka. Exhaust fumes from tank engines for example, were used to supply the gas to the chambers.|$|E

5|$|Despite widely varying {{treatment}} (some {{groups were}} actively targeted for genocide, {{while others were}} not), some died in concentration camps such as Dachau and others from various forms of Nazi brutality. According to extensive documentation (written and photographic) left by the Nazis, eyewitness testimony by survivors, perpetrators and bystanders and records of the occupied countries, most perished in <b>death</b> <b>camps</b> such as Auschwitz-Birkenau.|$|E
5|$|By 1944 the Red Army {{had begun}} to push the German forces out of Eastern Europe, and the Einsatzgruppen retreated {{alongside}} the Wehrmacht. By late 1944, most Einsatzgruppen personnel had been folded into Waffen-SS combat units or transferred to permanent <b>death</b> <b>camps.</b> Hilberg estimates that between 1941 and 1945 the Einsatzgruppen and related agencies killed {{more than two million}} people, including 1.3 million Jews. The total number of Jews murdered during the war is estimated at 5.5 to six million people.|$|E
5|$|During the 1941 {{collapse}} of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia under the Axis invasion in the April War, the Independent State of Croatia was created. It was ruled by the extreme nationalist Ustaša regime. The Ustaša quickly started with the systematic persecution of the Jews, modeled after the Nazi Germany approach, and at times even more brutal. Racial laws were introduced, Jewish property was confiscated, and the Jews were subjected to mass arrests and deportations to <b>death</b> <b>camps</b> in Croatia and abroad.|$|E

5|$|Heydrich's {{replacements}} were Ernst Kaltenbrunner as {{the chief}} of RSHA, and Karl Hermann Frank (27–28 May 1942) and Kurt Daluege (28 May 1942 – 14 October 1943) as the new acting Reichsprotektors. After Heydrich's death, implementation of the policies formalised at the Wannsee conference he chaired was accelerated. The first three true <b>death</b> <b>camps,</b> designed for mass killing with no legal process or pretext, were built and operated at Treblinka, Sobibór, and Bełżec. The project was named Operation Reinhard after Heydrich.|$|E
5|$|Intensification of {{the killing}} {{operations}} took place in late 1941 when the SS began construction of stationary gassing facilities to replace the use of Einsatzgruppen for mass killings. Victims at these new extermination camps were killed {{with the use of}} carbon monoxide gas from automobile engines. During Operation Reinhard, run by officers from the Totenkopfverbände, who were sworn to secrecy, three <b>death</b> <b>camps</b> were built in occupied Poland: Bełżec (operational by March 1942), Sobibór (operational by May 1942), and Treblinka (operational by July 1942), with squads of Trawniki men (Eastern European collaborators) overseeing hundreds of Sonderkommando prisoners, who were forced to work in the gas chambers and crematoria before being murdered themselves. On Himmler's orders, by early 1942 the concentration camp at Auschwitz was greatly expanded to include the addition of gas chambers, where victims were killed using the pesticide Zyklon B.|$|E
5|$|The {{characters}} in Korkoro {{are drawn from}} Sigot's anecdote. The film traces the Romani familias life during the war, from their disbelief at being forbidden to travel but also being rejected by others when they stay in one place, to their arrest, incarceration, liberation {{with the help of}} a local French mayor and a notary, their struggle to live in a non-nomadic way, and then final arrest before being sent to the <b>Death</b> <b>Camps.</b> The character Théodore Rosier is based on the notary in the anecdote. The other Juste character, Lise Lundi, is based on Yvette Lundy and an old teacher of Gatlif's from Belcourt in Algeria who was a communist and an aide with the Front de Libération Nationale (National Liberation Front).|$|E

5|$|After {{the fall}} of Italian {{dictator}} Benito Mussolini in September 1943, the German Army occupied Athens, where a minority of Greek Jews had sought refuge. The majority (about 60,000 {{out of a total}} population of 75,000) were deported to Nazi concentration camps, where all but 2,000 died. During this period, Princess Andrew hid Jewish widow Rachel Cohen and two of her five children, who sought to evade the Gestapo and deportation to the <b>death</b> <b>camps.</b> Rachel's husband, Haimaki Cohen, had aided King George I of Greece in 1913. In return, King George had offered him any service that he could perform, should Cohen ever need it. Cohen's son remembered this during the Nazi threat, and appealed to Princess Andrew, who with Princess Nicholas was one of only two remaining {{members of the royal family}} left in Greece. She honoured the promise and saved the Cohen family.|$|E
25|$|In Nazi {{extermination}} camps: {{according to}} Polish Institute of National Remembrance (IPN) researchers, 2,830,000 Jews were {{murdered in the}} Nazi <b>death</b> <b>camps</b> (500,000 Belzec; 150,000 Sobibor; 850,000 Treblinka; 150,000 Chełmno; 1,100,000 Auschwitz; 80,000 Majdanek). Raul Hilberg puts the Jewish death toll in the <b>death</b> <b>camps,</b> including Romanian Transnistria, at 3.0 million.|$|E

25|$|From 1940 to 1944, it is {{estimated}} that starvation and disease caused the death of 43,000 Jews imprisoned in the Holocaust ghettos. Most Polish Jews subsequently perished in the German <b>death</b> <b>camps.</b> Towards the end of 1942, the mass extermination of Polish Jews had started with deportations from urban centres to <b>death</b> <b>camps</b> including Jews from outside Poland.|$|E

25|$|With the Nazi {{invasion}} to Poland in 1939 and {{the beginning}} of World War II the Nazis began the final solution of the Jews in Europe. The Jews were concentrated in ghettos and later sent to concentration and <b>death</b> <b>camps</b> where they were murdered. In the occupied territories of the USSR Jews were murdered in mass numbers by death squads with the help of local population. This practice was later replaced by gassing the Jews in the <b>death</b> <b>camps,</b> the largest of them was Auschwitz.|$|E
