Of the wheat samples intended for human consumption, 8. 3 % contained OTA at 0. 29 ng/g on the average (OTA ranges: 0. 12 - 0. 5 ng/g; Table 2). The OTA contamination of wheat flour and maize meal samples for human consumption was similar to that of the baking wheat samples.

Sixty-six percent of the coffee samples were contaminated with OA (average level: 0. 57 ng/g, ranges: 0. 17 - 1. 3 ng/g; Table 4). OTA contamination of baking wheat samples was found to be relatively low, presumably as a result of the favourable weather at harvest and the optimal storage conditions. Calculations made on the basis of the obtained results show that the daily OTA intake of an adult human from edible cereals is only 6. 7 ng, while the amount taken up with coffee is 4. 1 ng daily. The high prevalence and high levels of OTA contamination in feed grains can be explained by the unfavourable storage conditions, and this finding suggests that OA-related health problems may arise in animals, and that foods of animal origin may be contaminated with this mycotoxin...|$|R
