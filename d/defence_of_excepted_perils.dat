40|$|The Rotterdam Rules set forth, on {{the lines}} of the Hague- Visby Rules, a number <b>of</b> <b>excepted</b> <b>perils</b> when the carrier will not be liable for the damage to cargo. The {{institute}} <b>of</b> <b>excepted</b> <b>perils</b> was established by the Hague Rules almost 90 years ago, and is still implemented in practice. For such cases exceptionally the carrier is not liable under the principle of assumed guilty, but under the principle of proven guilty. In the preliminary activities for concluding the new international convention, the possibility has been considered of abolition of the institute <b>of</b> <b>excepted</b> <b>perils</b> has been considered, but in the end nevertheless, on the initiative of mainly maritime states, it has been retained, developed and more contemporarily styled, i. e. concerted with the requirements of the contemporary maritime transport. The Rotterdam Rules in Article 17, Paragraph 3, taxatively cite the <b>excepted</b> <b>perils</b> due to which the carrier will be able to exculpate from liability. The key difference is that error in navigation is no longer an <b>excepted</b> <b>peril.</b> Especially important novelties introduced by the Rotterdam Rules are exemption of the carrier from liability due to the acts of piracy, terrorist attacks, undertaking measures to avoid or prevent possible damage to the environment, and alike...|$|R

50|$|Thus threatened, Pope John XII {{asked the}} king of Germany for help. Otto entered Italy in 961, while Adalbert {{assembled}} a large army at Verona. According to contemporary sources it was 60,000 strong, although this is an obvious exaggeration. Many of the leading noble families refused {{to join in the}} <b>defence</b> <b>of</b> Italy <b>except</b> on the condition that Berengar abdicate in favour of his son. This the elder king refused to do, and thus Adalbert was unable to effectively oppose the German invasion. Otto proceeded unopposed to Milan, where he was crowned king by Archbishop Walbert in November, and from there to Rome, where he was crowned Emperor by the pope on 3 February 962. Adalbert and Berengar went into hiding.|$|R
50|$|It has {{now become}} common form to {{stipulate}} that the shipowner shall not be liable for any loss arising from the negligence of his servants, or that he shall not be liable for loss by the <b>excepted</b> <b>perils</b> even when {{brought about by the}} negligence of his servants.|$|R
5000|$|In 1820, British {{surveyor}} R.H. Colebrook, {{who visited}} Al Bidda, remarked {{on the recent}} depopulation of the town. He wrote: Guttur - Or Ul Budee Al‐Bidda, once a considerable town, is protected by two square Ghurries forts near the sea shore; but containing no fresh water they are incapable <b>of</b> <b>defence</b> <b>except</b> against sudden incursions of Bedouins, another Ghurry is situated two miles inland and has fresh water with it. This could contain two hundred men. There are remaining at Ul Budee about 250 men, but the original inhabitants, who {{may be expected to}} return from Bahrein, will augment them to 900 or 1,000 men, and if the Doasir tribe, who frequent the place as divers, again settle in it, from 600 to 800 men.|$|R
50|$|The {{difficulty}} of construing {{the terms of}} bills of lading {{with regard to the}} <b>excepted</b> <b>perils,</b> often expressed in obscure and inexact language, has given rise to much litigation, the results of which are recorded in the law reports. Where such difficulties arise debate arises as to the true and natural meaning of the language used by the parties. The words of the contract must always be considered with reference to these rules, which are founded on the well-established customs of merchants recognized and formulated by law.|$|R

60|$|The brigade {{to which}} I was attached--Garland's, of Worth's division--was sent to confront San Antonio, {{two or three}} miles from St. Augustin Tlalpam, {{on the road to}} Churubusco and the City of Mexico. The ground on which San Antonio stands is {{completely}} in the valley, and the surface of the land is only a little above the level of the lakes, and, except to the south-west, it was cut up by deep ditches filled with water. To the south-west is the Pedregal--the volcanic rock before spoken of--over which cavalry or artillery could not be passed, and infantry would make but poor progress if confronted by an enemy. From the position occupied by Garland's brigade, therefore, no movement could be made against the <b>defences</b> <b>of</b> San Antonio <b>except</b> to the front, and by a narrow causeway, over perfectly level ground, every inch of which was commanded by the enemy's artillery and infantry. If Contreras, some three miles west and south, should fall into our hands, troops from there could move to the right flank of all the positions held by the enemy between us and the city. Under these circumstances General Scott directed the holding of the front of the enemy without making an attack until further orders.|$|R

50|$|The post traces {{its roots}} {{to the post}} of General Officer Commanding, Ceylon, which was {{the title of the}} General Officer Commanding of the British Army units in Ceylon prior to {{independence}} in 1948. After the formation of the Ceylon Army in 1949, its first commanding officer was of the rank of Brigadier, hence the title Commander of the Ceylon Army was formally adopted although it was at times referred as General Officer Commanding, Ceylon as far as the 1960s. Brig. Roderick Sinclair, 19th Earl of Caithness was the first holder of the appointment of the Commander of the army of independent Sri Lanka (then Ceylon). In the recent past serving army commanders have been of the rank of Lieutenant General, promoted to the honorary rank of General when retiring or promoted to Chief <b>of</b> <b>Defence</b> Staff, <b>except</b> in the case of Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka in which case he was made General when he was still the Commander of the Army.
