5|$|Examples {{of common}} human {{diseases}} caused by viruses include the common cold, influenza, chickenpox, and cold sores. Many serious {{diseases such as}} Ebola virus disease, AIDS, avian influenza, and SARS are caused by viruses. The relative ability of viruses to cause disease is {{described in terms of}} virulence. Other diseases are under investigation to discover if they have a virus as the causative agent, such as the possible connection between human herpesvirus 6 (HHV6) and neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis and chronic <b>fatigue</b> <b>syndrome.</b> There is controversy over whether the bornavirus, previously thought to cause neurological diseases in horses, could be responsible for psychiatric illnesses in humans.|$|E
5|$|In other diseases, {{defects in}} nuclear genes lead to {{dysfunction}} of mitochondrial proteins. This {{is the case}} in Friedreich's ataxia, hereditary spastic paraplegia, and Wilson's disease. These diseases are inherited in a dominance relationship, as applies to most other genetic diseases. A variety of disorders can be caused by nuclear mutations of oxidative phosphorylation enzymes, such as coenzyme Q10 deficiency and Barth syndrome. Environmental influences may interact with hereditary predispositions and cause mitochondrial disease. For example, there may be a link between pesticide exposure and the later onset of Parkinson's disease. Other pathologies with etiology involving mitochondrial dysfunction include schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, dementia, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, stroke, cardiovascular disease, chronic <b>fatigue</b> <b>syndrome,</b> retinitis pigmentosa, and diabetes mellitus.|$|E

40|$|Background and Aim: The {{psychological}} {{changes and}} physiological limitations during multiple sclerosis (MS) disease diminish the social relations. Consequently, losing social supports {{leads to more}} physical and psychological complications such as <b>fatigue</b> <b>syndromes.</b> Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the relationship of social support and <b>fatigue</b> <b>syndromes</b> in MS patients. Methods: This study was a descriptive-analytic which randomly selected 46 patients with MS. The patients evaluated through demographic information, standard modified social support scale, fatigue severity scale, modified fatigue impact scale, and fatigue descriptive scale. Gathered data analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistical Pearson's correlation coefficient. Results: Mean score for variables were as following: Fatigue severity 4 / 3 ± 1 / 6, perceived fatigue 34 / 6 ± 19 / 5, quality of fatigue 62 ± 3 / 9, and social support 65 / 6 ± 23 / 1, respectively. According to the Pearson statistical test, there was signification association between social support with fatigue severity (P = 0. 002 and r = − 0. 474), fatigue perception (P = 0. 001 and = − 0. 478), and fatigue perception sub-scales, i. e. physical (P = 0. 005, r = − 0. 432), cognitive (P = 0. 003, r = − 0. 0457), and psychosocial (P = 0. 009, r = − 0. 341), respectively. However, there was not significant relationship between social support and fatigue quality (P = 0. 59). Conclusion: According {{to the results of}} current study, all aspects of social support can impact fatigue symptoms in MS patients. Therefore, it is suggested to develop educational programs for caregivers of patients to improve the mental and physical quality of life of patients...|$|R

40|$|Treatment with {{cortisol}} {{has been}} found to decrease fatigue and increase feelings of vigor in both patients and healthy male subjects. We obtained self-reports of mood before 35 mg cortisol or placebo ingestion, 70 min later, and after the healthy female subjects performed cognitive tasks for 1 h in a double-blind within-subject study. Cortisol decreased fatigue, increased vigor, and tended to decrease tension. Effects on fatigue were largest after task performance, when fatigue had increased, suggesting that improvement of fatigue by cortisol is observed when subjects are fatigued. This is the first study to demonstrate improvements in fatigue in healthy female subjects; this is particularly relevant because of the high prevalence of hypocortisolimic <b>fatigue</b> <b>syndromes</b> in women and recent evidence that many psychiatric disorders may involve stress-induced hypocortisolemia that is responsive to cortisol replacement...|$|R

40|$|Objective. Unexplained <b>fatigue</b> <b>syndromes</b> are multidimensional {{phenomena}} that involve {{a constellation of}} symptoms. This paper explores whether typical relationship patterns are associated with self-reported and clinically rated fatigue symptoms in chronically fatigued patients. Method. Relationship patterns were assessed {{by means of the}} core conflictual relationship theme (CCRT) method. This method examines transference patterns, and was applied to interview data collected from chronically fatigued patients (N = 30). Chronic fatigue was assessed by means of a self-report questionnaire and was also rated clinically. Results. Both self-reported and clinically rated fatigue correlated with relationship themes. The intensity of fatigue related to the perception of others as not respecting and as negatively interfering. The typical reaction of the self to relationships consists of feeling disrespected, anger, passivity, and reduced feelings of self-consistency. Conclusion. Patients' perception of interpersonal relationships as distressing may be pivotal in understanding these results. Implications for clinical intervention and future research are indicated...|$|R

40|$|Sleep-wake-regulation {{has been}} shown to be {{substantially}} influenced by cytokines. The clinical relevance of this issue arises from (1) the frequency of accidents, injuries and impairment in social functioning due to sleepiness, (2) the occurrence of <b>fatigue</b> <b>syndromes</b> associated with inflammatory diseases, cancer or obesity, (3) the role of wakefulness regulation for the pathophysiology of affective and sleep disorders and (4) sedation as a side effect of psychopharmacological therapy. Experimental studies confirm the somnogenic influence of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL) - 1 ß, IL- 6 and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). These cytokines modulate centers of wakefulness regulation located in the hypothalamus, the basal forebrain and the brain stem by influencing substances involved in sleep-wake-behavior such as adenosine, nitric oxide (NO), nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), prostaglandin D 2 (PGD 2), the neurotransmitters γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glutamate and norepinephrine, as well as hormones such as growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) and corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH).

Shanghuo, a traditional Chinese concept, is a physiological process of uncoordinated response to stress with physical and mental <b>fatigue</b> <b>syndromes.</b> In this study, we investigated the main components and anti-stress effects of GHT in restrain-stressed mice. The high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) fingerprint of GHT extract was recorded and the chemicals of main peaks were identified. The effects of GHT on number and activity of nature killer (NK) and T cells, cytokines and the antioxidative activity of splenocytes were studied in restrained mice. Results showed oral administration of GHT prevented stress-induced immunocompromise by improving splenocyte number, NK cell response against mouse T cell lymphoma cells (YAC) - 1 cell and antitumor T cell response against syngeneic P 815 in the spleens of mice loaded with acute restraint stress. GHT also significantly improved the proportion of T-helper (Th) type lymphocyte, the production of Th cell-dependent cytokines and the antioxidative activity of splenocytes. These results indicated that GHT attenuates stress by increasing the numbers and activities of immunocytes in restraint mice, by exerting antioxidative activity directly or indirectly in immunocytes...|$|R

40|$|A novel gammaretrovirus, xenotropic {{murine leukemia}} virus-related virus (XMRV), has been {{identified}} in patients with prostate cancer and in patients with chronic <b>fatigue</b> <b>syndromes.</b> Standard Mus musculus labo-ratory mice lack a functional XPR 1 receptor for XMRV and are therefore not a suitable model for the virus. In contrast, Gairdner’s shrew-mice (Mus pahari) do express functional XPR 1. To determine whether Mus pahari {{could serve as a}} model for XMRV, primary Mus pahari fibroblasts and mice were infected with cell-free XMRV. Infection of cells in vitro resulted in XMRV Gag expression and the production of XMRV virions. After intraperitoneal injection of XMRV into Mus pahari mice, XMRV proviral DNA could be detected in spleen, blood, and brain. Intravenous administration of a green fluorescent protein (GFP) vector pseudotyped with XMRV produced GFP CD 4 T cells and CD 19 B cells. Mice mounted adaptive immune responses against XMRV, as evidenced by the production of neutralizing and Env- and Gag-specific antibodies. Prominent G-to-A hypermutations were also found in viral genomes isolated from the spleen, suggesting intracellular restriction of XMRV infection by APOBEC 3 in vivo. These data demonstrate infection of Mus pahari by XMRV, potential cell tropism of the virus, and immunological and intracellular restriction of virus infection in vivo. These data support the use of Mus pahari as a model for XMRV pathogenesis and as a platform for vaccine and drug development against this potential human pathogen...|$|R

40|$|Background. Prolonged <b>fatigue</b> <b>syndromes</b> {{have been}} {{proposed}} as prevalent and disabling forms of distress that occur independently of conventional notions of anxiety and depression. Methods. To investigate the genetic and environmental antecedents of common forms of psychological and somatic distress, we measured fatigue, anxiety, depression and psychological distress in 1004 normal adult twin pairs (533 monozygotic (MZ), 471 dizygotic (DZ)) over 50 years of age. Results. Familial aggregation of psychological distress, anxiety and fatigue appeared to be due largely to additive genetic factors (MZ:DZ ratios of 2 – 12 – 2 – 69). The phenotypic correlations between the psychological measures (distress, anxiety and depression) were moderate (0 – 67 – 0 – 79) and higher than that between fatigue and psychological distress (0 – 38). Multivariate genetic modelling revealed a common genetic factor contributing {{to the development of}} all the observed phenotypes (though most strongly for the psychological forms), a second independent genetic factor also influenced anxiety and depression and a third independent genetic factor made a major contribution to fatigue alone. In total, 44 % (95 % CI 25 – 60 %) of the genetic variance for fatigue was not shared by the other forms of distress. Similarly, the environmental factor determining psychological distress made negligible contributions to fatigue, which was underpinned largely by its own independent environmental factor. Conclusion. This study supports the aetiological independence of prolonged fatigue and, therefore, argues strongly for its inclusion in classification systems in psychiatry...|$|R
40|$|CONTEXT: Postcancer fatigue is a {{frequently}} occurring problem, impairing {{quality of}} life. Little {{is known about}} (neuro) physiological factors determining postcancer fatigue. It may be hypothesized that postcancer fatigue is characterized by low peripheral muscle fatigue and high central muscle fatigue. OBJECTIVES: The aims {{of this study were}} to examine whether central and peripheral muscle fatigue differ between fatigued and non-fatigued cancer survivors and to examine the effect of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) on peripheral and central muscle fatigue of fatigued cancer survivors in a randomized controlled trial. METHODS: Sixteen fatigued patients in the intervention group (CBT) and eight fatigued patients in the waiting list group were successfully assessed at baseline and six months later. Baseline measurements of 20 fatigued patients were compared with 20 non-fatigued patients. A twitch interpolation technique and surface electromyography were applied, respectively, during sustained contraction of the biceps brachii muscle. RESULTS: Muscle fiber conduction velocity (MFCV) and central activation failure (CAF) were not significantly different between fatigued and non-fatigued patients. Change scores of MFCV and CAF were not significantly different between patients in the CBT and waiting list groups. Patients in the CBT group reported a significantly larger decrease in fatigue scores than patients in the waiting list group. CONCLUSION: Postcancer fatigue is neither characterized by abnormally high central muscle fatigue nor by low peripheral muscle fatigue. These findings suggest a difference in the underlying physiological mechanism of postcancer fatigue vs. other <b>fatigue</b> <b>syndromes...</b>|$|R
40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of Diagnostic Medicine/PathobiologyDaniel U. ThomsonCattle {{health and}} welfare are of utmost concern to producers, packers, processors, and {{consumers}} of beef. In addition, poor animal welfare can lead to decreases in economic return, {{in the form of}} production losses, product losses, or even live animal losses. Two major contributors to such losses include carcass bruising and cattle fatigue, or <b>Fatigued</b> Cattle <b>Syndrome.</b> Bruising in fed beef cattle costs the industry millions of dollars annually, and cattle fatigue leads to production losses and animal death during and after transport. Much research in cattle welfare is focused upon the more vulnerable classes of cattle in the industry, such as small calves, cull beef cows, and cull dairy cows. Limited research exists on the animal welfare concerns in fed beef cattle, likely because these animals are considered healthier and better fit for transport compared to other classes. The overall goal of this research was to assess the {{health and welfare}} of fed cattle after transport to commercial slaughter facilities by addressing two large concerns in the industry: 1) bruising in fed cattle and 2) <b>Fatigued</b> Cattle <b>Syndrome</b> and its prevalence and physiologic characteristics. The first objective of this research focused upon bruising, and was to determine whether a relationship exists between trauma incurred during unloading and prevalence of carcass bruising in finished beef cattle at commercial slaughter facilities. In addition, other risk factors which may contribute to carcass bruising in finished beef cattle are addressed. The second and third objectives focused upon <b>Fatigued</b> Cattle <b>Syndrome</b> in the fed cattle population. The second objective of this research was to determine the prevalence of abnormal mobility scores and the clinical signs associated with to abnormal mobility in finished cattle in six commercial slaughter facilities across the United States. The third objective was to determine if mobility score and clinical signs reflect concurrent changes in physiologic parameters such as blood concentrations of specific biochemical markers and biomechanical integrity of hooves. This information is both valuable and novel in the fed beef cattle industry. Along with the implementation of practices that will promote better health and welfare of fed cattle presented to slaughter facilities, gathering such information will help improve animal welfare, increase economic returns, and strengthen consumer confidence in the industry...|$|R
