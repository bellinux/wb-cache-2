50|$|Floats are a {{beverage}} line {{introduced by}} the Dr Pepper Snapple Group in January 2008. Two flavors are available, A&W Float and Sunkist <b>Float.</b> The purpose <b>of</b> the concept is to mimic the flavor <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ice cream <b>float</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> given soda. Thus, the A&W flavor is intended to taste like a root beer float, while the latter is comparable to an orange creamsicle or Sunkist float.|$|R
40|$|Experimental data, such as {{the results}} of tank tests of models, render it {{possible}} to predict, at least in principle, as to how <b>a</b> hull or <b>float</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> given shape will comport itself.

25|$|On {{its first}} flights the Mussel I was {{configured}} as a seaplane, then spent a fortnight {{at the end}} of September 1926 as a landplane, appearing unsuccessfully in the Grosvenor Challenge Cup. In October it was back on <b>floats</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> different design. This pattern repeated through to the final accident; during that time the Mussel flew with floats for the Short Crusader Schneider Trophy racer and for the de Havilland Moth. Shorts set up a production line for the successful Moth floats.|$|R

In the local dialect, participation in the festival is inquired using the verb haneru (extra=ex. [...] "今日もハネル?" [...] or [...] "Are you going to haneru today?"), which was derived from the Japanese spelling of the haneto costume and the verb haneru (extra="bounce").|$|R

5000|$|A {{floatplane}} has slender pontoons, or floats, mounted {{under the}} fuselage. Two floats are common, but other configurations are possible. Only the <b>floats</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> floatplane normally {{come into contact}} with water. The fuselage remains above water. Some small land aircraft can be modified to become float planes, and in general, floatplanes are small aircraft. Floatplanes are limited by their inability to handle wave heights typically greater than 12 inches (0.31 m). These floats add to the empty weight of the airplane and to the drag coefficient, resulting in reduced payload capacity, slower rate of climb, and slower cruise speed.|$|R

40|$|The English {{of northwestern}} Ireland allows {{quantifier}} <b>float</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> previously undocumented kind in wh-questions. The quantifier all, though construed with a fronted wh-pronoun, may {{appear in a}} position considerably {{to the right of}} that pronoun. It is argued that all so stranded marks a position through which a wh-phrase has passed or in which a wh-phrase originates. The construction then provides visible evidence for intermediate derivational stages. This evidence is used to develop a new argument for successive cyclicity and to argue for overt object shift in English and for an origin site for subjects strictly within VP and below the object shift position...|$|R
