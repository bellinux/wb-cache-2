30|$|To {{construct}} the best fit of multivariate trend model it is indispensable {{to follow up}} {{the relationship between the}} flight load factors (LF) for the <b>Europe-Middle</b> <b>East</b> (EM) and the Europe-Far East (EF) with RPK and ASK.|$|R
50|$|The {{principal}} {{elements of}} the Global Cloud Xchange Global Network include five subsea cable systems operating on major global data traffic routes: the Trans-Atlantic route, the Europe-Asia route, the <b>Europe-Middle</b> <b>East</b> & Egypt route and the Intra-Asia route.|$|R
30|$|This study applied {{advanced}} {{econometric analysis}} on the load factor (LF) of flights of <b>Europe-Middle</b> <b>East</b> (EM) and Europe-Far <b>East</b> (EF) of <b>Association</b> European Airlines (AEA). The econometric analysis provides the following conclusions. The mean RPK for the EM and EF flights are 1696.92 and 9671.81 million, respectively. Likewise, the mean ASK for the EM and EF are 2450.76 and 12, 375.32 million, respectively. Therefore, both in airline transportation demand and capacity the EF flights are higher than for the EM flights. However, the average LF of the EM flights is 9.094  % higher than for the EF flights.|$|R
30|$|Moreover, Europe-Far East (EF) {{is defined}} as any {{scheduled}} flights between Europe and points east of the Middle East region, including Trans-Polar and Trans-Siberian flights. <b>Europe-Middle</b> <b>East</b> (EM) {{is defined as}} any scheduled Terminating flights between Europe and Bahrain, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Syria, United Arab Emirates, Yemen and the Democratic Republic of Yemen (Available at www.aea.be).|$|R
5000|$|From February 1964 to November 1965, wing's {{squadron}} deployments {{shifted to}} the Far East and Southeast Asia in support of operations in that area. In November, the wing's 612th Tactical Fighter Squadron moved to Misawa Air Base, Japan. The 90th Tactical Fighter Squadron {{was attached to the}} wing while it equipped with F-100s before moving to Bien Hoa Air Base, Republic of Viet Nam. The wing then briefly returned to support operations in <b>Europe-Middle</b> <b>East.</b> [...] When the 614th and 615th Tactical Fighter Squadrons moved to Phu Cat Air Base and Phan Rang Air Base in the spring of 1966, the wing was left with a single operational squadron. [...] In 1966 fighter operations at England ceased and were replaced by special operations training. [...] on 27 April the wing and its remaining squadron moved to Europe.|$|R
30|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to build econometric models that can capture the variations of load factors for <b>Europe-Middle</b> <b>East</b> and Europe-Far East airline flights. The paper’s target population is airlines that are members of the Association of European Airlines (AEA). We use multivariate time series econometric model to analyse the temporal evaluation of load factor. The best well-fitted econometric model may improve the accuracy of forecasting the load factor of these specific flights. However, in order to build the best fitted model for the load factor we are encountered to several challenges. First, we need to evaluate characteristics of available seat kilometre and revenue passenger kilometre on the load factor. Second, we need to have solid knowledge about the autocorrelation structure of the load factor. Classically, we think that the intensity of autocorrelation of time series data diminishes with more distant lags.|$|R
40|$|Background: HIV {{susceptibility}} and pathogenicity exhibit both interindividual and intergroup variability. The {{etiology of}} intergroup variability is still poorly understood, {{and could be}} partly linked to genetic differences among racial/ethnic groups. These genetic differences may be traceable to different regimes of natural selection in the 60, 000 years since the human radiation out of Africa. Here, we examine population differentiation and haplotype patterns at several loci identified through genome-wide association studies on HIV- 1 control, as determined by viral-load setpoint, in European and African-American populations. We use genome-wide data from the Human Genome Diversity Project, consisting of 53 world-wide populations, to compare measures of FST and relative extended haplotype homozygosity (REHH) at these candidate loci {{to the rest of}} the respective chromosome. Results: We find that the <b>Europe-Middle</b> <b>East</b> and Europe-South Asia pairwise FST in the most strongly associated region are elevated compared to most pairwise comparisons with the sub-Saharan African group, which exhibit very low FST. We also find genetic signatures of recent positive selection (higher REHH) at these associated regions among all groups except for sub-Saharan Africans and Native Americans. This pattern is consistent with one in which genetic differentiation, possibly due to diversifying/positive selection, occurred at these loci among Eurasians...|$|R

Conclusions These findings are concordant with those from earlier studies suggesting recent evolutionary change at immunity-related genomic regions among Europeans, and shed light on the potential genetic and evolutionary origin of population differences in HIV- 1 control. </p...|$|R
