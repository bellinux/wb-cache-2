5|$|As {{consumer}} preferences changed {{and in an}} effort to attract larger groups to the ballpark, in the late 1990s, Greer Stadium's fixed-seating capacity was reduced to 10,300 by eliminating the bleacher sections along the third base side and beyond right field, and constructing three party decks in their places. As a result, the general admission area became confined only to the existing bleachers behind the reserved seating along the first base line in right <b>field.</b> <b>A</b> fourth party area was created by repurposing unused space atop the grandstands behind home plate. Another deck was constructed behind the right-field foul pole, which, at times, featured a rentable hot tub.|$|E
5|$|As in ski jumping, team {{competitions}} {{are often}} included at ski flying events. These are contested {{as part of}} the World Cup, but points instead count towards a separate Nations Cup for teams; athletes' individual World Cup standings are unaffected.

Italy is among the top nations in Europe and had access to Italian-American players under the eligibility rules for the tournament. Thus, Australia was considered the underdog in the pool.|$|E

5|$|Because Manor Marussia {{failed to}} notify the {{stewards}} of their inability to <b>field</b> <b>a</b> car, the team was summoned by the FIA to explain why they {{did not participate in}} qualifying. However, the hearing provided sufficient evidence to the FIA's satisfaction that the team would have been unable to field their cars, even if they had violated curfew. Despite this, Ecclestone subsequently announced that Manor Marussia would have to cover their freight charges to and from Australia, costs normally covered by Formula One Management.|$|E

5|$|By August, the {{prospect}} of Alabama fielding a football team for the 1943 season was in doubt. On August 17, coach Thomas spoke to a civic group in Birmingham and stated {{he did not think}} the school would <b>field</b> <b>a</b> team in 1943 due to the unwillingness of the Army to change their policy that prohibited their cadets from participating in intercollegiate athletics. On August 23, 1943, the University Physical Education and Athletics Committee officially canceled the 1943 season. The decision was made at that time because only two Alabama players were available to compete on the squad. As the season was canceled, coach Thomas spent his time leading war bond drives and serving as president of the Tuscaloosa Exchange Club during the time the season was originally scheduled. The cancellation marked only the third time since 1892 that Alabama did not <b>field</b> <b>a</b> football team. The only other seasons the Crimson Tide did not field teams were in 1898 due to University policy that prohibited athletic teams from traveling off campus to compete and again in 1918 due to the effects of World War I.|$|E

5|$|By January 1916, the {{manpower}} of the NZEF had expanded sufficiently {{that it could}} <b>field</b> <b>a</b> full infantry division on the Western Front. Accordingly, the New Zealand and Australian Division, which had been evacuated to Egypt from Gallipoli, was disbanded and the New Zealand Division created from the original infantry brigade {{as well as two}} new brigades (the 2nd Infantry Brigade and New Zealand Rifle Brigade), which had recently arrived from New Zealand. Promoted to lieutenant colonel on 27 February 1916, Stewart took command of the newly formed 2nd Battalion, Canterbury Infantry Regiment, which was attached to the 2nd Infantry Brigade. He led the battalion for nearly the duration of its service on the Western Front.|$|E

5|$|Even before Bradford City were {{guaranteed}} {{a place in}} the Football League, the club made its first acquisitions by signing Jack Forrest and Ben Prosser from Stoke on 1 May.
