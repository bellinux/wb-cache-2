5|$|Benchley {{enrolled}} at Harvard University in 1908, again with Duryea's financial help. He joined the Delta Upsilon fraternity {{in his first}} year, and continued to partake in the camaraderie that he had enjoyed at Phillips Exeter while still doing well in school. He did especially well in his English and government classes. His humor and style began to reveal themselves during this time: Benchley was {{often called upon to}} entertain his fraternity brothers, and his impressions of classmates and professors became very popular. His performances <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>some</b> local fame, and most entertainment programs on campus and many off-campus meetings recruited Benchley's talents.|$|E
5|$|Ernest {{was born}} in England but was sent to Hanover in his {{adolescence}} for his education and military training. While serving with Hanoverian forces near Tournai against Revolutionary France, he received a disfiguring facial wound. In 1799, he was created Duke of Cumberland and Teviotdale. Although his marriage in 1815 to the twice-widowed Frederica of Mecklenburg-Strelitz met with the disapproval of his mother, Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, it proved a happy one. By 1817, King George III had only one legitimate grandchild, Princess Charlotte of Wales, and when she died in childbirth, Ernest was the senior son to be both married and not estranged from his wife. This <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>some</b> prospect of succeeding to the British throne. However, both of his unmarried older brothers quickly married, and King George's fourth son, Edward, Duke of Kent, fathered the eventual British monarch, Victoria.|$|E
5|$|To {{help him}} in tackle the {{numerous}} challenging tasks he faced in Malayan Sugar then, his future wife, Judy Hwang, <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>some</b> notes of her translation of Sun Tzu's Art of War from Chinese to English, as he is not conversant in Chinese. Khoo immediately took keen interest in the military treatise and began to learn and apply Sun Tzu's teachings into his work. Throughout his professional career, Sun Tzu's Art of War was his indispensable guide. Khoo married Judy, a former Taiwanese singer in early 1982. In 1983, he moved to Kuala Lumpur as sales and marketing manager. When Asian sugar baron Robert Kuok was invited to turn around the ailing Multi-Purpose group of companies in 1987, Khoo joined them as administration manager at Magnum Corporation. In 1989, he left Magnum to head the personnel and administration department of Metroplex Holdings Berhad, where he later became the general manager within just four months, managing The Mall shopping complex. Khoo initiated a series of management and sales policies that enabled The Mall to secure the 'Best Shopping Mall' award {{for two years in}} a row. In the same year, he began writing his first best-seller; War at Work – Applying Sun Tzu's Art of War in Today's Business World, which was a collection of memoranda based on Sun Tzu's Art of War he wrote to his managers at The Mall.|$|E

Thorpe took that advice, went to school, excelled in sports and became an Olympic champion.|$|E
25|$|Wolfgang was {{complaining}} of his eyes. I noticed {{his head was}} warm, that his cheeks were hot and very red, but that his hands were cold as ice. Moreover, his pulse was not right. So we <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>some</b> black powder and put him to bed. During the night he was rather restless {{and in the morning}} he still had the dry fever.|$|E

25|$|In 1780, {{he painted}} the portraits of King George III and his queen and {{afterwards}} received many royal commissions. This <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>some</b> influence with the Academy and {{allowed him to}} dictate {{the manner in which}} he wished his work to be exhibited. However, in 1783, he removed his paintings from the forthcoming exhibition and transferred them to Schomberg House.|$|E
25|$|While in exile, Francisco de Paula's {{education}} was neglected. Godoy, who {{shared the same}} household with the deposed royal family, <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>some</b> classes.

25|$|On {{the day of}} {{his arrival}} in Paris, on 1 May 1895, just before his first concert, Félix Mayol was met by a female friend at the station, who <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>some</b> lily-of-the-valley, a flower people {{traditionally}} exchange on 1 May in France. He pinned it on his lapel, his concert was a success and Mayol, who was superstitious, made the lily-of-the-valley his personal emblem. It was taken up by the rugby club in 1921.|$|E

25|$|His {{earlier work}} {{with his father and}} {{experience}} as a medic during the war <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>some</b> skill in healing, and many people came to the Lavra seeking his help. The Archimandrite Abbot of the monastery of the lavra blessed Hieromonk Joseph in this work and allowed him to settle in a small house near the cemetery of the monastery, so as not to disturb the other monks. There the venerable Amphilochius spent 20 years ministering to the sick. He was credited with the gift of healing.|$|E
25|$|Raised in secular Jewish culture, Novak lived {{seven decades}} as an agnostic. He briefly {{attended}} Unitarian and then Methodist {{services at the}} behest of his first and second wives, but he was not interested in either faith. He particularly disliked the Methodists' anti–Vietnam War position. Novak was introduced to Catholicism in the early 1980s when his friend Jeffrey Bell, a Republican political consultant and former Reagan aide, <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>some</b> books on the Catholic faith. At that time, Novak had nearly died from spinal meningitis.|$|E
25|$|Sometime later, Khosrow, who was keen {{to wrest}} Dara from Byzantine control, {{and would do}} so even if he risked to break the truce they had made {{regarding}} Mesopotamia, tried to capture it by tricking them; he sent one of highest officials, Izadgushasp, as a diplomat to Constantinople, but in reality the latter would stop by Dara, and {{with the aid of}} his large crew, he would seize the city. However, this plan was prevented by a former adviser of Belisarius named George, who demanded that if Izadgushasp should enter the city he should have only twenty members of his crew with him. Izadgushasp then left the city and continued his journey to Constantinople, where he was friendly welcomed by Justinian, who <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>some</b> gifts.|$|E

25|$|In a {{story that}} echoes some of the earlier tales, Ruth's son Erwin C. Ruth {{was said to have}} learned of the Peralta mine from a man called Pedro Gonzales (or Gonzalez). According to the story, in about 1912 Erwin C. Ruth gave some legal aid to Gonzales, saving him from almost certain imprisonment. In gratitude, Gonzales told Erwin about the Peralta mine in the Superstition Mountains, and <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>some</b> antique maps of the site (Gonzales claimed to be descended from the Peralta family on his mother's side). Erwin passed the {{information}} to his father Adolph, who had a long-standing interest in lost mines and amateur exploration. The elder Ruth had fallen and badly broken several bones while seeking the lost Pegleg mine in California. He had metal pins in his leg, and used a cane to help him walk.|$|E
25|$|In 1538, the Vijayanagara {{commander}} Kotikam Nagama Nayaka defeated Veerasekara Chola who {{occupied the}} Pandyan region. However, Nagama Nayakka declared {{independence from the}} Vijayanagara dynasty instead of handing back the kingdom. To check the rebellion of Nagama Nayaka, emperor Krishnadeva Raya sent a large force under Viswanatha Nayak. Vishwanatha Nayaka {{was the son of}} Nagama Nayaka. Viswanatha eventually defeated and imprisoned his father. He was rewarded by the Vijayanagara king who made him the Viceroy of the Tamil Country. Krishnadeva Raya did not punish Nagama Nayak. The emperor <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>some</b> religious work and allowed him to attend the royal court. Viswanatha Nayaka obeyed the orders of the Vijayanagara king nominally, and placed the Pandya on the throne who ruled for a while. However, Vishwanatha Nayaka later set out to rule on his own account; and in 1559 when the Vijayanagara Kingdom was in decline, he established a dynastic rule.|$|E
25|$|In 1572 {{he helped}} to prepare {{evidence}} against Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk, who, nevertheless, after his condemnation <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>some</b> rich jewels. The affairs of Mary, Queen of Scots also occasionally occupied his attention. When she arrived in England in 1567 he strongly advised her detention. In October 1577 he and Cecil visited her at Chatsworth, after she had announced that she had important secrets to reveal to Elizabeth. In 1586 he went to Fotheringay Castle and informed her of her forthcoming trial, in which he took part {{as one of the}} special commissioners. In March 1587 he urged the condemnation of William Davison in the Star Chamber. Although four times nominated an ambassador to Scotland, in 1565, 1580, 1582, and 1583, he was on each occasion detained at home, but when his name was suggested for the office in 1589, James VI expressed great readiness to receive him. Mildmay's illness, however, brought the suggestion to nothing.|$|E

25|$|After {{taking more}} captives and booty, the raiders left Mindoro {{to return to}} Mindanao. They put into the river of a little {{uninhabited}} island to get water and wood. Just at that time Governor Bravo, who was hastily returning to Manila after he had received news of the pirates, passed the island. He passed so {{near the mouth of}} the river, in three small boats with very few men, that it was a wonder that he was not seen and captured by the enemy. He learned that the enemy was there, and then he met with the twelve vessels sent from Manila in search of the raiders. The governor ordered the commander to make more haste and <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>some</b> of his own men to guide him to where he had left the pirates the day before, whereupon they went to attack them. However, the sentinels of the raiders raised the alarm, and they left the river in haste, throwing into the sea goods and slaves in order to flee more lightly.|$|E
500|$|In {{his first}} annual message to Congress, Harding sought {{the power to}} adjust tariff rates. The passage of the tariff bill in the Senate, and in conference {{committee}} became a feeding frenzy of lobbyist interests. Harding, when he enacted the Fordney–McCumber Tariff Act on September 21, 1922, made a brief signing statement, praising only that the bill <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>some</b> power to adjust rates. According to Trani and Wilson, the bill was [...] "ill-considered. It wrought havoc in international commerce and made the repayment of war debts more difficult." ...|$|E
500|$|For $20,000, {{made up of}} {{gambling}} winnings, his girlfriend's credit card, and money his father set aside for him for college, Anderson made Cigarettes & Coffee (1993), a short film connecting multiple story lines with a twenty-dollar bill. The film was screened at the 1993 Sundance Festival Shorts Program. He decided to expand the film into a feature-length film and was subsequently invited to the 1994 Sundance Feature Film Program. At the Sundance Feature Film Program, Michael Caton-Jones served as Anderson's mentor; he saw Anderson as someone with [...] "talent and a fully formed creative voice but not much hands-on experience" [...] and <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>some</b> hard and practical lessons.|$|E
