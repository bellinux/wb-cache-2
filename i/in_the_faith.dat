25|$|In other respects, however, {{both the}} Baptism and Burial {{services}} imply {{a theology of}} salvation that accords notably less with Reformed teachings than do the counterpart passages in the Thirty-Nine Articles of Religion. In the Burial service, {{the possibility that a}} deceased person who has died <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>faith</b> may nevertheless not be counted amongst God's elect, is not entertained. In the Baptism service the priest explicitly pronounces the baptised infant as being now regenerate. In both cases, conformity with strict Reformed Protestant principles would have resulted in a conditional formulation. The continued inconsistency between the Articles of Religion and the Prayer Book remained a point of contention for Puritans; and would in the 19th century come close to tearing the Church of England apart, through the course of the Gorham judgement.|$|E
25|$|The Faceless Men {{believe that}} all the slave {{population}} of Valyria prayed for deliverance to the same god of death, in different incarnations.

This belief of a single god with many incarnations or 'faces' came to {{be reflected in the}} Guild's House of Black and White, which contains a public shrine with idols of many death gods, including the Stranger of the Faith of the Seven. The worshipers of the Many-Faced God believe that death is a merciful end to suffering. God may grant a 'gift' of death to those worthy. In the Guild's temple, those who seek an end to suffering may drink from a poisonous fountain.|$|E
