25|$|An <b>expressed</b> <b>sequence</b> <b>tag</b> (EST) {{is a short}} {{nucleotide}} sequence generated from a single RNA transcript. RNA is first copied as complementary DNA (cDNA) by a reverse transcriptase enzyme before the resultant cDNA is sequenced. The Sanger method of sequencing was predominant until the advent of high-throughput methods such as sequencing by synthesis (Solexa/Illumina). Because ESTs don't require prior knowledge of the organism from which they come, {{they can also be}} made from mixtures of organisms or environmental samples. Although higher-throughput methods are now used, EST libraries commonly provided sequence information for early microarray designs, for example, a barley GeneChip was designed from 350,000 previously sequenced ESTs.|$|E
25|$|<b>Expressed</b> <b>Sequence</b> <b>Tag</b> or EST {{assembly}} {{differs from}} genome assembly in several ways. The sequences for EST assembly are the transcribed mRNA {{of a cell}} and represent only {{a subset of the}} whole genome. At a first glance, underlying algorithmical problems differ between genome and EST assembly. For instance, genomes often have large amounts of repetitive sequences, mainly in the inter-genic parts. Since ESTs represent gene transcripts, they will not contain these repeats. On the other hand, cells tend to have a certain number of genes that are constantly expressed in very high numbers (housekeeping genes), which again leads to the problem of similar sequences present in high numbers in the data set to be assembled.|$|E
2500|$|Since {{the past}} few years, {{researchers}} have indeed begun looking at non-model, [...] "non-conventional" [...] organisms using modern genetic tools. One {{example of this is}} the Floral Genome Project, which envisages to study the evolution of the current patterns in the genetic architecture of the flower through comparative genetic analyses, with a focus on EST sequences. Like the FGP, there are several such ongoing projects that aim to find out conserved and diverse patterns in evolution of the plant shape. <b>Expressed</b> <b>sequence</b> <b>tag</b> (EST) sequences of quite a few non-model plants like sugarcane, apple, lotus, barley, cycas, coffee, to name a few, are available freely online. The Cycad Genomics Project, for example, aims to understand the differences in structure and function of genes between gymnosperms and angiosperms through sampling in the order Cycadales. In the process, it intends to make available information for the study of evolution of structures like seeds, cones and evolution of life cycle patterns. Presently the most important sequenced genomes from an evo-devo point of view include those of A. thaliana (a flowering plant), poplar (a woody plant), Physcomitrella patens (a bryophyte), Maize (extensive genetic information), and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (a green alga). The impact of such a vast amount of information on understanding common underlying developmental mechanisms can easily be realised.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background We {{have applied}} a {{high-throughput}} pyrosequencing technology for transcriptome profiling of Caenorhabditis elegans {{in its first}} larval stage. Using this approach, we have generated {{a large amount of}} data for <b>expressed</b> <b>sequence</b> <b>tags,</b> which provides an opportunity for the discovery of putative novel transcripts and alternative splice variants that could be developmentally specific to the first larval stage. This work also demonstrates the successful and efficient application of a next generation sequencing methodology. Results We have generated over 30 million bases of novel <b>expressed</b> <b>sequence</b> <b>tags</b> from first larval stage worms utilizing high-throughput sequencing technology. We have shown that approximately 14 % of the newly <b>sequenced</b> <b>expressed</b> <b>sequence</b> <b>tags</b> map completely or partially to genomic regions where there are no annotated genes or splice variants and therefore, imply that these are novel genetic structures. <b>Expressed</b> <b>sequence</b> <b>tags,</b> which map to intergenic (around 1000) and intronic regions (around 580), may represent novel transcribed regions, such as unannotated or unrecognized small protein-coding or non-protein-coding genes or splice variants. <b>Expressed</b> <b>sequence</b> <b>tags,</b> which map across intron-exon boundaries (around 300), indicate possible alternative splice sites, while <b>expressed</b> <b>sequence</b> <b>tags,</b> which map near the ends of known transcripts (around 600), suggest extension of the coding or untranslated regions. We have also discovered that intergenic and intronic <b>expressed</b> <b>sequence</b> <b>tags,</b> which are well conserved across different nematode species, are likely to represent non-coding RNAs. Lastly, we have incorporated available serial analysis of gene expression data generated from first larval stage worms, in order to predict novel transcripts that might be specifically or predominantly expressed in the first larval stage. Conclusion We have demonstrated the use of a high-throughput sequencing methodology to efficiently produce a snap-shot of transcriptional activities occurring in the first larval stage of C. elegans development. Such application of this new sequencing technique allows for high-throughput, genome-wide experimental verification of known and novel transcripts. This study provides a more complete C. elegans transcriptome profile and, furthermore, gives insight into the evolutionary and biological complexity of this organism. </p...|$|R
