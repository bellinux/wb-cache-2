Currently available auditory testing methods include both behavioural and non-behavioural or objective <b>tests</b> <b>of</b> <b>hearing.</b> This study was planned with an objective to assess hearing loss in children using behavioural observation audiometry and brain stem evoked response audiometry. Methods: A total of 105 cases suffering from severe to profound hearing loss were registered. After proper history and clinical examination patients were subjected to behavioural observation audiometry (BOA) and brainstem evoked response audiometry test (BERA). Results: Out of 105 cases in 62 cases (59. 05 %) the findings of both BOA and BERA tests were similar but in 43 cases the findings <b>of</b> both <b>tests</b> were not similar. In total 18 cases (17. 14 %) diagnosis <b>of</b> severe <b>hearing</b> loss could be made by BERA <b>test</b> only because <b>of</b> in 10 cases there was inconclusive BOA finding and in 8 cases there was no response in BOA test.

40|$|In the {{evaluation}} of special populations, such as neonates, infants and malingerers, audiologist often have to rely heavily on objective measurements to assess hearing ability. Current objective audiological procedures such as tympanometry, the acoustic reflex, auditory brainstem response and transient evoked otoacoustic emissions, however, have certain limitations, contributing to the need of an objective, nonÂ¬invasive, rapid, economic <b>test</b> <b>of</b> <b>hearing</b> that evaluate hearing ability {{in a wide range}} of frequencies. The purpose of this study was to investigate distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) as an objective <b>test</b> <b>of</b> <b>hearing.</b> The main aim was to attempt to predict hearing ability at 500 Hz, 1000 Hz, 2000 Hz and 4000 Hz with DPOAEs and artificial neural networks (ANNs) in normal and hearing-impaired ears. Other studies that attempted to predict hearing ability with DPOAEs and conventional statistical methods were only able to distinguish between normal and impaired hearing. Back propagation neural networks were trained with the pattern of all present and absent DPOAE responses of 11 DPOAE frequencies of eight DP Grams and pure tone thresholds at 500 Hz, 1000 Hz, 2000 Hz and 4000 Hz. The neural network used the learned correlation between these two data sets to predict hearing ability at 500 Hz, 1000 Hz, 2000 Hz and 4000 Hz. Hearing ability was not predicted as a decibel value, but into one of several categories spanning 10 - 15 dB. Results indicated that prediction accuracy <b>of</b> normal <b>hearing</b> was 92 % at 500 Hz, 87 % at 1000 Hz, 84 % at 2000 Hz and 91 % at 4000 Hz. The prediction of hearing-impaired categories was less satisfactory, due to insufficient data for the ANNs to train on. The variables age and gender were included in some of the neural network runs to determine their effect on the distortion product. Gender had only a minor positive effect on prediction accuracy, but age affected prediction accuracy considerably in a positive way. The effect of the amount of data that the neural network had to train on was also investigated. A prediction versus ear count correlation strongly suggested that the inaccurate predictions of hearing-impaired categories is not a result of an inability of DPOAEs to predict pure tone thresholds in hearing impaired ears, but a result of insufficient data for the neural network to train on. This research concluded that DPOAEs and ANNs can be used to accurately predict hearing ability within 10 dB in normal and hearing-impaired ears from 500 Hz to 4000 Hz for <b>hearing</b> losses <b>of</b> up to 65 dB HL.

But standardizing <b>tests</b> <b>of</b> <b>hearing</b> is a difficult problem, especially in the hearing by bone conduction. Why so difficult is it in the bone conduction audiometry ? Thhere are two reasons. At first, bone conduction audiometry has more factors to be thought about in testing instruments and manipulations, for example, touching pressure of the receiver and so on. Next, the value which should be considered normal threshold fluctuates on rather wider range by bone conduction comparing with air conduction. Then, the following points are investigated in this report, i. e., "relations between the touching pressure of the receiver and the bone conduction threshold," "suitable masking noise" and "comparison <b>of</b> <b>tests</b> using continuous tone and interrupted tone. " The ressults obtained are as follows: 1. As the touching pressure increases, bone conduction threshole goes down till it holds constancy. Generally speaking, the value of suitable pressure is 700 g/ãŽ . 2. Necessary and tolerant masking noises have to be settled with one ear deaf patients and healthy men. But actual value of masking noise is to be varied in each case and in each instrument. 3. The threshold by interrupted test tone is lower than that by continuous tone.

The gold standard for audiometric test is otoacustic emission (OAE) and brainstem evoked response audiometry (BERA). They have high sensitivity and specificity, but the availability is limited and expensive. Hence, both tests are not available at the primary health care centers. In 1997, the Department of Health, Republic of Indo- nesia, established a simple subjective test instrument, i. e. the hear- ing capability test (HCT). Objective To asses the accuracy of HCT compared to the gold standard hearing tests (OAE and/or BERA).
