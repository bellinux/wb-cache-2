They can correspond in English. So I could have it as an alternate language as long as people require it and the decision for that – I would leave not to the Hindi-knowing people, but to the non-Hindi-knowing people.|$|E

The soldiers felt the sting and scowled back; the officers looked straight before them. Yet it was a valuable lesson. Only {{a few days before}} I had read in the newspapers of how the Kaffirs had jeered at the Boer prisoners when they were marched into Pietermaritzburg, saying, 'Where are your passes?' It had seemed a very harmless joke then, but now I understood how a prisoner feels these things.|$|E

The demand for tribute is not appeased by the poverty that locks up our comrades as in a jail, nor is the thirst for our blood satisfied by the continuous whippings that bite and tear our bodies to pieces.|$|E
25|$|Sagan wrote {{frequently}} {{about religion}} {{and the relationship between}} religion and science, expressing his skepticism about the conventional conceptualization of God as a sapient being. For example: Some people think God is an outsized, light-skinned male with a long white beard, sitting on a throne somewhere up there in the sky, busily tallying the fall of every sparrow. Others—for example Baruch Spinoza and Albert Einstein—considered God to be essentially the sum total of the physical laws which describe the universe. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> of any compelling evidence for anthropomorphic patriarchs controlling human destiny from some hidden celestial vantage point, but it would be madness to deny the existence of physical laws.|$|E
500|$|... "Fermín" [...] {{describes}} a mentally ill character in an institution. The song changes {{a line from}} the French folk song, [...] "Marlbrough s'en va-t-en guerre", from [...] "Mambrú se fue a la guerra, no sé cuándo vendrá" [...] ("Mambrú left for the war; <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> when he will return") to [...] "Fermín se fue a la vida, no sé cuándo vendrá" [...] ("Fermín left for life; <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> when he will return"). According to Spinetta, [...] "life for the insane is like war for the sane." [...] Reflecting on the track, Spinetta said: [...] "In front of my house lived an incredible character called Carlitos, a retarded boy, who is in part the personification of Fermín for me. With Carlitos we shared moments of joy when we were kids. Although he could not play ball with everyone, he felt accompanied in his tremendous problem when we were with him. It is also an apology, because I remember that his mother punished him a lot, even {{in front of the other}} boys. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> if the degree of illness of the song's Fermín is as actue as that of Carlitos, but serves to define the situation of the alienated as a propitious cell to receive the most aberrant injustices. [...] "Plegaria para un niño dormido" [...] urges not to wake a poor child up, letting him be happy in his dreams. The criticism of society's injustice is, in Spinetta's words, [...] "a complaint made with tenderness." [...] He called it [...] "the symbol of a Christian ideology: neighborliness, solidarity." [...] "A estos hombres tristes" [...] was inspired by the melancholy of Sundays in Argentina, with Spinetta saying: [...] "Sunday was always a sad day, <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> why. At the same time it was happy because there was football, the family gathered, there was good food. The importance that was given to the weekend in our country in those years was tremendous. But the personal solitude at that time was very clear." [...] The album ends with [...] "Laura va", a baroque pop song which took Spinetta a year and a half to write; Spinetta described it as an attempt to emulate the Beatles' [...] "She's Leaving Home".|$|E
