50|$|HAVS is a {{widespread}} recognized industrial disease affecting {{tens of thousands of}} workers. It is a disorder that affects the blood vessels, nerves, muscles, and joints, of the hand, wrist, and arm. Its best known effect is vibration-induced white finger (VWF), a term introduced by the Industrial Injury Advisory Council in 1970. Injury can occur at frequencies between 5 and 2000Hz but the greatest risk for fingers is between 50 and 300Hz. The total risk exposure for hand and arm is calculated by the use of ISO 5349-1, this stipulate a max damage between 8-16Hz and a rapidly declining risk at higher frequencies.

30|$|In Hypothesis H 2, {{we propose}} that <b>estimated</b> <b>risk</b> impact {{should have a}} {{significantly}} stronger influence on anticipated project success than <b>estimated</b> <b>risk</b> occurrence probability. Contrary to what was predicted, only the influence of <b>estimated</b> <b>risk</b> occurrence probability {{was found to be}} significant (γ = − 0.362, p <  0.001), while <b>estimated</b> <b>risk</b> impact did not have significant influence (γ =  0.026, p =  0.880). Furthermore, the path coefficient of <b>estimated</b> <b>risk</b> impact to anticipated project success is slightly positive, which therefore does not indicate that higher <b>estimated</b> <b>risk</b> impact would reduce anticipated project success. Using linear regression analysis, we test if <b>estimated</b> <b>risk</b> impact accounts for a significant R 2 of anticipated project success, which was not the case (R 2  =  0.006, F(1202) =  1.30, p =  0.256). When adding <b>estimated</b> <b>risk</b> occurrence probability to the regression model, R 2 increased significantly (R_change^ 2  =  0.107, F(1201) =  24.17, p <  0.001). Accordingly, H 2 has to be rejected, as the results show that <b>estimated</b> <b>risk</b> impact has no significant effect on anticipated project success, while the effect of <b>estimated</b> <b>risk</b> occurrence probability on anticipated project success is significant.|$|R

30|$|To {{test for}} the {{mediation}} of risk awareness as proposed in H 3, we first consider the path from overconfidence to the potential mediator of risk awareness: overconfidence led to significantly decreased levels of risk awareness (γ = − 0.178, p =  0.016). Second, risk awareness significantly influenced both <b>estimated</b> <b>risk</b> occurrence probability (γ =  0.236, p =  0.005) and <b>estimated</b> <b>risk</b> impact (γ =  0.247, p =  0.032). Excluding the risk awareness construct to assess the total effect of overconfidence on risk assessment clarified the relationship between overconfidence and both <b>estimated</b> <b>risk</b> occurrence probability (before: γ = − 0.115, p =  0.35; after: γ = − 0.143, p =  0.30) and <b>estimated</b> <b>risk</b> impact (before: γ = − 0.024, p =  0.87; after: γ = − 0.143, p =  0.51). This finding indicates a mediation of risk awareness, as furthermore all path coefficients from and to the mediator are significantly different from zero (Eggert et al. 2005). To test the mediating effect, Zhao et al. (2010) suggest the bootstrapping method developed by Preacher et al. (2007). In applying this method, we found a significant indirect effect of overconfidence on risk occurrence probability through risk awareness (p =  0.039, one-tailed), but the effect of overconfidence on <b>estimated</b> <b>risk</b> impact was only significant to a probability of error of p <  0.1 (p =  0.079, one-tailed). A Sobel z-test (Baron and Kenny 1986) resulted in similar values: a significant indirect effect of overconfidence on risk occurrence probability (p =  0.032, one-tailed), but only a nearly significant effect of overconfidence on risk impact (p =  0.063, one-tailed). We did not uncover a significant, direct impact of overconfidence on <b>estimated</b> <b>risk</b> occurrence probability (γ = − 0.115, p =  0.345); we therefore cannot confirm H 4 a. Similarly, {{we were not able}} to uncover a significant, direct impact of overconfidence on <b>estimated</b> <b>risk</b> impact (γ = − 0.024, p =  0.867), we thus cannot confirm H 4 b.|$|R

Each measured position {{may be viewed as}} a direction, expressed as a unit vector in three dimensions and incorporating some error. In this sequence, the true directions are expected to be close to one another at nearby times. A simple trend estimator that respects the geometry of the sphere is to compute a running average over the time-ordered observed direction vectors, then normalize these average vectors to unit length. This paper treats a considerably richer class of competing directional trend estimators that respect spherical geometry. The analysis relies on a nonparametric error model for directional data in $R^q$ that imposes no symmetry or other shape restrictions on the error distributions. Good trend estimators are selected by comparing <b>estimated</b> <b>risks</b> of competing estimators under the error model.

40|$|Sharpe's, Treynor's and Jensen's {{measures}} have been extensively used for the performance evaluation of mutual funds or portfolios. These three widely used performance {{measures have}} been found to be highly correlated with their corresponding risk measures by a number of empirical studies. This paper focuses the investigation on the possible sources of the bias associated with the empirical relationship between the estimated Sharpe's measure and its <b>estimated</b> <b>risk</b> measure. In general, the sample size, the investment horizon and the market conditions are three important factors in determining the strong relationship between the ex-post Sharpe's measure and its <b>estimated</b> <b>risk</b> surrogate. The interesting findings of this study are as follows: (1) the estimated Sharpe's measure is uncorrelated with the <b>estimated</b> <b>risk</b> measure either when the risk free rate of interest equals the expected return on the market portfolio over the sample period or when the sample size is infinite, (2) the estimated Sharpe's measure is positively (or negatively) correlated with the <b>estimated</b> <b>risk</b> measure if the risk-free rate of interest is greater than (or less than) the expected return on the market portfolio, (3) an observation horizon shorter than the true investment horizon can reduce the dependence of the estimated Sharpe's measure on its <b>estimated</b> <b>risk</b> measure, and (4) an observation horizon longer than the true investment horizon will magnify the dependence. The results have indicated that, in conducting empirical research, a shorter observation horizon and a large sample size should be used to reduce the bias associated with the estimated Sharpe's measure. finance: investments, portfolio, statistics: sampling...|$|R
40|$|Decision-analytic {{measures}} to assess clinical utility of prediction models and diagnostic tests incorporate the relative clinical consequences of true and false positives {{without the need}} for external information such as monetary costs. Net Benefit is a commonly used metric that weights the relative consequences in terms of the risk threshold at which a patient would opt for treatment. Theoretical results demonstrate that clinical utility is affected by a model';s calibration, the extent to which <b>estimated</b> <b>risks</b> correspond to observed event rates. We analyzed the effects of different types of miscalibration on Net Benefit and investigated whether and under what circumstances miscalibration can make a model clinically harmful. Clinical harm is defined as a lower Net Benefit compared with classifying all patients as positive or negative by default. We used simulated data to investigate the effect of overestimation, underestimation, overfitting (<b>estimated</b> <b>risks</b> too extreme), and underfitting (<b>estimated</b> <b>risks</b> too close to baseline risk) on Net Benefit for different choices of the risk threshold. In accordance with theory, we observed that miscalibration always reduced Net Benefit. Harm was sometimes observed when models underestimated risk at a threshold below the event rate (as in underestimation and overfitting) or overestimated risk at a threshold above event rate (as in overestimation and overfitting). Underfitting never resulted in a harmful model. The impact of miscalibration decreased with increasing discrimination. Net Benefit was less sensitive to miscalibration for risk thresholds close to the event rate than for other thresholds. We illustrate these findings with examples from the literature and with a case study on testicular cancer diagnosis. Our findings strengthen the importance of obtaining calibrated risk models. status: publishe...|$|E

30|$|<b>Estimates</b> of <b>risk</b> impact—unlike risk {{occurrence}} probability—appear insufficiently {{considered when}} project managers form expectations about project success. Therefore, {{and especially for}} high-impact risks, risk management efforts should focus on planning risk responses to reduce their potential impact, should such risks occur. The finding that project managers do not consider <b>estimated</b> <b>risk</b> impact—the consequences of which are linked directly to project outcomes—in anticipated project success is different from what decision theory would predict. Future research may help to clarify why only risk occurrence probability is considered when anticipating project success. This finding—that project risks are inadequately considered in anticipated project success—is of crucial importance for project management, as it offers an explanation as to why so many projects fail, i.e., do not comply with predefined budgets, time constraints, or product scope and quality. Overconfidence leads project managers through the mediator of risk awareness, to assess <b>estimated</b> <b>risk</b> occurrence probability and <b>estimated</b> <b>risk</b> impact more optimistically. The mediation through risk awareness indicates that overconfidence {{may be linked to}} the reduced availability of risks, which leads to risks being perceived as non-threatening and unlikely to occur. Such biased risk assessment may lead companies to start seemingly beneficial projects which later show an unfavorable benefit–cost ratio, indicating that they should have never been undertaken in the first place.|$|R
