40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the issues of}} porting software from one machine environment to another. Some general observations are made about the definition of Portability and the design and portability of programs written in high level programming languages, in particular Fortran. Two areas of portability are considered in detail: (i) Portability Criteria and Measures - The main <b>criteria</b> <b>affecting</b> the portability of Fortran applications are identified and possible measures {{of the effects of}} these criteria considered. A Portability Function is defined for obtaining a measure of the percentage portability of Fortran programs. (ii) Portability Assistant - The use of existing analysis tools to obtain measures of the <b>criteria</b> <b>affecting</b> the portability of Fortran programs is considered. A portability assistant is provided {{in the form of an}} Ingres Relational Database, which holds die data obtained from these measures, enables the portability function to be applied to the application and assists in the porting of the application.

The research identifies key decision criteria that small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Sweden use to compare and evaluate B 2 B insurances before taking a purchasing decision. This leads to the understanding of <b>criteria</b> <b>affecting</b> customer preference. The criteria quality, performance, reliability, flexibility and deductible are included.   The result showed that there is a relationship between performance, flexibility, reliability and customer preference. These <b>criteria</b> <b>affect</b> customer preference and thereby also the choice of business insurance provider. No relationship between deductible, quality and customer preference was detected. The study concludes that flexibility, performance and reliability are key decision criteria business customers use to compare and evaluate B 2 B insurances.

30|$|Land {{degradation}} and desertification consequences such as dust storms, drying of lakes, water scarcity, poverty and migration, and ultimately ecosystem collapse in Iran {{with more than}} 75 % drylands require a carefully understanding of the desertification process and recognizing driving forces. This study examines {{the performance of a}} statistical method to identify the most important <b>criteria</b> <b>affecting</b> desertification process and risk. Studied region showed desertification-prone areas with 63 % high-risk level of desertification. Application of regression trees and random forest techniques identified the most important <b>criteria</b> <b>affecting</b> desertification and recognized that indicators such as wind erosion, technology development, aridity index, slope index, precipitation, vegetation state and land use change are major indicators affecting the quality of criteria and desertification in the Taybad-Bakharz. The results of this research indicated that erosion factors including water and wind erosion are the most important desertification factors in the studied area. Over-grazing and vegetation degradation in the region particularly in recent decade led to degraded soils and decreasing fertility, so the erosion rate is raising in the study area. Data mining process and particularly regression trees and random forest technique in desertification hazard can be recommended as a robust base for further investigation of desertified lands for best management of processes in these areas.|$|R

This study aims to develop a building energy performance analysis tool, especially for the construction of buildings for higher education facilities in Indonesia. Design criteria for the analysis of energy performance in buildings was developed based on the design attributes that influence the energy performance of buildings for thermal comfort and lighting. Identification and analysis of building design <b>criteria</b> <b>affecting</b> energy performance were calculated using the Important Performance Analysis (IPA). To analyze the level of interest among the criteria used MCDM 23 that developed by International Energy Agency (IEA) Solar Heating and Cooling Task 23. MCDM analysis use Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) model. The results of the IPA analysis showed important design <b>criteria</b> <b>affecting</b> energy performance in higher education buildings, covering categories: (1) the location of the building, (2) thermal reduction efforts around the building, (3) building plans, (4) the form of architecture, (5) structural and building envelope design for comfort temperature, (6) structural and building envelope design for convenience lighting, (7) the interior space, and (8) ventilating, air conditioning systems and artificial lighting.

40|$|Background: With nearly 20 % of the U.

Methods: Medicaid billing data from 2009 to 2011 were analyzed to calculate the distance and duration that a Medicaid patient population had to travel when seeking primary care in the 29 rural counties of eastern North Carolina. Primary care codes were analyzed to detect any differences in access patterns for various complexity levels of physician visits. Data were also used to evaluate health professional shortage areas (HPSA) designations in eastern North Carolina based on current federal definition. Results: There was a significant difference in patient visits when comparing HPSA-defined travel times of more or less than 20 miles or 30 minutes; however, the average patient received a sufficient number of primary care visits annually (average ~ 3) with distance and duration having limited effect on the amount of care the patients received.

Many {{of the classic}} regional development programmes {{have been criticized for}} being ineffective and failing to meet their intended goals. A fact that is often overlooked in such assessments is that policy programmes are living entities that unfold in history. As a result, their efficacy is contingent. The US Economic Development Administration provides an excellent case study for exploring the challenges facing policies designed to reconcile inequality either between individuals or across locations. The history of the agency presents a cautionary tale of the prospects and pitfalls associated with policy interventions that are pulled in opposing directions: improve conditions for distressed locations but without providing the resources necessary to accomplish the task and legitimize the overall effort by setting the <b>designation</b> <b>criteria</b> so loosely that almost any place qualifies as a distressed county.
