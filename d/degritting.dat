50|$|RCBR {{technology}} is totally a water biological treatment system, {{able to make}} more compact and efficient the biology of any wastewaters treatment plant. For the depuration of urban wastewaters it is placed downline of primary treatments (screening, oil separation, <b>degritting,</b> primary settling) and upline of water physical or chemical disinfection tertiary treatments (ultraviolets, ozone). This system offers the chance to realize into restrained spaces a huge surface of cohesion for the bacteria colonies, which are active for the depuration; this aspect makes it particularly suitable also for the nitrogen removal from wastewaters, in nitro-denitro configuration. Matching a series of more modules, some of them totally submerged by the wastewaters (in anoxic conditions) operate as denitrification stadium. Others, only partially submerged into the wastewaters, in presence of oxygen, operate the carbon removal and, at the same time, the ammonium nitrification. The system simplicity and the efficiency demonstrated in the tearing down also high elevations of suspended solid and organic carbon, make it usable as a pre-treatment, upline of drinkable systems of superficial and underground polluted waters (rivers, drains, stratum, ponds and temporary puddles of rain water).|$|E

Separation of alunite from kaolinite by physical separation methods was proved quite difficult, since aluni-te grains were also disintegrated to ultrafine particle size range as kaolinite. Both acidic and alkaline leaching tests were applied to reduce the sulphur content of the sample and a final product containing 0. 73 % SO 3 was obtained by alkaline leaching. Although {{it was possible to}} obtain a final product with 0. 48 % SO 3 by roasting at 1000 ° C, due to conversion of kaolinite into metakaolinite, the casting property of the sample affected adversely...|$|E
40|$|This paper summarises the {{performance}} of three biological nutrient removal sewage treatment plants in Queensland (Australia), These plants are "extended aeration" types, treating screened, <b>degritted</b> raw sewage using a configuration similar to the " 3 -Stage Phoredox" concept but including an oxidation ditch as the anoxic/aerobic reactor. A summary of the design loads and other plant parameters is provided, along with summary plant effluent data {{over a period of}} up to six years. The results show that these plants achieved excellent nutrient removal performance (geometric mean total N < 3 mgN/L and total P < 2 mgP/L achieved), through a combination of biological and simultaneous chemical removal using alum, despite the lack of filters on the secondary effluent. Effluent suspended solids were typicall...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{investigated}} {{the performance of}} Salsnes Filter (SF) as a secondary treatment after biological treatment processes at Nordre Follo Renseanlegg (NFR) wastewater treatment plant. Wastewater from {{moving bed biofilm reactor}} (MBBR) from Reactor 5, was coagulated/flocculated and filtered on a prototype pilot scale SF 500 filter. The investigation included use of PAX- 18 aluminum inorganic coagulant, cationic polymers (C- 496, C- 490), and anionic polymer (A- 130), in conjunction with flocculation. A bench scale SF apparatus was used for predictions and selecting optimum parameters for pilot scale coagulation/flocculation with SF fine mesh sieves sizes 250, 210, 158, 90, 54, 33 and 18 µm. Pilot scale testing on the prototype SF 500 and on a SF 1000 full scale filter were conducted after bench scale testing. PAX- 18 and Superfloc C- 496 were selected as optimum chemicals to be used on pilot scale coagulation/flocculation testing. Optimum G-value and flocculation time were of 67. 8 s - 1 and 10 min respectively were investigated and used. An optimum dosage of 94. 6 mg Al/g TSS + 7. 1 mg C- 496 /g TSS was used to achieve filtrate containing TP (< 0. 3 mg/L), TSS (< 30 mg/L) and COD (< 50 mg/L), for removal efficiency of 96 %, 98 % and 88 % respectively, using a 33 µm fine mesh sieve. The pH change, filtration rate and power consumption in the process were also monitored. Particle size characterization of raw NFR primary (<b>degritted)</b> wastewater and MBBR biofilm wastewater were also investigated using FlowCAM and Malvern Mastersizer 3000 after bench scale SF apparatus with sieve openings from 350 to 18 µm. The SF 1000 was also used for NFR primary (<b>degritted)</b> wastewater characterization investigationswith both 33 µm and 350 µm fine mesh openings...|$|R

The system included primary clarification and sludge storage facilities, and a 0. 55 m (1. 8 ft) disc diameter, 20. 9 m^ 2 (225 ft^ 2) four-stage rotating disc treatment unit. The test unit was tested at four hydraulic loadings of 0. 09 to 0. 27 m^ 3 /day/m^ 2 (2. 25 - 6. 7 gpd/ft^ 2). Peripheral rotational disc speed was constant at 0. 3 m/s (1. 0 fps) and waste water temperate was 27 °C to 28 °C during the study. 	At hydraulic loadings of 0. 09 to 0. 27 m^ 3 /day/m^ 2 (2. 25 - 6. 7 gpd/ft^ 2) of disc area, the test unit achieved respectively 94 to 82 % overall removal of carbonaceous BOD 5 and 96 to 82 % overall removal of suspended solids when treating <b>degritted</b> raw domestic waste water. This yielded effluent concentrations of 12 to 32 mg/l BOD 5 and 7 to 21 mg/l suspended solids. Sludge production from the disc section was 0. 40 to 0. 50 mass units sludge produced per mass unit BOD 5 removed in the disc section. 	Low maintenance requirements, low power consumption, and resistance {{to the effects of}} hydraulic surges make the rotating disc process very attractive for package plant installations in Hawaii. In-place equipment cost for rotating disc package systems treating sewage volumes of 94. 5 m^ 3 /day (25, 000 gpd) and 378 m^ 3 /day (100, 000 gpd) were estimated to be about 10 % higher than for extended aeration and high-rate activated sludge package systems. However, the total annual cost over a 20 -yr period was respectively about 14 % and 20 % lower for the rotating disc package systems than the extended aeration and high-rate activated sludge package systems...|$|R
40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of a sloped rock-grass filtration system in treating municipal wastewater was tested on a 24 m by 36 m (80 ft by 120 ft) slope on a 2. 5 percent grade sown {{with a mixture of}} rye grass, fescue grass, and bluegrass. The field was divided into six plots, each approximately 3. 5 m wide and 36 m long. Three of the plots (slope-rock) were constructed with 9 m of gravel, 7. 6 cm deep, on {{the upper reaches of the}} slope. Raw (screened, <b>degritted)</b> municipal wastewater from Hyrum, Utah, was applied to the slope-rock sections at application rates of 13 and 20 cm/wk the first year of operation (June through October 1979) and 23, 41, and 51 cm/wk the second year (June through October 1980). The other three plots were constructed as conventional overland flow slopes. Wastewater was applied at rates of 13 and 20 cm/wk the first year and 23, 41, adn 57 cm/wk the second year. The gravel layer increased infiltration and, therefore, decreased the amount of wastewater effluent recovered. The gravel also increased wastewater detention times on the treatment slopes. In general, the slope-rock sections acheived higher mass removal associated with greater water losses. However, the gravel layer had no statistically significant effect, at the 95 percent confidence level, on the concentration of pollutants. On a concentation basis, BOD 5 removal for the test sections were 87 to 93 percent. BOD 5 effluent averages ranges from 6 to 12 mg/ 1. Mean effluent suspended solids ranged from 5 to 9 mg/ 1. Even at the highest hydraulic laoding rate (57 cm/wk), effluent quality met the 1985 State of Utah effluent limits. Total phospohorus reductions were only 20 to 33 percent. Orthophosphate concentrations increased on all slopes. Ammonia removals, 69 to 93 percent, were achieved at the lower loadings (13 cm/wk, 20 cm/wk and 23 cm/wk). The highest loading (57 cm/wk) exhibited 33 to 43 percent removal. Nitrification of ammonia occurred on all the slopes. Fecal coliforms were reduced by as much as 99 percent on some of the slopes, but effluent fecal coliforms were not reduced below 10 ^ 4 colonies/ 100 ml. Harvesting temporarily decreased system performance. Effluent BOD 5 and suspended solids concentrations, however, still did not violate effluent discharge limits (i. e., 15 mg/ 1 BOD 5, and 10 mg/ 1 SS, 30 day average) for the State of Utah...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the performance of Salsnes Filter (SF) as a primary treatment prior to hollow fiber membrane bioreactor (HFMB) for nitrogen removal. The objective {{was to determine whether}} influent particle size removed during primary treatment had any detrimental effect on downstream biological processes, especially nitrogen removal. The pilot scale testing was conducted at Nordre Follo Wastewater Treatment Plant, Oslo region, Norway. This pilot system comprised of two anoxic tanks and one aerobic tank with hollow fiber membrane. Hollow fiber module type ZW- 10 was provided by GE Water Technologies. One system was fed with influent wastewater that has been filtered with SF 2 mm and represents the <b>degritted</b> wastewater (treatment Train C), while the other system was filtered specifically with SF 33 μm (treatment Train D). Two boundary conditions were used, the first investigated SF and MBR as the whole system, and the last reviewed the effect of different particle size on the performance of MBR system. For both boundary conditions, it was found that both treatment trains have similar capability in reducing Total Suspended Solids (TSS), Total Chemical Oxygen Demand (TCOD), Total Biochemical Oxygen Demand (TBOD 5), and Total Phosphorus (TP) with average removal percentage of 99 %, 92 %, 99 %, and 79 % respectively, which met the discharge requirement criteria. However, Total Nitrogen (TN) effluent results showed that treatment Train C has better average removal efficiency of 73 % compared to treatment Train D’s 68 % due to higher TCOD/TN ratio after SF treatment. Low TCOD/TN ratio in treatment Train D hampered the denitrification process, as confirmed by lower denitrification rate and higher NO 3 -N concentration in the permeate than its counterpart. Nitrification and denitrification were proven to be the main factor of biological nitrogen removal compared to cell assimilation process. The HFMB operated smoothly during the experiment, with no excessive fouling detected. Membrane in treatment Train C experienced more frequent rapid transmembrane pressure (TMP) peaks due to abundance of organic and organic matters, making it more vulnerable of membrane fouling for long term operation. Overall, both systems produced high quality effluent and free of TSS, even though treatment Train C was susceptible of membrane fouling and treatment Train D had slight problem in its nitrogen removal process. Further economic observation should be implemented to decide which system is more cost effective between the requirement of more frequent membrane maintenance cleaning for treatment Train C or external carbon source addition for treatment Train D...|$|R
