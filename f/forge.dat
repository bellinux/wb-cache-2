5|$|As Voyager {{installs}} the Isodesium, a ship is {{sent from}} the <b>Forge</b> to tear Voyager apart for resources. Tuvok leads the Hazard Team {{to a nearby}} derelict dreadnought gunship to use the gunship's weaponry to destroy the incoming ship, but is only successful in disabling it as it attaches to Voyager. Voyager is consequently swarmed by crab-like aliens intent on carrying off crew and cargo, although the crew manages to eliminate these aliens. Munro prompts the captain to counterattack, in order to destroy the dampening field projected by the station. The Hazard Team uses the Forge's ship to infiltrate the <b>Forge</b> and disable its defensive systems, allowing the Voyager crew to attack using shuttlecraft; however, Crewman Biessman is killed while waiting for Voyagers reinforcements. The Forge's power core is destroyed, thereby dropping the dampening field. Munro, however, learns of the species behind the <b>Forge,</b> the Vohrsoth, and the station's true purpose: to harvest the genetic features of those trapped by the <b>Forge</b> to create an army designed for conquering the galaxy. Munro disobeys orders to ensure the Vohrsoth cannot recreate the <b>Forge</b> and kills the Vohrsoth commander. With power restored, Voyager attacks the <b>Forge</b> and destroys the station, beaming Munro off {{in the last few}} moments. Voyager and other active ships in the area are freed, and Munro is promoted to lieutenant.|$|E

50|$|<b>Forged</b> {{magnesium}} {{wheels are}} manufactured by mechanically deforming (<b>forging)</b> a prefabricated rod using a powerful <b>forging</b> press. Several somewhat different <b>forging</b> techniques exist, {{all of them}} comprising a multi-step process/operation. The resultant <b>forging</b> is subsequently machined (lathe-turned and milled) into the final shape of a wheel by removing excess metal from the <b>forged</b> blank. A <b>forged</b> magnesium wheel is 25 percent lighter than cast wheel. The main disadvantage of <b>forged</b> wheels is the high manufacturing cost. And due to the typically high costs of finished wheels, <b>forged</b> wheels are still rarely purchased by non-professional drivers for regular road use. But since <b>forged</b> wheels can be designed to be lighter than cast wheels for a given load, <b>forged</b> wheels do offer fuel economy and other distinct advantages. The <b>forging</b> process allows alignment of the metal fibers and optimization of the directional pattern arrangement along the spokes of a wheel. This, along with the smaller grain size, results in superior mechanical properties and performance characteristics that make <b>forged</b> magnesium wheels widely popular both for motor racing and with knowledgeable driving enthusiasts.|$|R

In addition, tensile tests of the <b>forged</b> specimens were carried out at room temperature and the microstructure was observed using an optical microscope. In the <b>forging</b> tests, the specimens could be <b>forged</b> from 18 mm to 2. 5 mm in thickness at <b>forging</b> temperatures of more than 423 K.

5000|$|The {{second half}} of the 19th century was marked with the {{appearance}} of hydraulic <b>forging</b> presses that started to replace hammers at <b>forging</b> works. <b>Forging</b> in <b>forging</b> presses is carried out by two dies of which one makes reciprocal movements and the other one remains stationary. This is the reason for relatively low productivity and high labour intensity of conventional <b>forging</b> in presses. The <b>forging</b> of low-ductility and hard-to-deform steels and alloys by two dies using conventional <b>forging</b> methods is very difficult and sometimes is practically impossible because of high tensile stresses in deformation zone leading to various <b>forging</b> defects and high percentage of rejected products.In the 1970s the mechanical radial <b>forging</b> machines (RFM) started to be used for the large-scale production of long-axis forgings where a work piece is reduced in radial directions simultaneously by several pairs of dies. The process of radial <b>forging</b> in mechanical RFM features high productivity of <b>forging.</b> However small single reductions of a work piece restricted by the design of these machines lead to localization of strains mainly in surface zones of the work piece while metal in the core zone remains unworked. [...] In 80-90s hydro-mechanical and hydraulic radial <b>forging</b> machines appeared that do not have the disadvantages inherent to mechanical RFM. Nevertheless, radial <b>forging</b> machines are very specific and very expensive equipment in comparison with multipurpose <b>forging</b> presses. The application of such machines at enterprises {{with a wide range of}} forgings manufactured is economically disadvantageous and inexpedient.The problem of manufacturing long-axis forgings by radial <b>forging</b> method in open-die hydraulic <b>forging</b> presses can be solved with use of multi-die <b>forging</b> devices. First such devices different in design and principle of operation appeared in the 1980s. At present, the most widespread and famous is the four-die <b>forging</b> device of the above described design engineered by Ukrainian and Russian scientists. The four-die <b>forging</b> devices have no analogues in the world now. They are successfully used at works in Russia, Ukraine, Spain, China and Germany.|$|R
