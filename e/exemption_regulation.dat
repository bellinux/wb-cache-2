5000|$|The Block <b>Exemption</b> <b>Regulation</b> is an {{exemption}} {{in a business}} line or industry, which debars organizations in the industry from some business activities {{in order to create}} competition. The regulation is highly known in the automobile industry due to the effect caused by the Block <b>Exemption</b> <b>Regulation</b> (BER) from the European Commission. BER has changed the automobile industry in the last decade. Prior to 2003 automobile owners in the EU region risk nullifying their vehicle warranty when the vehicles were serviced or repaired in workshops not belonging to the vehicle manufacturer or its dealers. This barrier was broken in October 2003, when the European Commission (EC) passed a law allowing vehicle owners the freedom of having their servicing and repairs done at their chosen workshop.|$|E
5000|$|Automobile repair {{workshops}} {{that are}} independently {{owned and operated}} businesses. These may also include regional or national chains and franchises including OEM car dealership sites. In the United States, these sites are commonly certified by their respective manufacturer to perform warranty and recall repairs by that manufacturer or distributor. Independent automobile repair shops in the US may also achieve certification through manufacturer sponsored programs. In the European Union a recent law (The EC Block <b>Exemption</b> <b>Regulation</b> 1400/2002 (October 2003)) allows motorists more flexibility in selecting {{where they can get}} their car serviced. Due to this legislation, maintenance and service work {{does not have to be}} done by the main dealer as long as the garage uses Original Equipment 'Matching Quality' parts, and are recorded as such, and the garage follow the manufacturer's service schedules. The Block <b>Exemption</b> <b>Regulation</b> (BER) covers service and maintenance during the warranty period and prohibits vehicle manufacturers’ warranties from including conditions that require normal maintenance to be provided within the vehicle manufacturer’s network or that all parts used must be the manufacturer’s original spare parts. This means that motorists benefit from open market competition in aftermarket parts, repairs and services thus reducing the cost of servicing through better labor rates and competitively priced parts. Also, some auto repair shops provide additional towning services.|$|E

40|$|Aim: In 1994, the General Scheme made {{a survey}} of the 30 {{diseases}} (ALD 30) allowing patients exemption from co-payments for related medical care. One of the aims of this survey was to determine the average cost per patient benefiting from this regulation in comparison to total reimbursements made by the scheme and to analyse the cost distribution according to type of care and clinical diagnosis. Method: 2 % of a total sample of 67, 828 patients covered by the <b>exemption</b> <b>regulation</b> in November 1994 were randomly selected and compared to all reimbursements to patients from June to November 1994 by using the database contained in the general scheme’s information system (SIAM). Results: The average annual cost per patient covered by the <b>exemption</b> <b>regulation</b> was estimated to be 35, 991 F (± 692). Almost half of this amount was for inpatient stays in public hospitals. The annual cost extrapolated to all patients covered by the <b>exemption</b> <b>regulation</b> was estimated to be 143, 7 billion F, or 35 % of all in kind reimbursements paid by the general scheme of French Health Insurance. “Mental Disorders” represented the greatest part (23 %) of all reimbursements made to patients covered by the <b>exemption</b> <b>regulation.</b> Conclusion: This survey allowed us to calculate the average cost per patient exempted from making copayments.

The exemption regards the application of competition rules to certain types of agreements in the insurance sector, joint compilations, tables and studies which involve the exchange of information between insurers; and also the common coverage of risk via co-(re) insurance pools. On 17 March, the European Commission released a report focusing {{on the future of}} the Insurance Block <b>Exemption</b> <b>Regulation</b> in which it is recommended to not renew IBER. This recommendation comes from the consideration that consumers were not receiving a fair share of the resulting benefits from the cooperation exempted by IBER and that is a Commission’s long-term strategy to eliminate industry-specific exemptions from competition law. This paper aims to investigate, under a law and economics approach, if other factors can be relevant in deciding to not provide any more exemptions for the insurance companies. After an introduction, in the following part, the economics effects of the exchange of information are analysed in terms of asymmetric information remedy and competition restrictions; then the story of the block exemption is presented and the next paragraph deals with the change in the insurance market after the end of the exemption; finally, some conclusive remarks are drawn in the light of the Big Data era...|$|E

40|$|The sharp {{increase}} in academic patenting over the past 20 years raises important issues regarding the generation and diffusion of academic knowledge. Three key questions may be raised in this respect: What is behind the surge in academic patenting? Does patenting affect {{the quality and quantity}} of universities' scientific output? Does the patent system limit the freedom to perform academic research? The present paper summarizes the existing literature on these issues. The evidence suggests that academic patenting has only limited effects on the direction, pace and quality of research. A virtuous cycle seems to characterise the patent-publication relationship. Secondly, scientific anti-commons show very little effects on academic researchers so far, limited to a few countries with weak or no research <b>exemption</b> <b>regulations.</b> In a nutshell, the evidence leads us to conclude that the benefits of academic patenting on research exceed their potential negative effects. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|For {{a variety}} of reasons, {{it is likely that}} the market {{definition}} approach will remain an important tool in competition policy analysis for some time, despite the increased importance of other tools such as the simulation approach. Against the background of the new block <b>exemption</b> <b>regulation</b> for cars in Europe, we explore an econometric approach to define the relevant markets with differentiated products. On the one hand, the approach is directly consistent with the SSNIP-test, and it is in fact more satisfactory than previous approaches, such as critical elasticity analysis or the simple use of standard industry classifications. On the other hand, the approach shares a lot of features with the simulation approach (similar data requirements, and similar assumptions about current market power). We find that the relevant market for minivan cars is defined at the widest level, i. e. at the aggregate country level. Furthermore, in Italy the relevant markets for domestic cars are defined at an intermediate level, i. e. at the segment level. In all other cases, the relevant markets for cars may be defined at the narrowest level, i. e. at the subsegment level. Based on these results, we identify the firms that may violate the market share thresholds stipulated in the block <b>exemption</b> <b>regulation.</b> We find that, if we would have used an approach based on standard industry classifications instead of our econometric approach, our conclusions would have been different and, in fact, inconclusive. We also draw attention to other issues in market definition that may be of use to practitioners. competition policy; market definition...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{evaluates the}} new Vertical Block <b>Exemption</b> <b>Regulation</b> and {{accompanying}} Guidelines regarding their treatment of selective distribution. Further, {{it makes a}} prospective examination of the view on selective distribution in European Competition Law, especially regarding online sales. During the ten years that passed since the last Vertical Block <b>Exemption</b> <b>Regulation</b> and accompanying Guidelines were introduced, the global market has developed in a rushing speed, much thanks to the Internet. The growing online markets have created enormous opportunities as well as problems, by shrinking the world and completely change the possibility to control markets. Therefore, the treatment of online distribution was at heart of the discussion when the old rules were to be reviewed. The main issues approached were {{the application of the}} concepts of “active” and “passive” sales on the internet {{and the ways in which}} suppliers may restrict the online behaviour of their distributors within exclusive and selective distribution systems. The review of the old rules led to an intense debate between the promoters for selective distribution systems on one side and the so called pro-internet lobby on the other. The former argued for the importance of controlling the online behaviour of appointed distributors, while the latter held that all restrictions on online sales must be individually justified and not benefit from the Block Exemption. The final result appears to be a compromise and the Commission has more than anything tried to find ways of translating the rules on offline distribution to online sales, giving wide opportunities for distributors to operate online once they have a physical point of sales. The Commission has done quite well in its ambition to clarify the rules on internet distribution even if some uncertainties remain. Whilst continuing towards a more economic approach, it has been clearly influenced with the aim for market integration, which can be seen in the tough treatment of restraints hindering parallel trade and the protection of differential price settings on markets within the European Union...|$|E

40|$|The {{framework}} {{of this research}} is competition law and IPRs. Competition law regulation concerning Block Exemption concerning the Transfer of Technology (TTBER) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) Articles 101 and 102 mean that companies have to take into consideration certain regulation {{in order to avoid the}} intervention of competition authorities. As the system of TTBER is based on a self-announcement system, companies may take more or less risk in their agreement praxis. The research questions were: What are the preconditions for a competition according to the new Block <b>Exemption</b> <b>Regulation</b> concerning the Transfer of Technology (TTBER) ? This research question can be divided into the following sub-questions: 1) 	How small and medium size companies (SMEs) fulfill the criteria of permitted competition after the changes in Block <b>Exemption</b> <b>Regulation</b> concerning the Transfer of Technology? – how SMEs try to achieve market shares 2) 	How small and medium size companies fulfill the criteria of Block Exemption according the new regulation? These questions were scrutinized by litterature reviews, case analysis and updated materials from experts e. g. corporate lawyers and attorneys. The main results of the research were as follows: The doctrine of the misuse of a dominant position has often been a core issue in case law of European Court of Justice (ECJ) and especially the essential facilities problem. It has a chain effect to TTBER regulation. A dominant company can decide how to promote innovations. To identify the market shares it is important to find the relevant markets. The strength and knowledge of the licensee effects to the possibilities to succeed in license negotiations. A powerful company having the resources can take into account the TTBER regulation to favour its goals and take advantage of the economic condition. Often a high royalty is agreed in order to avoid claims. In R&D projects the amount of innovations is relevant in contract negotiations. In some cases companies have agreed of royalties in relation to the amount of the IPRs. SMEs grow into large companies and form joint ventures: it is not easy to evaluate how and when they fulfil the conditions of permitted competition. Technology pools are nowadays allowed, if they are not aiming to restrict competition and there are grounds for them, which are related to the technology.
