50|$|Amstrad {{launched}} the Amstrad DMP3000 printer, {{which was an}} 80 character dot matrix printer with both IBM and Epson compatibility and boasted NLQ (Near Letter Quality) and could handle both A4 and <b>fanfold</b> paper. It connected to the computer via a parallel port.|$|E
40|$|Preliminary design {{proposed}} for large, lightweight telescope shroud or light shield carried to orbit in single Space Shuttle cargo load. Shroud concept applied on Earth in portable, compactly storable displays or projection screens. Large telescope shroud includes four deployable masts erecting eight walls of hinged panels of polyimide film. Panels stored <b>fanfolded</b> before deployment and threaded on guide wires unwinding from spools and remain taut during deployment...|$|R

50|$|The 2922-2 Terminal Printer (RPQ 810564) was a repackaged 1403 printer. The printer used a {{print chain}} and {{provided}} a page width of 132 characters using <b>fanfold</b> paper. The controls and indicators for the printer were located on the front panel of the Terminal Control Unit, except for a duplicate start key on {{the rear of the}} printer.|$|E
50|$|On {{printers}} using <b>fanfold</b> {{continuous forms}} a leading banner page would often be printed twice, {{so that one}} copy would always be face-up when the jobs were separated. The page might include lines printed over the fold, which would be visible {{along the edge of}} a stack of printed output, allowing the operator to easily separate the jobs. Some systems would also print a banner page {{at the end of each}} job, assuring users that they had collected all of their printout.|$|E

A storage tray for eight <b>fanfold</b> paper tapes is attached to the top panel. At the left is the IBM Model B typewriter modified by Soroban, and the Type 30 CRT display is to the far right.|$|E
5000|$|Between C & D (1983-1990) was a Lower East Side {{quarterly}} {{literary magazine}} edited by Joel Rose and Catherine Texier. Though a geographical reference from New York City, Between C & D {{has also been}} suggested to mean [...] "between coke and dope", giving {{an indication of the}} transgressive content and ethos. Its actual tagline was [...] "Sex. Drugs. Danger. Violence. Computers.". The magazine was printed on <b>fanfold</b> computer paper, sold in a plastic bag and featured original artwork on each binding. [...] These limited run editions were collected by New York galleries and libraries and back issues sold on computer disk.|$|E
50|$|A {{label printer}} is a {{computer}} printer that prints on self-adhesive label material and/or card-stock (tags). A label printer with built-in keyboard and display for stand-alone use (not connected to a separate computer) is often called a label maker. Label printers are different from ordinary printers because {{they need to have}} special feed mechanisms to handle rolled stock, or tear sheet (<b>fanfold)</b> stock. Common connectivity for label printers include RS-232 serial, Universal Serial Bus (USB), parallel, Ethernet and various kinds of wireless. Label printers have a wide variety of applications, including supply chain management, retail price marking, packaging labels, blood and laboratory specimen marking, and fixed assets management.|$|E
5000|$|The three biggest {{problems}} with paper tape were: * Reliability. It was common practice to follow each mechanical copying of a tape with a manual hole-by-hole comparison.* Rewinding {{the tape was}} difficult and prone to problems. Great care was needed to avoid tearing the tape. Some systems used <b>fanfold</b> paper tape rather than rolled paper tape. In these systems, no rewinding was necessary nor were any fancy supply reel, takeup reel, or tension arm mechanisms required; the tape merely fed from the supply tank through the reader to the takeup tank, refolding itself back into exactly the same form as when it was fed into the reader.* Low information density. Datasets much larger than a few dozen kilobytes are impractical to handle in paper tape format.|$|E
50|$|Impact {{printers}} create noise {{when the}} pins or typeface strike the ribbon to the paper, and sound-damping enclosures {{may have to}} be used in quiet environments. They can only print lower-resolution graphics, with limited color performance, limited quality, and lower speeds compared to non-impact printers. While they support <b>fanfold</b> paper with tractor holes well, single-sheet paper {{may have to be}} wound in and aligned by hand, which is relatively time-consuming, or a sheet feeder may be utilized which can have a lower paper feed reliability. When printing labels on release paper, they are prone to paper jams when a print wire snags {{the leading edge of the}} label while printing at its very edge. For text-only labels (e.g. mailing labels), a daisy wheel printer or band printer may offer better print quality and a lower risk of damaging the paper.|$|E
5000|$|The {{machines}} {{have two}} printers which can print on, and encode the magnetic stripes {{on the rear}} of, Rail Settlement Plan-accredited ticket stock. [...] This has a batch code of RSP No. 9399 and consists of <b>fanfold</b> (concertina-style) packs of round-cornered tickets joined to each other by perforated lugs which are cut during the printing process. An experimental ticket stock with diagonal corners {{was used in the}} earliest trial machines. [...] In common with other [...] "New Generation" [...] (post-privatisation) ticket issuing systems, the ticket stock has no pre-printed data other than some conditions on the reverse; all data is printed by the machine. [...] Machines accept either payment cards only or both cards and cash. On the latter, banknotes and coins are checked electronically. [...] Keypads for Chip and PIN card payments were fitted retrospectively on older machines, and as standard on newer machines, when this technology was introduced.|$|E
50|$|The LA30 was {{followed}} in 1974 by the LA36, which achieved far greater commercial success, becoming {{for a time}} the standard dot matrix computer terminal. The LA36 used the same print head as the LA30 but could print on forms of any width up to 132 columns of mixed-case output on standard green bar <b>fanfold</b> paper. The carriage was moved by a much-more-capable servo drive using a DC electric motor and an optical encoder / tachometer. The paper was moved by a stepper motor. The LA36 was only available with a serial interface but unlike the earlier LA30, no fill characters were required. This was possible because, while the printer never communicated at faster than 30 characters per second, the mechanism was actually capable of printing at 60 characters per second. During the carriage return period, characters were buffered for subsequent printing at full speed during a catch-up period. The two-tone buzz produced by 60 character-per-second catch-up printing followed by 30 character-per-second ordinary printing was a distinctive feature of the LA36 quickly copied by many other manufacturers well into the 1990s. Most efficient dot matrix printers used this buffering technique.|$|E
5000|$|Multipart or {{multi-part}} stationery is {{paper that}} is blank, or preprinted {{as a form}} to be completed, comprising a stack of several copies, either on carbonless paper or plain paper interleaved with carbon paper. The stationery may be bound into books with tear-out sheets to be filled in manually, continuous stationery (<b>fanfold</b> sheet or roll) for use in suitable computer printers, or as individual stacks, usually crimped together. The purpose is to produce multiple simultaneous copies of a document produced by handwriting with a pen that applies pressure, such as a ballpoint pen, or with an impact printer. [...] The pressure of writing or impact printing on the carbon or carbonless paper transfers the content to the copy sheets. Depending upon requirements, up to typically four copies of the original can be made, with the quality and readability decreasing towards the bottom copies.This type of stationery can be used whenever multiple copies are required, of quality adequate for the purpose, usually noticeably inferior to, for example, laser-printed output. Typically a company may need a document such as an invoice to give to a customer (original), with a copy for their own accounting department (first copy), and possibly further copies for other purposes. The paper stock used is typically of low weight—thin—to transfer more printing pressure. The different copies can be on paper of different colour to distinguish them, and preprinted content may vary between copies.|$|E
