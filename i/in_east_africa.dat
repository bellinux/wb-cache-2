5|$|On 10 January, Seeadler {{departed}} for Bombay, where her boilers were repaired {{in a major}} overhaul. Workers from the Kaiserliche Werft in Kiel were sent to do the work. Seeadler was back in service by May, and on 18 May she departed Bombay, arriving <b>in</b> <b>East</b> <b>Africa</b> on 31 May. Cormoran was meanwhile detached from East Africa and allowed to continue to the Pacific. The {{rest of the year}} was uneventful for Seeadler, though she became briefly involved in political developments <b>in</b> <b>East</b> <b>Africa.</b> The British Jameson Raid into the Transvaal in December 1895 threatened some 15,000 German nationals in the Transvaal, along with the investment of 500million gold marks in the country. The German governor considered ordering Seeadler to contribute a landing force to protect the German consul in Pretoria, the capital of the Transvaal, but the defeat of the Jameson Raid rendered the plan redundant. Seeadler nevertheless remained <b>in</b> <b>East</b> <b>Africa</b> while tensions cooled. In mid-February 1896, she went to Cape Town for her yearly overhaul.|$|E

5|$|All six {{ships of}} the class spent the {{majority}} of their careers abroad, primarily in Germany's colonial possessions in Africa and the Pacific. Seeadler visited the United States in March 1893, along with the protected cruiser , for the belated celebrations for the 400th anniversary of Columbus's crossing of the Atlantic. In July of that year, while assigned to the East Asia Division, Bussard and Falke assisted in the suppression of Mata'afa Iosefo's revolt in Samoa, along with a British corvette. Throughout the 1890s, Seeadler was assigned to Germany's colonies <b>in</b> <b>East</b> <b>Africa</b> and Southwest Africa, where she suppressed local uprisings.|$|E
5|$|Compared to {{most other}} {{important}} crops, {{little is known}} about the domestication, dispersal and cultivation history of the cowpea. Although there is no archaeological evidence for early cowpea cultivation the centre of diversity of the cultivated cowpea is West Africa, leading an early consensus that this is the likely centre of origin and place of early domestication. New research using molecular markers has suggested that domestication may have instead occurred <b>in</b> <b>East</b> <b>Africa</b> and currently both theories carry equal weight.|$|E

5|$|Portugal {{was part}} of the Entente and a belligerent, {{employing}} troops in France and Africa; so a force under Major João Teixeira Pinto was sent to stop von Lettow-Vorbeck from crossing the border. The Portuguese were flanked by the Germans, while encamped at Ngomano on 25 November 1917. The battle saw the Portuguese force nearly destroyed, with many troops killed and captured. The capitulation of the Portuguese enabled the Germans to seize a large quantity of supplies and continue operations <b>in</b> <b>East</b> <b>Africa</b> {{until the end of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|San {{hunter and}} gatherers, {{ancestors}} of the Khoisani peoples, were the first known inhabitants of the region that is now Mozambique, followed in the 1st and 4th centuries by Bantu-speaking peoples who migrated there across the Zambezi River. In 1498, Portuguese explorers landed on the Mozambican coastline. Portugal's influence <b>in</b> <b>East</b> <b>Africa</b> grew throughout the 16th century; she established several colonies known collectively as Portuguese East Africa. Slavery and gold became profitable for the Europeans; influence was largely exercised through individual settlers {{and there was no}} centralised administration and, in the meantime, Portugal had turned her attention to India and Brazil.|$|E

5|$|The 1st Rhodesia Regiment {{was soon}} posted back to Cape Town, {{where many of}} the troopers voiced their dissatisfaction at the lack of {{fighting}} in South-West Africa, and requested discharge so they could join the war in Europe. Superiors assured the men that they would see action <b>in</b> <b>East</b> <b>Africa</b> if they stayed, but failed to convince most of them; the 1st Rhodesia Regiment promptly disbanded {{due to a lack of}} personnel. The majority of the South-West Africa veterans boarded ship for England to enlist in the British Army, while others mustered into South African units already billed for European service.|$|E
5|$|As Italy {{entered the}} war at the {{conclusion}} of the Battle of France, their Fascist dictator Benito Mussolini looked to Africa as a possible location for easy propaganda victories to justify his joining the conflict and to glorify Italy's hitherto speculative role it. The British Somaliland colony, a weakly defended area located in modern Somalia, looked to the dictator easy prey. Despite Italy being logistically unready for a conflict in that region, an attack on Somaliland was authorized, set for late 1940. Italian forces <b>in</b> <b>East</b> <b>Africa</b> were relatively strong in numbers, if not in quality, with 29 colonial brigades, each consisting of several infantry battalions and some light artillery, concentrated around the recently conquered Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa. The Italians also possessed at least 60 medium and light tanks and 183 aircraft, both fighters and medium/light bombers.|$|E
5|$|By late November 1917, the Germans <b>in</b> <b>East</b> <b>Africa</b> {{were left}} with few options {{if they wanted to}} {{continue}} the war. They were outnumbered drastically and were split up into several different columns. The two largest of these, under Theodor Tafel and Paul Emil von Lettow-Vorbeck, were completely cut off from each other. Although von Lettow-Vorbeck's column had defeated a large British force at the Battle of Mahiwa he had lost a large number of troops and expended virtually his entire supply of modern ammunition. With only antiquated weapons and no way of resupplying, von Lettow-Vorbeck decided to invade Portuguese East Africa in hopes of acquiring sufficient supplies to continue the war. There was no legal impediment to this attack; Germany had declared war on Portugal on 9 March 1916.|$|E
