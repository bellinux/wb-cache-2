50|$|The Initial <b>Approach</b> <b>Fix</b> (IAF) is {{the point}} where the initial {{approach}} segment of an instrument approach begins. An instrument approach procedure may have more than one Initial <b>approach</b> <b>fix</b> and initial <b>approach</b> segment. The initial <b>approach</b> <b>fix</b> is usually a designated intersection, VOR, NDB, or DME <b>fix.</b> The initial <b>approach</b> <b>fix</b> may be collocated with the intermediate fix (IF) of the instrument approach and in such case they designate the beginning of the intermediate segment of the approach. When initial <b>approach</b> <b>fix,</b> and <b>intermediate</b> fix are combined there is no initial approach segment.|$|R

Is it possible to formulate an <b>intermediate</b> <b>approach</b> for a foundational theory of cognition by defining a conception of representation that may bridge the fault line? Such an account of representation, {{as well as an}} account of correspondence semantics, is offered here. The account extends previously developed agent-based pragmatic theories of semantic information, where meaning of an information state is defined by its interface role, to a theory that accommodates a notion of representation and correspondence semantics. It is argued that the account can be used to develop an <b>intermediate</b> <b>approach</b> to cognition, by showing that the major sources of tension between “representational” and “non-representational” theories may be eased...|$|R

This paper presents an <b>intermediate</b> <b>approach</b> based on the emulation of IP routers and evaluates the concept.

30|$|At {{the end of}} this section, it is {{important}} to note the three unique features if the proposed <b>intermediate</b> <b>approach.</b> First, this study has discussed a new application of the approach. The research of Sueyoshi et al. (2017 b) has provided methodological contribution of the proposed approach by comparing among the <b>intermediate</b> <b>approach</b> and the other two (radial and non-radial) approaches. Second, the proposed approach has an analytical structure, similar to “Russell measure”, which methodologically locates between “Debreu–Koopmans efficiency” for radial measurement and “Pareto–Koopmans efficiency” for non-radial measurement in a conventional DEA framework. See Sueyoshi et al. (2017 b) for a detailed description on the differences. The difference between the proposed approach and the conventional Russell measure is that the proposed former approach for inefficiency identification can be solved by linear programming and the conventional latter, for efficiency identification, is solved by nonlinear programming. Such differences can increase the level of efficiency measurement by the <b>intermediate</b> <b>approach.</b> See the computational results summarized in Sueyoshi et al. (2017 b). A problem of their study is that it does not document any empirical results, just showing an illustrative example for methodical comparison. Such is our empirical contribution of this study. Finally, the <b>intermediate</b> <b>approach</b> incorporates independent efficiency scores for each desirable and undesirable output. The efficiency score can flexibly adjust actual amount of these outputs to shift to optimal ones by the scores. However, I may violate the “efficiency equipment,” indicating that an efficiency score should between zero and one. To avoid such a methodological difficulty, the proposed models still use slacks for those outputs. It is easily imagined that it is impossible for us to maintain a practical benefit of the usage without the efficiency equipment. In addition, the restrictions on efficiency scores, that constrain them to be less than or equal unity, are also for such a purpose on the efficiency equipment.|$|R
50|$|Conversely, if the length-scale {{decreases}} and {{the physical}} parameters <b>approach</b> <b>fixed</b> values, then we have ultraviolet fixed points. The fixed points are generally independent of the initial values of the parameters over a large range of the initial values. This is known as universality.|$|R

30|$|To {{measure the}} {{sustainability}} of Asia nations from 2008 to 2014, this study proposes a new use of a DEA <b>intermediate</b> <b>approach,</b> analytically locating between conventional (radial and non-radial) approaches. Using the new approach, this study is interested in measuring how to improve the level of sustainability in Asian from an efficient usage of their primary and secondary energies. That {{is the purpose of}} this research.|$|R
40|$|The {{article focuses}} on {{customary}} international law as form of international law of the U. S. and the analysis of intermediate positions and defend of modern positions.

Belia and Bradford Clark and was considered as not really intermediate but also a convincing one...|$|R
30|$|Apart from purely {{microscopic}} and mesoscopic <b>approaches,</b> <b>intermediate</b> <b>approaches</b> {{have recently}} been proposed in the literature in order {{to account for the}} interaction between transverse cracking and delamination. For example, in works such as [26, 27], classical cohesive interfaces are used for both transverse cracks and delaminations; in this case, however, a priori information about the cracking pattern (e.g. the position of the splits) needs to be introduced in order to carry out the simulations. Another approach consists in introducing discrete cracks thanks to techniques such as the X-FEM [28]; once again, the interaction between transverse cracks and delamination occurs naturally, but the local stress/strain field is still poorly represented compared to a purely microscopic approach, and a minimum crack spacing (which is generally much larger than in reality) related to the element size chosen needs to be introduced. These <b>intermediate</b> <b>approaches</b> are helpful for one’s understanding of the degradation mechanisms. Unfortunately, because of the approximations introduced in the physics and the a priori information which they require, they cannot be considered to be predictive models.|$|R

50|$|An <b>intermediate</b> <b>approach</b> is to {{incorporate}} high Vth sleep transistors into threshold gates having more complicated function. Since fewer such threshold gates {{are required to}} implement any arbitrary function compared to Boolean gates, incorporating MTCMOS into each gate requires less area overhead. Examples of threshold gates having more complicated function are found with Null Convention Logic and Sleep Convention Logic. Some art is required to implement MTCMOS without causing glitches or other problems.|$|R
40|$|Organic {{farming is}} {{increasingly}} recognised, by consumers, farmers, environmentalists and policy-makers, {{as one of}} a number of possible models for environmental, social and financial sustainability in agriculture. It has taken a long time to get this far. Organic farming’s roots can be traced back more than 100 years. Certified organic production dates back 25 - 30 years (70 years in the case of Demeter-certified bio-dynamic production). Yet little more than one percent of agriculture in Europe is organic, and much less than that in other parts of the world. Many have argued that organic farming will never capture the hearts and minds of the majority of farmers, because it is too idealistic and restrictive. What is needed, they argue, is an <b>intermediate</b> <b>approach,</b> such as integrated crop management or an ill-specified ‘low-input’ or ‘sustainable’ agriculture that is not as ‘extreme’ as organic farming and is therefore more likely to be acceptable to the majority of farmers. Policy-makers face a difficult choice. Should they encourage more organic farming, which, as research increasingly demonstrates, often offers more environmental and other benefits than the <b>intermediate</b> <b>approaches,</b> but is believed to be only a minority interest? Or should they encourage the <b>intermediate</b> <b>approaches,</b> which, although the environmental benefits are more limited, may be adopted by more farmers, with possibly greater overall impact? And if, contrary to expectations, organic farming did become widely adopted, how could we feed a growing global population? It is time to dispel the myths and challenge the assumptions behind some of these statements in order to permit a fairer assessment of the potential of organic farming to meet sustainability goals in a European context, while also contributing to the pressing need to feed a growing global population in the next century. This paper discuses the growth of organic farming in Europe, and the potential, pre-conditions and implications for widespread conversion...|$|R

A methodological contribution {{of this study is}} that it newly proposes an “intermediate approach” that analytically locates between the two categories. The <b>intermediate</b> <b>approach</b> was first proposed by Sueyoshi and Yuan (2017). See also Sueyoshi et al. (2017 b).|$|R
30|$|It {{is indeed}} true {{that this study}} is not perfect. Here, four issues need to be {{discussed}} here. First, the proposed <b>intermediate</b> <b>approach</b> needs to be explored a time horizon, which is not explored in this study. See Sueyoshi et al. (2017 a). Second, {{it is necessary for}} us to apply the <b>intermediate</b> <b>approach</b> to other industrial nations in Europe, the USA and Japan, not only Asia as explored in this research. Such tasks will be important future extensions of this study. Third, this study has used two inputs such electricity consumption and total primary energy consumption to compute our efficiency scores. Some portion of total primary energy consumption is used for electricity generation. See Sueyoshi and Goto (2018). A rationale on these usages is that they are important sources of desirable outputs such as GDP. See Sueyoshi and Goto (2018) for empirical evidence on the rationale. Finally, the nations analyzed in this study are considerably different in their industry structures. Under such variations, relationships between GDP and CO 2 emissions are influenced by the industry structures. This study has not incorporated these structural differences. The issue will be explored as a future research task.|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Several authors {{studied the}} problem of {{geometrical}} matching of fields produced by medical linear accelerators. However, a general solution {{has yet to be}} published. Currently available solutions are based on parallelism arguments. This study provides a general solution, considering not only parallelism but also field sizes. Methods: A fixed field with arbitrary field size, gantry, collimator, and couch angle is considered, and another field with a fixed gantry angle is matched to it. A single reference system attached to the treatment couch is used, and two approaches are followed. In the first <b>approach,</b> <b>fixed</b> field sizes are assumed and parallelism of the adjacent field-side planes is imposed. In the second <b>approach,</b> <b>fixed</b> isocenter positions are considered and both parallelism and coincidence between field-side planes are required. Results: When fixed field sizes are assumed, rotation angles are obtained; however, the isocenters may need to be shifted to make side planes coincident and therefore achieve a proper match. When fixed isocenter positions are considered, solutions for all parameters, including the field size, are obtained and an exact geometrical match is achieved. Conclusions: General expressions to the field-matching problem are found for the two <b>approaches</b> followed, <b>fixed</b> field sizes, and fixed isocenter positions. These results can be applied to any treatment technique and can easily be implemented in modern treatment planning systems. Postprint (published version...|$|R
