40|$|A {{model of}} human leucopenia has been {{developed}} further in the female mouse. Following daily administration to female mice of 50 mg/kg of the aromatase inhibitor aminoglutethimide, significant falls in platelet and white cell counts occurred after 2 and 3 weeks. At week 4, drug dosage was stopped and the cell counts recovered {{at the end of}} that week, although on rechallenge at the beginning of week 5, both platelet and white cell counts fell rapidly. Administration to the mice of structural analogues of aminoglutethimide, such as WSP- 3, glutethimide and 4 -nitroglutethimide, showed no reductions in platelet and white cell counts. The <b>haemotoxicity</b> of aminoglutethimide over 21 days was unaffected by the presence of either the P- 450 inhibitor SKF- 525 A or the hepatic P- 450 inducer phenobarbitone. However, the co-administration of cimetidine abolished the <b>haemotoxicity</b> of aminoglutethimide in terms of platelet and white cell levels. In in vitro studies, both aminoglutethimide and WSP- 3 were oxidised to cytotoxic species, although aminoglutethimide was significantly more cytotoxic than WSP- 3. The NADPH-dependent covalent binding of 14 C aminoglutethimide to mouse microsomes in vitro was significantly reduced by the presence of cimetidine. The activation of the compound to reactive species in vitro, the inhibitory effects of cimetidine in vivo and in vitro, as well as the rapid fall in the in vivo white cell count on rechallenge with aminoglutethimide suggest that this model illustrates a form of leucopenia which may be related to hapten formation and subsequent immune-mediated platelet and white cell lysis. © 2003 Elsevier B.

40|$|Azathioprine (AZA) is a {{cytotoxic}} {{immunosuppressive drug}} {{used in the}} prevention of rejection in organ transplants and the treatment of auto-immune diseases. However, AZA is haemotoxic causing significant bone marrow depression. The present studies were to characterize the <b>haemotoxicity</b> of AZA in the female CD- 1 mouse. In Experiment 1, a dose-ranging study, with AZA gavaged daily for 10 days, clinical evidence of toxicity was evident at 125 mg/kg and above. Experiment 2 was a dose–response study with AZA gavaged daily for 10 days at 40 – 120 mg/kg. At day 1 after the final dose, AZA induced a dose-related pancytopaenia, reduced femoral marrow cellularity, increases in serum levels of the cytokine fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand, reduction in granulocyte-monocyte colony-forming units and erythroid colonies, and increased bone marrow apoptosis. Histology demonstrated hepatocyte hypertrophy, thymic atrophy, reduced splenic extramedullary haemopoiesis, and reduced cellularity of sternal bone marrow. In Experiment 3, AZA was dosed for 10 days at 100 mg/kg with autopsies at 1, 3, 9, 22, 29, 43 and 57 days postdosing. At 1, 3 and 9 days, haematological parameters reflected changes in Experiment 2. At 22 / 29 days, many blood parameters were returning towards normal; at 43 / 57 days, most parameters compared with controls. However, there was some evidence of a persistent (i. e. residual/late-stage) mild reduction in RBC and erythroid progenitor cell counts at day 43 / 57. We conclude that the CD- 1 mouse provides an acceptable model for the <b>haemotoxicity</b> of AZA in man...|$|E
40|$|We have {{examined}} the ability of cimetidine to inhibit the oxidative metabolism and hence <b>haemotoxicity</b> of dapsone in vitro, using a two compartment system in which two Teflon chambers are separated by a semi-permeable membrane. Compartment A contained a drug metabolizing system (microsomes prepared from human or rat liver +/- NADPH), whilst compartment B contained human red cells. Preincubation (30 min) of human liver microsomes with cimetidine (0 - 1000 microM) and NADPH prior to the addition of dapsone (100 microM) and NADPH (1 mM) resulted in a concentration-dependent decrease in the concentrations of dapsone hydroxylamine (from 179 +/- 47 to 40 +/- 6 ng) in compartment B. This reduction of hydroxylamine metabolite {{was reflected in the}} concentration-dependent reduction in methaemoglobin measured (from 7. 1 +/- 0. 7 to 3. 5 +/- 1. 5 %) in parallel experiments. Preincubation of microsomes with cimetidine in the absence of NADPH had no effect. The effect of cimetidine pretreatment on dapsone-dependent methaemoglobin was confirmed using microsomes prepared from a further three sources of human liver, as well as from rat liver...|$|E
40|$|Case summary An 11 -year-old {{spayed female}} {{domestic}} shorthair cat {{with a history}} of hyperthyroidism treated with carbimazole for 7 months was presented for a check-up after a few episodes of vomiting. The cat had been receiving prednisolone at 0. 5 mg/kg PO q 12 h for recent pancreatitis and concurrent inflammation of liver and small intestines confirmed by biopsies. Clinical examination revealed pale mucous membranes with a capillary refill time of 120 s) and fibrinogen serum concentration (3. 5 g/l). Morphological changes of thrombocytes in the absence of thrombocytopenia were also noted. In-saline agglutination test was positive. Abdominal radiographic and ultrasonographic examinations excluded the presence of organ abnormalities and peritoneal effusion. Blood biochemistry was unremarkable. Feline leukaemia virus and feline immunodeficiency virus tests were negative. On the basis of these findings, immune-mediated anaemia secondary to chronic carbimazole administration was suspected. Prednisolone was increased to 2 mg/kg PO q 24 h and carbimazole tablets were stopped. Despite close monitoring and intensive care, the cat died the same evening of admission to the hospital. Relevance and novel information This report suggests that severe <b>haemotoxicity</b> may occur as a sequel of chronic carbimazole administration in cats. Routine bloodwork and accurate follow-up of cats under treatment with thyrotoxic therapy may be advisable, in order to detect haematological changes before lethal complications occur...|$|E
40|$|Chloramphenicol (CAP) is haemotoxic in man, {{inducing}} {{two types}} of toxicity. First, a dose-related, reversible anaemia with reticulocytopenia, sometimes seen in conjunction with leucopenia and thrombocytopenia; this form of toxicity develops during drug treatment. The second <b>haemotoxicity</b> is aplastic anaemia (AA) which {{is evident in the}} blood as severe pancytopenia. AA development is not dose-related and occurs weeks or months after treatment. We wish, in the longer term, to investigate CAP-induced AA in the busulphan-pretreated mouse. However, as a prelude to that study, we wanted to characterize in detail the reversible <b>haemotoxicity</b> of CAP succinate (CAPS), administered at high dose levels in the mouse, and follow the recovery of the bone marrow in the post-dosing period. Female B 6 C 3 F 1 mice were gavaged with CAPS at 0, 2500 and 3500 mg/kg, daily, for 5 days and sampled (n = 5) at 1, 7, 14 and 21 days post-dosing. Blood, bone marrow and spleen samples were analysed and clonogenic assays carried out. At day 1 post-dosing, at both CAPS dose levels, decreases were seen in erythrocytes and erythrocyte precursors; marrow erythroid cells were reduced. Reductions were also evident in splenic nucleated cell counts, blood high fluorescence ratio (HFR) reticulocyte counts and total reticulocyte counts; burst-forming units-erythroid and colony-forming units-erythroid showed decreases. At day 7 post-dosing (2500 mg/kg CAPS), there was regeneration of erythrocyte production, with marked splenic erythropoietic activity, and raised blood HFR reticulocytes. At day 7, at 3500 mg/kg CAPS, erythrocyte and reticulocyte parameters remained depressed. At 14 days post-dosing (2500 mg/kg CAPS), many erythrocyte parameters had returned to normal; at 3500 mg/kg CAPS, there was erythroid regeneration. By 21 days post-dosing, at both CAPS dose levels, most erythrocytic parameters were equivalent to control values. For leucocyte parameters, there was some depression at day 1 post-dosing (at both CAPS dose levels) and signs of recovery at day 7. At days 14 and 21 post-dosing, most leucocyte parameters were close to control values. Marrow smears at day 1 post-dosing (at both CAPS dose levels) showed vacuolation of early normoblasts, of myeloid and of monocytic precursors. We conclude that the administration of CAPS at 2500 and 3500 mg/kg for 5 days induced significant myelotoxicity in female B 6 C 3 F 1 mice, with cessation of erythropoiesis at day 1 post-dosing; recovery was seen over the following 7 / 14 days. The blood HFR reticulocyte count was a precise indicator of CAPS-induced depressive effects and subsequent recovery. It is concluded that the administration of five daily doses of CAPS at 2500 and 3500 mg/kg to the female B 6 C 3 F 1 mouse induces an anaemia with reticulocytopenia, in conjunction with leucopenia, in the immediate post-dosing period; no evidence was seen at 21 days post-dosing of peripheral blood pancytopenia or a hypocellular/acellular bone marrow, which are both characteristic features of AA in man...|$|E
40|$|This study characterises two {{recently}} developed anticancer agents in vitro and in vivo, 2 -methoxyoestra- 1, 3, 5 (10), 16 -tetraene- 3 -carboxamide (IRC- 110160) and STX 140. Materials and Methods: Hormone-dependent (MCF- 7), hormone-independent (MDA-MB- 231) and P-glycoprotein overexpressing (MCF- 7 (DOX)) cells {{were used for}} proliferation experiments. For the tumour efficacy studies, female nude mice were inoculated with MDA-MB- 231 cells. Results: IRC- 110160 is a potent inhibitor of both MCF- 7 and MDA-MB- 231 cell proliferation. Furthermore, the potency of IRC- 110160 was unaffected by the over-expression of the P-glycoprotein drug efflux pump. IRC- 110160 and 2 -methoxyoestradiol- 3, 17 -O,O-bis-sulfamate (STX 140) induced apoptosis in a similar timeframe in the MDA-MB- 231 cell line, but only STX 140 caused G 2 /M arrest in these cells. In the MDA-MB- 231 xenograft model 300 mg/kg p. o. (daily) of IRC- 110160 and 20 mg/kg p. o. STX 140 (daily) both completely inhibited tumour growth; however some toxicity was observed with IRC- 110160. After 28 days of daily dosing STX 140 (20 mg/kg p. o.) had minimal effect on the white blood population of mice with tumours. The masking of STX 140 from white blood cells {{may be due to}} its interaction with carbonic anhydrase II (CAII) in the red blood cells. In contrast to STX 140, IRC- 110160 does not inhibit CAII. These studies highlight the activity of two orally bioavailable anti-cancer agents one of which, STX 140, may offer a significant clinical advantage over existing drugs as a common dose limiting factor, <b>haemotoxicity,</b> may be minimised...|$|E
40|$|The tetrapeptide AcSDKP (Goralatide) is a {{cytokine}} {{with known}} inhibitory effects on cell proliferation, Many purging agents used in autologous {{bone marrow transplantation}} protocols, including hyperthermia, preferentially kill cycling cells. A pretreatment with Goralatide offers a possibility to reduce the <b>haemotoxicity</b> in many purging settings. The impact of Goralatide on the hyperthermic purging protocol was investigated in normal and myeloid leukaemic (SA 8) murine cells. The median survival time after transplantation (i. e. leukaemia incidences) {{was used as an}} in vivo parameter to determine the effects on leukaemic cells. The hyperthermic effect on normal and leukaemic cells was also investigated in vitro using the cobblestone area-forming cell (CAFC) assay. A heat treatment of 90 min at 43 degrees C resulted in a 4 -log depletion of leukaemic stem cells. For normal progenitor cells (CFU-GM) a 2 -log cell kill was shown. The reduction in proliferative activity of the CFU-GM after an 8 h incubation with 10 (- 9) M Goralatide resulted in a decrease in the heat sensitivity of the progenitor subset to approximately a 1 -log cell kill, The leukaemic precursor cells seem insensitive to Goralatide inhibition, implicating an increase in the therapeutic window of the hyperthermic purging protocol. Finally, simulated remission bone marrow (5 % leukaemic blasts) was incubated with Goralatide followed by a heat treatment of 90 min at 43 degrees C. Lethally irradiated (10 Gy) mice transplanted with heat-treated remission bone marrow (10 (6) normal bone marrow cells versus 5 x 10 (4) leukaemic cells) died of aplasia while Goralatide-pretreated remission bone marrow could rescue the irradiated mice without revealing leukaemic engraftment, These findings confirmed the enhanced protection against hyperthermia of the normal haemopoietic subsets by Goralatide and thus increased the success of the hyperthermic purging protocol...|$|E
40|$|In man, {{chloramphenicol}} (CAP), induces {{two major}} haemotoxic effects. First, a reversible, dose-related reticulocytopenia and anaemia developing during treatment. Second, a non-dose-related aplastic anaemia (AA), developing weeks after treatment, is often irreversible and fatal. In previous studies, {{we developed a}} mouse model of the reversible reticulocytopenia/anaemia using CAP succinate (CAPS); attempts to induce AA in the mouse with CAPS were unsuccessful; in the rat, CAPS induced only minimal <b>haemotoxicity.</b> We therefore wished to investigate haematological changes caused by CAPS in a third rodent, particularly {{in relation to the}} induction of significant ‘late stage’ bone marrow depression (AA). Female guinea pigs were gavaged with CAPS in three experiments. In a dose ranging study, CAPS (at 2500 and 3500 mg/kg) was administered daily for 9 days, and blood examined at 1 day post dosing. CAPS induced increased erythrocyte values (an apparent haemoconcentration effect), and reduced reticulocytes and femoral marrow nucleated cell counts (FNCC). In a second experiment, CAPS was given at 333, 666 and 1000 mg/kg (13 days); haematological changes were compared with results from the initial study, with evidence of dose-related effects. In a final experiment, CAPS was administered (825 mg/kg, 16 days) and blood studied at 1, 12, 28 and 63 days post dosing. At day 1, erythrocyte values were decreased (NS), and reticulocytes and FNCC were reduced; the marrow was hypocellular with erythroid depletion. At 12 and 28 days, values returned towards the normal range. At 63 days, parameters were normal. Thus, CAPS (825 mg/kg for 16 days) induced changes comparable to the reversible bone marrow depression seen in man; but {{there was no evidence of}} ‘late stage’ (i. e. at 63 days) marrow depression, as would be seen in a developing or overt marrow aplasia (AA). The guinea pig (like the mouse) is a model for the early events, but is not a good model for CAP-induced AA in man...|$|E
