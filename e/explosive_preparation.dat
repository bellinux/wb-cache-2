40|$|A {{large scale}} {{experimental}} {{approach to the}} direct measurement of the spatial and temporal variation in loading resulting from an explosive event has been developed. The approach utilises a fixed target plate through which Hopkinson pressure bars are inserted. This technique allows the pressure-time histories for an array of bars to be generated, giving data over a large area of interest. A numerical interpolation technique has also been developed {{to allow for the}} full pressure-time history for any point on the target plate to be estimated and hence total imparted impulse to be calculated. The principles underlying the design of the experimental equipment are discussed, along with the importance of carefully controlling the <b>explosive</b> <b>preparation,</b> and the method and location of the detonation initiation. Initial results showing the key features of the loading recorded and the consistency attainable by this method are presented along with the data interpolation routines used to estimate the loading on the entire face...|$|E

5000|$|According to David Satter, {{there are}} some {{difficulties}} with the Khattab/Chechen theory. All four bombings that occurred had a similar [...] "signature" [...] which indicated that the explosives had been carefully prepared, a mark of skilled specialists. There is also no explanation {{as to how the}} terrorists were able to obtain tons of hexogen explosive and transport it to various locations in Russia; hexogen is produced in one plant in Perm oblast for which the central FSB is responsible for the security. The culprits would also have needed to organise nine explosions (the four that occurred and the five attempted bombings reported by the authorities) in different cities in a two-week period. Satter’s estimate for the time required for target plan development, site visits, <b>explosives</b> <b>preparation,</b> renting space at the sites and transporting explosives to the sites was four to four and a half months. If Satter is correct, the preparations for these acts of revenge would have needed to be initiated long before the act for which they were revenge for, had occurred! ...|$|R
40|$|In the {{disposal}} of <b>explosives,</b> <b>preparation</b> of the dismanted material is necessary before subjecting it to a breakdown process. Knowledge of the material properties and determination of safety-related parameters are major prerequirements when designing a disposal facility and increasing handling safety. When TNT is treated using emulsion processing, a desensitization of the TNT melt via the aqueous phase is obtained, in addition to increasing the surface area of the TNT phase. During the entire process of TNT treatment, the system is exposed {{to a wide range}} of different stresses as a result of the mechanical energy applied. This study presents the relults of an investigation on the sensitivity of pure TNT melts and TNT/water emulsions at different concentrations on exposure to the applied impact or shock energies. It is found that the impact sensitivity of a TNT/water emulsion is lower by a factor of 4 when the TNT concentration has been reduced from 50 wt % to 30 wt %. On exposure to s tress from a detonation shock wave, a desensitization of the system due to the aqueous phase is also found, so that the safety of the TNT treatment process can be increased by using a TNT/water emulsion when applying mechanical breakdown methods...|$|R

60|$|The French Three Days {{breaking}} out had armed the Guerrillero Mina, armed {{all manner of}} democratic guerrieros and guerrilleros; and considerable clouds of Invasion, from Spanish exiles, hung minatory over the North and North-East of Spain, supported by the new-born French Democracy, so far as privately possible. These Torrijos had to look upon with inexpressible feelings, and take no hand in supporting from the South; these also he had to see brushed away, successively abolished by official generalship; and to sit within his lines, in the painfulest manner, unable to do anything. The fated, gallant-minded, but too headlong man. At length the British Governor himself was obliged, in official decency and as is thought on repeated remonstrance from his Spanish official neighbors, to signify how indecorous, improper and impossible it was to harbor within one's lines such <b>explosive</b> <b>preparations,</b> once they were discovered, against allies in full peace with us,--the necessity, in fact, there was for the matter ending. It is said, he offered Torrijos and his people passports, and British protection, to any country of the world except Spain: Torrijos did not accept the passports; spoke of going peaceably to this place or to that; promised at least, what he saw and felt to be clearly necessary, that he would soon leave Gibraltar. And he did soon leave it; he and his, Boyd alone of the Englishmen being now with him.|$|R

40|$|The {{conventional}} {{approach to}} developing energetic molecules is to chemically place {{one or more}} nitro groups onto a carbon skeleton, {{which is why the}} term ''nitration'' is synonymous to <b>explosives</b> <b>preparation.</b> The nitro group carries the oxygen that reacts with the skeletal carbon and hydrogen fuels, which in turn produces the heat and gaseous reaction products necessary for driving an explosive shock. These nitro-containing energetic molecules typically have heats of formation near zero and therefore most of the released energy is derived from the combustion process. Our investigation of the tetrazine, furazan and tetrazole ring systems has offered a different approach to explosives development, where a significant amount of the chemical potential energy is derived from their large positive heats of formation. Because these compounds often contain a large percentage of nitrogen atoms, they are usually regarded as high-nitrogen fuels or explosives. A general artifact of these high-nitrogen compounds is that they are less sensitive to initiation (e. g. by impact) when compared to traditional nitro-containing explosives of similar performances. Using the precursor, 3, 6 -bis-(3, 5 -dimethylpyrazol- 1 -yl) -s-tetrazine, several useful energetic compounds based on the s-tetrazine system have been synthesized and studied. Some of the first compounds are 3, 6 -diamino-s-tetrazine- 1, 4 -dioxide (LAX- 112) and 3, 6 -dihydrazino-s-tetrazine (DHT). LAX- 112 was once extensively studied as an insensitive explosive by Los Alamos; DHT {{is an example of a}} high-nitrogen explosive that relies entirely on its heat of formation for sustaining a detonation. Recent synthesis efforts have yielded an azo-s-tetrazine, 3, 3 '-azobis(6 -amino-s-tetrazine) or DAAT, which has a very high positive heat of formation. The compounds, 4, 4 '-diamino- 3, 3 '-azoxyfurazan (DAAF) and 4, 4 '-diamino- 3, 3 '-azofurazan (DAAzF), may have important future roles in insensitive explosive applications. Neither DAAF nor DAAzF can be initiated by laboratory impact drop tests, yet both have in some aspects better explosive performances than 1, 3, 5 -triamino- 2, 4, 6 -trinitrobenzene TATB [...] the standard of insensitive high explosives. The thermal stability of DAAzF is equal to that of hexanitrostilbene (HNS), yet it too is a better explosive performer. The recently discovered tetrazol derivative, 3, 6 -bis-(1 H- 1, 2, 3, 4 -tetrazol- 5 -ylamino) -s-tetrazine (BTATz) was measured to have exceptional positive heats of formation and to be insensitive to explosive initiation. Because of its high burn rate with low sensitivity to pressure, this material is of great interest to the propellant community...|$|R
40|$|For years, DRDC Valcartier has {{invested}} efforts at developing energetic thermoplastic elastomers (ETPEs) based on linear glycidyl azide polymers {{to serve as}} energetic binders and replacing the thermoset matrix in insensitive explosives. It was first observed that introducing ETPEs in their melted form {{was not an easy}} task because high and nonpractical viscosities were encountered in the process. It was discovered that 2, 4, 6 -trinitrotoluene (TNT) could be used in its melted form as an organic solvent to dissolve the ETPE and allow its incorporation into the insensitive formulations. Using these ETPEs {{led to the development of}} a greener insensitive melt-cast explosive named green insensitive munitions (GIM). This new explosive was intensely studied. The mechanical properties and proportions of ETPE in the formulations were optimized to obtain a melt cast with low viscosity while leading to an insensitive explosive formulation. Work was conducted on GIM explosives to test their performance and sensitivity, fate and behavior with regard to the environment, their recycling capability, and toxicity. This paper describes the results of all experiments conducted so far to test these aspects of GIM <b>explosives.</b> The <b>preparation</b> of the ETPEs and the GIM explosives will also be briefly described.

40|$|International audienceAlthough all {{countries}} are intensifying their efforts against terrorism and increasing their mutual cooperation, terrorist bombing {{is still one}} of the greatest threats to society. The discovery of hidden bomb factories is of primary importance in the prevention of terrorism activities. Criminals preparing improvised explosives (IE) use chemical substances called precursors. These compounds are released in the air and in the waste water during IE production. Tracking sources of precursors by analyzing air or wastewater can then be an important clue for bomb factories’ localization. We are reporting here a new multiplex electrochemical sensor dedicated to the on-site simultaneous detection of three explosive precursors, potentially used for improvised <b>explosive</b> device <b>preparation</b> (hereafter referenced as B 01, B 08, and B 15, for security disclosure reasons and to avoid being detrimental to the security of the counter-explosive EU action). The electrochemical sensors were designed to be disposable and to combine ease of use and portability in a screen-printed eight-electrochemical cell array format. The working electrodes were modified with different electrodeposited metals: gold, palladium, and platinum. These different coatings giving selectivity to the multi-sensor through a “fingerprint”-like signal subsequently analyzed using partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA). Results are given regarding the detection of the three compounds in a real environment and in the presence of potentially interfering species...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the projects described in the following chapters {{is the development of}} new multiplexed and miniature rectilinear ion trap mass spectrometers. The first project, described in chapter 2, is the development of an ESI mass spectrometer coupled with an atmosphere interface and using RIT as the analyzer. The development object is to demonstrate the possibility of using a RIT for the analysis of biological compounds, and furthermore to prove the concept of using RITs in the multiplexed instrument with an atmospheric pressure interface. ^ Design, characterization and applications of a novel multiplexed, four channel mass spectrometer using RIT mass analyzer is described in chapter 3. This instrument is the first example of a fully multiplexed, four channel mass spectrometer with atmospeheric pressure interface with all the four channels operating simultaneously. This instrument increases the versatility of multiplexed instruments by adding the capability of detecting positive as well as negative polarity ions generated by ESI and atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) sources simultaneouosly. ^ It is desirable to develop techniques to analyze involatile and thermally unstable compounds from large surface area with rapid response time, preferably without special sample <b>preparation.</b> <b>Explosives</b> present special problems for MS due to their great range of volatilities while their occurrence on surfaces makes their direct ionization difficult by traditional methods. The high electron affinities associated with the nitro or nitrate functional groups present in the overwhelming majority of explosives in common use mean that they readily form negative ions by electron capture. Therefore a mass spectrometer capable of detecting the negative ion species feature lower limits of detection and a greater range of analysis than if it were only capable of detecting positively charge explosive ions. Chapter 4 describes development of a miniature mass spectrometer with negative ion detection capability which can analyze explosives directly from surfaces without any specialized sample preparation. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{low cost}} Cook-Off {{experimental}} facility {{has been established}} to provide a convenient method of ranking explosives in their response to Cook-Off by the time to event under two widely different heating rates and at two different scales. This thesis describes the literature review undertaken as preparation for the purposed study and all the experimental work developed comprising {{the design of the}} trials vehicles, the demonstration of their suitability for Fast and Slow Cook-Off trials with confined <b>explosive</b> systems, the <b>preparation</b> of the samples and test vehicles to be trialled as well as the set-up of adequate facilities to undertake the scheduled firing programme. Results are reported for Cook-Off tests on TNT, RDX, and their mixtures. The emphasis of the study is on time to event, and temperature at event, and in addition a qualitative assessment of the violence of the event was made by examination of the fragments of the vehicles, although it is accepted that the relatively light and low cost design of the vehicle may lead to variable confinement {{in the early stages of}} the explosive event, and hence to a wider spread of responses than would be obtained from a more heavily confined and more costly vehicle. The test vehicles give results, which differentiate between the various explosives and explosive mixtures trialled and between the scales. More experiments are required to establish the reproducibility of the measurements. The design of the equipment makes this a relatively inexpensive undertaking. The experiment was modelled using published kinetic data, but the calculated time to event differed from that observed to different extents at the two scales. It is hypothesised that the mechanism may change over the prolonged heat soaks and that quantitative scaling is not possible with the available information. Further work is also suggested using a different type of Cook-Off test vehicle, which will in our opinion reduce even further the cost of Cook-Off testing, due to reduction in man-hours of preparation involved and manufacture cost of the Cook-Off test vehicles, and consequently of ranking of explosives...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this interim {{planning}} guidance is to provide valuable information and insight to help public policy and health system leaders at all levels prepare for and respond to a mass casualty event (MCE) caused by terrorist use of <b>explosives</b> (TUE).
