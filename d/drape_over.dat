5|$|In late December 2014, NASA's MAVEN {{spacecraft}} detected {{evidence of}} widespread auroras in Mars's northern hemisphere and descended to approximately 20–30 degrees North latitude of Mars's equator. The particles causing the aurora penetrated into the Martian atmosphere, creating auroras below 100km above the surface, Earth's auroras range from 100km to 500km above the surface. Magnetic {{fields in the}} solar wind <b>drape</b> <b>over</b> Mars, into the atmosphere, and the charged particles follow the solar wind magnetic field lines into the atmosphere, causing auroras to occur outside the magnetic umbrellas.|$|E

2500|$|Aside {{from his}} {{contributions}} to the Michigan hockey program, Renfrew and his wife Marguerite are credited in some accounts as the individuals responsible for the football tradition of the [...] "M" [...] Club banner at Michigan Stadium. The tradition started in 1962 with Michigan players racing {{out of the tunnel}} and leaping into the air to touch the [...] "Go Blue: M Club Supports You" [...] banner while the Marching Band plays [...] "The Victors." [...] Renfrew reportedly asked his wife to make two flags to <b>drape</b> <b>over</b> the football lockerrooms to cheer on the team. [...] She made two flags, with a neighbor, and the Block M was designed by Bob Hoisington, an Engineering Dean, {{to make sure it was}} correct. They handmade the flags, which was not an easy feat at the time. Originally, the M Club members hung the banners the lockerroom, and the banners were later moved to the tunnel and then the stadium. After the games, the flags came back home to the Renfrews' home and were hung at their house. Later, the flags were changed to a banner.|$|E

50|$|Similarly, sediments may <b>drape</b> <b>over</b> a {{pre-existing}} inclined surface: these sediments {{are usually}} deposited conformably to the pre-existing surface. Also sedimentary beds may pinch out along strike, implying that slight angles existed during their deposition.

5000|$|A {{pelerine}} (from French [...] "pèlerine" [...] (pilgrim), is a cape-collar {{covering the}} shoulders.

The shoulder shaping allows these shawls to <b>drape</b> <b>over</b> the shoulders and remain in place as the wearer moves, even if the shawl is not pinned in place.|$|E

50|$|Kusari {{was used}} in samurai armour {{at least from the}} time of the Mongol {{invasion}} (1270s) but particularly from the Nambokucho period (1336-1392).

The rings of Japanese mail were much smaller than their European counterparts; they would be used in patches to link together plates and to <b>drape</b> <b>over</b> vulnerable areas such as the armpits.|$|E

50|$|While Western protesters wear differing {{styles and}} shades of keffiyeh, the most {{prominent}} is the black-and-white keffiyeh.

Other popular styles include rectangular-shaped scarves with the basic black-and-white pattern in the body, with the ends knitted {{in the form of}} the Palestinian flag.
