40|$|SummaryRefinement of {{the neural}} circuit during brain {{maturation}} is regulated by experience-driven neural activity. In the mammalian visual cortex, monocular visual deprivation (MD) {{in the early}} postnatal life causes a significant loss of cortical responses to a deprived eye and the retraction of <b>input</b> <b>axons</b> serving the deprived eye [1 – 3]. A competitive interaction between inputs serving both eyes has been supposed to underlie the effects of MD because the loss of cortical response is much weaker when both eyes are deprived of vision [4]. Also, the <b>input</b> <b>axons</b> do not retract after binocular deprivation [5]. Here, we report that uncorrelated activity between presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons can solely lead to the retraction of geniculocortical axons {{in the absence of}} activity imbalance between two inputs. We analyzed the morphology of geniculocortical axons in a pharmacologically inhibited visual cortex of animals with normal vision and of binocularly deprived animals. In the normal vision animals, the axonal arbors in the inhibited cortex showed robust retraction. On the other hand, the arbors in binocularly deprived animals remained mostly intact.

40|$|A key {{step toward}} {{understanding}} {{the function of}} a brain circuit is to find its wiring diagram. New methods for optical stimulation and optical recording of neurons {{make it possible to}} map circuit connectivity on a very large scale. However, single synapses produce small responses that are difficult to measure on a large scale. Here I analyze how single synaptic responses may be detectable using relatively coarse readouts such as optical recording of somatic calcium. I model a network consisting of 10, 000 <b>input</b> <b>axons</b> and 100 CA 1 pyramidal neurons, each represented using 19 compartments with voltage-gated channels and calcium dynamics. As single synaptic inputs cannot produce a measurable somatic calcium response, I stimulate many inputs as a baseline to elicit somatic action potentials leading to a strong calcium signal. I compare statistics of responses with or without a single axonal input riding on this baseline. Through simulations I show that a single additional input shifts the distribution of the number of output action potentials. Stochastic resonance due to probabilistic synaptic release makes this shift easier to detect. With ∼ 80 stimulus repetitions this approach can resolve up to 35 % of individual activated synapses even in the presence of 20 % recording noise. While the technique is applicable using conventional electrical stimulation and extracellular recording, optical methods promise much greater scaling, since the number of synapses scales as the product of the number of inputs and outputs. I extrapolate from current high-speed optical stimulation and recording methods, and show that this approach may scale up to the order of a million synapses in a single two-hour slice-recording experiment...|$|R

In both double- and triple-knockouts OP proliferation and number were unchanged but ~ 25 % fewer oligodendrocytes survived in the subcortical white matter during development. In triple knockouts, this shortfall persisted into adulthood. The oligodendrocyte deficit resulted in ~ 20 % fewer myelin sheaths but the average length, number and thickness of myelin internodes made by individual oligodendrocytes appeared normal.

40|$|Abstract only availableIn vertebrates, command {{systems in}} the brain {{activate}} central pattern generators (CPGs) in the spinal cord to generate the basic pattern of locomotor activity, such as swimming or walking. Reticulospinal (RS) neurons in reticular nuclei are the neural output elements of the command system that activate the spinal CPGs. In the lamprey, a lower vertebrate, several brain areas {{are part of the}} locomotor command system: rostrolateral rhombencephalon (RLR); dorsolateral mesencephalon (DLM); ventromedial diencephalon (VMD); and reticular nuclei. Neurons in the RLR project to the DLM and VMD, which then activate RS neurons (Paggett et al., 2004). Also, RS neurons receive inputs from second order sensory neurons in the lateral rhombencephalon as well as ascending inputs from spinal neurons. The purpose of the current project is to provide anatomical evidence for the above proposed pathways in the locomotor command system and potentially to identify new brain command areas that were previously unrecognized. Biocytin was applied to reticular nuclei using several methods so that the tracer would be picked up by <b>input</b> <b>axons</b> and retrogradely transported to the cell bodies of neurons with inputs to RS neurons. Biocytin was applied via pressure ejection both with and without NMDA (N-methyl D-aspartate), as well as via direct application of crystalline biocytin. These procedures resulted in labeling of neurons in several areas of the brain. First, neurons were labeled in the lateral rhombencephalon, and these cells probably correspond to second order trigeminal sensory neurons. Second, occasionally some neurons were labeled in the spinal cord. Third, neurons were labeled in the mesencephalon and diencephalon, {{in the vicinity of the}} DLM and VMD, respectively. Further research is needed to determine the functional identity of the labeled neurons in the mesencephalon and diencephalon. The DLM and VMD will be stimulated to initiate coordinated swimming activity, and these stimulation sites will be marked with Alcian Blue. Subsequently, biocytin will be applied to reticular nuclei to determine if retrogradely labeled neurons are within the DLM and VMD sites. A better understanding of the brain locomotor command system in the lamprey may provide insights into the organization and operation of similar brain systems in higher vertebrates, including humans.

Although severing one optic nerve at birth abolished the subsequent appearance of the direct pupillary light response on that side, ciliary ganglion cells of normal neonatal rabbits are driven synaptically in the absence of direct retinal illumination when tested in vivo. This tonic activity persisted for at least 3 months after interruption of the optic nerve at birth. Thus neonatal optic nerve section reduced, but did not eliminate, synaptic activation of ciliary ganglion cells. Optic nerve section at birth delayed the elimination of synaptic connexions in the ipsilateral but not the contralateral ciliary ganglion. Through the first 4 post-natal weeks ciliary ganglion cells on the operated side had, on average, more than the normal number of <b>inputs</b> from preganglionic <b>axons.</b> By 8 weeks of age, however, the normal number of connexions was established in spite of the unilateral visual deprivation. The elimination of connexions in ganglia on the unoperated side followed a normal time course.

Overexpression of NESH reduced numbers of mushroom-type spines and synapse density but increased thin, filopodia-like spines and had no effect on spine density. siRNA knockdown of NESH also reduced mushroom spine numbers and inhibited synapse formation but it increased spine density. The N-terminal region of NESH co-sedimented with filamentous actin (F-actin), which is an essential component of dendritic spines, suggesting this interaction is important for the maturation of dendritic spines.

Glycine currents recorded from isolated axon terminals were larger than those from isolated somata/dendrites; this was confirmed by puffing glycine onto these two regions in retinal slices. The current density at terminal endings {{was more than one}} order of magnitude higher than the density at somatic/dendritic regions. Glycine currents from isolated terminals and isolated somata/dendrites showed similar sensitivity to picrotoxinin blockade. Single-channel opening recorded from isolated terminals and somata/dendrites displayed a similar main-state conductance of ≈ 46 pS. Application of glycine effectively suppressed depolarization-evoked increases in intracellular Ca 2 + at the terminals. In the presence of GABAA and GABAC antagonists, strychnine-sensitive chloride currents were evoked in RBCs in retinal slices by puffing kainate onto the inner plexiform layer. No such currents were observed if the recorded RBCs did not retain axon terminals or if Ca 2 + was replaced by Co 2 + in the extracellular solution. The currents displayed discrete miniature-like events, which were partially blocked by tetrodotoxin. Consistent with early studies in the rabbit and mouse, this study demonstrates that glycine receptors are highly concentrated at the axon terminals of rat RBCs. The pharmacological and physiological properties of glycine receptors located in the axon terminal and somatic/dendritic regions, however, appear to be the same. This study provides evidence for the existence of functional glycinergic synaptic <b>input</b> at the <b>axon</b> terminals of RBCs, suggesting that glycine receptors {{may play a role in}} modulating bipolar cell synaptic transmission...|$|R

We examined the electron microscopic localization of COX- 2 and neur-onal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), a functionally related enzyme, in the somatosensory cortex of rat brain to determine the relevant functional sites. COX- 2 immunoreactivity was detected in signifi-cantly more somatodendritic than axonal profiles, while nNOS was more often seen in axon terminals. The dendritic COX- 2 was localized to endomembranes near synaptic <b>inputs</b> from <b>axon</b> terminals, some of which contained nNOS. Conversely, COX- 2 terminals formed asym-metric, excitatory-type synapses with dendrites containing nNOS. The dendritic and axonal profiles containing COX- 2 {{as well as those}} containing nNOS were minimally separated from penetrating arterio-les and capillaries by filamentous glial processes. The perivascular COX- 2 labeled terminals were among those that also formed axo-dendritic synapses, suggesting that the release of prostanoids and/or excitatory transmitters from a single terminal may simultaneously affect neuronal activity and cerebral blood flow. Thus, COX- 2 has a compartmental distribution in somatosensory cortical neurons consistent with the local neuronal synthesis of prostanoids that are involved in neurovascular coupling andwhose actions are modulated by nitric oxide...|$|R

40|$|During {{mammalian}} development, neuromuscular junctions {{and some}} other postsynaptic cells transition from multiple- to single-innervation as synaptic sites are exchanged between different axons. It is unclear whether one axon invades synaptic sites to drive off other <b>inputs</b> or alternatively <b>axons</b> expand their territory in response to sites vacated by other axons. Here we show that soon-to-be-eliminated axons rapidly reverse fate and grow to occupy vacant sites at a neuromuscular junction after laser removal of a stronger input. This reversal supports the idea that axons take over sites that were previously vacated. Indeed, during normal development we observed withdrawal followed by takeover. The stimulus for axon growth is not postsynaptic cell inactivity because axons grow into unoccupied sites even when target cells are functionally innervated. These results demonstrate competition at the synaptic level and enable us to provide a conceptual framework for understanding this form of synaptic plasticity...|$|R

The A 17 uses specialized morphological features, biophysical properties, and synaptic mechanisms to isolate feedback microcircuits and maximize its capacity to handle many independent processes.

40|$|The {{visual system}} {{is one of}} the most widely used and best {{understood}} sensory systems and the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) of the mouse has emerged as a model for investigating the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the development and activity-dependent refinement of sensory connections. Thalamic organization is highly conserved throughout species and the dLGN of the mouse possesses many features common to higher mammals, such as carnivores and primates. Two general classes of neuron are present within the dLGN, thalamocortical relay cells and interneurons, both of which receive direct retinal <b>input.</b> <b>Axons</b> of relay cells exit dLGN and convey visual information to layer IV of cortex, whereas interneurons are involved in local circuitry. In addition, dLGN receives rich nonretinal input from numerous areas of the brain. Studies thus far have focused on the retinogeniculate pathway and the development of connections between retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and relay cells has been well characterized. However, there are still a number of unanswered questions about circuit development in dLGN. Here we examined two aspects that are not well understood, the pattern of retinal convergence onto interneurons and the structural and functional innervation of nonretinal projections. To address the first issue we conducted in vitro whole-cell recordings from acute thalamic slices of GAD 67 -GFP mice, a transgenic strain in which dLGN interneurons express GFP. We also did 3 -D reconstructions of biocytin-labeled interneurons using multi-photon laser scanning microscopy in conjunction with anterograde labeling of retinogeniculate projections to examine the distribution of retinal contacts. To begin to examine the development of nonretinal connections in dLGN we made use of a transgenic mouse (golli-τ-GFP) to visualize corticogeniculate projections, one of the largest sources of nonretinal input to dLGN. Using this mouse we studied the timing and patterning of corticogeniculate innervation in relation to the development of the retinogeniculate pathway. We also used binocular enucleation and genetic deafferentation to test whether the retina plays a role in regulating nonretinal innervation. We found that there is a coordination of retinal and nonretinal innervation in dLGN. Projections from the retina were the first to innervate and they entered dLGN at perinatal ages. They also made functional connections with both relay cells and interneurons at early postnatal ages. Interestingly, relay cells underwent a period of retinogeniculate refinement, whereas the degree of retinal convergence onto interneurons was maintained. This possibly reflects the different roles that these two cell types have in dLGN. Both structural and functional corticogeniculate innervation was delayed in comparison and occurred postnatally, however in the absence of retinal input the timing of corticogeniculate innervation was accelerated. RGCs transmit the visual information encoded in the retina to dLGN so it may be necessary for these connections to be formed before those from nonretinal projections, which serve to modulate that signal on its way to cortex. Thus precise timing of retinal and nonretinal innervation may be important for the appropriate formation of connections in the visual system and the retina seems to be playing an important role in regulating this timing...|$|R

The GP is composed of a network of inhibitory GABA-containing projection neurons which receive GABAergic <b>input</b> from <b>axons</b> of the striatum (Str) and local collaterals of GP neurons. Here, using electrophysiological techniques and immunofluorescent labeling we have investigated the differential cellular distribution of a 1, a 2 and a 3 GABAA receptor subunits in relation to striatopallidal (Str-GP) and pallidopallidal (GP-GP) synapses. Electrophysiological investigations showed that zolpidem (100 nm; selective for the a 1 subunit) increased the amplitude and the decay time of both Str-GP and GP-GP IPSCs, indicating the presence of the a 1 subunits at both synapses. However, the application of drugs selective for the a 2, a 3 and a 5 subunits (zolpidem at 400 nm, L- 838, 417 and TP 003) revealed differential effects on amplitude and decay time of IPSCs, suggesting the nonuniform distribution of non-a 1 subunits. Immunofluorescence revealed widespread distribution of the a 1 subunit at both soma and dendrites, while double- and triple-immunofluorescent labeling for parvalbumin, enkephalin, gephyrin and the ? 2 subunit indicated strong immunoreactivity for GABAAa 3 subunits in perisomatic synapses, a region mainly targeted by local axon collaterals.

40|$|The {{development}} of locomotion {{is believed to}} result from the maturation of the spinal circuits controlling motor output, however {{little is known about}} its mechanisms. To shed some light into this process we studied the {{development of}} the synaptic connectivity of two spinal inhibitory interneurons. Adult motoneurons are controlled by inhibitory networks that include recurrent and reciprocal inhibition (Pierrot-Deseilligny 2 ̆ 6 Burke, 2005). Each is modulated by different ventral horn spinal interneurons that display synaptic connectivity adapted to their function: Renshaw cells (RCs) mediate recurrent inhibition, receive excitatory <b>inputs</b> from motor <b>axons</b> and inhibit homonymous and synergistic motoneurons; while Ia inhibitory interneurons (IaINs) mediate reciprocal inhibition, receive inputs from Ia proprioceptive afferents and inhibit antagonist motor pools. RCs and IaINs both derive from a homogenous class of embryonic ventral interneurons denominated 2 ̆ 2 V 12 ̆ 2, leading us to question whether motor axons and Ia afferents target V 1 interneurons during early development, followed by postnatal de-selection of specific inputs and generation of cells with typical RC/IaIN connectivity. Using immunohistochemistry, confocal microscopy, 3 D neuronal reconstructions and transgenic animal models expressing V 1 -IN lineage markers, we analyzed synaptic input development on V 1 -derived RCs and IaINs. We found that motor axons specifically target RCs, are established in early embryo and maintained throughout development. In contrast, Ia afferents contact both IaINs and RCs in late embryo and throughout postnatal development. Ia afferent synapses are de-selected from RCs coinciding with maturation of weight-bearing locomotion. However, Ia afferent inputs on IaINs always occurred at a higher density and were more proximally located than on RCs, suggesting a stronger bias for IaINs. We concluded that there are fundamental differences between IaINs and RCs in their competence for receiving and maintaining motor and Ia afferent inputs. Finally, we investigated the possible role of 2 ̆ 2 transient 2 ̆ 2 Ia afferent inputs on RCs by studying RC connectivity in three genetic animal models that lack Ia afferents, or have weakened/strengthened Ia afferent inputs. We found interactions between Ia afferent strength and motor <b>axon</b> <b>input</b> density on RCs, but not with other excitatory inputs, suggesting that early Ia afferent inputs contribute to shape the organization of motor synapses on RCs...|$|R
40|$|Although most {{projection}} neurons in lamina I {{express the}} neurokinin 1 receptor (NK 1 r), {{we have identified}} a population of large multipolar projection cells that lack the NK 1 r, are characterized by the high density of gephyrin puncta that coat their cell bodies and dendrites, and express the transcription factor Fos in response to noxious chemical stimulation. Here we show that these cells {{have a very high}} density of glutamatergic <b>input</b> from <b>axons</b> with strong immunoreactivity for vesicular glutamate transporter 2 that are likely to originate from excitatory interneurons. However, they receive few contacts from peptidergic primary afferents or transganglionically labeled A delta nociceptors. Unlike most glutamatergic synapses in superficial laminas, those on the gephyrin-coated cells contain the GluR 4 subunit of the AMPA receptor. A noxious heat stimulus caused Fos expression in 38 % of the gephyrin-coated cells but in 85 % of multipolar NK 1 r-immunoreactive cells. These findings are consistent with the suggestion that there is a correlation between function and morphology for lamina I neurons but indicate that {{there are at least two}} populations of multipolar neurons that differ in receptor expression, excitatory inputs, and responses to noxious stimulation. Although there are only similar to 10 gephyrin-coated cells on each side per segment in the lumbar enlargement, they constitute similar to 18 % of the lamina I component of the spinothalamic tract at this level, which suggests that they play an important role in transmission of nociceptive information to the cerebral cortex. Our results also provide the first evidence that postsynaptic GluR 4 -containing AMPA receptors are involved in spinal nociceptive transmissio...|$|R
40|$|Hippocampal glutamatergic {{pyramidal}} cells receive {{input from}} {{several types of}} GABA (gamma-amino-butyric acid) -releasing interneurons (IN-s) and innervate them reciprocally. Our goal was to characterise the receptor content that {{plays a role in}} the synaptic interactions of these neurons. Pyramidal cells expressing different GABAA receptors receive <b>input</b> on their <b>axon</b> initial segment from axo-axonic cells and on their soma from two kinds of basket cells, containing either parvalbumin (PV), or cholecystokinin (CCK). Using a quantitative electron microscopic immunogold technique, we proved that the synapses formed by the two types of basket cell show a difference in the subunit composition of GABAA receptors. We found that synapses made by PV positive basket cells showed five times less immunoreactivity for the α 2 -subunit than synapses made PV negative (CCK positive) cells. This difference is due to specific GABAA receptor α-subunit composition, because neither synaptic size, nor total receptor content was different in these two synapse populations. Synapses established by axo-axonic cells showed an intermediate immunoreactivity but the highest density of the α 2 -subunit in theie...|$|R
40|$|Studies of area {{patterning}} of the neocortex {{have focused}} on primary areas, concluding that the primary visual area, V 1, is specified by transcription factors (TFs) expressed by progenitors. Mechanisms that determine higher-order visual areas (VHO) and distinguish them from V 1 are unknown. We demonstrated a requirement for thalamocortical <b>axon</b> (TCA) <b>input</b> by genetically deleting geniculocortical TCAs and showed that they drive differentiation of patterned gene expression that distinguishes V 1 and VHO. Our findings suggest a multistage process for area patterning: TFs expressed by progenitors specify an occipital visual cortical field that differentiates into V 1 and VHO; this latter phase requires geniculocortical TCA input to the nascent V 1 that determines genetic distinctions between V 1 and VHO for all layers and ultimately determines their area-specific functional properties. Theneocortex is patterned into functionallydistinct fields that include primary sensoryareas, which receivemodality-specific sen-sory <b>input</b> from thalamocortical <b>axons</b> (TCAs) that originate from the principal sensory nuclei of the dorsal thalamus (dTh), and higher-order sen-sory areas that are connected with the primar...|$|R
50|$|Pitch is an assigned, perceptual {{property}} where {{a listener}} orders sound frequencies from low to high. Pitch is hypothesized {{to be determined}} by receiving phase-locked <b>input</b> from neuronal <b>axons</b> and combining that information into harmonics. In simple sounds consisting of one frequency, the pitch is equivalent to the frequency. There are two models of pitch perception; a spectral and a temporal. Low frequency sounds evoke the strongest pitches, suggesting that pitch is based on the temporal components of the sound.Historically, there have been many models of pitch perception. (Terhardt, 1974; Goldstein, 1973; Wightman, 1973). Many consisted of a peripheral spectral-analysis stage and a central periodicity-analysis stage. In his model, Terhardt claims that the spectral-analysis output of complex sounds, specifically low frequency ones, is a learned entity which eventually allows easy identification of the virtual pitch. The volley principle is predominantly seen during the pitch perception of lower frequencies where sounds are often resolved. Goldstein proposed that through phase-locking and temporal frequencies encoded in neuron firing rates, the brain has the itemization of frequencies that can then be used to estimate pitch.|$|R
