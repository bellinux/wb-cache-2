25|$|Historically, <b>floating</b> <b>charges</b> are a {{fascinating}} concept {{in that they}} are legal devices created entirely by lawyers in private practice; there is no legislation and no judicial decision that was the genesis of a floating charge. In 1862 in an apparently unconnected decision of Holroyd v Marshall (1862) 10 HL Cas 191 it was held that equity would recognise a charge over after-acquired property as being effective to create a security interest over that property automatically upon its acquisition.|$|E

40|$|The {{characterisation}} of {{a security}} interest as 'fixed' or 'floating' has generated much litigation in English courts. This is because a <b>floating</b> <b>charge</b> is subordinated by statute to other claims in the debtor's insolvency, whereas a fixed charge is not. This paper uses {{the example of the}} <b>floating</b> <b>charge</b> to argue that such statutory redistribution between claimants in corporate insolvency is generally undesirable. corporate insolvency, law and finance, history of <b>floating</b> <b>charge,</b> bankruptcy priorities, secured credit. ...|$|R
50|$|The company, Peachdart Ltd, {{carried on}} the {{business}} of manufacturing leather handbags. The company had granted a debenture to Barclays Bank which contained a <b>floating</b> <b>charge</b> over all of the company's assets. That <b>floating</b> <b>charge</b> was duly registered under the Companies Act 1948.|$|R
25|$|Over the 20th century, {{reform efforts}} focused on three main issues. The first {{concerned}} setting a fair system of priority among claims of different creditors. This primarily centred upon {{the ability of}} powerful contractual creditors, particularly banks, to agree to take a security interest over a company's property, leaving unsecured creditors without any remaining assets to satisfy their claims. Immediately after Salomon's case and the controversy created {{over the use of}} <b>floating</b> <b>charges,</b> the Preferential Payments in Bankruptcy Amendment Act 1897 mandated that preferential creditors (employees, liquidator expenses and taxes at the time) also had priority over the holder of a floating charge (now IA 1986 section 175). In the Enterprise Act 2002 a further major change was to create a ring-fenced fund for all unsecured creditors out of around 20 per cent of the assets subject to a floating charge. At the same time, the priority for taxpayers' claims was abolished. Since then, debate for further reform has shifted to whether the floating charge should be abolished altogether and whether a ring-fenced fund should be taken from fixed security interests. The second major area for reform was to facilitate the rescue of businesses that could still be viable. Following the Cork Report in 1982, the Insolvency Act 1986 created the administration procedure, requiring (on paper) that the managers of insolvent businesses would attempt rescue the company, and would act in all creditors' interests. After the Enterprise Act 2002 this almost wholly replaced the receivership rules by which secured creditors, with a floating charge over all assets, could run an insolvent company without regard to the claims of unsecured creditors. The third area of reform concerned accountability for people who worsened or benefited from insolvencies. As recommended by the Cork Report, the Company Directors' Disqualification Act 1986 meant directors who breached company law duties, or committed fraud could be prevented from working as directors for up to 15 years. The Insolvency Act 1986 section 214 created liability for wrongful trading. If directors failed to start the insolvency procedures when they ought to have known insolvency was inevitable, they would {{have to pay for the}} additional debts run up through prolonged trading. Furthermore, the provisions on fraudulent conveyances were extended, so that any transaction at an undervalue or other preference (without any bad intent) could be avoided, and unwound by an insolvent company.|$|E
25|$|The {{basic duty}} of the {{receiver}} was to realise value for the floating charge holder, although all preferential debts, or those with priority, {{would have to be}} paid. For other unsecured creditors, the possibility of recovering money was remote. The floating owed no duty to other creditors with regard to the timing of the appointment of a receiver, even if it could have an effect on negotiations for refinancing the business. It was accepted that a receiver had a duty to act only for the proper purpose of realising debts, and not for some ulterior motive. In Downsview Nominees Ltd v First City Corp Ltd, a company had given <b>floating</b> <b>charges</b> to two banks (Westpac first, and First City Corp second). The directors, wishing to install a friendly figure in control asked Westpac to assign its floating charge to their friend Mr Russell, who proceeded to run the business with further losses of $500,000, and refused to pass control to First City Corp, even though they offered the company discharge of all the money owed under the first debenture. The Privy Council advised that Mr Russell, as administrative receiver, had acted for an improper purpose by refusing this deal. A further case of breach of duty occurred in Medforth v Blake where the administrative receiver of a pig farm ignored the former owner's advice on how to get discounts on pig food of £1000 a week. As a result, larger debts were run up. Sir Richard Scott VC held this was a breach of an equitable duty of exercising due diligence. However, a more general duty to creditors was tightly constrained, and general liability for professional negligence was denied to exist. In Silven Properties Ltd v Royal Bank of Scotland a receiver of a property business failed to apply for planning permission on houses that could have significantly raised their value, and did not find tenants for the vacant properties, before selling them. It was alleged that the sales were at an undervalue, but the Court of Appeal held that the receiver's power of sale was exercisable without incurring any undue expense. Everything was subordinate to the duty to the receiver to realise a good price. In this respect, an administrator is not capable of disregarding other creditors, at least in law. One {{of the reasons for the}} partial abolition of administrative receivership was that after the receiver had performed his task of realising assets for the floating charge holder, very little value was left in the company for other creditors because it appeared to have fewer incentives to efficiently balance all creditors' interests. Ordinarily, once the receiver's work was done, the company would go into liquidation.|$|E

50|$|Re Brightlife Ltd 1987 1 Ch 200 is a UK {{insolvency}} law case, concerning {{the conversion of}} a <b>floating</b> <b>charge</b> into a fixed charge ("crystallisation").

The significance of the case was largely outpaced by the Insolvency Act 1986 section 251, which said a <b>floating</b> <b>charge</b> was one that was created as a <b>floating</b> <b>charge.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{decision}} was handed down the Preferential Payments in Bankruptcy Amendment Act 1897 was passed into law as a response. [...] The effect of that statute was to provide that certain classes of preferred creditors would take priority over the claims of a secured creditor under a <b>floating</b> <b>charge.</b> However, the effectiveness of that Act was limited {{by the fact that}} a <b>floating</b> <b>charge</b> crystallises into a fixed charge prior to enforcement, and so {{it was not until the}} Insolvency Act 1986 modified the provision to state that a <b>floating</b> <b>charge</b> include any charge which was created as a <b>floating</b> <b>charge</b> (i.e. irrespective of subsequent crystallisation) that priority of the preferred creditors was promoted ahead of the floating chargeholders.|$|R

2500|$|As most secured lenders {{will not}} usually have {{recourse}} to their security until the debtor company is in a parlous financial state, the usual {{position is that}} even all the remaining {{assets of the company}} are not enough to repay the debt secured by the floating charge, leaving the unsecured creditors with nothing. [...] This perception has led to a widening of the classes of preferred creditors who take ahead of the floating charge holders in a number of countries. [...] The introduction of a regime of voidable <b>floating</b> <b>charges</b> for <b>floating</b> <b>charges</b> taken just prior to the onset of insolvency is a partial response to these criticisms.|$|E
2500|$|However, in many jurisdictions, <b>floating</b> <b>charges</b> are {{required}} to be registered in order to perfect them; otherwise they may be unenforceable on the bankruptcy of the debtor. [...] This registration requirement has often led to other property rights (such as rights under a defective retention of title clause), which have been re-characterized as a floating charge being held to be void for non-registration.|$|E
2500|$|Because of the {{differences}} in priority of fixed charges and <b>floating</b> <b>charges,</b> security documents came to be drafted to contain as many charges expressed to be fixed charges as possible, and leave as little as possible covered by the floating charge, where it would have secondary priority to the claims of the preferential creditors. [...] A number of judicial decisions gave conflicting interpretations over the characteristics that were definitive of a fixed charge, particularly with reference to charges over book debts (and a fixed charge that did not contain those characteristics would be [...] "recharacterised" [...] as a floating charge). [...] The position was definitively resolved in NatWest v Spectrum Plus Limited when the House of Lords confirmed that a charge over book debts could be a fixed charge, provided that the secured creditor exhibited the necessary degree of control over the proceeds of the book debts. [...] This would normally require that they either be paid into a blocked account, or that they be paid directly to the secured creditor. [...] Any lesser degree of control was not consistent with a fixed charge, and such charges would be construed as <b>floating</b> <b>charges,</b> regardless of what label the parties had given them.|$|E
25|$|A {{critical}} {{difference between}} the <b>floating</b> <b>charge</b> and the <b>floating</b> lien is that UCC security interests, including floating liens, can be granted by any kind of debtor, including individuals or partnerships (and will thus have priority in bankruptcy), whereas the <b>floating</b> <b>charge</b> can be granted only by corporate entities.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} <b>float</b> <b>charge</b> {{operation}} of Valve Regulated Lead Acid (VRLA) batteries in standby power applications. While the telecommunication standby power {{system is the}} targeted application, the results are applicable in any situation where VRLA batteries are subjected to long periods of <b>float</b> <b>charge.</b> The goals of <b>float</b> <b>charge</b> are identified and a test and analysis procedure is developed to provide a means of assessing {{the effectiveness of the}} applied <b>float</b> <b>charge.</b> The primary goal of <b>float</b> <b>charge</b> is to counteract the natural self-discharge of the battery and indefinitely maintain it in a fully charged state. A secondary goal of <b>float</b> <b>charge</b> is to maximise the life of the battery. This is achieved by ensuring that ageing mechanisms such as positive grid corrosion and gas venting are maintained at minimum levels. The problems associated with conventional <b>float</b> <b>charge</b> control are investigated and, in particular, the electrode imbalance problems associated with some long life VRLA cells are detailed. These electrode imbalance problems can result in the cell suffering a gradual discharge of the negative electrode while the cell appears healthy and on a <b>float</b> <b>charge.</b> This ultimately results in reduced cell capacity and is identified as a major cause of the premature failure of long life VRLA cells. <b>Float</b> <b>charge</b> analysis and the subsequent optimisation relies heavily on knowledge of the polarisation distribution between the positive and negative electrodes within a cell. Conventionally, this is determined {{with the aid of a}} reference electrode, although such testing is only possible in a well-controlled laboratory environment. By modelling the steady state and transient features of both the positive and negative electrodes, a test and analysis procedure is developed to estimate the polarisation distribution within a conventional 2 V VRLA cell, in effect creating a virtual reference electrode. The developed procedure exploits differences in the transient response of each electrode to estimate their polarisations at the applied float voltage. The polarisation estimations are typically accurate to within 10 mV, the window of polarisation relating to minimal positive grid corrosion is approximately 40 mV wide, and the total polarisation applied to a VRLA cell is around 130 mV. The test requires only a very low rate constant current discharge, and cell terminal voltage measurements. This test may be automated and applied to cells in field service, and provides the necessary measure to gauge <b>float</b> <b>charge</b> optimisation. The developed test is able to verify that a cell on <b>float</b> <b>charge</b> is indeed fully charged, and assists in determining the optimal float voltage for maximum cell life...|$|R
40|$|The {{proliferation}} {{of the corporate}} form {{has resulted in a}} state of dependency by the economy on the companies operating within it. These companies require the free flow of capital for investment, growth, and avoidance of precipitate insolvency. For over a century, the <b>floating</b> <b>charge</b> has played a cardinal role in the provision of credit to companies in the UK. Over the same period, the charge has undergone several statutory interventions raising doubts as to the ability of financiers to rely on the charge as a basis for extending and securing credit. This thesis explores the impact of some of these changes on lending practices and insolvency outcomes. The changes examined primarily relate to the redistribution of <b>floating</b> <b>charge</b> assets in favour of other creditors in insolvency. The thesis uses analytical and empirical research methods. There are six chapters in the thesis. Chapters 1 and 2 provide a commercial background to the study and identify the research question; they explore the impact of companies on the economy, and the importance of credit and security. Chapter 3 contains an empirical account of the impact that the treatment of the <b>floating</b> <b>charge</b> in insolvency has on lending practices and insolvency outcomes. Chapter 4 examines the interest conferred by a <b>floating</b> <b>charge</b> against current inroads into the rights of a floating chargee. Chapter 5 scrutinises the raison d’être for redistributing <b>floating</b> <b>charge</b> assets. Chapter 6 concludes the thesis by providing analytical commentary on proposals regarding the future of the <b>floating</b> <b>charge</b> and factoring. This is followed by a Postscript which summarises the arguments and evidence contained in the thesis, and sets out a number of recommendations. The thesis will show that the <b>floating</b> <b>charge</b> is still used in corporate finance transactions. Proposals to unify company security interests would not affect this. However there are noticeable alterations in lending practices, partly devised {{as a response to the}} treatment of the <b>floating</b> <b>charge.</b> These alterations sometimes have adverse effects on insolvency outcomes. Overall, it argues that the treatment of the <b>floating</b> <b>charge</b> lacks sound justification, and, in certain respects, fails in its objectives...|$|R
2500|$|<b>Floating</b> <b>charges</b> are {{enormously}} {{popular as}} a security device for two principal reasons.

[...] Additionally, security documents will usually include express terms that a default by the person granting the security will trigger crystallisation.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Floating</b> <b>charges</b> {{have been}} criticised as a [...] "raw deal" [...] for {{unsecured}} creditors. In Salomon v. Salomon & Co.

2500|$|In {{countries}} that permit {{the making of}} an administration order, the floating charge had another key benefit. [...] The holder of a floating charge could appoint an administrative receiver and block {{the appointment of a}} court-appointed administrator, and thus retain control of the distribution of the assets of the company. [...] Practice became such that companies were asked to give [...] "lightweight" [...] <b>floating</b> <b>charges</b> to secured lenders which had no collateral value purely to allow the holders to block administration orders, an approach that was approved by the courts in Re Croftbell Ltd [...] BCC 781. [...] In the United Kingdom the law has now been changed by statute, but the power to block appointments of administrators has been retained in many other common law jurisdictions.|$|E
2500|$|The law {{relating}} to insolvency, bankruptcy and liquidation is {{regulated by the}} Insolvency Act, 2003 and the Insolvency Rules, 2005 in the British Virgin Islands. [...] The act is broadly based upon the Insolvency Act 1986 of the United Kingdom (without the changes brought into effect by the UK's Enterprise Act 2002), but modified in certain specific regards {{in relation to the}} jurisdiction's role as an offshore centre. [...] The Insolvency Act is [...] "predicated heavily towards the protection of secured creditors' rights". [...] The legislation includes the ISDA model netting laws to facilitate set-off upon a credit event in derivatives transactions. [...] It also contains specific [...] "safe harbour" [...] provisions {{relating to}} vulnerable transactions (principally undervalue transactions, unfair preferences and voidable <b>floating</b> <b>charges)</b> on an insolvency, to protect structured finance transactions.|$|E
2500|$|A stricter regime {{exists for}} <b>floating</b> <b>charges</b> under IA 1986 section 245 that could {{prejudice}} other creditors in the {{run up to}} insolvency. Any floating charge created up to one year {{before the onset of}} insolvency is avoidable at the company's instance if new money was not advanced to the company in return. So a company cannot grant a floating charge to a creditor to secure past advances made by that creditor, unless given at least [...] "at the same time". In Re Shoe Lace Ltd Hoffmann J held that £350,000 advanced in April and May was not close enough to a floating charge created in July to be considered [...] "at the same time". The floating charge could not secure those amounts. Because the context of the legislation was a business one, and {{in view of the fact}} that <b>floating</b> <b>charges</b> can be registered up to 21 days after their creation, a few months was far too long. Second 245 only rescinds the charge, and not the debt itself, which remains in effect as before. Yet the creditor becomes unsecured and ranks alongside other creditors. Banks operating accounts for companies in overdraft have an advantage in this respect. Re Yeovil Glove Co Ltd held that if the overall level of debt remains the same, before and after a floating charge is created, and if money turns over by payments of the company in and withdrawals out, the bank's continued extension of credit will continually [...] "harden" [...] their floating charge. Although Yeovil Glove Co LTd was always indebted to the bank before a floating charge was created, and was indebted at the point of insolvency, because it had deposited and withdrawn a greater amount, the bank's floating charge was considered secure. Finally, Companies Act 2006, section 874 stipulates that any charge, including a floating charge, that is not registered is considered void. This simple provision encourages a transparency of security interests, at least if creditors are in a position to check the register.|$|E
