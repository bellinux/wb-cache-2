40|$|Objective—To {{identify}} {{major environmental}} and farm management {{factors associated with}} the occurrence of tuberculosis (TB) on cattle farms in northeastern Michigan. Design—Case-control study. Sample Population— 17 cattle farms with infected cattle and 51 control farms. Procedure—Each case farm (laboratory confirmed diagnosis of Mycobacterium bovis infection) was matched with 2 to 4 control farms (negative whole-herd test results within previous 12 months) {{on the basis of}} type of farm (dairy or beef) and location. Cattle farm data were collected from in-person interviews and mailed questionnaires. Wildlife TB data were gathered through state wildlife surveillance. Environmental data were gathered from a satellite image-based geographic information system. Multivariable conditional logistic regression for matched analysis was performed. Results—Major factors associated with increased farm risk of TB were higher TB prevalence among wild deer and cattle farms in the area, herd size, and ponds or creeks in <b>cattle</b> <b>housing</b> areas. Factors associated with reduced farm risk of TB were greater amounts of natural open lands in the surrounding area and reducing deer access to <b>cattle</b> <b>housing</b> areas by <b>housing</b> <b>cattle</b> in barns, barnyards, or feedlots and use of electrified wire or barbed wire for livestock fencing. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance—Results suggest that certain environmental and management factors may be associated with risk of TB on cattle farms...|$|R
50|$|Erected in 1903 as {{premises}} for the Union Bank of Australia, <b>Cattle</b> <b>House</b> forms part of {{the historic}} Quay Street precinct in Rockhampton which is distinguished by its late 19th century commercial buildings. The Quay Street precinct stands as a legacy to {{the activities of the}} Port of Rockhampton which served the vast area of central Queensland from 1858. The port was influential in establishing Rockhampton as the premier commercial city of central Queensland and the river wharves fostered the substantial commercial development along Quay Street, enabling it to become the principal business district of the city. The solidity of the buildings were a symbol of Rockhampton's great wealth during the latter 19th century which was precipitated by the success of the Mount Morgan gold mines discovered in 1882. <b>Cattle</b> <b>House</b> {{is an example of the}} later development in Quay Street which occurred before the diminishing importance of the wharves saw commercial development become more closely tied to the city centre and the new railway from about 1903.|$|R

50|$|Prasad files a {{case against}} Papaiah about mixing salt in ammonia fertilizer. Dharmaiah tells the Collector and it causes Papaiah to lose {{reputation}} and his father Kotaiah to lose his job. Dharmaiah escapes {{from the house and}} hides in Bhushaiah's <b>cattle</b> <b>house</b> to avoid the ire of his father. Kotaiah searches for his son and reaches the <b>cattle</b> <b>house</b> with a lamp and the grass is on fire. Bhushaiah's group catches Kotaiah and misunderstands that Papaiah sent him. Satyam comes to rescue and gives evidence before the Collector to save Kotaiah. None of the village elders, Papaiah, Bhushaiah and Kotaiah, can understand the intensity of the friendship between Dharmaiah and Satyam and their commitment to truth. Satyam and Dharmaiah escape from village and face several problems in the city. Prasad comes to know that militant revolutionaries led by his childhood friend Bhanu (Krishnam Raju) are going to kill Papaiah and tells Satyam and Dharma to inform Papaiah. Militants and police face a fight and the rebel leader is injured and caught.

25|$|Dairy <b>cattle</b> <b>housing</b> systems {{vary greatly}} {{throughout}} the world depending on the climate, dairy size, and feeding strategies. Housing must provide access to feed, water and protection from relevant environmental conditions. One obvious issue for humanely <b>housing</b> <b>cattle</b> is temperature extremes. Heat stress can decrease fertility and milk production in cattle. Providing shade is a very common method for reducing heat stress. Barns may also incorporate fans or tunnel ventilation into {{the architecture of the}} barn structure. Overly cold conditions, while rarely deadly for cattle, cause increases in maintenance energy requirements and thus increased feed intake and decreased milk production. During the winter months, where temperatures are low enough, dairy cattle are often kept inside barns which are warmed by their collective body heat.|$|R
