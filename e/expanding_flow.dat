50|$|The {{distinction}} between equilibrium and frozen {{is important because}} it is possible for a gas such as air to have significantly different properties (speed-of-sound, viscosity etc.) for the same thermodynamic state; e.g., pressure and temperature. Frozen gas can be a significant issue in the wake behind an entry vehicle. During reentry, free stream air is compressed to high temperature and pressure by the entry vehicle's shock wave. Non-equilibrium air in the shock layer is then transported past the entry vehicle's leading side into a region of rapidly <b>expanding</b> <b>flow</b> that causes freezing. The frozen air can then be entrained into a trailing vortex behind the entry vehicle. Correctly modelling the flow in the wake of an entry vehicle is very difficult. Thermal protection shield (TPS) heating in the vehicle's afterbody is usually not very high, but the geometry and unsteadiness of the vehicle's wake can significantly influence aerodynamics (pitching moment) and particularly dynamic stability.|$|E

50|$|A {{hypersonic}} {{wind tunnel}} {{is designed to}} generate a hypersonic flow field in the working section, thus simulating the typical flow features of this flow regime - including compression shocks and pronounced boundary layer effects, entropy layer and viscous interaction zones and most importantly high total temperatures of the flow. The speed of these tunnels vary from Mach 5 to 15. The power requirement of a wind tunnel increases with the cross section, the flow density and is directly proportional to the third power of the test velocity. Hence installation of a continuous, {{closed circuit wind tunnel}} remains a costly affair. The first continuous Mach 7-10 wind tunnel with 1x1 m test section was planned at Kochel am See, Germany during WW II and finally put into operation as 'Tunnel A' in the late 1950s at AEDC Tullahoma, TN, USA for an installed power of 57 MW. In view of these high facility demands, also intermittently operated experimental facilities like blow-down wind tunnels are designed and installed to simulate the hypersonic flow. A hypersonic wind tunnel comprises in flow direction the main components: heater/cooler arrangements, dryer, convergent/divergent nozzle, test section, second throat and diffuser. A blow-down wind tunnel has a low vacuum reservoir at the back end, while a continuously operated, closed circuit wind tunnel has a high power compressor installation instead. Since the temperature drops with the <b>expanding</b> <b>flow,</b> the air inside the test section has the chance of becoming liquefied. For that reason, preheating is particularly critical (the nozzle may require cooling).|$|E
40|$|When {{stationary}} observers view an optic-flow pattern, visually induced self-motion perception (vection) and a form {{of motion}} sickness known as simulator sickness (SS), can result. Previous results suggest that an <b>expanding</b> <b>flow</b> pattern leads to more SS than a contracting pattern. Sensory conflict, a possible cause of SS, may be more salient when an expanding optic-flow pattern is viewed. An experiment was conducted to test if a more salient sensory conflict accompanying <b>expanding</b> <b>flow</b> patterns might inhibit vection. Participants (n= 15) viewed a pattern of blue squares, either steadily expanded or contracted, on a large rear-projection screen. Vection onset and magnitude were measured for 30 s with a computer-interfaced slide device. Vection onset was significantly faster, and vection magnitude stronger, when a contracting pattern was viewed. We propose that our extensive experience with forward self-motion may form a neural expectancy (exposure-history) about the sensory inputs which typically accompany <b>expanding</b> <b>flow.</b> However, since backward self-motion is less common, {{there may be a}} weaker exposure-history for contracting flow, and as a result these patterns generate less salient sensory conflict and subsequently less vection...|$|E

40|$|Recently {{there has}} been {{increased}} interest in perception of self-motion (vection) in virtual environments. Bubka et. al. (2008) found less vection with an expanding optic flow pattern (visual stimuli approaching viewer) than with a contracting optic flow pattern (visual stimuli receding from the viewer). In another study, researchers found that people with video game experience are better at discriminating contracting optic flow than individuals with less video game experience, but {{no significant difference between}} the two groups at discriminating expanding optic flow (Hutchinson 2 ̆ 6 Stocks, 2013). We examined effects of video game experience on vection, as well as motion sickness, with expanding and contracting optic flow patterns. Assuming that contracting flow patterns are more common in video games than in real life, we predicted experienced video gamers would feel more vection with a contracting flow than with an <b>expanding</b> <b>flow.</b> In our study, introductory psychology students rated time spent playing video games in the past 6 months. In a 3 D head-mounted display, participants viewed one of four displays of moving white dots against a dark background for 8 minutes. Dots were displayed in an expanding or contracting flow pattern. The task was to press the spacebar when participants noticed a change in color of a crosshair in the center of the screen and to press a foot pedal when they experienced vection. Participants rated feelings of motion sickness before and after viewing the display. The results showed that more experienced video game players felt significantly more vection (perception of self-motion) in the contracting flow condition than did less experienced players. Highly experienced gamers felt significantly less motion sickness in the <b>expanding</b> <b>flow</b> condition than did less experienced gamers. We conclude that there may be two different mechanisms governing the effects of video game experience on vection and motion sickness. Because backward self-motion is more commonly experienced in video games than in the real world, there may be increased perception of selfmotion for a contracting flow pattern (visual stimuli receding from the viewer) for video gamers. However, everyone has experience with expanding optic flow as a cue for forward self-motion, regardless of video game experience, and therefore there would be no effect of video game experience for the <b>expanding</b> <b>flow</b> pattern. To explain our motion sickness findings, we observe that even in the virtual world, there is more exposure to <b>expanding</b> <b>flow</b> than contracting flow. If motion sickness is caused by sensory conflict between lack of vestibular feedback and visual cues for movement, then experienced video gamers may have less motion sickness for <b>expanding</b> <b>flow</b> because of more experience with this type of sensory conflict.

The TROVA test-rig was built in order to investigate the non-ideal compressible-fluid behavior of typical <b>expanding</b> <b>flows</b> occurring within organic Rankine cycles (ORC) turbine passages. The test rig implements a batch Rankine cycle where a planar converging-diverging nozzle replaces the turbine and represents a test section. Investigations related to both fields of non-ideal compressible-fluid dynamics fundamentals and turbomachinery are allowed. The nozzle can be operated with different working fluids and operating conditions aiming at measuring independently the pressure, the temperature and the velocity field and thus providing data to verify the thermo-fluid dynamic models adopted to predict the behavior of these flows. The limiting values of pressure and temperature are 50 bar and 400 °C respectively. The early measurements are performed along the nozzle axis, where an isentropic process is expected to occur. In particular, the results reported here refer to the nozzle operated in adapted conditions using the siloxane vapor MDM as working fluid in thermodynamic regions where mild to medium non-ideal compressible-fluid effects are present.
