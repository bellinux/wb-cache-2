The straightforward construction techniques of the Do 228 were also reproduced for the 328, despite making increased use of composite materials {{in areas such as}} the rear fuselage and empennage. The 328 reportedly made greater use of composites than any of its direct competitors at launch, the use of the Kevlar-carbon fiber composites is claimed to have reduced its weight by 20 per cent. Various materials are used across the airframe; amongst these, an aluminium alloy is used for the pressure fuselage and much of the wingbox, a titanium alloy for the tail cone, and glass <b>fibre</b> <b>reinforced</b> <b>plastic</b> for the radome and leading edge of the vertical stabilizer.

40|$|AbstractComposite {{materials}} are mainly {{known for their}} use in high-tech applications like structural aircraft parts. Carbon <b>fibre</b> <b>reinforced</b> <b>plastics</b> are characterized by good mechanical properties and low weight, but are relatively expensive and their manufacturing process involves high levels of energy consumption. Due to these disadvantages, the current use of this material in the automotive area is limited. In this paper the energy consumption for the manufacturing process, the utilisation phase, and the recycling phase of three different car models will be investigated. A comparison between the different materials including carbon <b>fibre</b> <b>reinforced</b> <b>plastics,</b> aluminium and steel will be performed. Although the manufacturing process of carbon <b>fibre</b> <b>reinforced</b> <b>plastics</b> is highly energy intensive, there is an advantage in the overall energy consumption during {{the life cycle of}} its vehicle. In an additional scenario, the energy consumption of the manufacturing process for carbon composites is calculated with 10 % less energy consumption. It will be shown that decreasing the energy consumption in the manufacturing process of carbon composites will offer high potentials for the automotive industry to improve the energy balance with the usage of a high amount of carbon <b>fibre</b> <b>reinforced</b> <b>plastics...</b>|$|R

40|$|High {{performance}} carbon <b>fibre</b> <b>reinforced</b> <b>plastics</b> were {{modified by}} nanoscaled boehmite particles and carbon nanotubes for enhanced mechanical performance. The performed tests show different {{results for the}} two types of additives. While boehmite particles especially increase strength and stiffness, CNTs are more effective in minimizing crack propagation. The difference can be attributed to distinct reinforcing mechanisms. The cubical shaped boehmite particles mainly show crack deflection and debonding, while the CNTs are more effective in bridging the gap. In addition to the mechanical performance, the viscosities of the two liquid nanocomposites differ significantly. Results of decreasing the viscosity by shortening the CNTs are also presented in the paper.
