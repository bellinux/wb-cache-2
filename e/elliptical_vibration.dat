40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{operation}} of a linear or rotary ultrasonic motor relies on the production of an <b>elliptical</b> <b>vibration</b> at {{the surface of the}} stator. To achieve a suitable vibration state, many ultrasonic motors use a combination of structural modes of the stator. Because these modes may be different in nature, designing a viable stator is not trivial.

Similarly, it may also be desired to incorporate parameters such as the operation frequency, geometrical dimensions and weight, electrical current and so on, which may render the design problem extremely difficult to solve. To help in designing such ultrasonic structures, it is proposed to use the genetic optimization method in combination with the finite element method.

However, these lenses get complicated in profile and need higher form accuracy. This is why high-precision micro-machining is getting more important than ever. In general, in micro-machining, the size effect increases cutting forces due to causes such undesired problems as form deformation, chatter and burr. These troubles deteriorate the quality of optical parts both in form accuracy and surface roughness. A lot of {{studies have been done}} developing new methods to overcome. Those are on stiff and low thermal structures of machine tool, micro-feeding mechanism to be controlled down to sub micron, and micro-machining process itself. Vibration cutting is one of the attempts to increase micro-machinability. This research aim at investigating the two-dimensional vibration cutting and its effect on surface roughness, burr and so on. <b>Elliptical</b> <b>vibration</b> cutting mechanism is analyzed and experiments are carried out using a tool-vibrator composed of two PZT actuators. One-axis vibration mechanism, in which a horn was used to achieve the vibration of high frequency and quite large amplitude, was proved very effective in decreasing cutting forces. But it has been mainly applied to turning...|$|E
