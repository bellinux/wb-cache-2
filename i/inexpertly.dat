Francis McComas wrote favorably of Typewriter in the Sky, and {{characterized}} it as [...] "an entertaining adventure-farce badly {{in need of}} editing". Reviewing the same edition, Groff Conklin termed it [...] "a silly idea <b>inexpertly</b> carried out". The New York Times reviewer Villiers Gerson found Typewriter to be [...] "an ironic and jaunty adventure story." [...] Damon Knight gave the book a mixed review, commenting, [...] "The problem [...] is a tough one, and Hubbard does not so much solve it as slide around it.... This weakness is more than compensated for by the ending of the story itself– Three immortal lines".|$|E

The 19th-century scholar George Scharf argued {{on the basis}} of the inconsistencies in the lights and shadows that the original image would have been [...] "either a limning or a crayon drawing". These typically used outlines rather than chiaroscuro modelling. He deduced that Droeshout had <b>inexpertly</b> attempted to add modelling shadows. Mary Edmond points out that Droeshout the Elder seems to have had an association with Marcus Gheeraerts the portraitist, and notes that there is evidence that a portrait of Shakespeare by Gheeraerts may have once existed. She surmises that Droeshout's engraving may have been derived from this lost portrait. Cooper argues that the poor drawing and modelling of the doublet and collar suggests that Droeshout was copying a lost drawing or painting that only depicted Shakespeare's head and shoulders. The body was added by the engraver himself, as was common practice.|$|E

2500|$|Safety in the {{practice}} of throwing techniques depends on the skill level of both tori and uke. <b>Inexpertly</b> applied throws have the potential to injure both tori and uke, for instance when tori compensates for poor technique by powering through the throw. Similarly, poor ukemi can result in injury, particularly from more powerful throws that uke lacks the skill to breakfall from. For these reasons, throws are normally taught in order of difficulty for both tori and uke. This is exemplified in the Gokyo , a traditional grouping of throws arranged in order of difficulty of ukemi. Those grouped in [...] are relatively simple to breakfall from whereas those grouped in [...] are difficult to breakfall from.|$|E

Thus I made the second discovery on that first occasion, that the nurture of the little Pockets consisted of alternately tumbling up and lying down.|$|E

Being only seventeen, {{he had not yet}} acquired a taste for kissing. He <b>inexpertly</b> gave Mrs. Byron quite a shock by the collision of their teeth. Conscious of the failure, he drew himself upright, and tried to hide his hands, which were exceedingly dirty, in the scanty folds of his jacket. He was a well-grown youth, with neck and shoulders already strongly formed, and short auburn hair curling in little rings close to his scalp. He had blue eyes, and an expression of boyish good-humor, which, however, did not convey any assurance of good temper.|$|E

It has a 4 ft handle, and a 16 in head. It is extremely useful for clearing undergrowth and unwanted hedgerows. Both the concave and convex edges may be sharpened edges, but spear-points and back-hooks are not available. Expertly used, the brush-axe can fell a 3 in tree with a single blow. <b>Inexpertly</b> used, it can pose a grave danger of accidental maiming to those standing nearby.|$|E
50|$|There is {{disagreement}} {{regarding the}} relevance of the music itself. While some writers consider it always subordinate to the text in terms of importance, others such as Ramón Barce have theorised that the music comes first in the composition of the work; incoherent texts, called monstruos ("monsters"), merely gave the librettist a rhythm to which he must fit his words; these words were then often <b>inexpertly</b> fiddled with by the composer). In any case, the music does not usually correspond closely to the action, but rather is something in the background, sometimes coming in unexpectedly.|$|E

50|$|The disease {{prevention}} law was only applied to women, {{which became the}} primary rallying point for activists who argued that the law was both ineffective and inherently unfair to women. Women could be picked up off the streets, suspected of prostitution on little or no evidence, and subjected to an examination. These were <b>inexpertly</b> performed by male police officers, making the exams painful as well as humiliating. After two extensions {{of the law in}} 1866 and 1869 the acts were finally repealed in 1886. Josephine Butler was a women's rights crusader who fought to repeal the Acts.|$|E

The digital reconstruction took place at Alloyweld Inspection Company. Unfortunately, when these remains were originally found, the archaeologists had accidentally shattered the skull with a pickaxe and had to piece it back together.

5000|$|Weight Loss {{is about}} the strange life (from age 11 to age 37) of a sexual deviant named Bhola, whose {{attitude}} {{to most of the}} people around him depends on their lust worthiness. Bhola’s tastes are not, to put it mildly, conventional. Sex is a form of depravity for him and he has fetishes about everyone from teachers to roadside sadhus to servants; he progresses from fantasizing about the portly family cook Gopinath to falling “madly in love” with a vegetable vendor and her husband. This last obsession spans {{the entire length of the}} book and most of Bhola’s life - he even ends up teaching at a college in an obscure hill-station hundreds of miles from his home because he wants to be near the couple. At various other stages in his life he gets expelled from school for defecating in a teacher’s office, participates in an <b>inexpertly</b> carried out circumcision (one of the book’s many manifestations of the “weight loss” motif).|$|E

5000|$|The {{medical ethics}} {{committee}} of the British Medical Association states:"In the past, circumcision of boys has been considered to be either medically or socially beneficial or, at least, neutral. The general perception has been that no significant harm was caused to the child and therefore with appropriate consent it could be carried out. The medical benefits previously claimed, however, have not been convincingly proven, {{and it is now}} widely accepted, including by the BMA, that this surgical procedure has medical and psychological risks. It is essential that doctors perform male circumcision only where this is demonstrably {{in the best interests of}} the child. The responsibility to demonstrate that non-therapeutic circumcision is in a particular child's best interests falls to his parents."'Unnecessarily invasive procedures should not be used where alternative, less invasive techniques, are equally efficient and available. It is important that doctors keep up to date and ensure that any decisions to undertake an invasive procedure are based on the best available evidence. Therefore, to circumcise for therapeutic reasons where medical research has shown other techniques to be at least as effective and less invasive would be unethical and inappropriate. Male circumcision in cases where there is a clear clinical need is not normally controversial. Nevertheless, normal anatomical and physiological characteristics of the infant foreskin have in the past been misinterpreted as being abnormal. [...] Non-therapeutic circumcision Male circumcision that is performed for any reason other than physical clinical need is termed non-therapeutic (or sometimes “ritual”) circumcision. Some people ask for non-therapeutic circumcision for religious reasons, some to incorporate a child into a community, and some want their sons to be like their fathers. Circumcision is a defining feature of some faiths. There is a spectrum of views within the BMA’s membership about whether non-therapeutic male circumcision is a beneficial, neutral or harmful procedure or whether it is superfluous, and whether it should ever be done on a child who is not capable of deciding for himself. The medical harms or benefits have not been unequivocally proven except to the extent that there are clear risks of harm if the procedure is done <b>inexpertly.</b> The Association has no policy on these issues. Indeed, it would be difficult to formulate a policy in the absence of unambiguously clear and consistent medical data on the implications of the intervention. As a general rule, however, the BMA believes that parents should be entitled to make choices about how best to promote their children’s interests, and it is for society to decide what limits should be imposed on parental choices.Commenting on the development of the 2003 British Medical Association guidance on circumcision, Mussell (2004) states that debate in society is [...] "intensely fraught, with individuals and groups holding conflicting positions." [...] Identifying three positions, [...] "support," [...] "qualified support," [...] and [...] "opposition," [...] he suggests that this controversy [...] "is also reflected within the multicultural, multifaith BMA membership." [...] He identifies this as a difficulty in achieving consensus within the medical ethics committee. Arguments put forward in discussions, according to Mussell, included that circumcision [...] "is a net benefit focused on concepts such as social integration and cultural acceptance", but also that it is [...] "a net harm focused on the breach of children’s rights—the right of the child to be free from physical intrusion and the right of the child to choose in the future." ...|$|E

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{focuses on}} a current issue of classifying spiders into their families. The incorrect recognitions of a family are often caused by inappropriate choice of morphological features and their ambiguous characteristics for determination usage. In a literary review, various morphological characters of spiders used for their determination to families are summarized and described. Subsequently, two Czech keys were tested by respondents, which provided {{a view of the}} steps and features causing difficulties in classifying spider families. Thus, I outline both unquestioning acceptance of features from older sources and the fact that their usage is not always a reliable tool for determination. Often neglected is the attitude of inexperienced observers who look upon the spider body <b>inexpertly,</b> not being influenced by arachnological traditions, and therefore, with a certain dose of exaggeration, objectively. This is the reason why the research was done mainly with the help of amateur public. In the final parts of the bachelor thesis, I both discuss problems that emerged and were recorded during the observation and recommend suitable improvements concerning the classification keys...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Everybody (in Hungary) {{talks about}} the mutual {{recognition}} of diplomas in the EU, in particular connected {{with the implementation of}} the Bologna process as an achievement, but it is not generally known {{that it is necessary to}} have competencies for some activities. The contemporary engineer should be conversant with aesthetics, sociology, economics and ecology. In the socialist era engineering education was unambiguously specialist by nature in Hungary. With the political changes new demands presented themselves in engineering education: information technology, entrepreneurship, management, quality systems, service sector, politics, but unfortunately other demands presented themselves as well, which are not normally the tasks of higher education, e. g. language education. There are activities, which if done <b>inexpertly</b> can be dangerous for society, people’s safety, health and properties or the environment but the client can choose the contractor with confidence. For example: engineer- designer, expert, contractor, consultant, building supervisor – or medical doctor, lawyer.

40|$|Ovaj rad prošireni je tekst članka „Crkvica sv. Dujma u Dolu“ u kojem se po novim saznanjima i objavljenoj literaturi donosi povijest ove dolske crkve. Rad nastoji biti poticaj za sustavnije arheološko istraživanje ostataka crkve te dostojnije obilježavanje lokaliteta. The {{church of}} St. Domnius (Dujam) which was {{situated}} at the north part of the village of Dol, is recorded in 1467 when mentioned as having a benefice. The place where it is stood is called by people from Dol Piski or Molo bardo (small hill). According to the cadaster of 1834, the church area was 14, 4 m 2. During Valerius 2 ̆ 7 s visitation of 1571, it was already a ruin, so he ordered it to be pulled down and to mount a cross on the premises. At {{the beginning of the}} 17 th c. the church rector is unknown, the church almost demolished, empty, without altar or door and it used to be the place to build up fire in and on occasions even animals were passing through it. The church was completely pulled down in the 19 th c., and the remnants had <b>inexpertly</b> been excavated in 1991. Only the semi-circle, east-oriented apse is now visible and some bits of mortar. According to its position and size (cca 6 x 2 m) and titular, it is obviously an early Medieval church. During the preliminary investigation (May 2016), trying to locate the church foundations, Vilma Stojković, a conservator, Marko Matković an archeologist, and Ivica Moškatelo a historian, have succeeded to confirm the position of the apse and the south wall after the ground cleaning, the wall following the bedrock. Apart from some stone blocks, the remnant pieces of mortar have been found on the ground „within the church“, {{as well as on the}} stones scattered around. While inspecting the site, they noticed a piece of stone with relief representing a basket with berries. The fragment is 17 cm wide and 10 cm high, made of local carst stone. This important piece is probably the only thing by which we might date the church with precision. It is interesting to take into consideration don Šime Ljubić 2 ̆ 7 s pondering for he thinks that the inhabitants from the mainland, fleeing the slaughter following the downfall of Salona that fell into Avars’ hands, took shelter on the neighboring islands and that this can explain the exact time of the church building and why it had been dedicated to St Domnius. Thomas the Archdeacon also mentions the matter. Don Frane Bulić had also visited the site in 1898. He wrote that the parish priest Juraj Carić had told him of the villagers calling it „Greek church“ and that it had been pulled down in 1840. In his papers, Bulić mentions the case of the Abbot Martin, who after having collected the bones of the saints from the churches in the devastated Salona, had taken shelter from bad weather on his way to Rome in the safe part of Pharia (around 640 A. D.). So, the church on the hill so close to Stari Grad would be the memory of this event. These thoughts of the eminent don Frane Bulić are followed by the local legend. The legend is preserved in the papers of the Dol teacher and chronologist Nikola Posinković, wherein it is written that there exists a legend about safekeeping the bones of St. Domnius in that church, and that previously to the church building they had been safeguarded at a secret location. Recent times legend connects the church to one Vranković, who had dug up treasure in front of the church entrance. Although there is no trace of the church on the location, except the scattered mortar and stones, the place deserves to be adequately marked. The parish priest of Dol don Mario Zelanović and the members of the Church Council heartily support the idea and will do so in cooperation with experts...|$|E
