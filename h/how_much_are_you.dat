6000|$|During {{the thirty}} days that these Japonians were in retirement, {{it is not}} to be expressed, what {{celestial}} illuminations, what holy thoughts, what interior delights, the Holy Spirit infused into them. Anger could speak of nothing but of God; and spoke of Him with so much fervency, that it seemed even to burn him up. The mystery of the passion moved him above all the rest; and he was so ravished with the goodness of God, so possessed with love, in considering a God crucified, that he breathed nothing but martyrdom, and the salvation of his brethren. So that he was often heard to cry out, {{in the midst of his}} devotions, [...] "How glad should I be to die for thee, O my God!

I used to think the women behind the bars had a fine time of it. I should not think so now--at least, not in a big town--but in places like those you talk of, it would be {{different}} altogether. I should like the journey, too; it would be like going with gipsies, which I used to think would be the happiest life in the world. I was afraid when we got out here you would be wanting to do another thing like the last, and I would not have helped you--at any rate, not till we were getting down to our last shilling. But I like the thought of this, and I will do my best for you. I suppose they are a rough wild lot out there, but I think I can take care of myself. But this time, mind, I shall want a share; I am not going to work for years and then be thrown over when it suits you.

[...] "You've charged me for every item on the menu, apparently, and I am paying the bill? But <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> paying me for playing my compositions? The answer, of course, was [...] "nothing." [...] With this, Herbert sued Patrick Shanley, for the illegal use of his compositions. The suit went all the way to the Supreme Court, where Oliver Wendell Holmes ruled in favor of Victor Herbert and as a result, ASCAP was founded.|$|E

5000|$|One of Zapata's daily {{cartoons}} in {{the newspaper}} El Nacional {{became the subject of}} heavy criticism in Aló Presidente, the weekly TV program of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez, in the year 2000 because of Zapata's view on the transformation of Venezuelan civil society into a military society caused by some of the policies implemented by Chávez at the time, like appointing in government offices numerous ex-military officers and an education plan incorporating military training in all high schools of the country. Chávez demanded an explanation for the meaning of the cartoon and suggested that Zapata had been paid to draw it. Zapata responded by drawing another cartoon which asked Chávez, [...] "Hugo Rafael, <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>were</b> <b>you</b> paid to promote the cartoon?"

The third question that asked to express through a phrase, a verse of a poem, the words of a song, a title of a film, a pleasant activity or an art masterpiece produced a series of materials that have been used for formative purpose...|$|E

To be written up and turned in next week: The Dragon/Quantum case As Morton indicates, there are at least two matters that Fears has overlooked in making his argument. First of all, Quantum, which has fought off a succession of challenges, is likely to be concerned with the cost of different competitive strategies, while Dragon, which is concerned with survival, is focusing only on the probability of success. Second, Dragon finds itself in a stronger financial position than Quantum has reason to expect.
