5|$|There {{are obvious}} {{connections}} {{in the design of}} the Slaying of Holofernes and the Slaying of Haman at the opposite end of the chapel. Although in the Holofernes picture the figures are smaller and the space less filled, both have the triangular space divided into two zones by a vertical wall, allowing us to see what <b>is</b> <b>happening</b> <b>on</b> both sides of it. There are actually three scenes in the Haman picture because as well as seeing Haman punished, we see him at the table with Esther and the King and get a view of the King on his bed. Mordechai sits on the steps, making a link between the scenes.|$|E

25|$|The Poles' {{resistance}} in Warsaw is a Jewish resistance. Only yids {{are capable of}} the blackmail of putting {{women and children in}} the front line, {{to take advantage of the}} Germans' sense of scruple. The Germans have no interest in the destruction of Romania. Only a pro-German government can save us... What <b>is</b> <b>happening</b> <b>on</b> the frontier with Bukovina is a scandal, because new waves of Jews are flooding into the country. Rather than a Romania again invaded by kikes, it would be better to have a German protectorate.|$|E

He claims the recording will capture their souls, and through looping they will relive that week forever and he will spend eternity with the woman he loves. Although Morel does not mention her by name, the fugitive is sure {{he is talking about}} Faustine.|$|E
25|$|In the law {{enforcement}} context, situation awareness involves keeping eyes and ears open and evaluating what <b>is</b> <b>happening</b> <b>on</b> {{the way to a}} specific task, remaining fully aware of one's surroundings during the commission of a task, and retaining one's awareness when exiting a specific task. Situational awareness in a {{law enforcement}} setting seeks to ensure that a police officer does not become focused and engrossed on a specific task or problem to the exclusion of being aware of approaching potential hazards or to the exclusion of being aware of other tasks of higher priority. Situational awareness is a 24/7 process and policy laid down in officer training.|$|E
500|$|Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club {{awarded the}} episode a [...] "B+", calling it [...] "one of those twisted Adventure Time stories that doesn’t give the viewer {{any time to}} catch up with all the weirdness that <b>is</b> <b>happening</b> <b>on</b> screen, and the general effect {{afterward}} is one of satisfied disorientation." [...] Sava applauded the fact that the episode delves into [...] "the demented relationship that develops between Ice King and his new wife", noting that while [...] "the writers could have easily depicted Ice King in a more unsympathetic light, ... the tragedy of the episode is that Ice King genuinely cares about his new wife." [...] He was also complimentary towards the song, describing it as a [...] "suitably bizarre Adventure Time version of 'A Whole New World'".|$|E

Those seen holding a mobile phone {{in a manner}} consistent with photography are considered to be suspicious for breaking this rule. This is another issue that is challenged in the courts in the United States as a [...] "Free Speech" [...] issue. [...] Almost all riders are equipped with cell phones which can take pictures or record what <b>is</b> <b>happening</b> <b>on</b> the lines. Riders are able to record the actions of transit police and transportation system employees.|$|E
2500|$|Since Mahagonny was co-produced by Brecht, {{there is}} a {{prominent}} display of the Verfremdungseffekt, often translated as the [...] "alienation effect". Brecht and Weill wished to replace the old dramatic theater and its emphasis on emotions with epic theatre and its emphasis on reason. In the case of Brecht, it was more as a didactic tool for communist philosophy, but for Weill, {{it was more of}} a social scheme, a way to get people involved and thinking. The general scheme was to shake up people's preconceived notions and make them think about what <b>is</b> <b>happening</b> <b>on</b> stage, or to emotionally distance the audience from the action thus making logical evaluation of the play's events easier. Brecht and Weill used different methods to achieve this effect.|$|E
2500|$|Warn {{said that}} the February 12, 2009 {{statements}} by Carruthers regarding Reese insulted the audience's intelligence. The statements were not supported by what the audience saw, she said. [...] "There is validity to the argument Carruthers is making — that there simply aren't enough romantic-pairing options for long-running lesbian characters unless you're willing to change the general makeup of the established cast of characters," [...] said Warn. [...] "This logic is frequently used by TV writers and showrunners to justify minimal lesbian visibility, bad lesbian storylines, and the growing trend towards adding bisexual characters to their shows instead of lesbians." [...] Warn said that while this may be an understandable decision for an individual show, when it <b>is</b> <b>happening</b> <b>on</b> various shows, the viewer is [...] "left with a television landscape populated by lesbians who sleep with men, or no lesbians at all, only bisexual characters (who also primarily sleep with men)" [...] and that All My Children [...] "fed right into" [...] this with the Reese and Bianca storyline.|$|E

2500|$|Zakaria self-identifies as a [...] "centrist", {{though he}} has been {{described}} variously as a political liberal, a conservative, a moderate, or a radical centrist. George Stephanopoulos said of him in 2003, [...] "He's so well versed in politics, and he can't be pigeonholed. I can't be sure whenever I turn to him where he's {{going to be coming}} from or what he's going to say." [...] Zakaria wrote in February 2008 that [...] "Conservatism grew powerful in the 1970s and 1980s because it proposed solutions appropriate to the problems of the age", adding that [...] "a new world requires new thinking". He supported Barack Obama during the 2008 Democratic primary campaign and also for president. In January 2009 Forbes referred to Zakaria as one of the 25 most influential liberals in the American media. Zakaria has stated that he tries not to be devoted to any type of ideology, saying [...] "I feel that's part of my job... which is not to pick sides but to explain what I think <b>is</b> <b>happening</b> <b>on</b> the ground. I can't say, 'This is my team and I'm going to root for them no matter what they do.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Shared {{situation}} awareness {{can be defined}} as [...] "the degree to which team members possess the same SA on shared SA requirements" [...] (Endsley & Jones, 1997, p.47; 2001, p.48). As implied by this definition, there are information requirements that are relevant to multiple team members. A major part of teamwork involves the area where these SA requirements overlap—the shared SA requirements that exist {{as a function of the}} essential interdependency of the team members. In a poorly functioning team, two or more members may have different assessments on these shared SA requirements and thus behave in an uncoordinated or even counter-productive fashion. Yet in a smoothly functioning team, each team member shares a common understanding of what <b>is</b> <b>happening</b> <b>on</b> those SA elements that are common—shared SA. Thus, shared SA refers to the overlap between the SA requirements of the team members, as presented in Figure 3. As depicted by the clear areas of the figure, not all information needs to be shared. Clearly, each team member is aware of much that is not pertinent to the others on the team. Sharing every detail of each person's job would only create a great deal of [...] "noise" [...] to sort through to get needed information. [...] It is only that information which is relevant to the SA requirements of each team member that is needed.|$|E

Jims is asleep in his crib and the wind is wailing around the window; over my desk hangs Walter's picture, {{looking at me with}} his {{beautiful}} deep eyes; the Mona Lisa he gave me the last Christmas he was home hangs on one side of it, and on the other a framed copy of [...] "The Piper." [...] It seems to me that I can hear Walter's voice repeating it--that little poem into which he put his soul, and which will therefore live for ever, carrying Walter's name on through the future of our land. Everything about me is calm and peaceful and 'homey.' Walter seems very near me--if I could just sweep aside the thin wavering little veil that hangs between, I could see him--just as he saw the Pied Piper the night before Courcelette.|$|E

The audience shake their fists at one another, and the Rhymer whispers to me, [...] "There are often duels after these performances," [...] and he explains to me what <b>is</b> <b>happening</b> <b>on</b> the stage. The players are supposed to be dolls, toys, marionettes, and now they are all hopping like wooden frogs, and I can see for myself that the chief personage, who is some kind of King, carries for Sceptre a brush of the kind that we use to clean a closet. Feeling bound to support the most spirited party, we have shouted for the play, but that night at the Hotel Corneille I am very sad, for comedy, objectivity, has displayed its growing power once more. I say, [...] "After Stephane Mallarmé, after Paul Verlaine, after Gustave Moreau, after Puvis de Chavannes, after our own verse, after all our subtle colour and nervous rhythm, after the faint mixed tints of Conder, what more is possible? After us the Savage God." ...|$|E
