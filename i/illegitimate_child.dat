In 1820, Beauchamp became disenchanted with Sharp when rumors surfaced that he had fathered an <b>illegitimate</b> <b>child</b> with Anna Cooke, a planter's daughter who lived in Bowling Green. Sharp denied paternity of the child, which was stillborn.|$|E
5|$|In {{research}} following Hitler's death, {{a variety}} of claims have been made about Hitler's sexual orientation: that he was gay, bisexual, or asexual. Conclusive evidence is lacking, but most historians believe he was heterosexual. There {{is at least one}} claim that Hitler had an <b>illegitimate</b> <b>child</b> (named Jean-Marie Loret) with one of his lovers. Mainstream historians, such as Ian Kershaw, dismiss this as unlikely or impossible.|$|E

40|$|Legal {{position}} of <b>illegitimate</b> <b>children</b> according to 19 th century Montenegrin legislature is {{examined in this}} paper. Provisions on personal rights, property rights and rights of succession of <b>illegitimate</b> <b>children</b> are presented and critically analyzed. Children {{born out of wedlock}} were not equal to children born in lawful marriage. Therefore, significance of legalization of <b>illegitimate</b> <b>children</b> regarding improvement of their legal status is accentuated. As non-marital relationships were condemned in patriarchal Montenegrin 19 th century society, <b>illegitimate</b> <b>children</b> were considered a product of sin and family disgrace. Hence, legislative attempts to protect their interests and improve their legal position are emphasized in this paper...|$|R

Laila, born a generation later, is comparatively privileged during her youth until their lives intersect and she is also forced to accept a marriage proposal from Rasheed, Mariam's husband.|$|E
5|$|In 1825, Sharp {{resigned}} {{to run for}} {{a seat in the}} Kentucky House of Representatives. During the heated campaign, opponents raised the issue of his alleged seduction of Anna Cooke. Old Court partisan John U. Waring had handbills distributed that alleged that Sharp had denied paternity of Cooke's <b>illegitimate</b> <b>child</b> because it was a mulatto and likely fathered by a Cooke family slave. Sharp won the election, defeating John J. Crittenden.|$|E
40|$|The {{specification}} of children into "legitimate children" and "illegitimate children" is well-known legally and socially. <b>Illegitimate</b> <b>children</b> suffer discrimination {{because of their}} status. In law, they only have their mothers and mother's family. Although {{there has been a}} Constitutional Court Decision No. 046 / PUU-VIII / 2010, but it does not automatically raise the dignity of <b>illegitimate</b> <b>children.</b> On the other hand Law No. 24 of 2014 has made the children who were not born from a marriage by religion lose their rights to be recognized. This paper was aimed to find the constitutional basis for the civil rights of <b>illegitimate</b> <b>children</b> as the basis to provide the civil rights for <b>illegitimate</b> <b>children</b> so that their civil rights are protected. The method used in this paper was normative. Based on the review, there is a constitutional basis to provide the protection to the civil rights of <b>illegitimate</b> <b>children...</b>|$|R

5|$|When Sharp campaigned in 1825 {{for a seat}} in the Kentucky House of Representatives, opponents {{revived the}} story of his alleged <b>illegitimate</b> <b>child</b> by Cooke.

In the early morning of November 7, 1825, he tricked Sharp to open the door at his home in Frankfort, and fatally stabbed him.|$|E
5|$|Gossip soon {{spread of}} the {{existence}} of an <b>illegitimate</b> <b>child.</b> Some historians contend that, sometime before August 1800 in Weymouth, Sophia gave birth to a child fathered by Garth. Flora Fraser believes the rumours that Sophia had a child, but has questioned whether the child was fathered by Garth, or Sophia's brother the Duke of Cumberland. Historians further write that the child, baptised Thomas Garth like his father, was raised by his father in Weymouth, where his mother would visit him occasionally. In 1828 he apparently tried to blackmail the royal family with certain incriminating documents from his father about his supposed parents' relationship, though this ended in failure.|$|E

5|$|Princess Victoria {{soon came}} to hate Conroy who bullied and insulted her, mocking her {{economical}} habits. Some historians have conjectured that Conroy's arrogant behaviour towards Victoria may have {{stemmed from a}} personal belief that his wife Elizabeth was secretly the <b>illegitimate</b> <b>child</b> of the Duke of Kent. While the rumour was later proven false, Conroy's strong ambition may have stemmed from this self-perceived connection to the aristocracy. Ambition {{may also have been}} influenced by Conroy's claim of descent from the ancient kings of Ireland. Regardless of his claims of grandeur, Conroy belonged to the middle class and recognised the growing power of this group within British society.|$|E
5|$|The Beauchamp–Sharp Tragedy (sometimes {{called the}} Kentucky Tragedy) was {{the murder of}} Kentucky {{legislator}} Solomon P. Sharp by Jereboam O. Beauchamp (bee-chum). As a young lawyer, Beauchamp had been an admirer of Sharp until Sharp allegedly fathered an <b>illegitimate</b> <b>child</b> with Anna Cooke, a planter's daughter. Sharp denied paternity of the stillborn child. Later, Beauchamp began a relationship with Cooke, who agreed to marry him {{on the condition that}} he kill Sharp to avenge her honor. Beauchamp and Cooke married in June 1824, and in the early morning of November 7, 1825, Beauchamp murdered Sharp at Sharp's home in Frankfort.|$|E
5|$|The {{allure of}} class respectability is another {{constant}} in Les Chouans, {{as it is}} for Balzac's entire oeuvre. Marie's birth as an <b>illegitimate</b> <b>child</b> contributes to her position {{at the start of the}} novel. The ups and downs of her young adult life land her in Corentin's hands, yearning for the 300,000-franc reward promised to her on the capture of Montauran. Marie's focus changes from money to marriage, a sign of hope amid the tragedy of circumstances. When she first considers Montauran, she recognizes that a return of the king would bring privileges; still, her oscillating actions follow the path of her passions, not rational self-interest.|$|E

5|$|The book did {{contain some}} inaccuracies, {{particularly}} those surrounding Savage's {{claim that he}} was the <b>illegitimate</b> <b>child</b> of a nobleman. It was successful in its partial analysis of Savage's poetry and in portraying insights into Savage's personality, but for all of its literary achievements it did not bring immediate fame or income to Johnson or to Cave; it did, though, provide Johnson with a welcome small income at an opportune time in his life. More importantly, the work helped to mould Johnson into a biographical career; it was included in his later Lives of the Most Eminent English Poets series.|$|E
5|$|Andjar {{became a}} writer for the {{theatrical}} troupe Dardanella in November 1930, working under the group's founder Willy A. Piedro. Andjar believed the troupe to be dedicated to the betterment of the toneel as an art form and not only motivated by financial interests, as were the earlier stambul troupes. He wrote and published many plays with the group's backing, including Dr Samsi and Singa Minangkabau (The Lion of Minangkabau). Andjar also worked as a theatre critic, writing several pieces on the history of local theatre, sometimes using his birth name and sometimes his pseudonym. In 1936 Andjar went with Dardanella to India to record a film adaptation of his drama Dr Samsi, which followed a doctor who was blackmailed after an unscrupulous Indo discovered he had an <b>illegitimate</b> <b>child.</b> The deal fell through, however, and Andjar left India with his wife Ratna.|$|E
5|$|Gallieni exiled Ranavalona from Madagascar on February 27, 1897, and officially {{abolished}} the monarchy the next day. French officials ordered the queen {{to leave her}} palace at 1:30 in the morning. She was carried from Antananarivo by palanquin as the city slept, accompanied by 700–800 escorts and porters. Throughout the days spent traveling to the eastern port of Toamasina where she would board a ship to Réunion, Ranavalona reportedly drank heavily, swigging rum directly from the bottle in an uncustomarily coarse fashion. At Toamasina on March 6, Ranavalona was notified that her sister Rasendranoro and aunt Ramasindrazana would be arriving shortly, as would the queen's fourteen-year-old niece, Razafinandriamanitra, who was nine months pregnant with the <b>illegitimate</b> <b>child</b> of a French soldier.|$|E

5|$|In 1820, rumors {{surfaced}} that Sharp had fathered a stillborn <b>illegitimate</b> <b>child</b> with Anna Cooke, a planter's daughter. Sharp {{denied the}} charge, and the immediate political effects were minimal. When {{the charges were}} repeated during Sharp's 1825 General Assembly campaign, opponents publicized the allegation {{that the child was}} a mulatto. Whether Sharp made such a claim, or whether it was a rumor started by his political enemies, remains in doubt. Jereboam Beauchamp, who had married Cooke in 1824, avenged the honor of his wife by fatally stabbing Sharp at his home early on the morning of November 7, 1825. Sharp's murder inspired fictional works, most notably Edgar Allan Poe's unfinished play Politian and Robert Penn Warren's novel World Enough and Time (1950).|$|E
5|$|Mary Shelley {{was born}} as Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin in Somers Town, London, in 1797. She {{was the second}} child of the feminist philosopher, educator, and writer Mary Wollstonecraft, and the first child of the philosopher, novelist, and {{journalist}} William Godwin. Wollstonecraft died of puerperal fever shortly after Mary was born. Godwin was left to bring up Mary, along with her older half-sister, Fanny Imlay, Wollstonecraft's child by the American speculator Gilbert Imlay. A year after Wollstonecraft's death, Godwin published his Memoirs of the Author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1798), which he intended as a sincere and compassionate tribute. However, because the Memoirs revealed Wollstonecraft's affairs and her <b>illegitimate</b> <b>child,</b> they were seen as shocking. Mary Godwin read these memoirs and her mother's books, and was brought up to cherish her mother's memory.|$|E
5|$|Prince Christian {{was given}} the title Prince of Denmark and his family {{moved into a new}} {{official}} residence, Bernstorff Palace. Although the family's status had risen, there was little or no increase in their income and they did not participate in court life at Copenhagen as they refused to meet Frederick's third wife and former mistress, Louise Rasmussen, because she had an <b>illegitimate</b> <b>child</b> by a previous lover. Alexandra shared a draughty attic bedroom with her sister, Dagmar (later Empress of Russia), made her own clothes and waited at table along with her sisters. Alexandra and Dagmar were given swimming lessons by the Swedish pioneer of women's swimming, Nancy Edberg. At Bernstorff, Alexandra grew into a young woman; she was taught English by the English chaplain at Copenhagen and was confirmed in Christiansborg Palace. She was devout throughout her life, and followed High Church practice.|$|E
