40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to improve the {{solubility}} of poorly soluble Carbamazepine by using solid dispersion technique utilizing common pharmaceutical polymers. The formulations were prepared with HPMC, PVP K 30, and poloxamer 407 as polymers and methanol as solvent. The formulations were characterized by differential scanning calorimetry, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, in vitro dissolution study by USP type <b>I</b> <b>apparatus,</b> and recrystallization study by optical microscopy. The dissolution profiles revealed that the drug and polymer ratio and the type of polymer both play critical role in solubility enhancement. The solid dispersions formulated with drug and poloxamer ratio of 1 : 1 showed highest dissolution rate. The formulations containing PVP did not show any endothermic peak of the drug unlike other formulations...|$|E
40|$|Ribosome {{synthesis}} {{depends on}} nutrient availability, sensed by {{the target of}} rapamycin (TOR) signaling pathway in eukaryotes. TOR inactivation affects ribosome biogenesis {{at the level of}} rRNA gene transcription, expression of ribosomal proteins (r-proteins) and biogenesis factors, preribosome processing, and transport. Here, we demonstrate that upon TOR inactivation, levels of newly synthesized ribosomal subunits drop drastically before the integrity of the RNA polymerase <b>I</b> <b>apparatus</b> is severely impaired but in good correlation with a sharp decrease in r-protein production. Inhibition of translation by cycloheximide mimics the rRNA maturation defect observed immediately after TOR inactivation. Both cycloheximide addition and the depletion of individual r-proteins also reproduce TOR-dependent nucleolar entrapment of specific ribosomal precursor complexes. We suggest that shortage of newly synthesized r-proteins after short-term TOR inactivation is sufficient to explain most of the observed effects on ribosome production...|$|E

40|$|Purpose Hydrophilic {{derivatives}} {{of cellulose}} ethers (methylcellulose, MC and hypromellose, HPMC) {{are employed in}} controlled drug delivery polymeric devices because of their potential to control drug release profiles. Mechanistically, hydration and erosion (dissolution) of polymeric chains are the fundamental parameters that determine the rate of drug release. The aim of this work was to study the hydration and erosion properties of MC and HPMC, applying the Vergnaud model and a phenol-sulphuric acid assay respectively. The impact of different physicochemical properties (particle size, substitution levels and molecular size) was also investigated. Methods A gravimetrical method was employed for studying swelling of MC and HPMC matrices using pH 7. 2 phosphate buffer (20 ml) as a hydration medium and hydration kinetics were analysed using Vergnaud model. The erosion of matrices was studied using USP <b>I</b> <b>apparatus</b> (pH 7. 2 phosphate buffer, 900 ml) at 37 °C and 100 rpm. The amount of dissolved polymer was quantified by application of a phenol-sulphuric acid (PSA) assay. Results The increased polymer molecular weight and substitution level of hydroxypropoxy groups led to higher swelling rate ranges between 41. 01 to 89. 74 (...|$|E
40|$|Rectal suppositories of {{tramadol}} hydrochloride {{were prepared}} using different bases and polymers like PEG, cocoa butter, agar {{and the effect}} of different additives on in vitro release of tramadol hydrochloride was studied. The agar-based suppositories were non-disintegrating/non-dissolving, whereas PEGs were disintegrating/dissolving and cocoa butter were melting suppositories. All the prepared suppositories were evaluated for various physical parameters like weight variation, drug content and hardness. The PEG and cocoa butter suppositories were evaluated for macromelting range, disintegration and liquefaction time. In vitro release study was performed by USP type <b>I</b> <b>apparatus.</b> The prepared suppositories were within the permissible range of all physical parameters. In vitro drug release was in the order of PEG>Agar>cocoa butter. Addition of PVP, HPMC in agar suppositories retards the release. The mechanism of drug release was diffusion controlled and follows first order kinetics. The results suggested that blends of PEG of low molecular weight (1000) with high molecular weight (4000 and 6000) in different percentage and agar in 10 % w/w as base used to formulate rapid release suppositories. The sustained release suppositories can be prepared by addition of PVP, HPMC in agar-based suppositories and by use of cocoa butter as base...|$|E

Dissolution test was performed using a TDT- 06 T dissolution apparatus. Based on the physiological conditions of the body, 0. 1 N hydrochloric acid was used as dissolution medium and release was monitored for 2 hours to verify the immediate release pattern of the drug in acidic pH, followed by pH 6. 8 in citric-phosphate buffer for 22 hours, to simulate a sustained release pattern in the intestine. Influences of rotation speed and surfactant concentration in medium were evaluated. Samples were analysed by validated UV visible spectrophotometric method at 286 nm. 1 % sodium lauryl sulphate (SLS) {{was found to be}} optimum for improving carvedilol solubility in pH 6. 8 citric-phosphate buffer.

40|$|A {{system has}} been {{developed}} {{for the analysis of}} 24 -h urine collections for sodium, potassium, calcium, phosphate, urea, and creatinine, using a six channel AutoAnalyzer for the analysis, and a computer for calculating the results and producing cumulative reports. The rapidly rising number of requests for the estimation of urine electrolytes, calcium, phosphate, and creatinine, particularly on patients undergoing haemodialysis or on immunosuppressive therapy, has made essential the development of multiple automated analysis for these constituents. This paper describes a multichannel urine analyser, with an account of the technical problems encountered, and presents the approximate normal ranges estab-lished with its use. The minimum basic requirements for a 'urine profile ' were considered to be the estimation of sodium, potassium, urea, phosphate, calcium, and creatinine, simultaneously on an undiluted urine sample at reasonable speed and without the need for a multiplicity of tedious calculations. The apparatus employed was AutoAnalyzer (Technicon Instruments Corporation) Mark <b>I</b> <b>apparatus</b> previously used for the routine estimation of serum electrolytes. Naturally other laboratories might not have avail-able exactly the same configuration of old equipment, in which case the Analyzer could easily be modified to cope with fewer or different chemistries.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of carrying out}} this research work {{was to investigate the}} effect of chirality on stereospecific dissolution of omeprazole enantiomers from various marketed racemic omeprazole products. Omeprazole is used for the treatment of gastro-duodenal ulcers and symptomatic gastro-oesophageal reflux. Dissolution of various marketed products was performed using USP type <b>I</b> <b>apparatus</b> in 0. 1 N HCl for 2 h and in pH 6. 8 phosphate buffer for 1 h at 100 rpm. The separation of enantiomers was done using a chiral HPLC method on CHIRAL AGP column (100 x 4. 6 mm i. d.). The wavelength for UV detection was set at 210 nm. The mobile phase was 10 mM phosphate buffer with 5 % acetonitrile adjusted to pH 6. 5 at a flow rate of 0. 9 ml min- 1 with an injector valve fitted to a 50 &# 956;L volume sample loop. The retention times for R and S enantiomers of omeprazole were 5 and 7. 5 min, respectively. The dissolution of S enantiomer of Ocid- 20 and Omee was found to be significantly more compared to their R enantiomer at 5 and 10 min dissolution time points after which there was no stereospecific discrimination in the dissolution. From the S/R ratios of different racemic omeprazole marketed products it was concluded that at 5 and 10 min dissolution time points there was a stereospecific drug release between the S and R enantiomers with the brands Ocid- 20 and Omee (p &# 60; 0. 05) but no stereospecificity was observed with Omez- 20 (p &# 62; 0. 05) ...|$|E
