25|$|As I {{walked down}} {{at this place}} I was walled on both sides by those {{inaccessible}} high rocky barren hills which hang over one’s head in some places and appear very terrible; and from them springs many little currents {{of water from the}} sides and clefts which trickle down to some lower part where it runs swiftly over the stones and shelves in the way, which makes a pleasant rush and murmuring noise and like a snowball is increased by each spring trickling down on either side of those hills, and so descends into the bottoms which are a Moorish ground in which in many places the waters stand, and so form some of those Lakes as it <b>did</b> <b>here.</b>|$|E

500|$|Gillian Anderson was {{particularly}} {{pleased with the}} episode showing a different side of Scully and said, [...] "I {{thought it was a}} great idea. I personally was going through a dark period at the time, and I wanted to explore Scully's dark side. For some reason, Glen and Jim were on the same wavelength that week. Afterward, a lot of people told me that on that episode I was so 'unlike' Scully or that 'it showed my range'. I told them I thought they were wrong. I don't think that what I <b>did</b> <b>here</b> was out of character for Scully. The only thing different is that the audience hadn't seen it before." [...] Initially, Anderson called up Morgan and asked him to write a story wherein Scully [...] "fall hard" [...] for another man, which leads to an [...] "intense kind of romantic or passionate relationship". Morgan obliged and wrote a scene where Scully enjoys a passionate night with Jerse. This was later removed from the script by series creator Chris Carter, the only time in Glen Morgan's tenure on the show where a scene of his was removed by Carter. Morgan later noted [...] "I think Chris thought that I was monkeying around with him, but I really wasn't." ...|$|E

2500|$|The University of Virginia Student Activities Fund (SAF) {{constituted}} a limited public forum, albeit [...] "more in a metaphysical sense {{than in a}} spatial or geographic sense", yet [...] "By the very terms of the SAF prohibition, the University does not exclude religion as a subject matter, but selects for disfavored treatment those student journalistic efforts with religious editorial viewpoints. Religion may be a vast area of inquiry, but it also provides, as it <b>did</b> <b>here,</b> a specific premise, a perspective, a standpoint from which a variety of subjects may be discussed and considered. The prohibited perspective, not the general subject matter, resulted in the refusal to make third-party payments, for the subjects discussed were otherwise within the approved category of publications".|$|E
2500|$|The Kenyan {{government}} sent {{a letter}} to Hague insisting that the UK government was legally liable for the atrocities. The Foreign Office, however, reaffirmed its position that it was not, in fact, liable for colonial atrocities, and argued that the documents had not [...] "disappeared" [...] as part of a cover up. Nearly ten years before, in late 2002, as the BBC aired a damning documentary on British crimes committed during the rebellion and 6,000 depositions had been taken for the legal case, former district colonial officer John Nottingham had expressed concern that compensation be paid soon, since most victims were in their 80s and would soon pass away. He told the BBC: [...] "What went on in the Kenya camps and villages was brutal, savage torture. It is time that the mockery of justice that was perpetrated in this country at that time, should be, must be righted. I feel ashamed to have come from a Britain that did what it <b>did</b> <b>here</b> [...]" ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{decision}} to shoot in Vancouver, {{where the first}} five years of The X-Files had been filmed and produced before the series had moved to Los Angeles, was an early idea; one that seemed right to both Chris Carter and David Duchovny. According to Duchovny, [...] "It all makes sense. You know, when Chris and I first talked about doing this movie, we kind of unconsciously both said, 'You know, I guess it should be in Vancouver, it really should be,' and it just felt like you know, almost superstitiously like the right thing to do." [...] Filming in Vancouver also facilitated the return of many former crew members who had previously worked on The X-Files, as well as individuals who had worked on the other series that Ten Thirteen Productions had created. Frank Spotnitz said that [...] "In terms of making of the movie, we've brought together as many people as we can, not just from The X-Files but from all the shows that we <b>did</b> <b>here</b> in Vancouver – Harsh Realm, Millennium and The Lone Gunmen – and our crew is populated with all these faces that we'd worked with, over the past fifteen years. And there's even some people from the L.A. crew." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Mishnah {{interpreted}} the words [...] "Neither shall he multiply wives to himself" [...] in [...] to limit him {{to no more}} than 18 wives. Judah said that he could have more wives, provided that they did not turn away his heart. But Simeon said that he must not marry even one wife who would turn away his heart. The Mishnah concluded that [...] prohibited the king from marrying more than 18 wives, even if they were all as righteous as Abigail the wife of David.. The Gemara noted that Judah did not always employ the rationale behind a Biblical passage as a basis for limiting its legal effect, as he <b>did</b> <b>here</b> in [...] The Gemara explained that Rabbi Judah employed the rationale behind the law here because [...] itself expounds the rationale behind its legal constraint: The reason behind the command, [...] "he shall not multiply wives to himself," [...] is so [...] "that his heart be not turned aside." [...] Thus Rabbi Judah reasoned that [...] itself restricts the law to these conditions, and a king could have more wives if [...] "his heart be not turned aside." [...] The Gemara noted that Simeon did not always interpret a Biblical passage strictly by its plain meaning, as he appeared to do here in [...] The Gemara explained that Simeon could have reasoned that [...] adds the words, [...] "that his heart turn not away," [...] to imply that the king must not marry even a single wife who might turn away his heart. And one could interpret the words [...] "he shall not multiply" [...] to mean that the king must not marry many wives even if they, like Abigail, would never turn away his heart. The Gemara then analyzed how the anonymous first view in [...] came to its conclusion that the king could have no more than 18 wives. The Gemara noted that [...] refers to the children of six of David's wives born to David in Hebron. The Gemara reasoned that the prophet Nathan referred to these six wives in [...] when he said, [...] "And if that were too little, then would I add to you the like of these, and the like of these," [...] each [...] "these" [...] implying six more wives. Thus with the original six, these two additions of six would make 18 in all.|$|E
