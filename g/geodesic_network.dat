The informatics solution of the visibility between two points uses the concept of ”visibility rectangle”, meaning a mathematical solution put into an informatics support of the problem ”when does a point belong to the visibility rectangle?”. This problem will be solved by comparing the surfaces of the visibility rectangle to the sum of surfaces formed by a point with the sides of this rectangle.

40|$|The Brownian map is {{a random}} {{geodesic}} metric space arising as the scaling limit of random planar maps. We strengthen the so-called confluence of geodesics phenomenon observed {{at the root}} of the map, and with this, reveal several properties of its rich geodesic structure. Our main result is the continuity of the cut locus at typical points. A small shift from such a point results in a small, local modification to the cut locus. Moreover, the cut locus is uniformly stable, in the sense that any two cut loci coincide outside a closed, nowhere dense set of zero measure. We obtain similar stability results for the set of points inside geodesics to a fixed point. Furthermore, we show that the set of points inside geodesics of the map is of first Baire category. Hence, most points in the Brownian map are endpoints. Finally, we classify the types of <b>geodesic</b> <b>networks</b> which are dense. For each k∈{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9 }, there is a dense set of pairs of points which are joined by networks of exactly k geodesics and of a specific topological form.

Thus, this network (designated as initial state or zero state in the following content) is transformed to an ellipsoidal <b>geodesic</b> <b>network</b> by scaling in x, y, and z directions with factors of 15 / 15, 11 / 15, and 12 / 15, respectively (designated as first state).

Firstly, a <b>geodesic</b> <b>network</b> is generated for each face with geodesics and iso-geodesics determined and these network points are adopted as the correspondence across face models.

Finally, correlation coefficients according to these metrics are computed, respectively, as the similarity measures between two 3 D face models. Experiments of different persons’ 3 D facial models and different 3 D facial models of the same person are implemented and compared with a subjective face similarity study.

30|$|Betweenness {{centrality}} and closeness centrality are distance measures [40]. Betweenness centrality {{measures the}} extent to which a node mediates relationships between other nodes by its position along the <b>geodesics</b> within the <b>network.</b> A <b>geodesic</b> is the shortest path (or number of degrees) connecting a dyad (a pair of nodes). The greater a node is located along the <b>geodesics</b> in the <b>network,</b> the greater its betweenness centrality. This measure essentially represents the ability of some nodes to control the flow of connectivity (or communication, in this case) within a network. Controlling the flow within the network in this indirect manner is the broker’s edge. Closeness centrality is also based on geodesic paths, but unlike betweenness centrality which accounts for mediation within these paths, closeness measures {{the extent to}} which a node is in proximity to others. This measure is essentially a calculation of the mean geodesic distance between a node and all other reachable nodes in the network.|$|R

A network was implanted with stations in 21 places in the State of Paraná {{and one in the}} state of São Paulo To reduce the risk of the losing of points of that gravity network, they were established on the points of the GPS High Precision Network of Paraná, which possess a relatively homogeneous geographical distribution. For each one of the gravity lines belonging to the loops implanted for the network, it was possible to obtain three or six observations. In the first strategy, of adjustment investigated, for the net, it was considered, as observation, the medium value of the observations obtained for each gravity line. In the second strategy, of the adjustment, the observations were considered independent.

30|$|An {{effective}} form-finding {{method for}} form-fixed spatial network structures {{is presented in}} this paper. The adaptive form-finding method is introduced along with the example of designing an ellipsoidal network dome with bar length variations being as small as possible. A typical spherical <b>geodesic</b> <b>network</b> is selected as an initial state, having bar lengths in a limit group number. Next, this network is transformed into the ellipsoidal shape as desired by applying compressions on bars according to the bar length variations caused by transformation. Afterwards, the dynamic relaxation method is employed to explicitly integrate the node positions by applying residual forces. During the form-finding process, the boundary condition of constraining nodes on the ellipsoid surface is innovatively considered as reactions on the normal direction of the surface at node positions, which are balanced with {{the components of the}} nodal forces in a reverse direction induced by compressions on bars. The node positions are also corrected according to the fixed-form condition in each explicit iteration step. In the serial results of time history, the optimal solution is found from a time history of states by properly choosing convergence criteria, and the presented form-finding procedure is proved to be applicable for form-fixed problems.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{examine the}} {{medication}} advice-seeking network {{of staff in}} a hospital ward. Methods: Social network analysis {{was carried out in}} a renal ward of an Australian metropolitan teaching hospital. The medication advice-seeking interactions of doctors, nurses, allied health professionals (including a pharmacist) and a ward clerk were examined using data from questionnaires administered to staff. The questionnaire listed all staff who worked in the ward and sought information from respondents regarding their interactions with each staff member. Data were analysed using social network software, UCINET. Analyses performed included <b>geodesic</b> distance, <b>network</b> density, strength of ties, reciprocation of relations, and centrality of individuals. NetDraw was used to produce social network diagrams. Results: A very high response rate of 96 % was achieved with 45 of 47 staff returning the questionnaire. On average, there is little interaction between each of the staff members in the medication advice-seeking network, with even less interaction between staff from different professional groups. Nurses are mainly located {{on one side of the}} network and doctors on the other. However, the pharmacist is quite central in the medication advice-seeking network as are some senior nurses and a junior doctor. Conclusions: When hospital clinical staff seek medication advice from other members of a ward it tends to be sought from those in their profession. However key individuals in the ward are relied upon for the provision of medication advice by staff from all professions. Social network analysis can be used to examine the complex medication advice-seeking interactions amongst staff in a hospital ward, providing useful quantitative baseline data against which to compare the effect of interventions, such as an electronic medication system, on interactions. 10 page(s...|$|R

Data from the amount of frozen juice produced and exported, international price of orange juice, and intermediate transactions were assessed in order to make possible selection of all interveners involved in the chain. The study using the Social Network Analysis (SNA) showed that the densest relationships in the network are from exporters to importers and from orange growers to the orange processing industry. No difference was found in the values of the <b>network</b> <b>geodesic</b> distance or the clustering coefficients from 2005 to 2009.
