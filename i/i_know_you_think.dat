500|$|Throughout his term, Scott was {{dogged by}} rumors of heavy {{drinking}} and {{frequent use of}} profanity. On one occasion, an unnamed individual believed his reputation had been injured by something Scott had said and challenged him to a duel. He ignored the challenge, after which the challenger threatened to expose him as a coward. Scott {{was supposed to have}} replied, [...] "Post and be damned; but if you do, you will only post yourself a damned liar, and everybody else will say so." [...] On another occasion, after reviewing a speech written for him by Bledsoe, the governor was said to have remarked, [...] "Well, Mr. Bledsoe, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> you are a damned sight smarter than I am, and so you are in many respects; but this message as it is now, won't do at all; I'll be damned if it will." [...] When Bledsoe asked what was wrong with the speech, he reportedly replied, [...] "Why, damn it to hell, why don't you put a good solemn prayer at the end of it, and talk about Providence, and the protection of Heaven, and all that?" [...] After the governor campaigned for Humphrey Marshall's opponent in the 1809 legislative elections, Marshall published an article in the Western World newspaper that accused him of appearing in front of the court house drunk on election day.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, Captain Rule, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> so and say so--but I {{set down}} all these matters as {{somewhat}} various and onaccountable." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{you don't}} love boats like I do, and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> I'm making {{a fool of}} myself. But some day I'm going to sail the Martha again. I know it. I know it." ...|$|E
60|$|BARNABAS. <b>I</b> understand. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you.</b> <b>You</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> {{are one of}} them.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, there isn't anything. But--thank <b>you.</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> always <b>think</b> of me, and that's worlds. When are {{you coming}} up again?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not even then, Harry. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> will <b>think</b> {{better of}} this, when your generous nature {{has time to}} reason with your heart, on my account." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{shall have}} to go; but I'm bound {{to tell the truth}} now, 'cause <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> I was tryin' to steal somethin' when we were only goin' to run away so's you wouldn't know what I've done." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How cold {{you are to}} me. But I suppose I {{must put}} up with that. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> you {{have reason to be}} displeased with us all. Poor Bertie; if you knew all, you would not be angry with him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, Mother, dear, I'm sure he will," [...] and {{replaced}} the fillet. A patient, half-sad, half-quizzical smile visited Frances Freeland's lips, as who should say: 'Yes, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that I'm a fuss-box, {{but it really}} is a pity that you wear it so, darling!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, <b>I</b> <b>know.</b> <b>You</b> mustn't <b>think</b> me {{so stupid}} as all that. It is a mortifying truth that I like you, {{and that you}} have no use for me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> what <b>you</b> <b>think,</b> Dick-- and I {{think the}} same-- that {{that man was}} the one who aided Crabtree to escape from jail," [...] said Sam.|$|R
6000|$|... “Well—no. Not as a rule. The {{effect is}} forcible without being clear. [...] . <b>I</b> <b>know</b> that <b>you</b> <b>think</b> it’s {{because of my}} solitary manner of life away there.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Laverick," [...] he said, [...] "old man, you're wrong. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> I've {{been led}} away. I've taken {{you out of}} our depth, but the only trouble has been that we haven't had enough capital, and no backing. Those who stand up will win. They will make money." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You're very good," [...] I {{answered}} disconsolately, [...] "but all {{the same}} {{the fact remains that}} I have behaved disgracefully to you, and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> so. Oh, Mr. Sinclair, please, please, go away. I feel so miserably ashamed of myself that I cannot look you in the face." ...|$|E
60|$|Nour. Your sullen silence cheats not me, false man; <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> {{the bloodiest}} things you can. Could you accuse me, you would raise your voice, Watch for my crimes, {{and in my}} guilt rejoice: But my known virtue is from scandal free, And leaves no shadow for your calumny.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nay, now, Cousin Florence," [...] said Edward, [...] "you are {{a girl of}} {{moderately}} good sense, {{with all}} your nonsense. Now don't <b>you</b> (<b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> do) <b>think</b> just so too?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You do comfort me. If <b>I</b> <b>know</b> that <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> {{am doing}} right, that will comfort {{me more than}} anything. Absolute and {{immediate}} comfort {{is not to be}} had when one is sorrowful." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> don't <b>know</b> if <b>you</b> <b>think</b> you're putting Mr. and Mrs. Appleby {{at their}} ease, Arthur.|$|R
6000|$|... "Never mind. Go on. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that I {{have brought}} {{it all on}} myself by my own wickedness. Pay this man the money, and then if {{anything}} be said about it, explain {{that it was my}} fault, and say that you paid the money because I had done wrong." ...|$|E
6000|$|PATIOMKIN. Psha! <b>I</b> <b>know.</b> <b>You</b> <b>think</b> if {{she once}} sets eyes {{on your face}} and your uniform your fortune is made. You think that if she could stand a man like me, with only one eye, and a cross eye at that, she must fall down at your feet at first sight, eh? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Neither do I. She has no fixed character. No girl has. Nobody has. We {{all have}} twenty {{different}} characters--more characters than gowns--and {{we put them}} on and take them off just as often for different occasions. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> each person is permanently this or that; but my experience is that half the time they're the other thing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> don't <b>think</b> it!" [...] {{she cried}} fondly. She had now {{let him take}} her hand, and he stood holding it at arm's-length. Effie Bowen came into the room. [...] "Good-bye," [...] said Imogene, with an instant {{assumption}} of society manner.|$|R
6000|$|... "I suppose that's so," [...] said Miss Duncan, thoughtfully, [...] "only you're {{very clever}} {{to have seen}} it. Now that <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> a more {{remarkable}} person than ever. You don't seem at all like a country girl, and you don't talk like one." ...|$|R
60|$|LOUIS. Yes, <b>you</b> have. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> what <b>you</b> all <b>think</b> of me. Dont imagine I'm sore about it. I forgive you.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not in earnest!" [...] he cried, {{starting}} up and confronting me fiercely, with wild eyes and quickened breath. [...] "Not in earnest! You think I'm not in earnest too. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> it, though {{you tell me}} you don't. Stop; before we say another word, your own eyes shall convince you. Come here--only for a minute--only for one minute!" ...|$|E
6000|$|He promised, however, that {{he would}} go down to Hampton {{immediately}} after the marriage, and he sent his kindest love to Linda and Katie. 'And, dear Mrs. Woodward,' said he, 'I know you think me very harsh, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> me vindictive--but pray, pray believe that I understand all your love, and acknowledge all your goodness. The time will, perhaps, come when we shall be as happy together as we once were.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And {{you will}} not think about it, either, will you? <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of {{weaknesses}} in me after I am out of your sight; and not knowing what they are, I cannot combat them. I almost wish you were of a grosser nature, Harry; in truth I do! Or rather, I wish I could have the advantages such a nature in you would afford me, and yet have you as you are.' ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{came toward}} her, and then stood faltering. A faint smile quivered {{over her face}} at the {{spectacle}} of his subjection. [...] "Sit down, Mr. Corey," [...] she said. [...] "There's no reason why we shouldn't talk it over quietly; for <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> will <b>think</b> I'm right." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> all <b>think</b> me prejudiced. I do {{not want}} you to go away {{misunderstanding}} me,' answered Theodora. 'She has good principles, she is amiable and affectionate; but there are three points that prevent me from esteeming her as you do. She has a weak fretful temper.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>you</b> would <b>think</b> it no good news, {{and it is}} just a thunder-clap to me. All {{you wanted}} me for was to defend the mother and make up to the charity, and now there's no use in me," [...] he said in a disconsolate tone.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>I</b> <b>know.</b> <b>You</b> <b>think</b> {{the idea}} is a mad one, but you {{have never been in}} love yet. When you are you will know that lovers do not believe in the word `impossible.' At any rate, I mean to give Inez the chance of {{determining}} her own fate. If she is ready to risk everything rather than marry Don Philip, I am ready to share the risk whatever it may be." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know, father, dear," [...] she answered, {{her eyes}} filling with tears; [...] "we must trust to Providence, I suppose. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> me very selfish," [...] she went on, {{catching}} {{him by the}} arm, [...] "but, oh, father! {{there are things that}} are worse than death to women, or, at least, to some women. I almost think that I would rather die than marry Edward Cossey, though I should have gone through with it if he had kept his word." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dignity!" [...] he cried, laughing; [...] "when did {{you ever}} see me trouble my head about my dignity? It is you, Miss Lucy, who are 'digne.' How often, in your high insular presence, have I taken a {{pleasure}} in trampling upon, what you are pleased to call, my dignity; tearing it, scattering it to the winds, in those mad transports you witness with such hauteur, and which <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> very like the ravings of a third-rate London actor." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No; but <b>you</b> <b>think</b> I kept Bonita {{up in the}} mountains, that I went {{secretly}} to meet her, {{that all}} the while I served <b>you</b> <b>I</b> was--Oh, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> what <b>you</b> <b>think!</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> now. <b>I</b> never <b>knew</b> till <b>I</b> made <b>you</b> look at me. Now, say it! Speak!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, <b>I</b> don't <b>know.</b> Should <b>you</b> <b>think</b> so?" [...] he returned, with a {{smile that}} out-measured the morsels on the plate before her.|$|R
6000|$|... "P.S. It is impossible--but I am horribly afraid it's true. I'm {{happy and}} wretched and scared. HE can NEVER care for me, <b>I</b> <b>know.</b> Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> could ever {{develop into a}} {{passable}} minister's wife, Anne? And WOULD they expect me to lead in prayer? P G." ...|$|R
