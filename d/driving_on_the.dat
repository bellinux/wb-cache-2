5|$|British {{cultural}} {{influence on}} the island is evident in its use of English as the main language and the British pound as its primary currency. Additional cultural commonalities include <b>driving</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> left, access to the BBC and ITV regions, a school curriculum following that of England, and the popularity of British sports, including football, cricket and rugby.|$|E
5|$|Gordon led on the lap-38 restart, {{followed}} by Truex and Burton. One lap later, Burton, with assistance from Johnson, passed Gordon for the lead. Kenseth claimed first position on lap 40 after <b>driving</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> outside lane. Vickers followed Johnson {{on the inside}} line to reclaim the lead on the following lap, before Sadler passed Vickers around the outside for the lead on the 44th lap. On lap 45, Mears led after passing Sadler, and debris was located on the backstretch, triggering a second caution. All drivers, including Mears, elected to make pit stops. Sadler reclaimed first position and led the field back up to speed at the lap-49 restart, ahead of Mears and Kyle Busch. Hamlin and Kyle Busch led the cars <b>driving</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> outside lane, with Busch claiming the lead on lap 51, pulling away {{from the rest of}} the field. Kurt Busch, with help from Vickers, got ahead of Kyle Busch to move into first place.|$|E

5|$|On 26 September 2010, Norgrove {{and three}} Afghan colleagues were {{travelling}} in the Chawkay District (also known as Tsawkay and Sawkay) of eastern Kunar Province {{when they were}} kidnapped by local insurgents. They were ambushed whilst <b>driving</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> main highway from Jalalabad to Asadabad, in the Dewagal valley, in two unarmoured, unmarked Toyota Corollas. A US military convoy was ambushed two months earlier on the same stretch of road. Norgrove wore a burqa to disguise her foreign appearance.|$|E
5|$|The beach of Weston Bay lies on {{the western}} edge of the town. The upper part is sandy, but the sea retreats a long way at low tide, exposing large areas of mud flats (hence the colloquial name of Weston-super-Mud). The tidal range in this part of the Bristol Channel is great, and since beach and mud flats are on a gentle slope, it is inadvisable to try to reach the sea at low tide, as the sand gives way to deep mud which has often {{resulted}} in loss of life over the years. <b>Driving</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> beach is permitted in certain areas, but occasionally the drivers are caught unawares as they drive too close to the sea and break through the sand into the underlying mud, and are then stuck.|$|E
25|$|For {{countries}} <b>driving</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> left, {{the convention}} stipulates that the traffic signs should be mirror images of {{those used in}} countries <b>driving</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> right. This practice, however, is not systematically followed in the four European countries <b>driving</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> left, Cyprus, Malta, the Republic of Ireland, and the United Kingdom. The convention permits the use of two background colours for danger and prohibition signs: white or yellow. Most countries use white, with a few – such as Finland, Iceland, Poland, and Sweden – opting for yellow as this tends to improve the winter-time visibility of signs in areas where snow is prevalent. In some countries, such as France, white is the normal background colour for such signs, but yellow is used for temporary signage (as, for example, at road works).|$|E

25|$|The network grew {{saturated}} {{during the}} 1950s. Outdated technology limited {{the number of}} trains, which led the RATP to stop extending lines and concentrate on modernisation. The MP51 prototype was built, testing both rubber-tyred metro and basic automatic <b>driving</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> voie navette. The first replacements of the older Sprague trains began with experimental articulated trains and then with mainstream rubber-tyred metro MP55 and MP59, some of the latter still in service (line 11). Thanks to newer trains and better signalling, trains ran more frequently.|$|E
