40|$|ROCKEDBY THE MOUNTING {{shock waves}} of the {{explosion}} of the material and service expectations of the library user, the practitioners of interlibrary loan in the traditional manner are digging in behind their policies. As a consequence, one of the most important, implied obligations of the library-providing the most effective access to information-is slighted, as the borrower will not and cannot borrow and the lenders will not <b>lend.</b> <b>Interlibrary</b> loan is a technique by which one library lends material indirectly to an individual through another library. In essence, therefore, it is merely a means through which a library may broaden its lending service to include those materials which are made available by other libraries. The technique of interlibrary loan, of necessity, entails a lending operation, but regardless of where the actual work is performed-circulation, acquisitions, etc. -the principle involved is one of reference: that is, to provide the library user as completely as is possible with the material he needs. As a library activity, interlibrary loan should not be viewed as constant and unchanging but rather as a manifestation of a principle existing along the continuum of library development. To write a documented history of interlibrary loan would be extremely difficult; while it might add a certain historical prestige to trace its development back to a traffic in clay tablets or incunabula, and to indicate variations in the purposes and techniques of the transactions, the principle was the same then as it is today. The purposes for which one library will make available its material to another library, the scope of what materials are made available, and the techniques by which materials are made available are reflections of the society itself, when viewed against the totality of the social environment.

The analysis focuses on the small subset of nineteen consistently collected data variables (out of 656 variables collected during {{the history of the}} survey) to provide a general picture of the growth and changing dimensions of services and resources provided by academic health sciences libraries over those two and one-half decades. The paper also analyzes survey response patterns for U. S. and Canadian medical school libraries, as well as osteopathic medical school libraries surveyed since 1987. The trends show steady, but not dramatic, increases in annual means for total volumes collected, expenditures for staff, collections and other operating costs, personnel numbers and salaries, <b>interlibrary</b> <b>lending</b> and borrowing, reference questions, and service hours. However, when controlled for inflation, most categories of expenditure have just managed to stay level.
