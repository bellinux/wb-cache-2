2500|$|Nash {{made his}} Test debut for the West Indies on 11 December 2008, playing against New Zealand. In the same match, fast-bowler Lionel Baker also made his debut. It was widely {{reported}} in the media {{that he was the}} first white man to play for the West Indies since Geoff Greenidge played five Tests in the early 1970s. He was subjected to racial abuse for being a [...] "white boy" [...] during trials for Jamaica. Chris Gayle, Jamaica's captain, helped Nash telling him that [...] "You are one of us, don't worry about what anyone's saying to you. If anyone troubles you, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> you." [...] It later emerged that he was of mixed race. He took his first Test wicket in the third Test against England when Matt Prior was caught by Shivnarine Chanderpaul off Nash's bowling. During the fifth Test in Trinidad Nash scored his maiden Test century, his innings of 109 included 17 fours. He shared a 234-run fifth wicket partnership with Chanderpaul. Nash continued his good form in the first Test against England with 81 during a 143-run partnership with Denesh Ramdin who made 61.|$|E

5000|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> just a moment, David B. Smith Gallery, Denver, CO ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{afraid you}} wouldn't like it so well," [...] said Colville. [...] "I wish <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> the first time. There's {{nothing like the}} first time in everything." ...|$|R
6000|$|Miss Graham {{looked at}} him dubiously, but pursued with ardour: [...] "Why, just getting back to Florence, after not having <b>been</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> so long--I should {{think it would be}} so romantic. Oh dear! <b>I</b> wish <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> the second time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, sir," [...] said Jeanie; [...] "as <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> nae ill, I canna {{take the}} shame of hiding mysell frae {{the master of the}} house." ...|$|E
6000|$|PRINCE PAUL. No, to Paris. He has confiscated my estates, robbed me of {{my office}} and my cook. I have nothing left but my decorations. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> revenge.[5] ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It is my misfortune,' he replied, 'to be here, wholly {{against my}} will, {{for such a}} purpose. Allow {{me to say that}} <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> two purposes. That is one.' ...|$|E
6000|$|The vaquero crossed {{himself in}} stupefied alarm. [...] "I know not, your reverence; {{it is only}} two years ago, before the rodeo, that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> strayed colts, and I swear by the blessed bones of San Antonio that it <b>was</b> as <b>I</b> said." ...|$|R
6000|$|Then {{he studied}} {{the first of the}} {{markings}} and asked: [...] "What <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>here</b> <b>for?</b> What <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>here</b> <b>for?</b> Does he who sits upon the Throne desire to know how long he has to reign?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Kindly {{keep your}} 'ands {{off the new}} arm-rack." [...] Foxy {{wrestled}} with a turbulent crowd in the gymnasium. [...] "Nor it won't do even a condemned Snider any good to be continual snappin' the lock, Mr. Swayne.--Yiss, the uniforms will come later, when we're more proficient; at present we will confine ourselves to drill. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>'ere</b> <b>for</b> the purpose o' takin' the names o' those willin' to join.--Put down that Snider, Muster Hogan!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank {{you very}} much," [...] Tavernake replied. [...] "I {{do not know}} how long I shall be in New York. If <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> a few days, I shall take my chance at finding you at home." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What! That boy? Not {{want to look}} at {{the only}} {{sensible}} girl for miles around? What do you think <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>here</b> <b>for,</b> my dear--my dear--my dear?... What? You wait. You just wait. You'll see to-morrow. I'll soon--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are very}} kind," [...] he said, [...] "but {{you can hardly}} think how I want to be off. However, I fear that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> a week, at the very least. Just think what I am missing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I shall {{think about}} that; <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>here</b> only <b>for</b> {{three or four}} days," [...] said Ransom, smiling as men smile when they are {{perfectly}} unsatisfactory.|$|R
6000|$|... "I have Craig {{here in the}} Professor's garage, locked up. If our [...] {{plan has}} succeeded, come at once. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> waiting <b>here</b> <b>for</b> you." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>am</b> settled <b>here</b> <b>for</b> a {{month at}} least--and shall be very thankful for Susie notes, when they cross the Alps to me in these lovely days.|$|R
6000|$|... "I presume, Alice," [...] said Parker, {{satisfied}} with the impression he had made, [...] "that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> much the same reason as you are--to enjoy the morning in proper style. As for Rozinante, I borrowed him. Is that chestnut yours? Excuse the rudeness of the question." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah! {{but that}} I may not tell you," [...] she interrupted, {{turning away from}} the window. [...] "Of myself just now I say nothing--only of you. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> a day or two. It is through me that you have {{suffered}} this humiliation. I wanted to know just how far it went. Is there anything I can do?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Right!" [...] he said. [...] "So far as I am concerned, {{you shall}} be Mr. Andrew, fisherman. Will you also kindly {{remember}} {{that if any}} curiosity is evinced as to my identity, I am Mr. Berners, and that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> a rest-cure. By the by, {{how are you going}} to explain that elderly domestic of yours?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I took a {{vacation}} when I bought," [...] he explained, [...] "and planted the trees. Then I {{went back to}} work an' stayed with it till the place <b>was</b> cleared. Now <b>I</b> <b>'m</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> keeps, an' soon as the house is finished I'll send for the wife. She's not very well, and it will do her good. We've been planning and working for years {{to get away from the}} city." [...] He stopped in order to give a happy sigh. [...] "And now we're free." ...|$|R
2500|$|Biographer Robertson-Lorant's cites [...] "Lizzie's adventurous {{spirit and}} {{abundant}} energy," [...] and {{she suggests that}} [...] "her pluck and good humor might have been what attracted Melville to her, and vice versa." [...] An example of such good humor appears in a letter about her not yet used to being married: [...] "It seems sometimes exactly as if <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> a visit. The illusion is quite dispelled however when Herman stalks into my room without even the ceremony of knocking, bringing me perhaps a button to sew on, or some equally romantic occupation." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I've {{left it in}} the bottom, {{about half}} a mile back. I stepped on in front to make sure of the way, as 'tis night-time, and <b>I</b> han't <b>been</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> so long." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You need have no fear," [...] he told her. [...] "With politics--I have finished. Why I am here, what <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> I {{will tell}} you very soon. It is to find one whom I have lost--and who is dear to me. Forgive me if for to-day I say no more. Come, if you will you shall drive me to my hotel." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{need n't}} tell me; I know {{it better than}} you. I haven't a word to say against her; only she is stupid and hasn't any perceptions. If I am {{stopping}} a bit in London you don't understand why; it's {{as if you had}} n't any perceptions either! If <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> a few days, I know what I am about." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, then," [...] said Mr. Beam, [...] "I {{know you}} are not the man to allow trifles to {{stand in the way of}} {{important}} movements. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> a purpose, a great purpose, with which you will be in entire sympathy. I will say at once, frankly and openly, that my object is the improvement of Lethbury. I have a project which--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Is he alive? Is he <b>here?</b> <b>I</b> should <b>be</b> {{glad to see}} him again; and indeed, I {{missed him}} sorely. <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> two years, having been {{appointed}} to a command among the troops here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All of them, or none of them, as you will, though, Man, it <b>is</b> true that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> sent <b>here</b> <b>for</b> vengeance. Ask the Wizard yonder. He knows, and I {{give him}} leave to say." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course I will. Perhaps that <b>is</b> what <b>I</b> <b>was</b> sent <b>here</b> <b>for.</b> <b>I</b> {{will ask}} her of my aunt, and I {{think she will}} let me have her. You will keep her secret, Anne." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There are reasons," [...] said Beth, slowly, [...] "why {{your name}} is seldom {{mentioned}} in my father's family. Until your letter came I scarcely knew I possessed an aunt. It was your desire we should become better acquainted, and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> that purpose. I hope we shall become friends, Aunt Jane, but until then, it is better we should not discuss the past." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{is little}} fear of that," [...] he said. [...] "The papers are {{of no use}} except to us and to England. To England, I will admit that the foreknowledge of what is to come would be worth much, {{although}} the eventful result would be the same. It is for that reason that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>here,</b> <b>for</b> that reason that I have made you this offer." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{they don't}} hold their heads high enough. I am not for strikes that {{finish with a}} {{shilling}} a week more for the men; or for Acts of Parliament which dole out tardy charity. I am for the bigger things. Last night I lay awake, thinking--your friend Richard Graveling set me thinking. We must aim high. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> no man's individual good. I am here to plan not pinpricks but destruction." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And yet {{you would}} have me go in a fine {{carriage}} to Silverbridge, as though to a wedding. If <b>I</b> <b>am</b> wanted there let them take me as they would another. <b>I</b> shall <b>be</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> them,--unless <b>I</b> <b>am</b> dead." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not--not Miss de la Molle?" [...] he said nervously, adding, [...] "I had the {{pleasure}} of seeing her once, a good many years ago, when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> stopping <b>here</b> <b>for</b> a few days with my aunt." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, Sahib. I hired {{a little}} house. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{dressed as a}} trader. <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> two months, but I could not find where you <b>were</b> confined, {{although}} <b>I</b> have tried all means, until I saw your cap." ...|$|R
