5|$|On July 6, 2016, Turtle Rock {{announced}} that the game was transitioning to become a free-to-play game under the title Evolve: Stage 2 due to the game downloadable content controversy and mixed critical reception. The new version introduces new changes, including longer respawn time, non-ranked queue for casual players, and changes to hunters' abilities. Turtle Rock also promised that patches would be released more frequently and that most items featured in the game would be unlocked through simply playing the game. The alpha version of Stage 2 would begin on July 7, 2016, for PC, and {{will be followed by}} a beta in August in the same year. Players who purchased the game will be given the Founders status, which gives them exclusive cosmetic items. In October 2016, Turtle Rock {{announced that}} they would <b>end</b> <b>support</b> for Evolve, and that Evolve: Stage 2 would not be released for consoles, but servers for the game will remain online for ‘foreseeable future’. Turtle Rock also revealed that it was 2K's decision to end the game's support.|$|E

25|$|The {{segments}} {{of each of}} the two deck spans will be retained in compression during a severe earthquake by post-tensioned internal tendons joining the extreme end caps, carried internally in cable trays. These tendons are required since the eastern <b>end</b> <b>support</b> is both much lighter than the western counterweight and the soil conditions are radically different at each end, the western end being founded in bedrock shale while the eastern end, with vertical supports driven to bedrock, is mostly contained within softer mud deposits, which respond much more actively to seismic shocks than does the shale. The intent is that the combination of the tensioned tendons and the compressive roadbed box structure will keep the two end caps in the same relative position.|$|E
25|$|LucasArts {{released}} an Xbox-exclusive playable demo on the Star Wars Trilogy DVD set. The demo included one level, the Battle of Endor. The game released on September 21, 2004, {{the same day}} as the Trilogy DVD set. In late 2004, Pandemic Studios released unsupported mod tools for Microsoft Windows, allowing players to create their own maps, as well as edit the weapons and characters for all sides in the game. This release is not supported by Lucasarts. A number of communities now exist solely based around creating maps and characters using these tools, and uploading them for others to download. Aspyr was contracted to port the game to Macintosh systems; it was released in July 2005 for Mac OS. On November 1, 2005, mobile developer Mikoishi and publisher THQ released Star Wars Battlefront Mobile for cellular phones.

500|$|Plans for a 16-bit {{successor}} to the Game Gear were made to bring Sega's handheld gaming into the fifth generation of video games, but a new handheld system never materialized for Sega, leaving only the Genesis Nomad, a portable version of the Genesis, to take its place. Moreover, the Nomad was intended to supplement the Game Gear rather than replace it; in press coverage {{leading up to the}} Nomad's release, Sega representatives said the company was not dropping support for the Game Gear in favor of the Nomad, and that [...] "We believe the two can co-exist".

My first thought was how this attempt at satire must have been enormously difficult and painful for my mother." [...] He continued, [...] "The depiction of Terri in the Family Guy episode on March 21 is not only inaccurate, it seems to take the position that certain people are simply not worthy of receiving medical care because they are viewed as burdens {{on the health care}} system." [...] In addition, Schindler has also stated that he hopes to soon enlist the aid of other advocacy groups to protest the episode, [...] "and perhaps see some sponsors <b>end</b> <b>support</b> of the show." [...] Other pro-life activists, including Jill Stanek, wrote of the opening, [...] "Last night's episode of Family Guy opened with a truly shocking scene [...] This is the same television series that had an abortion episode canceled in August 2009.

500|$|Criticism has befallen Sega's {{management}} regarding {{both the}} creation and handling of the Saturn.

Bernie Stolar has also been criticized for his decision to <b>end</b> <b>support</b> for the Saturn. According to Fahs, [...] "Stolar's decision to abandon the Saturn made him a villain to many Sega fans, but... it was better to regroup than to enter the next fight battered and bruised. Dreamcast would be Stolar's redemption." [...] Stolar has defended his decision, stating, [...] "I felt Saturn was hurting the company more than helping it. That was a battle that we weren't going to win." [...] Sheffield stated that the Saturn's use of quadrilaterals undermined third-party support for the system, but because [...] "nVidia invested in quads" [...] at the same time there is [...] "a remote possibility" [...] they could have [...] "become the standard instead of triangles"—"if somehow, magically, the Saturn were the most popular console of that era." [...] Speaking more positively of the system, former Working Designs president Victor Ireland described the Saturn as [...] "the start of the future of console gaming" [...] because it [...] "got the better developers thinking and designing with parallel-processing architecture in mind for the first time". Writing for GamesRadar, Justin Towell noted that the Saturn's 3D Pad [...] "set the template for every successful controller that followed, with analog shoulder triggers and left thumbstick... I don't see any three-pronged controllers around the office these days." ...|$|E

500|$|Kulwicki {{started his}} rookie season in 1986 with Terry. After Terry decided to <b>end</b> <b>support</b> for his racing team mid-season, Kulwicki fielded his own team. He started out as {{essentially}} a one-man team {{in a time when}} other teams had dozens of people in supporting roles. Initially the driver, owner, crew chief, and chief mechanic, Kulwicki had difficulty acquiring and keeping crew members because he found it difficult to trust them to do the job with the excellence that he demanded, and because he was hands on in the maintenance of racecars {{to the point of being}} a [...] "control freak". He sought out crew members who had owned their own racecars, believing they would understand what he was going through: working long hours and performing his own car maintenance with a very limited budget. Notable crew members include his crew chief, Paul Andrews, and future Cup crew chiefs, Tony Gibson and Brian Whitesell. Future crew chief and owner, Ray Evernham, lasted sixweeks with Kulwicki in 1992. Evernham later said, [...] "The man was a genius. There's no question. It's not a matter of people just feeling like he was a genius. That man was a genius. But his personality paid for that. He was very impatient, very straightforward, very cut-to-the-bone." [...] With onecar, twoengines, and twofull-time crew members, Kulwicki won the 1986 Winston Cup Rookie of the Year award. He had competed in 23 of 29events, with fourtop10 finishes, three races not completed (DNF), an average finish of 15.4, and had only one result below 30th place.

The framework of earning XP and cash to purchase own vehicles and garage slots was a result of community criticism towards the previous framework in which the player had a ladder, laid out in advance by the game, to unlock cars. Feedback deemed the old approach too easy to complete. As for the extremely tight development schedule, involving less than twelve months, lead designer James Nicholls said: ...|$|E

Many cross-platform games — such as sports franchises released by Electronic Arts — were sold in numbers far below their PlayStation 2 and Xbox counterparts, eventually prompting some developers to scale back or completely cease support for the GameCube. Exceptions include Sega's family friendly Sonic Adventure 2 and Super Monkey Ball, which reportedly yielded more sales on GameCube {{than most of the}} company's games on the PlayStation 2 and Xbox.
