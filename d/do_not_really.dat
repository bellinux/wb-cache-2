25|$|Most IOL power {{formulas}} use the axial {{length and}} keratometric reading (K) {{to predict the}} position of the IOL postoperatively (ELP).

In order to address this problem the double-K method was developed, which uses the pre-LASIK corneal power for the calculation of the ELP, and the post-LASIK corneal power for the calculation of the Vergence component of the formula.|$|E

500|$|River {{dolphins}} {{are relatively}} small compared to other dolphins, having evolved to survive in warm, shallow water and strong river currents. They {{range in size from}} the [...] long South Asian river dolphin to the [...] and [...] Amazon river dolphin. Several species exhibit sexual dimorphism, in that the males are larger than the females. They have streamlined bodies and two limbs that are modified into flippers. River dolphins use their conical-shaped teeth and long beaks to capture fast-moving prey in murky water. They have well-developed hearing that is adapted for both air and water; they <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>really</b> rely on vision since the water they swim in is usually very muddy. These species are well-adapted to living in warm, shallow waters, and, unlike other cetaceans, have little to no blubber.|$|E

500|$|Before meeting Beyoncé, Rich Harrison had {{conceptualized}} {{the beat}} of the song. He had sampled the hook's instrumentation from the 1970 song [...] "Are You My Woman? (Tell Me So)," [...] which had originally been written and composed by Eugene Record, frontman of the Chicago-based vocal group The Chi-Lites. When Harrison first played the beat to his friends, they could not [...] "dig it," [...] and this made him realize that he had conceived something special, which people would appreciate better after hearing the whole record. Thus Harrison decided not to market the selection, and instead, he waited for the right artist to record it: [...] "I had it in the chamber, I had not really shopped it much, because sometimes {{you do not want to}} come out of the bag before it's right. People <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>really</b> get it and you will leave them with a foul taste in their mouth." ...|$|E

500|$|The most {{commonly}} given {{answer is that}} we attribute consciousness to other people because we see that they resemble us in appearance and behavior; we reason that if they look like us and act like us, they must be like us in other ways, including having experiences {{of the sort that}} we do. [...] There are, however, a variety of problems with that explanation. [...] For one thing, it seems to violate the principle of parsimony, by postulating an invisible entity that is not necessary to explain what we observe. [...] Some philosophers, such as Daniel Dennett in an essay titled The Unimagined Preposterousness of Zombies, argue that people who give this explanation <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>really</b> understand what they are saying. [...] More broadly, philosophers who do not accept the possibility of zombies generally believe that consciousness is reflected in behavior (including verbal behavior), and that we attribute consciousness on the basis of behavior. [...] A more straightforward way of saying this is that we attribute experiences to people because of what they can do, including the fact that they can tell us about their experiences.|$|E
500|$|Desiring a {{realistic}} depiction of vulpine behavior and habits, Mannix {{spent more than}} a year studying the behaviors of a mated pair of foxes that he kept at his home. He stated that they were [...] "so tame [...] could turn them loose and watch them hunt, fight, make love, and live an almost normal life." [...] Additionally, he studied wild foxes and interviewed trappers, hunters, game wardens, and [...] "Masters of Hounds" [...] to learn what they felt foxes would and would not do. In the novel's postscript, Mannix discusses this research. [...] To defend his novel against charges of improbability, he recounts his observations of wild foxes and discusses other people's stories about fox behavior. Regarding the actions Tod takes in eluding the hunters, he details both witnessing wild foxes performing such acts and stories others shared with him that he used as a basis for some of the story's events. For example, he notes that while people have told him that foxes <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>really</b> run among sheep or cattle herds to escape hounds, he himself used to watch them do just that from his bedroom window. In the case of a fox running along train tracks as a train is approaching, Mannix drew on a story told to him by a master of hunting in the area of Whitford Sales—near Thorndale, Pennsylvania—who had to stop hunting in the area because of a fox who consistently killed pursuing hounds on the Trenton Cutoff using this method.|$|E
500|$|According to Natalie Nichols of the Los Angeles Times, {{the lyrics}} of [...] "Crazy in Love" [...] {{reference}} a state of romantic obsession. Beyoncé said that the song talks [...] "about how, when you are falling in love, you {{do things that are}} out of character and you <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>really</b> care because you are just open." [...] Anthony DeCurtis of Rolling Stone wrote that [...] "Crazy in Love" [...] has [...] "such a cauldron of energy," [...] that Beyoncé sounds [...] "loose and sexy," [...] gripped by emotions she [...] "can neither understand nor control." [...] The lyrics are composed in the traditional verse-chorus form. Jay Z opens the song with a brief spoken verse-rap, containing the lyrics: [...] "Yes! So crazy right now. Most incredibly, it's your girl, B. It's your boy, Young. You ready?" [...] After Beyoncé delivers the [...] "uh-oh, uh-oh" [...] catchphrase, Jay Z continues the monologue. Beyoncé begins the first verse, followed with the whistle-backed chorus. She repeats the [...] "uh-oh, uh-oh" [...] phrase, leading to the second verse. The chorus follows, giving way to the second verse-rap which contains the lyrics: [...] "Jay Z in the range, crazy and deranged [...] I been inhaling the chain smokers, how you think I got the name 'Hova', I been real and the game's over". The song continues to the bridge, singing: [...] "I'm not myself, lately I'm foolish, I don't do this, / I've been playing myself, baby, I don't care / 'Cuz your love's got the best of me, / And baby, you're making a fool of me, / You got me sprung and I don't care who sees." [...] She then sings the chorus again and the song fades out with the horns.|$|E
