No influence of the <b>initial</b> <b>precipitation</b> state in the processed grain size was perceived. In fact, the processing conditions and the cooling rate determine the observed grain size.

Microstructural evolution during thermomechanical processing of several Al-Mg alloys was studied using backscattered orientation contrast imaging in the scanning electron microscope. The microstructural evolution in A 1 - 8 Mg- 0. 1 Zr was characterized in three phases: (a) in the <b>initial</b> stages, <b>precipitation</b> occurred on prior boundaries and microbands {{were observed in}} the grain interiors; (b) during intermediate stages, higher order microbands were observed and precipitates formed throughout the microstructure on both lower- and higher-order microbands; (c) in the final stages, equiaxed regions appeared around larger particles suggesting particle stimulated nucleation of recrystallization.

30|$|Foraminiferal {{regulation}} of Ca 2 + and CO 32 − uptake into calcareous tests are {{of great interest}} to scientists studying OA and its history. The calcareous foraminifera consist of two groups, porcelaneous (miliolid) and hyaline, according to their test structure. Porcelaneous species produce calcite in the form of needles with a length of a few μm in cellular vesicles (Parker 2017). The walls of these species exhibit an opaque appearance like porcelain. Hyaline species precipitate chamber walls extracellularly on primary organic sheets. These are constructed prior to calcification as a new chamber that provides nucleation sites for the <b>initial</b> calcite <b>precipitation</b> (as reviewed by Erez 2003). The crystallography of the porcelaneous and hyaline species differs from each other, as do their calcification pathways. The porcelaneous species have high Mg-calcite (Toyofuku et al. 2000; Maeda et al. 2017), whereas most hyaline species produce low Mg-calcite. The variability in Mg level can be explained by differences in the cytological pathway of Ca uptake (de Nooijer et al. 2009 a). Porceallaneous species form imperforate shells, whereas hyaline species form perforate shells (Ottway et al. 2018).|$|R

Authigenic glauconites, mostly of evolved type, formed within a back-barrier lagoonal environment. Foraminifera help constrain the biostratigraphy and along with sedimentological evidence, provide information on the depositional conditions. Glauconite in the Maniyara Fort Formation occurs either as infillings within intra-particle pores of larger foraminifers, or as an altered form of faecal pellets. X-Ray diffraction studies reveal the less mature nature of glauconite infillings compared to the glauconite pellets. Electron microprobe investigation confirms a relative enrichment of K 2 O and total Fe 2 O 3 in the latter. Both varieties of glauconite formed by <b>initial</b> authigenic <b>precipitation</b> of K-poor glauconite and subsequently matured by addition of potassium in the interlayer sites and fixation of total iron in the octahedral sites; calcium, magnesium and aluminum were released from the glauconite structure concomitantly.

X-ray diffraction analysis of the precipitated kaolinite showed no inter-layer expansion of glycerated, oriented samples. Random powder samples indicated a poor crystal-linity. The thermal stability of the precipitated material was indistinguishable from that of crystalline kaolinite. The electron microscope did not reveal any distinctive sizes or shapes. Equilibration behavior of several samples defined asingle kaolinite solubility line at or above which kaolinite apparently begins to precipitate.

The slow growth and highly crystalline nature of the Fe-oxide product may be partially due to the diffusion barrier formed by the growing oxide crystal mass which influenced rate of movement of HCOa- to the dissolved Fe phase and Fe ions and H + towards the calcite surface. Upon continued aging, the supernate became noticeably opaque. As the suspended nuclei settled, new surfaces for crystal growth were provided which resulted in somewhat less crystalline lepidocrocite and goethite...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Grain-coating {{chlorite}} cements commonly {{occur within}} sandstones of late Middle and Upper Miocene age {{deposited in the}} North Sumatra back-arc basin. Chlorites from the Lower Keutapang Member contain Ca (maximum 0. 75 wt % oxide) and show textural evidence for direct precipitation on grains. However, crystals are subhedral, showing curved faces and often ragged edges, and show a tendency to merge together. In overlying beds of the Upper Keutapang Member, grain-coating chlorite-smectite (20 % smectite) cements display an identical morphology but are more siliceous, have a lower octahedral occupancy and contain higher total (Na + Ca + K). It is proposed that chlorite cements in the Keutapang Formation originated as smectite-rich ement rims whose <b>initial</b> <b>precipitation</b> {{was related to the}} breakdown of volcanic detritus in the sediments.
