2500|$|Historically, Launceston was {{powered by}} {{gas from the}} Launceston Gas Company (later Gas Corporation of Tasmania). The first gas plant was built in 1860 as a <b>horizontal</b> <b>retort</b> Gas Works house made from brick and {{sandstone}} on the site's SW corner. This was followed by keepers cottages, labs, the Headquarters Building and the iconic 1930s vertical retort recognised by the wording [...] "COOK WITH GAS" [...] written in its brickwork. The Duck Reach Power Station replaced gas for street lighting when it was completed in 1895 (the first municipally owned power station in the Southern Hemisphere).

5000|$|The {{following}} is {{a brief history of}} the major manufacturing installations at Newstead since 1887. The first manufacture at Newstead in 1887 was in a retort house containing ten benches of manually operated <b>horizontal</b> <b>retorts.</b> Feedstock was Ipswich coking coal.

40|$|Rationale Coal tars are {{a mixture}} of organic and {{inorganic}} compounds and were by-products from the manufactured gas and coke making industries. Different manufacturing processes {{have resulted in the}} production of distinctly different tar compositions. This study presents a comprehensive database of compounds produced using two-dimensional gas chromatography combined with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GCxGC/TOFMS), analysing 16 tar samples produced by 5 distinct production processes. Methods Samples of coal tar were extracted using accelerated solvent extraction (ASE) and derivatized post extraction using N,O-Bis(trimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamide (BSTFA) with 1 % trimethylchlorosilane (TMCS). The derivatized samples were analysed using two-dimensional gas chromatography combined with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GCxGC/TOFMS). Results A total of 16 tar samples originating from 5 different production processes: Low Temperature <b>Horizontal</b> <b>Retorts,</b> <b>Horizontal</b> <b>Retorts,</b> Vertical Retorts, Carbureted Water Gas and Coke Ovens, were analysed. 2369 unique compounds were detected with 948 aromatic compounds, 196 aliphatic compounds, 380 sulphur-containing compounds, 209 oxygen-containing compounds, 262 nitrogen-containing compounds and 15 mixed heterocycles. Derivatization allowed the detection of 359 unique compounds, the majority in the form of hydroxylated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, many of which would not have been detected without derivatization. Of the 2369 unique compounds detected 173 compounds were found to be present within all samples. Conclusions A unique comprehensive database of compounds detected within 16 tar samples from 5 different production processes was produced. The 173 compounds identified within every sample may be of particular importance from a regulatory standpoint. This initial study indicates that different production processes produce tars with different chemical signatures and it can be further expanded upon by in-depth analysis of the different compound types. The number of compounds presented within this database clearly demonstrates the analytical power of GCxGC/TOFMS...|$|R
2500|$|The inter-war {{years were}} marked by the {{development}} of the continuous vertical retort which replaced many of the batch fed <b>horizontal</b> <b>retorts.</b> There were improvements in storage, especially the waterless gas holder, and distribution with the advent of 2–4inch steel pipes to convey gas at up to [...] as feeder mains compared to the traditional cast iron pipes working at an average of 2–3inches water gauge (500–750 Pa). Benzole as a vehicle fuel and coal tar as the main feedstock for the emerging organic chemical industry provided the gas industry with substantial revenues. Petroleum supplanted coal tar as the primary feedstock of the organic chemical industry after World War II and the loss of this market contributed to the economic problems of the gas industry after the war.|$|R
5000|$|Inside, {{the coal}} was {{transported to the}} top level where it was {{deposited}} in a long hopper at the top level of the building (which also contains the conveyor drive and water tank). From the hopper, the coal was fed via a single chute into the vertical retort block which was then divided into 8 separate retorts, where it was heated by furnaces (and later an additional steel furnace in the back room) located {{on the first floor}} (ground level). The extracted gas was collected in two parallel [...] "Collector Mains" [...] running {{along the top of the}} retort block. Accumulated tar and liquor was drained from the collector mains into a small liquor separating tank on the 3rd floor on the western side of the building. The collected gas was forced through the retort governor (recently removed for scrap) and into the foul main that runs down the back of the retort house where it was purified elsewhere on the site. Like the <b>Horizontal</b> <b>Retorts,</b> the Vertical Retort was run on Newcastle Coal imported from New South Wales. In the 1950s, modifications were made to the gasworks to allow the site to use Fingal Coal from the Fingal Valley in north east Tasmania.|$|R
50|$|At {{a public}} {{meeting at the}} Cornwall Hotel on the 18 May 1858, the Launceston Gas Company was formed. The company {{purchased}} a marshy paddock near Cimitier Street the same year due to its proximity to the North Esk River {{in order to build}} the new gasworks. Machinery from England and suitable builders were assembled in 1859 with the <b>Horizontal</b> <b>Retort</b> Buildings completed in early 1860. On the 5 April 1860, Launceston turned on its new gas street lighting {{for the first time and}} oil lamps were replaced by gas.|$|E
50|$|At the {{original}} plant {{it had made}} gas by coking coal in a <b>horizontal</b> <b>retort</b> and then capturing and storing the gas that was released. The new plant encased a brick retort, purifying house and two gas holders within the cylindrical buildings. The thick walls helped prevent the gas from condensing in the cold winters, and the conical roof accommodated the gasholder, a telescoping series of cylinders that rose within guides as the volume of gas increased. Water {{in the bottom of}} the pit made the seal impermeable.|$|E
5000|$|The Launceston Gasworks is {{a former}} {{industrial}} site located in the CBD of Launceston, Tasmania. The site was the principal supplier of gas to the City of Launceston before the importation of LPG in the 1970s. The gasworks produced gas by heating coal and siphoning off the gas that it released before refining and storing it on site {{in a set of}} 3, steel frame gasometers. The first buildings on site were the <b>horizontal</b> <b>retort</b> buildings built in 1860 from sandstone and local brick. The site was later used by Origin Energy as their Launceston LPG outlet. The site is instantly recognizable by its 1930s, steel braced, vertical retort building with the words [...] "COOK WITH GAS" [...] in the brickwork.|$|E
50|$|As {{artificial}} lighting became more common, desire grew {{for it to}} become readily available to the public. This was in part because towns became much safer places to travel around after gas lamps were installed in the streets, reducing crime rates. In 1809, accordingly, the first application was made to Parliament to incorporate a company in order to accelerate the process, but failed to pass. In 1810, however, the application was renewed by the same parties, and though some opposition was encountered and considerable expense incurred, the bill passed, but not without great alterations; and the London and Westminster Chartered Gas-Light and Coke Company was established. By 1816, Samuel Clegg obtained the patent for his <b>horizontal</b> rotative <b>retort,</b> his apparatus for purifying coal-gas with cream of lime, and for his rotative gas meter and self-acting governor.|$|R
5000|$|The pilot {{stage of}} the project {{consisted}} of underground room-and-pillar type oil shale mine and aboveground shale oil pilot plant with input capacity of 1,000 ton of oil shale per day which used TOSCO II <b>retort</b> a <b>horizontal</b> rotating kiln-type <b>retort</b> classified as a hot recycled solids technology. [...] Mining was conducted in a 60 ft-thick portion of the Mahogany Zone in the Parachute Creek Member of the Green River Formation at depths of 860 ft and 600 ft by a one-bench system. Pillar dimensions were 58 ft by 58 ft and rooms were 55 ft wide.|$|R
50|$|The Superior multimineral process (also {{known as}} the McDowell-Wellman process or {{circular}} grate process) is an above ground shale oil extraction technology designed for production of shale oil, a type of synthetic crude oil. The process heats oil shale in a sealed <b>horizontal</b> segmented vessel (<b>retort)</b> causing its decomposition into shale oil, oil shale gas and spent residue. The particularities {{of this process is}} a recovery of saline minerals from the oil shale, and a doughnut-shape of the retort. The process is suitable for processing of mineral-rich oil shales, such as in the Piceance Basin. It has a relatively high reliability and high oil yield. The technology was developed by the American oil company Superior Oil.|$|R

5000|$|Built {{from local}} brick with {{sandstone}} quoining and arches, the <b>Horizontal</b> <b>Retort</b> building was erected in 1860 {{and is one}} of the oldest buildings on site. The central portion of the building used to have a 39.3 m (129 ft) brick chimney and housed 18 retorts with room for an additional 6. On either side of the main building were two wings: the western one for the storage of coal imported form NSW and the other being a purifying house which also contained the [...] "smiths" [...] and gasfitters shops. A second coal store, located where the Carbureted Water Gas Building now stands, closely followed the same design. Gas produced in this building was stored in the 15 m (50 ft) diameter No.1 and No.2 Gasometers. The brick chimney was built by A Henderson with Francis and Miller being contracted to build the main building, all at a total cost of £3333. In 1929, this building was flooded to a depth of 4 ft during the great floods of 1929, after which damage was repaired quickly.|$|E
5000|$|Early European zinc {{production}} also {{took place in}} Silesia, in Carinthia, and in Liège, Belgium. In the Carinthian process, used in works established in 1798 by Bergrath Dillinger, a wood-fueled furnace heated {{a large number of}} small vertical retorts, [...] and zinc vapor then dropped through a ceramic pipe into a common condensation chamber below. This process was out of use by 1840. The Belgian and Silesian processes both used horizontal retorts. [...] In Silesia, Johann Ruhberg built a furnace to distill zinc in 1799, at first using pots but later changing to flat-bottomed retorts called [...] "muffles", attached to horizontal tubes bent downwards in which the zinc condensed. The Silesian process eventually merged with the Belgian process. This process, developed by Jean-Jacques Daniel Dony, was introduced 1805-1810, and used retorts with a cylindrical cross-section. [...] Condensers were horizontal clay tubes extending from the ends of the retorts. [...] The merged [...] "Belgo-Silesian" [...] <b>horizontal</b> <b>retort</b> process was widely adopted in Europe by the third quarter of the 19th century, and later in the United States.|$|E
5000|$|The TOSCO II {{process is}} {{classified}} as a hot recycled solids technology. [...] It employs a <b>horizontal</b> rotating kiln-type <b>retort.</b> In this process, oil shale is crushed smaller than 0.5 in and enters the system through pneumatic lift pipes in which oil shale is elevated by hot gas streams and preheated to about [...] [...] After entering into retort, oil shale is mixed with hot ceramic balls with temperature from [...] to [...] This increase the oil shale temperature to between [...] and , in which pyrolysis occurs. In the pyrolysis process, kerogen decomposes to oil shale gas and oil vapors, while {{the remainder of the}} oil shale forms spent shale. Vapors are transferred to a condensor (fractionator) for separation into various fractions. [...] At the kiln passage, the spent shale and the ceramic balls are separated in a perforated rotating separation drum (trommel). The crushed spent shale falls through holes in the trommel, while ceramic balls are transferred to the ball heater. Combustible shale gas is burned in the ball heater to reheat the ceramic balls.|$|R
50|$|Located on {{the south}} of the site {{bordering}} Cimitier Street, this small galvanized iron and timber building was used as the gaswork's distribution point. As {{with the rest of the}} southern half of the site, this building is in disrepair with all of its windows broken by vandals. Inside, most of the original machinery is still intact such as 2 miniature Braddock Gasometers which are largely intact and are ornately decorated. The miniature gasometer on the eastern side of the building is connected onto the inlet mains for the main Gasometers on site (from the point it leaves the purifiers in the <b>Horizontal</b> <b>Retort</b> Building), with the second being directly connected to the outlet mains between the Gasometers and the main governor. The main governor is located at the back of the building along with an exhauster and various meters and pressure gauges. The original governor was first installed in 1860 when the gasworks were first built and changed little since then though the building itself has been rebuilt. The governor originally distributed gas into 10 gas mains (2 large and 8 smaller) with the largest 2 just visible on the external surface of the building.|$|E
50|$|The {{gasworks}} have currently been partially {{developed as}} part of a large 3 part scheme costing $35 million. The first stage costing $8 million involving the restoration of the cottages on the north of the site {{as part of}} the new Centrelink complex has already been completed though the second and third stages were cancelled in 2008 due to the global financial crisis. The second stage was to involve the construction of {{a whole new set of}} buildings consisting of offices, retail outlets, restaurants, and apartments. These buildings were to be built on the south of the site facing Cimitier Street within the foundations of the gasometers as well as a free standing structure next to the Governor Cottage and a glass office building connecting the Vertical Retort House to the Carburetted Water Gas Building. As part of the second stage, the Governor Cottage and <b>Horizontal</b> <b>Retort</b> were meant to be restored to allow access to the general public. The third stage was disapproved by the Launceston Council but was to involve the development of the abandoned Origin Energy parking lot across Willis Street into more shops but has been converted into a public parking lot instead.|$|E
5000|$|The ATP is an {{above-ground}} oil-shale retorting technology {{classified as}} a hot recycled solids technology.

50|$|In June 2012 a {{proposal}} by developer Ross Harrison was put {{forward to the}} Launceston City Council to incorporate the Vertical Retort House and Carburetted Water Gas Building into a restaurant and bar with additional commercial space. In late July 2012, the site changed zoning from industrial to commercial and work commenced on cleaning {{the building of the}} accumulated pigeon droppings and polystyrene blocks that were dumped inside it. In mid-September removal of the Corrugated Asbestos Roofing started. On the 10 October 2012, the original 1932 machinery was blow-torched out of the building to be taken away followed by disassembly of the fire-brick retorts except for the coke extractors which were partially retained for aesthetic value. The completed works now link the two buildings with a glass atrium as the earlier proposal had intended. A bar and reception area are currently located on the 1st floor (ground level) of the Vertical Retort House under the former retort blocks with restaurant space occupying the area between the two buildings and into the Carburetted Water Gas Building. The upper levels of both buildings have been remodeled to support retail and office spaces. The machinery within the Vertical Retort House underwent a heritage survey to assess the historic value of the surviving equipment and from that, local architectural firm, ARTAS, was left to incorporate this into the final design. Removed machinery was intended to be kept as museum exhibits but has yet to be utilized for such purposes. At present all the machinery in the Vertical Retort has been removed except for a few components on the ground level and the waste heat boiler on the floors above, with salvaged components stored in the <b>Horizontal</b> <b>Retort</b> House.|$|E
40|$|Measurements of the {{concentration}} of 3 : 4 -benzpyrene and other polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons {{have been made in}} gas works retort houses of several types. The tarry fumes which escaped from retorts contained extremely high concentrations of polycyclic hydrocarbons, but in general men were only exposed to these very briefly. The mean concentration of 3 : 4 -benzpyrene determined from long-period samples at sites representative of normal working conditions in three works was 3 μg. /m. 3, over 100 times the normal level in the City of London. Above the retorts in an old <b>horizontal</b> <b>retort</b> house {{the concentration}} was over 200 μg. /m. 3, about 10, 000 times that in the City, and the `top-man' working there could be exposed to this in the normal course of his duty.

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a concept to utilise Carbon-dioxide for Steel-Making {{and would like}} to name it after the first author as OSRAM-CO$_ 2 $-SM process. We found in our lab {{experiments}} that the carbon content in high-carbon ferro-chrome metallic powders has come down from 7 % to 1 % when pure CO$_ 2 $ gas with partial pressure of 1 atmosphere is passed through a <b>horizontal</b> <b>retort</b> furnace maintained at 1100 $^o$ C for 24 hours. Our results clearly demonstrated that decarburisation can be very effective, when CO$_ 2 $ is used at temperatures where it is unstable and the Boudouard reaction which is endothermic in nature is more favoured. Based on these findings, we propose the OSRAM-CO$_ 2 $-SM process in which CO$_ 2 $ shall be used as the decarburising agent. CO$_ 2 $ is to be passed into a specially designed converter provided with heating mechanism to maintain the contents from blast furnace in a molten state for decarburisation of the melt. The out coming hot gases consisting of CO has to be burnt in a combustion chamber with stochiometric proportions of pure O$_ 2 $ to produce CO$_ 2 $ at a partial pressure close to 1 atm. The process will be extremely useful as it involves reuse and recycle of CO$_ 2 $ and in turn would reduce the overall amount of CO$_ 2 $ discharged into the atmosphere.

40|$|The {{performance}} of a new <b>horizontal</b> <b>retort</b> (Steriflow Standard 1 -Basket Model, Barriquand, Paris, France) was evaluated {{on the basis of}} temperature, heat and lethality distribution. Time-temperature data for these studies were obtained from bare thermocouples (type T), and rectangular bricks fabricated from Teflon$ sp{ rm TM}$ and Lexan$ sp{ rm TM}$ with thermocouples positioned at their geometrical centres. The effect of entrapped air on processing parameters for bricks packaged in retort pouches was determined using silicone rubber bricks (10 x 14. 5 x 2 cm), containing 5 thermocouples with their junctions positioned from the geometrical centre to near the top surface. The processing media employed were steam/air at two temperatures (121. 1 $ sp circ$C and 115. 6 $ sp circ$C) and two levels of superimposed air over-pressure, corresponding to 65 % and 75 % steam content. With the exception of the highest level of over-pressure (116 kPa), 60 ml of entrapped air caused the heating rate index (f$ sb{ rm h}$) to double. At low levels of air over-pressures, the slowest heating region (often assumed to be the geometrical centre) in the brick was shifted to a height equivalent to 3 / 4 of the brick thickness from the centre when the entrapped air volume was 60 ml. For similar conditions, the location receiving the least combined lethality during heating and cooling was near the top surface of the brick...|$|E
40|$|Personal {{computers}} (PC) {{and high}} level programming techniques have been developing so rapidly during last decade leading to {{new and exciting}} opportunities {{in the field of}} education. The purpose of this research was to develop food processing virtual labs as efficient teaching and study tools for food processing courses using user-friendly computer languages (VC++, MFC and OpenGL). A 3 D graphic technique was employed in this study as a specific objective to generate 3 D graphics in the visualization mode. According to functionalities, virtual labs were designed for three basic simulations: (1) Calculation simulations, which perform various calculations related to food processing. These simulations help users to remember and understand the formula used in process calculations. Several simple concept calculations were included: conduction heat transfer in steady state through individual and composite slabs; two-component mass balance systems, Pearson rule applications; freezing and thawing time calculations; (2) Animation simulations, which are aimed to visualize processing scenarios for different physical phenomena or working principles. Included in these simulations were: conduction heat transfer through single and multiple walls under steady state; mixing processes involving two and three component systems and Pearson rule concept; freezing and thawing processes through slab, cylinder, and sphere, the three regular shapes, agitation thermal processing modes which include axial agitation and end-over-end agitation in rotational retort; (3) Virtual equipment simulations, which are aimed to dynamically simulate a real operating environment and to demonstrate equipment working principle, internal structure, and operating procedures. The simulated equipment include a <b>horizontal</b> <b>retort</b> used in thermal processing and a high pressure processing equipment used in non-thermal processing. The food processing virtual labs provide a new way in teaching and learning, with no risk, time or place limitations, and are cost effective. The simulated scenarios and equipment can be used as teaching tools in food processing courses, which provide an efficient way to the instructor/assistant. Instructor/assistant can dynamically and repeatedly demonstrate the operating process for the simulated equipment in a vivid and interested manner. Also students can get intuitive understanding by viewing these simulations. Computers are the waves of the future; however, traditional learning techniques should not be forgotten. **This dissertation is a compound document (contains both a paper copy and a CD as part of the dissertation).
