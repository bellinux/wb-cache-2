5|$|Both Costello and Heffernan {{died before}} The Kangaroos were honored {{as the first}} tag team to <b>ever</b> <b>be</b> {{inducted}} into the Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame in 2003, which started a tradition of inducting a new team every year.|$|E

5|$|After the war, {{the number}} of {{supporters}} rose, and by the early 1960s this number had increased to highs of 12,000. Attendances began to fall {{towards the end of}} the 1960s; this trend continued through the 1970s, though the decade did give Tranmere its largest-ever crowd: 24,424 on 5 February 1972, for a fourth-round FA Cup match against Stoke City. With today's capacity of under 17,000, it is unlikely that this record attendance will <b>ever</b> <b>be</b> broken.|$|E

5|$|Costello officially {{retired from}} wrestling in 1983 but still {{made a few}} brief returns to the ring after that. In 1993, he managed The New Fabulous Kangaroos (Denny Kass and Al Snow) before {{retiring}} completely from the wrestling business. Both Costello and his tag team partner Heffernan died before Kangaroos were honored as the first tag team to <b>ever</b> <b>be</b> inducted into the Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame in 2003, which started a tradition of inducting a new team every year.|$|E
5|$|During the 1948 Revolt of the Admirals, {{a number}} of naval {{officers}} publicly disagreed with the administration's policy over cuts to naval aviation and amphibious warfare capability, resulting in the relief of the Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Louis Denfeld, and his replacement by Admiral Forrest Sherman. In testimony before the House Armed Services Committee investigation into the affair in October 1949, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Omar Bradley, doubted that there would <b>ever</b> <b>be</b> another large scale amphibious operation.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth Kocianski-Copeland (born November 24, 1980) is {{a retired}} American {{professional}} wrestler, better known by her ring name Beth Phoenix.

60|$|Good fellow! manly fellow! And {{he was so}} modest, too. There was no more self-assertion in the Minor Canon than in the schoolboy who {{had stood}} in the breezy playing-fields keeping a wicket. He was simply and staunchly true to his duty alike in the large case and in the small. So all true souls <b>ever</b> <b>are.</b> So every true soul <b>ever</b> <b>was,</b> <b>ever</b> <b>is,</b> and <b>ever</b> will <b>be.</b> There is nothing little to the really great in spirit.|$|R
60|$|Yes, Lily dear, {{it will be}} better, in {{the outcome}} of it, so, than if you were to hear all the talks that <b>ever</b> <b>were</b> talked, and all the stories that <b>ever</b> <b>were</b> told. Good night.|$|R
6000|$|There {{is nothing}} finer even in Shakespeare than that {{conception}} of the circle of rich men all pretending to rough it in the country, and the one really hungry man entering, sword in hand, and praising the city. [...] "If <b>ever</b> <b>been</b> where bells have knolled to church"; if you have <b>ever</b> <b>been</b> within sound of Bow bells; if you have <b>ever</b> <b>been</b> happy and haughty enough to call yourself a Cockney.|$|R
5|$|Francium-223 is {{the most}} stable isotope, with a {{half-life}} of 21.8minutes, and {{it is highly unlikely}} that an isotope of francium with a longer half-life will <b>ever</b> <b>be</b> discovered or synthesized. Francium-223 is the fifth product of the actinium decay series as the daughter isotope of actinium-227. Francium-223 then decays into radium-223 by beta decay (1149keV decay energy), with a minor (0.006%) alpha decay path to astatine-219 (5.4MeV decay energy).|$|E
5|$|From {{the very}} beginning, {{from the first}} moment I may almost say, of my {{acquaintance}} with you, your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others, were such as to form that the groundwork of disapprobation, on which succeeding events have built so immovable a dislike. And I had not known you a month before I felt {{that you were the}} last man in the world whom I could <b>ever</b> <b>be</b> prevailed on to marry.|$|E
5|$|In 1935, {{the palace}} {{including}} the entire estate {{was purchased by}} the City of Braunschweig. One condition for the purchase was that no structural changes <b>ever</b> <b>be</b> made and the park not be built on. The palace, which was rebuilt after the Second World War and reconstructed in 1987 to the historic original design, is now used for public events. The nearly four-hectare park has been {{open to the public}} since 1964.|$|E
6000|$|He {{was leaning}} towards her, {{whispering}} in her ear. The room was hotter {{than it had}} <b>ever</b> <b>been,</b> noisier than it had <b>ever</b> <b>been,</b> fuller than it had <b>ever</b> <b>been.</b> The bird on the roof was singing again and now she understood what it said. [...] "Take me out of this!" [...] Did anything matter except that? What did it matter how one was taken, or where, or by whom, so that one was taken.|$|R
5000|$|The wettest year {{on record}} was 2011 with 60.80" [...] while the driest year <b>ever</b> <b>was</b> 1963 with 27.42". The wettest month <b>ever</b> <b>was</b> June 1922 with 10.31" [...] while the driest month was November 1989 with no precipitation.|$|R
30|$|The most {{important}} {{finding was that}} the fastest women <b>ever</b> <b>were</b> faster than the fastest men <b>ever.</b> The differences <b>were</b> non-significantly when the three and the ten fastest women and men <b>ever</b> <b>were</b> compared. The difference became, however, highly significant when the swimming times of the annual fastest women and men were compared.|$|R
5|$|Later that year, she {{starred in}} Woody Allen's Vicky Cristina Barcelona as María Elena, a mentally {{unstable}} woman, which was praised. Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian praised Cruz's {{performance in the}} film. Cruz received a Goya Award and her first Academy Award and BAFTA Award for Best Supporting Actress. She also received a Golden Globe and SAG nomination. Cruz was the first Spanish actress to <b>ever</b> <b>be</b> awarded an Academy Award in that category and the sixth Hispanic person to ever receive the award.|$|E
5|$|Memories of {{more than}} a score of years of devoted service enhance the sense of {{personal}} loss which Miss LeHand's passing brings. Faithful and painstaking, with charm of manner inspired by tact and kindness of heart, she was utterly selfless in her devotion to duty. Hers was a quiet efficiency, which made her a real genius in getting things done. Her memory will <b>ever</b> <b>be</b> held in affectionate remembrance and appreciation, not only by all the members of our family but by the wide circle of those whose duties brought them into contact with her.|$|E
5|$|On the January 28, 2013, {{episode of}} Raw, Stratus was {{announced}} as a WWE Hall of Fame inductee {{as part of}} the 2013 class, which made her, at the time, the youngest person to <b>ever</b> <b>be</b> inducted. Stratus chose Stephanie McMahon to induct her into the Hall of Fame in April. That record has been broken by Beth Phoenix, who has been inducted in 2017 at age 36.|$|E

50|$|In 1969, <b>Evers</b> <b>was</b> named “Man of the Year” by the NAACP. In 1969, <b>Evers</b> <b>was</b> {{elected in}} Fayette, Mississippi {{as the first}} African-American mayor {{in the state in}} the post-Reconstruction era, {{following}} passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 which enforced constitutional rights for citizens. He unsuccessfully ran for governor in 1971 and the United States Senate in 1978, both times as an Independent candidate. In 1989, <b>Evers</b> <b>was</b> defeated for re-election after serving nearly twenty years as mayor.|$|R
5|$|Pedro Afonso's {{death from}} fever {{at the age}} of one devastated the Emperor, and the {{imperial}} couple had no further children. Pedro Afonso's older sister Dona Isabel became heiress, but PedroII was unconvinced that a woman could <b>ever</b> <b>be</b> accepted as monarch by the ruling elite. He excluded Isabel from matters of state and failed to provide training for her possible role as empress. With no surviving male children, the Emperor started to believe that the imperial line was destined to end with his own death.|$|E
5|$|Returning {{home from}} Belgrade on 6 February, the {{aeroplane}} carrying Edwards {{and his team}} mates crashed on takeoff after a refuelling stop in Munich, Germany. Seven players and 14 other passengers died at the scene, and Edwards {{was taken to the}} Rechts der Isar Hospital with multiple leg fractures, fractured ribs and severely damaged kidneys. The doctors treating him were confident that he stood some chance of recovery, but were doubtful that he would <b>ever</b> <b>be</b> able to play football again.|$|E
5|$|That {{shot was}} totally and {{completely}} inspired by 'Something's Got to Give,' Marilyn Monroe's last movie that never got finished. It's {{an homage to}} her, because I've never seen anyone re-create it. So many people have emulated so many of Marilyn's classic moments, but it's just that I'm {{a big fan of}} hers, and I thought it was really pretty at night with the pool. No one could <b>ever</b> <b>be</b> as fabulous as Marilyn was, but it's in honor and homage to her.|$|E

5|$|The {{historian}} John Hale {{considered the}} original castle {{to form a}} transitional design between older medieval English designs and the newer Italian styles of defence. The design of Deal, like its sister castles along the Downs, suffered from design problems: it needed too many guns to <b>ever</b> <b>be</b> fully equipped; its curved surfaces were vulnerable to attack; and despite attempts to keep the walls low and thick, its relatively high profile, driven by the requirement to support several tiers of defences, made it exposed to attack.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} {{competing}} hypotheses about the ultimate {{fate of the}} Universe and about what, if anything, preceded the Big Bang, while other physicists and philosophers refuse to speculate, doubting that information about prior states will <b>ever</b> <b>be</b> accessible. Some physicists have suggested various multiverse hypotheses, in which the Universe might be one among many universes that likewise exist.|$|E
5|$|Unforgiven (2004) was a {{professional}} wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) and presented by Clearasil, which took place on September 12, 2004, at the Rose Garden in Portland, Oregon. It was the sixth annual (seventh overall) Unforgiven event. The show's seven matches showcased prominent WWE wrestlers, who acted out the franchise's stories {{in and out of}} the ring. The event starred talent from the Raw brand. It is one of only two WWE pay-per-view events to <b>ever</b> <b>be</b> held in the state of Oregon, the other being No Mercy 2008.|$|E
