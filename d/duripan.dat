50|$|Duripans occur {{mostly in}} arid or {{semiarid}} climates, where {{the soil is}} usually dry or seasonally dry. Soils with duripans are often geographically associated with areas of volcanic activity, and show evidence of ash or volcanic glass deposition. Volcanic glass weathers rapidly, providing an ample supply of soluble silica to cement the underlying soil. Other common sources of the silica cementing agent are iron-magnesium minerals and feldspars. The parent material of <b>duripan</b> soils usually does not contain {{a large amount of}} calcium carbonate, and if there is an abundance of calcium, a Petrocalcic Horizon can form in conjunction with the <b>duripan.</b> The weathered silica is mostly transported by water into the subsoil, where it precipitates and forms microaggregates that gradually grow into a full-fledged <b>duripan.</b> It cannot be considered a <b>duripan</b> until the cracks and gaps that allow roots to penetrate are 10 cm or more apart. A <b>duripan</b> can sometimes be broken up by earthquakes or periods of alternate wetting and drying that cause small volume changes.|$|E
50|$|Vernal pools are shallow {{surficial}} depressions that seasonally {{fill with}} water during {{winter and spring}} rains and dry up during dry summer months.

Vernal pools form where an impermeable or very slowly permeable layer underlies small and shallow depressions and creates a perched water table. The impermeable or very slowly permeable layer typically consists of either soil horizons such as <b>duripans</b> or claypans or bedrock in the form of volcanic mud or lava flows.|$|R
40|$|Studies of soils in {{the northeastern}} region of Brazil showed the {{widespread}} occurrence of hard subsurface horizons that strongly restrict the penetration of plant roots, water and ploughing tools, and that consequently reduce the agricultural yields. The objective was to characterise the groundmass of these hard horizons and to identify the cementing agent responsible for the hardness. Samples were collected from friable subsoil horizons which are latosolic horizons, and from hard subsoil horizons which are either fragipã or duripã according to the Brazilian soil classification. The mechanical stability of the groundmass was measured. Thin-sections were prepared and examined in scanning electron microscopy using backscattered electrons. The thin sections were also used for microprobe analysis. The results showed a great stability of fragipã and duripã when they are shacked in water. This stability clearly indicated that they are indurated horizons and related to <b>duripans.</b> The results showed also that the groundmass of the indurated horizons differed from friable latosolic horizons by {{the continuity of the}} solid phase. The clayey material responsible for the continuity consisted mainly of kaolinite with small variation of the aluminium and iron contents. The difference of consistence between the non-indurated and indurated horizons would be related to an increase in the aluminium content and a decrease in the iron content. Thus, aluminium compounds would play a major role as cementing agent within the clayey material...|$|R
40|$|Nitrate (NO 3 − 1) accumulates in Haplocambids and Torrifluvents in inset fan and fan skirt {{positions}} in central Nevada. The soils store {{as much as}} 17, 600 kg of NO 3 − 1 N ha− 1 within the upper 208 cm. This paper provides an explanation. These Holocene soils receive NO 3 − 1 N from mineralization of organic matter and other NO 3 − 1 N sources including snowmelt. The NO 3 − 1 is delivered to soils {{in the first part}} of snowmelt in run-off from the higher surfaces. The last part of the melt and the run-off, when sufficient, serve to move the NO 3 − 1 out of the root zone. Winter fat (Krascheninnikovia lanata), the most valuable winter grazing plant in the Great Basin, is the common plant on NO 3 − 1 N rich soils. The soils are loamy or sandy and lack horizons restricting water penetration or biological denitrification zones. Hence, some NO 3 − 1 is free to leach deeply past plant roots. Playas, wet floodplains, deeply gullied inset fans and well-developed soils accumulate little NO 3 − 1 except where the latter soils are capped by desert pavements and rarely, if ever become saturated with water. Soils with argillic or petrocalcic horizons or <b>duripans</b> on summits of alluvial fan remnants loose NO 3 − 1 through denitrification, or incorporate it in plants, commonly accumulating less than 50 kg of NO 3 − 1 N ha− 1.

50|$|A <b>duripan</b> is a {{diagnostic}} soil horizon of the USDA soil taxonomy that is cemented by illuvial silica into a subsurface hardpan. Similar to a fragipan, Petrocalcic Horizon and petrogypsic horizon, it is firmly cemented and restricts soil management. In soil descriptions, {{they are most}} often denoted by the symbol Bqm. The closest equivalent in the Canadian system of soil classification is called a duric horizon, although {{it does not mean}} exactly the same thing as a <b>duripan</b> in the United States. They form almost exclusively in arid or Mediterranean climates, and can be as hard as concrete, which makes plowing very difficult or impossible.

50|$|A {{petrocalcic horizon}} is a {{diagnostic}} horizon in USDA soil taxonomy.

Petrocalcic horizons are similar to a <b>duripan</b> and a petrogypsic horizon in how they affect land-use limitations. They can occur in conjunction with duripans where the conditions are right and there are enough free carbonates in the soil. Calcium Carbonates are found in alkaline soils, which are typical of arid and semiarid climates. A common field test for the presence of carbonates is application of hydrochloric acid to the soil, which indicates by fizzing and bubbling the presence of calcium carbonates.|$|E
50|$|In some places, forests {{need help}} to restablish {{themselves}} because of environmental factors. For example, in arid zones, once forest cover is destroyed, the land may dry and become inhospitable to new tree growth. Other factors include overgrazing by livestock, especially {{animals such as}} goats, cows, and over-harvesting of forest resources. Together these may lead to desertification {{and the loss of}} topsoil; without soil, forests cannot grow until the long process of soil creation has been completed - if erosion allows this. In some tropical areas, forest cover removal may result in a duricrust or <b>duripan</b> that effectively seal off the soil to water penetration and root growth. In many areas, reforestation is impossible because people are using the land. In other areas, mechanical breaking up of duripans or duricrusts is necessary, careful and continued watering may be essential, and special protection, such as fencing, may be needed.|$|E
50|$|Because {{the soil}} biomantle {{is the main}} zone of bioturbation, it is {{invariably}} permeable and of low density. It thus plays several essential hydropedological roles in the environment. For example, it promotes the downward percolation of rainwater and snowmelt through often-abundant biochannels and interconnected biopores. The biomantle also promotes downslope soil-water (throughflow, interflow) movements if it is formed above a clay-enriched Bt (argillic) horizon, or above some other dense subsoil horizon (e.g., <b>duripan,</b> fragipan, etc.) or bedrock - all of which generally function as aquitards or aquicludes to vertical soil water flow. In such cases the stonelayer, if present, can actually function as an aquifer for free water flow. Hence {{it is not uncommon}} to see soil water seepage above Bt horizons on slopes where soil stonelayers outcrop. Ground water recharge can occur through any of these biomantle-related processes. Recharge, of course, can also occur when the soil dries appreciably and shrinks, as during droughts, which allows vertical leakage to temporarily occur immediately after drought-breaking rainfalls.|$|E
50|$|Within California, vernal pools {{are quite}} {{commonly}} associated with Mima Mounds. These Mima Mounds are typically located on stable landforms that are greater than 100,000 years old. These landforms are characterized by strongly developed soils that usually have a relatively impermeable layer (claypan or silcrete <b>duripan)</b> in the subsoil. This impermeable layer locally impedes drainage and creates perched water levels and causes the formation of vernal pools within the intermound depressions {{that are associated with}} Mima Mounds. Vernal pools are typically small, shallow, and complex ephemeral wetlands that only have internal drainage because they are hydrologically isolated from perennial inflow by a ring of Mima Mounds. Although the ponded water that fills vernal pools comes and goes throughout the year, it is present at least for a short time in most years. However, within California, the mound-depression microrelief associated with Mima Mounds is just one of a variety of geographic settings within which vernal pools occur. For example, in the Modoc Plateau region of California, numerous vernal pools are found on the surface of volcanic mudflows and basalt lava flows where Mima Mounds are completely absent.|$|E
40|$|Study of a {{sequence}} of terraces in the western Snake River Plain of Idaho reveals a record of at least seven terraces, the ages of which span the Pleistocene. In the Boise Valley, the youngest terraces are less than apprx 14, 500 yr and the oldest terraces are apprx 1. 7 Ma. Within this sequence, several relationships exist between soil morphology and terrace chronology. On terraces older than apprx 14, 500 yr, argillic horizon development generally increases with terrace age with maximum development occurring in soils of the oldest terraces. CaCO 3 - and SiO 2 -cemented duripans are found in soils on terraces that are late middle Pleistocene and older. By virtue of their physical and chemical properties, duripans are very resistant to erosion, and therefore provide stable records of CaCO 3 and SiO 2 accumulation throughout multiple cycles of loess deposition onto the terrace treads, pedogenesis, and partial erosion. Mean <b>duripan</b> thickness increases with age {{to a maximum of}} 0. 66 m on the oldest terraces. Our results suggest that a geomorphic surface age of approximately 130, 000 yr is required to form the initial plugged horizon that is characteristic of a <b>duripan.</b> CaCO 3 and SiO 2 accumulation is most rapid in duripans occupying geomorphic surfaces with ages ranging from 130, 000 to 300, 000 yr.

In California, {{they are among}} the few ecosystems still dominated by native flora and are critical habitat for numerous endemic and rare species. In this study, we show that geology is a dominant control on the physical and chemical hydrology of contrasting vernal pools on clay-rich and hardpan soils, the two most common types of vernal pools in the Central Valley, California. The vernal pools on clay-rich soils formed on alluvium derived primarily from sedimentary and metasedimentary rocks of marine origin and deposited in relatively low-gradient environments. The clay-rich soils are fine grained and moderately to strongly saline and sodic. The vernal pools on clay-rich soils are perched surface-water systems in which surface waters are relatively saline, sodic, and turbid and in which primary productivity may be nitrogen and light limited. The vernal pools on hardpan soils formed on alluvium derived primarily from coarse-grained igneous rocks and deposited in relatively high-gradient environments. Surface soils are coarse grained and underlain by a clay-rich argillic horizon and a silica- and iron-cemented <b>duripan.</b> The vernal pools on hardpan soils are surface-water and perched ground-water systems in which surface waters are relatively fresh and non-turbid and in which primary productivity may be phosphorus limited. While surficially similar, these vernal pools differ in their physical and chemical hydrology, and therefore should be treated differently in resource conservation, restoration, and management efforts...|$|E
40|$|Plants and {{amendments}} increase {{quality of}} the tepetates once these hard layers, abundant in the Mexican Volcanic Belt, have been rototilled. In tepetate, which has a mass structure and lacks organic reserves, the addition of organic matter (OM) has proven {{to have a significant}} effect on fertility by supplying N and P, essential for the development of biota, and which promotes a stable structurization. Although it is known that soil quality is related to the nature of the organic compounds, there are few studies referring to the basic compounds of OM, once it has been incorporated into hard layers such as tepetate. The objective of the present study was to quantify the total organic carbon, polysaccharides, humic acids and fulvic acids, supplied to the tepetate by cultivation of fig (Ficus carica L.) and Rhodes grass (Chloris gayana Knuth), with the addition of bovine manure and fertilizer, for two years.

40|$|Silica {{cemented}} pedogenic horizons {{known as}} duripans occur on relict landforms in climates having limited leaching potential. Under {{the influence of}} tephra, incipient silica cementation may also occur in late Quaternary soils. The source of silica for cementation in Holocene soils is rapidly weatherable volcanic glass. In response to wetting and drying cycles volcanic glass weathers to form sand-size composite particles composed of silt, clay and redeposited silica. A portion of the hydrolyzed silica is eluviated as monosilicic acid which accumulates as the wetting front evaporates. Illuvial silica augments existing composite particles eventually forming a continuously cemented <b>duripan.</b> In actively forming late Quaternary soils, the cementation process is a complex interaction between illuvial silica, clay and calcium carbonate and the soil matrix. Surface reactions between monosilicic acid and illuvial clay or soil matrix particles provide nucleation sites for polymerization of silica concentrated by evaporation. The resulting opaline silica bonds adjacent soil grains without necessarily plugging intervening pore spaces. In contrast, calcium carbonate preferentially precipitates in large pores and interped voids. Cementation occurs by the plugging of progressively smaller pores with relatively pure calcite rather than by heterogeneous bonding of mineral grains. In illuvial zones containing both silica and calcium carbonate, cementation may occur rapidly because the former holds small soil particles in place while the latter plugs large pores. The mineralogy of silica cement is determined by identification of varying amounts of crystal order using X-ray diffraction. Opal-A is recently polymerized, noncrystalline, highly hydrated silica gel. The more prevalent, partly crystalline opal-CT forms where surface reaction with clays create crystal orientation, where silica gel dehydrates or when silica precipitates from soil solutions having high concentrations...|$|E
40|$|Fragipan {{horizon is}} a natural, {{subsurface}} soil layer exhibiting higher bulk density and lower porosity {{in comparison with}} the overlying horizons significantly restricting infiltration of water and root penetration. In contrast to hard and cemented horizons (e. g. <b>duripan),</b> clods of the fragipan horizon (Btx) slake or fracture immediately when placed in water. The most interesting issue concerning genesis and properties of the fragipan horizon is its reversible cementation, i. e. very hard consistence in dry state and brittle consistence in moist state. The main objective {{of the present study was}} to explain and improve the understanding of the specific consistence of the fragipan horizon in moderately humid climate on the example of Albeluvisols of the Carpathian Foothills in Poland basing on mineral and chemical composition of bridges linking coarse soil material. Quantitative X-ray diffraction shows that the studied fragipan horizon contains high concentration of swelling clay minerals. Soil material from the fragipan horizon exhibits numerous clay and iron–clay coatings and clay infillings indicating translocation of colloidal clay and iron oxides from overlying horizons. In addition, bridges between coarse grains of the soil material occur. The fragipan cementing material is composed mainly of SiO 2, Al 2 O 3, and Fe 2 O 3 with lower concentration of K 2 O, MgO, CaO, and Na 2 O. The chemical composition of bridges within the pan is similar to that of clay coatings and clay infillings suggesting that clay minerals are major bonding agents and are responsible for brittleness and more friable consistence of the pan in the moist state. Additionally, free iron, aluminium, and silica may play some role in specific cementation of the investigated fragipan horizon but these elements are not main bonding agents...|$|E

This soil was generally covered by alang-alang or shrub and bush. The soils were generally distributed in cold climate or wet tropical areas with high rainfall. The objectives of this paper were to discuss the characteristics ofSpodosols in Kalimantan and Sumatra and the possibility of their utilization. In Indonesia, this soil is found in Kalimantan, Sulawesi, Sumatra, and Papua Islands. Parent materials of the soils were originated from quartz sand, sediment or acid sedimentary rocks (quartz sandstone) with low nutrients status. Physiographically, the soils were distributed in alluvial plain, colluvial, sand beach, sand dune, tectonic plain and sandstone plateau on elevation of 5 to > 1, 500 m asl, with flat to nearly undulating relieves. The soil physical properties were {{characterized by}} coarse texture and the presence of root limiting layer such as fragipan, <b>duripan,</b> or placic horizon (organo-metal complex) with various depth. The soil chemical properties were characterized by acid soil reaction, very low exchangeable bases, P and K nutrient, and mineral reserve. Cation exchange capacity of the soils depends on their soil organic matter content. Based on the soil characteristics, most Spodosols were not suitable for agricultural land development. Therefore the Spodosols USAges should be directed not only for production increases but also for environmental healthiness and soilcare.

40|$|ABSTRACT Horizons {{with varying}} degrees of {{cementation}} are a common feature of the soils from the coastal tablelands of Northeastern Brazil. In most cases, these horizons are represented by the following subsurface horizons: fragipan, <b>duripan,</b> ortstein, and placic. The aims of this study were to analyze differences regarding the development and the degree of expression of cementation in soils from the coastal tablelands of Northeastern Brazil: Planossolo Háplico (p-SX), Espodossolo Humilúvico (p-EK), Espodossolo Ferrihumilúvico (p-ESK), and Argissolo Acinzentado (p-PAC) pedons. The pedons studied displayed features related to drainage impediments. The cemented horizons from p-SX and p-EK had the same designation (Btgm), displaying a duric character that coincided with gleization features and are under podzolized horizons. In the p-ESK, the podzolization process is of such magnitude that it leads to the cementation of its own spodic horizons, which were both of the ortstein type (Bhsx and Bsm). In the p-PAC cementation is observed in two placic horizons and in the Btx/Bt horizon, {{as well as in the}} upper parts of the Bt/Btx horizon. Analysis of the micrographies from the cemented horizons showed predominance of a low porosity matrix. Such porosity is relatively greater in the horizons of &# 8220;x&# 8221; subscript than in the horizons with duric character. The Fe segregation lines were notable in the cemented horizons from p-EK and p-PAC, which corroborates the presence of placic horizons in such pedons. The preponderance of kaolinite in the clay fraction was widely verified in all the cemented horizons analyzed. Water immersion tests were the criteria adopted to define the duric character of the Btgm horizons from p-SX and p-EK, and in the Bsm horizon from the p-ESK. These tests were also used to confirm field morphology. In most cases, the maximum values of Fe, Al, and Si, determined by different extractions, occurred in positions overlaying the cemented horizons, whether they were spodic or not. The extracts of the aqueous solution displayed a noticeable accumulation of Si in the cemented horizons, except in the p-PAC. The presence of argillans in all cemented horizons allows them to be defined as illuvial, with the exception of the placic horizons, regardless of the presence of podzolization processes. The cemented horizons were preponderantly apedal, with a matrix of little porosity. The Fe, Al, and Si contents extracted by acid ammonium oxalate were effective at highlighting the influence of compounds with a low degree of crystallinity in the morphology of cemented horizons...|$|E
40|$|An {{irrigation}} scheme {{has been}} proposed for the Ngatarawa region of the Heretaunga Plains (Hawkes Bay). The method proposed for irrigation of these soils is the border-dyke method. It was felt that this method could be inefficient {{in the use of}} water and considerable amounts of water could be lost to drainage from some of the soils in this region. Thus experiments were performed on the four major soil types of this region – Poporangi sandy loam (Typic Durochrept), Ngatarawa sandy loam (Typic Ustorthent), Takapau sandy loam (Andri Ustochrept), and Pakowhai silt loam (Aquic Ustifluvent) – to determine their hydraulic properties. The instantaneous profile method was used to measure the drainage, and water storage behaviour of these soils, and their hydraulic conductivity. Hydraulic conductivity could not be calculated for the Poporangi sandy loam, due to the <b>duripan</b> causing lateral flow. This invalidated the assumption that the movement of water was only vertical. For one other soil, Ngatarawa sandy loam, the hydraulic conductivity data obtained were considered to be unreliable. Reliable hydraulic conductivity data were obtained for Takapau sandy loam and Pakowhai silt loam. From data obtained from "undisturbed cores" and the field experiments, the drainage behaviour and water storage properties were determined for all four soils. Using a numerical technique, vertical movement of water in Takapau sandy loam and Pakowhai silt loam,during and following ponded infiltration, was simulated using a CSMP computer model. These simulations indicate that the loss of water to through drainage from Takapau sandy loam would be at least 50 % of that infiltrated, if the proposed residence time for ponding of water of 70 minutes is used. For Pakowhai silt loam the simulations indicate that little water is likely to be lost to drainage if a residence time of 120 minutes is used. As hysteresis in the volumetric water content/pressure potential relationship is likely to affect the validity of these simulations, the extent of hysteresis on this relationship in these soils was investigated. From all of these data it was concluded that only the Pakowhai silt loam would be suitable for irrigation by the border-dyke method. If this method was used on the other soils, large amounts of water could be lost to drainage. This would not only be a waste of a scarce resource, but as the Ngatarawa region lies over the unconfined part of the aquifer from which Napier and Hastings cities draw their water, it could also be a health hazard, as the drainage water from these soils could cause the nitrate level in the water in this aquifer to increase. Thus {{it would be better to}} irrigate the other three soils (Poporangi sandy loam, Ngatarawa sandy loam and Takapau sandy loam) using a sprinkler system. The application rate of the sprinkler system should be less than the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the A horizon of the soil, otherwise horizontal distribution of the amount of water infiltrating into the soil can be very uneven...|$|E
40|$|Western Hawke's Bay, North Island, New Zealand, lies landward of an obliquely {{convergent}} offshore plate boundary, the Hikurangi Trough. Landscape elements exhibit classical island arc terrains. From {{east to west}} these are: an accretionary wedge, forearc basin, frontal-ridge, and {{a volcanic}} backarc basin. The forearc was subdivided into four land systems: ranges, inland basins, hill-country, and plains. Soil patterns and geomorphological processes within each land system are detailed. The architecture and subsequent sculpturing of land systems {{have been subject to}} a complex interplay between: tectonic, climatic, fluvial, aeolian and volcanic regimes. These regimes have had a marked bearing upon the stability/instability of the landscape and its evolution. The timing of stability/instability cycles within the district's coverbeds and aggradational/degradational terraces is facilitated by interbedded rhyolitic and andesitic tephra chronohorizons and ignimbrites (Taupo, Oruanui, Rabbit Gully and Potaka) derived from the Taupo Volcanic Zone. The glass chemistries of unknown rhyolitic tephras and ignimbrites were matched with those from the well-dated master sections around the volcanic centres. During this study the geographic distribution of many andesitic and rhyolitic tephra layers have been significantly expanded into a district not previously studied in detail. Andesitic tephras identified include members of the Tufa Trig, Ngauruhoe, Papakai, Mangamate and Bullott Formations. Rhyolitic tephras found, but not previously recorded in Hawke's Bay sequences, include Rerewhakaaitu and Rangitawa Tephras and four previously unidentified rhyolitic tephras termed A, B, C and D within Loess 4 and Loess 5. Major cycles of landscape stability/instability are associated with Quaternary climate changes. During glacial and stadial times intense physical weathering prevailed within the ranges resulting in the transfer of material (aggradation products) through the fluvial and aeolian systems to the downlands and coastal plains. Interglacial and interstadial times were marked by a predominance of chemical weathering (paleosols) and river degradation. The net result was landsurface stabilisation before the next episode of instability. Loess-paleosol layers recognised in Hawke's Bay are correlated to the Rangitikei River Valley sequences. Unlike the Rangitikei sequences, where the best loess-paleosol record overlies terraces, those in Hawke's Bay are found on footslopes. Pre- and early-Ohakean loessial sequences overlying aggradational terraces are absent. Consequently, studies were focussed on colluvial foot- and toe-slopes (depositional sites) within the inland basins and hill-country land systems. Coverbeds from these slope positions have a fuller record and are more useful for stratigraphic studies. Earthquakes, fires (both natural and man-induced), periodic cyclonic storms and ignimbrite sheets punctuate and complicate the climatically induced Quaternary cycles. The record for these non-climatic variables is often local and may mask or even destroy the imprint of older, more poorly preserved climatically-induced Pleistocene stability and instability episodes. Field, morphological, mineralogical and chemical properties of loess and tephra layers were undertaken at four reference sections. These sections are arranged in a west (foothills of the ranges) to east (coast) transect reflecting differences in climate (1800 - 900 mm rainfall/annum, lower rainfalls in the east), soil types (Pumice, Allophanic, Brown and Pallic Soils) and distance from volcanic source areas. The most distant site lies over 100 km east of Lake Taupo. Three aggradational terraces associated with the last stadial (Ohakean) are commonly found along Hawke's Bay rivers. Ohakean terraces along the Mohaka River have tread ages of c. 16 - 14 ka, 14 - 11 ka and 11 - 10 ka, respectively. Field and laboratory characterisation of <b>duripan</b> horizons within Pallic Soils were undertaken to elucidate the nature and origin of the cementing medium. Soil chemistry and mineralogy show the cement to be highly siliceous and most likely derived from the weathering products of volcanic ash...|$|E
