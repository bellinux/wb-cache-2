25|$|In another {{episode that}} focused on myths {{surrounding}} electronic security devices, there was a segment on defeating biometric fingerprint readers using various methods. One of these techniques involved creating a fake 3D fingerprint from a 2D image of the authorized print. After some trial and error, the team successfully cast a viable ballistics gel reproduction using a copper-coated circuit board, {{a picture of the}} fingerprint printed on acetate, and a photochemical acid <b>etching</b> <b>process.</b> After the reproduction was shown to defeat both fingerprint scanners, and although the chemicals used during the <b>etching</b> <b>process</b> are never identified, the narrator still hints at an important step having been edited out and discourages viewers from trying it themselves. None of the other techniques that successfully defeated the fingerprint scanners or the other security devices tested in the episode were censored or obfuscated, perhaps because the rest were all fairly simple and straightforward methods, such as holding up a bedsheet or moving extremely slowly to hide from ultrasonic motion detectors or holding up a pane of glass to defeat thermal motion detectors.|$|E
25|$|Already in his patent {{application}} of 1886 Pollak {{wrote that the}} capacitance of the capacitor increased if {{the surface of the}} anode foil was roughened. A number of methods have since been developed for roughening the anode surface, mechanical methods like sand blasting or scratching, and chemical etching with acids and acid salts forced by high currents. Some of these methods were developed in the CD factory between 1931 and 1938. Today (2014), electro-chemically etching of low voltage foils can achieve up to a 200 fold increase in surface area compared to a smooth surface. Progress relating to the <b>etching</b> <b>process</b> is the reason for the ongoing reduction in the dimensions of aluminum electrolytic capacitors over the past decades.|$|E

40|$|Many technologically {{interesting}} multicomponent {{materials such}} as ferroelectrics, garnets, high temperature superconductors (HTSC), etc. do not form volatile halogen compounds at temperatures below 120 C. That is why standard microelectronic <b>etching</b> <b>processes</b> such as reactive ion etching (RIE) are not applicable for pattern transfer to these materials. The aim {{of the project was}} to develop alternative plasma and ion beam supported <b>etching</b> <b>processes</b> for pattern transfer to several technologically relevant multicomponent thin films with pattern widths in the lower #mu#m range and to assess their suitability.

25|$|During {{the nineteenth}} century, {{artists such as}} Hale were {{instrumental}} in reviving etching in America and Europe and restoring {{the significance of this}} technical medium. At the forefront of the Etching Revival of Hale's time was artist James Abbott McNeill Whistler, who set the standard for new generation of etchers. Clements first introduced Hale to etching while the pair was traveling in Europe. In terms of the <b>etching</b> <b>process,</b> Hale, like her contemporaries, used copper plates to produce clean, well-defined impressions. Hale experimented with a variety of etching techniques, including hard-ground, soft-ground, aquatint, and color inking. In the etching medium, Hale worked on a more intimate basis, using etchings to document her travels through the U.S., Europe, and the Middle East. Some of Hale’s most accomplished prints include The Willow Whistle, which was produced using hard-ground etching and displayed at the Paris Salon, and First Night in Venice, which used the soft-ground process.|$|E

2500|$|To his Nancy contemporaries, Bellange {{must have}} been known mainly as a painter, but no very useful {{descriptions}} of his work survive. He is recorded as painting a number of portraits, but none {{are known to have}} survived. A Beggar Looking Through His Hat in the Walters Art Museum, Baltimore, which they attribute to Bellange, was donated by the former Soviet spy Michael Straight (1931–2004): [...] "Given the secretive character of the man depicted, peering at us through a hole in his hat, the painting may have had a particular appeal for its previous owner", the museum suggests. It has been speculated that some of his prints are versions of his paintings, but there is no evidence for this, and the evidence of compositional changes made during the <b>etching</b> <b>process</b> in some prints goes against the theory.|$|E
2500|$|... (2) In the <b>etching</b> <b>process</b> an {{enlarged}} {{image of the}} design is cast upon a zinc plate {{by means of an}} enlarging camera and prisms or reflectors. On this plate it is then painted in colours roughly approximating to those in the original, and the outlines of each colour are carefully engraved in duplicate by hand. The necessity for this is that in subsequent operations the design has to be again reduced to its original size and, if the outlines on the zinc plate were too small at first, they would be impracticable either to etch or print. The reduction of the design and its transfer to a varnished copper roller are both effected at one and the same operation in the pantograph machine. This machine is capable of reducing a pattern on the zinc plate from one-half to one-tenth of its size, and is so arranged that when its pointer or stylus is moved along the engraved lines of the plate a series of diamond points cut a reduced facsimile of them through the varnish with which the roller is covered. These diamond points vary in number according to the number of times the pattern is required to repeat {{along the length of the}} roller. Each colour of a design is transferred in this way to a separate roller. The roller is then placed in a shallow trough containing nitric acid, which acts only on those parts of it from which the varnish has been scraped. To ensure evenness the roller is revolved during the whole time of its immersion in the acid. When the etching is sufficiently deep the roller is washed, the varnish dissolved off, any parts not quite perfect being retouched by hand.|$|E
