5000|$|Sometimes, certain water {{vessels are}} {{equipped}} with advanced water treatment plants instead of traditional Marine Sanitation Device’s. Advance Water Treatment plants can also {{be referred to as}} Advanced Wastewater Purification (AWP) systems. They are most commonly found on ships that sail in Alaskan waters and sometimes work in parallel with an onboard Marine Sanitation Device. Royal Caribbean International, for example, have installed AWP systems on their ships which treat wastewater using advanced technology. Royal Caribbean AWP systems include three types of water purification systems, Scanship, Hydroxyl/Headworks and Navalis. Scanship and Hydroxyl use biological treatment while the Navalis system primarily uses advanced oxidation and filtration methods. Scanship and Hydroxyl systems use bacterial to consume the waste while also utilizing a chemical in order to break down and remove solids. Scanship and Hydroxyl systems are very similar to water treatment plants based on shore. This involves a simple five stage process. The first stage involves a prefilter where screens removes heavy and noticeable solids from the waste influent. Then the wastewater is passed through a biological reactor which uses beneficial bacteria to further break down any solids. Next the influent is pumped through a <b>flotation</b> <b>unit</b> which removes floatable waste. Afterwards, the clean water is passed through polishing filters which make the water even cleaner. The last and final stage involves an ultraviolet light reactor which disinfects the water.

The make-up water is a low-salinity salt water from the Arbuckle Formation and contains dissolved minerals and sulfides.

The combination of the two waters causes several undesirable reactions. The suspended solids load contained in the combined waters would plug a 75 -micron plant bag filter within one day. Wellhead filters of 75 -micron size were also being used on the injection wells. The poor water quality resulted in severe loss of injectivity and frequent wellbore cleaning of the injection wells.

40|$|Dissolved Air Flotation (DAF) is a {{well-established}} treatment method for water containing low density particles. The density-driven process is {{operated by the}} injection of water saturated with air under high pressure. At the pressure reduction microscopic air bubbles are formed. The bubbles attach to the particles and the aggregates created rise {{to the surface of}} the unit where they are removed. Researchers working with DAF units struggle with disturbances in their measurements caused by air bubbles and the intrusion of the measuring equipment into the flow. In order to increase the knowledge and efficiency of the process researchers are now turning to Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). The aim of this thesis is to investigate the applicability to use CFD for modelling DAF. The work is carried out by examining single and multiphase, steady-state numerical models of a pilot tank where the flow is simulated with ANSYS Fluent. The options of making a two- or a three-dimensional model and the choice of turbulence and multiphase models are examined. The simulations are compared to experimental measurements for validation. A model describing the formation of the aggregates in the <b>flotation</b> <b>unit</b> is derived and a field study on flotation units in operation in Finland and Sweden is carried out. The work demonstrates that a single-phase, two-dimensional model can capture the flow in the separation zone reasonably well, but that a three-dimensional model is required if the flow in the contact zone is to be studied. A two-phase flow can be captured in a two-dimensional geometry if it carries the characteristics of a stratified flow, suggesting that a two-dimensional model should be used with caution. A three-dimensional, two-phase model will reflect the flow in a DAF tank more truthfully, but requires more computer capacity and results indicate that a transient solver is required. The implementation of the aggregate model demonstrates the creation and motion of the aggregates within the contact zone of the DAF unit. The field study proves the acceptance of the DAF process and indicates that a numerical model would be valuable for investigating the performance of a <b>flotation</b> <b>unit</b> in operation...|$|E
