Ghosh commented, [...] "Till now, I have dealt with relationships and {{the intricacies of the}} human mind. With this film, I want to delve into that which lies beyond and observe how this non-conventional spiritualism, Wicca, guides me. [...] It's a story of two time zones, separated by a span of 150 years, two people of different mindsets and different cultures." [...] However, in 2006, the story Sacred Evil from Sacred Evil: Encounters with the Unknown was adapted into a film by Sahara One Motion Pictures; Ipsita served as creative director. The film, titled as Sacred Evil– A True Story, was a joint venture between Sahara One and Percept Picture Company. Sacred Evil was the last story in the book and is about a nun who was hounded by her troubled past and for whom the convent eventually sought counseling from Chakraverti. Sahara One had approached August 2004 to make a film on Sacred Evil, but she was reluctant to play herself on the big screen when offered the role, and chose, instead to be the creative director. Chakraverti helped pen the script, incorporating a large amount of dialogue from her story. [...] "I told the production team how the protagonist reacted in certain situations, since I had lived the story, and how the dialogue happened. [...] I also insisted that the film be shot in Calcutta, though others had suggested other places, because it's here where I have done most of my therapies." [...] Actress Sarika was signed to play Chakraverti's part, to which Chakraverti said: [...] "The other and more important task was familiarizing Sarika with the ways of a Wiccan. We had several sittings before going for the shoot. Sarika wanted to imbibe me. So, she came down to Delhi and lived with me for a while. <b>I</b> <b>showed</b> <b>her</b> how the healing took place and how certain rituals had been conducted." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{am afraid}} I {{did a very}} foolish thing when <b>I</b> <b>showed</b> <b>her</b> the {{poisoning}} story. Has it helped the wily old creature to look into my inmost thoughts? ...|$|E
60|$|When {{we passed}} through Hammersmith, <b>I</b> <b>showed</b> <b>her</b> where Mr. Matthew Pocket lived, {{and said it was}} no great way from Richmond, and that I hoped I should see her sometimes.|$|E
2500|$|... {{thought to}} be Elizabeth <b>I,</b> <b>shows</b> <b>her</b> wearing a red gown with a fur lining. She wears a red flat hat over a small cap or caul that {{confines}} her hair.|$|R
6000|$|It was an hairy oubit, sae proud he crept alang, A feckless hairy oubit, and merrily he sang-- 'My Minnie bad me bide at hame until I won my wings; <b>I</b> <b>show</b> <b>her</b> soon my soul's aboon the warks o' {{creeping}} things.' ...|$|R
60|$|At the {{eleventh}} hour <b>I</b> had <b>shown</b> <b>her</b> of what stuff I was made.|$|R
60|$|We readjusted {{the torn}} skirt, {{accommodating}} {{it better to}} her figure by the help of hairpins. <b>I</b> <b>showed</b> <b>her</b> how to hold the train, and, I humming a tune, we commenced to waltz.|$|E
60|$|Sarah {{came on the}} {{following}} Saturday evening, and <b>I</b> <b>showed</b> <b>her</b> the plan we had made, and explained to her where we thought the entrance was, and how she was most likely to find the secret spring.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, {{about the}} Swiss being under the Empire, or something, and she WOULD go into {{parallels}} of Saxon words, and English poetry, such as our Fraulein never troubled us with. But <b>I</b> <b>showed</b> <b>her</b> {{it would not}} DO.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I'm {{going to}} <b>show</b> <b>her</b> all <b>I</b> can <b>show</b> <b>her</b> anyhow. And after that, Mrs. Rabbit, you shall come in. You needn't wait." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's {{all very}} well in its way, old fellow," [...] he admitted, [...] "but to {{appreciate}} this absolutely {{you ought to be}} married. I can think of nothing but Nora's face when I tell her--when <b>I</b> <b>show</b> <b>her</b> the pocketbook--when she begins to realise! Jacob, it's worth all the misery of the last few years. It's worth--anything." ...|$|R
6000|$|Charnock's eyes twinkled. [...] "I expect Sadie {{will bear}} the separation. For one thing, {{we lost our}} crop and she'll save money while I'm away. She's not parsimonious, but she hates to waste dollars, and must have found me {{expensive}} now and then. Then I mean to earn something, and can imagine <b>her</b> surprise when <b>I</b> <b>show</b> <b>her</b> my wages check." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh dear, yes!' {{said the}} Doctor; 'Annie's quite well, and she'll {{be delighted to}} see you. You were always her favourite. She said so, last night, when <b>I</b> <b>showed</b> <b>her</b> your letter. And--yes, to be sure--you {{recollect}} Mr. Jack Maldon, Copperfield?' ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>showed</b> <b>her</b> {{the little}} piece of calico that my wife had given me. She {{looked at it and}} handed it back to me. Then she took down a great roll of red calico and spread it out on the counter.|$|E
6000|$|Miss Jillgall {{was in the}} drawing-room. With the {{necessary}} explanations, <b>I</b> <b>showed</b> <b>her</b> the letter. She read it with breathless interest. [...] "It terrifies one to think how much depends on old Mr. Dunboyne," [...] she said. [...] "You know him. What sort of man is he?" ...|$|E
5000|$|The artist Joseph Pennell {{created a}} poster 1918 {{for the fourth}} Liberty Loans {{campaign}} of 1918, during World War <b>I,</b> <b>showing</b> <b>her</b> headless and torchless while around her the New York area was in flames, under enemy attack by air and by sea. The poster is sometimes referred to on the Web as [...] "That liberty shall not perish" [...] since these are the first words that appear on it.|$|R
60|$|Me? I'm not a drooler. I'm the assistant, I don't {{know what}} Miss Jones or Miss Kelsey {{could do without}} me. There are fifty-five low-grade droolers in this ward, and how could they ever all be fed if I wasn't around? I like to feed droolers. They don't make trouble. They can't. Something's wrong with most of their legs and arms, and they can't talk. They're very low-grade. I can walk, and talk, and do things. You must be careful with the droolers and not feed them too fast. Then they choke. Miss Jones says I'm an expert. When a new nurse comes <b>I</b> <b>show</b> <b>her</b> how to do it. It's funny {{watching}} a new nurse try to feed them. She goes at it so slow and careful that supper time would be around before she finished shoving down their breakfast. Then <b>I</b> <b>show</b> <b>her,</b> because I'm an expert. Dr. Dalrymple says I am, and he ought to know. A drooler can eat twice as fast {{if you know how}} to make him.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> then <b>showed</b> <b>her</b> a small plan of Harmer Place, which I {{had drawn}} from my {{recollection}} of it, and Sarah understood perfectly {{what she had}} to do.|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>showed</b> <b>her</b> {{the letter}} I had written, and she highly {{approved}} of it. [...] "If I were you," [...] she said, [...] "I would send that letter, and then I {{would not do}} another thing. Take my word for it, you will never hear from those people again." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{said that}} I should {{certainly}} not forget it, and <b>I</b> <b>showed</b> <b>her</b> the envelope {{with my name}} on the outside, and hers on a card inside, which the serving-man at the door had given me in the hall, as the first token that the dinner was to be unceremonious.|$|E
6000|$|... "She is come of age, {{and will}} reside {{for a time}} on her property. I lectured her on the subject; <b>I</b> <b>showed</b> <b>her</b> her duty. She is not intractable. She is rather a fine girl; she will teach {{you what it is}} to have a sprightly spirit. Nothing lackadaisical about her." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "And here I am rubbing my fabulous new car in her face," [...] Bree says, [...] "I feel awful. Thank God <b>I</b> didn't <b>show</b> <b>her</b> how it parks itself!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, sir; {{she asked}} for Mr. Philip first, and when I {{told her that he}} was out, {{she asked for}} you, sir. <b>I</b> have <b>shown</b> <b>her</b> into the study." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{took him}} down to the Riverview Hotel and had him shake hands with Mrs. Trotter. Then <b>I</b> <b>showed</b> him <b>her</b> bank book with the $2,000 to her credit.|$|R
60|$|She agreed, instantly, to this exchange, and <b>I</b> <b>showed</b> <b>her</b> how to {{hold and}} manage the gun. I didn't {{think it was a}} very good thing for a girl to have, but it was a great deal safer than the pistol for the people on board. The latter I put in my pocket.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>showed</b> <b>her</b> Lord Erymanth's letter, {{and told}} her of the others, asking her what it meant. [...] "Oh, as to Lady Diana," [...] she said, [...] "there {{is no doubt about}} that. She was greatly {{offended}} at your having sent away her carriage and not having taken her advice, and she goes about saying she is disappointed in you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{were talking}} about coins, and Christie was expressing her opinion of one <b>I</b> <b>showed</b> <b>her.</b> The face and date she understands; but the motto puzzles her, and she has not seen the reverse side yet, so does not know its value. She will some day; and then she will agree with me, I think, that it is {{sterling}} gold." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{was surely}} wrong about Father Benwell? <b>I</b> tried to <b>show</b> <b>her</b> why.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ye'll {{never be}} able to take yer watch at the diamond pit to-night, Dad," [...] she said; [...] "and I've been reck'nin' you might set the squaw there instead. <b>I</b> can <b>show</b> <b>her</b> what to do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{cried the}} girl, anticipating the inquiry. [...] "Yes! She went the way <b>I</b> had <b>shown</b> <b>her.</b> Then <b>I</b> came in, and Mrs. Snagsby came behind me from somewhere and laid hold of me, and I was frightened." ...|$|R
60|$|There {{were the}} usual {{crowd of people}} there, but no one whom I {{recognized}} particularly, until the stout lady who had talked to me the night before came in. <b>I</b> <b>showed</b> <b>her</b> to a table, and she talked to me graciously in German. She had discarded her black sailor hat, and had the appearance of being dressed in her best clothes.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{child will}} be born and live out its life, and I think {{that none of us}} are doomed to die this day by the jaws of lions, though some of us may die in another fashion. But I think also that your {{mistress}} goes very shortly to join her husband. Therefore it was that <b>I</b> <b>showed</b> <b>her</b> nothing of what came into my mind." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No, though I did {{the best}} I could. I told her what a jolly place it was, and that the {{children}} would be a perfect holiday to her. And <b>I</b> <b>showed</b> <b>her</b> {{it would not be}} like going away, for she might come over here whenever she pleased; and when I have my horse, I would come and bring her word of the old ladies once a week.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... “But no,” thinks he; “I shall {{wait till}} <b>I</b> can <b>show</b> <b>her</b> the concertina; {{we shall see}} what the chit will do then. Perhaps she will {{understand}} {{in the future that}} her husband is a man of some intelligence.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That I will do," [...] quoth Gillian; [...] "and, moreover, <b>I</b> will <b>show</b> <b>her</b> such a new riding-tire for the head, that {{no woman}} born could ever look at without {{the wish to}} toss it {{a little in the}} wind." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, for {{the life}} of me I can't {{remember}} when I done it. <b>I</b> could <b>show</b> <b>her</b> now that <b>I</b> warn't to blame on account of the rats. But never mind --let it go. I reckon it wouldn't do no good." ...|$|R
