40|$|A {{series of}} {{fourteen}} porous Metalâ€“Organic Frameworks (MOFs) with different compositions (Fe, Zn, and Zr; carboxylates or imidazolates) and structures {{have been successfully}} synthesised at the nanoscale and fully characterised by XRPD, FTIR, TGA, N 2 porosimetry, TEM, DLS and z-potential. Their toxicological assessment was performed using two different cell lines: human epithelial cells from foetal cervical carcinoma (HeLa) and murine macrophage cell line (J 774). It appears that MOF nanoparticles (NPs) exhibit low cytotoxicity, {{comparable to those of}} other commercialised nanoparticulate systems, the less toxic being the Fe carboxylate and the more toxic being the zinc imidazolate NPs. The cytotoxicity values, higher in J 774 cells than in HeLa cells, are mainly function of their composition and cell internalisation capacity. Finally, cell uptake {{of one of the most}} relevant Fe-MOF-NPs for <b>drug</b> <b>vectorisation</b> has been investigated by confocal microscopy studies, and indicates a faster kinetics of cell penetration within J 774 compared to HeLa cells...|$|E
40|$|Nanomaterials {{have been}} the object of intense study due to {{promising}} applications {{in a number of}} different disciplines. In particular, medicine and biology have seen the potential of these novel materials with their nanoscale properties for use in diverse areas such as imaging, sensing and <b>drug</b> <b>vectorisation.</b> Gold nanoparticles (GNPs) are considered a very useful platform to create a valid and efficient drug delivery/carrier system due to their facile and well-studied synthesis, easy surface functionalization and biocompatibility. In the present study, stable antibiotic conjugated GNPs were synthesised by a one-step reaction using a poorly water soluble antibiotic, amoxicillin. Amoxicillin, a member of the penicillin family, reduces the chloroauric acid to form nanoparticles and at the same time coats them to afford the functionalised nanomaterial. A range of techniques including UV-vis spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering (DLS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) were used to ascertain the gold/drug molar ratio and the optimum temperature for synthesis of uniform monodisperse particles in the ca. 30 - 40 nm size range. Amoxicillin-conjugated gold showed an enhancement of antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli compared to the antibiotic alone...|$|E
