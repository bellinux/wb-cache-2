5000|$|One of the {{earliest}} sketch maps on Marcahuamachuco comes from the 18th-century document prepared by Bishop Baltazar Jaime Martinez Compañón. Early <b>descriptions</b> <b>and</b> <b>drawings</b> from the late 19th century were done by European travelers, as the field of archeology was developing professionally. Charles Wiener in 1880 published the first topographical <b>description</b> of Marcahuamachuco <b>and</b> named its principal compounds.

50|$|Article 69 {{should not}} be {{interpreted}} {{in the sense that}} the extent of the protection conferred by a European patent is to be understood as that defined by the strict, literal meaning of the wording used in the claims, the <b>description</b> <b>and</b> <b>drawings</b> being employed only for the purpose of resolving an ambiguity found in the claims. Neither should it be interpreted {{in the sense that the}} claims serve only as a guideline and that the actual protection conferred may extend to what, from a consideration of the <b>description</b> <b>and</b> <b>drawings</b> by a person skilled in the art, the patentee has contemplated. On the contrary, it is to be interpreted as defining a position between these extremes which combines a fair protection for the patentee with a reasonable degree of certainty for third parties.|$|E
5000|$|In other words, the [...] "extent of the protection" [...] conferred by a European patent is {{determined}} primarily {{by reference to}} {{the claims of the}} European patent (rather than by the disclosure of the specification and drawings, as in some older patent systems), though the <b>description</b> <b>and</b> <b>drawings</b> are to be used as interpretive aids in determining the meaning of the claims. A [...] "Protocol on the Interpretation of Article 69 EPC" [...] provides further guidance, that claims are to be construed using a [...] "fair" [...] middle position, neither [...] "strict, literal" [...] nor as mere guidelines to considering the <b>description</b> <b>and</b> <b>drawings,</b> though of course even the protocol is subject to national interpretation.

25|$|The islands {{had been}} little studied or biologically {{surveyed}} before the 1883 catastrophe—only two pre-1883 biological collections are known: one of plant specimens {{and the other}} part of a shell collection.

50|$|Many of Georg Humann's art {{historical}} conclusions have been superseded by newer research, but his works are still used today, because Humann's observations, <b>descriptions</b> <b>and</b> <b>drawings</b> are very precise.

In 1890 Humann proposed an early date for the Essen Westwerk on stylistic grounds, which was not accepted but has lately been taken up once more.|$|R
50|$|The European {{search report}} is drawn up {{in respect of}} a European patent {{application}} {{on the basis of}} the claims, with due regard to the description and any drawings. In addition, the extent of the protection conferred by a European patent or a European patent application is determined by the claims, with the <b>description</b> <b>and</b> <b>drawings</b> being used to interpret the claims.|$|E
5000|$|Infringement is remitted {{almost entirely}} to {{national}} law and to national courts. In {{one of its}} very few substantive interventions into national law, the EPC requires that national courts must consider the [...] "direct product of a patented process" [...] to be an infringement. The [...] "extent of the protection" [...] conferred by a European patent is determined primarily by reference to {{the claims of the}} European patent (rather than by the disclosure of the specification and drawings, as in some older patent systems), though the <b>description</b> <b>and</b> <b>drawings</b> are to be used as interpretive aids in determining the meaning of the claims.

50|$|The United Kingdom {{has never}} {{employed}} {{a doctrine of}} equivalents approach. This was most recently asserted by Lord Hoffmann in Kirin-Amgen Inc v Hoechst Marion Roussel Ltd (2004). As a signatory to the European Patent Convention (EPC), the UK follows the Protocol on the Interpretation of Article 69 of the EPC, which requires member states to draw a balance between interpreting patent claims with strict literalism (with the <b>description</b> <b>and</b> <b>drawings</b> only helping resolve ambiguity) and regarding the claims as a mere guideline only.|$|E

This prompted Esnault-Pelterie, a French military engineer, {{to build a}} Wright-style glider in 1904 that used ailerons in lieu of wing warping. The French journal L’Aérophile then published photos of the ailerons on Esnault-Pelterie’s glider which were included in his June 1905 article, and its ailerons were widely copied afterward.|$|R

5000|$|A {{complete}} working model of Burt's [...] "typographer" [...] {{was in the}} model room of the Patent Office {{from the time of}} the patent until the great Patent Office fire of December 15, 1836. The fire destroyed all the patents and patent models issued from 1790. A competent mechanic can build a working replica of Burt's typographer from his patent <b>description</b> <b>and</b> <b>drawings.</b> In fact Austin Burt, the great grandson of Burt, built a working model in 1892 for the Columbian Exposition working from a parchment copy of the original patent (No. 5581X).|$|E
5000|$|A {{provisional}} application includes a specification, i.e. a <b>description,</b> <b>and</b> <b>drawing(s)</b> of an invention (drawings are required where {{necessary for the}} understanding of the subject matter sought to be patented), but does not require formal patent claims, inventors' oaths or declarations, or any information disclosure statement (IDS). Furthermore, because no examination of the patentability of the application in view of the prior art is performed, the USPTO fee for filing a provisional patent application is significantly lower ($65 - $260 as of March 1, 2017) than the fee required to file a standard non-provisional patent application. A {{provisional application}} can establish an early effective filing date in one or more continuing patent applications later claiming the priority date of an invention disclosed in earlier provisional applications by {{one or more of the}} same inventors.|$|E
