5|$|There is {{much debate}} amongst historians about Henry's {{accession}}, {{in part because}} some {{see it as a}} cause of the Wars of the Roses. For many historians, the accession by force of the throne broke principles the Plantagenets had established successfully over two and a half centuries and allowed any magnate with sufficient power and Plantagenet blood to have ambitions to assume the throne. Richard had attempted to disinherit Henry and remove him from the succession. In response Henry’s legal advisors, led by William Thirning, dissuaded Henry from claiming the throne by right of conquest and instead look for legal justification. Although Henry established a committee to investigate his assertion that his mother had legitimate rights through descent from Edmund Crouchback, whom he said was the elder son of Henry III of England but was set aside because of deformity, no evidence was found. The eight-year-old Edmund Mortimer, Earl of March, was the <b>heir</b> <b>general</b> to Richard II by being the grandson of Edward III's second son, Lionel of Antwerp, 1st Duke of Clarence, and also the son of Richard's last nominated heir. In desperation, Henry's advisors made the case that Henry was heir male to Henry III and this was supported by thirteenth-century entails. Mortimer's sister Anne de Mortimer married Richard of Conisburgh, 3rd Earl of Cambridge, son of Edward III's fourth son Edmund of Langley, consolidating Anne's place in the succession with that of the more junior House of York. As a child Mortimer was not considered a serious contender and as an adult he showed no interest in the throne, instead loyally serving the House of Lancaster. Mortimer informed Henry V when Conisburgh, in what was later called the Southampton Plot, attempted to place him on the throne instead of Henry's newly crowned sontheir mutual cousinleading to the execution of Conisburgh and the other plotters.|$|E

500|$|At the {{arrangement}} {{of his father and}} Cardinal Beaufort in 1434, he married on or before 25 June 1435, Eleanor Poynings (c.1422– 11 February 1484), de jure suo jure Lady Poynings, daughter and heiress of Sir Richard Poynings of Poynings in Sussex, by his second wife, Eleanor Berkeley, daughter of Sir John Berkeley of Beverston Castle in Gloucestershire. She was <b>heir</b> <b>general</b> in 1446 to her grandfather, Robert Poynings, 4th Baron Poynings, to the Lordship of Poynings, with lands across the south of England. He was summoned to Parliament from 14 December 1446 to 26 May 1455, by writs directed Henrico de Percy, chivaler, domino de Ponynges. His wife was a legatee in the 1455 will of her mother, Eleanor, Countess of Arundel (widow of the thirteenth Earl of Arundel). They had one son and three daughters: ...|$|E
2500|$|On his father's side, Richard had a {{claim to}} the throne in a direct male line of descent from his {{grandfather}} Edmund of Langley, 1st Duke of York (1341–1402), fourth surviving son of King Edward III. Should the legitimate male line of the House of Lancaster fail, this particular ancestry (agnatic primogeniture) could make Richard (as prince of blood) the next person in line to inherit the kingdom, even though his mother's descent already arguably gave him a better claim anyway. His adoption of the surname [...] "Plantagenet" [...] in 1448 would serve to emphasize this point. Richard of York was both Edward III's <b>heir</b> <b>general</b> and Henry VI's heir male, through {{his mother and father}} respectively, which made him a strong candidate to the throne of England.|$|E
2500|$|John Russell {{was born}} ca. 1485 {{probably}} at Berwick-by-Swyre, Dorset, {{the son of}} Sir James Russell (d. Nov. 1505) and his first wife Alice Wise, daughter of Thomas Wise of Sidenham, near Tavistock, Devon. James's father was possibly Sir William Russell, but more likely his brother John Russell (d. pre November, 1505) by his wife Alice Froxmere, daughter of John Froxmere of Droitwich, Worcs. John {{was the son of}} Sir Henry Russell (d. 1463/4), and Elizabeth Herring, daughter of John Herring of Chaldon Herring. Henry, great-grandfather of the 1st Earl, was a substantial wine merchant and shipper, who represented Weymouth in the House of Commons four times. The Russell pedigree can only be traced back with certainty to Henry Russell's father, Sir Stephen Russell, the evidence being contained in a deed of April 1440 in which Henry Russell made over to his daughter Christina and her husband Walter Cheverell of Chauntemarle, a tenement in Dorchester to be held of himself and his heirs upon rent of a red rose. In the deed Henry referred to himself as son and heir of Sir Stephen Russell and of Alice his wife. This Alice appears to have been the <b>heir</b> <b>general</b> of the De la Tour family, which had long owned Berwick-by-Swyre, and by whom therefore the manor was brought into the Russell family. Both Sir Henry and Sir Stephen were referred to as Gascoigne as well as Russell, possibly due to their wine trade with France, as in a 1442 pardon under the Privy Seal referring to Henry Russell of Weymouth, merchant, alias Henry Gascoign, gentleman. It was long believed in the noble Russell family, certainly by the 2nd Earl of Bedford, that the family was descended from the ancient family of Russell of Kingston Russell in Dorset, three miles northeast of Berwick, which descent was declared unproven by Gladys Scott Thomson in her Two Centuries of Family History, London, 1930, an exhaustive and scholarly work on the early pedigree of the Earls of Bedford.

50|$|The 10th Baron {{was created}} Viscount Cahir and Earl of Glengall. The titles of Viscount and Earl became extinct {{on the death}} of the second Earl in 1858.

50|$|Under {{the terms}} of the attainder, Castlehaven {{forfeited}} his English barony of Audley, created for <b>heirs</b> <b>general,</b> but retained his Irish earldom and barony since it was an entailed honour protected by the statute De Donis.

50|$|At this point, {{the precise}} legal {{situation}} becomes debatable. As Cokayne points out, abeyance {{is merely a}} modern rule that approximates medieval practice. However, in applying the modern rule, both titles descend to <b>heirs</b> <b>general,</b> which left them in abeyance between the daughters of Sir Owen West, and this situation persists {{to the present day}} with their respective heirs.|$|R

50|$|Most of the estates went to {{the heir}} male with {{remainder}} to the <b>heir</b> <b>general</b> while the peerage went to Richard Fiennes in right of his wife. Peerage lawyers have claimed that Richard Fiennes’s summons to parliament created a new barony; for, though his wife was a peeress in her own right, his summons was not a courtesy one. J. Horace Round held that the award of 1473 assigning the <b>heir</b> <b>general</b> and her husband precedence of the old barony, over that of the heir male, was a recognition of his wife’s accession to the original barony.|$|E

5000|$|The dukedom is {{the only}} one in the United Kingdom that can still pass through a female line.

5000|$|The Law Lords on the Privy Council decided [...] "the grant {{being by}} letters patent under the Great Seal of England, such right would descend {{according}} to the Common Law of England to the <b>heirs</b> <b>general,</b> {{and not to the}} heirs male", and the island was therefore awarded to Ferdinando's daughters; whereupon William agreed to purchase their several shares and interests.|$|R
50|$|Another {{example of}} a base fee is an estate {{descendible}} to <b>heirs</b> <b>general,</b> but terminable on an uncertain event; for example, a grant of land to A and his heirs, tenants of the manor of Dale.

50|$|The {{most famous}} error {{made by the}} House of Lords in {{awarding}} a title {{was not in the}} case of a barony, but for the Scottish earldom of Mar which was awarded to a distant collateral heir male of a previous earl, and not to the <b>heir</b> <b>general,</b> as customary under Scottish peerage law. This 1875 Committee finding declared that a separate Scottish earldom with remainder to heirs male had been created in 1565, and in 1885 an Act of Parliament revived the ancient title for the <b>heir</b> <b>general.</b> As a result, there are two peers holding the Mar title today; the Countess of Mar (holder of the oldest surviving Scottish peerage) and the Earl of Mar and Kellie.|$|E

50|$|After Yolande's {{death in}} 1499, the de jure rights of Jerusalem and Cyprus were {{lost to the}} Savoy family.

In 1713, Charles's great-great-great-grandson Victor Amadeus II of Savoy {{received}} confirmation to that title from the Kings of Spain and France, who also claimed it. The rights, according to succession of <b>heirs</b> <b>general,</b> i.e. not excluding female lines, had gone, until Charles's death, to the House of La Trémoille, the French lords of La Tremoille, Princes of Talmond and Taranto.|$|R
5000|$|By 1437, all {{the male}} {{descendants}} of Elizabeth Mure had been executed, or had otherwise died, {{except for the}} king himself, James II, leaving only the <b>heirs</b> <b>general.</b> Robert II had married Elizabeth Mure {{in a manner that}} was considered uncanonical, making the legitimacy of his children by her questionable.
