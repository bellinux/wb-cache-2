500|$|Livingstone {{describes}} himself as a socialist. In 1987, he stated that [...] "politics is my religion. It's my moral framework. I believe a socialist society is inherently the best thing, and that's like an act of faith." [...] In 2007, he stated that [...] "I still believe one day that the idea that the main means of production are owned by private individuals... will be considered as anti-democratic as the idea serfs could be tied to the land. But <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> alive when that day comes." [...] Livingstone had always worked towards a unified socialist front on the British left, and disliked the tendency towards splintering and forming rival factions, usually over issues of political theory, among the socialist community. Although rejecting Marxism, throughout his political career he has worked alongside Marxist far-left groups and has become involved with the [...] "politics of the street". He has not worked with those Marxist groups, such as the Socialist Workers Party and the Revolutionary Communist Party, who advocate the destruction of the Labour Party as the way forward for socialism, seeing their beliefs as incompatible with his own. Livingstone has consistently opposed the actions of the Israeli government. In a 2005 interview {{he said that he was}} not against the existence of Israel, but rather Ariel Sharon's government; he recalled that on his 1986 visit to the country he got on well with its left-wing politicians.|$|E

2500|$|On October 20, 2015, Webb {{announced}} his {{withdrawal from the}} Democratic primaries, and explored a potential Independent run.

[...] On October 23, Chafee withdrew, stating that he hoped for [...] "an end to the endless wars {{and the beginning of}} a new era for the United States and humanity". On November 2, after failing to qualify for the second DNC-sanctioned debate after adoption of a rule change negated polls which before might have necessitated his inclusion in the debate, Lessig withdrew as well, narrowing the field to Clinton, O'Malley, and Sanders.|$|E

2500|$|Leitch {{argued that}} Bevin tended {{to make a}} bad {{situation}} worse by making ill-chosen abrasive remarks. Bevin was undeniably a plain-spoken man, some of whose remarks struck many as insensitive. Critics have {{accused him of being}} anti-Semitic. One remark which caused particular anger was made when President Truman was pressing Britain to immediately admit 100,000 Jewish refugees, survivors of the Holocaust who wanted to immigrate to Palestine. Bevin told a Labour Party meeting that American pressure to admit Jews was being applied because [...] "There has been agitation in the United States, and particularly in New York, for 100,000 Jews to be put in Palestine. I hope <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> misunderstood in America if I say that this was proposed by the purest of motives. They did not want too many Jews in New York." ...|$|E

In May 2006, Pullman said of a version of the script that [...] "all the important scenes are there and will have their full value"; in March 2008, he said of the finished film that [...] "a lot of things about it were good....

During the 2013 MTV VMAs pre-show, the four remaining members of Danity Kane announced that they were reuniting, returning on their own terms without Diddy. They announced that a single would be released soon titled [...] "Rage", produced by The Stereotypes, the same producers who were responsible for Danity Kane's biggest single to date, [...] "Damaged". Original group member D. Woods did not take part in the reunion. Although no reason was given for the absence, she has stated: [...] "It has been brought to my attention that my former group members of Danity Kane will be reuniting and while <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> a part of the reunion, I wish the ladies blessings and much success on their endeavors." ...|$|E

2500|$|Conducător Antonescu thought Hitler {{willing to}} revise his stance on Northern Transylvania, and {{claimed to have}} {{obtained}} the German leader's agreement, using it to justify participation on the Eastern Front after the recovery of Bessarabia. However, transcripts of the Hitler-Antonescu conversations do not validate his interpretation. Another version has it that Hitler sent Antonescu a letter informing him that Bessarabia's political status still ultimately depended on German decisions. In one of his letters to Hitler, Antonescu himself stated his anti-communist ideological motivation: [...] "I confirm that I will pursue operations in the east to the end against that great enemy of civilization, of Europe, and of my country: Russian Bolshevism [...] <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> swayed by anyone not to extend this military cooperation into new territory." [...] Antonescu's ideological perspective blended national sentiment with generically Christian and particularly Romanian Orthodox traits. British historian Arnold D. Harvey writes that while this ideology seems a poor match with Nazi doctrine, especially its anti-religious elements, [...] "It seems that Hitler was not even perturbed by the militant Christian orientation of the Antonescu regime".|$|E
2500|$|On {{the night}} of 23 April 1975, Ham {{received}} a phone call from the United States, telling him that all his money had disappeared. Later that night he met Tom Evans and they went to The White Hart Pub in Surrey together, where Ham drank ten whiskies. Evans drove him home at three o'clock on the morning of 24 April 1975. Ham hanged himself in his garage studio in Woking later that morning. His suicide note—addressed to his girlfriend, Anne Herriot, and her son, Blair—blamed Polley for much of his despair and inability to cope with his disappointments in life. The note read: [...] "Anne, I love you. Blair, I love you. <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> allowed to love and trust everybody. This is better. Pete. P.S. Stan Polley is a soulless bastard. I will take him with me". Ham had shown growing signs of mental illness over the past months, with Gibbins remembering Ham burning cigarettes on his hands and arms. He was cremated at the Morriston Crematorium, Swansea; his ashes were spread in the memorial gardens. Ham's daughter, Petera, was born one month after his death. [...] In May, Warner Bros terminated its contract with Badfinger, and Badfinger dissolved. [...] Around that time, Apple also deleted all of Badfinger's albums from its catalogue.|$|E
