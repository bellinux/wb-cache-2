25|$|Intumescent firestops {{are often}} used, {{in the event}} plastic pipes are used for toilet drains, so that the melting plastic pipe is choked off {{in the event of}} an {{accidental}} fire. It is, however, customary to fill the metallic <b>drain</b> <b>pipe</b> annulus with rockwool packing. Even with the best of intentions, it would be difficult for the firestopper to install a sealant, because the installer is not allowed to remove the flange, which is partially used to support the <b>drain</b> <b>pipe</b> below during the installation process.|$|E
25|$|Toilets in {{multi-story}} buildings, {{located on}} fire-resistance rated floors typically require {{at least two}} through-penetrations, which can compromise the rating of the floor if left untreated. One opening is for the fresh water supply to flush and/or fill the water tank. The other through-penetration is for the <b>drain</b> <b>pipe.</b> The fresh water supply line requires routine firestopping. The <b>drain</b> <b>pipe,</b> however, is exempt from firestopping in many building codes, particularly when noncombustible piping is used, because the penetration terminates on the unexposed side in a ceramic bowl filled with water, which can withstand significant fires.|$|E
25|$|A typical {{flush toilet}} is a vitreous, ceramic bowl {{containing}} water, plus plumbing to rapidly {{fill it with}} more water. The water in the toilet bowl is connected to a hollow <b>drain</b> <b>pipe</b> shaped like an upside-down U connecting the drain. One side of the U channel is arranged as a hollow siphon tube longer than {{the water in the}} bowl is high. The siphon tube connects to the drain. The top of the upside-down U-shaped <b>drain</b> <b>pipe</b> limits the height of the water in the bowl before it flows down the drain. If water is poured slowly into the bowl it simply flows over the rim of the upside-down U and pours slowly down the drain—thus the toilet does not flush. The standing water in the bowl acts as a barrier to sewer gas coming out of the sewer through the drain, and also as a receptacle for waste. Sewer gas is vented through a separate vent pipe attached to the sewer line.|$|E

25|$|The <b>drain</b> <b>pipes</b> from {{waterless}} urinals need to {{be installed}} correctly in terms of diameter, slope and pipe materials {{in order to prevent}} buildup of struvite ("urine stone") and calcium phosphate precipitates in the pipes, which would cause blockages and could require expensive repairs. Also, the undiluted urine is corrosive to metals (except for stainless steel), which is why plastic pipes are generally preferred for urine <b>drain</b> <b>pipes.</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{mole plough}} allows {{underdrainage}} {{to be installed}} without trenches, or it breaks up deep impermeable soil layers that impede drainage. It is a very deep plough, with a torpedo-shaped or wedge-shaped tip, and a narrow blade connecting this to the body. When dragged through the ground, it leaves a channel deep under the ground, and this acts as a drain. Modern mole ploughs may also bury a flexible perforated plastic <b>drain</b> <b>pipe</b> as they go, making a more permanent drain– {{or they may be}} used to lay pipes for water supply or other purposes. Similar machines, so called pipe-and-cable-laying ploughs, are even used under the sea, for the laying of cables, as well as preparing the earth for side-scan sonar in a process used in oil exploration.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two types}} of {{underground}} dams: a sub-surface and a sand-storage dam. A sub-surface dam is built across an aquifer or drainage route from an impervious layer (such as solid bedrock) up to just below the surface. They can be constructed of a variety of materials to include bricks, stones, concrete, steel or PVC. Once built, the water stored behind the dam raises the water table and is then extracted with wells. A sand-storage dam is a weir built in stages across a stream or wadi. It must be strong, as floods will wash over its crest. Over time, sand accumulates in layers behind the dam, which helps store water and, most importantly, prevent evaporation. The stored water can be extracted with a well, through the dam body, or by means of a <b>drain</b> <b>pipe.</b>|$|E

25|$|On {{the night}} of 2 November 1952, Derek Bentley and Christopher Craig set out {{to break into the}} {{confectionery}} manufacturers Barlow & Parker in Croydon. Bentley and Craig were spotted climbing up a <b>drain</b> <b>pipe</b> {{to gain access to the}} roof by a member of the public, who called the police. The first officer to arrive on scene was Detective Sergeant Frederick Fairfax; by this time both Bentley and Craig had hidden behind the lift shaft. DS Fairfax gained entry to the roof and apprehended Bentley, but while doing so was shot in the shoulder by Craig. Upon armed uniformed officers arriving, Constable Sidney Miles was shot dead by Craig. After trial, Bentley was sentenced to death and Craig to be remanded at Her Majesty's Pleasure. For DS Fairfax's role in the incident, he received a George Cross, as did Constables Norman Harrison and James McDonald. Constable Robert Jaggs was awarded the British Empire Medal, with Sidney Miles awarded a posthumous Queen's Police Medal for Gallantry.|$|E
500|$|In 2003, {{the creator}} of the Case Closed series, Gosho Aoyama, had stated he would draw a story arc taking place in London.

During his trip, Aoyama took special note of a phone booth near Big Ben and a <b>drain</b> <b>pipe,</b> engraved with the words [...] "Valley of Fear", on the Westminster Bridge; these two aspects were used in the story. While creating the story, Aoyama expressed difficulty incorporating English in the text. He also revealed Minerva Glass, a fictional tennis player in the story, was based on professional tennis player Steffi Graf and the scene where Conan calls out to Minerva during her tennis match was inspired by an event during the 1996 Wimbledon Championships where a fan jokingly shouted his proposal to Graf during her semi-finals match.

500|$|The {{most common}} form of the flame fougasse was the safety fougasse. This design allowed the {{propelling}} charge to be stored separately until needed. The safety fougasse was constructed as follows: a small section was excavated from the side of a slope, leaving a shallow platform of earth, and a barrel of incendiary mixture was placed horizontally in a low position with one round face pointing towards the target. At the back, a section of stove or <b>drain</b> <b>pipe</b> was placed vertically against the rear face of the barrel. The lower end of the pipe was blocked off with a thin cover and positioned a few inches above the bottom of the barrel. The top of the pipe was fitted with a loose cap to keep water out. This pipe is what makes it a [...] "safety" [...] fougasse because it allows later installation of the propelling charge. Soil was then built up over the weapon until all that could be seen were the front disk of the barrel and top of the pipe.|$|E

40|$|Reinforced {{concrete}} columns concealing PVC <b>drain</b> water <b>pipe</b> {{have been}} used widely {{in the construction of}} multi storey buildings. The purpose of the investigation is to study thedeficiencies caused in the strength and load carrying capacity of these columns through experimental and numerical analyses. A total number of 28 columns have been cast and only the appropriate ones which were without defects, have been tested under the axial compressive load. An approximate method of alignment for constructed columns has been developed and the alignment of the alignment of the columns has been carried out before their testing. The study shows these columns have huge reduction in their load carryingcapacities. The investigation showed that concealing <b>drain</b> <b>pipes</b> inside these columns had significant effects on their strength and mode of failure. Three-dimensional finite element analysis of the above mentioned columns have also been carried out to investigate the effects of <b>drain</b> <b>pipes</b> on load carrying capacities of the columns. The numerical investigation predicts higher factors of safety than the experimental results. In conculsions, the factors of safety obtained from experimental study shows that, the performance of the columns are in a critical level and could be hazardous to the safety of the building. Therefore, an improved method of positioning the <b>drain</b> <b>pipes</b> outside the columns as well as the replacement of the PVC pipes by steel has been proposed. ...|$|R

Mansur frequently threatened to execute Salih, who upon being informed of these threats, escaped the citadel. According to the versions of medieval chroniclers, Salih managed to cut one of his shackles and make a hole in his cell wall. Then, on the night of 3 July 1014, he jumped from the wall of the citadel with one shackle still attached to his leg and hid in a <b>drain</b> <b>pipe</b> {{for the remainder of the}} night until re-joining his tribesmen at their encampment in Marj Dabiq.

2500|$|A typical {{flush toilet}} is a ceramic bowl (pan) {{connected}} on the [...] "up" [...] side to a cistern (tank) that enables rapid filling with water, {{and on the}} [...] "down" [...] side to a <b>drain</b> <b>pipe</b> that removes the effluent. When a toilet is flushed, the sewage should flow into a septic tank or into a system connected to a sewage treatment plant.

2500|$|If {{clogging}} occurs, it {{is usually}} the result of an attempt to flush unsuitable items, or too much toilet paper. Flushing of large amounts of hair should also be avoided. However, clogging can occur spontaneously due to limescale fouling of the <b>drain</b> <b>pipe,</b> or by overloading the stool capacity of the toilet. Stool capacity varies among toilet designs and is based {{on the size of the}} drainage pipe, the capacity of the water tank, the velocity of a flush, and the method by which the water attempts to vacate the bowl of its contents. The size and consistency of the stool is also a contributing, but hard-to-predict factor.|$|E
