When he returns with the welts all over his throat, George Vincent slams the door and takes them all hostage, leaving Mulder {{to die in the}} hallway. Angela goes into labor and Scully finds herself forced to deliver a baby. However, water collects in the light fixture above them and the creature appears. It grabs George Vincent by the neck. Scully tells Walter Suarez to aim for the sprinklers, realizing that the freshwater kept the creature at bay, as with the deputy until <b>Epsom</b> <b>salt</b> was added to the water. Suarez shoots the sprinklers and saves Vincent's life. Meanwhile, Mulder realizes that freshwater is the key also, and runs out into the rain to heal his wounds.|$|E

25|$|Because {{magnesium}} is {{a mobile}} nutrient, magnesium chloride can be effectively {{used as a}} substitute for magnesium sulfate (<b>Epsom</b> <b>salt)</b> to help correct magnesium deficiency in plants via foliar feeding. It is advisable to use a smaller dose when using magnesium chloride compared to the recommended dose of magnesium sulfate (20 g/L). This is due primarily to the chlorine present in magnesium chloride, which can easily reach toxic levels if over-applied and/or applied too often.|$|E
2500|$|Mild to {{moderate}} cases are often treated conservatively {{with warm water}} and <b>epsom</b> <b>salt</b> soaks, antibacterial ointment {{and the use of}} dental floss. If conservative treatment of a minor ingrown toenail does not succeed, or if the ingrown toenail is severe, surgical treatment may be required. A [...] "gutter splint" [...] may be improvised by slicing a cotton-tipped wooden applicator diagonally to form a bevel and using this to insert a wisp of cotton from the applicator head under the nail to lift it from the underlying skin after a foot soak.|$|E
2500|$|Salt (sodium chloride) is soluble {{and is used}} {{to enhance}} the taste of food. Substances with similar {{properties}} {{came to be known}} as salts, in particular <b>Epsom</b> <b>salt</b> (magnesium sulfate, found in a bitter saline spring in the English town of Epsom). Lead acetate was called sugar of lead. However, other names like sugar of lead (lead(II) acetate), butter of antimony (antimony trichloride), oil of vitriol (sulfuric acid), and cream of tartar (potassium bitartrate) borrowed their language from the kitchen. Many more names were based on color; for example, [...] hematite, orpiment, and verdigris come from words meaning [...] "blood-like stone", [...] "gold pigment", and [...] "green of Greece".|$|E

2500|$|The {{discovery}} of Wyandotte Cave by European settlers {{is believed to}} have occurred around 1798. [...] Shortly thereafter Wyandotte Cave became known as an excellent source of saltpeter, an integral component of gunpowder, and of Epsom salts, which have medical uses. [...] Saltpeter mining in the cave reached a peak under a {{man by the name of}} Dr. Benjamin Adams during the War of 1812. [...] Modern tours feature Dr. Adams' vats and hoppers, and point out where magnesium sulfate (the chemical name of <b>Epsom</b> <b>salt)</b> is visible as a glittery substance lining the cave walls. [...] The cave was also used to store supplies for the army of William Henry Harrison.|$|E
50|$|Anhydrous {{magnesium}} sulfate {{is used as}} a drying agent. The anhydrous form is hygroscopic (readily absorbs water from the air) and is therefore difficult to weigh accurately; the hydrate is often preferred when preparing solutions (for example, in medical preparations). <b>Epsom</b> <b>salt</b> has been traditionally used as a component of bath salts. <b>Epsom</b> <b>salt</b> can also be used as a beauty product. Athletes use it to soothe sore muscles, while gardeners use it to improve crops. It has a variety of other uses: for example, <b>Epsom</b> <b>salt</b> is also effective in the removal of splinters.|$|E

50|$|Two {{compounds}} {{used for}} such purposes are <b>Epsom</b> <b>salts</b> and EDTA. <b>Epsom</b> <b>salts</b> reduces the internal resistance in a weak or damaged battery and may allow {{a small amount of}} extended life. EDTA can be used to dissolve the sulfate deposits of heavily discharged plates. However, the dissolved material is then no longer available to participate in the normal charge/discharge cycle, so a battery temporarily revived with EDTA will have a reduced life expectancy. Residual EDTA in the lead-acid cell forms organic acids which will accelerate corrosion of the lead plates and internal connectors.|$|R

5000|$|In 1934, Arthur Hirschfelder and his {{technician}} Victor Haury researched on the <b>epsom</b> <b>salt</b> purgation in nephritis. Their {{results indicated}} that when a person without injured kidneys ingested <b>epsom</b> <b>salt,</b> despite the amount of magnesium absorbed into the body, the concentration of magnesium in the blood remained unaffected and in the normal range (1.8-2.5 mg). However, in nephritic patients, the magnesium excreted by the kidneys is lower than normal and therefore produces an exponential increase in plasma magnesium, magnesium in the blood when a single dose of <b>epsom</b> <b>salt</b> is ingested. If the plasma magnesium level is to exceed 17 mg per hundred cubic centimeters of blood, the patient will fall into a coma. In their study on animals, {{results indicated that}} those with a slightly raised plasma magnesium level (5 or more mg) are more sensitive to normal doses of morphine. Hirschfelder states that that is why Dr. Osler said, [...] "in severe nephritics and very old persons morphine should be given with caution".|$|E
