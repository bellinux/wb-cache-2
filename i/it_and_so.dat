5|$|After {{the second}} lacuna, Hymir {{is sitting in}} the boat, unhappy and totally silent, as they row back to shore. On shore, Hymir {{suggests}} that Thor should help him carry a whale back to his farm. Thor picks both the boat and the whales up, and carries it all back to Hymir's farm. After Thor successfully smashes a crystal goblet by throwing it at Hymir's head on Týr's mother's suggestion, Thor and Týr are given the cauldron. Týr cannot lift it, but Thor manages to roll <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> <b>so</b> with it they leave. Some distance from Hymir's home, an army of many-headed beings led by Hymir attacks the two, but are killed by the hammer of Thor. Although one of his goats is lame in the leg, the two manage to bring the cauldron back, have plenty of ale, and so, from then on, return to Ægir's for more every winter.|$|E
5|$|Following the French {{surrender}} on 22 June, the French fleet {{was to be}} disarmed under German and Italian supervision, {{under the}} terms of the Armistice. The British high command, however, was concerned that the French ships would be seized by the Axis powers and placed in service. The Axis navies would then outnumber the British Royal Navy. Prime Minister Winston Churchill therefore ordered Vice Admiral James Somerville, the commander of Force H, to neutralise the French fleet at Mers-el-Kébir. He was instructed to order the French vessels to join the British with the Free French, surrender for internment, to scuttle themselves, or be sunk. On 3 July, Somerville arrived and delivered the ultimatum; the French rejected <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> <b>so</b> the British ships opened fire.|$|E
5|$|However, his {{re-instatement}} {{was short}} lived, as the navigation ceased {{to operate in}} January 1869, the last month in which tolls were collected. Mortgages of £19,708 were outstanding, of which £2,607 dated from the original construction by Pyott. A plan to buy the waterway by J. R. Stebbings of Southampton in 1871 fell through. A further attempt to buy the navigation was made in 1909 by Patrick O'Carroll, an estate agent from Southsea. He created a company called the Itchen Navigation Ltd, with a capital of £20,000, but {{they were unable to}} establish who owned <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> <b>so</b> the company never traded.|$|E

5|$|In 1979, Swiss {{publisher}} Faksimile-Verlag Luzern requested {{permission to}} produce a full-colour facsimile of the book. Permission was initially denied, because Trinity College officials felt {{that the risk of}} damage to the book was too high. By 1986, Faksimile-Verlag had developed a process that used gentle suction to straighten a page so that it could be photographed without touching <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>so</b> won permission to publish a new facsimile. After each page was photographed, a single-page facsimile was prepared so the colours could be carefully compared to the original and adjustments made where necessary. The completed work was published in 1990 in a two-volume set containing the full facsimile and scholarly commentary. One copy is held by the Anglican Church in Kells, {{on the site of the}} original monastery.|$|E
5|$|Sargent's break {{came when}} Sir Henry Wood visited De Montfort Hall, Leicester, early in 1921 with the Queen's Hall orchestra. As it was {{customary}} to commission a piece {{from a local}} composer, Wood invited Sargent to write a piece entitled Impression on a Windy Day. Sargent completed the work too late for Wood to {{have enough time to}} learn <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> <b>so</b> Wood called on Sargent to conduct the first performance himself. Wood recognised not only the worth of the piece but also Sargent's talent as a conductor and gave him the chance to make his debut conducting the work at Wood's annual season of promenade concerts, generally known as the Proms, in the Queen's Hall on 11 October of the same year.|$|E
5|$|Swan had {{no respect}} for Heath and was not afraid to show <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> <b>so</b> Heath kept Swan's {{appearances}} to a minimum in 1996–97. He offered loan moves to Third Division Hartlepool United and Hereford United, offers which Swan dismissed out of hand, and so Heath placed him on the transfer list. The transfer took until August 1997, at which point {{he moved on to}} Bury for a fee of £50,000 – this reunited him with manager Stan Ternent. The move had been delayed after Heath left Burnley to be replaced by Chris Waddle, though Waddle quickly sanctioned the transfer. Ternent moved Swan back to his role as a striker, despite the player having been used exclusively as a defender at his last few clubs. He scored six goals in his first twelve games before hitting a fifteen-game goal drought. He helped the club to narrowly avoid relegation {{at the end of the}} season.|$|E

25|$|PIE voiced {{aspirated}} consonants (*bʰ, *dʰ, *gʰ, *ǵʰ) {{merge into}} the voiced consonants (*b, *d, *g, *ǵ). This also occurred {{in several other}} Indo-European branches, but as Winter's law was sensitive {{to the difference between}} the two types of consonants, the merger must have happened after <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>so</b> is a specific Balto-Slavic innovation.|$|E
25|$|To the {{surprise}} of many, Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri, who had vehemently opposed this amendment, appeared to have finally accepted <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> <b>so</b> did most of his party. However, he ended up resigning in protest against the amendment. He was assassinated soon afterwards (see below), triggering the Cedar Revolution. This amendment comes in discordance with the UN Security Council Resolution 1559, which called for a new presidential election in Lebanon.|$|E

25|$|The same divine {{agencies}} {{who caused}} disease or harm {{also had the}} power to avert <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> <b>so</b> might be placated in advance. Divine consideration might be sought to avoid the inconvenient delays of a journey, or encounters with banditry, piracy and shipwreck, with due gratitude to be rendered on safe arrival or return. In times of great crisis, the Senate could decree collective public rites, in which Rome's citizens, including women and children, moved in procession from one temple to the next, supplicating the gods.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, Scotus {{said that}} Mary was {{redeemed}} {{in anticipation of}} Christ's death on the cross. This {{was similar to the}} way that the Church explained the Last Supper, since Roman Catholic theology teaches that the Mass is the sacrifice of Calvary made present on the altar, and Christ did not die before the Last Supper. Scotus' defence of the immaculist thesis was summed up by one of his followers as potuit, decuit ergo fecit – God could do it, it was fitting that He did <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> <b>so</b> He did it.|$|E
25|$|Certainly by the 6th centuryBC, {{the city}} was known everywhere, and was readily {{accessible}} via land-sea routes reaching the Levant to the Arab and Ethiopian traders feeding goods westwards to the Egyptians, Greeks, Persians, Western Romans, Carthaginians, and eventually, the Eastern Roman Empires, and the Republic of Venice. It is likely even the Phoenicians knew of <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>so</b> it has acted since antiquity as a link port to the luxury goods trade from the Far East and {{the interior of the}} Indian sub-continent to the civilisations of South-west Asia, the Middle-East, the Mediterranean basin including Northern Africa and Europe.|$|E

25|$|Traffic on {{the canal}} was never {{particularly}} heavy, for even in October 1821, when the canal was most prosperous, {{there were only}} about nine laden boats per day using it. Despite this, water supply was a regular problem. When first built, the canal was supplied by a reservoir at Shipley, constructed by building a dam across the valley {{at the end of}} the canal. The resultant lake provided an attractive feature for Shipley Hall, but flooded the coach road which provided access to <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> <b>so</b> a new bridge and road across the top of the dam were constructed. The reservoir was further topped up by a feeder from the stream above Hawley's Pond.|$|E
25|$|Hedgehog has {{roles in}} larval body segment {{development}} and in formation of adult appendages. During {{the formation of}} body segments in the developing Drosophila embryo, stripes of cells that synthesize the transcription factor engrailed can also express the cell-to-cell signaling protein Hedgehog (green in Figure 4). Hedgehog is not free to move very far from the cells that make <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>so</b> it only activates a thin stripe of cells adjacent to the engrailed-expressing cells. When acting in this local fashion, hedgehog works as a paracrine factor. Only cells {{to one side of}} the engrailed-expressing cells are competent to respond to Hedgehog following interaction of Hh with the receptor protein Patched (blue in Figure 4).|$|E
25|$|In 1827, Stephen Ballard {{became the}} new clerk of the company, and {{produced}} a report on how to complete the canal in 1829. In 1838, he proposed a new route for the final section, but the engineer James Walker advised against <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> <b>so</b> in May 1839, a new Act of Parliament was obtained, allowing the company {{to raise the money}} to complete the canal. Work started on 17 November. A feeder from the River Frome to the summit level was completed in August 1842, and the canal opened in stages as it was completed, with extensions to Canon Frome wharf in January 1843, Whithington wharf in February 1844, and finally to Hereford basin on 22 May 1845.|$|E

25|$|Eridanus is {{connected}} to the myth of Phaethon, who took over the reins of his father Helios' sky chariot (i.e., the Sun), but didn't have the strength to control <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>so</b> veered wildly in different directions, scorching both Earth and heaven. Zeus intervened by striking Phaethon dead with a thunderbolt and casting him to Earth. The constellation {{was supposed to be the}} path Phaethon drove along; in later times, it was considered a path of souls. Since Eridanos was also a Greek name for the Po (Latin Padus), in which the burning body of Phaethon is said by Ovid to have extinguished, the mythic geography of the celestial and earthly Eridanus is complex.|$|E
25|$|Lost Souls {{tells the}} story of The Inspector, a disgraced former police officer who has never been able to forget the last case on which he worked; the {{disappearance}} of an eleven-year-old girl named Amy Haven from the town of Dowerton, Dorset. The Inspector was convinced a vagrant named Mr. Bones had killed Amy, but was unable to prove <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> <b>so</b> planted evidence. However, the local newspaper discovered his ruse, and the case against Bones fell apart. He was released, and Amy's trail went cold. Her parents subsequently blamed The Inspector for the police's failure to find her, and he was fired. Now, on the fifth anniversary of her disappearance, he has come to the abandoned ruins of Dowerton train station and hotel after local children reported seeing Amy in the vicinity.|$|E
25|$|When {{he finally}} finds the Bane, he learns {{that it is}} not an adult monster, as was assumed, but instead a baby whose parents have just died. He can not bring himself to kill <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> <b>so</b> he and Ares take it to be raised by the only {{friendly}} rat they know: Ripred. After this, the two return to Regalia, where Nerissa has just been crowned queen due to the crown princess's apparent death. The flier Andromeda, human Howard, Ares, and Gregor are tried for treason because they failed to kill the Bane. They are saved, though, by Nerissa, who explains how it is good Gregor was not heartless enough to kill a baby. Shortly thereafter, Gregor is trying to finally face the reality of going home without Boots when she is suddenly returned to the palace, having been saved in turn by Luxa, Temp, and an unnamed moth. The two then return to the surface world.|$|E
