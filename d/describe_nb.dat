40|$|Abstract Genes in the Leukocyte Antigen 6 (Ly- 6) {{superfamily}} encode glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchored glycoproteins (gp) with conserved {{domains of}} 70 to 100 amino acids and 8 to 10 cysteine residues. Murine Ly- 6 genes encode important lymphocyte and {{hematopoietic stem cell}} antigens. Recently, a new member of the human Ly- 6 gene superfamily has been described, CD 177. CD 177 is polymorphic and has at least two alleles, PRV- 1 and NB 1. CD 177 was first described as PRV- 1, a gene that is overexpressed in neutrophils from approximately 95 % of patients with polycythemia vera and from about half of patients with essential thrombocythemia. CD 177 encodes NB 1 gp, a 58 – 64 kD GPI gp that is expressed by neutrophils and neutrophil precursors. NB 1 gp carries Human Neutrophil Antigen (HNA) - 2 a. Investigators working to identify the gene encoding NB 1 gp called the CD 177 allele they <b>described</b> <b>NB</b> 1. NB 1 gp is unusual in that neutrophils from some healthy people lack the NB 1 gp completely and in most people NB 1 gp is expressed by a subpopulation of neutrophils. The function of NB 1 gp {{and the role of}} CD 177 in the pathogenesis and clinical course of polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia are not yet known. However, measuring neutrophil CD 177 mRNA levels has become an important marker for diagnosing the myeloproliferative disorders polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia. </p...|$|R

Although recently new insights into genes involved in NB have emerged, the molecular basis of neuroblastoma development and progression still remains poorly understood.

An inverse correlation between HLA class I expression and N-myc amplification and overexpression has been recently <b>described</b> in neuroblastomas (<b>NBs).</b> In this study we have shown that cytokines (recombinant gamma-interferon, recombinant alpha-tumor necrosis factor), differentiation agents (dibutyryl cyclic AMP, phorbol myristate acetate) and growth factors (nerve growth factor, epithelial growth factor) were able to influence the growth rate and surface expression of HLA class I molecules as well as of a tumor-associated antigen on 2 representative NB cell lines. Induced decreased growth rate in NB cells was not always related to decreased N-myc expression. Analysis at the mRNA level revealed that both N-myc and HLA class I RNA steady-state levels could be modulated by several substances, including recombinant gamma-interferon, phorbol myristate acetate, dibutyryl cyclic AMP, and epithelial growth factor and were not necessarily linked. An inverse correlation between N-myc and HLA mRNA levels was observed only after exposure of NB cells to recombinant alpha-tumor necrosis factor.

40|$|Putative living {{entities}} called nanobacteria (NB) are {{unusual for}} their small sizes (50 - 500 nm), pleomorphic nature, and accumulation of hydroxyapatite (HAP), {{and have been}} implicated in numerous diseases involving extraskeletal calcification. By adding precipitating ions to cell culture medium containing serum, mineral nanoparticles are generated that are morphologically and chemically identical to the so-called NB. These nanoparticles are shown here to be formed of amorphous mineral complexes containing calcium {{as well as other}} ions like carbonate, which then rapidly acquire phosphate, forming HAP. The main constituent proteins of serum-derived NB are albumin, fetuin-A, and apolipoprotein A 1, but their involvement appears circumstantial since so-called NB from different body fluids harbor other proteins. Accordingly, by passage through various culture media, the protein composition of these particles can be modulated. Immunoblotting experiments reveal that antibodies deemed specific for NB react in fact with either albumin, fetuin-A, or both, indicating that previous studies using these reagents may have detected these serum proteins from the same as well as different species, with human tissue nanoparticles presumably absorbing bovine serum antigens from the culture medium. Both fetal bovine serum and human serum, used earlier by other investigators as sources of NB, paradoxically inhibit the formation of these entities, and this inhibition is trypsin-sensitive, indicating a role for proteins in this inhibitory process. Fetuin-A, and to a lesser degree albumin, inhibit nanoparticle formation, an inhibition that is overcome with time, ending with formation of the so-called NB. Together, these data demonstrate that NB are most likely formed by calcium or apatite crystallization inhibitors that are somehow overwhelmed by excess calcium or calcium phosphate found in culture medium or in body fluids, thereby becoming seeds for calcification. The structures <b>described</b> earlier as <b>NB</b> may thus represent remnants and by-products of physiological mechanisms used for calcium homeostasis, a concept which explains the vast body of NB literature as well as explains the true origin of NB as lifeless protein-mineralo entities with questionable role in pathogenesis...|$|R

Understanding the mechanisms {{leading to the}} specification of the individual NBs and their progeny requires the identification of their lineages. Here we <b>describe</b> 17 embryonic <b>NB</b> lineages derived from the ventral half of the neuroectoderm and we assign these lineages to identified medial and intermediate NBs. The lineages are composed of interneurons (NB 1 - 2, NB 2 - 1, MP 2, NB 4 - 1, NB 5 - 1, NB 5 - 3, NB 6 - 1, NB 6 - 2, and NB 7 - 2), interneurons and motoneurons (NB 3 - 1, NB 3 - 2, NB 4 - 2, NB 5 - 2, NB 7 - 1, and NB 7 - 3), or interneurons, motoneurons, and glial cells (NB 1 - 1 and NB 2 - 2). NB 1 - 1, NB 2 - 2, and NB 3 - 1 form segment-specific lineages. Neuroectodermal progenitors forming NB 2 - 1, NB 5 - 1, and NB 7 - 3 divide while still in the ectoderm to give rise to an additional epidermoblast. Expression of segmentation genes is not lineal in the clones of NB 1 - 2 and NB 7 - 3 (engrailed), NB 1 - 1, NB 4 - 2, and NB 7 - 1 (even-skipped), and NB 7 - 1 (gooseberry-proximal). The timing of delamination for individual NBs {{as well as the}} number of their progeny is not strictly invariant. The 17 NBs produce about 200 neurons and only three glial cells, corresponding to about 70 % of the estimated total number of neurons and 10 % of the glial cells per thoracic and abdominal hemisegment.

40|$|Abstract: Coexpression for c-Kit {{receptor}} and its ligand {{stem cell}} factor (SCF) has been <b>described</b> in neuroblastoma (<b>NB)</b> cell lines and tumors, suggesting {{the existence of}} an autocrine loop modulating tumor growth. We evaluated c-Kit and SCF expression by immunohistochemistry in a series of 75 primary newly diagnosed neuroblastic tumors. Immunostaining for c-Kit was found in 10 / 75 and for SCF in 17 / 75, with 5 / 10 c-Kit-positive tumors also expressing SCF. For both, c-Kit and SCF staining were predominantly found in the most aggressive subset of tumors, i. e., those amplified for MYCN: c-Kit was detected in 8 / 14 amplified vs. 2 / 61 single copy (p< 0. 001), and SCF in 9 / 14 amplified vs. 8 / 61 single copy tumors (p< 0. 001). Furthermore, the association of c-Kit expression with advanced stage (3 or 4) (p= 0. 001) and of SCF expression with adrenal primary (p= 0. 03) was substantiated. The in vitro activity of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor STI-S 71 (imatinib mesylate, Gleevec, Glivec) on NB cell lines positive or negative for c-Kit was also assessed. When cells were grown in 10 % fetal calf serum, the 4 c-Kit-positive cell lines tested were sensitive to STI- 571 growth inhibition to a different extent (ranging from 30 to 80 %); also the c-Kit-negative cell line GI-CA-N was slightly affected, suggesting that other STI- 571 targets operate in regulating NB proliferation. In addition, c-Kit-positive cell lines SK-N-BE 2 (c) and HTLA 230, grown in SCF only, remained sensitive (40 and 70 % of growth inhibition, respectively), while, in the same conditions, proliferation of the c-Kit-negative cell line GI-CA-N was not affected. Immunoprecipitation of c-Kit from cell lysates of SK-N-BE 2 (c) and HTLA 230 cells grown in SCF and subsequent western blot analysis of the immunoprecipitates revealed a sharp decrease of c-Kit phosphorylation after STI- 571 treatment. These data demonstrate that both c-Kit and SCF are preferentially expressed in vivo in the most aggressive neuroblastic tumors and that their signaling is active in promoting in vitro NB cell proliferation that can be selectively inhibited by treatment with STI- 571.

40|$|In this {{dissertation}} {{is presented}} the synthesis and reactivity of Nb(III) imido complexes {{supported by the}} BDI ligand (BDI = &beta-diketimate). Chapter I. The discovery of a Nb(III) -mediated catalytic hydrogenation of internal alkynes to Z-alkenes is reported and found to proceed through an unprecedented mechanism. The mechanistic proposal involves initial reduction of the alkyne by the Nb(III) complex (BDI) Nb(NtBu) (CO) 2 to provide a Nb(V) metallacyclopropene, itself capable of &sigma-bond metathesis reactivity with H 2. The resulting alkenyl hydride species then undergoes reductive elimination to provide the Z-alkene product and regenerate a metal complex in the Nb(III) oxidation state. Support for the proposed mechanism is derived from i) the dependence of product selectivity on the relative concentrations of CO and H 2, ii) the isolation of complexes closely related to those proposed to lie on the catalytic cycle, iii) H/D crossover experiments, and iv) DFT studies on multiple possible reaction pathways. Chapter II. Monometallic niobium arene complexes [Nb(BDI) (NtBu) (&mu-RC 6 H 5) ] (R = H and Me) were synthesized and were found to slowly converted into the diniobium inverted arene sandwich complexes [[(BDI) Nb(NtBu) ] 2 (&mu-RC 6 H 5) ] (R = H and Me) in solution. The kinetics of this reaction were followed by 1 H NMR spectroscopy, and is in agreement with a dissociative mechanism. These compounds showed a lack of reactivity towards small molecules - even at elevated temperatures - which is unusual in the chemistry of inverted sandwich complexes. However, protonation of the BDI ligands occurred readily on treatment with [H(OEt 2) ][B(C 6 F 5) 4], resulting in the mono-protonated cationic inverted sandwich complex [[(BDI#) Nb(NtBu) ][(BDI) Nb(NtBu) ](&mu-C 6 H 5) ][B(C 6 F 5) 4] and the dicationic complex [[(BDI#) Nb(NtBu) ] 2 (&mu-RC 6 H 5) ][B(C 6 F 5) 4] 2 (BDI# = (ArNC(Me)) 2 CH 2). NMR and UV-vis spectroscopies were used to characterize this unique series of diamagnetic molecules {{as a means of}} determining how best to describe the Nb-arene interactions. The X-ray crystal structures, UV-visible spectra, arene 1 H NMR chemical shifts and large JCH coupling constants provide evidence for donation of electron density from the Nb d-orbitals into the antibonding π system of the arene ligands. However, the lack of sp 3 hybridization of the arene carbon indicate that the Nb-arene donation is not accompanied by an increase in formal oxidation state, and suggest that 4 d 2 electronic configurations are appropriate to <b>describe</b> the <b>Nb</b> atoms in all four complexes. Chapter III. Inverted sandwich complexes have seen interesting recent developments both in the nature of their bonding and in their use as chemical reactants. Although discussions concerning the electronic delocalization lend credit to their use as potential electronic and spintronic devices, mixed valent inverted sandwich complexes are rarely reported. We show in this work that the selective single electron oxidation of a neutral benzene inverted sandwich complex of niobium leads to an isolable cationic mixed valent benzene inverted sandwich complex. The latter complex shows unique structural features elucidated through studies with an arsenal of physical methods, including cyclic voltammetry, 1 H NMR, UV-Vis, magnetism, EPR spectroscopies, in addition to DFT calculations. These analyses indicate that although delocalization is allowed over the benzene ring from both niobium atoms, the single electron is unequally shared between the two metal centres. Under certain conditions, this complex reforms the neutral benzene complex along with a highly reactive Nb(IV) species, which is of great interest for potential chemical reactivity. Chapter IV. All three C-F bonds in CF 3 -substituted arenes are activated by a niobium imido complex, driven by the formation of strong Nb-F bonds. The mechanism of this transformation was studied by NMR spectroscopy which revealed the involvement of Nb(III). Attempts to extend this chemistry to non-aromatic CF 3 groups led to intramolecular reactivity. The mechanism of activation of C-F bonds in fluoroarenes using a well-defined niobium (III) imido complex has been investigated. Chapter V. The Nb(III) arene species [BDI]Nb(NtBu) (C 6 H 6), reacts stoichiometrically with fluoroarenes to yield niobium (V) aryl fluorides. Spectroscopic analysis supported by DFT calculations revealed the critical involvement of a Nb(III) fluoroarene-bound species. In contrast to previous reports of related reactivity, we found that perfluorinated arenes (i. e. those normally assumed to bear more `activated' C-F bonds) are, in the present system, much less reactive towards C-F bond cleavage than mono- or difluoro-substituted arenes. In addition to demonstrating stoichiometric hydrodefluorination reactions, we also describe an efficient and mild hydrodefluorination of mono- and di-fluoroarenes that is catalytic in niobium...|$|R
