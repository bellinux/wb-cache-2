40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to design an intelligent control system for die casting processes involving cooling of a die with multiple channels. The work consists of two parks. First, a correlation between <b>die</b> <b>insert</b> temperature and cooling water outlet temperature is established, {{which can be used}} to deduce local die surface temperatures without destructively inserting thermal sensors into a die from its back. Second, a new on-line thermal management scheme is proposed based on an intelligent real-time monitoring and control system (IRMCS) developed for a <b>die</b> <b>insert</b> containing multiple cooling channels. In this scheme, extra cooling water lines controlled by a pump and solenoid valves are hooked up to each established cooling channel. The system is capable of monitoring temperature signals from the <b>die</b> <b>insert</b> and flow rate signals from the cooling lines {{on the basis of its}} built-in control algorithms. Pump and solenoid valves can be actuated either automatically or manually to introduce additional cooling water to the <b>die</b> <b>insert</b> for preventing <b>die</b> overheating.

40|$|The double-layer {{combined}} die is {{used for}} its longer life in forging. Autofrettage is a well-known elastic–plastic technology that increases the durability of thick-walled cylinders. This study explores an alternative design method of the double-layer combined die using autofrettage theory. An analytical solution for the autofrettage process of the double-layer combined die is obtained based on Lamé's equation. The relationship between the autofrettage pressure and the yield radius of the <b>die</b> <b>insert</b> is obtained, and expressions of residual stresses and displacements, which {{are directly related to}} geometric parameters, material properties and internal pressure, are derived. The finite-element simulation of a specific case is performed, and good agreement between theoretical calculations and simulation results is found. Furthermore, the effects of important parameters, including the ratio of the plastic area and yield strength of the <b>die</b> <b>insert</b> and the outer diameters of the <b>die</b> <b>insert</b> and stress ring, on the autofrettage effect are investigated. Compared with the conventional combined die, the autofrettaged die can bear larger working pressure, as expected.

Hydroforming dies typically have shallow forming channels and open, low curvature surfaces, making them ideally suited for 5 -axis machining. To fully appreciate the benefits and to properly demonstrate the capa-bilities of 5 -axis machining for hydroforming dies, a compari-son of 5 -axis and 3 -axis finish machining was done. Two hydroforming <b>die</b> <b>insert</b> sets were machined on a 5 -axis machine with a tilt/rotary table. The tool paths for 5 -axis machining were generated using custom software based on a modified form of a tool positioning strategy called the principal axis method.

It has been for instance extensively used for mould <b>inserts,</b> <b>die</b> parts, and functional metal prototypes. Another, less explored method, starch consolidation is a pressureless direct casting method which consists principally of mixing powder slurry, casting into moulds, consolidation, drying, and sintering. With a strong focus on both methods, the study here combines several strong material technology sectors; powder, rapid forming, mechanical property testing and surface technology.

40|$|Improving the {{performance}} of the extrusion tools and predicting their life postulates knowledge of their failure mechanisms. In this work, actual failure cases of brass extrusion dies made from stellite 4 B are presented and their mechanisms are studied. It is found that exposed parts of the die suffer from cyclic loading which, in combination with manufacturing defects and design imperfections, promote the initiation of fatigue cracks. Aging during service of stellite 4 B <b>inserts</b> reduces <b>die</b> life due to the formation of a network of brittle carbides surrounding the ductile cobalt dendrites. During extrusion, the M 7 C 3 carbide dissolves in the cobalt matrix leading to precipitation of new M 23 C 6 and η-carbide types. This occurs at relatively low working temperatures, in the range of 600 - 650 °C, instead of 850 - 1100 °C as referred in the resent literature, and is probably assisted by high stresses prevailing during the extrusion process. © 2006 Elsevier B.

Defect {{is one of the}} key quality issues in forming processes. Defect formation can be caused by irrational material flow and unreasonable stress and temperature distribution in billet and tooling. In forging of axisymmetrical flanged parts, folding is a common flow-induced defect. In this study, the mechanisms of folding defect formation and avoidance in forging of axisymmetrical flanged parts are systematically studied via FEM simulation. Based on the simulated material flow behavior, the defect formation mechanism is revealed and an avoidance mechanism through the dynamic change of tooling geometry is proposed. The mechanism is realized by implementation of a sliding <b>insert</b> in <b>die</b> structure to control material flow and further to avoid the formation of folding defect. In addition, the effects of the initial insert position, frictional factor and the spring stiffness of the moving die module on the material flow behavior and deformation load are investigated.
