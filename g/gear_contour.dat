40|$|By {{recent studies}} at Fraunhofer IWU Chemnitz basic {{information}} about the material flow in the rolling process of high gearings have been obtained, which provide the necessary data basis for a systematic adjustment of variable geometry and technology parameters. To use these data as efficiently as possible for subsequent studies a hybrid approach to this problem was chosen. In that case the combination of visioplasticity and FEM simulation. Such a method already used in many fields of manufacturing technologies has advantages {{in the field of}} visioplastic evaluated grid determined deformations and strain parameters according to available plastic theories of Huber, Hencky, Levy or v. Mises, which can be directly applied as boundary conditions for subsequent FEM analysis of the marginal zone of the work piece (<b>gear</b> <b>contour).</b> Results of the first qualitative investigations of this material flow analysis represent the basis for future optimized simulation modeling of gear rolling processes...|$|E
40|$|A {{finite element}} {{computer}} program is developed {{for evaluating the}} transient behavior of surface temperature in high performance spur gears. The time dimension is implemented using two and three point finite difference schemes. The different schemes are provided {{for the purpose of}} numerical stability and convergence studies. A detailed explanation of the gear cooling process leading to the establishment of a modified Blok model is also included. Other conventional models for approximating the heat transfer coefficients are available for comparison. Preliminary results are given showing snap shots of <b>gear</b> temperature <b>contours</b> at the initial stages of tooth engagement...|$|R
5000|$|Shapers {{are mainly}} {{classified}} as standard, draw-cut, horizontal, universal, vertical, <b>geared,</b> crank, hydraulic, <b>contour</b> and traveling head, [...] with a horizontal arrangement most common. Vertical shapers are generally {{fitted with a}} rotary table to enable curved surfaces to be machined (same idea as in helical planing). The vertical shaper {{is essentially the same}} thing as a slotter (slotting machine), although technically a distinction can be made if one defines a true vertical shaper as a machine whose slide can be moved from the vertical. A slotter is fixed in the vertical plane ...|$|R
