40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{endogenous}} emergence of wage bargaining institutions in a union-oligopoly framework. Technological asymmetries among firms are {{shown to be}} the driving force {{for the emergence of}} alternative wage bargaining centralization structures that are observable in real life. As <b>wage</b> <b>deals</b> at the sector-level obtain the consensus of all unions and the efficient firms, a regulator has an incentive to authorize those deals by activating/establishing a Minimum Sectoral Wage Institution(MSWI). If productivity differences are high enough, wage setting above the established wage floor may subsequently occur in efficient firms. Otherwise, a completely centralized wage bargaining structure emerges and the sector-level <b>wage</b> <b>deal</b> is simply confirmed as the firms’ wage rate. If, however, productivity asymmetries are rather insignificant, firms and unions have conflicting interests and a completely decentralized wage bargaining regime prevails in equilibrium.

The reversal was brief and mild by the standards of the 1970s, but unemployment nevertheless began to rise, and the metals industries sector in which IG Metall operated was particularly badly affected by economic headwinds.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{endogenous}} emergence of wage bargaining institutions in sectors with market power. We show that asymmetries in firms’ productivity and in unions’ risk aversion and/or bargaining power may generate {{various degrees of}} centralization in wage bargaining, which are often observable in real life. In the presence of such asymmetries, a winning coalition of all the unions and (typically) the efficient firms has an incentive to establish wage bargaining centralization at the sectoral level. If productivity differences are high enough, wage bargaining may also occur at the firm level, but only regarding the efficient firms. Otherwise, a completely centralized structure prevails and the sectoral <b>wage</b> <b>deal</b> is simply confirmed by all firms and unions. However, if the sources of asymmetry “cancel out”, decentralized wage bargaining is sustained in equilibrium. Wage Negotiations, Bargaining Institutions, Unions, Oligopoly, Minimum Wage. ...|$|R

Unemployed workers may find alternative jobs either in the legal or in the illegal labor markets. Wages in this latter case are highly affected by migrants crowding this segment more than any other market.

A wage curve is designed theoretically, reflecting cross-border labor and capital mobility, and estimated on panel data for 13 European countries over the period 1995 – 2013.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{endogenous}} determination of contracts in a unionized oligopoly and the welfare implications thereof. Alternative contracts specify the sequencing {{in the selection}} of R&D and wages. They can be classified as 'fixed' when the unions set wages before the firms make their R&D decisions or 'floating' when the sequencing of these choices is reversed. If the unions are highly employment-oriented, we find that either all firm-union pairs choose floating-wage contracts or both contract types may coexist depending on the degree of technological spillovers. However, when the unions have stronger preference over attaining a good <b>wage</b> <b>deal,</b> then it becomes very likely that fixed-wage contracts will endogenously emerge because they can serve as an insurance device against oppor tunistic wage increases. Our welfare analysis suggests that welfare-improving contracts may nevertheless not always arise in equilibrium.

30|$|Crucial to this {{argument}} is that many working conditions are public goods {{in the sense that}} their consumption is non-rival, such that exclusion from their consumption is either difficult or impossible (examples include safety conditions and line speeds). Without some form of collective agency—which the authors at all times equate with autonomous unions—the worker’s incentive to express his or her preferences would be too small. Another public goods aspect of the workplace arises from complementarities in production. In such circumstances, the attitudes and morale of the worker become potentially important inputs into the production process. On the same reasoning as employed earlier, collective organization may increase output through a joint determination of effort inputs, perhaps more so through increased cooperation between workers in continuity markets. We note parenthetically that for the public goods argument to have force, and as Freeman (1976) notes, two further conditions have to be met. First, there must be costs to using the regular market because if quitting were costless, the individual worker could simply choose the employer whose working conditions most closely approximated his or her preferences. Second, the workplace has to be buffeted by unforeseen shocks that change its nature in an informational context; otherwise, there would be no need for the union’s demand-revealing function after the formative match. Note, also, that a distortion of the separation decision—a firing tax—is also central to the choice by workers and firms for collective over <b>individualized</b> <b>wage</b> setting in Boeri and Burda’s (2009) model of endogenous collective bargaining.|$|R

5000|$|It {{was working}} with Becker that gave Willi Bleicher his first {{experience}} of operating under the glare of nationwide publicity. For IG Metall, engineering sector wage rates for the North Württemberg / North Baden region had by the early 1950s become a defining precursor for wage negotiations elsewhere in West Germany. Becker and Bleicher were generally respected by employers as representing the best organised of the trades unions, which facilitated <b>wage</b> <b>deals</b> that union negitiators in other regions could then adopt as guiding principals for their own collective bargaining agreements. Opposition generated by trades union officers identified as [...] "wild or unruly" [...] and breaches of internal union discipline were therefore challenges that Becker and Bleicher were generally not called upon to confront.

40|$|In the article, the Great Conflict of 1980 is {{compared}} with the general strike and great lockout of 1909 and the 1945 metalworkers’ strike. Depending on how they are measured, each of them could lay {{claim to be the}} largest labour conflict in Swedish history. While the strikes of 1909 and 1945 ended up in union defeats, the outcome of the 1980 conflict was a severe setback for SAF. The 1909 LO strike and the 1980 SAF lockout both aimed at pressing a non-socialist government to intervene, but none of them was successful in this respect. During the months preceding the 1980 conflict, the centre-right government failed to present an economic-political package satisfying the labour market parties, in particular LO regarding tax adjustments acceptable for the low-income groups. The appearance for the first time of a united front of the LO and TCO public sector unions and bargaining cartels, the “Gang of Four”, complicated the bargaining round. The founding of the private sector white-collar bargaining cartel PTK seven years earlier also weakened the privileged position that the axis LO-SAF had had in the traditional Swedish model. Despite this, the overwhelming majority of strikers and locked out in the 1980 conflict was blue-collar workers in the LO-SAF area, although the participation of some public sector groups attracted great attention. A number of developments in the 1970 s formed the background to the great conflict: strong inflationary pressures due to two oil crisis and very high nominal wage increases {{in the midst of the}} decade, the first non-socialist government in Sweden for 44 years entering office in 1976 and the appointment of a new SAF president, the militant Curt Nicolin, in the same year. Nicolin set great hopes on the 1980 lockout as “an investment for the future” with the aim to change the bargaining climate for the coming decades. The great conflict of 1980 may be considered an attempt on the part of the employers to change the Swedish model of collective bargaining to radically gear down wage increases. The SAF proposals for a wage freeze (“the zero bid”) and a downsized public sector, presented as the only possible way of securing the standard of living, made up two conspicuous components of an employer strategy to change the rules of collective bargaining. After the 1980 failure, SAF adopted another concept – decentralized and <b>individualized</b> <b>wage</b> formation – to gear down wage increases...|$|R

40|$|In {{the course}} of our {{everyday}} lives, we are constantly faced with situations in which we must choose. Do we invest in the bank or the stock-market? Is a new <b>wage</b> <b>deal</b> so unfair that we should resort to a strike? These situations are elegantly described mathematically by Rational Choice Theory (RCT), which dominates the quantitative social sciences such as economics. However, unfortunately RCT often fails to predict how humans actually behave. Here I investigate choice using paradigms derived from the RCT framework, but aim to better predict actual choices by using a biological level of explanation. First, I examine simple choices that involve no social interaction, asking how choices are influenced by risk in potential outcomes, and by whether outcomes reflect potential gains or losses. The data reveal independent impacts of risk and loss on choice, findings not predicted by extant economic theories. Instead, I then harness functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) to suggest a biological mechanism by which risk and loss bias approach behaviour, and test this hypotheses in further behavioural experiments. Secondly, I examine social choices. Specifically, I examine biological systems that enable social behaviour to respond flexibly to environmental contingencies. I investigate the neural basis of the human fairness motivation using fMRI, and show how it flexibly adapts to external social context. Next, I show how this fairness motivation adapts to changes in an individual’s internal physiological state. Finally, I show how cooperation is modulated by the androgen hormone testosterone. Overall, in light of these non-social and social findings, I propose that a biologically-based account of choice can explain choices that are not predicted by existing theory...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of three self-contained essays. Essay 1 : This essay estimates wage assimilation among non-western immigrants in Sweden, controlling for selection into employment by including individual fixed effects. Furthermore, using matched employer-employee panel data covering the complete Swedish labor market, this essay decomposes wage catch-up into relative wage growth within and between workplaces and occupations. The results show that failing to control for selection into employment is likely to underestimate relative wage growth of immigrants, as early entrants {{in the labor market}} differ from later entrants along unobservable dimensions. Even after 30 years in the country, the group of non-western immigrants still earns substantially lower wages than natives. Wages catch up mainly within workplaces and occupations, suggesting that improved signals of productivity, rather than improved knowledge of job options, are of importance for the wage growth of non-western immigrants. Essay 2 : Earlier research has shown that immigrant- and minority entrepreneurs have difficulties accessing capital through the formal financial markets. This essay studies what role immigrant employees within the local bank sector have for the probability of immigrants to run their own businesses. I use linked employer-employee data covering the whole Swedish labor market for the years 1987 to 2003 and utilize a nationwide refugee dispersal policy to get exogenous variation in the exposure to co-ethnic bank employees. Results suggest that there is a positive relation between co-ethnic bank employees and the probability of being self-employed. This effect is most pronounced for immigrants who arrived with low education, for males and for those residing in metropolitan regions. The effects are substantial and robust to a wide set of controls for labor market characteristics of the ethnic group at the local level. These results provide evidence of an ethnic component in the formal credit markets. Essay 3 (with Oskar Nordström Skans) : This essay investigates the impact of a collective agreement stipulating a one shot increase in establishment-specific wage levels in a public-sector setting where wages otherwise are set according to <b>individualized</b> <b>wage</b> bargaining. The agreement stipulated that wages should increase in proportion to the number of low-paid females within each establishment.

Rather than viewing market mechanisms and government regulations dichotomously, economic actors debating the FLSA treated both market mechanisms and socially defined living standards as legitimate elements of wage-setting.
