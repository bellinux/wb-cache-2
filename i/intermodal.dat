5|$|In 1999, Robert C. Byrd {{allocated}} $8 {{million to}} federal appropriation bills for the Superblock project. Another $400,000 was allocated from the Federal Transit Administration to the Huntington Transit Authority for the feasibility study and {{master plan for}} the <b>intermodal</b> facility.|$|E
5|$|MD 151 {{is a part}} of the National Highway System as an <b>intermodal</b> {{connector}} from I-695 in Dundalk to I-95 in Baltimore and as {{a principal}} arterial from I-95 to its northern terminus at US 1 in Baltimore.|$|E
5|$|MD 198 {{is a part}} of the National Highway System for {{its entire}} length. The highway is an <b>intermodal</b> {{connector}} between I-95 and US 1. The remainder of the highway is a National Highway System principal arterial.|$|E
5|$|Construction, {{such as the}} North-South Arterial Highway project, {{supports}} the public-sector job market. Although passenger and commercial traffic on the Erie Canal has declined greatly since the 19thcentury, the barge canal still allows heavy cargo to travel through Utica at low cost, bypassing the New York State Thruway and providing <b>intermodal</b> freight transport with the railroads.|$|E
5|$|In 1998, $27 {{million for}} an <b>intermodal</b> {{facility}} was appropriated from Congress; an additional $6.7 million came {{from state and}} local funding. Then Governor Cecil Underwood had promised $700,000 in 1999, with local lawmakers funding the additional $1.3 million; an additional $4 million was to be allocated from the state {{over the next two}} years.|$|E
5|$|MD 355 {{is a part}} of {{the main}} National Highway System from the District of Columbia in Friendship Heights to I-495 in Bethesda. The highway is also a part of the National Highway System as an <b>intermodal</b> {{connector}} from I-495 to Shady Grove Road in Rockville and as a principal arterial from Shady Grove Road to MD 27 in Germantown.|$|E
5|$|Major {{employers}} include BAX Global, {{now part}} of Germany-based DB Schenker; Total Quality Logistics, UPS, FedEx, Roadway Express, CSX Corp, Pacer International, and ABX Air. Parsec Inc., based in Cincinnati, controls 45% of the nation's <b>intermodal</b> transportation business.

5|$|On September 30, 1999, it was {{announced}} that the Huntington Urban Renewal Authority was in negotiations with the Transit Authority and an unnamed Columbus, Ohio developer for the Superblock. In early October, President Bill Clinton signed the Transportation Appropriations bill, which provided an additional $12 million in funds for the <b>intermodal</b> facility.|$|E
5|$|Amarillo has no {{passenger}} rail service but remains {{an important part}} of the rail freight system. The BNSF Railway complex in Amarillo continues to serve a heavy daily traffic load, approximately 100–110 trains per day. The Union Pacific Railroad also sends substantial shipments to or through Amarillo. In addition to <b>intermodal</b> and general goods, a big portion of rail shipments involve grains and coal. There have been various proposals over the years to add passenger service. One, the Caprock Chief, would have seen daily service as part of a Fort Worth, Texas—Denver, Colorado service, but it failed to gain traction.|$|E
5|$|At some U.S. {{international}} airports, such as O'Hare International Airport in Chicago, some {{seating and}} waiting areas are {{located away from}} the terminal building, with passengers being shuttled to terminals. These areas may {{be referred to as}} ground transportation centers or <b>intermodal</b> centers. Amenities at ground transportation centers typically include restrooms and seating, and may also provide ticket counters, food and beverage sales and retail goods such as magazines. Some ground transportation centers have heating and air conditioning and covered boarding areas (to protect passengers from the elements).|$|E
5|$|Continued drought, road competition, and {{rationalisation}} of intrastate freight {{operations have}} seen this change in recent years, {{with an average of}} only 6.1 million tonnes of intrastate freight carried from each year between 1996 and 1998; and containers now being the major traffic, with residual cement, logs, quarry, and steel trains operating. By the 1990s road transport has captured most general freight traffic, with less than carload traffic was discontinued in July 2007 {{with the end of the}} Fastrack freight service. An exception to the decline is interstate operations, with <b>intermodal</b> container traffic growing due to competition between private operators.|$|E
5|$|In May 2009, Miami-Dade County broke {{ground on}} the AirportLink Metrorail Extension Project, a 2.4-mile {{extension}} of Metrorail that runs from the existing Earlington Heights station to the Miami <b>Intermodal</b> Center (MIC), now completed next to Miami International Airport (MIA). The original Metrorail line was initially planned to be built to the airport, but due to political pressure and lobbying was instead directed to its current alignment around the airport and to Hialeah.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, local {{officials}} began to consider constructing a new station to serve both Amtrak trains and the Berkshire Regional Transit Authority, which {{had taken over}} private bus services {{in the area in}} 1974. Between 1993 and 1999, BRTA administrator Diane Smith worked to advance plans for an <b>intermodal</b> transit center. A study completed in January 1998 provided cost-benefit analysis and preliminary costs and recommended eight sites for further study. Based on this, Congressman John W. Olver obtained $8.615 million in federal earmarks to fund the project; the state provided the 20% local match to reach the full $11 million cost.|$|E
5|$|MD 170 {{is a part}} of the National Highway System {{from its}} {{southern}} terminus in Odenton to I-695 in Linthicum. Within that stretch, there are two sections that serve as <b>intermodal</b> passenger transport links: from its southern terminus to MD 32 in Odenton, and from MD 176 to MD 162 along the perimeter of BWI Airport. The portions from MD 32 in Odenton to MD 176 in Severn and from MD 162 to I-695 within Linthicum are National Highway System principal arterials.|$|E
5|$|Salt Lake Central (which {{is part of}} the Salt Lake City <b>Intermodal</b> Hub) {{connects with}} FrontRunner {{commuter}} rail (with service from Weber County through Davis County and Salt Lake County to Utah County), as well as Amtrak and Greyhound Lines. In addition Murray Central and North Temple Bridge/Guadalupe also connect with FrontRunner. In December 2013 {{the first phase of the}} S Line (formerly known as Sugar House Streetcar) project opened for service with a connection at Central Pointe in South Salt Lake.|$|E
5|$|Sturtevant is an Amtrak {{railway station}} which opened for service on August 14, 2006. It {{is located at}} 9900 East Exploration Court, {{as part of the}} Renaissance Business Park in Sturtevant, Wisconsin, United States. The {{facility}} accommodates travelers who use the Hiawatha Service between Chicago Union Station and the Milwaukee <b>Intermodal</b> Station, and sees fourteen daily arrivals, seven each from Milwaukee and Chicago. Located along tracks owned by the Canadian Pacific Railway, the station was constructed as a replacement for the Milwaukee Road's 1901 Sturtevant depot at 2904 Wisconsin Street, which was moved from its former location to Caledonia in October 2009.|$|E
5|$|The 1990s saw costs further reduced on {{the rail}} network. Guards were removed from {{passenger}} trains in 1989, and driver only suburban trains commenced running in 1993, with the last suburban train crewed by a guard running in November 1995. In 1994 the National Rail Corporation was established, taking profitable steel, and <b>intermodal</b> trafficks from V/Line; and the Melbourne to Adelaide standard gauge line was opened in 1995 moving the break of gauge.|$|E
5|$|The Erie Metropolitan Transit Authority (EMTA) {{operates}} the city's transit bus system, {{known as the}} 'e'. Buses run {{seven days a week}} in the city, with trips out {{to other parts of the}} county occurring a couple times a week. Intercity buses providing transportation between Buffalo, Cleveland and Pittsburgh are operated by Greyhound Lines. Service between Buffalo and Cleveland is also provided by Lakefront Lines. Both companies operate out of the <b>Intermodal</b> Transportation Center, which opened in 2002 at the foot of Holland Street.|$|E
5|$|The Genesee County Board of Commissioners has {{proposed}} to MDOT that I-475 should {{be connected to}} US23 {{in the southern part}} of Genesee County. The board approved a study to investigate the economic impact of such an extension. The study will also examine how such an extension will impact an existing <b>intermodal</b> transportation hub at Bishop International Airport and a rail terminal being built at the former Buick City complex. Proposals for the freeway connection have been around since the late 1990s, but was indefinitely postponed in 2011.|$|E
5|$|Union Station {{serves as}} the {{centerpiece}} of the Regional <b>Intermodal</b> Transit Center serving southeastern Connecticut, with connections to local and intercity buses as well as ferries to Long Island, Fisher's Island, and Block Island. The current Union Station building, built in 1887, is the sixth station to serve New London and one of the oldest stations still in use along the Northeast Corridor. It was the last and largest railroad station designed by famed architect H.H. Richardson, and his best according to biographer Henry-Russell Hitchcock.|$|E
5|$|Freight rail {{transportation}} in Moncton {{is provided by}} Canadian National Railway. Although {{the presence of the}} CNR in Moncton has diminished greatly since the 1970s, the railway still maintains a large classification yard and <b>intermodal</b> facility in the west end of the city, and the regional headquarters for Atlantic Canada is still located here as well. Passenger {{rail transportation}} is provided by Via Rail Canada, with their train the Ocean serving the Moncton railway station three days per week to Halifax and to Montreal. The downtown Via station has been refurbished and also serves as the terminal for the Maritime Bus intercity bus service.|$|E
5|$|International District/Chinatown is a {{light rail}} and bus station {{that is part of}} the Downtown Seattle Transit Tunnel in Seattle, Washington. The station is located at the tunnel's south end, at 5th Avenue South and South Jackson Street in the Chinatown-International District neighborhood. It is served by the Central Link, part of Sound Transit's Link light rail system, as well as buses from King County Metro and Sound Transit Express. The station is located {{adjacent}} to Sound Transit headquarters at Union Station, as well as <b>intermodal</b> connections to Amtrak and Sounder commuter rail at King Street Station, the First Hill Streetcar, and intercity BoltBus service.|$|E
5|$|MD 97 has two {{stretches}} {{along which}} {{it is a part}} of the National Highway System. The highway is a principal arterial from its southern terminus in Silver Spring north to Brookeville Road in Brookeville. Within that section, MD 97 is an <b>intermodal</b> connector from I-495 north to MD 192 in Forest Glen. The highway is also a principal arterial from MD 32 at Fenby north to MD 140 in Westminster and from MD 140 in Westminster to a point south of MD 496 north of Westminster. MD 97 {{is a part of the}} main National Highway System along its concurrency with MD 140 in Westminster.|$|E
5|$|MD150 {{is known}} as Eastern Avenue from just west of I-895 in Baltimore to the Back River between Dundalk and Essex. The highway is also named Eastern Avenue from Carroll Island Road in Middle River to the highway's eastern {{terminus}} in Chase. Between the two sections of Eastern Avenue, MD150 follows Eastern Boulevard through Essex and Middle River. The state highway is maintained by the Baltimore City Department of Transportation {{in the city of}} Baltimore and by the Maryland State Highway Administration in Baltimore County. MD150 {{is a part of the}} National Highway System as a rail-to-truck <b>intermodal</b> freight transport connection from its western terminus at US40 to I-95 within Baltimore. The highway is also a National Highway System principal arterial from I-95 to Carroll Island Road in Middle River.|$|E
5|$|Mobile {{is served}} by four Class I railroads, {{including}} the Canadian National Railway (CNR), CSX Transportation (CSX), the Kansas City Southern Railway (KCS), and the Norfolk Southern Railway (NS). The Alabama and Gulf Coast Railway (AGR), a Class III railroad, links Mobile to the Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway (BNSF) at Amory, Mississippi. These converge at the Port of Mobile, which provides <b>intermodal</b> freight transport service to companies engaged in importing and exporting. Other railroads include the CG Railway (CGR), a rail ship service to Coatzacoalcos, Veracruz, and the Terminal Railway Alabama State Docks (TASD), a switching railroad. The city was served by Amtrak's Sunset Limited passenger train service until 2005, when the service was suspended due {{to the effects of}} Hurricane Katrina.|$|E
5|$|Opposition to the {{railroad}} line returning to service included {{that it would}} be as much of a problem to downtown traffic as the container trucks and that the noise would be a disturbance to nearby residents. As with before, however, trains are occasional and reserved for specialty loads, such as oversized loads and hazardous materials, which will be banned from the tunnel. It was also stated that the trains, which will be able to go up to 30mph on the newly renovated line versus the old limit of 5mph, will be able to cross Biscayne Boulevard in 90 seconds. The current plan is for the line to be strictly for <b>intermodal</b> services, with the project including a rail yard and station at the port, however, in the future a passenger station may be added.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, the Southeastern Connecticut Council of Governments (SCCOG) began a {{study of}} how to improve the Regional <b>Intermodal</b> Transportation Center (RITC), {{including}} Union Station. The study analyzed problems with the RITC – including poor pedestrian connections, minimal bus facilities, {{and a lack of}} food vendors – and considered but rejected a move to a Fort Trumbull site. The proposed alternative released in 2010, which would cost around $20 million, would relocate Water Street slightly to the west. The bus terminal would be expanded, with a new building adding onto the existing former baggage office. A pedestrian bridge was to be constructed connecting the Water Street Garage, the main station area, the northbound Amtrak platform, and the ferry terminal – a design that served station passengers as well as the ferries. Other pedestrian improvements were to include wayfinding signs, pedestrian-scale lighting, and expanded sidewalks.|$|E
5|$|SR57 {{begins at}} the Orange Crush {{interchange}} near downtown Orange, where it meets the northwest–southeast Santa Ana Freeway (I-5) and the east–west Garden Grove Freeway (SR22). The Orange Crush interchange, which had long been considered a major bottleneck, was rebuilt in the 1990s and 2000s. The freeway heads north from the junction and soon crosses to {{the west side of}} the Santa Ana River, continuing north through suburban portions of Anaheim and passing next to Anaheim Regional Transportation <b>Intermodal</b> Center, Angel Stadium and Honda Center. In northern Anaheim, SR57 meets the Riverside Freeway (SR 91). SR57 briefly passes through Placentia and Fullerton, providing access to California State University, Fullerton. As it crosses Imperial Highway (SR 90) near the Brea Mall and enters Brea, SR57 enters more rugged terrain before climbing through Brea Canyon, the gap between the Chino Hills and Puente Hills. Near the rim of the canyon, the highway curves north out of the Brea Canyon, and descends slightly to a junction with the Pomona Freeway (SR 60) in Diamond Bar, right on the edge of the San Gabriel Valley.|$|E
5|$|The Port of Miami {{was also}} {{recently}} awarded a federal grant {{as part of}} the Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER) program to restore a connection between the Florida East Coast Railway's yard in Hialeah and the Port of Miami, directly connecting the port to rail networks across the United States, as well as re-establish the port's on-dock rail capability (loading and unloading directly between ships and trains). The railroad bridge connecting the Port of Miami to the mainland was damaged by Hurricane Wilma in 2005, at which time service was suspended, and the bridge remained closed for well over a decade. Rail service to the port was restored by 2014. The rail project is part of another element of increasing PortMiami's capacity; an inland <b>intermodal</b> center to be built near the airport known as Flagler Logistics Hub, which was planned to be built on 300 acres of land in Hialeah.|$|E
5|$|The second phase, between 125th and 96th Streets, was {{allocated}} $535 {{million in}} the MTA's 2015–2019 Capital Plan for planning, design, environmental studies, and utility relocation. Three new stations will be constructed at 125th Street, 116th Street, and 106th Street, with the existing tunnel at 116th Street being rebuilt to accommodate the new station there. A transfer to the Lexington Avenue Line and an <b>intermodal</b> connection with Metro-North Railroad would be available at the 125th Street station. While the main line would turn west onto 125th Street with tail tracks to Fifth Avenue, tail tracks would continue north on the spur via Second Avenue to 129th Street. North of 120th Street, the line will be constructed {{through the use of}} TBMs. South of 120th Street, the line will utilize the 99th–105th and 110th–120th Streets tunnel sections built during the 1970s, with a cut-and-cover tunnel connecting the segments between 105th and 110th Streets.|$|E
25|$|The {{fastest growing}} rail traffic segment is {{currently}} <b>intermodal.</b> <b>Intermodal</b> is {{the movement of}} shipping containers or truck trailers by rail {{and at least one}} other mode of transportation, usually trucks or ocean-going vessels. <b>Intermodal</b> combines the door-to-door convenience of trucks with the long-haul economy of railroads. Rail <b>intermodal</b> has tripled in the last 25 years. It plays a critical role in making logistics far more efficient for retailers and others. The efficiency of <b>intermodal</b> provides the U.S. with a huge competitive advantage in the global economy.|$|E
25|$|There {{are various}} <b>intermodal</b> {{transport}} hubs in Kuala Lumpur, with one major <b>intermodal</b> transport hub {{in the city}} centre of Kuala Lumpur, the Kuala Lumpur Sentral transport hub.|$|E
