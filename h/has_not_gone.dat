5|$|The {{effect that}} seamounts have on fish populations <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>gone</b> unnoticed by the {{commercial}} fishing industry. Seamounts were first extensively fished {{in the second}} half of the 20th century, due to poor management practices and increased fishing pressure seriously depleting stock numbers on the typical fishing ground, the continental shelf. Seamounts have been the site of targeted fishing since that time.|$|E

In 2006, a {{security}} guard and disgraced former officer of the Western Australia Police working at the centre received a 12-month suspended sentence {{for the destruction of}} crucial evidence in the trial of a police assault against an alleged teenage shoplifter. The security officer, then head of the security at the centre gave evidence at a Corruption and Crime Commission hearing in June 2006 that he had taped over the footage showing the assault, because he did not understand why the Constable hit the alleged offender and did not want the officer to lose his job.|$|E

Upon the {{beginning}} of the first series, her lawyer boyfriend, Nicholas Savage (Rupert Graves), is revealed to be a philanderer, married with two sons in Wilmslow. Rachel, jeopardising her career, uses the Police National Computer (PNC) to locate the address his vehicle is registered to. Meanwhile, she discovers that she is pregnant with his child. Discovering his whereabouts, she reveals to Nick her plans to terminate her pregnancy and proceeds to blackmail him into allowing her to stay in his city centre apartment for free. Her personal and professional life becomes entangled when Savage is the defence barrister for Georgios Stelikos, a man on trial for murder and rape, at which Rachel has to give evidence. Savage uses information Rachel told him to his advantage, to which she denies. She later confides to Janet she perjured herself in court and that she had discussed details of the case to Nick. The jury finds Stelikos innocent, though the evidence points to the opposite. Savage, also upon seeing Rachel, realises that she <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>gone</b> through with the abortion, however, she later suffers a miscarriage. Nick's wife discovers his affair and telephones DCI Gill Murray (Amelia Bullmore), Rachel's boss.

Historians Joanna B. Michlic and Laurence Weinbaum charge that post-1989 Polish historiography has seen a revival of [...] "an ethnonationalist historical approach". According to Michlic, among some Polish historians, [...] " [...] served the purpose of rationalizing and explaining the participation of ethnic Poles in killing their Jewish neighbors and, thus, in minimizing the criminal nature of the murder." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{the early}} 2000s, a new feature film {{based on the}} Diabolik comics to be {{directed}} by Christophe Gans and starring Mark Dacascos and Monica Bellucci was in the planning stages. Gans opined that: [...] "The Bava film is unique and I'd never, ever want to copy it. But let's see where we can take Diabolik today for a totally new and different Pop art experience." [...] The film <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>gone</b> into production. In 2002, screenwriter Mario Gomboli announced a French production of Diabolik was to be made with a contemporary setting and a script written by Carlo Lucarelli and Giampiero Rigosi. A script was completed in April 2007, with filming set to begin in January 2008, but the production stalled.|$|E
500|$|There {{has also}} been {{the fact that the}} {{composer}} did not follow sonata form strictly, relying instead on juxtaposing blocks of tonalities and thematic groups. Maes states this point has been seen at times as a weakness rather than a sign of originality. Even with what Schonberg termed [...] "a professional reevaluaton" [...] of Tchaikovsky's work, the practice of faulting Tchaikovsky for not following in the steps of the Viennese masters <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>gone</b> away entirely, while his intent of writing music that would please his audiences is also sometimes taken to task. In a 1992 article, New York Times critic Allan Kozinn writes, [...] "It is Tchaikovsky's flexibility, after all, that has given us a sense of his variability.... Tchaikovsky was capable of turning out musicâentertaining and widely beloved though it isâthat seems superficial, manipulative and trivial when regarded {{in the context of the}} whole literature. The First Piano Concerto is a case in point. It makes a joyful noise, it swims in pretty tunes and its dramatic rhetoric allows (or even requires) a soloist to make a grand, swashbuckling impression. But it is entirely hollow." ...|$|E

She {{wanted to give her}} [...] "independence and dignity". In the article [...] "Her Mother, Herself", Pat Swift wrote: [...] "Helen Millett might have been content to go [...] "gently into that good night"âshe was after all more afraid of the nursing home than dyingâbut daughter Kate was having none of that. Feminist warrior, human rights activists, gay liberationist, writer and artist, Kate Millett <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>gone</b> gently through life and never hesitates to rage at anyoneâfriend or foe, family or the systemâto right a perceived wrong. When the dignity and quality of her ailing mother's life was at stake, this book's unfolding tale became inevitable." [...] Even though Helen played a role in having her daughter committed to the University of Minnesota's Mayo wing, Kate had her mother removed from the nursing home and returned to her apartment, where attendants managed her care. During this period, Millett could also [...] "bully" [...] her mother for her lack of cultural sophistication and the amount of television she watched and could be harsh with caregivers.|$|E
