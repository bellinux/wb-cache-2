25|$|Through {{an adult}} class at a Methodist church {{he learned of}} the Casa de Todos clinic in Tijuana, Mexico, in about 1960. He {{reflected}} on the experience in a 1967 article. There {{he was able to}} save the lives of two children during a period he volunteered one day a week. But he found he needed to <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>more</b> substantial than just be one doctor in one place of need. He initiated Project Concern to organize the work and it was incorporated in 1961. He first focused on Casa de Todos.|$|E
25|$|The {{band played}} a second show in Gothenburg. Döring and Dimeo had quit the band {{since the first}} show, so Opeth {{contacted}} {{two members of the}} band Crimson Cat, Kim Pettersson and Johan DeFarfalla, and asked them to join them onstage. Other bands playing the show were At the Gates, Therion, Desecrator, Megaslaughter and Sarcazm. After the show, De Farfalla left Opeth to spend time with his girlfriend. He was replaced by Åkerfeldt's friend Peter Lindgren, who was playing in a joke band called Sylt i krysset. He accepted the offer to play bass in Opeth because he wanted to <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>more</b> serious. Pettersson later left the band, and Lindgren switched to guitar. Isberg quit in 1992, due to creative differences. Åkerfeldt became the new vocalist. He and Lindgren started writing material immediately. They rehearsed as a 3-piece for more than a year. Stefan Guteklint joined on bass, but left soon after the band signed its first record deal with Candlelight Records, in 1994.|$|E

Chandler brand amps were also used for overdubs and [...] "higher parts". Delson spoke about his studio setup for The Hunting Party, stating that [...] "It's great to have a setup where I can run combinations of heads and cabs simultaneously to get the most appropriate tone, or <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>more</b> straightforward like record just one cabinet with two mikes".|$|E

500|$|During a 2007 {{interview}} with the Washington Post, Chabon discussed his second book under the contract, saying, [...] "I {{would like it to}} be set in the present day and feel right now the urge to <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>more</b> mainstream than my recent work has been." [...] During a Q session in January 2009, Chabon added that he was writing a [...] "naturalistic" [...] novel about two families in Berkeley. In a March 2010 {{interview with}} the Guardian newspaper, Chabon added that [...] "So far there's no overtly genre content: it's set in the present day and has no alternate reality or anything like that." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} was filmed near the beaches in Barcelona, Spain in August 2010, and was {{directed}} by Jaume de Laiguana, who had previously worked with Shakira on the videos for the songs [...] "No" [...] and [...] "Gypsy". The music video was shot in [...] "guerrilla-style", utilizing hand-held cameras to shoot many of the scenes. Shakira talked about the video, saying [...] "I decided to just <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>more</b> spontaneous, and be myself and be free and feel free about it {{because that is what}} this song is about". The music video was released on 29 September 2010, and the Spanish and English versions of the video were individually released on iTunes on 11 October 2010, and 13 October 2010, respectively.|$|E
500|$|Berg said, [...] " [...] did {{the last}} reel; the band Explosions in the Sky did pretty much did {{everything}} else. They have an emotional, tender quality to their music, {{even when it}} gets aggressive. I didn’t want the score to be overly aggressive, I {{wanted it to be}} haunting and emotional. Steve Jablonsky came in at the end to <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>more</b> traditional, but when Steve does [...] "traditional", it's not the usual strings. He created a wonderful sound at the very end." [...] Songs featured in the film include [...] "Canned Heat" [...] by Jamiroquai, and [...] "Heroes" [...] performed by Peter Gabriel and the New Blood Orchestra, which is played {{at the end of the}} film during a four-minute montage that features actual photos and videos of the fallen servicemen.|$|E
50|$|The {{fretting}} hand also {{comes into play}} in this approach to playing banjo. The {{fretting hand}} can hammer, pull off, slide and bend individual and groups of strings. This can create the illusion that the picking hand is <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> <b>more</b> than down-picking.|$|R

500|$|When {{working with}} actors, Nolan prefers {{giving them the}} time to perform as many takes of a given scene as they want. [...] "I've {{come to realize that}} the {{lighting}} and camera setups, the technical things, take all the time, but running another take generally only adds a couple of minutes.... If an actor tells me they can <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>more</b> with a scene, I give them the chance, because it's not going to cost that much time. It can't all be about the technical issues." [...] Gary Oldman praised the director for providing a relaxed atmosphere on set, adding [...] "I've never seen him raise his voice to anyone". He also observed that Nolan would give the actors space to [...] "find things in the scene", and not just give direction for direction's sake.|$|E
500|$|On March 31, 1967, {{while the}} Experience waited {{to perform at}} the London Astoria, Hendrix and Chandler {{discussed}} {{ways in which they}} could increase the band's media exposure. When Chandler asked journalist Keith Altham for advice, Altham suggested that they needed to <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>more</b> dramatic than the stage show of the Who, which involved the smashing of instruments. Hendrix joked: [...] "Maybe I can smash up an elephant", to which Altham replied: [...] "Well, it's a pity you can't set fire to your guitar". Chandler then asked road manager Gerry Stickells to procure some lighter fluid. During the show, Hendrix gave an especially dynamic performance before setting his guitar on fire {{at the end of a}} 45-minute set. In the wake of the stunt, members of London's press labeled Hendrix the [...] "Black Elvis" [...] and the [...] "Wild Man of Borneo".|$|E
500|$|The In Rainbows artwork was {{designed}} by Stanley Donwood, {{who has worked with}} Yorke to design Radiohead's album art since 1994. Donwood worked in the studio as Radiohead were working on the album, which allowed the mood of the music to be conveyed in the album artwork, and regularly put up images in the studio and on the studio computer for the band to interact with and comment on. He also posted images daily on the Radiohead website, though none were used in the final album artwork. Donwood experimented with photographic etching, putting prints into acid baths and throwing wax at paper, creating images influenced by NASA space photography. He originally planned to explore suburban life, but realised it did not fit the album, saying [...] "it's a sensual record and I wanted to <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>more</b> organic." [...] Describing the album cover, Donwood said: [...] "It's very colourful—I've finally embraced colour! It's a rainbow but it is very toxic, it's more like the sort of one you'd see in a puddle." [...] The band decided not to release the cover for the digital release, preferring to hold it back for the physical release. The [...] "discbox" [...] release of the album includes a booklet containing additional artwork by Donwood.|$|E

500|$|Will Eisner {{was born}} in New York in 1917 to poor Jewish immigrants. [...] He has said he wanted {{a career in the}} arts, but that poor Jews at the time were {{restricted}} from upper-class universities where he could study it. [...] Like others of his generation, he turned to comics as an artistic outlet, a career he began in 1936. [...] In the late 1930s he co-owned a studio which produced content for comic books; he left the studio in 1940 to produce his best-known creation, the formally inventive The Spirit, which ran as a newspaper insert from 1940 to 1952. [...] After its end, Eisner withdrew from the comic book world and focused on the American Visuals Corporation, which he had founded in 1948 to produce educational and commercial comics and related media. [...] With the rise of comics fandom in the 1970s, Eisner found there was still interest in his decades-old Spirit comics, and that the fans wanted more work from him. [...] After American Visuals went out of business in 1972, Eisner entered a deal with underground comix publisher [...] to reprint old Spirit stories. [...] Other reprints followed, but Eisner was unwilling to do new Spirit stories—instead, he wanted to <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>more</b> serious, inspired in part by the wordless novels of Lynd Ward he first read in 1938, and similar work by the Flemish Frans Masereel and the German Otto Nückel.|$|E
500|$|... "Duets" [...] was {{generally}} well received by critics, {{many of whom}} contrasted it favorably with the preceding season two episodes. The New York Times Rebecca Milzoff called it {{the best of the}} season to that point [...] "in terms of old-school Glee", and indeed, both Lisa Respers France of CNN and Jarett Wieselman of the New York Post found it a reminder of why they originally loved the show. Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal summarized: [...] "This was a return to that honeymoon feeling, when Glee first surprised, scandalized and satisfied you." [...] TV Guide Damian Holbrook and the Houston Chronicle Bobby Hankinson appreciated the lack of gimmicks; the former explained [...] "No Britney numbers. No forced guest stars. No reasons to check out. It's amazing how satisfying a show can be when the characters we invested in a year ago get to <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>more</b> than set-dress a stunt." [...] James Poniewozik of Time labelled it [...] "easily the strongest character episode so far this season". While The Atlantic Kevin Fallon opined that the series finally achieved the correct [...] "tonal balance of comedy and drama", his colleague Meghan Brown provided one of few dissenting reviews; she called it a lazy, nonsensical episode which contributed to a building [...] "sophomore slump". MTV's Aly Semigran found it lackluster after [...] "Grilled Cheesus", and although Anthony Benigno of the Daily News deemed it an improvement on the previous episode, he concluded that it was not one of the season's best.|$|E

2500|$|However, Inayat Khan was {{training}} as a W/T operator, and in that field she was getting quite adequate reports. Her [...] "fist", or style of tapping the keys, was somewhat heavy, apparently owing to her fingers being swollen by chilblains, but her speed was improving every day. Like many talented musicians–she played the harp–Inayat Khan was a natural signaller. Furthermore, Vera Atkins (the intelligence officer for F Section) insisted, her commitment was unquestioned, as another training report had readily confirmed: [...] "She felt {{she had come to}} a dead end in the WAAF, and was longing to <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>more</b> active in the prosecution of the war, something that would demand more sacrifice." [...] So when Suttill's request first came, Vera saw Inayat Khan as a natural choice, and although her final training in field security and encoding had to be cut short, she judged her ready to go.|$|E
2500|$|In his nonseries novels written {{after his}} {{professional}} retirement, Galaxy Primes, Subspace Explorers, and Subspace Encounter, E. E. Smith explores themes of telepathy and other mental abilities collectively called [...] "psionics", {{and of the}} conflict between libertarian and socialistic/communistic influences in the colonization of other planets. Galaxy Primes was written after critics such as [...] Groff Conklin and P.
