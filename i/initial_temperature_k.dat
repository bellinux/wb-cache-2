Special emphasis is on the analysis of ring- and spiral-type instabilities that have shown dependence on certain initial conditions chosen for a rotating solar mass cloud of molecular hydrogen.

40|$|The {{stabilization}} {{characteristics of}} laminar non-premixed jet flames of pre-vaporized iso-octane, {{one of the}} primary reference fuels for octane rating, have been studied experimentally in heated coflow air. Non-autoignited and autoignited lifted flames were analyzed. With the coflow air at relatively low <b>initial</b> <b>temperatures</b> below 940 <b>K,</b> an external ignition source was required to stabilize the flame. These lifted flames had tribrachial edge structures and their liftoff heights correlated well with the jet velocity scaled by stoichiometric laminar burning velocity, indicating the importance of the edge propagation speed on flame stabilization. At high <b>initial</b> <b>temperatures</b> over 940 <b>K,</b> the autoignited flames were stabilized without requiring an external ignition source. These autoignited lifted flames exhibited either tribrachial edge structures or mild combustion behaviors depending on the level of fuel dilution. Two distinct transition behaviors were observed in the autoignition regime from a nozzle-attached flame to a lifted tribrachial-edge flame and then to lifted mild combustion as the jet velocity increased at a certain fuel dilution level. The liftoff data of the autoignited flames with tribrachial edges were analyzed based on calculated ignition delay times. Analysis of the experimental data suggested that ignition delay time may be much less sensitive to <b>initial</b> <b>temperature</b> under atmospheric pressure conditions as compared with predictions. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

First, the new experimental setup is validated with methane/air premixed laminar flames at normal temperature and pressure. The laminar burning velocity of four jet fuel surrogates is then characterized. Measurements are performed over a range of equivalence ratios from 0. 7 to 1. 5, <b>initial</b> <b>temperature</b> of 400 <b>K,</b> and initial pressure of 0. 1 MPa. The results are compared with experimental data available in the literature and with calculations using the chemical kinetics code CANTERA (1 D model) and existing chemical kinetic mechanisms. A comparison between the different surrogates is then discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{heat flux}} method for {{measuring}} laminar burning velocities {{has been extended}} to subatmospheric pressures, down to 80 mbar. The new setup is described and adaptations necessary for the new conditions are analyzed. This includes a new burner plate {{to compensate for the}} decrease of sensitivity of the measurement at lower pressures, due to a lower density of the gases and hence a smaller heat flux of the flame to the burner. Measurement results of burning velocities of a stoichiometric methane/air mixture with an <b>initial</b> <b>temperature</b> of 295 <b>K</b> in the range 150 - 1000 mbar are presented including 95 % error margins. A comparison with other experimental results and GRI-based numerical calculations is made. Additionally, for a pressure of 200 mbar the burning velocity of methane/air flames has been measured as a function of equivalence ratio. For pressures lower than 150 mbar, {{it turns out that the}} effect of unburned mixture diffusion out of the boundary layer of the flame becomes a concern. An analysis is presented to study the influence of systematical errors arising from this effect...|$|R
40|$|The stress–strain {{behaviour}} and microstructural {{evolution of}} the Ti– 6 Cr– 5 Mo– 5 V– 4 Al (Ti 6554) alloy was systematically investigated using Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar (SHPB) tests {{over a wide range}} of strain rates from 1000 s− 1 to 10, 000 s− 1 and <b>initial</b> <b>temperatures</b> from 293 <b>K</b> to 1173 K. Dislocation slip is the main deformation mechanism for plastic flow of the Ti 6554 alloy at high strain rates. The flow stress increases with increasing strain rate and decreasing temperature. Also the flow stress is more sensitive to temperature than to strain rate. For high strain rate deformations, the strain hardening rate is found to be negative at 293 K and increases with increasing temperatures. Flow softening observed at 293 K is potentially caused by adiabatic heating. The increment in the strain hardening rate with increasing temperatures {{may be the result of}} interactions between thermally activated solute Cr atoms and mobile dislocations. When the temperature is raised to 873 K, a novel α precipitate morphology consisting of globular α aligned in strings was observed in specimens deformed at strain rates of 4000 and 10, 000 s− 1. It has hardening effects on the β matrix and is purported to nucleate on dislocations introduced by the high strain rate deformation. Adiabatic shear bands were observed in specimens deformed at higher <b>temperatures</b> (873 <b>K).</b> The microstructure inside the shear bands is harder than that outside of the shear bands in the Ti 6554 alloy...|$|R

The ions were produced in the trap by K-shell photoionization of Ar atoms, using broadband synchrotron x-ray radiation. K-electron removal resulted in vacancy cascading, yielding a distribution of argon-ion charge states peaked near Ar 4 +. The stored ion gas had an <b>initial</b> <b>temperature</b> near 480 <b>K.</b> The basic data determining the rate coefficients k(Ar(q+)) are the storage time constants of each charge state in the trap, {{in the presence of a}} measured pressure of target gas.

40|$|The {{two-dimensional}} axisymmetric hydrocode {{model of}} free particles {{is applied to}} the calculation of response of a comet nucleus to a meteorite impact. The nucleus is assumed to be spherical with a radius of 1 km. It is composed of a porous granular mixture of water ice and of mineral. <b>Initial</b> <b>temperature</b> is 50 <b>K.</b> Porosity is v = 0. 6 and the mean density is p = 400 kg me 3. Impactor radius is equal to 1 m and its mean density is equal to that of the nucleus. Impact velocity is 10 km se’. A normal impact is considered. Particular. forms for the equations of state (EOS) for the real medium (water ice and rock) as well as for an artificial medium of very low-density (40 kg mJ) filling up the voids are used. The cohesion is included in the constitutive model of the constituents. Numerical modelling provides the time dependent fields of pressure, density, temperature, and particle velocity in the vicinity of an impact point. The evolution of the field of temperature correlated with the function for kinetics of amorphous to crystalline phase transition permits discussion of the impact-induced crystallization of presumably initially amorphous ice.

40|$|In {{the present}} paper, {{the size and}} strain rate effects on ultra-thin / 100 Cu {{nanowires}} at an <b>initial</b> <b>temperature</b> of 10 <b>K</b> have been discussed. Extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have been performed using Embedded atom method (EAM) to investigate the structural behaviours and properties under high strain rate. Velocity-Verlet algorithm {{has been used to}} solve the equation of motions. Two different thermal loading cases have been considered: (i) Isothermal loading, in which Nose-Hoover thermostat is used to maintain the constant system temperature, and (ii) Adiabatic loading, i. e., without any thermostat. Five different wire cross-sections were considered ranging from 0. 723 x 0. 723 nm(2) to 2. 169 x 2. 169 nm(2) The strain rates {{used in the present study}} were 1 x 10 (9) s(- 1), 1 x 10 (8) s(- 1), and 1 x 10 (7) s(- 1). The effect of strain rate on the mechanical properties of copper nanowires was analysed, which shows that elastic properties are independent of thermal loading for a given strain rate and cross-sectional dimension of nanowire. It showed a decreasing yield stress and yield strain with decreasing strain rate for a given cross- section. Also, a decreasing yield stress and increasing yield strain were observed for a given strain rate with increasing cross-sectional area. Elastic modulus was found to be similar to 100 GPa, which was independent of processing temperature, strain rate, and size for a given <b>initial</b> <b>temperature.</b> Reorientation of / 100 square cross-sectional copper nanowire into a series of stable ultra-thin Pentagon copper nanobridge structures with dia of similar to 1 nm at 10 K was observed under high strain rate tensile loading. The effect of isothermal and adiabatic loading on the formation of such pentagonal nanobridge structure has been discussed...|$|R

The nanosecond laser-induced damage threshold (LIDT) at different <b>initial</b> <b>temperatures</b> {{and time of}} the films was investigated by an in situ high temperature laser-induced damage testing platform. It was shown that, when the <b>initial</b> <b>temperature</b> increased from 298 K to 383 K, the LIDT at 1064 nm and 12 ns significantly decreased by nearly 14 %. Then the LIDT at 1064 nm and 12 ns decreased slower with the same temperature increment. Different damage morphologies were found at different <b>initial</b> <b>temperatures.</b> At low <b>initial</b> <b>temperatures,</b> it was the defects-isolated damage while at high <b>initial</b> <b>temperatures</b> it was the defects-combined damage. The theoretical calculations based on the defect-induced damage model revealed that both the significant increase of the highest temperature and the duration contributed to the different damage morphologies.

40|$|The {{effects of}} ambient pressure, <b>initial</b> gas <b>temperature</b> and {{combustion}} reaction on the evaporation {{of a single}} fuel droplet and multiple fuel droplets are investigated by means of three-dimensional numerical simulation. The ambient pressure, <b>initial</b> gas <b>temperature</b> and droplets’ mass loading ratio, ML, are varied in the ranges of 0. 1 – 2. 0 MPa, 1000 – 2000 K and 0. 027 – 0. 36, respectively, under the condition with or without combustion reaction. The results show that both for the conditions with and without combustion reaction, droplet lifetime increases with increasing the ambient pressure at low <b>initial</b> gas <b>temperature</b> of 1000 <b>K,</b> but decreases at high <b>initial</b> gas <b>temperatures</b> of 1500 <b>K</b> and 2000 K, although the droplet lifetime becomes shorter due to combustion reaction. The increase of ML and the inhomogeneity of droplet distribution due to turbulence generally make the droplet lifetime longer, since the high droplets’ mass loading ratio at local locations causes the decrease of gas temperature and the increase of the evaporated fuel mass fraction towards the vapor surface mass fraction...|$|R
40|$|A rapid {{compression}} machine (RCM) {{test bench}} is developed in this study. The performance characterization and auto-ignition performance tests are conducted at an <b>initial</b> <b>temperature</b> of 293 <b>K,</b> a compression ratio of 9. 5 to 16. 5, a compressed <b>temperature</b> of 650 <b>K</b> to 850 K, a driving gas pressure range of 0. 25 MPa to 0. 7 MPa, an initial pressure of 0. 04 MPa to 0. 09 MPa, and a nitrogen dilution ratio of 35 % to 65 %. A {{new type of}} hydraulic piston is used {{to address the problem}} in which the hydraulic buffer adversely affects the rapid compression process. Auto-ignition performance tests of the RCM are then performed using a DME–O 2 –N 2 mixture. The two-stage ignition delay and negative temperature coefficient (NTC) behavior of the mixture are observed. The effects of driving gas pressure, compression ratio, initial pressure, and nitrogen dilution ratio on the two-stage ignition delay are investigated. Results show that both the first-stage and overall ignition delays tend to increase with increasing driving gas pressure. The driving gas pressure within a certain range does not significantly influence the compressed pressure. With increasing compression ratio, the first-stage ignition delay is shortened, whereas the second-stage ignition delay is extended. With increasing initial pressure, both the first-stage and second-stage ignition delays are shortened. The second-stage ignition delay is shortened {{to a greater extent than}} that of the first-stage. With increasing nitrogen dilution ratio, the first-stage ignition delay is shortened, whereas the second-stage is extended. Thus, overall ignition delay presents different trends under various compression ratios and compressed pressure conditions...|$|R
