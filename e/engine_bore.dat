25|$|Carlo Guzzi's first engine {{design was}} a {{horizontal}} single {{that dominated the}} first 45 years of the company's history in various configurations. Through 1934, each <b>engine</b> <b>bore</b> the signature of the mechanic who built it. As originally envisioned, the company used racing to promote the brand. In the 1935 Isle of Man TT, Moto Guzzi factory rider Stanley Woods performed an impressive double victory with wins in the Lightweight TT {{as well as the}} Senior TT.|$|E
60|$|A star {{appeared}} {{far down}} the track which soon waxed into the headlight of the approaching train. It came on with an increasing roar; the <b>engine</b> <b>bore</b> down upon the ambushing desperadoes with a glare and a shriek like some avenging monster come to deliver them to justice. Black Eagle flattened himself upon the ground. The engine, contrary to their calculations, instead of stopping between him and Bud King's place of concealment, passed fully forty yards farther before {{it came to a}} stand.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>engine's</b> <b>bore</b> was 3+3/4 in and its stroke was 4 in even, {{for a total}} {{displacement}} of [...] The compression ratio was low by modern standards, but typical for the era, making the engine forgiving of poor fuel quality and minimizing cranking effort at starting.|$|R
50|$|In 1983 Simson {{introduced}} a 70 cc model, the S 70. This had the S 51s long-stroke <b>engine</b> <b>bored</b> out by 7 mm, giving over-square dimensions of 45 x 44 mm and producing 5.6 bhp. Like the S 51, the S 70 {{was produced in}} various forms until 1990.|$|R
5000|$|A [...] "square engine" [...] is an <b>engine</b> with a <b>bore</b> {{diameter}} {{equal to}} its stroke length. An <b>engine</b> where the <b>bore</b> diameter {{is larger than}} its stroke length is an oversquare engine, conversely, an <b>engine</b> with a <b>bore</b> diameter that is smaller than its stroke length is an undersquare engine.|$|R
50|$|The {{final version}} was the 2.8 L (2775 cc) <b>engine.</b> <b>Bore</b> was now 85 mm and stroke {{remained}} at 82 mm {{as in the}} 2500.|$|E
5000|$|In August 1938 the <b>engine</b> <b>bore</b> was {{increased}} to 77.47 mm {{and the engine}} was renamed E 4. The increase in bore increased the following: ...|$|E

5000|$|Hugh Allan and John Joseph Caldwell Abbott {{acknowledged}} Labelle's {{support of}} the Canadian Pacific Railway, and when {{the first section of}} the Canadian Pacific's Montreal-Saint-Jerome railway line was inaugurated on October 9, 1876, one of the <b>engines</b> <b>bore</b> Labelle's name. Labelle received support from journalist Arthur Buies and coureur des bois Isidore Martin.|$|R
5000|$|The Perkins 6.372 is {{a diesel}} engine {{manufactured}} by Perkins Engines. The designation 6.372 indicates six cylinders and 372 cubic inch (6.1 litre) capacity. It {{is derived from}} the 6.354 (six cylinder, 354 in³ or 5.8L, L6 <b>engine)</b> <b>bored</b> out with a 0.100" [...] larger bore. It produces 112 horsepower in industrial form.|$|R

50|$|Taxable {{horsepower}} {{does not}} reflect developed horsepower; rather, it is a calculated figure based on the <b>engine's</b> <b>bore</b> size, number of cylinders, and a (now archaic) presumption of engine efficiency. As new engines were designed with ever-increasing efficiency, {{it was no longer}} a useful measure, but was kept in use by UK regulations which used the rating for tax purposes.|$|R
50|$|The B-series {{features}} <b>engine</b> <b>bores</b> machined {{directly into}} the block (rather than the wet liners used on earlier Cummins engines). It was also set apart {{by the use of}} a shallow one-piece head, requiring closer tolerances than in other Cummins products. The engine was first manufactured in Rocky Mount, North Carolina, and other plants were later added in Mexico, Turkey, and Darlington, UK.|$|R
5000|$|The Kawasaki {{engineers}} {{approached the}} N100 Plan in two ways. (1) Use an existing, {{tried and true}} Kawasaki A7 350 [...] "Avenger", a 350 cc two-stroke, parallel twin-cylinder, rotary-disc <b>engine,</b> <b>bored</b> out to 500 cc or (2) develop an entirely new engineering layout, building a parallel 3-cylinder two-stroke or create a new and groundbreaking [...] "L-triple" [...] design air-cooled two-stroke engine.|$|R

50|$|The number plates {{date back}} to {{the early years of the}} CGR and NGR and are highly sought after by {{collectors}} as well as scrap metal peddlers. Unfortunately, this has led to a rhinoceros horn type situation, where the plates were illegally removed from many locomotives. In later years, in an attempt to discourage theft, most modern <b>engines</b> <b>bore</b> plates which were cast in aluminium instead of leaded bronze.|$|R
