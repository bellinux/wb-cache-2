5|$|Hard Target was Woo's first American {{film and}} {{was also the first}} major Hollywood film made by a Chinese {{director}}. Universal Pictures was nervous about having Woo direct a feature, and sent in director Sam Raimi to look over the film's production and to take Woo's place as director if he were to fail. Woo went through several scripts finding mostly martial arts films with which he was not interested. After deciding on Chuck Pfarrer's script for Hard Target, Woo wanted to have actor Kurt Russell in the lead role, but found Russell too busy with other projects. Woo then went with Universal's initial choice of having Jean-Claude Van Damme star. Woo <b>got</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> Van Damme during filming and raised the amount of action in the film as he knew that Van Damme was up for it.|$|E
5|$|As Shaw grew older, his {{reputation}} as a dramatic actor grew stronger, and he became known for a sharp intelligence and dignified style. Although his good looks diminished, reviewers felt that he used his florid and weatherbeaten face well in evoking grandeur and self-assuredness in such roles as generals, priests and his familiar Shakespearean parts. In 1956, his wife Margaret Delamere died; she was survived by their daughter Drusilla. Shaw began a romantic relationship in the mid-1950s with Joan Ingpen, the well-known classical music and opera talent agent who had previously represented him. The two were romantically involved, to the point that she took his surname, until Shaw's death. During the 1980s, however, Shaw also had a brief relationship with Harriet Ravenscroft, the mother of the disc jockey John Peel, whom he met while performing at Ludlow Castle at Ludlow. He split his time between Ingpen and Ravenscroft on a four-day rotating basis to which both women consented. Although Peel <b>got</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> Shaw and said he made his mother happy, {{he said he did not}} feel comfortable with the arrangement. He felt it disrupted his mother's friendships and prospects for a more stable relationship.|$|E
5|$|During {{his tenure}} as Deputy Premier Tikhonov {{was in charge of}} {{metallurgy}} and chemical industry; his responsibilities did not change with his ascension to the post of First Deputy Premier. However, he did provide a general coordination for heavy industry. When Alexei Kosygin, the Premier, was on sick leave in 1976 Brezhnev took advantage of his illness by appointing Tikhonov to the office of First Deputy Premier. As First Deputy Premier, Tikhonov was able to reduce Kosygin to a standby figure. Tikhonov was, however, {{one of the few who}} <b>got</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> both Brezhnev and Kosygin, both of them liked his candor and honesty. In 1978 Tikhonov was elected a candidate member of the Politburo and was made a voting member of the Politburo in 1979. Tikhonov was not informed of the decision to intervene in Afghanistan; the reason being his bad relationship with Dmitriy Ustinov, the Minister of Defence at the time.|$|E

25|$|When Cao Cao {{implemented}} the tuntian system of agriculture, he put Guo Yuan {{in charge of}} supervising {{the implementation of the}} policy. Guo Yuan performed his role well and achieved commendable results. He assessed the costs and benefits, conducted a population census and divided the land into smaller units accordingly, appointed officials to oversee the various units, and established a clear set of rules and regulations governing the entire system. Within five years, the granaries were fully stocked with food supplies and the people <b>got</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> their livelihoods.|$|E

In addition, they had two hours of military training and formation. One of the more controversial aspects of Bau-Bataillonen was their relationship with local residents. Initially {{it seems that the}} Lithuanians generally <b>got</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> local residents, even occasionally helping them out in farms. However, that changed once Germans started retreating and leaving scorched earth behind. Germans and their Lithuanian auxiliaries confiscated and destroyed property, burned villages, forcefully evacuated residents towards Germany, etc.|$|E

25|$|Despite limited on-field {{success in}} Ewbank's first years, the Jets began {{to put the}} pieces of a winning team in place. In 1964, they outbid {{cross-town}} NFL rivals the New York Giants for Matt Snell, a top running back prospect out of Ohio State University. Linebacker Larry Grantham became a consistent All-Pro selection and safety Dainard Paulson had 12 interceptions in 1964, which remains a team record. An even bigger coup came in 1965, when the Jets signed Joe Namath, a star quarterback at Alabama under coach Bear Bryant. The St. Louis Cardinals selected Namath as the 12th pick in the NFL draft, but Namath later said he chose the Jets {{in part because he}} <b>got</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> Ewbank and was impressed by how he had developed Unitas while with the Colts.|$|E
25|$|In 1937, Maria Pavlovna {{visited her}} son Lennart {{and his family}} in Mainau. They bonded over their shared {{interest}} in photography and she <b>got</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> his wife, even though the grand duchess had been disappointed when her son renounced his royal status in order to marry a commoner in 1932. Maria Pavlovna, who had little maternal feelings, took no interest in her two grand daughters: Birgitta, then four years old and Marie Louise age two. She asked Lennart to call her by her name as she felt embarrassed {{to have such a}} grown up son. Thanks to Lennart, the King of Sweden, who sympathized with Maria Pavlovna, arranged a Swedish diplomatic passport for her to replace her old Nansen passport. This gave her a broader freedom of movement.|$|E
25|$|Gerets was {{released}} and Guus Hiddink {{returned to the}} club as coach and director of football, with Arjen Robben, Park Ji-sung, Lee Young-pyo joining PSV. Their first season immediately brought a league title, secured in the last match against Groningen. But in the 2003–04 season, PSV failed to reclaim the championship. In 2004, the PSV board clashed with Hiddink and Van Raaij concerning the expenditures. Van Raaij left in September and Hiddink never <b>got</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> his successor Rob Westerhof, who sided with the board. Even though Kežman and Robben left in 2004, Hiddink had gradually built a powerful squad, with Heurelho Gomes, Alex, Park, Lee, Mark van Bommel and the returning Phillip Cocu. The Eredivisie was won five matches before the end, and Willem II was beaten in the cup final. After eight consecutive Champions League group stage eliminations, PSV reached the knockout stage. There, they beat Monaco 3–0 on aggregate and Lyon after penalties. The first semi-final against Milan was lost 2–0. In the return, PSV took a 2–0 lead but a late goal by Massimo Ambrosini ended the hope to reach the final, despite an injury-time third goal by Cocu.|$|E

500|$|In 1991, Zappa {{was chosen}} {{to be one of}} four {{featured}} composers at the Frankfurt Festival in 1992 (the others were John Cage, Karlheinz Stockhausen, and Alexander Knaifel). Zappa was approached by the German chamber ensemble Ensemble Modern which was interested in playing his music for the event. Although ill, he invited them to Los Angeles for rehearsals of new compositions and new arrangements of older material.

500|$|During {{production}} of the pilot episode of Lost, creators J.J.

Johnson and Christian Taylor—to elaborate ideas on how the show could continue. The resulting [...] "Writer's Guide" [...] plus a positive reaction to the pilot made ABC pick up the show. The season one writing begun on May 2004, with the first episode being centered on Kate and following the guidelines of a self-contained script grounded in reality. The script, credited to Lindelof, was finished by June. It was the first episode directed by Jack Bender, {{who came to the}} show following an invitation by Abrams. The episode is named [...] "Tabula Rasa" [...] after the Latin term meaning [...] "blank slate", a concept attributed to the philosopher John Locke regarding how he believed humans are born without built-in mental content, then filled through their life experiences. Said concept is echoed by the final line of the episode, where Jack suggests the crash made the survivors into blank slates that could restart.|$|E
500|$|During {{recording}} {{there was}} pressure from I.R.S. Records {{to try to}} make the album more commercial. The label sent messages to Dixon and Easter, which the producers told the band that they would ignore. While the producers respected I.R.S. president Jay Boberg, they expressed dismay at the comments he made when he visited during the last day of sessions. Dixon called Boberg [...] "record company clueless", while Easter said [...] "I <b>got</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> Jay Boberg OK [...] but now and again he would express an opinion that would make me think, 'holy shit', because it would strike me as really teenage." [...] Buck said he was grateful that Dixon and Easter acted as a buffer between the band and its label. He said that [...] "it got to the point where as much as I respected the guys at I.R.S., we basically tried to record the records so they wouldn't know we were recording them!", and explained that part of the reason why R.E.M. recorded the album so quickly was that the group wanted to finish before representatives from I.R.S. showed up to listen to it.|$|E

500|$|Daniel Cowart is of English {{descent and}} {{was raised in}} Bells, Tennessee. He had a strong {{interest}} in computers and had no criminal record. Cowart attended Jackson Christian School until 2006, but did not graduate. [...] He was expelled from Jackson Christian after calling in a bomb threat. He applied for Jackson State Community College to study computers but, although his family believed he was indeed attending the school, he never provided documentation or pursued other steps to enroll there. Cowart moved to Texas in the spring of 2007 to live with friends he met on the Internet, but was unable to find work and returned to Bells to live with his grandparents a month later. Cowart worked at a Bells grocery store called the Bells Market Place for one year until May 2007 before moving to Texas for a brief time. Cowart worked and <b>got</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> several minority co-workers, who later expressed shock at his arrest. Mitchell Twitty, a black former co-worker, said of Cowart, [...] "He treated me like we were best friends. I never, ever heard him make a racist remark." [...] Twitty said Cowart tended to keep to himself and at times acted [...] "a little strange." [...] Other co-workers described him as hard-working and friendly, but said he did not have many friends. One family friend thought he was intelligent and full of potential: [...] "I always saw him as a doctor or lawyer, or even a senator. He even had the potential to become what Obama is, running for president." ...|$|E
500|$|The Senate {{confirmed}} Arthur's appointment; as Collector he controlled {{nearly a}} thousand jobs and received compensation {{as great as}} any federal officeholder. Arthur's salary was initially $6,500, but senior customs employees were compensated additionally by the [...] "moiety" [...] system, which awarded them {{a percentage of the}} cargoes seized and fines levied on importers who attempted to evade the tariff. [...] In total, his income came to more than $50,000—more than the president's salary, and more than enough for him to enjoy fashionable clothes and a lavish lifestyle. Among those who dealt with the Custom House, Arthur was one of the era's more popular collectors. [...] He <b>got</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> his subordinates and, since Murphy had already filled the staff with Conkling's adherents, he had few occasions to fire anyone. [...] He was also popular within the Republican party as he efficiently collected campaign assessments from the staff and placed party leaders' friends in jobs as positions became available. Arthur had a better reputation than Murphy, but reformers still criticized the patronage structure and the moiety system as corrupt. A rising tide of reform within the party caused Arthur to rename the financial extractions from employees as [...] "voluntary contributions" [...] in 1872, but the concept remained, and the party reaped the benefit of controlling government jobs. In that year, reform-minded Republicans formed the Liberal Republican party and voted against Grant, but he was re-elected in spite of their opposition. Nevertheless, the movement for civil service reform continued to chip away at Conkling's patronage machine; in 1874 Custom House employees were found to have improperly assessed fines against an importing company as a way to increase their own incomes, and Congress reacted, repealing the moiety system and putting the staff, including Arthur, on regular salaries. As a result, his income dropped to $12,000 a year—more than his nominal boss, the Secretary of the Treasury, but far less than what he had previously received.|$|E
