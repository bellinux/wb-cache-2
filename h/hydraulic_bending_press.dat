Large-radius punches provide a typical approach for decreasing deformations during the bending process. However, as deflection progresses the loading scheme changes gradually.

In the current contribution, the authors implemented a plane frictional contact element based on the penalty method.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} parameters in designing a capsule transporting pipeline is the pressure drop in the pipes carrying capsules and associated pipe fittings such as bends etc. Capsules are hollow containers with typically cylindrical or spherical shapes flowing in the pipeline along with the carrier fluid. The dynamic behavior of a long train of capsules depends on the behavior of each capsule in the train and the hydrodynamic influence of one capsule on another. Researchers so far have used rather simplified empirical and semi-empirical correlations for pressure drop calculations, the range and application of which are fairly limited. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) based techniques have been used to analyze the effect of the presence of solid phase in <b>hydraulic</b> <b>bends.</b> A steady state numerical solution has been obtained from the equations governing turbulent flow in pipe bends carrying spherical capsule train consisting of one to four capsules. The bends under consideration are of 45 ⁰ and 90 ⁰ with an inner diameter of 0. 1 m. The investigation was carried out in the practical range of 0. 2 ≤Vb≥ 1. 6 m/sec.

The stress intensity factors (SIFs) along the front of an initial semielliptical crack, initiated from the external surface of a shaft, were calculated for 4 different load cases: <b>bending,</b> <b>press</b> fit, shear, and torsion. The methods used for the SIF assessment along the crack front were the J-integral for BEASY and ZC and the quarter point element stress method for CT 3 D.

The kink angles were evaluated by using the minimum strain energy density and maximum tangential stress criteria for BEASY, the maximum energy release rate and maximum tangential stress for ZC, and the maximum principal asymptotic stress for CT 3 D.
