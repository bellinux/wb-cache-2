25|$|An {{important}} impetus {{toward the}} formation of the Antarctic Treaty System in 1959, was the International Geophysical Year, 1957-1958. This year of <b>international</b> <b>scientific</b> <b>cooperation</b> triggered an 18-month period of intense Antarctic science. More than 70 existing national scientific organizations then formed IGY committees, and participated in the cooperative effort. The British established Halley Research Station in 1956 by an expedition from the Royal Society. Sir Vivian Fuchs headed the Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition, which completed the first overland crossing of Antarctica in 1958. In Japan, the Japan Maritime Safety Agency offered ice breaker Sōya as the South Pole observation ship and Showa Station was built as the first Japanese observation base on Antarctica.|$|E
500|$|Like {{all other}} {{territorial}} claims in Antarctica, the Norwegian claim of Queen Maud Land (along with its claim of Peter I Island) {{is subject to}} the Antarctic Treaty System. The treaty makes clear that Antarctica can only be used for peaceful purposes and assures the freedom of scientific activity. It promotes <b>international</b> <b>scientific</b> <b>cooperation</b> and bans any nuclear-related activities. Although territorial claims are not invalidated by the treaty, all claims under Article III of the treaty are in effect suspended {{as long as it is}} in force. Norway, Australia, France, New Zealand and the United Kingdom have all mutually recognised each other's claims in Antarctica. But there is a question on the actual boundaries of the claim, since the initial Norwegian demarcations both towards the South Pole and into the sea were left unclear. [...] Apparently this was to avoid accepting use of the [...] "sector principle" [...] for Arctic Ocean claims by the Soviet Union. [...] However, in 2015 the Norwegian Parliament specified that its national claim extended to the Pole. [...] Since, as noted above, Article III of the Antarctic Treaty specifically states that, [...] "No new claim, or enlargement of an existing claim to territorial sovereignty in Antarctica shall be asserted while the present Treaty is in force", this leaves the matter uncertain.|$|E
