5|$|At 23:30, Fleet and Lee {{noticed a}} slight haze {{on the horizon}} ahead of them, but did not make {{anything}} of it. Some experts now believe that this haze was actually a mirage caused by cold waters meeting warm air (similar to a water mirage in the desert) when Titanic entered Iceberg Alley.

5|$|The first {{reliable}} {{report of}} Malcolm II's reign {{is of an}} invasion of Bernicia in 1006, perhaps the customary crech ríg (literally royal prey, a raid by a new king made to demonstrate prowess in war), which involved a siege of Durham. This appears to <b>have</b> <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> heavy defeat by the Northumbrians, led by Uhtred of Bamburgh, later Earl of Bernicia, which is reported by the Annals of Ulster.|$|E
5|$|Across Britain, many hill forts {{fell out}} of use in the 100years {{around the turn of}} the millennium. It has been {{suggested}} that this, and the contemporary change in material culture of the Britons (such as the introduction of coinage and cemeteries and an increase in craft industries), was caused by increased interaction with the Roman Empire. The developing industries may <b>have</b> <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> shift away from the hill fort elites, whose power was based on agriculture. Such change is not as obvious in Dorset as it is in the rest of Britain, but there is a trend for abandonment of hill forts in the area and a proliferation of small undefended farmsteads, indicating a migration of the population.|$|E

5|$|Another {{instance}} of population control is {{the prevalence of}} female infanticide. People in rural areas practiced female infanticide and selective neglect due to a preference of sons over daughters. Since the 1980s, roughly 200,000 female infants would be killed per {{year because of the}} preference for male children and the advancement in technologies such as ultrasound, which help to find out the sex of the fetus. In addition to female infanticide, girls are being unregistered or are abandoned by their families, which stops them from receiving education and legal benefits the government offered. These methods of controlling population <b>have</b> <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> huge gender gap in China.|$|E
5|$|The 2008 Giro {{featured}} {{an assortment}} of contenders for the overall victory. Defending champion Danilo Di Luca had faced potential bans which would have {{kept him out of}} the race, after investigations into his involvement with the Oil for Drugs scandal and an irregular doping test given after stage 17 of the 2007 Giro d'Italia, either of which could <b>have</b> <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> two-year suspension. Though he was suspended for three months because of Oil for Drugs, he was cleared by the Italian National Olympic Committee of any wrongdoing in the 2007 Giro, and was thus permitted to start.|$|E
5|$|The Mission {{site had}} been under study for {{conservation}} since 2002. The three main buildings on the site were eventually gazetted for conservation in 2006, and hence the site was inappropriate for acquisition. Although the appellant had argued that a football field on the Mission site should have been acquired instead of the temple property, the three main buildings were functionally integrated and acquisition of part of the Mission site would <b>have</b> <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> plot of state land that was highly irregular in shape. In any case, the appellant's argument did not relate to proper land use planning.|$|E

5|$|The Vikings won {{the coin}} toss and started {{overtime}} with {{possession of the}} football on their own 29-yard line, but managed to convert only one first down and punted to Atlanta. The Falcons drove to their own 41-yard line before being stopped on 3rd down, and they punted the ball back to Vikings. On the ensuing drive, Cunningham attempted a deep pass to Moss that was narrowly broken up by Eugene Robinson; had the pass been completed, it most likely would <b>have</b> <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> touchdown and victory for the Vikings. Instead, the Vikings had to punt on 4th down again. The Falcons then drove to the Vikings' 21-yard line, where Morten Andersen converted a 38-yard field goal for the win.|$|E
5|$|The {{geographical}} {{isolation and}} recent glacial history of Shetland <b>have</b> <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> depleted mammalian fauna and the brown rat and house mouse {{are two of}} only three species of rodent present on the islands. The Shetland field mouse is the third and the archipelago's fourth endemic subspecies, {{of which there are}} three varieties on Yell, Foula and Fair Isle. They are variants of Apodemus sylvaticus and archaeological evidence suggests that this species was present during the Middle Iron Age (around 200 BC to AD 400). It is possible that Apodemus was introduced from Orkney where a population has existed since at the least the Bronze Age.|$|E
5|$|The lesser kudu's shyness and {{its ability}} to {{camouflage}} itself in dense cover has protected it from the risks of poaching. For instance, the lesser kudu is widespread in the Ogaden region, which is rich in dense bush, despite reckless hunting by local people. However, rinderpest outbreaks, to which the lesser kudu is highly susceptible, <b>have</b> <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> steep decline of 60% in the animal's population in Tsavo National Park in Kenya. Overgrazing, human settlement, and loss of habitat are some other threats to the survival of the lesser kudu.|$|E
5|$|Human {{impact on}} the {{environment}} <b>has</b> <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> increase <b>in</b> the intrabreeding between species, with introduced species worldwide, which <b>has</b> <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> increase <b>in</b> hybridization. The genetic mixing may threaten many species with extinction, while genetic erosion in crop plants may be damaging the gene pools of many species for future breeding. Many commercially useful fruits, flowers, garden herbs and trees have been produced by hybridization. One flower, Oenothera lamarckiana, was central to early genetics research into mutationism and polyploidy.|$|R

5|$|The pygmy slow loris has {{declined}} in numbers {{as a result}} of extensive habitat degradation throughout its range, including north-eastern Cambodia, the Yunnan Province of China, and Vietnam. In Yunnan province, nearly all primary evergreen forests have vanished and secondary forests have been heavily degraded; as of 2005, forest cover has been reduced by 42% since the mid-1990s. The use of defoliants, such as Agent Orange, during the Vietnam War and the ongoing clearing of forests in Vietnam <b>have</b> <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> considerable loss of habitat. As of 2003, the forest cover had been reduced to 30% of its original area, with only 10% of the remaining forest consisting of the closed-canopy forests preferred by the pygmy slow loris.|$|E
5|$|This {{came to a}} head at {{a meeting}} {{sponsored}} by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) in Oxford in 1981. The methodologies and research questions of the participants were considered so different that the conference proceedings were published as two volumes. Nevertheless, the conference was considered a success in bringing researchers together and Oxford conferences have continued every four or five years at locations around the world. The subsequent conferences <b>have</b> <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> move to more interdisciplinary approaches with researchers aiming to combine the contextuality of archaeological research, which broadly describes the state of archaeoastronomy today, rather than merely establishing the existence of ancient astronomies, archaeoastronomers seek to explain why people would have an interest in the night sky.|$|E
5|$|William John Bankes {{collected}} {{most of the}} house's antiquities.

Most notable is the Philae obelisk which stands prominently in {{the grounds of the}} house. When in Genoa he acquired the portrait of Maria di Antonio Serra, by Sir Peter Paul Rubens, painted on the occasion of her marriage to Duke Nicolò Pallavicini in 1606. In 1841, after being caught in a homosexual scandal that could <b>have</b> <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> trial and his execution, William John fled the country for Italy.

5|$|William and Jim Anderson soon {{formed a}} gang {{with a man}} named Bill Reed; in February 1863, the Lexington Weekly Union {{recorded}} that Reed {{was the leader of}} the gang. In his 2003 history of Civil War Missouri, Bruce Nichols stated that Reed led the gang until mid-July of that year. William Quantrill, a Confederate guerrilla leader, later claimed to have encountered them in July and rebuked them for robbing Confederate sympathizers; in their biography of Anderson, Albert Castel and Tom Goodrich speculate that this rebuke may <b>have</b> <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> deep resentment of Quantrill by Anderson. Anderson and his gang subsequently traveled east of Jackson County, Missouri, avoiding territory where Quantrill operated and continuing to support themselves by robbery. They also attacked Union soldiers, killing seven by early 1863.|$|E
5|$|After the Soviet–Lithuanian Peace Treaty was {{ratified}} in 1920, the Russian SFSR recognized Lithuanian {{claims to}} the Vilnius Region and continued to support them. In its responses to the 1938 ultimatum, the Soviet Union expressed concerns over Lithuania's independence and threatened to abrogate the Soviet–Polish Non-Aggression Pact of 1932. It made it clear, though, {{that it did not}} wish to be drawn into an armed conflict. This stance has been attributed to the growth of a threat from Japan; armed assistance to Lithuania would have required the Red Army to invade either Poland or Latvia and could <b>have</b> <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> war on two fronts. The Soviets urged France, a major ally of Poland at the time, to de-escalate the conflict and encourage a more moderate version of the ultimatum. France and the United Kingdom, preoccupied with the Anschluss, pressured Lithuania to normalize the relationship with Poland as soon as possible. They feared that the ultimatum had been approved by Nazi Germany.|$|E
5|$|Another {{feature of}} the wing was its washout. The {{trailing}} edge of the wing twisted slightly upward along its span, the angle of incidence decreasing from +2° at its root to -½° at its tip. This caused the wing roots to stall before the tips, reducing tip-stall that could otherwise <b>have</b> <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> wing drop, often leading to a spin. As the wing roots started to stall, the separating air stream started to buffet (vibrate) the aircraft, warning the pilot, and hence allowing even relatively inexperienced pilots to fly the aircraft {{to the limits of}} its performance. This washout was first featured in the wing of the Type 224 and became a consistent feature in subsequent designs leading to the Spitfire. The complexity of the wing design, especially the precision required to manufacture the vital spar and leading-edge structures, at first caused some major hold-ups in the production of the Spitfire. The problems increased when the work was put out to subcontractors, most of whom had never dealt with metal-structured, high-speed aircraft. By June 1939, most of these problems had been resolved, and production was no longer held up by a lack of wings.|$|E
