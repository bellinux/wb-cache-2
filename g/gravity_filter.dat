40|$|Problem statement. A {{problem of}} {{mathematical}} modeling and intensification of {{operation of the}} flow thermal diffusion chamber of the condensation <b>gravity</b> <b>filter</b> {{as one of the}} most efficient air filter is solved. Results and conclusions. This paper presents an example of the practical application of the model of heat and mass exchange in the thermodiffusion chamber as the main operating element of condensation <b>gravity</b> <b>filter</b> for high-performance air purification due to the generation of supersaturation fields with controlled properties. A criterion for quantitative assessment of purification efficiency in the form of breakthrough function is developed. The typical results of numerical modeling of the operation of the condensation gravity-type filter are presented for the most common case in practice. The possibility of intensification of the filter operation either at the stage of use or at the stage of design is shown based on the proposed approach, obtained models, and calculations...|$|E

The ASTM classifies particles passing through an 80-mesh sieve (0.177mm) and smaller as PAC. It is not common to use PAC in a dedicated vessel, due to the high head loss that would occur. Instead, PAC is generally added directly to other process units, such as raw water intakes, rapid mix basins, clarifiers, and <b>gravity</b> <b>filters.</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Biomass and {{microbial}} {{activity in}} backwashing processes of a biofilter for tertiary treatment were investigated. The microbial groups revealed new distribution along the biofilter depth after {{low flow rate}} backwashing for a short time. Then the start-up process was accelerated by backwashing. The biomass profile and microbial activity profile both varying with depth before and after backwashing, can be mathematically described by quadratic equations. Using the profiles, the difference of oxygen demand can be calculated to determine the airflow rate during backwashing. Combined with the difference between biofilters and rapid <b>gravity</b> <b>filters,</b> analysis of biomass and microbial activity can determine more accurately the required airflow rate during backwashing...|$|R

40|$|The {{rapid rate}} <b>gravity</b> <b>filter</b> is {{commonly}} used {{in the treatment of}} surface water supplies. It consists of a structure to house the unit, the filter media, an under- rain system, a surface washer, and a waste disposal system. The filter area should be divided into at least two separate units to allow operational flexibility. Some form of pre-treatment of the raw water, such as sedimentation, is usually needed. In the filtering process, water flows onto the top of the filter media and is driven through it by gravity. In passing through the small spaces between the filter's grains, impurities are removed. The water continues its way through the support gravel, enters the under-drainage system, and then flows to the reservoir. It is the filter media, composed of sand or anthracite, which actually removes the particles from the water. The filter media is routinely cleaned by means of a backwashing process...|$|E
40|$|Epidemiological risk {{estimates}} {{point toward}} potential health risks posed by disinfection by-products (DBPs) in chlorinated drinking water. Point-of-use filters can effectively remove regulated DBPs from tap water but {{the removal of}} unknown DBPs and toxicity {{has not yet been}} assessed. We evaluated 11 tap water filters for their efficacy to abate fluoride, bacteria, and adsorbable organic halogens (AOX) as the sum parameter of known and unknown halogenated DBPs. Biological effects were quantified in water samples enriched with solid phase extraction by use of the Microtox assay for bacterial cytotoxicity, the AREc 32 assay for oxidative stress response, and the umuC assay for genotoxicity. Six out of 11 filters effectively removed chlorinated and brominated organic halogens by > 60 %. Reverse osmosis and one activated carbon based <b>gravity</b> <b>filter</b> were most effective (> 94 % AOX removal). Four out of five non-membrane pressure filters were less effective for AOX abatement than four out of five activated carbon based gravity filters. Renewal of the filter cartridges significantly improved AOX removal efficacies. Fluoride was removed by > 83 % only by reverse osmosis and two filters specifically designed for fluoride removal by use of activated alumina. Bacterial counts increased after filtration with most filters, indicating biofilm growth on the filter matrix. Cartridge renewal decreased bacterial counts. Seven out of 11 filters reduced cytotoxicity, oxidative stress response, and genotoxicity by > 60 %. Activated carbon based tap water filters could provide an important short-term public health benefit through removal of halogenated DBPs, but regular filter cartridge exchange is critical to maintain a good filter efficacy...|$|E

40|$|Riyadh Municipal Treatment Plant has a {{capacity}} of 200, 000 m 3 /day of wastewater. Wastewater is screened, de-gritted and aerated in two-parallel basins. The aerated sewage is then distributed to four primary sedimentation tanks. The clarified liquor is then subjected to biological treatment based on the activated sludge process with nitrification/denitrification in a single tank. The liquor passes alternating aerobic and anoxic zones. The biological treated liquor is then distributed to 12 secondary sedimentation tanks for separation of clarified water and sludge withdrawal. The clarified water is treated in sand <b>gravity</b> <b>filters.</b> Finally it undergoes chlorination. The reuse of treated municipal wastewater for irrigation is the oldest and largest reuse.

40|$|Rapid <b>gravity</b> <b>filters,</b> {{the final}} {{particulate}} barrier in many water treatment systems, are typically monitored using on-line turbidity, flow and head loss instrumentation. Current metrics for assessing filtration performance from on-line turbidity data were critically assessed and observed not to effectively and consistently summarise the important properties of a turbidity distribution {{and the associated}} water quality risk. In {{the absence of a}} consistent risk function for turbidity in treated water, using on-line turbidity as an indicative rather than a quantitative variable appears to be more practical. Best practice suggests that filtered water turbidity should be maintained below 0. 1 NTU, at higher turbidity we can be less confident of an effective particle and pathogen barrier. Based on this simple distinction filtration performance has been described in terms of reliability and resilience by characterising the likelihood, frequency and duration of turbidity spikes greater than 0. 1 NTU. This view of filtration performance is then used to frame operational diagnosis of unsatisfactory performance in terms of a machine learning classification problem. Through calculation of operationally relevant predictor variables and application of the Classification and Regression Tree (CART) algorithm the conditions associated with the greatest risk of poor filtration performance can be effectively modelled and communicated in operational terms. This provides a method for an evidence based decision support which can be used to efficiently manage individual pathogen barriers in a multi-barrier system...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} effects of changes in the Earth's {{magnetic}} field between 1900 and 2000 on the whole atmosphere (0 – 500 [*]km altitude), based on simulations with the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model eXtension. Magnetic field changes directly affect the temperature and wind in the upper atmosphere (> ~ 110 [*]km) via Joule heating and the ion drag force. However, we also find significant responses in zonal mean temperature and zonal wind in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) middle- to high-latitude troposphere, stratosphere, and mesosphere of up to ± 2 [*]K and ± 2 [*]m/s, as well as regionally significant changes in Northern Hemisphere (NH) polar surface temperatures of up to ± 1. 3 [*]K, in December-January-February. In the SH, changes in <b>gravity</b> wave <b>filtering</b> in the thermosphere induce a change in the residual circulation that extends down into the upper mesosphere, where further changes in the mean wind climatology are generated, together with changes in local planetary wave generation and/or amplification and <b>gravity</b> wave <b>filtering.</b> This induces further changes to a residual circulation cell extending down into the troposphere. However, inaccuracies in the simulated SH upper mesospheric wind climatology probably mean that the simulated temperature and wind responses in the SH lower and middle atmosphere are also inaccurate. The NH middle atmosphere response is zonally asymmetric, consisting of a significant change in the positioning and shape of the upper stratospheric polar vortex, which is dynamically consistent with the surface temperature response. However, the downward coupling mechanism in the NH is generally less clea...|$|R

40|$|A {{geophysical}} survey using gravity method {{was conducted at}} Bukit Bunuh, Lenggong, Perak, Malaysia, to determine the occurrence of a subsurface impact crater, based on the discovery of meteorite impact rock, suevite, in the study area. A standard correction was applied to all the gravity data to produce Bouguer gravity anomaly of the study area. The Bouguer gravity anomaly was used to produce several maps of <b>gravity</b> anomalies by <b>filtering</b> processes and relate them to the geological structure and tectonic history of the study area. Data processing and interpretation were conducted using geophysical software, Oasis Montaj. This software was used {{in a number of}} <b>gravity</b> data <b>filtering</b> processes, such as Low Pass Filter (LPF) and the Total Horizontal Derivative (THD). Bouguer gravity anomaly map shows a circular structure in Bukit Bunuh area which is interpreted as a remnant of meteorite impact crater. The gravity anomaly appears to decrease {{from the edge of the}} crater and increases at the center. This feature indicates a complex crater structure which has central uplift. The Total Horizontal Derivative map of residual gravity anomaly shows structural trend such as lineaments and faults that dominant to the northwest‐southeast direction. A model was produced using GM‐SYS 3 D software to determine the geometry of the impact crater. The interpreted 3 ‐D model shows a diameter of the impact crater was approximately 2368 m and depth of about 400 m.

The planetary waves seen in the TIMED/SABER temperature data in the latitudinal range 50 °N– 50 °S are studied in detail. The altitude and latitude structures of the planetary wave (stationary and travelling) clearly indicate that the stratosphere and mesosphere (30 - 90 km) are coupled by direct vertical propagation of the planetary waves, while the lower thermosphere (above 90 - 95 km altitude) is only partly connected with the lower levels probably indirectly through in-situ generation of disturbances by the dissipation and breaking of <b>gravity</b> waves <b>filtered</b> by lower atmospheric planetary waves.

40|$|An {{inversion}} {{method that}} solves for a parameter {{as a continuous}} function (Backus-Gilbert) is {{used to determine the}} lower boundary of a two and one-half dimensional body which causes either a gravity or a magnetic anomaly and then assesses the vertical accuracy (variance) and the lateral resolution (spread). Also the gravity and magnetic data are simultaneously inverted and this procedure improves the resolution of the model over that obtained by inverting either data set individually. The usefulness of the Backus-Gilbert approach is evaluated by a study of the inversion of both synthetic gravity and magnetic data. The convergence characteristics, the amount of data and the distribution of data, the role of incorrect or correct parameters and the integration technique was considered. Gravity and magnetic data from the Sanford Basin, North Carolina are used to illustrate the inversion procedure. The second and third part of this study concerns the interpretation of regional geophysical data to obtain an idea of the crustal structure of the eastern Mojave Desert in California and western Arizona. The analysis of gravity and magnetic data in the Mojave Desert included the construction of Bouguer gravity, magnetic intensity, low and high band pass, and horizontal gradient maps. Based on the 100 - 250 km band pass <b>gravity</b> <b>filtered</b> map, four terranes were described: (1) Colorado River extensional corridor; (2) eastern Mojave gravity low; (3) Granite Mountain fault and (4) Colorado Plateau. Gravity modeling, geologic mapping and seismic refraction data indicate that the eastern Mojave gravity low is caused by a combination of low density Mesozoic intrusive rocks emplaced at depths of 8 - 9 km and a thickening of the crust. The Colorado River extensional corridor is underlain by a high density mid-crustal mylonitic zone based on seismic reflection and refraction data and gravity modeling. Analysis of gravity, magnetic and magnetotelluric data along a profile in western Arizona included the construction of Bouguer gravity and magnetic intensity maps, gravity and magnetotelluric crustal models, and the depth to the Curie isotherm. Low Bouguer gravity values, shallow Curie point depths and low resistivity values in the Castle Dome and Aquarius-Mohon Mountains indicate the potential of geothermal resources.
