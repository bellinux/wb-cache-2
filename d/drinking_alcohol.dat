40|$|Adolescent <b>alcohol</b> <b>drinking</b> {{increases}} the risk for alcohol-use disorder in adulthood. Yet, the changes in adult neural function resulting from adolescent <b>alcohol</b> <b>drinking</b> remain poorly understood. We hypothesized that adolescent <b>alcohol</b> <b>drinking</b> alters basolateral amygdala (BLA) function, making <b>alcohol</b> <b>drinking</b> BLA-dependent in adulthood. Male, Long Evans rats were given voluntary, intermittent access to alcohol (20 % ethanol) or a bitter, isocaloric control solution, across adolescence. Half of the rats in each group received neurotoxic BLA lesions. In adulthood, all rats were given voluntary, intermittent access to alcohol. BLA lesions reduced adult <b>alcohol</b> <b>drinking</b> in rats receiving adolescent access to alcohol, but not in rats receiving adolescent access to the control solution. The effect of the BLA lesion was most apparent in high <b>alcohol</b> <b>drinking</b> adolescent rats. The BLA is essential for fear learning and is hyper-active in anxiety disorders. The {{results are consistent with}} adolescent heavy <b>alcohol</b> <b>drinking</b> inducing BLA hyper-activity, providing a neural mechanism for comorbid alcohol use disorder and anxiety disorders...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACTObjectiveThe {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to estimate health-care costs because of diseases caused by alcohol consumption based on health system's perspective. MethodsTotal direct health-care costs of <b>alcohol</b> <b>drinking</b> were the summation of the costs of <b>alcohol</b> <b>drinking</b> in inpatient and outpatient departments due to chronic diseases and acute conditions using prevalence-based approach. The alcohol-attributable fractions, defined as the proportion of a disease or acute condition in a population attributable to <b>alcohol</b> <b>drinking,</b> were calculated to obtain the number of patients in each disease or acute condition attributable to <b>alcohol</b> <b>drinking.</b> Health-care costs of <b>alcohol</b> <b>drinking</b> were estimated by multiplying the number of patients in each disease category attributable to <b>alcohol</b> <b>drinking</b> with the unit cost of treatment. ResultsTotal health-care costs attributed to alcohol in this research were 5491 million baht (i. e., outpatient department [2488 million baht] and inpatient department [3003 million baht]). Cost derived from inpatient department accounted for 55 % of the total health-care cost attributed to alcohol. ConclusionsThe result of this study suggested that <b>alcohol</b> <b>drinking</b> was significantly associated with a large number of health-care costs in Thailand. Estimation of health-care costs related to <b>alcohol</b> <b>drinking</b> would provide an important insight into future policy appraisal and evaluation...|$|R

40|$|Background Prazosin (PRZ, an α 1 -adrenergic {{receptor}} antagonist) and naltrexone (NTX, a non-specific {{opioid receptor}} antagonist) each decrease <b>alcohol</b> <b>drinking</b> when administered to rats selectively-bred for high voluntary <b>alcohol</b> <b>drinking</b> (alcohol-preferring, or “P”), {{and the combination}} of PRZ+NTX decreases <b>alcohol</b> <b>drinking</b> more effectively than does either drug alone. Since drug responsiveness can depend on history of <b>alcohol</b> <b>drinking</b> and dependence, we investigated whether various schedules of PRZ and NTX administration, alone or in combination, are effective in decreasing <b>alcohol</b> <b>drinking</b> in male P rats {{with a history of}} protracted voluntary <b>alcohol</b> <b>drinking,</b> dependence and repeated withdrawals closely resembling human alcoholism. Methods Male P rats became alcohol-dependent during 1 year of ad libitum 24 h/day access to food, water and 20 % alcohol with repetitive temporary alcohol withdrawals. Four sequential studies then addressed effects of oral PRZ (2 mg/kg) and NTX (10 mg/kg), alone or together, on <b>alcohol</b> <b>drinking</b> during: 1) daily alcohol access with daily drug treatment, 2) intermittent alcohol access with daily drug treatment, 3) intermittent alcohol access with occasional drug treatment, and 4) post-deprivation reinstatement of alcohol access. Results The combination of PRZ+NTX consistently suppressed <b>alcohol</b> <b>drinking</b> during daily or intermittent alcohol access conditions and when drug treatment was either daily or occasional. PRZ+NTX was consistently more effective than either drug alone. The reduction in <b>alcohol</b> <b>drinking</b> was not due to sedation, motor effects or malaise. Conclusions Both daily and “as-needed” treatment with PRZ+NTX are highly effective in suppressing daily, intermittent and post-deprivation <b>alcohol</b> <b>drinking</b> in male P rats with a protracted history of alcohol dependence and repeated withdrawals. This drug combination may be especially effective for treating individuals with long histories of heavy alcohol abuse, dependence and repeated relapse, as commonly encountered in clinical practice...|$|R

40|$|There is a {{relation}} between stress and <b>alcohol</b> <b>drinking.</b> We {{show that the}} corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) system that mediates endocrine and behavioral responses to stress {{plays a role in}} the control of long-term <b>alcohol</b> <b>drinking.</b> In mice lacking a functional CRH 1 receptor, stress leads to enhanced and progressively increasing alcohol intake. The effect of repeated stress on <b>alcohol</b> <b>drinking</b> behavior appeared with a delay and persisted throughout life. It was associated with an up-regulation of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor subunit NR 2 B.

40|$|Abstract—Aims: To {{compare the}} {{performance}} of competing and complementary interventions for prevention or treatment of problem <b>drinking</b> and <b>alcohol</b> dependence. To provide {{an example of how}} health maximising decision-makers might use performance measures such as cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) league tables to formulate an optimal package of interventions for problem <b>drinking</b> and <b>alcohol</b> dependence. Methods: A time-dependent state-transition model was used to estimate QALYs gained per person for each intervention as compared to usual care in the relevant target population. Results: Cost per QALY estimates for each of the interventions fall below any putative funding threshold for developed economies. Interventions for problem drinkers appear to offer better value than interventions targeted at those with a history of severe physical dependence. Conclusions: Formularies such as Australia’s Medicare should include a comprehensive package of interventions for problem <b>drinking</b> and <b>alcohol</b> dependence...|$|R
