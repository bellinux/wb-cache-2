METHOD Surveyed group was composed of last-year students of two sports grammar schools chosen from all sports grammar schools in the Czech Republic. The second or more precisely the third group consisted of students of University of Defence in Brno. In total, 125 students were tested. The coefficient of correlation, the important statistic ratio, is determined by the method test-retest. The study represents an empiric quantitative observative research. The results will contribute to standardization of the test of carrying the load.

40|$|The Acid Mine Drainage (AMD) {{potential}} of rocks at an exploration {{project on the}} Platreef in the northern limb of the Bushveld Complex has been investigated. The Platreef Project, at an advanced stage of exploration, is located north of Mokopane in the Limpopo Province of South Africa. A total of 242 samples were selected from borehole core and 11 tailings samples were obtained from Mintek Laboratory. Quality control samples were inserted and all the rock samples were dispatched for whole rock geochemistry and static Acid Base Accounting (ABA) analysis. Once the static ABA results were received, a sub-set of 20 samples was selected for <b>kinetic</b> <b>test</b> analysis. Of the tailings samples, three were sent for whole rock geochemistry analysis, six for static ABA analysis and five for <b>kinetic</b> <b>test</b> analysis. Using criteria developed {{within the context of}} coal mining in South Africa and based on international criteria, the static ABA results were used to classify the rocks according to acid producing potential. These results revealed that high risk acid producing (Pegmatitic Gabbro-Norite, Melanorite, Norite Cycles, Feldspathic Pyroxenite, Hornfels and Marginal Zone Norite) and low risk acid producing rock-types (Pyroxenite, Dolerite, Quartz Feldspar, Aplite) may be mined at the Platreef site. The <b>kinetic</b> <b>test</b> and whole rock geochemistry results provided further insight into the acid producing {{potential of}} the rock types and revealed that Gabbro-Norite and Dolomite (altered to Calcsilicate Hornfels) have the potential to generate acid despite being classified as non-acid generating/potentially acid neutralizing. The tailings results proved contradictory and this is thought to be due to non-representative sampling. It is recommended that a new suite of representative tailings samples be generated and sent for static ABA and <b>kinetic</b> <b>test</b> analysis once the metallurgical treatment process has been finalised. Future work should be directed to better understand the merits and downfalls of the different analytical methods used to quantify AMD in order to better interpret contradictory results. This laboratory based analysis of AMD potential provides a “worse case scenario” of the rock types to be mined. Weighted volume calculations of the mean sulphur content and the mean Net Neutralising Potential (Closed) of material to be mined initially on Turfspruit indicate that it is unlikely that AMD will be generated from the tailings dams or waste rock piles generated from mining in this region. This study has shown, however, that AMD could result if high risk acid producing Platreef material is stockpiled at the site prior to treatment for extended periods of time. Local zones of potentially acid-producing material may occur within rock volumes dumped over the Life of Mine (Marginal Zone Norite, Hornfels, Gabbro-Norite, and Dolomite) or exposed in the pit floor (Marginal Zone Norite, Hornfels, Dolomite), and these should be managed carefully to ensure that AMD does not result. The Quartzite samples produced contradictory results during this study and, as this rock type occurs in the Footwall to the Platreef, it is recommended that further Quartzite samples be sent for static ABA and <b>kinetic</b> <b>test</b> analyses. This study has identified the potential AMD risks facing the future mine at the Platreef Project and will enable the mine management to minimize these risks during the mine design phase. These results should fit into a larger framework of objectives and on-site conditions with time in order to effectively manage AMD risk over the Life of Mine...|$|E

40|$|The {{potential}} for mobilization of SO 4 and Cl from coal stockpiles and coal processing waste and refuse (waste rock) disposal areas to the receiving streams and groundwater is an environmental concern and proper management practices {{are necessary to}} minimize {{the impact of these}} discharges. In an effort to characterize the long-term environmental impact of weathering in from both a typical coal stockpile and coal waste disposal areas a series of laboratory- scale and field-scale <b>kinetic</b> <b>tests</b> were performed with the ultimate goal of improving both coal and coal waste management at coal mines in a manner that minimizes the discharge of sulfate (SO 4) and chloride (Cl). Laboratory experiments demonstrated that <b>kinetic</b> <b>testing</b> is a productive method for understanding the chemistry of surface water discharges from coal stock piles. However, these tests proved to be problematic in simulating the weathering of coal refuse. In an effort to improve the <b>kinetic</b> <b>tests,</b> field test columns were constructed that eliminated this deficiency. Unfortunately, field-scale test columns were found to be difficult to construct and, due to extremes weather events, difficult to maintain for an adequate test period. In the course of the experiment elemental and mineralogical data were collected both before and after weathering of fresh, run-of-mine coal from the Springfield (No. 5) coal seam and coal refuse samples from processing the Springfield (No. 5) and Herrin (No. 6) coal seams.

Batch <b>kinetic</b> <b>tests</b> of natural organic matter adsorption were conducted with all types of granular activated carbon at first. For description of sorption not only the batch <b>kinetic</b> <b>tests</b> and duration needed for setting equilibrium were observed, but also the process decreasing of concentration of natural organic matters to the value of equilibrium concentration known as adsorption equilibrium was followed...|$|R
40|$|Biodegradation {{kinetics}} of 4 -nitrophenol (4 NP) {{was investigated}} in a lab-scale sequencing batch reactor fed with the compound as the sole carbon source. The experimental results showed that complete 4 NP removal can be easily achieved with acclimatized biomass, even if an inhibition kinetics is observed; furthermore, an improvement in the removal kinetics is obtained if the substrate concentration peak, reached in the reactor {{at the end of}} the filling time, is maintained to quite a low value. Both long feed phase and high biomass concentration are effective in reducing the substrate concentration peak and then improving the process efficiency. <b>Kinetic</b> <b>test</b> data are well correlated by the Haldane equation, with a saturation constant K-s and an inhibition constant K-I, of 17. 6 and 30. 7 (mg l(- 1) 4 NP), respectively, whereas the maximum removal rate was in the range of 3. 3 - 8. 4 (mg 4 NP mg VSS- 1 d(- 1)) depending on the substrate concentration peak reached in the reaction phase.

30|$|An {{important}} {{discovery was}} made by Ojeda and Iglesia. They reported that the activity of a gold catalyst supported over Al 2 O 3 was much {{higher than that of}} Pt, likely due {{to the size of the}} gold domains. In this work, they have also investigated the mechanism of reaction on the Au/Al 2 O 3 and Pt/Al 2 O 3 using kinetic isotope effect (KIE). This <b>kinetic</b> <b>test</b> consists in the use of different deuterium substituted substrates, such as HCOOD, DCOOH, and DCOOD, to distinguish between different reaction pathways. The exclusive formation of HD using both HCOOD and DCOOH indicates that the absorbed H atoms from –OH to –CH bond recombine together, and desorption is an irreversible step. KIE values (r H/r D) for HCOOD were 1.1 and 1.6 for Pt and Au, respectively, where for DCOOH, KIE values were 1.7 and 2.5, and finally, for DCOOD, KIE were 2.1 and 4.7. These values suggest the dissociation of O–H as the first step, almost thermodynamic in the case of Pt. The H adsorption is followed by the reaction between H atom and C–H bond of formates to form of H 2 and CO 2 [55].|$|E
40|$|The {{energetic}} {{parameters for}} the folding of small globular proteins {{can be very}} different if derived from guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) or urea denaturation experiments. A study of the equilibrium and kinetics of the refolding of wild-type (wt) cytochrome c 551 (cyt c 551) from Pseudomonas aeruginosa and of two site-directed mutants (E 70 Q and E 70 V) shows that the nonionic nature of urea reveals {{the role of a}} salt bridge between residues E 70 and K 10 on the transition state, which is otherwise completely masked in GdnHCl experiments. Mixed denaturant refolding experiments allow us to conclude that the masking effect of GdnHCl is complete at fairly low GdnHCl concentrations (≅ 0. 1 M). The fact that potassium chloride is unable to reproduce this quenching effect, together with the results obtained on the mutants, suggests a specific binding of the Gdn+ cation, which involves the E 70 –K 10 ion pair in wt cyt c 551. We propose, therefore, a simple <b>kinetic</b> <b>test</b> to obtain a mechanistic interpretation of nonlinear dependences of ΔGw on GdnHCl concentration on the basis of kinetic refolding experiments in the presence of both denaturants...|$|E
40|$|The {{possibility}} of treating industrial coal combustion ash by sieving, demineralization, steam and CO 2 gasification {{to improve its}} adsorption capacity has been investigated. A combination of experimental techniques allowed to follow the ash physico-chemical and morphological changes induced by the different beneficiation treatments. Cadmium adsorption equilibrium and <b>kinetic</b> <b>tests</b> were carried out {{and the results were}} interpreted in the light of existing models. The effects of the activation treatments have been discussed in order to individuate the most efficient beneficiation methods able to make this extensively-generated industrial waste re-usable in wastewater purification processes...|$|R
40|$|Nitrofurazone (NF), 5 -nitro- 2 -furaldehyde semicarbazone, a broad-spectrum antibiotic, has {{reported}} toxic effects and low solubility in water. It {{would be of}} great interest to form inclusion complexes between NF and a cyclodextrin, to develop more effective and safer antibiotic formulations. This paper focuses on the preparation of inclusion complexes of NF with 2 -hydroxypropyl-β- cyclodextrin (HP-β-CD) and their initial characterization by evaluating rates of complex formation, photostability, solubility isotherms, release rate profiles, stoichiometry of the complexes and their morphology, as revealed by scanning electron microscopy. The <b>kinetic</b> <b>tests</b> of complex formation revealed that 17, 3 h is enough for stabilization of the NF-cyclodextrin complex. The solubility isotherm studies showed that the isotherm changes from type A to type B, as a function of temperature. The photostability experiments showed that the insertion of the NF in the HP-β-CD cavity protects the drug from photodecomposition. The release <b>kinetic</b> <b>tests</b> showed that the profile of NF release from the complex is altered by the presence of HP-β-CD in the medium. A Job's plot indicated that the stoichiometry of the complex was 1 : 1 NF:HP-β-CD. The scanning electron micrographs showed changes in the crystal structure of NF in the complex. This study focused on the physicochemical properties of drug-delivery formulations that could potentially be developed into a novel type of therapy with NF...|$|R
