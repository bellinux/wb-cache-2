500|$|In 2006, Mauboy {{audition}}ed {{for the fourth}} season of Australian Idol in Alice Springs, Northern Territory singing Whitney Houston's [...] "I Have Nothing". Her audition impressed all three judges, and she progressed through to the semi-finals. Following the semi-final process, Mauboy had advanced through to the toptwelve. The media cited her previous Sony contract as grounds for dismissal, but since the contract had expired, Australian Idol producers refused to remove her from the show. Throughout the series, Mauboy continued to impress the judges with her performances. In the final eleven week, following her rendition of Kelly Clarkson's [...] "Walk Away", judge Kyle Sandilands commented on Mauboy's weight, that if she wished {{to succeed in the}} music industry, she should [...] "lose the jelly belly". Mauboy appeared stunned by the comment. In an interview with Who magazine's Alicia Neil, two years after the comment was made, Mauboy stated [...] "I <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>took</b> it as a joke...I look back on it as a positive thing – it made me a stronger person." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1981, Love {{was granted}} a small trust fund {{that had been left}} by her adoptive grandparents, which she used to travel to Dublin, Ireland, where her {{biological}} father was living. While there, she enrolled in courses at Trinity College, studying theology for two semesters. She would later receive honorary patronage from Trinity's University Philosophical Society in 2010. In the United Kingdom, she became acquainted with musician Julian Cope and his band, The Teardrop Explodes, in Liverpool and briefly lived in his house. [...] "They <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>took</b> me in", she recalled. [...] "I was sort of a mascot; I would get them coffee or tea during rehearsal." [...] In Cope's autobiography Head-On, Love is referred to as [...] "the adolescent." [...] After spending a year abroad, Love returned to Portland: [...] "I thought that [...] was my peak life experience," [...] she said in 2011. [...] "—that nothing else [...] happen to me again." [...] In 1983, she took short-lived jobs working as an erotic dancer in Japan and later Taiwan, but was deported after the club was shut down by the government.|$|E
500|$|Jennings {{offered to}} record [...] "Willy the Wandering Gypsy and Me" [...] and told Shaver to sing another song – if Jennings liked it he would record it and Shaver could sing another; {{but if he}} did not like it, Shaver would have to leave. Shaver sang [...] "Ain't No God in Mexico", {{followed}} by [...] "Honky Tonk Heroes" [...] and [...] "Old Five and Dimers and Me". [...] Jennings was so taken with Shaver's tunes that he decided he would record an album consisting solely of the Texan's songs. [...] RCA producer Chet Atkins was reluctant to record the material of an unknown writer, but since he had creative control, Jennings decided to record the album anyway, although the executives of RCA Records delayed its release. [...] Jennings was also spending more of his time at Tompall Glaser's [...] "Hillbilly Central" [...] studio at 916 Nineteenth Avenue South in Nashville, attracted by the laid back, communal atmosphere that was the antitheses of the traditional setup that Jennings had endured at RCA since 1966. [...] Jennings brought Glaser back with him to RCA Victor Studios to co-produce Honky Tonk Heroes. [...] "Tompall and I were best friends," [...] Jennings reminisced in the audio version of his autobiography Waylon. [...] "We met at about the time he broke up with his brothers, and I <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>took</b> their place in his life." [...] Jennings and Shaver worked on the songs for several weeks, with [...] Shaver believing that Jennings was not closely following the phrasing of the tunes, and in some cases he played the songs repeatedly so that Jennings would understand them. [...] The title cut was especially problematic, with Jennings and Shaver - both temperamental personalities - clashing over the arrangement. [...] In Michael Striessguth's book Outlaw: Waylon, Willie, Kris, and the Renegades of Nashville, Jennings drummer Richie Albright recalls: ...|$|E

500|$|Producers of Mad Men {{approached}} January Jones {{to portray}} Betty Draper, Don's {{wife and the}} mother of their two children. Jones avouched that portraying the character would give the audience an opportunity to see a dark side of her nature. She initially auditioned for the role of Peggy Olson, which was later given to fellow cast member Elisabeth Moss. [...] "It got down between Elisabeth Moss and myself, and it was obviously more suited to her, but Matthew had said, you know, there’s this other role, of the wife." [...] Jones signed a seven-year contract with the show, although her character originally had two lines in [...] "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes." [...] Weiner eventually edited the script to accommodate her desires. [...] "It’s such a testament to his ability," [...] Jones stated. [...] "He just took something out of thin air, which makes me think now that he had to have had an idea that the wife was {{going to be part of}} the show, because I <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>took</b> the job with the promise that Betty would be a part of the show. When you sign a seven-year contract, you want to make sure you’re in the show." [...] Christina Hendricks was brought in to play Joan Holloway, the office manager and head of Sterling Cooper's secretarial pool. While Hendricks had previously made recurring appearances on ER before being on Mad Men, her acting career had been largely inactive, and Hendricks' agent urged her not to participate in the project. [...] "They said to me, 'AMC [...] doesn't have any other big shows—why would you do this instead of taking something that's a better bet?' I said, 'Look, I've gone with the one that's the better bet in the past—let's go with the really good script this time.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Final Destination was {{conceived}} by writers Jeffrey Reddick, James Wong, and Glen Morgan from Flight 180, a spec script {{intended for use}} in The X-Files. The film premiered across the United States and Canada on March 17, 2000, grossing $10,015,822 on its opening weekend and an overall gross of $112,880,294 internationally. The film's success inspired New Line Cinema then-President of Production Toby Emmerich to approach Reddick for a sequel, to which he responded positively. Reddick asserted that he [...] "wanted to expand on the mythology and not just tell the same story over again.” Unfortunately, Wong and Morgan weren't available for production since they had already signed on their respective projects The One and Willard. Instead, New Line hired second unit director and stunt coordinator David R. Ellis as director and writing partners Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber as co-writers. [...] "Second unit is like an extension of directing, you’re doing big action sequences on film {{and it was just}} something I was going after. Once I got the offer from New Line and we got a good script, {{it was kind of a}} natural transition," [...] Ellis professed. [...] "I wanted our film to be able to stand alone but I watched Final Destination to see what they did that was so successful. I tried to use some of that while trying to keep a stand-alone feel for our movie. I <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>took</b> what worked and tried to improve on it," [...] Ellis added. [...] "We wanted to take what the first film did effectively, and add levels and layers that would come out through the characters. When we first started writing this, we were trying to think, 'How can we make Death just a total badass?' and to be perfectly honest, the first crack we ever took at this script had to be reined in!" [...] Bress uncovered. On the other hand, producers Craig Perry and Warren Zide from Zide/Perry Productions also returned and helped on financing the film.|$|E

[...] Absolutely magnificent. [...] No general or admiral in wartime could ever be more magnificent than Glynn was that night. [...] He and he alone brought all of the scared people together. [...] And you've got to remember that the flight controllers in those days were -- they were kids in their thirties. [...] They were good, but very few of them had ever run into these kinds of choices in life, and they weren't used to that. [...] All of a sudden, their confidence had been shaken.

2500|$|Foster the People {{appeared}} as the musical guest on the October 8, 2011, episode of Saturday Night Live, playing [...] "Pumped Up Kicks" [...] and [...] "Houdini". Kenny G {{appeared as}} a guest performer on the latter song. At {{the end of the}} year, the group received two Grammy Award nominations: Best Pop Duo/Group Performance for [...] "Pumped Up Kicks" [...] and Best Alternative Music Album for Torches. At the awards ceremony, the band and Maroon 5 performed with The Beach Boys, one of Foster's childhood idols, in a medley of songs to celebrate The Beach Boys' 50th anniversary. Reflecting on Foster the People's sudden rise to success, Foster said, [...] "For so many years, it was slow, playing in front of rooms full of 10 people and trying to get your friends to come... And then all of a sudden, it <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>took</b> off. It's been a fast incline, so we've had to just work really hard, keep our heads down and just stay grounded. At the same time, we've {{had a lot of fun}} during the process." [...] The group continued to tour throughout 2012. By the time the group's final US tour for Torches concluded in Los Angeles in July 2012, the group had played 295 shows in the previous 16 months.|$|E

It was grand to listen to, and made a body thrill all over, but there was considerable many tunes going on at once, {{and that was a}} drawback to the harmony, you understand; {{and then there was a}} lot of Injun tribes, and they kept up such another war-whooping that they <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>took</b> the tuck out of the music.

By and by the old gentleman said he never could seem to enjoy music somehow. The fact was, I was beginning to feel the same way; but I didn't say anything. Him and I had a considerable long silence, then, but of course it warn't noticeable in that place. After about sixteen or seventeen hours, during which I played and sung a little, now and then-- always the same tune, because I didn't know any other--I laid down my harp and begun to fan myself with my palm branch.
