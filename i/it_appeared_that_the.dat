5|$|The new Parliament met in 1904 {{and reached}} a compromise, {{choosing}} Dalgety, which, like Bombala, {{was located in}} the Monaro region. Thus, {{with the passage of}} the Seat of Government Act 1904, <b>it</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> matter had been settled. However, while the Federal Parliament supported Dalgety, the New South Wales government did not, and they proved unwilling to cede the amount of territory the Federal Government demanded.|$|E
5|$|Besides the Conservatives' {{ties to the}} CPR, Rutherford's Liberals {{enjoyed the}} incumbent's {{advantage}} of controlling the levers of patronage, and the election's result was never really in doubt. Before the election, Talbot predicted {{that the government would}} win 18 of the province's 25 seats. Immediately after the election <b>it</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Liberals had won 21; when all the votes had been counted they had won 23 seats to the Conservatives' two. Bennett himself was defeated in his Calgary riding. When the outcome was clear, the people of Strathcona feted Rutherford with a torchlight procession and bonfire.|$|E
5|$|Fischer's career-long stubbornness about {{match and}} tournament {{conditions}} was again {{seen in the}} run-up to his match with Spassky. Of the possible sites, Fischer's first choice was Belgrade, Yugoslavia, while Spassky's was Reykjav√≠k, Iceland. For a time <b>it</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> dispute would be resolved by splitting the match between the two locations, but that arrangement failed. After that issue was resolved, Fischer refused to appear in Iceland until the prize fund was increased. London financier Jim Slater donated an additional US$125,000, bringing the prize fund up to an unprecedented $250,000 ($ million today) and Fischer finally agreed to play.|$|E

5|$|On {{checking}} {{records of}} telephone calls {{made to the}} dealer, the police found that some had been made from a mobile phone registered in Ireland, and on further checking the records of that phone <b>it</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> calls were made from locations consistent with the known whereabouts of the Ford truck. One call was to a known IRA member. The phone was last used at 9:23am {{on the morning of}} the bombing, just three minutes after the bombers had parked their truck in Corporation Street. On 27 June, the phone's registered owner reported that it had been stolen 17days earlier, but the police felt they had gathered enough evidence to bring a prosecution against the six IRA men held in London.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the reasons}} for the move from Zeus to Nike-X was concern that the Zeus radars would not be able to tell the {{difference}} between the warhead and a decoy until it was too late to launch. One solution to this problem was the Sprint missile, which had the performance required to wait until decluttering was complete. Another potential solution was to look for some sort of signature of the reentry through the highest levels of the atmosphere that might differ between a warhead and decoy; specifically, <b>it</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> ablation of the heat shield might produce a clear signature pointing out the warhead.|$|E
5|$|The United Kingdom and her Allies {{had been}} at war against Napoleon's French Empire since 1803, but by early 1814 Wellington's army had fought {{its way through the}} Peninsula to France, and the eastern Allies were {{threatening}} France's eastern borders. On 31 March 1814, allied armies entered Paris, and Napoleon abdicated on 6 April. Within a month of Napoleon's abdication, he had been exiled to Elba. <b>It</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> war was over, and arrangements for the peace were discussed at the Congress of Vienna. But on 26 February 1815, Napoleon escaped from Elba and returned to France, where he raised an army.|$|E

5|$|The bow {{section was}} badly damaged, but not irreparably so, {{and the rest}} of the ship, {{including}} the boilers and engines, were not damaged at all. It was determined that if the ship could be lightened, the tide would then lift her off the bottom and she could be sailed to port. With this in mind, three days later, on 20 March, the cargo was unloaded into small coastal freighters. Initially, <b>it</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> attempt would succeed, but a week later, after various other vessels had attempted to pull Suevic off the rocks, the weather deteriorated, and waves drove her farther onto shore, from whence she could not be moved.|$|E
5|$|The next day, 20 May, {{the smell}} of rotting corpses in no man's land and the {{numerous}} wounded still located between the lines convinced the New Zealand and Australian Division staff to suggest an armistice. Soon an informal truce began under the flags of the Red Cross and Red Crescent. Turkish stretcher-bearers headed into no man's land to collect the dead and wounded. Just after 19:00 <b>it</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Turks were massing troops for an attack while gathering their wounded, so the 9th Battalion opened fire on them. The Turks responded with their artillery bombarding the Australian trenches.|$|E
5|$|Van Grunsven {{first met}} Bonfire {{when he was}} {{two and a half}} years old, having been under saddle for only a week. He was later {{purchased}} by Van Grunsven's father. At first <b>it</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> young horse would be a poor prospect, as his hot temperament led to poor gaits. However, he did well at learning advanced dressage moves such as the piaffe and passage, and so Van Grunsven continued to work with him. He improved, and by the time he was seven years old, he was competing at the Grand Prix level. His temperament continued to lead to difficult rides, and he had a tendency to spook at small items near the ring; these tendencies decreased as he grew older.|$|E

5|$|When <b>it</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{war would}} resume, {{four of the}} New England colonies (Massachusetts Bay, Connecticut, New Haven, and Plymouth) formed a {{defensive}} compact known as the United Colonies of New England. Edward Winslow was already known for his diplomatic skills, {{and he was the}} chief architect of the United Colonies. His experience in the United Provinces of the Netherlands during the Leiden years was key to organizing the confederation. John Adams later considered the United Colonies to be the prototype for the Articles of Confederation, which was the first attempt at a national government.|$|E
5|$|With Ore {{still not}} fully {{recovered}} from his injury and two inexperienced {{players on the}} Georgia side, <b>it</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> teams' passing offenses {{would have to take}} up the slack. Virginia Tech's Eddie Royal, with 452receivingyards, led both teams in receiving yardage coming into the game. Georgia's receiving corps was led by wide receiver Mohammed Massaquoi and tight end Martrez Milner. Massaquoi caught 28passes for 348yards and two touchdowns coming into the game, while Milner had 27receptions for 376yards and twotouchdowns.|$|E
5|$|Following the tie against Oklahoma, No. 16 Texas {{struggled}} against No. 14 Virginia in Austin. Not until the game's final play did the Longhorns secure their 1716 {{win over the}} favored Cavaliers. The game was the 700th victory in Texas football history and marked {{the only time in}} Texas' first 103 years of football that a game ended with Texas kicking a winning field goal. Following the victory over Virginia, Texas began a winning streak that continued through the remainder of the regular season. Heading into the final game of the regular season, <b>it</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> winner of the Texas/Texas A game would clinch the Southwest Conference championship and a bid to a Bowl Alliance game. In Texas' final Southwestern Conference game, it secured the conference championship with a 166 win that guaranteed it a spot in a Bowl Alliance game.

5|$|In 1851, the Liberals gained {{office on}} Prince Edward Island. They {{immediately}} went about putting in place measures to gradually dismantle the proprietor/tenant system, although their efforts generally had limited effect largely because Samuel Cunard, who owned one-sixth of the Island, refused to sell {{any of his}} land. In 1864, the tenants organised into the Tenant League, and vowed to resist the collection of rent by their proprietors. Efforts by law enforcement to quell this rebellion had little effect, so {{the government of the}} island requested the assistance of British troops to enforce the collection of rent. In 1865, British troops arrived in the colony and successfully enforced the collection of the unpaid rent, and the Tenant League crumbled. <b>It</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> operation of the Tenant League was a matter of principle rather than practical necessity; the rent paid by tenants to the proprietors was to the amount of one shilling per acre, and the proprietors allowed rent to go unpaid for years at a time.|$|E
5|$|On 17 July 1995, U.S. Senator William Roth, {{chairman}} of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, authorized a Senate investigation into the incident, primarily in response to complaints from {{family members of the}} shootdown victims that <b>it</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> U.S. military was not holding anyone seriously accountable for the shootdown. Also in response to complaints about the DoD's response to the incident, the U.S. House of Representatives' Armed Services Subcommittee on Military Personnel scheduled a hearing on the incident for 3 August 1995 to examine the accident investigation and the judicial actions that followed. In addition, on 24 July the DoD ordered the USAF to reexamine the disciplinary and administrative actions for the personnel involved in the shootdown and for the Joint Chiefs of Staff to review the corrective actions taken against those involved and determine whether further action was necessary. Widnall requested that the new USAF chief of staff, Ronald R. Fogleman begin his own review of accountability for the incident.|$|E
5|$|After {{the joint}} Nazi-Soviet {{invasion}} of Poland in September 1939, the Soviet Union signed a treaty with Lithuania on 10 October, handed over predominantly Polish and Jewish city of Wilno (renamed Vilna) to Lithuania, {{in exchange for}} military concessions, and subsequently annexed Lithuania in 1940 after an election. The German invasion of the Soviet Union, on 22 June 1941, came {{after a year of}} Soviet occupation which had culminated in mass deportations across the Baltics only a week before the German invasion. The Nazis were welcomed as liberators and received support from Lithuania's irregular militia against retreating Soviet forces. Many Lithuanians believed Germany would allow the re-establishment of the country's independence. In order to appease the Germans, some people expressed significant antisemitic sentiments. Nazi Germany, which had seized the Lithuanian territories {{in the first week of}} the offensive, used this situation to its advantage and indeed in the first days permitted a Lithuanian Provisional Government of the Lithuanian Activist Front to be established. For a brief period <b>it</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Germans were about to grant Lithuania significant autonomy, comparable with that given to Slovak Republic. However, after about a month, the more independently minded Lithuanian organizations were disbanded around August and September 1941, as the Germans seized more control.|$|E

5|$|In 1937, Mashbir {{returned}} to Japan after an 11-year absence {{in a second}} attempt to launch the M-Plan {{on behalf of the}} Office of Naval Intelligence and his friend, naval attach√© Zacharias. At that time, there was still hope that war between Japan and America might still be prevented. This mission aroused suspicions among ill-informed military attach√©s in Tokyo and an investigation was started into Mashbir. In a misunderstanding that would come close to damaging his career irreparably once more, Mashbir was investigated in Hawaii and, influenced by the military attach√© suspicions, a prejudicial report based upon erroneous assumptions was delivered on 24 June 1937. Colonel Mashbir was advised on 25 February 1939 that he was disenrolled from the Military Intelligence Division G2 Reserves for failure to report on the specified day for physical examination. However, <b>it</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> actual cause of the disenrollment was due to suspicions aroused by failure to communicate to uninformed individuals the nature and the extent of the work on which he was actually engaged. Mashbir's dismissal and the failure to implement an intelligence network such as that suggested in Mashbir's M-Plan {{has been described as a}} key factor in the United States' failure to have more information on Japan before the attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941.|$|E
