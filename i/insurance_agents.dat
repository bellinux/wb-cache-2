Mr. Chase read a portion of what he was writing and he was astounded when his friend told him that he had recently come upon a man who had declared that God had “walked upon the earth.” Immediately Mr. Chase expressed interest and asked to be conducted to this person. Chase was then put in touch with Ibrahim George Kheiralla, recently immigrated to the United States and the second Bahá'í in America after Anton Haddad. A small group began to study the religion with Kheiralla. Stockman indicates that 5 June 1894 was probably the day the class began.
