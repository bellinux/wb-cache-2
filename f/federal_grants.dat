5|$|In 1975, the Basin {{community}} formed {{water and}} sewer districts and, using <b>federal</b> <b>grants</b> to cover about 60percent of the costs, built a water delivery, sewage, and waste-handling system. By 1990, Interstate 15 had replaced {{the entire length of}} U.S. Route 91 in the state. The centerline of the Interstate followed the track of the former Great Northern Railway through town.|$|E
5|$|American public {{education}} is operated {{by state and}} local governments, regulated by the United States Department of Education through restrictions on <b>federal</b> <b>grants.</b> In most states, children are required to attend school {{from the age of}} six or seven (generally, kindergarten or first grade) until they turn 18 (generally bringing them through twelfth grade, the end of high school); some states allow students to leave school at 16 or 17.|$|E
5|$|Kitsap Transit instead {{partnered with}} private {{operators}} the following year, launching a Seattle–Bremerton route operated by Kitsap Ferry Company in August 2004. The new ferry service, traveling 40 minutes {{between the two}} terminals, struggled to attract riders in its early months, but grew from 200 daily passengers to 500 by the following May. Under the agreement, Kitsap Transit leased the ferry for $32,000 per month and paid for docking fees and fuel with local and <b>federal</b> <b>grants.</b>|$|E

5|$|Operating {{costs for}} Rich Passage 1 were funded by <b>federal</b> <b>grants</b> {{as part of}} the study, but expired {{at the end of the}} {{passenger}} service trial in 2012. As a result, the vessel spent several years in out-of-water storage, with the exception of infill trips for Washington State Ferries routes and periodic test runs. During one of the infill trips, the ferry ran aground near Port Hadlock in January 2013, and was later damaged by a small fire while in storage in Port Townsend.|$|E
5|$|Texas Tech's College of Agricultural Science and Natural Resources has {{received}} state and <b>federal</b> <b>grants</b> for research projects including the fiber properties of cotton, the antibacterial properties of cotton fabric, {{and the development}} of chemical-warfare protective fabrics. The college has also created two grass variants, Shadow Turf, a drought-tolerant turf grass that thrives in shade, and Tech Turf (marketed as Turffalo), a turf grass with the rich color and texture of Bermuda and the resilience of buffalo grass.|$|E
5|$|The {{turn of the}} 20th century {{brought the}} Progressive Era to Mobile. The {{economic}} structure developed with new industries, generating new jobs and attracting {{a significant increase in}} population. The population increased from around 40,000 in 1900 to 60,000 by 1920. During this time the city received $3 million in <b>federal</b> <b>grants</b> for harbor improvements to deepen the shipping channels. During and after World War I, manufacturing became increasingly vital to Mobile's economic health, with shipbuilding and steel production being two of the most important industries.|$|E

5|$|Urban renewal {{programs}} are funded {{in part by}} <b>federal</b> <b>grants.</b> The National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, which created the NRHP, requires that federal agencies give consideration to the opinions of the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation in assessing the impact their actions will have on listed properties and consider alternatives to any action that would destroy or significantly affect them. The listings of downtown Troy's districts and buildings therefore had the practical effect of preventing their demolition for urban renewal.|$|E
5|$|This section {{establishes}} the fact that, although recipients may receive various federal awards during their lifespan, the individual <b>federal</b> <b>grants</b> are awarded for a specified time period, usually one year. Federal regulations prohibit {{the use of}} funds from a grant award outside its specified time frame unless authorized by a federal agency, and auditors should verify that the recipient expends its grant during that time only. For example, a surplus from a federal award that starts on January 1, 2006 and ends on December 31, 2006 cannot be used after December 31, because its lifespan has terminated. This surplus must {{be returned to the}} federal agency unless otherwise authorized.|$|E
5|$|Macdonald also {{urged the}} federal Conservative {{government}} of R. B. Bennett to increase {{financial support to}} poorer provinces. At the time, there was no national system of unemployment insurance and the Bennett Conservatives insisted that the unemployed were mainly {{the responsibility of the}} provinces and municipalities. Although the federal government did provide relief during the Depression, Nova Scotia and the two other Maritime provinces were hampered by the federal system of matching grants for relief programs. Under that system, provinces received federal money only if they were willing to contribute a percentage of their own revenues. Thus, the poorest provinces received less federal aid than the richer ones because they couldn't afford to match the <b>federal</b> <b>grants.</b> Historian E. R. Forbes points out for example, that from January to May 1935, all three levels of government spent an average of $2.84 for each relief recipient in the Maritimes, an amount less than half the $6.18 spent in the other six provinces.|$|E

5|$|Soon {{after the}} election, Dunstan {{travelled}} to Canberra {{for the annual}} Premiers' Conference as the sole Labor premier. His Government, on a mandate to dramatically increase funding in key areas, sought to appropriate further finances from the Federal Government. This brought Dunstan into conflict with Prime Minister John Gorton, and federal funding to SA was not increased. An appeal was made to the <b>Federal</b> <b>Grants</b> Commission, and Dunstan was awarded {{more than he had}} hoped for. In addition to the money received from the Grants Commission, funds were diverted from water-storage schemes in the Adelaide Hills over the advice of engineers, and cash reserves were withdrawn from the two government-owned banks. The monies were subsequently used to finance health, education and arts schemes.|$|E
5|$|Sound Transit began {{exploring}} {{means to}} accelerate {{the construction of the}} South 200th Street station in 2010, using <b>federal</b> <b>grants</b> to align the opening with the University Link Extension in 2016 and provide additional parking capacity to supplement Tukwila International Boulevard station. In December 2010, amid a tax revenue shortfall during the ongoing economic recession, the Sound Transit Board elected to suspend all design work on the light rail project south of South 200th Street. The Sound Transit Board officially approved an accelerated schedule for the South 200th Street station in July 2011, seeking a federal Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER) grant of up to $34 million; a $10 million grant was awarded in December, allowing the opening date for the station to move from 2020 to September 2016.|$|E
5|$|The {{committee}} {{signed off}} on all of Zahorchak's proposals except for his call to remove four principals in exchange for up to $15million in <b>federal</b> <b>grants</b> that mandate leadership or staff changes {{as a condition for}} receiving the money. Zahorchak proposed transferring the principals from the Allen and Dieruff high schools, Central Elementary and Harrison-Morton Middle School to the district's nonprofit foundation, then use the federal grant money to open a special school for advanced placement and honors students. The committee did not vote or comment on the matter on October 14. Zahorchak said he still planned to pursue the plan but apologized for speaking to the media about it on October 12 before discussing it with the district and staff, a move that caused angst among the staff and some members of the public.|$|E

5|$|The {{swearing}} in of Romney as the 70th {{governor of}} Massachusetts {{took place on}} January 2, 2003. He faced a Massachusetts state legislature with large Democratic majorities in both houses, and had picked his cabinet and advisors based more on managerial abilities than partisan affiliation. He declined a governor's salary of $135,000 during his term. Upon entering office {{in the middle of}} a fiscal year, he faced an immediate $650million shortfall and a projected $3billion deficit for the next year. Unexpected revenue of $1.0–1.3billion from a previously enacted capital gains tax increase and $500million in new <b>federal</b> <b>grants</b> decreased the deficit to $1.2–1.5billion. Through a combination of spending cuts, increased fees, and removal of corporate tax loopholes, the state achieved surpluses of around $600–700million during Romney's last two full fiscal years in office, although it began running deficits again after that.|$|E
5|$|The Craig Thomas Discovery and Visitor Center {{adjacent}} to the park headquarters at Moose, Wyoming, is open year-round. Opened in 2007 to replace an old, inadequate visitor center, the facility is named for the late U.S. Senator Craig Thomas and designed by acclaimed architect, Bohlin Cywinski Jackson. It was financed {{with a combination of}} <b>federal</b> <b>grants</b> and private donations. An adjoining 154-seat auditorium was opened to the public in April 2011. To the north at Colter Bay Village on Jackson Lake, the Colter Bay Visitor Center & Indian Arts Museum is open from the beginning of May to the early October. The Colter Bay Visitor Center & Indian Arts Museum has housed the David T. Vernon Indian Arts Exhibit since 1972. The Colter Bay Visitor Center was built in 1956 and was determined in 2005 to be substandard for the proper care and display of the Indian arts collection. During the winter of 2011–2012, a $150,000 renovation project was completed at the center and a portion of the arts collection was made available for viewing when the center opened for the season in May 2012.|$|E
5|$|The Governor of Oklahoma Brad Henry {{declared}} a State of Emergency in 17counties {{and described the}} outbreak as the worst natural disaster he had seen since becoming governor. On February 15, President Obama approved Henry's request for federal assistance in Carter, Logan and Oklahoma counties. A disaster recovery center {{was set up by}} the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) on February20. Homeowners were allowed to borrow $200,000 to repair damages to their home or find a temporary or permanent shelter. They were also allowed to borrow up to $40,000 to replace lost property. Businesses were allowed to borrow up to $2million for damage repair, property loss, and economic loss. By February23, about $781,000 had been given in <b>federal</b> <b>grants.</b> On February 25, FEMA approved Governor Henry's request for public assistance in Carter, Coal and Love counties. The estimated cost to clear the 7,000 tons of debris in Lone Grove was placed at $500,000, of which $90,000 has been paid for by FEMA. The Department of Homeland Security offered to assist with the reconstruction of homes and businesses and to support those who were left homeless. President Barack Obama passed along his condolences and best wishes to the victims of the tornado.|$|E
