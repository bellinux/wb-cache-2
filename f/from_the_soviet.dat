Kania lost his post as First Secretary, and was replaced by Prime Minister (and Minister of Defence) Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, who adopted a strong-arm policy.|$|E

5|$|Dissident {{success was}} mixed. Jews wanting to emigrate <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union in the 1970s formed the most successful, and most organised, {{dissident}} movement. Their {{success can be}} attributed to the movement's support abroad, most notably from the Jewish community in the United States. In addition, as a group they were not advocating a transformation of Soviet society; the Jewish dissident movement was simply interested in leaving the Soviet Union for Israel. The Soviet Government subsequently sought to improve diplomatic ties with the First World by allowing the Jews to emigrate. The emigration flow was reduced dramatically as Soviet–American tension increased in the later half of the 1970s, though it was revived somewhat in 1979, peaking at 50,000. In the early 1980s, however, the Soviet leadership decided to block emigration completely. Despite official claims that anti-Semitism was a bourgeois ideology incompatible with socialism, the truth was that Jews who openly practiced their religion or identified as Jewish from a cultural standpoint faced widespread discrimination <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> system.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the {{formation}} of FRELIMO, the Soviet position regarding the nationalist movements in Mozambique was one of confusion.

50|$|Project Mogul was the {{forerunner of}} the Skyhook balloon program, which started in the late 1940s, {{as well as two}} other espionage {{programs}} involving overflights and photographic surveillance of <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union in <b>the</b> mid-1950s, Project Moby Dick and Project Genetrix. The spy balloon overflights raised storms of protest <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets.</b> <b>The</b> constant-altitude balloons also were used for scientific purposes such as cosmic ray experiments.|$|R

5|$|Tension between {{central and}} local {{government}} heightened in {{the final years of}} the Soviet Union's existence. On May 5, 1990, the New Armenian Army (NAA), a defense force envisioned to serve as a separate entity <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union's military, was created. A celebration was planned for May 28, the anniversary of the creation of the first Armenian republic. However, on May 27 hostilities broke out between the NAA and the MVD troops based in Yerevan, resulting in the deaths of five Armenians in a shootout at the railway station. Witnesses claimed that the MVD had used an excessive amount of force in the firefight and insisted that it had instigated the fighting. Further firefights between Armenian militiamen and the MVD in nearby Sovetashen (now Nubarashen) resulted in the deaths of twenty-seven people and an indefinite cancellation of the May28 celebration. Armenia declared its sovereignty over Soviet laws on August 23, 1990. The reason Armenia's decision to break away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union largely stemmed from Moscow's intransigence on Karabakh, mishandling of the earthquake relief effort, and the shortcomings of the Soviet economy.|$|E
5|$|The American team {{dismissed}} the report. In an open response, they proclaimed that the input <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> team was overrated in the review. In addition, they claimed the Soviet team {{was able to}} undoubtedly demonstrate the synthesis of element 105 {{at least a year}} after they did. The Russian and the German teams endorsed the report. The scientists from the former JWP rejected the criticisms from Berkeley.|$|E
5|$|The Prague Spring deepened the disillusionment of many Western leftists with Soviet views.
