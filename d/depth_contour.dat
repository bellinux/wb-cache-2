A narrow shelf, for example, or one that has a steep drop from the shoreline and subsequently produces deep water in proximity to the shoreline, tends to produce a lower surge but a higher and more powerful wave.

40|$|Abstract. Data depth is a {{statistical}} analysis method that assigns a numeric value to each point, corresponding to its centrality {{relative to a}} data set. <b>Depth</b> <b>contours,</b> nested contours that enclose regions with increasing depth, provide a powerful method to visualize, quantify and compare data sets.

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{location}} depth was introduced {{as a way}} to extend the univariate notion of ranking to a bivariate configuration of data points. It has been used successfully for robust estimation, hypothesis testing, and graphical display. The <b>depth</b> <b>contours</b> form a collection of nested polygons, and the center of the deepest contour is called the Tukey median. The only available implemented algorithms for the <b>depth</b> <b>contours</b> and the Tukey median are slow, which limits their usefulness. In this paper we describe an optimal algorithm which computes all bivariate <b>depth</b> <b>contours</b> in O(n 2) time and space, using topological sweep of the dual arrangement of lines. Once these contours are known, the location depth of any point can be computed in O(log 2 n) time with no additional preprocessing or in O(log n) time after O(n 2) preprocessing. We provide fast implementations of these algorithms to allow their use in everyday statistical practice. status: publishe...|$|R

50|$|Waves {{nearing the}} coast change wave height through {{different}} effects. Some {{of the important}} wave processes are refraction, diffraction, reflection, wave breaking, wave-current interaction, friction, wave growth due to the wind, and wave shoaling. In {{the absence of the}} other effects, wave shoaling is the change of wave height that occurs solely due to changes in mean water depth - without changes in wave propagation direction and dissipation. Pure wave shoaling occurs for long-crested waves propagating perpendicular to the parallel <b>depth</b> <b>contour</b> lines of a mildly sloping sea-bed.|$|E
50|$|Approximately {{half the}} area of the park is open Baltic Sea; more than another quarter covers parts of the lagoons in the Darss-Zingst Bodden Chain {{including}} the West Rügen Bodden. Thus it protects these shallow water areas (in the Baltic Sea, the National Park boundary is based on the ten-metre <b>depth</b> <b>contour)</b> with their rich flora and fauna. The differing salt content of the brackish water habitats of the Baltic and the bodden (shallow lagoons) contribute significantly to the local diversity of nature.

The boat follows a <b>depth</b> <b>contour</b> to keep the towboard over a specific depth. The divers can also maneuver the board to maintain a more precise depth and avoid obstacles.

40|$|Data depth is an {{approach}} to statistical analysis based on the geometry of the data. Half-space depth 1 has been studied most frequently by computational geometers. The half-space depth of a point x relative {{to a set of}} points S = {X 1, [...] ., Xn} in Rd is the minimum number of points of S lying in any closed half-space determined by a line through x [2, 11] 2. <b>Depth</b> <b>contours,</b> enclosing regions with increasing depth, help to visualize, quantify and compare data sets. Prior work investigated combinatorial properties and algorithms for computation of <b>depth</b> <b>contours</b> for static data sets. We present a dynamic algorithm for computing the twodimensional rank-based half-space <b>depth</b> <b>contours</b> of a set of n points in O(n log n) time per operation and in O(n 2) overall space, an improvement over the static version of O(n 2) time per operation. The same algorithm can compute the half-space depth of a single point relative to a data set dynamically in O(log n) time and O(n) space. The algorithm does not compute the entire set of contours explicitly but maintains the order (ranking) of points according to their half-space depth. A constant number of contours (e. g. 10 %, · · · 100 %) can be constructed in O(n) time from the sorted list of the data points, ranked by depth. Our algorithm uses generalized dynamic segment trees to update the depth of every data point and is based on key characterizations of the potential changes in the <b>depth</b> <b>contours</b> upon insertions or deletions 3.
