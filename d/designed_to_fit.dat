5|$|The {{decompression}} schedule may {{be derived}} from decompression tables, decompression software, or from dive computers, and these are commonly based upon a mathematical model of the body's uptake and release of inert gas as pressure changes. These models, such as the Bühlmann decompression algorithm, are <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> empirical data and provide a decompression schedule for a given depth and dive duration.|$|E
5|$|By mid-1944, the M3 {{had fallen}} out of favor even with {{airborne}} troops, despite their strong preference for compact and lightweight weapon systems. The Airborne Command had rejected the 57mm M1 in the summer of 1943 claiming its unfitness for airlifting and the Table of Organisation and Equipment (TO) of February 1944 still had airborne divisions keeping their 37mm guns. Nevertheless, the 82nd and the 101st, were reequipped with British-manufactured 6-pounder gun (57mm) on carriage Mk III (<b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> into the British Horsa glider) for the Normandy airdrops. This change was officially introduced in the TO of December 1944.|$|E

5|$|Mother 2 was <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> {{within an}} eight megabit limit, but was {{expanded}} {{in size and}} scope twice: first to 12 megabits and second to 24 megabits. The game was originally scheduled for release in January 1993 on a 12 megabit cartridge. It was finished around May 1994 and the Japanese release was set for August 27, 1994. With the extra few months, the team played the game and added small, personal touches. Itoi told Weekly Famitsu that Shigeru Miyamoto liked the game {{and that it was}} the first role-playing game that Miyamoto had completed. Mother 2 would release in North America about a year later.|$|E
5|$|Nectar feeders such as hummingbirds, sunbirds, lories, and lorikeets amongst {{others have}} {{specially}} adapted brushy tongues {{and in many}} cases bills <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> co-adapted flowers. Kiwis and shorebirds with long bills probe for invertebrates; shorebirds' varied bill lengths and feeding methods result in the separation of ecological niches. Loons, diving ducks, penguins and auks pursue their prey underwater, using their wings or feet for propulsion, while aerial predators such as sulids, kingfishers and terns plunge dive after their prey. Flamingos, three species of prion, and some ducks are filter feeders. Geese and dabbling ducks are primarily grazers.|$|E
5|$|Raptor is a steel {{inverted}} {{roller coaster}} designed by Bolliger & Mabillard at Cedar Point in Sandusky, Ohio, United States. When built in 1994, it broke many records and held many firsts when it opened. Instead {{of having a}} short layout <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> into a compact area like , Raptor was designed with a larger, 3,790-foot (1,160m) layout, making it the tallest, fastest and longest inverted roller coaster in the world when it opened. It features six inversions, including a cobra roll, a first for inverted roller coasters. At its opening, {{it was the largest}} investment in Cedar Point history. The ride is themed as a bird of prey.|$|E

5|$|The T30 HMC was {{originally}} conceived in 1941 as an interim design to fulfil the Armored Force's requirement for an assault gun to equip tank and armored reconnaissance units. The Ordnance Department design {{was based on}} the M3 Half-track in order that it could be brought into service quickly. A prototype vehicle was authorized in October 1941 armed with an M1A1 75mm Pack Howitzer and a mount that was <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> on a simple box structure in the back of an M3 Half-track.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{plans for}} the Centre were {{that it would have}} a concert hall, however the final design of phase 1 did not include one. Space had been left, though, for a concert hall to be built in the future when phase 1 of the Centre was opened in 2004, and construction on phase 2 was then due to begin early in 2005. However, construction of phase 2 did not actually begin until April 2007. Phase 2 was <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> into the Centre's curved slate frontage, with an upper part constructed from timber.|$|E
5|$|Development on Immortal Throne {{began in}} early June 2006, {{a few weeks}} after the {{original}} Titan Quest went gold. Preparatory work was in progress during the late development stages of Titan Quest, with staff drawing up feature lists and choosing what features to improve and what additions to make. According to producer Michael Verrette, Immortal Throne was considered an extension of Titan Quest, as many of the elements it included were features that could not be included in the original game due to time constraints. Multiple staff from Titan Quest returned, either in their original roles or different roles: Verrette became producer after being a sound designer for the original game, Arthur Bruno became lead gameplay designer, and Michael Sheidow and Scott Morton returned as art director and composer respectively. The original graphics engine was carried over from the original game with some accompanying refinements. The level design was based around the increased vertical elements in environments, giving a wider variety of gameplay spaces and vistas. A big addition to the game was the Dream Mastery character class, which was both <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> in among the existing character classes and to be a useful skill in cooperative multiplayer. The level editor, a feature present in the original game, was left mostly intact, although additional development features were added such as lockable day and night cycle and preview features for new elements. Visually, the game was themed around a descent into the Underworld: the deeper the player went on their journey, the darker the environments became. Immortal Throne would be the last original property worked on by Iron Lore Entertainment: after completing work on , an expansion to , the studio was forced to close in February 2008 due to difficulties in securing any funding for future projects.|$|E
