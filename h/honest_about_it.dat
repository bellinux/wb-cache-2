500|$|Scholar Joanne M. Braxton sees Caged Bird as [...] "the fully {{developed}} black female autobiographical form {{that began to}} emerge in the 1940s and 1950s". [...] The book presents themes that are common in autobiography by Black American women: a celebration of Black motherhood; a criticism of racism; the importance of family; and the quest for independence, personal dignity, and self-definition. Angelou introduces a unique point of view in American autobiography by revealing her life story through a narrator who is a Black female from the South, at some points a child, and other points a mother. Writer Hilton Als calls Angelou one of the [...] "pioneers of self-exposure", willing to focus honestly on the more negative aspects of her personality and choices. For example, Angelou was worried about her readers' reactions to her disclosure in her second autobiography, Gather Together in My Name, that she was a prostitute. [...] She went through with it, anyway, after her husband Paul Du Feu advised her to be <b>honest</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In contrast, Trump {{benefited from}} free media {{more than any}} other candidate. From the {{beginning}} of his campaign through February 2016, Trump received almost $2 billion in free media attention, twice the amount that Clinton received. According to data from the Tyndall Report, which tracks nightly news content, through February 2016, Trump alone accounted for {{more than a quarter of}} all 2016 election coverage on the evening newscasts of NBC, CBS and ABC, more than all the Democratic campaigns combined. Observers noted Trump's ability to garner constant mainstream media coverage [...] "almost at will". However, Trump frequently criticized the media for writing what he alleged to be false stories about him and he has called upon his supporters to be [...] "the silent majority". Trump also said the media [...] "put false meaning into the words I say", and says he does not mind being criticized by the media as long as they are <b>honest</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Webb {{also stated}} that Deschanel's {{character}}, Summer, {{is based on a}} stock character type; [...] "Yes, Summer is an immature view of a woman. She's Tom's view of a woman. He doesn't see her complexity and the consequence for him is heartbreak. In Tom's eyes, Summer is perfection, but perfection has no depth. Summer's not a girl, she's a phase." [...] Gordon-Levitt explained that he was drawn to the role of Tom because of his relatability to the character. [...] "I've had my heart broken before. Truly, truly broken. But when I look back at me in my heartbroken phase, it's pretty hilarious, because it felt so much more extreme than it really was. One of the things I love about 500 Days of Summer is that it doesn't make light of what we go through in romances, but it is <b>honest</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> and shows it for what it is, which is often profoundly funny".|$|E

50|$|The Employment Contracts Act was {{deliberately}} intended to individualise the employment relationship.

[...] "I admit that I was greatly impressed by her," [...] I went on, [...] "but just when I had begun to hope for a better understanding, her brother Lorado chilled me with the information that she was about to be claimed by another man. To be <b>honest</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> mother, I am not sure that she is interested in me even now; although one of her friends has just written me to say that Lorado was mistaken, and that Zulime is not engaged to any one.

40|$|The use {{of student}} {{feedback}} {{as a method}} of improving university teaching was studied at the University of Sokoto, Nigeria. Students rated the lecturer, the lecturer's teaching ability, and the course. Of concern was whether students c,refuliy and thoughtfully read the questionnaire items, and whether there was any evidence of spiteful or gratuitous responses. A total of 101 students rated six lecturers from the education, history, and geography departments. Results provide some evidence that students give honest and thoughtful feedback on teaching and cours content. It seemed possible that students feared being equall. <b>honest</b> <b>about</b> their lecturers. <b>It</b> is suggested that students need to be more thoroughly convinced of their anonymity.

If your recipient is using Microsoft Outlook, he'll see a message like, [...] "From youroffice@domain.com on behalf of yourgmail@gmail.com." [...] Manjoo further wrote that [...] "Google explains that it adds the tag in order to prevent your e-mail from being considered spam by your recipient; the theory is that if the e-mail is <b>honest</b> <b>about</b> its origins, <b>it</b> shouldn't arouse suspicion by spam checking software".

Before {{the evening was}} over, a price had been fixed, and Ralph had bought the little horse for £130. Why shouldn't he take another winter out of himself? He could not marry Mary Bonner and get into a farm all in a day,--nor yet all in a month. He would go to work honestly with the view of settling himself; but let him be as <b>honest</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> as he might, his winter's hunting would not interfere with him. So at last he assured himself. And then he had another argument strong in his favour. He might hunt all the winter and yet have this thirty thousand pounds,--nay, more than thirty thousand pounds {{at the end of}} it. In fact, imprudent and foolish as had been his hunting in all previous winters, there would not even be any imprudence in this winter's hunting. Fortified by all these unanswerable arguments he did buy Mr. Fred Pepper's little horse.|$|E

Bruce Meredith cried all night, Mrs. Meredith says, when he heard Jem and Jerry were going. And he wanted to know if the 'K of K.' his father talked about was the King of Kings.

40|$|This thesis {{has been}} carried out during the {{exchange}} programme I have attended in Lund. Before starting the thesis I took English lessons in order to achieve a good written and oral level in this language. The thesis is about scenario planning which was an unknown method for me. After reading the three books about scenario planning (Scenario planning: the link between future and strategy; Shell. Scenarios: An explorer’s guide and The art of long view: planning for the future in an uncertain world) I have learnt a new way which permits companies to adapt different future scenarios. Making this project I have learnt many interesting things. However, the methodology which had to be carried out was a bit difficult to face at the beginning since it was maybe a little theoretical compared to what I have done in my home University. I would like to take this opportunity to thank my friends and family who gave me the opportunity to come to Sweden to improve my education and know the different cultures present in Sweden. Particularly I would like to thank my cousin Marina and my best friend Paola who have read the thesis in order to give me an <b>honest</b> opinion <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> Finally, I want to thank Karolin Grönvall my thesis supervisor Daniel Hellström who have always had time for me and have helped me to understand how the thesis had to be developed...|$|R
