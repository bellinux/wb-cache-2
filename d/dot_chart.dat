DESCRIPTION A spike is a vertical line from the plot point to the spike base (most typically the x axis). DATAPLOT can draw a trace as a character or plot symbol at each point, as a connected line, as a spike from the point to a base, as a bar from the plot point to a base, or as any combination of the above. The choice {{is determined by the}} BAR, SPIKE, CHARACTER, and LINE commands. The switches for these commands work independently of each other. Spikes are commonly used in time series plots. They are also useful in showing deviation from a common value such as the mean or median. They are also used to generate <b>dot</b> <b>charts.</b> <b>Dot</b> <b>charts</b> are an alternative to bar charts recommended by Bill Cleveland in the books listed in the REFERENCE section below...|$|R

This ability allows us to suggest improved figures to our authors in a format that is almost camera-ready. Sample data are given in the table. Vertical column charts (Figure 1) and horizontal bar charts (Figure 2) of these data use the length of thick columns or bars to represents the value of the data. Such charts are useful when projected from overhead transparencies or slides because the color and thickness of the bars make data visible to large numbers of people. However, they are neither necessary nor desirable for individual readers of the scientific literature.

40|$|Project Management is {{the primary}} key to {{successful}} software development. In 1995 Caper Jones stated that the failure or cancellation rate of large software systems was over 20 % in his article on patterns of large software systems. More than {{two thirds of the}} projects fail due to improper management of skills, activities, and personnel. One main reason is that software is not a tangible entity and is hard to visualize and hence to monitor. A manager has to be skilled in different CASE tools and technologies to track and manage a software development process successfully. The volume of results produced by these CASE tools is so huge that a high level manager cannot look into all the details. He has to get a high level picture of the project, to know where the project is heading, and if needed, then look into the finer level details by drilling down to locate and correct problems. The objective of this thesis is to build an Advanced Charting System (ACS), which would act as a companion to PAMPA 2 (Project Attribute Monitoring and Prediction Associate) and help a manager visualize the state of a software project over a standard World Wide Web browser. The PAMPA 2 ACS will be responsible for visualizing and tracking of resources, tasks, schedules and milestones of a software project described in the plan. PAMPA 2 ACS will have the ability to depict the status of the project through a variety of graphs and charts. PAMPA 2 ACS implements a novel charting technique called as <b>DOT</b> <b>Chart</b> to track the processes and activities of a software project. PAMPA 2 ACS provides a multilevel view of the project status. PAMPA 2 ACS will be able to track any arbitrary plan starting from a collapsed / concise view of a whole project. This can be further drilled down to the lowest level of detail. The status can be viewed at the project version level, plan and workbreakdown levels, process, sub process, and activity level.

40|$|Process mining {{has emerged}} as a way to analyze {{processes}} based on the event logs of the systems that support them. Today's information systems (e. g., ERP systems) log all kinds of events. Moreover, also embedded systems (e. g., medical equipment, copiers, and other high-tech systems) start producing detailed event logs. The presence of event logs is an important enabler for process mining. The primary goal of process mining is to extract knowledge from these logs and use it for a detailed analysis of reality. One of the challenging issues in process mining is process performance analysis. As a method to analyze process performance and to provide new insights, this paper proposes the <b>dotted</b> <b>chart</b> that shows overall process events at a glance. The chart shows process events in a graphical way such that the analyst gets a 2 ̆ 2 helicopter view 2 ̆ 2 of the process and is able to immediately spot opportunities for process improvement.

A number of 72 students of Primary Teacher Training have answered the test, before and after they have passed a process of Descriptive Statistics learning session, for approximately 12 hours.

Each visualisation summarises the frequencies {{of all of the}} paths through all of the trees in a random forest. Visualisations of the roles of covariates in random forests include: ranked bar or <b>dot</b> <b>charts</b> depicting scalar metrics of the contributions of individual covariates to the predictive accuracy of the random forest; line graphs depicting various summaries of the effect of varying a particular covariate on the predictions from the random forest; heatmaps of metrics of the strengths of interactions between all pairs of covariates; and parallel coordinates plots for each response class depicting the distributions of the values of all covariates among the observations most representative of those predicted to belong that class. Together these visualisations facilitate substantial insights into the roles of covariates in a random forest but do not communicate the frequencies of the hierarchies of covariates effects across the random forest or the orders in which covariates occur in these hierarchies.

30|$|The mean {{differences}} in water physico-chemical parameters per habitat types were compared using One-way ANOVA, while {{the relationship between}} predators and mosquito larval abundance and the water physico-chemical parameters was determined using the generalized linear model with negative binomial in MASS package, and log as defunct link function. In the initial steps of the analysis, all the variables were first explored for their distribution and the homogeneity of variance checked using histograms and <b>dot</b> <b>charts</b> after which the most appropriate link function was chosen. The initial model was built around {{the premise that the}} distribution of the response variable was Poisson, whose over-dispersion was evaluated, and when the conditional variance exceeded the conditional mean, a generalized linear model with negative binomial was employed. It is considered as a generalization of Poisson regression since it has the same mean structure as Poisson regression and has an extra parameter to model the over-dispersion. A full model included all relevant covariates, which was then simplified until the best model with smallest Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) obtained following the stepwise removal of the covariates. The final model was built as follows; formula=(Predators’ abundance)[*]~[*]Total mosquito larvae[*]+[*]Dissolved oxygen[*]+[*]Temperature[*]+[*]Turbidity[*]+[*]pH, (family=GLM.nb). The mean range of water physico-chemical parameters requirements by both mosquito larvae and their predators in the same habitats were evaluated using Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA), as described by Knapp (1978), Härdle and Simar (2007) and Skourkeas et al.

However, it is currently unknown whether acuity thresholds obtained with this newly developed psychophysical procedure are in accordance with established measures of tactile acuity that involve passive contact with fixed duration and control of contact force. Here we directly compared tactile acuity thresholds obtained with the acuity charts to traditional two-point and grating orientation thresholds {{in a group of}} young healthy adults.

Measurements with the two types of charts were equivalent, but generally more reliable with the <b>dot</b> pattern <b>chart.</b> A comparison with the two-point and grating orientation task data showed that the test-retest reliability of the acuity chart measurements after one week was superior to that of the passive methods. Individual thresholds obtained with the acuity charts agreed reasonably with the grating orientation threshold, but less so with the two-point threshold that yielded relatively distinct acuity estimates compared to the other methods. This potentially considerable amount of mismatch between different measures of tactile acuity suggests that tactile spatial resolution is a complex entity that should ideally be measured with different methods in parallel.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{technique}} for converting a basic D 3 chart into a reusable style template. Then, {{given a new}} data source we can apply the style template to generate a chart that depicts the new data, but {{in the style of}} the template. To construct the style template we first deconstruct the input D 3 chart to recover its underlying structure: the data, the marks and the mappings that describe how the marks encode the data. We then rank the perceptual effectiveness of the deconstructed mappings. To apply the resulting style template to a new data source we first obtain importance ranks for each new data field. We then adjust the template mappings to depict the source data by matching the most important data fields to the most perceptually effective mappings. We show how the style templates can be applied to source data in the form of either a data table or another D 3 chart. While our implementation focuses on generating templates for basic chart types (e. g. variants of bar <b>charts,</b> line <b>charts,</b> <b>dot</b> plots, scatterplots, etc.), these are the most commonly used chart types today.
