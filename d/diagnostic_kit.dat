It is important to prepare the <b>diagnostic</b> <b>kits</b> for detection of liver cancer early, simply and inexpensively in this country. Detection of the marker in human sera would signifi cantly help successful therapy, since the tumor could be tackled at an early stage in its development, often before metastases and other consequences.

50|$|Although Canadian {{jurisprudence}} {{has held}} that methods of medical treatment are unpatentable, many such claims {{can often be}} redrafted as “use” or “composition” claims, which have been found acceptable. For example, in Canada, an inventor may get a patent on a product (i.e. a pharmaceutical), a patent on the method of use of the pharmaceutical (i.e. a patient taking the pill), and a patent on the <b>diagnostic</b> <b>kit</b> {{for use of the}} product. In particular, an invention directed towards the treatment of disease is patentable, since there is no removal of the need for professional skill and judgment, and the invention deals with an economic area related to trade, commerce or industry.|$|E
50|$|Being an Agriculture and Technology university, {{the main}} focus of {{research}} is on agriculture and engineering. Research is coordinated by a Directorate of Experiment Station and carried out through ~70 subject-matter departments spread across colleges, 14 specialised research centres located in the campus, 7 dedicated off-campus research stations and 10 off-campus horticultural research-cum-extension centres. So far, the university has released 211 varieties, many of which played important role in Green Revolution. The work of the university in introducing soybean as a crop in India is well known. As Uttarakhand has been declared an 'Organic state', the present thrust of research is on Organic farming and Biological pest control. The university has developed a pregnancy <b>diagnostic</b> <b>kit</b> for cattle and its Salmonellosis vaccine for poultry is in advanced trials. In 1991, engineers of the university developed a 'Zero-till Ferti seed drill' for No-till farming along with National Agro Industries Ludhiana Punjab, which has been immensely popular in Haryana, Punjab and other areas of Indo-gangetic plains. CIMMYT/CGIAR has described zero tillage technology based on the Pantnagar seed drill as the most widely adopted resource conserving technology in the Indo-Gangetic Plains, till date.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: A fluorogenic peptide probe-immobilized <b>diagnostic</b> <b>kit</b> {{was used}} to analyze MMP {{activity}} in the synovial fluids (SFs) from patients with osteoarthritis (OA) and acute inflammatory conditions of the knee joint. Methods: The MMP <b>diagnostic</b> <b>kit</b> containing a polymer-conjugated MMP probe immobilized on a 96 -well plate was utilized for high-throughput screening of MMP activity in SFs from OA patients (n = 33) and patients with acute inflammatory conditions of the knee joint (n = 5). Results: Compared to SF from OA patients, SF from patients with acute inflammatory conditions of the knee joint presented stronger NIR fluorescent signals. In gelatin zymography, most samples from patients with acute inflammatory conditions of the knee joint also displayed 92 kDa (pro-form) MMP- 9 and faint 84 kDa (active form) MMP- 9, while SF from OA patients did not display detectable MMP- 9 activity. Conclusion: The presence of a strong fluorescence signal from the MMP <b>diagnostic</b> <b>kit</b> corresponded well with patients with acute inflammatory conditions of the knee joint. The results suggest that our MMP <b>diagnostic</b> <b>kit</b> {{can be useful in}} differentiation between early stages of OA and acute inflammatory conditions of the knee joint. </p...|$|E
