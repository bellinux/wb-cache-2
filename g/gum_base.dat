25|$|First, <b>gum</b> <b>base</b> is {{previously}} prepared {{through a}} melting and straining or filtering process. The formulation for <b>gum</b> <b>base</b> is proprietary information known to few individuals within each gum-producing company. Next, other ingredients such as nutritive and non-nutritive sweeteners and flavors {{are added to}} the <b>gum</b> <b>base</b> until the warm mixture thickens like dough. The <b>gum</b> <b>base</b> mixture is heated during this mixing process in order to increase the entropy of the polymers to achieve a more uniform dispersion of ingredients. Then, extrusion technology is implemented to smooth, form, and shape the gum. Next, the gum goes through a shaping process that is determined by gum type and consumer demand. For example, cut and wrap (chunk or cube) pieces are severed straight out of the extruder using a vertical cutter. Sheeting is a technique often used for stick, slab and tab gums. Next, gum is either conditioned by being sprinkled with a powdered polyol or coated via the application of subsequent layers of coating using temperature controlled coating basins before it is sent to packaging.|$|E
25|$|The {{polymers}} {{that make}} up the main component of chewing <b>gum</b> <b>base</b> are hydrophobic. This property is essential because it allows for retention of physical properties throughout the mastication process. Because the polymers of gum repel water, the water-based saliva system in a consumer’s mouth will dissolve the sugars and flavorings in chewing gum, but not the <b>gum</b> <b>base</b> itself. This allows for gum to be chewed {{for a long period of}} time without breaking down in the mouth like conventional foods. Chewing gum can be classified as a product containing a liquid phase and a crystalline phase, providing gum with its characteristic balance of plastic and elastic properties.|$|E

25|$|<b>Gum</b> <b>bases</b> {{with higher}} {{molecular}} weights are typically used in gums intended to meet bubble-forming expectations.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Controlled release co-matrix tablets of Ciprofloxacin HCl were {{prepared}} with {{different types of}} bioadhesive polymers e. g. Methocel K 4 M, Methocel K 15 M CR and Methocel K 100 LV, Povidone K- 30, and Xanthan gum. Tablets prepared by direct compression method were subjected to in-vitro drug dissolution study for 8 hours in a simulated gastric fluid media using USP dissolution apparatus II with 50 rpm at 37 ± 0. 5 ºC. The bio-adhesive property was investigated in terms of retention time following in-vitro wash-off method. The concentrations of polymers were varied to investigate whether these variations can cause any change in release of Ciprofloxacin HCl molecule and bio-adhesion property or not. In {{most of the cases}} it is found that Methocel K 4 M and Methocel K 100 LV based co-matrix tablets release greater percentage of active drug than Methocel K 15 M CR based co-matrix tablets. Bio-adhesive strength of Methocel K 15 M CR and Xanthan <b>gum</b> <b>based</b> co-matrix tablets was proved to be maximum followed by Methocel K 4 M and Xanthan <b>gum</b> <b>based</b> co-matrices. Whereas Methocel K 100 LV and Xanthan <b>gum</b> <b>based</b> co-matrices showed little or poor muco-adhesion. Methocel K 4 M, K 15 M CR and Xanthan <b>gum</b> <b>based</b> formulations showed nearly zero-order release, on the other hand Methocel K 100 LV and Xanthan <b>gum</b> <b>based</b> formulation showed a burst release within one hour of dissolution. Finally it was revealed that Xanthan gum provided optimum bio-adhesion functioning as a synergist in co-matrices and comply the USP specification as a most suitable controlled release polymer...|$|R
25|$|While {{hydrophobic}} polymers beneficially repel {{water and}} contribute to chewiness, they also detrimentally attract oil. The stickiness of gum results from this hydrophobic nature, as gum can form bonds and stick when it makes contact with oily surfaces such as sidewalks, skin, hair, or the sole of one’s shoe. To make matters worse, unsticking the gum is a challenge because the long polymers of the <b>gum</b> <b>base</b> stretch, rather than break. The sticky characteristic of gum may be problematic during processing if the gum sticks to any machinery or packaging materials during processing, impeding the flow of product. Aside from ensuring that the machinery is free from lipid-based residues, this issue can be combatted by the conditioning and coating of gum {{toward the end of}} the process. By adding either a powder or a coating to the exterior of the gum product, the hydrophobic <b>gum</b> <b>base</b> binds to the added substance instead of various surfaces with which it may come in contact.|$|E
25|$|Chewing gum is a soft, {{cohesive}} substance {{designed to}} be chewed without being swallowed. Modern chewing gum is composed of <b>gum</b> <b>base,</b> sweeteners, softeners/ plasticizers, flavors, colors, and, typically, a hard or powdered polyol coating. Its texture is reminiscent of rubber because of the physical-chemical properties of its polymer, plasticizer, and resin components, which contribute to its elastic-plastic, sticky, chewy characteristics.|$|E
25|$|Flavor {{delivery}} is extended throughout the mastication process by timed release of different flavor components {{due to the}} physical-chemical properties of many of chewing gum’s ingredients. Entropy is {{a key player in}} the process of flavor delivery; because some gum components are more soluble in saliva than <b>gum</b> <b>base</b> and because over time flavor components desire to increase their entropy by becoming dispersed in the less ordered system of the mouth than in the more ordered system of the gum bolus, flavor delivery occurs. During the first three to four minutes of the chew, bulking agents such as sugar or sorbitol and maltitol have the highest solubility and, therefore, are chewed out first. As these components dissolve in the consumers’ saliva and slide down the esophagus, they are no longer retained in the <b>gum</b> <b>base</b> or perceived by the chewer. During the next phase of the chew in the four to six minute range, intense sweeteners and some acids are dissolved and chewed out. These components last slightly longer than the bulking agents because they have a slightly lower solubility. Next, encapsulated flavors are released during either 10-15 minute into the chew or after 30–45 minutes. Encapsulated flavors remain incorporated in the <b>gum</b> <b>base</b> longer because the molecules that they are encapsulated in are more easily held within the gum matrix. Finally, during the last phase of the chew, softeners such as corn syrup and glycerin and other textural modifiers are dissolved, resulting in a firming up of the gum {{and the end of the}} chew.|$|E

25|$|Bubblegum bubbles {{are formed}} when {{the tension and}} {{elasticity}} of gum polymers acts against the constant and equally dispersed pressure of air being directed into the gum bolus. Bubble gum bubbles are circular because pressure from the focused air being directed into the bolus acts equally {{on all of the}} interior surfaces of the gum cud, uniformly pushing outward on all surfaces as the polymers extend. As the bubble expands, the polymers of the <b>gum</b> <b>base</b> stretch and the surface of the bubble begins to thin. When the force of the air being blown into the bubble exceeds the force that the polymers can withstand, the polymers overextend and the bubble pops. Due to the elastic attributes of chewing gum, the deflated bubble recoils and the wad of gum is ready to continue being chewed.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{the present}} research, an attempt {{has been made}} to {{formulate}} sustained release matrix tablet of nicorandil, a novel potassium channel opener used in cardiovascular disease. The tablets were prepared by wet granulation method and studied the effect of matrix former xanthan gum and guar gum separately. Tablets were evaluated for uniformity of weight, drug content, friability, hardness, thickness, in vitro dissolution and swelling study. All the formulation showed compliance with pharmacopoeial standard. As the time increases, the swelling index was increased; later on it decreases gradually due to dissolution of outermost –gelled layer of tablet into dissolution medium. Comparison between xanthan gum and guar gum, it has been observed that swelling index of guar gum was significantly more compared to xanthan gum. The dissolution result shows that an increased amount of polymer resulted in retarded drug release. The maximum drug release was found to be 90 % over a period of 12 hours in guar <b>gum</b> <b>based</b> tablets (F 4). Similarly maximum drug release was found to be 96 % over a period of 12 hours in Xanthan <b>gum</b> <b>based</b> tablets (F 1). This indicates that the minimum quantity of guar gum and Xanthan gum that is drug to gum ratio of 1 : 1 is required to prepare the sustain release matrix tablets of nicorandil...|$|R

The microspheres were prepared by orifice ionic gelation method and they were characterized by scanning electron microscopy and particle size analysis. Among six formulations, microspheres of four formulations (F 1 -F 4) were discrete, spherical and free flowing. There was an inverse relationship found between the amount of gum and surface smoothness in case of guar gum-containing microspheres while a forward relationship was found between amount of gum and surface smoothness in case of the microspheres containing xanthan gum. The size of the particles increased with increasing amounts of gum.
