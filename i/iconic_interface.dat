40|$|International audienceThe {{purpose of}} this work {{is to develop a}} health {{platform}} for the all Rhone-Alpes region. We also propose a new approach for an <b>iconic</b> <b>interface</b> for all users. New techniques have been used to develop this platform which will be, in some years used by a great number of Rhone-Alps doctors. We choose a user-center design which takes into account the requirements of doctors (hospital and GP). We took into account all specific features of the health information system used in the region. The platform now permits fast and more appropriate medical decisions than those made without this information system.

40|$|International audienceBackground: Clinical {{practice}} {{guidelines are}} useful for physicians, and guidelines {{are available on the}} Internet from various websites such as Vidal Recos. However, these guidelines are long and difficult to read, especially during consultation. Similar difficulties have been encountered with drug summaries of product characteristics. In a previous work, we have proposed an iconic language (called VCM, for Visualization of Concepts in Medicine) for representing patient conditions, treatments and laboratory tests, and we have used these icons to design a user interface that graphically indexes summaries of product characteristics. In the current study, our objective was to design and evaluate an iconic user interface for the consultation of clinical practice guidelines by physicians. Methods: Focus groups of physicians were set up to identify the difficulties encountered when reading guidelines. Icons were integrated into Vidal Recos, taking human factors into account. The resulting interface includes a graphical summary and an iconic indexation of the guideline. The new interface was evaluated. We compared the response times and the number of errors recorded when physicians answered questions about two clinical scenarios using the interactive <b>iconic</b> <b>interface</b> or a textual interface. Users' perceived usability was evaluated with the System Usability Scale. Results: The main difficulties encountered by physicians when reading guidelines were obtaining an overview and finding recommendations for patients corresponding to "particular cases". We designed a graphical interface for guideline consultation, using icons to identify particular cases and providing a graphical summary of the icons organized by anatomy and etiology. The evaluation showed that physicians gave clinical responses more rapidly with the <b>iconic</b> <b>interface</b> than the textual interface (25. 2 seconds versus 45. 6, p < 0. 05). The physicians appreciated the new interface, and the System Usability Scale score value was 75 (between good and excellent). Conclusion: An interactive <b>iconic</b> <b>interface</b> can provide physicians with an overview of clinical practice guidelines, and can decrease the time required to access the content of such guidelines...|$|E

40|$|Image {{browsing}} {{is involved}} in {{many different types of}} tasks, such as interacting with a desktop and file system, viewing digital photo albums, etc. Different techniques are available for different types of tasks, but results from image browsing tests have been varied. The work of this thesis includes a literature survey, describing the most common image browser features and mechanisms, and summarizing research on the topic. The survey is followed by two image browsing studies, comparing an <b>iconic</b> <b>interface</b> to a zoom-and-pan and a fisheye interface. One study was made on a regular 19 " display, and the other one on a 50 " display with a 3 D mouse. Both studies showed that none of the zoom-and-pan and the fisheye interfaces were more efficient than the simple <b>iconic</b> <b>interface.</b> The <b>iconic</b> <b>interface</b> was also the one most preferred by users. The problem with conflicting research results in this field is addressed in a summary of layout and presentation factors. There are a number of things, besides just interaction style, that affects usability. A lot remains to be investigated, and the analysis presented in this thesis gives an idea of some things to consider for future research. The two final studies of this thesis were parts of an interface design proposal for an oil analysis interface. One experiment showed that for reading single graphs, multiple diagrams with only one line graph in each are more efficient than one single chart with several line graphs. The final study of this thesis is a comparison of two graph tables, one distortion-oriented, and one overview+detail version. A theoretical analysis showed that for certain task types the static overview+detail interface would be more efficient than the distortion-oriented one, which was confirmed by the statistical analysis of data from the experiment. Users preferred the static overview+detail interface, mainly because they did not like that the view changed. The common experience of this work is that simplicity is highly valuable in many aspects. A simple interaction technique, such as an <b>iconic</b> <b>interface,</b> is often more efficient and more appreciated by users, than more advanced techniques. Reading single line graphs is more efficiently done in single small diagrams than in one large common diagram. Simple static modes are by many users preferred to dynamic modes. And finally, simple usability tests with a minimized number of confounding variables could explain and reduce the problem with conflicting results. Hence, the main conclusion and message of this thesis goes for both interface design and testing: Keep it simple.

40|$|Abstract. To work productively in an {{interactive}} workspace, users need effective interfaces for seamlessly sharing, annotating, and juxtaposing digital information across heterogeneous devices. In this paper, we present an interface toolset for constructing and using <b>iconic</b> <b>interfaces</b> for interactive workspaces. Using an iconic {{representation of the}} physical workspace, users can quickly and easily relocate applications and redirect input across devices. The toolset provides a graphical tool for rapidly constructing iconic representations for various workspaces, supports an existing interactive workspace infrastructure, and is engineered to be portable to others. A usability evaluation showed that the interaction design of the interfaces created with our toolset is effective for redirection and relocation tasks. Our results provide the first empirical baseline for comparing alternative interfaces for interactive workspaces. The use of our toolset facilitates more productive use of interactive workspaces for both individual and group work and is available for download today. ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} Community Knowledge Sharing (CKS), an Internet-enabled asynchronous {{messaging system}} {{designed for use}} in the developing world. The system is motivated by a desire to expand the benefits of network connectivity deeply into rural areas, breaking down barriers within and between communities. Recognizing that large segments of the population in rural communities have low levels of literacy, CKS implements a multi-literate design in which the system can be customized based on the abilities and preferences of the user. Three research areas are explored. The primary research area is to understand whether multi-literate interfaces can expand access to technology. Second, the study explores concerns that users of the system hire around security and trust. Third, the study identifies the types of information used and demanded by a sample user group. An evaluation of CKS has been conducted in Bohechio, an agricultural town in the Dominican Republic. Participants were drawn to cover a range of ages, educational backgrounds and literacy skill levels. With regards to multi-literacy and access, it is found that low literate users prefer <b>iconic</b> <b>interfaces,</b> speech synthesis is not effective, and literate users are willing to create text and audio content. On security and trust, the study finds that in the context of networked message systems rural people have different security requirements, and need to trust both the communications channel and content. Lastly, in discussions on information it is found that health, news, commercial and family information is in the greatest use and greatest demand in the community. CKS is a modest first step at developing an appropriate messaging environment for the developing world. Policy recommendations are drawn to inform future technology design and evaluation efforts. Developers of information technologies {{for use in the}} developing world should design <b>iconic</b> <b>interfaces</b> for low literate users, not rely on speech synthesis technologies, collaborate with communities, and balance cost, security and accessibility in their technology design.

At the same time, {{the ability to}} interconnect computers has provided a technological base for increased computer support of business teams. A flexible system should accommodate {{a wide variety of}} group and task characteristics in both face-to-face and geographically-dispersed environments. An architecture for a system named TEAMWORK is developed that provides flexible support for business teams. System functions are organized into six configurable components, audio processing, video processing, text processing, graphic processing, data management, and numeric processing, collectively addressing a wide spectrum of group tasks. TeamWriter is highly configurable text processing tool implemented to represent and partially evaluate one aspect of TEAMWORK's architecture. Pulldown menus and picture buttons allow access functions. Support {{for a wide variety of}} team access protocols, real- and non-real-time work styles, multi-user document writing, brainstorming, idea consolidation, visual group dynamics, and more is included. Document changes appended to a centrally located server file maintain a linear revision history. Evaluation session indicated participants especially liked TeamWriter's multiuser document writing capabilities, picture buttons, authorship provisions, and multiple configurations. Suggestions for enhancing brainstorming and idea consolidation capabilities are supported by the underlying set of configurable functions and involve adding new interface configurations. Sessions also demonstrated that field testing will be needed to thoroughly evaluate TeamWriter; participants were unable to explore all of TeamWriter's features in the one and a half hour long evaluation sessions.

40|$|One {{method of}} {{evaluating}} programs {{is for them}} to be prepared as self contained pieces of sourc, then compiled, linked and executed. The last phase may involve binding to and manipulating persistent values. When the persistent store is supported by a user interface, the program construction can be augmented by the use of tokens as denotations for persistent values. That is, the manipulation of the persistent store by gesture, for example by an <b>iconic</b> <b>interface</b> linked to a mouse, can be used to provide tokens for persistent values.

40|$|One of {{the many}} {{challenges}} with interface design concerns how to present and retrieve information on a display. The smaller the display is, the bigger the challenge. A typical task that {{requires a lot of}} screen space is image browsing. Several studies have been conducted in the past, but with conflicting results. This thesis includes a literature survey on browsing techniques, two user studies comparing image-browsing techniques on an electronic bulletin board, an analysis of visual factors affecting the usability of image browsing, and a user study on mobile phone interfaces. The image-browser comparisons involved three types of browsers (iconic, bifocal, and zoom-and-pan). The first experiment was conducted on a regular 19 " desktop display. For the second user study, the browsers were modified and run on a 50 " plasma display with a 3 D input device. Results from both studies showed that an <b>iconic</b> <b>interface</b> was most efficient. Observations made during the user experiments resulted in an analysis of layout and presentation factors that have an impact on usability of image-browsers, in particular task completion time. The main purpose was to identify unwanted confounding factors in image-browser tests, but the analysis could also be used for setting up future experiments and explaining results from such tests. The mobile phone study is a comparison of interfaces of two different mobile brands.

40|$|After {{its first}} {{appearance}} in the user-interface of the Xerox 'STAR' office workstation, icons have been gaining popularity. Many studies have been performed {{in relation to the}} design of appropriate icons. However, most of these research concentrated on 'how' to represent the icons to make them look good. Very few studies investigated 'what' should be included in an icon to make it work better. This study was aimed to investigate 'what' should be represented in an icon to make it effective. Three factors affecting icon effectiveness were hypothesized: dominance, uniqueness, and ambiguity. Dominance is a factor intrinsic to a function. An element (verb or object) of a function is said to be dominant if the other element can be inferred from the first one. Uniqueness is related to the quality of design. If an icon has perceptual immediacy, then it can be said to be unique. If multiple meanings are possible in a single context by one user, the icon can be said to be ambiguous. Two experiments were conducted to investigate how the three hypothesized factors affect user performance in terms of time and accuracy. The results of the experiments showed that dominance and uniqueness are two main factors affecting user's response time in an <b>iconic</b> <b>interface,</b> whereas ambiguity is the main source of accuracy problems. A performance model showing the relationships among these factors and user performance were suggested based on the findings of the study.

40|$|This conference {{paper is}} closed access. Computer-Aided Design (CAD) systems are {{currently}} {{widely used in}} design and manufacturing industries. However, the integration of CAD systems with Computer- Aided Manufacturing (CAM) systems such as process planning, graphical numerical control (NC part programming), assembly and inspection planning requires a featurebased representation of components which is not found in conventional geometry-based CAD systems. To meet this requirement, feature-based CAD systems have been developed in research centres worldwide using feature-oriented user interfaces and feature-based representations of parts. The introduction of new technology (feature-based design in this instance) always raises important questions. For example, are feature-based systems easier to learn and more efficient than conventional geometric modellers?; and does the method generate more complete and accurate models? This paper reports an experiment which was carried out to compare a prototype feature-based design system with a conventional solid modeller, where both systems use an <b>iconic</b> <b>interface.</b> Eight engineering students were selected as subjects and each subject was required to generate six features using both systems. The time taken to generate each feature was recorded {{and the results were}} presented as a series of graphs and learning curves. The results of the experiment show that both systems are similar in terms of learning their operation and that the feature's approach has clear efficiency gains over the conventional geometric approach. The conclusions drawn from this experiment may be useful for both end users who are considering upgrading their existing systems and software vendors who are designing next generation of products...|$|E
40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. The Loughborough University of Technology Feature-Based Design System (LUTFBDS) allows detail design {{to be carried}} out in a {{computer}} aided design (CAD) environment by the addition of form features to stock material or part-machined components. An <b>iconic</b> user <b>interface</b> assists in the description parts in terms of a set of primitive features such as holes, pockets and slots or higher level compound features such as patterns of holes and counterbored holes. This feature representation is generated in parallel with the geometric data structure of the underlying boundary representation solid modeller. The feature representation is useful for a range of downstream manufacturing activities, but our research focusses on the integration of CAD with process planning. LUT-FBDS functions allows the designer or manufacturing engineer to progressively construct the final geometry of a part, and facilities are provided for the designer to modify parameters which relate to feature dimensions, location, orientation and relationships with other features. These changes may result in changes to the feature representation and hence {{there is a need for}} feature validation to ensure the integrity of the model...|$|R
40|$|A {{complete}} {{computational model}} for industrial robot programming is presented. There {{are two main}} objectives in realizing this model. The first is to allow shop floor production engineers (application programmers) to create and modify sensor-based robot programs. The proposed <b>iconic</b> user <b>interface</b> provides a non-textual programming mechanism. The icons, which represent individual robot skills, are linked and parameterized to modify the behaviour of the skills. Use of a control flow mechanism, as opposed to data flow, makes {{the description of the}} robot operation as a set of skills immediately obvious. Linking the skill icons requires only a few control constructs which makes the interface usable on the shop floor. This system provides a mechanism for online creation and debugging of sensor-based robot operations. The second objective is to enable the system programmer to create and maintain the robot skills using consistent and facilitated methods. This is the underlying software architecture that makes the <b>iconic</b> shop floor <b>interface</b> possible. It is an object-based method that provides functional abstraction of the sensors and machines. The objects include skills, sensor drivers, logical sensors, and machine drivers. The skills are defined in the form of templates that completely specify a sensor-based robot action. Other significant results ensue from the two listed above, for example, the possibility of standardization in robot programming at the skill level. The ability to separate the responsibilities of individuals with different capabilities is another objective that has the side effect of making robot systems development manageable. The computational model presented is called "SKills-Oriented Robot Programming (SKORP). " In this model the skills execute exclusive of each other and therefore the computation for each skill can be represented independently. Skills are designed and documented using realtime design tools from the multiactivity paradigm. The SKORP model provides consistent and usable design methods for describing computation in embedded systems. These design tools are used by the system programmer to guarantee the realtime interaction of the software modules that compose a skill. This research is directed toward industrial robotics in traditional and non-traditional habitats, but the model presented is equally applicable to any numerically controlled machine that either requires sensors or interacts with the environment in a complex way...|$|R
40|$|Traces is an artwork for the CAVE {{that uses}} a novel machine vision system to enable {{unencumbered}} full body interaction {{with a range of}} semi-autonomous agents without the imposition of any sort of textual, <b>iconic</b> or encoded-gestural <b>interfaces</b> and without physically restrictive wiring, pointing devices, or headgear. Furthermore, Traces does not consist of a "world" which is "navigated "; instead, the movement of the user through the space leaves volumetric and spatial-acoustic residues of user movement which slowly decay. This project was motivated by a desire to explore and critique four central issues in contemporary HCI: (a) embodied interaction with computational systems; (b) rapid and transparent learning of interfaces by untrained users (the autopedagogic interface); (c) immersive bodily interaction with software agents, (d) extension and elaboration of the general conception of "interactivity" itself. To explore these issues, we built an infra-red multi-camera machine vision system which constructs a volumetric model of the whole of the users' body in real time. We have als...|$|R
