40|$|Over {{recent years}} the Master in Business Administration program has been {{increasingly}} criticised as less {{in touch with the}} needs of the business community, becoming overly theoretical, delivering the wrong content and using the wrong teaching methodologies (Schlegelmilch & Thomas, 2011; Gosling and Mintzberg 2004; Walz 2006). Surveys of European and American MBA programs reveals that the majority have very similar structures and content with an emphasis on functional business knowledge such as marketing, accounting, economics, finance and strategy and lacking in interpersonal, presentation skills, ethics and change management (Matten and Moon 2004; Christensen, Peirce Hartman, Hoffman & Carrier, 2007). This paper presents a review of literature relating to MBA programs regarding content and structure and then aligns this to results of a survey of practicing managers to verify or refute these criticisms. A <b>desk</b> <b>audit</b> of the top 10 Australian MBAs is then presented in the light of these findings. It is the author&# 039;s contention that this research demonstrates that Australian MBAs are not meeting business needs...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{findings}} of an Australia-wide survey conducted {{as part of a}} national teacher education research project that explored the preparation of teachers to teach literacy and numeracy in Australian schools (Louden, Rohl, Gore, Greaves, McIntosh, Wright, Siemon 2 ̆ 6 House, 2005) 1. The project included various phases of inquiry, beginning with a <b>desk</b> <b>audit</b> of teacher education program characteristics and an international literature review (Gore 2 ̆ 6 Griffiths, 2002), that drew on literature published in English in the last few decades. The issues identified in the literature review guided the construction of a set of national focus groups that targeted early years, primary and secondary teachers and teacher educators. Data from the focus groups informed three nationally representative questionnaire surveys, the purpose of which was to determine the preparedness of new graduates to teach literacy and numeracy to a range of school students. A survey was designed for each of the following three groups: senior school staff, primary beginning teachers and secondary beginning teachers...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{is based on}} the fact that many rivers in East Kalimantan are complained to be polluted by coal mining activities even though many rules to protect surface waters are in place and obeyed. To explain why it is happened, an audit is conducted to the regulations and to the implementation of the regulations. <b>Desk</b> <b>audit</b> is carried out to assess whether the regulations about waste assimilative capacity and effluent limitation that are currently endorsed are appropriate or not compared to the TMDL concept. The audit of implementation is carried out to assess whether the regulations are applied thoroughly or not. The results is that the technical regulations to determine the class of water and to allocation waste load are absent. Therefore, many regulations related the water quality based effluent limitation are not implemented properly. Most of effluent limitation refer directly to the national or provincial standards that are usually less stringent than the water quality based standard of the local rivers or small rivers. The case study in Loa Haur River obtains that the waste assimilative capacity of the river is 33. 696 ton of TSS/day. The WAC that is allocated to 6 (six) coal mining in the sub basin of Loa Haur is 5 ton/day. The allocation {{is based on the}}ir production capacity. The results of water quality based effluent limitation of coal mining companies in the Loa Haur sub basin is 0. 17 ton TSS/day or its concentration of 114. 63 mg/L...|$|E

50|$|Help {{desk and}} {{incident}} reporting auditing is {{an examination of}} the controls within the help <b>desk</b> operations. The <b>audit</b> process collects and evaluates evidence of an organization's help desk and incident reporting practices, and operations. The audit ensures that all problems reported by users have been adequately documented and that controls exist so that only authorized staff can archive the users’ entries. It also determine if there are sufficient controls to escalate issues according to priority.|$|R

40|$|Implementation {{of energy}} service {{projects}} {{continue to increase}} as building owners are faced with higher utility bills, rigorous environmental regulations, and shrinking capital allocation for such projects. Different techniques and guidelines are available to select and quantify energy service projects. These methods range from various Technical reference manuals (TRMs) developed by state agencies in conjunction with energy consultants to standard protocols developed by energy professional organizations. All of these methods require gathering or estimating representative input variables, with various approaches to data collection that vary from stipulation to measurement-based values. The methods to quantify the savings range widely from engineering algorithms to as-built calibrated whole-building energy simulation models. In this study, a comparison is made between the engineering algorithms supported by many TRMs and a more accurate as-built calibrated whole-building energy simulation model. The methods to performing the comparison included identifying industry methods through literature reviews, expert interviews, a <b>desk</b> <b>audit</b> of a typical utility assessment report, and constructing an as-built calibrated whole-building energy simulation model of a well-instrumented, large office building near the Texas A&M University campus. Lighting and lighting control energy conservation measures (ECMs) were selected to demonstrate the methodology. As {{part of the process}} of constructing the simulation model, a data collection protocol was also created. The data collection protocol included gathering building and site specific information including sub-hourly measured energy consumption data and measured climatic data for the baseline year. The study results showed that the industry methods of quantifying the total energy savings for lighting and lighting control ECMs were consistently under-reporting the savings as compared to the calibrated as-built whole-building energy simulation model. In particular, the breakdown of savings was inconsistent between the various industry methods that are currently in use. The differences were perceived to be location specific and weather driven and also included agreements with the local utility companies to quantify the demand savings. Finally, the study results also indicated that the current industry methods could be significantly improved by measuring the occupancy schedule and indoor temperature...|$|E
40|$|Combined Cooling Heat and Power (CHP) is {{a master}} term for onsite power {{generation}} technologies that sequentially produce electrical or mechanical energy and useful thermal energy. Some form of CHP has existed for more than 100 years {{and it is now}} achieving a greater level of acceptance due to an increasing need for reliable power service and energy cost management. Capturing and using the heat produced as a byproduct of generating electricity from fuel sources increases the usable energy that can be obtained from the original fuel source. CHP technologies have the potential to reduce energy consumption through increased efficiency [...] decreasing energy bills as well as pollution. The EPA recognizes CHP as a potent climate change mitigation measure. The U. S. Department of Energy (D. O. E.) Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP) is assisting Federal agencies to realize their energy efficiency goals. CHP is an efficiency measure that is receiving growing attention because of its sizable potential to provide efficiency, environmental, and reliability benefits. CHP therefore benefits the host facility, the electric infrastructure, and the U. S. society as a whole. This report and study seeks to make a preliminary inquiry into near term CHP opportunities for federal facilities in selected U. S. regions. It offers to help focus the attention of policy makers and energy facility managers on good candidate facilities for CHP. First, a ranked list of high potential individual sites is identified. Then, several classes of federal facilities are identified for the multiple opportunities they offer as a class. Recommendations are then offered for appropriate next steps for the evaluation and cost effective implementation of CHP. This study was designed to ultimately rank federal facilities in terms of their potential to take advantage of CHP economic and external savings in the near term. In order to best serve the purposes of this study, projections have been expressed in terms of sizing CHP to thermal and electrical estimates. The table below is a summary of findings of CHP potential for those federal facilities that chose to participate in the screening process. The study focused on three U. S. regions: California, Texas, and New York/New England. All federal facilities in these three regions with reported building space greater than 100, 000 square feet were initial targets to contact and offer CHP screening services. Ranking criteria were developed to screen sites for near term CHP potential. The potential site list was pared down {{for a variety of reasons}} including site- specific and agency wide decisions not to participate, <b>desk</b> <b>audit</b> assessments, and untraceable contact information. The results are based upon the voluntary participation of those sites we were able to contact, so they reflect a fraction of the total potential CHP opportunities at federal government facilities...|$|E
40|$|Abstract-AThis paper {{describes}} a study investigating attitudes to noise as an occupational hazard. The {{objectives of the}} study were to understand the individual and organizational factors which affect attitudes towards noise induced hearing loss (NIHL) and to relate these to the standards of hearing conservation achieved in industry as demonstrated by compliance with the Noise at Work Regulations. The study comprised a survey of 48 organizations across Britain, and a more detailed examination of 10 of these as case studies. Methods used included <b>desk</b> research, <b>audits</b> of hearing conservation programmes, questionnaires and interviews. Whilst there is widespread acceptance that industrial noise is a hazard, it is one that is frequently taken for granted, and measures to deal with it are often inadequate. Most organizations place the onus on the workforce to protect their own hearing through the use of personal hearing protectors Workers reactions to noise tended however to be passive and much of the time neither managers nor the workforce are concious of the noise hazard. This is the case even where some managers are committed to good industrial housekeeping and accident prevention. An effective hearing conservation programme requires three management attributes: leadershi...|$|R
