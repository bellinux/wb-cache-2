40|$|Background and Purpose Medio-lateral {{postural}} instability {{has recently}} {{been identified as a}} risk factor for falls in the elderly community-dwelling population. However, few clinical tests involve challenges to stability limits in the medio-lateral direction. A lateral reach test was thus developed. Preliminary evaluation of the symmetry, accuracy, test-retest repeatability, and construct validity of the lateral reach test was undertaken to ensure its validity and repeatability prior to clinical application. Method Sixty healthy older female subjects (aged 72. 5 ± 5 years) participated in this study which involved two tasks. The first was the clinical test: a maximal lateral reach to the right and left, recorded by a clinical measure (observation of hand excursion) and a laboratory measure (3 D analysis of <b>hand</b> <b>marker</b> excursion). The second was the recording of centre of pressure (COP) stability limits in the lateral direction by use of a dual force platform system. Eighteen subjects returned for repeatability testing. Results No significant differences in the measures were found between the sides. Lateral reach as measured by the clinical measure was significantly (p 0. 01) from the laboratory measure. High test-retest repeatability (r > 0. 94) was found for all measures. Conclusions The clinical lateral reach test was found to be an accurate measure of lateral reach ability. As it was significantly correlated with COP excursion it was deemed a valid indicator of lateral stability limits. In addition, the lateral reach test had high test-retest repeatability and was symmetrical between the sides. These promising results support both it 2 ̆ 7 s use where a clinical indicator of medio-lateral postural stability is desired and further investigation of the lateral reach test in clinical populations.

40|$|The {{migration}} of inert markers {{as a result}} of unequal mobilities of the components during solid-state interdiffusion in a binary system can be rationalized using a Kirkendall velocity construction. It is demonstrated that in a diffusion-controlled interaction the Kirkendall plane, identified by inert particles (markers) placed at the original contact surface of a reaction couple, need not be unique. Multiple planes can develop, but, on the other <b>hand,</b> <b>markers</b> at the original interface sometimes can get dispersed into a diffuse zone {{on both sides of the}} contact surface and no unique location of the Kirkendall plans can be defined. It is also shown that the location of the Kirkendall plane(s) inside the diffusion zone can be identified by grain morphology changes within the microstructure of the reaction products. A physico-chemical approach is developed which elucidates the role of the Kirkendall effect in the morphologenesis of interdiffusion systems. The occurence of one or more Kirkendall planes, characterized by morphology changes in the reaction layers, turns out to be related to different nucleation sites of the product grains...|$|R

Morphological markers include traits such as plant height, disease response, photoperiod, sensitivity, shape or colour of flowers, fruits or seeds etc. Molecular markers include biochemical constituents. Morphological markers have many limitations for being used as markers particularly in fruit crops because of long generation time and large size of fruit trees besides being influenced by environment. Consequently, molecular markers could be appropriate choice to study and preserve the diversity in any germplasm.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between asymptomatic shedding of bacterial enteropathogens and the hygiene habits of {{families who have}} had a child with typhoid fever (TF) are investigated. The sample was made up of 80 families: 40 families in which one child had had TF (Group A) and 40 in which no children or either of the parents had had a history of TF (Group B). In each group 20 families belonged to a low socieconomic status (SES) and 20 to a high SES. A structured interview was used to evaluate the SES and the hygiene habits of the child; observations were made to measure the hygiene habits of the family (toilet, kitchen and food preparation) and bacteriological studies (fecal samples and <b>hand</b> <b>markers).</b> Results show that carriers were more frequent in Group A than in Group B. The bacterial species found were significantly more numerous in Group A than in Group B (fecal samples: E. coli, the classic serotypes, Shigella ssp, and hand markers: E. coli). Families of Group A had higher carriage rates than those of Group B. Finally there exists a significantly higher association between inadequate hygiene habits and carrier families. These results show the need to teach specific habits of proper hygiene to the entire population, because the fact of belonging to the high SES does not in itself preclude inadequate hygiene habits...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Folliculo-stellate {{cells are}} a nonendocrine, sustentacular-like {{complementary}} {{population of the}} anterior pituitary. They currently are considered as functionally and phenotypically heterogeneous, with one subpopulation of folliculo-stellate cells possibly representing resident adenohypophyseal macrophages. We took advantage of a limited T-cell mediated inflammatory reaction selectively involving tumor tissue in three cases of pituitary adenoma (2 prolactin cell adenomas, and 1 null cell adenoma) {{to test the hypothesis}} whether some folliculo-stellate cells within inflammatory foci would also assume monocytic/dendritic properties. Immunohistochemical double labeling for S- 100 protein and the class II major histocompatibility antigen HLA-DR indeed showed several arborized cells to coexpress both epitopes. These were distributed both amidst adenomatous acini and along intratumoral vessels, and were morphologically undistinguishable from conventional folliculo-stellate cells. On the other <b>hand,</b> <b>markers</b> of follicular dendritic cells (CD 21) and Langerhans' cells (CD 1 a) tested negative. Furthermore, no S- 100 /HLA-DR coexpressing folliculo-stellate cells were seen in either peritumoral parenchyma of the cases in point nor in control pituitary adenomas lacking inflammatory reaction. These findings suggest that a subset of folliculo-stellate cells may be induced by an appropriate local inflammatory microenvironment to assume a dendritic cell-like immunophenotype recognizable by their coexpression of S- 100 protein and HLA-DR. By analogy with HLA-DR expressing cells in well-established extrapituitary inflammatory constellations, we speculate that folliculo-stellate cells with such immunophenotype may actually perform professional antigen presentation. A distinctly uncommon finding in pituitary adenomas, lymphocytic infiltrates may therefore be read as a manifestation of tumoral immunosurveillance. </p...|$|R

We tested domestic dogs (Canis familiaris) in three studies aimed at pinning down the relative contributions of the human's <b>hand</b> and the <b>marker</b> itself. We baited one of two cups (outside of the dogs' view) and gave the dog a communicative cue to find the food. Study 1 systematically varied dogs' perceptual access to the marker placing event, so that dogs saw either the whole human, the <b>hand</b> only, the <b>marker</b> only, or nothing. Follow-up trials investigated the effect of removing the marker before the dog's choice. Dogs used the marker as a communicative cue even when it had been removed prior to the dog's choice and attached more importance to this cue than to the hand that placed it although {{the presence of the}} hand boosted performance when it appeared together with the marker. Study 2 directly contrasted the importance of the <b>hand</b> and the <b>marker</b> and revealed that the effect of the marker diminished if it had been associated with both cups. In contrast touching both cups with the hand had no effect on performance. Study 3 investigated whether the means of marker placement (intentional or accidental) had an effect on dogs' choices. Results showed that dogs did not differentiate intentional and accidental placing of the marker. These results suggest that dogs use the marker as a genuine communicative cue quite independently from the experimenter's actions...|$|R

The study is based on three balanced comparable corpora which represent British English, native Chinese and translational Chinese in addition to an English-Chinese parallel corpus which provides a basis for comparing native and translated English and investigating explicitation in translation. Our results show that word clusters are substantially more common in translated Chinese, suggesting a tendency in translations to use fixed and semi-fixed recurring patterns in an attempt to achieve improved fluency. The more frequent use of word clusters, especially those of high frequency and high coverage in translational Chinese, is also likely to be a result of the influence of the English source language because word clusters are significantly more prevalent in native English in relation to native Chinese. Chinese and English tend to use reformulation markers of different styles while on the other <b>hand,</b> reformulation <b>markers</b> are generally more common in both translated English and translated Chinese than in their native counterparts, suggesting that reformulation markers function as a strategy for explicitation in translations, which tend to use oral, stylistically simpler forms than non-translated texts...|$|R
40|$|Restocking from captive-reared red-legged {{partridges}} (Alectoris rufa) is {{a frequent}} practice in some Spanish regions, due to the strong decrease of wild populations size in the last years. Chukar partridges (A. chukar), which never lived as wild game birds in Spain, are more prolific and efficient meat producers, being legally bred in many Spanish farms to be directly sent to slaughterhouses. Releasing foreign partridges species or hybrids is strictly forbidden by hunting and environment preservation laws. However, eventual hybridization with chukar partridges in breeding farms is a worrying possibility as, in many cases, farms produce birds for both meat and restocking purposes. DNA analyses might be useful to elucidate the genetic purity of wild or farmed partridges. Single Strand Conformation Polymorphisms (SSCP´s) were studied on individual DNA samples from Spanish supposed red-legged and captive chukar partridges. Two mitochondrial (Cytochrome B and D-loop) and one nuclear (Ribosomal DNA-intervening transcribed spacer, ITS) regions were considered for Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) design and further polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
