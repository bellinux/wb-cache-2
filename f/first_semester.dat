This paper examines the use of alternate specifications of 1 -year retention that include information about spring semester stopout behavior. Different types of discrete choice models are first described, Next, the multinomial logit model using four outcomes (enrolled <b>first</b> fall <b>semester</b> only; enrolled <b>first</b> fall <b>semester</b> and spring semester; enrolled <b>first</b> fall <b>semester,</b> stopped out and returned the following fall; and enrolled all three semesters) is compared with the traditional dichotomous logit approach using the 3, 589 first-time full-degree seeking freshmen enrolled at a large university. The pseudo R-square indicates the multinomial model fits the data better, but for practical reasons it has very poor predictive power. The multinomial model does yield interesting results {{for the impact of}} independent variables on retention; for example, increases in high school grade point average impacts the probability of a student being in the fall-spring outcome more than the probability of falling in the <b>first</b> fall <b>semester</b> only outcome.
