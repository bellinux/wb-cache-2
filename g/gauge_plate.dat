40|$|In this work, a {{fundamental}} {{study of the}} wear transition regimes was carried out for a pin-on-disk sliding couple, involving hardened <b>gauge</b> <b>plate</b> steel (disks) and titanium base titanium carbide composite coatings (pins). The coating {{was carried out by}} a TIG process. The sliding speed was varied from 0. 38 to 1. 5 m s- 1, and the normal load varied from 10 to 50 N. Dry sliding wear behaviour of hardened <b>gauge</b> <b>plate</b> disks was characterized by abrasive-oxidative wear at lower normal loads while adhesive-oxidative wear predominated at high normal load with iron oxide transfer to Ti base TiC composite coatings pins. In contrast, micro-polishing and adhesive wear predominated for the CP-Ti base TiC composite coatings pins along with very mild abrasive wear. A tribo-system approach has been adopted to investigate the wear behaviour of TiC coatings and hardened <b>gauge</b> <b>plate</b> against each other. Wear maps have been constructed to represent the wear mode transitions and the observed wear mechanisms have been discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} the differential effects of kinesthetic imagery (first person perspective) and visual imagery (third person perspective) on postural sway during quiet standing. Based on an embodied cognition perspective, the authors predicted that kinesthetic imagery would lead to activations in movement-relevant motor systems {{to a greater degree}} than visual imagery. This prediction was tested among 30 participants who imagined various motor activities from different visual perspectives while standing on a strain <b>gauge</b> <b>plate.</b> The results showed that kinesthetic imagery of lower body movements, but not of upper body movements, had clear effects on postural parameters (sway path length and frequency contents of sway). Visual imagery, in contrast, had no reliable effects on postural activity. We also found that postural effects were not affected by the vividness of imagery. The results suggest that during kinesthetic motor imagery participants partially simulated (re-activated) the imagined movements, leading to unintentional postural adjustments. These findings are consistent with an embodied cognition perspective on motor imagery...|$|E
40|$|The welding {{performance}} of CO 2 lasers is strongly {{affected by the}} clamping geometry andwelding speed. Moreover, the rapid cooling rate associated with laser welding results in an untempered martensitic structure and a transverse variation in the hardness profile. An untempered martensitic structure can lead to brittle welds, and particularly for samples that are subject to cyclic loading, component fatigue and failure. To avoid this problem {{it is useful to}} optimize the laser operating parameters to reduce hardness discontinuities throughout the workpiece. An experimental investigation into the weld quality was performed to quantify the effects of clamping and translation velocity by examining the hardness characteristics, weld width and weld depth. A <b>gauge</b> <b>plate,</b> 2 mm thick, was welded with a 1 kW, CW, CO 2 laser for a range of translation velocities between 800 and 1500 mm per min, a He shielding was used at a pressure of 5 × 10 4 Pa. Two weld geometries, namely clamped and unclamped, were considered. The clamped geometry gave improved hardness characteristics and a coarse grainstructure. Whereas for the same operating conditions, the unclamped geometry gave a deeper weld penetration and wider weld width...|$|E

40|$|The study {{examines}} sedimentation {{changes on the}} flood tide delta in the Breede River estuary since 1942, and relates these changes in sedimentation {{to changes in the}} hydrology of the river, as a consequence of damming the river and its tributaries. Sequential aerial photography is used to determine changes in the extent of the Zostera beds on the flood delta, this being indicative of changes in the substrate sediments. Four cores were taken from the flood delta, and standard grainsize analysis techniques employed to establish the composition and characteristics of the sediments. Together with survey work and other ancillary information, these twci techniques enable description of the sedimentation changes and the present sediment dynamics on the flood tide delta. Virgin catchment runoff was simulated using two models, having rainfall data as the primary input. Simulated and actual runoff, as determined from <b>gauge</b> <b>plate</b> data, were qualitatively compared in terms of mean monthly runoff and cumulative annual runoff. This, together with an examination of temporal increases in the total volume of water impounded in the catchment, enables the impact of dams on the hydrology of the river to be determined. It is found {{that there has been a}} virtually complete annihilation of the mudflat the Zostera beds, a concomitant loss of the areas, and that the sediments presently occurring on the flood delta are almost wholly of marine origin. Temporally, these changes correlate well with increased impoundment of runoff in the catchment. It is concluded that there has been an increase in marine sedimentation on the flood tide delta, and that this change in sedimentation is directly related to and consequent upon changes in the hydrology of the river as a result of impounding catchment runoff...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{the subject}} of {{sensitisation}} in unstabilised ferritic/martensitic dual phase 11 - 14 %Cr steels has been investigated in some detail {{after a number of}} failures in service due to accelerated corrosion. It was found that sensitisation could occur due to a number of different mechanisms which were dependant on the heat treatment, the number of thermal cycles and the phases present in the material. All the detected modes of sensitisation could be prevented by stabilisation with titanium or niobium and suitable design of the material composition to produce a suitably high ferrite factor. However, these options could not readily be applied to thick <b>gauge</b> <b>plate</b> and therefore 12 %Cr material available in the market above 10 mm thickness still tends to be unstabilised. This project was initiated with the intention of determining how sensitisation would manifest itself during welding of thicker plates and whether the degree of sensitisation could be controlled to acceptable levels by appropriate control of the welding parameters. This was done in two phases, namely evaluation of actual welds produced using varying heat input parameters and by simulation of the thermal treatment using a Gleeble 3500 thermomechanical simulator. The samples were evaluated using standard immersion tests (Strauss test) and electrochemical techniques. Mode 2 sensitisation was found to occur on all samples and on all materials, irrespective of the welding parameters. This occurred at all points where the heat affected zone (HAZ) from one weld bead intersected with the HAZ from a previous bead. However, the sensitised regions were generally well {{below the surface of the}} material and would therefore not be exposed to the atmosphere and any corrosive environment. The exception to this rule occurred when very high heat input resulted in an excessively large HAZ or when poor weld bead positioning and inappropriate bead overlap resulted in sensitisation of the HAZ on the surface. Mode 3 sensitisation did not occur within the range of welding parameters investigated. Mode 4 sensitisation was found to occur on all materials but could not reliably be detected by the Strauss test. Electrochemical evaluation clearly showed that sensitisation was present in the subcritical HAZ on all materials, irrespective of welding conditions. However, the degree of sensitisation was very low. From a practical perspective, problems in service due to sensitisation are most likely to arise from very high heat input levels and welding defects such as excessive overlap of weld beads and incomplete fusion...|$|E

50|$|The canal {{runs along}} a ridge of hills {{to the west}} of the Pennines, and is at a {{relatively}} high level. The southern section from the Trent and Mersey Canal to the foot of Bosley locks is at 400 ft above ordnance datum (AOD) and the locks raise the level by 118 ft so that the summit level is at 518 ft AOD. This required a reservoir to be built at a high level, where few of the streams were sufficiently large to maintain its level. The obvious source of water was the River Dane, which the canal crosses at the foot of the Bosley flight, but that already supplied the Caldon Canal and so could not be used. Instead, a network of almost 5 mi of feeders were built on the hills, which extracted water from streams at thirteen locations. One fed the much smaller Turks Head or Sutton reservoir, two fed into the canal directly, and the rest supplied Bosley Reservoir. At each extraction point, a <b>gauging</b> <b>plate</b> was fitted to ensure that the stream below it still received some water, and the size of the cast iron <b>gauging</b> <b>plates</b> were specified in the original Act of Parliament.|$|R

40|$|Recent {{experiments}} involving near-contact underwater explosions on air-backed plates {{suggest the}} following failure mode categories: (1) holing and petaling, (2) complete or partial edge tearing due to shock only, (3) complete or partial edge tearing due to shock and bubble collapse, and (4) large deformation without rupture. Finite-element {{analysis was used}} to further investigate the detailed response and failure of the plates, and determine the limit between center plate holing and edge failure. When compared with experimental results, finite-elements showed good agreement with the failure modes of the plates and reasonable agreement with the experimental deformations. It was found that the linear interaction criteria (LIC) failure between plastic strain and through-thickness shear stress produced results closer to experiments than the quadratic interaction criteria (QIC). For the 18 ~gauge specimens {{it was found that the}} through-thickness shear dominated the failure initiation for very close proximity charges, with the direct strain becoming dominant as the standoff was increased.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{increased}} use of metal-plate-connected (MPC) parallel-chord wood floor trusses calls for a corresponding emphasis {{on the need for}} fully disclosed research and testing of web/chord joint behavior. Standardized industry procedures utilizing parallel and perpendicular-to-grain joint tests have resulted in improper design values. Instances of connector plate tooth-withdrawal in minimum five-year-old trusses have led to expensive repairs. Thirty-seven truss joint specimens removed from an existing apartment project were tested. Web/chord connections were found to have a mean ultimate strength of 165 N (37 lbF) per tooth, a value much lower than predicted by accepted standards. Trusses in additional projects were inspected and failing web/chord connections were calculated to have a mean ultimate capacity “at slip ” of 60 N (13. 5 lbF) to 67 N (15. 1 lbF). In some cases, application of standardized safety factors to tested ultimate strength values leads to allowable design values greater than observed slip values. Until adequate industry testing is performed and disclosed and adequate standards are developed, a maximum allowable design force of 20 N (4. 5 lbF) per tooth for 1. 0 mm (20 <b>gauge)</b> <b>plates,</b> regardless of plate manufacturer, is suggested...|$|R

30|$|Pressure sensor {{units for}} oceanographic {{applications}} have been employed {{since the late}} 1960 ’s (e.g., Munk and Zetler, 1967). Various types of pressure transducers have been investigated for obtaining high-quality ocean bottom pressure (OBP) records. These include vibrating wires, strain <b>gauges,</b> capacitance <b>plates,</b> and quartz-crystal resonators. The quartz-crystal resonator transducer is most commonly used at present because of its high sensitivity to pressure, high resolution, and long-term stability (Eble et al., 1989; Joseph, 2011). Devices incorporating the quartz resonator manufactured by Paroscientific, Inc. (hereafter Paros), and by Hewlett-Packard, Inc. (hereafter HP), are currently used as water-depth sensors. In general, the physical pressure measurement is obtained from the vibrational frequency of the transducer, which changes with ambient pressure and temperature. Therefore, thermal effects must be accurately corrected to obtain a meaningful physical pressure value. A built-in thermometer is needed to accurately measure {{the temperature of the}} transducer. The manufacturers provide conversion equations, and tables of calibration coefficients, to calculate an accurate physical pressure value, with a thermal correction, from the vibrational frequency, for the respective sensors. The procedures to obtain the physical pressure value with a pressure-measurement system were introduced by Eble et al. (1989) for the Paros sensors, and by Takahashi (1981 a) for the HP sensors.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Brittle crack {{arrestability}} {{is extremely}} important in welded joints of heavy <b>gauge</b> steel <b>plates</b> used in large container ships. Recently, much attention {{has been focused on}} potential crack propagation along welds using large heat input. This paper examines the application of a T-joint to the strength deck structure of container ships to enhance crack arrestability. The crack arrest toughness, Kca, for crack arrest was varied. The ESSO test of T-joint components showed that brittle crack was arrested at the T-joint if the steel plate used for the flange had a high Kca value in the range from 4900 to 7300 N/mm 3 / 2. FE-analysis of the stress intensity factor K indicated that brittle crack propagation was arrested under the condition that the K-value at the running crack tip was less than the Kca of the material. In the T-joint, it was noted that the K-value around the area of the deepest point of the crack decreased and was finally less than the Kca of the flange plate when the brittle crack penetrated suddenly into the flange plate to a 10 mm depth. This phenomenon shows the advantage of using a T-joint for brittle crack arrest in the flange plates of strength deck structures...|$|R
40|$|The {{importance}} of distinguishing and discretely studying the subprocesses of runoff generation and erosion {{has led to}} the development of rainfall simulations on small plots.

Main outcome measurements: During each trial, kinetic and lower limb kinematic data were measured using a strain <b>gauge</b> force <b>plate</b> and six infrared cameras respectively. Electromyographic (EMG) data from six muscles (tibialis anterior (TA), peroneus longus (PE), lateral gastrocnemius (LG), rectus femoris (RF), biceps femoris (BF) and gluteus medius (GM)) were measured with a telemetric EMG system.

Similarly, preactivation (integrated EMG (IEMG) in 100 ms before heel strike) of TA was lower for injured runners than uninjured runners. RF and GM IEMG activity 100 ms after heel strike was also lower in the injured group. However, impact forces were not different between the two groups.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In the beginning, the {{classical}} one-dimensional analysis of piezoelectric active sensors is reviewed. The complete derivation for a free-free sensor is then extended {{to cover the}} cases of clamped and elastically constrained sensors. An analytical model based on structural vibration theory and theory of piezoelectricity was developed and used to predict the electro-mechanical (E/M) impedance response, {{as it would be}} measured at the piezoelectric active sensor’s terminals. The model considers one-dimensional structures and accounts for both axial and flexural vibrations. The numerical analysis was performed and supported by experimental results. Experiments were conducted on simple beam specimens to support of the theoretical investigation, and on thin <b>gauge</b> aluminum <b>plates</b> to illustrate the method’s potential. It was shown that E/M impedance spectrum recorded by the piezoelectric active sensor accurately represents the mechanical response of a structure. It was further proved that the response of the structure is not modified by the presence of the sensor, thus validating the sensor’s non-invasive characteristics. The sensor calibration procedure is outlined and statistical analysis was presented. It was found that PZT active sensors have stable and repeatable characteristics not only in as-received condition, but also while mounted on 1 -D or 2 -D host structure. It is shown that such sensors, of negligible mass, can be permanently applied to the structure creating a non-intrusive sensor array adequate for on-line automatic structural identification and health monitoring...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} {{moveable}} steel infills {{is to provide}} owners, such as hospitals, the freedom to redesign {{the interior of the}} building without the limitations imposed by non-moveable lateral load resisting systems. The scope of the research under way is to investigate two different types of moveable infill panels. The first involves using sheets of cold-formed corrugated steel to create a steel plate shear wall. Conceptually this idea is similar to using thicker hot-rolled flat plates as steel plate shear walls. That latter case was investigated by a number of researchers (e. g. Caccese et al. 1993, and Timler et al. 1998, to name a few). However, the thicker plates may have limited use in retrofit situations because of the high demands they place on the existing columns, requiring column reinforcement to prevent columns failure before the plates have a chance to dissipate energy through metallic yielding. To avoid this, light <b>gauge</b> corrugated steel <b>plate</b> infill could be used for energy dissipation. When properly designed, energy could be dissipated through plate yielding while the demand on the columns is kept below the critical value. The second type of infill that will be tested uses partition walls made of cold-formed steel studs and flat-strap cross bracing to dissipate energy in a seismic event. These walls may not be very strong individually, but several of them used in a typical building could be effective...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2007 Lateral heel wedge {{orthotics}} {{are designed}} to reduce medial tibiofemoral joint loading and pain in patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA). To date, the efficacy of long-term lateral heel wedge orthotics use among OA patients has not been determined. This study evaluated {{the extent to which}} lateral heel wedge orthotics reduced medial knee joint loading during walking and stair descent in knee OA patients. A secondary purpose was to measure the effects of lateral heel wedge orthotics on selected health-related quality of life parameters. A cohort of 36 men and women with moderate to severe medial knee OA were assigned to either an Orthotics group (mean age, 60. 8 ± 9. 8 yrs; mean BMI, 28. 1 ± 3. 71) or Control group (mean age, 61. 0 ± 9. 2 yrs; mean BMI, 28. 0 ± 4. 3). The Orthotics group wore a pair of custom-made 7 ° lateral heel wedges daily for 12 weeks. The Control group wore a pair of neutral inserts for 12 weeks. Pain and functional levels were assessed using a 100 -mm visual analog pain scale and the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC™). Three-dimensional kinematic and kinetic data during level walking and stair descent were collected using a nine-camera motion analysis system synchronized with two strain <b>gauge</b> force <b>plates.</b> Subjects performed 5 walking trials and 5 stair descent trials at 3 different speeds, e. g., self-selected pace, slower, and faster. Biomechanical and health-related quality of life data were collected from subjects at baseline, 6 weeks and 12 weeks. Using inverse dynamics equations, lower extremity joint moments and angles were calculated. Eleven dependent variables were analyzed with univariate Group (2) x Time (3) between/within ANOVAs. A weighted Bonferroni adjustment was used to protect against Type I error. During level walking trials, the early stance peak external knee adduction moment decreased 14. 6 % in the Orthotics group from Week 1 to Week 12 (p 0. 05). However, at Week 12 subjects in the Orthotics group had an average 47 % reduction in self-reported pain levels during stair descent compared with their pain scores at entry into the study (p = 0. 038). These findings suggest that lateral heel wedge orthotics can effectively lower medial knee joint loading for OA patients during level walking, while also reducing pain during the difficult task of descending stairs...|$|R
