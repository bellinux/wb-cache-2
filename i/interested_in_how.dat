5|$|For his studies, Kohlberg {{relied on}} stories {{such as the}} Heinz dilemma, and was <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>how</b> {{individuals}} would justify their actions if placed in similar moral dilemmas. He then analyzed the form of moral reasoning displayed, rather than its conclusion, and classified it as belonging to one of six distinct stages.|$|E
5|$|The {{chart on}} the right depicts children's beliefs about the parity of zero, as they {{progress}} from Year 1 to Year 6 of the English education system. The data are from Len Frobisher, who conducted a pair of surveys of English schoolchildren. Frobisher was <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>how</b> knowledge of single-digit parity translates to knowledge of multiple-digit parity, and zero figures prominently in the results.|$|E
5|$|Although the Coris were {{discouraged}} from working together at Roswell, {{they continued to}} do so, specializing in investigating carbohydrate metabolism. They were particularly <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>how</b> glucose is metabolized {{in the human body}} and the hormones that regulate this process. They published fifty papers while at Roswell, with first author status going to the one who had done most of the research for a given paper. Gerty Cori published eleven articles as the sole author. In 1929, they proposed the theoretical cycle that later won them the Nobel Prize, the Cori cycle.|$|E

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} a great deal of <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>how</b> feature films may create {{attractive}} destination images. Research has primarily focussed on films which promote scenery and to a lesser extent nostalgic rural cultures. In contrast there has been little attention paid to historic films, the main exception being Braveheart. The 2003 release of Ned Kelly provoked a great deal of media <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>how</b> that film might promote tourism to north-eastern Victoria. This paper examines how the film Ned Kelly interacts with tourists and their expectations...|$|R

25|$|In the 1960s, Watts became {{increasingly}} <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>how</b> identifiable patterns in nature tend to repeat {{themselves from the}} smallest of scales to the most immense. This became one of his passions in his research and thought.|$|E

25|$|Often we are <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>how</b> {{the moving}} {{groundwater}} will transport dissolved contaminants around (the sub-field of contaminant hydrogeology). The contaminants can be man-made (e.g., petroleum products, nitrate, Chromium or radionuclides) or naturally occurring (e.g., arsenic, salinity).

25|$|Simon was <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>how</b> humans learn and, with Edward Feigenbaum, he {{developed}} the EPAM (Elementary Perceiver and Memorizer) theory, {{one of the first}} theories of learning to be implemented as a computer program. EPAM was able to explain a large number of phenomena in the field of verbal learning. Later versions of the model were applied to concept formation and the acquisition of expertise. With Fernand Gobet, he has expanded the EPAM theory into the CHREST computational model. The theory explains how simple chunks of information form the building blocks of schemata, which are more complex structures. CHREST has been used predominantly, to simulate aspects of chess expertise.|$|E
25|$|In October 1879, Sherrington entered Cambridge as a non-collegiate student. The {{following}} year he entered Gonville and Caius College. Sherrington was quite the student. In June 1881 he took Part I in the Natural Sciences Tripos and {{was awarded a}} starred First in physiology; there were 9 candidates in all (8 men, 1 woman), of whom five gained Firsts; in June 1883 in Part II of the Tripos he also gained a First, alongside William Bateson. Walter Holbrook Gaskell, one of Sherrington's tutors, informed him in November 1881 that he had earned the highest marks for his year in botany, human anatomy, and physiology; second in zoology; and highest overall. John Newport Langley was Sherrington's other tutor. The two were <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>how</b> anatomical structure is expressed in physiological function.|$|E

25|$|In 1926 Pauling {{was awarded}} a Guggenheim Fellowship to travel to Europe, to study under German {{physicist}} Arnold Sommerfeld in Munich, Danish physicist Niels Bohr in Copenhagen and Austrian physicist Erwin Schrödinger in Zürich. All three were experts in the new field of quantum mechanics and other branches of physics. Pauling became <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>how</b> quantum mechanics might be applied in his chosen field of interest, the electronic structure of atoms and molecules. In Zürich, Pauling was also exposed {{to one of the}} first quantum mechanical analyses of bonding in the hydrogen molecule, done by Walter Heitler and Fritz London. Pauling devoted the two years of his European trip to this work and decided to make it the focus of his future research. He {{became one of the first}} scientists in the field of quantum chemistry and a pioneer in the application of quantum theory to the structure of molecules.|$|E
25|$|Christian writers after Eusebius are {{probably}} reliant on him, but include Pseudo-Justinus (3rd–5th century), Hesychius of Alexandria (5th century), Agathias (536–582), Moses of Chorene (8th century), an unknown geographer of unknown date, and the Suda (Byzantine dictionary from the 10th century). Thus, what little of Berossus remains is very fragmentary and indirect. The most direct source of material on Berossus is Josephus, received from Alexander Polyhistor. Most {{of the names}} in his king-lists {{and most of the}} potential narrative content have been lost or completely mangled as a result. Only Eusebius and Josephus preserve narrative material, and both had agendas. Eusebius was looking to construct a consistent chronology across different cultures, while Josephus was attempting to refute the charges that there was a civilization older than that of the Jews. However, the ten ante-diluvian kings were preserved by Christian apologists <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>how</b> the long lifespans of the kings were similar to the long lifespans of the ante-diluvian ancestors in the story of Genesis.|$|E
25|$|Richard Eisenbeis of Anime Now {{called the}} series his most {{anticipated}} anime of the season, being curious {{about how it}} would handle the adaptation of a branching story into a single one. Bamboo Dong, Paul Jensen, Rebecca Silverman and Theron Martin at Anime News Network reviewed episode 0 and 1 {{as part of a}} preview of that anime season. Dong did not expect the anime's ending to be good, but was still <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>how</b> the story would turn out, and appreciated the use of Chaos;Head-like visuals and atmosphere. Jensen did not, however, think the atmosphere worked, saying that it seemed like the show was intended to give a feeling of dread, but that it failed to do so, partially due to the large amount of information communicated to the viewer. Silverman thought episode 1, with the exception of some sequences, felt bland, but still worth watching for a few more episodes to get a grasp of what direction the story would take. Martin thought the story moved slightly too fast, resulting in some character motivations being weakly established. He enjoyed the visuals and music, but said that the character design, while attractive, looked unoriginal.|$|E
