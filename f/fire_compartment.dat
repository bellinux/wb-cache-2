The lateral spread for unchannelled plumes was found to be dependent upon the velocity of the flow from the <b>fire</b> <b>compartment</b> opening.

40|$|In the Netherlands, the {{building}} regulations have no design mies for large <b>fire</b> <b>compartments</b> (over 1000 m 2). With {{respect to the}} ability of people to escape from a fire in such large spaces, the Centre for Fire Research of TNO Building and Construction Research has developed a guideline that integrates the calculation of the available safe escape time (ASET) and the required safe escape time (RSET). The ASET is calculated using traditional zone models which were extended modelling several aspects relevant for large spaces, such as the cooling of smoke on ceiling and walls as well as the effects of unstratified smoke spread in the room. A calculation model for the RSET using the flow capacity of exits was extended by taking into account the travel distance inside large <b>fire</b> <b>compartments</b> and the moment people start to escape.

40|$|In {{large-scale}} compartment fires; {{combustion product}} yields vary with combustion conditions mainly {{in relation to}} the fuel:air equivalence ratio (Φ) and the effects of gas-phase flame retardants. Yields of products of inefficient combustion; including the major toxic products CO; HCN and organic irritants; increase considerably as combustion changes from well-ventilated (Φ < 1) to under-ventilated (Φ = 1 – 3). It is therefore essential that bench-scale toxicity tests reproduce this behaviour across the Φ range. Yield data from repeat <b>compartment</b> <b>fire</b> tests for any specific fuel show some variation on either side of a best-fit curve for CO yield as a function of Φ. In order to quantify the extent to which data from the steady state tube furnace (SSTF [1]; ISO TS 19700 [2]) represents <b>compartment</b> <b>fire</b> yields; the range and average deviations of SSTF data for CO yields from the <b>compartment</b> <b>fire</b> best-fit curve were compared to those for direct <b>compartment</b> <b>fire</b> measurements for six different polymeric fuels with textile and non-textile applications and for generic post-flashover fire CO yield data.

40|$|Current fire design {{models for}} time-temperature {{development}} within structural elements {{as well as}} for structural behaviour are based on isolated member tests subjected to standard fire regimes, which serve as a reference heating, but do not model natural fire.

40|$|The {{amendments}} to the Alberta Building Code 2006 addressing high-intensity residential fires include requirements for the minimum spacing between individual glazed openings located on the same exposing building face and within the same <b>fire</b> <b>compartment.</b> In situations where the limiting distance is not more than 2 m or the building is not sprinklered throughout, the Code now stipulates that individual glazed openings must be separated by a minimum of 2 m from one another when they are located within the same <b>fire</b> <b>compartment,</b> as provided in Sentence 9. 10. 15. 4. (4). The rationale behind not applying the 2 m separation requirement to two glazed openings within separate fire compartments is that the interior partitions that form the fire compartments provide an acceptable level {{of resistance to the}} spread of fire. Consequently, {{in the event of a}} fire, the glazed opening in the adjacent <b>fire</b> <b>compartment</b> will not contribute to the heat flux emanating from the exposing building face of the house until the interior partition is compromised and both fire compartments become engaged in the fire. A <b>fire</b> <b>compartment</b> is defined as a space in a building that is separated from the remainder of the building by a fire separation having a required fire-resistance rating. Floor assemblies in single-family dwellings, however, do not have a “required ” fireresistance rating, which would seemingly prohibit this type of separation from being considered as creating two separate fire compartments. This STANDATA has been developed to clarify whether a floor assembly can serve to create two separate fire compartments, thereby allowing glazed openings on opposing sides of the floor assembly to be spaced closer than 2 m apart...|$|E

40|$|A {{series of}} {{numerical}} modeling studies {{were conducted to}} characterize the mass flow rates in balcony spill plumes (BSP), a type of buoyant fire plume occurring in atria. The variation of BSP mass flow rate {{as a function of}} elevation, fire size and <b>fire</b> <b>compartment</b> geometry was examined both numerically and experimentally. A new method for estimation of BSP mass flow rates, appropriate for design of smoke management systems in high-elevation atria, was developed based on simulations of BSP mass flow rate. An experimental program conducted in a 12 m high atrium measured BSP mass flow rates as well as temperatures in the <b>fire</b> <b>compartment</b> and atrium. This data was used to evaluate CFD models of the <b>fire</b> <b>compartment</b> and atrium in the experimental facility. These were implemented using the Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS) software. The models were extended to investigate BSP behaviour at elevations up to 50 m. The removal of atrium walls in the model to allow free development of the BSP is a unique approach among published numerical modeling studies of BSP behaviour. The high-elevation CFD model was used to perform a parametric study of BSP mass flow rate as a function of elevation, fire size and <b>fire</b> <b>compartment</b> geometry. Predictions of BSP mass flow rate from this study extend to 50 m above the atrium floor, extending the range of elevations represented in the published experimental data (<= 9 m). Data from the parametric study was used to develop a new method for estimation of BSP mass flow rates at high elevations. BSP mass flow rates estimated using the new method are shown to be bounded by values estimated using existing methods based on low-elevation experimental data...|$|E
