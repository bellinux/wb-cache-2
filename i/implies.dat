40|$|Spatial {{attention}} can {{be directed}} {{by the actions of}} others. We used ERPs method to investigate the neural underpins associated with attention orienting which is induced by <b>implied</b> body action. Participants performed a standard non-predictive cuing task, in which a directional <b>implied</b> action (throwing and running) or non-action (standing) cue was randomly presented and then followed by a target to the left or right of the central cue, despite cue direction. The cue-triggered ERPs results demonstrated that <b>implied</b> action cues, rather than the non-action cue, could shift the observers&# 39; spatial attention as demonstrated by the robust anterior directing attention negativity (ADAN) effects in throwing and running cues. Further, earlier N 1 (100 - 170 ms) and P 2 (170 - 260 ms) waveform differences occurred between <b>implied</b> action and non-action cues over posterior electrodes. The P 2 component might reflect <b>implied</b> motion signal perception of <b>implied</b> action cues, and this <b>implied</b> motion perception might {{play an important role in}} facilitating the attentional shifts induced by <b>implied</b> action cues. Target-triggered ERPs data (mainly P 3 a component) indicated that <b>implied</b> action cues (throwing and running) speeded and enhanced the responses to valid targets compared to invalid targets. Furthermore, P 3 a might <b>imply</b> that <b>implied</b> action orienting may share similar mechanisms of action with voluntary attention, especially at the novel stimuli processing decision-level. These results further support previous behavioral findings that <b>implied</b> body actions direct spatial attention and extend our understanding about the nature of the attentional shifts that are elicited by <b>implied</b> action cues.

5|$|Cantor avoided paradoxes by {{recognizing}} {{that there are}} two types of multiplicities.

From 1901 to 1903, Russell discovered three paradoxes implying that his set theory is inconsistent: the Burali-Forti paradox (which was just mentioned), Cantor's paradox, and Russell's paradox.

5|$|In 1923, John von Neumann {{developed}} an axiom system that eliminates the paradoxes {{by using an}} approach similar to Cantor's—namely, by identifying collections that are not sets and treating them differently.

He defined a set as a class that is a member of some class and stated the axiom: A class is not a set if and only if there is a one-to-one correspondence between it and the class of all sets. This axiom <b>implies</b> that these big classes are not sets, which eliminates the paradoxes since they cannot be members of any class. Von Neumann also used his axiom to prove the well-ordering theorem: Like Cantor, he assumed that the ordinals form a set. The resulting contradiction <b>implies</b> that the class of all ordinals is not a set. Then his axiom provides a one-to-one correspondence between this class and the class of all sets. This correspondence well-orders the class of all sets, which <b>implies</b> the well-ordering theorem. In 1930, Zermelo defined models of set theory that satisfy von Neumann's axiom.|$|E
