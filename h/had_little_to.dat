Apart from the fact that his comic strip starred the same dog breed with a similar name it <b>had</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> do with the series overall, since the comic was a western comic.|$|E
5|$|Besides poets, at {{high school}} Lewis met Sophie Carson, who {{eventually}} became his wife. Klein, their mutual friend, introduced them. Carson came from a religious Jewish family. Her father did not approve of Lewis, {{because he was a}} recent immigrant to Canada, and in Carson's father's opinion <b>had</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> no possibility of success.|$|E

5|$|By {{the turn}} of the twentieth century the church <b>had</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> show from its earlier history, or indeed of its former wealth, beyond the great size of the church. The church was {{relatively}} plainly decorated – see below – and had nothing by way of old fittings, plate or vestments. Amongst its liturgical plate were a chalice of 1788, an alms plate of 1839, a set of chalice, paten and flagon of 1841, and a silver mounted glass cruet of 1909.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland Lakefront Station is an Amtrak {{train station}} at North Coast Harbor in Cleveland, Ohio. The station {{was built in}} 1977 to provide service to the Lake Shore Limited route, which was {{reinstated}} by Amtrak via Cleveland and Toledo in 1975. It replaced service to Cleveland Union Terminal. Lakefront Station is a modern station located in downtown Cleveland near the Lake Erie waterfront, adjacent to the Cleveland Memorial Shoreway and {{in the immediate vicinity}} of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, the Great Lakes Science Center, the Steamship William G. Mather Museum, and FirstEnergy Stadium. The station has <b>had</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> no renovation since its opening.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the early}} {{success of the}} series, three video games based on the series were {{released}} by Acclaim Entertainment. A first-person shooter simply titled South Park was released in 1998 for the PC, Nintendo 64, and PlayStation. This was followed in 1999 by , a party video game featuring quizzes and mini-games, on the Dreamcast, PlayStation, Nintendo 64, and PC. In 2000, South Park Rally, a racing game, was released on the Dreamcast, PlayStation, Nintendo 64, and PC. Parker and Stone <b>had</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> do {{with the development of}} these games, apart from providing voice acting, and have publicly criticized Acclaim {{and the quality of the}} South Park games they produced.|$|E

However, Karthik <b>had</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> do on his Caribbean sojourn, playing in only one non-first-class tour match ahead of the Tests.|$|E
5|$|Henry's son, John, {{inherited}} the castle in 1780, {{but when his}} son, also called John, inherited in 1816 he chose to live in London instead, opening up Dunster Castle to the public. By 1845 the castle appeared to visitors to be past its prime: with only two of John's sisters living there and no horses or hunting dogs left in the castle grounds, the remaining servants <b>had</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> do. John's brother Henry inherited in 1857, but he too lived in London rather than at Dunster.|$|E
5|$|In 1824 Mendelssohn studied {{under the}} {{composer}} and piano virtuoso Ignaz Moscheles, who confessed in his diaries that he <b>had</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> teach him. Moscheles became a close colleague and lifelong friend. The year 1827 saw the premiere– and sole performance in his lifetime– of Mendelssohn's opera, Die Hochzeit des Camacho. The failure of this production left him disinclined {{to venture into}} the genre again.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, {{and again}} in 2008, the Mekong River flooded its banks, {{damaging}} hundreds of rural villages. Living River Siam joined with other NGOs to form the Thai People's Network for Mekong, which pointed to dams in China as {{the primary cause of}} the flooding. An intergovernmental working group called the Mekong River Commission opposed these claims, saying China's dams <b>had</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> do with the flood, although they also pressed China for data on the floodwaters. The back-and-forth was covered heavily in Thai press, which gave ample space to the statements of the People's Network.|$|E
5|$|In {{the meeting}} Tecumseh warned Harrison {{that he would}} seek an {{alliance}} with the British if hostilities broke out. Tensions between the United States and Britain had been high for several months {{as a result of}} British interference in U.S. commerce with France. As early as 1810, British agents had sought to secure an alliance with Native Americans to assist in the defense of Canada should hostilities break out, but the Natives had been reluctant to accept their offer, fearing they <b>had</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> benefit from such an arrangement.|$|E
5|$|Kentucky's {{citizens}} were split regarding the issues {{central to the}} Civil War. The state had strong economic ties with Ohio River cities such as Pittsburgh and Cincinnati {{while at the same}} time sharing many cultural, social, and economic links with the South. Unionist traditions were strong throughout the Commonwealth's history, especially in the east. With economic ties to both the North and the South, Kentucky <b>had</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> gain and much to lose from a war between the states. Additionally, many slaveholders felt that the best protection for slavery was within the Union.|$|E

5|$|Kinman {{claimed to}} have {{migrated}} to California in 1849 during the great Gold Rush {{and worked as a}} prospector in Pierson B. Reading's party on the Trinity River near present day Douglas City. He then returned to Illinois for two years. In 1852, he travelled to California and explored the Humboldt Bay area, near present day Eureka, California. Humboldt Bay had been recently rediscovered by gold miners seeking a faster and cheaper route to transport supplies. An early settlement in the area was also named Uniontown, but is now known as Arcata. During this period, prospectors and their suppliers were often flush with gold, but <b>had</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> spend it on.|$|E
5|$|The MCC {{match was}} {{followed}} by Australia's first non-victory of the tour, which against Lancashire. Johnson <b>had</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> do in the match.

He took 0/16 from eight overs in the first innings and neither batted nor bowled in the second innings as the match ended in a draw.|$|E
5|$|The average Soviet soldier {{suffered}} from inexperience. With the Soviet debacle {{of the previous}} year ameliorated only by the barest victory at Moscow, most of the original manpower of the Red Army had been killed, wounded or captured by the Germans, with casualties of almost 1,000,000 just from the Battle of Moscow. The typical soldier in the Red Army was a conscript and <b>had</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> no combat experience, and tactical training was practically nonexistent. Coupled with the lack of trained soldiers, the Red Army also began to suffer from the loss of Soviet industrial areas, and a temporary strategic defense was considered necessary.|$|E

5|$|Thus {{the natives}} gave overt clues {{that they were}} displeased with the {{settlement}} being formed there. The property had supposedly been secured by {{an agent of the}} Dutch West India Company in 1640, but the negotiation was transacted with members of the Siwanoy people in distant Norwalk, and the local natives likely <b>had</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> do with that transaction, if they even knew of it at all. Hutchinson was therefore taking a considerable risk in putting a permanent dwelling at this site.|$|E
5|$|Willson's {{interventions}} ultimately <b>had</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> do {{with the}} end of the violence. In 1908, the courts began handing down convictions against the Night Riders, though many of their leaders escaped the convictions. A 1909 measure sponsored by Kentucky representative Augustus O. Stanley removed a national tax on tobacco, and in 1911, the Supreme Court of the United States found the American Tobacco Company to be in violation of antitrust laws. Each of these events helped raise tobacco prices, pacifying the violent farmers.|$|E
5|$|A {{council of}} the army convened in Babylon {{immediately}} after Alexander's death, naming PhilipIII as king and the chiliarch Perdiccas as his regent. Antipater, Antigonus Monophthalmus, Craterus, and Ptolemy formed a coalition against Perdiccas {{in a civil war}} initiated by Ptolemy's seizure of the hearse of Alexander the Great. Perdiccas was assassinated in 321BC by his own officers during a failed campaign in Egypt against Ptolemy, where his march along the Nile River resulted in the drowning of 2,000 of his men. Although Eumenes of Cardia managed to kill Craterus in battle, this <b>had</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> no effect on the outcome of the 321BC Partition of Triparadisus in Syria where the victorious coalition settled the issue of a new regency and territorial rights. Antipater was appointed as regent over the two kings. Before Antipater died in 319BC, he named the staunch Argead loyalist Polyperchon as his successor, passing over his own son Cassander and ignoring the right of the king to choose a new regent (since PhilipIII was considered mentally unstable), in effect bypassing the {{council of the}} army as well.|$|E
