5000|$|Copolymers of pHEMA {{are still}} widely used today. Poly-HEMA {{functions}} as a hydrogel by rotating around its central carbon. In air, the non-polar methyl side turns outward, making the material brittle and easy to grind into the correct lens shape. In water, the polar hydroxyethyl side turns outward and the material becomes flexible. Pure pHEMA yields lenses that are too thick for sufficient oxygen to diffuse through, so all contact lenses that are pHEMA based are manufactured with copolymers that make the gel thinner and increase its water of hydration. These copolymer hydrogel lenses are often suffixed [...] "-filcon", such as Methafilcon, which is a copolymer of <b>hydroxyethyl</b> <b>methacrylate</b> and methyl methacrylate.

40|$|Standard {{methods of}} contact angle {{analysis}} include sessile drop, captive bubble and Wilhelmy plate techniques; however, these methodologies {{are not particularly}} well suited for assessing the wettability of the surfaces of formed hydrogel contact lenses. This paper describes two methodologies that are adaptations of previously described techniques. The maximum adherent force method is an adaptation of the dynamic Wilhelmy plate technique that allows the assessment of whole, finished contact lenses. The dynamic photographic method allows the simultaneous assessment of {{the front and back}} surfaces of strip samples for the assessment of advancing and receding contact angles. Lenses investigated were made from polyhydroxyethyl <b>methacrylate,</b> <b>hydroxyethyl</b> methacrylate/methacrylic acid and <b>hydroxyethyl</b> methacrylate/glycerol <b>methacrylate.</b> The lenses were manufactured by lathing, spin-casting or cast-moulding techniques. Overall, both techniques demonstrated few differences between the wettability of different lens materials and no differences between materials of the 'same' lens type but manufactured by different methods. These findings are consistent with the results of clinical studies, which have shown little difference between contact lens surface wettability in vivo, which {{may be due to the}} apparent natural surface wettability-enhancing properties of the pre-lens tear film...|$|R

Here, we {{analyzed}} the in vitro release of FITC-anti-human antibodies incorporated in either HES-P(EG) (6) MA or HES-MA hydrogel delivery systems in PBS or human serum. In addition, hydrogel disks and microparticles prepared from the two polymers were subcutaneously implanted in BALB/c mice. The in vivo release of FITC-IgG was non-invasively monitored by an in vivo imaging system (IVIS 200) over a time period of up to 3 months. The imaging system allowed to asses individual animals over time, therefore {{only a small number of}} animals was required to obtain high quality data. The reduction in fluorescence intensity at the site of administration was compared to in vitro release profiles. These investigations demonstrated a sustained release from HES-MA hydrogel disks compared to rapidly degrading HES-P(EG) (6) MA disks and microparticles. The sustained release from HES-MA disks could be further optimized by using increased polymer concentrations. Human serum as in vitro release medium reflected better the in vivo release from HES-P(EG) (6) MA systems than PBS, suggesting that the presence of organic substances like proteins or lipids may play a significant role for the release kinetics...|$|R

The {{purpose of this}} laboratory and finite element analysis {{study was to investigate}} the effects on the formation of a hybrid layer of an experimental silane coupling agent containing primer solutions composed of different percentages of <b>hydroxyethyl</b> <b>methacrylate.</b> Material and methods. A total of 125 sound human premolars were restored in vitro. Simple class I cavities were formed on each tooth, followed by the application of different compositions of experimental silane primers (0 %, 5 %, 25 %, and 50 % of <b>hydroxyethyl</b> <b>methacrylate),</b> bonding agents, and dental composite resins. Bond strength tests and scanning electron microscopy analyses were performed. The laboratory experimental results were validated with finite element analysis to determine the pattern of stress distribution. Simulations were conducted by placing the restorative composite resin in a premolar tooth by imitating simple class I cavities. The laboratory and finite element analysis data were significantly different from each other, as determined by 1 -way ANOVA. A post hoc analysis was conducted on the bond strength data to further clarify the effects of silane primers. Results. The strongest bond of hybrid layer (16. 96 MPa) was found in the primer with 25 % <b>hydroxyethyl</b> <b>methacrylate,</b> suggesting a barely visible hybrid layer barrier. The control specimens without the application of the primer and the primer specimens with no <b>hydroxyethyl</b> <b>methacrylate</b> exhibited the lowest strength values (8. 30 MPa and 11. 78 MPa) with intermittent and low visibility of the hybrid layer.

Further, membranes can be engineered to present surface proteins such as albumin, antigens, Na/K-ATPase carriers, or pores such as ion channels.Commonly used materials {{for the production of}} membranes include hydrogel polymers such as alginate, cellulose and thermoplastic polymers such as <b>hydroxyethyl</b> methacrylate-methyl <b>methacrylate</b> (HEMA- MMA), polyacrylonitrile-polyvinyl chloride (PAN-PVC), as well as variations of the above-mentioned. The material used determines the permeability of the cell membrane, which for polymer depends on the molecular weight cut off (MWCO). The MWCO is the maximum molecular weight of a molecule that may freely pass through the pores and is important in determining adequate diffusion of nutrients, waste and other critical molecules.Hydrophilic polymers have the potential to be biocompatible and can be fabricated into a variety of forms which include polymer micelles, sol-gel mixtures, physical blends and crosslinked particles and nanoparticles. Of special interest are stimuli-responsive polymers that respond to pH or temperature changes for the use in targeted delivery. These polymers may be administered in the liquid form through a macroscopic injection and solidify or gel in situ because of the difference in pH or temperature. Nanoparticle and liposome preparations are also routinely used for material encapsulation and delivery. A major advantage of liposomes is their ability to fuse to cell and organelle membranes.|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{establish}} the clinical impact {{of three different}} methods of manufacture used to produce soft contact lenses. METHODS: Clinical performance of five lens types was investigated by undertaking a prospective, double-masked, randomized, crossover study. Three of the lenses were made from poly(hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (pHEMA) by three different manufacturing processes (lathing, spin casting, and cast molding), and the remaining two lenses were cast molded from different materials-hydroxyethyl methacrylate/methacrylic acid and <b>hydroxyethyl</b> methacrylate/glycerol <b>methacrylate</b> (HEMA/GMA). All lenses were specially fabricated for this work at the same manufacturing plant. Thirty-four soft contact lens wearers wore each lens for 1 month on a daily-wear basis. Several clinical variables, such as ocular response, visual acuity, lens fitting, prelens tear film, lens surface dehydration, subjective response, and protein deposition, were measured. RESULTS: In general, the spun-cast pHEMA lens performed inferiorly compared with the other pHEMA lenses. This lens induced significantly more limbal and conjunctival hyperemia than the cast-molded lens and provided poorer low contrast visual acuity (LCVA) {{than the other two}} lenses. It dehydrated more and had the least on-eye movement. However, the spun-cast lens deposited the least protein of the pHEMA lenses. In general, the HEMA/GMA lens performed inferiorly compared with the other cast-molded lenses. LCVA was worse with this lens, and subjective responses showed that this lens was thought to give the worst visual performance of the cast-molded lenses. It was also thought to be the most difficult lens to handle. Significantly more breakages occurred with this lens than any other. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, this work has shown that manufacturing method and material composition have a fundamental effect on many clinical properties of a lens. Therefore, method of manufacture is also an important consideration in the overall production of a soft lens...|$|R
40|$|Wässrige Zweiphasensysteme (aqueous two phase system = ATPS) werden in den letzten Jahren häufig als sehr effiziente Methode zur Herstellung proteinbeladener Hydrogel-Mikropartikel genutzt, wobei die Herstellung in einem rein wässrigen Milieu erfolgt. Die Verteilung von Proteinen und anderer Substanzen wird dabei durch deren physikochemische Eigenschaften und Wechselwirkungen mit den Bestandteilen des ATPS, insbesondere durch die Polarität der Polymere, beeinflusst. In dieser Arbeit wurde ein Zweiphasensystem untersucht, das aus Hydroxyethylstärke (HES), Polyethylenglykol (PEG) und Wasser besteht. Dabei lag das Hauptaugenmerk auf der Untersuchung der Verteilung von Lysozym als Modellprotein und den Kryoprotektoren Saccharose, Glycin und Trehalose in beiden Phasen des Zweiphasensystems und deren gegenseitigen Beeinflussung. Dabei konnte gezeigt werden, dass mit steigender Konzentration an Kryoprotektoren sowohl der Dichtekoeffizient (Quotient aus der Dichte der PEG-Phase und der Dichte der HES-Phase) als auch der Trocknungsrückstandskoeffizient (Quotient aus dem Trocknungsrückstand der PEG-Phase und dem Trocknungsrückstand der HES-Phase) anstiegen. Allerdings blieb der durch Radioaktivitätsmessungen bestimmte Verteilungskoeffizient der Kryoprotektoren (VK = Quotient der Konzentration des Kryoprotektors in der PEG-Phase und des Konzentration des Kryoprotektors in der HES-Phase) im untersuchten Konzentrationsbereich konstant: während sich Saccharose und Trehalose leicht in der PEG-Phase anreicherten (VK> 1), verteilte sich Glycin in beiden Phasen gleich (VK= 1). Die Verteilungskoeffizienten wurden dabei weder durch die Konzentration der Kryoprotektoren noch durch den Zusatz von Lysozym beeinflusst. Weiterhin wurde die Verteilung von Lysozym im Zweiphasensystem sowohl mit Hilfe der Fluorimetrie als auch mit Hilfe eines lysozymspezifischen ELISAs bestimmt. Bei beiden Methoden zeigte sich im saccharosefreien System eine Anreicherung von Lysozym um das 60 -fache in der HES-Phase und eine Anreicherung im saccharosehaltigen System um das 30 - bis 40 -fache in der HES-Phase im Vergleich zur PEG-Phase, unabhängig vom Saccharosegehalt. Auf der Grundlage dieses Zweiphasensystems wurden Mikropartikel hergestellt und charakterisiert. Dazu wurde das Zweiphasensystem dahingehend modifiziert, dass ein Derivat von HES {{verwendet}} wurde, das quervernetzbare Hydroxyethylmethacrylat-Seitenketten (HES-HEMA = Hydroxyetyhlstärke-Hydroxyethylmethacrylat) enthält. Von den durch eine radikalische Polymerisationsreaktion hergestellten Mikropartikeln, in die 0, 5, 10 oder 15 % Saccharose eingebettet wurden, wurden die Morphologie und die Partikelgröße bestimmt sowie die Einschlussrate und die Freisetzungscharakteristika der verwendeten Modell-Wirkstoffe Lysozym und FITC-Dextran untersucht. Dabei waren der Einfluss des Substitutionsgrades von HES-HEMA, d. h. der Netzwerkmaschenweite der Hydrogel-Mikropartikel, und des Saccharosegehaltes von besonderem Interesse. Aus der Herstellung resultierten runde, glatte Mikropartikel mit einer mittleren Teilchengröße von 10 - 15 µm. Die Freisetzungsuntersuchungen der Modell-Wirkstoffe FITC-Dextran und Lysozym zeigten eine Abhängigkeit der Freisetzungsgeschwindigkeit vom Substitutionsgrad des Hydrogelnetzwerkes und dem Freisetzungsmedium. Die Freisetzungskinetik hingegen wurde nur vom Freisetzungsmedium beeinflusst. Der Saccharosegehalt der Mikropartikel hatte weder einen Einfluss auf die Freisetzungsgeschwindigkeit noch auf die Freisetzungskinetik. Partitioning {{of proteins}} in aqueous two-phase systems (ATPS) {{has been shown}} to provide a powerful method for preparing protein-loaded hydrogel microparticles from an all aqueous process. There are many factors known which affect partitioning of therapeutic proteins in ATPS. The value of the partition coefficient relies on the physico-chemical properties of protein drug and other molecules present and their interactions with those of the chosen ATPS, e. g. the polarity of the “incompatible” polymers. In this work, ATPS consisting of hydroxyethyl starch (HES), polyethylene glycol and water were used. We investigated the partitioning of lysozyme as a model protein and sucrose, glycine and trehalose as cryo-protectants in both phases of the ATPS and in particular their mutual interaction. It was shown that with increasing concentrations of cryo-protectants in the ATPS both the density ratio (density of the PEG phase divided by density of the HES phase) and the drying residue ration (drying residue of the PEG phase divided by drying residue of the HES phase) increased. However, the partition coefficient kcryo-protectant (concentration of the cryo-protectant in the PEG phase devided by the concentration of the cryo-protectant in the HES phase), determined by measuring the concentration of radio-labelled cryo-protectants in both phases, remains constant over the investigated concentration range. Moreover it could be shown that sucrose and trehalose accumulate slightly in the PEG-phase. Partition does neither depend on concentration nor is it affected by the addition of lysozyme. Glycine distributes almost homogenously in both phases, which is also independent from its concentration and added lysozyme. The partition coefficient of lysozyme as a model protein was determined using fluorimetry and ELISA for quantitative measurements of the protein. Furthermore, the influence of sucrose on its partition behaviour was determined. Without sucrose lysozyme accumulated approx. 60 -fold in the HES phase. Accumulation in the HES phase was reduced upon addition of sucrose leading to lysozyme concentrations in the HES phase which were 30 - to 40 -fold higher than in the PEG phase. On the basis of this ATPS microparticles were prepared by means of a radical polymerisation. For this purpose a modified ATPS was used, consisting of <b>hydroxyethyl</b> starch-hydroxyethyl <b>methacrylate</b> (HES-HEMA), PEG and water. Microparticles were prepared in the presence of 0, 5, 10, or 15 % sucrose, respectively. The resulting microparticles were characterized with respect to morphology, particle size, and encapsulation efficiency of lysozyme and FITC-dextran which were used as model drugs. Moreover, release rate and release kinetic from the hydrogel microparticles were studied in dependence from the degree of substitution of HES-HEMA and the sucrose content. The obtained microparticles showed a narrow particle size distribution with an average particle size of 10 - 15 µm. The release rate of the model drugs was strongly affected by the degree of substitution and the release medium, but not by the sucrose content. In contrast, the release kinetic was affected only by the release medium, but not by the degree of substitution and the sucrose content...|$|R

The copolymerization kinetics of HEMA with ST is quite {{similar to that of}} glycidyl methacrylate (GMA) with ST. A computational study based on quantum chemistry supports the finding that GMA and HEMA are more reactive toward ST radicals compared to alkyl methacrylates...|$|E
40|$|The Buss-Kneader is {{generally}} {{known as a}} compounding device. Although a reasonable number of papers have been published on extruders as polymerization reactors, only {{little is known about}} the behavior of the Buss-Kneader when used as a polymerization reactor. Its good mixing properties in the radial and axial directions make it a suitable reactor for exothermal polymerization reactions. This paper describes experiments with the co-polymerization of n-butyl acrylate and <b>hydroxyethyl</b> <b>methacrylate</b> in a Buss-Kneader. For model calculations the Buss-Kneader was treated as a plug flow reactor with axial dispersion. Experimental results on axial temperature profile, monomer conversion and molecular weght are compared with model calculations. Model parameters are based on independently measured data on the heat transfer coefficient, axial dispersion and polymerization kinetics. ...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY: This paper {{describes}} a versatile and effective method {{for the control}} of free radical polymerization and its use {{in the preparation of}} narrow polydispersity polymers of various architectures. Living character is conferred to conventional free radical polymerization by the addition of a thiocarbonylthio compound of general structure S=C(Z) SR, for example, S=C(Ph) SC(CH 3) 2 Ph. The mechanism involves Reversible Addition-Fragmentation chain Transfer and, for convenience of referral, we have designated it the RAFT polymerization. The process is compatible with a very wide range of monomers including functional monomers such as acrylic acid, <b>hydroxyethyl</b> <b>methacrylate,</b> and dimethy laminoethyl methacrylate. Examples of narrow polydispersity (51. 2) homopolymers, copolymers, gradient copolymers, end-functional polymers, star polymers, A-B diblock and A-B-A triblock copolymers are presented...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} 3 months of daily soft contact lenswear on corneal topography. Thirty young myopic subjects who had not previously worn contact lenses were fitted with <b>hydroxyethyl</b> <b>methacrylate</b> (HEMA) soft lenses. Corneal topography was measured in each eye {{before and after the}} 3 -month period using a videokeratoscope, the Topographic Modeling System (TMS). For each TMS image, we recorded the local radius of curvature at points approximately 1, 2, 3, and 4 mm along the four principal meridians. Following 3 months of soft lens wear, there was a significant steepening of the cornea in all meridians. This steepening was most pronounced in the peripheral cornea, averaging 0. 09 ± 0. 13 mm (i. e., about 0. 50 ± 0. 75 D) at 4 mm {{from the center of the}} cornea...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: A complex {{deposition}} {{procedure of}} the hydrogel layer of modified poly(2 <b>hydroxyethyl</b> <b>methacrylate)</b> (polyHEMA) covalently {{linked to the}} silicon nitride surface and covering only the gate area of the ISFET, was optimized for photolithographic technology, using standard silicon wafers of 3 ” diameter. The influence of hydrogel composition and layer thickness on the sensors ’ parameters was investigated. It was shown, that ISFETs covered with more than 100 µm thick polyHEMA layers in restricted pH-range could be practically insensitive to pH. Regarding mechanical stability of ion-selective sensors, a polyHEMA layer of ca. 20 µm thickness {{was found to be}} the best suitable for further manufacturing of durable ion selective sensors (Chemically modified Field-Effect Transistors – ChemFETs). The weak buffering properties of the thin polyHEMA layers had no disadvantageous influence on the sensors ’ function...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the stress analysis in optical fiber due to swelling of hydrogel material coated on it. The silica optical fiber {{was assumed to}} be coated by hydrogel that consists of <b>hydroxyethyl</b> <b>methacrylate,</b> acrylic acid and ethylene glycol dimethacrylate as crosslinker. The hydrogel swelling was modeled using free energy function. The conditional equilibrium of hydrogel was solved using finite element method and the stress induced in optical fiber was simulated simultaneously. The simulations were done for two hydrogel coating thickness values, 30 µm and 40 µm. Etched optical fiber coated by 40 µm hydrogel was also simulated. The results show that maximum stress in optical fiber is higher for thicker hydrogel thickness and is higher for etched optical fiber. Maximum stress magnitudes at all pH values are below tensile strength of optical fiber...|$|E
