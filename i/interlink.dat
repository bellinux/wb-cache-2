40|$|AbstractMutual {{inhibitory}} {{positive feedback}} (MIPF), or double-negative feedback, {{is a key}} regulatory motif of cellular memory with the capability of maintaining switched states for transient stimuli. Such MIPFs are found in various biological systems where they are <b>interlinked</b> in many cases despite a single MIPF can still realize such a memory effect. An intriguing question then arises about the advantage of <b>interlinking</b> MIPFs instead of exploiting an isolated single MIPF to realize the memory effect. We have investigated the advantages of <b>interlinked</b> MIPF systems through mathematical modeling and computer simulations. Our results revealed that <b>interlinking</b> MIPFs expands the parameter range of achieving the memory effect, or the memory region, thereby making the system more robust to parameter perturbations. Moreover, the minimal duration and amplitude of an external stimulus required for off-to-on state transition are increased and, as a result, external noises can more effectively be filtered out. Hence, <b>interlinked</b> MIPF systems can realize more robust cellular memories with respect to both parameter perturbations and external noises. Our study suggests that <b>interlinked</b> MIPF systems might be an evolutionary consequence acquired for a more reliable memory effect by enhancing robustness against noisy cellular environments...|$|R

It had two large, curved bastions containing chambers {{on the west}} and east ends, and a three-storey rectangular keep in the middle, [...] across, set within an inner courtyard. The outer wall was [...] thick and contained a gallery and ports for hand-guns, and supported two tiers of artillery. A moat ran around {{the outside of the}} castle. The two-storey tall blockhouses were also built from brick and stone, and each had a square central tower and entrance at the rear, and three curved bastions to the front and sides. Their walls were [...] thick, sloped so as to deflect incoming fire, and supported two tiers of guns; the interiors were partitioned, {{to reduce the risk of}} explosions damaging the entire fortification. The use of bastions adopted some features from the Italian-style of defences then popular on the continent, but their design was imperfect and failed to provide flanking cover or <b>interlink</b> with the neighbouring defences. A crenellated curtain wall, approximately [...] long and [...] high, linked the blockhouses and castle, with a wet moat on the eastward side.|$|E
