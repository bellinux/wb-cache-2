40|$|Water is a {{demanding}} partner. It strongly attracts ions, yet some halide anions—chloride, bromide, and iodide—are expelled to the air/water interface. This {{has important implications}} for chemistry in the atmosphere, including the ozone cycle. We present a quantitative analysis of the energetics of ion solvation based on molecular simulations of all stable alkali and halide ions in water droplets. The potentials of mean force for Cl-, Br-, and I- have shallow minima near the surface. We demonstrate that these minima derive from more favorable water–water interaction energy when the ions are partially desolvated. Alkali cations are on the inside because of the favorable ion–water energy, whereas F- is driven inside by entropy. Models attempting to explain the surface preference based on one or more ion properties such as polarizability or size are shown to lead to qualitative and quantitative <b>errors,</b> <b>prompting</b> a paradigm shift in chemistry away from such simplifications...|$|R

The care responsi-bility for the patient is frequently handed over between healthcare professionals, and during this process vital in-formation may be lost, resulting in patient-experienced fragmentations of care, mistakes, oversights [2], and sys-tematic <b>errors,</b> <b>prompting</b> wasted time and resources [3]. Consequently, patients might feel left in limbo, which can represent a barrier to the feeling of safety and wellbeing [4 - 6]. A handover is defined as “A situation in which the responsibility for a patient’s diagnosis, treatment, and care is transferred fully or partly, temporarily or permanently from one healthcare professional to another ” [3]. Inadvert-ent events occurring during handovers may be related to lack of information, miscommunication, unclear care responsibility, or inadequate organisational framework [3, 7, 8].

The application scaffolds the construction of programs on a mobile device by: (i) representing a program in parts; (ii) restricting a learner to complete the program in a certain order; (iii) enabling construction of a program one part at a time; (iv) providing instructions, steps, default code to be edited, hints, and <b>error</b> <b>prompts</b> where appropriate; and (v) fading the scaffolds as the learner progresses from one successfully completed and compiled program, to the next.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the functional deficits that predict particular types of driving difficulties among older drivers. A sample of 90 drivers 60 years and older completed a battery of functional (psychological, visual, physical, cognitive, and attentional) tests and a standardized on-road driving test. Driving errors were classified into a set of 7 distinct categories (positioning, gap selection, incorrect speed, observation, speed of approach, mirror, and indicator), and correlation and regression analyses were used to determine the best functional predictors of specific error types. As expected, functional deficits were more strongly related to some error types (eg, positioning errors) than others (eg, failure to indicate). Measures of visual attention were associated with a broad range of error types, and particularly, with <b>errors</b> <b>prompting</b> an intervention from the driving instructor, suggesting that a deficit in visual attention is a key indicator of the likelihood of driving problems.

While all of these instrumental studies suggest that errors are not, as previously thought, necessarily a matter of all-or-none, it is unclear what implications these studies have for phonological encoding as a cognitive process. Due to their repetition based design, the ill-formed errors obtained in these studies may be articulation errors rather than cognitive planning errors. The present study reports for the first time tongue movement data collected during an error elicitation study based on the SLIP technique, which has traditionally been hypothesized to elicit errors at the phonological planning level. Results indicate that tongue kinematics during errors in the present task are comparable to those found in errorful utterances in repetition tasks.

40|$|BackgroundThe {{unique and}} complex {{vascular}} and endovascular theatre environment {{is associated with}} significant risks of patient harm and procedural inefficiency. Accurate evaluation is crucial to improve quality. This pilot study attempted to design a valid, reproducible tool for observers and teams to identify and categorise errors. MethodsRelevant published literature and previously collected ethnographic field notes from over 250  h of arterial surgery were analysed. A comprehensive log of vascular procedural errors was compiled and twelve vascular experts graded each error for the potential to disrupt procedural flow and cause harm. Using this multimodal approach, the Imperial College Error CAPture (ICECAP) tool was developed. The tool was validated during 21 consecutive arterial cases (52  h operating-time) as an observer-led error capture record and as a prompt for surgical teams to determine the feasibility of error self-reporting. ResultsSix primary categories (communication, equipment, procedure independent pressures, technical, safety awareness and patient related) and 20 error sub-categories were determined as the most frequent and important vascular procedural errors. Using the ICECAP, the number of errors detected correlated well between two observers (Spearman rho =  0. 984, p <  0. 001). Both observers identified all moderate or severe errors similarly and categorised all but 4 / 139 (2. 9 %) of the total errors in an identical fashion. Self-reporting of <b>errors</b> without <b>prompting</b> identified a mean of 24. 4 % (range 0 – 50 %) of all recorded errors, whereas surgical teams reported a mean of 69. 7 % (range 50 – 100 %) of errors when ICECAP error-category prompts were used. ConclusionThe ICECAP tool may be useful for capturing and categorising errors that occur during vascular/endovascular procedures. ICECAP may also have a role as an <b>error</b> recall <b>prompt</b> for self-reporting purposes by vascular surgical teams...|$|R

40|$|The {{apparent}} transfer velocities (k(w)) of CH 4, N 2 O, and SF 6 {{were determined}} for gas invasion and evasion {{in a closed}} laboratory exchange tank. Tank water (pure Milli-RO(R) water or artificial seawater prepared in Milli-RO(R)) and/or tank air gas compositions were adjusted, with monitoring of subsequent gas transfer by gas chromatography. Derived k(w) was converted to "apparent k(600),'' the value for CO 2 in freshwater at 20 degreesC. For CH 4, analytical constraints precluded estimating apparent k(600) based on tank air measurements. In some experiments we added strains of live methanotrophs. In others we added chemically deactivated methanotrophs, non-CH 4 oxidizers (Vibrio), or bacterially associated surfactants, as controls. For all individual controls, apparent k(600) estimated from CH 4, N 2 O, or SF 6 was indistinguishable. However, invasive estimates always exceeded evasive estimates, implying some control of gas invasion by bubbles. Estimates of apparent k(600) differed significantly between methanotroph strains, possibly reflecting species-specific surfactant release. For individual strains during gas invasion, apparent k(600) estimated from CH 4, N 2 O, or SF 6 was indistinguishable, whereas during gas evasion, k(600) -CH 4 {{was significantly higher than}} either k(600) -N 2 O or k(600) -SF 6, which were identical. Hence evasive k(600) -CH 4 /k(600) -SF 6 was always significantly above unity, whereas invasive k(600) -CH 4 /k(600) -SF 6 was not significantly different from unity. Similarly, k(600) -CH 4 /k(600) -SF 6 for the controls and k(600) -N 2 O/k(600) -SF 6 for all experiments did not differ significantly from unity. Our results are consistent with active metabolic control of CH 4 exchange by added methanotrophs in the tank microlayer, giving enhancements of similar to 12 +/- 10 % for k(600) -CH 4.
