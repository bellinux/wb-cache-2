2500|$|It is essential, {{according}} to Dewey, that {{the classroom teacher}} has the mental propensity to overcome the demands and stressors placed on her because the students can sense when their teacher is not genuinely invested in promoting their learning (Dewey, PST, 2010). [...] Such negative demeanors, {{according to}} Dewey, prevent children from pursuing their own propensities for learning and intellectual growth. [...] It can therefore be assumed that <b>if</b> <b>teachers</b> want their students to engage with the educational process and employ their natural curiosities for knowledge, teachers {{must be aware of}} how their reactions to young children and the stresses of teaching influence this process.|$|E
2500|$|For many, education’s {{purpose is}} to train {{students}} for work by providing the student with a limited set of skills and information to do a particular job. [...] As Dewey notes, this limited vocational view is also applied to teacher training schools who attempt to quickly produce proficient and practical teachers with a limited set of instructional and discipline skills needed {{to meet the needs}} of the employer and demands of the workforce (Dewey, 1904). [...] For Dewey, the school and the classroom teacher, as a workforce and provider of a social service, have a unique responsibility to produce psychological and social goods that will lead to both present and future social progress. [...] As Dewey notes, [...] "The business of the teacher is to produce a higher standard of intelligence in the community, and the object of the public school system is to make as large as possible the number of those who possess this intelligence. [...] Skill, ability to act wisely and effectively in a great variety of occupations and situations, is a sign and a criterion of the degree of civilization that a society has reached. [...] It is the business of teachers to help in producing the many kinds of skill needed in contemporary life. [...] <b>If</b> <b>teachers</b> are up to their work, they also aid in production of character(Dewey, TAP, 2010, pp. 241–42).|$|E

2500|$|The {{spread of}} Konglish in the Korean {{language}} {{has been cited}} {{as a reason to}} increase Koreans' exposure to native English speakers, especially during their educational time. Koreans instructing others can lead to cementing errors into the language. Poor planning in the education system can result in unqualified Korean teachers being chosen to teach English with little or no time to prepare. These teachers end up using Konglish in the classroom. Even teachers who prepare may end up using official materials that contain numerous errors and Konglish. This can create a feeling of passiveness towards learning structurally and technically correct English. Students look to teachers as the example and <b>if</b> <b>teachers</b> are making mistakes, these are passed on to them. The issue of bad Konglish has been raised in relation to tourism. There is a concern that poor English on signs, brochures, websites, or in other media might cause tourists to find another destination. This is a concern not just in small or remote venues, but even major international locations like Incheon Airport. When the airport was first opened for business more than 49 signs were found to contain English errors. In addition to keeping away tourists, Konglish usage can lead to the breakdown of business deals. Misunderstandings might lead a foreign business partner to lose confidence in a Korean company. In 2010, a poll showed that 44% of local governments in South Korea used an English phrase in their marketing slogan. The slogans at the time included: Lucky Dongjak, Dynamic Busan, Yes Gumi, Colorful Daegu, Ulsan for You, Happy Suwon, New Start! Yesan, Super Pyeongtaek, [...] Hi-Touch Gongju, Nice Jecheon and Just Sangju.|$|E
60|$|<b>If</b> <b>teachers</b> do universally confine {{themselves}} to limits, which I have been attempting to define, they may accomplish within these limits, {{a vast amount}} of good. By attempting however, to exceed them, the confidence of parents is destroyed or weakened, and the door is closed. In this way, injury to a very great extent has been done in many parts of our country. Parents are led to associate with the very idea of religion, indirect and perhaps secret efforts to influence their children, in a way which they themselves would disapprove. They transfer to the cause of piety itself, the dislike which was first awakened by exceptionable means to promote it; and other teachers, seeing these evil effects, are deterred from attempting what they might easily and pleasantly accomplish. Before therefore, attempting to enforce the duty, and to explain the methods of exerting religious influence in school, I thought proper, distinctly to state, with what restrictions, and within what limits, the work is to be done.|$|E

If people would but leave children to themselves; <b>if</b> <b>teachers</b> would cease to bully them; if parents would not insist upon directing their thoughts, and dominating their feelings--those feelings and thoughts which are a mystery to all (for how much do you and I know of each other, of our children, of our fathers, of our neighbour, and how far more beautiful and sacred are the thoughts of the poor lad or girl whom you govern likely to be, than those of the dull and world-corrupted person who rules him?)--if, I say, parents and masters would leave their children alone a little more, small harm would accrue, although a less quantity of as in praesenti might be acquired.|$|E

50|$|There {{is also an}} {{alternative}} version of how competition amongst children can be affected by escalation archetype. When all parents motivate children to improve in comparison to their peers, they will all study harder and harder while the differences amongst participating kids will remain relatively stable (and <b>if</b> <b>teachers</b> increase requirements they will even retain their marks). Under such simple circumstances most children might benefit from the competition nevertheless children with weaker intellectual skill may become isolated when {{they are no longer}} able to pursue others.

For Augustine, education is best understood as a relationship of love, where teacher and learner function in a reciprocal system. <b>If</b> the <b>teacher</b> is enthusiastic, the students respond, drawing even more energy from the <b>teacher.</b> <b>If</b> the <b>teacher</b> is dull, or if the students are unresponsive, the learning environment spirals down-ward. Augustine’s relational analysis allows him to diagnose and prescribe cures for some of the problems contemporary college and university teachers often encounter in their classrooms...|$|R
