40|$|A WELL-KNOWN {{anatomical}} {{feature of}} the orbit is its rich fatty content, distributed {{both inside and outside}} the muscle cone. The literature contains numerous reports of a variety of orbital tumours, and although angiolipomas and <b>fibrolipomas</b> appear quite frequently, the occurrence of a true lipoma is extremely rare. Strauss (1911) based his diagnosis of primary liposarcoma of the orbit on the predominance of fat in the tumour. In 1960, Enterline, Culberson, Rochlin, and Brady, in their review of 53 cases of liposarcoma, included one case of metastatic orbital liposarcoma. Fourteen of their cases metastasized, and only two of their patients were still alive at the time of review, and one of these two had metastasis in the lung six years after the original diagnosis. In the other case metastatic liposarcoma of the orbit was diagnosed sixteen years after the original diagnosis of liposarcoma of the thigh had been made. This patient also developed multiple secondaries with eventual invasion of the pelvis. The interesting case here presented is one of primary liposarcoma of the thigh with distant metastases.

40|$|Introduction: Lipoma is {{a benign}} tumor {{infrequent}} {{in the oral}} cavity, particularly in the tongue: indeed, lipomas only represent approximately 0. 3 % of all tongue neoplasia. Compared to conventional lipoma, <b>fibrolipoma</b> of the tongue is a very rare lesion that accounts for around 25 - 40 % of tongue lipomas, and until now, {{to the best of}} our knowledge, only 14 cases have been described in which histological diagnosis of <b>fibrolipoma</b> was specifically confirmed. We report the case of a patient with a voluminous <b>fibrolipoma</b> of the tongue, treated by means of surgical excision. <b>Fibrolipoma</b> excision, like that described in this report, sometimes may be laborious, because fibrous bands appear to be focally infiltrating adjacent tissues, giving rise to some doubts about the nature of the lesion. Case presentation: We report the case of a voluminous <b>fibrolipoma</b> of the tongue in a 71 -year-old Caucasian woman. Conclusions: Because of its histological characteristics, abundance of connective and secondary changes/atrophy, <b>fibrolipoma</b> may appear as infiltrating adjacent tissues and may cause doubts of differential diagnosis with malignant infiltrating lesions. Surgical excision is the elective treatment. However, an accurate differential diagnosis, postsurgical histological examination and careful follow-up are required...|$|E
40|$|Lipomas are benign mesenchymal tumors {{composed}} of mature adipocytes. They are classified {{according to their}} histological pattern and their etiology remains unclear. Objectives: To present two cases and review the literature. A search was conducted in the Medline / PubMed and Scielo data bases of the last 10 years (2004 - 2014) with the keywords “ intraoral lipoma OR oral cavity lipoma”. 46 articles with 95 cases (56 women and 39 men) were reviewed. The average age {{was found to be}} 52. 28 years (52. 28 ± 18. 55); and most of them occurred between the 4 th and 6 th decade of life. Lipomas occur mostly in the buccal mucosa (n = 36, 37. 9 %), followed by the tongue (n = 23, 24. 2 %) and other locations (n = 36, 37. 9 %). The most common histologic pattern was simple lipomas (n = 40, 42 %), followed by <b>fibrolipomas</b> (n = 18, 18. 9 %) and other types (n = 37, 39. 1 %).

Methods: This was a retrospective review of 62 patients who had resection of retrorectal tumors between 2002 and 2010. Results: All patients {{in this study were}} treated by excision of the retrorectal tumors. Surgical approach included transsacral approach (52 cases), transabdominal approach (eight cases), and combined approach (two cases). A total of 48 benign lesions (77. 4 %) and 14 malignant lesions (22. 6 %) were confirmed by histological examination. The 48 benign cases included dermoid cysts (17 cases), simple cysts (eight cases), teratomas (eight cases), neurofibromas (eight cases), <b>fibrolipomas</b> (four cases), neurilemmomas (two cases), and synovioma (one case). The 14 malignant cases included lymphomas (four cases), malignant teratomas (three cases), fibrosarcomas (two cases), interstitialomas (four cases) and malignant mesothelioma (one case). Complications occurred in 14. 5 % of patients and included intraoperative bleeding (three cases), rectal injury (three cases), and presacral infection (three cases).

40|$|Carpal tunnel {{syndrome}} (CTS) is rarely seen in children. A literature search in 1989 revealed 52 published cases. The authors review 163 additional cases that were published since that date. The {{majority of these}} cases were related with a genetic condition. The most common aetiology was lysosomal storage disease: mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) in 95 and mucolipidoses (ML) in 22. In CTS secondary to MPS, clinical signs typical of adult CTS are rarely seen, and difficulty with fine motor tasks is the most frequent finding. CTS in MPS {{does not seem to}} be prevented by bone marrow transplantation, the usual treatment for the condition. CTS is probably due to a combination of excessive lysosomal storage in the connective tissue of the flexor retinaculum and a distorted anatomy because of underlying bone dysplasia. Mucolipidoses come next in the aetiology, with essentially similar symptoms. The authors found in the literature 11 cases of primary familial CTS, a condition which presents as an inheritable disorder of connective tissue mediated by an autosomal dominant gene; the symptoms may be more typical in some cases, but are more similar to MPS in others. A case with self-mutilation has been reported. Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) is a rare autosomal dominant condition characterised by episodes of decreased sensation or palsies after slight traction or pressure on peripheral nerves; it may also give symptoms of CTS. Schwartz-Jampel syndrome (SJS), another genetic disorder with autosomal recessive skeletal dysplasia, is characterised by varying degrees of myotonia and chondrodysplasia; it has also been noted associated with CTS in a child. Melorrheostosis and Leri's syndrome have also been noted in children with CTS, as well as Déjerine-Sottas syndrome and Weill-Marchesani syndrome. Among non-genetic causes of CTS in children, idiopathic cases with children onset have been reported, usually but not always related with thickening of the transverse carpal ligament. Intensive sports practice has been reported as an aetiological factor in several cases of childhood CTS. Nerve territory oriented macrodactily, a benign localised form of gigantism, is another unusual cause of CTS in children, as are <b>fibrolipomas</b> of the median nerve or intraneural perineuroma or haemangioma of the median nerve. Acute cases have been reported in children with haemophilia, secondary to local bleeding. Another local cause is a musculotendinous malformation of the palmaris longus, the flexor digitorum superficialis, the flexor carpi radialis brevis (a supernumerary muscle), the first lumbricalis or the palmaris brevis. Isolated cases of childhood CTS have also been reported in Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome, in Poland's syndrome and in scleroderma. Finally, several cases have been noted following trauma, most often related with epiphysiolysis of the distal radius. Immediate reduction has cleared the problem in most cases, but exploration of the median nerve should be considered otherwise, and also in cases with delayed occurrence of symptoms. Overall 145 of the 163 reviewed cases have undergone open carpal tunnel release. Childhood CTS often has an unusual presentation, with modest complaints and children are often too young to communicate their problem. In CTS with specific aetiologies such as storage disease, the symptoms may be masked by the skeletal dysplasia and joint stiffness. Every child with even mild symptoms must be thoroughly examined and a family history must be taken. Children with storage disease may benefit from early clinical and electrophysiological screening before they develop obvious clinical signs. status: publishe...|$|R
