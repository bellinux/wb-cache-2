40|$|The {{mobility}} of the lithosphere over a weaker asthenosphere constitutes the essential <b>element</b> <b>of</b> <b>plate</b> tectonics, {{and thus the}} understanding of the processes at the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary (LAB) is fundamental to understand how our planet works. It is especially so for oceanic plates because their relatively simple creation and evolution should enable easy elucidation of the LAB. Data from borehole broadband ocean bottom seismometers show that the LAB beneath the Pacific and Philippine Sea plates is sharp and age-dependent. The observed large shear wave velocity reduction at the LAB requires a partially molten asthenosphere consisting of horizontal melt-rich layers embedded in meltless mantle, which accounts for the large viscosity contrast at the LAB that facilitates horizontal plate motions. Oceanic plates are created at mid-oceanicridges and spread away as a rigid body(lithosphere) to move over a weaker as-thenosphere.

50|$|The {{mantle of}} a planet with plate {{tectonics}} has driving forces that exceed the yield strength of the brittle lithosphere, causing the lithosphere to fracture into plates that move relative to each other. A critical <b>element</b> <b>of</b> the <b>plate</b> tectonic system is these lithospheric plates become negatively buoyant {{at some point in}} their evolution, sinking into the mantle. The surface mass deficit is balanced by new plate being formed elsewhere through upwelling mantle plumes. Plate tectonics is an efficient method of heat transfer from the interior of the planet to the surface.

40|$|A key <b>element</b> <b>of</b> <b>plate</b> {{tectonics}} on Earth is {{that the}} lithosphere is subducting into the mantle. Subduction results from forces that bend and pull the lithosphere into {{the interior of the}} Earth. Once subducted, lithospheric slabs are further modified by dynamic forces in the mantle, and their sinking is inhibited by the increase in viscosity of the lower mantle. These forces are resisted by the material strength of the lithosphere. Using geodynamic models, we investigate several subduction models, wherein we control material strength by setting a maximum viscosity for the surface plates and the subducted slabs independently. We find that models characterized by a dichotomy of lithosphere strengths produce a spectrum of results that are comparable to interpretations of observations of subduction on Earth. These models have strong lithospheric plates at the surface, which promotes Earth-like single-sided subduction. At the same time, these models have weakened lithospheric subducted slabs which can more easily bend to either lie flat or fold into a slab pile atop the lower mantle, reproducing the spectrum of slab morphologies that have been interpreted from images of seismic tomography...|$|R

40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} {{adaptive}} ï¬nite <b>element</b> modeling <b>of</b> <b>plate</b> structures. The ï¬nite <b>element</b> modeling <b>of</b> <b>plates</b> {{has grown to}} a mature research topic, which has contributed signiï¬cantly to the development <b>of</b> the ï¬nite <b>element</b> method for structural analysis due to its complexity and inherently speciï¬c issues. At present, several validated plate models and corresponding families of working and eï¬cient ï¬nite elements are available, oï¬ering a sound basis for an engineer to choose from. In our opinion, the main problems in the ï¬nite modeling <b>of</b> <b>plates</b> are nowadays related to the adaptive modeling. Adaptive modeling should reach much beyond standard discretization (ï¬nite element mesh) error estimates and related mesh (discretization) adaptivity. It should also include model error estimates and model adaptivity, which should provide the most appropriate mathematical model for a speciï¬c region of a structure. Thus in this work we study adaptive modeling for the case <b>of</b> <b>plates.</b> The primary goal of the thesis is to provide some {{answers to the questions}} related to the key steps in the process of adaptive modeling <b>of</b> <b>plates.</b> Since the adaptivity depends on reliable error estimates, {{a large part of the}} thesis is related to the derivation of computational procedures for discretization error estimates as well as model error estimates. A practical comparison of some of the established discretization error estimates is made. Special attention is paid to what is called equilibrated residuum method, which has a potential to be used both for discretization error and model error estimates. It should be emphasized that the model error estimates are quite hard to obtain, in contrast to the discretization error estimates. The concept of model adaptivity for plates is in this work implemented on the basis of equilibrated residuum method and hierarchic family <b>of</b> <b>plate</b> ï¬nite <b>element</b> models. The ï¬nite elements used in the thesis range from thin plate ï¬nite elements to thick plate ï¬nite elements. The latter are based on a newly derived higher order plate theory, which includes through the thickness stretching. The model error is estimated by local element-wise compu- tations. As all the ï¬nite elements, representing the chosen plate mathematical models, are re-derived in order to share the same interpolation bases, the diï¬erence between the local com- putations can be attributed mainly to the model error. This choice <b>of</b> ï¬nite <b>elements</b> enables eï¬ective computation of the model error estimate and improves the robustness of the adaptive modeling. Thus the discretization error can be computed by an independent procedure. Many numerical examples are provided as an illustration of performance <b>of</b> the derived <b>plate</b> <b>elements,</b> the derived discretization error procedures and the derived modeling error procedure. Since the basic goal of modeling in engineering is to produce an eï¬ective model, which will produce the most accurate results with the minimum input data, the need for the adaptive modeling will always be present. In this view, the present work is a contribution to the ï¬nal goal <b>of</b> the ï¬nite <b>element</b> modeling <b>of</b> <b>plate</b> structures: a fully automatic adaptive procedure for the construction of an optimal computational model (an optimal ï¬nite element mesh and an optimal choice <b>of</b> a <b>plate</b> model for each <b>element</b> <b>of</b> the mesh) for a given plate structure. vii...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn a {{previous}} study, {{we found that}} metaphase chromosomes are formed by thin plates, {{and here we have}} applied atomic force microscopy (AFM) and friction force measurements at the nanoscale (nanotribology) to analyze the properties of these planar structures in aqueous media at room temperature. Our results show that high concentrations of NaCl and EDTA and extensive digestion with protease and nuclease enzymes cause plate denaturation. Nanotribology studies show that native plates under structuring conditions (5 Â mM Mg 2 +) have a relatively high friction coefficient (Î¼ â 0. 3), which is markedly reduced when high concentrations of NaCl or EDTA are added (Î¼ â 0. 1). This lubricant effect can be interpreted considering the electrostatic repulsion between DNA phosphate groups and the AFM tip. Protease digestion increases the friction coefficient (Î¼Â âÂ  0. 5), but the highest friction is observed when DNA is cleaved by micrococcal nuclease (Î¼ â 0. 9), indicating that DNA is the main structural <b>element</b> <b>of</b> <b>plates.</b> Whereas nuclease-digested plates are irreversibly damaged after the friction measurement, native plates can absorb kinetic energy from the AFM tip without suffering any damage.
