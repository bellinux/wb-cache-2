SFC permits measurement of angular dependence <b>of</b> light-scattering intensity (<b>indicatrix)</b> <b>of</b> single particles.

We have studied the effect of RBC orientation related to {{the direction of the}} incident light upon the <b>indicatrix.</b> Numerical calculations <b>of</b> indicatrices for several aspect ratios and volumes of RBC have been carried out. Comparison of the simulated indicatrices and indicatrices measured by SFC showed good agreement, validating the biconcave disk model for a mature RBC. We simulated the light-scattering output signals from the SFC with the DDA for RBCs modeled as a disk-sphere and as an oblate spheroid. The biconcave disk, the disk-sphere, and the oblate spheroid models have been compared for two orientations, i. e. face-on and rim-on incidence. Only the oblate spheroid model for rim-on incidence gives results similar to the rigorous biconcave disk model. Comment: 13 pages, 9 figure...|$|R
