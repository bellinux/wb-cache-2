40|$|Thesis (Masters Diploma(Electrical Engineering)) [...] Cape Technikon, Cape Town, 1989 {{various types}} of {{electronic}} card test equipment are freely available today for different types of electronic printed circuit boards. A company certainly wants to pick the most suitable tester to suit their needs, and more importantly a tester that will fit into their bUdget. Today a company can easily import in-circuit testers that will cost well in the reglon of six figures. The cheaper the equipment go, the less features one can expect from the equipment. Like all other big decisions in life, this might also be a tough one for a company. Part one of this thesis will consider most of these questions, and will also give more insight on what type of specifications to look for. This section will also explain {{the different types of}} faults that occur, the repair costs involved, different types of card testers available and some of their features. Advanced in-circuit testing techniques will also be explained. Part two of this thesis describes the design and development of the Identif ier Card Tester. The" Program Control and Impulse Sender Card", (referred to as "Identifier Card") is one of the cards used in a system called "Electronic Identifier". The <b>electronic</b> <b>identifier</b> was developed to enable a subscriber directory number, a line or equipment numbers, or in general, the origin of information and classes-of-service to be determined by way of an existing connection within a telephone exchange. The system was designed for the purpose of incorporating it into the existing public exchanges where no identifier wires are available. It operates on the principle of a switching circuit (line) tester. The identification pulses are evaluated with the aid of 6 mm bistable magnetic ring cores according to the current steering principle. The program control and the output circuit uses a transistor, a magnetic core/transistor or a magnetic core/thyristor circuit. The <b>electronic</b> <b>identifier</b> is mostly used with "Routiners" in Electra-mechanical exchanges. The biggest percentage of failures on these systems are caused by the Identifier Card and hence the request {{for the development of a}} "Identifier Card Tester"...|$|E
40|$|The {{informatics}} infrastructure {{supporting the}} Information Society requires the aggregation of data about individuals in electronic records. Such data structures demand that individuals be uniquely identified {{and this is}} critical to the necessary processes of authentication, identification and enrolment {{associated with the use of}} e-Business, e-Government and potentially e-Democracy systems. It is also necessary to the representation of human interactions as data transactions supporting various forms of governance structure: hierarchies, markets and networks. In this paper we use the agenda surrounding the proposed introduction of a national identity card in the UK as an empirical backbone for considering the issue of identity management. Currently, the UK government is attempting to relate the rights and entitlements of citizenship in the UK with a standard <b>electronic</b> <b>identifier</b> for British citizens and its instantiation in an ‘entitlements card’. This attempt to define legitimising identity seems to us a potentially fruitful empirical source for examining the conceptual and pragmatic issues associated with identity management in the information age. Such a card offers numerous potential benefits for individuals and organisations but its introduction raises major challenges to data protection, data privacy and public trust in the information governance of the UK...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} is to discuss the {{distinction}} between characterisation (classification) and denomination (naming, identifying) {{in the context of}} information systems (IS). The paper has a special focus on the design of identifiers, i. e. terms used for identifying individual phenomenon. The {{reason for this is that}} the distinction between denomination and characterisation is especially important when designing identifiers. Identifiers e. g. article numbers, telephone numbers, e-mail addresses and personal numbers, constitute an important part of the information infrastructure of companies and society as a whole, and therefore it is crucial that these terms are well designed.

40|$|The {{readability}} of {{two different}} types of <b>electronic</b> <b>identifiers</b> (EID) were evaluated under pastoral production system in North-Eastern Kenya. Physical verification and reading was done at day 0, and 1, 2, 4, 8 and 12 months respectively on a total of 1943 beef cattle of which 934 were tagged using ear button tags and 1009 with rumen boluses. The retention rates were recorded and readability determined using a hand-held reader and subsequently compared using a non parametric survival analysis. The results showed that, rumen boluses were more effective with retention and readability of 100 % after the one-year period. The retention rate for ear button tags deteriorated after day 120 to 94. 6 %. This implied that rumen boluses are safe and tamper-proof and are thus recommended for use in pastoral production systems. When tested within the model Livestock Identification and Traceability System (LITS), the use of RFID identifiers were able to substantially contribute to better record keeping, and proof of credible livestock certification. However, due to cost considerations, undertaking a benefit-cost analysis and provisional analysis of the institutional and organisational infrastructure may be critical for successful implementation...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, an {{increasing}} number of objects can be represented by their wireless electronic identifiers. For example, people can be recognized by their phone numbers or their phones ’ WiFi MAC addresses and products can be identified by their RFID numbers. Localizing objects with electronic identifiers is increasingly important as our lives become increasingly “digitalized”. However, traditional wireless localization techniques cannot meet the fast growing needs of accurate and cost efficient localization. Some of these techniques require expensive hardware to achieve high accuracy, which is impractical for massive deployment. Others, such as WiFi RSSI based localization, are inaccurate and not robust to environmental noise. In this paper, we propose a new localization technique called EV-Loc. In EV-Loc, we use visual signals to help improve the accuracy of wireless localization. Our technique fully leverages visual signals’ high accuracy and electronic signals ’ pervasiveness. To effectively couple these two signals, we design an E-V match engine to find the correspondence between an object’s <b>electronic</b> <b>identifier</b> and its visual appearance. We implement our technique on mobile devices and evaluate it in real-world scenarios. The localization error is less than 1 m. We also evaluate our approach using large scale simulations. The results show that our approach is accurate and robust...|$|E
40|$|The {{complete}} {{knowledge of}} the travel demand is the cornerstone for many applications {{in the field of}} transport and traffic management. Knowing the actual demand is important in order to establish the effectiveness of the network in handling the need of the road users, and to measure the impact of network changes on the overall traffic flow. A good estimate of the present state of the network is the preliminary point to any mobility analysis and therefore a problem of great interest. The state of the network can be described by the Origin/Destination (OD) matrix. The OD matrix is double-entry table M in which each element Mij contains a census of the volume of journeys, from origin i to destination j which is often used to track traffic volumes over space and time. The Bluetooth technology is being increasingly used to track vehicles throughout their trips, within urban networks and across freeway stretches. One important opportunity offered by this type of data is the measurement of Origin-Destination patterns, emerging from the aggregation and clustering of individual trips. Compared to plate recognition and GPS track recording, the Bluetooth technology features some major advantages as it is easy to install and maintain and does not require accurate calibration. Moreover, the effectiveness of the detection does not depend on the orientation of the scanners or the vehicles, thus capturing the traffic regardless of the direction of travel. Another important aspect is that the detection is anonymous, in that the <b>electronic</b> <b>identifier</b> (MAC address) of the detected vehicles can be converted into an encrypted (hash) code at the sensor site. A novel approach in using Bluetooth technology associated with traffic monitoring is the Bluetooth-based Floating Car Observer (FCO) developed by the German Aerospace Center (DLR). Its detections are made indirectly by floating traffic observers using wireless radio-based technologies while passing other traffic objects (vehicles, cyclists, pedestrians), and thus, enabling spatiotemporal traffic data through the covered network. The aim of the paper is twofold. We first give an extensive overview on the issues and challenges of the usage of a Bluetooth-based FCO in order to retrieve OD matrices. Further, we investigate the potential of the data base by proposing a methodology to generate and to analyse OD matrices. Due to the high volume and velocity of detected data it is crucial to use efficient algorithm for data analytics. Therefore, we experiment with Hadoop-based Big Data technologies. The evaluation of our postulated methods will be done by a field experiment. For that experiment, a special equipped taxi-fleet of 30 vehicles will collect data in the region of Berlin (Germany) for at least one month...|$|E
40|$|Once I had {{explored}} the research issue of North and South unification {{with a focus}} on the legal integration for uniform constitution and various statutes. It pushed me to deal with a big question, and looked like a semi-textbook with an inchoate idea and baby theory upon the completion of research project. The literature review thankfully had allowed the space of creativity and originality of my work product, and can also be a typical way of foreign graduate legal researchers in the process of his dissertation work. They would be beneficial with new statutes and codes, for example, from the Korean Congress, that are enacted recently, which would be their research topic certainly original and contributive. This could be viewed as one of qualitative enclaves enmeshed into a larger scope of qualitative inquiry. This interplay is fairly consequential in excavating a new knowledge and research findings. It could be aboriginal [...] one trait word to characterize the qualitative studies [...] from the viewpoint of host country, but became original as a crop to expand the horizon of new knowledge. I have once argued that the quantitative studies are on generality of subjects and commonness for involved strands. This profile would vary that the qualitative studies tend to be strong with the story and enclaves. The e-age and rapid compression of space with the development of telecommunication technology also factor to change a paradigm of knowledge and research activities. At least, the contemporary society certainly would be more specific as if we can trace a person with the satellite spotting and the <b>electronic</b> <b>identifier</b> on the leg of sex criminals in Korea guarantees to be safeguarded from his potential danger. That may be favorable concerning the elements and environments of qualitative studies. For example, we may follow up by comparing the research work of Korean statute with the e-government of Korea displaying the statute. We can entertain many on-line sources of information and stories with the dissertations of aboriginal culture. With my time on the qualitative studies, I came across the nocebo effect illustrated with the fear of MERs-CoV in Korea. The effect looks into the negative dimension of human mind and his personality, which could aggravate the current challenge of national crisis, June, 2015. Paradoxically, the nocebo effect can be said to characterize the qualitative context of inquiry. As Freud suggested, the vast of human element is of unexplainable dimension that is less easily quantifiable or generizable over the population (Broome, 2010). This does not say that the continental researchers had been affected with a late nationalization or late development of region leaving them to search for an ego. This is to say that the qualitative studies could explain the part of truths for the universe and human. The researchers interested in deep knowledge could employ their method, but in ethics, who would not vulture the objects of his theme and conduct on due scientific ground...|$|E
40|$|Reliability, {{efficacy}} and {{the efficiency of}} EID of animals according to RFID technology were assessed across different animal production filiere. Accident occurrence, un-detectability of electronic code, as well as technical aspects due to different types of devices deployed were considered before setting up a cost/benefit analysis of the system based on RFID technology for traceability purposes. A coded manual {{of operations for the}} electronic identification of animals in the practice on a large scale according different electronic devices (injectable transponders or ceramic boluses) was implemented. An experimental Help Desk Service (HDS) was created as a practical support concerning animal welfare, veterinary aspects and losses/breakages of <b>electronic</b> <b>identifiers.</b> An evolution of the system to check performance of RFID technology in farms was due to the detection of bolus/transponders presence in animals body by digitalized X-ray analysis, thus allowing a sound check for operators and for reliability assessment. A very weak point was identified in a consistent loss (36. 9 %) of miniboluses (20 g) in goats, after 2 years from the first electronic identification. The SWOT analysis showed that the adoption of RFID technology for animal identification is a good tool for traceability of animals and improving farm management and a concrete help to solve on field problems during hard fieldwork operations...|$|R

40|$|Authentication {{is a key}} {{building}} block in security systems and many applications to prevent access to information, services, assets or locations for non-authorized persons or processes. Common methods based on knowledge or possession are however not scalable and practical in human-to-machine communication. Passwords are difficult to remember if chosen appropriately and distinct for {{the increasing number of}} different applications, they can be forgotten, spied-out and passed on to other persons. Tokens, like keys or cards, can be forwarded, stolen, lost or destroyed in a similar way. Biometric systems, as the third factor, use body properties to allow for convenient authentication. The main difference lies in a strong link between <b>electronic</b> <b>identifier</b> and physical identity which leads to desirable properties like non-repudiation, difficulty of replication, theft and loss. On the other hand this may challenge privacy and may lead to identity theft, disclosure of sensitive information and profiling if digital biometric identifiers are exposed. Vascular biometric systems use information about the blood vessel structures inside the hand area (finger, palm or wrist) and overcome problems of latent prints (as with fingerprints, DNA) or unnoticed acquisition on distance (as with face) and liveness issues. Still, the before mentioned problems of biometric systems exist and privacy enhancing technologies (PETs) were introduced to overcome them. Some PETs enable revocation of biometric references, unlimited references from the same biometric source and unlinkability between the generated templates. In addition the sensitive data is sealed. In order to utilize PETs like the helper data scheme (HDS) some requirements, like a fixed-length structure of the feature representation, have to be met. The goal of this thesis is to meet those requirements and {{to make use of the}} HDS. In addition we strive for the application in real-life scenarios. One of the main applications that we identified for such a system is online banking. Those systems, as of today, are secured with authentication systems based on knowledge or possession and constantly a vulnerable target of criminal activity. Since the recent systems are mostly broken, new alternatives are needed. So we designed a protocol based on the HDS that merges information about online transactions with secure biometric references to enable secure online banking with the desirable properties of biometric systems: hence the name BTAP – biometric transaction authentication protocol. The work on representing patterns compatible to the HDS has been achieved for fingerprint- based systems using spectral minutiae. Therefore we designed algorithms to extract minutiae to represent the topology of the blood vessel network with its branch and end points. Transforming the location and orientation information of the feature points into spectral vein minutiae leads to a translation invariant, fixed-length representation that allows for alignment-free scale and rotation corrections. Those properties are especially important for hygienic, contact-free sensors without guidance for the hand or finger. A performance evaluation revealed that the transformed spectral vein minutiae lead to low recognition errors for sub-modalities including palm, palm dorsal (back of hand) and wrist vein patterns. In a multi-reference scenario the performance for quantized spectral minutiae based on palm vein patterns and a simple Hamming distance could even be improved to a perfect separation between genuine and imposter attempts. The quantized, binary feature vectors are utilized in the first stages of the HDS, they are very compact and could also be used for extremely fast comparison systems or for biometric indexing. In conclusion our work shows that vascular patterns can be transformed into highi performance representations meeting the requirements of the privacy-enhancing HDS that is the core for the proposed online banking protocol BTAP. After solving issues with the reproducibility of feature vectors, we will be able to combine vein patterns with BTAP to overcome drawbacks of biometric systems to perform secure, convenient, affordable and user accepted biometric online banking transaction authentication. Bringing the work into a larger perspective, we can state that BTAP is an innovative instance where a biometric system is shifted from a binary authentication decision-making scheme to an integral part of an abstract security protocol. The combination of data from the application with keys released from biometric templates opens new possibilities and represents a recent paradigm shift in biometric systems. General digital biometric signature schemes and biometric message authentication primitives with a strong relation to a natural person are the next step...|$|E
