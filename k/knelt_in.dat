5|$|Tillman {{raised his}} profile in state {{politics}} by attending the 1876 state Democratic convention, which nominated Hampton as the party's candidate for governor. While Hampton presented a fatherly image, urging support from South Carolinians, black and white, Tillman led fifty men to Ellenton, intending to join over one thousand rifle club members who slaughtered thirty militiamen, with the survivors saved {{only by the}} arrival of federal authorities. Although Tillman and his men arrived too late to participate in those killings, two of his men murdered Simon Coker, a black state senator who had come to investigate reports of violence. They shot him as he <b>knelt</b> <b>in</b> final prayer.|$|E

25|$|John Hawkins gained notice {{again in}} June 2006, almost {{four and a}} half centuries after his death, when his {{descendant}} Andrew Hawkins publicly apologized for his ancestor's actions in the slave trade. Andrew and 20 friends from the Christian charity Lifeline Expedition <b>knelt</b> <b>in</b> chains before 25,000 Africans to ask forgiveness for his ancestor's involvement in the slave trade at Independence Stadium in Bakau, the Gambia. The Vice President of the Gambia Isatou Njie Saidy symbolically removed the chains in a spirit of reconciliation and forgiveness.|$|E

A contingent of Marines with tanks and armored vans, led by Brigadier General Artemio Tadiar, was stopped along Ortigas Avenue, about two kilometers from the camps, by tens of thousands of people. Nuns holding rosaries <b>knelt</b> <b>in</b> front of the tanks and men and women linked arms together to block the troops. Tadiar asked the crowds to make a clearing for them, but they did not budge. In the end, the troops retreated with no shots fired.|$|E

He {{went back to his}} corner and <b>knelt</b> <b>in</b> prayer as the arena erupted in cheers. With this {{historic}} victory, Foreman broke three records: he became, at age 45, the oldest fighter ever to win the World Heavyweight Championship; 20 years after losing his title for the first time, he broke the record for the fighter with the longest interval between his first and second world championships; and the age spread of 19 years between the champion and challenger was the largest of any heavyweight boxing championship fight.|$|E

25|$|In the legend, Afonso Henriques is visited {{before the}} battle {{by an old}} man who saw in a dream that Henriques would be victorious because God would {{intervene}} in his favour. He advised the nobleman to leave the encampment alone when he heard the bell of the local chapel. Riding off he was surprised by a ray of light that showed him (in one interpretation) {{the sign of the cross}} and Jesus Christ on a crucifix. Afonso Henriques <b>knelt</b> <b>in</b> its presence and heard the voice of Christ who told him he would defeat the Moors, which he, through courage and his faith, succeeded the following day.|$|E
25|$|The {{foundation}} of Northwestern University is traceable {{to a meeting}} on May 31, 1850 of nine prominent Chicago businessmen, Methodist leaders and attorneys who had formed the idea of establishing a university to serve {{what had once been}} known as the Northwest Territory. On January 28, 1851, the Illinois General Assembly granted a charter to the Trustees of the North-Western University, making it the first chartered university in Illinois. The school's nine founders, all of whom were Methodists (three of them ministers), <b>knelt</b> <b>in</b> prayer and worship before launching their first organizational meeting. Although they affiliated the university with the Methodist Episcopal Church, they were committed to non-sectarian admissions, believing that Northwestern should serve all people in the newly developing territory.|$|E
25|$|Many {{theories}} exist {{about the}} origins of cricket. One suggests that the game began among shepherds hitting a stone or a ball of wool with their crooks and, at the same time, defending the wicket gate into the sheep-fold (from Anglo Saxon 'cricce', a crooked staff). A second theory suggests the name came from a low stool known as a 'cricket' in England, which from the side looked like the long, low wicket used {{in the early days of}} the game (originally from the Flemish 'krickstoel', a low stool on which parishioners <b>knelt</b> <b>in</b> church). There is also a reference to 'criquet' in North-East France in 1478 and evidence that the game evolved in South-East England in the Middle Ages.|$|E

25|$|While {{some of his}} trips (such as to the United States and the Holy Land) were {{to places}} {{previously}} visited by Pope Paul VI, John Paul II became the first pope to visit the White House in October 1979, where he was greeted warmly by then-President Jimmy Carter. He was the first pope ever to visit several countries in one year, starting in 1979 with Mexico and Ireland. He was the first reigning pope {{to travel to the}} United Kingdom, in 1982, where he met Queen ElizabethII, the Supreme Governor of the Church of England. While in Britain he also visited Canterbury Cathedral and <b>knelt</b> <b>in</b> prayer with Robert Runcie, the Archbishop of Canterbury, at the spot where Thomas Ã  Becket had been killed, as well as holding several large-scale open air masses, including one at Wembley Stadium, which was attended by some 80,000 people.|$|E
25|$|Salvatore Giuliano is a 1962 Italian film {{directed}} by Francesco Rosi. Shot in a neo-realist documentary, non-linear style, it follows {{the lives of}} those involved with Giuliano. When Rosi came to Sicily in 1961 to re-enact the Portella Della Ginestra sequence massacre for the film, the trauma from 14 years earlier was still fresh. He asked 1,000 peasants to go back and enact exactly what they, their friends and relatives had been through. Events nearly slipped out of control. When the gunfire sound effects started, the crowd panicked and knocked over one of the cameras in rush to escape; women wept and <b>knelt</b> <b>in</b> prayer; men threw themselves to the ground in agony. One old woman, dressed entirely in black, planted herself before the camera and repeated in an anguished wail, 'Where are my children?' Two of her sons had died at the hands of Giuliano and his band.|$|E
25|$|After {{a couple}} more completions, the Badgers had the ball at the Sun Devil 13-yard line for 1st and 10. The Badgers were in {{possession}} of the football with 18 seconds left, hoping to kick a game-winning field goal. Upon the hike Quarterback Joel Stave <b>knelt</b> <b>in</b> {{the middle of the}} field to center the ball for their kicker. Stave then placed the ball quickly on the ground after the play was blown dead by the referee. Replays showed that Stave did get his knee down for a brief second, however Arizona State believed that it was a fumble, and ASU Anthony Jones dove on top of the ball, with the game clock running. At this point Badgers players signalled to the officials, pointing out the delay of game penalty by ASU due to Anthony being top of the football. Umpire Jack Folliard motioned to Stave acknowledging his knee, however the rest of the officiating crew allegedly did not see this signal. The umpire then spotted the ball after a significant delay, but told the Wisconsin offensive line to wait to line up, even though the clock continued to run. Finally, with approximately 2 seconds remaining, the umpire rushed behind the defensive line as Wisconsin tried to run a play to spike the ball and stop the clock but the clock reached zero before the ball was snapped and the game was over.|$|E

500|$|Hensley was {{initially}} content following his {{experience at the}} Church of God, but he began to question whether he was living a sufficiently righteous life. He became fixated on a passage in the Gospel of Mark (Mark 16:17â18, KJV: [...] "And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name... They shall take up serpents" [...] which suggested that Christians might take up [...] "serpents" [...] without injury. Psychologists Ralph W. Hood and W. Paul Williamson, {{as well as one}} of Hensley's children, have proposed that his preoccupation with this verse arose from a childhood memory of witnessing snake handling in Virginia. Hensley later recalled that he began to doubt his salvation and withdrew to a nearby hill to pray and seek God's will. In a 1947 newspaper interview, he claimed to have seen a snake while walking on the hill. He said that he <b>knelt</b> <b>in</b> prayer, took hold of it, then brought it to his church and told the congregation to also prove their salvation by holding the snake.|$|E
500|$|The first {{noteworthy}} {{game for}} Bomar was a 14â0 {{loss to the}} Frankford Yellow Jackets. [...] After the Giants' poor first half, the Yellow Jackets led by 14 points. During the second half the Giants recovered somewhat, with good passes from Jack McBride to Bomar but no chance of a comeback. In a 13â0 victory over the Rochester Jeffersons, McBride threw a 27-yard touchdown pass to Bomar. A 13â12 win over the Providence Steam Roller had a 24-yard touchdown pass from McBride to Bomar and an interesting ending. The Giants were backed up near their end zone, faced with a fourth down and leading 13â10. Providence was set for a blitz on the punter, but when he caught the ball he <b>knelt</b> <b>in</b> the end zone for a safety (not enough for Providence to win). Against the Kansas City Cowboys, several passes from McBride to Bomar netted 24 yards in a 67-yard touchdown drive for a 9â3 victory. Bomar had possibly his best day in a 23â0 victory over the Dayton Triangles before a crowd of 18,000. Six of McBride's completed passes that day were to Bomar, including a 45-yarder for the Giants' first touchdown. Bomar was selected to NFL president Joseph Carr's all-star team.|$|E

500|$|Still, {{shades of}} Balzac's realism {{are found in}} the book, {{particularly}} in the first-hand descriptions of the CollÃ¨ge de VendÃ´me. The first part of the novel is replete with details about the school, describing how quarters were inspected and the complex social rules for exchanging dishes at dinnertime. Punishments are also described at length, including the assignment of tedious writing tasks and the painful application of the strap: Of all the physical torments to which we were exposed, certainly the most acute was that inflicted by this leathern instrument, about two fingers wide, applied to our poor little hands with all the strength and all the fury of the administrator. To endure this classical form of correction, the victim <b>knelt</b> <b>in</b> the middle of the room. He had to leave his form and go to kneel down near the master's desk under the curious and generally merciless eyes of his fellows.... Some boys cried out and shed bitter tears before or after the application of the strap; others accepted the infliction with stoic calm... but few could control an expression of anguish in anticipation. Further signs of Balzac's realism appear when Lambert describes his ability to vicariously experience events through thought alone. In one extended passage, he describes reading about the Battle of Austerlitz and seeing [...] "every incident". In another he imagines the physical pain of a knife cutting his skin. As Balzac's biographer AndrÃ© Maurois notes, these reflections provide insight into the author's perspective toward the world and its written representations.|$|E
