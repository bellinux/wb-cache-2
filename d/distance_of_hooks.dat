40|$|Abstract: A new {{mechanism}} for the formation <b>of</b> <b>hooks</b> and oscillation marks during continuous casting of ultra-low carbon steels is developed, based on: (i) observation <b>of</b> <b>hook</b> characteristics on specially-etched micrographs, (ii) metallographic studies near the line <b>of</b> <b>hook</b> origin using EDX, EPMA, and EBSD, and (iii) computations using separate models of fluid flow, solidification, and thermal stress. The mechanism {{is presented as a}} schematic, which illustrates the details of events leading to formation <b>of</b> <b>hooks</b> and oscillation marks. Its predictions are consistent with the trends observed in previous work, mold simulators and operating casters. This mechanism has important implications for the entrapment of inclusions and other surface defects...|$|R

40|$|The {{relationship}} between fish total length (TL) and mouth size in six species {{was investigated in}} light of the implications for the modelling of size selectivity <b>of</b> <b>hooks.</b> Significant non-linear rclationships were found in three specics, suggesting that opti-mal size at capture is not a linear function <b>of</b> <b>hook</b> size. These results strongly support the choiccs made in modelling skew-normal selectivity with optimal size at capture as a function <b>of</b> <b>hook</b> size...|$|R
40|$|The {{distributions}} <b>of</b> <b>hooking</b> {{positions in}} a mouth for sode hooks were obtained with {{pole and line}} fishing experiments in a water tank in order to analyze hooking phenomena. The <b>hooking</b> positions <b>of</b> smaller <b>hooks</b> are almost distributed in a esophagus or near a fish snout, and those <b>of</b> larger <b>hooks</b> are almost distributed about {{the center of a}} mouth cavity back. The distributions <b>of</b> <b>hooking</b> position in a mouth derived from a stochastic model <b>of</b> <b>hooking</b> mechanism were fitted well on the observed distributions for smaller hooks. However, in the case <b>of</b> larger <b>hooks,</b> the estimated distributions were not fitted on the observed distributions. It appears that the estimated distributions for large hooks are different from observed ones because the entrance size of the esophagus is not included in the model...|$|R

40|$|Germination of Arabidopsis {{seeds in}} {{darkness}} induces apical hook development, {{based on a}} tightly regulated differential growth coordinated by a multiple hormone cross-talk. Here, we endeavoured to clarify the function of brassinosteroids (BRs) and cross-talk with ethylene in hook development. An automated infrared imaging system was developed to study the kinetics <b>of</b> <b>hook</b> development in etiolated Arabidopsis seedlings. To ascertain the photomorphogenic control <b>of</b> <b>hook</b> opening, the system was equipped with an automatic light dimmer. We demonstrate that ethylene and BRs are indispensable for hook formation and maintenance. Ethylene regulation <b>of</b> <b>hook</b> formation functions partly through BRs, with BR feedback inhibition of ethylene action. Conversely, BR-mediated extension <b>of</b> <b>hook</b> maintenance functions partly through ethylene. Furthermore, we revealed that a short light pulse is sufficient to induce rapid hook opening. Our dynamic infrared imaging system allows high-resolution, kinetic imaging of up to 112 seedlings in a single experimental run. At this high throughput, it is ideally suited to rapidly gain insight in pathway networks. We demonstrate that BRs and ethylene cooperatively regulate apical hook development in a phase-dependent manner. Furthermore, we show that light is a predominant regulator <b>of</b> <b>hook</b> opening, inhibiting ethylene- and BR-mediated postponement <b>of</b> <b>hook</b> opening...|$|R

40|$|The hooks on 827 statoblasts of a Lake Michigan Pectinatella were counted. The number {{ranged from}} 11 to 21; the mode was 13; average, 13. 782 ±. 031; and index of variability, 1. 318 ±. 022. The {{skewness}} was + 0. 077; that is, the variation tends {{in the direction}} of the larger numbers, and this is correlated with the fact that species or races of Pectinatella with much larger numbers <b>of</b> <b>hooks</b> occur. There is a slight hereditary tendency in the statoblasts from one colony, about 0. 1 when 1 is the maximum inheritance. There is an inverse correlation (of -. 092 ±. 006) between the number <b>of</b> <b>hooks</b> and the perimeter, and a larger one between number and size <b>of</b> <b>hooks.</b> The number <b>of</b> <b>hooks</b> is thus not determined by room, nor does it seem to be predetermined from an early stage of development of the statoblast.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental investigation <b>of</b> bond-strengthening <b>hooks</b> {{as a new}} method to increase bond strength along flexural reinforcing bars in reinforced concrete (RC) beams.

Ten specimens with different numbers and sizes <b>of</b> <b>hooks</b> were prepared to verify the strengthening effectiveness under monotonic four-point loading. The test {{results indicated that the}} hooks increased the bond strength along flexural bars although the strengthening effectiveness was limited by the effective number <b>of</b> anchors <b>of</b> <b>hooks</b> Nbe.
