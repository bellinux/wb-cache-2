5|$|In the 1950s, the Civil Rights Movement {{increased}} {{pressure on the}} federal government to protect the voting rights of racial minorities. In 1957, Congress passed the first civil rights legislation since Reconstruction: the Civil Rights Act of 1957. This legislation authorized the Attorney General to sue for <b>injunctive</b> <b>relief</b> on behalf of persons whose Fifteenth Amendment rights were deprived, created the Civil Rights Division within the Department of Justice to enforce civil rights through litigation, and created the Commission on Civil Rights to investigate voting rights deprivations. Further protections were enacted in the Civil Rights Act of 1960, which allowed federal courts to appoint referees to conduct voter registration in jurisdictions that engaged in voting discrimination against racial minorities.|$|E
25|$|If the General Counsel {{believes}} that there is cause to issue complaint, then he can seek <b>injunctive</b> <b>relief</b> from a federal district court under Section 10(j) of the Act. <b>Injunctive</b> <b>relief</b> is usually ordered when necessary to preserve the status quo pending the Board's decision on the complaint or to prevent employees from suffering irreparable harm. Any injunction lapses once the NLRB issues its decision.|$|E

40|$|Compelling a {{party to}} {{disseminate}} judicial orders through her Homepage implies a relevant discretionary power. The work discusses the extension of such a judicial power, pointing out some questions and raising some concerns. What is the real function of such prominent advertising? Is it possible to repair a damage beared by a private plaintiff by restablishing a correct information of the public at large? Can <b>injunctive</b> <b>reliefs</b> transcend the immediate interests of the litigants {{in order to further}} social objectives? This paper does not provide definitive answers, rather it is a starting point for a discussion. The survey recalls other questions like: the increasing use of moral arguments in Courts’ reasoning in order to prevent violations or breach of duties, public information and commercial certainty as legal goals, the controversial shaming effect of the remedy at issue and the threats to personality rights and freedom of expression...|$|R

Gregory analyzes sexual harassment from the perspective of existing federal law and describes the legal rights that may be asserted by victims of harassment to obtain either <b>injunctive</b> or monetary <b>relief.</b> By clarifying little understood aspects of the law barring sexual harassment, the author presents an indispensable resource for victims seeking to learn what to expect from the legal system if they contest the actions of their harassers in the courts...|$|R
25|$|The General Counsel {{does not}} have to prove that the {{allegations}} in the complaint are well-founded, but only that he has some evidence, together with an arguable legal theory, to support his claims.

40|$|The Supreme Court has {{recently}} decided to hear {{argument in the}} largest private-employer civil rights case in American history, Dukes v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. This historic case involves up to 1. 5 million women suing Wal-Mart, {{one of the largest}} companies in the world, for alleged gender discrimination in pay and promotions, in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Like many employees who challenge companywide employment discrimination, the plaintiffs in Dukes brought their case as a class action pursuant to Rule 23 (b) (2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and sought <b>injunctive</b> and declaratory <b>relief,</b> and monetary relief in the form of back pay and punitive damages. After several appeals, class certification was largely upheld by the Ninth Circuit in a sharply divided en banc opinion. The Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court’s Rule 23 (b) (2) certification of a class of current employees with respect to their claims for <b>injunctive</b> and declaratory <b>relief</b> and back pay. This ruling set the stage for review by the nation’s highest court because of the ruling’s potential impact on class actions all over the country, involving areas as varied as employment discrimination, securities, antitrust, and products liability. The potential impact of the case stems not so much from the size of the Dukes class as from how the case will influence the very survival of certain types of class actions. At issue is whether it will become more difficult for plaintiffs who seek monetary relief for systemic misconduct to meet the class action criteria. This is important because for many employees and others, a class action is their only meaningful access to the courts. Moreover, class actions are important to the civil justice system because of the substantial time and cost savings they provide the courts and parties. The Dukes case has the potential to redefine the terms on which this critical procedural device is available...|$|R

On March 11, 1975, the single District Judge issued a temporary restraining order against further arrests and prosecutions of the Maynards. Because the appellees sought an injunction against a state statute on grounds of its unconstitutionality, a three-judge District Court was convened pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 2281.
