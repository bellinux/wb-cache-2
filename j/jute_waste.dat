30|$|In West Bengal, India, a {{huge amount}} of {{lignocellulosic}} <b>jute</b> <b>waste</b> products, in the form of unutilized cut pieces of jute caddies consisting 65 % cellulose, 22.5 % hemicellulose, and 11 % lignin, is generated from jute industries. Naturally, the high percentage of lignocellulolytic material made it an attractive substrate for the hydrolytic cleavage of lignocellulolytic enzymes, namely xylanases and cellulases. The present study aims for the production of xylanolytic and cellulolytic enzymes by a fungal isolate Penicillium janthinellum MTCC 10889 using a cheap medium containing residual jute caddies obtained from jute mill wastes and chemically defined basal medium under submerged fermentation.|$|E

30|$|Lim and Wu (2016) applied FT-IR {{spectroscopy}} for vermicompost {{maturity of}} decanter cake produced from palm oil mill. The infrared spectroscopy of initial feed mixtures {{was characterized by}} {{a broad peak at}} 3282  cm− 1 (O–H stretch), 2921 and 2852  cm− 1 (C–H stretch), 1743  cm− 1 (C=O stretch) and intense peak at 1031  cm− 1 (C–O stretch) region. After vermicomposting, the infrared spectra of final feed mixtures showed reductions in 3100 – 3600, 2921 and 2852  cm− 1 region and could be due to the mineralization of carbohydrates and aliphatic compounds. The results revealed that the E. eugeniae in vermicomposting of decanter cake helped in the stabilization and mineralization process. Das et al. (2016) applied FT-IR technique to confirm stability of toxic <b>jute</b> mill <b>waste</b> amended with cow dung and vegetable waste employing earthworm species, Metaphire posthuma. FTIR spectroscopy analysis results observed a higher maturity and stability of vermicomposted <b>jute</b> mill <b>waste</b> as compared to the traditional (without earthworm) product. The presence of aliphatic C–H stretching, stretching vibration of –OH and HOH bonds, and C–C stretching were highly compatible in the vermicomposted samples of <b>jute</b> mill <b>waste.</b> This indicates the waste degradation and mineralization through vermicomposting process. So, FT-IR spectroscopy is an essential instrument to analyze the quality or maturity of end product after vermicomposting in order to use it as perfect manure.|$|R
40|$|In this study, <b>waste</b> <b>jute,</b> {{which was}} {{provided}} from textile companies, was investigated to define effect of <b>waste</b> <b>jute</b> on swelling and bearing {{behavior of the}} sand used. Three different water content (17, 19 and 21 %) and four different <b>waste</b> <b>jute</b> addition amount at different percentages (0, 1, 2, and 3) by mass of dry soil were selected as design variables. With defined variables Swelling Ratio and California Bearing Ratio (CBR) tests were conducted. According to test results it is concluded that minimum swelling ratio was observed in the test containing 3 % jute with 19 % water content and the highest value of CBR was observed in the sample containing 2 % jute with 16 % water content. In addition to that, CBR values of unreinforced samples were decreased when water content increased from 16 % to 21 %. However, CBR values of reinforced samples increased with increasing water content from 19 % to 21 %...|$|R
30|$|The {{statistical}} optimal {{values of}} variables {{were obtained from}} the central composite design, and the response at the different points yielded maximum endoxylanase and endoglucanase production. A repeat fermentation of <b>jute</b> caddy <b>wastes</b> for the highest production of enzymes by P. janthinellum MTCC 10889 under optimal conditions was carried out for verification of the optimization. The maximal endoxylanase and endoglucanase production found under optimal conditions were 1, 750 and 192 IU/ml, respectively, which was 5.5 % and 8.57 % less than the predicted values, respectively.|$|R
30|$|The {{strain of}} P. janthinellum MTCC 10889 was {{cultivated}} under optimized conditions separately for endoxylanase and endoglucanase production in submerged fermentation of <b>waste</b> <b>jute</b> caddies for 24 to 120 h {{to detect the}} production kinetics of these two enzymes. Each set of experiment was triplicated, and their average value was taken.|$|R
30|$|The present paper {{deals with}} the {{optimization}} of major cultivation parameters like pH, temperature, and substrate concentration in submerged fermentation of <b>waste</b> <b>jute</b> caddies by Penicillium janthinellum for the simultaneous production of endoxylanase and endoglucanase, {{with the help of}} central composite design using response surface methodology. Further, the application of statistical experimental design techniques in fermentation process development can result in the improvement of product yield, reduce process variability, give a closer confirmation of the output response to nominal, and reduce overall costs (Pansuriya and Singhal 2010). The response surface methodology was proven to be a more cost- and time-saving method than classical one-at-a-time or mathematical methods (Siva Kiran et al. 2010).|$|R
40|$|Physico-chemical Analysis of {{the soil}} of Silghat region of Nagoan {{district}} of Assam, India was carried out to assess the possible effect of <b>jute</b> mill solid <b>waste</b> in the distribution pattern of some heavy metals. Soil samples were collected from ten different locations of the dumping site of the mill and their physico-chemical parameters were analyzed. Scanning Electron Microscopy-Energy Dispersive X-ray analysis (SEM-EDX) and Inductively coupled Plasma-Optical Emission Spectrometer (ICP-OES) analysis of the samples shows that soil of the dumping sites is highly enriched with heavy metals. The concentration of Fe, Cu, Zn and Pb in the contaminated soil {{was found to be}} very much higher than both the continental crust and world rock average values. Correlation studies indicate strong positive correlation between organic carbon content (Corg) with all the metals investigated. pH has negative correlation while positive correlation was observed for electrical conductivity with all the metals. Extent of metal contamination was assessed by determining contamination degree (CD) and pollution load index (PLI) ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract [...] Energy {{is the key}} input for technological, {{industrial}} and socio-economic development of a Nation. The technology of deriving energy from renewable bio-resources has been receiving much attention globally. Jute stick, agrowaste and <b>jute</b> caddies, mill <b>waste</b> are potential raw materials for generation of bio-energy. Jute stick, the woody biomass constitutes about 40 percent of the green plant with an annual production of 4. 0 million tons; where as, jute industry generates 40, 000 tons of processing waste as by-product, commonly known as jute caddies. Both jute stick and jute caddies are traditionally used as fuels for cooking in rural community and feed material in boilers in jute mills for direct combustion. Such combustion leads to enormous air pollution and burning with poor thermal efficiency due to low bulk density. An {{attempt was made to}} prepare briquettes from jute sticks and jute caddies with improved thermal efficiency. The briquettes developed were characterized for their energy values and other fuel parameters...|$|R
40|$|In this research, {{a series}} of large scale dynamic model tests were carried out on geojute and jute-geocell {{reinforced}} sand subgrade in controlled laboratory condition. The tests are conducted on geojute and jute-geocell (made from <b>waste</b> <b>jute</b> bags) reinforced and unreinforced sand subgrade under repeated loading to simulate traffic conditions. The placement density of sand in all the tests was maintained at 70 % (stiffer subgrade) and 30 % (weaker subgrade). A constant area of geojute and jute-geocell reinforcement was maintained throughout the test series. Cyclic behavior was investigated through varying the density, number of geojute layers and geojute arrangement. The influence of the width and height of the jute-geocell reinforcement on the cyclic behavior of the loading system was studied and performance improvement in terms of traffic benefit ratios and cumulative plastic deformation was determined. The loading was applied through a circular steel plate which replicates the load application from a passenger car replicating a single axle wheel load. A single axle wheel load was applied through a sophisticated double acting linear dynamic actuator which {{is attached to a}} 3. 5 m high reaction frame...|$|R
30|$|There {{are several}} {{procedures}} available for pesticides removal from water which includes photocatalytic degradation (Ugurlu and Karaoglu 2011; Gong et al. 2011), ultrasound combined with photo-Fenton treatment (Katsumata et al. 2011), {{advanced oxidation processes}} (Zhou et al. 2011), aerobic degradation (Rajashekara Murthy and Manonmani 2007), electrodialysis membranes (Banasiak et al. 2011), ozonation (Maldonado et al. 2006) and adsorption (Al-Muhtaseb et al. 2011). Among these, adsorption is effective and economical (Ahmad et al. 2009). Various adsorbents are used {{for the removal of}} pesticides in water samples including activated carbon (Ohno et al. 2008; Castro et al. 2009), straw (Akhtar et al. 2007), lignocellulosic substrate from agro industry (Bakouri et al. 2009), bagasse fly ash (Traub-Eberhard et al. 1995), coal fly ash (Singh 2009) and charcoal from agro waste (Sudhakar and Dikshit 1999) and bark (Boudesocque et al. 2008). Biosorption is relatively new and one of the effective alternative methods for the removal of pesticides in contaminated water samples. In addition to scientific preference, economic considerations also {{play an important role in}} the selection of appropriate biomass for pollution control. Thus, profound research attention is now focused on cost-effective, eco-friendly and easily available adsorbent, particularly of biological origin (Chatterjee et al. 2010). In recent years, various natural adsorbents such as agricultural wastes including Rhizopus oryzae biomass (Chatterjee et al. 2010), bagasse fly ash (Gupta et al. 2002), thermally treated egg shell (Elwakeel and Yousif 2010) and <b>waste</b> <b>jute</b> fiber carbon (Senthilkumaar et al. 2010) have been tried to achieve effective removal of pesticides. The search for an appropriate and inexpensive biomass is a continuing process. The most effective and optimized utilization of a biomass demands a detailed understanding of the binding mechanism.|$|R
