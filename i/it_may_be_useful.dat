5|$|Several {{drugs that}} target {{molecular}} pathways in lung cancer are available, {{especially for the}} treatment of advanced disease. Erlotinib, gefitinib and afatinib inhibit tyrosine kinase at the epidermal growth factor receptor. Denosumab is a monoclonal antibody directed against receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand. <b>It</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>useful</b> in the treatment of bone metastases.|$|E
5|$|An {{electroencephalogram}} (EEG) {{can assist}} in showing brain activity suggestive of {{an increased risk of}} seizures. It is only recommended for those who are likely to have had an epileptic seizure on the basis of symptoms. In the diagnosis of epilepsy, electroencephalography may help distinguish the type of seizure or syndrome present. In children it is typically only needed after a second seizure. It cannot be used to rule out the diagnosis and may be falsely positive in those without the disease. In certain situations <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>useful</b> to perform the EEG while the affected individual is sleeping or sleep deprived.|$|E
5|$|Behavioral therapy may {{be useful}} for chronic pain. There are several types available, {{including}} operant conditioning, which uses reinforcement to reduce undesirable behaviors and increase desirable behaviors; cognitive behavioral therapy, which helps people identify and correct negative thinking and behavior; and respondent conditioning, which can modify an individual's physiological response to pain. Medical providers may develop an integrated program of behavioral therapies. The evidence is inconclusive as to whether mindfulness-based stress reduction reduces chronic back pain intensity or associated disability, although it suggests that <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>useful</b> in improving the acceptance of existing pain.|$|E
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>may</b> also <b>be</b> <b>useful</b> for the handicapped, {{severely}} disabled, {{and sick}} children.|$|R

5|$|Stieger, Voracek, and Formann {{recommend}} that the task be administered twice, that the effects be calculated separately for first-name initial and last-name initial, that the task be accompanied with the birthday-number task, and that the instructions focus on liking rather than attractiveness. They suggest <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>useful</b> to use not just initials but all name letters for measuring implicit self-esteem, something which Hoorens says is her most important recommendation. The Letter Preference Task {{has been used to}} measure implicit self-esteem in contexts as diverse as depression, physical health, social acceptance, unrealistic optimism, feedback sensitivity, self-regulation, and defensiveness.|$|E
5|$|Several {{other uses}} have been {{researched}} for bupropion. There has been controversy {{about whether it}} is useful to add an antidepressant such as bupropion to a mood stabilizer in people with bipolar depression, but recent reviews have concluded that bupropion in this situation does no significant harm and may sometimes give significant benefit. Bupropion has shown no effectiveness in the treatment of cocaine dependence, but there is weak evidence that <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>useful</b> in treating methamphetamine dependence. Based on studies indicating that bupropion lowers the level of the inflammatory mediator TNF-alpha, there have been suggestions that it might be useful in treating inflammatory bowel disease or other autoimmune conditions, but very little clinical evidence is available. Bupropion—like other antidepressants, with the exception of duloxetine (Cymbalta)—is not effective in treating chronic low back pain. It does, however, show some promise in the treatment of neuropathic pain.|$|E
5|$|The tuatara has a third {{eye on the}} top of {{its head}} called the parietal eye. It has its own lens, a parietal plug which resembles a cornea, retina with {{rod-like}} structures, and degenerated nerve connection to the brain. The parietal eye is only visible in hatchlings, which have a translucent patch at the top centre of the skull. After four to six months, it becomes covered with opaque scales and pigment. Its purpose is unknown, but <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>useful</b> in absorbing ultraviolet rays to produce vitamin D, as well as to determine light/dark cycles, and help with thermoregulation. Of all extant tetrapods, the parietal eye is most pronounced in the tuatara. It is part of the pineal complex, another part of which is the pineal gland, which in tuatara secretes melatonin at night. Some salamanders have been shown to use their pineal bodies to perceive polarised light, and thus determine the position of the sun, even under cloud cover, aiding navigation.|$|E

25|$|Economically, {{electric}} heat can {{be compared}} to other sources of home heating by multiplying the local cost per kilowatt hour for electricity by the number of kilowatts the heater uses. E.g.: 1500-watt heater at 12 cents per kilowatt hour 1.5×12=18 cents per hour. When comparing to burning fuel <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>useful</b> to convert kilowatt hours to BTUs: 1.5kWh × 3412.142=5118 BTU.|$|E

25|$|Some special integrands occur {{often enough}} to warrant special study. In particular, <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>useful</b> to have, in the set of antiderivatives, the special {{functions}} (like the Legendre functions, the hypergeometric function, the gamma function, the incomplete gamma function and so on— see Symbolic integration for more details). Extending the Risch's algorithm to include such functions is possible but challenging and has been an active research subject.|$|E
25|$|There is a {{great deal}} of {{research}} into the use of miR-122 as a biomarker for hepatitis C. While some studies dispute its efficacy for diagnosing Hep C, other research indicates that <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>useful</b> in diagnosing specific forms of hepatitis. For instance, decreased levels of miR-122 have been linked to a strain of hepatitis C that is resistant to interferon therapy. In this case, measuring miR-122 levels in the bloodstream of hepatitis C positive patients would enable more accurate and personalized therapy for their disease.|$|E
25|$|Buspirone has no {{immediate}} anxiolytic effects, and hence has a delayed onset of action; its full clinical effectiveness may require 2 to 4 weeks to manifest. The drug {{has been shown}} to be similarly effective in the treatment of GAD to benzodiazepines including diazepam, alprazolam, lorazepam, and clorazepate. Buspirone is not known to be effective in the treatment of other anxiety disorders besides GAD, although there is some limited evidence that <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>useful</b> in the treatment of social phobia as an adjunct to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).|$|E
50|$|Guidance on its use and its {{extension}} to n x n tables {{have been provided}} by Munoz & Bangdiwala. <b>It</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> more <b>useful</b> than the more commonly used Cohen's kappa in some circumstances.|$|R
50|$|This {{measure is}} zero if {{and only if}} the state is fully product; therefore, it cannot {{distinguish}} between truly multipartite entanglement and bipartite entanglement, but <b>it</b> <b>may</b> nevertheless <b>be</b> <b>useful</b> in many contexts.|$|R

25|$|APCI {{generally}} suffers less ion suppression than ESI, {{as discussed}} previously. Where possible, if ion suppression is unavoidable {{it may be}} advisable to switch from ESI to APCI. If this is not possible, <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>useful</b> to switch the ESI ionisation mode from positive to negative. Since less compounds are ionisable in negative ionisation mode, {{it is entirely possible}} that the ion suppressing species may be removed from the analysis. However, it should also be considered that the analyte of interest may not be ionised effectively in negative mode either, rendering this approach useless.|$|E
25|$|Some, such as Laurie Mylroie, {{suggest that}} {{democracy}} and Islamic tradition are incompatible, and illiberal Islamists may {{be worse than}} the current authoritarian regimes (although she suggests <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>useful</b> for the United States to promote human rights and democracy {{in certain parts of}} the Middle East to oppose dictators such as Saddam Hussein). Others stress the compatibility of democracy and the Islamic notion of shura, or consultation, and say that Western and international donors should not hesitate to promote democracy as a means of encouraging Arab democrats and responsible governance practices.|$|E
25|$|The {{assumption}} that the free field is identically zero {{is the core of}} the absorber idea. It means that the radiation emitted by each particle is completely absorbed by all other particles present in the universe. To better understand this point, <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>useful</b> to consider how the absorption mechanism works in common materials. At the microscopic scale, it results from the sum of the incoming electromagnetic wave and the waves generated from the electrons of the material, which react to the external perturbation. If the incoming wave is absorbed, the result is a zero outgoing field. In the absorber theory the same concept is used, however, in presence of both retarded and advanced waves.|$|E
30|$|For {{functions}} {{with many}} inputs, <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> more <b>useful</b> to detect smaller, more manageable symmetries on {{a subset of}} inputs.
