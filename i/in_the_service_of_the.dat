Honour rolls in Canada were very popular, particularly immediately {{after the end of the}} war, although the decision on which names to include on them proved contentious: should accidental deaths, for example, be included? Where it was impractical to inscribe names in churches, usually due to the number of casualties and available space, books of names were often recorded instead.|$|E
5|$|Although de Lacy {{had spent}} time at Stephen's court, {{during the civil}} war that {{occurred}} during Stephen's reign, he switched sides and served Stephen's rival, Matilda the Empress. In 1138, he was besieged by the king at Weobley along with his cousin Geoffrey Talbot, but both men escaped when the king took the castle in June. De Lacy also led an army in an attack against Bath <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>service</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Empress, along with Geoffrey Talbot, which also occurred in 1138 and which some historians have seen as the opening act of the civil war.|$|E

5|$|Berlin {{was among}} the six light cruisers Germany was {{permitted}} to retain by the Treaty of Versailles. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>service</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> newly reorganized Reichsmarine, Berlin served as a training cruiser, starting in 1922. That year, Wilhelm Canaris {{was assigned to the}} ship, which went to Norway in November 1923. In January 1924, Berlin departed German waters for an extended overseas cruise, which was the first time a German warship had done so since the end of World War I. While on the cruise, Canaris met a naval cadet by the name of Reinhard Heydrich, who {{went on to become a}} close friend and eventual architect of The Holocaust. In 1928, Berlin conducted a training cruise around the world, which included a stop in Fremantle. Training duties lasted until 1929, when she was withdrawn from service. Starting in 1935, the Kriegsmarine used Berlin as a barracks ship in Kiel. There, she survived World War II; in the aftermath of the war, she was loaded with chemical weapons and scuttled in the Skaggerak to dispose of them, on 31 May 1947.|$|E
5|$|By 1805, {{during the}} War of the Third Coalition, the Polish troops in Italy had been renamed the 1st Polish Legion (1e Legion Polonaise) and {{attached}} to the Kingdom of Italy. In 1806, {{all that was left}} of the old Dąbrowski and Kniaziewicz's Legions was one demi-brigade, consisting of one infantry regiment and one cavalry regiment, now <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>service</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Kingdom of Naples. It fought at Castel Franco, turning the Austrian attack on 24 November 1805, but on 3 July 1806 it suffered a severe defeat at Sant'Eufemia a Maiella. Many Polish officers served in French army or allied formations.|$|E
5|$|Caesar {{served with}} the Mediterranean Fleet after a brief stint in the Channel Fleet. In 1905, she resumed service with a now re-organised Channel Fleet and was {{also part of the}} Atlantic Fleet for a time. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>service</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Home Fleet from 1907, she was placed in reserve in 1912. Following the {{outbreak}} of World War I, Caesar returned to the Channel Fleet before being transferred to the North America and West Indies Station in 1915 after a brief spell as a guard ship at Gibraltar. From 1918 to 1919 she served as a depot ship, firstly in the Mediterranean and Aegean Seas and then the Black Sea, in support of naval operations against the Bolsheviks. In this latter role, she was the last of the pre-dreadnought battleships to see service outside the United Kingdom. Returning to England in 1920, she was decommissioned and sold for scrap in 1921.|$|E

During his freshman year in college, he easily breaks a world track record, though he actually doesn't run at his full speed. While <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>service</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> French Foreign Legion in World War I, he traverses thirty-seven miles round trip in just thirty minutes (a speed of about 148mph); all while carrying 2,000 pounds of food, water, and ammunition for his unit. Despite his great strength, he is still susceptible to fatigue.|$|E
5|$|During the Winter of 1861–62, White was {{reassigned to}} the {{ordnance}} department {{and served in}} that capacity until 1863, when he was authorized to raise and command a battalion of cavalry. White formed the 41st Battalion Virginia Cavalry in September 1863 and continued {{to serve as the}} battalion's commanding officer until seven of its companies were consolidated with two companies of O'Ferrall's Battalion Virginia Cavalry to form the 23rd Virginia Volunteer Cavalry Regiment in April 1864. White was then commissioned as a Colonel in command of the cavalry regiment and served in that capacity until the unit disbanded in April 1865. White remained <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>service</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Confederate States Army until May 14, 1865.

Together with Józef Wybicki he was summoned again by Napoleon in fall of 1806 and tasked with recreating the Polish formation, which Napoleon wanted to use to recapture Greater Poland from Prussia. The ensuing conflict was known as the Greater Poland Uprising, and Dabrowski was the chief leader of Polish insurgent forces in it. Dąbrowski distinguished himself at siege of Tczew, siege of Gdańsk and at Battle of Friedland.|$|E

5|$|Following {{his capture}} in 1071, he was imprisoned. This incarceration lasted until 1087, when a guilt-ridden King William, in {{expectation}} {{of his own}} death, ordered Siward's release. Firm evidence of Siward's later life is non-existent, but some historians have argued that he took up {{a career in the}} Varangian Guard at Constantinople, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>service</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Emperor Alexios I Komnenos. The sources upon which this theory is based also allege that Siward led a party of English colonists to the Black Sea, who renamed their conquered territory New England.|$|E
5|$|George Frideric Handel {{was born}} on 23 February 1685 in the German city of Halle. It is unclear what initial musical {{education}} he received; his father, Georg Händel, was not a music lover, and did not at first appreciate or encourage his son's precocious talents. Nevertheless, {{by the age of}} ten Handel had become an accomplished organist; his playing in the royal chapel at Weissenfels, where his half-brother Karl was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>service</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Duke of Saxe-Weissenfels, impressed the duke, who persuaded Händel senior that the boy should have a proper musical education. As a result, Handel began formal study under Friedrich Zachow, the organist of the Lutheran church at Halle.|$|E
5|$|Goronwy ap Tudur Hen was Lord of Penmynydd and {{a soldier}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>service</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> English crown. He joined King Edward II of England for his {{invasion}} of Scotland in 1314 {{as part of}} the First War of Scottish Independence, which included service at the Battle of Bannockburn in June of that year. In 1316, a rebellion took place in Glamorgan under the leadership of Llywelyn Bren, at the same time Edward was campaigning in Scotland. Despite this there was little concern that it would spread to North Wales, with the royal officials instead concerned with the threat of invasion from Ireland. Some 1,500 troops were summoned from the area to support the King, and among those leading those troops were Iorweth ap Gruffudd, Gruffudd Llwyd and his cousin Goronwy ap Tudur Hen. After these troops, under the command of Gruffudd Llwyd, moved to Chester, they were dismissed on 4 August 1316 to return to North Wales {{in order to protect the}} area from the Irish threat.|$|E

5|$|He {{participated in}} many of the major {{conflicts}} of the 18th century, including the War of the Polish Succession, the War of the Austrian Succession, the Seven Years' War and the Anglo-Spanish War. His most famous achievement was the successful invasion of Minorca in 1781, in which he defeated a British garrison and returned the island to Spain, although his efforts the following year to recapture Gibraltar from the British were a notable failure. He ended his career <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>service</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Spanish Bourbon monarchy, which had been allied with France prior to the French Revolution, and died in Madrid.|$|E
5|$|His father Goronwy ab Ednyfed (d. 1268) was seneschal to Llywelyn ap Gruffudd (also {{known as}} Llywelyn the Last), the King of Gwynedd by 1258, {{continuing}} {{in the role}} until his death on 12 October 1268. In that role, Goronwy had followed {{in the footsteps of}} his father, Ednyfed Fychan, and by doing so had tied the fortunes of the early House of Tudor to those of Llywelyn. Goronwy led Llywelyn's military forces, and in February 1263 he took them as far south as Gwent in action against the Marcher Lords. Tudur ap Goronwy was one of three sons of Goronwy ab Ednyfed, alongside Goronwy ap Goronwy (also known as Goronwy the Younger or Goronwy Fychan) and Hywel ap Goronwy. Tudur Hen was not the first member of the family to be named Tudur: he was preceded by his uncle, Tudur ab Ednyfed, who had been <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>service</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> previous Prince of Wales, Dafydd ap Llywelyn.|$|E
5|$|Hugh {{was the son}} of Edward of Wells and {{elder brother}} of Jocelin of Wells, Bishop of Bath. Hugh's year of birth is unknown, but he was {{probably}} an old man at his death in 1235. The fact that he never left his residence from March 1233 until his death implies that he was impaired from old age. He first appears as a witness on documents of Reginald fitzJocelin, the Bishop of Bath in the late 1180s. After fitzJocelin's death in 1191, Hugh continued <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>service</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> next bishop, Savaric FitzGeldewin. By the end of the 1190s, Hugh was a canon of Wells Cathedral. Although Hugh's brother Jocelin was given the title of magister, implying that he attended a university, Hugh is never called magister, making it unlikely that he ever received much schooling.|$|E
