Cellular proliferation in response to IL-2 is clearly reduced by prior treatment of cells with mosquito salivary gland extract. Correspondingly, activated splenocytes isolated from mice fed upon by either Ae. aegypti or Cx. pipiens mosquitoes produce markedly higher levels of IL-4 and IL-10 concurrent with suppressed IFN-γ production. Unexpectedly, this shift in cytokine expression is observed in splenocytes up to 10 days after mosquito exposure, suggesting natural feeding of mosquitoes can have a profound, enduring, and systemic effect on the immune response.|$|E

5000|$|The {{history of}} the {{scientific}} discovery of climate change {{began in the early}} 19th century when ice ages and other natural changes in paleoclimate were first suspected and the natural greenhouse effect first identified. In the late 19th century, scientists first argued that human emissions of greenhouse gases could change the climate. Many other theories of climate change were advanced, involving forces from volcanism to solar variation. In the 1960s, the warming effect of carbon dioxide gas became <b>increasingly</b> <b>convincing.</b> Some scientists also pointed out that human activities that generated atmospheric aerosols (e.g., [...] "pollution") could have cooling effects as well. During the 1970s, scientific opinion increasingly favored the warming viewpoint. By the 1990s, as a result of improving fidelity of computer models and observational work confirming the Milankovitch theory of the ice ages, a consensus position formed: greenhouse gases were deeply involved in most climate changes and human caused emissions were bringing discernible global warming. Since the 1990s, scientific research on climate change has included multiple disciplines and has expanded. Research has expanded our understanding of causal relations, links with historic data and ability to model climate change numerically. Research during this period has been summarized in the Assessment Reports by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.|$|E

Grant and Littlejohn describe this as “transforming barren expanses of asphalt and frayed grass into exciting natural spaces for learning, playing and socialising” (2001, pg. 2). The benefits of greening projects have become <b>increasingly</b> more <b>convincing</b> to schools especially {{with the advent of}} supporting research and funding increases for this area (Sterling, 2001). This paper reports the stories (research) of 5 teachers experience with a recently developed program, Schoolgrounds for Learning which was designed and delivered by the Gould Group 1 (Cutter-Mackenzie, 2007). The teachers researched their schoolgrounds practice over 6 months. Teachers were given a research pack containing a journal, camera and research tips. All teacher researchers were also supported by a mentor (Monash researcher). The teachers’ research revealed significant insights and findings about the program and school greening projects more broadly. Their research showed that the program acted as a springboard leading to other sustainability initiatives, in addition to providing an impetus or driver for teacher enthusiasm, commitment and change in adopting environmental education / sustainability teaching and learning pedagogies. In short, the paper outlines the transformative effects of schoolgrounds approaches on teaching and learning and the social and ecological culture of schools...|$|R

Among 24 countries with good counterfactuals, changes in 15 were not significant but nine (38 %) showed significant reductions in infant mortality after democratisation.

40|$|A {{retrospective}} analysis of 38 patients undergoing radical radiotherapy for {{head and neck}} cancer (predominantly advanced oral or oropharyngeal carcinoma) compared our current practice of prophylactic Percutaneous Endoscopic Gastrostomy ("PEG") insertion for nutritional support {{with a group of}} historical controls. Results patients with prophylactic PEG missed no treatment due to radiation-induced morbidity whereas controls missed an average of 1. 83 days. Mean weight change in prophylactic PEG patients also differed significantly, with an increase of 0. 64 kg compared with a mean weight loss of 5. 5 kg for the control group. Serum albumin increased on average by 2 g/dl in PEG patients but fell on average by 3 g/dl in control patients. 33 % of control group patients required insertion of gastrostomies during radiotherapy because of inadequate ongoing nutrition. In view of <b>increasingly</b> <b>convincing</b> published evidence for the detrimental effect on tumour control from treatment delays, together with prolonged or delayed healing of radiation reactions from poor nutritional status, we now recommend PEG insertion as an essential and routine part of the radical management of locally advanced oral / oropharyngeal carcinoma...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Ecological and {{evolutionary}} considerations suggest that radiation hormesis {{is made up}} of two underlying compo-nents. The first (a) is background radiation hormesis based upon the background exposure to which all organisms are subjected throughout evolutionary time. The second and much larger component (b) is stress-derived radiation hormesis arising as a protective mechanism derived from metabolic adaptation to environmental stresses throughout evolutionary time especially from climate-based extremes. Since (b) >> (a), hormesis for ionizing radiation becomes an evolutionary ex-pectation at exposures substantially exceeding background. This biological model renders linear no-threshold theory in-valid. Accumulating evidence from experimental organisms ranging from protozoa to rodents, and from demographic studies on humans, is consistent with this interpretation. Although hormesis is not universally accepted, the model presented can be subjected to hypothesis-based empirical investigations in a range of organisms. At this stage, however, two consequences follow from this evolutionary model: (1) hormesis does not connote a value judgement usually ex-pressed as a benefit; and (2) there is an emerging and <b>increasingly</b> <b>convincing</b> case for reviewing and relaxing some recommended radiation protection exposure levels in the low range...|$|E
40|$|Breast {{cancer and}} {{melanoma}} metastasize predominantly via the lymphatic route. It {{has long been}} known that invasion into one or a few nodes draining the primary tumour, the sentinel nodes (SN), is the most important, early sign of dissemination. If no malignant cells are detected in the SN, dissemination is unlikely to be expected. For the last 10 years SN biopsy has become an important tool in staging cancers. Two kinds of tracers are used for SN detection: The blue dye, injected during operation, and radioactively labelled colloid, injected before operation. The lymphatic drainage can then be mapped by following the blue dye by visual inspection during the operation, and with gamma camera imaging before and probe detection during the operation. The variations in the tracers used, and the injection and imaging techniques are discussed. The pathologic examination has also undergone a rapid evolution with more detailed analysis including immunohistochemistry. The use of the SN technique has quickly spread worldwide for melanoma and breast cancer but is also being tested in several other cancers. Reports on the influence on morbidity and mortality reduction are becoming <b>increasingly</b> <b>convincing.</b> The near future of SN examination is finally briefly outlined...|$|E
40|$|Flavonoids are a {{group of}} phenoliccompounds that have beenidentified in fruits, {{vegetables}} and other plant foods, and {{have been linked to}} reducing the risk of major chronic diseases. More than 4, 000 distinct flavonoids have been identified, but many are still unknown and need to be identified before we can fully understand the health benefits of phytochemicals. More and more convincing evidence suggests that the benefits of phytochemicals in fruits and vegetables may be even greater than currently understood because oxidative stress induced by free radicals is involved in the etiology {{of a wide range of}} chronic diseases. Flavonoids commonly have a generic structure consisting of two aromatic rings (A and B rings) linked by three carbons that are usually in an oxygenated heterocycle ring, or C ring (Figure 1). Differences in the generic structure of the heterocycle C ring classify them as flavonols, flavones, flavanols (catechins), flavanones, anthocyanidins, and There is <b>increasingly</b> <b>convincing</b> evidence from in vitro, in vivo and epidemiological studies suggesting the benefits of flavonoids in fruits and vegetables in the prevention of chronic diseases because of their antioxidant, anti-cancer, and cardiovascular-protective effects...|$|E
40|$|We {{are exposed}} daily {{to tens of}} {{thousands}} of potential bacterial pathogens, through dermal contact, ingestion and inhalation. The system of innate immunity prevents these pathogens, in small to modest doses, from colonizing and growing to a point where they can cause life-threatening infections. The case for a primary role for antimicrobial peptides in innate host defences is becoming <b>increasingly</b> <b>convincing</b> (1, 2). In Drosophila, gene knockouts influencing the expression of antibacterial (imd) or antifungal (dif, insect NFkB) peptide expression render these fruit flies susceptible to subsequent infection (3). Similarly genetic inactivation of matrilysin, which is involved in processing 20 prepro-defensins to their active forms, renders mice susceptible to gastrointestinal infections (4), while chemical inhibition of neutrophil elastase, that prevents activation of cathelicidins (most of the non-defensin peptides) in pig skin wounds, substantially impairs clearance of both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria (5). In humans, a rare specific granule deficiency blocks a-defensin production and leads to frequent and severe bacterial infections (6). Conversely, delivery of excess peptide, either through adenovirus mediated overexpression of a cathelicidin gene (human LL- 37) in the mouse airways (7) or active administration of peptide (2, 6, 8) protects against infection and endotoxaemia...|$|E
40|$|Systemic {{sclerosis}} (SSc) is an {{autoimmune disease}} characterized by skin and internal organ fibrosis, caused by microvascular dysfunction. In recent years, {{the hypothesis that}} anti-endothelial cell antibodies (AECA) {{play a key role}} in microvascular damage seems to be <b>increasingly</b> <b>convincing.</b> In fact, AECA can induce antibody-dependent cellular apoptosis and stimulate the microvasculature to release pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic cytokines. Human-microvascular-endothelial-cells (MVECs) were stimulated with SSc sera (with and without AECA) and with sera from healthy donors. The conditioned MVEC culture media were then added to fibroblast cultures obtained from control skin (CTR), non-affected skin of SSc patients (NA), and affected skin of the same sclerodermic (SSc) patients, respectively. AECA contributed to the MVEC increased release of endothelin- 1 (ET- 1) in the culture medium and to MVEC apoptosis. Fibroblast (CTR, NA, and SSc) proliferation was increased after treatment with AECA-positive conditioned media, compared to AECA-negative and control conditioned media. Furthermore, both AECA-positive (in major contribution) and AECA-negative conditioned media were responsible for alpha-smooth-muscle-actin (αSMA) over-expression in all fibroblast cultures, compared to control conditioned media. Fibroblast type I collagen synthesis was upregulated by both SSc conditioned media (with and without AECA). Finally, the synthesis of fibroblast transforming-growth-factor-beta (TGF-β) was statistically higher in AECA-positive conditioned media, compared to AECA-negative and control conditioned media. These findings support the concept that AECA may mediate the crosstalk between endothelial damage and dermal-fibroblast activation in SSc...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} role of gaming engines in the {{architectural}} design process through the introduction of features such as immersion, interaction and collaboration. While traditional 3 D modelling and visualization systems such as 3 D Studio MAX and form?” offer <b>increasingly</b> <b>convincing</b> visual simulations, gaming engines are approaching the visual realism of such systems and are offering additional interactive features that are usually available only in more expensive immersive virtual reality systems. Additionally, the capability to have multiple individuals inhabit and navigate the space offers unique opportunities for collaboration {{as well as the}} investigation of human behaviour. Participants with internet access can be invited to access a shared virtual environment. Collaboration among users can be further enhanced by combining immersive navigation with peer-to-peer instant messaging and/or adding a voice channel. This paper analyzes these issues through research summary and the creation and user testing of a prototype based on a publicly available gaming engine. Through a series of assignments within an academic course, students in the school of architecture were asked to iteratively use and test this prototype for the collaborative exploration of designed environments. Students made their environments available for others to navigate in real-time and offer comments. A final design review was conducted in which critics were asked to enter the designed environment, explore it at will and interact with the student as well as others present in the same virtual space. This paper will illustrate some of the student projects and describe the immersive,...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background For almost 20 years, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change {{has been}} {{assessing}} the potential health {{risks associated with}} climate change; with <b>increasingly</b> <b>convincing</b> evidence that climate change presents existing impacts on human health. In industrialized countries climate change may further affect public health and in particular respiratory health, through existing health stressors, including, anticipated increased number of deaths and acute morbidity due to heat waves; increased frequency of cardiopulmonary events due to higher concentrations of air pollutants; and altered spatial and temporal distribution of allergens and some infectious disease vectors. Additionally exposure to moulds and contaminants from water damaged buildings may increase. Methods We undertook an expert elicitation amongst European researchers engaged in environmental medicine or respiratory health. All experts were actively publishing researchers on lung disease and air pollution, climate and health or a closely related research. We conducted an online questionnaire on proposed causal diagrams and determined levels of confidence that climate change {{will have an impact}} on a series of stressors. In a workshop following the online questionnaire, half of the experts further discussed the results and reasons for differences in assessments of the state of knowledge on exposures and health effects. Results Out of 16 experts, 100 % expressed high to very high confidence that climate change would increase the frequency of heat waves. At least half expressed high or very high confidence that climate change would increase levels of pollen (50 %), particulate matter (PM 2. 5) (55 %), and ozone (70 %). While clarity is needed around the impacts of increased exposures to health impacts of some stressors, including ozone and particulate matter levels, it was noted that definitive knowledge is not a prerequisite for policy action. Information to the public, preventive measures, monitoring and warning systems were among the most commonly mentioned preventative actions. Conclusions This group of experts identifies clear health risks associated with climate change, and express opinions about these risks even while they do not necessarily regard themselves as covering all areas of expertise. Since some changes in exposure have already been observed, the consensus is that there is already a scientific basis for preventative action, and that the associated adaptation and mitigation policies should also be evidence based. </p...|$|E
40|$|It is now {{generally}} accepted that urinary concentration is achieved via the countercurrent hypothesis of Wirz, Rargitay and Kuhn [I], as confirmed by Gottschalk and Mylle [2]. According to this hypothesis, the ioops of Henle {{serve as a}} countercurrent multiplier system to generate and maintain a medullary osmotic gradient which increases from the cortex {{to the tip of}} the papilla. In the presence of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), the isosmotic fluid which enters the medullary collecting duct achieves osmotic equilibration with the hypertonic medullary tissues as it flows through the medulla. As a result, the collecting ducts deliver a fluid to the renal pelvis which possesses the same osmotic concentration as that of the interstitial fluid {{at the tip of the}} papilla. There is general agreement that medullary hypertonicity results from the interstitial accumulation of solutes in excess of water. The driving force for this accumulation is provided by a NaC 1 extrusion pump located along the ascending limb of the loop of Henle. For the system to operate efficiently, the membrane of the ascending limb should be relatively impermeable to water as well as to sodium ions. These conditions are clearly met by the thick portion of the ascending limb since this structure delivers a fluid to the cortex which is markedly hypotonic as compared to the extratubular environment. Nevertheless, the question still remains unanswered as to whether the entire length of the ascending limb possesses the same properties. Jamisori et al [3] have found that, at the same level in the medulla, the osmotic pressure of fluid from ascending limbs is significantly lower than that from descending limbs. Most of this difference could be attributed to differing sodium concentrations; on the average, it was ten per cent lower in fluid from the ascending limb. Moreover, in a free flow perfusion study, Morgan and Berliner [41 demonstrated that the thin ascending limb exhibited a low permeability to both water and sodium. These observations are therefore consistent with the view that the thin and thick segments of the ascending limb deliver sodium in excess of water to the medullary interstitium. Under the influence of the delivery of sodium (and probably chloride) into the medullary interstitium in such a manner, the fluid flowing along the descending limbs will become progressively concentrated. The nature of the mechanism by which this increasing solute concentration is achieved remains uncertain. The existence of one of two processes can be postulated: 1) a net osmotic withdrawal of water from the tubular lumen to the hypertonic surroundings (countercurrent of water), or 2) a net addition of solutes from the interstitium to the lumen (countercurrent of solutes). As pointed out by Morel [5], the efficiency of the loop in the elaboration of a medullary gradient will be completely different under circumstances in which the first or the second process is predominant. Until recently, experimental evidence in support of the existence of the second mechanism seemed <b>increasingly</b> <b>convincing,</b> but the question has been reopened by the in vitro findings of Kokko [6] which suggested that the walls of the thin descending limb do not possess the required permeability properties, in opposition to most of the indirect [7 – 11] or direct evidence [4]. It is the purpose of this editorial to examine in detail the merits of each of the two hypotheses and to underline the physiological implications that arise from the existence of either of the proposed mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|The {{thesis is}} a {{political}} history {{and a history of}} ideas. It is an account of social feminism {{in the early twentieth century}} as it sought to extend the ideal of equality to the family and social citizenshp to women in their family roles. Although first-wave feminism has been seen as predominantlv concerned with equality in public life. I argue that women's position in the farmly especially as mothers raised questions for the women's movement whch were addressed in a number of ways. At a time when state solutions to social problems seemed <b>increasingly</b> <b>convincing</b> this contributed to a shift in the relationshp between families and the state and suggests that organised women's advocacy may have played a greater part in creatlng a political consensus for state welfare provision than has been recognised. Ths forms the context for social-liberal feminism after 1918, exemplified by the Edinburgh Women Citizens' Association. The papers of the EWCA add a new dimension to knowledge of the women's movement in the inter-war period. They show an ambitious autonomous women's organisabon active at a time when feminism is believed to have been in almost terminal decline. They gave a strong sense of what citizenshp meant to newly enfranchsed women and the purposes to whch thev wished to put their new rights: their view of a distinctive women's citizenship drew on both a Victorian tradition of women's activism and on ideas wbch had been developed in pre-war socialist feminism. As a claim to influence in previously wholly male fora it was embedded within the discursive strengths and limitatlons of women's traditional arenas of power/knowledge, family and morality. My approach to these issues is through an analysis of primary texts including The Economic Foundations of the Women's Movement (1914) by Mabel Atkinson and Women: An Inquiry (1925) by Willa Muir, and secondary sources, mainly from recent feminist scholarship. My discussion of the interwar women's movement in Scotland is based on the papers of the EWCA (1918 - 1939). The thesis reflects on approaches to political theory and to history and argues that categorisations of the political and of feminism create problems of analysis. Ths calls for a theoretical framework whch situates political ideas and strategy within the disourses of gender of the time rather than in a privileged position outside and counter to it: I draw on aspects of cultural theory to develop this argument. A problematic relationshp between familv interests and women's equality runs through, and is made visible through women's movement history. This opposition is formed by the dichotomous positioning of private and public and of difference and equality and hence of the categories family and state. Atkinson's articulation of the demand bv women for love (sexual relationships and children) and work (economic and personal independence) names a refusal to resolve tlus opposition through a separation between those women who marry and have children and those who have public careers. Attempts to renegotiate the gender settlement as it affects private and family life have proved to be a great deal more difficult to carry through than is creatng a greater role for women in the public sphere, hard though that also may be. The repeated identfication of feminism with equality as access to public life is a consequence of the relative success of arguments from equality, but questions about how a 'male standard' creates difficulties for women in public life continue to be relevant. Redrawing the conceptual boundaries whch form ths tension calls for not a reassertion of difference or equality- but a parallel assertion of both: that equality is brought to the family and that at the same time the differences associated with family and caring roles are insistently brought into public life. In conclusion I comment on how the opposition between family responsibilities and gender equality has become one of the 'self-evidences' of our age and that it poses one of the most central questions for philosophy and politics: how to reconcile social and indvidual interests...|$|E
