40|$|In this work, we {{examined}} the genotoxic effect of the antibiotic preparation <b>ipronidazol</b> (Gastrogal 10). An experiment was performed in vitro on human peripheral blood lymphocytes using the chromosome aberration and sister chromatid exchange tests. Clastogenic effects of <b>ipronidazol</b> were examined at three experimental concentrations (25 (g/ml, 50 (g/ml i 100 (g/ml) in eight experimental cycles. The results demonstrate that Gastrogal 10 {{has the ability to}} change the human lymphocyte kariotype, i. e. it induces numerical aberrations (aneuploidies and polyploidies), as well as chromosome gaps and breaks. Moreover, Gastrogal 10 induces a significant increase of sister chromatid exchange in human lymphocytes. The obtained results demonstrate that the examined preparation exhibits a certain genotoxic potential...|$|E
