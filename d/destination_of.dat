5|$|By the 1990s {{crime rates}} started to drop {{dramatically}} due to revised police strategies, improving economic opportunities, gentrification, and new residents, both American transplants and new immigrants from Asia and Latin America. Murder rates that had reached 2,245 in 1990 plummeted to 537 by 2008, and the crack epidemic {{and its associated}} drug-related violence came under greater control. The outflow of population turned around, as the city once again became the <b>destination</b> <b>of</b> immigrants from around the world, joining with low interest rates and Wall Street bonuses to fuel {{the growth of the}} real estate market. Important new sectors, such as Silicon Alley, emerged in Manhattan's economy.|$|E
5|$|Failing {{to reach}} their initial <b>destination</b> <b>of</b> Tobago due to light winds and strong currents, Low's {{depleted}} fleet made it to Grenada, a French-owned island.

Low, now commanding the captured sloop (renamed the Ranger), gave the schooner Squirrel to Spriggs, now his quartermaster, who renamed it the Delight before sailing away {{in the middle of}} the night with a small crew following a disagreement with Low over the disciplining of one of Spriggs' crew.|$|E

5|$|Neither Shepard nor Lovell {{expected}} {{there would}} be much difference between Apollo 13 and Apollo 14, but Apollo 13 went disastrously wrong. An oxygen tank explosion nearly resulted {{in the loss of}} the crew, and the moon landing was aborted. It became a joke between Shepard and Lovell, who would offer to give Shepard back the mission each time they bumped into each other. The failure of Apollo 13 delayed Apollo 14 until 1971 so that modifications could be made to the spacecraft. The target of the Apollo 14 mission was switched to the Fra Mauro formation, the intended <b>destination</b> <b>of</b> Apollo 13.|$|E

5|$|Reconstruction and rioting, {{coupled with}} the {{implementation}} of Jim Crow laws in Louisiana led most of the Turpeau family to leave the area and become professionals in the north.

Kelly born in Washington, D.C. was the first black woman bishop of the United Methodist Church.

5|$|Rich with sediments {{deposited}} by {{flooding and}} fed by prolific rainfall {{on the western}} side of the Cascades, the Willamette Valley {{is one of the most}} fertile agricultural regions in North America, and was thus the <b>destination</b> <b>of</b> many 19th-century pioneers traveling west along the Oregon Trail. The river was an important transportation route in the 19thcentury, although Willamette Falls, just upstream from Portland, was a major barrier to boat traffic. In the 21stcentury, major highways follow the river, and roads cross it on more than 50 bridges.|$|E

5|$|The Maltese {{position}} {{had already}} been severely weakened by {{the large number of}} Frenchmen who were part of the Order, who refused en masse to take up arms against Bonaparte. The French Revolution had already significantly reduced the Knights' income and their ability to put up serious resistance to Bonaparte was seriously compromised by a lack of resources. On 12 June, Bonaparte finally announced to his troops the <b>destination</b> <b>of</b> the expedition and on 19 June he sailed for Alexandria, initially steering east towards Crete. He left behind Vaubois and 4,000 men to maintain Malta as a base to control the Central Mediterranean. To ensure that news of the impending attack on Egypt did not spread ahead of the fleet, Brueys ordered that any merchant ships that sighted the convoy during the passage were to be seized and detained until his force had reached Alexandria. On 26 June, the British gained the first firm intelligence of French intentions, when the frigate HMS Seahorse under Captain Edward Foote encountered and captured the French frigate Sensible, which was returning to Toulon from Malta with a cargo of treasure and wounded soldiers, including General d'Hilliers. From these prisoners the <b>destination</b> <b>of</b> the French fleet was discovered and Seahorse, joined shortly afterwards by Terpsichore, sailed in pursuit, hoping to encounter Nelson.|$|E
