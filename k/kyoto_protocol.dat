40|$|This thesis {{examines}} public discourses concerning global warming. More specifically, {{it works}} {{to understand how}} the American media talks about environmentalism {{within the context of the}} <b>Kyoto</b> <b>Protocols.</b> This study is rooted in Foucault’s notions of power and discourse and also looks to the theoretical tenets of critical rhetoric developed by McKerrow (1989) and McGee (1990) {{to understand how the}} American debate over the protocols might create problematic approaches to environmentalism. These understandings may result from troubling articulations of ideographic fragments, which operate as texts in a postmodern society. As the <b>Kyoto</b> <b>Protocols</b> are set to expire, it is important to explore what influence the discourses surrounding Kyoto may have had. As the effects of humanity upon the environment become clearer, this study questions discourses that not only justify our impact, but may allow us to ignore it altogether. This thesis also contributes to the study of Environmental Communication. Consequently, this thesis examines discourses present in three popular American news magazines to observe how environmentalism is articulated in debates over the <b>Kyoto</b> <b>Protocols</b> and climate change.

The <b>Kyoto</b> <b>Protocol</b> is a treaty {{that is based on}} the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which was finalized in 1992 at the Earth Summit in Rio. It proposed to place the burden of protecting the climate on the United States and other First World countries.
