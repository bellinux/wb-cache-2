40|$|Special Operations Forces (SOF) have {{received}} significant emphasis {{over the last}} decade, as armed forces require highly trained and rapid <b>deployable</b> <b>forces</b> to deal with asymmetric threats. The South African (SA) Army identified {{the need for an}} SOF capability in its long-term strategy, and airborne forces form an important component in its envisioned Contingency Brigade. This article examines the utility of contemporary airborne forces despite the decline in major parachute assaults. It also explains the importance of airborne forces for South Africa with reference to its defence policy and defence commitments. The article concludes that an SOF capability will enable the SA Army to operate better across the conflict spectrum, including robust multinational peace operations in Africa, which mostly involve insurgencies. The article also argues that South Africa needs a balanced airborne capability before it can establish an SOF capability. The intended conversion of airborne forces to SOF will require considerable changes in training and doctrine. </p...|$|E
40|$|Macedonia’s {{accession}} to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) requires restructuring {{as well as}} modernization of the Macedonian Armed Forces {{in compliance with the}} NATO standards. Along with the outlined plan for the modernization of the Armed Forces within a timeframe that spans from 2004 - 2013 there is also a separate Strategic Defense Review (SDR). Its main task is to perform a thorough reassessment {{of the state of the}} armed forces and to outline the guidelines for their long-term development in conformity with the new security environment and the available defense resources. The upgrading of the communication/information systems will be one of the main focuses of the campaign, as well as strengthening the operative capabilities of the <b>deployable</b> <b>forces.</b> The modernization of the armament/equipment of the Army, and Aviation WNG. Development of Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Systems (C 4 ISR) is another priority. For the sake of development of the structure and capabilities, defense assumptions should be adopted most urgently, which relate to operational capability, readiness, scale of effort and concurrency for operations. The development of the structure of forces and capabilities should be in accordance with the requirements and structure of forces and capabilities established in this political framework, especially the priorities, missions of defense and tasks of Macedonian army.

40|$|Over {{the last}} 10 years, {{changes in the}} global {{strategic}} environment {{gave rise to a}} trend to equip armies with lighter, more rapidly <b>deployable</b> <b>forces.</b> Instead of armourd f rmati ns equipped mostly with 50 - 7 tonnes Main Battle Tanks (MBT), future armoured formations will be equipped mostly with 20 - 30 tonnes Light Armoured Vehicles (LAV). LAVs lack the protection of MBTs. It is the opinion of the Defence Science and Tehnology (S&T) community that Defensive Aid Suite (DAS) technologies can improve the protection of LAVs. A prototype DAS system was developed by DRDC – Valcartier and tested in field trials held in 1995 and 1999. This paper reports on the DAS field trial conducted in 1999 at the Canadian Forces (CF) Combat Training Centre (CTC) Gagetown (New-Brunswick, Canada). This field trial had two main objectives. The first one was to collect DAS data during a technical evaluation of the sensors and during simulated actical LAV operations. The second objective was to evaluate the impact of basic DAS prototypes on LAV survivability in a simulated laser threat environment. Analysis of field trial data demonstrated the effectiveness of DAS in protecting LAV. The DAS development program also provides the opportunity to use Modeling and Simulation (M&S) to guide technology development. To this end, a M&S program was launched in DRDC – Valcartier, and this paper also reports on the current status of this M&S program. 1...|$|E
40|$|As the Army conducts {{transformation}} {{in the midst of}} an ongoing information driven Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA) and the War on Terror, it has realized the need to develop leaner, more agile, versatile and <b>deployable</b> <b>forces.</b> As part of its latest transformation to Brigade "Units of Action," the Army realized the need to improve the "tooth to tail" ratio of its forces and transferred from a Cold War "Divisional" force structure to one focused around more deployable and sustainable Brigade Units of Action. Ironically, this transformation to what is suppose to become a more lean and deployable force structure has produced larger and more heavily staffed battalion, brigade and division command posts. Despite introduction of the Army Battle Command System (ABCS), a system of digital systems that are intended to help speed up the Army's ability to transfer information, improve situational awareness, make decisions, and out "OODA" (Observe-Orient-Decide-Act) its opponents, in many aspects the Army has actually taken a step backwards. The end result is that these larger command posts are becoming more hierarchical and bureaucratic, and are reducing the Army's ability to get ahead of the enemy's decision cycle. Platoon Leaders and Company Commanders in Iraq and Afghanistan constantly lament that "if they only had the information they needed 48 hours earlier," they could have captured the target. This study examines one small aspect of this tremendous problem, the architecture of the Battalion Tactical Operations Center (TOC). It analyzes the current information revolution, the contemporary operating environment, network centric warfare, other emerging Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA) concepts, and the current Battalion TOC configuration and doctrine. It then applies System Dynamics techniques and develops a set of heuristics to address the problem. The ultimate goal of this study is to develop a practical concept for an improved organization, structure and function of the command post. by Nathan A. Minami. Thesis (S. M.)
