5000|$|A Norway-built {{device called}} <b>Electronic</b> <b>Teleprinter</b> Cryptographic Regenerative Repeater Mixer II (ETCRRM II) {{encrypted}} the teletype messages. [...] This used the unbreakable one-time pad cryptosystem. Each country delivered keying tapes used to encode its messages via its embassy abroad. An {{advantage of the}} one-time pad was that neither country had to reveal more sensitive encryption methods to the other.|$|E
50|$|As Chairman & Managing Director of Hindustan Teleprinters Ltd (1984-1986) he {{successfully}} introduced <b>Electronic</b> <b>Teleprinters</b> in India {{replacing the}} old outdated model of Electro-Mechanical Teleprinters of 1961 vintage.|$|R
25|$|The {{transmission}} speed is {{a characteristic of}} the teleprinter while the shift (the difference between the tones representing mark and space) is a characteristic of the modem. These two parameters are therefore independent, provided they have satisfied the minimum shift size for a given {{transmission speed}}. <b>Electronic</b> <b>teleprinters</b> can readily operate {{in a variety of}} speeds, but mechanical teleprinters require the change of gears in order to operate at different speeds.|$|R
50|$|The Teletype Model 42 and Teletype Model 43 are <b>electronic</b> <b>teleprinters</b> {{providing}} character-at-a-time keyboard-printer send receive operation. The Teletype Model 42 is the Baudot {{variant of}} the Model 43, which is an ASCII teleprinter. The Model 43 has two transmission speeds, 100 words-per-minute and 300 words-per-minute, selectable by the operator to match the distant station speed. The Teletype Model 43 printer could print up to 80 characters per line using the friction feed printer option. Model 43 sprocket feed printers print messages with up to 132 characters per line using 12 inch wide sprocket feed paper. The tractor feed printer will print messages with up to 80 characters per line using 12 inch sprocket feed paper.|$|R
50|$|The Teletype Inktronic Terminal is an <b>electronic,</b> {{high-speed}} <b>teleprinter</b> {{that uses}} electrostatic deflection to print characters at 1200 words-per-minute. The Inktronic terminal prints an 80 column page using forty jets to print 63 alphanumeric characters in two columns on an 8.5 inch roll of paper. The Inktronic terminal {{was produced in}} KSR and RO versions. The KSR version can generate 128 ASCII code combinations while the RO version was available as a Baudot or ASCII printer. An ASR version was planned but not produced. When the Inktronic terminal proved unreliable and difficult to maintain, it was withdrawn from production.|$|R
25|$|Electromechanical {{teleprinters}} were heavy, {{complex and}} noisy, {{and have been}} replaced with <b>electronic</b> units. The <b>teleprinter</b> includes a keyboard, which is the main means of entering text, and a printer or visual display unit (VDU). An alternative input device is a perforated tape reader and, more recently, computer storage media (such as floppy disks). Alternative output devices are tape perforators and computer storage media.|$|R
