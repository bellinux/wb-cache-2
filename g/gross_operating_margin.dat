40|$|This work {{contributes}} to research on temporary employment, specifically through {{an analysis of}} its effect on firm efficacy. The authors analyze the potential curvilinear (nonlinear) relationship between temporary contracts and organizational outcomes and examine how the proportion of indirect temporary workers – hired through Temporary Help Agencies (THAs) – influences this relationship {{in a sample of}} 1597 Spanish manufacturing firms. The analysis finds a negative linear relationship between temporary contracts and labor productivity and a predominantly positive concave downward curve between temporary contracts and <b>gross</b> <b>operating</b> <b>margin.</b> This curvilinear relationship is especially stronger when the proportion of indirect temporary contracts is low, and it is found that the use of temporary contracts has a positive effect on <b>gross</b> <b>operating</b> <b>margin,</b> but this effect becomes negative with overuse. This empirical evidence partially questions the dominant linear view that has been established {{over the past few decades}} in the labor flexibility literature at an organizational level.

Linear regression is {{used to analyze the}} relationship between growth in revenue and <b>gross</b> <b>operating</b> <b>margin</b> (EBITDA) generated by the relevant operators and the aggregate industry in each country. At the industry level, it is shown that (i) there is a strong correlation between revenue and margin; and (ii) this correlation weakens when competitive intensity grows.

40|$|In {{this work}} we explore {{the effect of}} book value {{leverage}} upon some financial indexes, such as real growth, payment terms from suppliers and <b>gross</b> and <b>operating</b> <b>margins.</b> We explore if there is statistical evidence {{on the influence of}} the book value leverage level in the financial distress or bankruptcy costs that appear as measured by the worsening of those indexes. Four dependent variables were explored: <b>gross</b> <b>margin,</b> <b>operating</b> <b>margin,</b> real growth in sales and payment terms from suppliers. In order to estimate the financial distress and bankruptcy costs associated with each dependent variable, logarithmic and semi-logarithmic models were constructed using data panel. We used a balanced sample composed by 644 firms from the commercial Colombian industry, provided by the Superintendence of Societies of Colombia. We also examined an unbalanced sample of 683 firms with Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) analysis. We found that there exists a relationship between book value leverage perceived by the market and gross margin. This allows us to explore the possibility to introduce the financial distress costs in the cash flows. The aim of the study is to explore a model that allows the analyst to include this effect in the forecasted financial statements. When this effect is included in the financial statements the free cash flows will be affected and hence the interaction of cash flows, cost of capital (weighted average cost of capital) and firm value calculated with the cash flows will eventually allow determining an optimal capital structure. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the modelling {{and operation of}} a micro-multigeneration system composed of a natural gas internal combustion engine (ICE) -based micro-cogenerator coupled with a reversible electrical heat pump, and a small-scale photovoltaic (PV) plant. The system {{is connected to the}} external gas distribution system and the electrical grid. A specific analysis tool has been implemented to assess the operational conditions of the system components during a specified time period of analysis. An extended range of simulations has been carried out under different operating conditions and with different available technologies, taking into account the inputs given by the electrical, heating and cooling load of the building to which the plant is connected. On these bases, the calculation of the operating costs has been carried out through the calculation of the <b>gross</b> <b>operating</b> <b>margin,</b> also including fiscal discounts on part of the fuel consumption and possible incentives to the electricity production from the PV system.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{empirical evidence}} to support the theory that, in Italy, {{over the course of the}} past two years, even though a considerable slowdown in bank lending has been recorded, there has not been a credit crunch. After a first section dedicated to a descriptive analysis of the data, the paper presents an econometric estimation of the production sector’s demand for bank loans. An Error Correction Model (ECM) is used – estimated for the pre-crisis period (1998. Q 2 – 2007. Q 2) and applied both with the one and two step procedure – which considers lending as a function of the added value of the private sector, of the <b>gross</b> <b>operating</b> <b>margin</b> to nominal added value ratio (a proxy for self-financing) and of the real interest rate applied to loans. To test the robustness of the results obtained in the first specification of the model, we remove the assumption of weak exogeneity of the independent variables of the single equation model and construct a multivariate multi-equation model (VECM). All of the different approaches and methods adopted provided similar results: as expected, the demand for credit increases as real added value increases and decreases as the cost of lending and self-financing increase. The dynamic out-of-sample forecast of the model, relating to the two-year period of economic and financial crisis (2007. Q 3 – 2009. Q 2), shows that the actual loan stock remained well above the “theoretical” level forecasted on the basis of the functional relationships estimated before the crisis. This delta (which can be defined as “extra-credit”) is interpreted as the outcome of a rightward shift of the credit supply curve, rather than a leftward shift as would have happened in a credit crunch scenario. ...|$|E

Despite all these adverse signs, Lafarge-Holcim was successful in increasing cement sales volume and achieved synergies as result of the merge, quantified in 30 million of Swiss Franc, exceeding the sales target for the year. In a similar way, the EBITDA results, adjusted after the merge, restructuring costs and others events decreased 3 p. p in 2016 vs prior year.
