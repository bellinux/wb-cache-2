40|$|The {{relevance}} of gamma-ray astronomy {{to the search}} for the origin of the galactic and, to a lesser extent, the ultra-high-energy cosmic rays has long been recognised. The current renaissance in the TeV gamma-ray field has resulted in a wealth of new data on galactic and <b>extragalactic</b> <b>particle</b> accelerators, and almost all the new results in this field were presented at the recent International Cosmic Ray Conference (ICRC). Here I summarise the 175 papers submitted on the topic of gamma-ray astronomy to the 30 th ICRC in Merida, Mexico in July 2007. Comment: 24 pages, 12 figures.

40|$|When {{averaged}} {{over large}} solid angles, the cosmic ray intensity {{measured by the}} Fly's Eye reveals no statistically significant anisotropy. The sky is divided into 6 quadrilateral regions of equal solid angle which are centered on the directions of the galactic coordinate system's axes. For each of nine energy bands, we compare the number of detected cosmic rays in each region with the number expected from an isotropic intensity. Plots show the percentage deviations together with the statistical uncertainties. Introduction. Patterns in the arrival directions of ultra-high energy cosmic rays could provide information about {{the locations of the}} cosmic ray sources and/or properties of the magnetic field in our part of the Galaxy. An isotropic <b>extragalactic</b> <b>particle</b> population would produce an isotropic intensity within the Galaxy. This is a consequence of Lio ville's theorem and requires no specific knowledge of the magnetic fields in the Galaxy (Hillas 1972). On the other hand, i...|$|E

It focuses on galactic and presumably <b>extragalactic</b> <b>particles</b> in the energy range from the knee (10 ^ 15 eV) up to the highest energies observed (> 10 ^ 20 eV). Emphasis is put on observational results, their interpretation, and the global picture of cosmic rays that has emerged during the last decade.

50|$|Due to {{the very}} low flux of <b>extragalactic</b> cosmic <b>particles</b> {{received}} on Earth, {{little is known about}} their composition. Most estimates, based on theoretical and numerical models, predict that light atomic nuclei such as protons are the dominant particle type.|$|R
40|$|The 511 keV {{peak in the}} gamma-ray {{spectrum}} {{emitted by}} the Milky Way {{is caused by the}} annihilation of positrons and electrons, especially near the Galactic bulge. The annihilation takes place almost exclusively {{as a result of the}} forming of positronium. However, the sources providing the positrons are still subject of debate due in part to discrepancies in the morphology of the 511 keV radiation. In an effort to determine whether an extragalactic object, like another galaxy, could theoretically provide the Milky Way with positrons it is found that this possibility does certainly exist. Even the farthest known galaxy can theoretically function as a source. The biggest obstacle for <b>extragalactic</b> <b>particles</b> making it to the Milky Way is the InterGalactic Medium. This huge space separating galaxies considerably reduces the overall energy of any particle beam passing through it over large enough distances. Nevertheless it does not form an insurmountable hurdle. ...|$|R
40|$|There is {{an excess}} gamma flux {{from the general}} {{direction}} of the Galactic North Pole compared with that from the south when allowance is made for the contribution from CR interactions with the HI gas (Osborne et al., 1994). The extent to which it is in accord with the predictions of Wdowczyk and Wolfendale (1990 a,b) for gamma rays secondary to very high energy CR escaping from the VIRGO cluster is examined and it is claimed that the observations may well be of the order of those expected. Key Words : gamma rays: interpretation - gas, galaxy clusters, cosmic rays. I. INTRODUCTION Most theories of the origin of cosmic rays involve the presence of <b>extragalactic</b> <b>particles</b> above 10 18 eV or so. Certainly, if the majority are in fact protons then an extragalactic source seems inevitable. Many of the models involve active galactic nuclei (AGN) and insofar as the Virgo cluster is the site of one of the nearby strong AGN (M 87) it might be expected that some of the detected ultra high energy [...] ...|$|R
40|$|On July 28, 2006 the 6 -m {{telescope}} of the Special Astrophysical Observatory of the Russian Academy of Sciences {{recorded the}} spectrum of a faint meteor. We confidently identify the lines of FeI and MgI, OI, NI and molecular-nitrogen N_ 2 bands. The entry velocity of the meteor body into the Earth's atmosphere estimated from radial velocity is equal to 300 km/s. The body was several tens of a millimeter in size, like chondrules in carbon chondrites. The radiant of the meteor trajectory coincides with the sky position of {{the apex of the}} motion of the Solar system toward the centroid of the Local Group of galaxies. Observations of faint sporadic meteors with FAVOR TV CCD camera confirmed the radiant at a higher than 96 % confidence level. We conclude that this meteor particle is likely to be of extragalactic origin. The following important questions remain open: (1) How metal-rich dust particles came to be in the extragalactic space? (2) Why are the sizes of <b>extragalactic</b> <b>particles</b> larger by two orders of magnitude (and their masses greater by six orders of magnitude) than common interstellar dust grains in our Galaxy? (3) If extragalactic dust surrounds galaxies in the form of dust (or gas-and-dust) aureoles, can such formations now be observed using other observational techniques (IR observations aboard Spitzer satellite, etc.) ? (4) If inhomogeneous extragalactic dust medium with the parameters mentioned above actually exists, does it show up in the form of irregularities on the cosmic microwave background (WMAP etc.) ?Comment: 9 pages, 6 EPS figure...|$|R
40|$|We {{have argued}} [J. Szabelski et al. (2002) ] that the {{well-known}} `ankle' in the cosmic ray energy spectrum, at logE (eV) ~ 18. 7 - 19. 0, marks {{the transition from}} mainly Galactic sources at lower energies to mainly extragalactic above. Recently, however, there have been claims for lower transitional energies, specifically from logE (eV) ~ 17. 0 [G. Thompson et al. (2004) ] via 17. 2 - 17. 8 [V. S. Berezinsky et al. (2004) ] to 18. 0 [A. M. Hillas (2004) ]. In our model the ankle arises naturally from the sum of simple power law-spectra with slopes differing by ~ 1. 8; from differential slope - 3. 8 for Galactic particles (near logE = 19) to ~ - 2. 0 for extragalactic sources. In the other models, on the other hand, the ankle is intrinsic to the extragalactic component alone, and arises from {{the shape of the}} rate of energy loss versus energy for the (assumed) protons interacting with the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Our detailed analysis of the world's data on the ultra-high energy spectrum shows that taken together, or separately, the resulting mean sharpness of the ankle (second difference of the log(intensity*E^ 3) with respect to logE) is consistent with our `mixed' model. For explanation in terms of <b>extragalactic</b> <b>particles</b> alone, however, the ankle will be at the wrong energy - for reasonable production models and of insufficient magnitude if, as seems likely, there is still a significant fraction of heavy nuclei at the ankle energy...|$|R
40|$|This review {{provides}} {{an introduction to}} the radio emission by particle cascades, an overview on the various experiments, and explains methods for the radio measurement of air-shower properties. Furthermore, potential applications of the radio technique in high-energy astroparticle physics are discussed. Due to the successful operation of digital radio experiments and due to the improved quantitative understanding of the emission, radio detection is back on the list of promising techniques for extensive air showers. With a threshold of about 100 PeV radio detectors are particularly useful to study the highest-energy galactic cosmic rays and ultra-high-energy <b>extragalactic</b> <b>particles</b> of all types. Various antenna arrays like LOPES, CODALEMA, AERA, LOFAR, and Tunka-Rex have shown that radio measurements can compete in precision with other techniques, in particular for the arrival direction, the energy, and the position of the shower maximum. The scientific potential of the radio technique seems to be maximum in combination with particle detectors, which increases the total accuracy for air-shower measurements. This is crucial for a better separation of different primary particles, like gamma-ray photons, neutrinos, or different types of nuclei. In addition to air-showers the radio technique can be used for particle cascades in dense media. Several pioneering experiments like ARA, ARIANNA, and ANITA are currently searching for cascades induced by ultra-high-energy neutrinos in ice. Moreover, several future projects aim at both, high-energy cosmic-rays and neutrinos. SKA will search for neutrino and cosmic-ray initiated cascades in the lunar regolith and provide unprecedented detail for air-shower measurements. Finally, radio detectors with huge exposure like GRAND, SWORD, or EVA are being considered to study the highest energy cosmic rays and neutrinos.

40|$|The {{evidence}} for the anisotropy of cosmic rays from 10 (^ 11) eV to 10 (^ 20) eV is considered in detail from both a Galactic and extragalactic viewpoint and placed in astrophysical context. The importance of recent measurements of the local interstellar wind (consistent with a direction from (ɑ,δ) = (252 º, - 16 º) and velocity 21 - 23 kms(^- 1)) is noted. Cosmic ray streaming {{along the lines of}} the local Galactic magnetic field appears to account for the constant observed anisotropy of 0. 05 % at (1 - 2) hrs R. A. below l 0 (^ 14) eV. However, the distribution of cosmic rays does not appear to conform to the expectations of axial symmetry. Observational and statistical aspects of anisotropy are considered with particular reference to harmonic analysis. The results are used for analysis of the collection of data by Linsley and Watson which are shown to be inconclusive for anisotropy measurements in the range 10 (^ 14) eV to 10 (^ 20) eV. The power of using only phase or only amplitude information from collections of measurements is noted. Anisotropy measurements from 10 (^ 17) eV to 10 (^ 20) eV are considered and seen to favour a mixed origin model in which particles above ~ 10 (^ 17) eV are of extragalactic origin. The cosmic ray spectrum above 10 (^ 18) eV can then be interpreted purely in terms of an effect of <b>extragalactic</b> <b>particles.</b> Three models to account for the upturn in the cosmic ray spectrum at high energies are considered. A simple model in which neutrons escape from clusters of galaxies before decaying into protons is found to account for the observed spectrum if a source spectrum of the form j (E) (_x) E(^- 2. 25) is adopted. A model based on diffusion of particles from the Virgo Supercluster is seen to give a satisfactory fit to the dataif a diffusion coefficient of D(E) = 5 x 10 (^ 33) E(^ 1 / 2) (_ 19) cm(^ 2) s(^- 1) is taken. The model also accounts for the observed amplitude of the anisotropy above 10 (^ 17) eV. A model assuming production of high energy particles in radio galaxies is shown to be less satisfactory than the neutron or diffusion models...|$|R
50|$|Unlike solar or galactic cosmic rays, {{little is}} known about the origins of extragalactic cosmic rays. This is largely due to a lack of statistics: only about 1 <b>extragalactic</b> cosmic ray <b>particle</b> per square meter per year reaches the Earth's surface (see figure).There are many ideas about which {{processes}} may be responsible for cosmic rays with such high energies. In the 'bottom-up' approach, cosmic rays gain more and more energy through electromagnetic processes. Bouncing randomly back and forth in the shock waves of some violent object allows some of the particles to gain energy. Eventually they may build up enough speed that the object can no longer contain them, and they escape. Proposed sites for this type of acceleration include gamma ray bursts and active galactic nuclei. Indeed, recent analysis of cosmic ray measurements with the Pierre Auger Observatory suggests a correlation between the arrival directions of cosmic rays of the highest energies of more than 5×1019 eV and the positions of nearby active galaxies.|$|R
40|$|Forty {{years have}} passed since the first Explorer {{orbiting}} observatory - the 1958 mission used to discover the Van Allen radiation belts outside the atmosphere - ushered in the modern age of space science. Even though in situ observations of outer space are still restricted to measurements made within the solar system, we now have access {{to a wide range of}} cosmic signals, extending from the well understood microwave photons indicative of the earliest epoch of the universe to those apparently inexplicable ultra-high energy <b>extragalactic</b> cosmic ray <b>particles</b> that are too energetic (up to 50 Joules/each) to have survived passage through a cosmological extent of the pervasive thermal relic radiation field. In this lecture the extremes of cosmic ray physics are discussed within the context of particles having the lowest energy (down to ~ 10 ** 3 eV/nucleon) and highest energy (> 10 ** 20 eV), emphasizing those aspects of astronomy, particularly gamma-ray and x-ray, that appear to be especially revealing for these regimes.
