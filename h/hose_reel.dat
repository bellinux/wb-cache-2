25|$|While the {{traditional}} {{characteristic of a}} fire appliance {{was a lack of}} water pumping or storage, many modern TLs have a water pumping function built in (and some have their own on-board supply reservoir), and may have a pre-piped waterway running the length of the ladder which directs a stream of water to the firefighters at the top. In some cases, there may also be a monitor {{at the top of the}} ladder for ease of use. Other appliances may simply have a track-way which will hold a manually-run <b>hose</b> <b>reel</b> securely, and prevent it from falling to the ground.|$|E
25|$|The {{problem of}} {{organizing}} for protection against fire {{was not given}} much thought until 1874, when A.C. Young {{and a group of}} associates organized a hook and ladder company. Young was given City Council authorization to contract for a hand-drawn hook and ladder truck. The Council approved $450 toward the purchase of the new truck. It was built locally by M.A. Jones, and Huntington's first fire company was born. In 1874, the city council enacted an ordinance creating a fire department to consist of an Engine Company, a Hose Company, and the previously formed Hook & Ladder Company. Mr. S. Sexton was named fire chief, and the personnel was all volunteer. in May 1875 the city purchased a hand-operated engine and a hand-drawn <b>hose</b> <b>reel</b> from Portsmouth, Ohio, for $725. To provide a water supply for the department, large 500 gallon cisterns were made in numerous locations in the city. On August 5, 1875, the organization was complete and the department was ready for action. A tower bell for alarms was bought in 1875 and more cisterns were placed in 1876.|$|E

50|$|As fire {{fighting}} arrangement, {{the building has}} one 15-cm diameter riser feeding first-aid <b>hose</b> <b>reels</b> as well as fire extinguishers. For feeding the <b>hose</b> <b>reels,</b> there are two overhead tanks. Connected to the air-conditioning plant is two large vertical shafts located {{at one end of}} the building going up to the roof—one meant for the supply of conditioned air and the other for return air. These shafts are closed at the top except for a small vent. All the floors have false ceilings made of Sitatex boards on wooden frames. The space above the false ceilings is utilised as plenum with three horizontal ducts running through the length of the building acting as supply air ducts. The central duct is of galvanised iron sheets. The side walls, above which the glass facings are fitted, has several openings on the window sills, through grills which communicate with the side ducts in the floor just below. These openings are also for the supply of conditioned air. The plenum as well as supply air ducts connected with vertical shafts are provided with inspection doors made of timber which open out directly to the staircase landings on each floor. At each end, a staircase is provided. The lift shafts are adjoining the vertical air shafts at one end.|$|R
50|$|At {{that time}} there were two engine companies, a {{volunteer}} service, and only the driver and engineer paid. The city rented its buildings, {{and that was all}} the fire department there was. Now we have twelve engine companies in service and one in reserve, five hose companies and two chemical companies, making nineteen houses in all. and there are 128 men on the pay roll. We have eighty-five horses instead of the four we had in 1876, for at that time the <b>hose</b> <b>reels</b> were hauled by hand.|$|R
40|$|Nano-TiO 2 {{is widely}} {{applied in the}} {{automobile}} exhaust <b>hose</b> <b>reels</b> as a catalyst to reduce oxynitride emissions, including nitric oxide (NO). In the biomedicine field, NO {{plays an important role}} in vasodilation and edema formation in human bodies. However, the deswelling activity of nano-TiO 2 has not been reported. Here, we demonstrated that nano-TiO 2 can significantly degrade the production of NO in LPS-induced RAW 264. 7 mouse macrophages. Further study indicated that nano-TiO 2 exhibited an effect on vascular permeability inhibition, and prevented carrageenan-induced footpad edema. Therefore, we prepared a nano-TiO 2 ointment and observed similar deswelling effects. In conclusion, nano-TiO 2 might act as a novel deswelling agent related with its degradation of NO, which will aid in our ability to design effective interventions for edema involved diseases...|$|R
50|$|The TUS reel {{assembly}} (TUS-RA) {{is basically a}} large spool much like a garden <b>hose</b> <b>reel</b> that pays out cable when the MT moves away and rolls it back up as the MT returns {{to the center of}} the truss.

50|$|On April 20, 1886, the Jacksonville City Council {{passed an}} {{ordinance}} creating a professional fire department. The department initially consisted of 3 fire stations and 17 men.

5000|$|The 509th Air Refueling Squadron was {{activated}} at Roswell Air Force Base, New Mexico {{and assigned}} to the 509th Bombardment Group. [...] The squadron was the second air refueling unit in the United States Air Force, and was activated only {{three weeks after the}} 43d Air Refueling Squadron. The squadron initially equipped with Boeing KB-29M Superfortress tankers. These aircraft carried a system of <b>hoses,</b> <b>reels,</b> winches and fuel pumps to transfer fuel to the receiver aircraft. A power-driven reel for the refueling hose was installed in the rear fuselage at the position where the lower aft turret had been located prior to its removal. The KB-29M also had a cable and associated winch (known as the contact line) that was used to assist in the setup of the connection between the two aircraft.|$|R
5000|$|After several serious {{fires in}} 1890, {{with the loss}} of life of six firefighters in {{addition}} to loss of property, the Fire Brigades Act 1890 was passed with the aim of uniting these rival fire brigades. The first meeting of the Metropolitan Fire Brigade (MFB) board took place on 6 March 1891, and led to the disbanding of the then 56 volunteer brigades in Melbourne on 30 April 1891 with an invitation to firefighters to join the new organisation. On May 1, 1891 the Melbourne Fire Brigade became the main fire brigade in Melbourne. The first annual report of the MFB stated its strength as [...] "59 permanent firefighters, 229 auxiliary firefighters, 4 steam fire engines, 25 horse drawn hose carts and 58 <b>hose</b> <b>reels...</b> 33 horses and 48 stations". In 1891, the Brigade attended 816 calls and 485 fires, of which 188 fires were classified as serious.|$|R
50|$|There {{could be}} no doubt that, as a general {{possibility}} {{a fire in the}} cold store had reasonably been foreseeable; indeed, fire extinguishers and <b>hose</b> <b>reels</b> had been installed at various places within the building to guard against that eventuality. It was also true that the causes of fire were varied and many. It was nonetheless axiomatic that what was reasonably foreseeable had necessarily to be confined to those fires, whatever their cause, which fell within the parameters of reasonable possibility. What would, typically, have been reasonably foreseeable in this instance would have been the possibility of a fire starting somewhere in the building itself. What had actually occurred had been something entirely different. Simply to equate it, for the purposes of determining culpability, with just any fire could have the effect of attributing culpability for damage resulting from a danger which in truth had not been foreseeable as a reasonable possibility.|$|R
