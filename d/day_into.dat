He was joined in the squad by fellow Giro d'Italia stage winner Nieve, Martínez, Verdugo, Txurruka, Oroz, Isasi, Azanza and Cazaux.

The United States quickly mobilised an airlift of food, fuel and ammunition into Phnom Penh, but as US support for the Khmer Republic was limited by the Case–Church Amendment, BirdAir, a company under contract to the US Government, controlled the airlift with a mixed fleet of C-130 and DC-8 planes, flying 20 times a <b>day</b> <b>into</b> Pochentong.|$|E

5|$|Every {{driver of}} a CMV is {{required}} {{to keep track of}} his/her time with a log book or an ELD. A log book is simply a notebook with a grid pattern on every page, dividing the 24-hour <b>day</b> <b>into</b> 15-minute (1/4-hour) segments. Drivers are required to make carbon copies of each page, so one page may be kept with the driver (to be produced upon inspection by DOT officers), and so the other copy may be sent to the driver's employer.|$|E

5|$|Late in {{the evening}} of September 18, Karl {{attained}} Category3 status, becoming the sixth major hurricane of 2004. On September 19, Karl continued to strengthen, maintaining a well-defined eye, and strengthening late that <b>day</b> <b>into</b> a Category4 hurricane with winds of 135mph (215km/h) and a minimum pressure of 948mbar. Early on September 20, the storm weakened slightly {{as a result of}} an eyewall replacement cycle, weakening back to a strong Category3 hurricane. At this time Karl began to turn sharply northward into a weakness in the subtropical ridge.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time as the {{artillery}} bombardment at KSCB, an attack was launched against Khe Sanh village, seat of Huong Hoa District. The village, three kilometers south of the base, was defended by 160 local troops, plus 15 American advisers and heavy artillery provided from the base. At dawn of 21 January, it was attacked by a roughly 300-strong NVA battalion. Reinforcements were dispatched aboard nine UH-1 helicopters, but were wiped out after landing near the NVA, along with one helicopter. A small ground rescue force from the nearby combat base was repulsed, while the survivors from the village assault evacuated themselves to the combat base. The NVA fought throughout the <b>day,</b> <b>into</b> the next night, and finally completed the capture of Khe Sanh village at 09:30 on 22 January.|$|E
5|$|In his post-baseball career, Day {{worked as}} a {{bartender}} in Newark before returning to his hometown in Baltimore in 1970, where he held a position {{as a security guard}} until 1979. Before Day's death in 1995, there were numerous efforts to celebrate his career and induct <b>Day</b> <b>into</b> the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, a long-time dream of his. One such effort was made by Mayor Kurt Schmoke who declared January 31, 1992, Leon Day's Day in Baltimore. Governor William Donald Schaefer made a similar proclamation for Annapolis later that same year on May 10. Day's discreet demeanor and humble personality often understated his several accomplishments, most likely leading to him being overlooked by the Baseball Hall of Fame's voting committee. After falling short one vote of being inducted in 1993, Day was elected to the Hall of Fame on March 7, 1995. Six days later, Day died of heart failure while in hospice at St. Agnes Hospital in Baltimore; he was 78 years old.|$|E

5|$|Keeping {{track of}} a driver's HOS {{requires}} {{the use of}} a log book. A truck driver's log book is a legally defined form containing a grid outlining the 24-hour <b>day</b> <b>into</b> 15-minute increments. The driver must specify where and when he/she stopped between driving shifts, what duties were performed (if any), along with the driver's name, truck number, company info, and other information. The driver must also present his or her log book to authorities upon request, for inspection. In lieu of a log book, a motor carrier may substitute an electronic on-board recorder to record the driver's hours.|$|E
5|$|On December3, the Regional Specialized Meteorological Centre (RSMC) in Nadi, Fiji, {{upgraded}} {{a tropical}} disturbance, located {{to the west}} of the Solomon Islands, to Tropical Depression 04F. On December5, as the depression moved towards the west into the Fijian archipelago, both the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) and RSMC Nadi upgraded it to Cyclone Daman. On December7 the cyclone reached its peak intensity with winds of 185km/h, (115mph 10-minute sustained) which made Daman a Category 4 cyclone on the Australian Tropical Cyclone Intensity Scale. Later that day Daman also reached its peak intensity by 1-minute means with winds of 205km/h (125mph) which made it a Category 3 tropical cyclone on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. Early on December8, Cyclone Daman brushed by the Fijian island of Cikobia, causing damage to housing, crops and vegetation. Daman then weakened the next <b>day</b> <b>into</b> a tropical depression and dissipated on December10.|$|E

5|$|Throughout the {{following}} day, the US forces attempted to retake the lost positions {{in order to}} restore the integrity of their line. Fighting raged throughout the <b>day</b> <b>into</b> the early afternoon, by which time they had successfully recaptured several of the pillboxes, supported by mortar fire. In the evening, the Americans used indirect fire and searchlights to harass the Japanese, but by early morning, just before dawn, they struck again, and captured another pillbox. As morning progressed, the US commander requested tank support and four tanks from the 754th Tank Battalion were dispatched. In the meantime, minor counterattacks succeeded in regaining part of the line; by mid-morning the tanks joined the fighting and several more positions were retaken by the US troops in several attacks before and after lunch. Having run out of ammunition and running low on fuel, {{the first group of}} tanks was withdrawn and replaced with a fresh platoon of tanks with which the attack was resumed in the mid-afternoon. Fighting continued throughout the day until 7:30pm when the Japanese retired from the position for the evening, having been forced to give up all of their earlier gains by a determined American counterattack.|$|E

25|$|The {{band was}} heavily {{inspired}} by Metallica and Megadeth, since {{they started out}} by covering them, as well as Carcass, Death, hard rock, classical music, thrash metal. The Quo Vadis Demo and Forever... featured violin interludes and female operatic vocals, but by the band abandoned these for <b>Day</b> <b>into</b> Night as both those things had become prevalent in metal music, according to the band members. <b>Day</b> <b>into</b> Night was more aggressive and technical than the band's previous offerings, partially due to improved musicianship. Also, guitarist and vocalist Arie was taking guitar lessons from Alex Skolnick of Testament and as a result, he played a few solos on <b>Day</b> <b>into</b> Night and added a Testament influence to the band. One of Bart's biggest influences is Chuck Schuldiner, and Gene Hoglan's playing on Individual Thought Patterns and Sean Reinert's playing on Human are two of Yanic's biggest influences. The album Defiant Imagination features two songs written about Chuck which are also dedicated to him. For bass duties on Defiant Imagination, Bart had contacted Steve Di Giorgio who had played on Death's Individual Thought Patterns.|$|E
