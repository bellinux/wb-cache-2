5|$|In the 1950s, the Denver & Rio Grande Western {{began to}} phase out steam {{locomotives}} in favor of diesel locomotives, which require less maintenance. With the change in technology, Thistle <b>faded</b> <b>in</b> importance. Gradually the town shrank in population; the passenger depot was torn down in 1972 and the post office closed in 1974. By 1983, only a few families remained in Thistle.|$|E
5|$|Producer Algy Williams hired {{a team of}} {{multimedia}} artists and programmers to help Horse develop Drowned God. Upon its release, the game sold well, but it quickly <b>faded</b> <b>in</b> popularity due to bugs {{and a lack of}} patches. Drowned Gods concept and visuals were widely praised, while its gameplay, audio, and puzzles received more varied responses. A planned sequel never came to fruition.|$|E

5|$|Arsenal's {{dominance}} of the decade was sealed with a second FA Cup in 1935–36, winning 1–0 against Sheffield United with a goal from Drake. Arsenal <b>faded</b> <b>in</b> the League somewhat after the 1934–35 title, and were weakened by the retirement of Alex James and the club's inability to replace him, as well as long-term injuries to several other key players such as Herbie Roberts and Joe Hulme. Nevertheless, they won a fifth League title in 1937–38, pipping Wolves {{on the final day}} of the season, to cap off a highly successful decade.|$|E
5|$|In 1885, a nova-like {{outburst}} {{was observed}} {{in the direction of}} the Andromeda galaxy by Ernst Hartwig in Estonia. S Andromedae increased to 6th magnitude, outshining the entire nucleus of the galaxy, then <b>faded</b> <b>in</b> a manner much like a nova. In 1917, George W. Ritchey measured the distance to the Andromeda Galaxy and discovered it lay much farther than had previously been thought. This meant that S Andromedae, which did not just lie along the line of sight to the galaxy but had actually resided in the nucleus, released a much greater amount of energy than was typical for a nova.|$|E

Previous models have assumed that either the solvent or the lithium {{plays a key role in}} the film formation reaction which drives the capacity <b>fading</b> <b>in</b> lithium ion batteries. The current model postulates that the solvent species and lithium ions could play a limiting role <b>in</b> the capacity <b>fade</b> <b>in</b> a lithium ion battery. The model studies the concentration profiles of the solvent species and lithium ions at the electrode/film interphase as a function of diffusion and migration parameters.

5|$|On Christmas Day 1957, Graves gave Starkey a {{second-hand}} drum kit {{consisting of}} a snare drum, bass drum and a makeshift cymbal fashioned from a rubbish bin lid.

5|$|The series {{started in}} a {{controversial}} fashion, {{with the first}} Test at Sabina Park being abandoned after the pitch was deemed to be too dangerous due to its highly irregular bounce. As {{a result of this}} abandoned match, an additional match was arranged with the series thereby being extended to six Tests. Two close matches followed, after which the teams were level at 1–1. England <b>faded</b> <b>in</b> {{the second half of the}} series. The West Indies scored two decisive victories, winning the fourth by 242 runs and the last by an even wider margin of an innings and 52 runs, to take the series 3–1.|$|E
5|$|Another legend narrated in the Arakanese chronicle {{relates to}} the nine {{phenomena}} that occurred when the image was consecrated in the temple and continued to occur after the Buddha had departed. These nine phenomena were: holy water used for washing the image would not overflow the collecting vessels; {{the water from the}} tank that was used for washing the Buddha's head would retain its quality throughout the year; six coloured rays appeared when the devotees worshipped the image in the evenings; the rays <b>faded</b> <b>in</b> the presence of non-believers; the space in the temple would automatically accommodate any number of devotees; the leaves of trees would tilt {{in the direction of the}} Buddha image; birds would not fly over the temple; and the stone guardians at the entrance would sense the presence of evil doers and prevent them from entering the temple.|$|E
5|$|At the 2009 World Aquatics Championships, held in Rome, Soni set a meet {{record in}} the heats of the 100-meter breaststroke, {{with a time of}} 1:05.66. In the semi-final, Soni {{recorded}} a time of 1:04.84 to set a new world record and become the first female to finish under 1:05 for the event. In the final of the 100-meter breaststroke, Soni won the gold with a time of 1:04.93. Despite being the favorite in the 200-meter breaststroke, Soni went out too fast {{in the first half of}} the race and <b>faded</b> <b>in</b> the final meters, ultimately placing fourth. In the 50-meter breaststroke, Soni was narrowly beaten for the gold and the world record by two one-hundredths (0.02) of a second by Russian swimmer Yuliya Yefimova.|$|E

30|$|Concerning {{multipath}} <b>fading</b> <b>in</b> dynamic scenarios, {{one should}} use Nakagami distribution {{as it can}} represent all cases; a nearly Rice <b>fading</b> <b>in</b> the CP channel and Rayleigh <b>fading</b> <b>in</b> the XP channel is observed. For the CP channel, values of the shape parameter between 1.2 and 1.3 are suitable for the QLoS and NLoS cases, whereas the value for the LoS case can significantly differ between quasi- and true-dynamic scenarios, i.e. between 4.3 for the former and 19 for the latter. For the XP channel, values between 0.9 and 1.2 could be suitable for the shape parameter in either propagation conditions or user dynamics. Similarly, the subtle differences observed between corresponding values of the scale parameter suggest that values 1.6 and 1.9 will in general provide a satisfactory representation of the multipath <b>fading</b> <b>in</b> this channel.|$|R
5|$|Etymologiae was {{the most}} used {{textbook}} throughout the Middle Ages. It was so popular that it was read in place {{of many of the}} original classical texts that it summarized, so these ceased to be copied and were lost. It was cited by Dante Alighieri, who placed Isidore in his Paradiso, quoted by Geoffrey Chaucer, and mentioned by the poets Bocaccio, Petrarch and John Gower. Among the thousand-odd surviving manuscript copies is the 13th-century Codex Gigas; the earliest surviving manuscript, the Codex Sangallensis, preserves books XI to XX from the 9th century. Etymologiae was printed in at least ten editions between 1472 and 1530, after which its importance <b>faded</b> <b>in</b> the Renaissance. The first scholarly edition was printed in Madrid in 1599; the first modern critical edition was edited by Wallace Lindsay in 1911.|$|E
5|$|In 1927, Macaulay took 130 wickets at {{an average}} of 18.26. However, he {{suffered}} a foot injury in 1928, and took time to recover his best form. His wicket tally fell to 120 and his average climbed to 24.37. His total of wickets decreased further to 102 in 1929 and his average remained above 20. Hampered by another foot injury throughout 1930, Macaulay failed to take 100 wickets {{for the first time since}} his debut season; his average of 25.12 was the highest of his career. In these seasons, he was only selected for one representative match, a Test trial in 1928 in which he failed to take a wicket. At the same time, his batting <b>faded.</b> <b>In</b> 1927, Macaulay scored his highest run aggregate and passed fifty six times while hitting 678 runs {{at an average}} of 25.11. He improved his batting average in 1928, accumulating 517 runs at 25.85 with four more fifties. However, after 1928, he never averaged more than 16.26 with the bat and only scored two more fifties in his career, both in 1929.|$|E

The Prince {{served in the}} Low Countries in the War of the First Coalition, under his elder brother Frederick, Duke of York, then commander of the combined British, Hanoverian, and Austrian forces. Seeing action near the Walloon town of Tournai in August 1793, he sustained a sabre wound to the head, {{which resulted in a}} disfiguring scar. During the Battle of Tourcoing in northern France on 18 May 1794 his left arm was injured by a cannonball which passed close by him. In the days after the battle, the sight in his left eye <b>faded.</b> <b>In</b> June, he was sent to Britain to convalesce, his first stay there since 1786.|$|E

5|$|In the final, Australia made a poor start; Dawn Fraser almost {{stopped when}} she heard a second gunshot, believing that a false start had occurred. She {{finished}} her leg in 1 minute 4.0 seconds, two seconds slower than the world record she set in the individual 100-metre final, but with a 2.3-second lead over the United States' Sylvia Ruuska. Nevertheless, this meant that Australia had a smaller than expected advantage.

5|$|The image {{illustration}} and logo {{design was}} done by Yoshitaka Amano, who was brought on {{at the beginning of}} the game's production and designged the logo based on the game's themes. Several pieces of Amano's original artwork were retained and used in promotion when the game changed from Versus XIII to XV. In contrast to other major parts of the game, the logo artwork survived almost unchanged aside from its coloring. Amano also designed a new version of the logo that <b>faded</b> <b>in</b> during the game's ending, collaborating with the development team on its use. According to Tabata, the new logo signified the beginning of a new journey, and also representing the game's development since it was known as Versus XIII.|$|E
5|$|After relegation, {{the club}} {{underwent}} off-the-field upheaval, with new chairman David Bernstein introducing greater fiscal discipline. Under manager Joe Royle, City were promoted {{at the first}} attempt, achieved in dramatic fashion in a play-off against Gillingham. A second successive promotion saw City return to the top division, but this proved {{to have been a}} step too far for the recovering club, and in 2001 City were relegated once more. Kevin Keegan replaced Royle as manager in the close season, and achieved an immediate return to the top division as the club won the 2001–02 Division One championship, breaking club records for the number of points gained and goals scored in a season in the process. The 2002–03 season was the last at Maine Road, and included a 3–1 derby victory over rivals Manchester United, ending a run of 13 years without a derby win. City also qualified for European competition {{for the first time in}} 25 years. In the 2003 close season, the club moved to the new City of Manchester Stadium. The first four seasons at the stadium all resulted in mid-table finishes. Former England manager Sven-Göran Eriksson became the club's first manager from overseas when appointed in 2007. After a bright start, performances <b>faded</b> <b>in</b> the second half of the season, and Eriksson was sacked in June 2008. Eriksson was replaced by Mark Hughes two days later on 4 June 2008.|$|E
