With {{the arrival of the}} new soldiers, the allied soldiers were encouraged and began bombarding the city again with their siege engines while the Rhodian and Pergamese fleet continued to put pressure on the Spartans from the sea. The Spartans knew that they did not <b>have</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> chance of withstanding the renewed allied assault and Gorgopas decided to surrender the city to the Romans under the condition that the garrison was allowed to leave the city unharmed.|$|E

Many plantation owners had already fled to distant interior refuges, sometimes taking their slaves with them.|$|E
25|$|Even {{though the}} Roman Republic contributed {{significantly}} to many aspects of democracy, {{only a minority of}} Romans were citizens with votes in elections for representatives. The votes of the powerful were given more weight through a system of gerrymandering, so most high officials, including members of the Senate, came from a few wealthy and noble families. In addition, the Roman Republic was the first government in the western world to have a Republic as a nation-state, although it didn't <b>have</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> democracy. The Romans invented the concept of classics and many works from Ancient Greece were preserved. Additionally, the Roman model of governance inspired many political thinkers over the centuries, and today's modern representative democracies imitate more the Roman than the Greek models because it was a state in which supreme power was held by the people and their elected representatives, and which had an elected or nominated leader. Other cultures, such as the Iroquois Nation in the Americas between around 1450 and 1600 AD also developed a form of democratic society before they came in contact with the Europeans. This indicates that forms of democracy may have been invented in other societies around the world.|$|E

Angela Shapiro, president of ABC, said, [...] "I was insensitive and take total responsibility for it. I should have been sensitive {{to the history of}} the character and I wasn't". Another ABC executive stated, [...] "We didn't exercise proper sensitivity to the history of the character of Todd. [...] We have re-evaluated and decided not to sell the doll".

500|$|Cleveland {{began the}} season with a 30–14 win over the Buffalo Bills. The Browns got out to a fast start, scoring two touchdowns in the first quarter and adding two more in the second while holding the Bills scoreless. Buffalo came back in the third quarter, scoring two touchdowns of its own, but Cleveland held its lead. Browns coach Paul Brown criticized the {{performance}} after the game, saying the team had failed to keep pace in the second half after he rotated in some of his younger players. [...] "We got a good head of steam and took a commanding lead {{in the first half and}} then let down and looked bad in the last two periods," [...] he said. Buffalo quarterback George Ratterman felt pressure from Cleveland's defense the whole game, and said the Browns were better than the Chicago Bears, who had won the 1946 NFL Championship Game the previous season. [...] "Their line rushed me all night long and I didn't <b>have</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> chance to get the ball away accurately," [...] Ratterman said. [...] "I think the Browns are much better than the Bears, especially their line." [...] Placekicker Lou Groza had his extra point blocked after the Browns' first touchdown.

Clark Collis of Entertainment Weekly {{explained}} that [...] "the song has been covered by other artists with an enthusiasm only matched in recent times by musicians’ desire to remake Radiohead’s 'Creep' in their own image". On December 8, 2008, New Zealand singer Ladyhawke performed a cover at BBC Radio 1's Live Lounge. The song was covered by American band The All-American Rejects on the Yahoo! Music Pepsi Smash show in December 2008. It was performed in an acoustic version, in which the band members played percussions with beer bottles. The cover also included an excerpt from The Turtles's [...] "Happy Together". British [...] singer Lily Allen also covered the song, because [...] "simple really, I love Britney and I love the song". Her cover was a stripped down version, that according to Nick Levine of Digital Spy, [...] "might provoke those who reckon it doesn't <b>have</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> chorus to revise their opinion". Allen also performed the song as the encore during her 2009 tour. French singer Sliimy cover was deemed as an [...] "indie makeover".

She praised Neal Bledsoe's portrayal of Stephen Burkett, saying that he did a [...] "wonderful job of playing a chronic hair puller". She also praised the character of Curtis, stating that he was [...] "adorable". Of the storyline she said, [...] "The actual murder by electrocution was an interesting twist and one I didn't see coming. I was happy to see Bud jump in and read the murderer her rights before she said anything further. That certainly seemed like something a detective should do". She finished in saying that she [...] "enjoyed" [...] the song played at the end of the episode, 'Maybe' by Ingrid Michaelson [...] "was both cheery and melancholy enough to fit the moment". Michelle Carlbert from TV Equals praised the scene in which Megan pulls Colin's hair, calling it one of her [...] "favourite bits", another being when it showed Ethan, Peter, Curtis and Bud going out on a [...] "Boy’s Night" [...] stating it was [...] "awesome" [...] and that she [...] "love(s) it when they show the team bonding like that".

500|$|The mystery {{surrounding}} Mary Alice and {{her family}} was the main storyline in the first season of the series, and it is resolved in the first season finale. Cherry had wanted {{there to be a}} [...] "definite end" [...] to the mystery, hoping to avoid similar viewer fatigue that Twin Peaks suffered after drawing out its central mystery past its first season. ABC executives initially protested the writers' decision to have Mary Alice purposefully kill [...] Deirdre Taylor (Jolie Jenkins), the woman whose child she had illegally purchased, prompting the writers to make Deirdre violent in order to justify Mary Alice's actions. Although Mary Alice {{and her family}} do not <b>have</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> leading storyline thereafter, the mystery surrounding the character's suicide in the inaugural season is said to have informed and influenced every other season of the series. In 2006, when asked during an interview what viewers could expect from Mary Alice for the series' third season, Strong said that the character was [...] "going to be back with an attitude", stating: [...] "She will be a little less surreal, ethereal and a little more sassy, which means the show is going to be sassier." [...] During the series' final season in 2011, the actress appears as Mary Alice's ghost to her suicidal friend Bree (Marcia Cross). Strong enjoyed filming that particular scene, as it was the only scene during the entire series that featured solely Mary Alice and Bree. She described the scene as one of her personal favorites and called it an [...] "extraordinary opportunity", saying: [...] "In a way, Mary Alice becomes [...] conscious and her guide and her muse in knowing what to do with her life. And it was an exquisitely written scene and it was really, I think in my experience on the show, one of my favorite scenes I have ever shot." ...|$|E

The Rebel's [...] "clean but mundane styling" [...] is a minus for collector appeal, but Carl Cameron, an automobile designer at Chrysler and developer of the original Dodge Charger fastback, mentioned that the best competitors during the late 1960s were the AMCs with new engines and the Rambler Rebels were [...] "really nice, very hot cars", but the company just did not <b>have</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> presence in the marketplace.|$|E

2500|$|The tanegashima {{seems to}} have been based on snap matchlocks that were {{produced}} in Portuguese Malacca, at the armory of Malacca (a colony of Portugal since 1511). The name tanegashima came from the Japanese island (Tanegashima) where a Chinese junk with Portuguese adventurers on board was driven to anchor by a storm in 1543. The lord of the Japanese island, Tanegashima Tokitaka (1528–1579), purchased two matchlock muskets from the Portuguese and put a swordsmith to work copying the matchlock barrel and firing mechanism. The smith (Yaita) did not <b>have</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> problem with most of the gun but [...] "drilling the barrel helically so that the screw (bisen bolt) could be tightly inserted" [...] was a major problem as this [...] "technique did apparently not exist in Japan until this time." [...] The Portuguese fixed their ship and left the island and only in the next year when a Portuguese blacksmith was brought back to Japan was the problem solved. Within ten years of its introduction, over 300,000 tanegashima firearms were reported to have been manufactured.|$|E

In January 2011, he reiterated that it would be his final season, explaining that in the past there was the possibility that maybe he would reconsider.

He retired after the Lakers were swept out of the playoffs in the conference semifinals by that season's eventual NBA champions, the Dallas Mavericks, meaning that he would not get a fourth three-peat (after previously achieving that feat in 1993, 1998 and 2002).

2500|$|Scorpion's {{signature}} special move {{throughout the}} series has him hurling a harpoon-like spear (described as a kunai) at his opponents, {{making him the}} only other character besides Kano to have a physical weapon in the original MK game. The spear, attached to a length of rope, impales his opponents through the chest and sets them up for a free hit as Scorpion then jerks on the rope to pull them in to close range. His other incumbent special throughout the series, save for Deadly Alliance, has been his Teleport Punch, where he flies offscreen during battle and then reappears to strike his opponent from behind. Scorpion additionally gained a new leg-takedown maneuver in MKII that was not well-received (Sega Saturn Magazine called it a [...] "ridiculous" [...] move that [...] "no one ever used"). He was considered a lower-tier character by GamePro in their 1993 MKII character rankings, rating him eighth out of the game's twelve playables and describing both him and Sub-Zero as [...] "formerly a top-tier character [...] doesn’t <b>have</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> chance in MKII since all of the male ninjas have some poor matchups," [...] with Scorpion faring the worst against Jax and Mileena. Ed Lomas of Sega Saturn Magazine described the character as having [...] "simple yet effective" [...] special moves in UMK3 that [...] "make him good for beginners, [...] doesn't stop him from being a useful character," [...] while his [...] "trusty" [...] spear was [...] "perfect for setting up combos." [...] GameSpy, in their Deception walkthrough, described the character as [...] "a well-rounded character that has strengths in combos {{as well as in}} special and normal moves." [...] They additionally described the spear as [...] "useful as ever" [...] in Armageddon, adding, [...] "Between [...] other special moves ... Scorpion pretty much has everything covered." [...] Prima Games' MK2011 strategy guide considered Scorpion to be well-balanced with no distinct weaknesses or advantages, while winning more than half of his fights against the game's other characters. He is also a playable character for both the versus and story modes in Shaolin Monks, where his movesets in this game are largely identical to Liu Kang's with some original techniques.|$|E
