40|$|Small {{wetlands}} in East Africa {{have grown}} in prominence driven by the unreliable and diminished rains and the increasing population pressure. Due to their size (less than 500 Ha), these wetlands have not been studied extensively using satellite remote sensing approaches. High spatial resolu-tion remote sensing approaches overcome this limitation allowing detailed inventorying and re-search on such small wetlands. For understanding the seasonal variations in land cover within the Malinda Wetland in Tanzania (350 Ha), two periods were considered, May 2012 coinciding with the wet period (rainy season) and August 2012 coinciding with a fairly rain depressed period (substantially dry but generally cooler season).

The proposed mission includes an innovative active/passive microwave system coupled with IR cloud top measurements for multi-layer atmosphere observations. The TropSat system will provide frequent, high-resolution {{measurements of the}} near-surface wind vector and rain rate over the tropical oceans.

40|$|We {{present a}} photo-geological {{map of the}} “Asari” {{quadrangle}} covering the North Pole area of Ceres (66 °N- 90 °N), based on Dawn Framing Camera images and mosaics with a resolution of 400 m/pixel. The mapping process {{is supported by a}} stereo- photogrammetric digital elevation model. We identified few isolated plateaus of up to 5 km in altitude relative to the datum and topographic depressions interpreted to be highly degraded impact basins. At 85 °N/ 8 °E a cone-shaped positive relief is found, few te of kms large. Overall, the entire quadrangle is heavily cratered, and our measurements of crater density (9. 8 E- 04 km- 2 for crater diameters > 10 km) identify the area as the most cratered on Ceres. This suggest a different geological history of the quadrangle relative to, e. g., the equatorial regions. The morphology of impact craters is characterized by central peaks and mass wasting deposits. We identified a morphologically-fresh mass wasting deposit at 78 °N/ 38 °E, 20 km in length, with a lobate margin and striations on its surface. This deposit and the positive relief at 85 °N/ 8 °E will be the focus of future investigations when <b>higher</b> <b>spatia</b> resolution images will be acquired by the Dawn Framing Camera.

40|$|Abstract. The intensities of {{submillimeter}} and millimeter continua, {{which are}} formed in LTE and depend linearly on temperature, {{may be able}} to provide a test of models of the Solar chromosphere. We have taken a collection of submillimeter and millimeter wave observed brightness temperatures Tb of the quiet Sun from the literature and compared it with brightness temperatures computed from the standard static models of Fontenla, Avrett and Loeser (FAL) and the dynamic simulations of Carlsson&Stein(CS). The analysis of the dynamic simulations of Carlsson & Stein reveals that radio emission at millimeter wavelengths is extremely sensitive to dynamic processes in the chromosphere, if these are spatially and temporally resolved. The most striking result is that the dynamic picture of the solar internetwork chromosphere is consistent with currently available millimeter and submillimeter brightness observations. The spectrum obtained by averaging over the spectra from all time-steps of CS simulations provides a good fit to observed temporally and spatially averaged millimeter data in spite of the absence of a permanent temperature rise at low chromospheric heights in the simulations. This does not by itself rule out the presence of a chromospheric temperature rise as present in the FAL models, since a combination of such models also reproduces the (low resolution) data relatively well. Millimeter observations indicate that using radio techniques it is possible to extend observations of the solar oscillatory component to the heights above those previously observed in the photospheric and low chromospheric spectral lines and submillimeter continuum.

40|$|Sismotectonic and {{geologic}} map have long portrayed the late Oligocene-Recent geologic {{history of the}} Lepontine Dome (Central Alps) as tectonically quiescent. We present here new data, based on paleostress inversions, which indicate clearly the late brittle extensional deformation in the whole gneissic core. Three tectonic phases, representing more a progressive evolution of state of stress than single dissociated events, were reconstructed by the analysis of strain/stress field by four different methods of which results are coherent. ESE-WNW transpression of late Oligocene, previously described (Merle et al. 1989) resulted in gently dipping reverse and conjugate strike-slip faults of which occurrences are very rare and don’t allow to reconstruct any paleotensor. Then, it appears that this state of stress progresses from transtensive to pure extensive movements, both characterized by regionally consistent NE-SW σ 3 axes. The fault pattern resulting is composed of relatively local strike-slip faults (transfer faults) accommodating differential extension from the northern to southern Lepontine Dome. This phase formed mainly NW-SE striking normal or oblique-normal faults. Dating of pseudotachylytes, by in situ <b>high</b> <b>spatia...</b>|$|E
40|$|Residual dune ridges {{are often}} formed by {{vegetation}} growing along a line some distance upwind {{of the lower}} stoss slope of migrating dunes. This process is common in areas where vegetation germinates {{along the edge of}} the water during the rainy period when the water level is higher and interdune areas are flooded. The phenomenon occurs on a large scale in North-east Brazil, because of the rise and fall in groundwater level at the end of the rainy season. Each residual dune ridge corresponds to the position of the dune during the wet period in each year. Therefore, variations in the distance between these residual dune ridges could be used potentially to monitor climatic fluctuations in rainfall and wind. To examine the potential use of these residual dune ridges for the reconstruction of past climatic fluctuations, a model that simulates them under varying conditions of wind, rainfall and evaporation rates was formulated. The model was tested for sensitivity to climatic variability in North-east Brazil and validated against residual dune ridge displacements as measured in the field and from <b>high</b> <b>spatia...</b>|$|E

40|$|The New Horizons {{mission was}} {{launched}} on 2006 January 19, and the spacecraft is {{heading for a}} flyby encounter with the Pluto system {{in the summer of}} 2015. The challenges associated with sending a spacecraft to Pluto in less than 10 years and performing an ambitious suite of scientific investigations at such large heliocentric distances (> 32 AU) are formidable and required the development of lightweight, low power, and highly sensitive instruments. This paper provides an overview of the New Horizons science payload, which is comprised of seven instruments. Alice provides moderate resolution (~ 3 - 10 Å FWHM), spatially resolved ultraviolet (~ 465 - 1880 Å) spectroscopy, and includes the ability to perform stellar and solar occultation measurements. The Ralph instrument has two components: the Multicolor Visible Imaging Camera (MVIC), which performs panchromatic (400 - 975 nm) and color imaging in four spectral bands (Blue, Red, CH 4, and NIR) at a moderate spatial resolution of 20 µrad/pixel, and the Linear Etalon Imaging Spectral Array (LEISA), which provides spatially resolved (62 µrad/pixel), near-infrared (1. 25 - 2. 5 µm), moderate resolution (λ/δλ ~ 240 - 550) spectroscopic mapping capabilities. The Radio Experiment (REX) is a component of the New Horizons telecommunications system that provides both radio (X-band) solar occultation and radiometry capabilities.

40|$|Abstract. : Any {{discussion}} of psychedelic hallucination is an {{equivalent to the}} {{discussion of}} the spontaneous emergence of perceptual information within human consciousness. Human perception is limited by the capacity of sense organs; or rather the functionality of human perception is limited by sense organs, functionality of the human perception is limited bybyte speed and architecture of the neural network; functionality of human perception is limited by and the number of distinct perceptions the brain can analyze at any one time. Despite functional limitations, human consciousness is seamless, meaning that each perception and behavior flows smoothly from one to the next. When consciousness is equivalent to stable perception and behavior and stable perception are is seamlessly integrated, when consciousness destabilizes perception and behavior loses cohesion until we are no longer in control of our thoughts and actions Destabilization of consciousness can happen all at once. Like (instantaneously without any time lag) in the case of being knocked unconscious, but more often it happens incrementally(with time lag d^ 1 (eb) d^ 2 ……. d^n) as various aspects of consciousness enter into a lowpower subconscious or unconscious state, as in going to sleep.

40|$|Intracardial electrocardiograms (IECG) are a {{standard}} tool for investigating the conduction {{system of the}} heart and its pathological changes during electrophysiological investigations. But using new electrode materials like fractally coated Iridium the low-frequency components of the IECG are also available with implantable leads. Alterations of the ion currents across the cardiac cell membrane are observable using the bipolar measured monophasic action potential (MAP) and the unipolar recorded ventricular evoked response (VER). This article demonstrates the frequency effects and the influence of antiarrhythmic drugs on both signals simultaneously recorded in dog. At higher stimulation rates MAP and VER shortened (60 ppm: MAPd 90 : 285 ± 19 ms, 180 ppm: MAPd 90 : 202 ± 16 ms). The T+-duration lied between MAPd 50 and MAPd 90. VER duration was 23 - 28 % longer. The effects of 2 mg/kg isoproterenol to the intrinsic rhythm and MAP duration of mongrel dogs were the same as reported in literature (MAPd 90 -shortening: 175 ± 7 to 157 ± 11 ms, MAPd 50 : 160 ± 9 to 110 ± 23 ms). The VER-morphology altered comparable (180 ppm: VER-T+: 180 ± 8 to 170 ± 14 ms). Following i. v. bolus of 0. 5 mg/kg sotalol in MAP and VER equivalent results were also achieved. Both signals show a strong correlation (MAPd 90 -VERd 90 : p< 0. 0001; MAPd 90 -T+ amplitude: p< 0. 0018) indicating that the MAP and VER reflects the effects of these drugs on the transmembrane ion-currents of cardiac cells equivalently.
