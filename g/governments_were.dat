5|$|New {{elections}} for regional <b>governments</b> <b>were</b> held on November 19, 2006; most regions went to local political movements {{rather than to}} national parties.

5|$|The ACCC {{conceded that}} the state <b>governments</b> <b>were</b> not {{carrying}} on businesses in procuring the medical products. This meant that the <b>governments</b> <b>were</b> immune from Sections46 and 47 of the TPA. Baxter argued that this immunity extended to itself, by claiming derivative governmental immunity. On 16 May 2005, The Federal Court of Australia (Allsop J presiding) found in Baxter's favour at first instance. While {{the court held that}} Baxter would have breached the TPA, governmental immunity under Section2B extended to Baxter Healthcare. Allsop J's judgment was upheld unanimously on appeal to the full bench of the Federal Court (Justices Mansfield, Dowsett and Gyles presiding). The full bench expressed unease about its own judgment, stating that the question of derivative governmental immunity should be left to the High Court for reconsideration of Bradken.|$|E

5|$|The Allies {{disagreed}} {{about how}} the European map should look, and how borders would be drawn, following the war. Each side held dissimilar ideas regarding the establishment and maintenance of post-war security. The western Allies desired a security system in which democratic <b>governments</b> <b>were</b> established as widely as possible, permitting countries to peacefully resolve differences through international organizations.|$|E
5|$|Chrétien's {{position}} {{was far more}} difficult than Johnson's: Part of the 1993 Liberal election platform had been moving the country away from large scale constitutional debates. Provincial <b>governments</b> <b>were</b> also far more hostile to the constitutional process {{than they had been}} in the decade prior, with even the federal government's typical ally, Ontario, being firmly against any pursuit of constitutional accommodation.|$|E
5|$|In 1942, {{fighting}} with the Partisans intensified. Not only had they liberated a substantial territory {{in the eastern part}} of Yugoslavia, but they encouraged rebellion all over the country. The German, Italian and NDH <b>governments</b> <b>were</b> aware of this danger and they used every means available to destroy the Partisan forces. They planned several large-scale operations for this purpose in which air support played a very important role.|$|E
5000|$|An aphorism {{sometimes}} {{attributed to}} either Thomas Jefferson [...] or Thomas Paine, [...] "That <b>government</b> <b>is</b> best which governs least...", was actually found in Thoreau's Civil Disobedience. Thoreau was paraphrasing {{the motto of}} The United States Magazine and Democratic Review: [...] "The best <b>government</b> <b>is</b> that which governs least." [...] Thoreau expanded it significantly: [...] I heartily accept the motto,—“That <b>government</b> <b>is</b> best which governs least;” and I should {{like to see it}} acted up to more rapidly and systematically. Carried out, it finally amounts to this, which I also believe,—“That <b>government</b> <b>is</b> best which governs not at all;” and when men are prepared for it, that will be the kind of government which they will have. <b>Government</b> <b>is</b> at best but an expedient; but most <b>governments</b> <b>are</b> usually, and all <b>governments</b> <b>are</b> sometimes, inexpedient.

Whilst both Prime Ministers were Liberals and both <b>governments</b> <b>were</b> wartime coalitions, Lloyd George and Balfour, appointed as his Foreign Secretary, favoured a post-war partition of the Ottoman Empire as a major British war aim, whereas Asquith and his Foreign Secretary, Sir Edward Grey, had favoured its reform.|$|E
5|$|Lukashenko blamed {{foreign governments}} for conspiring against him and, in April 1998, {{expelled}} ambassadors from the Drazdy complex near Minsk and moved them to another building.

Although the ambassadors eventually returned after the controversy died down, Lukashenko stepped up his rhetorical attacks against the West.

5|$|After Rio de Janeiro was {{purchased}} by the Ottoman Empire, the Argentine government bowed to popular demand and began to seek a buyer for their two dreadnoughts. The money received in return would have been devoted to internal improvements. Three bills directing that the battleships be sold were introduced into the Argentine National Congress in mid-1914, but all were defeated. Still, the British and Germans expressed worries that the ships could be sold to a belligerent nation, while the Russian, Austrian, Ottoman, Italian, and Greek <b>governments</b> <b>were</b> all reportedly interested in buying both ships, the latter as a counter to the Ottoman purchase of Rio de Janeiro.|$|E
5|$|As Police Commissioner Blamey {{defended the}} actions of the police during the 1928 Waterside Workers' Federation dispute, during which police opened fire, killing a {{striking}} worker who was also a Gallipoli veteran, and wounding several others. His treatment of the unionists was typical of his hard line anti-communist beliefs and as such his relations with left-wing <b>governments</b> <b>were</b> tense. Along with many senior army and ex-army officers, he was a leading member of the clandestine far-right-wing League of National Security. This was reportedly a response to the rise of communism in Australia. Its members stood ready to take up arms to stop a Catholic or communist revolution.|$|E
5|$|As {{political}} and economic power increasingly concentrated in Lima, the capital city, several administrations tried to decentralize the country with little success. The 1979 Peruvian Constitution contained provisions for the decentralization of power {{through the creation of}} autonomous regions, but they were not implemented. During the later years of the 19851990 presidency of Alan García, the government faced the prospect of losing the 1990 presidential elections because of a widespread economic crisis and faltering public support. As a way of creating an alternative source of power, the regime established twelve autonomous regions on January 20, 1989 in the hope of winning some elections at this level. However, due to the haste of their creation, these regional <b>governments</b> <b>were</b> not provided with fiscal resources of their own so they depended on the goodwill of the central government for funding.|$|E

5|$|In June 1947, Castro {{learned of}} a planned {{expedition}} to overthrow the right-wing military junta of Rafael Trujillo, a U.S. ally, in the Dominican Republic. Widely seen as a dictator, Trujillo utilized a violent secret police which routinely murdered and tortured opponents. Becoming president of the University Committee for Democracy in the Dominican Republic, Castro decided to join the expedition, led by Dominican exile General Juan Rodríguez. Launched from Cuba, the mission began on July 29, 1947; it consisted of around 1,200 men, {{most of whom were}} exiled Dominicans or Cubans. However, the Dominican and U.S. <b>governments</b> <b>were</b> prepared, and soon quashed the rebellion. Grau’s government arrested many of those involved before they set sail, but Castro escaped arrest by jumping off of his naval frigate and swimming to shore at night.|$|E
5|$|In {{the months}} after the war, Australian {{authorities}} were responsible for administering all of Borneo and the NEI east of Lombok until the British and Dutch colonial <b>governments</b> <b>were</b> re-established. While British and Indian forces in {{the west of the}} NEI became caught up in the Indonesian National Revolution, the Australians were able to avoid clashes with local nationalists. Australian forces were also responsible for guarding the 344,000 remaining Japanese in the NEI and Australian territories and administering war crimes trials in these areas. A volunteer force was formed as Australia's contribution to the British Commonwealth Occupation Force (BCOF) in Japan, and Australia provided the BCOF's headquarters and a high proportion of its personnel. This force later formed the nucleus of the post-war Australian Army, which included permanent combat units for the first time.|$|E
5|$|Japanese {{cities were}} highly {{vulnerable}} to damage from firebombing {{due to their}} design and the weak state of the country's civil defense organization. Urban areas were typically congested, and most buildings were constructed from highly flammable materials such as paper and wood. In addition, industrial and military facilities in urban areas were normally surrounded by densely populated residential buildings. Despite this vulnerability, few cities had full-time professional firefighters and most relied on volunteers. Such firefighting forces that did exist lacked modern equipment and used outdated tactics. Air raid drills had been held in Tokyo and Osaka since 1928, however, and from 1937 local <b>governments</b> <b>were</b> required to provide civilians with manuals that explained {{how to respond to}} air attacks. Few air-raid shelters and other air defense facilities for civilians and industry were constructed prior to the Pacific War.|$|E
