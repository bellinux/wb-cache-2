5|$|Edge and Batista also {{continued}} their rivalry over the World Heavyweight Championship after Batista defeated Mark Henry, Kane and Finlay in a Fatal Four-Way match {{to become the}} number one Contender to the title. On the June 1 episode of SmackDown!, Batista verbally and physically confronted <b>Edge</b> <b>on</b> the SmackDown! debut of Edge's Cutting Edge talk show.

5|$|Brown's main {{contribution}} to the game, however, was not {{to the development of}} new plays but to the organization and administration of teams. Before Brown, football was seen as a chaotic affair where winning was a product mostly of physical prowess. Few coaches took strategy and preparation seriously. Brown, by contrast, hired a full-time staff of assistants, tested his players on their intelligence and their knowledge of plays, instituted strict organization of practices and analyzed game film to get an <b>edge</b> <b>on</b> opponents. Brown created a detailed system for scouting college talent as a means to improve the Browns' college draft.|$|E

Edge insulted Triple H in the segment, who retaliated by labeling Edge's main event push as a complete failure and sending The Shield to attack Edge's friend Christian. When Edge went to confront Triple H, he was escorted from the building. Edge hosted The Cutting <b>Edge</b> <b>on</b> the September 13 episode of SmackDown, where he mocked Randy Orton and watched as Orton's attack on Bryan backfired.|$|E

Edge held a celebration for himself on the July 13 episode of SmackDown, and was attacked by Kane, who in the process legitimately injured <b>Edge.</b> <b>On</b> the July 20 episode of SmackDown, Edge was forced to vacate the World Heavyweight Championship {{as a result of}} his injury. The Great Khali went on to win a 20-man battle royal to become the new World Heavyweight Champion.

5|$|Several {{species of}} duck have brown-plumaged females {{that can be}} {{confused}} with the female mallard. The female gadwall (A.strepera) has an orange-lined bill, white belly, black and white speculum that is seen as a white square on the wings in flight, and is a smaller bird. More similar to the female mallard in North America are the American black duck (A.rubripes), which is notably darker-hued in both sexes than the mallard, and the mottled duck (A.fulvigula), which is somewhat darker than the female mallard, and with slightly different bare-part colouration and no white <b>edge</b> <b>on</b> the speculum.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Amiens {{was a major}} {{turning point}} in the tempo of the war. The Germans had started the war with the Schlieffen Plan before the Race to the Sea slowed {{movement}} on the Western Front and the war devolved into trench warfare. The German Spring Offensive earlier that year had once again given Germany the offensive <b>edge</b> <b>on</b> the Western Front. Armoured support helped the Allies tear a hole through trench lines, weakening once impregnable trench positions. The British Third Army with no armoured support had almost no effect on the line while the Fourth, with fewer than a thousand tanks, broke deep into German territory. Australian commander John Monash was knighted by King George V in the days following the battle.|$|E

5|$|The strongest bids were Memphis, Louisville, Anaheim and New Orleans. As {{the latter}} two had venues in place, they were seen as having an <b>edge</b> <b>on</b> the other two. Both Memphis and Louisville needed public funding for a new venue, and in either city, the team would have {{to play in a}} sub-optimal {{location}} for several seasons. However, {{the construction of a new}} venue was seen as an advantage by the Grizzlies, as it could be tailor-made for basketball, and the team would be able to control all revenue. The team also expected the highest local radio and television broadcasting rights in Louisville and Memphis, and that the two cities lacked other Big Four major league teams, granting the team preferred air times and increased attention from fans and media. A 2000 report from PricewaterhouseCoopers concluded that small cities often had higher attendance than larger cities because of team's professional league exclusivity. It also pointed to the strong support for college basketball in Tennessee and Kentucky.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the {{televised}} broadcast, Billy Gunn defeated The Brooklyn Brawler {{in a dark}} match. The first match on the pay-per-view event saw Razor Ramon, Randy Savage, the 1–2–3 Kid, and Marty Jannetty face Diesel, Irwin R. Schyster, Rick Martel, and Adam Bomb. Prior to the match, Ramon announced that Savage was taking the place of Perfect, who was unable to appear. Martel and Ramon began the match in the ring, but Martel soon tagged out to bring Bomb into the match. Ramon performed a suplex on Bomb and attempted to pin his opponent. Martel tried to rescue his partner but ended up hitting Bomb instead and causing an argument. The 1–2–3 Kid entered the match but was overpowered by Bomb and Diesel. After the Kid tagged out, Savage performed a diving elbow drop on Diesel before getting the pinfall to eliminate Diesel from the match. Ramon was attacked by his opponents but eventually tagged Savage back into the match. Savage got distracted when Crush appeared in the aisle, however, which allowed Schyster to eliminate him from the match. Ramon then performed a Razor's <b>Edge</b> <b>on</b> Schyster and pinned him. Ramon attempted the same move on Martel, but Schyster snuck back into the ring and hit Ramon with a briefcase. Ramon {{fell out of the}} ring and was counted out of the match. The remaining four wrestlers fought back and forth, but the 1–2–3 Kid eventually pinned Martel after a sunset flip. Almost immediately, Jannetty performed a sunset flip on Bomb to win the match for his team.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} of the night saw Edge putting his World Heavyweight Championship on the line against The Undertaker. The early going of the match was slow-paced, in which both superstars countered each other's maneuvers. During the match, Undertaker ran and leapt over the top rope from the ring onto <b>Edge</b> <b>on</b> the outside. Then {{throughout}} the match, Edge was able to counter Undertaker's numerous signature moves, including the Chokeslam, Old School and the Last Ride, {{a variation of the}} powerbomb. Near the end, Edge hit Undertaker with a television camera while the referee was knocked down. When he proceeded to deliver a Tombstone Piledriver to Undertaker, Undertaker countered it into his own version and successfully delivered it to Edge for a two-count. Curt Hawkins and Zack Ryder came to the ring for Edge's aid, but Undertaker took them out. Because of their distraction, Edge was able to execute a spear on Undertaker, but was unable to pin him. When Edge delivered another spear to Undertaker, Undertaker applied Hell's Gate and forced Edge to submit to win the World Heavyweight Championship, improving his WrestleMania record to 16–0.|$|E

5|$|The {{predominant}} feud on the SmackDown! brand {{heading into}} the pay-per-view was between Edge and Batista, with the two battling over the World Heavyweight Championship. The two fought each other at Judgment Day for the title, and Edge won the bout with a school boy pin. On the May 25 episode of SmackDown!, General Manager Theodore Long announced that Edge would defend the World Heavyweight Championship in a Steel Cage match at One Night Stand. Batista won a Fatal Four-Way match against Finlay, Kane, and Mark Henry to earn the spot of the challenger at the pay-per-view. Batista was a guest on Edge's talk show The Cutting <b>Edge</b> <b>on</b> the June 1 episode of SmackDown!. Towards {{the end of the}} segment, Batista punched Edge and sent him to the floor. The following night, on Saturday Night's Main Event, Batista and Chris Benoit defeated Edge and Montel Vontavious Porter (MVP) in a tag team match. During the match, Edge walked out, leaving MVP on his own against Batista and Benoit. Benoit gained the pinfall after performing a flying headbutt on MVP.|$|E
5|$|The {{other main}} match {{on the card}} was a Hardcore Intergender match, as Edge and Mick Foley faced Terry Funk and Tommy Dreamer. The rivalry started between Edge and Foley, when the two faced in a Hardcore match at WrestleMania 22. Edge won the match after a spear off the apron and through a flaming table on the outside. Foley was a guest on the Cutting <b>Edge</b> <b>on</b> the May 1, 2006 episode of Raw, and the two agreed to a WrestleMania Hardcore rematch the {{following}} week. Before the match began on the May 8, 2006 edition of Raw, Foley announced that the match was now a triple threat match, with Tommy Dreamer added as the third person. During the match, however, Foley turned heel {{for the first time}} in over eight years and attacked Dreamer with a barbed wire baseball bat. Foley handed Edge the bat and Edge hit Dreamer with it, busting him open. Foley hit the Mandible claw on Dreamer and Edge simultaneously speared Dreamer, with Foley getting the pinfall. The two, along with Lita celebrated up the entrance ramp. On the May 15, 2006 episode of Raw, Foley wanted to apologize to Dreamer for what happened the previous week; however, Dreamer was not in the arena, so Foley brought out Terry Funk. Funk asked Foley to apologize for what happened to Dreamer. Instead, Foley started bashing ECW. In an attempt to get into a fight with Foley, Funk made comments about Foley's family, calling his wife a whore and his kids s. When the two exchanged punches, Edge and Lita came out, with Lita low-blowing Funk. Edge and Foley double-teamed Funk, with Edge hitting Funk with a barbed wire baseball bat. A week later, on the May 22, 2006 edition of Raw, Edge and Foley announced themselves as co-holders of the WWE Hardcore Championship. Paul Heyman came out and made a challenge to Edge and Foley to face Funk and Dreamer at One Night Stand, which Edge accepted. The two, along with Lita, went after Heyman up the ramp, before Dreamer and Funk attacked them with several weapons, sending the trio out of the arena. On the WWE vs. ECW Head to Head special that aired on June 7, 2006, Edge faced Dreamer in an Extreme Rules match. Dreamer hit Edge with a Dreamer Driver through the table. Lita interfered, and hit Dreamer repeatedly with a cane. Dreamer was not hurt by the shots, and he got Lita up for a powerbomb, before Edge speared Dreamer. Edge got the pinfall and won the match. During the match, Foley and Funk were fighting outside the ring, with Funk busting Foley open. After the match, Foley sat in the middle of the ring and stated his kayfabe thoughts on ECW.|$|E
