5|$|At the game, {{bisexual}} drama teacher Andrew LeGustambos {{attempts to}} grab the attention of both Larry and Miracle, but the whole school stands in shock as Stuart arrives with two full and augmented breasts; the pills he had taken were actually librarian Helen Klench's female hormone replacements. Nonetheless, the school loses the game. Sue finally reveals she was not planning on actually firing any teacher on her watch. Helen arrives to inform them {{that they did not}} need to win the game after all; she had found a rare time capsule with treasures. Upon opening the time capsule, it is revealed that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> Willard's porn magazines that Ennis hid. Sue pitifully looks at Willard and tells him he is fired.|$|E
25|$|Parque del perro: Located in the San Fernando neighborhood, {{this is one}} of {{the most}} popular areas in the city. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> {{restaurants}} and bars. The park gets its name because it has a dog monument in the middle of it.|$|E
25|$|Felsőváros (Upper Town), {{formerly}} Csebokszári (Cheboksary – capital town of Chuvash Republic, Russia) – The largest {{housing estate}} of Eger, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> four and ten-storied concrete buildings, providing homes for {{one third of}} the town's population.

25|$|Unlike other Jewish traditions, which depict God in {{relatively}} simple terms, the Zohar is intentionally obscure. As a work <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> neologisms, linguistic borrowings, occasional grammatical mistakes, and inspired wordplay on rabbinic and biblical passages. Its ideas are often inconsistent and conflicting, referring to abstract concepts that are never completely expressed.|$|E
25|$|Patrick White and Christina Stead {{continue}} to be widely recognised as the foremost Australian novelists of the 20th century. His writing tackles existential questions as well as myriad human flaws, weaknesses and hypocrisies, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> fresh and original metaphor. Admittedly, White's style is also often very condensed and perhaps at first somewhat difficult to approach – such noted writers as Robert Hughes and David Malouf have expressed their difficulties with some of White's writing. Nevertheless, Patrick White's greatness as a novelist remains undoubted.|$|E
25|$|In {{the final}} scene, Rosie is {{waiting in the}} flat ready. She has been {{reassured}} {{that she will be}} watched on camera, and help will come if there's any trouble. She is in the company of Tommy Angel, an ex-SAS bodyguard who makes wildly optimistic passes at Rosie, such as suggesting that many people find this sort of danger arousing. Tommy then asks Rosie to hit him on the head to show how tough he is. Rosie does so, and Tommy instantly falls unconscious, out of view. Seconds later, Edna calls at the door. Rosie plays the part of Joanna well, and hands over the case of money from a hidden compartment in a table as soon as she sees the drugs. Unfortunately, when Edna inspects the briefcase, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> cut newspaper instead of money. Even though Rosie knows nothing about it, Edna tries to punish Rosie by spraying acid in her eyes. After a struggle, Edna catches her and is about to do the deed when Tracy comes in and brutally incapacitates her.|$|E

500|$|Adaptive Coloration in Animals is a 500-page book, [...] in {{its first}} edition. It was {{published}} by Methuen (in London) and Oxford University Press (in New York) in 1940. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> detailed observations of types of camouflage and other uses of colour in animals, and illustrated by the author with clear drawings and photographs. There is a coloured frontispiece showing eight of Cott's paintings of tropical amphibians. The book has 48 monotone plates and several illustrations.|$|E
500|$|Fleming {{compares the}} mass to Rossini's operas and early mass {{settings}} and finds restrained vocal lines, {{even in the}} melismas of the Agnus Dei, but observes his [...] "predilection for spicy harmonic twists". She summarizes his [...] "optimistic and deeply felt faith. Robert King, the conductor of The King's Consort, notes: [...] "It certainly is solennelle, for it is a heartfelt religious work which shows the extraordinary compositional capabilities of this astonishing man of the theatre: <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> drama, pathos, colour and intensity." ...|$|E
500|$|The Everglades are {{dominated}} by sawgrass in water; this is the titular [...] "River of Grass" [...] popularized by Marjory Stoneman Douglas in 1947. This river contains {{a wide variety of}} plant and animal life. An early American environmentalist named Gifford Pinchot said of the Everglades, [...] "It is a region so different that it hardly seems to belong to the United States. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> the most vivid and most interesting life on land, in the air, and in the water. It is a land of strangeness, separate and apart from the common things we all know so well." ...|$|E

500|$|During {{these last}} years at Idlewild, Willis {{continued}} contributing a weekly {{letter to the}} Home Journal. In 1850 he assisted Rufus Wilmot Griswold in preparing an anthology {{of the works of}} Poe, who had died mysteriously the year before. Griswold also wrote the first biography of Poe in which he purposely set out to ruin the dead author's reputation. Willis {{was one of the most}} vocal of Poe's defenders, writing at one point: [...] "The indictment (for it deserves no other name) is not true. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> cruel misrepresentations. It deepens the shadows unto unnatural darkness, and shuts out the rays of sunshines that ought to relieve them".|$|E
500|$|Fields {{then left}} American Graffiti. It took {{another six months}} of editing to create a shorter, 110-minute version of the film, but upon its release in 1973 American Graffiti was {{extremely}} successful both with critics and at the box office. Shortly after its release, Roger Greenspun described the film and its editing: [...] "American Graffiti exists {{not so much in}} its individual stories as in its orchestration of many stories, its sense of time and place. Although <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> the material of fashionable nostalgia, it never exploits nostalgia. In its feeling for movement and music and the vitality of the night—and even in its vision in white—it is oddly closer to some early Fellini than to the recent American past of, say, The Last Picture Show or Summer of '42." ...|$|E
500|$|Dwarf Fortress {{has three}} primary game modes which {{take place in}} worlds created by the player, {{where most of the}} {{elements}} are randomly generated. Fortress mode is a construction and management simulation of a colony of dwarves. There are no objectives, with the player being free to decide how to go about managing the colony and making them interact with the environment, thus making it an open-ended and sandbox-style game. Since {{there is no way to}} win, it only ends when the entire colony is defeated by the various possible threats, or the player decides to abandon the fortress. The visuals are text-based using code page 437 characters in various colors as graphics. Thus, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> letters, numbers and symbols; dwarves are represented by the symbol , a cat and dog are a white [...] "c" [...] and brown [...] "d", while a giant spider is a grey [...] "S".|$|E

500|$|Tim Byrd {{reviewed}} the adventure in The Space Gamer No. 30, stating that it [...] "successfully combines fantasy with SF" [...] {{and that it}} was [...] "extremely fun to play [...] one of the best modules TSR has published". Two gaming magazines reviewed Expedition to the Barrier Peaks in 1981. Reviewer Marcus L. Rowland said in White Dwarf #26 that he found the adventure [...] "very enjoyable, with ideas and creatures eminently suitable for wider use". He gave it 9/10 overall, but complained that some of the maps were printed {{on both sides of the}} same sheet, making them useless as a Dungeon Master's shield (a visual barrier that allows dice rolls and other activities to be conducted without the players knowing the outcome). He recommended at least a week's study by the Dungeon Master before attempting to play it. He also notes that the cover [...] "reveals the secret of the creatures". Kirby Griffis {{reviewed the}} adventure in The Space Gamer #36. Griffis noted that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> [...] "surprises and new monsters", and felt that its one drawback was that Gygax presented standard D monsters as natives of other planets. In summary, he found it interesting and [...] "full of spice and flavor"; recommending it to anyone interested in [...] "something new" [...] or wanting to include science fiction in their D game.|$|E
2500|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> {{the errors}} of itacism, poor illuminations, and {{careless}} errors (e.g. 2 Timothy 2:6). It is [...] "too incorrect {{to be much}} of value", though it has no errors with iota subscriptum or iota adscriptum.|$|E
2500|$|Alcibiades {{begins by}} {{comparing}} Socrates to {{a statue of}} Silenus; the statue is ugly and hollow, and inside <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> tiny golden statues of the gods (215a-b). He then compares Socrates to a satyr Marsyas; Socrates, however, needs no flute to [...] "cast his spell" [...] on people as Marsyas did — he needs only his words (215b-d).|$|E
60|$|He is The one Eternal Life; and <b>it</b> has <b>been</b> {{manifested}} in human form, {{that human beings}} might copy it; and behold, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> grace and truth.|$|R

60|$|He {{came to the}} palace, and {{the king}} was giving audience. Beppo went into the great audience-chamber. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> people--lords and nobles and rich merchants and lawyers.|$|R
2500|$|The New Statesman {{observed}} that Brown successfully describes [...] "the awkwardness of the lifestyle" [...] and [...] "the vagueness of the position", and that while [...] "political events and {{what must have}} been some fairly traumatic personal moments" [...] seem [...] "airbrushed", leaving [...] "the diary feeling a little empty", the book demonstrates how [...] "collision of the political with the personal... jars and is sometimes funny", concluding <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> [...] "thoughtfulness and... courtesy", [...] "precisely {{the sort of thing that}} is genuine Sarah Brown".|$|E
2500|$|Some saw {{the book}} in a more {{favorable}} light, however, noting that it [...] "has a vein of humour and pleasantry which, with all its occasional coarseness, one cannot resist, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> life, it has one or two capital descriptions, and it is read through before it is laid down." [...] Marryat's writing was notably enjoyed by many famous later writers, including Mark Twain, Joseph Conrad, and Ernest Hemingway. Critic Mark Spilka has suggested that Percival Keene might have served as inspiration for part of Hemingway's story The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber.|$|E
2500|$|Harold Thimbleby of New Scientist {{gave the}} book a {{positive}} review, writing, [...] "Here at last is a sensible, thought-provoking and informative {{book about the}} complexity and challenges of the Net." [...] He compared Grossman's writing to other works on the subject matter, [...] "Most books are too enthusiastic about the technology, too American, too Utopian, too get-rich-quick—or just out of date. In Net.wars we have a good, profoundly challenging book, which rises above parochialism. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> insights—as much into bulletin boards as sexual stereotyping, rights to free speech and establishing global copyright." [...] Thimbleby concluded, [...] "Everyone, particularly police, lawyers, teachers, parents and scientists, can usefully read this book and consider what the Net really means for us all." ...|$|E
5|$|In April 2017, another lawsuit, {{regarding}} Purina's Beggin' line of {{dog food}} and the accusation that its advertising fooled consumers into thinking that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> bacon, <b>was</b> dropped.|$|R
