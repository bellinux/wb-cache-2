5|$|The Tramp {{encounters}} {{the drunken}} millionaire {{a third time}} and is again invited to the mansion. The Tramp relates the girl's plight and the millionaire gives him money for her operation. Two burglars knock the millionaire out and {{take the rest of}} his money. The burglars flee before the arrival of the police, who find the Tramp with the money the millionaire gave him, but because of the knock on his head the millionaire does not remember giving it. The Tramp evades the police long enough to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> the girl, telling her he will be going away for a time, but in due course he is apprehended and imprisoned.|$|E
2500|$|A {{young black}} man named Paul {{shows up at the}} home of art dealer Flan Kittredge and his wife Louisa, known simply as [...] "Ouisa", who live {{overlooking}} Central Park in New York City. Paul has a minor stab wound from an attempted mugging, and says he's a friend of their children at Harvard University. The Kittredges are trying to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> buy a painting by Paul Cézanne and now have this wounded stranger in their home. Paul claims he is in New York to meet his father, who is directing a film version of the Broadway musical Cats. Paul continues to charm them with his story, though, in reality, it is all a lie: Paul is not a Harvard student but obtained details on the Kittredges from another male student he had seduced. Eventually Paul uses their home for an encounter with a hustler, but is caught red-handed. The police are called, but Paul escapes.|$|E

50|$|During Norman times, {{the hundred}} would pay geld {{based on the}} number of hides. To assess how much {{everyone}} had to pay, a clerk and a knight were sent by the king to each county, they sat with the shire-reeve (or sheriff), of the county and a select group of local knights. There would be two knights from each hundred. After it was determined what geld had to be paid, the bailiff and knights of the hundred were responsible for <b>getting</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sheriff, and <b>the</b> sheriff for <b>getting</b> it to <b>the</b> Exchequer.|$|R
50|$|Abed (Danny Pudi) {{has been}} hiring celebrity impersonators to reenact scenes from his {{favorite}} movies. Everyone wonders {{how he is}} <b>getting</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> pay for it, but Troy (Donald Glover) chastises them for disloyalty and reminds them that Abed has made all of their lives easier and more fun. In fact, Abed owes $3,000 to the impersonators' agency, and unless Abed's friends appear at a bar mitzvah dressed as famous celebrities, Vinnie (French Stewart), a French Stewart impersonator, will have impersonators of Ving Rhames and Michael Chiklis break Abed's legs.|$|R

5000|$|Heatstroke - Joanne {{was able}} to {{generate}} blazing heat, {{she was in love}} with Coldsnap; but could not touch him, due to her heat powers. Joanne, like Darryl, joined the group in order <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> needed <b>to</b> cure her condition.|$|R

50|$|Back in Munich, {{the company}} has gone bankrupt, and the pair have to {{scramble}} to find new jobs. Just before Meersdonk is forced to sell his lorry, they connive to land another delivery run.

60|$|Frank felt indeed relieved. He {{felt sure}} that the head-master would {{consider}} such an escapade by boys of the Sixth Form an unforgivable crime, and that expulsion would follow discovery; and knowing the hot temper of his uncle, he feared that the latter would view the matter in the most serious light. It was therefore with a light heart that he went across to the Black Dog and placed the note {{in the hands of}} Perkins, merely saying that he was glad to say that {{he had been able to}} <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> satisfy the red-haired tailor for his loss of beauty.|$|E

He had gone abroad, else she would have gone back to him and married him--at a price. Marry him? yes she would marry him: she would do {{anything}} for money to take her sister away! What did she care for herself when her darling was dying--dying for the want of two hundred pounds! ...|$|E

50|$|After taking {{forever to}} arrive at the airport, JellyRoll finally shows up and picks the rapper up at the airport. He finds out that Jeezy wants some weed badly, so he decides to take them to <b>the</b> hood to <b>get</b> some. He meets up with his drug dealer Mondo who scolds him for <b>getting</b> weed for <b>the</b> rapper and asks if Jeezy can come to his after party. JellyRoll insists that the rapper wants 20,000 dollars to show up and Mondo accepts and gives him <b>the</b> <b>money.</b> This is where things start to turn for the {{promoters}} as JellyRoll spends the 20,000 dollars on clothes and jewelry instead of using it for the show to pay Jeezy his <b>money.</b> From there, <b>the</b> movie turns wild and intense as Russell Redds and JellyRoll try {{to figure out a way}} to get Jeezy to perform while dodging Mondo and his crew and <b>getting</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> pay Jeezy to perform.|$|R
60|$|I {{told my wife}} she was a fool; bade Mrs. Barry not be uneasy, and was hot upon going: I {{would take}} no denial from either party. How I was to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> go was the question; but that was solved by my good mother, who was always ready to help me on a pinch, and who {{produced}} sixty guineas from a stocking. This was all the ready money that Barry Lyndon, of Castle Lyndon, and married to a fortune of forty thousand a year, could command: such had been the havoc made in this fine fortune by my own extravagance (as I must confess), but chiefly by my misplaced confidence and the rascality of others.|$|E
60|$|Dorothy Gale {{lived on}} a farm in Kansas, with her Aunt Em and her Uncle Henry. It was not a big farm, nor a very good one, because {{sometimes}} the rain did not come when the crops needed it, and then everything withered and dried up. Once a cyclone had carried away Uncle Henry's house, so that he was obliged to build another; and as he was a poor man he had to mortgage his farm to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> pay for the new house. Then his health became bad and he was too feeble to work. The doctor ordered him to take a sea voyage and he went to Australia and took Dorothy with him. That cost a lot of money, too.|$|E
60|$|MRS WARREN. Yes, saving money. But {{where can}} a woman <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> save {{in any other}} business? Could y o u save out of four shillings a week and keep {{yourself}} dressed as well? Not you. Of course, if youre a plain woman and can't earn anything more; {{or if you have}} a turn for music, or the stage, or newspaper-writing: thats different. But neither Liz nor I had any turn for such things at all: all we had was our appearance and our turn for pleasing men. Do you think we were such fools as to let other people trade in our good looks by employing us as shopgirls, or barmaids, or waitresses, when we could trade in them ourselves and get all the profits instead of starvation wages? Not likely.|$|E

50|$|The Hundred was {{an ancient}} unit of local administration. At {{the time of}} the Domesday Survey, Sussex {{contained}} 59 hundreds. The area of each hundred in Sussex would have been approximately 25 sq mi, quite small in comparison to other counties where the hundred could be as much as 200 sq mi in area. During Norman times the hundred would pay geld (a form of land tax) {{based on the number of}} hides. To assess how much everyone had to pay, a clerk and a knight were sent by the king to each county, they sat with the sheriff of the county and a select group of local knights.There would be two knights from each hundred. After it was determined what geld had to be paid, then the knights of the hundred and the bailiff of the hundred were responsible for <b>getting</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sheriff, and the sheriff to the Exchequer.|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{for this}} reassuring circumstance, I should feel {{inclined}} to be suspicious of some things--of the obstinate manner, for instance, in which the young man keeps himself concealed; also, of his privately warning me not to trust {{the woman who is}} his own messenger, and not to tell her on any account of the information which his letters convey to me. I feel that I ought to be cautious with him on the question of money--and yet, in my eagerness to see my darling, I am ready to give him all that he asks for. In this uncertain state of mind, I am restrained, strangely enough, by the old woman herself. She warns me that he is the sort of man, if he once <b>gets</b> <b>the</b> <b>money,</b> <b>to</b> spare himself <b>the</b> trouble of earning it. It is the one hold I have over him (she says)--so I control the burning impatience that consumes me as well as I can.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he {{answered}} at length, [...] "suppose you're right. Who's {{going to take}} up my case, and where am I to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> put up a fight? The only lawyer in the district wouldn't act against the bondholder, and I couldn't get at my mortgage deed anyway. It's in the man's hands, and I haven't a copy. I got out {{with the price of}} a few beasts, and left the rest to him." [...] He paused, and clenched a big, brown hand. [...] "If he's wise he'll be content with that, and quit; but you can't satisfy that man. He's got my farm; he's made my life bitter; brought three years of trouble on the girl I meant to marry; and now he's after me again. Seems to me I've laid down under it about long enough!" ...|$|E
60|$|Mr Barham {{always made}} his {{approaches}} very gradually. The taciturn humility {{with which he}} commenced his operations was in exact proportion to the enthusiastic volubility of his advanced intimacy. Mrs Yeld thought that it became her to address to him a few civil words, and he replied to her with a shame-faced modesty that almost overcame her dislike to his profession. She spoke of the poor of Beccles, being very careful to allude only to their material position. There was too much beer drunk, no doubt, and the young women would have finery. Where did they <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> buy those wonderful bonnets which appeared every Sunday? Mr Barham was very meek, and agreed to everything that was said. No doubt he had a plan ready formed for inducing Mrs Yeld to have mass said regularly within her husband's palace, {{but he did not}} even begin to bring it about on this occasion. It was not till he made some apparently chance allusion to the superior church-attending qualities of 'our people,' that Mrs Yeld drew herself up and changed the conversation by observing {{that there had been a}} great deal of rain lately.|$|E
6000|$|... "I do not pretend, Miss de la Molle, {{that it is}} a {{pleasant}} task for any young lady to undertake. I quite understand your shrinking from it. But sometimes one has to do unpleasant things and make compromises with one's self-respect. It is a question whether or no your family shall be utterly ruined and destroyed. There is, as I honestly believe, no prospect whatever of your father being able to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> pay off Cossey and Son, and if he did, it would not help him, because he could not pay the interest on it. Under these circumstances you have to choose between putting yourself in an equivocal position and letting events take their course. It would be useless for anybody else to undertake the task, and of course I cannot guarantee that even you will succeed, but I will not mince matters--as you doubtless know, any man would find it hard to refuse a favour asked by such a suppliant. And now you must make up your own mind. I have shown you a path that may lead your family from a position of the most imminent peril. If you are the woman I take you for, you will not shrink from following it." ...|$|E
