500|$|After Shankly {{left school}} in 1928, {{he worked at}} a local mine {{alongside}} his brother Bob. He did this for two years until the pit closed and he faced unemployment. In his autobiography, he described {{the life of a}} miner at some length and mentioned many of the problems such as the sheer hard work, rats, the difficulties of eating and drinking at the coal face, but above all the filth: [...] "We were never really clean. It was unbelievable how we survived. Going home to wash in a tub was the biggest thing. The <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> in a bath was when I was 15".|$|E
500|$|Davis {{later said}} [...] "Jim Wong [...] {{was a big}} help, too. A lot of the stage {{directions}} point toward farce, but Jim told me to play against that and just let the situation play out. The Forrest Gump scene was difficult, too. When I prepared it and did it the <b>first</b> <b>time,</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> almost Shakespearean in my approach. Jim made me toss it off more, and it worked fine". Chris Owens who portrayed the Young Smoking Man spent time watching how Davis smokes to ensure {{that he did it}} just like him. Owens later appeared as a young version of The Smoking Man again in the episode [...] "Demons", and as his son Jeffrey Spender.|$|E

500|$|Including his {{stops at}} both two- and {{four-year}} schools, Saban's overall collegiate coaching record was 94–99–4. Including playoffs, his professional football record stands at 97–101–7. Saban had periods of {{success as a}} player and as a coach at the college and professional levels, but his constant moves from job to job eventually came to define him. [...] "I have been known as a peripatetic coach", he said in 1994. [...] "The <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> called that, I thought it was a dirty word. I looked it up in the dictionary and found it meant I moved around a lot."

500|$|Jayson Rodriguez of MTV News {{felt that}} Keys [...] "croons" [...] on the track's chorus line, [...] "I'm from Neeeeww Yooooork/These streets {{will make you}} feel brand-new/Bright lights will inspire you." [...] Keys said that while {{recording}} the song she wanted to make sure she got the hook right explaining, [...] "I did try it a couple of times, but it was more about capturing the kind of grand feeling of it. With the way I sang it the <b>first</b> <b>time,</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> actually kind of sick, and I knew that he needed the record, so I was like, 'Let me get to it.'" [...] She added, [...] "I came back and revisited it so that it could be what it is now So it actually took a couple of times, but every time, the energy was just so high." [...] Simon Vozick-Levinson of Entertainment Weekly felt that the singer who sings the song's hook has a [...] "crucial role", believing that [...] "Empire State of Mind" [...] is a [...] "smash that concert attendees expect Jay to play, and it just wouldn't work without a big, clear voice to sing that hook". In November 2012, Keys said she had to redo the vocals after Jay-Z said he wasn't happy with her original take. Keys said she had been battling [...] "nasal congestion" [...] when she did the first take.|$|E

2500|$|In May 2013 Walker {{expressed}} {{appreciation for}} the works of David Icke. On BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, she said that Icke's book Human Race Get Off Your Knees (in which he claims that Earth's moon is a [...] "gigantic spacecraft" [...] transmitting [...] "fake reality broadcast...in {{much the same way}} as portrayed in the Matrix movie trilogy") would be her choice if she could have only one book. Walker has also praised this book on her website. She said that upon reading the book she [...] "felt it was the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> able to observe, and mostly imagine and comprehend, the root of the incredible evil that has engulfed our planet." [...] Jonathan Kay of the National Post said that Walker's public praise for Icke's book was [...] "stunningly offensive" [...] and that by taking it seriously, she was disqualifying herself [...] "from the mainstream marketplace of ideas." ...|$|E
2500|$|For {{roughly the}} next decade Gordon {{controlled}} Jackson with threats, lies, and routine domestic violence. According to Jackson, [...] "When he hit me, the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> in shock, I just recalled my ear ringing, just ringing so hard." [...] Gordon confiscated Jackson's passport, transferred her bank accounts into his name, hired bodyguards to watch La Toya constantly and banned her from speaking to or seeing her family, monitoring her every phone call. La Toya's father Joseph stated in his book The Jacksons that he believed Gordon brainwashed La Toya and made her fearful of her own family. Katherine also believed that La Toya had been brainwashed while Gordon claimed that Katherine had tried to kill her daughter. Sister Janet concurred with her parents saying at the time, [...] "I think this guy who is with her has brainwashed her and made her like this... He keeps {{her away from the}} family, and now he's brainwashed her so much she keeps herself away from us." ...|$|E

5000|$|... "It {{is still}} a {{commonly}} accepted notion that the editor just [...] "cuts out all the bad bits." [...] I liken editing more to sculpture.

500|$|The medieval chronicler Matthew Paris retold {{the story}} that when King John heard of Walter's death, the king exclaimed [...] "Now for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> king of England". This story, however entertaining, is apocryphal. More secure is {{the story that}} another chronicler, Roger of Wendover, relates about Walter's Christmas {{celebrations}} in 1200. Roger reports that Walter distributed clothing to those attending his Christmas feast, which angered King John. The chronicler says that Walter [...] "wished to put himself {{on a par with}} the king".|$|R
