500|$|The Commitments is {{the first}} book in Doyle's series known as The Barrytown Trilogy, {{followed}} by The Snapper (1990) and The Van (1991). While all three novels focus on the Rabbitte family, Doyle expressed {{that he was not}} interested in writing or producing sequels to the 1991 film adaptation, stating, [...] "I hope it's never made. I <b>just</b> <b>think</b> <b>that,</b> whereas The Commitments was very much a labour of love, Commitments 2 is definitely an act of cynicism." ...|$|E
500|$|After Troutman's death, Ice Cube {{said that}} [...] "More Bounce To The Ounce" [...] {{introduced}} him to hip-hop. [...] "I was in the sixth grade, we'd stayed after school. We had this dude named Mr. Lock, {{and he used to}} bring in his radio with these pop-lockers. He used to teach [...] the L.A. Lockers, and he would do community service in after-school programs. He knew a lot of kids and introduced them to all the new dances, he put on that song 'More Bounce', and they started pop-locking. And I think from that visual, from seeing that, it was my first introduction into hip-hop. Period. I didn't know nothing about nothing. I hadn't heard [...] "Rapper's Delight" [...] yet. It was the first thing that was really fly to me. They started dancing, and since 'More Bounce' goes on forever, they just got down. I <b>just</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> was a rush of adrenaline for me, like a chemical reaction in my brain." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bucchianeri and U.S. Air Force veteran Ron Mackell Jr. {{ran for the}} Democratic {{nomination}} for the general election; it was therefore possible that Critz could win the special election but lose the primary for the November general election. Hafer had initially planned {{to run for the}} Democratic nomination in the general election, but withdrew on March 10, 2010, saying [...] "He won both nominations, and I <b>just</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> it's time for me to step aside and let him go forward. There's no sense in me beating him up." ...|$|E
5000|$|Breure {{was criticized}} in the BuzzFeed article, {{for not having}} a [...] "clear {{political}} agenda." [...] The author stated that the film and its director seem circumspect regarding whether western countries' age of consent limits should be changed. The syndicated feminist blog Jezebel commented, [...] "He <b>just</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> teenage girls are hot, and he doesn't want you to <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> gross, okay?" ...|$|R
2500|$|Hitchens {{was accused}} of [...] "anti-Catholic bigotry" [...] by others, {{including}} Brent Bozell and UCLA Law Professor Stephen Bainbridge. When Joe Scarborough on 12 March 2004 asked Hitchens whether he was [...] "consumed with hatred for conservative Catholics", Hitchens responded {{that he was not}} and <b>that</b> he <b>just</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> [...] "all religious belief is sinister and infantile".|$|R

He doesn't have anything to offer, and <b>just</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> he can start at the top, as a writer. Opportunity knocks on Frank's door {{when he goes to}} the Cannes Film Festival in Cannes, France to deliver some props to Troma, Inc.|$|R
2500|$|On December 2, 2010, {{shortly before}} a speech {{for the eighth}} annual [...] "Images and Perceptions of Arab Americans" [...] conference in Dearborn, Michigan, Thomas told reporters that she still stood by the {{comments}} she had made to Nesenoff. Referring to her resignation, she said [...] "I paid a price, but it's worth it to speak the truth." [...] During the speech, Thomas said: [...] "Congress, the White House, Hollywood and Wall Street are owned by Zionists. No question, in my opinion." [...] Thomas defended her comments on December 7, telling Scott Spears of Marion, Ohio radio station WMRN, [...] "I <b>just</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> people should be enlightened as to {{who is in charge}} of the opinion in this country." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{fact that}} Obama never {{mentioned}} the word [...] "terrorism" [...] or [...] "terror" [...] was positively interpreted {{by many in}} the Muslim street, given that many of them see a 'war on terror' interchangeably as a 'war on Islam'. American conservatives also picked up on this and argued that it weakened Obama's overall message. House Republican leader John Boehner also commented after the speech that Obama [...] "seemed to place equal blame on the Israelis and the Palestinians.... I have concerns about that because Hamas is a terrorist organisation". As well, he said, [...] "here he continues to say he will sit down with the Iranians without any preconditions, I <b>just</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> that puts us in a position where America looks weak in the eyes of their rulers." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rousey {{appeared}} nude on {{the cover}} of ESPN The Magazines 2012 Body Issue and in a pictorial therein. Touching upon the strategic cropping, poses, and arm placement used in the photos to make them less revealing, Rousey explained: [...] "With all these ring girls and their vaginas – all of this goes back to advice my mom gave me. She gave me this one piece of advice, which I still hold dear. She said, 'Look, whatever pictures you put out there are gonna be out there forever, so <b>just</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> one day your 12 or 13-year-old son or daughter is going to see those pictures. Whatever you want your son or daughter, or even your 13-year-old little sister to see, keep that in mind.' So, whatever I’m not gonna show on a beach, I'm not gonna show in a magazine. These girls {{are going to have to}} explain to their kids one day why mommy's ass and vagina are all over the place." [...] Her rival Miesha Tate criticized Rousey's comments as [...] "hypocritical", arguing that Rousey's comments about ring girls constituted a double standard.|$|E

5000|$|Levin {{met with}} President Donald Trump on March 7 in the Oval Office and chatted {{for an hour}} [...] Levin [...] "just really likes {{powerful}} people, and he really likes having friends who are powerful, and who better than the President of the United States? I <b>think</b> he’s <b>just</b> blinded {{by the fact that}} the President calls him on the phone. I <b>think</b> he <b>just</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>that’s</b> really cool,” a former staffer told ThinkProgress.|$|R
6000|$|... "Odd thing, though, {{that loss}} of memory," [...] the {{accountant}} remarked. [...] "I {{was talking to}} the doctor about it only the other day. He seems to have wandered away into some sort of hiding, under the impression that he had committed a crime, and now that he is getting better he has absolutely forgotten all about it. He <b>just</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> he has had an ordinary illness and has had to stay away from business for a time." ...|$|R
2500|$|Commenting to Digital Spy {{about her}} return, Lawrence said: [...] "I've {{not been in}} the show for 11 years and it's not like I've ever thought [...] "I'll never go back", you <b>just</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> your chance to go back has gone. It never crossed my mind that the {{occasion}} would ever arise, so when I got the phone call, it was really odd. There was never any doubt that I'd do it for Mike [...] and it's not something that's really been done — I don't think someone's ever died off-screen and then they've done the funeral on-screen. I think everyone was quite wary because it's quite an odd thing to do to have attended his real funeral and then go back to film it all over again. There was some trepidation about how it was going to work. But as soon as we arrived, it was like 11 years of your life had been wiped out and you'd been there the day before [...] I had this really lovely scene with Sid [...] where I said: [...] "Isn't it strange, you imagine you’d come back and everything would be here waiting for us just like it was." [...] Diane's saying everything's moved on, but for me it was the opposite, I'd got back there and everything was the same." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Duff, {{the album}} chronicles her {{experiences}} {{over the year}} before its release: [...] "some of its good, {{and some of its}} bad, and a lot of its, like, a big learning experience", she explained. She expressed an interest in recording lyrically more aggressive material ("Well, I'm not going to be singing about lollipops because I no longer relate to lollipops") than the songs on Metamorphosis (2003) and wanted the album to reflect that, according to her, she is a normal sixteen-year-old. [...] "Basically, I'm not Lizzie McGuire anymore", she said. She said the album deals with issues she would not discuss publicly and provides [...] "some answers", but she disagreed with people who believed the album presented a different side of her, saying [...] "I think it's just more me this time because I got to really do it how I wanted to." [...] Duff called the album [...] "different [...] " [...] Metamorphosis and [...] "much more mature", particularly in its [...] "sound", but not {{to the point where it}} would be inappropriate for children; [...] "I <b>just</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> other people will relate better", she said. According to her, she was more [...] "involved" [...] compared to the production of her first album and [...] "confident enough to make suggestions" [...] about the style of the album: [...] "If I thought it needed to be more heavy, more rock, I said so". Its US release date, October 4, 2004, was a week after Duff's seventeenth birthday.|$|E

'This is a thing I never learnt before; this person is really Sennacherib, sitting on his throne; and these with fluted beards and hair like plough- furrows, and fingers with no bones in them, are his warriors--really carved at the time, you know. Only <b>just</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> this is not {{imagined}} of Assyria, but done in Assyrian times by Assyrian hands.

6000|$|... "He used to {{say that}} the art of {{training}} animals was the art of inspiring them with fear. One of his assistants told me a nasty one about him afterwards. They had an off month in Los Angeles, and Captain Roberts got it into his head {{he was going to make}} a dog balance a silver dollar on the neck of a champagne bottle. Now <b>just</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> over and try to see yourself loving a dog into doing it. The assistant said he wore out about as many sticks as dogs, and that he wore out half a dozen dogs. He used to get them from the public pound at two and a half apiece, and every time one died he had another ready and waiting. And he succeeded with the seventh dog. I'm telling you, it learned to balance a dollar on the neck of a bottle. And it died from the effects of the learning within a week after he put it on the stage. Abscesses in the lungs, from the stick." ...|$|E

500|$|The philosopher Frank J. Leavitt {{has argued}} that the method Bates {{described}} would be difficult to test scientifically due to his emphasis on relaxation and visualization.

500|$|Song said in 2005, [...] "Besides Hollywood grand-openings and award shows, I try to {{stay away}} from the parties. It's so easy to be swept away from that whole scene because it's {{expected}} of you. I've never drank or smoked in my entire life, but I've seen 15-year-olds drinking and smoking and I <b>just</b> <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> gross."

6000|$|... "My dear fellow, {{in a way}} you {{are quite}} right. The Queen did {{undoubtedly}} intend isolation; and, all told, it would be best that her experiment should be made as she arranged it. But <b>just</b> <b>think,</b> <b>that</b> became impossible when once the Dutch explorer had broken into her tomb. That was not my doing. I am innocent of it, though it was the cause of my setting out to rediscover the sepulchre. Mind, I do not say for a moment that I would not have done just the same as Van Huyn. I went into the tomb from curiosity; and I took away what I did, being fired with the zeal of acquisitiveness which animates the collector. But, remember also, that at this time I did not know of the Queen's intention of resurrection; I had no idea of the completeness of her preparations. All that came long afterwards. But when it did come, I have done all that I could to carry out her wishes to the full. My only fear is that I may have misinterpreted some of her cryptic instructions, or have omitted or overlooked something. But of this I am certain; I have left undone nothing that I can imagine right to be done; and I have done nothing that I know of to clash with Queen Tera's arrangement. I want her Great Experiment to succeed. To this end I have not spared labour or time or money--or myself. I have endured hardship, and braved danger. All my brains; all my knowledge and learning, such as they are; all my endeavours such as they can be, have been, are, and shall be devoted to this end, till we either win or lose the great stake that we play for." ...|$|E
