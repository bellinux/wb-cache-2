5|$|Although {{the movie}} is set <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fashion</b> world, most {{designers}} and other fashion notables avoided appearing as themselves for fear of displeasing U.S. Vogue editor Anna Wintour, who is widely {{believed to have been}} the inspiration for Priestly. Still, many allowed their clothes and accessories {{to be used in the}} film, making it one of the most expensively costumed films in history. Wintour later overcame her initial skepticism, saying she liked the film and Streep in particular.|$|E
5|$|Behind the Horseshoe Cloister is the Curfew Tower, one of {{the oldest}} {{surviving}} parts of the Lower Ward and dating from the 13th century. The interior of the tower contains a former dungeon, and the remnants of a sally port, a secret exit for the occupants in a time of siege. The upper storey contains the castle bells placed there in 1478, and the castle clock of 1689. The French-style conical roof is a 19th-century attempt by Anthony Salvin to remodel the tower <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fashion</b> of Eugène Viollet-le-Duc's recreation of Carcassonne.|$|E

The German textile industry consisted of about 1,300 companies with more than 130,000 employees in 2010, which generated a revenue of 28 billion Euro. Almost 44 per cent of the products are exported. The Berlin Fashion Week and the fashion trade fair Bread & Butter are held twice a year.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 21st century, {{the market for}} natural dyes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fashion</b> {{industry}} is experiencing a resurgence.

The European Union, for example, has encouraged Indonesian batik cloth producers to switch to natural dyes to improve their export market in Europe.|$|E

5|$|Metal corsets {{are found}} {{in a number of}} museum {{collections}} around the world. Some museums, including the Museo Stibbert, and the Kyoto Costume Institute in Japan, present their metal bodices as fashionable late 16th-century garments. The Victoria and Albert Museum in London describes their iron corset (formerly owned by the painter Talbot Hughes) as dating from the 18th century and likely intended for orthopaedic purposes. Others, such as the iron corset <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fashion</b> Institute of Technology, are presented as fakes.|$|E

5|$|Whatever Coke's meaning, {{after an}} initial period during which his {{decision}} enjoyed some support but no statutes were declared void, Bonham's Case was thrown aside, in favour of the growing doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty. In {{one of the most}} prominent early treatises supporting the doctrine, William Blackstone wrote that Parliament is the sovereign lawmaker, preventing the common law courts from throwing aside or reviewing statutes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fashion</b> that Coke had suggested. Parliamentary sovereignty is now the accepted judicial doctrine in the legal system of England and Wales.|$|E
5|$|After {{moving to}} Los Angeles {{to pursue a}} career <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fashion</b> {{industry}} in May 2006, Conrad was commissioned to star in her own spin-off series The Hills, which chronicled the personal and professional lives of her and friends Heidi Montag, Audrina Patridge, and Whitney Port. During its production, she attended the Fashion Institute of Design & Merchandising and held positions with Teen Vogue and Kelly Cutrone's PR firm People's Revolution. As the series progressed, a widely publicized feud developed between Conrad, Montag and Montag's boyfriend Spencer Pratt. Consequently, the conflict became the central focus of the series, and was carried through each subsequent season in which Conrad appeared.|$|E

According to her counsel, Bokhary failed to find peace or satisfaction in her personal and professional life after returning to Hong Kong from Britain, and in 2007 was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, for which she was being treated with strong psychotropic drugs and was reportedly undergoing intensive counselling. Her increasing alcohol consumption, combined with her medication, {{was said to have}} contributed to her violent outburst in 2008.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th {{century and}} {{beginning}} of the 20th, Gibraltar's future as a British colony was in serious doubt. Its economic value was diminishing, as a new generation of steamships with a much longer range no longer needed to stop there to refuel en route to more distant ports. Its military value was also increasingly in question due to advances in military technology. New long-range guns firing high-explosive shells could easily reach Gibraltar from across the bay or in the Spanish hinterland, while the development of torpedoes meant that ships at anchor in the bay were also vulnerable. The garrison could hold out for a long time, but if the Spanish coast was held by an enemy, Gibraltar could not be resupplied <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fashion</b> that had saved it in the Great Siege 120 years earlier.|$|E
5|$|Episodes {{typically}} {{depict the}} friends' comedic and romantic adventures and career issues, such as Joey auditioning for roles or Rachel seeking jobs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fashion</b> industry. The six characters each have many dates and serious relationships, such as Monica with Richard Burke and Ross with Emily Waltham. Ross and Rachel's intermittent relationship {{is the most}} often-recurring storyline; during the ten seasons of the show they repeatedly date and break up, even while Ross briefly marries Emily, he and Rachel have a child, Chandler and Monica date and marry each other, and Phoebe marries Mike Hannigan. Other frequently recurring characters include Ross and Monica's parents in Long Island, Ross's ex-wife and their son, Central Perk barista Gunther, Chandler's ex-girlfriend Janice, and Phoebe's twin sister Ursula.|$|E
5|$|Grunge music hit the {{mainstream}} {{in the early}} 1990s with Soundgarden, Alice in Chains, and Nirvana being signed to major record labels. Grunge fashion began to break into mainstream fashion in mid-1992 for both sexes and peaked in late 1993 and early 1994. As it picked up momentum, the grunge tag was being used by shops selling expensive flannelette shirts {{to cash in on}} the trend. Ironically, the non-conformist look suddenly became a mainstream trend. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>fashion</b> world, Marc Jacobs presented a show for Perry Ellis in 1992, featuring grunge-inspired clothing mixed with high-end fabrics. Jacobs found inspiration in the ‘realism’ of grunge streetwear; he mixed it with the luxury of fashion by sending models down the catwalk in beanies, floral dresses and silk flannel shirts. Unfortunately, this did not sit well with the brand owners and Jacobs was dismissed. Other designers like Anna Sui, also drew inspiration from grunge during the spring/summer 1993 season.|$|E

5|$|In December 2010, the Royals waived Humber, {{and he was}} {{claimed by}} the Oakland Athletics, who had extra room on their 40-man roster {{at the time of}} the waiver claim. However, the team {{subsequently}} filled its 40-man roster and designated Humber for assignment later that off-season in order to make room on their roster for Guillermo Moscoso, who the Athletics acquired from the Texas Rangers in a trade during January 2011. The Chicago White Sox claimed Humber off waivers from the Athletics on January 18, 2011. He signed a contract worth $500,000 for the season. White Sox pitching coach Don Cooper worked with Humber, as he replaced his cut fastball with a slider and improved his pitching mechanics <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fashion</b> originally recommended by Peterson in 2005.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to achieving pop culture prominence and respect <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fashion</b> and art worlds starting {{with her body}} painting of Demi Moore, she is an award-winning make-up artist in {{the rock and roll}} world who has helped several of her music clients win fashion and style awards. She is also considered a fashion and art trendsetter, {{and for a long time}} she was associated with Madonna. In 2001, she had her first retrospective and in 2005, she published her first book on body painting. At the peak of her pop culture fame after the Vanity Fair cover, she was seriously considered for an Absolut Vodka Absolute Gair ad campaign. She has done magazine editorial work, and in 2005, she became a photographer of her own body paintings in both books and magazines.|$|E
5|$|In its series premiere, The Hills first {{introduced}} Lauren Conrad, {{who moved from}} Laguna Beach, California to Los Angeles {{to pursue a career}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fashion</b> industry. She and her housemate Heidi Montag originally planned to attend the Fashion Institute of Design & Merchandising, though the latter left the college after receiving employment with Bolthouse Productions. Montag befriended their neighbor Audrina Patridge, while Conrad bonded with her fellow Teen Vogue intern Whitney Port. The remainder of the first season highlighted romantic relationships, including Montag's and Patridge's brief relationships with Jordan Eubanks and Brian Drolet respectively. The season concluded with Conrad's rejection of a summertime internship in Paris to reunite with her former boyfriend Jason Wahler. Consequentially, Port was offered and accepted the position in Conrad's place.|$|E
