40|$|Objective: The paper {{explores the}} first-time {{internationalisation}} strategy and discusses whether firms could actually begin <b>internationalisation</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> without {{crossing the border}} by approaching the international expatriates’ community in the home city/market. Research Design & Methods: The concept of <b>internationalisation</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> is studied through the case study method. An example of a public company from the creative industry {{in the capital city}} from the Central and Eastern European region is studied. Findings: The expatriates’ community, so far often neglected market segment, has a rising potential in several European cites. The results highlight a positive impact on performance after approaching the expatriates’ community. Organisational learning effects result in improved and stabilised sales and strengthened firm-specific advantages. Implications & Recommendations: <b>Internationalisation</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> is disruptive innovation, especially appropriate for enterprises under high resource constraints. It is fast, cost efficient and has positive externalities. The international expatriates’ community in the home city/market offers fast organisational learning and a testing area for enterprises. Contribution & Value Added: <b>Internationalisation</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> adds to the existing understanding of internationalisation. The findings that firms could begin the organisational learning process of internationalisation before or even without the first foreign entry and proposals for the integrating expatriates’ community into the marketing strategy may influence future internationalisation paths...|$|E

40|$|Background: Nursing {{students}} need to be prepared for the increasingly culturally diverse health care. Therefore, providing students with international perspectives remains the mission of higher education. However, given the logistic and financial constraints, not all students will be able to travel overseas for their international experiences. A feasible alternative to study abroad is internationalisation-at-home where intercultural dimensions are incorporated into curriculum, without students leaving their home universities. This paper presents findings from a collaboration between nursing programmes in Sweden and Hong Kong. The aim of the project was to explore how undergraduate nursing students' perceived achieved learning outcomes after participating in a web-based intercultural peer-learning intervention. Methods: A qualitative and interpretative design was adopted to capture undergraduate nursing students' experiences of <b>internationalisation</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> via webinars. We used convenience sampling and recruited ten undergraduate nursing students from each university. The students were assigned a generic patient case that they discussed and reflected on during three webinars. Data were collected by students´ reflective journals and focus group interviews. Analysis of data followed the principles for thematic networks. Results: In exploring how undergraduate nursing students' perceived learning outcomes after participating in a web-based intercultural peerlearning intervention the global theme, nursing as universal and recognisable, emerged from the data. Recognition of the global theme aroused from two organisational themes; mirroring nursing through an intercultural lens and reflecting on personal action and the action of others. Conclusions: Developing an understanding of nursing as universal and recognisable has implications for nursing students as it supports not only a willingness to work abroad, but also preparedness to care for a diverse population. Therefore, the use of web-based learning activities allow new effective approaches to <b>internationalisation</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> programmes and needs to be further developed and implemented in nursin...|$|E

40|$|Virtual {{mobility}} {{initiatives are}} one of the most flexible, versatile and inclusive approaches in the provision of international experience opportunities. Given that in most universities only a small fraction of students can benefit from forms of academic mobility that involve travelling abroad, Internet-based intercultural interactions prove to be instrumental in widening participation in international experience. This article focuses on the virtual mobility scheme of Coventry University (CU), known as Online International Learning (OIL). OIL projects involve online interactions between CU students and peers at non-UK universities, so they can work together on subject-specific learning tasks or activities while developing key attributes of global graduates, namely Intercultural Competence and Digital Skills.

40|$|<b>Internationalisation</b> <b>at</b> <b>Home,</b> a {{work-in-progress}} {{priority project}} {{funded by the}} Australian Learning and Teaching Council, aims to internationalize the learning and teaching practices of Business higher education through intercultural capacity building of faculty, students, and the curricula. The initial phase of this participatory action research project involved consulting stakeholder groups (business professionals, faculty members, domestic students, and international students) to assess needs for sociocultural competence development in Business classes and workplaces. The integration of the stakeholder-generated critical incident scenarios with an internationally recognised intercultural training resource (the EXCELL Program) led to the design and delivery of a professional development workshop offered to Business faculty members at two Australian universities. Afterwards, senior faculty members established learning circle meetings to support colleagues to adapt workshop resources and embed cultural diversity awareness and intercultural competence development in the Business courses they teach. In this paper, the authors report and discuss the processes and outcomes of the professional development workshop and the learning circle meetings, including the curriculum renovation actions initiated by participating faculty members.

30|$|This article {{takes the}} 3 rd Global Survey Report of the International Association of Universities (IAU) as a {{starting}} point. The results of this worldwide survey were published in September 2010. The article discusses four questions from the survey that include <b>Internationalisation</b> <b>at</b> <b>Home</b> (IaH) and internationalisation of the curriculum as response items. Outcomes of these four questions are commented on and, where relevant and possible, compared {{to the results of}} the previous survey, which was conducted in 2005 and published in 2006. It is argued that the sections of the Global Survey that mention internationalisation of the curriculum and IaH use terminology that is not always adequate for the purpose and at times even seems contradictory. The Global Survey includes a question on internal obstacles to internationalisation, which will also be discussed here. These obstacles include the lack of engagement and limited expertise of academic staff in relation to the internationalisation process. The response items for this question do not connect these obstacles to internationalisation of the curriculum explicitly, but it is argued here that a relationship indeed exists. The same is true for issues around foreign language proficiency, which may have a strong impact on internationalisation of the home curriculum. In the conclusion, several additional questions are raised that could serve to get a clearer picture of the development of internationalisation of the curriculum in a global perspective.|$|E

40|$|This is a {{selection}} of internationalisation resources produced by ESCalate to support the project A Changing World: the internationalisation experiences of staff and students (home and international) in UK Higher Education. Fifteen focus groups were run with staff and with students, both home and international, {{to listen to their}} views on what internationalisation meant to them, how it had influenced teaching and learning, and what challenges and successes they had experienced. Participants came from a range of disciplines and from across the UK. Staff in particular showed great awareness of the issues surrounding internationalisation with an appreciation of some of the complexities. Topics raised by participants included recruitment strategies, entry requirements for non-native speakers, PMI, fees, the British degree, higher education institutions (HEIs) competition for students in the global marketplace, and internationalising the curriculum. Staff and students described various techniques and strategies for creating inclusive learning environments. Many said how students and staff from across the world had enriched their lives, both personally and professionally. Staff discussed the difficulties of meeting the needs of culturally diverse groups, and both students and staff talked about how far we still have to go in encouraging some students to break out of their familiar cultural groups to socialise cross-culturally. Home students were the hardest group to recruit for this project. Given that they have so much to gain from learning in a culturally diverse environment it is suggested that more work {{needs to be done in}} the research area of <b>Internationalisation</b> <b>at</b> <b>Home</b> (Teekens, 2006, Joris, van den Berg &amp; van Ryssen, 2003), and within institutions, to engage not only staff but also home students so that all students and staff can gain maximum benefit from the changing higher education landscape.
