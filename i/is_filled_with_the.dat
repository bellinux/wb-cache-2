5|$|The heliosphere, the tenuous {{outermost}} {{atmosphere of}} the Sun, <b>is</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> solar wind plasma. This outermost layer of the Sun is defined to begin at the distance where {{the flow of the}} solar wind becomes superalfvénic—that is, where the flow becomes faster than the speed of Alfvén waves, at approximately 20 solar radii (0.1 AU).|$|E
5|$|The Fringe team {{is called}} {{to the scene of}} a robbery of a metal depository; the body of one of the thieves, shot by a {{security}} guard, inexplicably floats off the ground, while a second culprit has gotten away. They find that the thief has taken off with a supply of osmium, one of the densest elements, and an autopsy later reveals that the dead thief's body <b>is</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> metal. Tracking a security card on the body, they enter a warehouse where they find the second culprit, dead, along with the bodies of several more people, all of them paraplegic. Walter (John Noble) notes that the physical properties of osmium (both gravitational and thermal) have been reversed, and by melting the osmium collected from the first victim using liquid nitrogen, they detect the presence of the rarer element lutetium, typically only present in meteorites.|$|E
5|$|Within our Solar System, {{interplanetary space}} <b>is</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> plasma {{expelled}} via the solar wind, {{extending from the}} Sun's surface out to the heliopause. Furthermore, all the distant stars, and much of interstellar space or intergalactic space is also likely filled with plasma, albeit at very low densities. Astrophysical plasmas are also observed in Accretion disks around stars or compact objects like white dwarfs, neutron stars, or black holes in close binary star systems. Plasma is associated with ejection of material in astrophysical jets, which have been observed with accreting black holes or in active galaxies like M87's jet that possibly extends out to 5,000 light-years.|$|E

5|$|Peter Ackroyd {{believes}} {{that it is impossible}} to paraphrase the content of the poem; the poem is too abstract to describe the events and the action that make up the poem's narrative structure. However, the philosophical basis for the poem can be explained since the discourse on time is connected to the ideas within St. Augustine's Confessions. As such, there is an emphasis on the present moment as being the only time period that really matters, because the past cannot be changed and the future is unknown. The poem emphasizes that memory must be abandoned to understand the current world, and humans must realize that the universe is based on order. The poem also describes that although consciousness cannot be bound within time, humans cannot actually escape from time on their own. The scene beneath London <b>is</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> time-bound people who are similar to the spiritually empty populace of The Hollow Men; they are empty because they do not understand the Logos or the order of the universe. The conclusion of the poem emphasizes that God is the only one that is truly able to exist out of time and have knowledge of all times and places, but humankind is still capable of redemption through belief in Him and His ability to save them from the bounds of the material universe.|$|E
5|$|The clip {{starts with}} a bride reaching, on a limousine, the chapel on which she's about to get married. As she is shown walking inside the chapel's doors, Arjona starts to sing while sit on the chairs in the empty chapel. Then, the bride is shown again {{alongside}} the groom in the altar, ready to make the vows, while the chapel <b>is</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> invitees. Then, scenes of Arjona playing the piano and singing, and scenes of the ceremony are interpolated, showing the behaviour of the invitees. Later, the invitees are shown involved in discussions and fights while Arjona keeps singing the chorus and verses of the song. As the fights between the invitees increase, the groom rejects the bride and she, stunned, escapes from the chapel. Then, it is shown that all was an illusion from the bride, and they are shown exiting the chapel, married. As of 11 July 2012, the video has reached 14 million views on YouTube.|$|E
5|$|When {{producing}} a particular chocolate {{for the first}} time, a mini-game is played where ingredients are fired from a cannon to fill circular trays which revolve around the cannon. The ingredients and quantities needed vary, depending on the recipe. Each time a circle <b>is</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> correct ingredients, it is removed and an empty circle put in its place. The trays spin faster as more circles are filled. If too many ingredients are wasted by misfiring the cannon, production is brought {{to a halt and}} the mini-game must be attempted again. The mini-game ends when the timer runs out; the number of completed circles is equal to the number of chocolates produced by that factory every week. The mini-game cannot be played unless the player owns the correct ingredients, and it can be replayed if the player wishes to try to improve the efficiency of the factory. Playing the mini-game advances in-game time by one week. Different chocolate types, such as truffles and squares, require the factory to be upgraded first, costing money.|$|E

25|$|Metal {{tumbling}} {{is used to}} burnish, deburr, clean, radius, de-flash, descale, remove rust, polish, brighten, surface harden, prepare {{parts for}} further finishing, and break off die cast runners. The process is fairly simple: a horizontal barrel <b>is</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> parts which is then rotated. Variations of this process usually include media, water, or other lubricants. As the barrel is rotated the material rises until gravity causes the uppermost layer to landslide down to the other side. The barrel may also have vanes, typically made of rubber, which run along {{the inside of the}} barrel. As the barrel turns the vanes catch and lift the parts, which eventually slide down or fall.|$|E
25|$|There is a Noh play by {{the name}} of Kurozuka that tells the story of two priests who stop by the hut of the Onibaba in Adachi. The Onibaba, in her human form, kindly lets them in and speaks to them about her {{loneliness}} while spinning thread. Later, she leaves to gather firewood, but tells the priests not to look into the inner room of the house. Curious, the servant disobeys and the priests find that the inner room <b>is</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> bones and rotting corpses of people. They realize that the woman is the goblin of Adachi. As they are about to run away, the Onibaba returned, outraged, and in her demon form. They were able to escape through the power of their Buddhist prayers.|$|E
25|$|Alginate is a {{polysaccharide}} that readily forms chains; {{it can be}} cross-linked at its carboxylic {{groups with}} multivalent cations such as Cu2+, Ca2+, or Al3+ to form a more mechanically stable hydrogel. Calcium alginates form polymers that are both biocompatible and non-immunogenic and {{have been used in}} tissue engineering applications. However, they are unable to support longitudinally oriented growth, which is necessary for reconnection of the proximal end with its target. In order to overcome this problem, anisotropic capillary hydrogels (ACH) have been developed. They are created by superimposing aqueous solutions of sodium alginate with aqueous solutions of multivalent cations in layers. After formation, the electrolyte ions diffuse into the polymer solution layers, and a dissipative convective process causes the ions to precipitate, creating capillaries. The dissipative convective process results the opposition of diffusion gradients and friction between the polyelectrolyte chains. The capillary walls are lined with the precipitated metal alginate, while the lumen <b>is</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> extruded water.|$|E

25|$|The {{exterior}} of the structure is made of white granite from the North Jay Granite Company, and quarried near Jay, Maine. The site is not square, due to the acute angle at which Euclid Avenue intersects with E. 9th Street. To accommodate the site, Post created a total of 13 bays and columns on each street-facing side of the structure. There is a bay aligned with the axis of each entrance, and with the street corner of the building. Although a portico had been planned for the main entrance, the site {{was too small to}} permit one. The Euclid Avenue columns support a tympanum which <b>is</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> sculpture Finance. On the Euclid Avenue side are eight Corinthian columns, behind which are five two-story windows. On the E. 9th Street side, there are six pilasters, six two-story windows, and a mostly empty tympanum featuring an eagle and shield. Massive bronze doors are featured at both the Euclid Avenue and E. 9th Street entrances. The exterior walls are solid granite, unsupported by any other structure. The corner is chamfered to provide a transition between the two planes of the building.|$|E

500|$|The obverse {{design is}} a Longacre {{version of the}} Great Seal of the United States.

The crossed arrows represent nonaggression, but imply readiness against attack. The laurel branches, taken from Greek tradition, symbolize victory. In heraldic engraving, vertical lines represent red, clear areas white and horizontal lines blue, thus the escutcheon is colored red, white and blue and is meant to evoke the American flag.
