5000|$|A caquelon (...) is {{a cooking}} vessel of stoneware, ceramic, {{enamelled}} cast iron, or porcelain for {{the preparation of}} fondue, also called a <b>fondue</b> <b>pot.</b>|$|E
50|$|Fondue bourguignonne {{consists}} of a <b>fondue</b> <b>pot</b> filled with hot oil into which diners dip pieces of meat to cook them. Various dipping sauces are provided on the side.|$|E
50|$|The skewer itself, the brochette, {{can also}} be used to dip pieces of food in a fondue. In those cases it {{normally}} takes a slightly different form and is sold as a brochette de fondue or as a set along with the <b>fondue</b> <b>pot.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 1971, {{when faced}} with how {{to get rid of}} six <b>fondue</b> <b>pots</b> languishing in her cooking school/wine and cheese shop, La Bonne Femme, Chalmers {{demonstrated}} the 'fine art' of melting cheese. This cooking demonstration led to the publication of a 48-page Fondue cookbook, Chocolate Surprises cookbook and the creation of Potpourri Press.|$|R
5000|$|Charles [...] "Chuck" [...] Harrison (born September 23, 1931 in Shreveport, Louisiana) is an American {{industrial}} designer {{who was a}} long time resident in Chicago until 2015. He was the first African-American executive to work at Sears, Roebuck and Company, starting in 1961 as a designer and eventually becoming manager of the company's entire design group. He was involved in the design of over 750 consumer products, including the portable hair dryer, toasters, stereos, lawn mowers, sewing machines, Craftsman power tools, the see-through measuring cup, <b>fondue</b> <b>pots,</b> stoves, and the first plastic trash can, which has been credited with changing the sound of trash collection day. Perhaps his most famous achievement was leading the team that updated the View-Master in 1958, designing the classic Model F View-Master.|$|R
5000|$|Purchased by {{the museum}} {{in the summer of}} 2014, this {{building}} was originally a tabernacle church built in 1933. From 1976 to 1980 retired cardiologist and Matheson co-founder Dr. Mark Barrow and his wife, Mary, operated an antique store in the building. In 1982 they sold the building to [...] Orlando investors, and from 1982 to 2009 it was a [...] Melting <b>Pot</b> <b>fondue</b> restaurant. The Matheson History Museum received a $300,000 historic preservation grant from the Florida Department of State, Division of Historical Resources, along with contributions from private donors, to transform the building into a library and archive for the museum's local history collections.|$|R
5000|$|Fondue (pronounced [...] in British English; in American English usually [...] ) is a Swiss dish {{of melted}} cheese {{served in a}} {{communal}} pot (caquelon or <b>fondue</b> <b>pot)</b> over a portable stove (réchaud) heated with a candle or spirit lamp, and eaten by dipping bread into the cheese using long-stemmed forks. It was promoted as a Swiss national dish by the Swiss Cheese Union (Schweizerische Käseunion) in the 1930s, and was popularized in North America in the 1960s.|$|E
50|$|In this leg's Detour was {{a choice}} between Cheese and Wheeze. In Cheese, teams {{traveled}} to the Restaurant Walliserkanne Zermatt where {{they would have to}} finish an entire pot of cheese fondue. Once the pot was empty, the restaurateur would give them an empty <b>fondue</b> <b>pot</b> with the name of the next location printed on the inside. In Wheeze, teams had to dress up as bellhops and then pick up pieces of luggage from the Zermatt railway station. Then, using a luggage cart, they had to deliver the suitcases to different hotels throughout Zermatt where they would receive receipt tags for each piece of luggage. Once they had a total of 20 receipt tags from at least five different hotels, they could trade them in to the head porter for their next clue.|$|E

A group of men is sitting around a rectangular wooden table, which is partially covered by a table cloth; bottles of what appear to be wine and a <b>fondue</b> <b>pot</b> can be seen on top. The two men sitting in the foreground are each holding up a shot glass, while a fishing basket hangs around their shoulders. In the right, a woman is viewable standing by the doorway of the residence.; A staircase is observable in the center background and thick vegetation is visible in the left background...|$|E
5000|$|Food {{is passed}} from {{the kitchen to the}} stube, where the dining room table is placed. Some meals are communal, such as <b>fondue,</b> where a <b>pot</b> is set {{in the middle of the}} table for each person to dip into. Other meals are still served in a {{traditional}} manner on carved wooden plates. Furniture has been traditionally elaborately carved and in many Alpine countries carpentry skills are passed from generation to generation.Roofs are traditionally constructed from Alpine rocks such as pieces of schist, gneiss or slate. Such chalets are typically found in the higher parts of the valleys, as in the Maurienne valley in Savoy, where the amount of snow during the cold months is important. The inclination of the roof cannot exceed 40%, allowing the snow to stay on top, thereby functioning as insulation from the cold. In the lower areas where the forests are widespread, wooden tiles are traditionally used. Commonly made of Norway spruce, they are called [...] "tavaillon".The Alpine regions are multicultural and linguistically diverse. Dialects are common, and vary from valley to valley and region to region. In the Slavic Alps alone 19 dialects have been identified. Some of the French dialects spoken in the French, Swiss and Italian alps of Aosta Valley derive from Arpitan, while the southern part of the western range is related to Old Provençal; the German dialects derive from Germanic tribal languages. Romansh, spoken by two percent of the population in southeast Switzerland, is an ancient Rhaeto-Romanic language derived from Latin, remnants of ancient Celtic languages and perhaps Etruscan.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{describe}} {{the causes of}} burns associated with fondues. DESIGN: Descriptive case series. PATIENTS: All 17 patients admitted to a burn centre between Apr. 1, 1985, and Mar. 31, 1990, whose burns were associated with fondue. Eleven agreed to complete a telephone interview. RESULTS: The age of the 17 patients varied from 2 to 56 (mean 27) years. Two causes were identified: spilling {{of the contents of}} the <b>fondue</b> <b>pot</b> and explosion of the fondue fuel when added to the burner during a meal. The telephone interview revealed that eight people other than the respondents were burned during the same accidents. CONCLUSION: Although we identified only badly burned patients the problem may be more extensive. The knowledge of specific causes of burns from handling fondue equipment indicates that preventive action should be undertaken. More epidemiologic information is needed to obtain a precise estimate of the magnitude of this public health problem...|$|E
40|$|We {{review the}} history of the {{philosophy}} of fondue since Aristotle so as to arrive at the formulation of the paradox of Swiss fondue. Either the wine and the cheese cease to exist (Buridan), but then the fondue is not really a mixture of wine and cheese. Or the wine and the cheese continue to exist. If they do, then either they continue to exist in different places (the chemists), but then a fondue can never be perfectly homogenous (it is a French fondue). Or the wine and the cheese continue to exist in the same place (the Stoïcs), but then wine and cheese have to be, oddly, penetrable and spatially expansible. Aristote attempted to solve this paradox by arguing that the cheese and wine continue to exist, but only potentially in the fondue. We sketch an alternative answer. The wine and the cheese continue to exist, but only non-spatially in the fondue. Wine and cheese, once mixed, become non-spatial constituents of the fondue, a bit like character traits are non-spatial constituents of persons. The wine and the cheese are in the fondue, but only the fondue is there in the <b>fondue</b> <b>pot...</b>|$|E
