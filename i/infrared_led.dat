Since optical pickups do not pick up high frequencies or percussive sounds well, they are commonly paired with piezoelectric pickups to fill in the missing frequencies. LightWave Systems builds basses with optical pickups.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a system to}} land autonomously a quadrotor UAV on a static platform. It uses a web camera pointing upwards inside the landing platform and <b>infrared</b> <b>LEDs</b> on the quadrotor as markers. The web camera has an infrared cut-o ff fi lter attached to detect the <b>infrared</b> <b>LEDs</b> on the quadrotor when it flies over the platform. By means of image processing the points formed by the <b>infrared</b> <b>LEDs</b> {{are found in the}} image. These points are then identi ed and labeled to match the LED on the quadrotor that produced them. Using the location of these points in the image and on the quadrotor and the intrinsic parameters of the camera, the extrinsic parameters of the camera are calculated, i. e. the position and orientation of the quadrotor with respect to the camera. The position of the quadrotor is used as the input to four PID controllers that work simultaneously to keep the quadrotor {{in the center of the}} field of view of the camera while it descends and lands on the platform. Tests of the position estimation and control algorithms are presented. The system for autonomous landing is tested under no disturbances, static wind and dynamic wind conditions. Manual landings were performed and compared with the autonomous landing...|$|R

5000|$|The {{technical}} equipment included an ultra-high-resolution scanning Sonar [...] {{that was used}} for locating schools of juvenile herring, for guiding a ROV, which was controlled via a cyberhelmet and glove, and for determining positions, distances, and speeds. Probes measured the water salinity, temperature, and oxygen levels. Special instruments could measure plankton-, particle-, and bubble-concentrations and their size distributions. Imaging equipment included low-light still and high speed video cameras using shuttered Laser-sheet or <b>infrared</b> <b>LED</b> illumination. An endoscope-system for non-invasive optical measurements called ecoSCOPE, which could also be mounted on an ROV, was developed and used to record the microscale dynamics and behavior of the highly evasive herring.|$|E
5000|$|Magneto-optical drives are not Floptical drives, which {{likewise}} combine ferromagnetic {{and optical}} technologies, albeit {{in a different}} manner. Flopticals are 21 megabyte 3.5" [...] magnetic diskettes using optical tracks to increase the tracking precision of the magnetic head, from the usual 135 tracks per inch to 1,250 tracks per inch. No laser or heating is involved; a simple <b>infrared</b> <b>LED</b> is used to follow the optical tracks, while a magnetic head touches the recording surface. The drives can also read and write traditional 3.5" [...] diskettes, although not the 2.88 megabyte variety. Flopticals were manufactured by Insite Peripherals, a company founded by Jim Burke.|$|E

50|$|FreeTrack {{requires}} the tracking points {{to be isolated}} from all other light; this is best done using <b>infrared</b> <b>LEDs</b> and a visible-light blocking filter {{in front of the}} camera. Photographic film or the magnetic storage medium inside floppy disks can be used as inexpensive visible-light filters. Further filtering can be done in software by adjusting exposure and threshold.|$|R

5000|$|The {{technology}} involves {{reading and}} writing data magnetically, while optically aligning the read/write head in the drive using grooves in the disk being sensed by an <b>infrared</b> <b>LED</b> and sensor (a form of visual servo). The magnetic head touches the recording surface, {{as it does in}} a normal floppy drive. The optical servo tracks allow for an increase in the tracking precision of the magnetic head, from the usual 135 tracks per inch to [...] tracks per inch. Floptical disks provide 21 MB of storage. The drive has a second set of read/write heads so that it can read from and write to standard 720 kB and 1.44 MB ( [...] KiB) disks as well.|$|E
50|$|Another {{technology}} of image guidance that the CyberKnife system can use {{is called the}} Synchrony system or Synchrony method. This method uses a combination of surgically placed internal fiducials (typically small gold markers, well visible in x-ray imaging), and light emitting optical fibers (LED markers) mounted on the patient skin. LED markers are tracked by an infrared tracking camera. Since the tumor is moving continuously, to continuously image its location using X-ray cameras would require prohibitive amounts of radiation to be delivered to the patient's skin. The Synchrony system overcomes this by periodically taking images of the internal fiducials, and computing a correlation model between {{the motion of the}} external LED markers and the internal fiducials. Time stamps from the two sensors (x-ray and <b>infrared</b> <b>LED)</b> are needed to synchronize the two data streams, hence the name Synchrony.|$|E
50|$|A day {{and night}} camera is a {{security}} camera that can see the picture during the day hours, when there is enough sunlight, and during the night in total darkness or minimum illumination. A {{day and night}} camera has special lenses that allow infrared emission produced by <b>infrared</b> <b>LEDs</b> and reflected from objects to go through and reach a CCD or CMOS chip inside the camera. As a result, the end user can see picture in total darkness at the distance of infrared emission produced by LEDs. A day and night camera can have <b>infrared</b> <b>LEDs</b> mounted on its housing or can accept the emission, produced by an infrared turret. Day and night cameras often have modifications in their digital signal processor (DSP) that compensates for the difference in illumination between day and night modes. HDR technology may also be used in more expensive models {{to compensate for the}} difference in illumination between shaded and lighted areas of surveillance.|$|R
