China established a consulate in Juba in September 2008 and upgraded it to an embassy in November 2010. China has made plans to make significant investments in South Sudan.|$|E
5|$|An {{announcement}} was made that Brosnan and director Martin Campbell will team up once again for a film adaptation of an Ernest Hemingway novel, Across the River and into the Trees, in which Brosnan will {{play the role of}} the protagonist, Colonel Cantwell. However, according to Campbell, the film's production and development fell apart due to financial issues hence its delay, but as of October 2017, it is back <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pipeline</b> for which he's hopeful to begin working on, soon. Brosnan later joined Jamie Dornan and Cillian Murphy in a film based on the events of The Maze Prison Escape, titled H-Block which is to be directed by Jim Sheridan.|$|E
5|$|Howe was {{determined}} that the pipeline not be delayed, and proposed that the government advance money to the pipeline company to ensure construction in 1956. He emotionally pleaded with his Cabinet colleagues, who agreed both to the proposal and {{to the use of}} rarely used closure to limit the debate. Closure had not been applied in the House since 1932. The issue was attractive to the Tories and CCF with an election due within two years; it would allow them to portray Howe as an arrogant dictator, and play to those citizens who disliked the American involvement <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pipeline</b> project. If the bill did not receive Royal Assent by 7 June 1956, options that Trans-Canada held for steel pipe would expire.|$|E
30|$|<b>The</b> fluid used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{gas and oil}} {{pipeline}} pressure testing was water at a temperature of 15  °C. <b>The</b> hydrotest pressure <b>in</b> <b>the</b> gas <b>pipeline</b> (15  MPa) was greater than that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> oil <b>pipeline</b> (13.5  MPa), but <b>the</b> average stress <b>in</b> <b>the</b> gas <b>pipeline</b> (358.03  MPa) was smaller than that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> oil <b>pipeline</b> (451.39  MPa), showing that a greater pipe diameter results in a superior ability to bear pressure.|$|R
50|$|During its existence, <b>the</b> <b>pipeline</b> {{has often}} been {{attacked}} by guerrilla organizations that oppose the Colombian government. Even <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pipeline's</b> first year, it was bombed as frequently as once per week.|$|R

5|$|In 1976, workers' pay {{averaged}} between $11 and $18 per hour, {{depending on}} the position. With workweeks averaging between 70 and 84 hours per week, the problem for many workers became {{what to do with}} so much extra money. Teamster Jerry Thornhill, a typical worker, wrote to Money magazine, asking for advice. Thornhill detailed a pay rate of $57,000 per year at a time when members of Congress earned $42,500 annually, professional football players averaged $40,000, and U.S. vice president Nelson Rockefeller earned $62,500. The large amounts of money <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pipeline</b> camps and a lack of entertainment caused frequent gambling games that sometimes involved tens of thousands of dollars. Instead of gambling, other workers saved their money for monthlong vacations to Hawaii or other warm climates, then returned to work with no money remaining.|$|E
5|$|The {{renewable}} energy industry supports more than 11,500 jobs in Scotland, {{according to a}} 2013 study by Scottish Renewables. However a 2011 study by 4-Consulting calculated that there was probably a small net loss in jobs in Scotland from government support for {{renewable energy}}. They estimated that the offshore wind industry might create between 300–2,200 long-term jobs by 2020. With 20 GW of renewable energy projects <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pipeline,</b> the sector {{has the potential to}} grow quickly in the years ahead creating more jobs in the region. Glasgow, Fife and Edinburgh are key centres of offshore wind power development, and the emerging wave power and tidal power industries are centred around the Highlands and Islands. Rural job creation is being supported by bioenergy systems in areas such as Lochaber, Moray and Dumfries and Galloway.|$|E
5|$|Public {{transport}} in Kuala Lumpur and {{the rest}} of the Klang Valley covers a variety of transport modes such as bus, rail and taxi. Despite efforts to promote usage of public transport, utilisation rates are low as only 16 percent of the population used public transport in 2006. However, public transport utilisation is set to rise with the opening of 2 light metro (LRT) extension lines on 30 June 2016. Rail transport in Kuala Lumpur encompasses the light metro (LRT), monorail, commuter rail and Airport rail link. The LRT system has 2 lines namely, Kelana Jaya Line and Ampang Line, connecting many locations in the city with major suburbs in Greater Kuala Lumpur. The Monorail serves various key locations in the city centre whereas the KTM Komuter runs between the city and the suburbs. The main rapid transit hub is KL Sentral, which is an interchange station for the rail systems. KL Sentral is also a hub for intercity railway service namely KTM Intercity and KTM ETS. It provides rail services to as far as Singapore in the south, and Hat Yai, Thailand, in the north. The rail system in Kuala Lumpur is expanding fast with more train lines due for completion or <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pipeline.</b> In December 2016, the 1st phase of Klang Valley Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) Project, Sungai Buloh-Kajang Line was completed, the remaining phases of the line has been open in July 2017, providing a more efficient ride around Greater Kuala Lumpur.|$|E
30|$|The {{impact of}} pigging {{had a small}} effect on <b>the</b> stress <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pipelines.</b> Pigging {{increased}} <b>the</b> stress <b>in</b> <b>the</b> gas <b>pipeline</b> by 0.14  % and by 0.003  % <b>in</b> <b>the</b> oil <b>pipeline,</b> indicating that pigging has relatively significant effects on gas pipelines relative to oil <b>pipeline.</b> Because <b>the</b> angles of <b>the</b> inclined <b>pipelines</b> <b>in</b> this study were small, the effects of pigging were not significant. In high and steep slope projects where the angle is extreme, importance should {{be attached to the}} stress analysis of gas pipelines during pigging considering the great compressibility of gas.|$|R
30|$|The public must be {{encouraged}} to inform the appropriate GWCL office of any leakages <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pipelines</b> <b>in</b> their locality. GWCL must provide toll free lines to facilitate easy communication.|$|R
