40|$|Calyceal diverticula are congenital, nonsecretory {{abnormalities}} {{in which}} the transitional cell-lined cavity communicates with the renal collecting system. Here we present {{the case of a}} calyceal diverticular abscess during pregnancy. A 40 -year-old primiparous woman developed the abscess at 23 weeks of gestation, with right flank pain and a 37. 8 °C fever. A transabdominal ultrasound revealed a 12 × 10 [*]cm cystic mass in the right kidney. She was initially diagnosed with a simple renal cyst infection, and intravenous antibiotics were initiated. Percutaneous drainage was started at 26 weeks of gestation. When urine excretion from the cyst was confirmed by dye test using <b>indigotindisulfonate</b> <b>sodium,</b> the patient was diagnosed with a calyceal diverticular abscess. She gave birth to a 2, 870 [*]g healthy male at 38 weeks of gestation. Percutaneous drainage with low-dose antimicrobial therapy could thus allow for the continued pregnancy of women with a calyceal diverticular abscess until full term...|$|E
