5|$|More {{than twenty}} species of <b>hawk,</b> <b>owl</b> and falcon {{are known to}} {{occasionally}} predate feral starlings in North America, though the most regular predators of adults {{are likely to be}} urban-living peregrine falcons or merlins (Falco columbarius). Common mynas (Acridotheres tristis) sometimes evict eggs, nestlings and adult common starlings from their nests, and the lesser honeyguide (Indicator minor), a brood parasite, uses the common starling as a host. Starlings are more commonly the culprits rather than victims of nest eviction however, especially towards other starlings and woodpeckers. Nests can be raided by animals capable of climbing to them, such as stoats (Mustela erminea), raccoons (Procyon lotor) and squirrels (Sciurus spp.), and cats may catch the unwary.|$|E

40|$|Human-Wildlife Conflicts: <b>Hawks</b> and <b>owls</b> can {{negatively}} impact {{a variety}} of human interests, including important natural resources, livestock and game bird production, human health and safety, and companion animals.
