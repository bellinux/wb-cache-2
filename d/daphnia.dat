5|$|Although zinc is an {{essential}} requirement for good health, excess zinc can be harmful. Excessive absorption of zinc suppresses copper and iron absorption. The free zinc ion in solution is highly toxic to plants, invertebrates, and even vertebrate fish. The Free Ion Activity Model is well-established in the literature, and shows that just micromolar amounts of the free ion kills some organisms. A recent example showed 6 micromolar killing 93% of all <b>Daphnia</b> in water.|$|E
5|$|A year later, Mechnikov {{studied a}} fresh water {{crustacean}} called <b>Daphnia,</b> a tiny transparent animal {{that can be}} examined directly under a microscope. He discovered that fungal spores that attacked the animal were destroyed by phagocytes. He went on to extend his observations to the white blood cells of mammals and discovered that the bacterium Bacillus anthracis could be engulfed and killed by phagocytes, a process that he called phagocytosis. Mechnikov proposed that phagocytes were a primary defense against invading organisms.|$|E
5|$|Aquatic midges (Chironomidae) {{provide the}} highest {{proportion}} of the fly life of the lake. The trout (Salmonidae) will feed at the surface on these and water boatmen (Corixidae), and below the surface on the caddisfly (Trichoptera) larvae and pupae; they will also take the adult caddisflies when they emerge. Other aquatic fauna including <b>daphnia</b> and snails are {{also found in the}} lake. Large populations of dragonflies, including migrant hawker (Aeshna mixta) and significant numbers of ruddy darter (Sympetrum sanguineum), occur at the lake. Eleven species of wainscot moth make their home in the reed beds, including the nationally local brown-veined wainscot (Archanara dissoluta), twin-spotted wainscot (Archanara geminipuncta) and silky wainscot (Chilodes maritimus).|$|E
25|$|The young free-swimming pike feed {{on small}} {{invertebrates}} starting with <b>daphnia,</b> and quickly {{moving on to}} bigger prey, such as the isopods asellus or gammarus. When the body length is , they start feeding on small fish.|$|E
25|$|The {{logistic}} {{growth curve}} is initially {{very similar to}} the exponential growth curve. When population density is low, individuals are free from competition and can grow rapidly. However, as the population reaches its maximum (the carrying capacity), intraspecific competition becomes fiercer and the per capita growth rate slows until the population reaches a stable size. At the carrying capacity, the rate of change of population density is zero because the population is as large as possible based on the resources available. Experiments on <b>Daphnia</b> growth rates showed a striking adherence to the logistic growth curve. The inflexion point in the <b>Daphnia</b> population density graph occurred at half the carrying capacity, as predicted by the logistic growth model.|$|E
25|$|Lagoons or ponds provide {{settlement}} and further biological improvement through storage in large man-made ponds or lagoons. These lagoons are highly aerobic and colonization by native macrophytes, especially reeds, is often encouraged. Small filter-feeding invertebrates such as <b>Daphnia</b> and species of Rotifera greatly assist in treatment by removing fine particulates.|$|E
25|$|Following this introduction, the sardine {{has gained}} {{substantial}} economic and nutritional {{importance for the}} lakeside human population but from an ecosystem standpoint, the introduction of planktivorous fish may result in important modifications of plankton community structure. Recent observations showed the disappearance during the last decades of a large grazer, <b>Daphnia</b> curvirostris, and the dominance of mesozooplankton community by three species of cyclopoid copepod: Thermocyclops consimilis, Mesocyclops aequatorialis and Tropocyclops confinis.|$|E
25|$|Drinking {{water is}} {{supplied}} by offering crickets a wet sponge or spraying their container, but never directly: crickets easily drown even in small dishes of water. Crickets feed on {{all kinds of}} fresh fruit and greens; industrial breeders also feed bulk quantities of dry fish food – <b>Daphnia</b> and Gammarus. Contrary to the Eastern approach of keeping males in solitary cells, keeping males together is acceptable: According to Amato, protein-rich diet reduces the males' drive to fight.|$|E
25|$|Since the 1960s, the Lake's {{food web}} and {{zooplankton}} populations have undergone major changes. In 1963–65, opossum shrimp (Mysis diluviana) {{were introduced to}} enhance the food supply for the introduced Kokanee salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka). The shrimp began feeding on the lake's cladocerans (<b>Daphnia</b> and Bosmina), and their populations virtually disappeared by 1971. The shrimp provide a food resource for salmon and trout, but also compete with juvenile fish for zooplankton. Since the 1970s, the cladoceran populations have somewhat recovered, but not to former levels.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{suggest that}} light {{pollution}} around lakes prevents zooplankton, such as <b>Daphnia,</b> from eating surface algae, causing algal blooms that can kill off the lakes' plants and lower water quality. Light pollution may also affect ecosystems in other ways. For example, lepidopterists and entomologists have documented that nighttime light {{may interfere with}} the ability of moths and other nocturnal insects to navigate. Night-blooming flowers that depend on moths for pollination may be affected by night lighting, {{as there is no}} replacement pollinator that would not be affected by the artificial light. This can lead to species decline of plants that are unable to reproduce, and change an area's longterm ecology.|$|E
25|$|Like all Corydoras species, {{the fish}} feeds {{primarily}} upon animal matter. The aquarist is advised, however, {{that the traditional}} use of Corydoras catfishes as putative 'scavengers' in an aquarium setting will be detrimental {{to the well-being of}} this species—it requires high quality foods for long-term maintenance, and a varied diet. Ideally, the fish should be given live foods at least intermittently, and will dine enthusiastically upon such items as Bloodworms (larvae of Chironomus midges), <b>Daphnia,</b> cultivated Brine Shrimp (Atermia salina), and Tubifex worms. The last, however, should be cultivated in order to minimise the risk of introducing pathogenic organisms to the aquarium, as Tubifex live in unsanitary conditions in the wild. Freeze dried Tubifex may be preferable, as the risk of introduction of disease is eliminated. High quality flake foods are also appreciated, particularly those containing shrimp or other similar matter.|$|E
25|$|Bladder traps are {{exclusive}} to the genus Utricularia, or bladderworts. The bladders (vesicula) pump ions {{out of their}} interiors. Water follows by osmosis, generating a partial vacuum inside the bladder. The bladder has a small opening, sealed by a hinged door. In aquatic species, the door has a pair of long trigger hairs. Aquatic invertebrates such as <b>Daphnia</b> touch these hairs and deform the door by lever action, releasing the vacuum. The invertebrate is sucked into the bladder, where it is digested. Many species of Utricularia (such as U. sandersonii) are terrestrial, growing in waterlogged soil, and their trapping mechanism is triggered {{in a slightly different}} manner. Bladderworts lack roots, but terrestrial species have anchoring stems that resemble roots. Temperate aquatic bladderworts generally die back to a resting turion during the winter months, and U. macrorhiza appears to regulate the number of bladders it bears in response to the prevailing nutrient content of its habitat.|$|E
25|$|Parthenogenesis is seen {{to occur}} {{naturally}} in aphids, <b>Daphnia,</b> rotifers, nematodes and some other invertebrates, {{as well as in}} many plants. Among vertebrates, strict parthenogenesis is only known to occur in lizards, snakes, birds and sharks, with fish, amphibians and reptiles exhibiting various forms of gynogenesis and hybridogenesis (an incomplete form of parthenogenesis). The first all-female (unisexual) reproduction in vertebrates was described in the fish Poecilia formosa in 1932. Since then at least 50 species of unisexual vertebrate have been described, including at least 20 fish, 25 lizards, a single snake species, frogs, and salamanders. Other, usually sexual, species may occasionally reproduce parthenogenetically and Komodo dragons; the hammerhead and blacktip sharks are recent additions to the known list of spontaneous parthenogenetic vertebrates. As with all types of asexual reproduction, there are both costs (low genetic diversity and therefore susceptibility to adverse mutations that might occur) and benefits (reproduction without the need for a male) associated with parthenogenesis.|$|E
25|$|Gap Junctions {{have been}} {{observed}} in various animal organs and tissues where cells contact each other. From the 1950s to 1970s they were detected in crayfish nerves, rat pancreas, liver, adrenal cortex, epididymis, duodenum, muscle, <b>Daphnia</b> hepatic caecum, Hydra muscle, monkey retina, rabbit cornea, fish blastoderm, frog embryos, rabbit ovary, re-aggregating cells, cockroach hemocyte capsules, rabbit skin, chick embryos, human islet of Langerhans, goldfish and hamster pressure sensing acoustico-vestibular receptors, lamprey and tunicate heart, rat seminiferous tubules, myometrium, eye lens and cephalopod digestive epithelium. Since the 1970s gap junctions have continued {{to be found in}} nearly all animal cells that touch each other. By the 1990s new technology such as confocal microscopy allowed more rapid survey of large areas of tissue. Since the 1970s even tissues that were traditionally considered to possibly have isolated cells such as bone showed that the cells were still connected with gap junctions, however tenuously. Gap junctions appear to be in all animal organs and tissues and {{it will be interesting to}} find exceptions to this other than cells not normally in contact with neighboring cells. Adult skeletal muscle is a possible exception. It may be argued that if present in skeletal muscle, gap junctions might propagate contractions in an arbitrary way among cells making up the muscle. At least in some cases this may not be the case as shown in other muscle types that do have gap junctions. An indication of what results from reduction or absence of gap junctions may be indicated by analysis of cancers or the aging process.|$|E
500|$|Young American {{paddlefish}} {{are poor}} swimmers {{which makes them}} susceptible to predation. [...] Therefore, rapid first-year growth is important to their survival. [...] Fry can grow about [...] per week, and by late July the fingerlings are around [...] long. [...] Their rate of growth is variable and highly dependent on food abundance. [...] Higher growth rates occur in areas where food is not limited. [...] The feeding behavior of fingerlings {{is quite different from}} that of older juveniles and adults. They capture individual plankton one by one, which requires detection and location of individual <b>Daphnia</b> on approach, followed by an intercept maneuver to capture the selected prey. [...] By late September fingerlings have developed into juveniles, and are around [...] long. [...] After the 1st year their growth rate slows and is highly variable. [...] Studies indicate that by age 5 their growth rate averages around [...] per year depending on the abundance of food and other environmental influences.|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{building}} of the causeway, a [...] landfill was built near the river. Various materials were disposed of in the area, including petroleum waste oil, pipe and foam insulation, sewage sludge, and medical waste. While the landfill was shut down in 1992, samples by the Environmental Bureau of Investigation and the Petitcodiac Riverkeeper showed that ammonium levels around the leachate exceeded Canadian quality guidelines by as much as 15 times, and contained heavy metals, petroleum hydrocarbons, and PCBs. A mortality rate of 100percent was found for test trout and <b>daphnia</b> when exposed to water samples. Gemtec Limited, the company responsible for planning and closing the landfill, and the City of Moncton were charged on 12 March 2002, for offences relating to the Canadian Environmental Protection Act (1999) and the Fisheries Act. The city pleaded guilty on 23 September 2003, paid a $35,000 fine, and was ordered to help reduce the leachate flow from the landfill. Three years later, Gemtec Limited was fined a total of $6,000 and was ordered to contribute a total of $22,000 to the federal Environmental Damages Fund and the Jonathan Creek Committee.|$|E
2500|$|Crustacean {{reproduction}} varies both {{across and}} within species. The water flea <b>Daphnia</b> pulex alternates between sexual and parthenogenetic reproduction. [...] Among the better-known large decapod crustaceans, some crayfish reproduce by parthenogensis. [...] "Marmorkrebs" [...] are parthenogenetic crayfish that {{were discovered in}} the pet trade in the 1990s. [...] Offspring are genetically identical to the parent, indicating it reproduces by apomixis, i.e. parthenogenesis in which the eggs did not undergo meiosis. Spinycheek crayfish (Orconectes limosus) can reproduce both sexually and by parthenogenesis. The Louisiana red swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii), which normally reproduces sexually, has also been suggested to reproduce by parthenogenesis, although no individuals of this species have been reared this way in the lab. Artemia parthenogenetica is a species or series of populations of parthenogenetic brine shrimps.|$|E
2500|$|Dried eggs of Triops longicaudatus {{are sold}} in kits to be raised as {{aquarium}} pets, sold {{under the name of}} [...] "aquasaurs", [...] "trigons" [...] or [...] "triops". These are most often of the greenish-brown variety, but the red variant is fairly common among enthusiasts. Captive Triops are frequently kept in aquariums and fed a diet consisting mainly of carrots, shrimp pellets and dried shrimp. Often they are also given living shrimp and <b>daphnia</b> as live prey. Because they can feed on just about anything, they are also fed lunch meat, potatoes, crackers, etc. They will often feed themselves by grazing on algae and other grunge from the bottom and sides of the tank and on small particles clinging to sponge filters or to Marimo moss balls, which are often cultured alongside Triops.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first attempt}} made at {{quantifying}} the temporal storage effect was by Cáceres in 1997. [...] Using 30 years of water-column data from Oneida Lake, New York, {{she studied the}} effect the storage effect had on two species of plankton (<b>Daphnia</b> galeata mendotae and D. pulicaria). [...] These species of plankton lay diapausing eggs which, much like the seeds of annual plants, lay dormant in the sediment for many years before hatching. [...] Cáceres found {{that the size of}} reproductive bouts were fairly uncorrelated between the two species. [...] She also found, {{in the absence of the}} storage effect, D. galeata mendotae would have gone extinct. [...] She was unable to measure certain important parameters (such as the rate of egg predation), but found that her results were robust to a wide range of estimates.|$|E
2500|$|Ecologists {{collect data}} on trophic levels and food webs to {{statistically}} model and mathematically calculate parameters, such as those used in other kinds of network analysis (e.g., graph theory), to study emergent patterns and properties shared among ecosystems. There are different ecological dimensions that can be mapped to create more complicated food webs, including: species composition (type of species), richness (number of species), biomass (the dry weight of plants and animals), productivity (rates of conversion of energy and nutrients into growth), and stability (food webs over time). A food web diagram illustrating species composition shows how change in a single species can directly and indirectly influence many others. [...] are used to simplify food web research into semi-isolated units such as small springs, decaying logs, and laboratory experiments using organisms that reproduce quickly, such as <b>daphnia</b> feeding on algae grown under controlled environments in jars of water.|$|E
2500|$|All Utricularia are {{carnivorous}} {{and capture}} small organisms {{by means of}} bladder-like traps. Terrestrial species tend to have tiny traps that feed on minute prey such as protozoa and rotifers swimming in water-saturated soil. The traps can {{range in size from}} 0.2mm to 1.2cm. Aquatic species, such as U.vulgaris (common bladderwort), possess bladders that are usually larger and can feed on more substantial prey such as water fleas (<b>Daphnia),</b> nematodes and even fish fry, mosquito larvae and young tadpoles. Despite their small size, the traps are extremely sophisticated. In the active traps of the aquatic species, prey brush against trigger hairs connected to the trapdoor. The bladder, when [...] "set", is under negative pressure in relation to its environment so that when the trapdoor is mechanically triggered, the prey, along with the water surrounding it, is sucked into the bladder. Once the bladder is full of water, the door closes again, the whole process taking only ten to fifteen thousandths of a second.|$|E
2500|$|Some species {{reproduce}} {{exclusively by}} parthenogenesis (such as the Bdelloid rotifers), while others can switch between sexual reproduction and parthenogenesis. This is called facultative parthenogenesis (other terms are cyclical parthenogenesis, heterogamy or heterogony). The switch between sexuality and parthenogenesis in such species may {{be triggered by}} the season (aphid, some gall wasps), or {{by a lack of}} males or by conditions that favour rapid population growth (rotifers and cladocerans like <b>daphnia).</b> In these species asexual reproduction occurs either in summer (aphids) or as long as conditions are favourable. This is because in asexual reproduction a successful genotype can spread quickly without being modified by sex or wasting resources on male offspring who won't give birth. In times of stress, offspring produced by sexual reproduction may be fitter as they have new, possibly beneficial gene combinations. In addition, sexual reproduction provides the benefit of meiotic recombination between non-sister chromosomes, a process associated with repair of DNA double-strand breaks and other DNA damages that may be induced by stressful conditions. (See also Meiosis section: Origin and function of meiosis.) ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{nature of}} prey {{selection}} by two centrarchids (white crappie and bluegill) {{has been presented}} as a model incorporating optimal foraging strategies by Manatunge & Asaeda [...] The visual field of the foraging fish as represented by the reactive distance was [...] analysed in detail to estimate the number of prey encounters per search bout. The predicted reactive distances were compared with experimental data. The energetic cost associated with fish foraging behaviour was calculated based on {{the sequence of events}} that takes place for each prey consumed. Comparisons of the relative abundance of prey species and size categories in the stomach to the lake environment indicated that both white crappie and bluegill (length < 100nbsp&mm) strongly select prey utilizing an energy optimization strategy. In most cases, the fish exclusively selected large <b>Daphnia</b> ignoring evasive prey types (Cyclops, Diaptomids) and small cladocera. This selectivity is the result of fish actively avoiding prey with high evasion capabilities even though they appear to be high in energetic content and having translated this into optimal selectivity through capture success rates. The energy consideration and visual system, apart from the forager's ability to capture prey, are the major determinants of prey selectivity for large-sized bluegill and white crappie still at planktivorous stages.|$|E
2500|$|Zooplankton {{are tiny}} animals {{suspended}} {{in the water column}}. [...] Like phytoplankton, these species have developed mechanisms that keep them from sinking to deeper waters, including drag-inducing body forms and the active flicking of appendages such as antennae or spines. Remaining in the water column may have its advantages in terms of feeding, but this zone’s lack of refugia leaves zooplankton vulnerable to predation. [...] In response, some species, especially <b>Daphnia</b> sp., make daily vertical migrations in the water column by passively sinking to the darker lower depths during the day and actively moving towards the surface during the night. Also, because conditions in a lentic system can be quite variable across seasons, zooplankton have the ability to switch from laying regular eggs to resting eggs when {{there is a lack of}} food, temperatures fall below 2°C, or if predator abundance is high. [...] These resting eggs have a diapause, or dormancy period that should allow the zooplankton to encounter conditions that are more favorable to survival when they finally hatch. The invertebrates that inhabit the benthic zone are numerically dominated by small species and are species rich compared to the zooplankton of the open water. [...] They include Crustaceans (e.g. crabs, crayfish, and shrimp), molluscs (e.g. clams and snails), and numerous types of insects. These organisms are mostly found in the areas of macrophyte growth, where the richest resources, highly oxygenated water, and warmest portion of the ecosystem are found. [...] The structurally diverse macrophyte beds are important sites for the accumulation of organic matter, and provide an ideal area for colonization. [...] The sediments and plants also offer a great deal of protection from predatory fishes.|$|E
60|$|Animals {{enter the}} {{bladders}} by bending inwards the posterior free {{edge of the}} valve, which from being highly elastic shuts again instantly. As the edge is extremely thin, and fits closely {{against the edge of}} the collar, both projecting into the bladder (see section, fig. 20), it would evidently be very difficult for any animal to get out when once imprisoned, and apparently they never do escape. To show how closely the edge [page 406] fits, I may mention that my son found a <b>Daphnia</b> which had inserted one of its antennae into the slit, and it was thus held fast during a whole day. On three or four occasions I have seen long narrow larvae, both dead and alive, wedged between the corner of the valve and collar, with half their bodies within the bladder and half out.|$|E
