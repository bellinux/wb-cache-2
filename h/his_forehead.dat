5|$|Meanwhile, Stewie {{trains in}} {{gymnastics}} {{to participate in}} the Olympics, but an accident during training leaves him with a shard of glass in <b>his</b> <b>forehead.</b>|$|E
5|$|Alexios and his guards {{resisted}} {{as long as}} {{they could}} before retreating. As they retreated, Alexios was separated from his guard and was attacked by Norman soldiers. While escaping, he was wounded in <b>his</b> <b>forehead</b> and lost a lot of blood, but eventually made it back to Ohrid, where he regrouped his army.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Goodman {{put down}} 'is {{knife and fork}} and {{wrinkled}} up <b>'is</b> <b>forehead.</b>|$|R

5|$|Bhikshatana is {{depicted}} with jatabhadra (dishevelled matted locks) or with jatamandala (matted hair {{arranged in a}} circle). A serpent may be depicted in his matted hair, which is also adorned by the crescent moon. <b>His</b> <b>forehead</b> bears a tripundara, the Shaiva tilaka composed of three horizontal lines of sacred ash with a red dot in the middle representing the third eye. He wears a patta (ornamental head band)—sometimes adorned with a human skull motif—on <b>his</b> <b>forehead.</b> Snake ornaments adorn his body, and bronze images often depict multiple necklaces, a waist-band, armlets, elbow bands, bracelets, anklets, and rings on all his toes and fingers. A snake is also tied around his waist and a white yagnopavita (sacred thread) is worn across the chest.|$|E
5|$|Following {{issues with}} his make-up {{throughout}} the first season, Michael Dorn's Klingon prosthetics were modified. Michael Westmore made the headpiece simpler, and Dorn took to wearing a headband under the headpiece to reduce a skin rash on <b>his</b> <b>forehead.</b> The headpiece was then glued down around the edges.|$|E
5|$|Aravan {{is always}} worshipped in temples {{in the form}} of his severed head. He is usually {{depicted}} with a moustache, pronounced eyes and large ears. Typically, he also wears a conical crown, a Vaishnava tilak mark on <b>his</b> <b>forehead</b> and earrings. Aravan is often depicted with a cobra hood over his crown, cobra heads sprouting through the crown, or a snake emerging from behind the crown. Even the chief Koovagam icon features a serpent on Aravan's crown.|$|E
50|$|Of note, {{even to this}} day, the Sahasrarjun temple at Maheshwar lights 11 lamps in honour of Lord Agni blessing the Kingdom. Alternatively, this {{tradition}} is attributed to Sahasrarjun queens humiliating captive ten-headed Ravana by lighting up candles on <b>his</b> <b>foreheads.</b>|$|R

6000|$|His wimple, his blunt-prowed face, [...] <b>His</b> low <b>forehead,</b> <b>his</b> skinny neck, his long, [...] scaled, striving legs, [...] So striving, striving, [...] Are all more {{delicate}} than she, [...] And {{he has a}} cruel scar on his shell.|$|R
5|$|During the event, five wrestlers {{suffered}} legitimate injuries. Randy Orton dislocated {{his shoulder}} while Ted DiBiase suffered a concussion, {{and although they}} both appeared on Raw the following night, they did not wrestle.

Batista suffered a back and tailbone injury during his match with John Cena, who himself suffered a laceration and lost a tooth.|$|E
5|$|Hubbard's health {{deteriorated}} significantly {{during this}} period. A chain-smoker, he also suffered from bursitis and excessive weight, {{and had a}} prominent growth on <b>his</b> <b>forehead.</b> He suffered serious injuries in a motorcycle accident in 1973 and {{had a heart attack}} in 1975 that required him to take anticoagulant drugs for the next year. In September 1978, Hubbard had a pulmonary embolism, falling into a coma, but recovered.|$|E
5|$|Judah {{made his}} {{professional}} debut as an 18-year-old on September 20, 1996, in Miami, Florida and defeated Michael Johnson by technical knockout {{in the second}} round.

5|$|Lowell did {{not know}} what {{vocation}} to choose after graduating, and he vacillated among business, the ministry, medicine, and law. He ultimately enrolled at Harvard Law School in 1840 and was admitted to the bar two years later. While studying law, however, he contributed poems and prose articles to various magazines. During this time, he was admittedly depressed and often had suicidal thoughts. He once confided to a friend that he held a cocked pistol to <b>his</b> <b>forehead</b> and considered killing himself at the age of 20.|$|E
5|$|Several wrestlers {{were injured}} at the show. Abyss {{suffered}} several serious cuts {{to his left}} arm, while Sabu had cuts on his arms, legs, and face. Both wrestlers required several stitches after their match. A.J. Styles busted his lip during his title defense, requiring stitches, while Samoa Joe dislocated his jaw. Raven busted his lip but no stitches were required. Jeff Jarrett suffered a bad cut to <b>his</b> <b>forehead</b> during the main event. Lastly, James Storm {{was diagnosed with a}} neck stinger.|$|E
5|$|The iconographical {{attributes}} of Shiva are the serpent around his neck, the adorning crescent moon, the holy river Ganga flowing from his matted hair, the third eye on <b>his</b> <b>forehead,</b> the trishula as his weapon and the damaru.

60|$|Mr. Ravenor {{turned to}} me with a slight frown upon <b>his</b> fine <b>forehead.</b>|$|R
60|$|I {{could not}} help smiling--until I saw a frown {{gathering}} on <b>his</b> inscrutable <b>forehead.</b>|$|R
60|$|Caligula {{uttered a}} loud cry {{of rage and}} of fear and {{struggled}} to his feet. He staggered forward {{out of the darkness}} and into the light, his trembling arms outstretched, his sparse hair plastered against <b>his</b> moist <b>forehead,</b> <b>his</b> eyes, protruding and bloodshot, fixed upon the praefect.|$|R
5|$|Death metal, like thrash metal, {{generally}} {{rejects the}} theatrics of earlier metal styles, opting instead for an everyday look of ripped jeans and plain leather jackets. One major {{exception to this}} rule was Deicide's Glen Benton, who branded an inverted cross on <b>his</b> <b>forehead</b> and wore armor on stage. Morbid Angel adopted neo-fascist imagery. These two bands, along with Death and Obituary, were leaders of the major death metal scene that emerged in Florida in the mid-1980s. In the UK, the related style of grindcore, led by bands such as Napalm Death and Extreme Noise Terror, emerged from the anarcho-punk movement.|$|E
5|$|During the screening, {{the court}} heard that Muhammad had {{raised his hand}} to <b>his</b> <b>forehead</b> and moved his leg after the {{cameraman}} had said he was dead, {{and that there was}} no blood on his shirt. Enderlin argued that the cameraman had not said the boy was dead, but that he was dying. A report prepared for the court by Jean-Claude Schlinger, a ballistics expert commissioned by Karsenty, said that had the shots come from the Israeli position, Muhammad would have been hit in the lower limbs only.|$|E
5|$|Gummadi Venkateswara Rao was {{recommended}} to Chakrapani by Madhavapeddi Venkatramaiah. After auditioning other actors, Chakrapani asked Venkateswara Rao {{to make a}} cameo appearance as an interviewer. He received 5001,000 for a day's work, a generous salary for the time; actors in major film roles received 2,000 for 20 days of work. Chakrapani justified Venkateswara Rao's salary {{by saying that the}} actor's family included three children who had moved to Madras (now Chennai). For a photo shoot, Rama Rao lent Venkateswara Rao his coat and placed a tilaka on <b>his</b> <b>forehead.</b> Allu Ramalingaiah was cast as the comic teacher-cum-ayurvedic-doctor Panthulu.|$|E
5000|$|He was nicknamed [...] "The Mekon" [...] {{because of}} <b>his</b> {{prominent}} <b>forehead</b> and overbearing manner.|$|R
60|$|He sat up, and, fixing {{abruptly}} {{his eyes}} on Babalatchi, tapped <b>his</b> own <b>forehead</b> significantly.|$|R
60|$|Granet {{thrust his}} hands into his {{trousers}} pockets. There was a frown upon <b>his</b> fine <b>forehead.</b>|$|R
5|$|He {{was dressed}} in a strange way. A šajkača was pulled to the front of his head and almost {{completely}} covered <b>his</b> <b>forehead.</b> His eyebrows were hardly visible. Under its weight, the ears seemed to have collapsed. He wore a kind of long, black coat, covered in mud and held in place by a string. He used another piece of string for a belt, and from it hung a pot for boiling water, a tea strainer, a canteen, and other useful things. He walked slightly bent forward, followed everywhere by the noise of the things clashing at his waist.|$|E
5|$|In some European Celtic or Germanic {{countries}} {{prior to}} the adoption of Christianity, the ruler upon his election was raised on a shield and, while standing upon it, was borne on the shoulders of several chief men of the nation (or tribe) in a procession around his assembled subjects. This was usually performed three times. Following this, the king was given a spear, and a diadem wrought of silk or linen (not to be confused with a crown) was bound around <b>his</b> <b>forehead</b> as a token of regal authority.|$|E
5|$|Kishimoto {{has noted}} that he likes Shikamaru due to his easygoing nature despite being a genius, and contrasted him against Sasuke Uchiha's {{intelligent}} but abrasive personality. Kishimoto also comically remarked that he would marry Shikamaru {{if he were a}} girl, noting that Shikamaru would likely be successful in life. When designing Shikamaru's Part II appearance, Kishimoto wanted to give Shikamaru a unique appearance despite drawing him with a vest that several other ninja wear in the series. As a result, he drew <b>his</b> <b>forehead</b> protector on his arm in order to not obscure his hair.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Helstone {{pushed out}} his cynical lip, {{wrinkled}} <b>his</b> brown <b>forehead,</b> and gave an inarticulate grunt.|$|R
60|$|The {{perspiration}} {{broke out}} thickly on <b>his</b> broad <b>forehead.</b> <b>His</b> left hand stole {{over the edge}} of the table. There was a drawer in it, with a lock, and the key was in the lock. His finger and thumb closed over the key, but did not turn it.|$|R
5000|$|Facial subdermal {{implants}} {{to change}} the shape of <b>his</b> brow, <b>forehead,</b> and {{the bridge of his}} nose ...|$|R
