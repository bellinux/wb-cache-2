Purpose – This paper aims {{to review}} the {{evolution}} of a nation-wide Document Delivery Service in Korea over the past decade, focusing on how the service has been reconfigured to sustain and fortify its position as a central channel for accessing information in the era of abundant digital resources. Design/methodology/approach – The impacts of policy changes and technical improvements introduced incrementally over the years on the advance of the service are analyzed. The overall statistics over the period of 14 years are first presented to show the changing trends of the service, and the transaction log of the period of nine years is analyzed in detail to examine the impact of policy implementation and technical advancement on {{the quantity and quality of}} the service. Findings – The transaction log analysis has uncovered the two main themes or directions of changes that have contributed to its robustness. First, changes introduced to streamline the service process both on the request end (unmediated requests) and on the <b>delivery</b> <b>end</b> (electronic delivery) have brought a sizable improvement on the speed of the service.

40|$|Provides a {{constant}} surveillance of end tidal CO 2 in ventilated infants demonstrating a trend of CO 2 levels and correct positioning of ETT. The {{accuracy of the}} reading will be dependant on the weight of patient and respiratory rate, accuracy decreasing in VLBW infants and increased respiratory rate. The reading will provide a wave form and indicate a trend in values rather than an accurate value. The use of TCM’s will initially still be required to establish the accuracy level. INCLUSION CRITERIA Infants over 2 kg who are: 1. Post op cardiac patients 2. Ventilated and transferring between departments where possible 3. Heavily sedated / muscle relaxed. KEY POINTS The end tidal devise has a dead space of 0. 5 ml. End tidal CO 2 units are single use and last for 72 hours. This time will be reduced with increased ETT secretions and humidity. Keep the sample line facing up and line under the heat source {{as much as possible}} to reduce rainout in the device. It is advisable to remove the humidification from the End Tidal device, approximately every 4 hours. Remove the device from the ETT (reconnect ventilator to the patient), air dry the unit and reinsert. This can aid in improving the accuracy of readings. TCMs should be re-membraned prior to use with each new patient and run in conjunction with End Tidal CO 2. The device should not be used for 4 hours post surfactant <b>delivery.</b> <b>End</b> tidal CO 2 is not accurate with oscillation ventilation or if moderate to large leak around ETT...|$|E

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A total of 311 HIV-infected pregnant women were enrolled in Malawi in an observational study and received a nevirapine-based regimen from week 25 of gestation until 6 months after <b>delivery</b> (<b>end</b> of breastfeeding period) if their CD 4 + count was > 350 /mm(3) at baseline (n = 147), or indefinitely if they met the criteria for treatment (n. 164). Mother/child pairs were followed until 2 years after delivery. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate HIV transmission, maternal disease progression, and survival at 24 months. The rate of HIV infant infection was 3. 2 % [95 % confidence intervals (CI) 1. 0 - 5. 4]. Six of the 8 transmissions occurred among mothers with baseline CD 4 + count > 350 /mm(3). HIV-free survival of children was 85. 8 % (95 % CI 81. 4 - 90. 1). Children born to mothers with baseline CD 4 + count < 350 /mm(3) were at increased risk of death (hazard ratio 2. 6, 95 % CI 1. 1 - 6. 1). Among women who had stopped treatment the risk of progression to CD 4 + count < 350 /mm(3) was 20. 6 % (95 % CI 9. 2 - 31. 9) by 18 months of drug discontinuation. CONCLUSIONS: HIV transmission in this cohort was rare however, it occurred in a significative proportion among women with high CD 4 + counts. Strategies to improve treatment adherence should be implemented to further reduce HIV transmission. Mortality in the uninfected exposed children was the major determinant of HIV-free survival and was associated to maternal disease stage. Given the considerable proportion of women reaching the criteria for treatment within 18 months of drug discontinuation, life-long ART administration to HIV-infected women should be considered...|$|E
