5|$|Branham {{regarded}} <b>his</b> <b>series</b> of sermons on the Seven Seals in 1963 as {{a highlight}} of his ministry. In reality, Branham's teaching on this subject revealed very little new doctrine and was essentially a laborious restatement of the dispensationalism espoused in the sermons on the seven church ages.|$|E

They retained George's subgenera and many of <b>his</b> <b>series,</b> but discarded his sections. George's B.ser. Tetragonae was found to be monophyletic, and therefore retained; and their analysis of the relationships within the series supported the placement of B.aculeata alongside B.caleyi.|$|E

5|$|George's {{arrangement}} remained current until 1996, when Kevin Thiele and Pauline Ladiges {{published an}} arrangement informed by a cladistic analysis of morphological characteristics. They retained George's subgenera {{and many of}} <b>his</b> <b>series,</b> but discarded his sections. Banksia ser. Abietinae {{was found to be}} very nearly monophyletic, and so retained. It further resolved into four subclades, so Thiele and Ladiges split it into four subseries. Banksia sphaerocarpa appeared in the second of these, initially called the ' grossa clade' for its most basal member. As with George's classification, B.grossa and B.micrantha emerged as close relatives of B.sphaerocarpa.|$|E

5|$|Heilmann's {{articles}} were later collected and published {{as a book}} in Danish in 1916 with the title as in <b>his</b> <b>series,</b> Vor Nuvaerende Viden om Fuglenes Afstamming ("our present knowledge {{about the origin of}} birds"). This met the same lack of interest and is thought to have been a result of publishing in Danish, as this made it inaccessible to many scientists working in the U.S. and much of Europe. The field of paleontology at the time was dominated by American and English scientists, and the discipline in continental Europe was dominated by Germany and to a lesser degree France.|$|E
5|$|Key's most {{valuable}} innings, according to Wisden, {{came in the}} third Test. Despite only scoring six runs in the first innings, Key came to the crease for his second innings with England requiring another 216runs to take a 30 lead in the series. Initially batting with Michael Vaughan, and then with Andrew Flintoff, Key scored an unbeaten 93 to guide England to their target, which was a record fourth innings total to win an Old Trafford Test. <b>His</b> <b>series</b> {{came to an end}} when he scored ten runs, in England's ten-wicket victory in the final Test.|$|E

5|$|There {{are some}} criticisms of van Kinsbergen's photographs. He missed some details and {{sometimes}} <b>his</b> <b>series</b> was unbalanced. Trained as an artist, his works lacked archaeological descriptions, {{the main purpose}} of his contract. The printing quality, however, is beyond question and he had success showing the beauty of classical Javanese arts. His photographs were shown to the public both in the 1873 International Exhibition in Vienna and the 1878 World Exhibition in Paris. His works can be seen in several places, including the National Museum in Amsterdam.|$|E
5|$|Batman: The Ultimate Evil {{is a novel}} {{written by}} Andrew Vachss and {{published}} in 1995 by the Warner Aspect imprint of Warner Books. Vachss was an attorney specializing in child abuse cases, {{as well as a}} crime novelist best known for <b>his</b> <b>series</b> of books featuring the character Burke, a private investigator who also takes on child abuse cases. A representative from DC Comics approached Vachss about the possibility of writing a novel featuring Batman. Viewing {{this as an opportunity to}} reach a completely different audience, Vachss agreed and wrote a draft. He continued with his themes concerning child sexual abuse and explored the topic of child sex tourism. The publisher required Vachss to follow certain rules, like making a clear distinction between fiction and reality and prohibiting the Batman character from killing, cursing, or having sex.|$|E
5|$|Born {{to a lower}} middle-class {{family in}} Etterbeek, Brussels, Hergé began his career by {{contributing}} illustrations to Scouting magazines, developing his first comic series, The Adventures of Totor, for Le Boy-Scout Belge in 1926. Working for the conservative Catholic newspaper Le Vingtième Siècle, he created The Adventures of Tintin in 1929 {{on the advice of}} its editor Norbert Wallez. Revolving around the actions of boy reporter Tintin and his dog Snowy, the series' early instalments – Tintin in the Land of the Soviets, Tintin in the Congo, and Tintin in America – were designed as conservative propaganda for children. Domestically successful, after serialisation the stories were published in book form, with Hergé continuing the series and also developing both the Quick & Flupke and Jo, Zette and Jocko series for Le Vingtième Siècle. Influenced by his friend Zhang Chongren, from 1934 Hergé placed far greater emphasis on conducting background research for his stories, resulting in increased realism from The Blue Lotus onward. Following the German occupation of Belgium in 1940, Le Vingtième Siècle was closed but Hergé continued <b>his</b> <b>series</b> in Le Soir, a popular newspaper controlled by the Nazi administration.|$|E
