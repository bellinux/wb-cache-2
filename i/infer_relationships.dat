The techniques used in MDM are the same as for record linkage generally. MDM expands this matching not only to create a [...] "golden master record" [...] but to <b>infer</b> <b>relationships</b> also.

50|$|Comparing {{different}} embryonic {{stages of}} different animals {{is a tool}} {{that can be used}} to <b>infer</b> <b>relationships</b> between species, and thus biological evolution. This has been a source of quite some controversy, both now and in the past. Ernst Haeckel pioneered in this field. By comparing different embryonic stages of different vertebrate species, he formulated the recapitulation theory. This theory states that an animal's embryonic development follows exactly the same sequence as the sequence of its evolutionary ancestors. Haeckel's work and the ensuing controversy linked the fields of developmental biology and comparative anatomy into comparative embryology. From a more modern perspective, Haeckel's drawings were the beginnings of the field of evolutionary developmental biology (evo-devo).|$|E
50|$|Genetic {{genealogy}} {{is the use}} of DNA {{testing in}} combination with traditional genealogy and traditional genealogical and historical records to <b>infer</b> <b>relationships</b> between individuals. Genetic genealogy involves the use of genealogical DNA testing to determine the level and type of the genetic relationship between individuals. This application of genetics became popular with family historians {{in the first decade of}} the 21st century, as tests became affordable. The tests have been promoted by amateur groups, such as surname study groups, or regional genealogical groups, as well as research projects such as the genographic project. As of 2013 hundreds of thousands of people had been tested. As this field has developed, the aims of practitioners broadened, with many seeking knowledge of their ancestry beyond the recent centuries for which traditional pedigrees can be constructed.|$|E
50|$|Phylogenetic {{classification}} of asexually reproducing fungi now commonly uses molecular systematics. Phylogenetic trees constructed from comparative analyses of DNA sequences, such as rRNA, or multigene phylogenies {{may be used}} to <b>infer</b> <b>relationships</b> between asexually reproducing fungi and their sexually reproducing counterparts. With these methods, many asexually reproducing fungi have now been placed in the tree of life. However, because phylogenetic methods require sufficient quantities of biological materials (spores or fresh specimens) that are from pure (i.e., uncontaminated) fungal cultures, for many asexual species their exact relationship with other fungal species has yet to be determined. Under the current system of fungal nomenclature, teleomorph names cannot be applied to fungi that lack sexual structures. Classifying and naming asexually reproducing fungi is the subject of ongoing debate in the mycological community.|$|E

40|$|Landscape-scale {{processes}} (e. g. habitat loss) {{are major}} drivers {{of the global}} biodiversity crisis, but the complexity and size of landscapes makes study design at this scale difficult. However, the impact of statistical problems associated with sub-optimal study design on inferences drawn from landscape-scale studies is poorly understood. Here, we examine how three common statistical ‘pitfalls’ associated with sub-optimal study design – (1) using landscapes that overlap in space; (2) using {{only a portion of}} the potential range of the landscape predictor variable(s) of interest; (3) failing to account for correlations among landscape predictor variables – affect the <b>inferred</b> <b>relationships</b> between the abundances of six species of anurans and the amount of forest in the landscape using a large (n = 1141) empirical dataset from Wisconsin and Michigan, USA. We show that sub-optimal study design alone can be sufficient to cause a switch in the sign of the <b>inferred</b> <b>relationship</b> between a species response and landscape structure, and that using only a portion of the potential range of a predictor variable, and correlations between predictor variables, are particularly likely to affect inferences. Our results also provide the first evidence of a non-monotonic relationship between forest amount and gray treefrog abundance, and suggest that inconsistencies in the literature about the <b>inferred</b> <b>relationships</b> between anuran presence/abundance and forest amount in the Great Lakes basin are likely largely due to sampling design issues. Increased attention to study design is therefore necessary for the development of robust generalizations in landscape ecolog...|$|R

40|$|AbstractTwo {{expansion}} {{segments of}} the large ribosomal subunit (28 S-D 2 and 28 S-D 3) and the ribosomal first internal transcribed spacer (ITS- 1) were sequenced to investigate the potential of each region for defining species limits and for <b>inferring</b> phylogenetic <b>relationships</b> within the aphelinid genus Encarsia (Hymenoptera, Chalcidoidea). Alignment of the ITS- 1 region was complicated {{by the presence of}} high levels of length polymorphism. Secondary-structure models of the ITS- 1 molecule are proposed which led to an improved alignment and the inclusion of some highly polymorphic sequences. The additional information obtained from the secondary-structure models can provide a justification for the exclusion of hypervariable regions from the phylogenetic analysis. The D 3 region is the most conserved, ITS- 1 the most variable of the three gene regions investigated. Phylogenetic analyses suggest the D 2 region to be most suitable not only for <b>inferring</b> <b>relationships,</b> but also for taxonomic and diagnostic purposes at species level. The ITS- 1 region is best suited for <b>inferring</b> <b>relationships</b> between closely related species or among populations of the same species. The combined analysis using all three regions led to a better tree and a reduced number of equally most parsimonious trees. See also Electronic Supplement at: [URL]...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — The {{commercial}} {{contractual relationship}} among Autonomous Systems (ASs) {{is important for}} understanding the reachability and traffic flow in the Internet. Several heuristic algorithms have been proposed for <b>inferring</b> AS <b>relationships</b> by extracting information from Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) routing tables.
