50|$|Many {{of these}} {{paintings}} were done {{under the direction}} of Giuseppe Castiglione, the Jesuit missionary who served as one of Qianlong's court painters. <b>A</b> number <b>of</b> paintings produced during Qianlong's reign portray the emperor himself participating in the autumn hunt at Mulan, {{as well as in the}} other military rituals of the Qing. In particular, Castiglione produced <b>a</b> series <b>of</b> four scroll paintings about the Mulan hunt. He and his apprentices also produced <b>a</b> number <b>of</b> horse paintings, reviving a subject that had not been popular since the Tang dynasty. A Kazakh horse presented as a gift to the Qianlong Emperor serves as his mount in Castiglione's painting of the grand inspection of the troops, as well as in paintings of the emperor hunting. Copies of martially-themed paintings were disseminated widely in <b>a</b> variety <b>of</b> <b>formats,</b> conveying <b>a</b> <b>message</b> <b>of</b> military might both at home and abroad, as well as impressing a martial stamp upon domestic mass culture.|$|R
40|$|The {{effective}} {{targeting of}} high sensation-seeking adolescents, {{who are most}} at risk for drug abuse, requires the creation of high sensation value messages. Whereas previous {{research has focused on}} subjective reactions of receivers as the primary way to define message sensation value (MSV), we conceptualize message sensation value as the formal and content features (audio, visual, and <b>format)</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>message</b> that contribute to subjective message sensation evaluations. The three objectives of this study were (a) to identify message design features that would aid in the devel-opment of effective prevention messages targeting high sensation seekers, (b) to develop an objective measure of message sensation value based on formal and content features of messages, and (c) to determine whether high message sensation value messages were associated with higher subjective evaluations of message sen-sation value. In the present study, 418 undergraduates each viewed 10 PSAs se-lected at random from a pool of 109 PSAs that had been previously coded for message sensation value. Analyses provide support for the central hypothesis of the study, indicating that perceived message sensation value is at least in part a prod...|$|E
40|$|We {{show that}} superselection rules do not enhance the information-theoretic {{security}} of quantum cryptographic protocols. Our analysis employs two quite different methods. The first method uses {{the concept of}} a reference system [...] in a world subject to a superselection rule, unrestricted operations can be simulated by parties who share access to a reference system with suitable properties. By this method, we prove that if an n-party protocol is secure in a world subject to a superselection rule, then the security is maintained even if the superselection rule is relaxed. However, the proof applies only to a limited class of superselection rules, those in which the superselection sectors are labeled by unitary irreducible representations of a compact symmetry group. The second method uses the concept of the <b>format</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>message</b> sent between parties [...] by verifying the format, the recipient of a message can check whether the message could have been sent by a party who performed charge-conserving operations. By this method, we prove that protocols subject to general superselection rules (including those pertaining to nonabelian anyons in two dimensions) are no more secure than protocols in the unrestricted world. However, the proof applies only to two-party protocols. Our results show in particular that, if no assumptions are made about the computational power of the cheater, then secure quantum bit commitment and strong quantum coin flipping with arbitrarily small bias are impossible in a world subject to superselection rules.
