25|$|The {{house is}} located at the {{northeast}} corner of West Francis and North Second streets in Aspen's residential West End. The surrounding neighborhood is well-developed with other houses, most of more modern construction. At the other <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>block,</b> {{on the south side of}} the street, is the Bowles–Cooley House, also listed on the Register. The terrain is generally level, part of a very gentle drop from the slopes of Aspen Mountain to the south towards the Roaring Fork River to the north.|$|E
25|$|Many other listed properties, most of {{them also}} {{government}} buildings {{that contribute to the}} district, are nearby. Opposite Lafayette Park on Hawk is the monumental Classical Revival New York State Department of Education Building, with Cathedral of All Saints, seat of the Episcopal Diocese of Albany, concealed at the other <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>block.</b> To the southwest, across Washington Avenue (New York State Route 5), is the state capitol, a National Historic Landmark, between East and West Capitol Park. Opposite the park to the east, along Eagle, are the county courthouse, the New York Court of Appeals building, and Albany City Hall. A group of rowhouses, also contributing properties, faces the building from across Elk.|$|E

25|$|Kings Plaza {{is located}} {{along the south}} side of Avenue U, between Flatbush Avenue to the west and East 58th Street to the east. The mall {{occupies}} 23 acres of land. The primary block of the mall lies between Flatbush Avenue and East 55th Street. It contains two levels of mall stores, along with the Macy's and former Sears/Alexander's anchor locations which are both four floors high. Both anchor stores contain around 330,000 square feet of space. At the south <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>block</b> is a multi-level parking garage, accessible from northbound Flatbush Avenue and East 55th Street. The garage was built using specialized prestressed concrete columns, and holds nearly 4,000 cars. The eastern block is solely occupied by a Lowe's location and its adjoining parking lot. The block was entirely used for parking prior to the construction of the Lowe's. At the easternmost end of the site extending to East 58th Street is Mill Basin Plaza, a separate complex owned by Kimco Realty. It features Home Depot, Walgreens, and Petland Discounts stores.|$|E
25|$|At the {{northeast}} corner of the campus, at 164th Street and Goethals Avenue, is the power plant for the hospital. The two-story Art Deco brick building was completed in 1932, built along with the original Queens General Hospital, and was considered a modern facility {{at the time of its}} construction. One of its most notable features is its large chimney. Adjacent to the west between 160th and 161st Streets is the Queens Gateway to Health Sciences Secondary School, a grades 6–12 public school. Adjacent to the west of the school is FDNY EMS Station 50, opened in July 2016, which dispatches FDNY ambulances and contains the Queens EMS Borough Command Center. The EMS station, designed by Dean-Wolf Architects, has a glass and aluminum outer facade, a steel frame, and a concrete foundation with a cantilever shape due to the topography of the area. It is the largest EMS station in the borough. Another EMS station and medical examiner building, and storage and utility buildings were previously located along Goethals Avenue (see below). At the western <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>block</b> on Parsons Boulevard adjacent to Building T is a storage garage, built in 1957.|$|E
500|$|Various {{theories}} {{were put}} {{forward for the}} cause of the rupture. Donald Roll, director of seismology at Loyola University Chicago, proposed that the quake was caused by massive amounts of silt being deposited by rivers, generating a [...] "seesaw" [...] effect on the plates beneath. [...] "The weight of the silt depressed one <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>block</b> and tipped up the other," [...] he said. However, scientists eventually realized the cause was a then-unknown fault, the Cottage Grove Fault, a small tear in the Earth's rock in the Southern Illinois Basin near the city of Harrisburg, Illinois.|$|E

500|$|During the Victorian period, {{the art of}} book {{illustration}} gained popularity, supported {{through the}} work of wood engravers. Woodcut extended back centuries in Europe and further in Asia. Typically the parts to be printed in black were left in relief by the carver, allowing illustrations to be printed along with the text. Thomas Bewick developed the technique in the 18th century and [...] "perfected the process that was used extensively throughout the 19th century, which necessitated the use of hardwood blocks and tools for metal engraving". The preferred method of relief engraving had been {{to work with the}} grain on the plank side of a block; however Bewick worked the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>block</b> and carved against the grain using a burin. Bewick passed his techniques to apprentices, including Landells, who in turn passed them to Evans. In the 1860s, Thomas Bolton developed a method for transferring a photographic image onto block, which enabled the engraver [...] "to work on the surface".|$|E
2500|$|The Jerome {{occupies}} a [...] {{lot on the}} northwest corner of the North Mill Street intersection. The neighborhood is densely developed with many other commercial properties. Some of them, such as the Pitkin County Courthouse two blocks to the east, Aspen City Hall to the southeast, Collins Block and Wheeler Opera House to the south along Mill Street, have been listed on the Register themselves. At the opposite <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>block,</b> across the street, is the Thomas Hynes House, a former miner's cottage now used as a restaurant and also on the Register. To the north the terrain, level between the hotel and the slopes of Aspen Mountain, begins to slope gently toward the Roaring Fork River, which flows through Rio Grande Park two blocks to the north.|$|E
2500|$|The {{house was}} {{constructed}} in 1818–1819 by Richard Cutts, who built the house {{for himself and his}} wife, Anna Payne Cutts (Dolley Payne Madison's sister). The house had two stories, a gabled roof, dormer windows, and chimneys at the north and south ends of the house. The exterior was originally grey stucco. The front of the house faced Lafayette Square. The lot on which the house sat was a large one, with extensive space on all sides. Dirt roads bordered the house on the west and north sides, and a large garden with flowers and fruit trees occupied the east and south sides of the house. The garden extended south as far as the Tayloe House on the south <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>block.</b> The home was considered one of the more [...] "pretentious" [...] domiciles in the city at the time.|$|E

50|$|The district's {{buildings}} {{fall into}} three types, representing different eras of local development: two Italianate rowhouses, 11 carriage houses and two taller structures built for commercial purposes. The rowhouses are the oldest, dating to <b>the</b> early development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Upper East Side during the Civil War. The carriage houses came later, some built on <b>the</b> site <b>of</b> demolished early rowhouses, with the commercial buildings coming near <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>block's</b> development.|$|R

The pistons moved towards each other during the operating cycle. Intake and exhaust ports were duplicated at both <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>block.</b> There were two cam-operated injection pumps per cylinder, each feeding two nozzles, totaling four nozzles per cylinder.|$|R
2500|$|The {{plan was}} to have the nine {{children}} arrive together, but when the meeting place was changed the night before, the Eckford family's lack of a telephone left Elizabeth uninformed of the change. Instructions were given by Daisy Bates, a strong activist for desegregation, for the nine students to wait for her so that they could all walk together to the rear entrance of the school. This last-minute change caused Elizabeth {{to be the first to}} take a different route to school, walking up to the front entrance completely alone. Elizabeth Eckford’s family were not informed of the meeting, and didn’t know that the school board asked the parents to accompany her. Also, Eckford rode a public bus alone to the segregated school. That day, Elizabeth wore a starched black-and-white dress, and she covered her face under black sunglasses. Elizabeth also held her school book in her hand. As she walked toward the school, Elizabeth was surrounded by a crowd of armed guards and a mob of people, and she did not see any black faces. The mob included men, women, and teenagers (white students) who opposed integration. The white teenagers chanted “Two, four, six, eight, we ain’t gonna integrate.” Elizabeth attempted to go into the school through the mob, but was denied entrance. Eckford ran to a bus bench at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>block.</b> Eckford described her experience: ...|$|E
2500|$|City {{officials}} {{approved the}} final master plan on November 20, 2006. [...] The project included 686 housing units (down from 772 in June 2006), [...] of retail space (up from [...] in June 2006), [...] {{of office space}} (up from [...] in June 2006), 1,700 underground parking spaces (down from 1,900 in June 2006), and [...] of land for a public library. Twenty percent of the condominiums would be priced for low-income people. The public park had not disappeared (as previously reported), but just [...] were set aside for what was now called [...] "Central Plaza". Tenth Street NW was reopened, a narrowed I Street NW was reopened between 9th and 10th Streets NW, and 30 percent of the retail space was set aside for non-chain stores. Two condominium buildings occupied the corner of 9th and H Streets NW, while two larger apartment buildings occupied the corner of 10th and H Streets NW. A north-south running open-air plaza occupied the space between them. Two office buildings occupied the south <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>block</b> between 10th and 11th Streets NW, while an open-air public park with fountain was on the north end. A [...] wide, covered [...] "pedestrian street" [...] ran east-west between the buildings on both blocks. Foster and Partners oversaw {{the design of the}} development, while the local firm of Shalom Baranes Associates was the lead architect. The Washington Business Journal and Washington Times reported the project's total cost as $650 million, but the Washington Post pegged it at $630 million. City officials estimated that the development would create more than 7,500 temporary construction jobs and 5,200 permanent jobs, and bring in $30 million annually in income, sales, and property tax revenues. Construction was set to begin in late 2008 and conclude by mid-2011. The city had yet {{to decide what to do}} with its remaining [...] parcel, which occupied the west end of the triangular block bordering New York Avenue NW between 9th and 10th Streets NW, but city officials were still pushing for a public library on the spot.|$|E
