60|$|I observed, as {{my uncle}} spoke, that {{his voice was}} unnaturally moved and his manner unwontedly demonstrative. He leaned forward at these last words, for example, and touched me on the knee with his spread fingers, looking up into my face with a certain pallor, and I could see that his eyes shone with a <b>deep-seated</b> <b>fire,</b> and that the lines about his mouth were drawn and tremulous.|$|E
30|$|In {{the months}} {{preceding}} the 2005 disaster, fires {{have been reported}} at the Leuwigajah dump site. Eyewitnesses reported that the waste mass was on fire while moving. Fires may have spread quickly because the landfill contained highly flammable combustible material. All {{the bodies of the}} victims were burnt, and the studied material was rather deeply charred. Where fires burn quantities of flammable organic materials, such as plastics, temperatures may be very high in the burning zone. This can then ignite methane {{in the presence of the}} oxygen (Woodward [1997]). <b>Deep-seated</b> <b>fires</b> are found at depth in material deposited weeks, months, or years earlier. The common cause of <b>deep-seated</b> <b>fires</b> is an increase in the oxygen level within the landfill, which increases aerobic bacterial activity causing a temperature rise. <b>Deep-seated</b> <b>fires</b> have the potential to: (i) create large voids, invisible from the surface, which can cause cracking and subsidence of the landfill surface; and (ii) produce flammable and toxic gasses, e.g. carbon monoxide, a toxic gas extremely flammable. It is flammable when mixed with air at concentrations between 12 % and 75 % (Woodward [1997]).|$|R
30|$|The explosions {{may have}} {{resulted}} from three factors related to the <b>deep-seated</b> <b>fires</b> described above (see 4.2. 1).: (i) build-up of landfill gas in enclosed spaces, (ii) ignition of flammable (e.g. plastic bags) or explosive material deposited in the landfill, and (iii) bursting of sealed drums, cans, aerosol containers or gas bottles deposited in the landfill.|$|R
5|$|A church {{close to}} the {{refinery}} {{was used as a}} point for families seeking information on relatives employed at the facility. So many people turned up that police requested that each family send only one representative. At the close of the day of the explosion, six people were missing, with no confirmed deaths. Overnight, several <b>deep-seated</b> <b>fires</b> were uncovered and firefighting continued the next day.|$|R
40|$|High {{concentration}} of heavy metals in organic soils {{may be the}} result of intensive, <b>deep-seated</b> <b>fires</b> causing high temperatures. This research has been carried in four post-fire areas, located in forests or on meadows in Lower Silesia. The aim has been to deter-mine the impact of some parameters on the content of heavy metals in soils under post-fire meadows and forests. The concentration and pool of the analyzed heavy metals were determined in soils against the background of such parameters as the depth in a horizon, organic matter content, soil colour and soil reaction. Twenty Histosol soil profiles (85 soil samples) were analyzed, representing peat-muck, muck (MtIIc 1, MtIIIc 1) and mineral-muc-ky (Me 11) and on-muck soils (according to the Polish taxonomy of soils). The soils were strongly desiccated. Some physicochemical and chemical properties of pyrogenic soils were analyzed in dry samples collected into plastic bags with an Instorfu auger. Heavy metals (Zn, Cu, Pb, Ni, Cr) were determined in HCl + HNO 3. Pools of heavy metals were recalcu-lated into g m– 2 in 0 - 20 cm layers of soils and compared among forest and meadow soils. Due to intensive fires, the reaction of pyrogenic soils was slightly acid, neutral or alkaline...|$|R
40|$|The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) and Northwest Barricade LLC (NWB) {{conducted}} a study {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of a novel fire blocking gel for use in underground coal mines to extinguish or to retard the growth of a coal fire. The gel agent was subjected to controlled laboratory testing to assess its ability to delay coal ignition. It was then evaluated to determine if manual fire hose application could be used to apply the agent to mine roofs and ribs to provide a safe egress for mine rescue teams from a fire area. The gel agent was also evaluated in a water sprinkler system to determine its potential for use in conveyor belt fire suppression systems. The agent was then tested in live-fire exercises to examine its effectiveness in retarding and extinguishing a <b>deep-seated</b> coal <b>fire</b> and wood fire. Lastly, the ability of a Mine Rescue Team to quickly and safely apply the gel agent to a mine entry during a simulated mine fire exercise was determined...|$|R
40|$|If origins are {{as complex}} and perturbing as Derrida suggests, then we might ask {{of the current}} anthropic {{environmental}} predicament: what kind of planet is it that gives birth to a creature capable of doing such things? Biological life may be at its liveliest along the earth's sutures and fault-lines. But so too is fire. If humans are a fire species, then this is a fire planet. From {{the point of view}} of a ‘speculative geophysics’, our combustive habits may say at least as much about the <b>deep-seated</b> role of <b>fire</b> in welding together a fractious and differentiated planet as they do about any aberration on our own part...|$|R
50|$|Born to Orlis and Hirmina Verginix, Quint was the {{youngest}} of six sons. His father Orlis was a successful sky-pirate captain better known as Wind Jackal who captained the sky-ship Galerider and he and his family lived in an opulent mansion in the Western Quays of the Edge's largest city, Undertown. When Quint was four years old Wind Jackal's quartermaster Turbot Smeal set a fire near their home in an ill-fated attempt to avenge Wind Jackal's refusal to go along with a scheme of his that involved slavery. The fire spread through much of the Western Quays, killing Quint's mother, five brothers and nanny as well as Smeal himself and many others. The smallest member of the family, Quint was able to escape through a skylight and climb across the rooftops, where he was rescued by Wind Jackal returning to Undertown to find his home ablaze. The event left both of them emotionally scarred and Quint with a <b>deep-seated</b> fear of <b>fire,</b> but brought them close together as the only surviving members of their family. Quint then spent the rest of his childhood on a sky-pirate ship, learning the trade from his father.|$|R
