5|$|Mr. Bean {{often seems}} unaware of basic {{aspects of the}} way the world works, and the {{programme}} usually features his attempts at what would normally be considered simple activities, such as going swimming, using a television set, interior decorating, or <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>church.</b> The humour largely comes from his original (and often absurd) solutions to problems and his total disregard for others when solving them, his pettiness, and occasional malevolence.|$|E

He takes an early interest in Saori and tries to become her boyfriend. After meeting Shuichi, Fumiya becomes jealous of Saori's interest in Shuichi, and finds Shuichi's cross-dressing gross. While initially lying to Saori and Shuichi about having an interest in cross-dressing, he is later seen dressed as a girl while out with Shuichi, and again at the cultural festival at Shuichi's school. Fumiya enjoys the added attention that comes from cross-dressing and admits that he likes being called cute.|$|E

50|$|Hyperconsumerism {{has been}} also {{said to have}} {{religious}} characteristics, and have been compared to a new religion which enshrines consumerism above all, with elements of religious life being replaced by consumerist life: (<b>going</b> <b>to)</b> <b>churches</b> replaced by (<b>going</b> <b>to)</b> shopping malls, saints replaced by celebrities, penance replaced by shopping sprees, desire for better life after death replaced by desire for better life in the present, and so on. Mark Sayers notes that hyperconsumerism has commercialized many religious symbols, giving an example of religious symbols worn as jewelry by non-believers.|$|R

25|$|In 1846 he {{completed}} his third geological book, and turned from supervising {{the publication of}} expert reports on {{the findings from the}} voyage to examining barnacle specimens himself. This grew into an eight-year study, making use of his theory to find hitherto unknown relationships between the many species of barnacle, and establishing his expertise as a biologist. His faith in Christianity dwindled and he stopped <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>church.</b> In 1851 his treasured daughter suffered a long illness and died. In 1854 he resumed his work on the species question which led on to the publication of Darwin's theory.|$|E

500|$|For {{much of his}} childhood, Smith's {{family was}} a part of the Community of Christ but began {{attending}} services at a local Methodist Church.

In 2001, he said: [...] "I don't necessarily buy into any officially structured version of spirituality. But I have my own version of it." ...|$|E
500|$|Verdi was {{similarly}} never explicit about his religious beliefs. Anti-clerical by nature {{in his early}} years, he nonetheless built a chapel at Sant'Agata, but is rarely recorded as <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>church.</b> Strepponi wrote in 1871 [...] "I won't say [...] is an atheist, {{but he is not}} much of a believer." [...] Rosselli comments that in the Requiem [...] "The prospect of Hell appears to rule... is troubled to the end," [...] and offers little consolation.|$|E

Moberg (2006) suspects that Christian metal music may suggest dissatisfaction with traditional forms of worship among today's young Christians: [...] "They may not feel comfortable with just <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>church</b> and singing hymns, they need an alternative means to express the same faith." [...] Apart from evangelism, Christian metal may also provide a means [...] "to get away from the image of Christianity as something rigid and boring".|$|E

He and Rachel become acquainted, but she has to leave for the next stop on the band's tour, promising to come back and meet up with him afterward.|$|E
500|$|The Simpsons writer Mike Reiss {{feels that}} episodes such as [...] "Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment" [...] are his {{favorite}} episodes to write {{because they have}} a [...] "solid theme or an issue" [...] (in this case, religion and theft), that one can [...] "discuss endlessly and just have it present itself in so many different ways." [...] Producer Jeff Martin said that the writers tried to use a [...] "very strict construction of the Eighth Commandment," [...] considering cable theft to be [...] "essentially a victimless crime." [...] "Homer vs. the 8th Commandment" [...] was produced at a time when illegal cable hookups were becoming commonplace in many homes. This episode later inspired the season four episode [...] "Homer the Heretic", in which Homer stops <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>church</b> on Sundays. Based on the Fourth Commandment, [...] "remember the Sabbath and keep it holy", that episode originated when Jean commented to Reiss, [...] "We had a lot of luck with Homer stealing cable, so maybe we could look to other commandments?" ...|$|E

500|$|At this time, {{the priests}} who {{were part of}} St. Peter were doing the best they could to keep the faith alive in their congregation. The priests were smart men who had {{attended}} school in Italy prior to their immigration, but most were unable to speak fluent English. At a time when immigrants were desperately trying to fit into the American life and be as American as possible, <b>going</b> <b>to</b> a <b>church</b> where the congregation was Italian was not the most desirable choice. [...] Therefore, many Catholic Italians began <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>churches</b> and many others changed their religion altogether. Many of these Italians were becoming Protestant. [...] The priests were poorly paid and most lived on about twenty-five cents per day. They had no permanent housing: many slept in the church itself, and preferred the altar floor {{because it was the only}} place in the church that had carpeting. It was also common for the priests to say Mass several churches on the same day. These circuits trips were sometimes as much as twenty-five miles away.|$|R

500|$|His {{plans to}} become a soldier died after a legal battle {{concerning}} his estate, in which he consulted John Glanville. Glanville successfully persuaded Hale {{to become a}} lawyer, and, after leaving Oxford {{at the age of}} 20 before obtaining a degree, he joined Lincoln's Inn on 8 November 1628. Fearing that the theatre might dissuade him from his legal studies as it had at Oxford, he swore [...] "never to see a stage-play again". At around this time he was drinking with a group of friends when one of them became so drunk he fainted; Hale prayed to God to forgive and save his friend, and forgive him for his previous excesses. His friend recovered, and Hale was restored to his Puritan faith, never drinking to someone's health again (not even drinking to the King) and <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>church</b> every Sunday for 36 years. He instead settled into his studies, working for up to 16 hours a day during his first two years at Lincoln's Inn before reducing it to eight hours due to health concerns. As well as reading the law reports and statutes, Hale also studied the Roman civil law and jurisprudence. Outside of the law, Hale studied anatomy, history, philosophy and mathematics. He refused to read the news or attend social events, and occupied himself entirely with his studies and visits to church.|$|E

2500|$|Manson is {{an atheist}} but {{has long been}} {{interested}} in spirituality. She recalled, [...] "When I was very small, I was very besotted with the church, absolutely I loved the theatre of it and I got very involved in all the stories we were taught." [...] When she was about 12, she had an argument with her father at the dinner table, screaming at him that [...] "religion's a sham and I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>church</b> anymore, it's just bullshit". She stopped <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>church</b> but continued to have theological debates with him every Sunday. Manson became disenchanted with organized religion and although she maintained an interest in spirituality, she complained that she [...] "brushed up against too many examples of hypocritical spiritualists".|$|E

2500|$|Though {{she does}} not follow any set religion, she {{periodically}} practices Buddhism. She once admitted, [...] "It's been a discipline that makes sense more than anything because it's like a science. I've never been a religious person.

[...] She is also a vegetarian.|$|E
