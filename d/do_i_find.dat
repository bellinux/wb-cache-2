After leaving the army, Vainio befriended composer and music journalist Sauvo Puhtila (known to the Finnish public by the pseudonym Saukki), who told him that Yleisradio {{was in need of}} lyricists. Eager to leave his job as a teacher, Vainio quit and started collaborating with musician Reino Markkula. Their song Sä kuulut päivään jokaiseen ("You Belong in Every Day"), composed by Markkula with lyrics by Vainio, was given to Eino Grön who made it into a hit.|$|E

This had gradually brought a more enlightened atmosphere to Prague, and by 1861 Smetana was seeing prospects of a better future for Czech nationalism and culture. Before deciding his own future, in September Smetana set out on a concert tour of the Netherlands and Germany. He was still hoping to secure a reputation as a pianist, but once again he experienced failure. Back in Prague, he conducted performances of Richard III and Wallenstein's Camp in the Žofín Island concert hall in January 1862, to a muted reception. Critics accused him of adhering too closely to the [...] "New German" [...] school represented primarily by Liszt; Smetana responded that [...] "a prophet is without honour in his own land." [...] In March 1862 he made a last brief visit to Gothenburg, but the city no longer held his interest; it appeared to him a provincial backwater and, whatever the difficulties, he now determined to seek his musical future in Prague: [...] "My home has rooted itself into my heart so much that only there <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>find</b> real contentment. It is to this that I will sacrifice myself." ...|$|E

What is it, this one thing, and how <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>find</b> {{my way to}} it? Traces of this perfect thing appear in many guises – and {{everything}} that is unimportant falls away. Tintinnabulation is like this. Here I am alone with silence. I have discovered that it is enough when a single note is beautifully played. This one note, or a silent beat, or a moment of silence, comforts me." ...|$|E

6000|$|She {{began to}} tremble. She tore the veil off her face. She cried out piteously, [...] "Lord, be merciful to me a sinner! Come here," [...] {{she said to}} Emily. [...] "Where are you? No!

60|$|There {{is little}} variety {{in the soil}} {{throughout}} Sikkim, and, as far as vegetation is concerned, it may be divided into vegetable mould and stiff clay--each, as they usually occur, remarkably characteristic in composition of such soils.

60|$|Yes. I'm exhausted. But I {{want to tell}} you, Arthur, I think you're right. The {{worst is}} over.

60|$|Having thus proven, {{at least}} to my own satisfaction, {{that so much of}} Noel's story was true, I set about verifying the other portions, and in no single {{instance}} <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>find</b> that he had drawn upon his imagination, therefore I resolved to write it down as the lad himself would have spoken, being able, because of the letters, to put myself very nearly in his place.|$|R

500|$|Madgwick {{was usually}} {{on good terms}} with Hulme, {{although}} like with Darling they sometimes disagreed {{on the content of}} ABC's current affairs shows, especially This Day Tonight (TDT). Hulme frequently passed-on complaints of bias in TDT's coverage from Holt's government in Canberra, each of which Madgwick dutifully investigated. Said Madgwick, [...] "On no occasion <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>find</b> that the programme had been consciously biased one way or another." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "'I {{came away}} heartsick and discouraged,' writes Lerner. The crime {{of these people}} was cowardice and moral callousness rather than active criminality....

Even the baby apparently lacked a sense of responsibility for Hitler, which shows how deeply ingrained this moral callousness is in the German national character.|$|R
