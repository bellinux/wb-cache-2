50|$|In optics, {{refraction}} is {{a phenomenon}} that often occurs when waves travel from a medium with a given refractive index to a medium with another at an oblique angle. At {{the boundary between the}} media, the wave's phase velocity is altered, usually causing a change in direction. Its wavelength increases or decreases, but its frequency remains constant. For example, a light ray will refract as it enters and leaves glass, assuming there is a change in refractive index. A ray traveling along the normal (perpendicular to the boundary) will change speed, but not direction. Refraction still occurs in this case. Understanding of this concept led to the invention of lenses and the refracting telescope. Refraction can be seen when looking into a bowl of water. Air has a refractive index of about 1.0003, and water has a refractive index of about 1.3330. If a person looks at a straight object, such as a pencil or straw, which is placed at a slant, partially in the water, the object appears to bend at the water's surface. This is due to the bending of light rays as they move from the water to the air. Once the rays reach the eye, the <b>eye</b> <b>traces</b> them back as straight lines (lines of sight). The lines of sight (shown as dashed lines) intersect at a higher position than where the actual rays originated. This causes the pencil to appear higher and the water to appear shallower than it really is. The depth that the water appears to be when viewed from above is known as the apparent depth. This is an important consideration for spearfishing from the surface because it will make the target fish appear to be in a different place, and the fisher must aim lower to catch the fish. Conversely, an object above the water has a higher apparent height when viewed from below the water. The opposite correction must be made by an archer fish. For small angles of incidence (measured from the normal, when sin θ is approximately the same as tan θ), the ratio of apparent to real depth is the ratio of the refractive indexes of air to that of water. But, as the angle of incidence approaches 90o, the apparent depth approaches zero, albeit reflection increases, which limits observation at high angles of incidence. Conversely, the apparent height approaches infinity as the angle of incidence (from below) increases, but even earlier, as the angle of total internal reflection is approached, albeit the image also fades from view as this limit is approached.|$|E

40|$|This study investigates test-takers’ {{processing}} while completing banked gap-fill tasks, {{designed to}} test reading proficiency, {{in order to}} test theoretically based expectations about the variation in cognitive processes of test-takers across levels of performance. Twenty-eight test-takers’ <b>eye</b> <b>traces</b> on 24 banked gap-fill items (on six tasks) were analysed according to seven on-line eye-tracking measures representing overall, text and task processing. Variation in processing was related to test-takers’ level of performance on the tasks overall. In particular, as hypothesised, lower-scoring students exerted more cognitive effort on local reading and lower-level cognitive processing in contrast to test-takers who attained higher scores. The findings of different cognitive processes associated with variation in scores illuminate the construct measured by banked gap-fill items, and therefore have implications for test design and the validity of score interpretations...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a software framework and analysis tool {{to support the}} collection and analysis of eye movement and perceptual feedback data {{for a variety of}} diagnostic imaging modalities. The framework allows the rapid creation of experiment software that can display a collection of medical images of a particular modality, capture eye trace data, and record marks added to an image by the observer, together with their final decision. There are also a number of visualisation techniques for the display of eye trace information. The analysis tool supports the comparison of individual <b>eye</b> <b>traces</b> for a particular observer or traces from multiple observers for a particular image. Saccade and fixation data can be visualised, with user control of fixation identification functions and properties. Observer markings are displayed, and predefined regions of interest are supported. The software also supports some interactive and multi-image modalities. The analysis tool includes a novel visualisation of scan paths across multi-image modalities. Using an exploded 3 D view of a stack of MRI scan sections, an observer's scan path can be shown traversing between images, in addition to inspecting them...|$|E
40|$|Measuring eye {{movements}} (EMs) {{using the}} search-coil eye-tracking technique {{is superior to}} video-based infrared methods [Collewijn H, van der Mark F, Jansen TC. Precise recording of human eye movements. Vision Res 1975; 15 (3) : 447 - 50], which suffer from the instability of pupil size, blinking behavior and lower temporal resolution. However, no conventional {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) -compatible search-coil eye tracker exists. The main problems for such a technique are the interaction between the transmitter coils and the magnetic gradients used for imaging as well as the limited amount of space in a scanner. Here we present an approach to overcome these problems and we demonstrate a method to record EMs in an MRI scanner using a search coil. The system described has a spatial resolution of 0. 07 ° (visual angle) and a high temporal resolution (22 kHz). The transmitter coils are integrated into the visual presentation system and the control/analysis unit is portable, which enables us to integrate the eye tracker with an MRI scanner. Our tests demonstrate low noise in the recorded <b>eye</b> <b>traces</b> and scanning with minimal artifact. Furthermore, the induced current in the search coil caused by the RF pulses does not lead to measurable heating. Altogether, this MR-compatible search-coil eye tracker can be used to precisely monitor EMs with high spatial and temporal resolution during fMRI. It can therefore be of great importance for studies requiring accurate fixation of a target, or measurement and study of the subject‘s oculomotor system...|$|E
40|$|In this two-voiced paper, we {{conduct an}} {{experiment}} in ‘reciprocal scansion’: {{a process in which}} prosodic investigation and labelling becomes a site, not for fixing the terms of a poem's formal effects, but for communication and dialogue. The paper will overturn the assumed association between scansion and ‘naturalness’ (the iambic pentameter as human heartbeat, for example), one that often manifests as peremptory analysis based on cultural prescription (as implied in an Eton Latin master's rhetorical questions in 1840 : ‘if you do not write good longs and shorts, how can you ever be a man of taste? If you are not a man of taste, how can you ever be of use in the world?’). By renouncing openness and dialogue for rote methods of formal measurement, predetermined ways of scanning poetry serve to distance readers from, rather than draw them to, a poem's formal effects. In order to undo this knot of formalism, we seek to locate dialogue, rather than singularity of effect, at the heart of our investigation. An examination of prosodic variations within larger frames of regularity allows us to access the different effects that prosodic choices enact upon readers. In particular, this paper illustrates how Wordsworth's frequent emphasis on movements between the ear and the <b>eye</b> <b>traces</b> thematically vital transitions between sight and sound, and in doing so, allegorizes the process of scansion used in prosody. By bringing this treatment to bear on ‘There Was a Boy’, we critique the ‘naturalness’ of prosody and bring out the ways in which Wordsworth's ‘intertexture of ordinary feeling’ involves the coalition of emotion and regulation through metre. This coalition also hints at meetings and encounters that, by virtue of prosody, can be reciprocally rewarding...|$|E

40|$|Literacy {{has been}} an {{important}} factor in building societies based on welfare, democracy and human rights throughout the world. Knowledge is increasingly important in our modern society – a society much more complex and varied than ever before. Society needs well-educated citizens meaning learning becomes a lifelong activity. The challenges for all public and school libraries are immense, and library services aimed at children and young people especially become an essential task. “ What happens when we are reading? The <b>eye</b> <b>traces</b> black letters on white paper from left to right, again and again. And characters, nature or thoughts somebody else has thought, recently or a thousand years ago appear in our imagination. That is a miracle greater than making a seed from a Pharaoh's tomb blossom in our time. Nevertheless, this happens every single moment. ” (Olof Lagerkrantz: About the Art of Reading and Writing). Being able to read is a necessity in our enlightened society, and children's libraries play a vital role. Books provide knowledge, experience and emotional involvement- issues that are important to stress in an age where Internet and new ways of communication are perhaps the preferred channels for the younger generations. Still, reading is the answer when it comes to obtaining good reading skills, all in one package with its creation of inner adventures, stories, fairytales and other mind blowing experiences and thrills of the imagination. The latter being important issues for people involved in the promotion of good children's libraries. Kids of all ages need to be offered high quality library services both in their spare time and while in school. Good relations between public and school libraries are therefore a must.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} 25 ESL test-takers’ cognitive processing while completing {{a set of}} Opinion Matching tasks designed and piloted for use on the Aptis reading test and targeting the CEFR-B 1 level. Insights were gained through the recording of participants’ <b>eye</b> <b>traces</b> during task completion, immediately followed by a stimulated recall after each task in which participants described, in their first language, how they had completed it. The study follows up {{on the findings of}} Brunfaut & McCray (2015), who investigated test-takers’ task processing on the full Aptis reading test, and found support for the construct validity of the test. However, a somewhat weaker alignment between the intended and actual reading processes used by test-takers was found for the B 1 banked gap-fill tasks of the Aptis reading test. The aim of this follow-up study, therefore, was to explore the cognitive processing on an alternative, newly designed set of Opinion Matching tasks to be able to evaluate {{the extent to which the}} new tasks elicited the specified processes for this level of the Aptis reading test (see O’Sullivan & Dunlea, 2015). Test-takers were found to use a wide range of cognitive processes while they were completing the B 1 Opinion Matching tasks, covering both lower- and higher-level processes as defined in Khalifa & Weir’s (2009) model of reading. Most often, when they successfully solved the item, the test-takers had adopted a careful and global reading approach (and sometimes they also did some expeditious reading), and they had combined lexical processing and/or meaning-making within sentences, across sentences or at textual and intertextual levels with inferencing. This global comprehension approach and the extensive engagement with higher-level processing associated with the B 1 Opinion Matching items not only differs substantially from the local and lower-level processing patterns associated with the original B 1 banked gap-fill items, but also suggests a suitable match with the intended processes specified by the test developers for the Aptis B 1 reading tasks...|$|E
40|$|Composition, in {{time and}} space is {{discussed}} as a general problem in graphics, music, film/video, landscape architecture and architecture. This discussion serves to introduce the primary sources which motivate the design of the labyrinth. These sources contribute to an interest in the definition of paths, pattern, and networks. This interest leads to the comparison between sequential composition and random access composition. The exploration of nonlinear composition is a primary motivation in the design and the construction of the labyrinth. The opposition between the romantic and classical (Rubenistes and Poussinistes) representation of space and treatment of light in Western painting is examined. The rational articulation of space is contrasted to the indefinite, 'irrational' depiction: the comprehensible with the incomprehensible. A brief survey of the present day and historical forms of labyrinths is followed by a discussion of the more salient artistic contributions, and then with a discussion of the labyrinth as a popular icon in media and in video games. The way in which the <b>eye</b> <b>traces</b> a composition in painting is compared to the path a stroller might take across a real landscape. The problem is the same for the graphic artist, the architect and the composer: how to break up space and time in order to maximize the interest in and the comprehension of the layout, environment or composition. The nature of this perception is explored in examples taken from graphic design, architecture, painting, urban landscaping, the networks of the Sewers of Paris, the catacombs, the configuration of paths and walkways, modular design and the role of change and variation in generating intrinsic interest in each. The Chinese Garden, recent playground design as "learning environments", the M. I. T. Architectural design studios and other examples are mentioned to show the convergence of a variety of intentions. Change ringing and serial music show too the interest in the use of combinatorial techniques to generate unity and variety. This interest in variation is shown to be an essential part of learning and play. In literature the metaphor of the labyrinth again contrasts the opposition between the rational and the irrational. Forms in nature, mathematical proportion and series, Artificial Intelligence, maze solving and generating algorithms are suggested as sources for design. The Thesis Labyrinth is discussed in detail as well as the formulations that led to it. Future speculations concerning the labyrinth as a sonic installation occupy the final section and the thesis concludes with Greg Bright's Caveat. by Gregory Patrick Garvey. Thesis (M. S. V. S.)

A fiery eruption in 1688 caused {{a majority of the}} inhabitants to leave for nearby Brava, another of the Cape Verdean islands. From 1785 on, whaling ships from Brockton and New Bedford, Massachusetts (United States) came to replenish their ships and recruit crews. The departure of these Americanos marks the beginning of the Cape Verdean diaspora. Not everyone left Fogo, however. In 1870, the eccentric Count of Montrond (France) stopped on the island en route to Brazil, or so he thought. He stayed, and brought with him the vines that kicked off wine production in the caldera.

40|$|How can we improve learner drivers’ visual skills? Much {{research}} has demonstrated that learner drivers have an impoverished spread of search during driving and that this is partly due to lack of knowledge of where and when to look, rather than simply an issue of cognitive load. Several training interventions have tried to improve scanning in these drivers with limited success. We propose that exposing drivers to examples of good and bad scanning behaviour may prove to be a useful tool in training visual search. The success of this approach, however, requires drivers to be able to distinguish between examples of good and bad scanning. To this end, two studies were undertaken where video clips of simulated driving with an overlaid <b>eye</b> movement <b>trace</b> were presented to participants who had to judge whether the eye movements were that of a learner driver or a driving instructor. Overall, participants found this discrimination task very difficult. However, the findings suggested that novice and learner drivers were able to correctly classify those <b>eye</b> movement <b>traces</b> of other learner drivers better than chance. It was also demonstrated that the ability to distinguish between the eye movements of learner drivers and driving instructors improved as the number of objective {{differences between the two groups}} increased across specific scenarios (as determined by frame-by-frame analysis using a priori categories). The results suggest that, under certain situations, drivers can extract information about the appropriateness of a particular scanning strategy just by watching a video of the <b>eye</b> movement <b>trace.</b> The implications for training interventions are discussed...|$|R
