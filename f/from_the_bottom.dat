5|$|Thermal {{pollution}} is the artificial reduction in water temperatures, especially {{in summer and}} autumn, caused when frigid water is released <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> of reservoirs for irrigation demands.

5|$|In a {{blast furnace}} fuel (coke), ores, and flux (limestone) are {{continuously}} supplied {{through the top}} of the furnace, while a hot blast of air (sometimes with oxygen enrichment) is blown into the lower section of the furnace through a series of pipes called tuyeres, so that the chemical reactions take place throughout the furnace as the material falls downward. The end products are usually molten metal and slag phases tapped <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom,</b> and flue gases exiting from {{the top of the}} furnace. The downward flow of the ore and flux in contact with an upflow of hot, carbon monoxide-rich combustion gases is a countercurrent exchange and chemical reaction process.|$|E

The fan diameter was reduced, which reduced the bypass ratio, and the engine accessory gearbox was moved <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> of the engine (the 6o'clock position) to the 9o'clock position, giving the engine nacelle its distinctive flat-bottomed shape.
