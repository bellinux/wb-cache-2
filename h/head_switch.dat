50|$|The data {{transfer}} rate of a drive (also called throughput) covers both the internal rate (moving data between the disk surface and the controller on the drive) and the external rate (moving data between the controller on the drive and the host system). The measurable {{data transfer}} rate will be the lower (slower) of the two rates. The sustained {{data transfer rate}} or sustained throughput of a drive will be the lower of the sustained internal and sustained external rates. The sustained rate is {{less than or equal}} to the maximum or burst rate because it does not have the benefit of any cache or buffer memory in the drive. The internal rate is further determined by the media rate, sector overhead time, <b>head</b> <b>switch</b> time, and cylinder switch time. These are not applicable to SSDs.|$|E

Capacity problems are just in one part of the railway station, on the southern station <b>head</b> (<b>switch</b> system), where is a regional transport. The question of how to cope with the substance of railway station has been being discussed for several decades. The idea of moving railway station to the new location, 550 metres southern, emerged already in the 1920s. It was after a sudden increase of transport capacity between 1923 and 1924 (26% more). Such an increase has never happened again. Experts who worked for Brno before World War II abandoned this idea. Later on this idea reappeared several times in the new contexts. In 1970 railway station was relieved from freight transport which was transferred to the modernized track on the South. Since then the railway station has been intended purely for passenger transportation.|$|E

30|$|Storage Simulator This module {{takes the}} I/O {{requests}} from the dispatch queue of the OS Block Simulator {{and based on}} the device type (HDD or SSD), return performance metrics like completion time depending on {{the current state of the}} block device. The module takes block device configuration parameters as inputs (device driver) such as drive capacity, block device type (HDD or SSD), etc. For HDDs, drive parameters include geometry, no. of disk heads, no. of tracks (cylinders), sectors/track, rotations per minute (RPM), command processing time, settle time, average seek time, rotational latency, cylinder switch time, track-to-adjacent switch time, and <b>head</b> <b>switch</b> time. For SCMs (SSDs), the drive parameters include the no. of pages per block, size of each page, seek time (read, writes, erase) etc. The Storage Simulator is CHS compliant for 48 -bit LBA. The Storage simulator calculates the I/O access time (per I/O request) by HDDs considering the current location of the disk arm and time needed to reach the desired new location and access data size. The access time also takes into account minute details such as command processing time, settle time, rotational latency, cylinder (track) switch time, <b>head</b> <b>switch</b> time and average seek time [17, 40, 41]. For SSDs, the access time depends on the SSD properties provided by the manufacturer. The configurable features gives us the ability to test the schemes with different devices as well as drive architectures.|$|E

This paper aims to examine whether {{it has the potential}} to be used as an input for assistive technology (AT) devices. Two experiments were conducted. In the first, 12 non-impaired subjects used the neuroheadset to control a computer with their facial expressions. They also used a simple system of two <b>head</b> <b>switches</b> for comparison. In the second experiment, three non-impaired subjects were trained to use the neuroheadset to control a computer with their thoughts. In the first experiment, the neuroheadset was slower and less accurate than the <b>head</b> <b>switches</b> (p< 0. 05), and was also harder to use. It is unlikely to be preferred to existing methods of accessing AT for those that retain a small amount of head movement. In the second experiment, by the end of the week, all three subjects achieved accuracy rates greater than chance. All subjects were non-impaired, and the sample size in the second experiment was small. Further research should concentrate on the second experiment, using larger sample sizes and impaired subjects. The EPOC neuroheadset is substantially cheaper than similar specialist devices, and has the potential to allow those with no voluntary muscle control to access AT with their thoughts. The results of these two experiments show that the Emotiv EPOC neuroheadset can be used as an interface for non-impaired users to transfer information to a computer, which could in turn be used to control AT...|$|R
40|$|Abstract In {{hard disk}} drives (HDDs), head skew error among {{multiple}} heads is calibrated during manufacturing process, {{and will be}} implemented prior to <b>head</b> <b>switching</b> seeks. In operational environment, additional head skew deviation due to temperature drift may be observed, which could introduce heavy handling burden for feedback controller along with unacceptable noise to HDD customers. Therefore, a thorough analysis of head skew variation against temperature is carried out in this paper. With help of accurate estimation of head skew based on drive temperature, smart feedforward control strategy during drive startup is embedded. Experimental results demonstrating its effectiveness to enhance drive performance are given. Index terms: Head skew deviation, hard disk drives, calibration, and temperature coefficient...|$|R
40|$|We {{present an}} MT-approach which does {{transfer}} {{at the level}} of flat underspecified discourse representation structures. It allows for natural definitions of notoriously difficult structural divergencies between source and target, like <b>head</b> <b>switching,</b> by exploiting the formal means of semantic scope. The corresponding expressive lexicon formalism allows for a lexically driven, co-descriptive transfer architecture where the items of the lexicon are assigned transfer equivalents which carry the correct constraints about their incorporation into the target structure. This keeps the built-in transfer modules lean and easy to maintain, as they can be restricted to global transfer (and generation) routines which are independent of lexical pecularities (as presented by the treated structural mismatches). As a consequence this enables economic system development and maintenance. ...|$|R

With a standard NTSC video signal a head can cover one sixth of a field each time it passed across the tape. Switching in instrumentation models is gradual, so the signals from both heads overlaps briefly, producing a transient-free output signal where the original signal does not contain convenient dead intervals during which a switching transient can be hidden.|$|R

5000|$|Due to {{the path}} {{followed}} by the video and Hi-Fi audio heads being striped and discontinuous—unlike that of the linear audio track—head-switching is required to provide a continuous audio signal. While the video signal can easily hide the head-switching point in the invisible vertical retrace section of the signal, so that the exact switching point is not very important, the same is obviously not possible with a continuous audio signal that has no inaudible sections. Hi-Fi audio is thus dependent on a much more exact alignment of the <b>head</b> <b>switching</b> point than is required for non-HiFi VHS machines. Misalignments may lead to imperfect joining of the signal, resulting in low-pitched buzzing. The problem is known as [...] "head chatter", and tends to increase as the audio heads wear down.|$|R

40|$|Advances in {{electronics}} and transducer fabrication {{have provided the}} ultrasound system designer with the opportunity for integrating electronics into the transducer <b>head.</b> <b>Switched</b> mode circuits are miniaturizable, low loss and as such are suited to array excitation. Without careful excitation signal design switched mode waveforms lack combined time varying amplitude and harmonic control. Existing modulation schemes have provided either amplitude or harmonic control. The proposed harmonic reduction pulse width modulation (HRPWM) provides a method of creating a quinary (5 -level) switched waveform with both time-varying amplitude control and third harmonic cancellation. HRPWM achieves waveform control through matching the amplitude of energy contained at the fundamental frequency with the desired amplitude, and third harmonic cancellation {{through the use of}} a non-linear modulating waveform. The resulting HRPWM excitation signals use multiple bipolar low voltage pulses for the control of signals below 50 % magnitude, and a five-level pulse for amplitudes above 50 %. In simulations, HRPWM shows an excitation signal third harmonic power of - 34. 75 dB, a reduction of 19 dB from other 5 -level modulation schemes, and a ultrasound pressure waveform third harmonic power of - 64. 19 dB, a reduction of 19. 9 dB from other 5 -level modulation schemes, and 25 dB lower than bipolar switched excitation...|$|R
40|$|Smooth muscle myosin has two heads, each {{capable of}} {{interacting}} with actin to generate force and/or motion as it hydrolyzes ATP. These heads are inhibited when their associated regulatory light chain is unphosphorylated (0 P), becoming active and hydrolyzing ATP maximally when phosphorylated (2 P). Interestingly, {{with only one}} of the two regulatory light chains phosphorylated (1 P), smooth muscle myosin is active but its ATPase rate is < 2 P. To explain published 1 P single ATP turnover and steady-state ATPase activities, we propose a kinetic model in which 1 P myosin exists in an equilibrium between being fully active (2 P) and inhibited (0 P). Based on the single ATP turnover data, we also propose that each 2 P head adopts a hydrolytic role distinct from its partner at any point in time, i. e., one head strongly binds actin and hydrolyzes ATP at its actin-activated rate while the other weakly binds actin. Surprisingly, the <b>heads</b> <b>switch</b> roles slowly (< 0. 1 s− 1), suggesting that their activities are not independent. The phosphorylation-dependent equilibrium between active and inhibited states and the hydrolytic role that each head adopts during its interaction with actin may have implications for understanding regulation and mechanical performance of other members of the myosin family of molecular motors...|$|R
