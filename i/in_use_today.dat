5|$|Most of the CCC-built park {{facilities}} are still <b>in</b> <b>use</b> <b>today,</b> including log cabins, picnic pavilions, a food concession stand, {{and miles of}} trails.

5|$|The {{enormous}} {{effect of}} the Sun on Earth has been recognized since prehistoric times, and the Sun has been regarded by some cultures as a deity.

5|$|The most {{prominent}} {{portion of the}} harbour is the three enormous arches (the fourth original arch was walled in) of a large arsenal built in the late 12th century and enlarged {{in the latter part}} 15th century.

5|$|By the 1940s, budget {{concerns}} and national trends {{made it clear}} that Louisville Girls High School and duPont Manual would merge into one coeducational school. They finally did so in September 1950 and remained in the old Louisville Girls High School building. This fusion of institutions resulted in the birth of the modern duPont Manual High School – dropping 'Training' from its previous name. The same school building remains <b>in</b> <b>use</b> <b>today,</b> although two major additions have since been made. The middle school located on the building's first floor became Manly Junior High and moved to Manual's old building at Brook and Oak.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{recent changes}} {{in the field of}} {{anthropology}} and a shift in government objectives, the Pingpu and Gaoshan labels <b>in</b> <b>use</b> <b>today</b> maintain the form given by the Qing to reflect aborigines' acculturation to Han culture. The current recognized aborigines are all regarded as Gaoshan, though the divisions are not and have never been based strictly on geographical location. The Amis, Saisiat, Tao and Kavalan are all traditionally Eastern Plains cultures. The distinction between Pingpu and Gaoshan people continues to affect Taiwan's policies regarding indigenous peoples, and their ability to participate effectively in government.|$|E
5|$|Hafnium was {{separated}} from zirconium through repeated recrystallization of the double ammonium or potassium fluorides by Valdemar Thal Jantzen and von Hevesey. Anton Eduard van Arkel and Jan Hendrik de Boer {{were the first to}} prepare metallic hafnium by passing hafnium tetraiodide vapor over a heated tungsten filament in 1924. This process for differential purification of zirconium and hafnium is still <b>in</b> <b>use</b> <b>today.</b>|$|E

5|$|In 1863, two sail-driven tankers {{were built}} on England's River Tyne. These were {{followed}} in 1873 {{by the first}} oil-tank steamer, Vaderland, which was built by Palmers Shipbuilding and Iron Company for Belgian owners. The vessel's use was curtailed by U.S. and Belgian authorities citing safety concerns. By 1871, the Pennsylvania oil fields were making limited use of oil tank barges and cylindrical railroad tank-cars similar to those <b>in</b> <b>use</b> <b>today.</b>|$|E
5|$|Initially, the {{baseband}} pass range {{used was}} 200Hz to 2500Hz but later the International Telecommunication Union {{set a standard}} of 300Hz to 3.4kHz with 4kHz spacing. Thus the filtering was required to go from fully pass to fully stop {{in the space of}} 900Hz. This standard in telephony is still <b>in</b> <b>use</b> <b>today</b> and had remained widespread until it began to be supplanted by digital techniques from the 1980s onwards.|$|E
5|$|Li-ann Thio, a {{professor}} of international and human rights law at the National University of Singapore noted that many international law norms and customary practices developed in the inter-war years by the League of Nations are still <b>in</b> <b>use</b> <b>today.</b> She specifically addressed the procedures for managing intrastate and inter-ethnic issues through (1) international supervision, (2)supranational integration, (3)minority protection, (4)plebiscites, and (5)partitions. She cited the Palestine and Bosnian Partition Plans and 1990s European practice as examples of conditioning recognition of statehood on human rights, democracy, and minority protection guarantees.|$|E

5|$|Like aluminium, copper is {{recyclable}} {{without any}} loss of quality, both from raw state and from manufactured products. In volume, copper {{is the third}} most recycled metal after iron and aluminium. An estimated 80% of all copper ever mined is still <b>in</b> <b>use</b> <b>today.</b> According to the International Resource Panel's Metal Stocks in Society report, the global per capita stock of copper in use in society is 35–55kg. Much of this is in more-developed countries (140–300kg per capita) rather than less-developed countries (30–40kg per capita).|$|E
5|$|Many {{international}} law norms and customary practices {{developed in the}} inter-war years by the League of Nations are still <b>in</b> <b>use</b> <b>today.</b> The procedures for managing intrastate and inter-ethnic issues include international supervision, regional economic unions, minority protection, plebiscites, and territorial partition. The Palestine and Bosnian Partition Plans and European Union practice are modern examples of conditioning recognition of statehood on human rights, democracy, and minority protection guarantees.|$|E
5|$|Microbial {{communities}} {{produce a}} vast array of biologically active chemicals that are used in competition and communication. Many of the drugs <b>in</b> <b>use</b> <b>today</b> were originally uncovered in microbes; recent progress in mining the rich genetic resource of non-culturable microbes has led to the discovery of new genes, enzymes, and natural products. The application of metagenomics has allowed the development of commodity and fine chemicals, agrochemicals and pharmaceuticals where the benefit of enzyme-catalyzed chiral synthesis is increasingly recognized.|$|E
