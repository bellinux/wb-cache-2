25|$|Critics of MINUSTAH's goal of {{providing}} security {{say that the}} provision of increased police presence is coming with the unfortunate consequence of neglecting the vast socioeconomic problems in the area, the lack of effort in addressing infrastructure improvement, the joblessness and the pervasive poverty. In 2009, with the appointment of former U.S. President Bill Clinton as the UN Special Envoy, there is hope that the international <b>donor</b> <b>community</b> will provide increased aid. MINUSTAH renewed its commitment to Haiti, and $3 billion for projects has been pledged by the international community, much of this for rebuilding after the hurricanes. However, in Cité Soleil, {{there are signs of}} a desire for political independence that the international community would rather ignore.|$|E

World leaders have cited failed states {{as one of}} the greatest threats to the global community. Nevertheless the concept of the failed state is currently subject to a backlash from the academic community. Scholars have criticised the failed states literature on theoretical, normative, empirical and practical grounds. We provide a brief overview of these main concerns and offer a more systematic method for measuring ‘state failure’. Coming up with better ways of assessing how states underperform will enhance our understanding of how institutional decay affects stability and development and, most importantly, will provide an improved system of early warning for practitioners...|$|R

40|$|Development aid is characterised by an {{inherently}} asymmetry between {{donor and recipient}} institution. Despite regular aid reforms and bold ambitions to change this relation, the asymmetry seems to persist. Inspired by post-development theory, and drawing on both a review of development theory and ethnographic fieldwork within the World Bank, this article argues that the lopsided aid-relations are continuously being reproduced through the formation of development expert knowledge within authoritative <b>donor</b> <b>communities.</b> Here, contemporary knowledge/power formations shape and are shaped by historically embedded structures and epistemic communities that benefit the donor's need for legible and operational knowledge, being knowledge of a particular kind. Hence, top-down approaches to development planning are reproduced {{at the cost of}} participatory, bottom-up ones, as per the official order and rhetoric...|$|R

40|$|Aim: Most {{studies on}} invasibility {{consider}} {{the characteristics of}} the habitats colonized. However, the success of the establishment of exotic species can be conditioned by {{the characteristics of the}} <b>donor</b> <b>communities.</b> In this study, we analyse {{the extent to which the}} distribution of exotic herbaceous species in Chile is conditioned either by the climatic characteristics of the recipient area or by the environmental features of the source areas on the Iberian Peninsula. Location: Chile and the Iberian Peninsula (Portugal and Spain). Methods: for Chile, we characterized the exotic species according to their current Chilean distribution and their region of origin. For the Iberian Peninsula, we compiled the ﬂoristic composition of 11, 702 releves. We classiﬁed each releve according to key habitat characteristics (bioclimate, soil nutrient status and type of community associated with human activities) and calculated the percentage of species in common with Chile in different climatic regions therein. Results: Over half of Chile’s exotic species exhibited a geographic distribution related to the climate of the recipient area. The main <b>donor</b> <b>communities</b> were those associated with ruderal and arable land habitats, although their importance depended upon the climate in the recipient area. Correspondence was observed between the climatic characteristics of the communities in the source area and those of the recipient areas. Main conclusions: the results highlight the inﬂuence of the characteristics of habitats in the source area on the successful establishment of exotic species in Chile. The relationships between source and recipient area are scale dependent, climate constituting the main driver at broad scale. Within each climatic region, the communities associated with habitats presenting greater anthropic inﬂuence act as the main donors. Both features indicate the existence of ﬁlters that select species pre-adapted to the climatic and habitat conditions in the recipient area...|$|R

The aim of this paper, written over 10 years later, is to examine the latest trends of female birth and survival in South and East Asia, consider the influences on the situation of economic and cultural factors and to appraise policies aiming to counter excess female mortality.

40|$|The {{concept of}} social {{entrepreneurship}} as a characterization of social responsibility for business organizations has gained considerable popularity.

Yet, {{there is no consensus}} within these communities as to what constitutes social entrepreneurship, and how the BoP is defined. Confusion arises from the absence of generally accepted definitions for both terms, leaving much scope for some conventional for‐profit activities to assert a higher social service status. This paper attempts to clarify what constitutes social entrepreneurship serving the BOP segment of the population, and how the BoP may be defined to better represent the poor...|$|R
