25|$|Kārlis Ulmanis's legacy <b>for</b> <b>Latvia</b> and Latvians is {{a complex}} one.

25|$|After a {{long period}} of very high growth of GDP, the GDP of Estonia {{decreased}} by a little over 3% on a yearly basis in the 3rd quarter of 2008. In the 4th quarter of 2008 the negative growth was already −9.4%. Some international experts and journalists, who like to view the three Baltic states as a single economic identity, have failed to notice that Estonia has constantly performed better than Lithuania and Latvia on many fundamental indicators. Still, in 2009 Estonia was one of the five worst performing economies in {{the world in terms of}} annual GDP growth rate. The current account deficit and inflation is lower than in Latvia, the GDP per capita is higher than in Latvia and Lithuania, Estonia's public debt is a very low 3.8% of GDP and government reserves are close to 10% of GDP. The difference is exemplified by the fact that in December 2008 Estonia became one of the donor countries to the IMF lead rescue package <b>for</b> <b>Latvia.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1994 {{the voting}} age was lowered from 21 to 18. In 1996, the Constitutional Court was established. In 1997, major {{changes to the}} {{articles}} regulating the process of elections and the functions of Saeima, the President (including prolonging their terms of office from 3 to 4 years) and the Cabinet were made. In 1998, aside from adding chapter eight (fundamental human rights) to the constitution, official status was secured to the Latvian language, the requirement for a referendum to change articles 4 and 77 was made, and article 82 was fully changed; it now defines types of courts in Latvia. In 2002, requirement for members of Saeima to give a solemn promise to acquire their mandate was added. Official status for the Latvian language was further secured by making it the working language of state and municipal structures. In 2003, several amendments were made in order <b>for</b> <b>Latvia</b> to join the European Union. In 2004, amendments to certain rights {{of the president and}} citizens were made. In 2006, an amendment that defined that marriage as the union of one man and one woman was added. In 2007, article 40 was amended and article 81 was abolished.

2500|$|Activity {{picked up}} {{in the second half of}} 1942, one year after the first winter war, but real work by the {{partisan}}s in Latvia started only in 1943 after the German Army Group B stalled at Stalingrad and Kursk. The partisan regiment [...] "Par Padomju Latviju" [...] was organized and started training June 1942 in Leningrad and from Staraya Russa, three small Latvian partisan units (about 200 men) headed <b>for</b> <b>Latvia.</b> July 7, the regiment with combat reached Latvian Kārsava region, but there the German found and dispersed them with great losses and only several partisans escaped. Next partisan unit was formed September 1942 near Moscow from volunteers, from 201st Latvian Riflemen Division and Latvian partisan regiment [...] "Par Padomju Latviju" [...] combatants. Commander of these units was Vilis Samsons, who later became a Soviet historian. In March this unit was renamed to Latvian Partisan Brigade. This partisan regiment combat began East of Latvian borders and only at the end of 1943 they entered the territory of Latvia. Since the local population in Latvia would not support Soviet partisans, they could not gain a foothold. 3,000-man unit of Vilis Samsons was credited with the destruction of nearly 130 German trains; however, this seems to be a fabrication. Leningrad partisan brigade, which consisted only of Russians (commander M.I. Klementjev) fought around Lake Lubāns. In 1944 and 1945 in Courland they formed many small partisan units (2 to 12 men each) but very active. Most noted was [...] "Sarkana bulta". The Latvian Red partisans suffered great losses, and many from smaller groups were completely eliminated.|$|E
