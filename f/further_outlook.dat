40|$|This {{article is}} a review by the authors {{concerning}} {{the construction of a}} Poincaré covariant (owing to spacetime continuum) field-theoretic formalism in terms of step-function-type basis functions without ultraviolet divergences. This formalism analytically derives confinement/deconfinement, mass-gap and Regge trajectory for non-Abelian gauge fields, and gives solutions for self-interacting scalar fields. Fields propagate in spacetime continuum and fields with finite degrees of freedom toward continuum limit have no ultraviolet divergence. Basis functions defined in a parameter spacetime are mapped to real spacetime. The authors derive a new solution comprised of classical fields as a vacuum and quantum fluctuations, leading to the linear potential between the particle and antiparticle from the Wilson loop. The Polyakov line gives finite binding energies and reveals the deconfining property at high temperatures. The quantum action yields positive mass from the classical fields and quantum fluctuations produces the Coulomb potential. Pure Yang-Mills fields show the same mass-gap owing to the particle-antiparticle pair creation. The Dirac equation under linear potential is analytically solved in this formalism, reproducing the principal properties of Regge trajectories at a quantum level. <b>Further</b> <b>outlook</b> mentions a possibility of the difference between conventional continuum and present wave functions responsible for the cosmological constant.

40|$|The packing {{quality of}} a High Performance Liquid Chromatography column has {{significant}} impact on the resulting separations. In practice, problems in a packing occur through normal usage of a column. Resulting chromatograms from inhomogeneities exhibit varying problems such as extreme tailing and double peaks. Early detection of such problems is critical to fixing problems before their effect harms efficiency, but a fully developed theory of how inhomogeneities affect separations does not exist. The purpose of this work was to experimentally characterize HPLC column inhomogeneities and to begin preliminary simulations of HPLC columns with the computer simulation package STAR-CD. To do this, columns were first packed with a standard packing recommended by the manufacturer of the column. Later, two types of inhomogeneity were individually packed into columns: cavities and balls. The resulting chromatograms were analyzed and compared. The results show that as was expected, introducing inhomogeneities reduced separation quality. A simulation was created to model a one- dimensional column and a chromatogram was produced from this simulated column. From the simulated column, one can see that producing chromatograms entirely from a simulation produces an accurate, adjustable, and quick method for studying the column. Recommended further research includes more experiments involving inhomogeneities and simulations incorporating inhomogeneities. A <b>further</b> <b>outlook</b> includes research into pattern recognition with the goal of being able to analyze a series of chromatograms produced by the same column and notice small changes that indicate a specific inhomogeneity is forming...|$|E
40|$|The Greifswald University Hospital in Germany {{conducts a}} {{research}} project called "Greifswald Approach to Individualized Medicine (GANI_MED) ", which aims at improving patient care through personalized medicine. As {{a result of this}} project, there are multiple regional patient cohorts set up for different common diseases. The collected data of these cohorts will act as a resource for epidemiological research. Researchers are going to get the possibility to use this data for their study, by utilizing a variety of different descriptive metadata attributes. The actual medical datasets of the patients are integrated from multiple clinical information systems and medical devices. Yet, {{at this point in the}} process of defining a research query, researchers do not have proper tools to query for existing patient data. There are no tools available which offer a metadata catalogue that is linked to observational data, which would allow convenient research. Instead, researchers have to issue an application for selected variables that fit the conditions of their study, and wait for the results. That leaves the researchers not knowing in advance, whether there are enough (or any) patients fitting the specified inclusion and exclusion criteria.

40|$|Purpose Growing {{awareness}} of the environmental performance of construction products and buildings brings about the need for a suitable method to assess their environmental performance. Life cycle assessment (LCA) has become a widely recognised and accepted method to assess the burdens and impacts throughout the life cycle. This LCA-based information may be in the form of environmental product declarations (EPD) or product environmental footprints (PEF), based on reliable and verifiable information. All of these use LCA to quantify and report several environmental impact categorie and may also provide additional information. To better understand on the one hand existing EPD programmes (EN 15804) for each country and on the other the recent developments in terms of EU reference document (e. g. PEF), the authors decided to write this review paper based on the outcomes of the EPD workshop that was held prior to SB 13 Graz conference. Methods This paper presents {{the state of the art}} in LCA and an overview of the EPD programmes in five European countries (Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Switzerland) based on the workshop in the first part and a comprehensive description and comparison of the PEF method and EN 15804 in the second part. In the last part, a general conclusion will wrap up the findings and results will provide a <b>further</b> <b>outlook</b> on future activities. Results and discussion The high number of EPD programmes underlines the fact that there is obviously a demand for assessments of the environmental performance of construction materials. In the comparison between and experiences of the different countries, it can be seen that more similarities than differences exist. A comparison between PEF and EPD shows differences, e. g. LCIA impact categories and recycling methodology. Conclusions Independent of raising {{awareness of}} the construction material environmental performance, the existence of so many environmental claims calls for clarification and harmonisation. Additionally, construction materials being assessed in the voluntary approaches have to follow the harmonised approach following the principles of the European Construction Products Regulation (regulated) not to foster barriers of trade. The authors therefore highly appreciate the most recent activities of the sustainability of construction works (CEN/TC 350 committee [URL] espacenormalisation/CENTC 350 /index. html) currently working on these issues at the EU level. Finally, the LCA community is further encouraged to increase the background life cycle inventory data and life cycle inventory modelling as well as the meaningfulness of certain environmental impact categories, such as toxicity, land use, biodiversity and resource usage...|$|E

40|$|In {{the field}} of {{spintronics}} the electron spin is used as information carrierin addition to the charge. One particular branch in the metal-basedspin-devices, is {{the field of}} domain wall devices. Recently, they are understudy because of their potential application in memory or logic devices. An important challenge for these possible applications is the reliabilityand speed of operation. Therefore, an extensive study to understand thebehavior of domain walls in different geometries and under influence ofcurrent or field, is necessary. In this work, we have studied the field induced propagation of domainwalls in nanowires. Magneto-optical Kerr effect and magneto-resistancemeasurements as well as micromagnetic simulations have been used, tocharacterize the injection and detection of domain walls in different Ni 80 Fe 20 nanostructures. On the most promising geometry, we performed timeresolvedMOKE measurements, to determine the real-time DW velocity. The obtained velocities and mobilities are comparable to state-of-the-artliterature. Micromagnetic simulations in our relatively wide nanowires(750 nm) reveal that the propagating domain wall structure is combinationof different types, which becomes even more complex above a thresholdfield, the so-called Walker breakdown field. Increase or suppression of this Walker breakdown field has received increasedattention, both because of increase of the maximum domain wallvelocity and reliable propagation of a simple domain wall structure. Inthisthesis, two methods which influence the Walker breakdown phenomenonare proposed, based on the magnetic field pulse rise time and an extraoscillating magnetic field {{on top of the}} external applied magnetic field. The domain wall shape is influenced by the risetime at which the magneticfield pulse is applied and, at Walker breakdown, can be simplifiedby applying an oscillating magnetic field. Next to the study of conventional Ni 80 Fe 20 devices, we performed a micromagnetic study of the influence of shape and material parameters onthe overall device performance. It has been shown that a decrease ofthe Gilbert damping increases the DW mobility but doesnt influencethe maximum domain wall velocity. The addition of uniaxial transverseanisotropy increase both mobility and maximum domain wall velocity. On the other hand, we have shown that Walker breakdown can be suppressedby changing the nanowire width/thickness ratio. In addition tothis study, we have experimentally shown that de domain wall velocityis remarquably higher in a material with low Gilbert damping and extrauniaxial anisotropy, in this specific cas, the Heusler alloy NiMnSb.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{we chose the}} {{combination}} of blue-emitting colloidal CdSe/ZnS quantum dots (QDs) as a triplet emitter and poly(9 -vinylcarbazole) (PVK) as matrix material for the emitting layer. PVK and related compounds are considered as reliable emitting materials as well as suitable charge carrier transport matrices when blue emission is involved. Furthermore the optical and charge transport properties of this polymer have been studied extensively. Due to the requirements for Förster and Dexter energy transfer efficient energy transfer from respectively the singlet and triplet excited state of the matrix to the QDs requires a short average distance between the donor and acceptor. To achieve this condition with a minimum loading of QDs requires, besides a small size of the QDs, a homogeneous distribution (no clustering) of the QDs. The physicochemical behavior and emission efficiency of the QDs dispersed in the polymer matrix is typically determined by their organic capping layer. Hence the organic ligand must on one hand strongly bind {{to the surface of}} the QDs to ensure a strong capping and avoid an extensive aggregation of the QDs in the doped polymer film. On the other hand it must have sufficient affinity for the host polymer to avoid a phase separation and achieve in this way a homogeneous distribution of the QDs. We therefore developed novel ligands; fatty acid ligands terminated by a carbazole group with series of alkyl-chain lengths (C 6, C 11, and C 16) as well as a procedure to either put those ligands on naked QDs or to replace the initial ligands on the QDs by those novel ligands. The grafting density of the carbazole ligands was estimated by solution NMR experiment (chapter 2 and 3). By adding a known amount of CH 2 Br 2 to a solution of the QDs in CDCl 3 the number of ligands per QD was estimated by comparing the ratio of the area under the CH 2 Br 2 resonance and the area under one of the carbazole resonances. In this way a density of 76 and 44 ligands/QD corresponding to 2. 25 and 1. 3 ligands/nm 2 was obtained for C 6 and C 11 (chapter 2) when the samples were prepared by ligand exchange starting from commercial long chain alkylamine (LCA) capped QDs (EVIDOT). When the samples were prepared by post-synthetic (direct) encapsulation of QDs prepared at UGent a density of 44 and 62 ligands/QD corresponding to 1. 2 and 1. 7 ligands/nm 2 was obtained for C 11 and C 16 (chapter 3). This suggests, based on comparison with a literature values, that only the 30 to 50 % of QD surface is covered by carbazole ligands. In chapter 2 and chapter 3, we showed that by encapsulating the QDs with the carbazole ligands the miscibility between the QDs and PVK was improved significantly compared to the situation where commonly used ligands such as LCA and OA were used. The improvement of the miscibility results in less clustering of the QDs in the PVK film and thus allows more efficient singlet and triplet energy transfers from the polymer to the QDs. At the same dopant (QD) loading a more efficient energy transfer from the carbazole moieties to the QDs was observed in the PVK film doped with the C 16 capped QDs compared to the film doped with C 11 capped QDs which in turn showed more efficient energy transfer than the film doped with C 6 capped QDs. More efficient energy transfer in the doped PVK films with C 16 capped QDs corresponds to less and/or smaller clusters of the QDs which was confirmed by AFM and confocal fluorescence images. The estimation for the singlet and triplet energy transfer efficiencies based on time-resolved fluorescence experiment and stationary PL spectra indicated that the increase of the overall energy transfer efficiency mainly corresponds to the increase of the triplet energy transfer efficiency, which requires a short distance between the carbazole moieties and the QD cores as it occurs by an electron exchange interaction. Decreased clustering leads at the same load of QDs to a higher concentration of individual QDs and hence to a shorter average distance between the carbazole moieties and the QDs, resulting in a more efficient triplet energy transfer. In addition to the increase of the triplet transfer efficiency, the less extensive clustering of the QDs also produces a smoother film when the PVK film was doped with C 16 capped QDs. As known for organic electronic devices, a smoother organic film is another key factor to ensure a better interface with the electrodes or other organic layers and hence a more efficient charge injection in the polymer layer by other organic layers and/or a metallic electrode. Although we observed that the ligand properties are critically important to enhance the miscibility and energy transfer between the carbazole moieties and QDs, at the highest QD concentrations used a saturation of the energy transfer still occurred in the PVK matrix. At high concentration (30 wt%) even the C 16 capped QDs started to cluster in the PVK matrix, which limits the efficiency of triplet energy transfer. Therefore we explored alternatives for PVK. As alternative to PVK we chose poly(9 -(2, 3 -epoxypropyl) carbazole) (PEPK) (chapter 4) which has a much smaller molecular weight and shows less extensive excimer formation, the latter indicating less extensive ground state interactions between the carbazole moieties. Furthermore this compound was reported to have better film forming properties compared to PVK. At a concentration of 30 wt% of QDs capped with C 16 ligands more efficient singlet and triplet energy transfer to the QDs was observed in the films of PEPK compared to doped PVK films. E. g. at a loading of 30 wt% QDs the quantum yield for singlet energy transfer, as determined from the analysis of the fluorescence decays, amounted to 41 ± 2 % in the PEPK matrix while it was only 12 ± 0. 6 % in the PVK matrix. This can be related to the smaller number of excimer sites present in PEPK. While those sites do not block direct energy transfer from an excited carbazole to the QDs they will block exciton hopping between the carbazole moieties. Furthermore also a better miscibility with the QDs can play a role at this high loading of 30 wt%. This better miscibility can also explain why the triplet energy transfer was more efficient in PEPK where it amounted to 72 % at a loading of 30 wt% QDs while under those conditions in PVK only a value of 37 % was found. Excimer sites are not expected to hinder the hopping of triplet states through the polymer matrix as they lack, contrary to the singlet state, the stabilization by exciton interaction. In addition to the doped polymer films, we also observed the energy transfer from the bound carbazole ligands to the QDs in a solution of the QDs in chlorobenzene (chapter 2 and 3). By increasing the length of the carbazole ligand from C 6 to C 16, i. e. increasing the distance between the carbazole moiety and the QD, less efficient energy transfer was observed. This is in agreement with the distance dependence predicted in the Förster and Dexter theory, but contradicts the results we obtained in PVK films (chapter 2 and 3). The estimation of the efficiency for triplet transfer in a solution of C 6 capped QDs from Evidot (chapter 2) and C 11 and C 16 capped QDs from UGent (chapter 3) yielded values much in excess of 100 %, which are physically unacceptable (significantly over 100 %). We attributed these deviations to accumulation of experimental errors related mainly an overestimation of the value of the relative intensity of the QD luminescence in the fluorescence spectra (due to the wavelength dependence of the refractive index of the solution) and to the determination of the fluorescence quantum yield of the QDs. Due to the procedure used to determine the efficiency of triplet transfer, underestimation of the fluorescence quantum yield of the QDs will increase the observed efficiency for triplet energy transfer drastically. In this respect one should also mention the batch to batch variation of the fluorescence quantum yield of the QDs and the observation that this parameter was observed to change during the optical measurements and the storage time of the samples after preparation. In chapter 5 the hole and electron transports in pristine PVK films and PVK films doped with the QDs are discussed. The carrier mobilities were determined using the time-of-flight (TOF) method. In pristine PVK films the field dependence of the mobility shows at 298 K a positive Pool-Frenkel slope for the hole mobility, while a small negative slope is observed for the electron mobility. Moreover the hole mobility is over two orders of magnitude larger than the electron mobility in range of applied fields (~ 4. 0 - 6. 5 × 105 V/cm) that was investigated. The experiments were extended to the hole transport in PVK films doped with C 11 capped QDs. Upon increasing the QD concentration the hole mobility decreased by nearly 2 orders of magnitude at a doping concentration of 3. 87 × 1018 dots/cm 3 (12 wt%) at T = 298 K. For pristine PVK as well as for PVK doped with the QDs up to a concentration of 3. 87 × 1018 dots/cm 3 the field and temperature dependence of the hole mobility could be analyzed formally in the framework of the Bässler disorder model. This analysis shows the increaseof the energetic (&# 963;) and spatial (&# 931;) disorder upon increasing the QD concentration in a range from zero to 3. 87 × 1018 dots/cm 3. This indicates that the presence of QDs enlarges formally the spread of energy levels and intersite distances of the holes. In contrast to the zero-field mobility obtained in the temperature range from 298 K to 338 K (&# 956; 0), which is reduced upon increasing QD concentration, the logarithm of the zero field mobility extrapolated at infinite temperature (&# 956; 00) is observed to increase almost linearly with the doping concentration. Considering the modest trapping in spite of the high concentration of QDs compared to systems where a deep trap was introduced, one has to conclude that the traps generated by the QDs are rather shallow. Although a study of the dependence of the ZnS shells thickness on the optical properties of the QDs did not suggest a major delocalization of the electron or hole over the ZnS shell or trapping of the exciton by surface states on the ZnS shell or at the interface between the ZnS shell and the CdSe core, this should not exclude that surface states on the ZnS shell close or slightly above the HOMO of PVK can accommodate holes and act as traps and at higher concentration also as alternative transport sites. A further increase of the QD concentration up to 7. 1 × 1018 dots/cm 3 (22 wt%) leads however again to an increase of the hole mobility. Furthermore at this QD doping level of 7. 1 × 1018 dots/cm 3, the data can no longer be analyzed formally in the framework of the Gaussian disorder model. Considering that this concentration of 7. 1 × 1018 dots/cm 3 corresponds to a situation where 30. 4 volume% of the film is occupied by the C 11 capped QDs, the limitation of the model is attributed to hopping of holes over percolating QD clusters. This high volume fraction is a consequence of the layers of ZnS shell (0. 6 nm) and C 11 ligands (0. 46 nm) of the QDs. The formation of those percolating clusters will be enhanced by the limited miscibility between the C 11 capped QDs and PVK at this relatively high concentration.

40|$|Plant growth {{promoting}} rhizobacteria are the soil bacteria inhabiting around/on the root surface and are {{directly or indirectly}} involved in promoting plant growth and development via production and secretion of various regulatory chemicals {{in the vicinity of}} rhizosphere. Generally, plant {{growth promoting}} rhizobacteria facilitate the plant growth directly by either assisting in resource acquisition (nitrogen, phosphorus and essential minerals) or modulating plant hormone levels, or indirectly by decreasing the inhibitory effects of various pathogens on plant growth and development in the forms of biocontrol agents. Various studies have documented the increased health and productivity of different plant species by the application of plant growth promoting rhizobacteria under both normal and stressed conditions.

50|$|PDK4 is {{relevant}} {{in a variety}} of clinical conditions. Short-term fasting induces an increase in PDK4 transcription by about 10-fold. Upon refeeding, transcription of PDK4 increased <b>further,</b> a surprising <b>outlook,</b> by about 50-fold over levels before fasting began. This effect can be seen long term as well. PDK4 is overexpressed in skeletal muscle in type 2 diabetes, resulting in impaired glucose utilization. In post-obese patients, there is a significant decrease in PDK4 mRNA expression, in conjunction with increased glucose uptake; this is likely due to the downregulation of PDK4 by insulin. This corroborates the concept that a lowered availability of free fatty acids affects glucose metabolism by PDH complex regulation.In fact, {{it has been shown that}} insufficient downregulation of PDK mRNA in insulin-resistant individuals could be a cause of increased PDK expression leading to impaired glucose oxidation followed by increased fatty acid oxidation.|$|R
