50|$|Hillsborough is {{the site}} of an Iron Age hill fort atop the cliff on a {{promontory}} at approx 115 metres above sea level. The fort takes the classic shape of a promontory reinforced and cut off landwards by a defensive earthworks. These consist of two linear banks and ditches, oriented northwest to southeast, and contouring across the slope. For an iron age fort in northern Devon, the length of these banks, at 280 m, is large. There is a clearly-defined gateway near the eastern end of both banks, which is likely to have been the main entrance to the interior of the fort.

5000|$|A {{fault in}} the {{appliance}} which causes a live conductor {{to contact the}} casing will cause a current to flow in the earth conductor.

This time and the current rating in turn sets a maximum <b>earth</b> <b>resistance</b> permissible. To provide supplementary protection against high-impedance faults it is common to recommend a residual-current device (RCD) also known as a residual current circuit breaker (RCCB), ground fault circuit interrupter (GFCI), or residual current operated circuit-breaker with integral over-current protection (RCBO), which will cut off the supply of electricity to the appliance if the currents in the two poles of the supply are not equal and opposite.|$|E
