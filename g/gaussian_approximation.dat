40|$|We study <b>Gaussian</b> <b>approximations</b> to the {{distribution}} of a diffusion. The approximations are easy to compute: they are defined by two simple ordinary differential equations for the mean and the covariance. Time correlations can also be computed via solution of a linear stochastic differential equation. We show, using the Kullback-Leibler divergence, that the approximations are accurate in the small noise regime. An analogous discrete time setting is also studied. The results provide both theoretical support {{for the use of}} Gaussian processes in the approximation of diffusions, and methodological guidance in the construction of <b>Gaussian</b> <b>approximations</b> in applications...|$|R

In particular, {{we examine the}} sufficient conditions on the source and the channel under which there exists a n-length block code satisfying the condition that the error probability of reconstructing the discrete memoryless multiple source is no larger than some fixed constant > 0, or in short, -lossless transmission. We modify the decoding rule of Cover-El Gamal-Salehi and analyze the error probability using <b>Gaussian</b> <b>approximations</b> to derive a second-order generalization their sufficient condition for the -lossless transmission of the correlated sources.

40|$|The goal of {{the present}} work is twofold. First, we use the {{modified}} random walk Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method introduced by [1] to sample from the posterior distribution that arises from Bayesian data assimilation in a groundwater model. Second, we use these samples to evaluate the performance of standard ad hoc <b>Gaussian</b> <b>approximations</b> of the posterior. We use a synthetic experiment to show that our MCMC implementation converges faster than the standard random walk MCMC. In addition, we design a controlled experiment to evaluate the performance of standard <b>Gaussian</b> <b>approximations</b> of the posterior. More precisely, we use our MCMC characterization of the posterior to compare the uncertainty quantification properties of the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), randomized maximum likelihood (RML) and maximum a posterior (MAP) methods...|$|R

40|$|The model {{we discuss}} {{in this paper}} deals with {{inequality}} in distribution {{in the presence of}} a covariate. To elucidate that dependence, we propose to consider the composition of the cumulative quantile regression (CQR) function and the Goldie concentration curve, the standardized counterpart of which gives a fraction to fraction plot of the response and the covariate. It has the merit of enhancing the visibility of inequality in distribution when the latter is present. We shall examine the asymptotic properties of the corresponding empirical estimator. The associated empirical process involves a randomly stopped partial sum process of induced order statistics. Strong <b>Gaussian</b> <b>approximations</b> of the processes are constructed. The result forms the basis for the asymptotic theory of functional statistics based on these processes.
