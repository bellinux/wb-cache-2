5|$|Despite the loss, Weaver still {{believed}} the Populist cause would triumph. He {{agreed to be}} nominated one last time for his old 6th district House seat on a Democratic-Populist fusion ticket.

The fusionists backed Bryan, the Democratic nominee, but he lost again to McKinley, this time by a greater margin. The following year, Weaver was elected to office for the last time as the mayor of his hometown, Colfax, Iowa.|$|E

With five-minute breaks between the groups, qualifying had an overall length of 55 minutes.|$|E
