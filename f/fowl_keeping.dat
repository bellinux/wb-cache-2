The long-legged birds are always to be found here in numbers, but the ducks are uncertain, so are the geese. At certain times in the year they leave us altogether. Some say they go across the Great Sea to the north; others that they go far south into Nubia. Then {{even when they are}} here they are uncertain. Sometimes they are thick here, then again there is scarce one to be seen, and we hear they are {{swarming}} on the lakes further to the west. Of course the wading birds are of no use for food; so you see when the ducks and geese are scarce, we have a hard time of it. Then, again, even when we have got a boat-load {{we have a long way}} to take it to market, and when the weather is hot all may get spoiled before we can sell them; and the price is so low in these parts when the flocks are here that it is hard to lay by enough money to keep us and our families during the slack time. If the great cities Thebes and Memphis lay near to us, it would be different. They could consume all we could catch, and we should get better prices, but unless under very favorable circumstances there is no hope of the <b>fowl</b> <b>keeping</b> good during the long passage up the river to Thebes. In fact, were it not for our decoys we should starve. In these, of course, we take them alive, and send them in baskets to Thebes, and in that way get a fair price for them." ...|$|E

Every settlement is composed of several exogamous maximal patrilineages, that is, localized clans or clan sections, each of which claims to be descended from an original ancestor. Marriage is virilocal; upon marriage the women move to another clan section into the house of their husbands. Buli, {{the language of the}} Bulsa, belongs to the Gur languages of the Voltaïc region. The Bulsa were completely without writing before the coming of the British. 2 The Bulsa had, and still have, a copious oral tradition rich in folktales, songs, riddles, proverbs, and historical accounts. 3 Together with my Ghanaian and German collaborators I collected a corpus 1 For an introduction to the ethnography of the Bulsa, see Schott 1970...|$|R
