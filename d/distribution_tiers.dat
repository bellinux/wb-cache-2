40|$|The {{economic}} growth and industrial development in China {{over the last decade}} has been of considerable interest to industry and policy-makers alike, and also been subject of many academic studies. Considerable research on the macro-{{economic growth}} and process of industrialisation, as well as the subsequent increase in the domestic demand has been reported. In case of the automotive industry, previous studies have analysed the rather complex industry structure, still dominated by a range of joint ventures between domestic and foreign manufacturers, and specifically commented on the potential and sustainability of domestic demand. In this study we aim to extend the focus by analysing the key features and challenges not only at the manufacturer, but also at the supplier and <b>distribution</b> <b>tiers</b> in the automotive supply chain in China. Reviewing the governmental policies that led the auto industry's development since 1950, we analyse the current capabilities and challenges at the different tiers in the automotive value chain, before concluding with an outlook on the factors impacting on the future development of the automotive industry in China...|$|E
40|$|In today’s {{competitive}} markets, {{companies are}} shifting from a Product-centric to a Customer-centric view. The after-sales (AS) activities – those activities taking {{place after the}} purchase of the product and devoted to supporting the customer in the usage and disposal of the goods – can become a key differentiator and a major profit source. The importance of AS service is shown, for instance, by figures regarding the computer industry in the U. S. A. : AS activities account for 24 % of revenues and 45 % of profits of OEMs; in other industrial sectors after-sales accounts for 10 - 20 % of revenues and 20 - 40 % of profits. Thus, after sales cannot be merely a set of operative activities, but rather it plays a strategic role, affecting the definition of the product-service mix offered to the customer and the physical and organizational configuration of the overall logistics chain. In the past and present years, a plethora of literature dealt on the topic of performance measurement. However, due also to the perception of after sales as a “necessary evil”, no significant emphasis has been put on the definition of a structured business performance measurement system. Monitoring and measuring AS activities has to ensure a proper balance between business and operational objectives and their assessments. In addition, since more actors are involved along the service chain (starting from the part supplier, to the product manufacturer itself and <b>distribution</b> <b>tiers),</b> an integrated and multi-attribute set of measures needs to be properly designed. In this context the purpose of the paper is: i.) to review the existing body of knowledge about AS performance measurement systems and the industrial practice in durable consumer goods – automotive, home appliances, consumer electronics - through an empirical research performed within the ASAP research project and, ii.) to propose an integrated framework for AS performance measurement consisting of three levels (business, process and functional) ...|$|E

40|$|This report {{provides}} {{a proposal for}} a framework for risk assessment of bioaccumulative substances, either from produced water discharges or present as background contamination. The proposed framework is such that it is compatible to the current EIF risk assessment models that are used in the Norwegian offshore oil and gas industry. The risk assessment approach selected for this framework is based on the use of critical body residues (CBR); i. e., body-tissue concentrations above which adverse effects are expected. A three-tiered risk assessment approach is distinguished: tier 1 for worst-case screening purposes; tier 2 based on probabilistic risk assessment using species sensitivity <b>distributions</b> and <b>tier</b> 3 focusing on population modelling for specific species. The latter tier is, because of its specific characteristics, not elaborated in detail. It is proposed to use a food-chain accumulation model to translate species sensitivity thresholds on the basis of CBR into external threshold concentrations, those external thresholds could then be used to either derive an ecosystem PNEC (tier I) or Species Sensitivity <b>Distribution</b> (<b>tier</b> II). This would provide a pragmatic approach to risk assessment of bioaccumulative substances {{in the context of the}} EIF modelling framework. Finally, an outline is provided for a research project in which the a risk assessment model for bioaccumulative substances is developed. This model will then be applied to two cases for purposes of demonstration and evaluation. An indication of workload and planning is provided...|$|R

Addressing this, we present the design andimplementation of a novel architecture for synchrophasor data analysis on distributed commodity hardware. At the core is a newfeature-rich timeseries store, BTrDB. Capable of sustained writes and reads in excess of 16 million points per second per cluster node, advanced query functionality and highly efficient storage, this database enables novel analysis and visualization techniques. Leveraging this, a distillate framework has been developed that enables agile development of scalable analysis pipelines with strict guarantees on result integrity despite asynchronous changes in data or out of order arrival. Finally, the system is evaluated in a pilot deployment, archiving more than 216 billion raw datapoints and 515 billion derived datapoints from 13 devices in just 3. 9 TB. We show {{that the system is}} capable of scaling to handle complex analytics and storage {{for tens of thousands of}} next-generation synchrophasors on off-the-shelf servers...|$|R
40|$|Ubiquitous {{computing}} {{promotes the}} proliferation of var-ious stationary, embedded and mobile devices intercon-nected by heterogeneous networks. It leads to a highly dynamic distributed system with many devices and ser-vices coming and going frequently. Many emerging dis-tributed multimedia applications are being deployed in such a computing environment. In {{order to make the}} experi-ence for a user truly seamless and to provide soft perfor-mance guarantees, we must meet the following challenges: (1) users should be able to perform tasks continuously, de-spite changes of resources, devices and locations; (2) users should be able to efficiently utilize all accessible resources within runtime environments to receive the best possible Quality-of-Service (QoS). In this paper, we propose an in-tegrated QoS-aware service configuration model to address the above problems. The configuration model includes two tiers: (1) service composition tier, which is responsible for choosing and composing current available service compo-nents appropriately and coordinating arbitrary interactions between them to achieve the user’s objectives; and (2) ser-vice <b>distribution</b> <b>tier,</b> which is responsible for dividing an application into several partitions and distributing them to different available devices appropriately.

Decentralization is argued to blur lines of responsibility and confuse voters about whom to blame for poor economic performance at the national and regional levels. National and Regional Economic Voting (NEV and REV, respectively) are tested in Catalonia (Spain). The initial empirical test suggests that only NEV takes place in this region. Four hypotheses are considered to explain REV’s absence: blame-shifting, blinding nationalism, coalition government, and misinformation regarding Policy Responsibility <b>Distribution</b> across <b>tiers</b> of government. Using reasonable counterfactuals and Bayesian techniques, the first three hypotheses are dismissed, whereas the last is confirmed.

40|$|As the United States is {{predicted}} to become the world’s largest wine consuming nation by 2008 with consumers purchasing across all price segments, one might assume that Californian wineries should thrive in this market. However, regulations and consolidation effects often prevent small wineries {{from being able to}} reach the U. S. consumer and they face similar problems with exporting. These wineries must seek specialty distributors that represent lesser-known brands, usually by attending trade shows at great expense. In turn, specialty distributors face the daunting challenge of finding wineries that best satisfy their portfolios’ needs. Given this problematic situation, can one provide assistance to these parties in their quest for finding appropriate partners? While this question no doubt has many positive answers, the approach we have chosen to explore is to develop a web-based matching program. We ask wineries and distributors to submit their respective attributes and their needs via a web questionnaire. Operations research methodology is then used to algorithmically determine the most promising partnerships, subject to mutual fit and based on constraints of supply, demand and avoidance of conflicting matches. We summarize the results obtained from the initial iteration of the program, a pre-qualification service created for the World Wine Market, a San Francisco trade show in 2004. We provide some of the participant feedback, including testimonials from parties that were successfully matched through the program. We also analyze the results to determine why the program did not recommend a greater number of matches and used this information and other feedback to assist {{in the development of the}} next program iteration While the conceptual contribution of our research is in providing the first documented application of “assignment problems” to model the optimal placement of wines into the <b>distribution</b> <b>tier,</b> this paper focuses instead on the potential practitioner contributions to the wine industry. A functional web based matching program could provide many small wineries with a means to expand their representation into additional markets domestically and internationally. Even if only a small fraction of the recommended matches take place, the business return from participation has enormous potential. We discuss the current improvements, which being funded through a Business and International Education Grant from the U. S. Department of Education. We conclude with ideas for future research, including extending this program to a broader range of participants. Wineries, Distributors, Exports, Matching, Optimization...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Peer to Peer (P 2 P) flows {{constitute}} {{a large portion}} of Internet traffic meandering through different ISP domains. Hence, it is of prime concern for ISPs to try and gauge the number of active P 2 P users and where they are located, both inside and outside their respective domains. An analysis of where P 2 P users are located in the Internet provides an insight into understanding which ISPs harbor a majority of P 2 P peers, which ones afford most transit to P 2 P flows, and possibly which ISPs should focus on anti-P 2 P policies the most. We observe an extremely skewed distribution, approximately 92 to 98 % of P 2 P flows ending in tier 1 and tier 4 ISPs, and just 2 to 8 % ending in tier 2 and 3 ISPs. We quantify the role of ISPs in allowing P 2 P flows to traverse through their domains and observe a similar skewed <b>distribution</b> wherein <b>tier</b> 1 and tier 4 ISPs contribute 92 to 95 % of all hops on most P 2 P flows. Moreover, we compare P 2 P traffic wit...|$|R
40|$|Enterprises may use a service-oriented {{architecture}} (SOA) {{to provide a}} streamlined interface to their business processes. To scale up the system, each tier in a composite service usually deploys multiple servers for load distribution and fault tolerance. Such load distribution across multiple servers within the same tier {{can be viewed as}} horizontal load distribution. One limitation of this approach is that load cannot be further distributed when all servers in the same tier are fully loaded. In complex multi-tiered systems, a single business process may actually be implemented by multiple different computation pathways among the tiers, each with different components, in order to provide resiliency and scalability. Such SOA-based enterprise computing with multiple implementation options gives opportunities for vertical load <b>distribution</b> across <b>tiers.</b> In this paper, we propose a requestrouting framework for SOA-based enterprise computing that takes into consideration both horizontal and vertical load distribution. Through experimentation we show that our algorithm and methodology scale well up to a large system configuration comprising up to 1000 workflow requests to a complex composite service with multiple implementations. We also show that a combination of both horizontal and vertical load distributions gives the maximum flexibility to improve performance and fault tolerance. 1...|$|R

40|$|Ph. D. South Africa is {{the highest}} produce-producing and {{therefore}} the highest pesticide consumer on the African continent. Although greatly beneficial to the industry, indiscriminate and over usage of these agrochemicals pose a risk to the aquatic ecosystems through non-point source pollution. Data on these risks are limited in the developing countries such as Africa since limited environmental monitoring of pesticides is undertaken. This is due to technical, logistical and economical constraints in determining the links between exposure and effect on non-target organisms. Methods {{that are able to}} screen for and monitor pesticides that could pose a risk according to site-specific scenarios are therefore necessary. Economical and easy-to-use predictive models incorporated into Preliminary Risk Assessments (PRA’s) are useful in this regard and have been developed and applied globally to assist in estimating the probability of risks of pesticides associated with aquatic ecosystems. Currently no such risk assessment model is applied in South Africa for this purpose. The main aim {{of the present study was}} to present and assess the suitability of selected PRA models as preliminary screening tools for estimating potential pesticide exposure and associated effects within aquatic ecosystems. To achieve this, the primary objectives were to apply and validate these models for assessing predicted risks and to relate these to actual ecological hazards by monitoring the exposure and effects of selected pesticides that were identified as potentially posing a risk. It was hypothesised that the data determined by these models would elucidate the association between potential risks of pesticides and actual environmental impacts and could therefore be applied and validated for South African conditions. A framework was thus developed using multidisciplinary approaches to predict the risks of agricultural pesticides to non-target aquatic organisms and to validate these risks in an area known to have a high pesticide usage, namely the Crocodile (west) Marico catchment. This area is representative of a typical farming community in the subtropical central area of South Africa. It is a catchment area that exhibits high urban and agricultural usage, which has compromised the overall ecological integrity of the aquatic systems. The focus of the study was on the Crocodile (west) and Magalies Rivers and the associated irrigation canal network systems. The present study was based on integrating multidisciplinary techniques following the implementation of a tiered approach for assessing the ecological risks of selected pesticides known to be used within the Crocodile (west) Marico catchment. Tier 1 starts with the PRA assuming a relatively worst-case scenario by identifying pesticides most commonly used (through surveys) and estimating exposures posing a potential risk to the aquatic environment using the PRIMET (Pesticide Risks In the tropics to Man, Environment and Trade) model. The second tier can establish a more realistic characterisation of risk for the pesticide application scenarios of interest by using models such as PERPEST (Predicting the Ecological Risks of PESTicides), PEARL (Pesticide Emission Assessment of Regional and Local Scales), TOXSWA (TOXic substances in Surface Waters), or SSDs (Species Sensitivity <b>Distributions).</b> Higher <b>tiers</b> then include comparing the results from the PRA model predictions to the actual hazards of pesticides and can determine if these risk models are valid under South Africa conditions. This can be achieved using a combination of laboratory- and field-based monitoring assessments in the form of a triad approach (using chemical, toxicological and ecological assessments) to construct several lines-of-evidence (LoEs). The risk assessment process ends with a summary and integration of the data based on the multiple LoEs gathered during monitoring using a weight-of-evidence (WoE) approach...|$|R
