40|$|Abstract There {{has been}} a lack of {{consistency}} in detecting chromosomal loci that are linked to obesity-related traits. This may be due, in part, to the phenotype definition. Many studies use a one-time, single measurement as a phenotype while one's weight often fluctuates considerably throughout adulthood. Longitudinal data from the Framingham Heart Study were used to derive alternative phenotypes {{that may lead to}} more consistent findings. Body mass index (BMI), a measurement for obesity, is known to increase with age and then plateau or decline slightly; the decline phase may represent a threshold or survivor effect. We propose to use the weight gain phase of BMI to derive phenotypes useful for linkage analysis of obesity. Two phenotypes considered in the present study are the average of and the slope of the BMI measurements in the gain phase (gain mean and <b>gain</b> <b>slope).</b> For comparison, we also considered the average of all BMI measurements available (overall mean). Linkage analysis using the gain mean phenotype exhibited two markers with LOD scores greater than 3, with the largest score of 3. 52 on chromosome 4 at ATA 2 A 03. In contrast, no LOD scores greater than 3 were observed when overall mean was used. The <b>gain</b> <b>slope</b> produced weak evidence for linkage on chromosome 4 with a multipoint LOD score of 1. 77 at GATA 8 A 05. Our analysis shows how omitting the decline phase of BMI in the definition of obesity phenotypes can result in evidence for linkage which might have been otherwise overlooked. </p...|$|E

40|$|Few {{studies of}} {{associations}} between weight loss or weight fluctuations and mortality have been sufficiently long term to permit exclusion of early deaths for {{a portion of}} follow-up long enough to eliminate likely effects of illness-related weight loss. This study examined associations of the variation (standard deviation and standard deviation about the trend (slope)) and trend (weight loss or weight gain) in body mass index (weight (kg) /height (m 2) between 1958 and 1966 (minimum of five measurements) with subsequent 25 -year mortality among 1, 281 men originally aged 40 – 56 years from the Chicago Western Electric Company Study. In multivariate Cox regression models that included two slope variables representing weight loss and weight gain and each variability measure separately, weight loss and weight gain were significantly related to 15 -year mortality but weight variability was not. Relative risks for cardiovascular disease mortality were 1. 25 (95 % confidence interval (CI) : 1. 09, 1. 45) and 1. 14 (95 % CI: 0. 97, 1. 33), respectively, for weight loss and weight <b>gain</b> <b>slopes</b> larger by 0. 12 kg/m 2 per year; corresponding relative risks for all-cause mortality were 1. 23 (95 % CI: 1. 10, 1. 38) and 1. 15 (95 % CI: 1. 03, 1. 29), respectively. For follow-up years 16 – 25, none of these weight variables were significantly related to mortality. These results indicate that an association between weight loss and mortality may not persist beyond 15 years, and that weight variability may not be related to mortality independently of weight loss or weight gain.

40|$|Abstract: In an {{interferometer}} with {{a digital}} correlator, sensitivity will be reduced by receiver and IF bandpass slopes. Numerical calculations {{have been carried out}} to estimate these losses for developing a flatness specification for the ALMA receivers and IF system. For the 3 -level digitizer studied here a 2 -dB slope across the band gives an efficiency reduction of about 4 % in the frequency channels where the gain is least. There is also an increase of efficiency of a similar magnitude in the high-gain channels. For continuum observations the channels are weighted according to the channel signal-to-noise and averaged, resulting in an efficiency reduction of ~ 1 %. From these considerations it should be acceptable to have a <b>gain</b> <b>slope</b> of ~ 2 dB across the digitizer input bandwidth.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{predictability}} of load magnitude on anticipatory and triggered grip-force adjustments were studied as nine normal subjects used a precision grip to lift, hold, and replace an instrumented test object. Experience with a predictable stimulus {{has been shown}} to enhance magnitude scaling of triggered postural responses to different amplitudes of perturbations. However, this phenomenon, known as a central-set effect, has not been tested systematically for grip-force responses in the hand. In our study, predictability was manipulated by applying load perturbations of different magnitudes to the test object under conditions in which the upcoming load magnitude was presented repeatedly or under conditions in which the load magnitudes were presented randomly, each with two different pre-load grip conditions (unconstrained and constrained). In constrained conditions, initial grip forces were maintained near the minimum level necessary to prevent pre-loaded object slippage, while in unconstrained conditions, no initial grip force restrictions were imposed. The effect of predictable (blocked) and unpredictable (random) load presentations on scaling of anticipatory and triggered grip responses was tested by comparing the slopes of linear regressions between the imposed load and grip response magnitude. Anticipatory and triggered grip force responses were scaled to load magnitude in all conditions. However, regardless of pre-load grip force constraint, the <b>gains</b> (<b>slopes)</b> of grip responses relative to load magnitudes were greater when the magnitude of the upcoming load was predictable than when the load increase was unpredictable. In addition, a central-set effect was evidenced by the fewer number of drop trials in the predictable relative to unpredictable load conditions. Pre-load grip forces showed the greatest set effects. However, grip responses showed larger set effects, based on prediction, when pre-load grip force was constrained to lower levels. These results suggest that anticipatory processes pertaining to load magnitude permit the response gain of both voluntary and triggered rapid grip force adjustments to be set, at least partially, prior to perturbation onset. Comparison of anticipatory set effects for reactive torque and lower extremity EMG postural responses triggered by surface translation perturbations suggests a more general rule governing anticipatory processes...|$|R
