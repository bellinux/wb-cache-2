40|$|In {{this thesis}} it was {{hypothesised}} that that hens {{are capable of}} finding and utilising {{a considerable amount of}} feed items from a <b>forage</b> <b>area,</b> and this is dependent on the type of supplementary feed and forage vegetation offered. It was found that high-producing layer strains are able to consume considerable amounts of herbage and that forage together with other feed items from the <b>forage</b> <b>area</b> can provide laying hens with important nutrients. The type of supplementary (layer feed versus whole wheat and oyster shells) and the type of forage have an influence on the feed intake from the <b>forage</b> <b>area.</b> Thus, nutrient-restricted hens had a higher intake of herbage and a different preference for other feed items compared with hens, which had their nutrient requirement covered through the layer feed. Recordings on egg quality and productivity indicate that chicory is a particular valuable forage crop in a forage-based system. Also focus on earthworms has potential. It was concluded {{that it is possible to}} lower the standards of important nutrients in the supplementary feed, provided that good forage is available and that the production system supports good welfare of the poultry.

40|$|This study {{examines}} harvesting systems and presents conclusions on selection of machines for harvesting silage for dairy cows. Achieving {{a high quality}} cut of forage requires a high machine capacity and harvesting {{must be carried out}} at the optimal time with respect to plant growth stage. Therefore calculation of timeliness costs, which are determined by the time and capacity of harvesting, formed {{an important part of the}} study. These calculations require timeliness factors that describe the losses for each day by which harvest is delayed after the date of maximum economic crop value. The timeliness factors were calculated for each cut from data on changes in yield and quality of cuts during the harvest period. Harvesting cost calculations were based on a precision chop forage trailer, a precision chop forage harvester with separate transport trailers and a round baler with integral wrapping. Cost calculations were carried out for three different sizes of machine chain (small (S), medium (M) and large (L)) for each harvest system. The operations included were mowingconditioning, harvesting in the field, transport to storage and loading and packing into a bunker silo. Harvesting costs included the cost of machines, labour and timeliness. In addition, ensiling costs such as bale plastic and the investment, interest and maintenance cost for the bunker silo or the storage area for round bales were included when comparing the harvesting systems. Calculations were made for a three-cut system in conventional (CONV) and organic (ORG) forage production in southern Sweden (Gss) and central Sweden (Ss). When timeliness costs were not considered there was a risk of too low a harvest capacity being chosen. The effect of including timeliness costs when calculating harvesting costs increased with the <b>forage</b> <b>area</b> harvested, since a larger <b>forage</b> <b>area</b> increased the duration of harvest. Table S 1 shows harvesting and ensiling costs with 1 km transport distance for 70 hectares of forage in conventional production and 90 hectares in organic production in central Sweden. At short transport distances (1 km), the precision chop forage trailer and the precision chop forage harvester with separate transport trailers had similar harvesting and ensiling costs, while those for round baling were somewhat higher. The precision chop forage harvester with 2 or 3 transport trailers resulted in the lowest costs at 2 - 7 km transport distance. At longer transport distances (> 7 km), the round baler was the cheapest of the harvesting systems studied here. As regards machine capacity, it is clear from Figure S 1 that to minimise harvesting costs the smallest machine chain should be used for forage areas less than 60 ha, whereas when the <b>forage</b> <b>area</b> exceeds 90 ha the largest machine chain should be chosen. In the 60 - 90 ha <b>forage</b> <b>area</b> range, there was little difference in costs between the S, M and L machine chains. For harvest with round bales only the size of the mower-conditioner varied between the machine chains and the largest machine chain had the lowest harvest costs for all forage areas. Machine cooperatives are a good way to lower harvesting costs since for smaller forage areas in particular, increased annual use of the machines decreases the machine costs and allows larger machines to be used to greater capacity. To avoid high timeliness costs it is important that cuts are performed at the optimal time...|$|E

40|$|As {{the spatial}} {{distribution}} of marine organisms is often affected by seasonal changes, pelagic seabirds may change their <b>foraging</b> <b>areas</b> in response to seasonal changes in the marine environment. Here, we examined the <b>foraging</b> <b>area</b> of streaked shearwaters Calonectris leucomelas, breeding at Sangan (SA) and Mikura Islands (MK), Japan, from spring to summer during pre-laying and incubation periods. Those colonies are located at {{the north and south}} of the Northwestern Pacific’s Kuroshio-Oyashio transition area where high seasonal temperature changes are observed, and where, consequently, birds may show comparable responses to such changes. Our results showed that streaked shearwaters from both colonies shifted their <b>foraging</b> <b>areas</b> northwards as the season progressed. The seasonal shift of <b>foraging</b> <b>areas</b> appeared to coincide with the movement pattern of pelagic fishes that migrate northward in association with the increase in water temperature. However, the pattern of seasonal movement differed between the 2 colonies; shearwaters from SA moved their <b>foraging</b> <b>area</b> along the coastal area of the Kuroshio-Oyashio transition, while those from MK moved along the Kuroshio Extension. Our results also indicated sex-related differences in this general pattern: females showed clear seasonal changes in <b>foraging</b> <b>area,</b> while males did not. During the pre-laying period males returned to the colony frequently to defend their nests or mates, and spent less time at sea.

40|$|Glacial {{lakes in}} the {{northern}} portion of the Midwest United States are complex ecosystems with several distinct habitat types. Littoral habitat features provide important refuge and <b>forage</b> <b>area</b> for juvenile fish, and thereby may impact distributions, growth and diet selection of young fish. Simultaneously, lake-scale habitat features may structure overall system productivity and affect various population metrics of juvenile fish. Due to the interaction among lake-scale and local nearshore habitat features, {{it is difficult to}} interpret which scale and which particular habitat features most strongly influence population metrics of young fish. We conducted a field study exploring the influence of both nearshore and lake-scale habitat features on juvenile largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) and bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) population metrics. We further examined mechanisms structuring habitat selection in juveniles of these species by developing and applying an individual-based eco-genetic model. We documented that local nearshore habitat features most strongly influence distributions of both species, while lake-scale variables most strongly influence size structure. Size of juvenile largemouth bass strongly influenced diet of this species, but nearshore scale habitat variables also influenced diet metrics of juvenile largemouth bass. Finally, simulation results indicate that juvenile largemouth bass and bluegill select habitat differentially and that vegetation characteristics could influence how juvenile fish select habitat. We suggest that our utilization of two very different strategies to describe juvenile fish populations provides a unique perspective on dynamics of these two species. ...|$|E

The present study, based on micro-simulations on the farm level, shows impacts of various policy options (ranging from non-accession to the granting of full direct payments) on the production structure and profitability of Hungarian agricultural enterprises. For most products prices are expected to be higher in 2004 than in the reference year, 2001. EU accession will have an additional positive effect on the prices of all products. Direct payments would further increase farm profits. In particular crop producers would benefit (due to the increase in the price of corn) while profits in animal production would be affected in a negative way due to increased opportunity costs of <b>forage</b> <b>area</b> and higher labour cost. The presented figures are based on data collected in 14 typical model farms selected from the Hungarian Farm Accountancy Data Network and they cannot be regarded perfectly representative.

40|$|Attainment of {{acceptable}} levels {{of land and}} labor productivity and low external input use is not a mutually exclusive proposition. This study examines characteristics {{of a range of}} current specialized dairy farming systems (DFS) and mixed (crop-livestock) farming systems (MFS) in Cuba to determine their efficiency in the process of food and feed production. The central question was whether the favorable results of MFS realized in a small-scale experimental system were also attainable in larger, commercial farms. To this end, we collected data on 93 farms from around the country for a period of 1 year. The farms were classified according to four predictor variables: farm type, years since conversion from DFS to MFS, proportion of land allocated to crops in rotation and farm size. Farms were compared based on 12 pre-selected Agro-Ecological Indicators (AEIs) by using analysis of variance and Tukey's HSD tests. The 12 AEIs were also subjected to a principal components analysis and related to the four predictor variables by reduced-rank regression, also known as redundancy analysis. Three farm types were distinguished: mixed farming experimental (MFe), mixed farming commercial (MFc) and specialized dairy farming (DFS). Total energy output per unit of farm area was on average four to six times higher on the mixed farms than on the specialized dairy farms, while protein output three to four times higher. Milk yield per unit of <b>forage</b> <b>area</b> was highest on MFe (2. 4 Mg ha- 1 yr- 1), followed by MFc (1. 7), while it was much lower (0. 7) on DFS.

Detailed observations were made on the foraging behaviour during this period and the food supply of two colonies was experimentally altered by food supplementation and food denial through grease-banding of trees within a 50 m by 50 m area centred on the nest. The <b>foraging</b> <b>areas</b> of F. rufa colonies were determined by observing trails to trees and showed seasonal variation. The size of the <b>foraging</b> <b>areas,</b> their tree composition, the mean distance travelled by foragers {{and the extent to which}} particular trees were repeatedly foraged were monitored. There was stability in <b>foraging</b> <b>areas</b> between years due to colony persistence. Food supplementation did not alter the <b>foraging</b> <b>area</b> of the nest. There was some evidence that the extra resources were channelled into producing more sexuals. Food denial caused the denied nest to expand its <b>foraging</b> <b>area.</b> The amount of honeydew collected by F. rufa was experimentally determined. The amount of prey taken was estimated from a survey of the literature. The proportion of net primary productivity moved by a F. rufa colony across its <b>foraging</b> <b>area</b> was estimated as 0. 12 % to 0. 47 %. The effects of the distribution of F. rufa on other ground living invertebrates was experimentally investigated.

Milk from two groups of farms that mainly differ in their level of intensification of dairy cow and <b>forage</b> <b>area</b> management was processed into cheese in the same Cantal dairy plant, during 4 periods of 3 consecutive days each. The milk chemical composition differed little between the two producing groups whereas the differences were greater between the processing periods because of the combined effects of the season, the mean lactation stage of the herds and cow feeding. Major chemical and microbiological differences were noted in ripened cheeses according to the cheesemaking period, especially between cheeses made in the winter and in the summer. The cheesemaking period and ripening time (6, 13 and 23 weeks) accounted for most of the variance noted in all the sensory characteristics of the cheeses, whereas the production system had a far lesser impact. With regards to odour and aroma, the spring and winter cheeses differed from the autumn and summer ones. With time, the cheeses became softer and melted more and tasted saltier and more pungent. The stronger characteristics were enhanced whereas milder flavours lost power, a trend that was more marked in the winter cheeses. On average, the cheeses made from the more extensive farms were more elastic and slightly less bitter and pungent. They were also characterised by their globally less intense odour and aroma characteristics.

40|$|Changes {{affecting}} {{livestock farming}} systems have made labour a central concern {{for both the}} sector and the farmers. The challenge lies in increasing labour productivity to improve work conditions. Farmers voice new work expectations particularly a demand to separate their private lives from their work as controlling working hours {{and being able to}} have free weekends and holidays. In order to provide viable livestock farming systems, work productivity and work flexibility can be analysed together. A work organization survey was carried on 15 organic sheep farms in the Massif Central region in France. The sample was characterized by different reproductions rhythms (one to three lambings/year). Routine work (work to be done every day) varied from 78 to 4343 hours/year. This variability {{can be explained by the}} number of workers, the sheep breeding and the level of equipment. 96 % of the routine work was carried out by farmers themselves. Only one farmer employed a permanent wage earner. The efficiency of the routine work was also diverse (1 to 7, 8 hours/ewe/y). It was better in large herds. The calculated time available (room for manoeuvre in time) varied from 454 to 1199 hours/farm/year. Three annual distribution of the calculated time available were identified according to the reproduction rhythm of the herd (periods of lambing) and the work with the <b>forage</b> <b>area</b> (silage, hay making). Adaptive capacities were assessed by adjustments of forms of work organization. The results highlighted diverse adaptive capacities: the stability or the constant adjustments over the year to diverse events (climatic, workforce, livestock management, etc.).

Other factors are also important: other activities on the farm (transformation, direct selling, etc.), workforce composition and level of equipment.

40|$|Musk thistle (Carduus nutans) is an {{herbaceous}} monocarpic herb {{introduced to}} the U. S. from Eurasia. The invasion of musk thistle can reduce <b>forage</b> <b>area,</b> soil stability, and reduce recreation and open areas for humans and wildlife. Resistance of warm season and cool season perennial grass communities to musk thistle invasion is important for land managers to consider, especially where disturbance has made an area particularly susceptible. Our results show that disturbances, such as overgrazing can open up niches in canopies of warm season grass communities and facilitate invasion but not in cool season grass communities. The mechanism of invasion by musk thistle may depend on an overlap in the timing of resource use patterns by the invader and perennial grass communities. Our results showed that an undisturbed (e. g., non-grazed, normal precipitation) stand of warm season perennial grasses can suppress the establishment of musk thistle by restricting the amount of light that reaches the soil surface. A disturbance of extreme drought creates more niches in warm season perennial grass communities (e. g., reduced growth), but newly germinating musk thistle plants cannot compete for the reduced amount of soil moisture. High disturbance (e. g., grazing) allowed extensive amounts of light to penetrate into overgrazed warm season perennial grass communities, which facilitated the successful invasion by musk thistle. In cool season perennial grass communities, light is less critical, regardless of soil moisture. The unsuccessful invasion of musk thistle into cool season perennial grass communities is most likely due to grass root phenology and distribution (88 m m- 2). Root growth and development and distribution patterns {{should be taken into}} account for effective perennial grass restoration in areas with high risk from invasive plant species. The ecology of musk thistle seed suggests germination is strongly influenced by temperature, light, moisture, salinity, dormancy and habitat types and should be factored into an integrated invasive plant management plan that targets early growth of musk thistle seedlings.

Here, we conducted indoor flight-cage experiments with bumble bees and found that a bee, when encountering a loss of its competitor, improved its foraging performance to a greater extent than expected from a simple relaxation of competitive pressure by increasing the size of its <b>foraging</b> <b>area.</b> Moreover, bees with better-established traplines achieved greater <b>foraging</b> <b>areas</b> after the loss of competitors, suggesting that bees do not necessarily need to “sample” neighboring patches to monitor temporal changes in environments. We discuss how periodical returns and route memory associated with accurate reward values could allow inherently conservative trapliners to make flexible adjustments, by effectively monitoring their circumstances and quickly readjusting to detected changes...|$|R

40|$|With {{increasing}} {{prices for}} energy, fertiliser and feed concentrates, {{it is becoming}} increasingly important for farmers to produce high quality feed while minimising costs. For a Swedish farm, costs for machinery make up about 25 % of the production costs. The economic consequences of performing a field operation at non-optimal time are called timeliness costs. They are caused by reductions in crop value and can be reduced by increasing machine capacity. To improve the basis for optimal selection of field machinery in agriculture, methods were developed and applied for calculation of timeliness costs in terms of crop quality and quantity losses at non-optimum operation times. Timeliness costs for grain that accounted for crop quantity and quality losses at delayed sowing and harvesting were higher per kg for organic grain than for conventional. The main differences in timeliness costs resulted from two counteracting factors – lower yields and higher product prices in organic production. Higher timeliness costs resulted in a larger combine harvester with higher capacity being economically optimal for the organic system. A method was developed for valuing forage for milk production with respect to crop yield increases and feed value decreases due to delayed time of harvesting. The results showed significantly higher timeliness cost factors in € per ha and day for the first cut compared with regrowth. Timeliness cost factors also varied greatly between years. Harvesting costs in terms of timeliness were calculated for different machinery systems and capacities. Harvesting costs decreased with increasing <b>forage</b> <b>area</b> up to a certain threshold area, beyond which decreasing machine costs were outweighed by increasing timeliness costs due to longer duration of harvest. Using machine contractors or machine cooperatives decreased harvesting costs, particularly for small forage areas, due to increased annual use of the machines. However, to avoid high timeliness costs delays in harvesting must be avoided. Forage was also valued in terms of biogas production by accounting for changes in yield and methane production with varying cutting date. Timeliness costs were small as long as harvesting was not delayed. Matching capacity to requirements is important in avoiding costly overcapacity and minimising costs...|$|E
40|$|Chantier qualité GASix {{dairy farms}} {{with the same}} on-farm area and milk {{production}} were compared. One farm (G-No) used grass as the sole forage for a herd of Normande cows, a dual-purpose breed. Three farms, with Holstein cows, varied forage for the herd from grass only (G-Ho) to low (G/LM-Ho) or high (G/HM-Ho) proportion of maize silage in the total <b>forage</b> <b>area.</b> Finally, two farms based on G/LM-Ho and G/HM-Ho systems aimed to increase omega- 3 fatty acids in the winter diets of cows (G/LM/O 3 -Ho, G/HM/O 3 -Ho). Allocation methods (biophysical, protein, economic allocation) and system expansion applied for co-product (milk and meat) handling were examined. The impact categories considered were climate change, climate change including the effects of land use and land use change (CC/LULUC), cumulative energy demand, eutrophication, acidification and land occupation. The impacts per kg of fat-and-proteincorrected milk (FPCM) of G-No were highest, followed by those of G-Ho, G/LM-Ho and G/HM-Ho, regardless co-product handling methods and impact categories (except for eutrophication). CC/LULUC per kg FPCM of G/LM/O 3 -Ho and G/HM/O 3 -Ho were both 1 % and 3 % {{lower than those of}} G/LM-Ho and G/HM-Ho, respectively, but other impacts were higher. With system expansion, impacts per kg FPCM were lower than when allocation methods were used. Enteric fermentation was the greatest contributor (45 e 50 %) to CC/LULUC, while grass production was the most important contributor to other impacts. The highest CC/LULUC (for G-No) can be explained by (1) G-No having the lowest milk yield/cow (though it produced the most meat) and (2) the fact that grass required more N fertiliser, but had lower yields than silage maize, even though grassland sequestered C. Among Holstein systems, increasing cow productivity by increasing feed intake (including maize silage and supplementing with concentrate) decreased impacts of milk. Reducing replacement rate and age of first calving also decreased impacts of milk. Increasing cow productivity reduced the amount of on-farm area required to produce a given amount of milk. Thus, the “liberated” on-farm area of Holstein systems was used to produce cash crops, and total impacts of these systems were lower than those of G-No (except for eutrophication and land occupation) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{reform of}} European Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) in 2003 has {{resulted}} in substantial changes to the attribution of subsidies to dairy farmers. Moreover, dairy farmers are in also facing an unprecedented situation on the markets with the soaring prices of agricultural raw materials: they sell their products at a higher price (milk, meat and cereals), but must also cope with the increasing prices of concentrates. In this paper 1, we discuss cross effects, on the productive strategy of French dairy farms, of the Luxemburg Agreement and the prices variations. A model based on mathematical programming has been privileged to determine how dairy farmers might re-evaluate their systems to identify optimal production plan. While respecting the principle of agent rationality (maximization of profit), the model incorporates the economic risk related to the volatility of the inputs and outputs prices. Thus the model maximises the expected utility of the income while taking into account a set of constraints: regulatory, structural, zootechnical, agronomic and environmental. The model is applied to four types of dairy farms {{to cope with the}} diversity of production systems in the west of France (“grazier” type, “semi intensive” type, “milk + cereals” type and “milk + young bulls” type). The model is used to produce quantitative estimations and support reflection through the simulation of the setting up of the Single payment scheme. The sensitivity of the results is discussed by taking into account several options of prices for cereals and livestock products. These may have a strong influence on the structure of the diet and, therefore, on the level of intensification of the <b>forage</b> <b>area.</b> The results show that the implementation of the CAP reform encourages farmers to substitute a part of corn silage by grass in the diet. However, the rising price of agricultural production encourages, on the contrary, farmers to intensify their system in order to free up land for growing cereals. We also observe that a decrease of the young bulls fattening activity to develop cereal crops is also economically profitable. dairy farm, single payment, price variation, Agricultural and Food Policy, Livestock Production/Industries,...|$|E

Coastal {{ecosystems}} are under intense pressure from anthropogenic and environmental factors in California. Human development, pollution and climate change continue to degrade coastal habitats. Marine predators such as marine mammals that depend on nearshore ecosystems are at risk from these anthropogenic and environmental factors. The Pacific harbor seal (Phoca vitulina richardsi) {{is one of the}} most common marine mammals along the coast of northern California and likely to be heavily impacted by changes in the coastal environment, yet little is known about their foraging behavior or habitat use. To accurately predict the response of local marine predators to changes in the coastal environment an understanding of their foraging behavior is required. This study aimed to develop baseline data on the foraging habitat and foraging behavior of the Pacific harbor seal in northern California. I radio tagged 12 seals from haul-out sites in Humboldt Bay, California and recorded their at-sea distribution between September 2005 and June 2006. I used fixed kernel analysis to measure the size and identify the locations of <b>foraging</b> <b>areas.</b> I characterized <b>foraging</b> behavior by measuring the distance from haul-out sites to <b>foraging</b> <b>areas,</b> the spatial overlap of <b>foraging</b> <b>areas,</b> the water depth at <b>foraging</b> <b>areas</b> and <b>foraging</b> trip duration. <b>Foraging</b> <b>area</b> size ranged from 10. 2 to 37. 4 km 2 (mean= 26. 7 ?? 3. 5 km 2, ??SE).
