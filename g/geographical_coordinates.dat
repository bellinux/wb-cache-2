Witnesses in Dharamshala, India report that the UFOs make distinctive sounds: a five-tone musical phrase in a major scale. Scientists broadcast the phrase to outer space, but are mystified by the response: a seemingly meaningless series of numbers (104 44 30 40 36 10) repeated over and over until Laughlin, with his background in cartography, recognizes it as a set of <b>geographical</b> <b>coordinates,</b> which point to Devils Tower near Moorcroft, Wyoming. Lacombe and the U.S. military converge on Wyoming. The United States Army evacuates the area, planting false reports in the media that a train wreck has spilled a toxic nerve gas, all the while preparing a secret landing zone for the UFOs and their occupants.|$|E

Lack of quality in rainfall data will influence {{the process of}} analyses and subsequently, produce misleading results. Thus, this study is aimed to propose modified missing rainfall data treatment methods that produced more accurate estimation results. In this study, the old normal ratio method and the modified normal ratio based on trimmed mean are combined with <b>geographical</b> <b>coordinate</b> method. The performances of these modified methods were tested on various levels of the missing data of 36 years complete daily rainfall records from eighteen meteorology stations in Peninsular Malaysia. The results indicated that both modified methods improved the estimation of missing rainfall values at the target station based on the least error measurements. Modified normal ratio based on trimmed mean with <b>geographical</b> <b>coordinate</b> method {{is found to be}} the most appropriate method for station Batu Kurau and Sg.

Mean while villages lack such division or table, they use the Prayer times of nearby cities.

Quantitative computation of Prayer times is dependent on <b>geographical</b> <b>coordinate</b> of that place and space/time position of Sun.
