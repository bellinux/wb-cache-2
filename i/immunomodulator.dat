25|$|The drug is also {{available}} in a dog preparation manufactured by Novartis Animal Health called Atopica. Atopica is indicated {{for the treatment of}} atopic dermatitis in dogs. Unlike the human form of the drug, the lower doses used in dogs mean the drug acts as an <b>immunomodulator</b> and has fewer side effects than in humans. The benefits of using this product include the reduced need for concurrent therapies to bring the condition under control. It is available as an ophthalmic ointment for dogs called Optimmune, manufactured by Intervet, which is part of Merck.|$|E

This article briefly reviews the pathogenesis of asthma and allergic diseases, discusses the rationale behind using <b>immunomodulators</b> in these diseases; and examines the therapeutic effects of <b>immunomodulators</b> on allergic diseases. There are a number of <b>immunomodulators</b> that have been developed for the treatment of allergic disorders. Some have looked very promising in pre-clinical trials, but have not shown significant benefits in human clinical trials thus indicating the disparity between mouse models and human asthma. This review focuses on <b>immunomodulators</b> that are in human clinical trials and not molecules in pre-clinical development...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: <b>Immunomodulators</b> are agents, {{which can}} {{modulate}} the immune response to specific antigens, while causing least toxicity {{to the host}} system. Being part of the modern vaccine formulations, these compounds have contributed remarkably {{to the field of}} therapeutics. Despite the successful record maintained by these agents, the requirement of novel <b>immunomodulators</b> keeps increasing due to the increasing severity of diseases. Hence, research regarding the same holds great importance. Areas covered: In this review, we discuss the role of <b>immunomodulators</b> in improving performance of various vaccines used for counteracting most threatening infectious diseases, mechanisms behind their action and criteria for development of novel <b>immunomodulators.</b> Expert opinion: Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying immune response is a prerequisite for development of effective therapeutics as these are often exploited by pathogens for their own propagation. Keeping this in mind, the present research in the field of immunotherapy focuses on developing <b>immunomodulators</b> that would not only enhance the protection against pathogen, but also generate a long-term memory response. With the introduction of advanced formulations including combination of different kinds of <b>immunomodulators,</b> one can expect tremendous success in near future...|$|R

40|$|Use of the <b>immunomodulators</b> thiopurines and {{methotrexate}} (MTX) in {{the treatment}} of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), i. e., Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis (UC), is considered to be good clinical practice. However, despite being administered to a considerable number of IBD patients over the years, questions remain about the most rational treatment regimens of azathioprine (AZA), 6 -mercaptopurine (6 -MP), and MTX, and results from a range of recent studies necessitate increased attention to how to optimize the use of these <b>immunomodulators.</b> First and foremost, it is of utmost importance to define the subgroup of IBD patients in need of <b>immunomodulators,</b> including those in need of combination therapy with biologic agents, especially because some side effects may be rather severe. Second, colorectal cancer is observed more often in IBD patients than in the background population. However, a recent nationwide Dutch study pointed to a preventive effect of thiopurines. Finally, the need for an appropriate approach to the discontinuation of <b>immunomodulators</b> is emphasized. Since controversy continues regarding the most appropriate use of <b>immunomodulators,</b> this paper is focusing on pharmacokinetics, pharmacogenetics, and therapeutic blood testing, as well as the occurrence of adverse events, when using AZA, 6 -MP, and MTX in an attempt to determine a more up-to-date and rational treatment regimen in IBD...|$|R
