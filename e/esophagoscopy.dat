50|$|ROTIGS is a transoral {{appliance}} {{that facilitates}} awake transoral bronchoscopic intubation, laryngoscopy, bronchoscopy, and <b>esophagoscopy.</b> Rotigs {{consists of a}} mouthpiece, bite block, and guidance tube. The mouthpiece and integral bite block keeps the device centered and allows a midline bronchoscopic approach to the larynx. The device does not rest on the tongue and does not cause gagging. By creating a gag free approach to the larynx, ROTIGS facilitates safe, awake, guided transoral intubation for the infrequent endoscopist.|$|E
50|$|Stable {{patients}} will be evaluated with CT, ultrasound, {{chest x ray}} as the institution's protocol specifies. When this initial survey is negative, patient can be observed with conservative management. In many cases, chest tubes are required due to concomitant lesions in the pleural cavity. If possible lesions are found (for example, a missile track near the trachea or esophagus, or pneumomediastinum) further investigation will follow with oesophagography, <b>esophagoscopy,</b> angiography, bronchoscopy as needed to rule out or confirm such a lesion, and decide whether surgical repair is warranted.|$|E
50|$|Transnasal <b>esophagoscopy</b> is {{an office}} based {{procedure}} {{in which the}} patient is anesthetized locally in the nose and sometimes the oropharynx. The scope is advanced into the ipsilateral pyriform sinus and through the esophageal inlet to the stomach, where the esophagus can be examined, with special attention paid to the gastroesophageal (GE) junction. An advantage of TNE over other more invasive cancer screening methods that require conscious sedation {{is that it can}} be performed using topical anesthesia alone with the patient sitting upright in an exam chair unencumbered by cardiac monitoring equipment.|$|E
50|$|Jonathan E. Aviv (Jon- ah- than Ah-veev; born August 24, 1960) is an American otolaryngologist-head {{and neck}} surgeon and a {{professor}} {{of otolaryngology-head and neck surgery}} at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City, New York. He is also Clinical Director of the Voice and Swallowing Center at ENT and Allergy Associates in New York City, New York.An inventor, author, educator, physician and surgeon, he is best known for his invention of Flexible Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing with Sensory Testing (FEESST), a medical device that allows office-based assessment of oropharyngeal dysphagia, or swallowing disorders, without the use of X-ray. He is also known for his development of Transnasal <b>Esophagoscopy</b> (TNE), a method of examining the esophagus without using conscious or intravenous sedation. From 1991 to 2009, he was a full-time academic surgeon and director of the division of head and neck surgery at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons.|$|E
5000|$|Previously every stable {{patient that}} {{suffered}} a TMGSW received extensive evaluation that included chest radiography, oesophagography, <b>esophagoscopy,</b> angiography, bronchoscopy, cardiac ultrasound. Grossman et al. {{found evidence that}} the trajectory of the bullet can be delineated {{with the use of}} Computed Tomographic Scan (CT). Subsequently other studies demonstrated the use of CT as a screening tool for stable patients who suffered TMGSW is a reliable tool for ruling out, diagnosing and avoiding missed injuries. For example Stassen et al. showed data of 22 stable patients who were screened with CT, chest x ray and abdominal ultrasound; seven patients showed a positive CT scan and required additional evaluation, and of these seven patients, three required surgical management. Additionally the work of Burack et al., whose evaluation of stable patients with penetrating injuries to the mediastinum — this time including stab wounds — relied mostly on CT and ultrasound, showed similar results. The work of Ibirogba et al. did so as well. Recent data suggests that the use of CT scan with some additional noninvasive techniques, such as ultrasound and chest roentgenogram are reliable screening tools to decide whether patients need further evaluation.|$|E

5000|$|Transnasal <b>esophagoscopy</b> (TNE) is a {{safe and}} {{inexpensive}} way to examine the esophagus in patients at risk for esophageal cancer and other disorders. TNE doesn’t require sedation, unlike other techniques widely used {{to look into the}} esophagus. This is possible because TNE uses a camera that is passed through the nose, whereas other techniques, such as upper endoscopy, are performed through the mouth, requiring a patient to be sedated. TNE, as it is used today, was developed by Jonathan E. Aviv who published his findings on the first series of TNE that he performed. [...] The origins of the idea to pass the camera through the nose date from 1993 as first described by C. A. Prescott, MD, a pediatrician otolaryngologist in Cape Town, South Africa [...] and further embellished by Reza Shaker, MD, a gastroenterologist in Milwaukee, WI in 1994. However, it wasn't until the year 2000 when Jonathan E. Aviv, MD, published his findings on the first series of TNE he performed, that it began to have a widespread attention by ear, nose, and throat doctors. Since that time it has been used by both otolaryngologists and gastroenterologists as a diagnostic tool to detect globus, dysphagia, laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR), gastroesophageal reﬂux disease (GERD). TNE may also be useful in detecting Barrett's, but there is incongruence between TNE findings and biopsy results. Experts in the field suggest that TNE may replace radiographic imaging of the esophagus in otolaryngology patients with reflux, globus, and dysphagia.|$|E

This retrospective study analyzed patient’s chart whose underwent <b>esophagoscopy</b> for removing the impacted dental prosthesis in Dr. Cipto Mangunkusumo General Hospital, Jakarta, Indonesia during a period between January 1997 and December 2003. Neck-chest X-ray and <b>esophagoscopy</b> were performed in all patients to identify the existence of the dental prosthesis as a diagnostic and treatment procedure. The length of time for removing the dental prosthesis was recorded and stated as a less difficult <b>esophagoscopy</b> when it takes time less than 60 minutes and as a difficult  esophagoscopy takes 60 minutes or longer. Some risk difficulties factors were statistically analyzed. There were 53 patients of ingested dental prosthesis in esophagus.

40|$|PURPOSE Gastroesophageal reflux {{disease is}} common and with {{time may be}} {{complicated}} by Barrett’s esophagus and esophageal adenocarcinoma. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, including <b>esophagoscopy,</b> is the procedure of choice to diagnose Barrett’s esophagus and other esophageal disease. The use of unsedated ultrathin <b>esophagoscopy</b> (UUE) has been reported by gastroenterologists in specialized endoscopy units and otolaryngologists in outpatient otolaryngology offices, but UUE has not been previously described in a primary care setting.

40|$|A case of {{internal}} carotid artery dissection that developed after rigid <b>esophagoscopy</b> is described. The diagnosis was suggested by the clinical presentation and confirmed by the findings of radiological examinations. Internal carotid artery dissection is a rare condition of controversial etiology. Most frequently, the cause is unknown and the condition is termed idiopathic. A few cases have occurred after forceful cervical extensions and manipulations. The pathogenesis in our case is uncertain: while the rigid <b>esophagoscopy</b> is the most probable cause, the intubation and spontaneous carotid artery dissection cannot be ruled out...|$|E
40|$|A {{prospective}} study {{was performed on}} 45 patients for {{an assessment of the}} use of computed tomography (CT) in the manage-ment of a suspected esophageal fish bone or chicken bone. All patients had negative findings on laryngoscopy; therefore, pharyngeal and hypopharyngeal foreign bodies were excluded from further consideration. The patients underwent radiographie examination with plain films and a cervical CT scan without contrast material. Patients with positive findings were taken to the operating room, where they underwent rigid <b>esophagoscopy</b> under general anesthesia, while those with negative findings remained for observation for 24 hours. Thirty CT scans were positive for an esophageal foreign body, and in all cases but 1, a foreign body was found during the operation. Fourteen of 15 patients with normal CT scan findings managed well with no further intervention. One patient with persistent complaints underwent <b>esophagoscopy,</b> but no foreign body was found. Our conclusion is therefore that CT is a simple and reliable method for diagnosing esophageal bone impaction and may reduce the rate of unnecessary esophagoscopies.

40|$|Objective. To {{evaluate}} {{the use of}} flexible <b>esophagoscopy</b> and chromoendoscopy with Lugol’s solution in the detection of early esophageal carcinomas (second primary carcinomas) in patients with squamous cell carcinoma {{of the head and}} neck (HNSCC). Methods. All patients with newly diagnosed HNSCC underwent office-based Lugol's chromoendoscopy. After flexible <b>esophagoscopy</b> with white light, 3. 0 % Lugol's iodine solution was sprayed over the entire esophageal mucosa. Areas with less-intense staining (LVLs) were evaluated and biopsies taken. Results. 132 patients with HNSCC were enrolled in this study. The most frequent primary tumors were oropharyngeal (49 / 132), tumors of the oral cavity (36 / 132), and larynx (35 / 132). The majority of subjects (107 / 132 patients, 81. 1 %) had advanced HNSCC carcinomas (stages III and IV). Multiple LVLs were discovered in 24 subjects (18. 2 %) and no LVLs in 108 (81. 8 %) subjects. Fifty-five LVL biopsy specimens were obtained and assessed. Squamous cell carcinomas were detected in two patients, peptic esophagitis in 11 patients, gastric heterotopic mucosa in two patients, hyperplasia in two patients, and low- and high-grade dysplasia in three patients. Conclusion. Although only two patients with synchronous primary carcinomas were found among the patients, <b>esophagoscopy</b> should be recommended after detection of HNSCC to exclude secondary esophageal carcinoma or dysplasia...|$|E
40|$|Aim: Foreign body {{aspiration}} and ingestion {{foreign body}} is usually seen in childhood but can occur at any age. When {{the diagnosis of}} foreign bodies are delayed, this may lead important complications. Complet or partial obstruction of the main bronchial system produces different findings. Death may occur if emergency treatment is not given. The nine interesting foreign body aspiration and ingestion cases in our clinic were evaluated. Material and Method: In our study, 9 foreign bodys aspiration and ingestion cases were treated with interesting clinical and radiological findings were reviewed for the last 1. 5 years. The distribution of age of the patients ranged from 9 months- 54 years. 5 male patients, 4 were female. The period between aspiration and ingestion and treatment varied from 1. 5 hour and 20 years. Results: All patients underwent broncoscopy or <b>esophagoscopy.</b> In five cases broncoscopy or <b>esophagoscopy</b> were insufficient and thoracotomy or VATS was performed. In all cases, foreign bodies were removed. Mortality was not observed. Discussion: The definite diagnosis of foreign body aspiration and ingestion is confirmed by <b>esophagoscopy</b> or broncoscopy.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Diagnostic and {{therapeutic}} office-based procedures under topical anesthesia are {{emerging in the}} daily practice of laryngologists and head and neck surgeons. Since {{the introduction of the}} transnasal esophagoscope, office-based procedures for the esophagus are increasingly performed. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of literature on office-based procedures under topical anesthesia for the esophagus. RESULTS: Transnasal <b>esophagoscopy</b> is an extensively investigated office-based procedure. This procedure shows better patient tolerability and equivalent accuracy compared to conventional transoral <b>esophagoscopy,</b> as well as time and cost savings. Secondary tracheoesophageal puncture, esophageal dilatation, esophageal sphincter injection, and foreign body removal are less investigated, but show promising results. DISCUSSION: With the introduction of the transnasal esophagoscope, an increasing number of diagnostic {{and therapeutic}} office-based procedures for the esophagus are possible, with multiple advantages. Further investigation must prove the clinical feasibility and effectiveness of the therapeutic office-based procedures...|$|E

40|$|Objective: <b>Esophagoscopy</b> and/or {{barium swallow}} are {{routinely}} {{performed in the}} evaluation of patients with mucosal head and neck malignancies. Whether this intervention is efficient or cost-effective is questioned in our multidisciplinary head and neck tumor clinic. Our study objective is to find the yield provided by <b>esophagoscopy</b> and barium swallow, and the incidence of second primary cancers. Study Design: Retrospective case series. Methods: A retrospective chart review was done on patients treated at our institution for squamous cell carcinomas {{of the head and neck}} over a period of 8 years. The records of five hundred and ninety-four patients were analyzed to determine the method by which the cancer was diagnosed, the association with a particular region of the primary cancer, and the incidence of risk-increasing behavior. Results: Five patients (0. 84 %) were found to have a second neoplasm of the esophagus. Of these, three patients (0. 5 %) had metachronous and two (0. 34 %) had a synchronous lesion. Three were diagnosed with barium swallow and two during routine endoscopy. The primary tumors were of the oral cavity in three patients and of the glottis and/or hypopharynx in two patients. All patients had a history of tobacco or alcohol abuse. Conclusion: The incidence of a second cancer of the esophagus in head and neck cancer patients was low. <b>Esophagoscopy</b> and barium swallow are safe and reliable methods to detect an esophageal lesion...|$|E
