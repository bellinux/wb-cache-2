Aristotle however predicted that his system would cause lung oscillation (breathing), which is possible given extra assumptions such as of delays or non-linear responses.|$|E
5|$|Thermals {{begin as}} bubbles of rising air that are formed {{on the ground}} through the warming of the surface by sunlight. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> {{contains}} enough moisture, the water will condense from the rising air and form cumulus clouds.|$|E

5|$|The {{simplest}} classification is that involving air masses. The Bergeron classification is {{the most}} widely accepted form of air mass classification. Air mass classification involves three letters. The first letter describes its moisture properties, with c used for continental air masses (dry) and m for maritime air masses (moist). The second letter describes the thermal characteristic of its source region: T for tropical, P for polar, A for Arctic or Antarctic, M for monsoon, E for equatorial, and S for superior air (dry air formed by significant downward motion in the atmosphere). The third letter is used to designate {{the stability of the}} atmosphere. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> mass is colder than the ground below it, it is labeled k. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> mass is warmer than the ground below it, it is labeled w. While air mass identification was originally used in weather forecasting during the 1950s, climatologists began to establish synoptic climatologies based on this idea in 1973.|$|E
5|$|The {{preferred}} {{habitat of}} the common house martin is open country with low vegetation, such as pasture, meadows and farmland, and preferably near water, although it {{is also found in}} mountains up to at least 2,200metres (7,200ft) altitude. As its name implies, it readily nests on man-made buildings, and will breed even in city centres <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> is clean enough. The other two species favour mountainous country (and sea cliffs in the case of Asian house martin); they use buildings as nest sites less frequently than their northern relative. The wintering grounds of the two migrant species include a range of open country and hilly habitats.|$|E
5|$|The left {{edge of the}} {{conveyor}} belt is sharp due to higher density air moving in from the west forcing a sharp slope to the cold front. An area of stratiform precipitation develops poleward of the warm front along {{the conveyor}} belt. Active precipitation poleward of the warm front implies potential for greater development of the cyclone. A portion of this conveyor belt turns to the right (left in the Southern Hemisphere), aligning with the upper level westerly flow. However, the western portion of this belt wraps around the northwest (southwest in the Southern Hemisphere) side of the cyclone, which can contain moderate to heavy precipitation. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> mass is cold enough, the precipitation falls {{in the form of}} heavy snow. Theory from the 1980s talked about the presence of a cold conveyor belt originating north of the warm front and flowing along a clockwise path (in the northern hemisphere) into the main belt of the westerlies aloft, but there has been conflicting evidence {{as to whether or not}} this phenomenon actually exists.|$|E

25|$|A third {{source of}} lift is wind {{circulation}} forcing air over a physical barrier {{such as a}} mountain (orographic lift). <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> is generally stable, nothing more than lenticular cap clouds will form.

25|$|One {{difference}} of air speed in every air column invariably occurs, however, near the ground/sea, also <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> density {{is the same}} anywhere and no vertical motion occurs.|$|E
25|$|The {{difference}} in pressure between {{the surface and}} the diver can be so great that <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> line is cut at the surface {{and there is no}} non-return valve, the diver would be partly squeezed into the helmet by the external pressure, and injured or possibly killed.|$|E

25|$|A problem {{mostly of}} {{historical}} interest, but still relevant to surface supplied divers who dive with the helmet sealed {{to the dry}} suit. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> supply hose is ruptured near or above the surface, the pressure difference between the water around the diver and {{the air in the}} hose can be several bar. The non-return valve at the connection to the helmet will prevent backflow if it is working correctly, but if absent, as {{in the early days of}} helmet diving, or if it fails, the pressure difference will tend to squeeze the diver into the rigid helmet, which can result in severe trauma. The same effect can result from a large and rapid increase in depth <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> supply is insufficient to keep up with the increase in ambient pressure.|$|E
25|$|UV {{has also}} been shown to reduce gaseous {{contaminants}} such as carbon monoxide and VOCs. UV lamps radiating at 184 and 254nm can remove low concentrations of hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> is recycled between the room and the lamp chamber. This arrangement prevents the introduction of ozone into the treated air. Likewise, air may be treated by passing by a single UV source operating at 184nm and passed over iron pentaoxide to remove the ozone produced by the UV lamp.|$|E
25|$|Sublimation: <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> {{movement}} in the tunnel is sufficiently non-turbulent, a particle stream released into the airflow will not break up as the air moves along, but stay together as a sharp thin line. Multiple particle streams released from a grid of many nozzles can provide a dynamic three-dimensional shape of the airflow around a body. As with the force balance, these injection pipes and nozzles need to be shaped {{in a manner that}} minimizes the introduction of turbulent airflow into the airstream.|$|E

50|$|A {{warm front}} is also {{defined as the}} {{transition}} zone where a warmer air mass is replacing a cooler air mass. Warm fronts generally move from southwest to northeast. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> warmer <b>air</b> originates over <b>the</b> ocean, {{it is not only}} warmer but also more moist than <b>the</b> <b>air</b> ahead of it.|$|R
25|$|More general airmass {{instability}} in the troposphere tends to produce clouds of the more freely convective cumulus genus type, whose species are mainly indicators of degrees of atmospheric instability and resultant vertical development of the clouds. A cumulus cloud initially forms in {{the low level of}} the troposphere as a cloudlet of the species humilis that shows only slight vertical development. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> becomes more unstable, the cloud tends to grow vertically into the species mediocris, then congestus, the tallest cumulus species which is the same type that the International Civil Aviation Organization refers to as 'towering cumulus'.|$|E
25|$|The average {{human body}} with a relaxed lungful of air is close to neutral buoyancy. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> is exhaled, most people will sink in fresh water, and with full lungs, most will float in seawater. The amount of weight {{required}} to provide neutral buoyancy to the naked diver is usually trivial, though {{there are some people}} who require several kilograms of weight to become neutral in seawater due to low average density and large size. This is usually the case with people with a large proportion of body fat. As the diver is nearly neutral, most ballasting is needed to compensate for the buoyancy of the diver's equipment.|$|E
25|$|Adiabatic cooling {{occurs when}} {{one or more}} of three {{possible}} lifting agents – cyclonic/frontal, convective, or orographic – causes air containing invisible water vapor to rise and cool to its dew point, the temperature at which the air becomes saturated. The main mechanism behind this process is adiabatic cooling. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> is cooled to its dew point and becomes saturated, it normally sheds vapor it can no longer retain, which condenses into cloud. Water vapor in saturated air is normally attracted to condensation nuclei such as dust and salt particles that are small enough to be held aloft by normal circulation of the air.|$|E

50|$|The maximum pressure, or {{how much}} <b>air</b> <b>the</b> pump can force into a tire, is an {{important}} consideration. The pump needs to match or exceed <b>the</b> stated <b>air</b> pressure <b>the</b> tires can handle. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> maximum <b>air</b> pressure is too low, {{it will not be}} able to adequately inflate the tires, no matter how hard it is used.|$|R
25|$|The {{principle}} of layering {{can be used}} to provide a wider range of insulation possibilities from a relatively small range of underwear items, however this can only be done before entering the water. Most dry suit underwear insulates by a trapped layer of air in the garment, and this is largely lost <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> is replaced by water in a flooded suit, so as a general rule, insulation is proportional to the combined thickness of the undergarments. The layering principle shows that the option of two layers of undergarment in two thicknesses allows three levels of insulation to be selected. Thin only, thick only, and both layers.|$|E
25|$|Without {{consulting}} either Army Chief of Staff Douglas MacArthur or Chief of the Air Corps Major General Benjamin Foulois, Secretary of War George H. Dern at {{a cabinet}} {{meeting on the}} morning of February 9, 1934, assured President Roosevelt that the Air Corps could deliver the mail. That same morning, shortly after conclusion of the cabinet meeting, second assistant postmaster general Harllee Branch called Foulois to his office. A conference between members of the Air Corps, the Post Office, and the Aeronautics Branch of the Commerce Department ensued in which Foulois, asked <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>Air</b> Corps could deliver the mail in winter, casually assured Branch that the Air Corps could be ready in a week or ten days.|$|E
25|$|In a {{wet cooling}} tower (or open circuit cooling tower), the warm water can be cooled to a {{temperature}} lower than the ambient air dry-bulb temperature, <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> is relatively dry (see dew point and psychrometrics). As ambient air is drawn past a flow of water, {{a small portion of}} the water evaporates, and the energy required to evaporate that portion of the water is taken from the remaining mass of water, thus reducing its temperature. Approximately 970 BTU of heat energy is absorbed for each pound of evaporated water (2 MJ/kg). Evaporation results in saturated air conditions, lowering the temperature of the water processed by the tower to a value close to wet-bulb temperature, which is lower than the ambient dry-bulb temperature, the difference determined by the initial humidity of the ambient air.|$|E
