5|$|The Sega CD {{can only}} be used in {{conjunction}} with a Genesis system, attaching through an <b>expansion</b> <b>slot</b> {{on the side of the}} main console. Though the Sega CD is an add-on, it does require its own separate power supply.

Several of Apple's desktop computers and portable computers, including the MacBook Pro, MacBook, Mac Mini, and iMac shipped with an AirPort Extreme (802.11g) card as standard. All other modern Macs have an <b>expansion</b> <b>slot</b> for the card. AirPort and AirPort Extreme cards are not physically compatible: AirPort Extreme cards cannot be installed in older Macs, and AirPort cards cannot be installed in newer Macs. The original AirPort card was discontinued in June 2004.|$|E

500|$|The {{original}} ZX Spectrum {{is remembered}} for its rubber keyboard, diminutive size and distinctive rainbow motif. It was originally released on 23 April 1982 with 16KB of RAM for £125 or with 48KB for £175; these prices were later reduced to £99 and £129 respectively. Owners of the 16KB model could purchase an internal 32KB RAM upgrade, which for early [...] "Issue 1" [...] machines {{consisted of a}} daughterboard. Later issue machines required the fitting of 8 dynamic RAM chips and a few TTL chips. Users could mail their 16K Spectrums to Sinclair to be upgraded to 48KB versions. Later revisions contained 64KB of memory but were configured such that only 48KB were usable. External 32KB RAM packs that mounted in the rear <b>expansion</b> <b>slot</b> were available from third parties. Both machines had 16KB of onboard ROM.|$|E

5000|$|Most modern ATX {{motherboards}} have {{a maximum}} of seven PCI or PCI-Express <b>expansion</b> <b>slots,</b> while microATX boards only have {{a maximum of}} four (four being the maximum permitted by the specification). In order to conserve <b>expansion</b> <b>slots</b> and case space, many manufacturers produce microATX motherboard with {{a full range of}} integrated peripherals (especially integrated graphics), which may {{serve as the basis for}} small form factor and media center PCs. For example, the ASRock G31M-S motherboard (pictured right) features onboard Intel GMA graphics, HD Audio audio, and Realtek Ethernet (among others), thus freeing up the <b>expansion</b> <b>slots</b> that would have been used for a graphics card, sound card, and Ethernet card. In recent years, however, it is common even for ATX boards to integrate all these components, as much of this functionality is contained in the typical northbridge/southbridge pair. With the [...] "must-have" [...] functions already present on the motherboard, the need for having many <b>expansion</b> <b>slots</b> has faded, and adoption of microATX has increased even to be used in ATX cases.|$|R
