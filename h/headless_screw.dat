40|$|Background: Fractures of the capitellum {{are rare}} {{injuries}} of the elbow usually {{seen in the}} adolescents. This fracture is often missed {{in the emergency room}} if a proper radiograph is not available. Recent reports have described many modalities of treatment favoring <b>headless</b> <b>screw</b> for fixation. The facility for <b>headless</b> <b>screw</b> fixation, however, is not available in most centers. This paper presents the diagnosis and management of type 4 capituller fractures (Mckee) with gadgets available in a district hospital. Materials and Methods: Between 2004 and 2007 three patients with right sided type IV capetullar fracture were treated in a district hospital. There were two boys aged 15 and 17 and one 33 years old lady. In one case, the fracture was missed in the emergency room. A double arc sign in the lateral views of the X-rays of the elbow was seen in all the cases. In each case a preoperative CT scan was done and a diagnosis of Mckee type IV fracture of the capitellum was made. Under tourniquet, using extended lateral approach, open reduction and internal fixation was done using 4 mm partially threaded AO cancellous screws (n= 2) and 2. 7 mm AO screws (n= 1), under vision from posterior to anterior direction from the posterior aspect of lateral condyle of humerus avoiding articular penetration. Results: All the fractures united uneventfully. At the end of one year follow-up, two cases had excellent elbow function; implants were removed and there were no signs of AVN or arthritis. The third case had good elbow ROM at 11 months without AVN. Conclusion: Double arc sign on lateral X-rays of the elbow along with pre-operative CT scan evaluation is important to avoid a missed diagnosis and analysis of type IV capitellur fracture.

These fractures are frequently associated with other fractures of the midfoot such as Lisfranc fracture-dislocations. However, isolated cuneiform fractures are extremely rare, with few cases reported in the relevant literature. Herein, the authors report 2 cases of isolated medial cuneiform fractures. One of the patients was treated with <b>headless</b> <b>screw</b> fixation due to displacement in fracture configuration, {{and the other was}} treated conservatively.

40|$|AbstractINTRODUCTIONPerilunate dislocations {{represent}} one of {{the most}} devastating injuries to the carpus. Fortunately, these injuries are relatively rare, constituting approximately 10 % of all carpal injuries. One of the problems associated with this injury is the difﬁculty of its accurate and early recognition. PRESENTATION OF CASEIn this study, an uncommon case of bilateral dorsal trans-scaphoid perilunate fracture–dislocation following trauma has been reported. The injury was missed initially and the patient was subsequently operated after two weeks. Anatomic reduction was achieved by closed reduction. After closed reduction, percutaneous pin fixation of the carpus was performed using Kirschner wires. Finally, the scaphoid was stabilized with a <b>headless</b> <b>screw</b> percutaneously. The same procedure was repeated for the other wrist. This was followed by an uneventful post-operative period, with a satisfactory functional outcome at the two-year follow-up, despite non-union of the scaphoid in one side. DISCUSSIONThe case was examined in detail, and compared to the findings in the literature; observations regarding fracture prognosis were also made. Most authors agree that closed reduction is the initial treatment of choice for trans-scaphoid perilunate fracture–dislocations. In addition, treatment often requires intercarpal fixation within the proximal carpal row. CONCLUSIONWe believe that closed reduction in these cases should be attempted regarding the potential risks of avascular necrosis and non-union of the affected carpal bones due to open reduction...|$|E
40|$|Background: Coronal shear {{fractures}} of {{the distal}} humerus are uncommon injuries {{and are not}} exempt from complications. The aim {{of this research is}} to evaluate the possible advantages and drawbacks using cannulated compression <b>headless</b> <b>screws.</b> Materials and methods: We performed a prospective study including all the consecutive patients who were treated with cannulated screws for coronal shear fractures of the distal humerus between 2010 and 2013. Following the Dubberley’s classification, three patients were type 1 A, one patient was 1 B, three patients were 2 B, and one patient was 3 B. The mean follow-up was 30  months. The clinical and radiological evaluation included analysis of passive range of motion, functional outcome, radiological evaluation of fracture healing and reduction maintenance, and the occurrence of possible adverse events. Results: All fractures healed, and radiographic union was observed at an average of 3  months. The average elbow range of motion was 125 °, with 125 ° of flexion and 20 of extension. According to the Broberg and Morrey score, there were four excellent and four good results. Using the Mayo Elbow Performance Index, five cases achieved excellent scores and three reported good results. Adverse events reported in three cases were as follows: heterotopic ossification, complex regional pain syndrome and delayed lateral collateral ligament disruption. Conclusions: The use of cannulated compression <b>headless</b> <b>screws</b> has given satisfactory results, allowing a strong inter-fragmentary compression, early mobilization, with high union rates and good elbow function.

40|$|SummaryObjectiveIntra-articular screws {{are used}} for {{internal}} fixation of osteochondral fragments after fracture or osteochondritis dissecans. This causes cartilage injury potentially leading to chondrocyte death. We have visualised/quantified the hole and zone of cell death (ZCD) in cartilage after drilling/insertion of various articular screws. MethodUsing an ex vivo bovine model with transmitted light and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), the holes and ZCD following drilling/insertion of articular <b>screws</b> (cortical <b>screw,</b> <b>headless</b> variable pitch metallic <b>screw,</b> <b>headless</b> variable pitch bioabsorbable screw) were evaluated. In situ chondrocyte death was determined by live/dead cell viability assay. An imaging/quantification protocol was developed to compare hole diameter and ZCD from drilling/insertion of screws into cartilage. The effect of saline irrigation during drilling on the ZCD was also quantified. ResultsScrew insertion created holes in cartilage that were significantly (P ≤  0. 001) less than the diameters of the equipment used. With a 1. 5  mm drill, a ZCD of 580. 2  ±  124  μm was produced which increased to 637. 0  ±  44  μm following insertion of a 2  mm cortical screw although this was not significant (P >  0. 05). The ZCD from insertion of the variable pitch <b>headless</b> <b>screws</b> (diam. 3. 5  mm) was lower for the metallic compared to the bioabsorbable design (800. 9  ±  159 vs 1, 236. 4  ±  212  μm, respectively; P <  0. 01). The ZCD from drilling was reduced ∼ 50 % (P <  0. 001) by saline irrigation. ConclusionsCartilage injury during intra-articular screw fixation caused a ZCD around the hole irrespective of screw design.

40|$|A {{displaced}} {{fracture of}} the scaphoid {{is one in}} which the fragments have moved from their anatomical position or there is movement between them when stressed by physiological loads. Displacement is seen in about 20 % of fractures of the waist of the scaphoid, as shown by translation, a gap, angulation or rotation. A CT scan in the true longitudinal axis of the scaphoid demonstrates the shape of the bone and displacement of the fracture more accurately than do plain radiographs.

5000|$|<b>Headless</b> set <b>screws</b> {{have been}} around for a long time, with the {{straight}} slot being the oldest drive type (due to its ease of machining), but the demand for <b>headless</b> set <b>screws</b> experienced a marked increase in the first and second decades of the 20th century, when a penchant for better industrial safety, a campaign with the slogan [...] "safety first", swept the industrialized nations of North America and Europe as a part of the larger Progressive Movement. This surge in safety consciousness was a backlash against the often-atrocious industrial safety standards of the era. H.T. Hallowell, Sr., a U.S. industrialist whose corporation was one of several that pioneered the commercialization of the hex socket drive, noted in his memoir that line shafting, which was [...] in the industrial practice of the time, often had headed set screws (with external-wrenching square drive) holding the many pulleys to the line shafts, and collars holding the shafts from axial movement. Gear trains of exposed gears were also common at the time, and those, too, often used headed set screws, holding the gears to the shafts. His company's chief products at the time were shaft hangers and shaft collars of pressed-steel construction. The [...] "safety craze" [...] created a burgeoning demand for <b>headless</b> set <b>screws</b> on pulleys, gears, and collars to replace the headed ones, so that workers' clothing and fingers were less likely to catch on the exposed rotating screw head. It was this heightened demand that prompted Hallowell's firm to get into the screw-making business and to explore socket-head drive designs. With P.L. Robertson holding fresh patent rights on a practical-to-make square-socket drive, the firm soon pursued the hex socket drive.|$|R

Methods: Open reduction and internal fixation {{was performed on}} all patients. The fractures were anatomically reduced and held temporarily by K-wire. If the ends of fractures were atrophic, autologous bone graft from the ipsilateral iliac crest was packed between the ends. Then the fracture fragments were fixed with AO 6. 5 mm <b>headless</b> compression cannulated <b>screws.</b> At least two screws were used to provide rotational stability. One pre-contoured reconstruction plate {{was placed on the}} nonarticular surface posteromedially or posterolaterally as back buttress plate. Results: All the patients were followed up for at least 12 months (range 12 - 25 months). All fractures achieved anatomical reduction and healed clinically and radiographically. At recent follow-up, the mean flexion degree was 120. 6 ° (range 110 °- 135 °) and the mean extension degree was 2. 5 ° (range 0 °- 5 °). The average visual analogue scale score was 1. 6 points (range 0 - 3). Six patients were assessed as excellent and 2 as good according to the hospital for special surgery knee score system.

40|$|The current {{standard}} of care for operative repair of scaphoid fractures involves reduction and internal fixation with a single <b>headless</b> compression <b>screw.</b> However, a compression screw in isolation does not necessarily control rotational stability at a fracture or nonunion site. The single screw provides rotational control through friction and bone interdigitation from compression at the fracture site. We hypothesize that osteosyntheses with novel bone screw sets (BSS) equipped with anti-rotational elements provide improved rotational stability. Stability of osteosynthesis under increasing cyclic torsional loading was investigated on osteotomized cadaveric scaphoids. Two novel prototype BSS, oblique type (BSS-obl.) and longitudinal type (BSS-long.) were compared to three conventional screws: Acutrak 2 ®mini, HCS® 3. 0 and Twinfix®. Biomechanical tests were performed on scaphoids from single donors in paired comparison and analyzed by balanced incomplete random block design.

Primary outcome measure {{was the number of}} cycles to 10 ° clearance, secondary outcome measure was the maximum rotational clearance for each torque level. BSS-obl. performed significantly better than Acutrak 2 ®mini and HCS® (p = 0. 015, p< 0. 0001). BSS-long. performed significantly better than HCS® (p = 0. 010). No significant difference in performance between BSS-obl. and BSS-long. (p = 0. 361), between BSS obl. and Twinfix® (p = 0. 50) and BSS long. and Twinfix® (p = 0. 667) was detected. Within the torque range up to 200 mNm, four of 21 (19 %) BSS-long. and four of 21 (19 %) BSS-obl. preparations showed early failure. The same loading led to early failure in four (29 %) Twinfix®, seven (50 %) Acutrak 2 ®mini and 10 (71 %) HCS® of 14 screw samples, respectively. For both BSS {{and to a lesser extent}} for Twinfix® (as dual-component screw), higher rotational stabilities were identified in comparison to single component <b>headless</b> compression <b>screws...</b>|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{outcome of}} {{operatively}} treated capitellar fractures {{has not been}} reported frequently. The {{purpose of the present}} study was to evaluate the clinical, radiographic, and functional outcomes following open reduction and internal fixation of capitellar fractures that were treated with a uniform surgical approach in order to further define the impact on the outcome of fracture type and concomitant lateral column osseous and/or ligamentous injuries. Methods: A retrospective evaluation of the upper extremity database at our institution identified sixteen skeletally mature patients (mean age, 40 ± 17 years) with a closed capitellar fracture. In all cases, an extensile lateral exposure and articular fixation with buried cannulated variable-pitch <b>headless</b> compression <b>screws</b> was performed at a mean of ten days after the injury. Clinical, radiographic, and elbow-specific outcomes, including the Mayo Elbow Performance Index, were evaluated at a mean of 27 ± 19 months postoperatively...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the interfragmentary {{compression}} force across a simulated scaphoid fracture by two commonly used compression screw systems; the Acutrak 2 Standard and the 3. 0 mm Synthes <b>headless</b> compression <b>screw.</b> METHODS: Sixteen (8 pairs; 6 female, 2 male) cadaver scaphoids were randomly assigned to receive either the Acutrak 2 or Synthes screw with the contralateral scaphoid designated to receive the opposite. Guide wires were inserted under fluoroscopic control. Following transverse osteotomy, the distal and proximal fragments were placed on either side of a custom load cell, to measure interfragmentary compression. Screws were placed under fluoroscopic control using the manufacturer 2 ̆ 7 s recommended surgical technique. Compressive forces were measured during screw insertion. Recording continued for an additional 60 s in order to measure any loss of compression after installation was complete. The peak and final interfragmentary compression were recorded and paired t-tests performed. RESULTS: The mean peak compression generated by the Acutrak 2 Standard was greater than that produced by the Synthes compression screw (103. 9 ± 33. 2 N vs. 88. 7 ± 38. 6 N respectively, p = 0. 13). The mean final interfragmentary compression generated by the Acutrak 2 screw (68. 6 ± 36. 4 N) was significantly greater (p = 0. 04) than the Synthes screw (37. 2 ± 26. 8 N). Specimens typically reached a steady state of compression by 120 - 150 s after final tightening. CONCLUSION: Peak interfragmentary compression observed during screw installation was similar for both screw systems. However, the mean interfragmentary compression generated by the Acutrak 2 Standard was significantly greater. Our study demonstrates that the Synthes <b>headless</b> compression <b>screw</b> experienced a greater loss of interfragmentary compressive force from the time of installation to the final steady state compression level. The higher post-installation compression of the Acutrak 2 Standard may be attributable to the greater number of threads throughout the entire length of the screw. The clinical significance of these results, are, at this point uncertain. We do demonstrate that a fully threaded design offers a more reliable compression that may translate to more predictable bony union...|$|R
