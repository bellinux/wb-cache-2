5|$|Not long thereafter, the film-directing team of Dan Pița and Mircea Veroiu {{found that}} Agârbiceanu's short stories {{supplied}} ideal material for their interest <b>in</b> <b>formal</b> experimentation, leading to two films, each {{based on a}} pair of his stories: Nunta de piatră (1972) and Duhul aurului (1974). In 1988, Nicolae Mărgineanu and Ion Brad also filmed their version of Arhanghelii, as Flames over Treasures.|$|E

50|$|In some countries, {{including}} the United States, the title Pastor (such as Pastor Smith <b>in</b> more <b>formal</b> address or Pastor John <b>in</b> less <b>formal)</b> {{is often used}} in many Protestant traditions rather than The Reverend or Reverend. The United Methodist Church in the United States often addresses its ministers as Reverend (e.g., Reverend Smith).

50|$|<b>In</b> metalogic, <b>formal</b> {{languages}} are sometimes called object languages. The language {{used to make}} statements about an object language is called a metalanguage. This distinction is a key difference between logic and metalogic. While logic deals with proofs <b>in</b> a <b>formal</b> system, expressed <b>in</b> some <b>formal</b> language, metalogic deals with proofs about a formal system which are expressed in a metalanguage about some object language.|$|R
5|$|Schubert's piano sonatas seem to {{have been}} mostly {{neglected}} during the entire nineteenth century, often dismissed for being too long, lacking <b>in</b> <b>formal</b> coherence, being un-pianistic, etc. However, references to the last sonatas can be found among two nineteenth-century Romantic composers who took serious interest in Schubert's music and were influenced by it: Schumann and Brahms.|$|E
5|$|Some lead {{compounds}} exist <b>in</b> <b>formal</b> oxidation states other than +4 or +2. Lead(III) may be obtained, {{as an intermediate}} between lead(II) and lead(IV), in larger organolead complexes; this oxidation state is not stable as both the lead(III) ion and the larger complexes containing it are radicals. The same applies for lead(I), {{which can be found}} in such species.|$|E
5|$|Some {{proponents of}} Saussure's view of {{language}} have advocated a formal approach which studies language structure by identifying its basic elements {{and then by}} presenting a formal account of the rules according to which the elements combine in order to form words and sentences. The main proponent of such a theory is Noam Chomsky, the originator of the generative theory of grammar, who has defined language as the construction of sentences that can be generated using transformational grammars. Chomsky considers these rules to be an innate feature {{of the human mind}} and to constitute the rudiments of what language is. By way of contrast, such transformational grammars are also commonly used to provide formal definitions of language are commonly used <b>in</b> <b>formal</b> logic, <b>in</b> <b>formal</b> theories of grammar, and in applied computational linguistics. In the philosophy of language, the view of linguistic meaning as residing in the logical relations between propositions and reality was developed by philosophers such as Alfred Tarski, Bertrand Russell, and other formal logicians.|$|E

30|$|Chitika (2008) also {{explored}} {{the reasons why}} farmers were involved <b>in</b> the <b>formal</b> and informal markets. He argued that farmers sold milk <b>in</b> the <b>formal</b> market {{due to the fact}} that it assured market consistency and also smoothed consumption patterns. This is {{due to the fact that}} payments <b>in</b> the <b>formal</b> market are monthly, which acted as a form of savings mechanism in comparison to instant payments received in the informal channel. Three main reasons were given for the use of the informal market: higher prices than <b>in</b> the <b>formal</b> market 4; access to cash quickly (through instant payment) and; low risk of non-sale, since no tests for milk quality were conducted.|$|R

5|$|Although he {{had little}} {{interest}} <b>in</b> <b>formal</b> education and rarely attended classes, Sylvester was enrolled at Jordan High School. He graduated in 1969 {{at the age of}} 21; in his graduation photograph, he appeared in drag wearing a blue chiffon prom dress and beehive hairstyle. By the end of the decade, the Disquotays had begun to drift apart, with a number of them abandoning cross-dressing and others recognizing that they were trans women and undergoing sex reassignment surgery. Sylvester always considered himself male and began to tone down the feminine nature of his clothing, aiming for a more androgynous look which combined male and female styles and which was influenced by the fashions of the hippie movement.|$|E
5|$|Arthur Fiacco, a cellist, {{arrived at}} Carriage House first. He was dressed <b>in</b> <b>formal</b> {{black and white}} attire, having {{traveled}} from an afternoon concert. Fiacco {{was surprised to find}} there were no scores written for the musicians to play; he then wrote a part based on riffs Francis had shown him. The violinists, Corinne Metter and Karen Karlsrud, also followed the directions of Francis and Norton. Another cellist, Ann Rorich, credited on the album and single, was sent home; according to Fiacco he doubled her parts.|$|E
5|$|At {{an early}} stage, in {{documents}} {{written in the}} paleo-Hebrew script, words were divided by short vertical lines and later by dots, as reflected by the Mesha Stone, the Siloam inscription, the Ophel inscription, and paleo-Hebrew script documents from Qumran. Word division was not used in Phoenician inscriptions; however, there is not direct evidence for biblical texts being written without word division, as suggested by Nahmanides {{in his introduction to}} the Torah. Word division using spaces was commonly used {{from the beginning of the}} 7th century BCE for documents in the Aramaic script. In addition to marking vowels, the Tiberian system also uses cantillation marks, which serve to mark word stress, semantic structure, and the musical motifs used <b>in</b> <b>formal</b> recitation of the text.|$|E

Employers <b>in</b> the <b>formal</b> sector ration employment by using education/experience as an index of productivity, and using religion/caste as a signal for productivity (statistical discrimination). Given two people with the same education/skill levels, they would prefer a high caste Hindu to a low caste Hindu or a Muslim.

And in instances such as gandingan contest, gandingan players may be assisted by two mulits (kulintang assistants) who would hold the gongs steadily in place as players ferociously demonstrate their virtuosity on the instrument.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>formal</b> competition, {{each player}} {{is obliged to}} record each move as it is played in a chess {{notation}} in order to settle disputes about illegal positions, overstepping time control, and making claims of draws by the fifty-move rule or repetition of position. Algebraic chess notation is the accepted standard for recording games today. There are other systems such as ICCF numeric notation for international correspondence chess and the obsolete descriptive chess notation. The current rule is that a move must {{be made on the}} board before it is written on paper or recorded with an electronic device.|$|E
5|$|It {{was during}} the 20th century that a common, {{standardized}} national language became available to all Swedes. The orthography was finally stabilized, and was almost completely uniform, {{with the exception of}} some minor deviations, {{by the time of the}} spelling reform of 1906. With the exception of plural forms of verbs and a slightly different syntax, particularly in the written language, the language was the same as the Swedish of today. The plural verb forms appeared decreasingly <b>in</b> <b>formal</b> writing into the 1950s, when their use was removed from all official recommendations.|$|E
