25|$|Heirens's lawyers {{pressured}} {{him to take}} Tuohy's plea bargain. That deal, {{which was}} the topic of that closed-door meeting with Tuohy, stated that Heirens would serve one life sentence if he confessed to the murders of Josephine Ross, Frances Brown, and Suzanne Degnan. With {{the help of his}} lawyers, he began drafting a confession using the Chicago Tribune article as a guide:As it turned out, the Tribune article was very helpful, as it provided me with a lot of details I didn't know. My attorneys rarely changed anything outright, but I could tell by their faces if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> mistake. Or they would say, 'Now, Bill, is that really the way it happened?' Then I would change my story because, obviously, it went against what was known (in the Tribune).|$|E

It was during a Barbarians match, and my attacking game was about as finely-tuned as it had ever been. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> couple of really good runs and, after setting up one try and scoring another, the crowd got {{to their feet and}} clapped me back to halfway. I'll never forget it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Borlaug {{said that}} his first few years in Mexico were difficult. He lacked trained {{scientists}} and equipment. Local farmers were hostile towards the wheat program because of serious crop losses from 1939 to 1941 due to stem rust. [...] "It often appeared to me that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> dreadful mistake in accepting the position in Mexico," [...] {{he wrote in the}} epilogue to his book, Norman Borlaug on World Hunger. He spent the first ten years breeding wheat cultivars resistant to disease, including rust. In that time, his group made 6,000 individual crossings of wheat.|$|E

2500|$|Widman {{described}} the run {{after the game}} as follows:"The play was a revolving wedge on Chicago's left tackle. [...] Their end and tackle had been drawn in by our men, and when the ball {{was given to me}} on a delayed pass I had a clear field, except for Chicago's backs. [...] I ran as fast as I could diagonally across the field, realizing that I was hotly pursued. [...] At last I was tackled on what I afterwards learned was about the six-yard line. [...] I was slightly dazed by the fall, but saw a goal post ahead of me and managed to crawl over the line. [...] I did not know <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> touchdown, however, until Captain Bennett told me." ...|$|E
2500|$|Where as {{his rule}} of Wazirabad is {{described}} as just and rigorous, his governorship of Peshawar is depicted {{as a rule of}} [...] "gallows and gibbets". Avitabile boasted: [...] "When I marched into Peshawar, I sent on in advance a number of wooden posts which my men erected around the walls of the city. The men scoffed at them and laughed at the madness of the feringhee , and harder still when my men came in and laid coils of rope {{at the foot of the}} posts...However, when my preparations were completed and they found one fine morning danging from these posts, fifty of the worse characters in Peshawar, they thought different. And I repeated the exhibition every day till <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> scarcity of brigands and murderers. Then I had to deal with the liars and tale bearers. My method with them was to cut out their tongues. When a surgeon appeared and professed to be able to restore their speech, I sent for him and cut out his tongue also. After that there was peace".|$|E
2500|$|Serving as the album's most radio-friendly track, [...] "Ice Cream" [...] was {{released}} September 25, 1995, with [...] "Incarcerated Scarfaces" [...] as its B-side. This {{proved to be}} the most successful single off the album, as it reached the 37th spot on the Billboard Hot 100, and the fifth spot on the Hot Rap Singles chart. The song uses different flavor variants of ice cream as a metaphor for different races of women. Raekwon later commented [...] "we wanted to reach out and let the women know that we respected them as queens. And queens, much like ice cream, come in all different flavors." [...] The song marks the second appearance of Cappadonna on the album, and serves as his break-through performance, as it would give him commercial exposure. In regard to his guest spot, Cappadonna later recalled [...] "I had heard Rae's and Ghost's verses on there. And <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> joke about me getting on the track, and RZA took it seriously and was like [...] "Yo, go ahead. Lace that." ...|$|E

2500|$|In France, the {{powerful}} minister of Louis XIII, Cardinal Richelieu, {{angered by the}} defeat, deprived Sourdis of his office and replaced him by the young naval officer Jean Armand de Maillé-Brézé. In Spain, {{in spite of his}} success, also Don García de Toledo, Duke of Fernandina, was deprived of his charge. The Count-Duke of Olivares felt dissatisfied because Fernandina did not destroyed the French fleet, and imprisoned him. The case was truly unusual: the two admirals, both the victor and the vanquished, had the same bitter reward. However, the ostracism of the French Admiral was final, while the Spanish Admiral was soon restored after the fall of Olivares in 1643, back in charge, and even became part of the Council of the King of Spain. Regarding to Sourdis disgrace, the Spanish admiral Gianettino Doria said that [...] "Would to Heaven that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> similar retreat, my fortune would be made forever". He was impressed by how Sourdis had fought off a fleet four time superior in numbers and had retired without the loss of a single vessel. But the war continued, and the following year, a new Spanish fleet organized at Cádiz to relieve the isolated garrisons of Roses and Collioure was prevented to do so by Jean Armand de Maillé-Brézé in the Battle of Barcelona (1642), which sealed the loss of Perpignan to France shortly afterwards.|$|E
2500|$|Ruddock {{went back}} to Japan in 1966 {{specifically}} to learn Aikido, travelling six weeks by sea. He first saw Ueshiba about four days after he started regular training. [...] "He was {{the real reason for}} my Aikido pilgrimage to Japan. I had read quite a bit about this miraculous old man and having seen the pictures – I wanted the real thing. I knew what he did was special and wanted to be like that too – but I did not feel the same 'Wow – this is something else!" [...] kind of response that others report. I was impressed and intrigued – but not overawed. My journey to Japan was a personal spiritual quest and I realised that this man was someone you only get to be around once – he was a true mystic. Over the coming months and years I was to see him on a daily basis (when he was in Tokyo). As a karate man with both Judo and Jujitsu experience, I was not easily impressed by people flying through the air for apparently no reason. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> huge effort by modern standards to be there to learn what was on offer but – over the first few months I began to think – 'Can this really be true, these guys are just falling over...' Then, little by little, as other guys who had 'gone for him' described their bewildering experiences of falling ( [...] for no good reason [...] ) and also my own careful observations of the reactions of his Ukes – I was convinced that this man was incredible." ...|$|E
2500|$|... “One day Colonel Cody {{sent for}} me to come to his private office. [...] Wondering what he would want of me, I knocked at his door. [...] He invited me in, remarking, ‘Sit down, Standing Bear. [...] I have sent for you because I want you to tell you {{something}} of importance. [...] The Big Chief of this country, the King of England, has promised to attend a performance of our show. [...] Now I want you to go back to your people, call them all together, and tell them all about it. [...] Tell them {{to be very careful about}} their clothes; to see that they are perfectly clean and neat for that particular performance. [...] If anything needs repairs, tell them to attend to it at once. [...] We must please the King at this performance. [...] Rehearse your Indians well so they will do their best for me. [...] If the King likes our show, it will please the people of this country. [...] I have observed your own costume. [...] It is very fine, and when the King attends the show, I want you to do an Indian dance in front of his box. [...] Will you do this for me?” [...] “Everything worked splendidly. [...] When it came time for the Indians to come in with their village in the center of the arena, we started the dance in which I was to appear before the King of England. [...] I had a beautiful lance, and as the dance proceeded I worked over toward the King’s box. [...] There I shook the lance in his face and danced my very prettiest, you may be sure. [...] The King had been very dignified thus far, and had not even smiled. [...] But when I got down to doing my fancy steps and gave a few Sioux yells, he had to smile in spite of himself. [...] I saw that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> hit with him and was very happy. After the show, Buffalo Bill brought the King and his party around the inside of the arena. [...] In front of him walked a big man who seemed to keep his eyes roving about all the while. [...] I think he must have been the King’s personal bodyguard. [...] Buffalo Bill brought the King over to me and we were introduced. [...] We shook hands, although neither of us said a word. [...] But I had the honor of being introduced to King Edward VII, the monarch of Great Britain.” ...|$|E
