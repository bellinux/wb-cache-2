5|$|The 100th Congress {{formed a}} joint {{committee}} (Congressional Committees Investigating The <b>Iran-Contra</b> <b>Affair)</b> and held hearings in mid-1987. Transcripts were published as: Iran-Contra Investigation: Joint Hearings Before the Senate Select Committee on Secret Military Assistance to Iran and the Nicaraguan Opposition and the House Select Committee to Investigate Covert Arms Transactions with Iran (U.S. GPO 1987–88). A closed Executive Session heard classified testimony from North and Poindexter; this transcript {{was published in}} a redacted format. The joint committee's final report was Report of the Congressional Committees Investigating the <b>Iran-Contra</b> <b>Affair</b> With Supplemental, Minority, and Additional Views (U.S. GPO November 17, 1987). The records of the committee are at the National Archives, but many are still non-public.|$|E
5|$|In 1990 the ACLU defended Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North, whose {{conviction}} was {{tainted by}} coerced testimonya violation of his fifth amendment rightsduring the <b>Iran–Contra</b> <b>affair,</b> where Oliver North {{was involved in}} illegal weapons sales to Iran in order to illegally fund the Contra guerillas.|$|E
5|$|Originally declining, U.S. Congressman Barber Conable persuaded Cheney to {{join the}} {{moderate}} Republican Wednesday Group {{in order to move}} up the leadership ranks. He was elected Chairman of the Republican Policy Committee from 1981 to 1987. Cheney was the Ranking Member of the Select Committee to investigate the <b>Iran-Contra</b> <b>Affair.</b>|$|E
5|$|Testimony {{was also}} heard before the House Foreign Affairs Committee, House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, and Senate Select Committee on Intelligence {{and can be}} found in the Congressional Record for those bodies. The Senate Intelligence Committee {{produced}} two reports: Preliminary Inquiry into the Sale of Arms to Iran and Possible Diversion of Funds to the Nicaraguan Resistance (February 2, 1987) and Were Relevant Documents Withheld from the Congressional Committees Investigating the <b>Iran-Contra</b> <b>Affair?</b> (June 1989).|$|E
5|$|In 1986, the <b>Iran–Contra</b> <b>affair</b> {{became a}} problem for the {{administration}} stemming from the use of proceeds from covert arms sales to Iran during the Iran–Iraq War to fund the Contra rebels fighting against the government in Nicaragua, which had been specifically outlawed by an act of Congress. The affair became a political scandal in the United States during the 1980s. The International Court of Justice, whose jurisdiction to decide the case was disputed by the United States, ruled that the United States had violated international law and breached treaties in Nicaragua in various ways.|$|E
5|$|Since Reagan {{left office}} in 1989, {{substantial}} debate has occurred among scholars, historians, {{and the general}} public surrounding his legacy. Supporters have pointed to a more efficient and prosperous economy as a result of Reagan's economic policies, foreign policy triumphs including a peaceful end to the Cold War, and a restoration of American pride and morale. Proponents also argue Reagan restored faith in the American Dream with his unabated and passionate love for the United States, after a decline in American confidence and self-respect under Jimmy Carter's perceived weak leadership, particularly during the Iran hostage crisis, as well as his gloomy, dreary outlook {{for the future of the}} United States during the 1980 election. Critics contend that Reagan's economic policies resulted in rising budget deficits, a wider gap in wealth, and an increase in homelessness and that the <b>Iran–Contra</b> <b>affair</b> lowered American credibility.|$|E
5|$|Several {{investigations}} ensued, including by the U.S. Congress and the three-person, Reagan-appointed Tower Commission. Neither {{found any}} evidence that President Reagan himself knew {{of the extent of}} the multiple programs. Ultimately the sale of weapons to Iran was not deemed a criminal offense but charges were brought against five individuals for their support of the Contras. Those charges, however, were later dropped because the administration refused to declassify certain documents. The indicted conspirators faced various lesser charges instead. In the end, fourteen administration officials were indicted, including then-Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger. Eleven convictions resulted, some of which were vacated on appeal. The rest of those indicted or convicted were all pardoned {{in the final days of}} the presidency of George H.W. Bush, who had been Vice President at the time of the affair. The <b>Iran-Contra</b> <b>Affair</b> and the ensuing deception to protect senior administration officials including President Reagan has been cast as an example of post-truth politics.|$|E
5|$|The White House Chief of Staff, Donald Regan, grew {{frustrated}} with this regimen, which created friction {{between him and}} the First Lady. This escalated with the revelation of the <b>Iran–Contra</b> <b>affair,</b> an administration scandal, in which the First Lady felt Regan was damaging the president. She thought he should resign, and expressed this to her husband, although he did not share her view. Regan wanted President Reagan to address the Iran-Contra matter in early 1987 by means of a press conference, though Reagan refused to allow her husband to overexert himself due to a recent prostate surgery and astrological warnings. Regan became so angry with Reagan that he hung up on her during a 1987 telephone conversation. According to the recollections of ABC News correspondent Sam Donaldson, when the President heard of this treatment, he demanded—and eventually received—Regan's resignation. Vice President George H. W. Bush is also reported to have suggested to Reagan to have Regan fired.|$|E
25|$|Reagan's Invasion of Grenada and {{bombing of}} Libya were {{popular in the}} U.S, though his backing of the Contras rebels was mired in the {{controversy}} over the <b>Iran–Contra</b> <b>affair</b> that revealed Reagan's poor management style.|$|E
25|$|Gates was {{nominated}} {{to become the}} Director of Central Intelligence (head of the CIA) in early 1987. He withdrew his name after it became clear the Senate would reject the nomination due to controversy {{about his role in}} the <b>Iran-Contra</b> <b>affair.</b>|$|E
25|$|Outspoken {{criticism}} of U.S. foreign policy, from its policies in Central America in the 1980s, including the <b>Iran–Contra</b> <b>affair,</b> to the First Gulf War in 1991, the Kosovo War in 1999, and the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan in 2001 and 2003 invasion of Iraq.|$|E
25|$|From {{an early}} stage, the rebels {{received}} financial and military {{support from the}} United States government, and their military significance decisively depended on it. After US support was banned by Congress, the Reagan administration covertly continued it. These covert activities culminated in the <b>Iran–Contra</b> <b>affair.</b>|$|E
25|$|As {{part of the}} <b>Iran–Contra</b> <b>affair,</b> Israel and Argentina {{collaborated with}} the United States to send arms to Iran to assist in arming Nicaraguan contras. Transporte Aéreo Rioplatense, which was {{revealed}} to be operated by high-ranking officials in the Argentine Air Force, transported military equipment from Israel to Iran, {{in support of the}} latter during its war with Iraq.|$|E
25|$|His {{tenure as}} Secretary of Defense {{is the third}} longest in U.S. history, and spanned {{the final years of}} the Cold War. He is also known for his key role in the administration's Strategic Defense Initiative and for being indicted in the <b>Iran–Contra</b> <b>affair.</b> He was awarded both the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1987 and an honorary British knighthood from Queen Elizabeth II.|$|E
25|$|In 1987 Moyers {{produced}} and hosted a scathing documentary, The Secret Government: The Constitution in Crisis, covering the infringement on the limitations on {{government and the}} executive branch provided by the Constitution. It considered U.S. foreign policy and militarism historically and recently, centering on the <b>Iran–Contra</b> <b>affair.</b> It was harshly rebuked by conservatives and continuing into the 1990s was used by Republicans {{as a reason to}} threaten the funding of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and PBS.|$|E
25|$|In 1988, the College of Public and International Affairs was reorganized {{to create}} two {{free-standing}} schools: the School of International Service and the School of Public Affairs, incorporating the School of Government and Public Administration and the School of Justice. That same year, {{construction on the}} Adnan Khashoggi Sports Center completed while the <b>Iran-Contra</b> <b>Affair</b> controversy was at its height although his name remained on the building until after Khashoggi defaulted on his donation obligation {{in the mid to}} late 1990s.|$|E
25|$|Rizzo {{was hired}} at the CIA in 1976, {{just after the}} Church Committee {{released}} its report on the assassination of foreign leaders. By 1979, Rizzo became the staff lawyer for the Directorate of Operations, the CIA's clandestine branch. He served as the liaison between the CIA and the congressional investigators studying the <b>Iran-Contra</b> <b>affair</b> in the 1980s. Rizzo became Acting General Counsel of the CIA in November 2001, a position that was traditionally filled by someone from outside the agency.|$|E
25|$|Schultz {{left the}} Nixon {{administration}} in 1974 {{to become an}} executive with Bechtel. After becoming {{president and director of}} that company, he accepted President Ronald Reagan's offer to serve as the United States Secretary of State. He held that office from 1982 to 1989. Shultz pushed for Reagan to establish relations with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, which led to a thaw between the United States and the Soviet Union. He opposed the U.S. aid to the Sandinistas which led to the <b>Iran–Contra</b> <b>affair.</b>|$|E
25|$|U.S. {{funding for}} the Contras, who opposed the Sandinista {{government}} of Nicaragua, was obtained from covert sources. The U.S. Congress did not authorize sufficient funds for the Contras' efforts, and the Boland Amendment barred further funding. In 1986, in an episode that became known as The <b>Iran–Contra</b> <b>affair,</b> the Reagan administration illegally facilitated the sale of arms to Iran, {{the subject of an}} arms embargo, {{in the hope that the}} arms sales would secure the release of hostages and allow U.S. intelligence agencies to fund the Nicaraguan Contras.|$|E
25|$|The U.S. role Nicaragua was a {{controversial}} {{topic in the}} 1980s. The Reagan administration had sought to overthrow the socialist Daniel Ortega by funding the right-wing Contras, resulting in the <b>Iran–Contra</b> <b>affair.</b> Bush and Secretary of State Baker sought to find a bipartisan way to settle the issue, and {{with the support of}} Congress, they ended military aid to the Contras in return for a promise from Ortega to hold full and free elections in 1990. In the election, Ortega was defeated by Violeta Chamorro of the National Opposition Union.|$|E
25|$|In October 2005, Libby {{resigned}} {{from all three}} government positions after he was indicted on five counts by {{a federal grand jury}} concerning the investigation of the leak of the covert identity of Central Intelligence Agency officer Valerie Plame Wilson. He was subsequently convicted of four counts (one count of obstruction of justice, two counts of perjury, and one count of making false statements), making him the highest-ranking White House official convicted in a government scandal since John Poindexter, the national security adviser to President Ronald Reagan in the <b>Iran–Contra</b> <b>affair.</b>|$|E
25|$|Because of {{his senior}} status in the CIA, Gates was close to many figures who played {{significant}} roles in the <b>Iran-Contra</b> <b>Affair</b> and {{was in a position}} to have known of their activities. In 1984, as deputy director of CIA, Gates advocated that the U.S. initiate a bombing campaign against Nicaragua and that the U.S. do everything in its power short of direct military invasion of the country to remove the Sandinista government. The evidence developed by Independent Counsel did not warrant indictment of Gates for his Iran-Contra activities or his responses to official inquiries.|$|E
25|$|In 1982, {{legislation}} was enacted by US Congress to prohibit further direct {{aid to the}} Contras. Reagan's officials attempted to illegally supply {{them out of the}} proceeds of arms sales to Iran and third party donations, triggering the <b>Iran-Contra</b> <b>Affair</b> of 1986–87. Mutual exhaustion, Sandinista fears of Contra unity and military success, and mediation by other regional governments led to the Sapoa ceasefire between the Sandinistas and the Contras on March 23, 1988. Subsequent agreements were designed to reintegrate the Contras and their supporters into Nicaraguan society in preparation for general elections.|$|E
25|$|He had a {{determining}} role in {{the dismissal}} of Abulhassan Banisadr as commander-in-chief of Iranian military and then his impeachment in the parliament as Iran's first president in June 1981. In the summer of 1981, he protested to the veto of the parliament's plan by the Guardian Council and informed it to Ruhollah Khomeini. This led {{to the establishment of}} Expediency Discernment Council, which later he chaired the council. He had an active role in <b>Iran–Contra</b> <b>affair,</b> which was divulged by Mehdi Hashemi and failed. Mehdi Hashemi was executed but Rafsanjani was the loser at internal dimension.|$|E
25|$|Khashoggi was {{implicated in}} the <b>Iran–Contra</b> <b>affair</b> as a key {{middleman}} in the arms-for-hostages exchange along with Iranian arms dealer Manucher Ghorbanifar and, in a complex series of events, {{was found to have}} borrowed money for these arms purchases from the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) with Saudi and United States backing. His role in the affair created a related controversy when Khashoggi donated millions to the American University in Washington, DC to build a sports arena which would bear his name. Khashoggi {{was a member of the}} university's board of trustees from 1983 until his indictment on fraud and other charges in May 1989.|$|E
25|$|Along with {{bombings and}} hijackings, Islamic terrorists have made {{extensive}} use of highly publicised kidnappings and executions, often circulating videos of the acts for use as propaganda. A frequent form of execution by these groups is decapitation, another is shooting. In the 1980s, a series of abductions of American citizens by Hezbollah during the Lebanese Civil War resulted in the 1986 <b>Iran–Contra</b> <b>affair.</b> During {{the chaos of the}} Iraq War, more than 200 kidnappings foreign hostages (for various reasons and by various groups, including purely criminal) gained great international notoriety, even as the great majority (thousands) of victims were Iraqis. In 2007, the kidnapping of Alan Johnston by Army of Islam resulted in the British government meeting a Hamas member for the first time.|$|E
25|$|Cronkite was {{replaced}} as anchor {{of the program}} the Monday after his retirement, March 9, 1981, by then 49-year-old Dan Rather, {{who had been with}} CBS News as a correspondent since the early 1960s and later became a correspondent for the network's newsmagazine 60 Minutes. Concerns about excessive liberalism in the media were frequently leveled at Rather, the CBS Evening News, CBS News and CBS in general. Some of these concerns dated from Rather's position as White House correspondent for the network's news division during the Nixon administration. An interview related to the <b>Iran–Contra</b> <b>affair</b> with then-Vice President George H.W. Bush where the two engaged in a shouting match on live television did little to dispel those concerns. Rather apologized for his behavior in statements the following day.|$|E
25|$|The Boland Amendment was a {{compromise}} because the U.S. Democratic Party {{did not have}} enough votes for a comprehensive ban on military aid. It covered only appropriated funds spent by intelligence agencies. Some of Reagan's national security officials used non-appropriated money of the National Security Council (NSC) to circumvent the Amendment. NSC officials sought to arrange funding by third parties. These efforts resulted in the <b>Iran-Contra</b> <b>Affair</b> of 1987, which concerned Contra funding through the proceeds of arms sales to the Islamic Republic of Iran. No court ever made a determination whether Boland covered the NSC and {{on the grounds that it}} was a prohibition rather than a criminal statute, no one was indicted for violating it. Congress later resumed aid to the Contras, totaling over $300million. The Contra war ended when the Sandinistas were voted out of power by a war-weary populace in 1990. Sandinista leader Daniel Ortega was re-elected as President of Nicaragua in 2006 and took office again on January 10, 2007.|$|E
25|$|In June 2009 a coup d'état ousted President Manuel Zelaya; he {{was taken}} in a {{military}} aircraft to neighboring Costa Rica. The General Assembly of the United Nations voted to denounce the coup and called {{for the restoration of}} Zelaya. Several Latin American nations including Mexico temporarily severed diplomatic relations with Honduras. In July 2010, full diplomatic relations were once again re-established with Mexico. The United States sent out mixed messages after the coup; Obama called the ouster a coup and expressed support for Zelaya's return to power. US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, advised by John Negroponte, the former Reagan-era to Honduras implicated in the <b>Iran-Contra</b> <b>affair,</b> refrained from expressing support. She has since explained that the US would have had to cut aid if it called Zelaya's ouster a military coup, although the US has a record of ignoring these events when it chooses. Zelaya had expressed an interest in Hugo Chávez' Bolivarian Alliance for Peoples of our America (ALBA), and had actually joined in 2008. After the 2009 coup, Honduras withdrew its membership.|$|E
500|$|Congressional {{committees}} {{investigating the}} <b>Iran–Contra</b> <b>affair</b> ...|$|E
500|$|In January 1987, Congress {{announced}} it was opening {{an investigation into the}} <b>Iran–Contra</b> <b>affair.</b> Depending upon one's political perspective, the Congressional investigation into the <b>Iran–Contra</b> <b>affair</b> was either an attempt by the legislative arm to gain control over an out-of-control executive arm, a partisan [...] "witch hunt" [...] by the Democrats against a Republican administration or a feeble effort by Congress that did far too little to rein in the [...] "imperial presidency" [...] that had run amok by breaking numerous laws. The Democratic-controlled United States Congress issued its own report on November 18, 1987, stating that [...] "If the president did not know what his national security advisers were doing, he should have". The congressional report wrote that the president bore [...] "ultimate responsibility" [...] for wrongdoing by his aides, and his administration exhibited [...] "secrecy, deception and disdain for the law". It also read that [...] "the central remaining question {{is the role of the}} President in the <b>Iran–Contra</b> <b>affair.</b> On this critical point, the shredding of documents by Poindexter, North and others, and the death of Casey, leave the record incomplete".|$|E
500|$|In Poindexter's {{hometown}} of Odon, Indiana, a street was renamed to John Poindexter Street. Bill Breeden, a former minister, stole the street's sign {{in protest of}} the <b>Iran–Contra</b> <b>affair.</b> He claimed that he was holding it for a ransom of $30million, {{in reference to the}} amount of money given to Iran to transfer to the Contras. He was later arrested and confined to prison, making him, as satirically noted by Howard Zinn, [...] "the only person to be imprisoned {{as a result of the}} Iran–Contra Scandal".|$|E
500|$|He {{joined the}} Los Angeles Times in 1964 {{where he spent}} the next four decades until he retired. After criticizing {{president}} Richard Nixon during the Watergate scandal, Conrad was the only cartoonist to appear on Nixon's Enemies List. [...] In the 1980s, Conrad criticized the military buildup and arms race advocated by president Ronald Reagan, and the involvement of the Reagan administration in the <b>Iran–Contra</b> <b>affair,</b> the illegal covert operation which sold weapons to Iran to secure the release of hostages while funding the contras in Nicaragua with the proceeds from the arms sales.|$|E
500|$|The <b>Iran–Contra</b> <b>affair</b> ( [...] , [...] ), also {{referred}} to as Irangate, Contragate or the Iran–Contra scandal, was a political scandal in the United States that occurred during the second term of the Reagan Administration. Senior administration officials secretly facilitated the sale of arms to Iran, which was the subject of an arms embargo. They hoped, thereby, to fund the Contras in Nicaragua {{while at the same time}} negotiating the release of several U.S. hostages. Under the Boland Amendment, further funding of the Contras by the government had been prohibited by Congress.|$|E
500|$|Gene Roddenberry {{originated}} {{the idea}} for the episode in a single-sentence proposal entitled [...] "The Assassins". Robert Sabaroff expanded this idea to thirty pages, but his version was seen as too expensive. Tracy Tormé was then given the job of rewriting it, but some producers thought the new version was too dark until Roddenberry saw it and endorsed the new version. In one of the original versions, it was a faction within Starfleet who were conspirators rather than alien parasites, but Roddenberry did not like showing Starfleet itself in such a dark manner. The premise was based on the <b>Iran–Contra</b> <b>affair.</b>|$|E
500|$|In February {{the press}} {{reported}} that, according to campaign finance filings, McEwen trailed both Buchert and Portman in funds, Buchert having {{three times the}} treasury McEwen did. McEwen was endorsed by Oliver North, whose prosecution in the <b>Iran-Contra</b> <b>Affair</b> McEwen had labeled a [...] "political witch hunt" [...] {{when he was in}} Congress. McEwen also criticized Portman for lobbying Congress to pass the tax increase President George H. W. Bush supported when Portman was a White House aide. He also criticized Portman for being a lobbyist for Oman. McEwen brought his former House colleague Jack Kemp to Ohio to campaign for him.|$|E
