5000|$|The nectar {{from the}} flowers is {{harvested}} by bees; this {{is used to}} make Leptospermum honey. Honey produced from Australian Leptospermum polygalifolium, also known as <b>jelly</b> <b>bush</b> or the lemon-scented tea tree, {{has been found to}} contain up to 1750 mg/kg of 'methylglyoxal' (MGO), an antibacterial compound. However, after neutralization of this compound, the [...] "manuka" [...] honey retains bactericidal activity. [...] Methylglyoxal thus {{does not appear to be}} the main contributor to the antimicrobial and antibacterial activities.|$|E
40|$|Flavonoids, {{phenolic}} {{acids and}} abscisic acid of Australian and New Zealand Leptospermum honeys {{were analyzed by}} HPLC. Fifteen flavonoids were isolated in Australian <b>jelly</b> <b>bush</b> honey (Leptospermum polygalifolium), with an average content of 2. 22 mg/ 100 g honey. Myricetin (3, 5, 7, 3 ′, 4 ′, 5 ′-hexahydroxyflavone), luteolin (5, 7, 3 ′, 4 ′-tetrahydroxyflavone) and tricetin (5, 7, 3 ′, 4 ′, 5 ′-pentahydroxyflavone) were the main flavonoids identified. The mean content of total phenolic acids in <b>jelly</b> <b>bush</b> honey was 5. 14 mg/ 100 g honey, with gallic and coumaric acids as the potential phenolic acids. Abscisic acid was quantified as twice the amount (11. 6 mg/ 100 g honey) of the phenolic acids in this honey. The flavonoid profile mainly consisted of quercetin (3, 5, 7, 3 ′, 4 ′-pentahydroxyflavone), isorhamnetin (3, 5, 7, 4 ′-tetrahydroxyflavone 3 ′-methyl ethyl), chrysin (5, 7 -dihydroxyflavone), luteolin and an unknown flavanone in New Zealand manuka (Leptospermum scoparium) honey with an average content of total flavonoids of 3. 06 mg/ 100 g honey. The content of total phenolic acids was up to 14. 0 mg/ 100 g honey, with gallic acid as the main component. A substantial quantity (32. 8 mg/ 100 g honey) of abscisic acid was present in manuka honey. These results showed that flavonoids and phenolic acids {{could be used for}} authenticating honey floral origins, and abscisic acid may aid in this authentication...|$|E
