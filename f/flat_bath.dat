5000|$|Once {{the scrap}} has {{completely}} melted {{down and a}} <b>flat</b> <b>bath</b> is reached, another bucket of scrap can be charged into the furnace and melted down, although EAF development is moving towards single-charge designs. After the second charge is completely melted, refining operations take place to check and correct the steel chemistry and superheat the melt above its freezing temperature in preparation for tapping. More slag formers are introduced and more oxygen is blown into the bath, burning out impurities such as silicon, sulfur, phosphorus, aluminium, manganese, and calcium, and removing their oxides to the slag. Removal of carbon takes place after these elements have burnt out first, as they have a greater affinity for oxygen. Metals that have a poorer affinity for oxygen than iron, such as nickel and copper, cannot be removed through oxidation and must be controlled through scrap chemistry alone, such as introducing the direct reduced iron and pig iron mentioned earlier. A foaming slag is maintained throughout, and often overflows the furnace to pour out of the slag door into the slag pit. Temperature sampling and chemical sampling take place via automatic lances. Oxygen and carbon can be automatically measured via special probes that dip into the steel, but for all other elements, a [...] "chill" [...] sample—a small, solidified sample of the steel—is analysed on an arc-emission spectrometer.|$|E
40|$|There is {{considered}} the power operating mode of a high-power arc steelmaking furnaces (ASMF) {{in the period of}} the <b>flat</b> <b>bath.</b> It is revealed that electric energy is mainly spent for heating and overheating the foamed slag. Heat transferring from slag to metal is carried out by the convective agitation of the bath. For agitation there is used intensive purging of the bath with oxygen that causes increased iron losses with the running foamed slag. There are noted the negative points of working with the foamed slag. It is recommended to expand R&D in the field of optimizing the power operating mode of high-power ASMF...|$|E
50|$|In May 2009, it was {{alleged that}} the small <b>flat</b> in <b>Bath</b> that Lord Truscott calls his main {{residence}} was unoccupied and looked deserted. Classifying this flat as his main residence had entitled him to claim an annual £28,000 per year public subsidy of his £700,000 Mayfair flat, amounting to £125,000 over four years.|$|R
50|$|Truscott {{was educated}} at Exeter College, University of Oxford. He {{received}} a BA {{in modern history}} in 1981, followed by an DPhil in 1985. In 1991, he met and rapidly married Svetlana Chernikov, daughter of a Red Army colonel. By 2008, the couple owned a £1 million apartment in Mayfair, a <b>flat</b> in <b>Bath</b> and property in Russia.|$|R

40|$|The WORCRA technology, {{developed}} by Womer {{and his team}} in the 60 s and 70 s, demonstrated at a 10 tph scale that highly refined steel could be made continuously in one furnace by combining an electric melting bowl with a oxygen refining channel. Modern EAF processes that utilise semicontinuous feed and <b>flat</b> <b>bath</b> operation contain many of the features present in the WORCRA technology. The increasing demand for high quality products and high productivity from EAF steelmakers suggests that continuous electric steelmaking may have some future. This paper shall discuss the theoretical and practical problems associated with developing continuous electric steelmaking {{into the next century}} based on the experience from the earlier work and more recent research into continuous steelmaking...|$|E
40|$|Synopsis: {{increasing}} {{the production rate}} of an Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) while also lowering overall cost can be a difficult challenge. The current situation at OneSteel in Australia is natural gas is less expensive than electricity to melt steel. The question then becomes {{how to use the}} natural gas efficiently. During the bore in and melting stages of the first and second buckets of scrap, the transfer of energy from the gas burners to the scrap metal is very high. Once the scrap has partially melted and a <b>flat</b> <b>bath</b> is obtained, the energy transfer drops dramatically. Determining the optimum time to turn off the gas burners to obtain maximum energy efficiency became the goal. GrafTech International's ArchiTech system can be used to measure electrical harmonics generated by the arc in the furnace. As the scrap is melted in the furnace, the harmonics generated decrease. OneSteel and GrafTech used this signal to develop a control loop to determine when to turn off the burners allowing them to maximize production rates. Power on time decreased, allowing for higher production rates and lower energy costs. Other consumables, such as graphite electrodes and refractory consumption should also decrease...|$|E
50|$|In February 2009, it was {{revealed}} that Truscott was, in line with House of Lords rules, classifying his small <b>Bath</b> <b>flat</b> as his main residence, thus entitling him to claim a £28,000 per year public subsidy of his £700,000 Mayfair flat.|$|R
50|$|In 1947, an {{alarming}} 4,218 Queensland families {{were living in}} homes made from calico, canvas or hessian. Some even lived in makeshift bark shelters. To meet the demand for housing, the Queensland Housing Commission started building the State's first rental homes. Public housing rent was called 'economic rent' and was calculated by a formula which took into account elements such as {{the cost to the}} Commission {{of the house and the}} loan, maintenance and administration. No Australian family was expected to pay more than a fifth of their weekly income in rent, so rebates were introduced and still exist today. During the late 1940s, the Commission had thousands of workers under contract or on day labour teams working to build brick, timber and fibro houses for Queenslanders to rent. At the same time, it converted ex-wartime barracks into temporary accommodation for families in need. The camps provided rustic and sometimes unsuitable accommodation - they were army barracks converted into small <b>flats.</b> <b>Bath</b> and laundry facilities were communal. The communities held boxing and cricket matches, and dances. For kids, camp life meant a constant supply of playmates.|$|R
50|$|Baby on the Move sells {{a variety}} of baby safety equipment, {{including}} car seats and restraints for infants. Other products include portable cots, <b>flat</b> folding <b>baths,</b> stainless steel baby bottles, buggies, bassinets, infant capsules with bases, exersaucers, toddler seats, cots, monitors, and safety gates for doorways.

50|$|There {{are three}} main halls of {{residence}} in Wrexham, namely the Student village, Wrexham Village and Snowdon Hall as well as Corbishley Hall at Northop. The main student village is separated into houses and the houses into <b>flats.</b> Snowdon Hall, <b>Bath</b> Road and Clwyd House are near Wrexham town. The student village and Snowdon Hall are en suite and the rest are shared facilities. All of WGU's accommodation is self-catering. Snowdon Hall is separated into five separate blocks of lockable flats and is currently leased from and run by the Opal Group.|$|R
50|$|In March, Flakey Dove {{appeared}} for {{the first}} time at the Cheltenham Festival. She started a 50/1 outsider for the Champion Hurdle and finished seventh of the eighteen runners behind Granville Again. She then finished second in a handicap hurdle at Ascot and fourth in a flat race at Nottingham. On 1 May, Flakey Dove recorded her best win up to that time when she defeated the former Champion Hurdler Beech Road in the Staffordshire Hurdle at Uttoxeter Racecourse. Two days later she finished unplaced in the Swinton Hurdle before ending the season by finishing eighth in a <b>flat</b> race at <b>Bath.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Morrisons Bay {{is named}} after Archibald Morrison, a soldier who {{received}} a land grant in 1795 of 55 acres. One of the colony's wealthiest settlers, Captain William Raven, owned 100 acres that ran between Glades Bay to Morrisons Bay. The land was subdivided in 1887. Named after Lord Alfred Tennyson, the Tennyson Estate was promoted as having front seat views to the Championship rowing course. [...] Two world Champion rowers, Beach (1884) and Kemp (1887) have streets named after them. The Eastern side of Morrison’s Bay was a textile mill, the Head of bay is a reclaimed mangrove <b>flat</b> and River <b>baths</b> were established 1918.|$|R
60|$|Groby stood it {{for about}} two and a quarter minutes, and then made his way through the {{corridor}} into Spabbink's room. Under Groby's vigorous measures the musician's flabby, redundant figure sat up in bewildered semi-consciousness like an ice-cream that has been taught to beg. Groby prodded him into complete wakefulness, and then the pettish self-satisfied pianist fairly lost his temper and slapped his domineering visitant on the hand. In another moment Spabbink was being nearly stifled and very effectually gagged by a pillow-case tightly bound round his head, while his plump pyjama'd limbs were hauled out of bed and smacked, pinched, kicked, and bumped in a catch-as-catch-can progress across the floor, towards the <b>flat</b> shallow <b>bath</b> in whose utterly inadequate depths Groby perseveringly strove to drown him. For a few moments the room was almost in darkness: Groby's candle had overturned in an early stage of the scuffle, and its flicker scarcely reached to the spot where splashings, smacks, muffled cries, and splutterings, and a chatter of ape-like rage told of the struggle that was being waged round the shores of the bath. A few instants later the one-sided combat was brightly lit up by the flare of blazing curtains and rapidly kindling panelling.|$|R
40|$|We {{show that}} death by {{dissolution}} {{is an important}} size-dependent mortality factor for juvenile bivalves. Utilizing a new experimental design, {{we were able to}} replicate saturation states in sediments after values frequently encountered by Mercenaria mercenaria in coastal deposits (Varagonite 5 0. 4 and 0. 6). When 0. 2 -mm M. mercenaria were reared in sediments at Varagonite 5 0. 4 and 0. 6, significant daily losses of living individuals occurred (14. 0 % and 14. 4 % d 21, respectively), relative to supersaturated-control sediments (3. 9 % d 21). For 0. 4 -mm M. mercenaria, significant mortality occurred under the most undersaturated conditions (Varagonite 5 0. 4, mortality 5 9. 6 % d 21), although mortality at Varagonite 5 0. 6 was not significant (mortality 5 2. 7 % d 21; control-saturated mortality 5 0. 2 % d 21). For the largest size-class investigated, 0. 6 mm, we show significant mortality for clams under the most undersaturated sediments (Varagonite 5 0. 4, 2. 8 % d 21). To test if buffered sediments would increase survivorship of juvenile bivalves during periods of recruitment, we manually manipulated sediment saturation state by adding crushed Mya arenaria shell to a mud <b>flat</b> in West <b>Bath,</b> Maine, U. S. A. Although we increased the average sediment saturation state within retrieved cores from V 5 0. 25 6 0. 01 to only 0. 53 6 0. 06, numbers of live M. arenaria in buffered sediment increased almost three-fold in 2 weeks. Buffering muds against the metabolic acids that cause lowered saturation states may represent a potentially important managemen...|$|R
