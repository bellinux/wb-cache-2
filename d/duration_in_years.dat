50|$|Tobacco {{smoking is}} the main known {{contributor}} to urinary bladder cancer; in most populations, smoking is associated with over half of bladder cancer cases in men and one-third of cases among women, however these proportions have reduced over recent years since there are fewer smokers in Europe and North America. There is an almost linear relationship between smoking <b>duration</b> (<b>in</b> <b>years),</b> pack years and bladder cancer risk. A risk plateau at smoking about 15 cigarettes a day can be observed (meaning that those who smoke 15 cigarettes a day are approximately at the same risk as those smoking 30 cigarettes a day). Quitting smoking reduces the risk, however former smokers will most likely always be at {{a higher risk of}} bladder cancer compared to never smokers.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} drought {{scenarios}} of the Upper Colorado River Basin (UCRB) {{for the last}} five hundred years and evaluates the magnitude, severity and frequency of the current five-year drought. Hydrologic drought characteristics have been developed using the historical streamflow data and tree ring chronologies in the UCRB. Historical data include the Colorado River at Cisco and Lees Ferry, Green River, Palmer Hydrologic Drought Index (PHDI), and the Z index. Three ring chronologies were used from 17 spatially representative sites in the UCRB from NOAA 2 ̆ 7 s International Tree Ring Data. A PCA based regression model procedures was used to reconstruct drought indices and streamflow in the UCRB. Hydrologic drought is characterized by its <b>duration</b> (<b>duration</b> <b>in</b> <b>year</b> <b>in</b> which cumulative deficit is continuously below thresholds), deficit magnitude (the cumulative deficit below the thresholds for consecutive years), severity (magnitude divided by the duration) and frequency. Results indicate that the current drought ranks anywhere from the 5 th to 20 th worst drought during the period 1493 - 2004, depending on the drought indicator and magnitude. From a short term perspective (using annual data), the current drought is more severe than if longer term average (i. e., 5 or 10 year averages) are used to define the drought...|$|R
50|$|The STScI conducts all {{activities}} required to select, schedule, and implement the science programs of HST. The {{first step in}} this process is to support the annual community-led selection of the scientific programs that will be performed with HST. This begins with publishing of the annual Call for Proposals, which specifies the currently supported science instrument capabilities, proposal requirements and the submission deadline. Anyone is eligible to submit a proposal. All proposals are critically peer-reviewed by the Time Allocation Committee (TAC). The TAC consists of about 100 members of the U.S. and international astronomical community, selected to represent {{a broad range of}} research expertise needed to evaluate the proposals. Each proposal cycle typically involves reviewing 700 to 1100 proposals. Only 15 - 20% of these proposals will eventually be selected for implementation. The TAC reviews several categories of observing time, as well as proposals for archival, theoretical, and combined research projects between HST and other space-based or ground-based observatories (e.g., Chandra X-ray Observatory and the National Optical Astronomy Observatories). STScI provides all technical and logistical support for these activities.

The estimated LSPOL can be used to estimate post-fire aboveground biomass and carbon sequestration in areas where alternative information is dated or absent.

Numerous studies revealed controversial changes in the components of the immune system during attacks and the interictal period in migraine patients.

Patients had radiographically proven hand OA, and controls did not. Participants indicated frequency, duration, and details of their KC be-havior and known risk factors for hand OA. Results: The prevalence of KC among 215 respondents (135 patients, 80 controls) was 20 %. When examined in aggregate, the prevalence of OA in any joint was similar among those who crack knuckles (18. 1 %) {{and those who do}} not (21. 5 %; P. 548).

Based on our experience, we hypothesized {{that this is an}} economically viable option. Material and Methods: In this retrospective study, we included 90 patients who underwent upper extremity surgeries in our institute solely under ultrasound (USG) -guided brachial plexus blocks in a year. The cost of the block was derived by adding the cost of the material and drugs used for the block. This cost was subtracted from the cost that otherwise would have been incurred for general anesthesia (GA) of similar duration. This cost difference or benefit per case was then used to calculate the <b>duration</b> <b>in</b> <b>years</b> required to recover the cost of the ultrasound machine. Statistics: Data were analyzed using SPSS 15. 0. Analysis of variance was applied to compare mean benefits as per surgery, block, and duration. Ninety-five percent confidence interval for mean were calculated. Level of significance was taken as P = 0. 05. Results: There were significant economic benefits using ultrasound guidance as compared to GA. Benefits differed significantly as per the type of surgery, type of block, and duration of the surgery. With the cost benefit that we have obtained, the cost of USG machine can be recovered in about 3 years. Conclusion: USG regional anesthesia is an economically viable concept.
