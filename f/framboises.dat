40|$|Current active {{database}} management systems (ADBMS) are typically realized as monolithic, tightly integrated software systems. Separating the active database mechanisms from the DBMS, {{would open the}} opportunity to use them {{in a variety of}} ways and environments. In order to build the respective decoupled active database facilities, construction systems are required. The realization of such a construction system is investigated in the <b>FRAMBOISE</b> project. <b>FRAMBOISE</b> is used to build a "ready-to-run" software system that allows the definition and execution of active database mechanisms in the context of specific DBMSs. It comprises specification mechanisms, construction tools and an object-oriented framework that provides implemented components realizing specific ADBMS tasks.
