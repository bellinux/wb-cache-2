40|$|AbstractUnderground constructions, such as shafts, courtain walls, foundations, {{pipes and}} tunnels, use {{structural}} {{elements that are}} supported by a <b>geological</b> <b>medium</b> (soil or rock) or are used to support the <b>geological</b> <b>medium</b> loads. If the <b>geological</b> <b>medium</b> is unable to react under tension, the structural element is subjected to unilateral contact constraints and, during the deformation process, may loose contact with the surrounding medium at one or more regions. The present work proposes an alternative numerical methodology for the geometrically nonlinear analysis of structural systems under unilateral contact constraints. The nonlinear problem involves {{two different types of}} variables: the displacement field and the length and position of the contact regions. In order to solve the resulting algebraic nonlinear equations with contact constraints and obtain the structural equilibrium configuration, the present work proposes a two-level iteration solution strategy at each load step. The first solves the contact problem as a linear complementary problem using Lemke’s algorithm. The second updates the displacement field. A nonlinear beam-column element is used to model the structure, while a bed of springs is used to model the <b>geological</b> <b>medium.</b> The use of an updated Lagrangian formulation, together with continuation and optimization techniques minimize the errors along the equilibrium paths and enables one to trace convoluted non-linear equilibrium paths with a varying number of contact regions. Special attention is given to the behavior of curved unidimensional support systems such as arches and rings. The nonlinear behavior of four such support systems is studied. The results clarify the influence of the foundation position (above or below the structure) and its stiffness on the nonlinear behavior and stability of curved structures. Comparison of the present results with those found in literature demonstrates the accuracy and versatility of the proposed numerical strategy in the analysis of structural elements with unilateral contact constraints...|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} reduce global {{atmospheric}} greenhouse gas emissions, many pilot-scale and commercial-scale Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) projects are under development or are operating commercially. There are two main recognized potential leakage mechanisms which may allow CO 2 to leak out of the intended storage complex, migrate into overlying aquifers and eventually seep back to the near-surface and atmosphere, with potentially negative impacts upon natural resources and/or the environment. The primary potential leakage pathway is via wellbores, which may provide a direct connection between the storage formation and the surface. Should a well integrity related leak occur, established remediation techniques may be employed to mitigate and/or remediate further leakage. A second potential leakage pathway includes fluid migration through geological faults, fractures and high permeability zones within a caprock. Not only is {{it more difficult to}} constrain and characterize these leaks, there is currently no routine method available to intercept and repair solution leakage via such pathways. This experimental study was conducted to assess the injection of chemical solutions capable of physically and chemically interacting with a CO 2 - containing brine to form a geochemically stable blocking agent capable of preventing further fluid leakage. A number of potential blocking agents were evaluated, and experiments were carried out under quasi formation conditions (i. e. elevated pressure and temperature) using a combination of simulated 2 D caprock micromodels and 3 D <b>geological</b> porous <b>medium</b> core floods. Experiments succeeded in determining the behaviour of the blocking agent, CO 2 saturated brine behaviour, reaction front location, the concentration and amount of blocking agent required and an indicative timescale for remediation.

40|$|This study utilises a {{range of}} {{techniques}} to investigate the feasibility of the geological storage of carbon dioxide. Three specific themes were addressed. Saline aquifers have been proposed as an attractive <b>geological</b> storage <b>medium</b> due to the theoretical storage capacity offered, despite the poor {{quality and quantity of}} date available to appraise them. Published methodologies are numerous, which attempt to refine the uncertainty by the introduction of capacity coefficients producing estimates with a variance of up to five orders of magnitude. The source of this uncertainty is investigated using Monte Carlo based sensitivity on a North Sea case study site. This shows the limitations and sources of error inherent in the application of such method. A new method is proposed to account for the limited available input data. Injectivity of geological reservoirs has been highlighted as a potential setback for CO 2 storage. Reservoir hosted compartmentalising membrane seals are shown to permit CO 2 migration without compromising storage integrity in three North Sea examples. The presence of oil as a wetting fluid in the substrate significantly reduces the capillary entry pressure of a membrane seal as a product of CO 2 water contact angle of cos 85 ° to cos 90 °. Cross fault flow rates are shown to be on operational timescales. CO 2 storage projects have been cancelled as a consequence of public objection. Public Engagement has been proven to affect the public’s perception of CCS in both positive and negative directions by facilitating informed decision making.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Characterization of Excavation Damaged Zone (EDZ) {{around an}} {{underground}} excavation {{is a major}} research topic for deep <b>geological</b> disposal of <b>medium</b> to high level radioactive waste. Rock fracturing due to excavation and thermal loading and its resultant rock mass permeability change in the EDZ are important aspects in the EDZ characterisation. A new function to predict rock mass permeability change in fractured rocks has been developed and added into the existing fracture mechanics code FRACOD. The new functions in FRACOD {{has been applied to}} predict the extent of EDZ and permeability change {{in the vicinity of the}} TSX tunnel of URL (Canada), the ZEDEX tunnel of the Äspö Hard Rock Laboratory (Sweden) and the deposition tunnels in crystalline and sedimentary rocks (Japan). The predicted the EDZ and its permeability are consistent with the measurement data of the TSX tunnel. In the validation test against the ZEDEX tunnel results, a broad agreement between the FRACOD prediction and measurements has been achieved. The results from both tests indicate that FRACOD with the new function is capable of realistically predicting the EDZ and permeability change. Following the validation tests FRACOD is applied to studying the EDZ of conceptual deposition tunnels for radioactive waste in Japan. ...|$|R
40|$|Recently, metal {{nanoparticles}} {{have attracted}} the attention of researchers in several fields of study due to their high surface area and other unique properties. Using metal nanoparticles as a component of an in situ chemical oxidation (ISCO) system is emerging and hence very little information is available. In this research, nano zero valent iron (nZVI) particles and iron-based bimetallic zero valent nanoparticles (BZVNs) were employed to activate some common peroxygens (hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2), persulfate (S 2 O 82 -), and peroxymonosulfate (HSO 5 -)) to degrade hazardous organic compounds. Aqueous and soil slurry batch systems were used along with a one-dimensional physical model. The results from the aqueous batch systems showed that nZVI is a promising activator for S 2 O 82 - compared to other conventional iron activators (e. g., granular-ZVI and Fe 2 +). For example, the initial trichloroethylene (TCE) reaction rate by nZVI activated S 2 O 82 - was 1. 11 x 10 - 4 M L- 1 min- 1 compared to an initial reaction rate of 6. 25 x 10 - 5 M L- 1 min- 1, 5. 18 x 10 - 6 M L- 1 min- 1, and 1. 8 x 10 - 7 M L- 1 min- 1 for Fe 2 + activated S 2 O 82 -, granular-ZVI activated S 2 O 82 -, and non-activated S 2 O 82 -, respectively. However, the surfaces of nZVI particles were passivated quickly following exposure to S 2 O 82 -, causing the reaction rate to reduce to a magnitude representative of an un-activated S 2 O 82 - system. An iron-sulfate (FeSO 4) complex was formed on the surfaces of the nZVI particles following exposure to S 2 O 82 - compared to the iron oxyhydroxide (FeOOH) layer that was present on fresh nZVI surfaces. BZVNs showed better treatment effectiveness than nZVI particles as activators for H 2 O 2, S 2 O 82 -, and HSO 5 -. For example, the TCE reaction rate constant for nano-Ag-Fe 0 activated H 2 O 2 was 9 to 18 fold higher than that for nZVI activated H 2 O 2. Of the nine different BZVNs investigated as activators, the greatest TCE degradation was achieved by nano-Pd-Fe 0 and nano-Zn-Fe 0 activated S 2 O 82 - system, nano-Co-Fe 0 activated HSO 5 - system, and nano-Ag-Fe 0 activated H 2 O 2 system. For all of these systems, an increase in the dosage of nanoparticles and peroxygens increased TCE degradation. The activated H 2 O 2 system showed a lower TCE degradation rate compared to either the activated S 2 O 82 - or the activated HSO 5 - systems, suggesting that a bridged group complex is formed between the activators and H 2 O 2. The dissolved TCE concentration remaining in the soil slurry batch systems after using the nano-Pd-Fe 0 activated S 2 O 82 - system was two to three fold higher than that in an aqueous batch system. Furthermore, for five different aquifer materials used, the higher mass of aquifer materials the lower the TCE degradation, indicating that the aquifer materials compete with a target organic compound in the presence of activated S 2 O 82 -. A linear relationship was observed between the organic carbon (OC) content and the initial TCE decomposition rate. Although there is no direct evidence of the effect of OC on the treatment system, it is suggested that the OC may result in scavenging the generated free radicals or by directly consuming persulfate. In the one-dimensional physical model systems, bimetallic nanoparticles were mobile in a non-geological porous medium and relatively immobile in a <b>geological</b> porous <b>medium.</b> In the non-geological porous medium, we found that adding a second metal (e. g., Pd) to nano-Fe 0 particles significantly improved their functionality and performance (e. g., mobility and suspension). For example, the results from mobility experiments using columns packed with glass beads showed that the effluent iron concentration was < 6 % of the influent iron concentration for the nano-Fe 0 particles, while it was ~ 100 % for the nano-Pd-Fe 0 particles. In the <b>geological</b> porous <b>medium,</b> based on visual inspection, nano-Pd-Fe 0 particles could not travel more than a few centimeters into columns packed with CFB Borden sand, and no iron was detected in the effluent. To overcome the delivery issue in porous media, nano-Pd-Fe 0 particles were injected to create a zone of activation to activate S 2 O 82 - for the treatment of TCE source zone. However, we found that the TCE mass destruction was only 9 % higher in the nano-Pd-Fe 0 activated S 2 O 82 - system compared to the non-activated S 2 O 82 - system as revealed by the effluent chloride concentration. In addition, the activation zone composed of nano-Pd-Fe 0 particles was rapidly deactivated after exposure to persulfate as visually observed by color change, indicating that the longevity of the activation zone is limited. This research effort provides a contribution to the field of ISCO by evaluating the potential utility and applicability of a new class of activators for some common peroxygens...|$|R
40|$|A {{debatable}} {{problem of}} the display of induced seismicity and its causes during the construction of reservoirs (Reservoir Induced Seismicity - RIS) is considered {{on the basis of}} an analysis of various publications. This paper describes the history of the evolution of ideas about the possibility of the activation of seismic events in the zones of influence of artificial reservoirs and examples of such activation in aseismic areas, which is a <b>medium</b> <b>geological</b> response to technogenic interference (e. g. Shivajisagar reservoir in West India, Mead reservoir in the USA, Danjiangkou Reservoir in central China, Nurek reservoir in Central Asia, Chirkey reservoir in Dagestan and other). The problem and reasons of induced seismicity (RIS) are debatable. however, published examples demonstrate the existence of this process. For reservoirs with different amounts of water RIS is an inseparable component of the natural and man-made geological process. The world statistics knows cases of seismicity intensification in areas near small man-made reservoirs with low pressure levels (Belecha in former Yugoslavia, Marathon in Greece, Grandval in France). In addition, {{it was found that the}} number of local earthquakes increased after creating a cascade of three small water reservoirs (Studen Kladenets, Kardzhali and Ivaylovgrad) in the basin of The Arda river (Bulgaria). The RIS examples listed above allow us to think that it is not only the creation of large reservoirs that change (in some cases, intensifies) the local seismicity in the surrounding area. No reservoir, no matter what size it is, is insured from such geological process. At the present time there are more than 100 places in the world with displays of induced seismicity due to reservoir construction. In India there are up to eight reservoirs with these problems. Induced seismicity associated with the influence of man-made water reservoirs, causes a specific geo-ecological risks to the surrounding areas...|$|R

40|$|Natural-science {{concepts}} of rotational movements and the ‘lumpy’ structure of medium are reviewed {{with a focus}} on key aspects. Through using torsional traps for hunting and «implementing» mechanical torque for ignition, Homo sapiens developed to man. Vortex movements «impregnated» in spiral structures of shells and torsional movements of toothy whales and fish were intuitively perceived by man as major stable movements of the environment. Based on the above, the ancient philosophy established the concept of the uniform world represented by atomic («noncuttable») structure of medium and vortex movements of ether. Based on conclusive arguments stated by R. Dekart, H. Helmgolz, Lord Kelvin and others within the framework of classical physics and {{in the first half of}} the 20 th century by scientists in quantum physics and cosmogony, both «quantum structure» («lumpiness») and rotation («vorticity») are integral features of matter – space – time throughout the whole range from elementary particles to galaxies and galactic clusters. Nowadays researchers in natural sciences, particularly in the Earth sciences, call attention again to the problem of structure of matter and its movements. In the 1920 s, Chinese geologist Li Siguang established fundamentals of vortex geodynamics. In the second half of the 20 th century, Li Siguan’s concepts were developed by geologists O. I. Slenzak and I. V. Melekestsev. Geologist A. V. Peive, mechanic L. I. Sedov and physicist M. A. Sadovsky put forward a concept of block structure of the geo-medium (<b>geological</b> and geophysical <b>medium)</b> and proposed a justified assumption that such blocks can move by own torque. This method of movement is confirmed by results of geological and tectonophysical studies, as well as instrumental geophysical measurements obtained from a variety of stations and focal zones of strong earthquakes. Many researchers, including W. Elsasser and V. N. Nikolaevsky, develop fundamentals of nonlinear wave mechanics of the geo-medium, admitting rotational movements of blocks. According to М. V. Stovas, V. Е. Khain and other researchers, rotation of the planet around its axis is of critical importance for understating the origin of geodynamic movements. Based on the review of results from the previous comprehensive geological and geophysical studies, a conclusion is made on the torque origin of rotating block geo-medium which is termed as Peive–Sedov–Sadovsky medium. Analyses of migration of earthquake foci and volcanic eruptions and movements of edges of tectonic plates provided grounds to design a principally new model, and this rotational model is described in the present publication. Blocks and plates interacting with each other in the model are interrelated by long-range elastic fields which comprise a uniform planetary geodynamic medium, i. e. ‘self-consistent’ state of the geo-medium. Briefly reviewed are data about vortex geological structures and rotary motions of blocks and plates; such data have been detected and recorded in abundance in a variety of geophysical fields. It is stressed that similar, in principle, vortex movements / flows are solutions of the well known Dirichlet–Dedekind–Riemann problem of rotating and gravitating liquid drop that is the problem of the Earth’s equilibrium shape. According to the proposed rotational model, geodynamic solutions of the rotational model combine geodynamic flows in the solution of the problem of the Earth’s equilibrium shape and geologic-geophysical vortex structures and movements on the Earth’s surface in one and the same class of phenomena. It is proposed to apply such solutions for establishing a new geological paradigm – new torque (and/or wave / vortex) geodynamics. </p...|$|R

40|$|Undoubtedly, modern geoelectric {{technologies}} {{emerge in}} {{the result of the}} development of traditional approaches and techniques. However of more interest is the appearance of completely new technologies based on new effects and new models of interaction of <b>geological</b> <b>medium</b> and electromagnetic field. The author does not commit to indicate principally new directions, but only wants to discuss some poorly known facts from the theory and practice of geoelectrics. The outcome of this study could be considered attracting the attention of experts to non-traditional signals in geoelectrics. The reviewed phenomena of interest, not fully implemented in practice in the author’s opinion, are field split into two polarizations: transverse electric (the ТЕ-field) and transverse magnetic (the ТМ-field), then some poorly known properties of ТМ-field, the role of bias currents, the anisotropy of horizontal resistances, the role of geomagnetic field in geoelectric sounding, the unique resolution of CSEM (Controlled Source Electro-Magnetic) techniques at sea...|$|E
40|$|The {{long-term}} {{safety of}} a CO 2 geological storage relies on {{the stability of the}} reservoir and on a proper assessment of CO 2 leakage and fluids displacement. Particular attention must be addressed to the injection wellbore as a human-made discontinuity of the <b>geological</b> <b>medium,</b> especially the caprock. Thus, the chemical and mechanical integrity of the Well-Reservoir-Caprock cement sealing must be insured for the whole lifetime of a CCS project. These aspects are investigated following a 2 -step approach within the Project INTERFACE (supported by French Research National Agency ANR through the Captage et stockage du CO 2 program). First, a geochemical model of the interface is developed that predicts the mechanisms of cement chemical alteration due to the interaction with the acid brine. Then, geomechanical simulations are run based on main results such as phase changes and cement porosity evolution. Herein, the focus is on geochemical aspects solely...|$|E
30|$|An {{additional}} {{property of}} Rn gas is its recoil energy, which enables it to migrate varying distances in porous and permeable media, thus {{allowing it to}} escape into the atmosphere from the subsurface. The migration and the transport of Rn from a geological formation into its surroundings depend {{on the structure of}} the <b>geological</b> <b>medium</b> and its permeability and porosity. Its movement also depends on the grain packing in rocks, the type of crystal lattice and granite types in the study area (Kobeissi et al. 2013), surface and subsurface characteristics, the soil moisture content in different types of rocks, and soil-air pressure differences. An additional property of Rn is its solubility in ground water, which allows it to be transported to greater distances, while its half-life might not allow it to do so. All these factors must be taken into consideration when Rn is used as a precursor for the occurrence of earthquakes and the interpretation of data.|$|E
40|$|Cases {{of damage}} to {{structures}} in landslide areas in Poland, and sometimes construction catastrophes, occur most frequently in periods of intense precipitation (e. g. in 1997, 2000, 2002 and 2010). The greatest landslide risk occurs in mountainous areas in the Flysch Carpathians, {{and the number of}} landslides posing major problems exceeds 20, 000. Terrain surface relief and geological structure including the tectonics, properties of the <b>geological</b> <b>medium,</b> presence of excessive water mostly due to intense precipitation, and human activity have an impact on landslide risk. This paper is aimed at presenting basic principles for the geophysical identification of landslides gained from experience in various regions of Poland, particularly in the flysch formations in the Carpathian Mountains. The geophysical methods which are of the greatest importance in the study of landslides are specified. Their advantages and limitations are presented. The principles of geophysical methods applied at the stage of designing and implementing research, processing and interpreting data, analysis of results, and their documentation are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Tilt {{measurements}} {{have been}} taken in the underground gallery at Talaya Seismological Station for almost three decades, from March 1985 till 2014. Based on such data, deformation curves were constructed and analysed {{in the frame of}} elastic and viscous-elastic models of the <b>geological</b> <b>medium.</b> From estimated annual deformation rates, it became possible to reveal deformation cycles ranging from 3 to 18 years with amplitudes up to 5 arc-seconds (2 · 10 – 5). For the bedrock in the Talaya stream valley, the elastic modulus was estimated at 20 GPa. In frame of the Kelvin viscoelastic model, the apparent viscosity of the medium was estimated at 1019 Pa·sec by deformation delay curve for 1989 – 2014 epoch. Observed vertical rates were used to estimate the size of the studied area (from 0. 1 km to 6. 0 km). The values estimated in our experimental investigation are used {{in a wide range of}} geophysical studies: modelling tectonic, co-seismic and post-seismic processes. </span...|$|E
40|$|In {{the current}} energy grid, {{renewable}} energy has an increasing role to play. However, their intermittence cannot afford {{to regulate the}} produced electricity according to the irregular demand (Evans et al., 2012). Pumped Storage Hydroelectricity (PSH) is a well-known efficient technology to store and release electricity according to the demand needs but appropriate potential new sites are getting scarce (Steffen, 2012). An innovative alternative consists in using abandoned mines as lower reservoir of an Underground Pumping Storage Hydroelectricity (UPSH) plant. In such configuration, large amount of water will be pumped or injected in underground cavities, creating subsequently head oscillations in the surrounding aquifers. Consequently, this seepage occurring between the considered cavity and the varying groundwater heads in the surrounding <b>geological</b> <b>medium</b> may influence {{the efficiency of the}} UPSH plant but also the magnitude of the potential impacts on the groundwater resources. A hybrid 3 D finite element mixing cell method (Brouyère et al., 2009) is used to simulate numerically the use of a representative UPSH cavity and calculate the induced changes in groundwater heads in the surrounding <b>geological</b> <b>medium.</b> Different scenarios are computed varying parameter values (hydrogeological and lower reservoir characteristics), boundary conditions, and pumping/injection time-sequences. By analyzing the computed piezometric heads at different distances from the underground reservoir, the magnitude of the aquifer response to pumping storage operations is assessed. The most expected and noticeable effect is the oscillation of groundwater levels. The existence a mean pseudo/ dynamic steady-state and the required time to reach it are also determined. The head difference and its time evolution between the cavity and the surrounding medium is triggering the leakage of groundwater into the cavity or the contrary. The resulting effects on the UPSH plant efficiency can be estimated. Combining these outcomes, some feasibility criteria of this type of projects are identified. Going into practice, further models should include more in de-tails local and specific geometrical and hydrogeolog-ical data of the considered old mine cavities used as lower reservoir. This kind of modelling approach {{can be used as a}} first approach for determining how the aquifer will response to short and long term changes in UPSH pumping/injection schemes.
