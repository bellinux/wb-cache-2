5|$|The City of Windsor also hired New York traffic {{consultant}} Sam Schwartz {{to design}} a parkway to the border. Schwartz's proposal would eventually <b>inspire</b> <b>the</b> DRIC's own design, but his route was not chosen, with the DRIC opting instead to take a northern route.|$|E
5|$|The card-based {{gameplay}} of Chain of Memories {{would later}} serve to <b>inspire</b> <b>the</b> gameplay of Jupiter's next game, The World Ends with You; originally, the team envisioned a similar card game-based system {{taking place on}} the lower screen of the Nintendo DS, but eventually this morphed to a battle system taking place on both screens, with a card game controlled on the upper screen.|$|E

50|$|Additionally, {{the story}} of Orpheus and Eurydice {{is the basis of}} a play by Sarah Ruhl. It <b>inspired</b> <b>the</b> 1959 film Black Orpheus by Marcel Camus. <b>The</b> myth also <b>inspired</b> <b>the</b> American playwright Tennessee Williams' 1957 drama Orpheus Descending.|$|R
5|$|The {{process of}} thought behind the Compilation would later <b>inspire</b> <b>the</b> {{creation}} of Fabula Nova Crystallis Final Fantasy, a subseries of games linked {{by a common}} mythos, and would use {{lessons learned from the}} Compilation production process. On an individual level, Before Crisiss popularity would <b>inspire</b> <b>the</b> creation of another mobile title within the Fabula Nova Crystallis subseries: originally titled Final Fantasy Agito XIII, it would later change platforms and be renamed Final Fantasy Type-0.

The high level of noise was pertinent to their function of playing on the battlefield to <b>inspire</b> <b>the</b> soldiers. The focus in these bands was on percussion. A full mehterân could include several bass drums, multiple pairs of cymbals, small kettledrums, triangles, tambourines, and one or more Turkish crescents.|$|E

5|$|Two {{different}} kinds of spouge were popular in the 1960s, raw spouge (Draytons Two style) and dragon spouge (Cassius Clay style). The spouge industry grew immensely {{by the end of}} the 1970s, and produced popular stars like Blue Rhythm Combo, the Draytons Two and The Troubadours. Recent years has seen a resurgence of interest in spouge among some quarters, with people like Desmond Weekes of the Draytons Two indicating that spouge should be encouraged because it is a national form that can reach international audiences and <b>inspire</b> <b>the</b> nation's pride in their cultural heritage.|$|E
5|$|Media {{scholar and}} folklorist Andrew Peck {{attributes}} {{the success of}} the Slender Man to its highly collaborative nature. Because the character and its motives are shrouded in mystery, users can easily adapt existing Slender Man tropes and imagery to create new stories. This ability for users to tap into the ideas of others while also supplying their own helped <b>inspire</b> <b>the</b> collaborative culture that arose surrounding the Slender Man. Instead of privileging the choices of certain creators as canonical, this collaborative culture informally locates ownership of the creature across the community. In these respects, the Slender Man is similar to campfire stories or urban legends, and the character's success comes from enabling both social interaction and personal acts of creative expression.|$|E
5|$|New gods {{continued}} to emerge after this transformation. Some important deities like Isis and Amun {{are not known}} to have appeared until the Old Kingdom (c. 2686–2181 BC). Places and concepts could suddenly <b>inspire</b> <b>the</b> creation of a deity to represent them, and deities were sometimes created to serve as opposite-sex counterparts to established gods or goddesses. Kings {{were said to be}} divine, although only a few {{continued to}} be worshipped long after their deaths. Some non-royal humans were said to have the favor of the gods and were venerated accordingly. This veneration was usually short-lived, but the court architects Imhotep and Amenhotep son of Hapu were regarded as gods centuries after their lifetimes, as were some other officials.|$|E
