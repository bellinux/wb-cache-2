40|$|ABSTRACT Twenty {{female and}} twenty male broad breasted turkeys were raised to 18 weeks and 20 weeks, respectively. <b>D-alpha</b> <b>tocopherol</b> <b>acetate</b> was {{supplemented}} in vivo from 12 weeks to slaughter through diet (100 IU/kg feed) or through biweekly subcutaneous injections. Storage stability of meat was {{evaluated by the}} 2 -thiobarbituric acid test (TBA). Samples of breast meat, thigh meat, and mechanically deboned turkey meat (MDTM) were held at 4 C up to six days and stored at — 18 C up to three months. Loaves formulated from breast meat and MDTM were foil wrapped, vacuum sealed, and either held at 4 C one week or stored at — 18 C up to six months. Stored loaves were evaluated raw and after cooking. TBA numbers were consistently lower for tocopherol supplemented turkey meat than for con-trol meat. Dietary supplementation was more effective than injections for maintaining low TBA numbers. TBA numbers of meat types increased from breast meat to MDTM to thigh meat, and TBA numbers of each type increased over time. Meat from females generally had TBA numbers lower than meat from males. Meat loaves prepared from tocopherol supplemented meat had TBA numbers lower than con-trol loaves for both storage conditions. Loaves vacuum packaged had TBA numbers lower than those foil wrapped. Both packaging conditions resulted in increased TBA numbers with cooking and storage time at — 18 C. Tocopherol supplementation increased the storage stability as evaluated by the TBA test for all evaluated meat types (including loaves) and storage conditions. Vacuum packaging further im-proved stability of loaves...|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} the protective value of quercetin, gossypin, Hippophae rhamnoides (HR) flavone and <b>tocopherol</b> <b>acetate</b> against the systemic toxicity of percutaneously administered sulphur mustard (SM) in mice. Materials and Methods: Quercetin, gossypin, HR flavone or <b>tocopherol</b> <b>acetate</b> (200 mg/kg, i. p.) were administered just before percutaneous administration of SM and {{protection against the}} SM lethality was evaluated. In another experiment quercetin, gossypin, HR flavone or <b>tocopherol</b> <b>acetate</b> were administered against 2 LD 50 SM. The animals were sacrificed seven days post SM administration and various biochemical parameters were estimated. Results: The protection against the lethality of SM was very good with the flavonoids (quercetin = 4. 7 folds; gossypin = 6. 7 folds and HR flavone = 5. 6 folds), compared to no protection with <b>tocopherol</b> <b>acetate</b> (0. 7 fold). SM (2 LD 50) showed decrease in reduced and oxidised glutathione (GSH and GSSG) levels, {{and an increase in}} malondialdehyde level (MDA). Oxidative stress enzymes like glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase and superoxide dismutase were significantly decreased. The total antioxidant status was also significantly decreased. Additionally, there was a significant increase in red blood corpuscles and hemoglobin content. All the flavonoids significantly protected the GSH, GSSG and MDA, and also the hematological variables. <b>Tocopherol</b> <b>acetate</b> failed to offer any protection in those parameters. Gossypin protected glutathione peroxidase, while HR flavone protected both glutathione reductase and glutathione peroxidase significantly. The decrease in body weight induced by SM and the histological lesions in liver and spleen were also significantly protected by the flavonoids but not by <b>tocopherol</b> <b>acetate.</b> Conclusion: The present study supports that SM induces oxidative stress and flavonoids are promising cytoprotectants against this toxic effect...|$|R

After coating, agar diffusion test was performed as qualitative test to find out the sensitivity of coated stents against the clinical isolates, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Escherichia coli. Quantitative test was measured by calculating the numbers of adhered bacteria on coated and uncoated stents by incubating the stent pieces in artificial urine.

The present work presents a novel strategy to prevent the formation of a biofilm on polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) grafts. PTFE grafts were coated with gentamicin and teicoplanin incorporated into different lipid-like carriers under aseptic conditions in a dipping process. Poly-d,l-lactic acid, <b>tocopherol</b> <b>acetate,</b> the diglyceride Softisan 649, and the triglyceride Dynasan 118 were used as drug carriers. The drug release kinetics, anti-infective characteristics, biocompatibility, and hemocompatibility of the coatings developed were studied. All coatings showed an initial drug burst, followed by a low continuous drug release over 96 h. The dimension of release kinetics depended on the carrier used. All coated prostheses reduced bacterial growth drastically over 24 h, even below pathologically relevant concentrations. Different cytotoxic levels could be observed, revealing <b>tocopherol</b> <b>acetate</b> as the most promising biocompatible carrier. A possible reason for the highly cytotoxic effect of Softisan 649 could be assessed by demonstrating incorporated lipids in the cell soma with Oil Red O staining. Tromboelastography studies, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, and an amidolytic substrate assay could confirm the hemocompatibility of individual coatings. The development of the biodegradable drug delivery systems described here and in vitro studies of those systems highlight the most important requirements for effective as well as compatible anti-infective coatings of PTFE grafts. Through continuous local release, high drug levels can be produced at only the targeted area and physiological bacterial proliferation can be completely inhibited, while biocompatibility as well as hemocompatibility can be ensured...|$|R

Hence, {{the aim of this}} study was to test the effect of alpha tocopherol supplementation on monocyte function relevant to atherogenesis. Monocyte function was assessed in 21 healthy subjects at baseline, af-ter 8 wk of supplementation with <b>d-alpha</b> <b>tocopherol</b> (1, 200 IU/d) and after a 6 -wk washout phase. The release of reac-tive oxygen species (superoxide anion, hydrogen peroxide), lipid oxidation, release of the potentially atherogenic cyto-kine, interleukin 1 b, and monocyte-endothelial adhesion were studied in the resting state and after activation of the monocytes with lipopolysaccharide at 0, 8, and 14 wk. There was a 2. 5 -fold increase in plasma lipid–standardized and monocyte alpha tocopherol levels in the supplemented phase. After alpha tocopherol supplementation, there were significant decreases in release of reactive oxygen species, lipid oxidation, IL- 1 b secretion, and monocyte-endothelial cell adhesion, both in resting and activated cells compared with baseline and washout phases. Studies with the protein kinase C inhibitor, Calphostin C, suggest that the inhibition of reactive oxygen species release and lipid oxidation is due to an inhibition of protein kinase C activity by alpha to-copherol.

In this investigation differences in cutaneous sensation were detected by human participants between synthetic pyrethroids with a cyano group in the (S) -configuration of the 3 -phenoxybenzyl alcohol of their molecular structure (fenvalerate) {{and those that do}} not (permethrin). A strong relation was noted between insecticidal potency and degree of induced cutaneous sensation for the alpha-cyano and non-cyano pyrethroids, with a prominent difference between the two. No sensation was observed by any of the same participants on topical exposure to the inert ingredients of these agents. A linear correlation between concentration and degree of induced dysaethesia was observed for both pyrethroids. Regressing the cutaneous sensation on the common logarithm of concentration resulted in a regression equation of Y = 84. 0 + 31. 0 X 1 for fenvalerate and Y = 27. 5 + 15. 8 X 1 for permethrin. A highly efficacious therapeutic agent for pyrethroid exposure was noted to be dl-alpha <b>tocopherol</b> <b>acetate.</b> An impressive degree of inhibition of paraesthesia resulted from the topical application of vitamin E acetate, with a therapeutic index of almost 100 %...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Enriching {{poultry meat}} with {{long-chain}} n- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC n- 3 PUFA) can increase low population intakes of LC n- 3 PUFA, but fishy taints can spoil reheated meat. This experiment determined {{the effect of}} different amounts of LC n- 3 PUFA and vitamin E in the broiler diet on the fatty acid composition and sensory characteristics of the breast meat. Ross 308 broilers (120) were randomly allocated to one of five treatments from 21 to 42 days of age. Diets contained (g kg− 1) 0, 9 or 18 LC n- 3 PUFA (0 LC, 9 LC, 18 LC), and 100, 150 or 200 mg LD [...] <b>tocopherol</b> <b>acetate</b> kg− 1 (E). The five diets were 0 LC 100 E, 9 LC 100 E, 18 LC 100 E, 18 LC 150 E, 18 LC 200 E, with four pens per diet, except 18 LC 100 E (eight pens). Breast meat was analysed for fatty acids (uncooked) and sensory analysis by R-index (reheated). RESULTS: LC n- 3 PUFA content (mg kg− 1 meat) was 514 (0 LC 100 E) and 2236 (9 LC and 18 LC). Compared with 0 LC 100 E, meat from 18 LC 100 E and 18 LC 150 E tasted significantly different, while 23...|$|R

An evaluation for dermal cytotoxicity in albino rabbits yielded a slight increase in cutaneous perfusion as indicated both visually and by laser Doppler velocimetry.

40|$|The {{incidence}} of retained placenta (RP) in cows increases {{in cases of}} parturition induced by prostaglandin F 2 α. We analyzed the effects of different doses of supplemental selenium and vitamin E on the {{incidence of}} RP, blood selenium, plasma thyronines, and malondialdehyde concentration. Thirty-three clinically healthy, multiparous Holstein-Frisian cows were assigned to 3 groups and supplemented with a single intramuscular injection of sodium selenite (SS) and <b>tocopherol</b> <b>acetate</b> (TAc) between days 250 to 255 of gestation: control—unsupplemented; group A— 10 [*]mg SS + 400 [*]mg TAc; group B— 20 [*]mg SS + 800 [*]mg TAc. Parturition was induced using PGF 2 α not before day 275 of gestation. The RP incidence was reduced from 66. 7 % in the control to 38. 2 and 30. 8 % in groups A and B, respectively. Blood selenium and glutathione peroxidase activity in treated groups were significantly higher compared to control, with {{no significant difference between}} groups A and B. Plasma malondialdehyde in group B was significantly lower than that in control and group A, while thyronines levels were not affected. Comparison of RP and non-RP cows, independently of supplement treatment, revealed higher blood selenium and glutathione peroxidase activity and lower MDA and thyroxine in non-RP animals, while triiodothyronine level did not differ...|$|R
40|$|A new {{procedure}} at simulated frying {{conditions in}} our laboratory {{was developed to}} monitor frying stability of fats and oils. Water-conditioned silica was prepared and added to the fresh vegetable oil, which was heated for two hours at 170 °C. The oil stability at frying temperature was then evaluated by determining the amount of formed dimeric triglycerides The results obtained showed that {{the stability of the}} vegetable oils at frying temperature could not be explained by the fatty acid composition alone. Corn oil was observed to be more stable than soybean oil, and rapeseed oil was better than olive oil. It was also observed that crude, non-refined oils were found to have a better heat stability than refin-ed oils. To estimate the effectiveness of synthetic and naturally occurring antioxidants, namely various <b>tocopherols,</b> <b>tocopherol</b> <b>acetate</b> and phytosterol fractions, phenolic compounds like quercetin, oryzanol, ferulic acid, gallates, BHT, BHA and other compounds like ascorbic acid 6 -palmitate and squalene were added to refined sunflower and rape seed oil, and their oxidative stability at elevated temperature (OSET) values determined. Both linoleic and oleic rich oils gave comparable results for the activity of the various compounds. alpha-tocopherol, tocopherol esters and BHA had low effects on oil stability at frying temperature, while ascorbyl palmitate and some phytosterol fractions were found to have the most stabilizing activity under frying conditions...|$|R
40|$|Background : The B {{vitamins}} niacinamide and panthenol {{have been}} shown to reduce many signs of skin aging, including hyperpigmentation and redness. Aims : To measure the facial skin effects in Indian women of the daily use of a lotion containing niacinamide, panthenol, and <b>tocopherol</b> <b>acetate</b> using quantitative image analysis. Methods : Adult women 30 - 60 years of age with epidermal hyperpigmentation were recruited in Mumbai and randomly assigned to apply a test or control lotion to the face daily for 10 weeks. Effects on skin tone were measured using an image capturing system and associated software. Skin texture was assessed by expert graders. Barrier function was evaluated by transepithelial water loss measurements. Subjects and evaluators were blinded to the product assignment. Results : Of 246 women randomized to treatment, 207 (84 &#x 0025;) completed the study. Women who used the test lotion experienced significantly reduced appearance of hyperpigmentation, improved skin tone evenness, appearance of lightening of skin, and positive effects on skin texture. Improvements versus control were seen as early as 6 weeks. The test lotion was well tolerated. The most common adverse event was a transient, mild burning sensation. Conclusions : Daily use of a facial lotion containing niacinamide, panthenol, and tocopheryl acetate improved skin tone and texture and was well tolerated in Indian women with facial signs of aging...|$|R
