40|$|Thesis (MscAgric (Viticulture and Oenology)) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2008. Over the years, {{different}} {{techniques have}} been used to legally reduce the ethanol content of wines. Several physical processes are available for producing wines with less alcohol. Despite their efficacy, these treatments have a capital and operational cost influence. They can also affect the concentration of other wine components. On the other hand, vast amount of research has been conducted through genetic modification of wine yeast strains {{in order to reduce the}} ethanol yield of Saccharomyces cerevisiae by diverting sugar metabolism towards various byproducts. However, genetically modified yeasts are not currently accepted in most wine industries worldwide, including South Africa. Therefore, other approaches need to be envisaged. Commercial enzymes are commonly added during winemaking. Most enzymes essential for vinification naturally occur in grapes, but are inefficient under pH and sulphur levels associated with winemaking. Enzymes of fungal origin are resistant to such conditions. The most widely used commercial enzymes include pectinases, hemicellulases, glucanases and glycosidases. With the exception of glucanases, produced by Trichoderma harzianium, all the other enzymes are produced by Aspergillus niger. In this study, the possibility of using Gluzyme Mono® 10. 000 BG (Gluzyme) (Novozymes, South Africa) to reduce the glucose content of synthetic <b>grape</b> <b>must</b> and <b>grape</b> <b>must</b> before <b>fermentation</b> <b>in</b> order to produce wine with a reduced alcohol content was investigated. Gluzyme is a glucose oxidase preparation from Aspergillus oryzae, currently being used in the baking industry. Glucose oxidase catalyses the oxidation of glucose to gluconic acid and hydrogen peroxide in the presence of molecular oxygen. Gluzyme was initially used <b>in</b> synthetic <b>grape</b> <b>must</b> where different enzyme concentrations and factors influencing its activity were investigated for its use in winemaking. The results showed that up to 0. 5 % v/v less alcohol were obtained using an enzyme concentration of 20 kU compared to the control. This reduction in alcohol was increased to 1 and 1. 3 % v/v alcohol at pH 3. 5 and pH 5. 5 respectively <b>in</b> aerated synthetic <b>grape</b> <b>must</b> using 30 kU enzyme. Secondly, Gluzyme trials were carried out using Pinotage <b>grape</b> <b>must.</b> Gluzyme treated wines after fermentation contained 0. 68 % v/v less alcohol than the control samples at 30 kU enzyme. Colour and volatile flavour compounds of treated wine did not differ significantly from the untreated samples. Lower free anthocyanin and total phenol concentrations in treated than control samples were observed, possibly due to the hydrogen peroxide oxidation which could have led to polymerisation. The present study has clearly demonstrated that Gluzyme may be used in winemaking to produce reduced-alcohol wine without affecting its colour and aroma compounds. The enzyme in its current form is however, not ideal for winemaking; other forms such as liquid or powder form should be considered if the enzyme is to be used under winemaking conditions. Future work should focus on evaluating the potential new form of the enzyme and studying the effects of Gluzyme <b>in</b> various <b>grape</b> <b>must</b> <b>in</b> semi-industrial scale. A tasting panel should also evaluate its impact on the organoleptic properties and the overall quality of the resulting wines...|$|R

The viable but not cultivable state seems mainly influenced by environmental stress conditions and current isolation methods allow to access only a small subset of AAB population. Also the handling and preservation of strains isolated from high selective sources is still a hard practice. Among vinegars, traditional balsamic vinegar is made through cooking the <b>grape</b> <b>must,</b> <b>in</b> which spontaneous alcoholic fermentation and acetic oxidation take place, then it is aged to be bottled.

In this study AAB strains were isolated from cooked <b>grape</b> <b>musts</b> by plating system using three isolation media, molecular characterized by PCR/RFLP analysis and partial sequencing of rDNA region.

More than 40 of the 1500 known yeast species have been isolated from <b>grape</b> <b>must.</b> <b>In</b> this article, we review the specific flavour-active characteristics of those non- Saccharomyces species that might play a positive role in both spontaneous and inoculated wine ferments. We seek to present ‘single-species’ and ‘multi-species’ ferments in a new light and a new context, and we raise important questions about the direction of mixed-fermentation research to address market trends regarding so-called ‘natural’ wines. This review also highlights that, despite the fact that most frontier research and technological developments are often focussed primarily on S. cerevisiae, non- Saccharomyces research can benefit from the techniques and knowledge developed by research on the former.

40|$|Five strains {{isolated}} from <b>grape</b> <b>musts</b> <b>in</b> Spain in 1997, have {{been characterized by}} several molecular techniques, and three {{of them have been}} identified as pertaining to a new species. All strains are Gram-positive rods, aerotolerant and homofermentative bacteria that do not exhibit catalase activity. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16 S rRNA gene sequences placed these strains within the genus Lactobacillus, closely related to Lactobacillus mali. DNA-DNA hybridization experiments confirmed that strain 71 belongs to the lately described species L. satsumensis, strain 88 belongs to L. mali and the other three isolates have an independent status at species level. Restriction analysis of the amplified 16 S rRNA gene (16 S-ARDRA), internal spacer region (ISR) analysis, random amplified polymorphism DNA (RAPD) and ribotyping were performed in order to establish genotypic similarities and differences between the new species and their closest species. The three isolates can be genetically differentiated from their closest relatives by RAPD analysis and ribotyping. Phenotypically, they can be distinguished by several traits such as their ability to grow at pH 3. 3 and NaCl 5 % (w/v) and by certain carbohydrate fermentations. The name L. uvarum sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is 8 T (=DSM 19971 T=colección española de cultivos tipo (CECT) 7335 T). © 2008 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

40|$|Saccharomyces cerevisiae and its sibling species S. paradoxus {{are known}} to inhabit {{temperate}} arboreal habitats across the globe. Despite their sympatric distribution in the wild, S. cerevisiae is predominantly associated with human fermentations. The apparent ecological differentiation of these species is particularly striking in Europe where S. paradoxus is abundant in forests and S. cerevisiae is abundant in vineyards. However, ecological differences may be confounded with geographic differences in species abundance. To compare the distribution and abundance of these two species we isolated Saccharomyces strains from over 1, 200 samples taken from vineyard and forest habitats in Slovenia. We isolated numerous strains of S. cerevisiae and S. paradoxus as well as small number of S. kudriavzevii strains from both vineyard and forest environments. We find S. cerevisiae less abundant than S. paradoxus on oak trees {{both within and outside}} the vineyard, but more abundant on grapevines and associated substrates. Analysis of the uncultured microbiome shows that both S. cerevisiae and S. paradoxus are rare species in soil and bark samples, but can be much more common <b>in</b> <b>grape</b> <b>must.</b> <b>In</b> contrast to S. paradoxus, European strains of S. cerevisiae have acquired multiple traits thought to be important for life in the vineyard and dominance of wine fermentations. We conclude that S. cerevisiae and S. paradoxus currently share both vineyard and non-vineyard habitats in Slovenia and we discuss factors relevant to their global distribution and relative abundance...|$|R
