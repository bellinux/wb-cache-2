5|$|Half-Life 2: Episode One is {{the first}} in a trilogy of episodes serving as the sequel of the 2004 first-person shooter video game Half-Life 2. In February 2006, Valve {{announced}} that they would be releasing a trilogy of episodes covering the same story arc. While the plots and <b>dialogue</b> <b>of</b> Half-Life and Half-Life 2 were written solely by Valve's in-house writer Marc Laidlaw, the Half-Life 2 Episodes were collaboratively written by Laidlaw, Chet Faliszek, and Erik Wolpaw, with Laidlaw retaining overall leadership of the group.|$|E
5|$|Lowell {{believed}} that the poet {{played an important role}} as a prophet and critic of society. He used poetry for reform, particularly in abolitionism. However, his commitment to the anti-slavery cause wavered over the years, as did his opinion on African-Americans. He attempted to emulate the true Yankee accent in the <b>dialogue</b> <b>of</b> his characters, particularly in The Biglow Papers. This depiction of the dialect, as well as his many satires, was an inspiration to writers such as Mark Twain and H. L. Mencken.|$|E

5|$|The Wrongs of Woman usually uses third-person narration, {{although}} large {{sections of}} Maria's and Jemima's tales are in first-person narrative. The narrator often relates Maria's feelings to the reader through the new technique of free indirect discourse, which blurs {{the line between the}} third-person narrator and the first-person <b>dialogue</b> <b>of</b> a text. Wollstonecraft juxtaposes the events of the novel with both Maria's own retelling of them and her innermost feelings. The first-person stories allow Maria and Jemima to address each other as equals: their stories of suffering, while still allowing each character to retain an individualized sense of self, are a levelling and bonding force between the two.|$|E
5|$|The idea of {{reviving}} the ancient Olympic Games {{had been raised}} {{from time to time}} during the early and mid 19th century, inspired to a certain degree by romanticism and patriotism. In 1833, the romantic poet Panagiotis Soutsos, in his work <b>Dialogue</b> <b>of</b> the Dead, proposed the revival of the Games in the newly formed Greek state, as part of the revival of ancient Greek tradition. In 1852, archaeologist Ernst Curtius stated during a lecture that the Olympic events would be revived.|$|E

5|$|The {{prescribed}} readings for {{the second}} of three Easter feast days included the narration of the Road to Emmaus. The cantata was Bach's first composition for Easter as Thomaskantor in Leipzig. He derived it from his earlier Serenata, which had a similar celebratory mood. An unknown librettist solved the problem that Bach's congratulatory cantata was a <b>dialogue</b> <b>of</b> tenor and alto by retaining a dialogue in three movements, assigned to Hope and Fear. They represent different attitudes to {{the news of the}} Resurrection of Jesus, which may be found in the two disciples, discussing the events on their walk, but also within the listener of the cantata.|$|E
5|$|The {{scenario}} {{consists of}} spin-off stories which expand on Rewrites story, the harvest festival from Rewrites story is expanded on in Harvest festa!, and minigames are included {{during the course}} of gameplay, as in Rewrite. The size of the scenario in Harvest festa! is roughly comparable in size to Tomoyo After. The fan disc also features official character art of Inoue, a supporting character who was not illustrated in Rewrite. Unlike Rewrite, Kotarou is fully voiced in the fan disc. The five system sound themes included with the Rewrite laptops were released with the fan disc, with the addition of <b>dialogue</b> <b>of</b> Kagari by Kana Hanazawa.|$|E
5|$|Columbia Pictures {{executive}} Amy Pascal suggested Angelina Jolie to Noyce, who {{had often}} spoken to Jolie {{in the past}} about a desire to create a female spy franchise. Pascal even invited Jolie for a Bond girl role, but the actress playfully replied that she {{was more interested in}} playing James Bond himself instead. Jolie was sent Salts script in September 2008 and liked it. Wimmer, Noyce, and producer Lorenzo di Bonaventura went to visit Jolie at her home in France to discuss a possible script and character change. Writer Brian Helgeland helped with the character development and <b>dialogue</b> <b>of</b> the script based on the notes that came out of those discussions with Jolie and to accompany the gender change, the title character's name was changed to Evelyn Salt.|$|E

5|$|Davies {{was taken}} on {{as a member}} of the BBC Wales children's {{department}} in 1985 and given one-day contracts and commissions, such as illustrating for Why Don't You? As he was only given three days of work per month by the BBC, he continued to freelance and volunteer for the Sherman Theatre. In 1986, he was approached by the Sunday Sport before its launch to provide a football-themed daily strip; he declined because he was concerned about the pornographic content of the newspaper. He submitted a script for Crossroads in response to an appeal for new writers; it was not used because the show was cancelled in 1987. He ultimately abandoned his graphic art career entirely when he realised in his early twenties that he enjoyed writing the <b>dialogue</b> <b>of</b> a comic more than creating the art.|$|E
5|$|If, in {{the famous}} garden and {{cemetery}} scenes the <b>dialogue</b> <b>of</b> the two lovers, Juliet's asides, and Romeo's passionate outbursts are not sung, if the duets of love and despair are given to the orchestra, the reasons are numerous and easy to comprehend. First, and this alone would be sufficient, it is a symphony and not an opera. Second, since duets of this nature have been handled vocally a thousand times by the greatest masters, it was wise as well as unusual to attempt another means of expression. It is also because the very sublimity of this love made its depiction so dangerous for the musician {{that he had to}} give his imagination a latitude that the positive sense of the sung words would not have given him, resorting instead to instrumental language, which is richer, more varied, less precise, and by its very indefiniteness incomparably more powerful in such a case.|$|E
5|$|In another Buddhist text Majjhima Nikāya, the Buddha criticizes Jain {{emphasis}} on the destruction of unobservable and unverifiable types of karma {{as a means to}} end suffering, rather than on eliminating evil mental states such as greed, hatred and delusion, which are observable and verifiable. In the Upālisutta <b>dialogue</b> <b>of</b> this Majjhima Nikāya text, Buddha contends with a Jain monk who asserts that bodily actions are the most criminal, in comparison to the actions of speech and mind. Buddha criticises this view, saying that the actions of mind are most criminal, and not the actions of speech or body. Buddha also criticises the Jain ascetic practice of various austerities, claiming that he, Buddha, is happier when not practising the austerities.|$|E

5|$|The Anglo-French {{adaption}} of The Bridge {{was announced}} as a joint project between Sky and Canal+ in January 2013. Ben Richards, the head writer of The Tunnel, worked with Hans Rosenfeldt, {{the creator of}} the original series. Due to the setting, the <b>dialogue</b> <b>of</b> the series is bilingual, a first for British and French television. With a budget of £15 million, filming took place between February and August 2013, and was shot on location in Kent, England and northern France. It was produced with both British and French crew members. The premieres on both Sky Atlantic and Canal+ received strong ratings for the respective channels, with an initial consolidated figure of almost 900,000 in the UK, and 1.3 million in France. Critical reception of the series has been generally positive, with Dillane and Poésy's acting being praised, as well as the plot's grittiness. The comparisons with The Bridge were also viewed favourably by some reviewers, though others criticised The Tunnel for being identical. The producers admit that the first episode is a copy of the original.|$|E
5|$|The North American {{release of}} the game as Dragon Warrior II was created by Enix {{themselves}} and published in 1990. Unlike the original Japanese Famicom version, which used passwords for saving, the NES version used an internal battery backup instead to record the player's progress. The storyline introduction in Moonbrooke is presented exclusively in Dragon Warrior II. In the Japanese original, the game starts right with the injured soldier from Moonbrooke entering Midenhall castle, seeking help from its king. The <b>dialogue</b> <b>of</b> the American localization often used (intentionally) archaic English vocabulary, among other differences from the Japanese version. Like Dragon Warrior, the American version of Dragon Warrior II was censored in some aspects; for example, it used a ghost-like sprite instead of the original defeated character's coffin with cross sprite.|$|E
