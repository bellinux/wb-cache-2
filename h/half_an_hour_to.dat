Unaware of Spider-Man's true identity, he also {{sees himself as a}} father figure for Peter, ignoring his own son, Harry. Dafoe was cast as Osborn in November 2000, after Nicolas Cage, John Malkovich, and John Travolta turned down the role. Dafoe insisted on wearing the uncomfortable costume as he felt that a stuntman would not convey the character's necessary body language.

5|$|Jardine's batting {{performance}} in 1928 {{was similar to}} that from the previous season. He played 14 matches, scoring 1,133 runs at an average of 87.15. He was successful in high-profile matches, scoring 193 for Gentlemen at the Oval, where the crowd had booed his slow start (at one stage, he took <b>half</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>to</b> score two runs) but later cheered him as his last fifty runs were scored in half an hour. For the same team at Lord's, he scored 86 and 40. He captained The Rest against England in a Test trial and made the highest score in each innings, scoring 74 not out in the fourth innings to help his team to draw the game on a difficult pitch, against international bowlers Maurice Tate and Harold Larwood.|$|E
5|$|Monitor, to the {{surprise}} of Virginias crew, had emerged from behind Minnesota and went straight for the approaching Virginia and positioned herself between her and the grounded Minnesota, preventing the Confederate ironclad from further engaging the vulnerable wooden ship at close range. At 8:45am Worden gave the order to fire where Greene fired the first shots of the battle between the two ironclads which harmlessly deflected off the Confederate ironclad. During the battle Monitor fired solid shot, about once every eight minutes, while Virginia fired shell exclusively. The ironclads generally fought at close range for about four hours, ending at 12:15pm, ranging from a few yards to more than a hundred. Both ships were constantly in motion, maintaining a circular pattern. Because of Virginias weak engines, massive size and weight and with a draft of , she was slow and difficult to maneuver, taking her <b>half</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>to</b> complete a 180-degree turn.|$|E
5|$|On 22 December {{a public}} {{memorial}} service took place for Tucker, Bentley and Choate at St Paul's Cathedral. King George V {{was represented by}} Edward Wallington, his Groom in Waiting; also present were Churchill and the Lord Mayor of London. The crime had shocked Londoners and the service showed evidence of their feelings. An estimated ten thousand people waited in St Paul's environs, and many local businesses closed as a mark of respect; the nearby London Stock Exchange ceased trading for <b>half</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>to</b> allow traders and staff to watch the procession along Threadneedle Street.

There remained a few sceptics about this interpretation until, a decade or so later, American physicists using satellite data regularly detected bursts of electrons 25 minutes or so after solar flares. This was just one component, but to Wild and his colleagues a very exciting one, of a much wider world-leading research program.|$|E
25|$|On occasion, {{difficulties}} inserting the intravenous needles {{have also}} occurred, sometimes taking over <b>half</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>to</b> find a suitable vein. Typically, {{the difficulty is}} found in convicts {{with a history of}} intravenous drug use. Opponents argue that the insertion of intravenous lines that take excessive amounts of time are tantamount to being cruel and unusual punishment. In addition, opponents point to instances where the intravenous line has failed, or when adverse reactions to drugs or unnecessary delays happen during the process of execution.|$|E

25|$|When {{used as an}} {{injectable}} {{it typically}} begins working within four minutes and lasts for <b>half</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>to</b> three hours. Lidocaine is about 95% metabolized (dealkylated) in the liver mainly by CYP3A4 to the pharmacologically active metabolites monoethylglycinexylidide (MEGX) and then subsequently to the inactive glycine xylidide. MEGX has a longer half-life than lidocaine, but also is a less potent sodium channel blocker. The volume of distribution is 1.1L/kg to 2.1L/kg, but congestive heart failure can decrease it. About 60% to 80% circulates bound to the protein alpha1 acid glycoprotein. The oral bioavailability is 35% and the topical bioavailability is 3%.|$|E
25|$|Lidocaine, {{also known}} as {{xylocaine}} and lignocaine, is a medication used to numb tissue in a specific area. It {{is also used to}} treat ventricular tachycardia and to perform nerve blocks. Lidocaine mixed {{with a small amount of}} adrenaline (epinephrine) is available to allow larger doses for numbing, to decrease bleeding, and to make the numbing effect last longer. When used as an injectable, it typically begins working within four minutes and lasts for <b>half</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>to</b> three hours. Lidocaine mixtures may also be applied directly to the skin or mucous membranes to numb the area.|$|E

25|$|Following the {{international}} break, 20 November 2011 saw Parma welcome league leaders Udinese to the Tardini. Udinese travelled without a win {{in five years}} at Parma's ground and came the closer to opening the scoring in the first half, but neither side was able to break the deadlock. In the second half, pacey wingman Jonathan Biabiany headed in from a Giovinco corner to give Parma a lead with just over <b>half</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>to</b> go. Fifteen minutes later, Dušan Basta was adjudged to have fouled Biabiany in the penalty area and Giovinco stepped up to convert the penalty from 12 yards out to give Parma a remarkable two-goal victory and lift {{them out of the}} bottom half of the table.|$|E
25|$|Another thermo-responsive gel is {{one that}} is formed by {{combining}} chitosan with glycerophosphate (GP) salt. This solution experiences gelation at temperatures above 37°C. Gelation of chitosan/GP is rather slow, taking <b>half</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>to</b> initially set and 9 more hours to completely stabilize. Gel strength varies from 67 to 1572 Pa depending on the concentration of chitosan; the lower end of this range approaches the stiffness of brain tissue. Chitosan/GP has shown success in vitro, but the addition of polylysine is needed to enhance nerve cell attachment. Polylysine was covalently bonded to chitosan in order to prevent it from diffusing away. Polylysine was selected because of its positive nature and high hydrophilicity, which promotes neurite growth. Neuron survival was doubled, though neurite outgrowth did not change with the added polylysine.|$|E
