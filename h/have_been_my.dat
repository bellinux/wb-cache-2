500|$|Burton became {{attached}} as director, while producer Denise Di Novi {{and writer}} Daniel Waters also returned. In January 1994, Burton was unsure of {{his plans to}} direct Catwoman or an adaptation of [...] "The Fall of the House of Usher". On June 6, 1995, Waters turned in his Catwoman script to Warner Bros., the same day Batman Forever was released. Burton was still being courted to direct. Waters joked, [...] "Turning it in the day Batman Forever opened may not <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>my</b> best logistical move, in that it's {{the celebration of the}} fun-for-the-whole-family Batman. Catwoman is definitely not a fun-for-the-whole-family script." [...] In an August 1995 interview, Pfeiffer re-iterated her interest in the spin-off, but explained her priorities would be challenged as a mother and commitments to other projects. The film labored in development hell for years, with Pfeiffer replaced by Ashley Judd. The film ended up becoming the critically panned Catwoman (2004), starring Halle Berry.|$|E
500|$|Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger {{described}} the episode as [...] "a great end to what may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>my</b> favorite season of The Office to date." [...] He said the episode included great laughs and sublime dramatic moments, including Michael's moment with Holly after the sketch and the silent {{moment in which}} Jim learns Pam is pregnant. Sepinwall said Jim's moment of composing himself in the hallway after calling Dwight in that scene was, [...] "Maybe Krasinski's single best moment on the series to date." [...] Margaret Lyons of Entertainment Weekly said she had [...] "some mixed feelings" [...] about the episode and wished it had more from Ryan, Creed and Kelly, but she especially praised the ending scene with Jim and Pam, which {{she said she did}} not expect. Dan Hooper of VH1's Best Week Ever said, [...] "Office finale was awesome, as we expected, capping about seven straight weeks of just top-notch episodes with great character moments, a legitimately interesting plot, and just laugh line after laugh line, reminding us all [...] we spent time talking about this show every week." [...] Hooper also praised NBC for not advertising the twist ending: [...] "They didn’t stupidly dramatize it, and it ended up being a really nice, really fitting end" [...] to the season.|$|E

500|$|After VE Day, the Churchills first {{returned}} to Chartwell on 18 May 1945, to {{be greeted by}} what the horticulturalist and garden historian Stefan Buczacki describes as, [...] "the biggest crowd Westerham had ever seen". But military victory was rapidly followed by political defeat as Churchill lost the June 1945 general election. He almost immediately went abroad, while Clementine went back to Chartwell to begin the long process of opening up the house for his return – [...] "it will be lovely when the lake camouflage is gone". Later that year, Churchill again gave thought to selling Chartwell, concerned by the expense of running the estate. A group of friends, organised by Lord Camrose, raised the sum of £55,000 which was passed to the National Trust allowing it to buy the house from Churchill for the sum of £43,800. The excess provided an endowment. The sale was completed on 29 November. For payment of a rent of £350 per annum, plus rates, the Churchills committed to a 50 year lease, allowing them to live at Chartwell until their deaths, {{at which point the}} property would revert to the National Trust. Churchill recorded his gratitude in a letter to Camrose in December 1945, [...] "I feel how inadequate my thanks <b>have</b> <b>been,</b> <b>my</b> dear Bill, who (...) never wavered in your friendship during all these long and tumultuous years".|$|E
500|$|A [...] fastball {{from the}} Cubs' Mike Montgomery on August 11, 2016, struck Holliday {{on the right}} thumb, {{fracturing}} it. [...] The Cardinals placed him on the DL. [...] Presented with the option to either allow the thumb to heal naturally or with surgery, Holliday elected surgery as that would have potentially allowed him to return before season's end. [...] He encountered multiple delays in recovery. [...] Having been informed {{in the final days}} of the 2016 season that the Cardinals would not pick up the option for 2017 worth $17 million, he was activated from the DL − although his thumb was still fractured − in time for the September 30 game against Pittsburgh. [...] He hit his first career pinch-hit home run in that game and 20th of the season. [...] Holliday released a statement: [...] "While I'm disappointed this could be it here in St. Louis, I understand that it might be time to move on." [...] While his batting average had dropped to a career-low [...]246, Holliday was optimistic about a rebound. [...] Because he produced the third-highest exit velocity at [...] of all hitters with at least 100 batted balls in 2016, he concluded that to [...] "have my misses be more in the air than on the ground, my numbers could really get back toward where they <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>my</b> whole career." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, Mercury had a {{long-term}} relationship with Mary Austin, whom he met through guitarist Brian May. He lived with Austin for several years in West Kensington, London. By the mid-1970s, the singer had begun {{an affair with a}} male American record executive at Elektra Records and, in December 1976, Mercury told Austin of his sexuality, which ended their romantic relationship. Mercury moved out of the flat they shared, into 12 Stafford Terrace in Kensington and bought Austin a place of her own nearby. They remained close friends through the years, with Mercury often referring to her as his only true friend. In a 1985 interview, Mercury said of Austin, [...] "All my lovers asked me why they couldn't replace Mary , but it's simply impossible. The only friend I've got is Mary and I don't want anybody else. To me, she was my common-law wife. To me, it was a marriage. We believe in each other, that's enough for me." [...] He also wrote several songs about Austin, the most notable of which is [...] "Love of My Life". Mercury's final home, Garden Lodge, 1 Logan Place, a twenty-eight room Georgian mansion in Kensington set in a quarter-acre manicured garden surrounded by a high brick wall, had been picked out by Austin. In his will, Mercury left his London home to Austin, rather than his partner Jim Hutton, saying to her, [...] "You would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>my</b> wife {{and it would have been}} yours anyway." [...] Mercury was also the godfather of Austin's oldest son, Richard.|$|E

500|$|On {{choosing}} {{his lead}} single, Drake told Rap-Up, [...] "It’s gotta {{be a real}} great song. It’s gotta be something that I feel is timeless and is better than anything that I’ve ever done." [...] Drake exclusively revealed to Rap-Up on February 15, 2010 that [...] "Over" [...] would be the lead single from his debut album, Thank Me Later, and would be produced by Boi-1da, producer of his previous singles [...] "Best I Ever Had" [...] and [...] "Forever". Drake chose to premiere the song on his hometown Toronto's radio station Flow 93.5. In an interview session with the station, Drake said, [...] "I went with 'Over' as the first look because of {{the words in the}} hook," [...] he said. [...] "The hook being the most repetitive part. I got a lot of great songs on my album. I got songs for women who wanna feel special. I got songs for dudes — if you ever thought my music was too soft, this is one you will enjoy. I got a lot of variety on there, but the biggest thing was that opening line on the hook: 'I know way too many people here right now that I didn't know last year'." [...] He went on to explain that the record sums up where he is in his career right now, and called it a [...] "great first impression". Drake did a lot of work for the song and also the album in Jamaica, during which he called the [...] "calm before the storm", and called [...] "Over" [...] the storm. He said, [...] "It's the moment. I wanted to emerge at first from this album and just let people know 'This is how I'm coming out in the public eye. I'm ready for anything." [...] He then went to explain that after the album people will be like [...] "he's still human" [...] or [...] "he's still thinking the same way", and said he wanted people to [...] "understand I could have lost it. He said, [...] "'Over' could <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>my</b> entire album. Just 'cause that's what this industry and game will do to you if you lose yourself." [...] Drake later said that the song was a [...] "warm-up record". He went on to say, [...] "I love the song. I love the message in the song. It's funny, because 'Over' is the fourth song on the album and it's the turning point in the album. It's like, you get three songs of me sort of trying to paint the picture of what the last year has been like for me — trying to fill you in, almost let you into my world as much as I can. 'Over' is that moment where you're almost worried on the album. 'Is this kid about to ... ? What's happening? Is he changing?' I wanted that to come out first. I wanted people to be a little nervous. This whole journey could have changed me drastically. Fortunately I'm able to step out of my shoes and reflect on it and give you some great music. 'Over' is a great alter-ego moment. It's the dark side of things and I really wanted that to come out first." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Hollywood forgives a {{lot when}} you have a hit," [...] said Hill. [...] "I don't know what to say about it, {{other than the fact that}} it was just a gift in terms of getting it. The studio hated it, and didn't even want to release it. There was a lot of {{friction}} with management at the time. Some of it might <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>my</b> fault." ...|$|E
2500|$|When asked a {{week later}} about the {{controversy}} about Obama's pastor that prompted, and was addressed by, Obama's speech, Clinton answered, [...] "He would not <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>my</b> pastor.

You certainly have to do that, if not explicitly, then implicitly by getting up and moving." ...|$|E

In her own defence, Bardot {{wrote in a letter to}} a French gay magazine: [...] "Apart from my husband — who maybe will cross over one day as well — I am entirely surrounded by homos.

2500|$|Frank Sinatra {{recorded}} {{for the first}} time with Basie on 1962's Sinatra-Basie and for a second studio album on 1964's It Might as Well Be Swing, which was arranged by Quincy Jones. Jones also arranged and conducted 1966's live Sinatra at the Sands which featured Sinatra with Count Basie and his orchestra at the Sands Hotel in Las Vegas. In May 1970, Sinatra performed in London's Royal Festival Hall with the Basie orchestra, in a charity benefit for the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children. Sinatra later said of this concert [...] "I have a funny feeling that those two nights could <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>my</b> finest hour, really. It went so well; it was so thrilling and exciting".|$|E
2500|$|In a 2008 interview, Bakshi {{referred}} to Crumb as a [...] "hustler" [...] and stated, [...] "He goes {{in so many}} directions that he's hard to pin down. I spoke {{to him on the}} phone. We both had the same deal, five percent. They finally sent Crumb the money and not me. Crumb always gets what he wants, including that château of his in France.... I have no respect for Crumb. Is he a good artist? Yes, {{if you want to do}} the same thing over and over. He should <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>my</b> best friend for what I did with Fritz the Cat.

It was alleged by plainclothes policemen who were in the audience that Chambers allowed audience members to touch her with their hands and mouths during her show called [...] "Feel the Magic". She was released on $2,000 bail and the charges were later dropped. [...] "I've never been arrested in my life for anything, ever, so {{this is kind of a}} big shock for me, not only as a performer but as a human being", Chambers said at the time. [...] "It's a heartbreaker. This is supposed to be a hip city. I really love -- make that LOVED -- this city.
