25|$|Trollers – {{catch fish}} by towing astern {{one of more}} <b>trolling</b> <b>lines.</b> A <b>trolling</b> <b>line</b> is a fishing line with natural or {{artificial}} baited hooks trailed by a vessel near the surface or at a certain depth. Several lines can be towed {{at the same time}} using outriggers to keep the lines apart. The lines can be hauled in manually or by small winches. A length of rubber is often included in each line as a shock absorber. The <b>trolling</b> <b>line</b> is towed at a speed depending on the target species, from 2.3 knots up to at least 7 knots. Trollers range from small open boats to large refrigerated vessels 30 metres long. In many tropical artisanal fisheries, trolling is done with sailing canoes with outriggers for stability. With properly designed vessels, trolling is an economical and efficient way of catching tuna, mackerel and other pelagic fish swimming close to the surface. Purpose built trollers are usually equipped with two or four trolling booms raised and lowered by topping lifts, held in position by adjustable stays. Electrically powered or hydraulic reels can be used to haul in the lines.|$|R

40|$|Dolphins are {{the true}} mammals of the seas and are larger pelagic species {{of the high seas}} living in {{tropical}} and temperate waters. They were popularly termed dolphin fishes. It possesses the combination of various unique characters. Mammals and fishes live in the same area but also have a similarity in shape and in the habit of jumping above water. They were caught by <b>trolling</b> <b>lines,</b> they are also landed by purse-seiners and floating traps...|$|R
50|$|Commercial fishing uses many {{different}} methods to effectively catch a large variety of species {{including the use}} of pole and <b>line,</b> <b>trolling</b> with multiple <b>lines,</b> trawling with large nets, and traps or pots. Sustainability of fisheries is improved by using specific equipment that eliminates or minimizes catching non-targeted species.|$|R
40|$|Rod and <b>line,</b> hand-line, <b>trolling</b> <b>line</b> and fish-traps are the {{different}} types of fishing gears wherein suitable fish baits are employed with a view to luring the catch. The coastal fishermen of India mostly use different types of natural fish-baits to catch fishes like Perches, Carangids, Sciaenids, Scombroids and Elasmobranchs. The reactions of the fishes caught to {{the different}} baits used are quite varied. Successful line fishing operations very much depend on the fish-baits. A detailed record of the variety of fishes caught, types of fishing and different baits used by the coastal fishermen of India has been made...|$|R

5000|$|The Atlantic {{mackerel}} is {{of commercial}} importance to many Atlantic fisheries, which catch it with purse seines, trawls, gill and trammel nets, and <b>trolling</b> <b>lines.</b> Global annual catch is typically {{in the range}} of 1 million tonnes, though a 50% spike in 2014 put this number at nearly 1.5 million tonnes. The United Kingdom and Norway bring in the most Atlantic mackerel, with annual catches coming in at over 166,000 tonnes and 160,000 tonnes respectively. There are three stocks in the eastern Atlantic: one in the south, one in the west, and another in the North Sea. There are two populations in the Mediterranean, one in the east and one in the west. In the western Atlantic there are two stocks, one in the north and one in the south, for which assessments are, according to the IUCN, [...] "highly uncertain." ...|$|R
50|$|Copper, monel {{and lead}} core fishing lines {{are used as}} heavy <b>trolling</b> main <b>lines,</b> usually {{followed}} with fluorocarbon line near the lure or bait with fishing swivel between the lines. Due to their high density, these fishing lines sink rapidly in water and they require less line for achieving desired trolling depth. On the other hand, these lines are relatively thick for desired strength, especially when compared with braided fishing lines and they often require reels with larger spools.|$|R
40|$|Yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) {{has long}} been {{captured}} by commercial fishery in Makassar Strait using purse seine, <b>trolling</b> <b>line</b> and handline fisheries. It was probably it can cause over exploitation and decrease population structure for that fish. This study aimed to analyze the size structure of yellowfin tuna based on the positions of deep and shallow sea FADs (fish aggregating devices). The data consisted of fish length and weight) {{and the size of}} gonad maturation, which were collected from the field observation. The data were analyzed using histogram graph and t- test. The results indicated that the fish length caught in the deep and shallow sea FADs ranged from 30 to 120 cm with the average of 101. 39 ± 2. 49 cm, and from 105 to 170 cm with the average of 134. 90 ± 1. 90, respectively. The fish weight ranged from 20 to 75 kg for deep sea FADs and ranged from 0. 4 to 35 kg for shallow sea FADs. The first stage of gonad maturation on either female or male occurred at 118. 88 cm forklength, where the smallest spawning size on female was 126. 10 cm forklength...|$|R
40|$|The Spermonde Archipelago holds one of {{the largest}} artisanal {{fisheries}} in Indonesia, providing livelihoods for local communities and many other people involved in international trade networks of seafood. High demand and a lack of enforcement of existing fisheries regulations turn into high pressure for the coral reef ecosystem, contributing to its overall degradation. Estimations on the ecological impacts of different levels of fishing pressure, as well as fisheries stock assessments and marine resource management require precise information of the spatial distribution of fishing effort, which involves great uncertainty when only anecdotal information is considered. We explored the feasibility of applying participatory boat tracking to complement fisheries data during the NW monsoon season 2014 – 2015. We conducted interviews, measured catch landings, and distributed GPS data loggers among hook and line fishermen to identify fishing grounds by gear-dependent patterns of boat movement. Most of the fishing activities involved two gears (octopus bait and <b>trolling</b> <b>line</b> for live groupers) and three fishing grounds. The mass of catch landings was dominated by Octopoda (CPUE = 10. 1 kg boatday− 1) while the most diverse group was the fish family Serranidae, with Plectropomus leopardus being the main target species. In conclusion, boat tracking combined with interviews and catch surveys has proven a useful tool to reduce uncertainty in information on spatial resource use, while allowing a high level of participation by fishermen...|$|R
40|$|The {{coastal zone}} of Sri Lanka {{is the most}} {{important}} area of fish production at present. This coastal zone is limited seawards to the edge of our relatively narrow continental shelf. The fishing methods employed are such that {{only a fraction of the}} shelf area is exploited. The extent to which the coastal zone is exploited depends on the craft and gear used in the fishing operations. The non-mechanized traditional crafts such as the teppams and orus generally operate within about five miles from shore. The mechanized traditional crafts and the small mechanized boats introduced around 1957 carry out fishing operations up to the continental shelf or beyond. The gear used by these fishing crafts is determined by the habits of the type of fish to be caught, the nature of the sea bed and other related conditions. For the pelagic fishes they use <b>trolling</b> <b>lines</b> or float long lines or drift nets. For the demersal fishes hand lines, bottom long lines, bottom set nets or drag nets are used. However, the net is the preferred fishing gear. The beach seines or madels, the traditional crafts such as orus, teppams and vallams and the small mechanized boats are the important contributors in the coastal fishery. Of these the madels are considered the most important since a high percentage (25 - 35 %) of the Island's landings are produced by the operation of these nets...|$|R
25|$|Trolling from {{a moving}} boat {{involves}} moving quite {{slowly through the}} water. This can be accomplished {{with the use of}} a special <b>trolling</b> motor. Multiple <b>lines</b> are often used, and outriggers can be used to spread the lines more widely and reduce their chances of tangling. Downriggers can also be used to keep the lures or baits trailing at a desired depth.|$|R
25|$|The {{crevalle jack}} {{is a highly}} {{important}} species to commercial fisheries throughout its range, with the greatest quantity of the species taken from the eastern Atlantic. In some fisheries, {{it is one of}} the most abundant species and therefore of great importance in these regions. In the Americas, the reported annual catch has ranged between 150 and 1300 tonnes since 1950, with catches since 2000 ranging between 190 and 380 tonnes. Most of the western Atlantic catch is from Florida, although Caribbean fisheries, such as Trinidad, take considerable quantities of the fish. The eastern Atlantic catch statistics do not differentiate longfin crevalle jack from crevalle jack, thus must be considered a composite dataset. This region only comprises catch data from Angola, Ghana, São Tome, and Principe. These catches are much larger than in the east, with hauls of between 1000 and 38 000 tonnes per year recorded since 1950, although catches since 2000 only range between 1900 and 10 200 tonnes. Crevalle jack is taken by a number of fishing methods, including haul seines, gill nets, purse seines, trawls, handlines and <b>trolling</b> <b>lines.</b> The abundance of the species in Trinidad leads to the fish being taken in several quite different types of fishery; demersal trawls, artisanal gill nets and even beach seines, which illustrates the species' importance. In Trinidad, recreational fishermen also may sell their catch, which adds to the overall quantity of fish sold. Crevalle jack is sold at market fresh, frozen, salted, and smoked, and as fishmeal and oil.|$|R
40|$|An {{autonomous}} catamaran, {{based on}} a modified Prindle- 19 day-sailing catamaran was built to test the viability of GPS-based system identification for precision control. The catamaran was fitted with several sensors and actuators to characterize the dynamics. Using an electric trolling motor, and lead ballast to match all-up weight, several system identification passes were performed to excite system modes and model the dynamic response. LQG controllers were designed {{based on the results}} of the system identification passes, and tested with the electric <b>trolling</b> motor. <b>Line</b> following performance was excellent, with cross-track error standard deviations of less than 0. 15 meters. The wing-sail propulsion system was fitted, and the controllers tested with the wing providing all forward thrust. Line following performance and disturbance rejection were excellent, with the cross-track error standard deviations of approximately 0. 30 meters, in spite of wind speed variations of over 50 % of nominal value.

40|$|Trolling {{board is}} an {{important}} troll line accessory which can produce swinging and diving movements of the lure. A laboratory study {{on the effect of}} <b>trolling</b> board main <b>line</b> position and current speed on swinging and diving movements was done in a water circulating tank at the Faculty of Fisheries and Marine Science, Sam Ratulangi University. At low speed, the widest swing reached at main line position near the center of trolling board, but at high speed, it reached main line position near the fore tip. Swinging frequency decreased with the current speed. The depth of diving increased as the main line position got closer to the tip and increased with current speed...|$|R
25|$|Historically, in Alaska, {{hand hook}} and <b>line</b> <b>trolling</b> {{were used to}} catch king and silver salmon in salt water. This method {{required}} minimal gear-boat, lines and hooks—and was used to catch fish that were still feeding in open water before returning to spawn. Trolling was very successful in southeast Alaska and historically the catch {{was used by the}} fresh and mild-cured fish packing industries. Power boats located near feeding grounds conducted most of the trolling. Each boat had four to ten lines, extending from tall poles hung outboard when fishing; each line carried several hooks, with heavy lead sinkers and spoons or baits as lures. Trolling lengthened the fishing season, allowing fishermen to fish in early spring before spawning runs.|$|R
40|$|Visual records, radio {{interviews}} and onboard {{observations of the}} fishing activities during a 58 days scientific expedition to Trindade Island and the Martin Vaz Archipelago were obtained from February to April 2007. The regular activities of four different fisheries were observed: pelagic longline, bottom <b>line,</b> <b>trolling</b> and handline. These fisheries caused mortality of at least seven species with some level threat, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature list. The establishment of specific restriction norms for hook-and-line activities around the oceanic islands {{was seen as an}} alternative for the conservation of the ichthyofauna of the region. Satellite monitoring to track the fishery vessels could be established through the national program as another legal mean to diminish fishing the impact...|$|R
40|$|Tuticorin {{is one of}} {{the well}} known, age old, fishery ports of India {{especially}} by virtue of the production of valuable, good quality, natural pearls and chanks in addition to marine fish production. Early in the 19 I 1 -' 15 periods the marine fish production here was to the tune of 663, 592 pounds (296. 3 tonnes). The fishermen strength was 520 who operated conventional 'valavalai', 'kolavalai', 'madivalai', offshore <b>lining,</b> inshore <b>lining,</b> <b>trolling</b> and other minor nets with the traditional fishing crafts like Tuticorin type of plank built boats called 'Vallam' and 'catamarans'. Over the two decades, mechanized fishing has changed not only the fishing pattern but also the constituent catches. The progress of fishing industry can still be augmented by motorising the plank built boats and 'catamarans'. Present assessment of fishery resources reveals that in a year 19, 850 t of fish are landed by trawlers and 9, 275 t by traditional fishing units...|$|R
40|$|Bedrock rivers occur where {{surface water}} flows along an exposed rock surface. Fractured {{sedimentary}} bedrock can exhibit variable groundwater residence times, anisotropic flow paths, and heterogeneity, along with diffusive exchange between fractures and rock matrix. These {{properties of the}} rock will affect thermal transients in the riverbed and groundwater–surface water exchange. In this study, surface electrical methods were used as a non-invasive technique to assess the scale and temporal variability of riverbed temperature and groundwater–surface water interaction beneath a sedimentary bedrock riverbed. Conditions were monitored at a semi-daily to semi-weekly interval over a full annual period that included a seasonal freeze–thaw cycle. Surface electromagnetic induction (EMI) and electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) methods captured conditions beneath the riverbed along a pool–riffle sequence of the Eramosa River in Canada. Geophysical datasets were accompanied by continuous measurements of aqueous specific conductance, temperature, and river stage. Time-lapse vertical temperature <b>trolling</b> within a <b>lined</b> borehole adjacent to the river revealed active groundwater flow zones along fracture networks within the upper 10  m of rock. EMI measurements collected during cooler high-flow and warmer low-flow periods identified a spatiotemporal riverbed response that was largely dependent upon riverbed morphology and seasonal groundwater temperature. Time-lapse ERT profiles across the pool and riffle sequence identified seasonal transients within the upper 2 and 3  m of rock, respectively, with spatial variations controlled by riverbed morphology (pool versus riffle) and dominant surficial rock properties (competent versus weathered rock rubble surface). While the pool and riffle both exhibited a dynamic resistivity through seasonal cooling and warming cycles, conditions beneath the pool were more variable, {{largely due to the}} formation of river ice during the winter season. We show that surface electrical resistivity methods have the capacity to detect and resolve electrical resistivity transience beneath a fractured bedrock riverbed in response to porewater temperature and specific conductance fluctuations over a complete annual cycle...|$|R
40|$|Two {{species of}} dolphinfish, Coryphaena hippurus and Coryphaena equiselis, {{are found in}} Australian waters and off the {{north-eastern}} coast of New Zealand. Both species (also called Mahi-mahi, or dorado) are generally found in tropical waters, but only C. hippurus is captured in southern waters (to 34 °S). Dolphinfish are caught by recreational and commercial fishers, using either <b>trolled</b> or baited <b>lines.</b> Most catch records do not allow the identification of fish to the species level. Dolphinfish are also an incidental catch of foreign and domestic pelagic fisheries (e. g. long-lining for tunas and billfishes) and 10 - 70 tonnes are taken {{per year in the}} Australia-New Zealand region. Although Coryphaena are known to associate with objects (e. g. traps for carangids and navigation buoys) and are a focus for recreational fishers, Fish Attraction Devices (FADs) are not used by commercial fishers off the coast of Australia and New Zealand. FADs are, however, used by fishers in the Pacific Islands. Recreational catches of Coryphaena may exceed the commercial catch in some areas. Good data for New South Wales, Australia, gave estimates of 11. 7 and 12. 7 tonnes of Coryphaena caught in 1994 and 1995 respectively, which represented 1. 1 - 1. 8 x the recorded commercial catch. Approximately ~ 12, 600 fish have been tagged since 1973 around Australia and data on returns are only available for 108 fish (0. 86 % recovery). Tagged Coryphaena were found to move distances of up to 440 kilometres and at estimated speeds of up to 20 kilometres per day. The time between tag and recapture varied from 0 - 360 days and fish moved 0 - 440 kilometres. The majority of fish were caught around the same drifting object near where they were tagged. The collection of Coryphaena larvae in Queensland and New South Wales, along the east coast of Australia, indicates spawning in these waters. Most larvae have been collected in the austral summer and autumn and typically in surface waters well offshore. Dolphinfish have been successfully raised from eggs to fish of marketable size in Western Australia and the species appears to be an excellent candidate for mass production, which is now possible in Australia...|$|R
