40|$|The {{relative}} {{contributions of}} <b>hip</b> <b>and</b> knee proprioceptors to the origination of extensor spasms {{were examined in}} 11 subjects with chronic spinal cord injury (SCI). Ramp and hold extension <b>and</b> combined <b>hip</b> <b>and</b> knee oscillation movements were imposed to the right leg while the ankle was held in a static position by a custom-designed robot. Isometric joint torques of the <b>hip,</b> knee, <b>and</b> ankle and surface electromyograms (EMGs) from seven leg muscles were recorded following controlled <b>hip</b> <b>and</b> knee extension. A stereotypical torque response consisting of hip flexion, knee extension, and ankle plantar flexion was observed following <b>hip</b> <b>and</b> knee perturbations. Further, the hip or knee joint posture modulated the spastic reflexes triggered by the extension movement of the other joint, with larger responses observed with the <b>hip</b> <b>and</b> knee extended. In addition, combined <b>hip</b> <b>and</b> knee oscillation movements were imposed to one leg with four different phasing conditions. The phasing between the <b>hip</b> <b>and</b> knee modulated the reflex activity triggered by <b>hip</b> <b>and</b> knee oscillations. The EMG patterns of the spastic reflexes were generally consistent with muscle timing during locomotion in human SCI.

5|$|Non-disabled sprinters have {{calves and}} ankles that return and amplify the energy {{supplied}} by their <b>hips</b> <b>and</b> knees, while Pistorius compensates with additional work {{because he does}} not have calves and ankles with their associated tendons and muscles. An analysis published by Engineering & Technology magazine estimates that in using the blades, Pistorius must generate twice the power from his gluteal and quadriceps muscles that a normal sprinter would. Other sources also credit core abdominal muscles and a faster arm swing. His trainer estimates that about 85 percent of his power comes from his <b>hips</b> <b>and</b> the rest from his knees. This results in a gait that waddles slightly, as Pistorius swings his upper body to balance the springing action of the blades. The blades compress under his weight, then release as he moves forward, providing forward thrust from the tips as they return to their molded shape. As they spring off, he swings them slightly out to the side and throws them forward for the next stride.|$|E

40|$|Background: Alterations in <b>hip</b> {{abductor}} strength <b>and</b> <b>hip</b> <b>and</b> knee adduction moments during gait {{are associated}} with knee osteoarthritis. This study examines the relationship between <b>hip</b> abductor strength <b>and</b> <b>hip</b> <b>and</b> knee adduction moments during gait in individuals with symptomatic medial knee osteoarthritis. Methods: Ninety-nine participants underwent maximal isometric hip abductor strength testing and 3 D gait analysis. Pearson correlations examined relationships between non-normalized maximal hip abductor strength (Nm), peak external <b>hip</b> <b>and</b> knee adduction moments (Nm) and knee adduction moment impulse (Nm∙s). Linear regressions examined these relationships while controlling for body size (height and mass) and walking speed. Findings: Positive relationships existed between non-normalized <b>hip</b> abductor strength <b>and</b> <b>hip</b> <b>and</b> knee adduction moments (r = 0. 28 and 0. 37, respectively, p 0. 05) but {{was a significant predictor}} of knee adduction moment impulse (B = 0. 05, p = 0. 005), explaining 6 % of the variance. Interpretation: While a significant relationship between <b>hip</b> abductor strength <b>and</b> knee adduction moment impulse was noted, hip abductor strength only explained a small amount of variance in the impulse. Our findings support previous research of healthy individuals and those with mild to moderate knee osteoarthritis <b>and</b> suggests <b>hip</b> abductor strength has little influence on <b>hip</b> <b>and</b> knee adduction moments during gait...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. [Purpose] The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{investigate}} the limb position at which the maximum toe-grip strength could be exerted as well as measurement reproducibility. [Subjects] Twenty healthy young women were selected. [Methods] We measured toe-grip strength under three conditions: 90 ° <b>hip</b> <b>and</b> knee flexion while sitting, 90 ° <b>hip</b> flexion <b>and</b> knee extension while sitting, and a standing position. [Results] We found that toe-grip strength was significantly lower in the 90 ° <b>hip</b> flexion <b>and</b> knee extension sitting position than in the 90 ° <b>hip</b> <b>and</b> knee flexion sitting position and standing position. Moreover, the 90 ° <b>hip</b> <b>and</b> knee flexion sitting position produced the best intraclass correlation coefficient (r = 0. 813). [Conclusion] The results suggest that 90 ° <b>hip</b> <b>and</b> knee flexion while sitting is the most suitable limb position for measuring toe-grip strength, as this position allows maximum strength to be exerted and allows measurements to be repeated...|$|R
40|$|T OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} if females presenting with patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS) from no discernable cause other than overuse demonstrate <b>hip</b> weakness <b>and</b> increased <b>hip</b> internal rotation, <b>hip</b> adduction, <b>and</b> knee valgus during stair descent. T BACKGROUND: Historically, PFPS {{has been viewed}} exclusively as a knee problem. Recent findings have indicated a possible association between <b>hip</b> weakness <b>and</b> PFPS. Researchers have hypothesized that patients who demonstrate hip weakness would exhibit increased hip internal rotation, <b>hip</b> adduction, <b>and</b> knee valgus during functional activities. To date, researchers have not simultaneously examined <b>hip</b> <b>and</b> knee strength and kinematics in subjects with PFPS to make this determination. T METHODS AND MEASURES: Eighteen females diagnosed with PFPS and 18 matched controls participated. Strength measures were taken for the <b>hip</b> external rotators <b>and</b> <b>hip</b> abduc-tors. <b>Hip</b> <b>and</b> knee kinematics were collected as subjects completed a standardized stair-stepping task. Independent t tests {{were used to determine}} between-group differences in strength and kine-matics during stair descent. T RESULTS: Subjects with PFPS generated 24 % less hip external rotator (P =. 002) and 26 % less hip abductor (P =. 006) torque. No between-group differences (P. 05) were found for average <b>hip</b> <b>and</b> knee transverse and frontal plane angles dur-ing stair descent. T CONCLUSION: Subjects with PFPS had signifi-cant hip weakness but did not demonstrate altered <b>hip</b> <b>and</b> knee kinematics as previously theorized. Additional investigations are needed to better understand the association between <b>hip</b> weakness <b>and</b> PFPS etiology...|$|R

5|$|In the summer, the Alpine chough feeds {{mainly on}} {{invertebrates}} collected from pasture, such as beetles (Selatosomus aeneus and Otiorhynchus morio {{have been recorded}} from pellets), snails, grasshoppers, caterpillars and fly larvae. The diet in autumn, winter and early spring becomes mainly fruit, including berries such as the European Hackberry (Celtis australis) and Sea-buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides), rose <b>hips,</b> <b>and</b> domesticated crops such as apples, grapes and pears where available. It has been observed eating flowers of Crocus vernus albiflorus, including the pistils, perhaps {{as a source of}} carotenoids. The chough will readily supplement its winter diet with food provided by tourist activities in mountain regions, including ski resorts, refuse dumps and picnic areas. Where additional food is available, winter flocks are larger and contain a high proportion of immature birds. The young birds principally frequent the sites with the greatest food availability, such as refuse dumps. Both chough species will hide food in cracks and fissures, concealing the cache with a few pebbles.|$|E
5|$|The {{most notable}} feature of Acrocanthosaurus was its row of tall neural spines, {{located on the}} {{vertebrae}} of the neck, back, <b>hips</b> <b>and</b> upper tail, which could be more than 2.5times {{the height of the}} vertebrae from which they extended. Other dinosaurs also had high spines on the back, sometimes much higher than those of Acrocanthosaurus. For instance, the unrelated Spinosaurus had spines nearly 2meters (6.5ft) tall, about 11 times taller than the bodies of its vertebrae. The lower spines of Acrocanthosaurus had attachments for powerful muscles like those of modern bison, probably forming a tall, thick ridge down its back. The function of the spines remains unknown, although they may have been involved in communication, fat storage, or temperature control. All of its cervical (neck) and dorsal (back) vertebrae had prominent depressions (pleurocoels) on the sides, while the caudal (tail) vertebrae bore smaller ones. This is more similar to carcharodontosaurids than to Allosaurus.|$|E

40|$|The huntingtin-interacting protein {{family members}} (<b>Hip</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Hip</b> 1 R in mammals and Sla 2 p in yeast) link clathrin-mediated {{membrane}} traffic to actin cytoskeleton dynamics. Genetic data in yeast have implicated the light chain subunit of clathrin in regulating this link. To test this hypothesis, the biophysical properties of mammalian <b>Hip</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Hip</b> 1 R <b>and</b> their interaction with clathrin light chain and actin were analyzed. The coiled-coil domains (clathrin light chain-binding) of <b>Hip</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Hip</b> 1 R {{were found to}} be stable homodimers with no propensity to heterodimerize in vitro.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Osteoarthritis {{constitutes}} a major musculoskeletal burden {{for the aged}} Australians. <b>Hip</b> <b>and</b> knee replacement surgeries are effective interventions once all conservative therapies to manage the symptoms have been exhausted. This study aims to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of <b>hip</b> <b>and</b> knee replacements in Australia. To our best knowledge, the study is the first attempt {{to account for the}} dual nature of <b>hip</b> <b>and</b> knee osteoarthritis in modelling the severities of right and left joints separately. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We developed a discrete-event simulation model that follows up the individuals with osteoarthritis over their lifetimes. The model defines separate attributes for right and left joints and accounts for several repeat replacements. The Australian population with osteoarthritis who were 40 years of age or older in 2003 were followed up until extinct. Intervention effects were modelled by means of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) averted. Both <b>hip</b> <b>and</b> knee replacements are highly cost effective (AUD 5, 000 per DALY and AUD 12, 000 per DALY respectively) under an AUD 50, 000 /DALY threshold level. The exclusion of cost offsets, and inclusion of future unrelated health care costs in extended years of life, did not change the findings that the interventions are cost-effective (AUD 17, 000 per DALY and AUD 26, 000 per DALY respectively). However, there was a substantial difference between <b>hip</b> <b>and</b> knee replacements where surgeries administered for hips were more cost-effective than for knees. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Both <b>hip</b> <b>and</b> knee replacements are cost-effective interventions {{to improve the quality of}} life of people with osteoarthritis. It was also shown that the dual nature of <b>hip</b> <b>and</b> knee OA should be taken into account to provide more accurate estimation on the cost-effectiveness of <b>hip</b> <b>and</b> knee replacements...|$|R

Case controlled studies were performed with 134 <b>hip</b> <b>and</b> 50 knee arthroplasties in obese patients. Each was matched individually with a control and their outcome compared. Log rank tests for equality of survival showed no difference in the survival for <b>hip</b> <b>and</b> knee arthroplasty at 11 and ten years, respectively. The obese group had significantly lower postoperative <b>hip</b> <b>and</b> knee scores at latest follow-up, especially in the range of motion. Overall patient satisfaction scores were comparable.
