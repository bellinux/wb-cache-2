50|$|Fraser and {{the rest}} of the {{remaining}} crew try to repair the leaks but their efforts are futile. Before they can escape, a panicked Daniels locks the bulkhead behind him leaving 3 men to drown but traps himself in the next compartment with his snagged clothing. Morozov closes the final bulkhead, leaving Daniels to drown and protecting Robinson, Tobin, and himself in the torpedo section where Robinson has hidden three escape suits. Robinson evacuates Tobin and Morozov and explains to Tobin that he will follow in the third suit using an <b>emergency</b> <b>lever.</b> Both men surface whereupon Morozov informs the young Tobin that there was no <b>emergency</b> <b>lever</b> and that Robinson had chosen to sacrifice himself. Minutes later the third suit appears containing some of the gold and a picture of Robinson's family.|$|E
50|$|Crunch: Players {{are hanging}} {{upside down in}} a crunch {{position}} by their legs from bamboo poles, with their heads partially submerged in separate water tanks. The players try to maintain 40-lb. weights on their chests by using their ab muscles, while trying to keep their heads above water. The opponent wins if a player surrenders by pulling an <b>emergency</b> <b>lever</b> inside the tank, which releases all the water.|$|E
5000|$|The Series 80 and Series 90 used a 344 cu. in. version (bore 3 5/16 in., stroke 5 in.) for 104 brake HP. Automatic vacuum-operated {{spark advance}} was another new feature {{replacing}} the steering column mounted spark lever although an <b>emergency</b> <b>lever</b> was now dash mounted. Buick scored another first in 1939 {{when it became}} the first company to introduce turn signals, which did not appear on other car brands until almost a decade later. [...] All 1939 models also had a steering column mounted shift lever.|$|E
50|$|The KTM class 82 three-car {{formation}} {{consists of}} two motor cabs {{at either end of}} the set and a single trailer car in between, the trailer car in between is equipped with a double-arm Z shaped pantograph for 25 kV AC electric pick up. Narrow gangways integrate the three-car sets, allowing full walking from cab to cab. Each car features two double-leaf electric plug doors at either side. Printed route maps are displayed each doors, along with <b>emergency</b> stop <b>levers.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Modes 1 and 2 were {{selected}} on the ground; whenever the autostabilizer was in use, the pilot had an <b>emergency</b> override <b>lever</b> available {{with which to}} revert to direct control mode in flight. The outputs from the three control systems were compared and a [...] "majority rule" [...] enforced, ensuring that a failure in a single system was overridden by the other two (presumably correct) systems. Any failure in a [...] "fly-by-wire" [...] pathway was indicated to the pilot as a warning, which he could either choose to ignore or respond to by switching to direct (manual) control.|$|R
2500|$|On July 21, 2015 {{a man at}} the L'Enfant Plaza station pulled an <b>emergency</b> stop <b>lever</b> after {{apparently}} missing his stop. [...] The man {{was captured}} on closed circuit television forcing open the doors of the stopped train and running down the platform with a young child in hand. [...] In accordance with Metro procedures, the entire line on which the train had stopped was secured with teams dispatched to review the situation. [...] The action caused extensive delays and led to outrage among Metro passengers. [...] Several days later, Metro Transit Police reported that the man had stopped the train after being separated from a second younger child on the train platform. [...] The man was questioned by police and no charges were filed [...]|$|R
50|$|Eliot, having sneaked {{onto the}} plane, attacks the criminals by {{knocking}} Eddie {{out with a}} fire extinguisher and blasting the extinguisher at Snake. On hearing the case is a bomb, Eliot hurls {{it out of the}} still open rear door, only for Snake to leap after it. In a memorable feat of dumb luck, Snake manages to cling onto the door's steps. Despite Eliot's insistence that the case is a bomb, Snake opens fire on him which prompts Eliot to pull the <b>emergency</b> <b>lever</b> which decouples the door. Snake plunges into the ocean with a defiant smile, still clinging to the bomb, which explodes safely in the water. Eliot is congratulated by the FBI, promised he will receive presidential cowboy boots and a hat, and told the events that took place are strictly top secret.|$|E
5000|$|When Andy boards {{his first}} train {{of the day}} on the Northern line, he notices that {{multiple}} people are staring at him; he looks in a window to find that Rachel has written the word [...] "TWAT" [...] on his forehead in lipstick. While he is attempting to remove all traces, a homeless man named Brian, {{one of the people}} staring at him before, comes to sit next to him. After a brief conversation, Andy finds out that Brian is going to the same place as him, Epping; Andy attempts to lose him at Tottenham Court Road, to no avail, and later tries to leave his company at Epping, which also does not work. On their journey back into central London, the pair encounter the first hindrance to their journey, when a Filipino man pulls the <b>emergency</b> stop <b>lever</b> at Stratford after failing to get off the train.|$|R
40|$|Dr C. Lever is {{a pioneer}} in {{endovascular}} infrarenal aneurysmectomy, {{with some of the}} best results published in the literature. He attempted an endovascular stent in an octogenarian that required an acute open repair. The procedure was touch-and-go and the postoperative course a train wreck, with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. After steadily deteriorating, the patient died. The son has filed a lawsuit claiming Dr Lever did not specify that a standard procedure might need to be done as an <b>emergency.</b> Dr <b>Lever</b> usually indicates an open procedure might be necessary, but the resident did not include whether or not Dr Lever did so in the informed consent note. Regarding technical details in the informed consent note:AAlways include operative details that will increase the risk, no matter how rare. BOperative details are not necessary. CComplications are the only necessary important components of informed consent documentation. DAs long as you postoperatively document what happened in the OR, you are legally and ethically all right. EEvery factor that could influence the patient's decision must be mentioned and then adequately documented...|$|R
50|$|In {{very much}} the same manner as with fire alarms, many <b>emergency</b> handles and <b>levers,</b> or handles that are not meant to be opened regularly, are {{enclosed}} in a thin metal or plastic security seal. The seal is thin, so as not to prevent the handle from being used (in due time), but only to alert maintenance/security personnel that the handle was indeed used.Many times, large sea-going shipping containers have such a metal ring or seal attached to them at the source port. After traveling at sea (and perhaps by land as well), the containers reach their destination, where each container is checked to have the seal properly in place (against a list of doublets - container/seal).|$|R
5000|$|Fifteen M3s {{were ordered}} by BMW Australia in 1994 to {{race in the}} Australian Super Production series. All were {{delivered}} to Tony Longhurst Racing for final preparation by the Frank Gardner run team. Eleven were {{made available to the}} general public (who had to possess a CAMS license to be allowed to buy one), while four were retained for the race series. The M3-R had locally sourced King springs fitted to Group N adjustable struts and rear perches, AP Racing twin plate clutch and four piston brake calipers, dual pickup sump, an oil restrictor in the head, A C Schnitzer cams, a 3.25:1 ratio medium case diff and M5 driveshaft, cold air snorkel into air filter box replacing left hand fog light, non-functional rear seat, air conditioner delete and more aggressive tune, GT front splitter and rear spoiler with extensions and gurney strips. This was the most powerful production E36 made with [...] A bolt-in FIA-approved roll cage was also a factory option (locally produced by Dencar) there were several differences between the cars depending on customer requirements, early numbers had non-staggered BBS wheels, later had staggered BBS wheels (individually numbered plaque fitted to centre console below <b>emergency</b> brake <b>lever)</b> ...|$|R
2500|$|This Batmobile's gadgets {{include a}} nose-mounted {{aluminum}} Cable Cutter Blade, Bat Ray Projector, Anti-Theft Device, Detect-a-scope, Batscope, Bat Eye Switch, Antenna Activator, Police Band Cut-In Switch, Automatic Tire Inflation Device, Remote Batcomputer—radio {{linked to the}} main Batcomputer in the Batcave, the Batphone, <b>Emergency</b> Bat Turn <b>Lever,</b> Anti-Fire Activator, Bat Smoke, Bat Photoscope, and many other Bat gadgets. If needed, the Batmobile is capable of a quick 180° [...] "bat-turn" [...] thanks to two rear-mounted ten-foot Deist parachutes. [...] The main license plate seen throughout the series was 2F-3567 (1966). Some changes were made during {{the run of the}} series, including different license plates (TP-3567; BT-1 and BAT-1), removal of the Futura steering wheel and substitution with a 1958 Edsel steering wheel, and the addition of extra gadgets such as a net in the trunk, remote-controlled driving, a rear-facing camera under the turbine exhaust port, and the Bat Ram.|$|R
50|$|Michael's {{official}} Medal of Honor citation reads:For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity {{above and}} {{beyond the call of duty}} while serving as pilot of a B17 aircraft on a heavy-bombardment mission to Germany, April 11, 1944. The group in which 1st Lt. Michael was flying was attacked by a swarm of fighters. His plane was singled out and the fighters pressed their attacks home recklessly, completely disregarding the Allied fighter escort and their own intense flak. His plane was riddled from nose to tail with exploding cannon shells and knocked out of formation, with a large number of fighters following it down, blasting it with cannon fire as it descended. A cannon shell exploded in the cockpit, wounded the copilot, wrecked the instruments, and blew out the side window. 1st Lt. Michael was seriously and painfully wounded in the right thigh. Hydraulic fluid filmed over the windshield making visibility impossible, and smoke filled the cockpit. The controls failed to respond and 3,000 feet were lost before he succeeded in leveling off. The radio operator informed him that the whole bomb bay was in flames as a result of the explosion of 3 cannon shells, which had ignited the incendiaries. With a full load of incendiaries in the bomb bay and a considerable gas load in the tanks, the danger of fire enveloping the plane and the tanks exploding seemed imminent. When the <b>emergency</b> release <b>lever</b> failed to function, 1st Lt. Michael at once gave the order to bail out and 7 of the crew left the plane. Seeing the bombardier firing the navigator's gun at the enemy planes, 1st Lt. Michael ordered him to bail out as the plane was liable to explode any minute. When the bombardier looked for his parachute he found that it had been riddled with 20mm. fragments and was useless. 1st Lt. Michael, seeing the ruined parachute, realized that if the plane was abandoned the bombardier would perish and decided that the only chance would be a crash landing. Completely disregarding his own painful and profusely bleeding wounds, but thinking only of the safety of the remaining crewmembers, he gallantly evaded the enemy, using violent evasive action despite the battered condition of his plane. After the plane had been under sustained enemy attack for fully 45 minutes, 1st Lt. Michael finally lost the persistent fighters in a cloud bank. Upon emerging, an accurate barrage of flak caused him to come down to treetop level where flak towers poured a continuous rain of fire on the plane. He continued into France, realizing that at any moment a crash landing might have to be attempted, but trying to get as far as possible to increase the escape possibilities if a safe landing could be achieved. 1st Lt. Michael flew the plane until he became exhausted from the loss of blood, which had formed on the floor in pools, and he lost consciousness. The copilot succeeded in reaching England and sighted an RAF field near the coast. 1st Lt. Michael finally regained consciousness and insisted upon taking over the controls to land the plane. The undercarriage was useless; the bomb bay doors were jammed open; the hydraulic system and altimeter were shot out. In addition, there was no airspeed indicator, the ball turret was jammed with the guns pointing downward, and the flaps would not respond. Despite these apparently insurmountable obstacles, he landed the plane without mishap.|$|R
