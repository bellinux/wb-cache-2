5|$|The mule, {{especially}} its fur, was intensely textured and detailed {{to make it}} look visually rough and bristly, and the mule itself weary and worn. The same techniques were applied to the red and yellow adornments draped and <b>hung</b> <b>over</b> the animal.|$|E
5|$|Andrew Prine, {{who played}} Norman Ramsey, wrote the last {{fifth of the}} film because it had no ending. Both Ben Johnson and he were <b>hung</b> <b>over</b> while filming the train scene after partying the night before. During the rain scene with Ramsey, a snake made its way on the set. Crew members were yelling at Andrew {{that it was a}} moccasin, but Prine wanted to finish his scene without reshooting, so the crew killed the snake afterwards. The last shot of the film where the killer is seen {{standing}} in line at the movie theater was Pierce's wife's idea.|$|E
5|$|The Knicks were shorthanded {{with their}} {{starting}} center, Phil Jordon, out sick. Jordon's illness was officially reported as influenza {{but it was}} widely suspected he was simply <b>hung</b> <b>over.</b> Jordon, in an early-season game, had played Chamberlain even, scoring 33points to the Warriors center's 34. The Knicks instead started , , second-year player Darrall Imhoff, a strong defensive player in college who led the California Golden Bears to the NCAA championship in 1959 and {{won a gold medal}} in the 1960 Summer Olympics. New York also had , , backup center Cleveland Buckner, a better shooter than a defender who Chamberlain overpowered for an NBA record 28points in one quarter two days earlier.|$|E

5|$|To {{celebrate}} their six-month anniversary, Long Island socialites Tony and Carlotta Milburn arrange a wild drinking party with friends, {{culminating in a}} stop at the restaurant owned by Faronea. They are unaware that Faronea is conspiring with Baptiste Bouclier, the chauffeur of party host Vic Huling, to kidnap Vic. The next morning the Milburns awake <b>hung</b> <b>over</b> to find Vic dead from a gunshot through the heart and his wife Bette missing. Tony calls his friend, district attorney Danny Harrison to investigate. Bette arrives with Billy Arliss at whose home she had slept. Because of their excessive drinking, no one can remember anything about what had happened the night before.

Just as the professor is about to reveal the murderer, he is murdered.|$|E
5|$|Vainio's friends Heikki Kauppinen and Reijo Tani quit {{drinking}} in 1972, {{and at first}} Vainio found their decision odd. When Vexi Salmi was hired by Fazer in 1970, Vainio and Salmi started drinking together often and sometimes even came to work with hangovers. On one occasion, Vainio forgot that {{he was supposed to}} have finished the text of an advertising tune. When the deadline arrived, Vainio was too <b>hung</b> <b>over</b> to finish the lyrics and eventually Salmi agreed to help by writing the lyrics for Vainio's composition. Vainio's alcohol use increased in the 1970s, and his parents watched without being able to do anything about it. It is reported that Vainio would not go to sleep at night unless he had liquor under his bed, and he always kept a bottle with him. Vainio began to realize that he could not live like this forever. By summer 1975 he decided that he needed to stop drinking altogether. He was especially helped in this decision through his meeting footballer Kai Pahlman, who told Vainio that he was surprised he was still alive. In late 1975, Vainio stayed sober for four months, but then caved in for a short time. In January 1976 he finally managed to {{quit drinking}} for good.|$|E

25|$|The tournament {{had been}} preceded by doubts and pessimism; many feared {{that it would}} produce one-sided-matches that would be unattractive to supporters.

25|$|When {{conservation}} {{work was}} being completed {{on the windows}} of the Great Hall, it was decided that the tapestries would remain in situ, with the risks of placing them in storage considered too great. The works were first covered in a protective material, before specially commissioned copies were <b>hung</b> <b>over,</b> allowing the Great Hall to keep its previous appearance.|$|E

Nevertheless, the Stars championship was upheld by the league.|$|E
25|$|Three square gates {{existed on}} {{the eastern side of the}} Kremlin wall, which in the 17th century, were known as: Konstantino-Eleninsky, Spassky, Nikolsky (owing their names to the icons of Constantine and Helen, the Saviour and St. Nicholas that <b>hung</b> <b>over</b> them).

25|$|At {{the same}} time the {{constant}} threat of Scottish and Spanish conflict, culminating in the Spanish Armada of 1588, <b>hung</b> <b>over</b> the iron trade and gave it resilience: one could not have enough cannons.

25|$|Joan's elderly mother {{lived to}} see the final verdict announced, and was present when the city of Orleans celebrated the event by giving a banquet for Inquisitor Bréhal on 27 July 1456.

25|$|Due to {{fire damage}} to {{infrastructure}} and extreme winds bringing down powerlines across the area, {{large parts of}} the city lost power.

On May 28, 1952 during the Republic Day celebrations in Germany, Mammed Amin Rasulzade raised the tricolor and asked for anyone who can be entrusted to take the flag back to Azerbaijan. Gulmirza Bagirov ultimately brought it to Azerbaijan in secret in the 1970s; this flag was <b>hung</b> <b>over</b> his house in Maştağa on January 20, 1990.|$|E
25|$|The {{area and}} traffic {{generated}} by transshipment was so extensive {{that a new}} station building was needed. Balthazar Conrad Lange had become NSB's head architect, and was issued the task of designing a new main station building. The second station building was located east of the old, at roughly {{the location of the}} current bus station. Also built in wood, it received a roof which <b>hung</b> <b>over</b> the platform. The old station building was converted to railway offices. The track out of the station was moved further away from the lakeshore. The new station was taken into use in 1880.|$|E
