5|$|Rumination {{syndrome}} {{is a condition}} which affects {{the functioning of the}} stomach and esophagus, also known as a functional gastroduodenal disorder. In patients that have a history of <b>eating</b> <b>disorders,</b> Rumination {{syndrome is}} grouped alongside <b>eating</b> <b>disorders</b> such as bulimia and pica, which are themselves grouped under non-psychotic mental disorder. In most healthy adolescents and adults who have no mental disability, Rumination syndrome is considered a motility disorder instead of an eating disorder, because the patients tend to have had no control over its occurrence and have had no history of <b>eating</b> <b>disorders.</b>|$|E

50|$|Another study {{specifically}} investigated {{whether a}} parental's <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> could predict <b>disordered</b> <b>eating</b> in their children.

This is, “of particular interest {{as it has been}} shown that maternal ED <b>disorders</b> predict <b>disordered</b> <b>eating</b> behaviour in their daughters.” This suggests that poor eating habits result as a coping mechanism for other direct issues presented by an unstable home environment.|$|R
40|$|AbstractEating {{disorders}} pose {{risks to}} health and wellbeing in young adolescents, but prospective studies of risk factors are scarce and this has impeded prevention efforts. This longitudinal study aimed to examine risk factors for <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> symptoms in a population-based birth cohort of young adolescents at 12 years. Participants from the Gateshead Millennium Study birth cohort (n =  516; 262 girls and 254 boys) completed self-report questionnaire measures of <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> symptoms and putative risk factors at age 7 years, 9 years and 12 years, including dietary restraint, depressive symptoms and body dissatisfaction. Body mass index (BMI) was also measured at each age. Within-time correlates of <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> symptoms at 12 years of age were greater body dissatisfaction for both sexes and, for girls only, higher depressive symptoms. For both sexes, higher <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> symptoms at 9 years old significantly predicted higher <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> symptoms at 12 years old. Dietary restraint at 7 years old predicted boys' <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> symptoms at age 12, but not girls'. Factors that did not predict <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> symptoms at 12 years of age were BMI (any age), girls’ dietary restraint at 7 years and body dissatisfaction at 7 and 9 years of age for both sexes. In this population-based study, different patterns of predictors and correlates of <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> symptoms were found for girls and boys. Body dissatisfaction, a purported risk factor for <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> symptoms in young adolescents, developed concurrently with <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> symptoms rather than preceding them. However, restraint at age 7 and <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> symptoms at age 9 years did predict 12 -year <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> symptoms. Overall, {{our findings suggest that}} efforts to prevent <b>disordered</b> <b>eating</b> might beneficially focus on preadolescent populations...|$|R
5|$|Neighbours storylines {{frequently}} {{focus on}} family problems, intergenerational clashes, school problems, romances and domestic issues. Despite the restrictive 6:30pm time slot, Neighbours has also covered many serious {{problems such as}} teenage pregnancy, marital breakdown, imprisonment, career problems, financial problems, pregnancy, abortion, <b>eating</b> <b>disorders,</b> alcoholism, adultery, drug use and drug trafficking, robbery, stalking, kidnapping, accidental death, hit-and-runs, murder, shootings, stabbings, and incest. In the 2000s and 2010s, the show dealt with controversial issues such as homosexuality, gambling, prostitution, surrogacy, and exotic dancing. Health issues were also focused on, including multiple sclerosis, bipolar disorder, epilepsy, amnesia, congenital diaphragmatic hernia, and alzheimer's disease.

5|$|Winehouse's {{battles with}} {{substance}} abuse were {{the subject of much}} media attention. In 2005, she went through a period of drinking, heavy drug use, and weight loss. People who saw her during the end of that year and early 2006 reported a rebound that coincided with the writing of Back to Black. Her family believes that the mid-2006 death of her grandmother, who was a stabilising influence, set her off into addiction. In August 2007, Winehouse cancelled a number of shows in the UK and Europe, citing exhaustion and ill health. She was hospitalised during this period for what was reported as an overdose of heroin, ecstasy, cocaine, ketamine and alcohol. In various interviews, she admitted to having such problems with self-harm, depression, and <b>eating</b> <b>disorders.</b>|$|E
5|$|Anxiety {{disorders}} and depression {{are the most}} common mental health issues for women. Depression is reported among lesbians at a rate similar to heterosexual women, although generalized anxiety disorder is more likely to appear among lesbian and bisexual women than heterosexual women. Depression is a more significant problem among women who feel they must hide their sexual orientation from friends and family, or experience compounded ethnic or religious discrimination, or endure relationship difficulties with no support system. Men's shaping of women's sexuality has proven to have an effect on how lesbians see their own bodies. Studies have shown that heterosexual men and lesbians have different standards for what they consider attractive in women. Lesbians who view themselves with male standards of female beauty may experience lower self-esteem, <b>eating</b> <b>disorders,</b> and higher incidence of depression. More than half the respondents to a 1994 survey of health issues in lesbians reported they had suicidal thoughts, and 18% had attempted suicide.|$|E
30|$|To {{investigate}} whether our finding identified genetic markers specific to BD with an <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> subphenotype or <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> per se, we tested a potential {{association of the}} genotype pattern of rule # 12978 with an <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> phenotype comprising anorexia and bulimia in a population-based sample from Australia (n[*]=[*] 1672, 12.9 % with a diagnosis of anorexia or bulimia). We did not see an association of the genotype pattern of rule # 12978, suggesting that our approach has detected a genetic marker for BD with comorbid <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> rather than for <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> per se.|$|R
40|$|Abstract“Eating {{disorder}} NOS” is {{the most}} common <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> encountered in outpatient settings yet it has been neglected. The aim {{of this study was to}} describe the characteristics of <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> NOS, establish its severity, and determine whether its high relative prevalence might be due to the inclusion of cases closely resembling anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa. One hundred and seventy consecutive patients with an <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> were assessed using standardised instruments. Operational DSM-IV diagnoses were made and <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> NOS cases were compared with bulimia nervosa cases. Diagnostic criteria were then adjusted to determine the impact on the prevalence of <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> NOS. Cases of <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> NOS comprised 60. 0 % of the sample. These cases closely resembled the cases of bulimia nervosa in the nature, duration and severity of their psychopathology. Few could be reclassified as cases of anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa. The findings indicate that <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> NOS is common, severe and persistent. Most cases are “mixed” in character and not subthreshold forms of anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa. It is proposed that in DSM-V the clinical state (or states) currently embraced by the diagnosis <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> NOS be reclassified as one or more specific forms of <b>eating</b> <b>disorder...</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{desire to}} self-harm {{is a common}} symptom of {{borderline}} personality disorder. People with other mental disorders may also self-harm, including those with depression, anxiety disorders, substance abuse, <b>eating</b> <b>disorders,</b> post-traumatic stress disorder, schizophrenia, and several personality disorders. Self-harm can also occur in high-functioning individuals who have no underlying mental health diagnosis. The motivations for self-harm vary. Some {{use it as a}} coping mechanism to provide temporary relief of intense feelings such as anxiety, depression, stress, emotional numbness, or a sense of failure. Self-harm is often associated with a history of trauma, including emotional and sexual abuse. There are a number of different methods {{that can be used to}} treat self-harm and which concentrate on either treating the underlying causes or on treating the behaviour itself. When self-harm is associated with depression, antidepressant drugs and therapy may be effective. Other approaches involve avoidance techniques, which focus on keeping the individual occupied with other activities, or replacing the act of self-harm with safer methods that do not lead to permanent damage.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} form of self-harm is using a sharp object to cut one's skin, but self-harm also covers a wide range of {{behaviours}} including burning, scratching, banging or hitting body parts, interfering with wound healing (dermatillomania), hair-pulling (trichotillomania) and the ingestion of toxic substances or objects. Behaviours associated with substance abuse and <b>eating</b> <b>disorders</b> are usually not considered self-harm because the resulting tissue damage is ordinarily an unintentional side effect. However, the boundaries are not always clearly defined and in some cases behaviours that usually fall outside the boundaries of self-harm may indeed represent self-harm if performed with explicit intent to cause tissue damage. Although suicide is not the intention of self-harm, the relationship between self-harm and suicide is complex, as self-harming behaviour may be potentially life-threatening. There is also an increased risk of suicide in individuals who self-harm and self-harm is found in 40–60% of suicides. However, generalising self-harmers to be suicidal is, in the majority of cases, inaccurate.|$|E
5|$|Johansson {{has criticized}} {{the media for}} {{promoting}} an image that causes unhealthy diets and <b>eating</b> <b>disorders</b> among women, believing that being skinny is not attractive. In one article she wrote for HuffPost, Johansson encouraged the reader to maintain a healthy body. She appeared nude {{on the cover of}} the March 2006 issue of Vanity Fair alongside actress Keira Knightley and fully clothed fashion designer Tom Ford. This caused some controversy as it was believed the photo demonstrated that women are forced to flaunt their sexuality more often than men. In September 2011, nude photographs of Johansson hacked from her cell phone were published online. Following an FBI investigation, the perpetrator was arrested, pled guilty, and was sentenced to 10 years in prison. Johansson said the photos had been sent to her then-husband, Reynolds, three years before the incident. In 2014, Johansson won a lawsuit against French publisher, JC Lattès, for using her name and featuring a look-alike model of her in the novel The First Thing We Look At by Gregoire Delacourt. Johansson was awarded $3,400, a fraction of the $68,000 she had claimed.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis study {{analyzed}} {{the importance of}} exercise frequency on <b>eating</b> <b>disordered</b> behaviors and psychological well-being {{and the ability of}} various exercises, individual, and psychological variables to predict <b>eating</b> <b>disordered</b> behaviors. The following characteristics were measured: <b>eating</b> <b>disordered</b> behaviors, dieting habits, physical activity, goal orientation, social physique anxiety, and self-esteem. The results showed that regular exercise was reported more frequently by males, those with high attraction towards exercise, and adolescents with fewer dieting behaviors. Moreover, adolescents who exercised regularly showed fewer <b>eating</b> <b>disordered</b> behaviors and had more positive psychological functioning. The results also confirmed the importance of various exercises, individual, and psychological variables in predicting <b>eating</b> <b>disordered</b> behaviors. In conclusion, this study validates the importance of regular exercise for promoting psychological well-being and preventing <b>eating</b> <b>disordered</b> behaviors in adolescence...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{research}} indicates that 2 % to 4 % of the population meet diagnostic criteria for the newly proposed binge <b>eating</b> <b>disorder,</b> {{and that it is}} much more common (30 %) among the treatment-seeking obese. Although recognized as a significant problem, binge <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> is l 1 l not well understood, and there is debate about whether binge <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> is a distinct disorder. It has been argued that binge <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> is simply a variant or milder form of bulimia nervosa and not a separate and distinct disorder. Researchers have begun to study this population in greater depth in order to assess the characteristics of individuals with binge <b>eating</b> <b>disorder,</b> the similarities and differences between individuals with binge <b>eating</b> <b>disorder,</b> bulimia nervosa, and obese individuals who do not engage in binge eating, and the effectiveness of various treatments for binge <b>eating</b> <b>disorder.</b> Previous reviews of the literature (using non-meta-analytic strategies) have examined these areas and have yielded inconsistent conclusions. Therefore, a more comprehensive, current, and empirical integration of the data was conducted. In total, 297 studies of individuals with binge <b>eating</b> <b>disorder,</b> bulimia nervosa and/or obese individuals who do not engage in binge eating were collected, coded, and statistically analyzed across studies (by calculating standardized mean difference effect sizes). The key characteristics of individuals with binge <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> were assessed, diagnostic groups were systematically compared, and treatment outcomes (from 19 studies) were evaluated. The results indicated that individuals with binge <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> have a number of differences from both bulimia nervosa and obese non binge eating individuals. However, the extent of these differences was not great, and there was a general trend for binge <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> individuals to fall between the two groups on most measures of disturbed eating and psychopathology. These findings tend to support the continuum/variant conceptualization of binge <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> rather than that of a distinct disorder. In addition, data from primary research studies on the treatment of binge <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> indicated that, overall, psychosocial interventions were helpful in decreasing binge eating and psychopathological symptoms, but were less effective at reducing weight. The clinical implications of these findings are discussed, as are suggestions for future research...|$|R

RESULTS: White subjects with binge <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> reported significantly higher rates of sexual abuse, physical abuse, bullying by peers, and discrimination than healthy comparison subjects. Only rates of discrimination were significantly higher in white women with binge <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> than in matched psychiatric comparison subjects. In black women with binge <b>eating</b> <b>disorder,</b> rates of sexual abuse, physical abuse, and bullying by peers-but not discrimination-were significantly higher than in healthy comparison women. Rates of sexual abuse were significantly higher in black women with binge <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> than in psychiatric comparison subjects.
