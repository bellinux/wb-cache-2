The <b>Dublin</b> <b>system</b> also increases pressures on the external border regions of the EU, where the majority of asylum seekers enter EU and where states are often least able to offer asylum seekers support and protection.|$|E
50|$|On 23 May 2005, the Minister for Communications, Noel Dempsey, in a {{government}} press release announced that postcodes would be introduced in Ireland by 1 January 2008. In November 2005, the National Statistics Board issued a report welcoming the decision and making recommendations as to its implementation. They supported a point-based postcode system that used grid reference/GPS technology to provide a relatively clear-cut, low cost approach to allocating a postcode to an address. This avoids trying to group households together into small area clusters. It was later announced that the postcodes would include the one- or two-character county codes currently used in vehicle registration plates, making them alphanumeric, with the existing <b>Dublin</b> <b>system</b> retained.|$|E

5000|$|The Dublin Regulation (Regulation No. 604/2013; {{sometimes}} the Dublin III Regulation; previously the Dublin II Regulation and Dublin Convention) is a European Union (EU) law that determines the EU Member State responsible to examine {{an application for}} asylum seekers seeking international protection under the Geneva Convention and the EU Qualification Directive, within the European Union. It {{is the cornerstone of}} the <b>Dublin</b> <b>System,</b> which consists of the Dublin Regulation and the EURODAC Regulation, which establishes a Europe-wide fingerprinting database for unauthorised entrants to the EU.

40|$|According to {{member states}} and EU officials, the European Union is now slowly {{entering}} {{a period of}} ‘post crisis. ’ In this fragile period of stability, the European Commission has begun its task of strengthening the EU’s legislative framework on asylum. The {{focal point of the}} Commission’s task has been the reform of the <b>Dublin</b> <b>system</b> which, during the ‘asylum crisis,’ had almost collapsed. This policy brief has three aims. Firstly, it examines how the unprecedented movement of over one million persons seeking international protection to the EU in 2015 led to the fragmentation of the <b>Dublin</b> <b>system.</b> Secondly, it examines the main flaws of the <b>Dublin</b> <b>system,</b> namely the disconnect between the unchanged status quo on the Dublin rules and the ever-changing political and economic environment of the EU. Finally, it examines the Commission’s proposal for the recast of the <b>Dublin</b> <b>system,</b> assessing whether the new elements are adequate in resolving the key problems of the system. It is argued that although the reform does address, to a limited extent, the problems of secondary movement and the overburdening of some member state asylum systems, the reform does not sufficiently resolve the key flaws of Dublin in light of potential future migratory challenge...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to analyze {{the application of the}} <b>Dublin</b> <b>system</b> in the Czech Republic. The descriptive part of the thesis is mapping the development of the <b>Dublin</b> <b>system,</b> criteria and mechanisms for determining the Member State responsible for examining an asylum application lodged in one of the Member States, and Eurodac database, complementing the entire <b>Dublin</b> <b>system.</b> The descriptive part is followed by analytical part. This part analyzes the Dublin cases and their links to asylum requests. Specifically, it is concerned with the number of Dublin cases in the Czech Republic together with their breakdown to sent and received requests and also breakdown according to nationalities of the Dublin cases. The analysis concludes that the Dublin mode contributed to the decrease of the asylum requests in the Czech Republic, but it has not influenced the nationality composition of the asylum seekers.

40|$|This Policy Brief {{argues that}} the newly adopted EU {{temporary}} relocation (quota) system constitutes a welcome yet timid step forward in addressing a number of central controversies of the current refugee debate in Europe. Two main challenges affect the effective operability of the new EU relocation model. First, EU member states’ asylum systems show profound (on-the-ground) weaknesses in reception conditions and judicial/administrative capacities. These prevent a fair and humane processing of asylum applications. EU states are not implementing the common standards enshrined in the EU reception conditions Directive 2013 / 33. Second, the new relocation system constitutes a {{move away from the}} much-criticised <b>Dublin</b> <b>system,</b> but it is still anchored to its premises. The <b>Dublin</b> <b>system</b> is driven by an unfair and unsustainable rule according to which the first EU state of entry is responsible for assessing asylum applications. It does not properly consider the personal, private and family circumstances or the preferences of asylum-seekers. Policy Recommendations In order to respond to these challenges, the Policy Brief offers the following policy recommendations: The EU should strengthen and better enforce member states’ reception capacities, abolish the current <b>Dublin</b> <b>system</b> rule of allocation of responsibility and expand the new relocation distribution criteria to include in the assessment (as far as possible) asylum-seekers’ preferences and personal/family links to EU member states. EU member countries should give priority to boosting their current and forward-looking administrative and judicial capacities to deal and welcome asylum applications. The EU should establish a permanent common European border and asylum service focused on ensuring the highest standards through stable operational support, institutional solidarity across all EU external borders and the practical implementation of new distribution relocation criteria...|$|E

30|$|The article {{examines}} the evolution of concepts of solidarity and trust in the Common European Asylum System by analysing the legislative and judicial development of the <b>Dublin</b> <b>system</b> of intra-EU transfers of asylum seekers. The article argues that concepts of solidarity and trust which focus exclusively on the needs and interests of EU Member States are inadequate to address the requirement for the EU to respect fully human rights, in particular after the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty. The article puts forward a concept of solidarity based on the individual which would ensure the full respect {{of the rights of}} asylum seekers.|$|E
40|$|Situated as the {{cornerstone}} of the Common European Asylum System, the EU’s <b>Dublin</b> <b>system</b> functions as the legal mechanism for determining Member State responsibility for the processing of asylum claims. Controversial from inception, it has been subject to extensive criticism that speaks not only to the distributional inequalities that it produces among the Member States, but also to its potentially detrimental impact on the human rights of asylum seekers. Despite these problems, however, the core features of the system as originally agreed in the 1990 Dublin Convention have remained remarkably resilient over the course of two reforms – one in 2003, and one in 2013. At the same time, the EU’s governance landscape as it pertains to asylum policy-making has undergone a marked transformation. While Dublin I was the product of intergovernmentalism, both Dublin II and Dublin III were negotiated as part of the EU acquis communitaire, the former following the partial communitarisation of asylum policy-making and the latter following its full communitarisation. Though the specific changes to the institutional features of policymaking that this transition has entailed have been both theoretically expected and empirically proven to {{have a positive effect on}} EU policy output, the overall stability of the <b>Dublin</b> <b>system</b> in the face of these changes leaves it unclear as to what extent the ‘promise of communitarisation’ has been delivered in this particular case. How then do we explain the perseverance of a system that has not only failed to provide adequate standards of protection to those seeking it within EU borders, but which has also continually disadvantaged some of the very Member States party to its terms? And what impact, if any, has the communitarisation of asylum policy-making had on the attempts at its reform? This research traces the evolution of the <b>Dublin</b> <b>system</b> from its initial formation through to its current state, by analysing the negotiations that produced each of the three Dublin agreements in order to explain both the system’s emergence and its on-going stability. Using a rational choice institutionalist framework, it finds that the Dublin system’s endurance can ultimately be credited to the deliberate choices that have been made by both the Member States and the EU’s supranational institutions in pursuit of their preferences (bolstered or weakened by their relative strength of position) in the context of the (either empowering or constraining) institutional settings within which the reform negotiations took place...|$|E
