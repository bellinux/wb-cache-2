Favreau explained that marketing would show [...] "only a brief glimpse of the aliens of the title" [...] before the film is released.

Originally scheduled to promote the album after its release, the tour became a showcase for the new songs. An extra concert at the Palais Theatre, Victoria was added to film footage for the deluxe edition of the album. Sebastian performed songs from previous albums {{as well as new}} songs. He felt it was the best tour he had done, saying [...] "I pretty much put every cent back into the tour and really stepped up the production and the lighting, it's a lot bigger and better. I'm playing some 3000-seat venues and a bunch of them are sold out, so <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> I'm not compromising.

2500|$|In interviews, Foster rarely {{talks about}} her private life, and she has {{explained}} that she [...] "values privacy against all else" [...] due to having {{spent most of her}} life in the public eye.

She met Bernard on the set of Sommersby (1993) and was in a relationship with her from 1993 to 2008. In April 2014, Foster married actress and photographer Alexandra Hedison. She stated in 2011 that having children has made her take on fewer projects: [...] "It is a big sacrifice to leave home. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> that I feel passionate about the movies I do because it is a big sacrifice... Even if you take the average movie shoot of four months – you have three weeks' prep, press duties here and abroad, dubbing and looping, magazine covers, events and premieres – that's eight months out of a year. That's a long time. If you do two movies back-to-back, you're never going to see your children." ...|$|E

2500|$|Talking {{about the}} title track [...] "Louder", Michele has said, [...] "It's a song that, no matter what, I can play in my car with the windows down. I feel like it shows off my voice as a singer, which is really {{important}} to me, because that’s what I do. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> that every song on my record is fun and enjoyable, but also, you hear my voice in them." [...] Michele also stated, [...] "I didn't want to find songs that I had to change myself for. I wanted to find songs that would only highlight my sound and were unique to me. I didn't want to fit any mold. I {{wanted it to be}} something that couldn't be replicated by anyone else. It was important to me that the album began with [...] "Cannonball" [...] and ended with [...] "If You Say So". I have to acknowledge what I've been through this year. It was really difficult, which I think is represented in [...] "If You Say So" [...] and a song like [...] "Cannonball" [...] represents finding strength and hope. These are the two sides of my life right now. The grief, but also the search for strength and hope. I really wanted those two songs to bookend the album. Really let everyone know where I'm at." ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{focused on}} his {{opposition}} to abortion and gun control, {{as well as his}} support for lower taxes and free-market health care solutions. [...] He told the CPAC audience that he arrived in Washington as [...] "a foot soldier in the Reagan Revolution", and addressed the issue of illegal immigration - one of the major issues where conservatives have attacked McCain. He said that [...] "it would be among my highest priorities to secure our borders first", before addressing other immigration laws. [...] Mike Huckabee spoke to CPAC two days later and said, [...] "I know that there was some speculation that I might come here today to announce that I would be getting out of the race. But <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> you understand. Am I quitting? Well, let's get that settled right now. No, I'm not. And the reason is simple—I never learned arithmetic. You see folks, while I didn't get a college degree in mathematics and writing, I majored in miracles. Mathematically impossible miracles. It is because I go back to that which helped crystallize in me a conservative viewpoint as a teenager when it wasn't easy or popular to be a Republican or a conservative in my hometown, because I do believe that America is about making choices, not simply echoing that of others. Let others join the [...] "Me, too" [...] crowd. But I didn't get where I am today and I didn't fight the battles in a state that, when I became its governor, was 90 percent Democrat, by simply echoing the voices of others. I did it by staking out a choice, stating that choice, making that choice and fighting for that choice, to believe that some things were right, some things were wrong, and it's better to be right and even to not win than it is to be wrong and {{to be a part of}} the crowd." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ringer was not {{selected}} in the first 4 rounds of the draft, where he was projected to go by some. Instead, Ringer was selected by the Tennessee Titans in the 5th round of the 2009 NFL Draft, 173rd overall, the 11th RB taken overall. At the time of being drafted, {{he was one of}} eight Running Backs on the Titans roster. Terry McCormick of the Nashville City Paper, when grading the Titans draft, gave the Ringer pick an [...] "A". Ringer said on his Twitter page about being drafted “Titans! I can’t tell you how excited I am!”. He was the first (and only) MSU player drafted this year. Ringer said of his future pro career, [...] "I definitely have something to prove with me showing that I am just as good, if not better, than a lot of the running backs that went above me. I don't want {{to be one of those}} running backs who is titled as, He was a good running back in college and went to the NFL and became a bust. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> I continue to be called a great running back also in the NFL." [...] He mentioned of where he would fit in, [...] "I would say I fit in pretty well. I know Chris Johnson is kind of like the super-fast one, and LenDale White is like the really big one. I would kind of be in the middle." [...] Ringer is expected to [...] play special teams and operate as a third-down back. Ringer said of the running back situation in Tennessee, [...] "I feel very confident in my abilities. I feel like I'm definitely going to learn a lot from the vets. I'm very happy to be in a room with LenDale White and Chris Johnson. I'm going to make sure to play my role and push them in practice. I'm also going to make sure I ... continue to do what I can do to help Tennessee." [...] Because 23 was taken by Donnie Nickey, Ringer was assigned #3, a number normally prohibited for use by running backs. He kept the number until early August, when he switched to number 21.|$|E

5000|$|The Haus of Gaga {{is modeled}} after Andy Warhol's Factory and emulates the {{creative}} atmosphere {{it is known}} for. Inspired by Warhol's concepts, his ideas are often referenced in Gaga's work and the innovative technologies conceived by the Haus.

[...] "He was able <b>to</b> <b>make</b> commercial art that was taken seriously as fine art ... that's what I'm doing too." [...] The team is composed of {{people from around the}} world.

It's a whole amazing creative process that’s completely separate from the label.By integrating the themes explored in Gaga's music into her appearance, the Haus idealizes a lifestyle hybrid of pop culture, art, and technology.|$|R
