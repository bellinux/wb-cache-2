2500|$|More trouble {{followed}} Jones {{after the}} altercation, when drug dealer Darryl Jerome Moore was arrested. After the arrest, Moore {{told the police}} about his phone conversations with Jones. [...] "We gotta slow <b>down,</b> <b>man.</b> We gotta get him focused on football, man." [...] Moore {{is alleged to have}} said. Wiretapped phone conversations between Moore and his friends revealed Moore talking about how Jones bet on college games to earn quick money. [...] "You know, I was talkin' to him the other day about smokin', and he was like 'man, if I didn't smoke I couldn't take all the stress that I'm dealing with right now,'" [...] Moore said.

2500|$|Cranston drew further {{attention}} in late 1905 when he published a further {{article in the}} Boston Journal opining that athletics were being overdone at universities. Under the headline, [...] "Wishes He Had Not Been a Famous Athlete When In College," [...] Cranston wrote:"I have had several serious sicknesses since I left college which I attribute to the great strain of my athletic training. On the whole I can't say that athletics have benefitted me any in my business career. I sincerely believe I {{would have been better}} off in my life since college if I had left athletics alone. ... I've never received any benefit in business life from athletics. I am not a broken <b>down</b> <b>man</b> by any means, but I only speak the truth when I say I should have been better off had I left athletics alone." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Give {{him some}} in the tea," [...] {{suggested}} Gys, noting that Maurie swayed a little. [...] "Sit <b>down,</b> <b>man,</b> and be comfortable. That's it. I'd give a million dollars for your nerve." ...|$|E

You know that I hate it. You fidget me beyond endurance. You, a doctor--you are enough to drive a patient into an asylum. Sit <b>down,</b> <b>man,</b> and let me have my rest!" ...|$|E
60|$|In {{the mean}} time Blanche {{remained}} portentously {{quiet in the}} upper regions of the house; while Lady Lundie steadily pursued her inquiries down stairs. She got on from Jonathan (last of the males, indoors) to the coachman (first of the males, out-of-doors), and dug <b>down,</b> <b>man</b> by man, through that new stratum, until she struck the stable-boy at the bottom. Not an atom of information having been extracted in the house {{or out of the}} house, from man or boy, her ladyship fell back on the women next. She pulled the bell, and summoned the cook--Hester Dethridge.|$|E
50|$|Downing College Boat Club (or DCBC) is the rowing {{club for}} members of Downing College, Cambridge. <b>Downing</b> <b>men</b> have not been below the top 9 boats for over 3 decades, on {{occasion}} being the only boat club with a second boat in the first division, and regularly ahead of other college first boats.|$|R

60|$|At six {{the next}} morning, {{scorching}} with whiskey, yet ever himself, {{he stood at}} the bar putting every man's hand down. The way of it was that two men faced each other across a corner, their right elbows resting on the bar, their right hands gripped together, while each strove to press the other's hand <b>down.</b> <b>Man</b> after man came against him, but no man put his hand down, even Olaf Henderson and French Louis failing despite their hugeness. When they contended it was a trick, a trained muscular knack, he challenged them to another test.|$|E
6000|$|... "Walk in, Sergeant, walk in, my good friend," [...] said old Lundie heartily, as his {{inferior}} {{stood in}} a respectful attitude {{at the door of}} a sort of library and bedroom into which he had been ushered;--"walk in, and take a seat on that stool. I have sent for you, man; to discuss anything but rosters and pay-rolls this evening. It is now many years since we have been comrades, and 'auld lang syne' should count for something, even between a major and his orderly, a Scot and a Yankee. Sit ye <b>down,</b> <b>man,</b> and just put yourself at your ease. It has been a fine day, Sergeant." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Lie <b>down,</b> <b>man,</b> lie down!" [...] {{he shouted}} to Atkins. But the warning was too late; the moment Simcoe turned the natives had turned also, {{and as they}} reached the water's edge half a dozen spears were flung. Two of them struck Atkins full in the body, and with a cry he threw up his arms and fell {{over the side of the}} canoe. Then came several {{splashes}} in the water. Simcoe drew the pistols from his companion's belt, and, raising himself high enough to look over the stern, shot two of the savages who were wading out waist deep, and were but a few paces behind.|$|E

25|$|On the Giants' {{first drive}} {{of the fourth}} quarter, Manning {{completed}} a 45-yard pass to rookie tight end Kevin Boss. Following three runs by Bradshaw and a 17-yard reception by Smith on third <b>down,</b> <b>Manning</b> finished the 7-play, 80-yard drive with a 5-yard touchdown pass to David Tyree, giving New York a 10–7 lead with 11:05 left in the game.|$|R
6000|$|The {{quotation}} which I {{have given}} from Mercer's book turns my thoughts {{in the direction}} of the British military reminiscences of that period, less numerous, less varied, and less central than the French, but full of character and interest all the same. I have found that if I am turned loose in a large library, after hesitating over covers for half an hour or so, it is usually a book of soldier memoirs which I take <b>down.</b> <b>Man</b> is never so interesting as when he is thoroughly in earnest, and no one is so earnest as he whose life is at stake upon the event. But of all types of soldier the best is the man who is keen upon his work, and yet has general culture which enables him to see that work in its due perspective, and to sympathize with the gentler aspirations of mankind. Such a man is Mercer, an ice-cool fighter, with a sense of discipline and decorum which prevented him from moving when a bombshell was fizzing between his feet, and yet a man of thoughtful and philosophic temperament, with a weakness for solitary musings, for children, and for flowers. He has written for all time the classic account of a great battle, seen from the point of view of a battery commander. Many others of Wellington's soldiers wrote their personal reminiscences. You can get them, as I have them there, in the pleasant abridgement of [...] "Wellington's Men" [...] (admirably edited by Dr. Fitchett)--Anton the Highlander, Harris the rifleman, and Kincaid of the same corps. It is a most singular fate which has made an Australian nonconformist clergyman the most sympathetic and eloquent reconstructor of those old heroes, but it is a noble example of that unity of the British race, which in fifty scattered lands still mourns or rejoices over the same historic record.|$|E
60|$|The general placed {{himself at}} their head. The {{officers}} drew their revolvers. The men {{were instructed to}} use the bayonet only. Then they advanced. The ground is by nature broken and confused to an extraordinary degree. Great rocks, undulations and trees rendered all movements difficult. Frequent tents, sheds and other buildings increased the intricacies. Amidst such surroundings were the enemy, numerous and well armed. The twelve men charged. The tribesmen advanced to meet them. The officers shot <b>down</b> <b>man</b> after man with their pistols. The soldiers bayoneted others. The enemy drew off discomfited, but half the party were killed or wounded. The orderly was shot dead. A sapper and a havildar of the 24th were severely wounded. The general himself {{was struck by a}} sword on the neck. Luckily the weapon turned in his assailant's hand, and only caused a bruise. Captain Holland was shot through the back at close quarters by a man concealed in a tent. The bullet, which caused four wounds, grazed his spine. The party were now too few to effect anything. The survivors halted. Lieutenant Climo took the wounded officer back, and collecting a dozen more men of the 24th, returned to the attack. The second attempt to regain the Quarter Guard was also unsuccessful, and the soldiers recoiled with further loss; but with that undaunted spirit which refuses to admit defeat they continued their efforts, and at the third charge dashed across the open space, bowling over and crushing back the enemy, and the post was recovered. All the ammunition had, however, been carried off by the enemy, and as the expenditure of that night had already been enormous, it was a serious loss. The commissariat lines were at length cleared of the tribesmen, and such of the garrison as could be spared were employed in putting up a hasty defence across the south entrance of the enclosure, and clearing away the cook-houses and other shelters, which might be seized by the enemy.|$|E
