5|$|A snail {{does not}} have a dart to fire the very first time it mates, because the first mating is {{necessary}} to trigger the process of dart formation. Once a snail has mated, it fires a dart before some, but not all, subsequent matings. A snail often mates without having a dart to use, because <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> time to create a replacement dart. In the case of the garden snail Cornu aspersum, <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> a week for a new dart to form.|$|E

5|$|The 2015 Amstel Gold Race was the 50th {{edition of}} the Amstel Gold Race one-day race. It took place on 19 April and was the {{eleventh}} race of the 2015 UCI World Tour. The Amstel Gold Race {{is part of the}} Ardennes classics season, although <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> place in the Limburg region of the Netherlands rather than in the Belgian Ardennes. <b>It</b> <b>takes</b> place in the week before La Flèche Wallonne and Liège–Bastogne–Liège, the other principal Ardennes classics. The defending champion in the 2015 {{edition of the}} race was Philippe Gilbert, who had won the race three times and had also won the 2012 world championships on a very similar course.|$|E
5|$|The Moran model assumes {{overlapping}} generations. At {{each time}} step, one individual is chosen to reproduce and one individual is chosen to die. So in each timestep, {{the number of}} copies of a given allele can go up by one, go down by one, or can stay the same. This means that the transition matrix is tridiagonal, which means that mathematical solutions are easier for the Moran model than for the Wright–Fisher model. On the other hand, computer simulations are usually easier to perform using the Wright–Fisher model, because fewer time steps need to be calculated. In the Moran model, <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> N timesteps to get through one generation, where N is the effective population size. In the Wright–Fisher model, <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> just one.|$|E

5|$|The first {{ionization}} energy is the energy <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> to remove one electron from an atom, the second {{ionization energy}} is the energy <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> {{to remove a}} second electron from the atom, and so on. For a given atom, successive ionization energies increase with the degree of ionization. For magnesium as an example, the first ionization energy is 738kJ/mol {{and the second is}} 1450kJ/mol. Electrons in the closer orbitals experience greater forces of electrostatic attraction; thus, their removal requires increasingly more energy. Ionization energy becomes greater up and {{to the right of the}} periodic table.|$|E
