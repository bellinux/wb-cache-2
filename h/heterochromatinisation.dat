40|$|Using RNA {{interference}} (RNAi) we {{have conducted}} a functional analysis of the HP 1 -like chromobox gene pchet 2 during embryogenesis of the mealybug Planococcus citri. Knocking down pchet 2 expression results in decondensation of the male-specific chromocenter that normally arises from the developmentally-regulated facultative <b>heterochromatinisation</b> of the paternal chromosome complement. Together with {{the disappearance of the}} chromocenter the staining levels of two associated histone modifications, tri-methylated lysine 9 of histone H 3 [Me(3) K 9 H 3] and tri-methylated lysine 20 of histone H 4 [Me(3) K 20 H 4], are reduced to undetectable levels. Embryos treated with double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) targeting pchet 2 also exhibit chromosome abnormalities, such as aberrant chromosome condensation, and also the presence of metaphases that contain ‘lagging’ chromosomes. We conclude that PCHET 2 regulates chromosome behavior during metaphase and is a crucial component of a Me(3) K 9 H 3 -HP 1 -Me(3) K 20 H 4 pathway involved in the facultative <b>heterochromatinisation</b> of the (imprinted) paternal chromosome set.

40|$|<b>Heterochromatinisation</b> of pericentromeres, {{which in}} mice consist of arrays of major {{satellite}} repeats, {{are important for}} centromere formation and maintenance of genome stability. The dysregulation of this process {{has been linked to}} genomic stress and various cancers. Here we show in mice that the proteasome binds to major satellite repeats and proteasome inhibition by MG 132 results in their transcriptional de-repression; this de-repression is independent of cell-cycle perturbation. The transcriptional activation of major satellite repeats upon proteasome inhibition is accompanied by delocalisation of heterochromatin protein 1 alpha (HP 1 α) from chromocentres, without detectable change in the levels of histone H 3 K 9 me 3, H 3 K 4 me 3, H 3 K 36 me 3 and H 3 acetylation on the major satellite repeats. Moreover, inhibition of the proteasome was found {{to increase the number of}} chromocentres per cell, reflecting destabilisation of the chromocentre structures. Our findings suggest that the proteasome plays a role in maintaining heterochromatin integrity of pericentromeres...|$|E
40|$|A {{critical}} step in X-chromosome inactivation (XCI), {{which results in}} the dosage compensation of X-linked gene expression in mammals, is the coating of the presumptive inactive X chromosome by the large noncoding Xist RNA, which then leads to the recruitment of other factors essential for the <b>heterochromatinisation</b> of the inactive X and its transcriptional silencing. In an approach aimed at identifying genes implicated in the X-inactivation process by comparative transcriptional profiling of female and male mouse gastrula, we identified the Eif 1 gene involved in translation initiation and RNA degradation. We show here that female embryonic stem cell lines, silenced by RNA interference for the Eif 1 gene, are unable to form Xist RNA domains upon differentiation and fail to undergo X-inactivation. To probe further an effect involving RNA degradation pathways, the inhibition by RNA interference of Rent 1, a factor essential for nonsense-mediated decay and Exosc 10, a specific nuclear component of the exosome, was analysed and shown to similarly impair Xist upregulation and XCI. In Eif 1 -, Rent 1 -, and Exosc 10 -interfered clones, Xist spliced form(s) are strongly downregulated, while the levels of unspliced form(s) of Xist and the stability of Xist RNA remain {{comparable to that of}} the control cell lines. Our data suggests a role for mRNA nuclear degradation pathways in the critical regulation of spliced Xist mRNA levels and the onset of the X-inactivation process...|$|E
40|$|The Su(var) 3 - 7 {{protein is}} {{essential}} for fly viability, and several lines of evidence support its key importance in heterochromatin formation: it binds to pericentric heterochromatin, it potently suppresses variegation and it interacts with HP 1. However, the mode of action of Su(var) 3 - 7 is poorly understood. Here we investigate in vivo the consequences of increased Su(var) 3 - 7 expression on fly viability and chromatin structure. A large excess of Su(var) 3 - 7 induces lethality, whereas lower doses permit survival and cause spectacular changes in the morphology of polytene chromosomes in males, {{and to a lesser}} extent in females. The male X is always the most affected chromosome: it becomes highly condensed and shortened, and its characteristic banding pattern is modified. In addition, Su(var) 3 - 7 was found over the complete length of all chromosomes. This event coincides with the appearance of heterochromatin markers such as histone H 3 K 9 dimethylation and HP 1 at many sites on autosomes and, more strikingly, on the male X chromosome. These two features are strictly dependent on the histone-methyltransferase Su(var) 3 - 9, whereas the generalised localisation of Su(var) 3 - 7 is not. These data provide evidence for a dose-dependent regulatory role of Su(var) 37 in chromosome morphology and heterochromatin formation. Moreover they show that Su(var) 3 - 7 expression is sufficient to induce Su(var) 3 - 9 -dependent ectopic <b>heterochromatinisation</b> and suggest a functional link between Su(var) 3 - 7 and the histone-methyltransferase Su(var) 3 - 9...|$|E
40|$|Friedreich’s ataxia (FRDA) {{is known}} to be {{provoked}} by an abnormal GAA-repeat expansion located in the first intron of the FXN gene. As a result of the GAA expansion, patients exhibit low levels of FXN mRNA, leading to FRDA. Here, via chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), the presence of a RNA pol II transcriptional pausing site at exon 1 of the FXN gene was demonstrated. At this site, FRDA EBVcell lines exhibited elevated levels of the negative elongation factor NELF-E depending on the presence of a GAA repeat expansion compared to controls. This site may represent a rate-limiting step for FXN transcription and consequently provide a means to modify transcription levels in FRDA. Moreover, RNA pol II pausing site binding factors, such as NELF-E, were influenced by Nicotinamide treatment, a HDAC class III inhibitor. Therefore, factors sensitive to chromatin changes may influence the regulation of RNA pol II pausing and also balance otherwise positive chromatin changes. This new finding could explain the relatively minor effects of different drug approaches to up-regulate this gene. Furthermore, CTCF and the histone demethylase LSD 1 were also found to be located at the FXN pausing site. Results suggest a function for LSD 1 in demethylating H 3 K 4 me 2 at the pausing site and potentially also in demethylating H 3 K 9 me 3 in the case of frequently transcribed expanded GAA repeats. Therefore, LSD 1 might {{play a crucial role in}} preventing <b>heterochromatinisation</b> of a euchromatic gene. Using primary transcript RNA-FISH, a delay in RNA pol II release from the pausing site and furthermore a dramatic loss of RNA pol II elongation in the presence of expanded GAA repeats was seen. The identified and characterised transcriptional pausing site at FXN is likely to play a repressive role and participates in the pathogenesis of FRDA.

40|$|Heterochromatin is {{implicated in}} the {{negative}} regulation of gene expression. To understand the effects of heterochromatin on RNA polymerase-II (RNAPII) mediated transcription, this study focused on the FXN gene where abnormal silencing induced by expanded (GAA) n repeats causes Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA), an incurable neurological disorder. Here, the silenced FXN locus {{was found to be}} modified by the heterochromatic histone marks H 3 K 9 me 3, H 3 K 27 me 3 and bound by HP 1 β. This pathological <b>heterochromatinisation</b> was partially reversed by the histone deacetlyase inhibitor nicotinamide, which upregulated FXN expression to potentially therapeutic levels in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo. In addition, RNAPII was shown to be stalled in the first exon of the FXN gene and degraded by the proteasome in FRDA but not in healthy cells. This was linked to increased proteasome binding at the -silenced FXN locus in a pattern reminiscent of the heterochromatin marks. Importantly, proteasome inhibition restored stalled RNAPII levels in FRDA and upregulated FXN to potentially therapeutic levels in vitro. Moreover, experiments with healthy human cells and wild-type mouse thymus revealed enriched levels of proteasome binding in other heterochromatic regions (e. g. pericentromeric repeats and SINEs) which were also de-repressed by proteasome inhibition; suggesting that the effect seen on the pathological FXN locus represented a specific example of a more generalised phenomenon. Overall, this introduces a novel mechanism whereby heterochromatin might be maintained in a silent state. In this thesis, heterochromatin effects were also investigated in relation to sexually dimorphic gene expression. Microarray analyses revealed hundreds of autosomal genes sensitive to sex chromosome-complement rather than gender. HP 1 β-repressed genes and SINE elements were over-represented within this gene group suggesting a potential link between heterochromatin, proteasome-dependent silencing and sexually dimorphic gene expression. The results reveal a novel layer in the regulation of sexually dimorphic genes with implications for understanding sex-bias in physiology and disease.

40|$|Background: Friedreich's ataxia is a {{progressive}} degenerative disorder caused by deficiency of the frataxin protein. Expanded GAA repeats within intron 1 of the frataxin (FXN) gene lead to its <b>heterochromatinisation</b> and transcriptional silencing. Preclinical {{studies have shown}} that the histone deacetylase inhibitor nicotinamide (vitamin B 3) can remodel the pathological heterochromatin and upregulate expression of FXN. We aimed to assess the epigenetic and neurological effects and safety of high-dose nicotinamide in patients with Friedreich's ataxia. Methods: In this exploratory, open-label, dose-escalation study in the UK, male and female patients (aged 18 years or older) with Friedreich's ataxia were given single doses (phase 1) and repeated daily doses of 2 – 8 g oral nicotinamide for 5 days (phase 2) and 8 weeks (phase 3). Doses were gradually escalated during phases 1 and 2, with individual maximum tolerated doses used in phase 3. The primary outcome was the upregulation of frataxin expression. We also assessed the safety and tolerability of nicotinamide, used chromatin immunoprecipitation to investigate changes in chromatin structure at the FXN gene locus, and assessed the effect of nicotinamide treatment on clinical scales for ataxia. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials. gov, number NCT 01589809. Findings: Nicotinamide was generally well tolerated; the main adverse event was nausea, which in most cases was mild, dose-related, and resolved spontaneously or after dose reduction, use of antinausea drugs, or both. Phase 1 showed a dose-response relation for proportional change in frataxin protein concentration from baseline to 8 h post-dose, which increased with increasing dose (p= 0 · 0004). Bayesian analysis predicted that 3 · 8 g would result in a 1 · 5 -times increase and 7 · 5 g in a doubling of frataxin protein concentration. Phases 2 and 3 showed that daily dosing at 3 · 5 – 6 g resulted in a sustained and significant (p< 0 · 0001) upregulation of frataxin expression, which was accompanied by a reduction in heterochromatin modifications at the FXN locus. Clinical measures showed no significant changes. Interpretation: Nicotinamide was associated with a sustained improvement in frataxin concentrations towards those seen in asymptomatic carriers during 8 weeks of daily dosing. Further investigation of the long-term clinical benefits of nicotinamide and its ability to ameliorate frataxin deficiency in Friedreich's ataxia is warranted...|$|E
