50|$|In 1887, the Dawes Act {{proposed}} to divide tribal land and parcel out 160 acres (0.65 km²) {{of land to}} each head of <b>family.</b> Such <b>allotments</b> were {{to be held in}} trust by the government for 25 years, then given to owners with full title, so they could sell it or mortgage it. As individual natives sold their land, the total held by the native community shrank by almost half. The individualized system undermined the traditional communal tribal organization. Furthermore, a majority of natives responded to intense missionary activity by converting to Christianity. The long-term goal of Dawes Act was to integrate natives into the mainstream; the majority accepted integration and were absorbed into American society, leaving a trace of native ancestry in millions of American families. Those who refused to assimilate remained in poverty on reservations, supported until now by Federal food, medicine and schooling. In 1934, national policy was reversed again by the Indian Reorganization Act which tried to protect tribal and communal life on reservations.|$|R

After the Second World War many families from other poorer parts of Yugoslavia migrated to Vojvodina and so found themselves in a complete new living conditions.

In the period from 1946 do 1948 497 colonist’s households were settled here. 61 od them comprised the group of s. c. interior colonists (originated from Vojvodina) and 436 the group of exterior colonists (originated from ohter regions of Yugoslavia).

40|$|In this study, {{we compare}} two {{economic}} models of urban gardening in Ljubljana, Slovenia. First is an avoided costs model (ACM) {{and the second}} one is a business model (BM). Comparison is made to exemplify the main economic {{differences between the two}} models. The difference is that producers under the BM sell surplus products, which is not the case under the ACM. The main aim {{of this study is to}} present an analysis of the phenomenon of urban gardening as a BM for small <b>family</b> home or <b>allotment</b> gardens. The survey was performed through Internet questionnaires and in some cases also with on-site interviews. Totally 127 urban gardeners from Ljubljana municipality participated in the research. The average ACM urban gardeners had on 1 m 2 revenue of 4. 86 EUR/m 2, costs of 1. 48 EUR/m 2 and gross margin (savings) of 3. 38 EUR/m 2. Altogether, ACM brings savings of approximately 462. 7 EUR per average size garden (136. 69 m 2) or 203 EUR per median size garden (60 m 2) to the average gardener. The average BM gardener sold to the wholesale company approximately 107. 0 kg of vegetables per year from 32. 48 m 2 of production area for an average retail price of 1. 46 EUR/kg and earning revenue of 156. 44 EUR/year. Costs were approximately 21. 27 EUR/year. Therefore, the gross margin or earning from surpluses sold was approximately 135. 17 EUR/year for the average BM gardener, which was 4. 29 EUR/m 2 or 1. 26 EUR/kg of produce. The study offers evidence that the ACM can be upgraded with the BM. For example, if a family of two retired members have an average garden of 136 m 2, they can produce vegetables for four people. Consequent surpluses for two family members can be sold for extra money. The BM should be more promoted among urban gardeners as it can offer additional income and in certain cases, when a hobby becomes a profession, also a full-time job...|$|R
5000|$|Thus, in late 1735 Oglethorpe sent Captain Dunbar and Lt. Hugh MacKay to the Highlands of Scotland {{to recruit}} {{potential}} settlers for Georgia's Altamaha frontier settlement. Many Scots {{were eager to}} come. Home life was rough due to English oppression and a feudal system that tied many Scottish families to small unproductive lands with limited opportunities, but North America offered plenty of hope. To lure them, the Trustees offered each <b>family</b> 50 acre <b>allotments,</b> something most Scotsmen never even dreamed of owning in their homeland. Also, recruiters told the Scots each man would be armed with a firelock, a broadsword, and an axe. Recently, the English had passed laws disarming the Scots and making it unlawful for them to bear their traditional weapons. They were also to be given cattle, farming implements, and seed for crops. 177 Scots boarded the Prince of Wales in November 1735, en route to their new home in Georgia. Of these, most came from the Inverness area and {{were a part of}} the Chattan Confederation. They consisted of McIntoshes, McDonalds, MacBeans, MacKays, Frasers, Forbes, Clarks, Baillies, Cameron, {{and a host of other}} traditional Highland clan names. They disembarked at Savannah in early January 1736, and a short time later made their way to the new settlement on the Altamaha. Their settlement began at [...] "Barnwell's Bluff", near the old ruins of Fort King George. Oglethorpe visited the site the following February and was informed that the Scots had chosen to name their town Darien. This was to honor the previous Scottish settlement of Darien that had occurred earlier on the Isthmus of Panama in 1695, only to be subsequently destroyed by the Spanish. On his visit, Oglethorpe dressed in the traditional Highland kilt to show his respect for the Scots. As an additional show of respect, he refused comfortable sleeping quarters and preferred to sleep with the Highlander men out under a large oak tree. One other issue probably addressed by Oglethorpe at this time was related to the place of settlement. He clearly must not have liked Lower Bluff where old Fort King George once was and at some point, he ordered the Scots to move their town further up the bluff (the modern-day site of the Darien bridge).|$|R
40|$|The ODA TC {{pilot project}} "Small scale {{irrigation}} using collector wells - Zimbabwe" began in October 1992. This report outlines progress made on all aspects {{during the fourth}} six months of work. The six project schemes are now complete. Two additional schemes for Plan International (NGO) are also near to completion. As planned, these schemes represent a range of physical, social, economic and institutional settings. The number of families obtaining domestic water from 011 k-funded schemes is 1319 {{and the number of}} <b>families</b> with <b>allotments</b> on the community gardens is approximately 577. Individual socio-economic baseline surveys have been carried out for the six project communities and now provide data on social, institutional, economic and agricultural aspects of rural life before scheme installation. This information is being used in monitoring and evaluating the impacts of the schemes on the communities and in drawing up guidelines for the design and implementation of future schemes. Shortage of water is the principal problem reported by respondents at all sites. At some, the priority is for a cleaner and more reliable source of domestic water. At others, the priority is for water to allow vegetables to be grown for home consumption and for sale. Monitoring of garden performance is proceeding well. The first scheme completed in Chivi District in 1991 continues to produce high returns, recording an average gross margin of Z 19, 900 per ha per year for three years of operation. First gross margins recorded at pilot project schemes are similarly high, being Z 18, 204 and Z 25, 444 at Muzondidya and Gokota respectively. The figure for Gokota actually represents less than one complete year and is an indication of the excellent returns possible from small areas intensively cultivated if water can be made available in these dry areas. Social and institutional "teething" problems were encountered at most of the earlier schemes. However, production figures indicate that these have been overcome. Valuable lessons have also been learnt by project staff that led to significant improvements in implementation of the later schemes. Good progress has been made on the comparison of well design at each scheme location. Total water use from the collector wells is typically 15 - 20 cubic metres per day. Improvement to yield by radial drilling has been very good at four of the five sites drilled to date, and both pump tests and well performance suggest that the wells at Dekeza, Nemauka and Mawadze could in fact now support a garden larger than 0. 5 ha if required. First results comparing performance of the collector wells with other well types at each scheme location indicate that single high yielding boreholes may be technically viable in some areas. However, real comparison can only be made when pump tests are completed during a period of drought. Economic viability of siting high yielding boreholes to support community gardens is also shown to depend very much on the success rate of drilling. Excellent progress has been made to distil experiences and knowledge gained during this pilot phase and to draft guidelines to assist future development of community gardens using groundwater. A decision tree is being developed that shows key steps now known to be important to achieve successful collaboration with communities and to help ensure implementation of schemes more likely to be sustainable from a social point of view. This also includes the key steps required to determine the most cost-effective well design to support a community garden in any area. Indicative values of agroeconomic performance of different types of irrigation system operating in Southern Zimbabwe highlight the important role that community gardens using groundwater can play, addressing in particular the primary needs of improved health and poverty alleviation in poor rural communities in dry areas. Indeed, much interest is being expressed by various organisations in the region wishing to develop these type of schemes. It is timely, therefore, for discussion amongst senior GoZ staff and ODA to determine how best to proceed from this pilot phase and to develop groundwater based community gardens on a wider scale...|$|R

Members of THE BRYANT SERVICE CLUB, Thanks {{sincerely}} for {{the very}} attractive and specially delicious box of sugared candy. With my appreciation are included those of my buddies as we all had a hand it its rapid disappearance. As Prof “Vinal” use to point out – It was DEMAND versus SUPPLY in a Seller’s market. The bidders were hungry and numerous with the resultant increased trend in consumption – while it lasted. All of us enjoyed its tasty contents. My thanks are really double for somehow or other I received tow boxes within the week, much to the pleasure of my buddies and I will confess, to myself. To return {{it would have made}} me a social outcast among these bunch of wolves – truly all swell fellows. I hope our greed does not deprive another fellow alumnus from receiving a package. Thanks too, for you interesting letter. It was swell to read of the many things you are doing and also the news and whereabouts of other fellow alumnus (Correction – alumni) PS I looked it up. “Chet” Desormeaux was in my class. I’m glad to hear he’s well on the road to recovery. The other news of Leo Ringuette struck very close to home. I read about it first in the local paper I receive and then from my folks while home on my last pass. He was one swell fellow and will be missed by all who knew him. We in the service do not lack for want of cigarettes, especially the more popular brands. On the post here we are limited in our purchases to two packs a day which should be sufficient for even a “chain smoker”. We may purchase 1 of Camels or Chesterfields, and 1 of another brand such as Lucky Strike or Old Gold. Speaking of the shortage of yarn, our outfit has already received a sweater per person. We were issued them two weeks ago. Long sleeve in style and tops in quality, so many of us are appreciating, these cool nights, the yarn you folks now miss. I might add that this island post is the coldest post in the United States according to Believe It or Not “Ripley”, in the winter-time. The past few weeks the weather here has been really grand – Summer must be almost here. You may be interested to know of the USAFI (United States Armed Forces Institute) Courses that are in languages, trades, sciences, technician jobs, and business courses that include law, money 2 ̆ 6 banking, bookkeeping, accounting, auditing, C. P. A., public finance, cost accounting, advertising, merchandising, business management and many others. They also offer College Extension Courses where credits may be obtained for further college education. I have enrolled in their correspondent course taking “Essentials of Accounting” for a refresher or review of my past studies. I was honestly surprised in the completeness of the course as it was far above what I expected it to be. The textbook, while not so detailed or completer as the four volumes by “Finney” I used in school, is very well written and quite comprehensive/ It’s a large text book written by W. A. Paton, Ph. D., C. P. A. and is titled, “Essentials of Accounting”. Each month you have to submit at least one lesson to be graded and returned. Your progress depends entirely upon your own initiative. The enrollment fee was 2. 00 which entitles you to the course you select and to take any other course or courses you desire to go on with upon completion of your present course. This enrollment fee covers your membership and the complete cost of your course and other additional courses you latter take up. It is a great opportunity for any enlisted man who desires to further his education or study and learn some special subject. For the past two years and more my job in the Army has been that of a personnel clerk. Their job is to prepare the payrolls, keep the service records {{of the men in the}} battery they are assigned to, make out applications for bonds, insurance, <b>family</b> allowances, <b>allotments,</b> (also Furloughs), and to take care of any other financial problems or difficulties a soldier may have. Most all of the work is turned out by a typewriter. Speed is necessary though not easily acquired if not already possessed as most all work is done on form paper. We also have a goodly share of correspondence to carry on. Added to this are the applications for OCS, Infantry, Paratroops, Discharges, and etc, which manage to keep us fairly busy. The Army – red tape – is not mere fiction. That’s all for now. Thanks again for you swell letter and most delicious candy. The thoughtful way you keep us in mind is warmly and heartily felt by us. Your club is rendering a great service in a very fine way. I know all of us who happen to be on the receiving end sincerely appreciate your gifts, your time and your efforts.
