2500|$|The XLR {{connector}} is a {{style of}} <b>electrical</b> <b>connector,</b> primarily found on professional audio, video, and stage lighting equipment. The connectors are circular in design and have {{between 3 and 7}} pins. They are most commonly associated with balanced audio interconnection, including AES3 digital audio, but are also used for lighting control, low-voltage power supplies, and other applications. XLR connectors are available from a number of manufacturers and are covered by an international standard for dimensions, IEC 61076-2-103. [...] They are superficially similar to the older and smaller DIN connector range, but are not physically compatible with them.|$|E

The physical binding and electrical connectivity of the nanowire <b>electrical</b> <b>connectors</b> {{arise from the}} van der Waals interactions between the conductive metallic shells of the engaged nanowire forests. Specifically, the nanofibrillar structure of the connectors causes an amplification of the contact area between the interpenetrating nanowire arrays, resulting in strong adhesion with relatively low interfacial resistance. The nanowire <b>electrical</b> <b>connectors</b> may enable the exploration {{of a wide range}} of applications involving reversible assembly of micro- and macroscale components with built-in electrical interfacing. open 151...|$|R
