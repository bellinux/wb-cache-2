Mr. Welles has put upon the screen a motion picture that really moves.|$|E

5|$|Homer {{returns to}} {{apologize}} but is turned {{away by a}} fearful Burns. With no one around, Burns learns to <b>do</b> <b>things</b> himself and soon becomes completely self-reliant. After thanking Homer for making him learn that he can fend for himself, Burns fires Smithers when he returns from his vacation. Smithers and Homer engage in a fight within Burns' office which ends when Burns accidentally falls out the window. Burns is seriously injured and becomes reliant on Smithers once again. In gratitude, Smithers sends Homer a fruit basket.|$|E

5|$|In {{people with}} AD, the {{increasing}} impairment {{of learning and}} memory eventually leads to a definitive diagnosis. In a small percentage, difficulties with language, executive functions, perception (agnosia), or execution of movements (apraxia) are more prominent than memory problems. AD does not affect all memory capacities equally. Older memories of the person's life (episodic memory), facts learned (semantic memory), and implicit memory (the memory of the body on how to <b>do</b> <b>things,</b> such as using a fork to eat or how to drink from a glass) are affected {{to a lesser degree}} than new facts or memories.|$|E
5|$|Nearly {{every action}} (or lack thereof) affects how the player is judged by their followers: the player {{may be seen}} as a good god, an evil one, or {{in-between}} the two. The land, interface (including the hand), and music change according to that alignment. A good god's temple is brightly coloured, while an evil god's is designed to look intimidating. It is not necessary to consistently perform acts of either alignment and a mixture of the two can be used to stay neutral. The player has two advisors, one good and the other evil, who try to persuade the player to <b>do</b> <b>things</b> their according to their alignment.|$|E
5|$|The {{change in}} {{partners}} leads the Simpson family to begin arguing and aggressively competing against one another. The tournament takes place, {{and in the}} stands, are leading tennis professionals Andre Agassi, Pete Sampras, Venus Williams, and Serena Williams. At the tournament, Homer ditches Lisa for Venus Williams. In response, Marge replaces Bart with Serena Williams as her partner. Ultimately, Serena and Venus replace Marge and Homer with Sampras and Agassi, respectively. This forces the family {{to go back to}} the bench and resume their normal places in the family. As they enjoy the exhibition of top-class tennis, they agree that it is better to watch things than to <b>do</b> <b>things,</b> and Homer offers to buy the family dinner with money he took from Sampras' wallet.|$|E

5|$|In {{terms of}} combat, the game allows players {{to create and}} {{customise}} their own move combos in the Combo Lab, which uses four categories of fighting moves called Pressens. This is done by chaining them together, made possible through earning PMP (Procedural Mastering Power), with a limit of four combos being active at any one time. The Pressen moves are Regen (healing), Power (damage), Chain (duplication and doubling of previous moves) and Cooldown (regeneration of S-Pressen energy). There are 50,000 possible Pressen combinations. Five S-Pressen moves will {{be made available to}} the player {{over the course of the}} game: the moves enable them to <b>do</b> <b>things</b> like stun groups of enemies, move at high speed and land more hits, or turn hostile robots into allies which then self-destruct. Players also have access to projectile-based weapons like the Spammer and Junk Bolt.|$|E
5|$|Nynaeve, {{under the}} {{instruction}} of Cadsuane, locates Tam al'Thor, Rand's father, who meets with Rand {{in an attempt to}} break his emotional isolation. Rand becomes angry when he learns that Tam was sent by Cadsuane, nearly killing his father before fleeing in horror at what he had almost done. Rand Travels to the Seanchan-held city of Ebou Dar, intending to destroy their entire army, but he becomes reluctant to act after seeing how peaceful the city is. Nearly mad with rage and grief, he Travels to the top of Dragonmount, the location where he killed himself in a past life. Angry at the futility of life bound to the Wheel, he uses the Choedan Kal to draw enough power to destroy the world. Lews Therin, a voice in Rand's head from his past life, suggests that by being reborn one has the opportunity to <b>do</b> <b>things</b> right. Agreeing, Rand turns the power of the Choedan Kal against itself, destroying it. Rand is finally able to laugh again.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps {{the reason}} people rarely talk about his {{formidable}} attributes as a singer is that he makes so little fuss about them. That celebrated ease of his has been too little understood.

Como got them together so completely that the muscles don't even show. It seems effortless, but a good deal of effort has gone into making it seem so. Como is known to be meticulous about rehearsal of the material for an album. He tries things out in different keys, gives the song thought, makes suggestions, tries it again, and again, until he is satisfied. The hidden work makes him look like Mr. Casual, and too many people are taken in by it — but happily so.|$|E

5|$|Pickingill {{was also}} known for his purported ability to control animals, namely horses, and it was {{believed}} that when he struck a hedgerow with his stick, game animals would run out that could then be caught, killed and eaten. It was also rumoured that he could <b>do</b> <b>things</b> faster than ordinary human beings, and that he could do an hour's job in only a few minutes, with some believing that he got his imps—his familiar spirits—to do the job for him. Maple also noted that people who visited his cottage reported seeing ornaments and furniture dancing around the room of their own accord; the folklorist believed that this story had originated in a Dutch folkloric tradition that may have been imported to Essex when many Dutch migrants settled there in the seventeenth century.|$|E
