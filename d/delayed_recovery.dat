As late as November, most of the Internet was still inaccessible to residents and international phone calls were impossible; as late as December, most web content hosted outside the autonomous region remained off-limits to all but a few journalists, and residents had to travel to Dunhuang 14 hours away to access the Internet normally. Within the city, only about 100 local sites, such as banks and regional government websites, could be accessed. Both incoming and outgoing international phone calls were disallowed, so Ürümqi residents could only communicate by calling intermediaries in other cities in China who would then place the international calls. The communications blackout generated controversy even within China: Yu Xiaofeng of Zhejiang University criticised the move, and many Ürümqi locals said it hurt businesses and <b>delayed</b> <b>recovery,</b> whereas David Gosset of the Euro-China forum argued that the government had the right to shut down communications for the sake of social stability; some locals believed that getting away from the Internet even improved their quality of life.|$|E

"When The Gallup Organizations poll in 1939 asked, Do {{you think}} the {{attitude}} of the Roosevelt administration toward business is <b>delaying</b> business <b>recovery?</b> the American people responded yes by a margin of more than two-to-one.

[...] Fortunes Roper poll found in May 1939 that 39% of Americans thought the administration had been <b>delaying</b> <b>recovery</b> by undermining business confidence, while 37% thought it had not. But it also found that opinions on the issue were highly polarized by economic status and occupation. In addition, AIPO found in the same time that 57% believed that business attitudes toward the administration were <b>delaying</b> <b>recovery,</b> while 26% thought they were not, emphasizing that fairly subtle differences in wording can evoke substantially different polling responses.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} and analyze the nursing diagnosis of <b>delayed</b> surgical <b>recovery,</b> its defining characteristics and related factors according to NANDA-I taxonomy, through an integrative review. 34 articles were selected from MEDLINE, CINAHL, LILACS, and BDENF databases. In these, the <b>delayed</b> surgical <b>recovery</b> diagnosis was identified in a study. However, it was possible to identify the defining characteristics: difficulty to move about (36. 4 %) which requires help to complete self-care (27. 3 %) and the evidence of interrupted healing of the surgical site (27. 3 %). Additionally, the related factors were: pain (34. 2 %), postoperative surgical site infection (31. 7 %), postoperative expectations (31. 7 %), and obesity (2. 4 %). Other identified related factors were: advanced age (38. 9 %), diabetes mellitus (22. 2 %) and nutritional deficiency (16. 7 %).

40|$|Interest {{aggregation}} is {{the primary}} feature of named-data networking (NDN). The interest aggregation reduces dupli-cated transmissions for multiple requests on the same data, but can <b>delay</b> loss <b>recovery</b> when data packets are lost.

50|$|Dr. Hans-Jörg Barth, German {{geographer}} (2001 research report): The study demonstrated that, {{in contrary}} to previously published reports e.g. already 1993 by UNEP, several coastal areas even in 2001 still show significant oil impact {{and in some}} places no recovery at all. The salt marshes which occur at almost 50% of the coastline show the heaviest impact {{compared to the other}} ecosystem types after 10 years. Completely recovered are the rocky shores and mangroves. Sand beaches are on the best way to complete recovery. The main reason for the <b>delayed</b> <b>recovery</b> of the salt marshes is the absence of physical energy (wave action) and the mostly anaerobic milieu of the oiled substrates. The latter is mostly caused by cyanobacteria which forms impermeable mats. In other cases tar crusts are responsible. The availability of oxygen is the most important criteria for oil degradation. Where oil degrades it was obvious that benthic intertidal fauna such as crabs re-colonise the destroyed habitats long before the halophytes. The most important paths of regeneration are the tidal channels and the adjacent areas. Full recovery of the salt marshes will certainly need some centuries.|$|E

40|$|Purpose. To {{determine}} the predictive value of surgery-related variables for <b>delayed</b> inpatient functional <b>recovery</b> (i. e., >/= 3 days to reach functional independence) after TKA. Method. 193 consecutive people undergoing TKA {{were included in}} this prospective cohort study. Inpatient functional recovery was measured daily using the Iowa Level of Assistance scale (ILAS). Two persons reviewed medical records to extract patient characteristics (i. e., age, sex, and BMI) and surgical factors (i. e., blood loss, tourniquet time, postoperative morphine use, and surgical experience). Odds ratios (OR) and area under the curves (AUC) were calculated to {{determine the}} predictive value of the putative factors and of the model on <b>delayed</b> functional <b>recovery,</b> respectively. Results. <b>Delayed</b> functional <b>recovery</b> was apparent in 76 (39 %) people. Higher age, female sex, and higher BMI were all independent risk factors for <b>delayed</b> functional <b>recovery</b> (AUC (95 %-CI); 0. 72 (0. 65 - 0. 80)), whereas blood loss (OR (95 %-CI); 1. 00 (0. 99 - 1. 01)), tourniquet time (OR = 1. 00 (0. 98 - 1. 02)), and postoperative morphine use (OR = 0. 88 (0. 37 - 2. 06)) did not statistically improve the predictive value of the model, while surgical experience did (OR = 0. 31 (0. 16 - 0. 64); AUC = 0. 76 (0. 69 - 83)). Conclusions. Surgery-related factors contribute little to the patient-related characteristics in a predictive model explaining <b>delayed</b> functional <b>recovery</b> after TKA in daily orthopaedic practice...|$|R
