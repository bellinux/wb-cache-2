5|$|A {{visit by}} Dahlia Brinkley, the only Springfield Elementary {{graduate}} ever to enter an Ivy League college, gives Lisa a severe inferiority complex {{because she is}} involved in very few extracurricular activities. When Ned Flanders resigns as coach of Bart's Little League team, the Springfield Isotots, Lisa seizes the chance to extend her résumé and takes the position. Since she knows nothing about baseball, she seeks advice from the patrons of Moe's Tavern, who direct her to Professor Frink and his scientific colleagues. She learns about sabermetrics from them and uses this science to organize the Isotots' strategy; as a result, their record quickly improves and they rise in the league standings. However, Bart eventually rebels against her management, saying that she has taken all the <b>fun</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the game, and hits a home run despite her orders to let the pitcher walk him. The Isotots win the game, but Lisa throws Bart off the team for his insubordination.|$|E
25|$|Ethel {{had never}} had children, a fact that she regretted in her old-age and so Willy became her {{surrogate}} child, and she loves him dearly. Willy goes everywhere that Ethel goes and so she is devastated when he is kidnapped in 1986. She searches for him everywhere and even holds a seance {{to see if she}} can contact him, but Willy is nowhere to be found. Detective Roy Quick (Douglas Fielding) works on the case and eventually finds Willy in the possession of an old Latvian refugee, who has renamed him Rasputin. Willy is returned to an overjoyed Ethel, although she has to pay the man in order to get him to relinquish ownership. Ethel has been a lifelong friend of Lou Beale (Anna Wing) and Dot Cotton (June Brown) and the trio remain close in their old-age. They can often be found reminiscing or gossiping in The Queen Victoria public house, where Ethel also regularly thrills the punters with her repartee, her version of the cancan, or her plain sense of <b>fun.</b> <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> the three Ethel is the most light-hearted and she is never frightened {{to stand up to the}} over-bearing Lou and interfering Dot. She has her run-ins with both over the years, and yet their friendship endures right to the last.|$|E

500|$|... "MoneyBart" [...] (also {{referred}} to as [...] "MoneyBART") is the third episode of The Simpsons twenty-second season. It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on October 10, 2010. In this episode, Lisa coaches Bart's Little League baseball team to a record winning streak by using her book smarts in statistics and probability. However, when Bart questions Lisa’s coaching tactics and accuses her of taking the <b>fun</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> baseball, Lisa benches him from the championship game.|$|E

For this mad melodramatization of a desperate adventure of Bond with sinister characters in Istanbul and on the Orient Express is fictional exaggeration on a grand scale and in a dashing style, thoroughly illogical and improbable, but with tongue blithely wedged in cheek." ...|$|E
500|$|Describing {{himself as}} [...] "sort of a foodie", Selman {{has said that}} food is {{constantly}} on his mind and that he particularly likes reading food critic Jonathan Gold's reviews in LA Weekly. He told LA Weeklys Squid Ink food blog that he likes foodies, despite making fun of them in [...] "The Food Wife". He commented that on the show, he has often [...] "taken something that I love, found the one little weird, bad thing about it and harped on that", giving foodies as an example and writing: [...] "You can make fun of them for being pretentious or snobby or taking the <b>fun</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> eating. That you'd rather photograph something than taste it is a funny nuance of the phenomenon. That it's more about sticking your flag in something than actually enjoying it. We kind of make fun of foodies, but in real life we actually love them." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{critical}} {{reception of}} the character has been generally negative. Robert A. George of the New York Post has written that Glee has: [...] "the most unpleasant pack of female characters of any show in recent memory", and deemed Terri the [...] "biggest culprit". George called Terri's hysterical pregnancy [...] "Freudian" [...] and wrote: [...] "The Terri-Quinn plot sends {{the message that the}} devious gender will use every trick to lure and trap its mate — including lying about pregnancy." [...] Varietys Brian Lowry commented: [...] "Perhaps to foster a rooting interest (or at least sympathy) for a Will-Emma pairing, [...] (Jessalyn Gilsig) is initially presented as a ditsy shrew." [...] The Chicago Tribunes Maureen Ryan has called Terri [...] "the worst thing about Glee", and opined: [...] "As written by Murphy and played by Gilsig, the character is screechy, unfunny and deeply unpleasant. It's as if Ryan didn't trust that the audience would get behind Will and the saga of his ragtag glee club and so saw fit to give the teacher the shrewish, nagging wife from hell." [...] Ryan later deemed Terri the [...] "one big flaw in Glee, commenting that she: [...] "manages to drain all the <b>fun</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Glee every time she appears. Not only is this shrill character intensely annoying, but she makes you wonder whether Will has brain damage. What other explanation could there be for his ending up with this materialistic harpy?". Furthermore, Terri was included in TV Guide list of The Most Loathed TV Characters.|$|E
500|$|Brian Lowry for Variety, however, {{criticized the}} episode. He wrote that Lynch's {{performance}} was [...] "fitfully funny but usually just plain annoying", calling the pregnancy subplot [...] "credulity-straining". Lowry praised Colfer and Michele, however {{stated that the}} show's talent was squandered by its [...] "jokey, cartoonish, wildly uneven tone". He deemed the show a [...] "one-hit wonder", writing that: [...] "the musical numbersgenerally less infectious and buoyant than the first time outcan’t compensate for overly broad characterizations and absurdly soapy situations." [...] Robert Bianco for USA Today gave a mixed review, commenting: [...] "It {{would be better if}} Glee had more control and fewer abrupt tonal shifts, but that's not the Glee we're getting — and maybe it wouldn't be Glee at all. It's not perfect, but in a sea of procedural conformity, Glee is its own weird, often enchanting little island escape." [...] While Hank Stuever for The Washington Post praised the show's inclusion of adult storylines alongside teenage drama, Robert Lloyd for the Los Angeles Times felt that the adult characters [...] "tend more to caricature than character", writing of Sue that: [...] "the writing flattens her toward a single note. She's funny from line to line, but there is little to her besides tin-pot contrariness." [...] The Chicago Tribunes Maureen Ryan commented similarly: [...] "there's one big flaw in Glee [...] and it may be a harbinger of bad things to come. Will's wife, Terri (Jessalyn Gilsig), manages to drain all the <b>fun</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Glee every time she appears." [...] Ryan received the younger cast more positively, stating that there were [...] "no weak links", and praising Colfer and Michele in particular.|$|E

IGN has praised Kerbal Space Program's ability to create <b>fun</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> failure, saying that [...] "By the time I finally built a rocket that achieved successful orbit, I had failed so many times that in almost any other game I would have given up completely." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{developers}} {{originally thought}} the game's target audience would be fairly adult-age. Towers notes: [...] "We {{started out with}} an idea that the users {{are going to be}} fairly old, but then as we sort of made the game we focused it. We realized that lots of different people get <b>fun</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the game in lots of different ways. We tested on young kids, we tested on adults, we tested on a mix of the two, and we {{came to the conclusion that}} anyone can play this game. We very much wanted the game to be accessible from the start so that you can play alongside your granny or with your kids. We saw people enjoying it from all ages." ...|$|E
2500|$|The first post-World War II use of {{the word}} in print, {{marginally}} mentioned in the Sontag essay, may be Christopher Isherwood's 1954 novel The World in the Evening, where he comments: [...] "You can't camp about something you don't take seriously. You're not making fun of it; you're making <b>fun</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> it. You're expressing what's basically serious to you in terms of fun and artifice and elegance." [...] In the American writer Susan Sontag's 1964 essay [...] "Notes on 'Camp'", Sontag emphasized artifice, frivolity, naïve middle-class pretentiousness, and shocking excess as key elements of camp. Examples cited by Sontag included Tiffany lamps, the drawings of Aubrey Beardsley, Tchaikovsky's ballet Swan Lake, and Japanese science fiction films such as Rodan, and The Mysterians of the 1950s.|$|E
2500|$|The 1973 season saw the Tigers drop {{to third}} place in the division, with an 85-77 record. Joe Coleman posted another 23 wins, but the other Tiger {{starters}} had subpar seasons. Willie Horton hit [...]316, but injuries limited him to just 111 games. Jim Northrup posted the best batting average of his career (.307) but was inexplicably limited to part-time duty (119 games played), which Northrup attributed to an ongoing feud with Billy Martin that had actually started in the 1972 ALCS. Northrup even proclaimed to the press that Martin [...] "took the <b>fun</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the game." [...] Martin did not survive the 1973 season as manager. He was fired that September after ordering his pitchers to throw spitballs (and telling the press that he did so) in protest of opposing Cleveland Indians pitcher Gaylord Perry, whom Martin was convinced was doing the same. Base coach Joe Schultz served as interim manager for the final 28 games of the season.|$|E

2500|$|Brown, who was {{originally}} sentenced {{to be executed}} in Ohio for her complicity in the crimes, had her death sentence commuted {{to life in prison}} by Governor Richard Celeste in 1991. In commuting Brown's sentence, Governor Celeste cited her low IQ scores, ranging from 59 to 74, and her [...] "master-slave" [...] relationship with Coleman influencing her actions. Brown was one of eight Ohio death row inmates (including all four of the Ohio's female death row inmates) to have her sentence commuted by Celeste, a staunch opponent of capital punishment, a week before he left office. Despite her non-violent history before the spree, Brown was initially unrepentant for her acts. During the sentencing phase of her first Ohio trial, Brown sent a note to the judge which read in part: [...] "I killed the bitch and I don't give a damn. I had <b>fun</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> it." [...] She still has a death sentence for the murder of Tamika Turks which the two committed in Indiana.

2500|$|Gardner {{also came}} into contact with Cecil Williamson, who was intent on opening his own museum devoted to witchcraft; the result would be the Folk-lore Centre of Superstition and Witchcraft, opened in Castletown on the Isle of Man in 1951. Gardner and his wife moved to the island, where he took up the {{position}} of [...] "resident witch". On 29 July, the Sunday Pictorial published an article about the museum in which Gardner declared [...] "Of course I'm a witch. And I get great <b>fun</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> it." [...] The museum was not a financial success, and the relationship between Gardner and Williamson deteriorated. In 1954, Gardner bought the museum from Williamson, who returned to England to found the rival Museum of Witchcraft, eventually settling it in Boscastle, Cornwall. Gardner renamed his exhibition the Museum of Magic and Witchcraft and continued running it up until his death. He also acquired a flat at 145 Holland Road, near Shepherd's Bush in West London, but nevertheless fled to warmer climates during the winter, where his asthma would not be so badly affected, for instance spending time in France, Italy, and the Gold Coast. From his base in London, he would frequent Atlantis bookshop, thereby encountering a number of other occultists, including Austin Osman Spare and Kenneth Grant, and he also continued his communication with Karl Germer until 1956.|$|E
