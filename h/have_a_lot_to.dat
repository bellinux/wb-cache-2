She also tries to get back on her father's good side, by doing some housekeeping, but Michael brushes it all aside. Of how Natasha feels about this, Novakovic said [...] "She knows how much her father loves her which is why this is even more jarring, as she realises it must be killing her father to act this way."

The television cook Delia Smith admits she was puzzled [...] "how on earth Mrs Beeton's book managed to utterly eclipse... superior work", while her fellow chef, Clarissa Dickson Wright, opines that [...] "It would be unfair to blame any one person or one book for the decline of English cookery, but Isabella Beeton and her ubiquitous book do <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> answer for." [...] In comparison, the food writer Bee Wilson opines that disparaging Isabella's work was only a [...] "fashionable" [...] stance to take and that the cook's writing [...] "simply makes you want to cook". Christopher Driver, the journalist and food critic, suggests that the [...] "relative stagnation and want of refinement in the indigenous cooking of Britain between 1880 and 1930" [...] may instead be explained by the [...] "progressive debasement under successive editors, revises and enlargers". David comments that [...] "when plain English cooks" [...] were active in their kitchens, [...] "they followed plain English recipes and chiefly those from the Mrs Beeton books or their derivatives". Dickson Wright considers Beeton to be a [...] "fascinating source of information" [...] from a social history viewpoint, and Aylett and Ordish consider the work to be [...] "the best and most reliable guide for the scholar to the domestic history of the mid-Victorian era".|$|E

[...] The day after Over the Edge, the WWF published a message in the Calgary Sun, stating, [...] "We do not have much information as to how it happened and will not know until an investigation is completed. We are all shaken, and to say Owen will be missed is to fall short of a way to fully explain what he meant to us." [...] Although the WWF had no information, they reported that [...] "Our thoughts and prayers go out to the entire Hart family. We have to be strong for Owen; he was an extraordinary human being and consummate performer and knows that the highest tribute that we can pay is to go on entertaining the fans he loved so much." ...|$|E
