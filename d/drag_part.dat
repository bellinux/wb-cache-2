5|$|During {{a couple}} of the Svea flights, Andrée tested and tried out the drag-rope {{steering}} technique which he had developed and wanted to use on his projected North Pole expedition. Drag ropes, which hang from the balloon basket and <b>drag</b> <b>part</b> of their length on the ground, are designed to counteract the tendency of lighter-than-air craft to travel at the same speed as the wind, a situation that makes steering by sails impossible. The friction of the ropes was intended to slow the balloon {{to the point where the}} sails would have an effect (beyond that of making the balloon rotate on its axis). Andrée reported, and presumably believed, that with drag rope/sails steering he had succeeded in deviating about ten degrees either way from the wind direction. This notion is rejected by modern balloonists; the Swedish Ballooning Association maintains that Andrée's belief that he had deviated from the wind was mistaken, being misled by inexpertise and a surfeit of enthusiasm in an environment of variable winds and poor visibility. Use of drag ropes (prone to snapping, falling off, or becoming entangled with each other or the ground, in addition to being ineffective) is not considered by any modern expert to be a useful steering technique.|$|E
50|$|The {{first public}} Tranimal Workshop event, held at Mark Allen's Machine Project in 2009, contextualized the {{movement}} and moved it into a participatory, open-source series of events. Each event culminated {{in a series of}} photographs shot by Austin Young. The concept of the Tranimal Workshop was a collaboration between by Austin Young, Squeaky Blonde and Fade-Dra. Participating artists have also included Matthu Andersen, Jer Ber Jones, Andrew Marlin, Jason El Diablo, and many others. The first workshop was co-produced by Austin Young and Saskia Wilson-Brown in conjunction with Ultra Fabulous Beyond <b>Drag,</b> <b>Part</b> Deux in 2007, and Ultra Fabulous Beyond <b>Drag,</b> <b>Part</b> Deux in 2009. These two film programs in Los Angeles were complemented by guest performances from artists such The Steve Lady, Jer Ber Jones, and Squeaky Blonde, among others. The Ultra Fabulous screenings served to coalesce the filmic elements of the movement in one place, for the first time.|$|E
5000|$|While {{working at}} Danceteria, Alig studied the nightclub {{business}} and {{soon became a}} party promoter. His ability to stage memorable parties helped him rise in New York's party scene. During this time, Alig and other regular clubgoers began creating flamboyant personas, and later became known as [...] "Club Kids". The Club Kids wore outrageous costumes that former Club Kid and celebutante James St. James later described as [...] "part <b>drag,</b> <b>part</b> clown, part infantilism". They were also known for their frequent use of ketamine (known as Special K), Ecstasy, Rohypnol, heroin, and cocaine. Alig's Club Kids included (among others): [...] "Ernie Glam", [...] "Gitsie", [...] "Jennytalia", [...] "Superstar DJ Keoki", Amanda Lepore, Charlie [...] "Dash" [...] Prestano, [...] "Richie Rich", Robert [...] "Freeze" [...] Riggs, RuPaul, and [...] "Walt Paper". The Club Kids' outrageousness became a source of interest for the media, and articles about them appeared in such media outlets as Newsweek, People, and TIME. They also appeared on Donahue, Geraldo, and The Joan Rivers Show.|$|E

40|$|The Seebeck {{coefficient}} of a patterned Si wire on P-doped SOI (Si-on-insulator) layer with a carrier concentration of 1018 cm- 3 was measured near room temperature. The Seebeck coefficient {{is found to}} be smaller than that in the SOI layer and to be closer to the calculated Seebeck coefficient including the electronic contribution.

40|$|Abstract: During the Burdigalian and {{the middle}} Miocene the Cadiz-Alicante Fault {{facilitated}} {{the continuity of the}} westward displacement of the Betic Internal Zone, simultaneously <b>dragging</b> <b>part</b> of the Subbetic. Its position locally coincides with the contact between the Internal Zone and the External, but especially in the west part affects only the Subbetic. From the late Miocene the crustal discontinuity formed by this fault aided the subsidence of the depocentres controlled by NNW-SSE faults, acting as a backstop for the extension to the north. This fault constitutes an important discontinuity in the Betic Cordillera and, although there is no proof of earthquakes deeper than 7 km linked to the fault, a volcanoclastic emission occurred during the Burdigalian, apparently related to the fault. This implies that the fault cut deeply, a proposition easily assumed if it is considered that the subsidence of some of the depocentres limited by the fault is on the order of 3 km and even more, requiring a compensation depth greater than 10 km. Key words: Cadiz-Alicante Fault, Betic Cordillera, strike-slip fault, depocentre. Resumen: La falla de Cádiz-Alicante facilitó durante el Burdigaliense y el Mioceno medio la continuación de los desplazamientos hacia el oeste de la Zona Interna Bética, arrastrando al mismo tiempo parte del Subbético. Su posición coincide localmente con el contacto entre las zonas Interna...|$|R

40|$|For {{the first}} time, we explore the {{dynamics}} of the central region of a galaxy cluster within r_ 500 ∼ 600 h^- 1 kpc from its center by combining optical and X-ray spectroscopy. We use (1) the caustic technique that identifies the cluster substructures and their galaxy members with optical spectroscopic data, and (2) the X-ray redshift fitting procedure that estimates the redshift distribution of the intracluster medium (ICM). We use the spatial and redshift distributions of the galaxies and of the X-ray emitting gas to associate the optical substructures to the X-ray regions. When we apply this approach to Abell 85 (A 85), a complex dynamical structure of A 85 emerges from our analysis: a galaxy group, with redshift z= 0. 0509 ± 0. 0021 is passing through the cluster center along the line of sight <b>dragging</b> <b>part</b> of the ICM present in the cluster core; two additional groups, at redshift z= 0. 0547 ± 0. 0022 and z= 0. 0570 ± 0. 0020, are going through the cluster in opposite directions, almost perpendicularly to the line of sight, and have substantially perturbed {{the dynamics of}} the ICM. An additional group in the outskirts of A 85, at redshift z= 0. 0561 ± 0. 0023, is associated to a secondary peak of the X-ray emission, at redshift z= 0. 0583 ^+ 0. 0039 _- 0. 0047. Although our analysis and results on A 85 need to be confirmed by high-resolution spectroscopy, they demonstrate how our new approach can be a powerful tool to constrain the formation history of galaxy clusters by unveiling their central and surrounding structures.
