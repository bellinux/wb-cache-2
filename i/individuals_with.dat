5|$|Deficits in {{cognitive}} abilities are {{widely recognized as}} a core feature of schizophrenia. The extent of the cognitive deficits an individual experiences is a predictor of how functional an individual will be, the quality of occupational performance, and how successful the individual will be in maintaining treatment. The presence and degree of cognitive dysfunction in <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> schizophrenia {{has been reported to}} be a better indicator of functionality than the presentation of positive or negative symptoms. The deficits impacting the cognitive function are found in a large number of areas: working memory, long-term memory, verbal declarative memory, semantic processing, episodic memory, attention, learning (particularly verbal learning). Deficits in verbal memory are the most pronounced in <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> schizophrenia, and are not accounted for by deficit in attention. Verbal memory impairment has been linked to a decreased ability in <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> schizophrenia to semantically encode (process information relating to meaning), which is cited as a cause for another known deficit in long-term memory. When given a list of words, healthy individuals remember positive words more frequently (known as the Pollyanna principle); however, <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> schizophrenia tend to remember all words equally regardless of their connotations, suggesting that the experience of anhedonia impairs the semantic encoding of the words. These deficits have been found in individuals before the onset of the illness to some extent. First-degree family members of <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> schizophrenia and other high-risk individuals also show a degree of deficit {{in cognitive}} abilities, and specifically in working memory.A review of the literature on cognitive deficits in <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> schizophrenia shows that the deficits may be present in early adolescence, or as early as childhood. The deficits which an individual with schizophrenia presents tend to remain the same over time in most patients, or follow an identifiable course based upon environmental variables.|$|E

5|$|<b>Individuals</b> <b>with</b> AS {{often have}} {{excellent}} auditory and visual perception. Children with ASD often demonstrate enhanced perception of {{small changes in}} patterns such as arrangements of objects or well-known images; typically this is domain-specific and involves processing of fine-grained features. Conversely, compared with <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> high-functioning autism, <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> AS have deficits in some tasks involving visual-spatial perception, auditory perception, or visual memory. Many accounts of <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> AS and ASD report other unusual sensory and perceptual skills and experiences. They may be unusually sensitive or insensitive to sound, light, and other stimuli; these sensory responses are found in other developmental disorders and are not specific to AS or to ASD. There is little support for increased fight-or-flight response or failure of habituation in autism; there is more evidence of decreased responsiveness to sensory stimuli, although several studies show no differences.|$|E

5|$|Alternatively, {{selection}} can {{be divided}} according to its effect on genetic diversity. Purifying or negative selection acts to remove genetic variation from the population (and is opposed by de novo mutation, which introduces new variation. In contrast, balancing selection acts to maintain genetic variation in a population, {{even in the absence}} of de novo mutation, by negative frequency-dependent selection. One mechanism for this is heterozygote advantage, where <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> two different alleles have a selective advantage over <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> just one allele. The polymorphism at the human ABO blood group locus has been explained in this way.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{evidence}} that cognitive deficits remain stable over time is reliable and abundant, {{much of the research}} in this domain focuses on methods to improve attention and working memory. Efforts to improve learning ability in <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> schizophrenia using a high- versus low-reward condition and an instruction-absent or instruction-present condition revealed that increasing reward leads to poorer performance while providing instruction leads to improved performance, highlighting that some treatments may exist to increase cognitive performance. Training <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> schizophrenia to alter their thinking, attention, and language behaviors by verbalizing tasks, engaging in cognitive rehearsal, giving self-instructions, giving coping statements to the self to handle failure, and providing self-reinforcement for success, significantly improves performance on recall tasks. This type of training, known as self-instructional (SI) training, produced benefits such as lower number of nonsense verbalizations and improved recall while distracted.|$|E

5|$|An {{estimated}} 0.5% to 10% of <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> ASD show unusual abilities, {{ranging from}} splinter {{skills such as}} the memorization of trivia to the extraordinarily rare talents of prodigious autistic savants. Many <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> ASD show superior skills in perception and attention, relative to the general population. Sensory abnormalities are found in over 90% of those with autism, and are considered core features by some, {{although there is no}} good evidence that sensory symptoms differentiate autism from other developmental disorders. Differences are greater for under-responsivity (for example, walking into things) than for over-responsivity (for example, distress from loud noises) or for sensation seeking (for example, rhythmic movements). An estimated 60%–80% of autistic people have motor signs that include poor muscle tone, poor motor planning, and toe walking; deficits in motor coordination are pervasive across ASD and are greater in autism proper.|$|E

5|$|Based on {{findings}} correlating mirror neuron {{activity and}} mu wave suppression in <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> autism as in typically developing individuals, {{studies have examined}} both the development of mirror neurons and therapeutic means for stimulating the system. A recent study has found that fMRI activation magnitudes in the inferior frontal gyrus increase with age in people with autism. This finding was not apparent in typically developing individuals. Furthermore, greater activation was associated with greater amounts of eye contact and better social functioning. Scientists believe the inferior frontal gyrus {{is one of the}} main neural correlates with the mirror neuron system in humans and is often related to deficits associated with autism. These findings suggest that the mirror neuron system may not be non-functional in <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> autism, but simply abnormal in its development. This information is significant to the present discussion because mu waves may be integrating different areas of mirror neuron activity in the brain. Other studies have assessed attempts to consciously stimulate the mirror neuron system and suppress mu waves using neurofeedback (a type of biofeedback given through computers that analyze real time recordings of brain activity, in this case EEGs of mu waves). This type of therapy is still in its early phases of implementation for <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> autism, and has conflicting forecasts for success.|$|E
