500|$|Bundy {{underwent}} multiple psychiatric examinations; the experts' conclusions varied. Dorothy Otnow Lewis, Professor of Psychiatry at the New York University School of Medicine and {{an authority}} on violent behavior, initially made a diagnosis of bipolar disorder, but later changed her impression more than once. She also suggested {{the possibility of a}} multiple personality disorder, based on behaviors described in interviews and court testimony: a great-aunt witnessed an episode during which Bundy [...] "seemed to turn into another, unrecognizable person... suddenly, inexplicably found herself afraid of her favorite nephew as they waited together at a dusk-darkened train station. He had turned into a stranger." [...] Lewis recounted a prison official in Tallahassee describing a similar transformation: [...] "He said, 'He became weird on me.' He did a metamorphosis, a body and facial change, and he felt there was almost an odor emitting from him. He said, 'Almost a complete change of personality... that was the day <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> him.|$|E
500|$|The {{earliest}} {{description of}} carbon monoxide poisoning dates to at least 200 BC by Aristotle. Documented cases {{of carbon monoxide}} {{being used as a}} method of suicide date to at least 100 BC in ancient Rome. In the AD 350s, the Roman emperor Julian suffered from carbon monoxide poisoning in Paris, and later described it in his work Misopogon: [...] "though the winter weather prevailed and continually increased in severity, even so I did not allow my servants to heat the house, because <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> drawing out the dampness in the walls; but I ordered them to carry in fire that had burned down and to place in the room a very moderate number of hot coals. But the coals, though there were not very many of them, brought out from the walls quantities of steam and this made me fall asleep. And since my head was filled with the fumes I was almost choked. Then I was carried outside." [...] This misunderstanding of the causes of carbon monoxide poisoning may have caused the death of Julian's successor, Jovian.|$|E
2500|$|When {{as a boy}} I {{was visiting}} the old Proud-Katrina, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> {{lightning}} like all boys in those days. When the sheet lightning flared at the night, Katrina said: [...] "Don't be afraid little child, it is only Freyja who is out making fire with steel and flintstone {{to see if the}} rye is ripe. She is kind to people and she is only doing it to be of service, she is not like Thor, he slays both people and livestock, when he is in the mood" [...] I later heard several old folks talk of the same thing in the same way.|$|E

"But, Mr. Andrew," [...] she said, [...] "I do {{not want}} to go back to the Hall. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> them all, and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> my {{stepmother}} more than any of them. Why may I not stay here? <b>I</b> will <b>be</b> very good, and I will give you no trouble at all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Of {{course you}} may,' she answered. 'But <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> your beasts. Let me hit {{them with my}} rod, and then <b>I</b> shall not <b>be</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> them.' ...|$|R
2500|$|Medcalf has {{revealed}} to the Walford Gazette how she prepared for the role: [...] "I actually watched the show a bit when Danniella had been on so I had a distinct memory of her to work with. What I basically did was to read a prepared, detailed biography of the character which {{was provided by the}} production office. I did sit down to watch a five-minute clip of Danniella but I quickly realised I didn't want to carry on watching because <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> falling into doing an imitation of her, d'ye know what I mean? I'll tell you something weird-when I first started getting the scripts I used to hear the lines first in my head with HER voice saying them! But that changed over time, thank God, as I hopefully made the character my own and I gave her my voice." [...] Medcalf added that contrastingly to Westbrook, who played Sam as a young girl who was overprotected by her brothers and sheltered, she played Sam as a young woman [...] "trying to find her place both in a career and in relationships with the opposite sex." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Beatrice," [...] he confessed, [...] "I was a thick-headed ignorant fool, without understanding. I {{came to you}} for safety. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> Elizabeth, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> what I {{felt for}} her. I wanted to escape from it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{never meant}} to overhear your conversation. But at that, it was so strange, I drew back and cowered even closer. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> papa's voice. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> his rage. He spoke just {{like a man who}} was ready to murder you.|$|E
6000|$|And she answered: 'Certainly you may. But <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> your beasts. May I {{give them}} a stroke with my rod, then <b>I</b> shall not <b>be</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> them.' ...|$|R

6000|$|I {{dare not}} attempt it.
