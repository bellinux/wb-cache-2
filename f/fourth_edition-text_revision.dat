40|$|Bipolar {{disorder}} {{is a serious}} recurrent and sometimes long-term psy-chiatric disease, characterized by mood dysregulation and correspond-ing impulsivity, risk-taking behavior (eg, alcohol abuse, sexual indiscretion, excessive spending), and interpersonal difficulties. 1 Individuals with bipolar disorder {{are at increased risk}} for death from sui-cide, physical illness (eg, cardiovascular disease), homicide, and acci-dents. 1 Recent data suggest that, of prevalent neuropsychiatric disorders, bipolar disorder ranks second only to depression in the loss of healthy life-years because of premature death or disability. 2 Research on bipolar disorder has mainly focused on bipolar I disor-der.

40|$|In this article, {{the authors}} report the psychometric {{properties}} of a parent-completed rating scale based on the criteria for oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders- <b>Fourth</b> <b>Edition-Text</b> <b>Revision</b> (DSM-IV-TR). Mothers of 294 boys and 48 girls with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and 53 boys and 45 girls without behavior problems completed the Oppositional Defiant Disorder Rating Scale (ODDRS). Fathers of 44 boys with ADHD also completed the scale, and 71 mothers of boys with ADHD provided 1 -year test-retest data. The ODDRS had high internal consistency, high interrater reliability, and moderate 1 -year test-retest reliability. The scale had one principal component and correlated as expected with related subscales from the Child Behavior Checklist and with overreactive parenting. Scores were not significantly correlated with parent or child age or with socioeconomic status. The strong psychometric properties indicate that this measure holds considerable promise for briefly assessing ODD {{in a manner consistent with}} the DSM-IV-TR.

40|$|Objective: It is {{not clear}} whether sibling’s gender ratio is {{associated}} with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). This study examines whether inattentiveness severity and hyperactivity/impulsivity severity are associated with birth order of children with ADHD. Method: Participants are a clinical sample of 173 children and adolescents with ADHD and 43 ones without ADHD. Diagnoses were made using Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders forth <b>edition-Text</b> <b>Revision</b> (DSM-IV-TR), diagnostic criteria according to face-to-face interview with the children and their parents. ADHD DSM-IV checklist was used to measure inattentiveness and hyperactivity/impulsivity scores. Results: The association of birth order and diagnosis of ADHD was not statistically significant after adjusting for covariate factors. The gender ratio of siblings is not associated with ADHD. Conclusion: Birth order and siblings gender ratio are independent of ADHD diagnosis. The results of this study support the fact that genetic factors rather than environmental factor of birth order is associated with ADHD. Moreover, contrary to autism, the current results do not suggest the androgen theory for ADHD...|$|R

Methods. The sample is constituted by outpatients meeting diagnostic criteria for mild-severe (HAMD 17 ≥ 24 and CGI-S ≥ 4) Major Depressive Episode as defined by DSM-IV-TR (Diagnostic and Statistic Manual for Mental Disorder, <b>Fourth</b> <b>Edition-Text</b> <b>Revision),</b> based on the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-TR (Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview, MINI).

40|$|Systematic study {{comparing}} repetitive {{behaviors in}} autism with those observed in {{obsessive compulsive disorder}} (OCD) and other Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders- <b>Fourth</b> <b>Edition-Text</b> <b>Revision</b> (DSM-IV-TR) diagnoses is lacking despite its diagnostic and treatment significance. This research examines repetitive behaviors {{in a sample of}} children and adults diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD), (OCD), or both. Data were collected from three participant pools; clinic clients, parents/caregivers, and therapists; in order to test the psychometric properties of questions for assessing the functional characteristics of repetitive thoughts and behavior (i. e., stereotypy, compulsion, obsession, perseveration, preoccupation). Exploratory factor analyses revealed four factors that demonstrated reasonable consistency across the three types of informants. These four assessed factors included: 1) intrusive effects; 2) soothing effects; 3) level of distress, and; 4) pleasure-seeking qualities. Reliability for the new scales was calculated separately for subjects, correspondents, and therapists revealing high internal consistency. Validity analyses were completed, first by examining bivariate correlations among the new scales and then by examining correlations between the new scales and then by examining correlations between the new scales and established measures of functioning (i. e., Gilliam Autism Rating Scale-Second Edition; GARS- 2, Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale; Y-BOCS, and Adaptive Behavior Assessment System-Second Edition; ABAS-II). As hypothesized, the new scales measuring soothing and pleasure-seeking qualities of repetitive behavior had higher correlations with measures of ASD than OCD and the new scales measuring level of distress and intrusiveness in repetitive behavior had higher correlations with measures of OCD than ASD. The results of this study take a step toward better distinguishing what motivates repetitive behaviors and, thus, how to best think about them in the context of intervention strategies...|$|E
30|$|In the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, <b>fourth</b> <b>edition-text</b> <b>revision</b> (DSM-IV-TR), the {{diagnostic}} {{criteria for a}} 'mixed episode’ include a requirement that the patient meets the criteria for both a manic episode and a major depressive episode (except for duration) nearly every day during at least a 1 -week period (American Psychiatric Association 2000). When reviewing the latest research evidence for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition (DSM- 5), published in May 2013, it was recognised that individuals rarely meet the full criteria for both a manic episode and major depressive episode at the same time, meaning that patients with mixed manic and depressive symptoms {{may not necessarily be}} accurately diagnosed and receive the most appropriate treatment (American Psychiatric Association 2013 a). Therefore, the DSM-IV-TR criteria for a mixed episode have been removed and replaced in DSM- 5 with a new 'With Mixed Features’ specifier for mood episodes, which can be applied to episodes of hypomania, mania or major depression (American Psychiatric Association 2013 a). For hypomanic or manic episodes, the specifier is given if at least three of six defined depressive symptoms are present nearly every day during the most recent week of a manic episode or the most recent 4 days of a hypomanic episode. These depressive symptoms are 'prominent dysphoria or depressed mood’[*], 'diminished interest or pleasure in activities’[*], 'psychomotor retardation’[*], 'fatigue or loss of energy’[*], 'feelings of worthlessness or excessive/inappropriate guilt'’ and 'recurrent thoughts of death/suicide’ (American Psychiatric Association 2013 a). Since manic episodes with depressive symptoms are generally more severe and have a poorer prognosis than pure manic episodes (González-Pinto et al. 2007, 2011; Goldberg and McElroy 2007; Valentí et al. 2011), and because these mixed states are common (affecting approximately one third of patients with bipolar disorder (González-Pinto et al. 2007, 2011)), it is hoped that this new specifier will enable clinicians to diagnose patients suffering from concurrent symptoms of mania/hypomania and depression more accurately. This will allow clinicians to better tailor treatment to their patients' particular needs (American Psychiatric Association 2013 a). Furthermore, since mixed states are not easily identified by clinicians, it is crucial to systematically search for coexisting depression when a patient has a manic episode in order to ensure a correct diagnosis.|$|E
40|$|Specific phobias (SPs) are common, with {{lifetime}} prevalence {{estimates of}} 10 %. Our current {{understanding of their}} pathophysiology owes much to neuroimaging studies, which enabled us to construct increasingly efficient models of the underlying neurocircuitry. We provide an updated, comprehensive review and analyze the relevant literature of functional neuroimaging studies in specific phobias. Findings are presented according to the functional neuroanatomy of patients with SPs. We performed a careful search of the major medical and psychological databases by crossing SP with each neuroimaging technique. Functional neuroimaging, mostly using symptom provocation paradigms, showed abnormal activations in brain areas involved in emotional perception and early amplification, mainly the amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex, thalamus, and insula. The insula, thalamus and other limbic/paralimbic structures are particularly involved in SPs with prominent autonomic arousal. Emotional modulation is also impaired after exposure to phobic stimuli, with abnormal activations reported for the prefrontal, orbitofrontal and visual cortices. Other cortices and the cerebellum also appear {{to be involved in}} the pathophysiology of this disorder. Functional neuroimaging identified neural substrates that differentiate SPs from other anxiety disorders and separate SP subtypes from one another: the results support current Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4 th <b>edition-Text</b> <b>Revision</b> (DSM-IV-TR) diagnostic subtyping of SPs. Functional neuroimaging shows promise as a means of identifying treatment-response predictors. Improvement in these techniques may help in clarifying the neurocircuitry underlying SP, for both research and clinical-therapeutic purposes. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

The aim {{of this study was to}} compare methylphenidate with the combination of methylphenidate and risperidone in preschool children with ADHD. Forty-two preschool children, aged 3 - 6 years, diagnosed with ADHD by a child and adolescent psychiatrist according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth <b>Edition-Text</b> <b>Revision</b> criteria, were enrolled in a 6 -week, single-blind clinical trial and administered with methylphenidate (5 - 30 mg/dl) or the combination of methylphenidate and risperidone (0. 25 - 2 mg/dl) in Iran. Treatment outcomes were assessed using the Conners' Rating Scale and Clinical Global Impression (CGI) Scale at baseline and 3 and 6 weeks after starting the drugs administration. Side effects were rated by a checklist and body weight was measured at each visit. There were no significant differences between the two protocols in Parent Conners' Rating Scale scores (P > 0. 05) and CGI scores (P > 0. 05). Both groups showed a significant improvement in ADHD symptoms over the 6 weeks of treatment for Parent Conners' Rating Scale (P < 0. 001). The combination group used significantly lower doses of methylphenidate compared to the other group (P = 0. 002). The most common adverse effects were anorexia (21. 7 %) and daytime drowsiness (17. 4 %) in combination treatment group and insomnia (33. 3 %) and anorexia (25 %) in methylphenidate group. Risperidone and methylphenidate may be effective and well tolerated in preschool children with ADHD, and adding risperidone to methylphenidate may decrease the occurrence of some side effects of methylphenidate such as insomnia and anorexia and lower the dose of methylphenidate may be needed to control symptoms. © 2016 Journal of Advanced Pharmaceutical Technology & Research...|$|R
40|$|The medical {{literature}} contains several definitions of premature ejaculation (PE). The most commonly quoted definition, the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-Fourth <b>Edition-Text</b> <b>Revision,</b> and other definitions of PE are all authority based rather than evidence based, {{and have no}} support from controlled clinical and/or epidemiological studies. The aim {{of this article is}} to develop a contemporary, evidence-based definition of PE. In August 2007, the International Society for Sexual Medicine (ISSM) appointed several international experts in PE to an Ad Hoc Committee for the Definition of Premature Ejaculation. The committee met in Amsterdam in October 2007 to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of current definitions of PE, to critique the evidence in support of the constructs of ejaculatory latency, ejaculatory control, sexual satisfaction, and personal/interpersonal distress, and to propose a new evidence-based definition of PE. The committee unanimously agreed that the constructs that are necessary to define PE are rapidity of ejaculation, perceived self-efficacy and control, and negative personal consequences from PE. The committee proposed that lifelong PE be defined as "... a male sexual dysfunction characterized by ejaculation which always or nearly always occurs prior to or within about one minute of vaginal penetration, and the inability to delay ejaculation on all or nearly all vaginal penetrations, and negative personal consequences, such as distress, bother, frustration and/or the avoidance of sexual intimacy. " This definition is limited to men with lifelong PE who engage in vaginal intercourse. The panel concluded that there are insufficient published objective data to propose an evidence-based definition of acquired PE. The ISSM definition of lifelong PE represents the first evidence-based definition of PE. This definition will hopefully lead to the development of new tools and Patient Reported Outcome measures for diagnosing and assessing the efficacy of treatment interventions and encourage ongoing research into the true prevalence of this disorder and the efficacy of new pharmacological and psychological treatment...|$|R

Methods: Asian patients (aged ≥ 20 years) diagnosed with schizophrenia (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, <b>Fourth</b> <b>Edition-Text</b> <b>Revision</b> criteria), and having a Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score of 60 to 120 were enrolled and randomized (1 : 1) to a PP or placebo group. Patients received PP intramuscularly at recommended doses: initiation dose 150 mg equivalent (eq) PP on day 1 and 100 mg eq PP on day 8 (deltoid); and a monthly maintenance dose of 75 mg eq PP on days 36 and 64 (deltoid or gluteal). The change from baseline to week 13 in PANSS total scores (primary endpoint), Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) scores, and PANSS Marder factor scores and subscales, and responder rate at week 13 were evaluated. Safety was also assessed. Results: The PANSS total score (P< 0. 0001, least-squares mean change from baseline to week 13 : PP, - 3. 5; placebo, + 6. 2), CGI-S score (P< 0. 0001), and PANSS Marder factor scores (P≤ 0. 0025) were significantly improved at week 13 in the PP group versus placebo. More treatment responders (≥ 30 % decrease in PANSS total score) were in the PP group (22. 8 %) versus placebo (8. 5 %). Insomnia (PP 17. 0 % versus placebo 15. 2 %), injection site pain (13. 2 % versus 6. 7 %), nasopharyngitis (12. 6 % versus 6. 1 %), psychiatric symptoms (11. 3 % versus 26. 2 %), and extrapyramidal symptoms (10. 1 % versus 4. 9 %) were the most frequently occurring treatment-emergent adverse events.

40|$|Background: Despite {{the fact}} that new {{criteria}} of antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) in {{diagnostic and statistical manual}} of mental disorders-fifth edition (DSM- 5) were resulted from five-factor model (FFM), there is a small amount of studies that investigate the relations between proposed personality traits and FFM. Also, cross-cultural study in this field continuously would be needed. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the relation between the FFM and DSM- 5 ASPD pathological traits. Materials and Methods: This study was a cross-sectional study design. The participants consisted of 122 individuals with ASPD that selected from prisoners (73. 0 %), outpatients (18. 0 %), and inpatients (9. 0 %). They were recruited from Tehran Prisoners, and Clinical Psychology and Psychiatry Clinics of Razi and Taleghani Hospitals, Tehran, Iran, since 2013 - 2014. The Sample was selected based on judgmental sampling. The structured clinical interview for DSM-IV axis II disorders-Personality Questionnaire, NEO-Personality Inventory-Revised, and DSM- 5 personality trait rating form were used to diagnosis and assessment of personality disorder. Pearson correlation has been used for data analysis. All statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS 16 software. Results: The results indicate that neuroticism (N) has positive significant relationship with hostility (r = 0. 33, P < 0. 01), manipulativeness (r = 0. 25, P < 0. 01), deceitfulness (r =. 23, P < 0. 01), impulsivity (r = 0. 20, P < 0. 05), and negative relation with risk taking (r = − 0. 23, P < 0. 01). Also, there was significant relationship between extraversion (E) with manipulativeness (r = 0. 28, P < 0. 01) and deceitfulness (r = 0. 32, P < 0. 01). Agreeableness and conscientiousness have negative significant relation with DSM- 5 traits. In addition, results showed that there is positive significant relationship between FFM and DSM- 5 personality traits with DSM-fourth <b>edition-text</b> <b>revision</b> (DSM-IV-TR) ASPD symptoms (P < 0. 01).
