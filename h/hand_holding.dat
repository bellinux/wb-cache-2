5|$|The {{mouse cursor}} helps to provide visual cues for player actions and movement. The cursor {{appears as a}} hand that changes {{depending}} on what the player is hovering the cursor over. For example, to move in a direction, the cursor changes to point in the intended direction. If players can view an item in greater detail, the cursor changes to a <b>hand</b> <b>holding</b> a magnifying glass. By clicking and dragging the cursor, the player performs actions such as pushing, pulling, and tapping items.|$|E

5|$|Leg before wicket (lbw) {{is one of}} {{the ways}} in which a batsman can be {{dismissed}} in the sport of cricket. Following an appeal by the fielding side, the umpire may rule a batsman out lbw if the ball would have struck the wicket, but was instead intercepted by any part of the batsman's body (except the <b>hand</b> <b>holding</b> the bat). The umpire's decision will depend on a number of criteria, including where the ball pitched, whether the ball hit in line with the wickets, and whether the batsman was attempting to hit the ball.|$|E
5|$|On March 13, 2015 DC Comics {{released}} 25 Joker-themed variant {{covers for}} its various monthly series for release that June, {{in celebration of}} the character's 75th anniversary. Among them was a cover to Batgirl #41 by artist Rafael Albuquerque that took its inspiration from The Killing Joke. The cover depicts the Joker {{standing next to a}} tearful Batgirl, who has a red smile painted across her mouth. The Joker has one <b>hand</b> <b>holding</b> a revolver draped over Batgirl's shoulder and is pointing to her cheek with the other hand, as if gesturing to shoot her.|$|E

25|$|If {{the umpires}} {{have agreed to}} {{dispense}} with bails, because, for example, it is too windy for the bails {{to remain on the}} stumps, the decision as to whether the wicket has been put down is one for the umpire concerned to decide. After a decision to play without bails, the wicket has been put down if the umpire concerned is satisfied that the wicket has been struck by the ball, by the striker's bat, person, or items of his clothing or equipment separated from his person as described above, or by a fielder with the <b>hand</b> <b>holding</b> the ball or with the arm of the <b>hand</b> <b>holding</b> the ball.|$|E

25|$|Kolob was {{the name}} of a {{short-lived}} record label/production company founded by the Osmond Brothers in the 1970s. Released in association with MGM Records (which was absorbed by Polydor in 1976), the logo consisted of a <b>hand</b> <b>holding</b> a ball of clay resembling the planet. The Osmonds also recorded an album called The Plan, which deals with themes in Mormonism related to Kolob.|$|E
25|$|The {{structure}} of ENaC {{has not been}} yet determined. Yet, the {{structure of}} a homologous protein ASIC1 has been resolved. The chicken ASIC1 structure revealed that ASIC1 is assembled as a homotrimer of three identical subunits. The authors of the original study suggested that each ASIC1 subunit resembles a <b>hand</b> <b>holding</b> a ball. Hence distinct domains of ASIC1 have been referred to as palm, knuckle, finger, thumb, and β-ball.|$|E

25|$|Cassiopeia {{has been}} {{variously}} portrayed throughout her {{history as a}} constellation. In Persia, she was drawn by al-Sufi as a queen holding a staff with a crescent moon in her right hand, wearing a crown, {{as well as a}} two-humped camel. In France, she was portrayed as having a marble throne and a palm leaf in her left <b>hand,</b> <b>holding</b> her robe in her right hand. This depiction is from Augustin Royer's 1679 atlas.|$|E
25|$|Coracles can be {{effective}} fishing vessels. When operated skilfully, they hardly disturb the water or the fish. Welsh coracle fishing is performed by two men, each seated in his coracle and with one <b>hand</b> <b>holding</b> the net while with the other he plies his paddle. When a fish is caught, each hauls up {{his end of the}} net until the two coracles touch and the fish are secured. Many coracles are so light and portable that they can easily be carried on the fisherman's shoulders.|$|E
25|$|A studded, gloved <b>hand</b> <b>holding</b> a whip {{surrounded}} by a circle and a small 6 in the lower right corner. This symbol {{has been used by}} Death in June since at least the She Said Destroy 7″/12″, stated by Pearce to signify control and relates to having the whip hand, a British expression. The hand is gloved, giving it both a medieval and fetishistic element, and is often used either in place of the Totenkopf or with it. This symbol was used later than the Totenkopf and is usually secondary to it. As with the Totenkopf-6, the 6 presumably refers to June.|$|E

25|$|Four runs are scored as overthrows if a fielder gathers {{the ball}} and then throws it so that no other fielder can gather it before it reaches the boundary. In this case, the batsman who hit the ball scores however many runs the batsmen had run up to that time, plus four {{additional}} runs, and it is counted as a boundary. If the ball has not come off the bat or <b>hand</b> <b>holding</b> the bat, then the runs are classified as 'extras' and {{are added to the}} team's score but not to the score of any individual batsman.|$|E
25|$|Capillary tubes {{may also}} be used. A small sample of {{bacteria}} is collected {{on the end of}} the capillary tube, without blocking the tube, to avoid false negative results. The opposite end is then dipped into hydrogen peroxide, which is drawn into the tube through capillary action, and turned upside down, so that the bacterial points downwards. The <b>hand</b> <b>holding</b> the tube is then tapped on the bench, moving the hydrogen peroxide down until it touches the bacteria. If bubbles form on contact, this indicates a positive catalase result. This test can detect catalase-positive bacteria at concentrations above about 105 cells/mL, and is simple to use.|$|E
25|$|King Taksin statue was {{unveiled}} {{in the middle}} of Wongwian Yai (the Big Traffic Circle) in Thonburi, at the intersection of Prajadhipok/Inthara Phithak/Lat Ya/Somdet Phra Chao Taksin Roads.
