5|$|The {{suspension}} {{came when}} Richard {{was leading the}} NHL in scoring and the Canadiens were battling Detroit for first place. Richard's suspension also cost him the 1954–55 scoring title, the closest he <b>ever</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> winning it. When Richard's teammate Bernie Geoffrion surpassed Richard in scoring by one point {{on the last day}} of the regular season, the Canadiens' fans booed him.|$|E
5|$|Charles' {{choices were}} appropriate. Philip was {{culturally}} Spanish: {{he was born}} in Valladolid and raised in the Spanish court, his native tongue was Spanish, and he preferred to live in Spain. Ferdinand was familiar with, and to, the other princes of the Holy Roman Empire. Although he too had been born in Spain, he had administered his brother's affairs in the Empire since 1531. Some historians maintain Ferdinand had also been touched by the reformed philosophies, and was probably the closest the Holy Roman Empire <b>ever</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> a Protestant emperor; he remained at least nominally a Catholic throughout his life, although reportedly he refused last rites on his deathbed. Other historians maintain that while Ferdinand was a practicing Catholic, unlike his brother he considered religion to be outside the political sphere.|$|E
5|$|Officials {{of other}} leagues {{took note of}} the {{financial}} boon that followed SEC expansion to twelve teams. Atlantic Coast Conference representatives began discussing expansion to twelve schools {{in the first years}} of the new century, who began publicly pursuing the possibility of expansion anew in 2003. On May 13, 2003, representatives voted in favor of extending invitations to three schools. The only certain school was the University of Miami, while the other two spots were still being debated. Initially, the league favored admitting Miami, Syracuse University, and Boston College. After a month of debate, however, the ACC elected to extend formal invitations to Miami, Boston College, and Virginia Tech, which joined after initially being overlooked. This came years after these schools were considered for ACC membership in the early 1990s but nothing had <b>ever</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> fruition. Pittsburgh and Syracuse would also eventually join the ACC after rejections in 1990 and 2003, becoming members in 2013.|$|E

5|$|The Helles landing {{was made}} by the 29th Division (Major General Aylmer Hunter-Weston). The {{division}} landed on five beaches in an arc about the tip of the peninsula, named 'S', 'V', 'W', 'X' and 'Y' Beaches from east to west. On 1 May, the 29th Indian Brigade (including the 1/6th Gurkha Rifles) landed, took and secured Sari Bair above the landing beaches and was joined by the 1st/5th and the 2nd/10th Gurkha battalions; the Zion Mule Corps landed at Helles on 27 April. At 'Y' Beach, during the first engagement, the First Battle of Krithia, the Allies landed unopposed and advanced inland. There were {{only a small number of}} defenders in the village but lacking orders to exploit the position, the 'Y' Beach commander withdrew his force to the beach. It was as close as the Allies <b>ever</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> capturing the village as the Ottomans brought up a battalion of the 25th Regiment, checking any further movement.|$|E

25|$|The Crisis {{was later}} {{seen as the}} closest the U.S. and the USSR <b>ever</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> nuclear war and had been {{narrowly}} averted by last-minute compromise by both superpowers.

It had been made clear that missiles, bombers, submarines, and computerized firing systems made escalating any situation to Armageddon far more easy than anybody desired.|$|E

25|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th century, certain {{interested}} parties began discussing the possibility of opening the Russian Empire's first metropolitan railway system. The press of the time praised the initial plans, whilst engineers privately worried about the serious lack of experience in the sort of projects required to build a metro; at the time, Saint Petersburg did not even have electrified tramways. However, due to the wish of the municipal authorities of the time to take ownership of the metro after its eventual entry into service, none of the aforementioned projects <b>ever</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> fruition.|$|E
25|$|The Niagara Scenic Parkway was to {{have been}} part of a vast network of limited-access {{highways}} in the Buffalo area. Under the 1971 Regional Highway Plan for the Buffalo–Niagara Falls area, the parkway would have been paralleled by a westward extension of the LaSalle Expressway, which would have extended from the Rainbow Bridge to I-190 along the proposed routing shown on maps 20 years before. Farther north, the northern end of the Niagara Scenic Parkway in Porter would have linked to a western extension of the Lake Ontario State Parkway. Neither proposal <b>ever</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> fruition.|$|E
25|$|Her {{greatest}} {{period of}} reform activity was after her retirement {{from the medical}} profession, from 1880–1895. Blackwell was interested in {{a great number of}} reform movements– mainly moral reform, sexual purity, hygiene and medical education, but also preventative medicine, sanitation, eugenics, family planning, women's rights, associationism, Christian socialism, medical ethics and antivivisection– none of which <b>ever</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> real fruition. She switched back and forth between many different reform organisations, trying to maintain a position of power in each. Blackwell had a lofty, elusive and ultimately unattainable goal: evangelical moral perfection. All of her reform work was along this thread. She even contributed heavily to the founding of two utopian communities: Starnthwaite and Hadleigh in the 1880s.|$|E

25|$|Lyubov Golanchikova (also , Ljuba Galantchikoff) (1889–1959) was {{the third}} woman of the Russian Empire to receive a pilot's license. She was {{probably}} born {{in what is now}} Estonia. She was the first female test pilot, testing airplanes for Anthony Fokker, the French aircraft firm Morane-Saulnier, and the Russian airplane manufacturer Fedor Tereshchenko. During World War I, she flew missions for the Red Cross and during the civil war, may have flown observation missions for the Red Army. In 1923, she moved to the United States and made several attempts to be the first woman to make a transatlantic fight, though none <b>ever</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> fruition. After 1930, she quit flying and worked in various positions, including as a taxi driver.|$|E
25|$|Tillamooks I (1946) was {{the closest}} the Supreme Court <b>ever</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> holding that unrecognized {{aboriginal}} title is property under the Fifth Amendment. Although the suit had been instituted under a special jurisdictional statute waiving the defense of sovereign immunity, the Court ordered compensation even while insisting that the statute itself had not created a property right; only the dissent referred to the Fifth Amendment. According to the Ninth Circuit in Miller v. United States (1947), Tillamooks I held that even unrecognized aboriginal title is property under the Fifth Amendment, the extinguishment of which requires just compensation. Although the issue was not raised in the case, a footnote in Hynes v. Grimes Packing (1949) repudiated the 9th Circuit view and insisted that aboriginal title was non-compensable. Tillamooks II (1951) appeared to accept the Hynes view by denying interest to the compensation paid on remand following Tillamooks I.|$|E
25|$|At {{the start}} of 1995–96 season, Tkachuk, a {{restricted}} free agent at the time, signed a lucrative, front-loaded five-year offer sheet worth $17 million, with $6 million coming in the first season from the Chicago Blackhawks. Despite the Jet's impending relocation to Phoenix, Arizona, and the organization's poor financial situation, the Jets matched the offer-sheet within six hours. As a result, Tkachuk was stripped of the captaincy and replaced by Kris King; nonetheless, he set a career-high 50 goals and 98 points, the closest he <b>ever</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> reaching the 100-point plateau. Tkachuk was renamed captain of the team in their final playoff game due to an injury to Kris King. Going up against the Presidents' Trophy-winning Detroit Red Wings, the Jets lost in six games, with Tkachuk scoring a goal and two assists in the series. After losing Game 6 by a score of 4–1, the final Jets game {{in the city of}} Winnipeg before relocating to Phoenix, Tkachuk led the Jets in a final skate around Winnipeg Arena in appreciation of the fans.|$|E

25|$|On April 3, 1882, Ford {{fatally shot}} Jesse James behind the ear at James' rented {{apartment}} in St. Joseph, Missouri. Bob {{and his brother}} Charley surrendered to the authorities, pleaded guilty, and were promptly pardoned by Crittenden. On October 4, 1882, Frank James surrendered to Crittenden. Accounts say that Frank surrendered {{with the understanding that}} he would not be extradited to Northfield, Minnesota. Only two cases <b>ever</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> trial– one in Gallatin, Missouri for the July 15, 1881 robbery of the Rock Island Line train at Winston, Missouri in which a train crewman and a passenger were killed, and one in Huntsville, Alabama for the March 11, 1881 robbery of a United States Army Corps of Engineers payroll at Muscle Shoals, Alabama. Frank James was found not guilty by juries in both cases (July 1883 at Gallatin and April 1884 at Huntsville). Missouri kept jurisdiction over him with other charges but they never came to trial and they kept him from being extradited to Minnesota. Frank James died on February 8, 1915, at the age of 72.|$|E

The teaser materials were part of an early phase of our marketing and were never planned for long-term use." [...] The alien-focused campaign began on May 4, 2012 with the release of a new trailer, coinciding with Fox's changing the film's title to The Watch to further distance the film from the Martin case.|$|E
