5|$|In 2012, two {{brothers}} <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>early</b> 20s, {{one of them}} armed with a knife, attacked a 63-year-old man in a town in the Northern Bohemian borderland. He shot both attackers with his legally owned pistol, killing one of them. The police closed the case as legitimate self-defense six months later and brought charges against the surviving attacker.|$|E
5|$|In Van Nuys, California, two men <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>early</b> twenties named Blake and Mike (Tyson Turrou and David Faustino) {{sneak into}} a house that Blake claims was where the comedy {{television}} series The Brady Bunch was filmed. Inside, they find a perfect recreation of the house from the series; Mike, unsettled, gets worried and leaves, but Blake plods on. Blake is subsequently sent hurtling {{through the air and}} smashes into Mike's car and dies.|$|E

5|$|Whatever Tiberius's motives, the {{withdrawal}} was almost disastrous for Augustus's succession plans. Gaius and Lucius were still <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>early</b> teens, and Augustus, now 57 years old, had no immediate successor. There {{was no longer}} a guarantee of a peaceful transfer of power after Augustus's death, nor a guarantee that his family, and therefore his family's allies, would continue to hold power should the position of princeps survive.|$|E
5|$|For the 1909 season, MacLaren {{worked to}} improve his fitness prior to that summer's Test series against Australia. Jackson was first choice to lead the England team, {{but when he was}} unavailable, MacLaren was {{appointed}} captain, to the approval of critics and the public. MacLaren began the season well for Lancashire, and as Australia struggled <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>early</b> tour matches, England began the Tests as favourites to win. England won the low-scoring first match; the press praised MacLaren's deployment of fielders.|$|E

5|$|Honora Sneyd {{was soon}} pregnant, {{giving birth to}} her {{daughter}} Honora on 30 May 1774, who {{died at the age}} of sixteen. Her second child, Lovell, who inherited the property, was born the following year on 30 June 1775. The Edgeworth children were raised according to the system of Rousseau, as refined and modified by the Edgeworths. Richard Edgeworth considered his early educational efforts a failure, the older children from his first marriage growing up unruly and then being sent away to school, and readily concurred with his new wife's stricter rules. However he had seen very little of them <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>early</b> years.|$|E
5|$|I am {{thinking}} this {{morning of the}} men in the mills and factories; I {{am thinking}} of the women who, for a paltry wage, are compelled to work out their lives; of the little children who, in this system, are robbed of their childhood, and <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>early,</b> tender years, are seized in the remorseless grasp of Mammon, and forced into the industrial dungeons, there to feed the machines while they themselves are being starved body and soul....|$|E
5|$|In late March, polls {{suggested}} McCarthy {{would likely}} win the Wisconsin Primary. Around this time, Johnson decided {{to drop out}} of the race. When he informed Humphrey of his decision, the Vice President urged Johnson to remain as a candidate. Johnson replied that it was not in the best interest of the nation to mix the partisan politics of a presidential election with the ongoing Vietnam crisis, and that if elected, he probably would not be able to complete the term since the men in his family usually died <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>early</b> sixties. A week prior to the primary, on March 31, the President publicly announced that he would not seek nor accept the Democratic Party nomination, thus setting the stage for a Humphrey presidential run.|$|E

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>their</b> <b>early</b> years, Leicester {{played at}} {{numerous}} grounds, but have only played at two since {{they joined the}} Football League. When first starting out they played on a field by the Fosse Road, hence the original name Leicester Fosse. They moved from there to Victoria Park, and subsequently to Belgrave Road. Upon turning professional the club moved to Mill Lane. After eviction from Mill Lane the club played at the County Cricket ground while seeking a new ground. The club secured {{the use of an}} area of ground by Filbert Street, and moved there in 1891.|$|E
5|$|Like most {{expansion}} teams, the Raptors struggled <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>early</b> years, {{but after}} the acquisition of Vince Carter through a draft day trade in 1998, the team set league-attendance records and made the NBA playoffs in 2000, 2001, and 2002. Carter was instrumental in leading the team to a then-franchise high 47 wins and their first playoff series win in 2001, where they advanced to the Eastern Conference semifinals. During the 2002–03 and 2003–04 seasons, they failed to make significant progress, and Carter was traded in 2004 to the New Jersey Nets.|$|E
5|$|Melcombe Regis {{is thought}} to be the first port at which the Black Death came into England in June 1348, {{possibly}} either aboard a spice ship or an army ship. <b>In</b> <b>their</b> <b>early</b> history Weymouth and Melcombe Regis were rivals for trade and industry, but the towns were united in an Act of Parliament in 1571 to form a double borough. Both towns have become known as Weymouth, despite Melcombe Regis being the main centre. The villages of Upwey, Broadwey, Preston, Wyke Regis, Chickerell, Southill, Radipole and Littlemoor have become part of the built-up area.|$|E

25|$|Boyd {{states the}} band was also {{influenced}} by soul, funk, and jazz in a general sense, and metal <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>earlier</b> days. Boyd states that the band composed 9 minute Pink Floyd-esq progressive rock songs <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>earlier</b> days, but the band ended up unhappy with the end results, and strayed away from the approach upon becoming {{more familiar with the}} Beatles and Led Zeppelin. Wilcox stated that drumming of John Bonham, Joseph Modeliste, and Russell Batiste were particularly influential to his drumming style.|$|R
5|$|Opeth is a Swedish {{heavy metal}} band from Stockholm, formed in 1989. The {{group has been}} through several {{personnel}} changes, but lead vocalist, guitarist and songwriter Mikael Åkerfeldt has remained Opeth's primary driving force throughout the years. Opeth has consistently incorporated progressive, folk, blues, classical and jazz influences into its usually lengthy compositions, as well as strong influences from death metal, especially <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>early</b> works. Many songs include acoustic guitar passages and strong dynamic shifts, as well as both death growls and clean vocals. Opeth is also well known for their incorporation of Mellotrons in their work. Opeth rarely made live appearances supporting their first four albums; but since conducting their first world tour after the 2001 release of Blackwater Park, they have led several major world tours.|$|E
5|$|Shimura mainly {{found her}} characters' names by looking through name dictionaries, {{although}} she also took {{the names of}} acquaintances and slightly changed them, and even used train station names for side characters appearing only once. Out of all the characters, Shimura is most pleased with Kanako Sasa. For the designs of clothes for the female characters, Shimura consulted various fashion magazines for girls <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>early</b> teens, especially Nicola. Shimura commented self-deprecatingly in the afterword of volume one that, like her other series, her characters do not look very different from each other, her panels are too white, and there is much pathos.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{before she}} turned 15, Falle met two child prostitutes {{who were also}} <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>early</b> teens. One of these girls was {{pregnant}} by her 42-year-old pimp. The two girls offered Falle {{a place to sleep}} at their apartment while their pimp was away; feeling there was no alternative, she accepted. Out of concern for Falle's safety, they taught her how to put a condom on a penis by practicing on a cucumber. These children effectively groomed Falle. She stayed at the apartment for several days, and she was watched by various men. By the time the pimp returned, Falle had moved on.|$|E

50|$|In V・V, {{the players}} collect gems {{that allow them}} to choose the various power-ups (sans bombs) through a Gradius-like power meter; Toaplan experimented with this system <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>earlier</b> Slap Fight.|$|R
5|$|The Jags {{flirted with}} a number of colour schemes <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>early</b> years. From their {{inception}} until 1900 the kits were predominantly blue with red and white trimmings. There was then a brief period in which the players wore an orange and black striped top with white shorts and black socks. This was replaced in 1905 by a colour scheme close to that used by Aston Villa, before the club reverted to the predominantly blue kits in 1909. In season 1936–37 they changed to, and settled upon, the red-yellow-and-black attire for which they are best known, this change having been triggered initially by the club borrowing kits from the local rugby union team, West of Scotland Football Club.|$|E
5|$|The Jets and Raiders were {{founding}} {{members of the}} American Football League; both teams began to play in 1960, the Jets under the name Titans of New York. The two teams had little success <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>early</b> years, playing so poorly that both the Titans and Raiders were allowed to draft players from other AFL teams following the 1962 season. In 1967, the Jets, {{under the guidance of}} coach Weeb Ewbank and quarterback Joe Namath, posted their first winning record at 7–5–2. Oakland, on the other hand, won the Western Division in 1967 with a 13–1 mark under coach John Rauch and then the AFL Championship Game over the Houston Oilers, 40–7, before falling to the Green Bay Packers in Super Bowl II. Both teams were seen as likely contenders for the 1968 AFL Championship.|$|E
5|$|The Rolling Stones have assimilated various musical genres {{into their}} own {{collective}} sound. Throughout the band's career, their musical contributions have been marked by a continual reference and reliance on musical styles including blues, psychedelia, R, country, folk, reggae, dance, and world music, exemplified by Jones' collaboration with the Master Musicians of Jajouka, as well as traditional English styles that use stringed instrumentation like harps. Brian Jones experimented {{with the use of}} non-traditional instruments such as the sitar and slide guitar <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>early</b> days. The group started out covering early rock 'n' roll and blues songs, and have never stopped playing live or recording cover songs.|$|E
