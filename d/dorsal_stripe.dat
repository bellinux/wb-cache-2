5|$|In 2008, {{researchers}} {{studying the}} presence or absence of a <b>dorsal</b> <b>stripe</b> suggested that it has independently evolved several times in Timema species and is an adaptation for crypsis on needle-like leaves. All of the eight Timema species with a <b>dorsal</b> <b>stripe</b> have at least one host plant with needle-like foliage. Of the thirteen unstriped species, seven feed only on broadleaf plants. Four (T. ritensis, T. podura, T. genevieve, and T. coffmani) rest during the day on the host plant's trunk rather than its leaves and have bodies that are brown, gray, or tan. Only two species (T. nakipa and T. boharti) have green unstriped morphs that feed on needle-like foliage; both are generalist feeders that also feed on broadleaf hosts.|$|E
5|$|A. m. columbianum: Yellow to tan <b>dorsal</b> <b>stripe</b> {{on black}} body, {{continuous}} blotches to spots along body ending in narrowed blotches with spot patterns distributed on the head.

5|$|A dun-colored {{coat with}} {{primitive}} markings {{that include a}} <b>dorsal</b> <b>stripe</b> and often leg striping and transverse shoulder stripes reflect the wildtype coat and are observed in most wild extant equine species. Only the mountain zebra lacks a <b>dorsal</b> <b>stripe.</b> In domestic horses, dun color and primitive markings exist in some animals across many breeds. The purpose of the bold black-and-white striping of zebras has been a subject of debate among biologists for over a century, but recent (2014) evidence supports the theory {{that they are a}} form of protection from biting flies. These insects appear to be less attracted to striped coats and, compared to other wild equines, zebras live in areas with the highest fly activity. With the exception of the domestic horses, which have long manes that lay over the neck and long tail hair growing {{from the top of the}} tailhead or dock, most equines have erect manes and long tails ending in a tuft of hair. The coats of some equine species undergo shedding in certain parts of their range and are thick in the winter.|$|E
5|$|A. m. macrodactylum: Citrine, dull citrine, to tan <b>dorsal</b> <b>stripe</b> that is diffuse and {{continuous}} along grayish body. Pattern ending in diffuse specks of stripe color or absent on head and snout. White flecks on sides sometimes {{coming together to}} form larger flecks. Number of vomerine teeth equaling 33, forming a distinguished transverse arc. Number of costal grooves equals 13.|$|E
50|$|The {{males are}} brown with two yellow <b>dorsal</b> <b>stripes</b> that {{run along the}} spine, {{one on each side}} of the back. The females are solely brown.|$|R
5000|$|Grullo: Grullo is {{the action}} of the dun gene on black. Typically, grullo coats have cool slate hues as opposed to warm orange-brown tones. Furthermore, grullos have dun {{characteristics}} such as bold <b>dorsal</b> <b>stripes</b> and leg bars.|$|R
50|$|Elacatinus figaro is dark in colour {{with yellow}} ventral and <b>dorsal</b> <b>stripes</b> and opaque blue {{pectoral}} fins. It has a terminal {{mouth and the}} pelvic fins are merged to form a suction cup. They are normally 2.5-3.4 cm in length.|$|R
5|$|The {{body of the}} long-toed {{salamander}} is dusky black with a <b>dorsal</b> <b>stripe</b> of tan, yellow, or olive-green. This stripe can also be broken up {{into a series of}} spots. The sides of the body can have fine white or pale blue flecks. The belly is dark-brown or sooty in color with white flecks. Root tubercles are present, but they are not quite as developed as other species, such as the tiger salamander.|$|E
5|$|Campbell's dwarf hamster (Phodopus campbelli) is {{a species}} of hamster in the genus Phodopus. It was given its common name by Oldfield Thomas in honour of C. W. Campbell (Charles William Campbell), who {{collected}} the first specimen in Mongolia on July 1, 1902. It is distinguished from the closely related Djungarian hamster as it has smaller ears and no dark fur on its crown. Campbell's dwarf hamster typically has a narrow <b>dorsal</b> <b>stripe</b> compared to the Djungarian hamster and grey fur on the stomach.|$|E
5|$|In summer, the fur of the Djungarian hamster on {{the back}} changes from ash-grey to dark brown, or {{sometimes}} pale brown with a tint. The face changes to grey or brown, while the mouth area, the whisker area, and the ears are slightly brighter. The outer ears and the eyes have black edges. The rest of the head is dark brown or black. From the head to the tail runs a black-brown <b>dorsal</b> <b>stripe.</b> The throat, belly, tail and limbs are white. The ears are grey with a pinkish tint with scattered black hairs. The hairs on the underside are completely white.|$|E
50|$|Like other Gobiomorphus species, {{the first}} dorsal fin of males {{features}} a coloured stripe. The colour of the stripe in upland bullies {{appears to be}} locally variable. Many populations have bright orange <b>dorsal</b> <b>stripes,</b> however some have bright green, pink, yellow, cream or uncoloured stripes.|$|R
50|$|Ventrally the lizards are {{yellow or}} orange to greenish-orange coloured, partly with a mother-of-pearl shimmer. Males {{are often more}} brightly coloured. Juveniles {{resemble}} their parents but the coloured <b>dorsal</b> <b>stripes</b> are narrower and less intensly coloured. Ventrally the juveniles are pitch-black {{in contrast to the}} adults.|$|R
25|$|Many foals, {{particularly}} if they are buckskin, smoky black, or black, are born with primitive markings such as <b>dorsal</b> <b>stripes</b> and leg bars that disappear after the foal coat sheds. Such horses are sometimes mistakenly registered as dun. This error seems particularly common in foals that turn gray.|$|R
5|$|The Djungarian hamster (Phodopus sungorus), {{also known}} as the Dzungarian hamster, striped dwarf hamster, Siberian hamster, Siberian dwarf hamster or Russian winter white dwarf hamster, is one of three species of hamster in the genus Phodopus. It is ball-shaped and {{typically}} half the size of the Syrian hamster, so is called a dwarf hamster along with all Phodopus species. Features of the Djungarian hamster include a typically thick, dark grey <b>dorsal</b> <b>stripe</b> and furry feet. As winter approaches and the days shorten, the Djungarian hamster's dark fur is almost entirely replaced with white fur. In captivity, this does not always happen. In the wild, they originate from Dzungaria, the wheat fields of Kazakhstan, the meadows of Mongolia, Siberia, and the birch stands of Manchuria.|$|E
5|$|The gray {{mouse lemur}} shares many traits with other mouse lemurs, {{including}} soft fur, a long tail, long hind limbs, a <b>dorsal</b> <b>stripe</b> {{down the back}} (not always distinct), a short snout, rounded skull, prominent eyes, and large, membranous, protruding ears. It has large eyes and a tapetum lucidum to enhance its vision at night. The dorsal coat is brownish-gray with various reddish tones, the flanks are light gray to beige, and the ventral fur has discrete dull beige or whitish-beige patches along portions of the belly. On the rounded face, there is a pale white patch above the nose and between the eyes; some individuals have dark orbital markings. The furred portions of the hands and feet are off-white.|$|E
5|$|The species Timema cristinae {{exhibits}} both striped and unstriped populations {{depending on}} the host plant, a form of polymorphism that clearly illustrates the camouflage function of the stripe. The earliest ancestors of this species were generalists that fed on plants belonging to both the genera Adenostoma and Ceanothus. They eventually diverged into two distinct ecotypes with a more specialist host plant preference. One ecotype prefers to feed on Adenostoma while the other ecotype prefers to feed on Ceanothus. The Adenostoma ecotype possesses a white <b>dorsal</b> <b>stripe,</b> an adaptation {{to blend in with}} the needle-like leaves of the plant, while the Ceanothus ecotype does not (Ceanothus spp. have broad leaves). The Adenostoma ecotype is also smaller, with a wider head, and shorter legs.|$|E
50|$|S. uniformis {{is a large}} robust lizard, {{and adults}} can grow to 5.5 inches in body length (snout-to-vent), with a tail {{slightly}} longer than the body. Color is brown or tan with yellow and black <b>dorsal</b> <b>stripes</b> or mottling and a black collar {{on the sides of}} the neck.|$|R
50|$|The river dropwing is a {{medium-sized}} dragonfly {{with a bright}} orange to reddish colouration and small orange patches on the hindwings. The abdomen shows small black <b>dorsal</b> <b>stripes.</b> The eyes are brownish orange. The female is stouter than the male and more mottled. The species often perches conspicuously on reeds or sedges.|$|R
50|$|Regina rigida is olive brown dorsally. Additionally, two blackish <b>dorsal</b> <b>stripes</b> {{may or may}} not be present. The upper lips (labial scales) are yellow. Ventrally it is yellow {{with two}} {{parallel}} series of black spots, which merge anteriorly into a single series. The ventral surface of the tail may have a median black line, or it may be unmarked.|$|R
5|$|The Sunda slow loris has dark rings {{around its}} large eyes, a white nose with a whitish strip that {{extends to the}} {{forehead}} and a dark stripe that stretches {{from the back of}} the head along the spine. Its soft, thick, woolly fur ranges from light brown to deep reddish brown, with a lighter underside. The species is distinct from the Bengal slow loris due to the dark inverse teardrop markings around the eyes which meet the dark <b>dorsal</b> <b>stripe</b> on the back of the head. It tends to have a much more distinct white stripe between the eyes, more distinct dark coloring around the eyes, and a browner coat than the Bengal slow loris which is larger, grayer, and shows less contrast. The Sunda slow loris has less white facial coloring than the much smaller pygmy slow loris. Local color variations are known to occur.|$|E
5|$|The Cleveland Bay {{generally}} {{stands between}} , and is always bay in colour. Bright bay horses (bays {{with a more}} reddish tint than normal) are the most preferred by breeders, followed by ordinary bay, dark bay and then light bay. This preference for brighter shades of bay was originally stated in the official breed standard, although this stipulation has since been removed. In some bloodlines of the breed, light, grayish hairs in the mane and tail are known as a characteristic of pure blood. White markings, except for a small star on the forehead, render the horse inadmissible to the stud book. Horses {{are expected to have}} complete black points, including completely black lower legs. Legs that are red below the knees and hocks are considered faulty in colour, although they do not disqualify a horse from registry. The occasional red legs that appear in the breed are thought to come from chestnut Thoroughbred stallions that were crossed into Cleveland Bay and Yorkshire Coach Horse bloodlines at some points in the history of both breeds. The uniformity in colour is encouraged as it makes creating matching driving teams and pairs very easy. When the breed was first developed, the horses almost always had a countershaded <b>dorsal</b> <b>stripe,</b> but these disappeared with the outcrossings of the 18th century.|$|E
25|$|Of equids {{other than}} horses, all except the {{mountain}} zebra show a distinct <b>dorsal</b> <b>stripe.</b> Among domesticated donkeys, most {{have a black}} <b>dorsal</b> <b>stripe,</b> though {{it can be difficult}} to see on melanistic individuals. In the African wild ass, the <b>dorsal</b> <b>stripe</b> is thin but distinct and black. In Przewalski's horse, the <b>dorsal</b> <b>stripe</b> is usually dark brown, while it is black in the bred-back tarpan. In the plains zebra, the <b>dorsal</b> <b>stripe</b> is narrow and edged by white, while in Grevy's zebra, it is quite bold. The dorsal stripes of the onager and kiang are dark brown and especially vivid.|$|E
50|$|The larvae {{are light}} green or {{sometimes}} pink, {{with a white}} <b>dorsal</b> longitudinal <b>stripe.</b>|$|R
50|$|The moth flies from April to June {{depending}} on the location. Larva blackish, with two yellow <b>dorsal</b> <b>stripes</b> with red dots and white spots. The larvae feed on lichen on trees, both on conifers (Ochsenhemer) and on deciduous trees (Spuler). Can be obtained by beating saplings, also in bushes and in the grass, sometimes feeding at flowers in the daytime.|$|R
50|$|The name Eudoxiatopoplana comes is a {{combination}} of Greek εὐδοξία (eudoxia), honor + ἄτοπος (atopos), out of place + Latin plana, flat. It honors Professor Eudóxia Maria Froehlich for her contribution to the study of land planarians. The specific epithet bilaticlavia comes from Latin bi-, two + laticlavia, having a broad stripe, and alludes to the two broad <b>dorsal</b> <b>stripes</b> present on this species.|$|R
25|$|Dorsal barbs are {{suggestions}} of vertical striping {{on either side}} of the <b>dorsal</b> <b>stripe.</b> They may be so closely placed that they resemble secondary dorsal stripes. Dorsal barbs are also called fishboning.|$|E
25|$|Less {{distinct}} primitive markings {{can also}} occur on non-dun horses, even in breeds such as Thoroughbreds, Arabians, and Standardbreds, {{which are not}} known to have any dun individuals. The most common primitive marking found is a dorsal stripe; others do occur, but not without the <b>dorsal</b> <b>stripe,</b> even on non-duns.|$|E
25|$|Also called zebra bars, tiger stripes, or garters, leg {{bars are}} the most common {{accessory}} to the <b>dorsal</b> <b>stripe.</b> Leg bars are most commonly seen on or above the knees and hocks, and reflect the underlying coat color. Leg bars on bay duns are black within the points, and reddish above them.|$|E
50|$|Sexual {{dimorphism}} can be {{witnessed in}} the Lodgepole Chipmunk as females {{are known to}} be larger in size than males. Female Lodgepole Chipmunks have an average body weight of 55-69 grams whereas males on average are 50-60 grams in total weight. Along with weight, females can be observed having a body length ranging from 197-229 mm (7 3/4 - 9 inches), while males typically exhibit an average body length of 200-222 mm (7.8 - 8.7 inches). Body patterns remain consistent in both sexes as they exhibit characteristic white <b>dorsal</b> and facial <b>stripes,</b> where the central <b>dorsal</b> <b>stripes</b> {{are known to be}} less prominent and closer to yellow-white than that of the lateral white stripes. In comparison to other close relatives, this species can be identified by examination of the darker and more broad facial stripes. Other notable body patterns include dark black <b>dorsal</b> <b>stripes,</b> a lack of a black stripe underneath the prominent white lateral stripe, bright orange color on sides and orange-gray coloring on the shoulders, a gray under-belly, and a gray rump. The top of the head, the crown, is known to be brown with some gray interspersed. The tail, lengthier in females, ranges from 13-22 mm (0.5 - 0.87 inches) and is characterized by its black tip and cinnamon body.|$|R

50|$|Rhagio mystaceus has {{an overall}} dark colour, with males growing to 7-9 mm, and females {{reaching}} 6-8 mm. The thorax has three dark <b>dorsal</b> <b>stripes.</b> Normally, the center stripe {{has a very}} thin, pale line running down the middle. On the abdomen, there are yellowish rings at the posterior of the segments. However, the basal segment on some specimens are mostly yellowish and have a black dorsal and lateral spot.|$|R
