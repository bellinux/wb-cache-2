25|$|In 1982, Parramatta could {{seemingly}} <b>do</b> <b>no</b> <b>wrong,</b> {{winning the}} Minor Premiership by four games over Manly. Though they were beaten 20-0 by Manly in the Major semi-final, the Eels then thrashed Eastern Suburbs 33-0 in the Preliminary Final, {{before going on}} to turn the tables on the Sea Eagles with a 21-8 in the Grand Final at the Sydney Cricket Ground to win their second successive premiership.|$|E
25|$|During {{this period}} he could really <b>do</b> <b>no</b> <b>wrong.</b> Loaded with riches and honors, {{he was so}} famous and so {{formidable}} as a performer that his rival and friend, the castrato Gioacchino Conti ("Gizziello") {{is said to have}} fainted away from sheer despondency on hearing him sing. George Frideric Handel was also keen to engage Farinelli for his company in London, and while in Venice in January 1730, tried unsuccessfully to meet him.|$|E
25|$|Then the debaters {{return to}} their {{previous}} analysis of Pittacus' and Simonides' poetry. On Socrates' interpretation, Pittacus claims {{that it is difficult}} to be a good man, but presumably possible. Simonides, on the other hand, claims that it is impossible to live without ever being a bad man, and even to be a good man on occasion is difficult (344a45d). Simonides praises those who at least do not do wrong willingly. Socrates' interpretation is that, since Simonides was a wise man, he must know that no one does any wrong willingly; accordingly, he must mean that he will willingly praise those who <b>do</b> <b>no</b> <b>wrong,</b> not that some do wrong willingly and others unwillingly, only the latter garnering his praise (345d46b). Socrates thus argues that the authority of Simonides does not stand against his understanding of virtue and whether anyone willingly does wrong.|$|E

500|$|Sue's {{campaign}} {{for congress in}} the third season has not heretofore found much favor with reviewers, though Futterman felt that the addition of Burt Hummel as a rival candidate [...] "gives us a sliver of hope, mainly because Mike O'Malley has managed to <b>do</b> <b>no</b> <b>wrong</b> thus far" [...] as Burt, and VanDerWerff, while otherwise unimpressed, said he liked [...] "the idea of the show pitting its most purely heroic figure against its most purely villainous". Bell {{was pleased with the}} new development, and noted that in three seasons, [...] "no character has grown more than Burt". Canning said he loved having Burt as Sue's nemesis, and Kubicek wrote that the two are [...] "awesome together".|$|E
500|$|Abbott {{stated that}} there were two reasons for what he {{considered}} to be the show's failure. The first was Rodgers and Hammerstein's overconfidence; they thought of themselves as Broadway's [...] "Golden Boys" [...] who could <b>do</b> <b>no</b> <b>wrong.</b> The other was the play-within-the-play, which had not been thoroughly thought out by anyone. According to Abbott, Hammerstein remained [...] "positively Sphinx-like" [...] on the subject. At a loss to understand the characters of the play-within-the play, Alton came up with nothing more than routine song-and-dance numbers. During the run, the duo approached choreographer Jerome Robbins and asked him if he could fix the dances. Robbins said that he could, but he would not, as [...] "it would kill Bob Alton". According to Hammerstein biographer Hugh Fordin, [...] " [...] intended contrast between onstage and backstage life was never achieved because the onstage show was so tepid and confusing." ...|$|E
500|$|Wentz {{referred}} to [...] "I Don't Care" [...] as a [...] "narcissist's anthem" [...] {{that addresses the}} current generation's short attention span. Wentz further explored the subjects of narcissism and apathy in [...] "(Coffee's for Closers)", as Stump explained, [...] "The past decade has been totally about 'me.' It's totally about 'Oh, I'm sad. I want this. I know somebody who knows this person. Me me me me me,' so that's what that song is about." [...] Additionally, [...] "America's Suitehearts" [...] discusses society's fixation with celebrities {{and the desire to}} let them <b>do</b> <b>no</b> <b>wrong.</b> [...] "27" [...] explores the hedonistic lifestyles common in rock and roll music. The title is a reference to the 27 Club, a group of influential musicians, including Janis Joplin, Kurt Cobain, and Jim Morrison, who all {{died at the age of}} 27. Wentz felt that he was living a similarly dangerous lifestyle, and was [...] "stoked" [...] to make it to his 28th birthday. Stump added [...] "There was a countdown clock and everything. I remember, our manager called me up on Pete's 28th birthday and screamed, 'We made it!'" ...|$|E

500|$|The musical {{received}} almost unanimous {{rave reviews}} after its opening in 1945. [...] According to Hischak, reviews {{were not as}} exuberant as for Oklahoma! as the critics were not taken by surprise this time. [...] John Chapman of the Daily News termed it [...] "one of the finest musical plays I have ever seen and I shall remember it always". [...] The New York Timess reviewer, Lewis Nichols, stated that [...] "Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein 2d, who can <b>do</b> <b>no</b> <b>wrong,</b> have continued doing no wrong in adapting Liliom into a musical play. [...] Their Carousel is on the whole delightful." [...] Wilella Waldorf of the New York Post, however, complained, [...] "Carousel seemed to us a rather long evening. [...] The Oklahoma! formula is becoming a bit monotonous and so are Miss de Mille's ballets. [...] All right, go ahead and shoot!" [...] Dance Magazine gave Linn plaudits {{for her role as}} Louise, stating, [...] "Bambi doesn't come on until twenty minutes before eleven, and for the next forty minutes, she practically holds the audience in her hand". [...] Howard Barnes in the New York Herald Tribune also applauded the dancing: [...] "It has waited for Miss de Mille to come through with peculiarly American dance patterns for a musical show to become as much a dance as a song show." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Actually, I {{must also}} be criticised. I am {{not afraid of the}} {{criticism}} concerning what I do wrong, because then I know. If you say the king cannot be criticised, it means that the king is not human. [...] If the king can <b>do</b> <b>no</b> <b>wrong,</b> it is akin to looking down upon him, because the king is not being treated as a human being. But the king can do wrong....If someone offers criticisms suggesting that the king is wrong, then I would like to be informed of their opinion. If I am not, that could be problematic... If we hold that the king cannot be criticised or violated, then the king ends up in a difficult situation." ...|$|E
2500|$|During his 2005 {{birthday}} speech, Bhumibol invited criticism: [...] "Actually, I {{must also}} be criticised. I am not afraid if the criticism concerns what I do wrong, because then I know. Because if you say the king cannot be criticised, {{it means that the}} king is not human", he claimed. [...] "If the king can <b>do</b> <b>no</b> <b>wrong,</b> it is akin to looking down upon him because the king is not being treated as a human being. But the king can do wrong." [...] A widespread barrage of criticisms resulted, followed by a sharp rise in lèse-majesté prosecutions. Lèse-majesté cases rose from five or six a year pre-2005 to 478 in 2010.|$|E

2500|$|Prior to the German Visa Affair 2005, Fischer was {{a popular}} politician, [...] "loved by an entire nation." [...] Writing in Der Spiegel, {{journalist}} Charles Hawley opined that since 1998, [...] "Joschka Fischer's popularity has been virtually unassailable: The icon of the environmentally minded Green Party could, it seemed, <b>do</b> <b>no</b> <b>wrong.</b> Indeed, Fischer was so popular in 2002 that Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder largely based his early election campaign {{on the fact that}} Fischer would remain at his side at the helm of Germany's political leadership." [...] As Germany’s Foreign Minister, Fischer’s popularity soared when he opposed the Iraq War, and his very public struggle with his weight endeared him to many Germans.|$|E
2500|$|As one of Hillary Clinton's staunchest supporters, Rendell {{argued that}} many media outlets' {{coverage}} of her campaign were biased. On March 31, 2008 he congratulated Fox News {{on what he}} {{considered to be the}} best campaign coverage. Addressing Fox & Friends host Steve Doocy, Rendell said, [...] "I think during this entire primary coverage, starting in Iowa and up to the present, Fox has done the fairest job, has remained the most objective of all the cable networks ... You actually have done a very balanced job of reporting the news, {{and some of the other}} stations are just caught up with Senator Obama, who is a great guy, but Senator Obama can <b>do</b> <b>no</b> <b>wrong,</b> and Senator Clinton can do no right." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mike Love said [...] "some of {{the words}} were so totally {{offensive}} to me that I wouldn't even sing 'em because I thought it was too nauseating." [...] The original lyrics of [...] "I Know There's an Answer", known as [...] "Hang On to Your Ego", created a stir within the group. He opposed the song's original message, though Jardine recalled {{that the decision to}} change the lyrics was ultimately Brian's: [...] "Brian was very concerned. He wanted to know what we thought about it. To be honest, I don't think we even knew what an ego was... Finally Brian decided, 'Forget it. I'm changing the lyrics. There's too much controversy.'" [...] On Love's reaction to the album, Jardine commented: [...] "Mike was very confused... Mike's a formula hound – if it doesn't have a hook in it, if he can't hear a hook in it, he doesn't want to know about it.... I wasn't exactly thrilled with the change, but I grew to really appreciate it as soon as we started to work on it. It wasn't like anything we'd heard before." [...] Carl Wilson said: [...] "I loved every minute of it. He [...] could <b>do</b> <b>no</b> <b>wrong.</b> He could play me anything, and I would love it." [...] Brian remembers that Carl was enthused with the album, but not Dennis and Mike. Author John Tobler wrote that Dennis and Bruce Johnston loved the album, but that Jardine felt [...] "It sure doesn't sound like the old stuff." ...|$|E
