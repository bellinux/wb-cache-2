50|$|The pool-type reactor {{design of}} the EBR-II {{provides}} passive safety: the reactor core, its <b>fuel</b> <b>handling</b> <b>equipment,</b> and many other systems of the reactor are submerged under molten sodium. By providing a fluid which readily conducts heat from the fuel to the coolant, and which operates at relatively low temperatures, the EBR-II takes maximum advantage of expansion of the coolant, fuel, and structure during off-normal events which increase temperatures. The expansion of the fuel and structure in an off-normal situation causes the system to shut down even without human operator intervention. In April 1986, two special tests were performed on the EBR-II, in which the main primary cooling pumps were shut off with the reactor at full power (62.5 megawatts, thermal). By not allowing the normal shutdown systems to interfere, the reactor power dropped to near zero within about 300 seconds. No damage to the fuel or the reactor resulted. The same day, this demonstration was followed by another important test. With the reactor again at full power, flow in the secondary cooling system was stopped. This test caused the temperature to increase, since there was nowhere for the reactor heat to go. As the primary (reactor) cooling system became hotter, the fuel, sodium coolant, and structure expanded, and the reactor shut down. This test showed that it will shut down using inherent features such as thermal expansion, even if the ability to remove heat from the primary cooling system is lost.|$|E

40|$|A key {{task in the}} {{material}} handling system design process is the selection and configuration of equipment for material transport and storage in a facility. Material <b>handling</b> <b>equipment</b> selection is a complex, tedious task, and there are few tools other than checklists to assist engineers {{in the selection of}} appropriate, cost-effective material <b>handling</b> <b>equipment.</b> This paper describes the development of an intelligent material <b>handling</b> <b>equipment</b> selection system called material <b>handling</b> <b>equipment</b> selection advisor (MHESA). The MHESA is composed of three modules: (1) a database to store equipment types with their specifications; (2) a knowledge-based expert system for assisting material <b>handling</b> <b>equipment</b> selection; and (3) an analytic hierarchy process (AHP) model to choose the most favorable equipment type.

40|$|RBG- 45207 Ladies and Gentlemen: In the {{referenced}} letter, EOI requested NRC {{approval of}} a License Amendment Request and asked that NRC consider exigent circumstances associated with the request. The basis for consideration of exigent circumstances relates to the impact that a delay in performing the associated activity (i. e., the heavy load movement) would have on upcoming Refueling Outage 9, scheduled to begin March 4, 2000. Such delays could impact resumption of power from the refueling outage. Additional information on the schedule of activities that must occur prior to the refueling outage to assure reliability of the River Bend Station <b>fuel</b> <b>handling</b> <b>equipment</b> during the outage are provided herein. Enclosed is {{a copy of the}} projected schedule for replacement of the inclined fuel transfer system (IFTS) pool gate seal, as discussed in the referenced letter. This does not account for accelerating the schedule, which could be accomplished if NRC approval is not received by January 10, 2000. However, neither does the schedule account for any contingencies associated with potential delays in conducting the planned work. For example, the work on the IFTS bottom valve does not account for removing the 24 -inch valve if the work cannot be accomplished with the valve installed.

40|$|The Machinery and Engine Technology (MET) Program of the National Research Council of Canada (NRCC) has {{established}} a program {{for the evaluation of}} sensors to measure gas turbine engine performance accurately. The precise measurement of fuel flow {{is an essential part of}} steady-state gas turbine performance assessment. Prompted by an international engine testing and information exchange program, and a mandate to improve all aspects of gas turbine performance evaluation, the MET Laboratory has critically examined two types of fuel flowmeters, Coriolis and turbine. The two flowmeter types are different in that the Coriolis flowmeter measures mass flow directly, while the turbine flowmeter measures volumetric flow, which must be converted to mass flow for conventional performance analysis. The direct measurement of mass flow, using a Coriolis flowmeter, has many advantages in field testing of gas turbines, because it reduces the risk of errors resulting from the conversion process. Turbine flowmeters, on the other hand, have been regarded as an industry standard because they are compact, rugged, reliable, and relatively inexpensive. This paper describes the project objectives, the experimental installation, and the results of the comparison of the Coriolis and turbine type flowmeters in steady-state performance testing. Discussed are variations between the two types of flowmeters due to fuel characteristics, <b>fuel</b> <b>handling</b> <b>equipment,</b> acoustic and vibration interference and installation effects. Also included in this paper are estimations of measurement uncertainties for both types of flowmeters. Results indicate that the agreement between Coriolis and turbine type flowmeters is good over the entire steady-state operating range of a typical gas turbine engine. In some cases the repeatability of the Coriolis flowmeter is better than the manufacturers specification. Even a significant variation in fuel density (10...|$|E

40|$|Container {{terminals}} mainly {{include three}} types of <b>handling</b> <b>equipment,</b> i. e.; quay cranes (QCs), internal trucks (ITs) and yard cranes (YCs). Due to high cost of the <b>handling</b> <b>equipment,</b> container terminals can hardly purchase additional <b>handling</b> <b>equipment.</b> Therefore, the reasonable scheduling of these <b>handling</b> <b>equipment,</b> especially coordinated scheduling of the {{three types of}} <b>handling</b> <b>equipment,</b> {{plays an important role in}} the service level and energy-saving of container terminal. This paper addresses the problem of integrated QC scheduling, IT scheduling and YC scheduling. Firstly, this problem is formulated as a mixed integer programming model (MIP), where the objective is to minimize the total departure delay of all vessels and the total transportation energy consumption of all tasks. Furthermore, an integrated simulation-based optimization method is developed for solving the problem, where the simulation is designed for evaluation and optimization algorithm is designed for searching solution space. The optimization algorithm integrates genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, where the GA is used for global search and the PSO is used for local search. Finally, numerical experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results show that the proposed method can coordinate the scheduling of {{the three types of}} <b>handling</b> <b>equipment</b> and can realize the optimal trade-off between time-saving and energy-saving...|$|R

40|$|The EBR-II is a pool-type design; {{the reactor}} <b>fuel</b> <b>handling</b> {{components}} and entire primary-sodium coolant system are submerged {{in the primary}} tank, which is 26 feet in diameter, 26 feet high, and contains 86, 000 gallons of sodium. Since the reactor is submerged in sodium, <b>fuel</b> <b>handling</b> operations must be performed blind, making exact positioning and precision control of the <b>fuel</b> <b>handling</b> system components essential. EBR-II operated for 30 years, and the <b>fuel</b> <b>handling</b> system has performed approximately 25, 000 fuel transfer operations in that time. Due to termination of the IFR program, EBR-II was shut down on September 30, 1994. In preparation for decommissioning, all fuel in the reactor will be transferred out of EBR-II to interim storage.
