40|$|A non-conventional type {{of heating}} system is being tested at Sandia National Laboratories for solar thermal power tower applications. In this system, called {{impedance}} heating, electric current flows directly through the pipe to maintain the desired temperature. The pipe becomes the resistor where the heat is generated. Impedance heating has many advantages over previously used mineral insulated (MI) heat trace. An impedance heating system should be much more reliable than heat trace <b>cable</b> since delicate <b>junctions</b> and <b>cabling</b> are not used and the main component, a transformer, is inherently reliable. A big advantage of impedance heating is the system can be sized to rapidly heat up the piping to provide rapid response times necessary in cyclic power plants such as solar power towers.

40|$|The {{interface}} {{properties of}} high-temperature cuprate superconductors {{have been of}} interest for many years, and play {{an essential role in}} Josephson <b>junctions,</b> superconducting <b>cables,</b> and microwave electronics. In particular, the maximum critical current achievable in high-Tc wires and tapes is well known to be limited by the presence of grain boundaries, regions of mismatch between crystallites with misoriented crystalline axes. In studies of single, artificially fabricated grain boundaries the striking observation has been made that the critical current Jc of a grain boundary junction depends exponentially on the misorientation angle. Until now microscopic understanding of this apparently universal behavior has been lacking. We present here the results of a microscopic evaluation based on a construction of fully 3 D YBCO grain boundaries by molecular dynamics. With these structures, we calculate an effective tight-binding Hamiltonian for the d-wave superconductor with a grain boundary. The critical current is then shown to follow an exponential suppression with grain boundary angle. We identify the buildup of charge inhomogeneities as the dominant mechanism for the suppression of the supercurrent. Comment: 28 pages, 12 figure...|$|R

About 48 rods converge on each cone via gap junc-tions between the rod spherules and the basal processes of the cone pedicle.

40|$|Cables {{attached}} to a PCB can produce {{a significant amount of}} unintentional common-mode (CM) radiated emissions (REs). Therefore, it is important to predict these emissions at the design stage before the first prototype is fabricated to ensure time and cost savings. In this Letter, a novel method was proposed to estimate the CM RE from two cables {{attached to}} a PCB using the imbalance difference model and asymmetrical dipole antenna model. The proposed method consists of two steps: first, the induced CM voltages on the <b>junctions</b> between the <b>cables</b> and PCB are computed using the imbalance difference model; secondly, the CM REs are then estimated separately for each cable related to half of the ground plane using the asymmetrical dipole antenna model. The overall REs are then computed by the superposition of the RE from the two asymmetrical dipoles. The effectiveness of the proposed method has been verified by comparing the predicted results to both 3 D high-frequency structure simulator simulation results and measurement results taken in a semi-anechoic chamber.

40|$|International audienceFor {{a company}} like Electricity De France (EDF), being able to detect {{accurately}} using non-destructive methods {{the position of the}} buried junction between two underground cables is a crucial issue. The junction is the linking part where most maintenance operations are carried out. The challenge of this work is to conduct a feasibility study to confirm or deny the relevance of Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) to detect these buried junctions in their actual environment against clutter. Indeed, the cables are buried in inhomogeneous medium at around 80 cm deep. To do this, the study is conducted in a numerical environment. We use the 3 D simulation software CST MWS to model a GPR scenario. In this simulation, we place the already optimized bowtie antennas operating in thefrequency band [0. 5 GHz – 3 GHz] in front of wet soil (dispersive) and dry soil where the underground cable is placed at 80 cm deep. We collect the amplitude and phase of the reflected waves in order to detect the contrast provoked by the geometric dimensions variation of the cable [1] (diameter of the cable is 48 mm and the diameter of the junction 74 mm). The use of an ultra-wideband antenna is necessary to reconcile resolution and penetration of electromagnetic waves in the medium to be characterized. We focus on the performance of the GPR method according to the characteristics of the surrounding medium in which the electric cables are buried, the polarization of the Tx and Rx antennas. The experimental measurement collected in the EDF site will be presented. The measured data are processed using the clutter reduction method based on digital filtering [2]. We aim at showing that using the developed bowtieantennas that the GPR technique is well adapted for the <b>cable</b> <b>junction</b> localization even in cluttered environment. References[1] D. J.

The first part describes connecting conditions of small sources to distribution system, including administrative requirements, feasibility study, and requirements {{to the energy}} meters, measuring, control devices, switching devices and protection. The second part is aimed to describe problems of the photovoltaic system. Solar radiation generating and reducing of its intensity incident upon the earth surface are described in this part. The quantum of produced electric power depends on climatic conditions in the fixed area, seasons, etc. This work also discusses the types of photovoltaic cells and their actual efficiency. Inverters are further important components of the photovoltaic system. The parameters of the inverters have a great influence on the total actual efficiency of the photovoltaic system. Different methods of the photovoltaic panels’ connection with the inverters and their advantages and disadvantages are also mentioned. The supporting structure of the photovoltaic panels and eventually transformer are further important components of photovoltaic system. The work also analyze the methods of connection of the photovoltaic power station to distributive low voltage and medium voltage network, electric energy accumulation and possibilities of the sale of produced electric energy. The large number of the connected photovoltaic power stations has negative influences to electric network. The third part contains {{the design of a}} photovoltaic power plant with a capacity of 516, 24 kWp on the scoped area in southern Bohemia. The project documentation for the location where the power plant is designed is also made. It contains the design of photovoltaic panels, the design of the inverters to get an optimal power load. This part also contains a calculation of the photovoltaic system losses and the design of transformer and the <b>cable</b> <b>junction</b> calculation of the distributive system. The feasibility study of the power plant connected to distributive system is also conducted. Its delivery rate will be connected to the distribution point Řípov (110 / 22 kV). The calculation results show us that this photovoltaic power plant can be linked to the distribution system. The final part of this paper contains an economic estimate of the photovoltaic power plant operating and the calculation of the return. An Economic return is influenced by the wide range of values that affect the total return rate. The calculation of an operating economy is made for several variants.

40|$|In {{a process}} monitoring/control {{applications}} tens {{to thousands of}} sensors are used for monitoring system parameters. To achieve overall system goals, their reliable performance is critical. Generally a sensor’s output signal is too small or too noisy {{and may not be}} compatible with the input requirements of a Data Acquisition System. The sensor is interfaced to Data Acquisition System, through <b>cabling,</b> <b>junction</b> boxes and Interface Electronics like excitation circuitry, multiplexers, signal-conditioning circuitry etc. An interface or signal conditioning circuit does impedance matching, filtering, multiplexing, pre-amplification, amplification and digitization to make the sensor’s output signal compatible with the Data Acquisition System. Conventional Signal Conditioning includes Multiplexers, Anti aliasing filters, Operational Amplifier, Instrumentation Amplifiers, Isolation Amplifiers and Charge Preamplifiers etc. Operational Amplifiers e. g. voltage followers with High input impedance and low output impedance are used for impedance matching between the sensor and processing electronics. Anti aliasing filters remove noise from the sensor’s output signal. Normally the sensor is located away from the processing electronics and data is transmitted through wires/cables. During transmission, interference from external fields’ especially strong Audio Frequency, Radio Frequency and 50 Hz power line fields affects the sensor’s output signal. To minimize the effect of external field twisted pair shielded cables are used. Amplifiers with Differential input configuration are used to suppress the effect of interfering signals. Differential input Instrumentation Amplifiers with High input impedance, high CMRR; are most widely employed. Isolation Amplifiers isolate the input and output circuits by an extremely high impedance. Galvanic, optical isolations are most common. The conditioned data is transmitted to Data Acquisition System (DAS) and at the DAS the signal is multiplexed, filtered and digitized using Analog to Digital Converters (ADCs), followed by Digital Filtering and processing. For Control applications, the processed data is converted back to analog form using Digital to Analog Converters (DACs) for interfacing to external world. The transmission distance varies from tens of centimeters to few meters. Depending upon the distance twisted pair cables, IR transmission and Optical transmission is employed. During transmission, the data is prone to interferences from EMI, EMC, Noise and Signal to Noise ratio (SNR) degradation with distance. This affects the reliability of the system and increases the overall system cost. To eliminate the effects due to the environmental disturbances during transmission and to maintain signal integrity, it is preferred to have a unique and compact solution for each sensor where signal conditioning (excitation, filtering, amplification, compensation and digitization) is carried out and digital data can be transmitted to Data Acquisition System. Here each sensor has its own signal conditioning module. Directly interfacing sensors with micro controller yields simple and compact design solutions. Direct Sensor interface Technology (DSiT) is one {{of the state of the}} art technologies for sensor interfaces where an unconditioned, uncompensated, raw output signals from sensors are interfaced directly to a single-chip solution. The sensors’ output are multiplexed using Multiplexer; Amplified using Programmable Gain Amplifier (PGA), digitized using ADC, filtered using Digital Filters and transmitted using Digital Interfaces (SPI, I 2 C, UART) in a single chip. DSiT scheme incorporates all the elements necessary in an instrumentation system creating a balanced combination of features, to create truly intelligent sensor systems. The sensors are interfaced directly to a single DSiT chip, without any additional circuitry and the direct digital data transmission is achieved with the help of Digital Interfaces SPI, UART, SMBus/I 2 C. As this involves onchip signal conditioning and digital data transmission, expenditure on additional signal conditioning circuitry, analog interfaces for analog data transmission, separate Analog to Digital Converter for each sensor is reduced. This reduces the overall system cost and as the count of discrete components is reduced the system reliability is improved. In addition, as the data is transmitted digitally the effects of noise, S/N degradation and electromagnetic interferences are eliminated. The accuracy level achieved is sufficiently good for monitoring and control applications. In Launch Vehicles/Satellites number of sensors are used for performance evaluation, monitoring and control purposes. Harnessing, signal conditioning of the sensors’ output and onboard processing of the sensor data is carried out individually for each sensor. Implementation of the DSiT system will reduce the total weight of the launch vehicles and satellites, resulting in reduced overall system cost, increased reliability and reduced onboard processing overhead. In addition, the reduction in weight allows incorporation of larger payloads/ more propellant loading in payloads which increases the life of the Satellites. As it is compact, it can be readily used for facility parameter measurements during the ground testing of liquid engines and stages at LPSC/ISRO. Implementation of DSiT for facility parameter measurements will reduce the cabling cost and improve the reliability of the chain...|$|R
