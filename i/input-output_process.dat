This idea could be applied to multi-qubit gates on photonic qubits and we give the quantum circuit for a three-photon Toffoli gate. High fidelities and high efficiencies could be achieved when the side leakage to the cavity loss rate is low. It is worth pointing out that our devices work in both the strong and the weak coupling regimes. Comment: 13 pages, 5 figure...|$|R

Although many networks, such as multi-layer feedforward {{neural networks}} (MFNs), provide excellent capability in function fittings, very often, they {{are referred to}} as black-box models. In this study, a multivariate ANN procedure, entitled SOLO (Self-Organizing Linear Output mapping network) is introduced. This model architecture has been designed for rapid estimation of network structure/parameters and system outputs. Furthermore, the SOLO provides features that facilitate insight to the <b>input-output</b> <b>processes,</b> thereby extending its usefulness as a tool for investigations into the underlying processes through the data classification processes.

Through the auxiliary single photons <b>input-output</b> <b>process</b> in cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED), the concurrence of the atomic entanglement can be obtained according to the success probability of picking up the singlet states of the atoms. This protocol has three advantages: First, we do not require the sophisticated controlled-not (CNOT) gates. Second, the distributed atoms {{are not required to}} intact with each other. Third, the atomic entanglement can be distributed nonlocally, which provides its important applications in distributed quantum computation. Comment: 5 pages, 3 figure...|$|E

We show that, even with the practical imperfections such as atomic spontaneous emission, weak atom-cavity coupling, violation of the Lamb-Dicke condition, cavity photon loss, and detection inefficiency, the proposed gate is feasible for generation of a cluster state in that it meets the scalability criterion and it operates in a conclusive manner.

40|$|We propose two {{alternative}} entanglement concentration protocols (ECPs) {{using the}} Faraday rotation of photonic polarization. Through the single-photon <b>input-output</b> <b>process</b> in cavity QED, it is {{shown that the}} maximally entangled atomic (photonic) state can be extracted from two partially entangled states. The distinct feature of our protocols {{is that we can}} concentrate both atomic and photonic entangled states via photonic Faraday rotation, and thus they may be universal and useful for entanglement concentration in the experiment. Furthermore, as photonic Faraday rotation works in low-$Q$ cavities and only involves virtual excitation of atoms, our ECPs are insensitive to both cavity decay and atomic spontaneous emission.

In this letter, we propose the use of data envelopment analysis (DEA) to define multidimensional yields that can capture the multidimensional nature of cell <b>input-output</b> <b>processes.</b> The DEA, by treating cells as decision-making units, enables one to introduce the concept of efficiency frontier that is both intimately connected to the shadow prices of flux balance analysis and useful to estimate the phenotypic phase space from experimental measurements of fluxes...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A {{stationary}} {{theory of}} quantum stochastic processes of second order is outlined. It includes KMS processes in wide sense like the equilibrium finite temperature quantum noise {{given by the}} Planck’s spectral formula. It is shown that for each stationary noise there exists a natural output process which {{is identical to the}} noise in the infinite temperature limit, and flipping with the noise if the time is reversed at finite temperature. A canonical Hilbert space representation of the quantum noise and the fundamental output process is established and a decomposition of their spectra is found. A brief explanation of quantum stochastic integration with respect to the <b>input-output</b> <b>processes</b> is given using only correlation functions. This provides a mathematical foundation for linear stationary filtering transformations of quantum stochastic processes. It is proved that the colored quantum stationary noise and its time-reversed version can be obtained in the second order theory by a linear nonadapted filtering of the standard vacuum noise uniquely defined by the canonical creation and annihilation operators on the spectrum of the input-output pair. 1...|$|R

40|$|The article {{draws on}} {{qualitative}} educational research across {{a diversity of}} low-income countries to examine the gendered inequalities in education as complex, multi-faceted and situated rather than a series of barriers to be overcome through linear <b>input–output</b> <b>processes</b> focused on isolated dimensions of quality. It argues that frameworks for thinking about educational quality often result in analyses of gender inequalities that are fragmented and incomplete. However, by considering education quality more broadly as a terrain of quality it investigates questions of educational transitions, teacher supply and community participation, and develops understandings of how education is experienced by learners and teachers in their gendered lives and their teaching practices. By taking an approach based on theories of human development the article identifies dynamics of power underpinning gender inequalities in the literature and played out in diverse contexts and influenced by social, cultural and historical contexts. The review and discussion indicate that attaining gender equitable quality education requires recognition {{and understanding of the}} ways in which inequalities intersect and interrelate in order to seek out multi-faceted strategies that address not only different dimensions of girls’ and women’s lives, but understand gendered relationships and structurally entrenched inequalities between women and men, girls and boys...|$|R

40|$|During dynamic {{voluntary}} movements, {{power in}} the α-and β-bands resulting from synchronized neuronal activity is modulated {{in a manner that}} is time-locked to movement onset. These signals can be readily recorded from the scalp surface using electroencephalography. Abnormalities in the magnitude and timing of these oscillations are present in a wide variety of movement disorders including Parkinson’s disease and dystonia. Most studies have examined movement-related oscillations in the context of single discrete movements, yet marked impairments are often seen during the performance of repetitive movements. For this reason, there is considerable need for analysis methods that can resolve the modulation of these oscillations in both the frequency and time domains. Presently, there is little consensus on which is the most appropriate method for this purpose. In this paper, a comparison of commonly used time-frequency methods is presented for the analysis of movement-related {{power in the}} α-and β-bands during repetitive movements. The same principles hold, however, for any form of repetitive or rhythmic <b>input-output</b> <b>processes</b> in the brain. In particular, methods based on band-pass filtering, the short-time Fourier transform (STFT), continuous wavelet transform and reduced interference distributions are discussed. The relative merits and limitations in terms of spectral or temporal resolution of each method are shown with the use of simulated and experimental data. It is shown that the STFT provides the best compromise between spectral and temporal resolution and thus is the most appropriate approach for the analysis and interpretation of repetitive movement-related oscillations in health and disease.
