40|$|The {{aim was to}} {{evaluate}} the reproductive performance of the dairy herd. Data were obtained on the farm ZZN Strakonice center Sousedovice from cows culled during 2015. The center treats an average of 250 cows that are kept free of manure and farm milked at four milking robots Lely - Astronaut. The most important reproduction traits were summarized and subsequently statistically processed. Monitored were fertility parameters, milk yield and lifetime production, which were derived from a zootechnical records and monthly reports from milk recording system on 100 dairy cows. With increasing milk yields were deteriorating reproduction parameters such as artificial <b>insemination</b> <b>index,</b> insemination interval and number of days open. For the entire group of cows was monitored milk productivity and reproduction parameters related to parity. The average milk yield in the selected cows was 8579 kg of milk per lactation. With parity increased milk yield per lactation. As well as the average daily milk production and average milk production per day of calving interval. <b>Insemination</b> <b>index</b> and days open length were significantly longer for 2 nd lactation where a large increase in milk yield negatively affected these parameters. Furthermore, we evaluated the lifetime milk production. The highest average yield per lactation reached cows cullet later than on 4 th lactation. In these cows was detected milk production per lactation for 1000 kg higher than in cows that finished only 2 or 3 lactations. The lowest average yield per lactation was in cows that finished only two lactation. Furthermore, cows were evaluated according to the lactation curve. It was found that with increasing lactation persistence increases milk production but deteriorate the reproduction traits as a days open, insemination interval and <b>insemination</b> <b>index.</b> It was also found that with increasing lactation persistence decreases the longevity.

The application of ultrasound in daily practice enables precise detection of follicles ability for ovulation and identification of functional corpus lutei, early diagnose of pregnancy, determination of foetal sex {{as well as an}} early and accurate identification of pathological processes (metritis, endometritis and pyometra). This survey included 54 cows: experimental group consist of 32 animals (26 of Simmental and 6 of Holstein-Friesian breed) that were under continuous control of the veterinarian (routine gynaecological and ultrasound examination), while remaining 22 animals in the barn (12 Simmental and 10 Holstein-Friesian cows) served as a control group – inseminated only at the invitation of the owner. <b>Insemination</b> <b>index</b> (1. 69) and duration of service period (82. 27 days) in the experimental group of Simmental cows were significantly lower (P< 0. 001) than in the control group (3. 25 and 155. 17 days, respectively).

Correlation coefficients were computed between the HI and the differences (black boar minus white boar) in several in vitro tests of seminal quality before and after cryopreservation of the semen. For the in vitro tests before cryopreservation, the HI were negatively correlated (- 0. 57, P 0. 05) with the differences in spermatozoan motility after cooling to 5 (DEGREES) C. The HI were not correlated (P 3 ̆e 0. 05) with the differences in the following in vitro tests after freezing and thawing: spermatozoa with normal apical ridges, damaged apical ridges, and loose acrosomal caps, extracellular and maximum releasable glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT), and the number of penetrations per zona-free hamster oocyte. The HI were correlated (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) with the differences in the following in vitro tests after freezing and thawing: spermatozoan motility (0. 50), spermatozoa with either normal or damaged apical ridges (0. 31), spermatozoa with missing apical ridges (- 0. 51), spermatozoa filtered through sephadex columns (0. 32), spermatozoa with acrosin-activity (0. 38), percentage of maximum releasable GOT (0. 54), spermatozoan intracellular GOT (- 0. 57), spermatozoa bound per zona-free hamster oocyte (0. 64) and, percentage of zona-free hamster oocytes penetrated (0. 75).

40|$|Cattle {{breeding}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} demanding branches of the agricultural production. Prerequisite for successful breeding is the economical effective milk production which only be achieved with good health of animals, good fertility, adequate replacement herd, longevity of cows and appropriate management. Breeders must always think about the way of the keeping and about the breed of the animals. This thesis aims to evaluate selected indicators of milk and meat production, fertility, longevity and economy of the milk production in the dairy herd of Holstein and Czech Pied cattle in the same stalling and at the same nutrition in the company VOD Kámen. It was chosen sixty Holstein and sixty Czech Pied breeding dams from the herd for monitoring. Monitored groups of cows were sorted out according to the genotype, origin of father and the order of lactation. The reproductive performance were used to evaluate (insemination interval, service period, meantime, <b>insemination</b> <b>index),</b> indicators of milk yield (amount of milk in kilograms, fat content, protein content), longevity and the reasons for decommissioning of cows. To evaluate meat yield twenty-five Holstein and twenty-five Czech Pied bulls were chosen. Differences of milk yield and fertility among both breeds were evaluated as very important (P < 0, 001). Reproductive performance of Holstein cows was evaluated as inconvenient (insemination interval 82, 06 days, service period 135, 87 days, meantime 412 days and <b>insemination</b> <b>index</b> 2, 4), and of Czech Pied cows as convenient (insemination interval 64, 8 days, service period 98, 84 days and <b>insemination</b> <b>index</b> 2, 0). The milk yield was higher the Czech average in both breeds. Holstein cows producted 9 123 kilograms of milk for lactation with 3, 87 % of fat and 3, 42 % of proteins; the Czech Pied cows producted 8100 kilograms of milk with 4, 08 % of fat and 3, 59 % of proteins. The most common reason for removal of cows was fertility disturbance. Indicators of meat yield were better for the Czech Pied bulls.

40|$|Cow {{fertility}} {{depends on}} many factors, {{the most important}} of which are diet, maintenance, upkeep conditions, and technical-technological conditions of production in cattle breeding. If we accept this as correct, and it is, then the question appears, under the same conditions of diet, upkeep, and the technological production process, why some cows conceive and yield a calf each year, while others remain barren, even though the level of milk production per cow is approximately the same. An answer to this question would help resolve the problem of cow sterility. The paper shows the results of insemination of cows in spontaneous or induced oestrus following the administration of one or two injections of prostaglandin. Conception results in spontaneous oestrus following the first insemination were 43. 4 %(33 / 76), after the second 23. 7 %(18 / 76), after the third 11. 8 % (9 / 76), and after the fourth and all subsequent 21. 1 % (16 / 76) with an <b>insemination</b> <b>index</b> of 2. 3.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{investigate}} the impact of two energy supplements based on propylene glycol in dairy cows diet on ovarian and follicular morphology, conception, <b>insemination</b> <b>index</b> and length of service period. A total number of 60 Holstein Friesian dairy cows, parity between 2 - 8, with an average milk production of 7000 kg/ 305 days of lactation were divided into three experimental groups (20 dairy cows per group). The first group of dairy cows was supplemented daily with "Energy-plus" (O 1 group; 200 mL propylene-glycol supplement) and the second group was supplemented with "Ketal" (O 2 group; 160 mL propylene-glycol supplement), two weeks before partus until 30 days post partum. The third experimental group were non supplemented dairy cows (O 3, control group). Ultrasound examination of the reproductive system using real time echo camera Falco VET 100 (ESAOTE PieMedical, Holland, B-shaped scan with linear-array endorectal 5 - 8 MHz probe) was conducted on every animal starting from day 40 postpartum. The diameters of the ovaries (left and right) and of the dominant follicle(s) were recorded. Ultrasound testing was repeated on day 50 and 60 postpartum only in cows which in the meantime were not inseminated. Reproduction efficiency parameters (conception rate, number of inseminations and length of service period) were recorded individually. The statistical significance of the differences between groups was tested using ANOVA with LSD test at the level of significance p< 0. 05, chi-square test and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis (the length of service period). There was no significant impact of the propylene glycol supplementation on the ovarian and follicular morphology at the first ultrasound examination. At the second ultrasound examination {{there was a significant difference}} between left ovarian dominant follicle diameter in the control and supplemented dairy cows (1. 67 ± 0. 53 vs 1. 12 ± 0. 29 and 1. 11 ± 0. 35 cm, p< 0. 05, O 3 vs O 1 and O 2, respectively). The cumulative percentage of conception after the first and second insemination was 60 %, 81 % and 25 % in groups O 1, O 2 and O 3, respectively (p< 0. 05, chi-square test). The <b>insemination</b> <b>index</b> was lowest in group O 2 and statistically significant differences were found between groups O 2 and O 3 (1. 69 ± 0. 79 : 3. 38 ± 1. 36, respectively, p< 0, 05).

40|$|The aim of {{the work}} was to {{elaborate}} a literary review of the characteristics, reproductive properties of Holstein cattle and influences affecting the reproduction of cattle. Another objective of the work was to evaluate the selected influences on their reproduction {{in a group of}} selected dairy cows from the monitored cattle herd. The data were processed and sorted by genotype, level of milk performance, parity, length of dry period, length of insemination interval, difficulty of calving, age of the first calving and synchronization of estrous (Ovsynch). In evaluating the effect of the genotype on reproductive parameters, there were no statistically significant differences between purebred Holstein cows (H 100) and crosses (H 50 - 88 C). In addition, the effect of milk yield on lactation on reproductive performance was evaluated. The results showed that with increasing performance, the values of reproduction indicators (<b>insemination</b> <b>index,</b> insemination interval and period service) have increased. The statistically lowest <b>insemination</b> <b>index</b> (1. 70) and insemination interval (96 days) were detected in cows with a yield up to 8, 000 kg. The service period (122 days) was conclusively the lowest in a cow group with a yield of 8, 001 to 10, 000 kg lactating milk. In contrast, the highest conclusive values of the <b>insemination</b> <b>index,</b> interval and period service were detected in a group of dairy cows with a yield above 12, 001 kg of milk. It is further evident from the results that the values of the pregnancy rate after the first insemination increased with the increasing level of milk performance. The lowest value (27. 14 %) was detected in the group with the highest milk yield (over 12, 001 kg of milk). There {{were no significant differences between}} the different groups of dairy cows in the evaluation of the influence of parity on the reproduction indicators. Furthermore, the influence of length of dry period was evaluated. The average dry period in the monitored herd was 69 days. The pregnancy rate after the first insemination was better for the group with a dry period over 61 days (40. 38 %). On the other hand, periods of service and days open values were lower in dairy cows with a dry period less than 60 days (119 and 394 days respectively). The length of uterine involution was also monitored by the length of insemination interval. Most cows in the monitored group of dairy cows (25. 29 %) were first inseminated 66 th - 87 th day after calving. No statistically significant differences were detected in the assessment of the age of the 1 st calving and the severity of births on reproductive parameters.

The first part deals with dairy cattle breed characteristic, main objectives and ecological agriculture principals, welfare problems, breed cattle and utility control, housing technology, nutrition and feeding, mechanical milking technology, milk production, reproduction, health condition and breeding economy. The practical part contains the rating of milk yield index (milk production, % proteins, % fat) and reproduction index (meantime, perioda service, <b>insemination</b> <b>index</b> and after first parturition percentage). 650 pieces of cos were stabled at farm, from that 200 pices of dairy cos were mostly czech fleckvieh. Monitoring was made in 2013. Dayily milk production was around 2 750 kg. The milk utility for lactacion was in 2013 6 100 kg of milk, 3, 89 % fat and 3, 34 % proteins. The dairy cos were free stabled with high bedding, They were mechanically milked twice a day in herringbone parlours. Milk is being delivered once in twodays to Olma dairy. Cows are regularly driven out to pasture in summer feeding period. They are extra fed with 10 kg of clover silage and 6 kg of scarp (barely, wheat, triticale). Cows stays in stables for winter time. The ration consists of 45 kg of clover silage, 6 kg of scarp, 2 kg of lupine and 1 kg of corn in first time of lactacion. The cow utility in transitional form of economy at farm Bilcice was 7 477 kg of milk in 2010, a value in the Czech Republic was 7 726 kg of milk. After entering the ecological agriculture in 2013 milk yield at the farm decreased on 6 100 kg of milk and the average value in the Czech Republic increased to 8 370 kg of milk. The cow utility in transitional form was 4, 03 % fat in 2010 and 3, 89 % in 2013 (ecological agriculture). A diference between 2010 and 2013 is 0, 14 %.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to examine the effect of dietary energy supplementation on hormones that are considered to be the main signals of a shift in energy balance around parturition. Sixty dry cows, 15 days before calving, were chosen and divided into two eaqual groups: control and experimental (GLY). Both groups were fed a standard ration balanced in accordance to the stage of the productivereproductive cycle. Additionally, each cow in the GLY group was given glycerol based dietary energy supplementation (250 mL daily during the dry and 300 mL daily during the lactation period), which provided additional 9. 30 MJ NEL during the dry and 13. 95 MJ NEL during the early lactation period. Milk production was measured on days 30 and 60 of lactation and milk production was significantly higher in GLY compared to control group at day 60 of lactation (p< 0. 05). Service period and <b>insemination</b> <b>index</b> were used as reproductive outcome parameters. Average service period in the control group was significantly longer than in the GLY group (p< 0. 05). Average <b>insemination</b> <b>index</b> in the control group was not significantly different than the index obtained for the GLY group. Blood samples were taken before the begining of the experiment (15 days before parturition), and at days 7, 30 and 60 of lactation. Concentrations of thyroid hormones, IGF-I, relative abundance of IGFBP- 2, IGFBP- 3 and IGFBP- 4, concentrations of total protein and albumin in the blood were measured. Results showed that at days 7 and 30 after parturition, T 4 concentrations were significantly higher (p< 0. 001, respectively) in GLY than in the control group, while T 3 concentrations were significantly higher in GLY group only at day 7 after parturition (p< 0. 001). IGF-I concentrations and IGFBP- 3 abundance were significantly higher in the GLY compared to the control group in all three examined postpartum periods. IGFBP- 2 and IGFBP- 4 concentrations were higher in GLY compared to the control group in all three examined postpartum periods, but the difference was significant only on day 60 after parturition (p< 0. 01, respectively). Concentrations of total protein and albumin were significantly higher in GLY compared to the control group in all three examined periods after parturition. Based on these results it can be concluded that peripartum dietary energy supplementation prevent cows' exposure to severe negative energy balance, preserves synthetic activity of hepatocytes and consequently has a positive impact on milk production and reproductive performances in dairy cows...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to confirm that a {{negative}} energy balance expressed by declining body condition score (BCS) can lead to the deterioration of fertility results of Czech Fleckvieh cows. The BCS of cows was evaluated before calving and during the first five weeks of lactation. The evaluation was based on 338 Czech Fleckvieh cows calved between the October 13 th, 2009 and April 27 th, 2010 at one dairy farm. Analysis of relationships between the energy balance results and fertility score expressed by the reproduction results (pregnancy rate after the first and all inseminations, the insemination interval, service period, <b>insemination</b> <b>index,</b> calving period) of the observed group were performed. The higher body condition score of the Czech Fleckvieh cows before calving turned out advantageously regarding the energy source during the postpartal period. No negative effect of higher BCS in cows before calving was confirmed. The best reproduction parameters were attained in the group of cows with no change or marked increase of body condition after calving recorded. However, statistically significant differences between the groups were detected only in the third week of lactation.

40|$|Abstract: High {{milk yield}} {{characteristics}} with insufficient emphasis on traits relating to health in dairy cows {{increases the risk}} of suffering from reproductive problems, which represent one of the welfare indicators. This paper considers the most common problems of reproduction in large capacity dairy farms in Serbia in the light of their effects on the welfare of cows. Data on reproduction parameters, prepartal and postpartal reproductive disorders in total 3865 Holstein-Friesian cows held in tied system were collected. Rearing conditions in all farms were similar regarding housing and nutrition, and differences existed in some management procedures. Results pointed on prolonged intercalving period, interval from calving to the first artificial insemination, and extended service period (average values: 15. 6 month, 98. 46 days and 180. 94 days, respectively), and increased <b>insemination</b> <b>index</b> (2. 65). The most frequent reproductive disorders were ovarian hypofunction, insuficiencia corpora lutea and endometritis (31. 18 %, 17. 54 % and 14. 31 %, respectively). Due to reproductive disorders 7. 6 % of cows were culled. Condition on the farms in respect to the reproduction is commonly related to the intensive production and tied system. Risk related to the occurrence of reproductive problems is multifactorial, and associated with the housing conditions, nutrition, management and selection. Even in the tied system, improvement is possible by implementation of measures for enhancement of cows ‘ health and welfare in general, i. e. by introduction of certain changes in the rearing technology.

40|$|The general aim of {{the present}} work was to compare dairy {{performance}} and some reproductive parameters of Holstein-Friesian (HF) cows imported from Sweden as an in-calf heifers, and their age mates in Poland. The animals were kept freely on the deep litter on the farm owned by Agro-company “Witkowo” and feeding was based on TMR (total mixed ration) system during whole year. All ration’s ingredients (bulky feed, concentrate, miscellaneous additives) were mixed and fed as all-mash. The feed ration depended from the physiological condition of a cow and it was composed of corn and grass ensilage, mash concentrate, crushed corn meal, brewer’s grains and beet pulp. Cows imported from Sweden as in-calf heifers obtained higher milk, fat and protein yield in both lactations comparing to home cows. Significant statistical differences were observed for kg of milk, kg of protein, for FCM (P< 0. 01) and for kg of fat (P< 0. 05) in 2 nd lactation. Fat and protein content in milk was in average higher for home cows (P< 0. 01).

Constant downward trend of important reproduction indicators, often reaching critical values, is becoming main problem of many agricultural plants aligned to beef-raising. The higher attention to beef-raising is needed {{especially in the}} foothill areas and in regions with harder conditions (LFA areas). Beef-raising is not aimed to fulfil only a production, it also stands for unsubstituable reproduction functions. The aim of this thesis is to evaluate reproduction indicators in three different breedings in the five year range 2002 - 2006 (such as insemination interval, intersemination interval, servis cycle, <b>insemination</b> <b>index,</b> parturition interval and pregnancy percentage after first insemination) on the chosen dairycows. According the level the individual breedings were compared (Rychnov nad Malsi, Vlci Jamy, Tesov) testing the CESTR runt.

Regarding the uterine repose we notice that there were no significantly differences between the two breeds for the cows with normal uterine involution, 114. 00 ± 8. 80 days for German Spotted and 126. 79 ± 12. 86 days for Frizz Holstein. For the cows with puerperal infections we notice very significant differences, 128. 58 ± 10. 16 days for German Spotted and 184. 27 ± 12. 68 days for Frizz Holstein. Regarding the number of insemination/gestation {{there were no significant differences}} between the cows with normal calving. In this way, the index/gestation was 1. 45 ± 0. 11 for German Spotted and 1. 57 ± 0. 17 for Frizz Holstein.

40|$|Abstract Background The aim of {{this study}} was to detect the {{associations}} between bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV- 1) status of a herd and respiratory disease (BRD) occurrence and reproductive performance in pregnant heifers and cows. The association between management-related factors and higher BRD occurrence was also estimated. Methods Serum samples, collected from cows and youngstock from 103 dairy cattle herds, were analyzed for antibodies against BHV- 1, bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV), and Mycoplasma bovis. A questionnaire was used to collect data concerning herd management factors and reproductive performance, as well as the occurrence of clinical signs of respiratory disease in the last two years, as evaluated by the veterinarian or farm manager. Multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) and logistic regression analysis were performed to identify and quantify the risk factors. Results A low to moderate prevalence (1 - 49 %) of BRSV antibodies among youngstock was associated with a high occurrence of respiratory disease (OR = 6. 2, p = 0. 010) in cows and in-calf heifers. Employees of the farm may participate in the spread of such disease. Larger herd size, loose-housing of cows, housing youngstock separately from cows until pregnancy, and purchasing new animals were factors possibly related to a high occurrence of respiratory disease symptoms in pregnant heifers and cows. The highest risk of abortions (> 1. 3 %) and increased <b>insemination</b> <b>index</b> (number of inseminations per pregnancy) (> 1. 9) occurred in herds with a moderate prevalence of BHV- 1 antibodies (1 - 49 %) in cows.

40|$|Introduction: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the relationship between body condition score (BCS) determined on the dry-off day, calving day, and in the first month of lactation, its changes during the dry period and early lactation, and periparturient indices and fertility in high-producing dairy cows. Material and Methods: The experiment was conducted in two herds: A and B, located in Western Poland. The studies were conducted on 116 and 108 Polish Holstein-Friesian dairy cows respectively, with an average milk yield of > 10 000 kg/ 305 -day lactation. The experiment included the dry period (- 56 d to the calving day), the calving day, and early lactation (from + 1 to + 56 d). The experimental factor was BCS (0 to 5 -point scale). The BCS was performed by one person on day - 56, on parturition day (in the first 12 h after calving) and on day 30 of lactation. Results: A decrease in BCS (≥- 0. 25) in herd A during the dry period accelerated the planned calving period by 7. 3 d. In the group of cows with BCS 3. 50 in the first month of lactation (30 d) resulted in the extension of uterine involution period (56 d). Improvement of BCS during the dry period shortened the anoestrus (60 d) in herd A and the period of insemination service (60 d) in herd B. However, in this group (IM BCS ≥ 0. 25) of cows the day of the highest artificial <b>insemination</b> <b>index</b> (2. 50) in herd B was analysed.

There were these indicators of reproduction processed: conception rate after first insemination, conception rate after all inseminations, interval of <b>insemination,</b> <b>index</b> of insemination, service period and meantime; the data were collected from seven stables of Bohemian Spotted cattle and from seven stables of Holstein cattle. The longevity was investigated from the number of dairy cows at respective lactation of both investigated breeds and from the average lactation in respective years. The results of investigation prove that the average percentage representation of dairy cow at respective lactation between 2012 - 2015 ranged 33, 4 % at first lactation, and 24, 68 % at second lactation, and 18, 13 % at third lactation, and 11, 48 % at fourth lactation, and 6, 53 % at fifth lactation, and 3, 32 % at sixth lactation, and 2, 36 % at seventh and more lactations. The evident data from comparison prove, that till third lactation there is higher percentage representation of Holstein cattle and from third lactation there are more cows of Bohemian Spotted cattle, and also the average reached lactation confirms this the value of 2, 75 lactation for Bohemian Spotted cattle and the value of 2, 3 lactation for Holstein cattle. The influence of breed on the average length of lactation was quite weak.
