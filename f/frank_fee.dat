He had taken those 18 wickets for just 140 runs. Admittedly Glenn's feat was achieved against teams weakened by the loss of their international players, but the amazingly small cost of these wickets makes it still a very special feat. The Mashonaland batsmen in particular were quite unable to handle him effectively when his swing was combined with immaculate line and length.|$|E
