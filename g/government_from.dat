5|$|Godwin is {{generally}} regarded as {{the founder of the}} school of thought known as 'philosophical anarchism'.

Although he did not accord the state with moral legitimacy, he was against the use of revolutionary tactics for removing the <b>government</b> <b>from</b> power. Rather, he advocated for its replacement through a process of peaceful evolution.|$|E
