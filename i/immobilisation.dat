5|$|Treatment {{is based}} on the {{severity}} of poisoning from the bite; the majority of cases do not require medical care, and patients with localised pain, swelling and redness usually only require local application of ice and simple oral analgesia such as paracetamol. Pressure <b>immobilisation</b> of the wound site is not recommended. Keeping the victim still and calm is beneficial.|$|E
5|$|Razer's next {{appearance}} {{came in a}} Robot Wars Christmas special {{called the}} Southern Annihilator. Six robots fought {{at the same time}} until one was eliminated, either through <b>immobilisation</b> or judges' decision. The remaining five robots then fought again, eliminating another, and so on until one robot remained and was declared the winner. Razer outlasted Vercingetorix, SpawnofScutter, Behemoth and AttilatheDrum to set up a final against Onslaught. An attack by Razer's arm on one of Onslaught's rear wheels saw its adversary shed a tyre, lose grip, and drive into an area patrolled by Matilda. The house robot flipped Onslaught onto its side, rendering it immobile. Assured of victory, Razer attacked and badly damaged Matilda's bodywork and rear shell.|$|E
5|$|This {{iteration}} of Razer {{competed in}} the second series of Robot Wars, successfully passing the Gauntlet and Trials stages of its heat before being defeated in battle by a robot called Inquisitor. The cause of Razer's <b>immobilisation</b> in this fight was the shearing of nylon cush drives—cushioning blocks designed to prevent stress fractures—in the machine's drive wheels; these were replaced with more robust metal ones for future competitions. As the Robot Wars television series evolved and grew, Razer's design was revised and refined to counter weaknesses {{and take advantage of}} rule changes; by series four, Lewis estimated that Razer had taken 1,500 hours to build, at a cost of £1,600.|$|E
25|$|In typical natural {{conditions}} normalized corrosion rates of silicate glasses are very low and {{are of the}} order of 10−7–10−5 g/(cm2·d). The very high durability of silicate glasses in water makes them suitable for hazardous and nuclear waste <b>immobilisation.</b>|$|E
25|$|It {{is often}} {{necessary}} {{not only to}} communicate parking restrictions, but also to have available a workable deterrent. The deterrent can take physical forms such as vehicle <b>immobilisation</b> exemplified by the wheel clamp, and non-physical forms such as levying parking charges on the registered vehicle owners. Sometimes photography is used to record violations.|$|E
25|$|Synthetic organic {{materials}} including solvents, paints, pharmaceuticals, pesticides, products from coke production {{and so forth}} can {{be very difficult to}} treat. Treatment methods are often specific to the material being treated. Methods include advanced oxidation processing, distillation, adsorption, vitrification, incineration, chemical <b>immobilisation</b> or landfill disposal. Some materials such as some detergents may be capable of biological degradation and in such cases, a modified form of wastewater treatment can be used.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time, chemokines {{released}} by macrophages activate the rolling leukocytes and cause surface integrin molecules {{to switch from}} the default low-affinity state to a high-affinity state. This is assisted through juxtacrine activation of integrins by chemokines and soluble factors released by endothelial cells. In the activated state, integrins bind tightly to complementary receptors expressed on endothelial cells, with high affinity. This causes the <b>immobilisation</b> of the leukocytes, despite the sheer forces of the ongoing blood flow.|$|E
25|$|Fractures {{and their}} {{underlying}} causes can be investigated by X-rays, CT scans and MRIs. Fractures are described by their location and shape, and several classification systems exist, {{depending on the}} location of the fracture. A common long bone fracture in children is a Salter–Harris fracture. When fractures are managed, pain relief is often given, and the fractured area is often immobilised. This is to promote bone healing. In addition, surgical measures such as internal fixation may be used. Because of the <b>immobilisation,</b> people with fractures are often advised to undergo rehabilitation.|$|E
25|$|Surgical {{methods of}} {{treating}} fractures {{have their own}} risks and benefits, but usually surgery is performed only if conservative treatment has failed, is very likely to fail, or {{likely to result in}} a poor functional outcome. With some fractures such as hip fractures (usually caused by osteoporosis), surgery is offered routinely because non-operative treatment results in prolonged <b>immobilisation,</b> which commonly results in complications including chest infections, pressure sores, deconditioning, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and pulmonary embolism, which are more dangerous than surgery. When a joint surface is damaged by a fracture, surgery is also commonly recommended to make an accurate anatomical reduction and restore the smoothness of the joint.|$|E
25|$|Rare {{causes of}} {{hyperkalemia}} are discussed as follows. Acute digitalis overdose such as digoxin toxicity may cause hyperkalemia through the inhibition of sodium-potassium-ATPase pump. Massive blood transfusion can cause hyperkalemia in infants due to leakage of potassium {{out of the}} red blood cells during storage. Giving succinylcholine tn patients with conditions such as burns, trauma, infection, prolonged <b>immobilisation</b> can cause hyperkalemia due to widespread activation of acetylcholine receptors rather than a specific group of muscles. Arginine hydrochloride is used to treat refractory metabolic alkalosis. The arginine ions can enter cells and displace potassium out of the cells, causing hyperkalemia. Calcineurin inhibitors such as cyclosporine, tacrolimus, diazoxide, and minoxidil can cause hyperkalemia. Box jellyfish venom can also cause hyperkalemia.|$|E
25|$|Spiders are {{notified}} {{that potential}} prey {{has been caught}} in the web through vibrations along strands, these can be followed to the prey location on the web and be used to estimate prey size. Due to the large variety in prey Nephila has different attack techniques dependent on prey size. Small prey like flies are captured alive then removed from the web and wrapped in silk. This occurs with smaller prey because they do not present a threat to the spider when alive. Prey that is seen as potentially threatening will be bitten to be subdued before wrapping. Medium-sized prey will receive bites that are sustained until prey is immobilised and then be covered in silk. Finally, the largest captured prey receive the –bite and back off– treatment where a single lunging bite is made before the spider withdraws and waits for the venom to take effect before wrapping. This lunging bite is often repeated to speed up the process of <b>immobilisation.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{standard}} drop, which {{arrived as}} calculated in English units, involves {{a drop of}} between [...] and came into use from 1866, when the scientific details were published by an Irish doctor, Samuel Haughton. Its use rapidly spread to English-speaking countries and those where judicial systems had an English origin. It was considered a humane improvement on the short drop because {{it was intended to}} be enough to break the person's neck, causing immediate paralysis and <b>immobilisation</b> (and probable immediate unconsciousness). This method was used to execute condemned Nazis under United States jurisdiction after the Nuremberg Trials including Joachim von Ribbentrop and Ernst Kaltenbrunner. In the execution of Ribbentrop, historian Giles MacDonogh records that: [...] "The hangman botched the execution and the rope throttled the former foreign minister for twenty minutes before he expired." [...] A Life magazine report on the execution merely says: [...] "The trap fell open and with a sound midway between a rumble and a crash, Ribbentrop disappeared. The rope quivered for a time, then stood tautly straight." ...|$|E
2500|$|Unaided plant roots may {{be unable}} to take up {{nutrients}} that are chemically or physically immobilised; examples include phosphate ions and micronutrients such as iron. One form of such immobilization occurs in soil with high clay content, or soils with a strongly basic pH. The mycelium of the mycorrhizal fungus can, however, access many such nutrient sources, and make them available to the plants they colonize. Thus many plants are able to obtain phosphate, without using soil as a source. Another form of <b>immobilisation</b> is when nutrients are locked up in organic matter that is slow to decay, such as wood, and some mycorrhizal fungi act directly as decay organisms, mobilising the nutrients and passing some onto the host plants; for example, in some dystrophic forests, large amounts of phosphate and other nutrients are taken up by mycorrhizal hyphae acting directly on leaf litter, bypassing the need for soil uptake. [...] Inga alley cropping, proposed as an alternative to slash and burn rainforest destruction, relies upon mycorrhiza within the Inga Tree root system to prevent the rain from washing phosphorus out of the soil.|$|E

The experiment broke down--I can no longer stand the solitude and confinement, the <b>immobilisation,</b> of that contracted corner in these shortening and darkening weeks and months. These things have the worst effect upon me--and I fled to London pavements, lamplights, shopfronts, taxi's--and friends; amid all of which I have recovered my equilibrium excellently, and shall do so still more.
