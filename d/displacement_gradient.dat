40|$|The along-strike {{displacement}} {{variation of}} 20 well-exposed normal faults from the Canyonlands, Utah, is described and analysed. The displacement profiles of these faults are highly variable, and most irregularities {{can be related}} to fault segmentation. Many of the profiles are highly asymmetric, and this {{can be related to}} mechanical interaction in some cases. Linear displacement tapers are observed towards all the lateral tips, but the percentage of trace length over which this linear taper occurs is highly variable. Three distinct lateral tip geometries are recognised, referred to informally as types A, B and C. Type A tips have a simple Mode III displacement geometry, Type B tips are characterised by a zone of extensional 2 ̆ 7 fissures 2 ̆ 7 surrounding the fault tip, and Type C tips are characterised by the development of a monocline beyond the tip. Lateral displacement variation towards tips was analysed by measuring <b>displacement</b> <b>gradients</b> from systematic positions along the fault trace. Lateral <b>displacement</b> <b>gradients</b> measured for 39 tips exhibit a wide range of values (0. 016 - 0. 25). Fourteen of these lateral tips are regarded as 2 ̆ 7 active 2 ̆ 7 since they exhibit signs of recent surface rupturing. These active tips have a similar range of lateral <b>displacement</b> <b>gradients</b> (0. 019 - 0. 25) to the overall population. Lateral <b>displacement</b> <b>gradients</b> were correlated with fault parameters such as length, length/maximum displacement (for faults and segments), and proximity to adjacent faults. No positive correlations were found. We suggest that the large range of lateral <b>displacement</b> <b>gradients</b> is mainly due to interactions between neighbouring faults. Additional complexities are likely to have resulted from strength heterogeneities related to jointing, from local variations in remote loading stresses and the frictional properties of the fault surfaces, and from processes related to segment linkage...|$|R

Subject to certain continuity conditions concerning displacements and tractions at the source point, singular integrals in the BIE and the BIDE corresponding to coe¦cients of <b>displacement</b> and <b>displacement</b> <b>gradients</b> at the source point are shown to be of a form that allows application of StokesÕ theorem.

40|$|International audienceWe study {{mesoscale}} normal faults cutting alternating limestone and clay-rich layers {{in several}} localities in the South-Eastern Mesozoic sedimentary basin (France). The <b>displacement</b> <b>gradients,</b> {{defined as the}} displacement variation per unit length along fault profile, and the mean fault dips are correlated to the structural and petrophysical properties of the host rock, including the carbonate content, the stiffness, the layering pattern and the maximum burial depth. Analysis of the fault dips indicates that the faults propagate (downward or upward) from an initial fracture from one unit to another rather than through connections of fractures that nucleated in different units. The fault dips are consistent with shear, mixed mode and tensile failures in limestone units. They are consistent with shear failure or are abnormally low in the clay-rich units. Among the studied attributes, in limestone units the failure mode {{is related to the}} contrast of the Young's modulus between the limestone and the clay-rich layers. A high contrast promotes tensile failure, whereas a low contrast promotes mixed mode or shear failures. In clay-rich layers, the dip is related to the layering pattern and abnormally low dips are promoted in thin clay-rich layers surrounded by thick limestone units. Specific <b>displacement</b> <b>gradients</b> characterize each lithology of the layered section. It ranges from 0. 06 to 0. 2 in the clay-rich units and it increases with Young's modulus.

In shearography interferometric speckle patterns recorded before and after object deformation are correlated, often by subtraction, to yield correlation fringes sensitive to <b>displacement</b> <b>gradient,</b> a parameter closely related to surface strain. Shearography is sensitive to the component of <b>displacement</b> <b>gradient</b> that {{is determined by the}} direction of the illumination and viewing directions, the optical wavelength and by the magnitude and direction of the applied shear.

Correlation of interferometric speckle patterns recorded {{before and after the}} object deformation yields fringes sensitive to <b>displacement</b> <b>gradient,</b> from which the surface strain can be calculated.

40|$|New {{metrological}} {{techniques have}} been developed for mechanical characterization at the microscale and nanoscale as follows: (1) Development of a control system and integrated imaging capability at the microscale and nanoscale for a new biaxial microtensile tester, (2) a new method for characterizing nonlinearity in AFM imaging using Digital Image Correlation (DIC), and (3) development of pointwise DIC technique. In the biaxial microtensile tester, loading of specimen is induced through the opposing motion of dual picomotor linear actuators in orthogonal directions with a displacement resolution of less than 30 nm. Using an optical microscope, in situ digital images are obtained and analyzed with DIC to determine the full field displacements at the microscale over an Area of Interest (AOI) in order to characterize the biaxial performance of the microtensile tester. An objective AFM has been integrated into the biaxial microtensile tester to obtain in situ digital images of topographic microstructural features at the nanoscale. These topographic images can then be converted to gray scale images with textures that are suitable for DIC to calculate full field displacements at the nanoscale. This measurement capability is demonstrated on a sputtered nanocrystalline copper film subjected to uniaxial loading in the microtensile tester. Since image quality is critical to the accuracy of the nanoscale DIC measurements, a new method was developed to calibrate the errors induced by the nonlinearity of AFM scanning. In this new method, the DIC technique was applied to AFM images of sputtered nanocrystalline NiTi films to calculate the displacement errors caused by the probe offset that must be eliminated from the apparent displacement field. The conventional DIC technique assumes a zero-order or first order approximation of the variation in displacement fields (i. e., <b>displacement</b> <b>gradients)</b> relative to the center of a subset of the image. In the case of displacement fields associated with the microstructure of a material, the <b>displacement</b> <b>gradients</b> can vary discontinuously, which violates the assumed nature of the <b>displacement</b> <b>gradients</b> in the conventional DIC. Therefore, a pointwise DIC technique has been developed to calculate displacements independently at each pixel location, eliminating the constraints imposed by the subset on the calculated displacements. Because of the potentially large number of unknown displacement variables that need to be determined using this approach, an efficient Genetic Algorithm (GA) optimization algorithm with a Differential Evolution (DE) method was investigated for optimizing the correlation function. To guarantee uniqueness of the optimized displacement field, the correlation function was modified using intensity gradients that had to be transformed from an Eulerian to Lagrangian reference frame using <b>displacement</b> <b>gradients.</b> The theoretical development of pointwise DIC is discussed in detail using ideal sinusoidal images, and its validation using real images is also presented...|$|R
