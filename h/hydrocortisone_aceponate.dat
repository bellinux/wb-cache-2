50|$|<b>Hydrocortisone</b> <b>aceponate</b> is a {{corticosteroid}} {{that is used}} in form of creams for {{the treatment}} of various dermatoses (skin conditions). It is an ester of hydrocortisone (cortisol) with acetic acid and propionic acid.|$|E
40|$|Background: Topical {{corticosteroids}} (CSs) are {{the mainstay}} of therapy in various steroid responsive dermatoses. Newer CSs are more efficacious and safer than the older ones. There is no published data on the efficacy and safety of a new steroid <b>hydrocortisone</b> <b>aceponate</b> in the Indian population. Aim: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of <b>hydrocortisone</b> <b>aceponate</b> (0. 127 &#x 0025;) lipophilic cream {{in the treatment of}} steroid responsive dermatoses in Indian patients. Methods: Four hundred and fifteen patients with clinically diagnosed steroid responsive dermatoses enrolled in this study. They were advised to apply <b>hydrocortisone</b> <b>aceponate</b> (0. 127 &#x 0025;) lipophilic cream as a thin film to all the affected areas twice daily. Cleansing was done prior to the application with either soap-free cleanser or soap (that would not affect the study result). Use of oral antihistamines and/or antibiotics was permissible. However, other oral/topical steroid use was not permitted during the study. Patients were evaluated at day 0 and at day 21. Data were recorded regarding clinical improvement and side-effects, if any. They were then analyzed to determine the efficacy and safety of the cream. Results: Physician&#x 2032;s global evaluation of therapy showed that lesions were cleared in 82 (22. 10 &#x 0025;), excellent result in 200 (53. 91 &#x 0025;), good result in 72 (19. 41 &#x 0025;), fair response in 15 (4. 04 &#x 0025;) and no change in 2 (0. 54 &#x 0025;) patients. There was no history of exacerbation in any patient. Conclusion: The study showed that <b>hydrocortisone</b> <b>aceponate</b> (0. 127 &#x 0025;) lipophilic cream is an effective therapeutic agent with a very good safety profile in various steroid responsive dermatoses in the Indian patient population...|$|E

40|$|This review {{examines}} {{advances in}} hormone delivery, particularly using transdermal spray. Transdermal gels, emulsions, patches, subcutaneous implants and sprays {{have been developed}} for transdermal hormone therapy in recent years. Transdermal sprays, in their general form of metered-dose transdermal spray, possess major advantages such as enhanced passive transdermal drug delivery with little or no skin irritations, improved cosmetic acceptability, dose flexibility, uniform distribution on the application site and ease of manufacture, and have thus assumed significant importance in hormone delivery. Estradiol, nestrone, testosterone and <b>hydrocortisone</b> <b>aceponate</b> are some of the drugs prepared as metered-dose transdermal spray. Results from recent surveys indicate that there is a market for the delivery system and ongoing development of transdermal sprays for hormone delivery...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the influence of 0. 00584 % <b>hydrocortisone</b> <b>aceponate</b> spray (HCA; Cortavance Virbac SA, Carros, France) on blood serum cortisol levels and peripheral blood CCR 4 + CD 4 + T-lymphocyte levels in dogs with atopic dermatitis. Patients were randomly divided into group I (N= 8) and group II (N= 8). The dogs in group I were sprayed with HCA on the affected skin once a day for three weeks. The dogs in group II were treated once a day for 3 days followed by no treatment for 4 days {{for a total of}} three weeks. For the dogs in group I and group II the CADESI- 03 scores before and after use of HCA showed significant reduction (P< 0. 01). The postcortisol level after the use of HCA in group I showed 36. 0 % decrease and showed significant suppression (P< 0. 01). By comparison, the use of HCA on group II did not show decrease in postcortisol levels. There was a tendency of suppression for hypothalamus—pituitary gland—adrenal gland system, but it was not serious influence. In addition, there was no influence on peripheral blood CCR 4 + CD 4 + lymphocytes percentage in dogs in group I after treatment with HCA...|$|E

Background: Acute otitis externa is a common multi-factorial disorder in the dog. Several topical preparations {{are available on the}} veterinary market, which are licensed for an either specified duration of treatment or for a discretionary period that is determined by the clinician. Objectives: To compare the efficacy of two topical products, both licensed for the treatment of otitis externa in the dog, but with different treatment durations. Animal Population: One hundred and sixty dogs were enrolled in this multicentre field study from which 157 dogs were analysed in the Per Protocol sam-ple (73 Aurizon ® treated animals and 84 Easotic ® treated animals). Method: Dogs were randomly assigned to Aurizon ® or Easotic ® treatment groups. Aurizon ® (Vétoquinol SA: marbofloxacin, clotrimazole, dexamethasone) was administered daily in the affected ear(s) for 7 or 14 days, and was compared with a daily administration of Easotic ® (Virbac SAS: gentamicin, miconazole, <b>hydrocortisone</b> <b>aceponate)</b> for 5 days. General and localised clinical signs were scored on days 0 (D 0), 3 (D 3), 7 (D 7), 14 (D 14) and 21 (D 21). Results: Clinical cure rates at the end of treatment were 56. 3 % and 48. 8 % (p = 0. 35) in the Aurizon ® and Easotic ® groups respectively and 81. 2 % versus 74. 7 % one week after completing the course of treatment (p = 0. 34). Twenty-one days after initially presenting for the study, cure rates were 84. 3 % in th...|$|E
