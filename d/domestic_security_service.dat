Moreover, the CIA is the only agency authorized by law to carry out and oversee covert action at the behest of the President.

Lennon and Ono wrote two songs protesting British presence and actions in Ireland for their Some Time in New York City album: [...] "Luck of the Irish" [...] and [...] "Sunday Bloody Sunday". In 2000, David Shayler, a former member of Britain's <b>domestic</b> <b>security</b> <b>service</b> MI5, suggested that Lennon had given money to the IRA, though this was swiftly denied by Ono. Biographer Bill Harry records that following Bloody Sunday, Lennon and Ono financially supported the production of the film The Irish Tapes, a political documentary with a Republican slant.|$|E

50|$|In 1976, Elias Sarkis, the Chehabist heir, was {{unanimously}} elected President of {{the country}} in a hope to stop the civil war that had erupted, and to reunite the nation.

40|$|After the September 11 th {{terrorist}} attacks in 2001 in the USA, it became apparent to many countries that coordination functions between intelligence and <b>security</b> <b>services</b> must be strengthened. There was a dramatic boost {{in the number of}} fusions centres. This {{can be explained by the}} increased need for cooperation between various intelligence and <b>security</b> <b>services</b> in order to meet the threat of terrorism which was perceived as increasingly acute. In 2003, Britain established the JTAC, and thereafter, several European countries followed suit. The traditional legal boundaries since the Cold War between foreign intelligence <b>services</b> and <b>domestic</b> <b>security</b> <b>services</b> needed to be reviewed in the light of the increased terrorist threat where the distinctions became increasingly obsolete. This study examines different solutions to this challenge. It deals with fusion centres at the national level, and examines future ambitions...|$|R

40|$|The most {{important}} recent change {{within the realm}} of intelligence and <b>security</b> <b>services</b> has been the expansion of intelligence co-operation. The growing connectivity between both foreign intelligence <b>services</b> and also <b>domestic</b> <b>security</b> <b>services</b> means that we might speak - not just of growing international co-operation - but perhaps even of global co-operation. This essay considers the complex interplay of intelligence and globalization since 1989. It argues that there is an obvious tension between a developing global style of co-operative activity and the traditional mechanisms of oversight, which have tended to be national. Accordingly, it moves on to discuss the recent efforts by national, regional and international systems of inquiry to examine issues that involve intelligence co-operation. It suggests that while formal committee-type mechanisms have limited purchase, they are not the only options for oversight in a globalized context...|$|R

The National Electronic Crime Task Force was expanded, along with the President's authority and abilities in cases of terrorism. The title also condemned the discrimination against Arab and Muslim Americans that happened soon after the September 11 terrorist attacks. The impetus for many of the provisions came from earlier bills, for instance the condemnation of discrimination was originally proposed by Senator Tom Harkin (D-IA) in an amendment to the Combatting Terrorism Act of 2001, though in a different form. It originally included [...] "the prayer of Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, the Archbishop of Washington in a Mass on September 12, 2001 for our Nation and the victims {{in the immediate aftermath of}} the terrorist hijackings and attacks in New York City, Washington, D.C., and Pennsylvania reminds all Americans that 'We must seek the guilty and not strike out against the innocent or we become like them who are without moral guidance or proper direction.'" [...] Further condemnation of racial vilification and violence is also spelled out in Title X, where there was condemnation of such activities against Sikh Americans, who were mistaken for Muslims after the September 11th terrorist attack.|$|R

According to the Undersecretary of Islamic Affairs, the new curriculum will focus on practices in Islam and jurisprudence and will contain content against radicalism and extremism. The Undersecretary for Islamic Affairs reportedly stressed to the Ministry of Education that the new curriculum should be inclusive of the convictions of all branches of Islam. Islamic studies {{are a part of the}} curriculum in government schools and mandatory for all public school students. The decades-old curriculum is based on the Maliki school of Sunni theology. Proposals to include the Ja'afari traditions of Shi'a Islam in the curriculum have been rejected. The civil and criminal legal systems consist of a complex mix of courts based on diverse legal sources, including Sunni and Shi'a Shari'a, tribal law, and other civil codes and regulations.
