5|$|Like other platinum-group metal, bulk Pd {{is quite}} inert. Although contact {{dermatitis}} has been reported, {{data on the}} effects are limited.

50|$|Delta waves {{can arise}} {{either in the}} {{thalamus}} or in the cortex. When associated with the thalamus, they are thought to arise in coordination with the reticular formation. In the cortex, the suprachiasmatic nuclei <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> to regulate delta waves, as lesions to this area <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> to cause disruptions in delta wave activity. In addition, delta waves show a lateralization, with right hemisphere dominance during sleep.Delta waves <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> to <b>be</b> mediated in part by T-type calcium channels. During delta wave sleep, neurons are globally inhibited by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA).|$|R
