When their bowcastles crossed, a {{group of}} men led by Rui Pereira jumped onto the enemy bowcastle, and before the ships were secured, already the Portuguese had stormed all the way to midship. Before the flagship was dominated though, another Mamluk carrack came to its aid, boarding the Santo Espírito from the opposite side. Hussain had strenghtened his forces with a great number of Gujarati soldiers, distributed across the ships, and the heavily armoured Portuguese infantry suddenly risked being overwhelmed. Rui Pereira was killed, but at this crucial moment, the Rei Grande slammed against the <b>free</b> <b>side</b> of Hussain's flagship, delivering direly needed reinforcements, which tipped the scales in favour of the Portuguese.|$|E
6000|$|This was {{the case}} with Mrs. Ryves; she had {{satisfied}} Mrs. Bundy that she was not a simple strummer. Mrs. Bundy admitted to Peter Baron that, for herself, she had a weakness for a pretty tune, and Peter could honestly reply that his ear was equally sensitive. Everything would depend on the [...] "touch" [...] of their inmate. Mrs. Ryves's piano would blight his existence if her hand should prove heavy or her selections vulgar; but if she played agreeable things and played them in an agreeable way she would render him rather a service while he smoked the pipe of [...] "form." [...] Mrs. Bundy, who wanted to let her rooms, guaranteed {{on the part of the}} stranger a first-class talent, and Mrs. Ryves, who evidently knew thoroughly what she was about, had not falsified this somewhat rash prediction. She never played in the morning, which was Baron's working-time, and he found himself listening with pleasure at other hours to her discreet and melancholy strains. He really knew little about music, and the only criticism he would have made of Mrs. Ryves's conception of it was that she seemed devoted to the dismal. It was not, however, that these strains were not pleasant to him; they floated up, on the contrary, as a sort of conscious response to some of his broodings and doubts. Harmony, therefore, would have reigned supreme had it not been for the singularly bad taste of No. 4. Mrs. Ryves's piano was on the <b>free</b> <b>side</b> of the house and was regarded by Mrs. Bundy as open to no objection but that of their own gentleman, who was so reasonable. As much, however, could not be said of the gentleman of No. 4, who had not even Mr. Baron's excuse of being [...] "littery"(he kept a bull-terrier and had five hats--the street could count them), and whom, if you had listened to Mrs. Bundy, you would have supposed to be divided from the obnoxious instrument by walls and corridors, obstacles and intervals, of massive structure and fabulous extent. This gentleman had taken up an attitude which had now passed into the phase of correspondence and compromise; but it was the opinion of the immediate neighbourhood that he had not a leg to stand upon, and on whatever subject the sentiment of Jersey Villas might have been vague, it was not so on the rights and the wrongs of landladies.|$|E

6000|$|Landor {{called himself}} [...] "a Jacobin," [...] though his own letters {{show that he}} was as far as the most insolent young [...] "tuft" [...] from relishing doctrines of human equality. He had the reputation, however, of being not only a Jacobin, but [...] "a mad Jacobin"; too mad for Southey, who was then young, and a Liberal. [...] "Landor was obliged to leave the University for {{shooting}} at one of the Fellows through a window," [...] is the account which Southey gave of Landor's rustication. Now fellows often put up {{with a great deal of}} horse-play. There is scarcely a more touching story than that of the don who for the first time found himself [...] "screwed up," [...] and fastened within his own oak. [...] "What am I to do?" [...] the victim asked his sympathising scout, who was on the other, the <b>free</b> <b>side</b> of the oak. [...] "Well, sir, Mr. Muff, sir, when 'e's screwed up 'e sends for the blacksmith," [...] replied the servant. What a position for a man having authority, to be in the constant habit of sending for the blacksmith! Fellows have not very unfrequently been fired at with Roman candles, or bombarded with soda-water bottles full of gunpowder. One has also known sparrows shot from Balliol windows on the Martyrs' Memorial of our illustration. In this case, too, the sportsman was a poet. But deliberately to pot at a fellow, [...] "to go for him with a shot gun," [...] as the repentant American said he would do in future, after his derringer missed fire, is certainly a strong measure. No college which pretended to maintain discipline could allow even a poet to shoot thus wildly. In truth, Landor's offence has been exaggerated by Southey. It was nothing out of the common. The poet was giving [...] "an after-dinner party" [...] in his rooms. The men were mostly from Christ Church; for Landor was intimate, he says, with only one undergraduate of his own college, Trinity. On the opposite side of the quadrangle a Tory and a butt, named Leeds, was entertaining persons whom the Jacobin Landor calls [...] "servitors and other raff of every description." [...] The guests at the rival wine- parties began to [...] "row" [...] each other, Landor says, adding, [...] "All the time I was only a spectator, for I should have blushed to have had any conversation with them, particularly out of a window. But my gun was lying on a table in the room, and I had in a back closet some little shot. I proposed, as they had closed the casements, and as the shutters were on the outside, to fire a volley. It was thought a good trick, and accordingly I went into my bedroom and fired." [...] Mr. Leeds very superfluously complained to the President. Landor adopted the worst possible line of defence, and so the University and this poet parted company.|$|E

Since the piece {{was part of a}} wall, either side was observed by a limited number of people and nobody on the other side. It is simple to tell which side faced West Berlin and which side faced East Berlin. The former has graffiti and the latter is bare. “‘So you’re talking about the <b>free</b> <b>side,</b> the side that the Americans were able to release at the end of (World War II). That’s why we have all this graffiti on it, because they were free, they were allowed to do things, and express themselves,’ Nicholle Dombrowski, executive director of the DANK Haus German American Cultural Center, said. ‘The east side is traditionally clean, because they were under a communist government at that time, and they were not allowed to express themselves, whatsoever.’”. The piece serves as a metaphoric and literal reminder of the two very different sides of a long, bitter conflict.|$|E
5000|$|As the gap closed, Jones {{signaled}} his {{ships to}} form a line of battle, but Landais ignored the order and sailed off to one side, forcing Countess of Scarborough to do likewise. In the ensuing four-hour Battle of Flamborough Head off England's Yorkshire coast, Landais, after briefly engaging the Countess took little part in the action. On the way {{to check up on}} the duel which developed between the Countess and the Pallas, Landais fired a broadside at Serapis, which was by then immobile, and lashed firmly alongside Bonhomme Richard- as a result both ships were damaged. Some time later, with Bonhomme Richard losing its duel, Alliance returned to the main battle, and Jones happily [...] "... thought the battle was at an end ...." [...] But, to his [...] "... utter astonishment", Landais' ship [...] "... discharged a broadside full into the stern of the Bonhomme Richard." [...] Jones and his crew [...] "... called to him Landais for God's sake to forbear firing into the Bonhomme Richard, yet he passed along {{off the side of the}} ship and continued firing." [...] This, however, was just more collateral damage, resulting from Landais' policy of keeping well out of the line of the guns on the <b>free</b> <b>side</b> of Serapis. Unable to move his ship (either to escape or to aim a broadside at Alliance) Captain Pearson of Serapis surrendered within a short time.|$|E
50|$|The {{total length}} of the weapon {{is about the same}} as the Chinese staff, the gùn and greater than that of the single staff (known in Japanese as a bō); Its larger size allows for an {{increased}} reach compared to the staff. Some of the techniques are {{similar to that of the}} staff, so spinning moves over the head and behind the back, such as helicopter spins and neck rolls, can be practised with a regular staff. Other weapon techniques the three section staff makes use of are similar to that of a pair of sticks used escrima, a simple short chain, a whip and the two section staff. It is therefore advantageous for the user to have some familiarity with these weapons. The three-section staff has the advantage of being used as a long-range (whip), intermediate range (flail or two section staff) or a short-range (pair of escrima) weapon. Acting as an extension of the users arms, the three sectional staff can strike, flail, block, choke, trap, disarm and whip, often with different sections of the staff acting at the same time. The chains or binding ropes of the staff are used to entangle an opponent and their weapons. While it has three ranges, the three section staff is best used as a short range weapon against long ranged weapons. In this configuration, a skilled practitioner can nearly simultaneously block an opponent's strike, trap his or her weapon and disarm them while executing their own strike with the <b>free</b> <b>side</b> of the staff.|$|E

Davy ordered the {{commando}} to Kythera, ready for a move to the Peloponnese in anticipation of the German withdrawal from Greece. Here, British forces were being sucked into the emerging Greek Civil War, and often found themselves between opposing communist and anti-communist Greek forces. They managed to defuse many of these potential conflicts, saving many lives in the process. Finally they were ordered to take two islands off Piraeus in order to provide security for Royal Navy minesweepers operating in the area in preparation for the arrival of larger British force under Ronald Scobie. Orders that they were not to enter Athens itself did not reach them, and Tod ensured that the airfield and various strategic points in Athens were under British control prior to Scobie's arrival. Tod was awarded the freedom of the city by Archbishop Damaskinos of Athens, and Davy credited him as [...] "one of the two British officers who kept Greece on the <b>free</b> <b>side</b> of the Iron Curtain".
