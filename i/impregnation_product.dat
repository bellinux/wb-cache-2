The most commonly used silver staining methods employ silver ions for <b>impregnation.</b> <b>Product</b> of those methods is elementary silver, reduced "in situ" to the specific tissue components. (Newman, and others, 1998) The aim of this thesis was to analyze {{the most commonly used}} impregnating methods, to show their use in diagnostic pathology and to present the methodics of those techniques. The secondary aim of this thesis was to evaluate their importance in routine histopathological practice. The introductions part contains general information about the impregnating methods and their use. General theoretical part deals with the principle of those methods, special part deals with the structures which are showed by using those methods, and with general description of histological process. Methodical part contains detailed descriptions of chosen silvering methods, and their results.

40|$|Abstract: The mercury {{porosimetry}} experiment has tested three {{different kinds of}} porosity graphite and the microscopic structure of impregnation antimony materials, and has calculated the corresponding fractal dimension by using the Menger model. The results show that: the main pore diameter of the graphite materials is in the interval of mµ 3 ~ 1, most {{of which can be}} filled by impregnation antimony, and graphite and impregnation antimony materials both have the fractal characteristics. Graphite materials also have the dual fractal characteristics. Its fractal inflection point aperture is about 1 µm, and the fractal dimension (3. 05 ~ 3. 25) of the small pores (φ≤ 1 µm) is less than the one (3. 71 ~ 3. 95) of the large pores (φ> 1 µm). The reason why existing the dual fractal characteristics is that the size of the pore formation mechanism is different. Impregnation occurs mainly in the range of large pores, characteristics of which is an important factor to influence the quality of impregnation materials. The material formula is the main factor to influence the large pores and an important guarantee {{to improve the quality of}} <b>impregnation</b> <b>products...</b>|$|R

40|$|Catalytic wet air {{oxidation}} using heterogeneous catalysts is {{a promising}} technology {{for treatment of}} wastewaters. Wastewaters from olive oil mills are difficult to clean because effluents contain high levels of phenolic compounds that cannot be removed by biological treatment or incineration. Therefore, we tested the catalytic wet air oxidation of p-hydroxybenzoic acid, as model molecule of olive oil mills wastewaters, over Ru-supported CeO 2 –TiO 2 mixed oxides. We focussed on the Ce/Ti molar ratio because this ratio modifies {{the properties of the}} Ru catalysts. Supports were prepared by using the sol–gel method. The Ru catalysts were prepared by <b>impregnation.</b> Those <b>products</b> were characterized by N 2 adsorption–desorption, X-ray diffraction, H 2 chemisorption, transmission electron microscopy and inductively coupled plasma. Catalytic wet air oxidation of p-hydroxybenzoic acid was performed in a batch reactor at 140  °C and 50  bar of air. Our results show that the most efficient catalyst was Ru with a Ce/Ti ratio of 1 / 5, which converted totally p-hydroxybenzoic after 7  h of reaction without Ru leaching. We explain this finding by an enhanced dispersion of Ru due to better structural properties of the CeO 2 –TiO 2 support. © 2015, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

40|$|The overall {{objective}} of this project {{was to develop a}} new approach for the direct liquefaction of coal to produce an all-distillate product slate at a sizable cost reduction over current technology. The approach integrated coal selection, pretreatment, coal swelling with catalyst <b>impregnation,</b> liquefaction, <b>product</b> recovery with characterization, alternate bottoms processing, and a technical assessment including an economic evaluation. Heterofunctional solvents were the most effective in swelling coals. Also solvent blends such as isopropanol/water were more effective than pure solvents alone. Impregnating slurry catalysts simultaneously during coal swelling showed that better uptake was achieved with nonswelling solvent and higher impregnation temperature. Some enhancement in initial coal conversion was seen liquefying SO{sub 2 }-treated Black Thunder coal with slurry catalysts, and also when hydrogen donor liquefaction solvents were used. Noncatalytic reactions showed no benefit from SO{sub 2 } treatment. Coupling coal swelling and SO{sub 2 } treatment with slurry catalysts was also not beneficial, although high conversion was seen with continuous operation and long residence time, however, similar high conversion was observed with untreated coal. SO{sub 2 } treatment is not economically attractive unless it provides about 17 % increase in coal reactivity. In most cases, the best results were obtained when the coal was untreated and the slurry catalyst was added directly into the reactor.

The approach integrates coal selection, pretreatment, coal swelling with catalyst <b>impregnation,</b> liquefaction, <b>product</b> recovery with characterization, alternate bottoms processing, and carrying out a technical assessment including an economic evaluation. The primary coal of this program, Black Thunder subbituminous coal, can be effectively beneficiated to about 3. 5 wt % ash using aqueous sulfurous acid pretreatment. This treated coal can be further beneficiated to about 2 wt % ash using commercially available procedures. All three coals used in this study (Black Thunder, Burning Star bituminous, and Martin Lake lignite) are effectively swelled by a number of solvents. The most effective solvents are those having hetero-functionality. laboratory- and bench-scale liquefaction experimentation is underway using swelled and catalyst impregnated coal samples. Higher coal conversions were observed for the SO{sub 2 }-treated subbituminous coal than the raw coal, regardless of catalyst type. Conversions of swelled coal were highest when Molyvan L, molybdenum naphthenate, and nickel octoate, respectively, were added to the liquefaction solvent. The study of bottoms processing consists of combining the ASCOT process which consists of coupling solvent deasphalting with delayed coking to maximize the production of coal-derived liquids while rejecting solids within the coke drum. The asphalt production phase has been completed; representative product has been evaluated. The solvent system for the deasphalting process has been established.

Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves: 92 - 96) Text in English; Abstract: Turkish and Englishxvii, 96 leavesThe {{preparation of}} active and selective clinoptilolite rich natural zeolite supported palladium and nickel catalysts for the liquid phase hydrogenation of citral was investigated. The catalysts were prepared by impregnation and ion exchange methods. Catalytic activity and selectivity tests were {{performed in a}} semi-batch reactor for different calcination temperatures, pressures, stirring rates, reaction temperatures, amount of catalysts, ethanol sources, catalyst metal loadings and catalysts preparation methods. Catalyst deactivation was also investigated. The characterization results showed that clinoptilolite was the major mineral in natural zeolite used as catalyst and catalyst support. It was thermally stable up to 440 °C and its stability improved with Pd and Ni loading. Catalysts with loading of 0. 72, 2. 42, 5. 63 % Pd and 3. 12 % Ni were prepared by impregnation method. One catalyst was prepared by Pd ion exchange (5. 66 %). Surface areas of the catalyst samples changed with calcination temperature, method of metal loading, amount of metal loading. A calcination temperature of 430 °C and catalyst metal loading of 2. 42 % Pd provided the largest surface area (38. 96 m 2 /g) among the catalysts prepared by impregnation. The catalyst prepared by ion exchange had a much more larger surface area (49. 46 m 2 /g) than those prepared by <b>impregnation.</b> The <b>product</b> distribution changed with catalysts prepared by different methods, catalyst metal loadings, catalyst calcination temperatures and reaction temperatures. The {{results showed that the}} Pd catalyst prepared by impregnation favoured the hydrogenation of the conjugated double bond of citral, giving citronellal as the primary hydrogenation products, whereas the amounts of unsaturated alcohols were very minor. High selectivity to citronellal was obtained for the catalyst calcined at 430 °C containing 2. 42 % Pd. The product distribution and the reaction rates were affected significantly by the reaction temperature (80, 100 and 120 °C). The highest selectivity to citronellal (88 %) and the yield of citronellal (87 %) were obtained at 120 °C. Higher reaction rates were observed as temperature increased. Increasing the amount of the catalyst in the reaction medium (150, 250 and 400 mg/ 100 mL) affected the reaction rates, selectivity and the yield of citronellal. The highest amount of citronellal yield (91 %) was obtained when the reaction was carried out {{in the presence of the}} largest amount of the catalyst (400 mg/ 100 mL) used in this study. Different product distributions were obtained with various ethanol sources. Higher yields and selectivities were obtained with more pure solvent. Product distribution changed with catalyst metal loading. First increased significantly by changing catalyst loading from 0. 72 to 2. 42 % Pd and then rised slowly when metal loading changed from 2. 42 to 5. 63 % Pd. This was attributed to active metal surface area and its dispersion. Impregnated Pd catalysts regained their activities and selectivities upon regeneration. Ni impregnated catalyst showed a different product distribution. It showed a lower activity for a given temperature. Overall selectivities of the best Pd catalyst and Ni catalysts were similar. Pd catalyst prepared by ion exchange gave different products and its selectivity to citronellal was the lowest. This was attributed to the metal and catalyst surface interactions...|$|R
40|$|Perfluorinated {{compounds}} (PFCs) are {{a family}} of chemicals used widely as surfactants, anti-staining <b>products,</b> <b>impregnation</b> agents and fire fighting foams. The wide possible uses for these compounds are due to their unique water- and oil repellent properties. Notable PFCs, like perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) {{and others have been}} found in the (mainly aquatic) environment as well as animals and humans. Several studies have investigated the effects of these chemicals, mainly PFOS and PFOA, since the first observation in human serum. The literature available on PFC exposure and potential harmful effects in humans will be discussed. PFC exposure occurs through different routes. Indoor and outdoor air {{has been found to be}} contaminated with some degree of PFCs, from which inhalation is a form of exposure. Inhalation of contaminated house dust has been mentioned as a source of exposure as well. Most abundant route of exposure was found to be dietary, mainly through directly contaminated fish or food contaminated by PFCs through migration from the packaging. Ingestion of house dust by toddlers contributes to total exposure as well. Furthermore, occupational exposure may occur in PFC factories as well as occupations using PFC products, like ski-wax. Occupational levels of PFC exposure have been found to be several orders of magnitude higher than general population levels. Many effects have been found to be associated with PFC exposure, mainly PFOS and PFOA, for the most part investigated in rodents. Only few effects have been observed at exposure levels comparable to the general population. Immunotoxic effects were found in relevant concentrations in rodents, causing a reduction in immune response. Epidemiological effects in the general population include reprotoxic effects, like reduced sperm count, and a recent study observed a positive correlation between PFC levels in serum and Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder (ADHD) in children. Higher perceived adverse effects, like carcinogenicity and neurotoxicity, have been observed in rodents, but in higher concentrations and these have not been found in the general population or the occupationally exposed. In conclusion, epidemiological data provides the most convincing evidence of adverse effects due to PFC exposure. More toxic effects found in rodents increase the potential risk of these compounds in humans as well. Further investigation of PFOS and PFOA, but also other PFCs less abundant in humans, is needed to completely assess the risks of PFCs for humans. It is evident that the unrest caused by these compounds is substantiated, and deserves more attention...|$|R
40|$|Osmotic Dehydration and Vacuum Impregnation are {{interesting}} {{operations in the}} food industry with applications in minimal fruit processing and/or freezing, allowing to develop new products with specific innovative characteristics. Osmotic dehydration is widely used for the partial removal of water from cellular tissue by immersion in hypertonic (osmotic) solution. The driving force for the diffusion {{of water from the}} tissue is provided by the differences in water chemical potential between the external solution and the internal liquid phase of the cells. Vacuum <b>Impregnation</b> of porous <b>products</b> immersed in a liquid phase consist of reduction of pressure in a solid-liquid system (vacuum step) followed by the restoration of atmospheric pressure (atmospheric step). During the vacuum step the internal gas in the product pores is expanded and partially flows out while during the atmospheric step, there is a compression of residual gas and the external liquid flows into the pores (Fito, 1994). This process is also a very useful unit operation in food engineering as it allows to introduce specific solutes in the tissue which can play different functions (antioxidants, pH regulators, preservatives, cryoprotectants etc.). The present study attempts to enhance our understanding and knowledge of fruit as living organism, interacting dynamically with the environment, and to explore metabolic, structural, physico-chemical changes during fruit processing. The use of innovative approaches and/or technologies such as SAFES (Systematic Approach to Food Engineering System), LF-NMR (Low Frequency Nuclear Magnetic Resonance), GASMAS (Gas in Scattering Media Absorption Spectroscopy) are very promising to deeply study these phenomena. SAFES methodology was applied in order to study irreversibility of the structural changes of kiwifruit during short time of osmotic treatment. The results showed that the deformed tissue can recover its initial state 300 min after osmotic dehydration at 25 °C. The LF-NMR resulted very useful in water status and compartmentalization study, permitting to separate observation of three different water population presented in vacuole, cytoplasm plus extracellular space and cell wall. GASMAS techniques was able to study the pressure equilibration after Vacuum Impregnation showing that after restoration of atmospheric pressure in the solid-liquid system, there was a reminding internal low pressure in the apple tissue that slowly increases until reaching the atmospheric pressure, in a time scale that depends on the vacuum applied during the vacuum step. The physiological response of apple tissue on Vacuum Impregnation process was studied indicating the possibility of vesicular transport within the cells. Finally, the possibility to extend the freezing tolerance of strawberry fruits impregnated with cryoprotectants was proven. ...|$|R
