5|$|When {{speaking}} about why an online game {{was chosen as}} {{the next step in the}} series, Fujisawa cited the intuitive character AI in Dragon Quest IV and party member communication in Dragon Quest VII. Solid ideas for an online game set within the Dragon Quest series were first suggested in 2005, when development was wrapping up on Dragon Quest VIII. It was initially worked on by a very small team, who worked together on the groundwork for some time. A core part of the initial plan was that the game would have a pre-planned ten-year lifespan with continual content updates. Once work had finished on Dragon Quest IX, Dragon Quest X took full priority. During these earlier phases, it was still undecided whether to make the game a mainline title, and there was even doubt as to whether <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> MMORPG rather than just an online multiplayer game. These doubts, held by Saito, were assuaged by Fujisawa's confidence in the project. Despite this, Fujisawa was a novice at both developing and playing MMORPGs, putting him in stark contrast with other staff members such as Saito, Yoshida and second chief planner Takashi Anzai.|$|E

25|$|The first {{mention of}} a Capitoline triad refers to the Capitolium Vetus. The only ancient source who refers to the {{presence}} of this divine triad in Greece is Pausanias X 5, 1-2, who mentions its existence in describing the Φωκικόν in Phocis. The Capitoline triad poses difficult interpretative problems. It looks peculiarly Roman, since there is no sure document of its existence elsewhere either in Latium or Etruria. A direct Greek influence is possible but it would be also plausible to consider it a local creation. Dumézil advanced the hypothesis <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> ideological construction of the Tarquins to oppose new Latin nationalism, as it included the three gods that in the Iliad are enemies of Troy. It is probable Latins had already accepted the legend of Aeneas as their ancestor. Among ancient sources indeed Servius states that according to the Etrusca Disciplina towns should have the three temples of Jupiter, Juno and Minerva at the end of three roads leading to three gates. Vitruvius writes that the temples of these three gods should be located on the most elevated site, isolated from the other. To his Etruscan founders the meaning of this triad might have been related to peculiarly Etruscan ideas on the association of the three gods with the birth of Herakles and the siege of Troy, in which Minerva plays a decisive role as a goddess of destiny along with the sovereign couple Uni Tinia.|$|E
500|$|The writing team reconvened {{later that}} day, after Braga met with {{executive}} producer Rick Berman separately. Berman made several suggestions for the plot; that Janeway shouldn't decode the message immediately {{at the start}} of the episode, and that the vengeance seeking alien should be decrepit and attempting to deceive the crew. As the group planned out an overview of the idea on a whiteboard, the alien was once again discussed. The idea of having him be of a species which had already been assimilated by the Borg was warmly received, with Menosky suggesting that it could be one of the first races assimilated. Braga countered by suggesting three ideas; that <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> early race; one that was more recent; or that <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> El-Aurian. Taylor dismissed the El-Aurian suggestion as she wanted the alien to have more interesting makeup. The writers begin to refer to the alien as [...] "Yoda". During the course of that second meeting, the plot of the episode prior to the reveal of the new spacecraft was developed. The [...] "silver bullet" [...] style ship was one which had been suggested by Braga for some time, but until now had not found an appropriate episode.|$|E

At that time, Ralph and Chief Wiggum were not established as being related. Jean {{thought it would be}} funny if Ralph was Wiggum's son, considering both characters are [...] "fat and dumb". A technique the staff used to come up with stories and ideas was to think [...] "what holiday haven't we done on The Simpsons, or done lately?". As they had done several Halloween and Christmas episodes before, the staff liked the idea of doing a Valentine's Day episode.|$|E

2500|$|The most {{important}} evidence for dating 1 Henry VI is the Diary of Philip Henslowe, which records {{a performance of}} a play by Lord Strange's Men called Harey Vj (i.e. Henry VI) on 3 March 1592 at the Rose Theatre in Southwark. Henslowe refers to the play as [...] "ne" [...] (which most critics take to mean [...] "new", although <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> abbreviation for the Newington Butts theatre, which Henslow may have owned) and mentions that it had fifteen performances and earned £3.16s.8d, meaning it was extremely successful. Harey Vj is usually accepted as being 1 Henry VI {{for a couple of}} reasons. Firstly, it is unlikely to have been either 2 Henry VI or 3 Henry VI, as they were published in 1594 and 1595, respectively, with the titles under which they would have originally been performed, so as to ensure higher sales. As neither of them appear under the title Harey Vj, the play seen by Henslowe is unlikely to be either of them. Additionally, as Gary Taylor points out, Henslowe tended to identify sequels, but not first parts, to which he referred by the general title. As such, [...] "Harey Vj could not be a Part Two or Part Three but could easily be a Part One." [...] The only other option is that Harey Vj is a now lost play.|$|E

[...] Adlakha felt the posters released for the film [...] "have been alright thus far, but these ones probably tell general audiences to expect a very bloated movie." [...] Adlakha was more positive of the international poster, which he felt was more [...] "comicbook-y" [...] and [...] "looks like <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> actual scene from the film." [...] Both Rich and Adlakha criticized the fact that Holland, Keaton and Downey appeared twice on the domestic poster, {{both in and out of}} costume. Sony partnered with ESPN CreativeWorks to create cross-promotional television ads for Homecoming and the 2017 NBA Finals, which were filmed by Watts. The ads were made to [...] "weave in a highlight from the game just moments" [...] after it occurred. The promos see Holland, Downey Jr., and Favreau reprise their roles from the film, with cameo appearances from Stan Lee, DJ Khaled, Tim Duncan, Magic Johnson, and Cari Champion.

[...] though other sources admit that <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> exaggeration or inaccurate recounting of the ambassador's words. Immediately after that, the Soviet ambassador had been withdrawn to Moscow and never returned to Germany. According to Ulam, future conversations on the topic in Berlin were believed to continue with lower level officials working under the cover of a Soviet trade mission. Starting on 14 April 1939 and continuing right up to August 1939, the German embassy in London received anonymously copies of British diplomatic cables to and from Moscow, detailing London's attempts to have the Soviet Union join the anti-German [...] "peace front". The Foreign Office's diplomatic telegrams were selectively edited to make it sound like that Anglo-Soviet relations were far better than they actually were, and that the talks were going much better than what was the case. The German ambassador to the court of St. James, Herbert von Dirksen judged the cables credible and passed them along in his reports to Berlin. As the Germans could not break the Foreign Office's codes nor did the Abwehr have an agent with access to the Foreign Office's codes, these intercepted cables were not the work of German intelligence. In fact, these cables that sent to the German embassy in London were the work of the NKVD, which had broken the British codes, and seeking to pressure the Reich to come to terms with the Soviet Union [...]|$|E
