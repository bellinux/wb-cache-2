This study examined the role of seeds and hormones in the regulation of cell division and elongation in <b>early</b> <b>pea</b> fruit development. Profiling histone H 2 A and γ-tonoplast intrinsic protein (TIP) gene expression during early fruit development identified the relative contributions of cell division and elongation to fruit growth, whereas histological studies identified specific zones of cell division and elongation in exocarp, mesocarp, and endocarp tissues. Molecular and histological studies showed that maximal cell division was from − 2 to 2 d after anthesis (DAA) and elongation from 2 to 5 DAA in pea pericarp. Maximal increase in pericarp γ-TIP message level preceded the maximal rate of fruit growth and, in general, γ-TIP mRNA level was useful as a qualitative marker for expanding tissue, but not as a quantitative marker for cell expansion. Seed removal resulted in rapid decreases in pericarp growth and in γ-TIP and histone H 2 A message levels. In general, GA and 4 -chloroindole- 3 -acetic acid maintained these processes in deseeded pericarp similarly to pericarps with seeds, and both hormones were required to obtain mesocarp cell sizes equivalent to intact fruit. However, GA treatment to deseeded pericarps resulted in elevated levels of γ-TIP mRNA (6 and 7 DAA) when pericarp growth and cell enlargement were minimal.

ENGLISH ABSTRACT: Botrytis cinerea Pers. : Fr., a {{pathogen}} of grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.), moves {{mainly through}} conidia by air currents in vineyards which are deposited intermittently on {{the surfaces of}} leaves, inflorescences and bunches. Little {{is known about the}} relationship between the inoculum dosage in air and incidence of Botrytis bunch rot, and how the relationship is influenced by environmental and host factors. To better understand this relationship, information is needed on the period over which conidia have accumulated, the time they are able to survive and remain infectious, time of symptom expression in relation to conidium arrival at the infection court and host surface wetness. The aims of this study were (i) to estimate the amount of viable B. cinerea occurring in air in vineyards, and at different positions on leaves, inflorescences and bunches of grape at different phenological stages, (ii) to determine the relationships between the number of B. cinerea colonies recorded on spore traps placed in the bunch zone of vines and the incidence of B. cinerea recorded from the different tissues, and (iii) to compare the efficacy of fenhexamid on leaves and inflorescences carrying natural B. cinerea inoculum with those inoculated with dry, airborne conidia. Different techniques were used to detect viable Botrytis cinerea in air currents and on plant material obtained from table (cultivars Dauphine and Waltham Cross in Paarl- and Worcester-district) and wine grape (cultivars Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc and Merlot in Stellenbosch- and Malmesbury district) vineyards in the Western Cape province during 2001 - 02 and 2002 - 03. For four consecutive days during prebloorn, bloom, pea-size, bunch closure, veraison and harvest, sets of Petri dishes with freshly prepared Kerssies' B. cinerea selective medium (spore traps) were left overnight in the bunch zone of vines. Plant material was collected from the vines on the fourth day. Leaves, infloresence and bunches were treated with paraquat to terminate host resistance and to promote the development of the pathogen on the tissues. The B. cinerea inoculum dosage in air, and the incidence at which the pathogen was detected at various positions on leaves and in bunches normally differed between vineyards. However, the various tests revealed that the pathogen generally occurred in a consistent pattern in air in the bunch zone of vines, on leaves and in bunches from all vineyards. The inoculum dosage in air in the bunch zone of the vine was generally highest during prebioom or during bloom, it decreased at pea size and mostly remained at a very low level at the later growth stages. The estimations of viable B. cinerea residing naturally on leaves and in bunches, showed that their amounts depicted levels occurring in air in the bunch zone of the vine. Necrotic leaves occurring early season in vineyards were identified as an important source of secondary inoculum for dispersal to the developing bunches. Latent infections at the various positions in bunches were few at véraison and harvest. However, due to the necrotrophic ability of the pathogen, extensive berry rot (due to berry-to-berry contact) and thus severe bunch rot developed from a single berry that become symptomatic {{at the base of the}} pedicel/berry attachment zone. The B. cinerea occupation pattern explains why Botrytis bunch rot develops mostly from the inner bunch and why disease management strategies should concentrate on the bloom to pre-bunch closure stage and on inhibiting B. cinerea development in the inner bunch during the early part of the season. Thus, to effectively reduce B. cinerea in grapevine, preventative applications are recommended to reduce two primary infection events: (a) between budding and pre-bloom to counteract primary leaf infection; (b) during late bloom or <b>early</b> <b>pea</b> size stage, to reduce the amount of the pathogen on leaves and infloresences and to prevent colonisation of floral debris. A third spray can be applied at bunch closure to reduce the amount of B. cinerea at various positions of the inner bunch, especially for cultivars with tight bunches. The efficacy of fenhexamid on leaves and inflorescences carrying natural B. cinerea inoculum was compared with those inoculated with dry, airborne conidia. Shoots were obtained during late bloom from a vineyard (wine grape cultivar Merlot) in the Stellenbosch region. The shoots were divided into two main groups. One group of shoots was left uninoculated, the other shoots were inoculated by dusting with dry B. cinerea conidia in a settling tower. Before inoculation, equal numbers of shoots in each main group was sprayed with fenhexamid, or left unsprayed. Following inoculation and incubation, shoots of each treatment were divided in two equal groups. The one lot of shoots were rinsed in water. The other lot of shoots were immersed in paraquat solution to terminate host resistance and to promote the development of the pathogen from the tissues. For both uninoculated and inoculated shoots, irrespective of fungicide treatment, leaves remained asymptomatic at both the blade and petiole position for the water rinse treatment. No symptom of B. cinerea decay developed at any of the positions on leaves from shoots sprayed with fenhexamid. Spraying of shoots with fenhexamid completely suppressed B. cinerea infection and symptom expression on both uninoculated and inoculated inflorescens. For inoculated shoots, B. cinerea developed from approximately 50 % of the laterals in the water rinse treatment. However, inflorescences rinsed in water remained asymptomatic. The laboratory studies showed that fungicides, if applied properly to shoots and bunches under controlled conditions, effectively reduced the amount of B. cinerea at the various positions on leaves and inflorescence, and prevented infection and symptom expression at bloom. However, these goals are not achieved in vineyards where the fungicides are applied by conventional spraying methods. Therefore, more work is needed to evaluate fungicide application techniques by conventional spraying methods for proper fungicide coverage, and the reduction of B. cinerea in bunches. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Botrytis cinerea Pers. : Fr., 'n patogeen van druiwe (Vilis vinifera L.), beweeg hoofsaaklik deur middel van konidia in lugstrome deur die wingerd, en word dan afwisselend op die oppervlakte van die blare, bloeiwyses en trosse gedeponeer. Daar is nog min bekend oor die verhouding tussen die hoeveelheid inokulum in die lug en die voorkoms van Botrytis op die trosse, en hoe die verhouding deur omgewings- en gasheerfaktore beïnvloed word. Ten einde hierdie interaksie beter te verstaan, word inligting benodig oor die tydperk waarin die konidia akkumuleer, die tyd wat hulle oorleef en virulent bly, en die tyd van simptoom-uitdrukking in verhouding tot die verspreiding van die konidia by die infeksie-setel en benatbaarheid van die gasheer-oppervlakte. Die doel van hierdie studie was (i) om die hoeveelheid lewensvatbare B. cinerea wat in die lug voorkom, asook by verskeie posisies op blare, bloeiwyses en trosse by verskillende fenologiese stadiums te kwantifiseer, (ii) om die verhouding tussen die aantal aangetekende B. cinerea kolonies op spoorvangers wat in die trossone van die wingerd geplaas is, en die voorkoms van B. cinerea, aangeteken van verskeie weefsels, te bepaal, en (iii) om die effektiwiteit van fenhexamid op blare en bloeiwyses wat natuurlike B. cinerea inokulum dra, te vergelyk met dié wat met droë, luggedraagde konidia geïnokuleer is. Verskillende tegnieke is gebruik om lewensvatbare Botrytis cinerea in lugstrome en op plantmateriaal van tafeldruiwe (kultivars Dauphine en Waltham Cross In Paarl- en Worcester-distrik) en wyndruiwe (kultivar Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc en Merlot in Stellenbosch- en Malmesbury distrik) in wingerde van die Wes-Kaap provinsie gedurende 2001 - 02 en 2002 - 03 te kwantifiseer. Petri bakkies met vars voorbereide Kerssies medium, selektief vir B. cinerea (spoorvangers), is vir vier agtereenvolgende dae gedurende vóórblom, blom, ertjiekorrel, trostoemaak, kleurbreek en oes, oornag in die trossone van wingerdstokke in betrokke wingerde, gelaat. Plantmateriaal is op die vierde dag versamel. Blare, bloeiwyses en trosse is met paraquat behandel ten einde die gasheerweerstand af te breek en ontwikkeling van die patogeen op die weefsel te bevorder. B. cinerea inokulum in die lug, en die frekwensie waarby die patogeen op verskeie posisies op blare en in die trosse voorgekom het, het normaalweg tussen wingerde verskil. Die verskeie toetse het getoon dat die patogeen normaalweg in 'n vaste patroon in die lug en die trossones van wingerde, asook op blare en in trosse van alle wingerde voorkom. Die inokulumkonsentrasie in die lug in die trossones van wingerdstokke was normaalweg die hoogste gedurende vóórblom of gedurende blom. Die inokulumdruk het by ertjiekorrel verminder en meestal by 'n 'n baie lae vlak tydens die latere groeistadia gebly. Die bepaling van lewensvatbare B. cinerea wat natuurlik op blare en in trosse gedeponeer is, het getoon dat hul hoeveelhede ooreenstem met vlakke wat in die lug in die trossone van die wingerd voorkom. Nekrotiese blare vroeg in die seisoen is 'n belangrike bron van sekondêre inokulum en speel dus 'n belangrike rol by die verspreiding van Botrytis tussen die ontwikkelende trosse. Latente infeksies by die verskeie posisies in trosse was laag by kleurbreek en oes. Weens die saprofitiese vermoëns van die patogeen, kan uitgebreide korrelvrot (a. g. v. korrel-tot-korrel kontak) en dus ernstige trosvrot, ontwikkel. 'n Enkele korrel kan by die basis van die pedisel/korrel vashegtingsone simptomaties raak, en vandaar na aangrensende korrels versprei. Die B. cinerea kolonisasiepatroon verduidelik waarom Botrytis trosvrot meestal vanaf die binneste tros ontwikkel en waarom siektebeheerstrategieë op die vóórblom- tot blomstadium gekonsentreer moet word, en op die inhibering van B. cinerea ontwikkeling in die binneste tros gedurende die vroeë stadia van die seisoen. Dus, om B. cinerea effektief tydens die twee primêre infeksie stadiums in wingerde te verminder, kan voorkomende toedienings aanbeveel word: (a) tussen knopvorming en vóórblom om primêre blaarinfeksie te verhoed; (b) gedurende láátblom en vroeë ertjiekorrel om die hoeveelheid inokulum op die blare en bloeiwyses te verminder, en die kolonisasie van blomdebris te voorkom. 'n Derde toediening kan tydens trostoemaak aangewend word om B. cinerea by verskeie posisies in die binneste tros te verminder, veral by kultivars met digte trosse. Die effektiwitiet van fenhexamid op blare en bloeiwyses waarop natuurlike B. cinerea inokulum voorkom is vergelyk met dié wat met droë, luggedraagde konidia geïnokuleer is. Lote is vanaf 'n wingerd (wyndruif kultivar Merlot) in die Stellenbosch distrik tydens láátblom verkry en in twee hoofgroepe verdeel. Die een groep lote is geïnokuleer deur droë B. cinerea konidia in 'n afsettingstoring te strooi, terwyl die ander groep nie geïnokuleer is nie. Vóór inokulasie, is die helfte van die lote in elke groep met fenhexamid behandel, terwyl die ander helfte onbehandeld gelaat is. Ná inokulasie en inkubasie, is lote van elke behandeling verder in twee eweredige groepe verdeel. Die een groep lote is in water gespoel, terwyl die ander groep lote in 'n paraquatoplossing gedompel is om die gasheerweerstand te verwyder, en die ontwikkeling van die patogeen vanuit die weefsels te bevorder. Vir die waterspoelbehandeling van beide ongeïnokuleerde en geïnokuleerde lote, ongeag van die fungisiedbehandeling, het die blare asimptomaties by beide die bladoppervlakte en blaarsteelposisie gebly. Geen simptome van B. cinerea verrotting het by emge van die blaarposisies van die lote, met fenhexamid gespuit, ontwikkel nie. Die spuit van die lote met fenhexamid het die B. cinerea infeksie en die simptoomontwikkeling op beide die ongeïnokuleerde en geïnokuleerde bloeiwyses heeltemalonderdruk. By die geïnokuleerde lote, het B. cinerea vanaf ongeveer 50 % van die laterale in die waterspoelbehandeling ontwikkel, alhoewel, bloeiwyses wat in water afgespoel is, heeltemal asimptomaties gebly het. Laboratoriumstudies het getoon dat fungisiedes, indien korrek toegedien op lote en trosse onder gekontroleerde toestande, tot effektiewe vermindering van B. cinerea getalle by die verskillende posisies op blare en bloeiwyses lei, en infeksie en simptoomuitdrukking tydens blom voorkom. Weens die feit dat die doelwitte nie behaal kan word in wingerde waar die fungisiede deur konvensionele spuitmetodes toegedien is nie, moet meer studies gedoen word om fungisied toedieningstegnieke, by konvensionele spuitmetodes, VIr deeglike fungisiedbedekking en die vermindering van B. cinerea in trosse, te evalueer...|$|E
40|$|Published data {{revealed}} that Tagetes spp. suppress polyphagous endoparasitic root nematodes, {{that the effect}} varies, perhaps between Tagetes spp. and cultivars, certainly between nematode genera and perhaps between species and strains. The effect is sometimes striking but the picture in general is far from complete and not clear. This situation determined the three objectives of our investigation: occurrence and significance of Tagetes effect, interpretation, and possibilities of application in agriculture. For most of the trials plants were cultivated under controlled and field conditions, and their growth evaluated; nematode populations were collected, cultivated, maintained and transferred; nematodes in soil and plant tissues were counted and results were analysed statistically. Several special techniques were used occasionally as indicated in the relevant sections. The occurrence and significance of special Tagetes effects on plant nematode population were determined with species of Pratylenchus, Meloidogyne, Tylenchorhynchus, Rotylenchus and Helicotylenchus, other ectoparasitic nematodes, Ditylenchus and Aphelenchoides. Pratylenchus spp. were markedly suppressed by Tagetes spp. in tube cultures (Tables 1 - 5) and in field trials (Tables 6 and 7, Figs 1 and 2). This was true for P. penetrans, P. crenatus, P. neglectus and probably P. thornei. Soil type may be of influence on the result. There were great differences in effectiveness between Tagetes spp. and cultivars. The effectiveness against Pratylenchus spp. decreases in the order T. patula, T. erecta, T. minuta, with T. patula markedly better. T. patula Harmony suppresses field populations of Pratylenchus spp. {{in a few months}} and fallow requires a few years to reach a comparable low final density of these nematodes. Density never fell to zero, probably because of limited reproduction on weeds and limited reproduction on Tagetes itself if it is grown for a full season. There was no evidence that resistance of Tagetes was broken or that nematode strains resistant to Tagetes effects arose even after 7 - 10 successive crops of T. patula. Biennial rotations of T. patula and good hosts kept Pratylenchus spp. at a low density, except the population of P. thornei on heavy soil which fluctuated at a rather high level (Fig. 2). Tagetes spp. were generally as effective or better than fallow in suppressing Meloidogyne spp. in tube cultures (Tables 8 - 12), although with some notable exceptions. Meloidogyne larvae were less persistent than Pratylenchus larvae in fallow soil. T. patula severely suppressed M. hapla, M. incognita, M. arenaria and M. javanica. T. erecta was also suppressive but slightly more syncytia formed in all four Meloidogyne spp.; M. hapla reproduced and maintained a small population on T. erecta. T. minuta differed markedly from the earlier species in that it suppressed M. hapla and M. incognita completely and M. javanica almost completely, whereas M. arenaria could breed on this plant and reach considerable densities in both roots and soil. Any general effect by Tagetes on Meloidogyne is therefore complicated by certain exceptions which may account for conflicting published results. Tube and field trials showed that Tylenchorhynchus spp. were suppressed by T. patula in different soils (Table 7), that Tyl. dubius was suppressed better and more rapidly by T. patula than by fallow (Fig. 3 A, B; literature), and that T. erecta and T. minuta were about as effective as T. patula against Tyl. dubius (Table 6). Tyl. dubius was suppressed slightly less effectively and less rapidly than Pratylenchus spp. in the same soil by T. patulaThe data on R. robustus supports the view that Tagetes spp., at any rate T. patula Golden Harmony and Harmony, maintains a rather high density. Unexplained peaks of the density under Tagetes and fallow make it difficult to indicate any Tagetes effect at all; factors other than the presence of higher plants may govern the population dynamics of this species. The genera Hemicycliophora, Paratylenchus and Trichodorus are not generally suppressed by Tagetes cultivars. Specific host-nematode relationships may vary as widely {{as is the case with}} these nematodes on other plants, and no special Tagetes effect can be demonstrated against these ectoparasites. Some species breed profusely on certain Tagetes spp. but are not affected by other Tagetes spp. The stem nematode D. dipsaci may reproduce to a limited extent and cause typical symptoms in T. patula and T. erecta, but not in T. minuta. The same is true for the foliar nematode A. ritzemabosi (Plate 1 A and B). The data leave no doubt that certain Tagetes spp. suppress certain species of plant nematodes unusually strongly. The Tagetes effect manifested itself most clearly with Pratylenchus spp., Meloidogyne spp. and Tyl. dubius, but was evidently not present or not marked against R. robustus and several other ectoparasitic genera, nor against D. dipsaci and A. ritzemabosi. The results alone or combined with published data do not fully explain the mechanism. For a further analysis the exoradicular effects, the effects on the surface of the plant or during penetration, and the endoradicular effects were subsequently studied. Exoradicular effects may contribute to, but not explain the larger part of the Tagetes effect. As with the good host red clover, P. penetrans is not particularly attracted nor deterred by growing roots of T. patula on agar plates, but there was some aggregation around the roots in soil (Table 14), though it concerned only part of the soil population (Fig. 5). Percolates from pots of T. patula, red clover, apple or without a plant did not differ in effect on activity or mortality of P. penetrans in vitro. Survival of P. penetrans in water cultures of T. patula and T. minuta was only slightly less than in water culture of apple, control solution or distilled water, and the effect was at any rate slight and unspecific (Table 15). Tagetes soil was distinctly nematicidal for some days after the roots have been removed. This effect, however, was not very strong and was not specific for Tagetes, because red clover was equally and apple even more effective than T. patula and T. minuta (Table 16). Damage or kill of nematodes outside the root may therefore play a role, but it is apparently not the essential part of the Tagetes effect. Root systems of three different Tagetes spp. were penetrated by M. hapla larvae as much as root systems of a suitable host. The same holds for penetration by P. penetrans, except perhaps for T. patula which fewer nematodes entered than other Tagetes spp. or good hosts in most trials (Table 17). As a rule only a few of the larvae around the roots succeed in penetrating. Endoradicular influences comprise nematode survival and development, nematicidal effects and histological reactions in Tagetes tissues. M. hapla larvae enter Tagetes spp. to the same amount as tomato within a week. Only a few of the larvae around the roots succeed, although potential sites for penetration are present in excess. The unsuccessful nematodes outside the root decrease rapidly in number, more rapidly in the presence of growing plants than in fallow soil, which may be important for the population dynamics of nematodes in general. M. hapla survives for at least 4 weeks within roots of Tagetes spp., but development beyond the infective second larval stage is hardly noticeable in T. patula and T. minuta, whereas only a few larvae develop and reach adulthood in T. erecta (Table 18). The picture is similar with P. penetrans. The percentage penetration is generally low in all plants, but significantly lower in T. patula than in T. erecta, T. minuta or red clover (Table 19, Fig. 6). T. patula may resist penetration by this nematode The main difference between a suitable host such as red clover, and T. patula is that nematodes reproduce in the first plant and decline or remain few in T. patula. In T. minuta the nematodes survive and may even develop and multiply, though at slower rate than in red clover (Figs. 6, 7 and 8). T. patula, T. minuta and red clover represent degrees of host suitability from almost zero through low to very high (Fig. 7, Table 20). The equilibrium density under T. patula is very low but not zero because some reproduction occurs when the plants have grown a long while. The percentage males among the sexually differentiated nematodes is not higher in the very resistant T. patula and does not increase with ageing of host plants, as has often been published. T. patula allows very little escape or survival of P. penetrans once the nematodes have entered the roots, whereas the population in T. minuta roots does escape and may be infective as in suitable hosts (Tables 21 and 22). Root extracts of Tagetes spp., contrary to root exudates, contain a nematicidal principle which manifests itself against P. penetrans in vitro from the third day on (Fig. 9 A, B, C). Extract of T. patula is more effective than extract of T. minuta and the latter is more effective than extract of potato or control solutions. Fractioning of root extracts of T. patula over a column of Sephadex G- 75 indicate high mortality in a later fraction. No attempt was made to identify the active principle(s) in this fraction. This effect in vitro may be related to the Tagetes effect on nematodes in soil. It may be caused by the nematicides such as the thiophenes isolated from Tagetes roots by Uhlenbroek & Bijloo (1958, 1959). There was some nematode kill in potato root extract too, distinctly less than in Tagetes extract but distinctly higher than in the control solutions. This indicates the presence of a weak nematicidal effect in potato root extract and may support the indication recorded earlier that plants establish or induce in general an "antinemic potential" by means of their exudates or other substances in water or soil. The Tagetes effects are much stronger and evidently differ from it. Histological reactions as part of the endoradicular influences of Tagetes on penetrated nematodes are not conspicuous. Tagetes cultures, unlike most other plants, normally grow well and have well-developed root systems without discoloration in soils with dense populations of Meloidogyne and Pratylenchus spp. Despite this healthy appearance Tagetes roots may show barely visible histological reactions after such nematode infestations. M. hapla larvae penetrate the root apex of T. patula in much the same way as that of tomato. They do not normally develop nor cause marked necrosis or swelling in the roots of T. patula. Occasionally, however, small syncytia or sometimes even small galls occur associated with a developing larva. Unlike tomato, T. patula develops few and very small syncytia and galls and only slowly, and the nematode often dies and syncytia often abort in T. patula. P. penetrans penetrates young roots of T. patula, T. minuta and red clover at random sites on their surface except at the apex and causes cortical lesions in all three plants. The lesions in T. patula are small, dark and necrotic but do not abort from surrounding cortex tissue; they normally harbour only 1 - 3 nematodes, often dead, dying or twisted. In T. minuta the lesions appear slower, are larger and less dark than in T. patula; the number of nematodes per lesion may be up to 38 and often occur outside lesions. Red clover lesions appear still slower, are usually larger and contain a large breeding population. Histological reactions, therefore, largely coincide with nematode development. The endoradicular effects are apparently instrumental in the nematode suppression by Tagetes spp. They are incorporated in or super-imposed upon the common plant-nematode relationships which are different for each association and may therefore influence the result. It is suggested that the special nematicidal principle in Tagetes is made up of more components, of which thiophenes recorded up to now from T. erecta, and that the components or their relative weights vary between Tagetes spp. Some other Compositae related closely to Tagetes spp. were also found to be effective against P. penetrans and also contained the same thiophenes as found in Tagetes or hitherto unidentified active principles. T. patula is probably superior to other Tagetes spp. in its effect against P. penetrans because necrosis appears earlier and more acutely. This may be a consequence of more rapid intoxication of the nematodes, as in root extracts. Ectoparasitic cortex feeders of the genus Tylenchorynchus are affected less and root-vessel feeders are evidently not influenced by the nematicidal principles in Tagetes roots, probably because they do not undergo the same type or degree of contact with the Tagetes tissue. The Tagetes effect, therefore, seems to be generally strong for endoparasitic root nematodes or cortical feeders, but varies even within this group with the different plant-nematode associations. The agricultural value of Tagetes as a source of organic matter, stains, therapeutics, or other chemicals, and as ornamentals is limited and has up to now supported only small-scale cultivation. The use of Tagetes crops for suppression of plant nematodes and the marked growth improvement obtained in main crops, is handicapped by the lack of value of the crop. Furthermore Tagetes spp. and cultivars are limited in their agricultural applicability. Nematode suppression is the primary determinant of their practical value so that T. patula particularly the cultivars Golden Harmony or Harmony are recommended. They are more effective against Pratylenchus and at least as effective against Meloidogyne populations, and appear to be as good or better than other Tagetes cultivars for growing and handling as a crop. Seed characteristics, rapid development as an autumn crop and winter-hardiness could all be improved, whereas a search for profitable use of the crop is desirable. Breeding of Tagetes spp. have resulted in a great assortment of ornamentals, and prospects seem good for the plant breeder of combining strong nematicidal effect with useful agricultural properties. The desired characters will depend on the type of agriculture. Tagetes grown as a full-season crop has been found effective by several workers and may cause striking growth and yield increments, it may find use in areas where valuable main crops are grown and where land rent is low, as in some tropical and subtropical countries. Tagetes as a spring crop does not seem promising in temperate climates due to its slow seedling growth. Even when sown densely, 10 cm apart on 15 May, minimum densities of Pratylenchus could be achieved only after about 2 months; these densities appear later when greater plant distances are taken (Fig. 10). Tagetes grown as an autumn crop has better possibilities. The degree of development of autumn Tagetes is evidently critical for its effect, and this varies strongly from year to year. Autumn Tagetes may be very effective in nematode suppression as well as in yield increase of main plants in certain years (Tables 23, 24 and 25), but the earliest sowing dates after an <b>early</b> <b>pea</b> crop varied in the period 1961 - 1968 from 6 July to 14 August, and a good development was obtained in only 4 out of 8 years (Table 6). Continuous autumn Tagetes, however, may be effective despite failure in certain years. Autumn Tagetes should be sown not later than the end of July and 10 rather than 25 cm apart is advisable. Simultaneous culture of Tagetes with a main crop appeared to be effective around and between trees and woody ornamentals and may be promising in more cases, especially since sowing at 60 cm apart completely suppressed nematodes, though slower than when closer sown. Sowing between rows is practized incidentally (Plate IIC and D). Sowing under cereals and other high crops to give the crop a quicker start after harvesting the main crop has not so far been promising, because only few weak plants survived. Autumn application after a main crop and application between rows of a main crop may be promising under certain conditions. The technical possibilities increase when climatic conditions allow a better growth in the autumn or when agricultural systems allow a full-season crop. Yield of main crops after Tagetes may be increased by nematological or other growth factors or both. Tagetes promoted growth of apple seedlings in soil with P. penetrans to 167 % of fallow infested soil, though Tagetes decreased growth in uninfested soil; allowance for the nitrogen used by Tagetes would lead to a higher growth promotion in infested soil (Table 27). The decline in nematode population continued markedly after the growth of Tagetes had been disrupted by removal of the tops. Direct mulch with a natural dosage of Tagetes roots suppresses P. penetrans much better than other mulches or fallow. It is probable that there is a significant aftereffect also under field conditions. Leaf mulches were also effective in suppressing P. penetrans, but Tagetes leaves were less effective than apple and no specific nematicidal effect of Tagetes leaves could be demonstrated. The results in uninfested soil show that cultivation of Tagetes and removal of tops decreases soil fertility in unfertilized soil (Table 27). The addition of root or leaf mulch generally increases soil fertility and therefore growth of test plants (Tables 30, 31, 32). These effects, however, are unspecific, and would have been smaller in fertilized soils, uninfested or infested. The dominance of nematicidal over non- nematicidal effects of Tagetes is clear for the growth of apple seedlings in soil infested with P. penetrans. The relative weight of these factors may of course be different in other plant nematode relationships. Our results, therefore, confirm or substantiate the marked Tagetes effect, but also the variation between plant-nematode relationships. The Tagetes effect is exceptional in nature, though not completely restricted to the genus Tagetes because it does occur in some genera ofthe Heleniae. The effect appears to be centred inside the roots and is evidently correlated with the presence in these plants of strongly nematicidal thiophenes, which are rare elsewhere in nature. The fact that it is conspicuous against endoparasitic polyphagous root nematodes and not against epidermal and vessel feeders is understandable from the difference in parasitic way of life. Histopathological reactions to nematode invasion vary between Tagetes spp. This may explain the stronger effect of T. patula on P. penetrans than of other Tagetes spp. The concept of nematode intoxication by nematicidal thiophenes and histopathological resistance phenomena may be interrelated and are not necessarily contradictory. Use of Tagetes spp. often markedly increases yield of main crops, but is limited by type of agriculture. In temperate regions Tagetes grown simultaneously with the main crop or grown in the autumn after the main crop is considered promising. Slow seedling growth, high light requirement and frost susceptibility of available cultivars are disadvantages. Tagetes has better prospects in tropical and subtropical agriculture...|$|E

40|$|Time {{course of}} {{reversed}} cardiac remodeling after pulmonary endarterectomy {{in patients with}} chronic pulmonary thromboembolism Abstract To evaluate {{the time course of}} reversed remodeling after pulmo-nary endarterectomy (PEA) in patients with chronic thromboembolic pulmo-nary hypertension(CTPEH), we stud-ied 22 patients (age: 60 ± 13 years) with MRI immediately before, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months after PEA. MRI included assessment of biventricular function, aortic and pul-monary artery(PA) flow, and right ventricular (RV) overload using the ratio of RV-to-biventricular diameter. Except in one patient, who died 2 months post-surgery, clinical im-provement occurred <b>early</b> after <b>PEA</b> (NYHA class: 3. 3 ± 0. 6 to 1. 5 ± 0. 8, p< 0. 0001) with a decrease of systolic pulmonary artery pressures (79 ± 14 to 44 ± 14 mmHg, p< 0. 0001). At 1 month post PEA, RV end-diastolic volumes decreased (198 ± 72 to 137 ± 59 ml, p< 0. 0001), and the RVejection fraction (EF) improved (31 ± 9 to 47 ± 10 %, p< 0. 0001). No further signifi-cant improvement in pulmonary pres-sures or RV function occurred at 3 months or 6 months. Although no significant change was found in LV volumes or function, aortic flow increased <b>early</b> after surgery. <b>PEA</b> had only a beneficial effect on right PA flow. RV overload decreased <b>early</b> after <b>PEA</b> (ratio RV-to-biventricular diameter: before: 0. 67 ± 0. 04, after: 0. 54 ± 0. 06, p< 0. 0001), showing a good correlation with the improve-ment in RVEF (r= 0. 7, P< 0. 0001). In conclusion, reversed cardiac remodel-ing occurs <b>early</b> after <b>PEA,</b> to slow down after 1 month. At 6 months, cardiac remodeling is incomplete as witnessed by low-normal RV function and residually elevated PA pressures...|$|R

In producer fields, kochia (Kochia scoparia L. Schrad.) and wild buckwheat, (Polygonum convolvulus L.) were also investigated. Seed shatter was assessed using shatter trays collected once a week during crop ripening stage, as well as at two crop harvest stages (swathing, direct-combining). In the small-plot experiments, seed shatter differed among weed species, but was similar between field pea and wheat at maturity: ca. 30 % for wild oat, 5 % for cleavers, < 2 % for wild mustard, and < 1 % for green foxtail. Similar results were observed in producer fields: 22 - 30 % for wild oat, and generally < 10 % for the other species.

Deletion of 28 amino acids from the C-terminus of the coat protein abolished the formation of virus particles. Deletion of 15 amino acids at the C-terminus did not affect particle formation but did abolish nematode transmission. In contrast, deletion of 13 amino acids immediately preceding the 16 C-terminal residues did not affect particle formation and decreased rather than abolished nematode transmission. A deletion in the gene encoding a 29 -kDa protein and a frameshift mutation in the gene encoding a 23 -kDa protein both abolished transmission without affecting virus particle formation.

Removal of the AUG initiation codon from the 9 K ORF had no effect on transmission, whereas the introduction of a frameshift mutation, which would prematurely terminate expression of the putative 9 -kDa protein, decreased the frequency of transmission.

In pea, Pisum sativum, a Virus Induced Gene Silencing System using the <b>pea</b> <b>early</b> browning virus has been converted into an efficient agroinfection system by converting the two RNA genomes of the virus into binary expression vectors for Agrobacterium transformation. Results By vacuum infiltration (0. 08 Mpa, 1 min) of germinating pea seeds with 2 - 3 cm roots with Agrobacteria carrying the binary vectors, expression of the gene for Green Fluorescent Protein as marker and the gene for the human acidic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF) was obtained in 80 % of the infiltrated developing seedlings. Maximal production of the recombinant proteins was achieved 12 - 15 days after infiltration. Conclusions Compared to the leaf injection method vacuum infiltration of germinated seeds is highly efficient allowing large scale production of plants transiently expressing recombinant proteins. The production cycle of plants for harvesting the recombinant protein was shortened from 30 days for leaf injection to 15 days by applying vacuum infiltration.
