However, Flame Princess, {{confused}} by Finn's aversion to fire, assumes that he merely wants to taunt her. She ventures to the Goblin Kingdom, intent on turning <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> new domain. Finn and Jake, meanwhile, return to the tree fort and, with the help of N.E.P.T.R. (voiced by Andy Milonakis), build flame-retardant battle robots.|$|E
5|$|A {{music video}} was filmed {{for the song}} and {{directed}} by Melina Matsoukas. There are {{two versions of the}} video— one intercut with clips from the ABC series Dirty Sexy Money and created to promote the show, and another which is the official video. The video is set in a mansion, and starts with Gaga making her way down a hallway with several people who are either walking behind her, holding an umbrella over her, dancing in front of her, or tossing dollar bills around her. Gaga and company are then featured in many repeatedly-changing shots at various locations in the mansion. She is seen lying seductively on a table covered with money, crawling along a black grand piano and striking the keys with her leg several times, dancing around and later making out with a statue, and dancing in an elevator solo. There are also several close-up shots of her burning money and later stuffing <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> mouth. Over the course of the video, she undergoes numerous costume changes. Singer-songwriter Space Cowboy is also shown, most notably in scenes where he climbs a wall.|$|E
5|$|MacFarlane {{notes that}} he was {{surprised}} {{they were allowed to}} do the pickle gag, which consisted of Stewie placing a cucumber on the sofa where Patrick's imaginary wife is sitting, but inserting <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> imaginary vagina (to see if it would turn into a pickle), but suggests that maybe broadcasting standards did not fully understand the scene. The music song by the overweight people at a funeral for a murdered obese man was only shown on the DVD version and not televised, for timing purposes, and for potential boredom to viewers. The musical composition was recorded at Fox studios on the Gary Numan stage. George W. Bush is portrayed hiding in a tree house and being informed by Brian of Hurricane Katrina. Bush was offered the opportunity to voice himself, but declined.|$|E

25|$|Dido's Cave {{is little}} more than an alcove, {{probably}} built in the 1720s, originally decorated with a painting of Dido and Aeneas. In c.1781 the facade was decorated with tufa by the Marchioness of Buckingham. Her son the 1st Duke of Buckingham turned <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> memorial by adding the inscription Mater Amata, Vale! (Farewell beloved Mother). The designer is unknown.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} psychological {{affect on}} Hilde was the coercion {{to embody the}} patriarchal fascist belief system {{of the time and}} to inculcate <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> own personal identity. She was made to feel inferior and submissive, but also encouraged to never exclude herself from a group. This personal type of fascism aided in the rally of Austrian youth to support the Nazi cause during the Mühlviertler Hasenjagd. Many years after the period of National Socialism, it was still difficult for Hilde to extricate herself from this pattern of thinking. As an adult, she still felt extreme anxiety about being excluded from groups and events.|$|E
25|$|After her 1886–87 tour, Bernhardt recuperated on Belle-Île, a {{small island}} off the coast of Brittany, 10 miles south of the Quiberon peninsula. She {{purchased}} a ruined 17th-century fortress, located {{at the end of the}} island and approached by a drawbridge, and turned <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> vacation retreat. Between 1886 and 1922, she spent nearly every summer, the season when her theater was closed, on Belle-Île. She built bungalows for her son Maurice and her grandchildren, and bungalows with studios for her close friends, the painters Georges Clairin and Louise Abbéma. She also took with her her large collection of animals, including several dogs, two horses, a donkey, a hawk given to her by the Russian Grand Duke Alexis, an Andean wildcat, and a boa constrictor she had brought back from her tour of South America. She entertained many visitors at Belle-Île, including King Edward VII, who stopped by the island on a cruise aboard the royal yacht. Always wrapped in white scarves, she played tennis (under house rules that required that she be the winner) and cards, read plays, and created sculptures and ornaments in her studio. When the fishermen of the island suffered a bad season, she organized a benefit performance with leading actors to raise funds for them. She gradually enlarged the estate, purchasing a neighboring hotel and all the land with a view of the property, but in 1922, as her health declined, she abruptly sold it and never returned. During the Second World War, the Germans occupied the island, and in October 1944, before leaving the island, they dynamited most of the compound. All that remains is the original old fort, and a seat cut into the rock where Bernhardt awaited the boat that took her to the mainland.|$|E

500|$|Her {{influence}} {{with the public}} was again demonstrated when sales of Riesling wine increased by 30% in the UK after she had incorporated <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> Coq au Riesling recipe on Nigella Express. In December 2007 she appeared on BBC's The Graham Norton Show and revealed that she had once eaten 30 pickled eggs for a £1,000 bet, saying [...] "How stupid to challenge me! I made them all put their {{money on the table}} in front of me. The next day I had scrambled eggs for breakfast." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{suborder}} Salamandroidea {{contains the}} advanced salamanders. They {{differ from the}} cryptobranchids by having fused prearticular bones in the lower jaw, and by using internal fertilisation. In salamandrids, the male deposits a bundle of sperm, the spermatophore, and the female {{picks it up and}} inserts <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> cloaca where the sperm is stored until the eggs are laid. The largest family in this group is Plethodontidae, the lungless salamanders, which includes 60% of all salamander species. The family Salamandridae includes the true salamanders and the name [...] "newt" [...] is given to members of its subfamily Pleurodelinae.|$|E
500|$|Paskin {{also wrote}} that [...] "Peacock" [...] could perhaps {{be the most}} {{outrageous}} example of an entirely obvious double entendre. Perry herself has considered {{it to be the}} biggest innuendo in the world. During an interview with MTV News, the singer said that she is a fan of using puns and double entendres and often looks for ways to incorporate <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> material. In the song, Perry repeatedly asks to see their peacock, if they are [...] "brave enough" [...] to do so. Its composition was compared to Toni Basil's cheerleader anthem [...] "Mickey" [...] by many reviews as both songs are stomping jams, bursting with double meanings.|$|E

Oh, you needn't try to dupe me!" [...] she cried. [...] "I want my money--God knows how I want it! And I mean to make her suffer, too!" [...] she added, {{pointing}} to Winifred.

500|$|In 1973, {{while still}} grieving {{the loss of}} her daughter, Rice took a {{previously}} written short story and turned <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> first novel, the bestselling Interview with the Vampire. She based her vampires on Gloria Holden's character in Dracula's Daughter: [...] "It established to me what vampires were—these elegant, tragic, sensitive people. I was really just going with that feeling when writing Interview With the Vampire. I didn't do a lot of research." [...] After completing the novel and following many rejections from publishers, Rice developed obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD). She became obsessed with germs, thinking that she contaminated everything she touched, engaged in frequent and obsessive hand washing and obsessively checked locks on windows and doors. Of this period, Rice says, [...] "What you see when you're in that state is every single flaw in our hygiene and you can't control it and you go crazy." ...|$|E
500|$|In Lauper's first {{effort at}} {{writing for the}} stage, she found that it {{required}} a sustained effort to write songs for the different characters. [...] Lauper joked about the difficulty of writing her first score: [...] "How much of a stretch is it for me to write songs about fashion, funny relationships, people changing their minds and shoes?" [...] The first song that Lauper wrote was the opening number, which included {{a wide range of}} voices. Her process was to conceive a song and sing <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> iPhone, and orchestrator Stephen Oremus would write it down. Oremus would then [...] "'blow up' the vocal line into harmonies, create the incidental music that linked scenes and songs" [...] and orchestrate the material. The songs range in style [...] "from pop to funk to new wave to tango, with highly personal lyrics". [...] New York Times critic Melena Ryzik wrote: [...] "Though there are plenty of hooky, rousing numbers, the emotional heart of Kinky Boots is several ballads about the weight of parental expectations." [...] The musical uses a twelve-piece orchestra consisting of keyboards, percussion, bass, guitars, reeds, violin, viola, cello, trumpet, and trombone.|$|E
500|$|Drury {{commanded}} Neptune for {{the next}} two years, until his promotion to rear-admiral in 1804. He departed the ship on 13 May 1804, and the following day Captain Sir Thomas Williams took over. Neptune spent the rest of 1804 deployed with the Channel Fleet, blockading the French Atlantic ports. During this time Captain Williams' health progressively worsened, and he was invalided back to Britain on 7 May 1805. He was replaced by Captain Thomas Fremantle on 8 May, and was sent to join Robert Calder's force blockading Ferrol, after the Franco-Spanish fleet had arrived there after the Battle of Cape Finisterre. Calder decided that his eight ships were not sufficient to resist Villeneuve's fleet were it to come out of harbour, and instead went north to join Admiral William Cornwallis's fleet off Brest. Shortly afterwards Nelson's fleet returned from the West Indies, bringing 12 more ships, and Calder was given 18 ships, including Neptune, and sent back to Ferrol to search for Villeneuve. By now Villeneuve had put into Cadiz and Calder's force was ordered to join the hastily assembled British fleet under Vice-Admiral Cuthbert Collingwood, that was blockading the Franco-Spanish fleet at Cadiz. As the British fleet settled in for a long blockade Fremantle commented on Neptunes sailing qualities. She had the reputation of being slow, and Fremantle complained that he did not like being in 'a large ship that don't sail and must continually be late in action.' During the battle however, Midshipman William Baddock commented that 'The old Neptune, which never was a good sailer, took <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> head that morning to sail better than I ever remember to have seen her do before.' Neptune [...] went into the battle 18 men short of her complement.|$|E

2500|$|The [...] "lady" [...] {{is shown}} {{a number of}} silks and brocades {{possibly}} suitable for her wedding dress, into which she inserts {{a small piece of}} cloth and then removes it, sticking <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> kimono. Noticed by Kōbei, she is accused of stealing, and a scuffle erupts. Rikimaru (as the lady's retainer) manages finally to mediate, {{with the help of the}} shop's neighbor and a few others. He shows a receipt from another shop for the scrap of fabric, proving it was not stolen from the Hamamatsu-ya. In the course of the fighting however, the [...] "lady" [...] suffered a blow to her head, for which Rikimaru then demands 100 ryō as recompense. As the pair prepare to leave with their illicit gains, however, a man by the name of Tamashima Ittō (Nippon Daemon in disguise) emerges from the backroom and points Kozō out, noting that the cherry blossom tattoo peeking out under his sleeves reveals him as a man.|$|E
2500|$|In 1996, Hayden Ebbern, Sean Mulligan and Barry Beyerstein {{visited the}} Medical Center to {{investigate}} the story. They placed a tennis shoe on the same ledge and discovered that the shoe was visible from within the building and could have easily been observed by a patient lying in bed. They also discovered the shoe was easily observable from outside the building and suggested that Maria may have overheard a comment about it during her three {{days in the hospital}} and incorporated <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> OBE. They concluded [...] "Maria's story merely reveals the naiveté and the power of wishful thinking" [...] from OBE researchers seeking a paranormal explanation. Clark did not publish the description of the case until seven years after it happened, casting doubt on the story. Richard Wiseman has said that although the story is not evidence for anything paranormal it has been [...] "endlessly repeated by writers who either couldn’t be bothered to check the facts, or were unwilling to present their readers with the more skeptical side of the story." ...|$|E
2500|$|All {{occupants}} of the ground floor were seriously injured. In the first-floor corridor, some occupants decided to {{lie down on the}} ground to show that they offered no resistance. Nonetheless, police beat them and kicked them when they arrived. Soon, there were police officers on all four floors of the building, kicking and battering prone occupants. In one corridor, police ordered a group of young men and women to kneel, so that they could batter them around the head and shoulders more easily. Here, Daniel Albrecht, a 21-year-old cello student from Berlin, had his head beaten so badly that he needed surgery to stop bleeding in his brain. The police also used humiliation to cow the {{occupants of}} the school. An officer who stood spread-legged in front of a kneeling and injured woman, grabbed his groin and thrust <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> face. Another who paused amid the beatings and took a knife to cut off hair from his victims, including Nicola Doherty; the constant shouting of insults; the officer who asked a group if they were OK and who reacted to the one who said [...] "No" [...] by handing out an extra beating.|$|E

2500|$|Stronger {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 62, based on 11 reviews. Mikael Wood of Spin wrote that, although [...] "Stronger isn't Clarkson's long-promised Nashville album", she [...] "delivers tunes like 'Einstein' and the disco-glam title track {{with a country}} singer's earthy conviction." [...] Melissa Maerz of Entertainment Weekly dubbed it Clarkson's [...] "older-better-tougher-smarter album" [...] and complimented the songs' [...] "finger-wagging, rafter-reaching power". Allison Stewart of The Washington Post wrote that [...] "Clarkson has two moods — scrappy and morose — and Stronger works every possible combination of both", and called it [...] "a good album by a great vocalist who, it’s easy to still hope, is capable of a lot more." [...] AllMusic's senior editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine attributed the album's success [...] "entirely" [...] to Clarkson, [...] "whose personality and professionalism turn <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> best album since her Breakaway breakthrough in 2004". Jon Caramanica of The New York Times asserted that [...] "Ms. Clarkson is turning into the Mary J. Blige of pop: so good at being wounded that {{no one wants to}} let her heal." [...] Slant Magazines Jonathan Keefe felt that, with the exception of [...] "Mr. Know It All"s [...] "obvious electronic manipulation", Clarkson's performances are [...] "more consistently lived-in and evocative than on any of her previous efforts." ...|$|E
