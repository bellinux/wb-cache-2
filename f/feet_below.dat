5|$|Sometimes the sap was a tunnel, dug several <b>feet</b> <b>below</b> the surface. Sappers {{were highly}} skilled and highly paid {{due to the}} extreme danger of their work.|$|E
5|$|Like all blackwater {{streams in}} Florida, {{the color of}} most of the St. Johns is black, owing to the tannins in leaf litter and {{decaying}} aquatic plants. Spring fed streams, on the other hand, are remarkably clear and visibility is very high, even when the river bottom is dozens of <b>feet</b> <b>below.</b>|$|E
5|$|At least 200 people fell or {{jumped to}} their deaths from the burning towers (as {{exemplified}} in the photograph The Falling Man), landing {{on the streets and}} rooftops of adjacent buildings hundreds of <b>feet</b> <b>below.</b> Some occupants of each tower above the point of impact made their way toward the roof in hope of helicopter rescue, but the roof access doors were locked. No plan existed for helicopter rescues, and the combination of roof equipment and thick smoke and intense heat prevented helicopters from approaching.|$|E
50|$|Bharadvājāsana I is {{the basic}} {{variation}} in which the legs articulated as in vīrāsana dropped to one side {{one foot on the}} floor and the other's ankle cradled in the arch of the <b>foot</b> <b>below.</b>|$|R
50|$|The pitch remains lively as the water-level {{is unusually}} high in Lahli. At places water is found only {{two to four}} <b>foot</b> <b>below</b> the ground, and that helps in keeping the pitch and outfield green.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Ribbed-shelled Oncomelania hupensis hupensis. The ribs on {{the shell}} and varix {{surrounding}} the aperture are clearly visible, {{and a pair}} of eyes {{and a pair of}} tentacles are also visible on the head, with a strong contour of the <b>foot</b> <b>below.</b>|$|R
5|$|San Marcos {{was used}} for gunnery {{practice}} throughout World War II, although generally as an anchor for a canvas target screen. Sitting two to six <b>feet</b> <b>below</b> the surface and marked by an unlit buoy, she {{was responsible for the}} sinking of the cargo ship Lexington in 1940 following a collision. Tons of explosives were used to demolish her upperworks and drive her hull deep into the mud; by January 1959, they were successful and she remains there today.|$|E
5|$|December 18, 1990: A Greyhound bus left Salt Lake City for Chicago {{and became}} entrenched in a driving {{snowstorm}} on I-80. Just {{short of the}} Wyoming border, the bus {{was hit by a}} semi-tractor trailer that had crossed the median heading the opposite direction. The force of the collision tipped the bus onto its right side and steered it down a steep embankment. The bus slid for 150 feet and came to rest against a fence, about 35 <b>feet</b> <b>below</b> the eastbound lanes of I-80. 7 passengers were killed and more than 40 injured.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began on}} April 25, 2011, in Albuquerque, New Mexico, with the working title Group Hug. In June 2011, stuntman Jeremy Fitzgerald injured his head while attempting a stunt involving a 30-foot fall from a building after {{getting hit by}} an arrow. A Marvel spokesperson later told TMZ.com that despite the injury, Fitzgerald recovered and continued working on set. The following month, secondary filming took place about an hour outside Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in the Butler area. A chase sequence was also shot in Worthington, Pennsylvania at Creekside Mushroom Farms, the world's largest single-site mushroom farm, which provided 150 miles of abandoned limestone tunnels 300 <b>feet</b> <b>below</b> the ground for filming.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I don't at all doubt,' said Mrs. Woodward, 'that {{if we were}} to get a sly peep at you, {{we should}} find you both sitting comfortably at your inn all the time, and that neither of you will go a <b>foot</b> <b>below</b> the ground.' ...|$|R
60|$|I {{had been}} saved by being prompt; the dirk had struck not half a <b>foot</b> <b>below</b> me as I pursued my upward flight; and there stood Israel Hands {{with his mouth}} open and his face upturned to mine, a perfect statue of {{surprise}} and disappointment.|$|R
60|$|Dick was {{surprised}} by the fellow's persistence, but there is a fascination in shooting at a target, and when Jake urged him he took the pistol. Steadying it with stiffened wrist and forearm, he fired but hit the post a <b>foot</b> <b>below</b> the paper.|$|R
5|$|The {{subway station}} at Porter is, at 105 <b>feet</b> <b>below</b> ground level, the deepest in the MBTA system. Porter's unusual depth {{is due to}} the MBTA's {{decision}} to build the station in bedrock rather than soft clay, saving time and money in the construction process. Passengers reach Red Line platforms via a series of escalators, stairs totalling 199 steps, or a set of elevators. The longest single span of the escalators is 143feet, the longest in the MBTA system. In 2005, a man was killed when his sweatshirt tangled {{in the bottom of the}} escalator.|$|E
5|$|Wichita {{continued}} to provide gunfire support {{throughout the rest}} of the month. On 27 April, a small caliber shell penetrated a fuel oil tank five <b>feet</b> <b>below</b> the waterline. After temporary repairs while still off Okinawa proved unsuccessful, Wichita returned to Kerama Retto where the damage was repaired on 29–30 April. Wichita then returned to the gun line. On 12 May, the ship was damaged by friendly fire. A 5inch round struck the port aircraft catapult; shell fragments hit the shield of an antiaircraft director, killing one man and injuring eleven others. She departed the area to rest and refit at Leyte, returning to Okinawa on 18 June. Wichita {{continued to}} provide gunfire support to the troops on Okinawa through July, as part of Task Unit 2. On 15 August, the ship's crew received word that the war with Japan was over. Wichita was awarded 13 battle stars for her service during World War II.|$|E
25|$|In Sharky's Machine (1981), Billy Score is {{gunned down}} by Sharky, {{crashing}} {{through a window}} and plummeting to his death 700 <b>feet</b> <b>below.</b>|$|E
60|$|Henery {{appeared}} in a drab kerseymere great-coat, buttoned over his smock-frock, the white skirts of the latter being visible to the distance of about a <b>foot</b> <b>below</b> the coat-tails, which, when you {{got used to the}} style of dress, looked natural enough, and even ornamental--it certainly was comfortable.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is as I thought," [...] he said. [...] "The {{waters of}} the Somme are but a <b>foot</b> <b>below</b> the level of this window; the river is yellow and swollen, and a few hours' heavy rain would bring it above the level of this sill. Stand steady, Ralph, I am coming down again." ...|$|R
2500|$|Phantom poodles {{have the}} {{colouring}} of a Doberman Pinscher, with a lighter color appearing on their [...] "eyebrows", muzzle and throat, legs and <b>feet</b> and <b>below</b> their tail. Like Dobermans, phantom poodles have either a black or brown main coat with a tan (usually apricot or red) lighter colorings around the eyebrows, muzzle, throat, legs, <b>feet,</b> and <b>below</b> their tail.|$|R
25|$|Flood waters were {{released}} through two overflow weirs, 25 meters wide (82 feet), situated 2 meters (6.58 <b>feet)</b> <b>below</b> the crown {{and following the}} slopes of the hillside.|$|E
25|$|Wood's {{pump system}} allowed {{the city to}} drain huge tracts of swamp and {{marshland}} and expand into low-lying areas. Over the 20th century, rapid subsidence, both natural and human-induced, resulted in these newly populated areas declining to several <b>feet</b> <b>below</b> sea level.|$|E
25|$|Each of the {{below ground}} explosions—some {{as deep as}} 5,000 feet—vaporized a large chamber, leaving a cavity filled with {{radioactive}} rubble. About {{a third of the}} tests were conducted directly in aquifers, and others were hundreds or thousands of <b>feet</b> <b>below</b> the water table.|$|E
50|$|The city {{sits on the}} {{southern}} end of the former lake bed of the prehistoric Lake Chicago, and also the current Lake Michigan. Most of the city's soil nearly one <b>foot</b> <b>below</b> the surface is pure sand. The sand beneath Gary, and on its beaches, is of such high quality that in years past it was mined for the manufacture of glass.|$|R
5000|$|The Louw Wepener Decoration is {{a silver}} medallion, 38 millimetres in diameter, which depicts the {{mountain}} peak of Thaba Bosigo, {{with two men}} on horseback at its <b>foot.</b> <b>Below</b> the horsemen are the words [...] "THABA BOSIGO, 1865" [...] and around the circumference are the words [...] "LOUW WEPENER" [...] {{at the top and}} [...] "DECORATION • DEKORASIE" [...] at the bottom.|$|R
5000|$|Phantom poodles {{have the}} {{colouring}} of a Doberman Pinscher, with a lighter color appearing on their [...] "eyebrows", muzzle and throat, legs and <b>feet</b> and <b>below</b> their tail. Like Dobermans, phantom poodles have either a black or brown main coat with a tan (usually apricot or red) lighter colorings around the eyebrows, muzzle, throat, legs, <b>feet,</b> and <b>below</b> their tail.|$|R
25|$|The {{underground}} work of Phase 1 commenced in May 2011. Each corridor {{consists of two}} tunnels, which are the first underground tunnels built for trains in South India. The tunnels, dug using tunnel boring machines (TBM), are located approximately 60 <b>feet</b> <b>below</b> ground level, have a diameter of 5.5 metres and are 5 metres apart.|$|E
25|$|The Caney River {{flows through}} Bartlesville, {{separating}} {{the downtown area}} from the east side. The river flooded in October 1986 {{as a result of}} unusually heavy rainfall. The city was split in half for several days, and the flood caused considerable property damage. The river broke its banks again in June 2007, cresting five <b>feet</b> <b>below</b> the 1986 level.|$|E
25|$|The general grey slate {{and back}} gardens of Plymouth, {{as seen from}} the Great Western made the {{surprise}} of Saltash Bridge all the more exciting. Up and down stream, grey battleships were moored in the Tamar and its reaches. Hundreds of <b>feet</b> <b>below,</b> the pathetic steam ferry to Saltash from the Devon bank tried to compete with Brunel's mighty bridge.|$|E
2500|$|On December 26, 1913, {{the steamer}} Oregona {{collided}} with the anchored barge Champoeg 12 miles upriver from Portland, causing {{a hole in the}} Oregona’s hull. [...] As a result, Oregona filled with water and sank, with the upper deck a <b>foot</b> <b>below</b> the surface of the water. [...] There was no loss of life, and with the aid of Grahamona, most of the cargo was salvaged.|$|R
2500|$|American {{limnologist}} J. Val Klump was {{the first}} person to reach the lowest depth of Lake Superior on July 30, 1985, as part of a scientific expedition, which at 122 fathoms 1 <b>foot</b> (...) <b>below</b> sea level is the second-lowest spot in the continental interior of the United States and the third-lowest spot in the interior of the North American continent after Iliamna Lake in Alaska (942 <b>feet</b> [...] <b>below</b> sea level) and Great Slave Lake in the Northwest Territories of Canada at ( [...] below sea level). (Though Crater Lake is the deepest lake in the United States and deeper than Lake Superior, Crater Lake's elevation is higher and consequently its deepest point is [...] above sea level.) ...|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Bridge during June 2008 Midwest floods. Normally, {{there is}} about 20 <b>feet</b> {{clearance}} <b>below</b> the bridge.|$|R
25|$|This {{freezing}} period temporarily {{stopped the}} ice sheets {{north of the}} Great Lakes from thawing. It is called the Younger Dryas Stadial, dating from 10,800–9500 BCE. Temperatures plunged seven degrees and the sea level sank 100 <b>feet</b> <b>below</b> present level. Nomadic Paleo-Indians arrived in the upper Ohio Valley utilizing Kanawha Black flint at this time. By 9500 BCE the Younger Dryas suddenly ended and warmer temperatures returned.|$|E
25|$|The Shenandoah river (about 422 <b>feet</b> <b>below</b> Lock 33) lock let boats {{cross to}} Harpers Ferry with the mules {{walking on the}} {{railroad}} bridge, up the Shenandoah river, to the old Potomac Canal Bypass on the Shenandoah river by Virginius island. The railroad refused to let mules walk on the bridge, and from lack of business, the lock was abandoned. Stones from that lock were used for other purposes.|$|E
25|$|The {{platforms}} {{are approximately}} 25 <b>feet</b> <b>below</b> street {{level and the}} station's full-time fare control areas {{are at the center}} of each. A staircase of seven steps goes up to a turnstile bank and outside fare control, there is a token booth and four street stairs. The ones on the Bronx-bound side go up either eastern corners of Lexington Avenue and East 51st Street while the ones on the Brooklyn Bridge-bound side go up to either western corners.|$|E
5000|$|... from <b>below</b> the <b>foot</b> to <b>below</b> {{the knee}} is {{a quarter of}} the height of a man.|$|R
50|$|Foamhenge is {{designed}} to match Stonehenge, with similarly sized pieces oriented in astronomically equivalent coordinates. The 'stones' are composed completely of styrofoam and painted gray. Each piece is stabilized with an embedded 2.5 in pipe, extending from the top, through the piece and anchored into a concrete <b>footing</b> <b>below.</b> The entire structure was assembled in about ten days, as opposed to Stonehenge's construction period of about 1000 years.|$|R
50|$|When he {{was nine}} years old he was injured and {{disabled}} in an accident with electric power. He lost his right hand and left <b>foot</b> <b>below</b> the knee. 80% of his body were burnt but today he enjoys a good health. He has five children and a grandchild. Nordtvedt used to be right-handed, but when he lost his hand he {{had to learn how to}} write with his left hand.|$|R
