25|$|Coriander is {{commonly}} found both as whole dried seeds and in ground form. Roasting or heating the seeds {{in a dry}} pan heightens the flavour, aroma, and pungency. <b>Ground</b> <b>coriander</b> seed loses flavour quickly in storage and is best ground fresh. Coriander seed is a spice in garam masala and Indian curries which often employ the ground fruits in generous amounts together with cumin, acting as a thickener in a mixture called dhana jeera.|$|E
50|$|The typical {{ingredients}} are finely julienned carrots, garlic, ground red pepper, <b>ground</b> <b>coriander</b> seeds, vinegar, vegetable oil, salt and pepper. It may also include sesame seeds.|$|E
5000|$|Tabil (تابل) is an Algerian and Tunisian spice mixture {{generally}} {{consisting of}} <b>ground</b> <b>coriander</b> seed, caraway seed, garlic powder, and chili powder. Other ingredients {{might also be}} included, such as rose flower powder, cumin, mint, laurel, cloves or curcuma. The term can also refer to coriander by itself.|$|E

50|$|To prepare red mojo it is {{necessary}} to dry the peppers. Once dry, peppers can be kept {{for a long time before}} preparation. Before making mojo, peppers are soaked in water so they lose their spiciness. Then, grains and fibers are removed but for a few that will make the mojo spicy. In the case of green mojo, spiciness will be regulated by the amount of garlic, and can be also intensified by adding <b>ground</b> <b>coriander</b> seeds.|$|E
5000|$|Tabil, {{pronounced}} [...] "table", {{is a word}} in Tunisian Arabic meaning [...] "seasoning" [...] and {{refers to}} a particular Tunisian spice mix, although earlier it meant <b>ground</b> <b>coriander.</b> Paula Wolfert makes the plausible claim that tabil {{is one of the}} spice mixes brought to Tunisia by Muslims expelled from Andalusia in 1492 after the fall of Granada. Today tabil, closely associated with the cooking of Tunisia, features garlic, cayenne pepper, caraway and coriander seeds pounded in a mortar and then dried in the sun and is often used in cooking beef or veal.|$|E
50|$|Coconut milk, salt, {{and spices}} such as <b>ground</b> {{candlenut}} and <b>coriander</b> are often mixed within the flour batter. Some recipes might also add a chopped citrus leaf {{to add a}} fresh aroma and taste to it. The spiced batter, mixed or sprinkled with the granule ingredients, is deep fried in ample hot coconut oil. The flour batter acts as a binding agent for the granules (peanuts, anchovy, shrimp, etc.). This hardens upon frying and turns into a golden brown and crispy cracker.|$|R
50|$|The Zuni people {{referred}} to the plant and its relative Physalis hederifolia as Ke’tsitokia, and probably used them in similar ways. Women grew it in household gardens. The tomato-flavored berry was boiled and <b>ground</b> with onion, <b>coriander,</b> and chilis to make a dish {{considered to be a}} delicacy. The fruit was also dried and mixed into flour for bread. Today the Zuni use the closely related common tomatillo (P. philadelphica) in a sauce recipe derived from the traditional dishes that used wild species.|$|R
5000|$|Bafat (or Baffat) {{is a type}} of masala, {{a mixture}} of spices.

Baffat is commonly used in Mangalorean cuisinehttp://indianfood.about.com/od/masalarecipes/r/bafad.htm and, due to the Portuguese influence in the area, is a combination of Indian and Portuguese flavors. Bafat is regarded as a pork seasoning http://www.mangaloredelicacy.netfirms.com/porkbaffat.htm, but is also used to season other meats, and sometimes vegetables.|$|R
5000|$|This cuisine is characterised {{by the use}} of {{a common}} base for all the sauces to which spices are added when {{individual}} dishes are prepared. The standard [...] "feedstock" [...] is usually a sautéed mixture of onion, garlic and fresh ginger, to which various spices are added, depending on the recipe, but which may include: cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, chilies, peppercorns, cumin and mustard seeds. <b>Ground</b> <b>coriander</b> seed is widely used as a thickening agent, and turmeric is added for colour and its digestive qualities. Fresh or canned tomatoes and bell peppers are a common addition.|$|E
50|$|The oil {{is heated}} {{in a large}} pan or wok and the whole spices are sautéed. Add the onions and cook for 15 minutes, until lightly browned, then {{add the garlic and}} ginger and cook for 1 minute. Add the chicken, yogurt, enough stock or water to cover the chicken and the salt.the red chilli powder, <b>ground</b> <b>coriander,</b> ground turmeric, green {{chillies}} and tomatoes. Simmer for 20-25 minutes, or until the chicken is piping hot and cooked through, with no sign of pink in the juices when the thickest part is pierced with a skewer.

50|$|In Singapore and Johor, Malaysia {{the most}} popular variant is mee soto ayam (chicken noodle soto). Mee soto is a spicy noodle soup dish that {{combines}} the Indonesian chicken broth known as soto ayam with thick yellow Hokkien noodles. The chicken broth is spiced with spice paste made of <b>ground</b> peppercorns, <b>coriander,</b> garlic, candlenut, galangal, red onion, turmeric, bruised lemongrass, cardamom, cloves and cinnamon. It is a Javanese influenced dish, and quite popular in Singapore and Johor. Basically it is pretty similar with soto ayam (chicken soto) commonly served in Indonesia, with exception it is served with noodle instead of rice vermicelli. The origin of the soto ayam broth used for making mee soto {{can be traced to}} the Madurese migrant ethnic group who reside in the Indonesian city of Surabaya in East Java. The East Javanese immigrants from Madura and Lamongan has been settled in Johor and Singapore, bringing with them the spicy soto ayam broth dish, and replacing the rice dumpling (lontong) with yellow noodle.|$|R
50|$|The fried garnish for dal goes by many names, {{including}} chaunk, tadka and tarka. The {{ingredients in}} the chaunk for each variety of dal vary by region and individual tastes. The raw spices (more commonly cumin seeds, mustard seeds, asafoetida, and sometimes fenugreek seeds and dried red chili pepper) are first fried {{for a few seconds}} in the hot oil on medium/low heat. This is generally followed by ginger, garlic, and onion, which are generally fried for 10 minutes. After the onion turns golden brown, <b>ground</b> spices (turmeric, <b>coriander,</b> red chili powder, garam masala, etc.) are added. The chaunk is then poured over the cooked dal.|$|R
40|$|Thirty five genotypes of {{coriander}} (Coriandrum sativum L.) {{were tested}} in four artificially created environments to judge their stability in performance of seed yield. The differences among genotypes and environments were significant for seed yield. Stability parameters varied considerably among the tested genotypes in all the methods used. The variation in result in different methods was due to non-fulfillment of assumption of different models. However, AMMI analysis provides the information on main effects as well as interaction effects and depiction of PCA score gives {{better understanding of the}} pattern of genotype – environment interaction. The sum of squares due to PCAs was also used for the computation of AMMI stability values for better understanding of the adaptability behavior of genotypes hence, additive main effects and multiplicative interaction (AMMI) model was most appropriate for the analysis of G x E interactions for seed yield in coriander. Genotypes RVC 15, RVC 19, RVC 22, RVC 25 and Panipat local showed wider adaptability while, Simpo S 33 exhibited specific adaptability to favourable conditions of high fertility. These genotypes could be utilized in breeding programmers to transfer the adaptability genes into high yielding genetic back <b>ground</b> of <b>coriander...</b>|$|R
50|$|The flavour of a korma {{is based}} on a mixture of spices, {{including}} <b>ground</b> <b>coriander</b> and cumin, combined with yogurt kept below curdling temperature and incorporated slowly and carefully with the meat juices. Traditionally, this would have been carried out in a pot set over a very low fire, with charcoal on the lid to provide all-round heat. A korma can be mildly spiced or fiery and may use lamb, chicken, beef or game; some kormas combine meat and vegetables such as spinach and turnip. The term Shahi (Royal), used for some kormas indicates its status as a prestige dish, rather than an everyday meal, and its association with the court.|$|E
5000|$|The {{glutinous rice}} is soaked and cooked with coconut milk and salt. The filling {{is made of}} {{shredded}} chicken breast, chicken stock, garlic, candle nut, <b>ground</b> <b>coriander,</b> cumin, brown sugar, vegetable oil, minced shallot, coconut milk, kaffir lime leaves, salt and pepper. Other than chicken, shredded fish or abon (beef meat floss) might be used as filling. When the cooked glutinous rice is cool enough to handle, the chicken filling {{is placed on the}} glutinous rice and rolled in a banana leaf, wrapped and secured with biting or lidi semat, a small wooden [...] "needle" [...] made of coconut leaf mid rib or bamboo. Then these banana leaf packages are steamed or grilled. This releases a distinct pleasant aroma of toasted banana leaf.|$|E
5000|$|The base {{ingredient}} of Merkén is the smoked pepper [...] "cacho de cabra" [...] (Capsicum Annuum var. Lungum) a dried, smoked, red pepper, that is sometimes ground with toasted coriander seed and salt. [...] The traditional process of preparation is slow, since it involves harvesting green peppers and then letting them mature {{to develop an}} intense reddish color. The peppers are dried naturally {{in the sun and}} are then smoked over a wood fire. They are then stored by being hung to dry prior to grinding. Once reduced to powder or flakes, the peppers are often mixed with salt and roasted <b>ground</b> <b>coriander</b> seed. Commercially, merkén pepper with only an addition of salt is known as [...] "natural merken" [...] ("merkén natural"), while [...] "special merkén" [...] ("merkén especial") contains coriander seeds. The composition of [...] "special merkén" [...] is approximately 70% chili, 20% salt, and 10% coriander seed.|$|E
40|$|Twenty five land races from Madhya Pradesh and ten {{germplasm}} of coriander {{were evaluated}} in four environments to assess umbel per plant using multivariate analysis. Mean sum of squares due to genotypes, environments and GEI were highly significant for umbels per plant. Variation in GEI was mainly due to heterogeneity.). PCA 1 and PCA 2 captures the 99. 42 % of interaction sum of squares hence, these two principal component axes {{were the best}} predictive. The potential environment the potential environments E 3 (high fertility, 2009 - 10) bearing lowest interaction effect while, least potential environments E 2 (low fertility, 2008 - 09) exhibited high PCA scores. The biplot of genotype, environment and IPCA 1 showed three groups. One group exhibited the similar main effects (mean umbels per plant) to the grand mean. The second group showed high interaction effect varied in direction while third group bear the low interaction effect. AMMI Stability Values (ASV), ranging from from 7. 444 to 31. 099 was lowest in RVC 8 followed by RVC 4, RVC 11, RVC 21, RVC 9 and RVC 3 whereas, it was noted maximum in RVC 19 followed by Moroccan, CS 193, Simpo S 33 and G 5363. The genotypes exhibiting low IPCA scores and ASV namely, RVC 8, RVC 4, RVC 11, RVC 21, RVC 19 and RVC 25 showed wider adaptability for umbels per plant while, RVC 19, Moroccan, CS 193, Simpo S 33 and G 5363 exhibiting specific adaptability towards environmental conditions. These genotypes can be utilized in breeding programmes to transfer the adaptability genes for umbel per plant into high yielding genetic back <b>ground</b> in <b>coriander...</b>|$|R
5000|$|What Tunisians {{refer to}} as a [...] "tajine" [...] is very {{different}} from the Moroccan dish. Tunisian tajine is more like an Italian frittata or an eggah. First, a simple ragout is prepared, of meat cut into very small pieces, cooked with onions and spices, such as a blend of dried rosebuds and ground cinnamon known as baharat or a robust combination of <b>ground</b> <b>coriander</b> and caraway seeds; this is called tabil. Then something starchy is added to thicken the juices. Common thickeners include cannellini beans, chickpeas, breadcrumbs or cubed potatoes. When the meat is tender, it is combined with the ingredients which have been chosen to be the dominant flavouring. Examples include fresh parsley, dried mint, saffron, sun-dried tomatoes, cooked vegetables and stewed calves' brains. Next, the stew is enriched with cheese and eggs. Finally, this egg and stew is baked in a deep pie dish, either on the stove or in the oven until top and bottom are crisply cooked and the eggs are just set. When the tajine is ready, it is turned out onto a plate and sliced into squares, accompanied by wedges of lemon. Tunisian tajines can also be made with seafood or as a completely vegetarian dish.|$|E
40|$|There was {{investigated}} microbial quality of spices used in production of meat products (black pepper, allspice, coriander, juniper, cumin, cinnamon, badian, mustard, bay leaf, paprika, rosemary, garlic, ginger, thyme, cardamom). The spices were analysed {{on the presence}} of total count of mesophilic, thermoresistant and coliforming microorganisms, Staphylococcus aureus, methicilin resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp., Bacillus cereus, Bacillus licheniformis and moulds. For the detection of fungal contamination was used agar with glucose, yeast extract and oxytetracyklin and dichloran-glycerol agar. The cultivation was performed at 25 ± 1 °C for 5 - 7 days. The microscopic method was used for species identification. The aflatoxin presence was confirmed by ELISA test in all of tested spices and was performed in ppb (pars per billion = μg/kg). TCM ranged from 200 to 5600000 cfu/g, TRM from 20 to 90000 cfu/g and coliforming bacteria from 30 to 3200 cfu/g. B. cereus was present in juniper, mustard, bay leaf, thyme and cardamom (32 %), while B.  licheniformis was confirmed in 58 % of cases (allspice, pepper, ground juniper, badian, bay leaf, paprika, garlic, thyme and cardamom). S. aureus was detected in whole coriander, cinnamon, badian and mustard but only in law number (30, 40, 20 and 10 cfu/g respectively). No strains S. aureus was identified as MRSA. The presence of Salmonella spp. and E. coli was not confirmed. The fungal contamination was found in 14 spices and the their count varied from 0 to 1550 cfu/g. There were confirmed the presence of Aspergillus flavus (allspice whole and ground, black pepper whole and ground, whole coriander, ground cumin, ground bay leaf), Aspergillus niger (allspice whole and ground, black pepper ground, ground juniper, cumin ground, bay leaf ground, ground rosemary, ground thyme), Penicillium glaucum (allspice whole and ground, whole juniper, whole cinnamon), Penicillium claviforme (whole black pepper, whole coriander, cardamom ground), Alternaria alternata (cumin ground, rosemary ground, thyme ground), Mucor (whole and <b>ground</b> <b>coriander</b> and thyme) and Phoma (ground cumin). The aflatoxin presence was confirmed in 11 of samples (57. 9 %) and the value ranged from 0 to 4  ppb (ground allspice, whole and ground pepper, whole juniper, cumin, cinnamon, badian, bay leaf, paprika, rosemary, thyme). <!
