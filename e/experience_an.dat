One group was continually rewarded with prey, while it was made certain that the other failed. As a result, members of the successful group intensified their foraging attempts while the unsuccessful group ventured out fewer and fewer times. A month later, the successful foragers continued in their role while the others had moved to specialise in brood care.|$|E
5|$|During November 2002, New Zealand's National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research {{predicted}} {{that there would}} be an eastwards shift in activity during the season, with more tropical cyclones than normal expected to the east of the date line, due to well established weak to moderate El Niño conditions. As a result, the island nations of Wallis and Futuna, Niue, Samoa, Tokelau, and the Southern Cook Islands were predicted to experience a higher than average number of tropical cyclones. The Solomon Islands, Fiji, Tuvalu, Tonga, French Polynesia, New Zealand and the Northern Cook Islands were predicted to <b>experience</b> <b>an</b> average number of tropical cyclones, while Southern Papua New Guinea, Vanuatu and New Caledonia were predicted to experience a reduced number of tropical cyclones. In January 2003, NIWA issued an updated outlook, listing the Northern Cook Islands and French Polynesia as areas predicted to <b>experience</b> <b>an</b> above average number of tropical cyclones. In contrast, Vanuatu was predicted to experience below average cyclone activity. The Solomon Islands and Tonga were now predicted to experience a reduced number of tropical cyclones, with all other countries expected to face the same risk as the November outlook.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{examines how}} media-induced consumer activation level affects consumer response to highly energetic commercials. Over six studies, including a Hulu field experiment, the authors report that consumers who are <b>experiencing</b> <b>a</b> deactivating emotion (e. g., sadness induced by a movie) {{find it more}} difficult to watch highly energetic commercials compared with consumers who are not <b>experiencing</b> <b>a</b> deactivating emotion. As <b>a</b> result, consumers <b>experiencing</b> <b>a</b> deactivating emotion are less likely to watch highly energetic commercials and recall the advertiser compared with consumers who are not <b>experiencing</b> <b>a</b> deactivating emotion. The authors do not observe these effects when consumers <b>experiencing</b> <b>a</b> deactivating emotion watch commercials that are moderately energetic or when consumers do not <b>experience</b> <b>a</b> deactivating emotion. These findings suggest that when advertisers run commercials in a media context that induces a deactivating emotion (e. g., sadness, relaxation, contentment), they should avoid running highly energetic commercials (e. g., with upbeat, enthusiastic spokespeople). In addition, this research recommends that when advertisers are unable to determine the emotions induced by the media context, they should run commercials that are moderate in energy. The results of a metaanalysis across the present studies show that consumers <b>experiencing</b> <b>a</b> deactivating emotion will respond as much as 50 % more favorably to moderately energetic commercials compared with highly energetic commercials...|$|R
