5|$|On {{the morning}} of September 11, 2001, MacFarlane was {{scheduled}} to return to Los Angeles on American Airlines Flight 11 from Boston. Suffering from a hangover after the previous night's celebrations that followed his speech at his alma mater, the Rhode Island School of Design, and with an incorrect departure time (8:15a.m. instead of 7:45a.m.) from his travel agent, he arrived at Logan International Airport about ten minutes too late to board the flight as the gates had been closed. Fifteen minutes after departure, American Airlines Flight 11 was hijacked, and at 8:46a.m. it was flown into the North Tower of the World Trade Center, killing everyone on board. MacFarlane said,The only reason it hasn't really affected me as it maybe could have is I didn't really know that I was in any danger until after it was over, so I never had that panic moment. After the fact, it was sobering, but people {{have a lot of}} close calls; you're crossing the street and you almost get hit by a car..... this one just happened to be related to something massive. I really can't let it affect me because I'm a comedy writer. I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> that {{in the back of my}} head.|$|E
25|$|Comparison {{has been}} made to the Grand Forks, North Dakota, 1997 Red River Flood, Hurricane Katrina, and the Great Flood of 1993 and the lesson to be learned is that full {{recovery}} will take at least ten years, and that the political and private establishments will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> aside territorial one-ups-man-ship and co-operate in making some decisions that will be decidedly unpopular.|$|E
25|$|The first lucha de apuestas was {{presented}} on July 14, 1940 at Arena México. The defending champion Murciélago (Velázquez) {{was so much}} lighter than his challenger (Octavio Gaona), he requested a further condition before he would sign the contract: Octavio Gaona would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> his hair on the line. Octavio Gaona won the match and Murciélago unmasked, giving birth to a tradition in lucha libre.|$|E

Bradman and Pickett strode out to the middle, Bradman took strike and Pickett crouched behind the stumps and a picture was taken, leaving Pickett to spend the next few weeks explaining to everyone that Bradman had not started a trend for batting without pads.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{referendum}} was announced, {{attention focused on}} the issue of the ballot boxes, since the Government of Spain is in charge of providing them, whereas for this non-State-sanctioned vote, the Government of Catalonia would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> them in place, potentially risking prosecution for the misuse of public funds. On 24 March, the Spanish Public Prosecutor's Office in Catalonia had already announced an inquiry to determine whether a referendum is in the planning.|$|E
25|$|He was {{ambivalent}} about requiring written opinions of arbitrators. While generally opposing {{them on the}} grounds that they would slow the process down, since the losing party would in many instances simply use it as the starting point for an appeal, he allowed that arbitrators should at least <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> it in writing if they were making their decision on one aspect of the case. The SEC ultimately agreed and declined to order written opinions of arbitrators.|$|E

25|$|As I {{think about}} it, it {{is none of}} these things. They are not {{the reasons for this}} incident, there's a much later point to it all. Happiness. Yes happiness. If I am out of the way, all the family can get down to their own lives. Mother will {{not have to worry about}} me making my grades, and Daddy will not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> out more money on me, which would do no more good than it did in high school.|$|E
25|$|We have a {{song called}} Charlie Brown, which was the centrepiece of this other record we started first. We were playing the riff on an {{accordion}} and Guy came in one morning and said, 'I'm afraid I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> my foot down. I don't want to speak out of turn, but I will not allow this song to be played on an accordion - that has {{to go in with}} the Mylo bunch'. So then we thought — let's just make one album.|$|E
25|$|Early {{acquisition}} of relative pitch allows for accelerated learning of scales and intervals. Musical training assists with the attentional and executive functioning necessary to interpret and efficiently encode music. In conjunction with brain plasticity, these processes {{become more and}} more stable. However, this process expresses a degree of circular logic in that the more learning that takes place, the greater the stability of the processes, ultimately decreasing overall brain plasticity. This could possibly explain the discrepancy in amount of effort both children and adults <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> into mastering new tasks.|$|E

He had always, almost wilfully, <b>to</b> <b>put</b> her out of count, and act from the brute {{strength}} of his own feelings. And he could not do it often, and there remained afterwards always the sense of failure and of death. If he were really with her, he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> aside himself and his desire. If he would have her, he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> her aside.|$|R

25|$|The Bigfoot {{researchers}} {{say that no}} human can walk that way in the film. Oh, yes they can! When you're wearing long clown's feet, you can't place the ball of your foot down first. You <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> your foot down flat. Otherwise, you'll stumble. Another thing, when {{you put on the}} gorilla head, you can only turn your head maybe a quarter of the way. And to look behind you, you've got to turn your head and your shoulders and your hips. Plus, the shoulder pads in the suit are {{in the way of the}} jaw. That's why the Bigfoot turns and looks the way he does in the film. He has to twist his entire upper body.|$|E
25|$|The rebels outnumbered the Diệmists {{and quickly}} made inroads against the loyalists, who were caught unawares and {{confused}} {{about whether the}} coup was real. The generals wanted and needed to finish the operation quickly with as little hand-to-hand combat as possible, as they knew that both factions would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> aside their differences and regroup to fight the communists after the coup, and because a drawn out mini-civil war would only allow the communists {{to take over the}} countryside while the ARVN fought in the capital. Minh had decided to keep the loyalists in their rank afterward if they still wanted to fight the Vietcong. Furthermore, a drawn-out conflict would benefit the Vietcong. Most of the anti-Diệm forces also wanted to avoid killing the president in a large-scale battle for the palace.|$|E
25|$|After {{a year in}} the North Division, the Abbotsford Heat {{was moved}} to the newly renamed West Division, {{formerly}} the South Division, under an American Hockey League realignment in the summer of 2013. The team lost their top leading scorers from the previous season in centers Ben Walter and Krys Kolanos, as well as forwards Dustin Sylvester, Roman Horák, and Tyler Ruegsegger,; defenseman Mike Matczak, and goaltender Leland Irving. Fourteen players from the previous season returned to the Abbotsford lineup for 2013–14, but the new roster also included a great deal of new young players. Newcomers included forwards Steve Bégin, Markus Granlund, Josh Jooris, Michael Ferland, Corban Knight, and Ben Hanowski; goaltenders Laurent Brossoit and Joni Ortio; and defensemen Chad Billins, John Ramage, Tyler Wotherspoon, Dean Arsene, and Pat Sieloff, who at 19 was youngest player in AHL at that time. Coach Troy Ward felt the team had good enthusiasm, pacing, discipline and puck management, and that with few veteran players, the entire team would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> forward an equal effort.|$|E

25|$|A soldier whose {{business}} is murder {{as a fine}} art, a diplomat whose calling is based on deception and secretiveness, a politician whose very life consists in compromises with his conscience, a business man whose aim is personal profit within the limits allowed by a lenient law—such may be excused if they set patriotic deception above common everyday decency and perform services as spies. They merely accept the code of morality to which modern society still conforms. Not so the scientist. The very essence of his life is the service of truth. We all know scientists who in private life do not {{come up to the}} standard of truthfulness, but who, nevertheless, would not consciously falsify the results of their researches. It is bad enough if we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> up with these, because they reveal a lack of strength of character that is liable to distort the results of their work. A person, however, who uses science as a cover for political spying, who demeans himself to pose before a foreign government as an investigator and asks for assistance in his alleged researches in order to carry on, under this cloak, his political machinations, prostitutes science in an unpardonable way and forfeits the right to be classed as a scientist.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{economic}} problems that the citizens of Guwahati <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> up with is the hike in prices of many essentials, chiefly vegetable, poultry and fish. The prices of these commodities keep escalating at an inordinate rate because of which the buyers {{find it difficult to}} buy these items. Vegetables are transported into Assam from West Bengal, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Maharashtra and Meghalaya and the truckers en route have to pay considerable amount of money as tax at various check posts. It is one of the causes of rise in prices of vegetables in the markets of Guwahati. The prices of locally available vegetables and fruits undergo large markup because of transportation expenses grounds, besides intra-State check posts taxes. In addition to these, the wholesale dealers as well as the retail sellers augment the prices of the commodities according to their own desires. The prices of poultry, mainly chicken that reach the city markets from places like Chaygaon and Barpeta have been soaring rapidly because of similar factors. There has been steep rise in the prices of fishes as well, the prominent varieties of which being Rohu ("Rou"), Catla ("Bahu"), Walking catfish ("Magur") and Monopterus ("Kuchia") among many others.|$|E
