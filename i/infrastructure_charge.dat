40|$|Developer paid fees or {{infrastructure}} charges are a commonly used mechanism for {{local governments to}} pay for new infrastructure. However, property developers claim that these costs are merely passed on to home buyers, with adverse effects to housing affordability. Despite numerous government reports and many years of industry advocacy, there remains no empirical evidence in Australia to confirm or quantify this passing on effect to home buyers and the consequent effect on housing affordability.

40|$|Sourcing {{appropriate}} {{funding for}} the provision of new urban infrastructure has been a policy dilemma for governments around the world for decades. This is particularly relevant in high growth areas where new services are required to support swelling populations. The Australian infrastructure funding policy dilemmas are reflective of similar matters in many countries, particularly the United States of America, where infrastructure cost recovery policies have been in place since the 1970 &# 039;s. There is an extensive body of both theoretical and empirical literature from these countries that discusses the passing on (to home buyers) of these infrastructure charges, and the corresponding impact on housing prices. The theoretical evidence is consistent in its findings that infrastructure charges are passed on to home buyers by way of higher house prices. The empirical evidence is also consistent in its findings, with "overshifting" of these charges evident in all models since the 1980 &# 039;s, i. e. $ 1 <b>infrastructure</b> <b>charge</b> results in greater than $ 1 increase in house prices. However, despite over a dozen separate studies over two decades in the US on this topic, no empirical works have been carried out in Australia to test if similar shifting or overshifting occurs here. The purpose of this research is to conduct a preliminary analysis of the more recent models used in these US empirical studies in order to identify the key study area selection criteria and success factors. The paper concludes that many of the study area selection criteria are implicit rather than explicit. By collecting data across the models, some implicit criteria become apparent, whilst others remain elusive.

40|$|Proceedings on CD-ROM. Thirteen years ago, the European Directive 91 / 440 was {{implemented}} {{with the aim}} of increasing the efficiency of railway organisations throughout Europe.

40|$|Until recently, Europe was {{dominated}} by state-owned, vertically integrated railroads. Lately, European Union (EU) policies and relevant legislation have introduced the legal separation between railroad operations and infrastructure management. Thus, the railroad infrastructure management companies have started applying charges (termed access pricing) to railroad companies for using infrastructure. Although European policies and legislation set the basic access pricing principles, they did not provide specific rules or methods for deriving <b>infrastructure</b> <b>charging</b> systems. An access pricing system for suburban (commuter) rail services was developed. An overview of practices in EU member states and the United States is presented. The basic principles and economic characteristics of <b>infrastructure</b> <b>charging</b> are outlined. The proposed structure of the <b>infrastructure</b> <b>charging</b> system is discussed, with {{a distinction between the}} basic charge - which includes costs for train planning and line operations, infrastructure damage and wear and tear costs, and quality of services - and additional components. Each component is mathematically expressed. The proposed charging system does not include costs related to train operations. To test the robustness of the proposed system, it is applied to the suburban rail services provided by the Greek company AMEL, with trains running on the Greek railroads' infrastructure. The proposed <b>infrastructure</b> <b>charging</b> system can be applied to any railroad by changing the variable values...|$|R
40|$|European {{railways}} {{have been}} immersed since the nineties in a restructuring process {{aimed at improving}} the effectiveness, quality and economic efficiency of the provision of railway services, as well as stimulating the growth of railway markets. This reform has involved a separation between infrastructure management and operation {{and the introduction of}} rail infrastructure charges to regulate the use, by railway undertakings, of the infrastructure managed by infrastructure managers. Rail infrastructure charges aim, in essence, at recovering costs. Nevertheless, they can have an influence on the usage of the infrastructure, especially in corridors where competition between modes exists. Therefore, special attention should be paid to their definition and amount to ensure that they do not counteract the important effort that the European Union is making to help finance and build a European high speed network aimed at strengthening railways and redressing modal share imbalances. In Europe, legislation requires transparent and non discriminatory rail access charges, based on the principles of short run marginal social cost although mark ups are permitted where necessary to meet financial requirements. However, it does not specify how these principles should be implemented. This dissertation has three main tasks. Firstly, it calculates the amount of rail <b>infrastructure</b> <b>charge</b> for European high speed lines/services based on the marginal cost. Secondly, it characterises the rail infrastructure charging systems applied to European high speed lines/services, in order to detect if mark ups above the marginal cost of wear and tear are being applied to those services and if so, how they are applied. Finally, it quantifies the impacts on traffic volumes and mode split resulting from bringing the current levels of rail infrastructure charges (applied in the European high speed network) to the level of marginal cost of maintenance and renewals and to the optimal Ramsey mark up. According to the results obtained, current levels of rail infrastructure charges implemented in Europe {{have a negative impact on}} the competitiveness of the high speed passenger services that run on the European railway network, particularly in the cases where the rail market share is currently low (below 80 - 85 %). Thus, mark ups would not have been imposed after careful consideration of their consequences on the market position of railway undertakings in the market segment in question...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{mitigate}} negative effects from traffic {{it has been}} decided that <b>infrastructure</b> <b>charges</b> in the European Union (EU) {{should be based on}} short run marginal costs. The Swedish Parliament has legislated that operators in the Swedish railway <b>infrastructure</b> must pay <b>charges</b> based on short run marginal social costs in order to mitigate externalities in railway infrastructure. Internalization of the social cost of noise is of particular interest, since it is the only environmental problem perceived as more troublesome today than in the early 1990 s. Inclusion of a noise component in rail <b>infrastructure</b> <b>charges</b> raises two issues: (i) the monetary evaluation of noise abatement, since noise is a non-market good, and (ii) the estimation of the effect on the noise level that one extra train will create. Regarding the latter, we are interested in the marginal noise, since <b>infrastructure</b> <b>charges</b> based on the short-run marginal cost principle should be based on the effect from the marginal train, not the noise level itself. Using already existing knowledge, this study shows {{that it is possible to}} implement a noise component in the rail <b>infrastructure</b> <b>charges.</b> The values that are used today to estimate the social cost of noise exposure in cost benefit analysis can also be used to calculate the marginal cost.

40|$|Whilst {{there is}} a long {{tradition}} of economic analysis of charging for the use of road infrastructure, the situation relating to rail is quite different. In most cases until recently railways have been integrated organisations with the same body responsible for infrastructure and operations. Rail <b>infrastructure</b> <b>charging,</b> if practised at all, has therefore been largely an internal transfer within the organisation. The principal exception to this has been the presence of access rights by one company over infrastructure owned by another in the case of North America. But the dominance of integrated national rail companies in Europe, and the fact that international traffic was operated by cooperation between the national railways rather than by one railway operating over the tracks of another, made the issue of no relevance here. The change in this situation started with the separation of infrastructure from operations in Sweden, which was undertaken with the aim of putting rail infrastructure on an equivalent footing to road. Later on the European Commission began pushing for separation of infrastructure from operations in order to encourage new entry and to promote competition between different rail companies. <b>Infrastructure</b> <b>charging,</b> <b>infrastructure</b> financing, competition, market structure, railways...|$|R
