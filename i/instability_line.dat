40|$|We {{study the}} {{stability}} of the normal state in a mesoscopic NSN junction biased by a constant voltage V with respect to the formation of the superconducting order. Using the linearized time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equation, we obtain the temperature dependence of the <b>instability</b> <b>line,</b> V[subscript inst] (T), where nucleation of superconductivity takes place. For sufficiently low biases, a stationary symmetric superconducting state emerges below the <b>instability</b> <b>line.</b> For higher biases, the normal phase is destroyed by the formation of a nonstationary bimodal state with two superconducting nuclei localized near the opposite terminals. The low-temperature and large-voltage behavior of the <b>instability</b> <b>line</b> is highly sensitive to the details of the inelastic relaxation mechanism in the wire. Therefore, experimental studies of V[subscript inst] (T) in NSN junctions may be used as an effective tool to access the parameters of the inelastic relaxation in the normal state...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT:This work {{presents}} a numerical {{study of the}} <b>instability</b> <b>line</b> that relies on balance laws of physics rather than phenomenology. The <b>instability</b> <b>line</b> defines the onset of static liquefaction for loose sandy materials in the p-q space of effective stresses under undrained loading conditions. The onset of static liquefaction is predicted {{by means of a}} recently developed criterion and specialized to an elastoplastic constitutive model. The performance of this criterion is compared with laboratory tests showing satisfactory results. For a given void ratio and different mean pressures, it is found that the mobilized friction angle at the onset of static liquefaction is not constant. Therefore, the <b>instability</b> <b>line</b> is not an intrinsic property of the sand, but depends on {{the current state of the}} material. This work re-interprets the hypothesis given by VaidandChern, which has been amply used to analyze liquefaction phenomena...|$|E

40|$|Experimental {{results are}} {{presented}} in this paper to show that a runaway type of pre-failure instability can occur for sand under dilatancy rate controlled conditions when an appropriate strain increment ratio, dεv/dε 1, is imposed. This type of instability is similar to the runaway type of instability observed for very loose sand under undrained conditions. Whether a soil element will undergo pre-failure instability depends on the difference between the strain increment ratio of the soil obtained from drained test, under a specified effective confining pressure, (dεv/dε 1) s, and the strain increment ratio imposed during the test, (dεv/dε 1) i, rather than the absolute magnitude of (dεv/dε 1) i. Based on the experimental data obtained in this study it was found that an <b>instability</b> <b>line</b> can be determined from a series of strain path tests conducted at different effective confining pressures but with the same dεv/dε 1 by joining the peak points of the effective stress paths to the origin in the q–p′ stress space. This line is similar to the <b>instability</b> <b>line</b> obtained from undrained tests on loose sand. The instability tests under dilatancy rate controlled conditions indicate that the stress ratio at the onset of instability obtained in the instability tests coincide with the peak stress ratio line. This suggests that the peak stress line can be used to predict the onset of instability under dilatancy rate controlled conditions {{in the same way as}} the use of <b>instability</b> <b>line</b> to predict the onset of instability under undrained conditions...|$|E
40|$|Comprehensive {{tests were}} {{performed}} to obtain the stress - strain and stiffness characteristics of a fine uniform sand in a hollow cylinder apparatus under monotonic and cyclic torsional loading. Unstable response with a sudden reduction in shear strength after peak was observed under undrained monotonic loading. After a quasi-steady state the specimens showed a phase transformation and a tendency to dilation. Drained torsional hollow cylinder tests showed an equivalent characteristic state marking the transition between contractant and dilatant behaviour and the same line at phase transformation as their undrained counterparts. The <b>instability</b> <b>line,</b> defined under monotonic loading, appears to form a boundary to the behaviour of sand under cyclic loading. Unstable behaviour is introduced when the effective stress path followed by the specimen during cyclic loading reaches the <b>instability</b> <b>line</b> at a shear strain of approximately 0. 5 %.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{saturated}} silt and fine sand are susceptible to instability during undrained shearing. Coarse granular soils may also be unstable during undrained shearing or during rainfall infiltration starting at an unsaturated state. This paper investigates the instability of three saturated and unsaturated granular soils with different fines contents (f= 50, 32,and 10 %). Isotropic consolidation tests and mercury intrusion porosimetry tests were first conducted to investigate the instability of the microstructures of these granular soils. Then drained and undrained triaxial tests were conducted to investigate the instability behavior under the saturated condition. Subsequently, wetting tests under the constant shear stress condition were carried out on unsaturated specimens to investigate the instability of the same soils during water infiltration. The instability in the microstructures is in accordance with the compressibility of the soils. The instability during undrained shearing under saturated conditions is described using relations between the state parameter and the peak shear strength or slope of the <b>instability</b> <b>line</b> of the soil. The instability of an unsaturated soil along a wetting path depends on the stress ratio and net confining pressure. Using the equivalent mean effective stress concept, a unified <b>instability</b> <b>line</b> is defined for both saturated and unsaturated soils...|$|E

40|$|International audienceIt is {{well known}} that the {{specimen}} preparation method and the resulting sand fabric significantly affect sand behavior and sand liquefaction resistance. In many cases, the fabric and behavior of reconstituted sand samples do not represent those of in-situ deposits. Therefore, understanding the influence of specimen preparation and sand fabric on its behavior, particularly at the critical state, is important for relating the behavior of laboratory reconstituted specimens to in-situ soil response. In this study, the effect of sand fabric and specimen preparation method on the shearing behavior of sand is studied using triaxial shear tests. Dry funnel pluviation (DFP) and wet tamping (WT) are used to prepare the specimens. The results from <b>instability</b> <b>lines</b> and stress–strain curves indicate that the liquefaction resistance of specimens prepared with the DFP method is more than specimens reconstituted by the WT method...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{anelastic}} and dielectric spectroscopy measurements revealed {{new features}} of the phase diagram of PbZrTiO regarding {{the manner in which}} various ferroelectric and octahedral tilt <b>instability</b> <b>lines</b> approach each other. Rather than crossing, they tend to merge, also after considerable bending, and give rise to combined polar/tilt transitions over extended concentration ranges. The same effect is also found in (NaBi) BaTiO. It is proposed that such a behaviour results from cooperative coupling between the polar and tilt modes, and could be explained by a mechanism similar to that proposed by Holakowski in 1973, where coupling of two-order parameters with different symmetries produces a transformation of mixed character. The possible reasons are also discussed why disordered tilting, proposed to occur in correspondence with an elastic stiffening near the antiferroelectric/ferroelectric border in PZT, would be particularly difficult to reveal by diffraction...|$|R

40|$|A model {{equation}} for gravity-capillary {{waves in}} deep water is proposed. This model is a quadratic approximation of the deep water potential flow equations and has wavepacket-type solitary wave solutions.

Branches of both line and lump solitary waves are computed via a numerical continuation method. The stability of each type of wave is examined. The transverse <b>instability</b> of <b>line</b> solitary waves is predicted by a similar <b>instability</b> of <b>line</b> solitary waves in the nonlinear Schrödinger equation.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the charge-instabilities of the Hubbard-Holstein model with two coupled layers. In this system the scattering processes naturally separate into contributions which are either symmetric or antisymmetric combinations {{with respect to}} exchange of the layers. It {{turns out that the}} short-range strong correlations suppress finite wave-vector nesting instabilities for both symmetries but favor the occurrence of phase separation in the symmetric channel. Inclusion of a sizeable long-range Coulomb (LRC) interaction frustrates the q= 0 instabilities and supports the formation of incommensurate charge-density waves (CDW). Upon reducing doping from half-filling and for small electron-phonon coupling g the CDW instability first occurs in the antisymmetric channel but both <b>instability</b> <b>lines</b> merge with increasing g. While LRC forces always suppress the phase separation instability in the symmetric channel, the CDW period in the antisymmetric sector tends to infinity (q_c -> 0) for sufficiently small Coulomb interaction. This feature allows for the possibility of singular scattering over the whole Fermi surface. We discuss possible implications of our results for the bilayer high-Tc cuprates.

40|$|We use the {{renormalization}} group {{method to}} {{examine the effect of}} phonon mediated interaction on d-wave superconductivity, as driven by spin fluctuations in a quasi-one-dimensional electron system. The influence of a tight-binding electron-phonon interaction on the spin-density-wave and d-wave superconducting <b>instability</b> <b>lines</b> is calculated for arbitrary temperature, phonon frequency and antinesting of the Fermi surface. The domain of electron-phonon coupling strength where spin-density-wave order becomes unstable against the formation of a bond-order-wave or Peierls state is determined at weak antinesting. We show the existence of a positive isotope effect for spin-density-wave and d-wave superconducting critical temperatures which scales with the antinesting distance from quantum critical point where the two instabilities merge. We single out a low phonon frequency zone where the bond-oder-wave ordering gives rise to triplet f-wave superconductivity under nesting alteration, with both orderings displaying a negative isotope effect. We also study the electron-phonon strengthening of spin fluctuations at the origin of extended quantum criticality in the metallic phase above superconductivity. The impact of our results on quasi-one-dimensional organic conductors like the Bechgaard salts where a Peierls distortion is absent and superconductivity emerges near a spin-density-wave state under pressure is emphasized.

40|$|A type of pre-failure {{instability}} {{that occurs}} for medium loose to dense sand under fully drained conditions is studied in this paper. It is observed experimentally {{that when a}} specimen is sheared along a drained stress path involving {{a decrease in the}} effective mean stress, it becomes unstable after the stress path crosses an <b>instability</b> <b>line</b> (IL). The IL specifies a minimum stress ratio under which instability may occur. It is not unique but changes with the void ratio of the soil and the applied effective stresses.

30|$|The <b>instability</b> <b>line</b> (IL) {{obtained}} from undrained triaxial compression tests separates the potentially unstable stress {{states from the}} stable stress states and therefore constitutes the triggering stress conditions for soil liquefaction (Lade 1992). A soil specimen would liquefy with a rapid reduction of its undrained strength when the undrained stress path crosses IL. According to Fig.  9, IL becomes steeper with decreasing specimen size, which can have significant implications for liquefaction triggering and stability analysis. As liquefaction is triggered when the effective stress path crosses the IL, hence liquefaction triggering resistance increases with decreasing specimen size. Since a larger specimen (70  mm in Fig.  9) is a closer replicate of field soil, the in-situ liquefaction potential could be underestimated by triaxial test results on smaller 38  mm specimens.|$|E

Additional evidence is provided {{of the existence of}} a temperature T-IT, which we interpret as the onset of the tilt instability in the R phase, where tilting is initially frustrated by lattice disorder but achieves long-range order at the lower temperature T-T. The T-IT (x) line is observed for x < 0. 17, beginning at the T-T (x) line at the point where T-T (x) drops abruptly and then continuing up to the T-C (x) line. If T-IT (x) indeed signals the onset of short-range ordered tilting, then it follows that the tilt <b>instability</b> <b>lines</b> should tend to be attracted and merge with those of the polar instabilities.
