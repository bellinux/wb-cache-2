5|$|The {{microstructure}} of Gobioolithus eggshell has {{not been}} thoroughly studied, and heavy recrystallization of most specimens {{makes it difficult to}} examine the eggshell structure or pore system. The eggshell consists of two (or possibly three) structural layers. The inner layer, called the mammillary layer, is about half the thickness of the outer, or continuous, layer. On the outside, many specimens have a recrystallized outer layer. This could simply due to diagenesis or it could be a true <b>external</b> <b>zone,</b> which is a third layer present in most bird eggs but is rare in non-avian dinosaurs. However, a few specimens are unaffected by recrystallization.

These specimens also reveal an angusticanaliculate pore system, which means that the pores have a low density, and are long, narrow, and straight.|$|E

40|$|We {{interpret}} the strain and stress {{fields of the}} western / central Alpine arc {{on the basis of}} 2. 5 D finite element modelling and a recent seismotectonic synthesis.

Rotation of Apulia has a minor effect on the current strain or stress fields of the Alpine realm.

The original model is first outlined, and then a number of algorithms designed to speed up the application of the constraints are tested, the best one reducing the overall model running time by 60 %. <b>External</b> <b>zones</b> are considered in the context of constraints, and a much accelerated calibration technique based on a combination of Newton - Raphson and direct-search methods is introduced. The calibration of the model in Area 8 is described, and the problem of measuring and interpreting locational attraction is also addressed. Finally the implications of using the model in country structure planning are traced, in preparation for the application of the large-scale model which is under construction. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between proliferation rate {{and degree of}} differentiation has been studied in different regions of transplantable B 16 melanomas. The regions studied were peripheral parts of the tumours and the inner (perivascular) and outer (<b>external)</b> <b>zones</b> of so-called corded structures. The highest proliferation rates and the poorest cellular differentiation (estimated by volume densities of premelanosomes and melanosomes) occurred in the perivascular zones of corded structures. Conversely, the lowest proliferation rates and the best cellular differentiation was encountered in the <b>external</b> <b>zones</b> of corded structures. Proliferation rates and cellular differentiation in the peripheral parts of the tumours were intermediate between the values obtained in the perivascular or external regions of corded structures. The results in corded structures indicate an inverse {{relationship between}} proliferation rate and degree of differentiation, and {{a positive correlation between}} proliferative capacity and blood vessel proximity. The intermediate values in the peripheral parts of tumours may reflect the presence of a mixed population of cells which vary in their proximity to the nearest blood vessel. © 1984 Springer-Verlag.

50|$|The Arc has two sections: the Internal and External Zones.

Flysch units from the Cretaceous to Early Miocene are located between the External and Internal Zones.

40|$|International audienceMélange rocks outcrop {{widely in}} the central and western frontal sectors of the Betic Cordillera, {{as in many other}} collisional orogens where they form part of the accretionary wedges. Extrusion of Triassic plastic clays and evaporites was favored by the {{progressive}} accretion of the Betic <b>External</b> <b>Zones,</b> mixing rocks of different provenance and forming a synorogenic frontal mélange unit. MT data coupled with gravity data are a valid combined methodology to characterize the geometry of these mélange units, since the characterization of plastic rocks geometry is usually uncertain using seismic techniques. The results correlate well with known geological features (sedimentary basins, calcareous ranges, evaporitic rocks) and reveal the deep geometry. A resistive body, slightly dipping toward the SE, points to the continuity of the Iberian Massif below the Guadalquivir basin (2 °) and the <b>External</b> <b>Zones</b> (6 - 8 °). To the south, gravity models show the Iberian continental crust subducting below the Internal Zones with a roughly 20 - 35 ° slope. The main conductive bodies are related to the location of evaporitic rocks involved in the frontal mélange. They overlie the Iberian Massif and, southwards, the frontal Jurassic and Cretaceous limestone sequences of the External and Median Subbetics. In this setting, thick plastic rock units placed above the foreland could act as a lubricant facilitating continental subduction, and being progressively accreted toward a frontal mélange...|$|R

In order to evaluate its shelf life, {{a great number}} of quality attributes must be analyzed, which requires careful experimental design, and it is time consuming. In this study, the modified Global Stability Index method was applied to estimate the quality of butter lettuce at low relative humidity during storage discriminating three lettuce zones (internal, middle, and external). The results indicated that the most relevant attributes were: the <b>external</b> <b>zone</b> - relative water content, water content, ascorbic acid, and total mesophilic counts; middle zone - relative water content, water content, total chlorophyll, and ascorbic acid; internal zone - relative water content, bound water, water content, and total mesophilic counts.

Moreover, the Weibull distribution was applied to estimate the maximum vegetable storage time which was 5, 4, and 3 days for the internal, middle, and <b>external</b> <b>zone,</b> respectively.
