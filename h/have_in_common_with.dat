The endangered Growling Grass Frog (Litoria raniformis) has been sighted, though {{there is only a}} single record. In some undisturbed areas there is Poa labillardierei (silver tussock) grassland and Themeda triandra (kangaroo grass). Glycine latrobeana (clover glycine) was recorded south of the town in 1984. Discaria pubescens (Hairy Anchor Plant or Australian Anchor Plant), which appears on the states endangered species list, was recorded north-east in 2001 on the South Esk River's floodplain. Apart from introduced brown trout the Liffey River is home to platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus).

500|$|Andrew Garfield {{was given}} the role of Tommy, a well-meaning, rather dim young person who struggles {{to find a place}} in an {{environment}} which values imagination and creativity above all. He said of his character, [...] "There's a sense of anxiety that runs through these kids, especially Tommy, because he's so sensory and feeling and animalistic, that's my perspective of him." [...] Garfield was attracted to the film based on the existential questions the story expresses. He called the experience of being a part of Never Let Me Go a [...] "dream to come true". Garfield enjoys an opportunity to let loose with his roles. He said the scenes in which his character—unable to contain his frustration—erupts with a wail, was [...] "intense" [...] for him. [...] "I think those screams are inside all of us, I just got a chance to let mine out". Before shooting the film, he had read the screenplay and the book. In March 2009 Daily Variety reported that Knightley was signed to the project. Knightley admitted that she only agreed to appear in Never Let Me Go because co-star and friend Mulligan had asked her to. She portrays Ruth, a zealous, ambitious character who behaves manipulatively out of inner insecurity. When asked what she did and did not <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> <b>with</b> her character, Knightley said she was unable to relate to Ruth's situation of being involved in a love triangle.|$|E

2500|$|One thing James did <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> <b>with</b> Kierkegaard was {{respect for}} the single individual, and their {{respective}} comments may be compared in direct sequence as follows: [...] "A crowd is indeed made up of single individuals; it must therefore be in everyone's power to become what he is, a single individual; no one {{is prevented from being}} a single individual, no one, unless he prevents himself by becoming many. To become a crowd, to gather a crowd around oneself, is on the contrary to distinguish life from life; even the most well-meaning one who talks about that, can easily offend a single individual." [...] In his book A Pluralistic Universe, James stated that, [...] "Individuality outruns all classification, yet we insist on classifying every one we meet under some general label. As these heads usually suggest prejudicial associations to some hearer or other, the life of philosophy largely consists of resentments at the classing, and complaints of being misunderstood. But there are signs of clearing up for which both Oxford and Harvard are partly to be thanked." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to his essay, [...] "Practicing Patience: How Christians Should Be Sick", in Christians Among the Virtues, he {{said that}} Christians are called to be patient {{patients}} in sickness and in health because [...] "patience is integral to the Christian life". Patience cannot be first learned while being a patient. To learn patience, Christians are to exercise the virtue through deeds, truth, practice, and living it. Hauerwas also says that patience is a virtue we <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> <b>with</b> God. [...] "In Him, patience has its beginning, and from Him as its source it takes its splendor and dignity." [...] He also says that God showed us {{the best example of}} patience {{when it comes to the}} life of Jesus. Because God is the foundation, Hauerwas stated that “only patience shaped by Christ is true patience". As well as this, he later emphasized that patience is not developed by human will, but given through the Holy Spirit, who gives us the capacity to love, for “without [...] in us there cannot be patience because in good men it is the [...] of God which endures all things.” In the author’s essay, he gave people a framework of how to learn to practice patience when we are not sick: ...|$|E
2500|$|Committed, by the 1920s, to {{a highly}} {{personalized}} pacifist socialism, Aderca veered toward the far-left of politics: in Idei și oameni, he chided Romanian reformism, moderate Marxism as personified by Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea and the Second International. He decried the exploitation of workers and luxuries such as the casinos of Sinaia. Nonetheless, Crohmălniceanu, a Marxist, noted that Moartea unei republici roșii told little about how [...] "a new society is to be organized". Aderca favored [...] "a nonconformism of a mostly moral and aesthetic kind", where sexual freedom, creative liberty and the celebration Aderca approved of class conflict, with Marxism as a legitimiate tool of the masses: [...] "war is a creation of masters fighting each other for dominance. [...] What can the impoverished people <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> <b>with</b> the polite master? The French worker, what does he stand to gain from this war, other than a more thorough understanding of Marxism?" [...] Aderca's leftist leanings were incompatible with the neoliberalism of his mentor Eugen Lovinescu, something acknowledged by Aderca in his Mic tratat years. In Mărturia unei generații, Aderca challenged Lovinescu to answer on the subject. Lovinescu did so, noting that Sburătoruls celebration of individualism outweighed the neoliberal stance of its leader. In Aderca's work, socialism was doubled by a sarcastic view of traditional authority. Police officers opened a file on him when, in 1927, he mocked King Ferdinand I as a standard of barber shop posters. According to Dumitru Hîncu, although the comment irritated state security, it was not truly [...] "an attack on State institutions or its leaders".|$|E
2500|$|Guerrero teachers, {{including}} the students from Ayotzinapa, {{are known for}} their [...] "militant and radical protests that often involve hijacking buses and delivery trucks." [...] The appropriation of the vehicles was, according to the students, routine and temporary. Most of the buses are usually returned after the protests conclude. This tactic has largely been tolerated by law enforcement even though it is inconvenient for other users of public transport. Though federal agents tend not to actively confront students when they [...] "borrow" [...] buses, the practice puts students and teachers at odds with local officials. Other protest tactics used by the students include throwing rocks at police officers, blocking roads, and stealing property. Students claim those tactics are {{the only way to get}} attention and earn funds from the government. Local authorities in Guerrero tend to be suspicious of student protests because they suspect them of having ties with leftist guerrillas or rival political groups. In 1995, the Guerrero state police killed 17 farmers and injured 21 others when they were carrying out a protest. The massacre led to the creation of the Popular Revolutionary Army (Spanish: Ejército Popular Revolucionario), which is believed by some state officials to retain some political influence in Guerrero. Students claim to have no ties with such groups, and that the only thing they <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> <b>with</b> them is their socialist ideology. In addition, in places like Guerrero, where the bus companies are assumed to pay protection money, the student campaigns are seen as threatening to organized crime.|$|E
