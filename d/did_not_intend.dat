5|$|Despite her {{acquittal}} in {{the case}} of the murder of Patricia Jones, Kinne remained under charges for the murder of her husband, James Kinne. When jury selection began on January 8, 1962, District Attorney J. Arnott Hill noted that he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>intend</b> to pursue the death penalty {{in the case}}.|$|E
5|$|George's initial {{contract}} included eight to eleven episodes of recurring appearances, {{with the possibility}} of becoming a series regular. However, according to George's representative, she <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>intend</b> to do more than eight episodes. Harris was first planned to have a romance with Torres, but Rhimes eventually changed that after George started filming. She was initially written as a lesbian, but was revised as bisexual.|$|E

5|$|Baeyertz <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>intend</b> {{to convert}} to Christianity when she married him, but she {{subsequently}} did {{for the sake of}} her children. Her husband {{died as a result of}} a shooting accident in 1871, whereupon she experienced a full conversion to Christianity. She spent the following few years giving sermons and, by 1879, she was featured speaker for a YWCA campaign of sermons, before spending a decade conducting Christian missions around Victoria.|$|E
5|$|Fauré <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>intend</b> {{the eighth}} nocturne to appear under that designation. His {{publisher}} collected eight short piano pieces together and published them as 8 pièces brèves, allocating {{each of them}} a title unauthorised by the composer. The nocturne, the last piece in the set of eight, is shorter and less complex than its immediate predecessor, consisting of a song-like main theme with a delicate semiquaver accompaniment in the left hand.|$|E
5|$|Helen Clark (née Brinton) won {{the seat}} for Labour in 1997. She was {{defeated}} at the 2005 general election, following {{which it was}} widely reported that Clark was planning to defect to the Conservative Party, an announcement which was not popular locally. However, by early June it emerged that while {{she had left the}} Labour Party, she had not in fact joined the Conservatives and <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>intend</b> to.|$|E

5|$|In April, Bochco {{stated that}} he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>intend</b> to kill off Smits' character, Simone. On L.A. Law, Smits had {{returned}} to the show for critically acclaimed guest appearances during sweeps episodes after leaving his regular role. Whether Smits' character would overlap with Schroder's character on screen was undetermined when Schroder was announced in June, but at the time Season 6 production was scheduled to commence on August 10, 1998. As of mid-July, Smits' departing episode was not scheduled to film until September.|$|E
5|$|Moffat {{suggested}} {{the idea of}} the dream split to Nye, who was also influenced by his own dreams and sometimes wondering if they were real. Nye believed that the dream world was consistent with other alternate universes within Doctor Who. Moffat also instructed Nye {{to come up with a}} monster, and Nye chose the elderly people possessed by the Eknodine, reflecting his own fear of old people as a child, but he made clear that he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>intend</b> to make children scared of their grandparents.|$|E
5|$|The 1st Infantry Brigade, {{the only}} one trained to NATO standards, was serving in Iraq at the {{beginning}} of the war; on 11 August, the United States Air Force airlifted it to Georgia. The elite Georgian troops were overdue from Iraq and could not participate in the fighting. The presence of prime 2,000 Georgian military and the most Georgian high-level government officials abroad before the war meant that Georgia <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>intend</b> to attack.|$|E

5|$|The JNA {{responded by}} {{launching}} a major offensive in eastern Slavonia, {{from where it}} intended to progress west via Vinkovci and Osijek to Zagreb. The army did not bypass Vukovar, because they wished to relieve the besieged barracks and to eliminate a possible threat to their supply lines. The JNA leadership <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>intend</b> to make Vukovar {{the main focus of}} the offensive but, as happened with Stalingrad in the Second World War, an initially inconsequential engagement became an essential political symbol for both sides.|$|E
5|$|During the House of Representatives {{debate on}} the report, the Minister, Larry Anthony, stated that he had already asked fuel {{companies}} to check their tanker wagons {{for the presence of}} water after each replenishment, and the relevant Air Navigation Order would be amended to require fuel to be drained into transparent containers. He stated that his Department <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>intend</b> to amend the relevant Air Navigation Order to require pilots of four-engine aeroplanes to perform the periodic checks in a four-engine aeroplane because it considered it was more challenging to fly with one engine inoperative in a two-engine aeroplane than in a four-engine aeroplane.|$|E
5|$|Groves <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>intend</b> the Smyth Report to be {{the last}} word on the project. It formed an {{addendum}} to the Manhattan District History, the official history of the project. This eventually consisted of 35 volumes with 39 appendices or supplements. It was written in the immediate postwar years by the chemists, metallurgists, physicists, and administrators who had worked on the project. Since there were no security restrictions, it covered every aspect of the Manhattan Project, but was itself classified. Most of it was declassified in the 1960s and 1970s and became available to scholars, except for some technical details on the construction of the bombs.|$|E

5|$|In 1984, Brooks {{founded the}} {{television}} and film company, Gracie Films. Although he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>intend</b> to do so, Brooks returned to television in 1987 as the producer of The Tracey Ullman Show. He hired cartoonist Matt Groening to create a series of shorts for the show, which eventually led to The Simpsons in 1989. The Simpsons won numerous awards and is still running. Brooks also co-produced and co-wrote the 2007 film adaptation of the show, The Simpsons Movie. In total, Brooks has received 47 Emmy nominations, winning 20 of them.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the allegations, Sony stated that the game was not based on reality, and they believed they had adequate permissions necessary. They later added that the game was purely entertainment and fictional, comparing it to the television programme Doctor Who. Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair commented that though companies should have more responsibility and sensitivity to the feelings of others, the issue would be immensely difficult. Although the copyright concerns {{were found to be}} without merit, Sony offered a formal apology to the Church of England and leaders of the cathedral in July 2007, stating that they <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>intend</b> to cause offence.|$|E
5|$|Non-musical subjects, both {{religious}} and numerological, influenced Sorabji's music, too, {{and he took}} inspiration from various sources. His Fifth Piano Sonata (Opus archimagicum) is inspired by the tarot, and his Tāntrik Symphony for Piano Alone has seven movements titled after the bodily centres of Tantric and Shaktic yoga. The song Benedizione di San Francesco d'Assisi sets the text of a Catholic benediction. However, Sorabji <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>intend</b> the first two of these works to be programmatic, and he heaped scorn on attempts to represent stories or ideologies in music. Nevertheless, some of his works {{have been described as}} programmatic.|$|E

5|$|The Abbasid {{invasion}} of Asia Minor in 782 {{was one of}} the largest operations launched by the Abbasid Caliphate against the Byzantine Empire. The invasion was launched as a display of Abbasid military might {{in the aftermath of a}} series of Byzantine successes. Commanded by the Abbasid heir-apparent, the future Harun al-Rashid, the Abbasid army reached as far as Chrysopolis, across the Bosporus from the Byzantine capital, Constantinople, while secondary forces raided western Asia Minor and defeated the Byzantine forces there. As Harun <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>intend</b> to assault Constantinople and lacked ships to do so, he turned back.|$|E
5|$|The Bougainville Campaign {{began on}} 1November 1943 when the United States I Marine Amphibious Corps, under Major General Roy Geiger, landed at Empress Augusta Bay {{on the west}} coast of the Japanese-held island. The Allied {{invasion}} aimed to establish a defensive perimeter around Cape Torokina in which airfields would be built to attack the major Japanese base at Rabaul and support other operations in the region. The Allied forces <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>intend</b> to conquer the entire island, however, and the invasion area was selected {{on the grounds that it}} was lightly defended and distant from the main Japanese bases at the northern and southern ends of Bougainville.|$|E
5|$|The {{staff at}} Cherry Springs State Park <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>intend</b> {{for it to}} become an {{attraction}} for amateur astronomers; the astronomers came to them instead. In 1997or 1998Chip Harrison, the park supervisor, noticed a man looking through a telescope at the park at about 1AM. When Harrison asked why the man had come there, the astronomer said he had noticed an isolated black patch over north central Pennsylvania on nighttime satellite photos. Cherry Springs State Park is in that patch, {{one of the best}} locations east of the Mississippi River for stargazing.|$|E
