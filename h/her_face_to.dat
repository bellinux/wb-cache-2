5|$|In Braavos, Arya Stark (Maisie Williams) kills The Waif (Faye Marsay) {{and adds}} <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>to</b> the hall, stating to Jaqen H'ghar (Tom Wlaschiha) {{that she is}} {{returning}} to Westeros, no longer intending to be a Faceless Man. At Riverrun, Brienne of Tarth (Gwendoline Christie) unsuccessfully negotiates Sansa's request for help from the Blackfish (Clive Russell), and Jaime Lannister (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) returns Edmure Tully (Tobias Menzies) to the castle, with Edmure commanding they throw down their arms and surrender to the Lannisters.

5|$|The Combat: Woman Pleading for the Vanquished {{is a large}} painting, 399cm (13ft 1in) across. It {{depicts a}} {{defeated}} soldier, kneeling in front of another soldier. The defeated fighter strains to free himself from {{the grip of the}} victorious warrior, who stands, raising a sword. A kneeling woman clutches the waist of the victorious soldier, raising <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>to</b> him to beg him to spare his defeated foe. The defeated warrior has a stronger body, a face more in keeping with the conventions of attractiveness at the time, and a more sympathetic expression, while the victorious man is darker skinned and has an expression of blank fierceness. The vanquished soldier's sword has broken, and lies beside him on the ground.|$|E
5|$|After {{tying up}} Ms. Botz, the kids find all their {{telephones}} disabled (which Ms. Botz had done earlier) {{and go to}} a nearby payphone to alert the authorities. Meanwhile, Marge tries to call home to check up on the kids but because there is no answer, she and Homer decide to cancel their motel reservation and go home. They find Ms. Botz bound and gagged in front of the TV. Homer, thinking his children have gotten the best of another babysitter and unaware of her true identity, frees her and pays her handsomely. After advising Homer to keep both eyes on Bart, Ms. Botz makes a clean getaway, just seconds before the kids arrive with the police and news media to arrest her. As Bart tries to lead the police to the house, Homer attempts to berate him for his behavior towards Ms. Botz, only to be informed by a news reporter about Ms. Botz's true identity and that he just freed her. Realizing his mistake, a humiliated Homer attempts to save face by claiming he fought Botz and she escaped, then warning her on camera never to show <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>to</b> him again. Later that night, Homer moans about his blunder on TV, but Marge cheers him up by saying that if he raised three children who can hogtie a perfect stranger, he must be doing something right.|$|E
25|$|As Geneva {{shuttered}} {{itself in}} mourning, Elisabeth’s body {{was placed in}} a triple coffin: two inner ones of lead, the third exterior one in bronze, reposing on lion claws. On Tuesday, before the coffins were sealed, Franz Joseph's official representatives arrived to identify the body. The coffin was fitted with two glass panels, covered with doors, which could be slid back to allow <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>to</b> be seen.|$|E

25|$|Sultaana Freeman gained {{national}} attention in 2003 when she sued the US state of Florida {{for the right}} to wear a niqab for her driver's license photo.

25|$|On January 6, 1987, {{he began}} a hunger strike over his prison conditions. During a visit with his brother Asher and {{in a letter to}} his brother Meir, he complained, among other things, of being held in solitary {{confinement}} 23 hours a day. When Judy Zimmet traveled to Israel and asked to visit him in prison, prison authorities said they could only meet in the presence of prison officials and with them separated by a glass barrier. Vanunu rejected these conditions, demanding he be allowed to meet <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>to</b> face. He also filed three appeals to the Israeli Supreme Court protesting his conditions, which were rejected. After 33 days, Vanunu ended his hunger strike.|$|E
25|$|In Order of the Phoenix, Sirius gives Harry {{a mirror}} he {{originally}} used {{to communicate with}} James {{while they were in}} separate detentions. That mirror is a part of a set of Two-way Mirrors that are activated by holding one of them and saying the name of the other possessor, causing his or <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>to</b> appear on the caller's mirror and vice versa. Harry receives this mirror from Sirius in a package after spending his Christmas holiday at Grimmauld Place. Harry, at first, chooses not to open the package, although he does discover the mirror after Sirius's death, by which point it is no longer functional. It makes its second appearance in Deathly Hallows when Mundungus Fletcher loots Grimmauld Place and sells Sirius's mirror to Aberforth Dumbledore, who uses it to watch out for Harry in Deathly Hallows. When Harry desperately cries for help to a shard of the magical mirror (which broke in the bottom of his trunk), a brilliant blue eye belonging to Aberforth (which Harry mistakes for Albus's eye), appears and he sends Dobby, who arrives to help Harry escape from Malfoy Manor to Shell Cottage.|$|E

25|$|In 2002, Sultaana Freeman (formerly Sandra Keller, who {{converted}} to Islam in 1997 when marrying a Muslim man), sued the U.S. state of Florida {{for the right}} to wear a niqab for her driver's license photo. However, a Florida appellate court ruled that there was no violation in the state requiring her to show <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>to</b> a camera in a private room with only a female employee to take the picture, in exchange for the privilege of driving. The prevailing view in Florida is currently that hiding one's face on a form of photo identification defeats the purpose of having the picture taken, although 15 other states (including Arkansas, California, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, and Louisiana) have provisions that allow for driver's licenses absent of an identifying photograph in order to accommodate individuals who may have a religious reason to not have a photograph taken. In 2012, a string of armed robberies in Philadelphia were committed by people disguised in traditional Islamic woman's garb; Muslim leaders were concerned that the use of the disguises could put Muslim women in danger of hate crimes and inflame ethnic tensions.|$|E
500|$|The last {{significant}} work {{to treat}} the existence of pig-faced women as fact was Ghosts, Helpful and Harmful by ghost hunter and supernatural researcher Elliott O'Donnell, published in 1924. O'Donnell alleged that {{the ghost of a}} pig-faced lady haunted a house in Chelsea. O'Donnell claimed that the ghost was a [...] "Vice Elemental, the most harmful of all the denizens of the Spirit World". He describes how a clergyman, [...] "The Rev.MrH." [...] and his family, who resided in the house, were tempted by the ghost. The ghost, keeping her face concealed, led [...] "The Rev.MrH." [...] into drunkenness, and his children into cruelty towards animals, until they themselves behaved like pigs. She then revealed <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>to</b> the shocked family, who moved out of the house immediately.|$|E
500|$|Ned and Maude Flanders sing Maggie to {{bed with}} {{their own version of}} Sonny & Cher's song [...] "I Got You Babe". The Itchy & Scratchy cartoon that Lisa and Bart watch is called [...] "Foster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!", a {{reference}} to the 1965 film Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!. Flanders says that he used to let his sons watch My Three Sons, but it got them [...] "all worked up" [...] before bedtime. The headline of a newspaper that Marge gives to Lisa for her history project is [...] "40 Trampled at Poco Concert", a reference to American rock band Poco. While riding in Flanders's car, Maggie spins her head around with a scary smile on <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>to</b> look at Bart and Lisa, as in the 1973 film The Exorcist.|$|E

500|$|Although Lima {{wanted the}} {{animation}} to be nostalgic, he wanted Enchanted {{to have a}} style of its own. Baxter's team decided to use Art Nouveau as a starting point. For Giselle, the hand-drawn animated character had to be [...] "a cross between Amy Adams and a classic Disney princess. And not a caricature." [...] Seeing Giselle as [...] "a forest girl, an innocent nymph with flowers in her hair" [...] and [...] "a bit of a hippie", the animators {{wanted her to be}} [...] "flowing, with her hair and clothes. Delicate." [...] For Prince Edward, Baxter's team [...] "worked the hardest on him to make him look like the actor" [...] because princes [...] "in these kinds of movies are usually so bland." [...] Many prototypes were made for Narissa as Baxter's team wanted <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>to</b> [...] "look like Susan Sarandon. And the costumes had to align closely to the live-action design." ...|$|E
500|$|Fellini was {{a notorious}} perfectionist, {{and this could}} be trying for his cast. At an American Film Institute student seminar, Quinn spoke of Fellini's intransigence over {{selecting}} a box in which Zampanò carries his cigarette butts, scrutinizing over 500 boxes before finding just the right one: [...] "As for me, any of the boxes would have been satisfactory to carry the butts in, but not Federico". Quinn also recalled being particularly proud of a certain scene in which his performance had earned applause from onlookers on the set, only to receive {{a phone call from}} Fellini late that night informing him {{that they would have to}} re-do the entire sequence because Quinn had been too good: [...] "You see, you're supposed to be a bad, a terrible actor, but the people watching applauded you. They should have laughed at you. So in the morning we do it again." [...] As for Masina, Fellini insisted that she re-create the thin-lipped smile he had seen in her childhood photographs. He cut her hair by putting a bowl on her head and shearing off anything that wasn't covered up, afterwards plastering what remained with soap to give it a [...] "spiky, untidy look", then [...] "flicked talc into <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>to</b> give it the pallor of a kabuki performer." [...] He made her wear a World War I surplus cloak that was so frayed its collar cut into her neck. She complained: [...] "You're so nice and sweet to the others in the cast. Why are you so hard on me?" ...|$|E

2500|$|The Māori {{name for}} Stratford is Whakaahurangi, meaning {{face to the}} sky. The name is taken from {{a story of a}} Patea chieftainess named Ruapu-tahanga who, {{returning}} from a visit to Kawhia, camped overnight near the location of the current town. [...] Being a clear night, Ruaputahanga lay contemplating the stars when slumber overtook her. [...] Withdrawing in respect, her followers observed that their chieftainess slept [...] "with <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>to</b> the sky". [...] The site continued {{to be used as a}} camping place for Māori along what became known as the Whakaahurangi track, linking the south Taranaki tribes to those in north Taranaki, and further north to Kawhia. [...] Each traveling party would recollect the story of Ruapu-tahanga sleeping with <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>to</b> the sky. The name is fitting, given the exposure of the area to a broad horizon on the face of the mountain’s ring plain.|$|E
2500|$|The younger of the Demon sisters. Kneesocks is a red-skinned demon dressed {{similarly}} {{to her sister}} but wears glasses and has blue hair worn in a ponytail. Unlike her sister, Kneesocks only has a single horn, on her forehead.

She is prone to blushing whenever she does get excited, which causes <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>to</b> turn a lighter shade of red. She wears two kneesocks that transform {{into a pair of}} scythes called [...] Her design is a partial reference to the character Yoko, from Gainax's previous series Gurren Lagann.|$|E

She orders one of her servants {{to find out who}} Hellena is and storms out. Hellena asks what Willmore was doing in Angellica's house; he denies that anything transpired. Hellena then attacks him, quoting to him what he had just said about Angellica [...] She makes Willmore promise never to see Angellica again.|$|E
