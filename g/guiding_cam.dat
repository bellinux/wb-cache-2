40|$|Background. Use of {{complementary}} {{and alternative}} medicine (CAM) by children with cancer is high; however, pediatric best cases are rare. Objectives. To investigate whether best cases exist in pediatric oncology using a three-phase approach and to compare our methods with other such programs. Methods. In phase I, Children’s Oncology Group (COG) oncologists were approached via email {{and asked to}} recall patients who were (i) under 18 when diagnosed with cancer, (ii) diagnosed between 1990 and 2006, (iii) had unexpectedly positive clinical outcome, and (iv) reported using CAM during or after cancer treatment. Phase II involved partnering with CAM research networks; patients who were self-identified as best cases were asked to submit reports completed in conjunction with their oncologists. Phase III extended this partnership to 200 CAM associations and training organizations. Results. In phase I, ten cases from three COG sites were submitted, and most involved use of traditional Chinese medicine to improve quality of life. Phases II and III did not yield further cases. Conclusion. Identification of best cases has been suggested as {{an important step in}} <b>guiding</b> <b>CAM</b> research. The CARE Best Case Series Program had limited success in identifying pediatric cases despite the three approaches we used...|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} about {{developing}} controller software system for cam manufacturing machine by using cam parametric equations as a <b>guide.</b> <b>Cam</b> development {{is based on}} the cam shapes, follower types, and also the applications. Performance of a cam profile affects the speed of the system and the higher the speed, the system will experience more vibrations which lead to defectiveness of the system. These vibrations also may occur due to sudden acceleration of the cam surface once they were produced with unsmooth surface. In order to produce highly performance of cam, it has to have a smoothest surface of contact with the follower. The objective of this project is divided to two most important criteria which to derive a parametric equation system for both x and y axis from a relative cam parametric equation of motion and also to simulate a cam profile using parametric equation of motion by programming methods. The results of this project are from both graphical and programming methods and the results of each cam motions will be discussed. Finally, for conclusion and recommendation of this project, we will conclude the results and whether the objective of this project is achieved and we will also recommend little recommendation on how to improve the results obtain for further research to come...|$|R

40|$|The {{success of}} {{flexible}} instruments in surgery requires high motion and force fidelity and controllability of the tip. However, the friction {{and the limited}} stiffness of such instruments limit the motion and force transmission of the instrument. In a previous study, we developed a flexible multibody model of a surgical instrument inside an endoscope in order to study {{the effect of the}} friction, bending and rotational stiffness of the instrument and clearance on the motion hysteresis and the force transmission. In this paper, we present the design and evaluation of an experimental setup for the validation of the flexible multibody model and the characterization of the instruments. A modular design was conceived based on three key functionalities: the actuation from the proximal end, the displacement measurement of the distal end, and the measurement of the interaction force. The exactly constrained actuation module achieves independent translation and rotation of the proximal end. The axial displacement and the rotation of the distal end are measured contactless via a specifically designed air bearing <b>guided</b> <b>cam</b> through laser displacement sensors. The errors in the static measurement are 15 [*]μm in translation and 0. 15 deg in rotation. Six 1 -DOF load cell modules using flexures measure the interaction forces and moments with an error of 0. 8 % and 2. 5 %, respectively. The achieved specifications allow for the measurement of the characteristic behavior of the instrument inside a curved rigid tube and the validation of the flexible multibody model...|$|R

50|$|The IWI NEGEV is a gas-operated {{selective}} fire {{light machine}} gun that uses propellant gases from the barrel to cycle a short-stroke gas piston operating system under the barrel and a rotary bolt locking mechanism. The bolt itself features 4 radial locking lugs that engage the barrel extension and its rotation is controlled by a pin on the bolt body, which rides inside a <b>camming</b> <b>guide</b> machined into the bolt carrier. The bolt contains a spring-powered casing extractor unit, while a lever ejector is housed inside the receiver (it is rotated by the recoiling bolt carrier).|$|R
50|$|The FNC is a {{selective}} fire weapon {{that uses a}} gas-operated long-stroke piston system and a rotating bolt locking mechanism equipped with two locking lugs that engage corresponding recesses in the barrel extension. The bolt is rotated and unlocked by {{the interaction of the}} bolt's cam pin with a <b>camming</b> <b>guide</b> contained in the bolt carrier. Overall, the mechanism strongly resembles that of Kalashnikov rifles, but adapted to more advanced design and production methods. The rear part of the cocking handle slot, cut in the upper receiver for the cocking handle, is covered by a spring-loaded cover which automatically opens by the handle when it goes back and automatically closes the opening when the cocking handle returns forward.|$|R
2500|$|Behind {{the bolt}} carrier is a plastic or metal buffer, which rests {{in line with}} a return spring. The buffer spring begins to push the bolt carrier and bolt back toward the chamber once it is {{compressed}} sufficiently. A groove machined into the upper receiver <b>guides</b> the bolt <b>cam</b> pin and prevents it and the bolt from rotating into a closed position. The bolt's locking lugs push a fresh round from the magazine as the bolt moves forward. The round is guided by feed ramps into the chamber. As the bolt's locking lugs move past the barrel extension, the cam pin twists into a pocket milled into the upper receiver. This twisting action follows the groove cut into the carrier and forces the bolt to twist and [...] "lock" [...] into the barrel extension.|$|R
50|$|With the {{exception}} of the L98A1, the SA80 system is a selective fire gas-operated design that uses ignited powder gases bled through a port in the barrel to provide the weapon's automation. The rifle uses a short-stroke gas piston system located above the barrel, which is fed gas through a three-position adjustable gas regulator. The first gas setting is used for normal operation, the second is for use in difficult environmental conditions, while the third setting prevents any gas from reaching the piston and is used to launch rifle grenades. The weapon uses a rotating cylindrical bolt that contains seven radially mounted locking splines, an extractor and casing ejector. The bolt's rotation is controlled by a cam stud that slides inside a helical <b>camming</b> <b>guide</b> machined into the bolt carrier.|$|R
50|$|The Minimi uses a gas-actuated {{long-stroke}} piston system. The barrel {{is locked}} with a rotary bolt, equipped with two massive locking lugs, forced into battery by a helical <b>camming</b> <b>guide</b> in the bolt carrier. Upon firing, the piston {{is forced to}} the rear by expanding propellant gases bled through a port in the barrel near the muzzle end. The piston rod acts against the bolt carrier, which begins its rearward motion guided on two rails welded to the receiver walls, while the bolt itself remains locked. This sequence provides a slight delay that ensures chamber pressure has dropped to a safe level {{by the time a}} cam in the bolt carrier rotates and unlocks the bolt, increasing extraction reliability as the empty cartridge casing has had the time to cool down and contract, exerting less friction against the chamber walls.|$|R
50|$|The rifle's {{operation}} during firing and reloading {{is identical}} {{to that of the}} AKM. After ignition of the cartridge primer and propellant, rapidly expanding propellant gases are diverted into the gas cylinder above the barrel through a vent near the muzzle. The build-up of gases inside the gas cylinder drives the long-stroke piston and bolt carrier rearward and a <b>cam</b> <b>guide</b> machined into the underside of the bolt carrier along with an ejector spur on the bolt carrier rail guide, rotates the bolt approximately 35° and unlocks it from the barrel extension via a camming pin on the bolt. The moving assembly has about 5.5 mm of free travel which creates a delay between the initial recoil impulse of the piston and the bolt unlocking sequence, allowing gas pressures to drop to a safe level before the seal between the chamber and the bolt is broken. Like previous Kalashnikov-pattern rifles, the AK-74 does not have a gas valve; excess gases are ventilated through a series of radial ports in the gas cylinder. Since the Kalashnikov operating system offers no primary extraction upon bolt rotation, the 5.45×39mm AK-74 bolt has a larger extractor claw than the 7.62×39mm AKM for increased extraction reliability. Other minor modifications were made to the bolt and carrier assembly.|$|R
50|$|The Stoner 63 {{series of}} weapons are gas-operated, air-cooled, belt or magazine-fed and in rifle and carbine configuration, fire from a closed bolt to ensure maximum accuracy, or in machine gun mode, {{fire from the}} open bolt {{position}} to prevent cook-offs and enhance cooling. The weapon has a rotary bolt locking mechanism with 7 radially symmetrical locking lugs that engage a series of recesses in the barrel extension, and is actuated by a conventional long-stroke piston. The radial arrangement of locking lugs distributes the firing load evenly around the bolt head and barrel socket, reducing stress and increasing the longevity of these critical components. Attached to the piston extension is the bolt carrier which {{is equipped with a}} curved <b>cam</b> track that <b>guides</b> the bolt's <b>cam</b> pin (retained by the firing pin) and rotates the bolt 22.5° during the movement of the piston to either lock or unlock the bolt from behind the abutments in the barrel socket. Incorporated into the bolt carrier/piston group is an anti-bounce device, consisting of a 4 in carbide rod that rides within the piston extension’s hollow interior and moves back and forth during the recoil and counter-recoil cycles, reducing bolt bounce and preventing the possibility of firing out of battery during closed bolt firing (in the Rifle/Carbine models).|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{contributes}} to an emergent area on consumer value co-creation {{in a rapidly}} growing and exciting ‘new’ service market, Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) health services. The market for CAM health services is experiencing strong growth as consumers look for greater value, choice and control in managing their health. Despite the growth in this large health service market there is a paucity of research from a service marketing and consumer behaviour perspective. Yet, understanding what CAM consumers’ value and how they co-create value with CAM health services has important managerial implications. The purpose {{of this research is}} to explore what value CAM consumers’ gain and how they co-create value from their consumption experiences with CAM health services. The research adopts an interpretive approach employing an exploratory case study research strategy, using qualitative methods and an adapted version of the visual elicitation technique ZMET. The research process is semi-longitudinal and is conducted in three phases over a 12 month period. Sixteen CAM consumers with ‘lifestyle’ health complaints who use CAM health services participated in the study. The findings reveal eight consumer value components including: quality of care, treatment efficiency, physical environment, esteem value, social value, spiritual value, ethics and play. A consumer value model for CAM health services and potentially all health care services is proposed. Significantly this research found that CAM consumers co-create value on three levels according to their: approach to health care, preferred ‘consumer value co-creation relationship styles’ and engagement in ‘consumer value co-creation activities’. Consequently this thesis presents a typology of consumer value co-creation in CAM health services and develops a consumer value co-creation framework that can potentially be used for all health services. This research {{contributes to}} service marketing and consumer behaviour theory by extending the concepts of ‘consumer value’ and ‘value co-creation’ to incorporate findings from the CAM health service sector. The managerial implications of this research could help <b>guide</b> both <b>CAM</b> health care and mainstream medical practices to provide better health services and ultimately improved health outcomes for health care consumers. Future research could implement the unique three phase semi-longitudinal process and visual methods developed in this research, in various health care and service settings...|$|R
