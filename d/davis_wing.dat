2500|$|The Model 31 {{was a new}} {{flying boat}} design started in 1938, {{intended}} for both military and commercial use. [...] The aircraft was of all-metal construction with a high-mounted, high aspect ratio cantilever monoplane wing (the <b>Davis</b> <b>wing,</b> which was later used in the B-24 Liberator) and an upswept aft fuselage with a tail unit with twin endplate fins and rudders. It had retractable floats on the undersides of the wings and was powered {{by two of the}} new Wright R-3350 radial engines. The civil version could carry seats for 52 passengers, or sleeper accommodation for 28.|$|E
2500|$|The {{introduction}} in January 1943 of the Consolidated C-87 Liberator Express, {{a design}} {{modification of the}} B-24D heavy bomber, boosted tonnage figures. Its high-altitude capability enabled it to surmount the lower mountains (15,000â€“16000 feet MSL) without resorting to the passes, but the type had a high accident rate and was unsuited to the airfields then in use. Despite having four engines, the C-87 climbed poorly with heavy loads, as did its bomber counterparts, and often crashed on takeoff if an engine was lost. Its poor cockpit illumination was inadequate for bad weather flying and often failed during instrument takeoffs, its electrical and hydraulic systems frequently froze at high altitude and malfunctioned, and its flight deck heating system was prone to produce either stifling heat or none at all. Attributed by its pilots to its slim <b>Davis</b> <b>wing,</b> the C-87 also {{had a tendency to}} spin out of control when encountering even mild icing conditions over the mountains. One Hump pilot called the variant [...] "an evil, bastard contraption" [...] and a [...] "ground-loving bitch" [...] that [...] "could not carry enough ice to chill a highball".|$|E

50|$|The new Model 32 {{combined}} designer David R. <b>Davis's</b> <b>wing,</b> a high-efficiency airfoil design {{created by}} unorthodox means, with the twin tail design from the Consolidated Model 31 flying boat, {{together on a}} new fuselage. This new fuselage was intentionally designed around twin bomb bays, each one being {{the same size and}} capacity of the B-17 bomb bays.|$|R
50|$|The thick {{profile of}} the wing quickly led to it being superseded. Although {{aerodynamic}} tests prior to the war had demonstrated that high-speed drag was strongly associated with thick wing profiles due to wave drag, it was only late in the war that higher speeds made that an insoluble problem. As speeds of aircraft increased, the <b>Davis</b> <b>wing's</b> reduced low-speed drag could not compensate for its increased high-speed drag.|$|R

50|$|Fleet {{allowed it}} to be used on Consolidated's new twin engine flying boat, the Model 31 XP4Y Corregidor. The Model 31 made its first flight on 5 May 1939, vindicating the <b>Davis</b> <b>wing.</b> By this point Consolidated was already working on a secret project for a new bomber to improve on the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress that was just {{entering}} service, and had selected the <b>Davis</b> <b>wing</b> for this project as well. The Model 32, which would become the B-24 Liberator, first flew on 29 December 1939. The same basic wing would also be selected for the Consolidated B-32 Dominator.|$|E
5000|$|The B-24 had a {{shoulder}} mounted high aspect ratio <b>Davis</b> <b>wing.</b> This wing was highly efficient allowing {{a relatively high}} airspeed and long range. Compared to the B-17 it had a 6-foot larger wingspan, but a lower wing area. This gave the B-24 a 35% higher wing loading. The relatively thick wing held the promise of increased tankage while delivering increased lift and speed, but became unpleasant to fly when committed to heavier loadings as experienced at high altitude and in bad weather. The <b>Davis</b> <b>wing</b> was also more susceptible to ice formation than contemporary designs, causing distortions of the aerofoil section and resulting {{in the loss of}} lift (unpleasant experiences drawing such comments as 'The <b>Davis</b> <b>wing</b> won't hold enough ice to chill your drink'.) [...] The wing was also more susceptible to damage than the B-17's wing, making the aircraft less able to absorb battle damage. The wing carried four supercharged radial engines mounted in cowlings borrowed from the PBY Catalina (except being oval in cross-section, with oil coolers mounted {{on each side of the}} engine), turning 3-bladed variable-pitch propellers.|$|E
5000|$|After {{working for}} Bendix Aviation he joined Consolidated Aircraft, where {{he led the}} {{aerodynamic}} design effort of the Consolidated XP4Y Corregidor and the Consolidated B-24 Liberator. In particular, {{he was one of}} the engineers responsible for the incorporation of the <b>Davis</b> <b>wing</b> in these designs. [...] At Consolidated Aircraft, he also gained extensive experience in the design of controls for aircraft.|$|E
50|$|Initial {{results of}} the Caltech wind tunnel tests were disappointing. Test {{instruments}} did not support Davis' predictions. However, Davis and others determined that the Caltech wind tunnel's instruments were not sufficiently sensitive to detect improvements from the <b>Davis</b> <b>wing</b> tests, despite being among the most sophisticated of their kind at the time. After re-calibration of the Caltech wind tunnel instruments, tests showed significantly improved readings.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Davis</b> <b>wing</b> is an {{aircraft}} wing design {{that was used}} for some time {{on a variety of}} World War II aircraft, most notably a number of designs from Consolidated Aircraft, the most notable being the Consolidated B-24 Liberator. Thicker and with lower drag than most contemporary designs, it allowed high speeds and lift even at high angles of attack. Its use ended almost immediately following World War Two.|$|E
50|$|The U.S. Army Air Corps {{awarded a}} {{contract}} for the prototype XB-24 in March 1939, with the requirement that one example should be ready {{before the end of}} the year. Consolidated finished the prototype and had it ready for its first flight two days before the end of 1939. The design was simple in concept but, nevertheless, advanced for its time. Consolidated incorporated innovative features such as a tricycle landing gear and <b>Davis</b> <b>wing.</b>|$|E
50|$|The test {{crews were}} {{impressed}} with its unique reversible-pitch inboard propellers and the <b>Davis</b> <b>wing</b> which gave it excellent landing performance. However, they found a number of faults: the cockpit had an extremely high noise level and a poor instrument layout, the bombardier's vision was impaired, it was overweight and the nacelle design resulted in frequent engine fires (a deficiency shared with the B-29 Superfortress). However, the testing missions were mostly successful.|$|E
50|$|Only {{later was}} the reason for the Davis wing's {{performance}} properly understood. Largely through accident, the shape maintained laminar flow further back from its leading edge, to about 20 or 30% of chord compared to the 5 to 20% managed by most aerofoil sections of the era. Although other designs greatly improved on this, with some designs maintaining laminar flow to upwards of 60% of chord, the <b>Davis</b> <b>wing</b> represented a great improvement at the time. In retrospect, the cross-section shows some resemblance to the NACA 6-series airfoils used on the North American P-51 Mustang.|$|E

50|$|At its inception, the B-24 was {{a modern}} design {{featuring}} a highly efficient shoulder-mounted, high aspect ratio <b>Davis</b> <b>wing.</b> The wing gave the Liberator a high cruise speed, long range {{and the ability}} to carry a heavy bomb load. Early RAF Liberators were the first aircraft to cross the Atlantic Ocean as a matter of routine. However, the type was difficult to fly and had poor low speed performance. It also had a lower ceiling and was less robust than the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress. While aircrews tended to prefer the B-17, General Staff favored the B-24, and procured it {{for a wide variety of}} roles.|$|E
5000|$|The Model 33 {{on which}} Consolidated based its {{proposal}} {{was similar to}} the B-24 Liberator. Like the B-24 it was originally designed with a twin tail and a large <b>Davis</b> <b>wing,</b> but with a longer, rounder fuselage and a rounded nose. The powerplants were to be the same quartet of eighteen-cylinder, [...] Wright Duplex-Cyclones, as specified for B-29s. The aircraft was designed to be pressurized, and have remote-controlled retractable gun turrets with fourteen [...]50 in machine guns. It was to have an estimated gross weight of 101000 lb. The first contract for two XB-32s was signed on 6 September 1940, the same day as the contract for the Boeing prototype XB-29.|$|E
5000|$|A private {{hospital}} {{was founded in}} 1922 and on August 22, the province granted a Charter of Incorporation for the York County Hospital Corporation. York County Hospital became a public hospital in 1924. In 1927 the new hospital building was completed by architects Craig and Madill. In 1946, the Margaret Johnson <b>Davis</b> <b>Wing</b> opened with 55 beds. In 1956, the South Wing opened and a six-storey tower opened in 1964. Capacity was increased to 420 beds {{with the opening of}} the East Wing in 1976. On September 12, 1998, the name of the hospital was changed from York County Hospital to the present name. In 1999, a project to further expand the hospital was begun ...|$|E

50|$|The C-87 was {{not always}} popular with the aircrews {{assigned}} to fly it. The aircraft had the distressing habit of losing all cockpit electrical power on takeoff or at landings, its engine power and reliability with the less-powerful superchargers also often left much to be desired. It proved to be quite vulnerable to icing conditions, and was prone to fall into a spin with even small amounts of ice accumulated onto its <b>Davis</b> <b>wing.</b> Since the aircraft had been {{designed to be a}} bomber that dropped its loads while airborne, the C-87's nose landing gear was not designed for landing with a heavy load, and frequently it collapsed from the stress. Fuel leaks inside the crew compartment from the hastily modified long-range fuel system were an all-too-common occurrence. Lastly, unlike a typical purpose-designed transport, the B-24 was not designed to tolerate large loading variations because most of its load was held on fixed bomb racks. Consequently, it was relatively easy for a poorly trained ground crew to load a C-87 with its center of gravity too far forward or aft, rendering the aircraft difficult to control due to inadequate or excessive longitudinal stability. In his autobiography, Fate is the Hunter, the writer Ernest K. Gann reported that, while flying air cargo in India, he barely avoided crashing an improperly loaded C-87 into the Taj Mahal. As soon as more dependable Douglas C-54 Skymaster and Curtiss-Wright C-46 Commando transports became available in large numbers, C-87s were rapidly phased out of combat zone service, with some later used as VIP transports or B-24 flight crew trainers.|$|E
5000|$|The five {{case studies}} are {{organized}} by chapter. Chapter 2 regards airfoil design generally. The early work of Davis illustrates how useful engineering {{has been done}} by people who have no formal training in engineering. The <b>Davis</b> <b>wing</b> was instrumental even though Davis did not have the theoretical basis to know how or why. Chapter 3 is about how engineers design in accord with flying qualities satisfactory to pilots. This case study illustrates there can be a key relationship between human behavior and engineering requirements that can greatly affect the outcomes. As such, [...] "artifactual design is a social activity." [...] Chapter 4 instructs the importance of control-volume analysis situations in mechanical design. Control volume analysis was missing in physics textbooks at the time. Thus, engineers had a scientific requirement that was not addressed adequately by any natural science. Importantly, such case studies are examples of why {{there is such a thing}} as [...] "engineering science". Chapter 5 regards the dynamic problem of propeller design and selection. The propeller case study illustrates how engineers develop methods to account for the absence of required scientific theory. In this case [...] "parameter variation" [...] was used to map-out and survey a subject where no comprehensive scientific theory (in physics) existed. Finally, chapter 6 describes the problem of designing flush-riveted joints for aircraft. This case study conveys how requirements of production can have a reverse influence on design thus driving iterations between production and design. This case study also illustrates how there are aspects of engineering that cannot adequately be described as science such as the [...] "feel" [...] rivet mechanics developed for how much pressure to apply when completing the aircraft's aluminum stressed-skin structure (see [...] "tacit knowledge" [...] discussion below).|$|E
