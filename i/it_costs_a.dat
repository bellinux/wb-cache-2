5|$|The Northeast Extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike {{uses the}} ticket system method of tolling between the Mid-County and Wyoming Valley toll plazas {{along with the}} {{mainline}} Pennsylvania Turnpike. With the ticket system, a motorist receives a ticket upon entering the turnpike at an interchange and pays the fare and surrenders the ticket upon exiting. If a motorist loses the ticket, the turnpike charges the highest fare to the exit where the motorist leaves. Mainline toll plazas are also located at Keyser Avenue and Clarks Summit, charging a flat rate. There are no tolls on exit ramps between Wyoming Valley and Clarks Summit. E-ZPass is accepted at all toll plazas. As of 2017, <b>it</b> <b>costs</b> <b>a</b> passenger vehicle $12.10 to travel {{the length of the}} Northeast Extension between Mid-County and Wyoming Valley using cash and $8.54 using E-ZPass. The Keyser Avenue and Clarks Summit toll plazas cost $1.45 using cash and $0.81 using E-ZPass for passenger vehicles.|$|E
5|$|As with {{previous}} Megami Tensei games, demons {{are central to}} combat. They are acquired by the player through real-time negotiation: upon contacting a demon, they must successfully negotiate a conversation with them which can entail either friendly persuasion or intimidation of a demon. Once a demon is allied with the player, they aid them in combat: only one demon can be summoned at any one time, and when summoned that demon follows the player around as they navigate environments. Each time a demon is summoned, <b>it</b> <b>costs</b> <b>a</b> certain amount of magnetite, an in-game currency. Several demons can be held by them on the go, while further demons {{can be stored in}} Shinjuku Babel. Demons and the player gain experience levels separately: when the avatar has gained a level, they can assign stat points to various attributes. These in turn effect their abilities in battle and further skill development. Two different demons can be fused into a new demon in a location known as the Cathedral of Shadows: upon fusion, the new demon can inherit different skills from its demon parents. The skills a demon possesses can be altered or enhanced depending on their use in battles.|$|E

She also said that she rejected their subsequent offers because they were nothing more than offers to sell their [...] "commercially available member mailing list" [...] and advertising space in their magazine and newsletter, which are available to anyone. The American Association for the Advancement of Science publication ScienceNOW published an assessment discussing both sides of the NSTA decision in which it was reported that [...] "David says NSTA's imprimatur [...] was essential and that buying a mailing list is a nonstarter.

500|$|Undaunted {{by these}} rebukes from {{prominent}} West Virginian politicians, Johnson remained the leading advocate {{for a state}} institution for the blind. With help from friends and other educated blind people, he was granted {{the use of the}} legislative chamber of the West Virginia House of Delegates to present an exhibition of [...] "music, [...] recitation, and class drill" [...] with a delegation including his brother James and blind educator Susan Ridenour. Johnson's exhibition attracted a large audience, and after the performance he delivered an impassioned plea to West Virginia lawmakers to establish a state school for West Virginia's blind youth. The exhibition and Johnson's speech were praised by the legislators, most notably Joseph Wheat (who had previously rebuffed his proposal). The day before Johnson's presentation, Wheat declared his opposition to the bill and advocated its defeat; after Johnson's speech he [...] "pressed up to [...] and grasping his hand, said earnestly, 'Johnson, I'll vote for your bill if <b>it</b> <b>costs</b> <b>a</b> hundred thousand dollars.|$|E

The average toll rate for the turnpike is [...] using cash and [...] using E-ZPass. Since 2009, the turnpike has raised tolls once a year, starting on January 1, to provide funding for increasing annual payments to PennDOT, as mandated by Act 44. As part of Act 89 signed in 2013, the annual payments to PennDOT will end after 2022 (35 years earlier than the original proposal under Act 44), but it is not known if the annual toll increases will continue after 2022. With the annual rise in tolls, traffic has been shifting from the turnpike to local roads.|$|E

500|$|In 1978, Dylan {{embarked}} on a year-long world tour, performing 114 shows in Japan, the Far East, Europe and the US, to a total audience of two million. Dylan assembled an eight-piece band and three backing singers. Concerts in Tokyo in February and March were released as the live double album, Bob Dylan At Budokan. Reviews were mixed. Robert Christgau awarded the album a C+ rating, giving the album a derisory review, while Janet Maslin defended it in Rolling Stone, writing: [...] "These latest live versions of his old songs {{have the effect of}} liberating Bob Dylan from the originals." [...] When Dylan brought the tour to the U.S. in September 1978, the press described the look and sound as a 'Las Vegas Tour'. The 1978 tour grossed more than $20million, and Dylan told the Los Angeles Times that he had debts because [...] "I had a couple of bad years.

500|$|After {{completing}} the album, Sony hired Bojan Bazelli {{to direct the}} song's music video. After filming the video's first version, record label executives felt the result was sub-par {{in comparison to the}} quality of the music. They scrapped the first video and re-filmed it with director Andy Morahan, changing the plot, scenery and imagery. After word got out of the two videos, a Sony employee spoke to the press about Carey, saying how [...] "the special treatment really upset" [...] him. He felt they treated Carey differently from how they would another artist signed to the label, and that they viewed her as a higher priority. He also claimed that Carey was the reason they re-filmed, [...] "they spend $200,000 on a video and Mariah doesn't like it. No big deal." [...] Another employee estimated the figure of both videos at over $450,000. After the reports were made, Don Ienner, the president of Sony, refuted the claims, calling them [...] "total bullshit" [...] although admitting, [...] "If we're going to take the time and effort that we did with Mariah, on every level, then we're going to image her the right way. If <b>it</b> <b>costs</b> <b>a</b> few extra dollars to make a splash in terms of the right imaging, you go ahead and do it." ...|$|E
500|$|Margaret Hale (Daniela Denby-Ashe) and {{her parents}} Maria (Lesley Manville) and Richard (Tim Pigott-Smith) move to the (fictional) {{industrial}} town of Milton, Darkshire, {{in the north of}} England because her father, a clergyman, decides to leave the Church of England and become a Nonconformist. [...] Thanks to his friend, Mr. Bell (Brian Protheroe), he is able to find a house and gains employment as a private tutor. [...] One of his pupils is local mill-owner John Thornton (Richard Armitage), who gets off to a bad start with Margaret when she witnesses him beating a worker whom he has caught smoking in the mill, thus endangering all the workers. Gradually, Margaret gets used to Thornton, but his mother Hannah (Sinéad Cusack) and sister Fanny (Jo Joyner) disapprove of her, believing her haughty and alien to the customs of the North. In the meantime, Margaret attempts to do charitable work among the working classes, and thus comes into contact with Nicholas Higgins (Brendan Coyle) and his daughter, Bessy (Anna Maxwell Martin), who contracted Pneumoconiosis from exposure to the cotton-fibres in the mills. [...] When Bessy became ill at Hamper's Mill, her father moved her to Marlborough Mills, Thornton's mill, because the working environment is better there. In a meeting with fellow mill owners, Thornton says he had a wheel for ventilation installed in all of the rooms of his factory, despite the fact that <b>it</b> <b>costs</b> <b>a</b> great deal of money. The other industrialists had refused to install a wheel because of the expense.|$|E
