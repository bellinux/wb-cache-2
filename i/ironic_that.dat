5|$|Mother Jones {{magazine}} additionally commented {{upon the}} key theme of satire over {{conflict between the}} critical success of Star Trek and the decision to cancel the program by the studio executives. The magazine noted that writer Michael O'Donoghue's work for the sketch was among the highest caliber scripts he had written for Saturday Night Live. Mother Jones found it <b>ironic</b> <b>that</b> in the sketch the Enterprise was defeated not by its traditional enemies such as the Klingons, but by a stupid NBC executive {{in charge of the}} network's programming schedule.|$|E
5|$|As a child, Dalton felt {{jealous of}} boys {{for the freedom}} they enjoyed. They could travel alone without {{worrying}} about their reputation and were often bribed to attend school, while girls were, in her opinion, educated reluctantly. One of her teachers {{thought it would be}} wasteful for her to study algebra, as she already had sufficient education for a housewife. As a young woman, she felt that women lived on a higher moral level than men. She saw polygamy as a way to allow more women to marry the few good men, arguing that it gave more women the opportunity to marry. She also considered it <b>ironic</b> <b>that</b> prostitution was tolerated but polygamy was considered depraved.|$|E
5|$|During {{the summer}} of 2006, after {{wrapping}} up the production and recording of their debut album, Into the Rush, Aly & AJ began recording their first Christmas album. Antonina Armato and Tim James {{who worked on the}} duo's debut album and several other Disney-related acts, were recruited to executive produce the effort. They anticipated finishing the album {{by the end of the}} summer, in order for it to be released for the holiday season. Aly & AJ thought it <b>ironic</b> <b>that</b> they were prepping a Christmas album during the hottest days of the year. Alyson Michalka told the Saginaw News that producers Armato and James filled the studio with Christmas decorations, Christmas cookies, and a tree with gifts to open after they were done, in order for them to get in the Christmas spirit.|$|E

25|$|Critics of Schlafly saw her {{advocacy}} against {{equal rights}} and {{her role as}} a working professional as a contradiction. Gloria Steinem and author Pia de Solenni, among others, considered it <b>ironic</b> <b>that</b> in Schlafly's role as an advocate for the full-time mother and wife, she herself was a lawyer, newsletter editor, touring speaker, and political activist.|$|E
25|$|It is also <b>ironic</b> <b>that</b> {{the very}} wall that Cal built to {{effectively}} imprison {{the population of}} Mega City One helped in the city's defence {{on a number of}} occasions, including attacks from Sabbat's zombies. However its most prominent role was when the wall's weaponry functioned as an anti-missile defence system against Sov-block missiles during the Apocalypse War.|$|E
25|$|De la Gardie {{had been}} partly {{responsible}} for the treaty with France and had worked hard to increase the young King Charles's power. It might seem <b>ironic</b> <b>that</b> the treaty helped moving Sweden into a deep crisis financially, which, together with the level of power Charles had attained, in turn led to the reduction. Thus, De la Gardie contributions came to be a large factor behind his own fall from power and richness.|$|E
50|$|The {{complaint}} is <b>ironic,</b> given <b>that</b> solar cells were invented {{less than a}} decade later, and their first use was for spacecraft. They remain a common fixture of practically every spacecraft to this day.|$|R
25|$|After Novakâ€™s death, David Frum {{commented that}} the whole episode had been <b>ironic</b> given <b>that</b> Richard Armitage, Joe Wilson, Valerie Plame, and Novak all had exactly the same {{opinions}} against a potential war in Iraq.|$|R

25|$|As the 20th century progressed, {{trade on}} the Newcastle and Gateshead quaysides {{gradually}} declined, until by the eighties {{both sides of the}} river were looking rather derelict. Shipping company offices had closed along with offices of firms related to shipping. There were also derelict warehouses lining the riverbank. A decision was taken by local government to re-develop the Newcastle quayside and this was begun in the 1990s following a master plan. New offices, restaurants, bars and residential accommodation were built and the area has changed {{in the space of a}} few years into a vibrant area. It is <b>ironic</b> <b>that</b> this development has partially returned the focus of Newcastle to the riverside, where it was in medieval times.|$|E
25|$|Egypt and Syria {{launched}} the Yom Kippur War against Israel in the Sinai {{and in the}} Golan Heights on 6October 1973 without Hussein's knowledge. Between 10September and 6October, Hussein secretly met with Israeli prime minister Golda Meir in Tel Aviv on 25September. Israeli leaks of the meeting led to rumors in the Arab World that Hussein had tipped off Meir about Arab intentions. Hussein only discussed with Meir what both already knew, that the Syrian army was on alert. On 13October Jordan joined the war and sent the 40thbrigade to assist the Syrians in the Golan Heights. Some see it as <b>ironic</b> <b>that</b> {{it was the same}} brigade that had been sent to deter the Syrian invasion during Black September in 1970. Subsequent peace talks with Israel collapsed; while Jordan wanted a complete Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank, Israel preferred to retain control but with Jordanian administration.|$|E
25|$|While Lina is {{believed}} to have been marked for death upon arrival (and immediately after sent to the gas chamber), her brother survived the camp conditions for a few more months. He befriended two Jewish doctors, Moscovici and Klein, with whom he spent his free moments engaged in passionate discussions about philosophy and literature. As was later attested by a survivor of the camp, the poet himself was among the 700 inmates selected for extermination on October 2, 1944, when the Birkenau subsection outside Brzezinka was being evicted by SS guards. He was aware of impending death, and reportedly saw it as <b>ironic</b> <b>that</b> it came so near to an expected Allied victory. After a short interval in Block 10, where he is said to have awaited his death with dignity and courage, he was driven to the gas chamber and murdered. His body was cremated, along with those of the other victims.|$|E
50|$|Arnold's {{decision}} to imitate a Latin pastoral is <b>ironic</b> in <b>that</b> Clough {{was best known}} for The Bothie of Tober-na-Vuolich, subtitled 'a long-vacation pastoral': a thoroughly modern poem which broke all the rules of classical pastoral poetry.|$|R

25|$|Cavalry {{were rarely}} {{used by the}} Assyrians or many other Mesopotamians until the 9th century BC, when their use is {{mentioned}} {{during the reign of}} Tukulti-Ninurta II. Before then, many nomads or steppe warriors relied on cavalry, who raided Assyrian lands. The Assyrians had to counter this mobile form of warfare and so beat their opponents, notably the Iranians, at their own game. Perhaps the greatest outside influence is that of the Iranian Medes. It is <b>ironic</b> <b>that</b> the raiding by that people assisted Assyrian attempts in building a cavalry army with which to destroy the Kingdom of Elam. However, Assyrian attempts were not without difficulties; horse archers were used but could not use their bows and the reins of their horses at the same time. As a result, cavalry under Ashurnasirpal are depicted in pairs, with one rider holding both reins and the other shooting with a bow. The Assyrians experienced fewer problems with cavalry when they were deployed as lancers; under Tiglath Pileser III, the Assyrian Cavalry continued to be paired of but this time each warrior held his own lance and controlled his own horse. By the 7th century BC, mounted Assyrian warriors were well armed with a bow and a lance, and armored with lamellar armour, while their mounts were equipped with fabric armour, providing limited yet useful protection in close combat and against missiles. Cavalry were to form the core of the later Assyrian armies.|$|E
25|$|The first Pro Spectacular was {{launched}} in Reno, Nevada on January 4, 1985. While a critical success, the racing was exciting with the ABA put on its usual show of efficiency and the pros generally liked the concept (although the track itself was too tight and ungroomed for their taste) and more than enough pros participated to make it interesting (the ABA dropped its vaunted Direct Transfer System and ran the qualifying motos three times just like the National Bicycle League). In an effort to enhance the awards, $10,000 purses for each race was offered. The winner of the Pro Spectacular series would win a Pontiac Trans Am, just like {{the winner of the}} ABA No. 1 pro plate for the year. The spectator attendance, which was the key, were lackluster. Despite the relatively low admission fee at $5.00, which was about the same as the racer's sign up fee at a local race and the heavy promotion the venues were, if not empty was well below seating capacity. At the first event held at the Lawlor Events Center of the University of Nevada in Reno, Nevada, only about 2,000 spectators were on hand in a facility that could seat 10,000. Many in the crowd were probably there for the standard National that was to be held the next day (those who signed up to race in the National the next day got a discount on the spectator's fee in the Pro Spectacular). Perhaps it was a losing situation from the start. Not enough people knew about the existence of BMX to care and bicycle racing of any type hasn't been big in the United States since the 1920s indoor track racing fad. In Europe by comparison capacity crowds fill venues and racers are front page news in Europe, even previously unknown BMX racers. The same was true for South America. As a comparison the 1983 International Bicycle Motocross Federation (IBMXF) sanctioned World Championship held in Slagharen, the Netherlands drew an incredible (by US standards) 15 to 20,000 paying spectators and was televised live in Europe. In the US you would be lucky to get a mention in sports section of an American newspaper for any form of cycling outside of yearly reporting of the Tour de France, never mind a BMX race. It seems <b>ironic</b> <b>that</b> BMX was invented in the United States in light of the lackluster attitude of the public at large toward cycling. However, {{when you look at the}} fact that BMX wasn't so much derived from cycling but from kids imitating motocross racing then it is much more understandable why BMX was invented here. Still, it was cycling even if it was aping Motocross. In that light, despite the expensive 68 30 second TV advertisements shown on then popular programs like Magnum, P.I., Dynasty and Good Morning America, it was a steep uphill battle to win over the public. The light attendance most likely did not justify the reputed $4000 in television advertising the ABA invested. The most successful of the Spectaculars in terms of non racer attendance was the fifth round held in Phoenix, Arizona on February 8. Albeit a far cry from the 15 to 20,000 that came to see the IBMXF World Championship in the Netherlands, it did draw 2,600 paying spectators despite Phoenix's first snow fall in seven years. However, considering the cost of renting the arena with the deliberate lack of amateur involvement and hence their entrance fees it was a financial burden the ABA could ill afford. By the time of Land of Lincoln Pro Spectacular on April 28, the last in the series, they had dropped the TV advertisement campaign, as a result only a few dozen of spectators were on hand for the event at the Coliseum State Fair Grounds in Springfield, Illinois. To help defray the cost, the ABA started to run a few selected Amateur open classes to collect entry fees to offset at least partially the losses.|$|E
500|$|In May 1993, Laura {{traveled}} to Attu and {{spoke at a}} 50th anniversary commemorative event of the Battle of Attu.

5000|$|The [...] "first single, 'For America,' is {{indicative}} of the collection's tone - staunchly anti-war and embittered by the sense of <b>ironic</b> betrayal <b>that</b> characterized political songwriting during the Nixon years," [...] noted Billboard magazine upon the song's release.|$|R
5000|$|The {{seemingly}} <b>ironic</b> fact <b>that</b> a Jewish association advocated {{loyalty to}} the Nazi programme {{gave rise to a}} contemporary joke about Naumann and his followers ending their meeting by giving the Nazi salute and shouting [...] "Down With Us!".|$|R
500|$|It is <b>ironic</b> <b>that</b> Rifenburg {{was born}} in Petoskey, Michigan in 1926 for several reasons. [...] Ted Petoskey preceded Rifenburg as an All-American end on the University of Michigan {{football}} team. Petoskey had excelled {{as a representative of}} Saginaw County in MHSAA competition. Petoskey posted significant football accomplishments in 1926 making 1926 a significant year for himself as well. Achieving All-American status as an end at Michigan would be Rifenburg's next step after excelling in MHSAA competition.|$|E
500|$|Another {{approach}} to critique {{taken in the}} classroom has been to propose the insignificance of female characters in the story as sexist. While Bilbo {{may be seen as}} a literary symbol of small folk of any gender, a gender-conscious approach can help students establish notions of a [...] "socially symbolic text" [...] where meaning is generated by tendentious readings of a given work. By this interpretation, it is <b>ironic</b> <b>that</b> the first authorized adaptation was a stage production in a girls' school.|$|E
500|$|... "Everybody" [...] was commercially {{released}} as Madonna's first single in October 6, 1982, and {{came with a}} Lou Beach-designed sleeve depicting a hip hopâ€“style NYC street scene. Because of the ambiguous nature of the record sleeve and the R groove of the song, Madonna was widely {{believed to be a}} black artist when the single was released. According to Matthew Lindsay of The Quietus, it was <b>ironic</b> <b>that</b> the record sleeve did not depict Madonna on the cover, as she would become [...] "the face of the 80s." ...|$|E
50|$|This example {{comes from}} {{discourse}} between {{a father and}} daughter about her refusal to attend school. It {{can be interpreted as}} a genuine statement (perhaps one can learn by resisting school) or as an <b>ironic</b> statement (<b>that</b> is an absurd idea).|$|R
5000|$|Players {{lettering}} before 1960 {{could have}} been selected for either offensive or defensive positions.

500|$|Valve {{explained}} that the focus of Episode One was character development, in particular that of Gordon's companion Alyx, because she accompanies the player for almost the entire game. Project lead Robin Walker discussed the reasoning behind this approach in an article announcing {{the game in the}} May 2005 issue of PC Gamer UK, saying, [...] "It's kind of <b>ironic</b> <b>that</b> despite so much of the theme of Half-Life 2 being about other characters and other people, you spent most of the game alone."

500|$|McGovern {{supported}} {{economic stimulus}} efforts during the late-2000s recession, including the Economic Stimulus Act in February 2008 and the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act (which established the Troubled Asset Relief Program) in October 2008. He supported the Obama administration's 2009 stimulus package. Responding to Republican criticism of Democratic budgetary priorities, he chided the GOP for {{running up the}} national debt under George W.
