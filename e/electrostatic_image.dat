The nanoring is modeled as a perfectly conducting isolated torus whose <b>electrostatic</b> <b>image</b> potential is derived analytically. The image states are computed via a two-dimensional finite-difference scheme as solutions of the effective Schrödinger equation describing the outer electron subject to this image potential.

At room temperature divalent as well as monovalent counterions mediate an interaction that can be repulsive or attractive upon adjusting either the macroion charge densities or the rod radius.

We determine a full epitaxial strain-temperature phase diagram in the presence of perfect electrodes. Even with the vanishing depolarization field, we find that ferroelectric phase transitions to states with in-plane and out-of-plane components of polarization exhibit dependence on thickness; it arises from the interactions of local dipoles with their <b>electrostatic</b> <b>images</b> in the presence of electrodes. Secondly, in the presence of relatively bad metal electrodes which only partly compensate the surface charges and depolarization field, a qualitatively different phase with stripe-like domains is stabilized at low temperature...|$|R
40|$|Carrier {{dynamics}} in metal-semiconductor structures {{is driven by}} electrodynamic coupling of carriers to the evanescent field of surface plasmons. Useful modifications in electron and hole dynamics due to presence of metallic inclusions show promise for applications from light emitters to communications. However, this picture does not include contributions from electrostatics. We propose here an electrostatic mechanism for enhancement of light radiated from semiconductor emitter which is comparable in effect to plasmonic mechanism Arising from Coulomb attraction of e-h pairs to their <b>electrostatic</b> <b>images</b> in metallic nanoparticles, this mechanism produces large carrier concentrations near the nanoparticle. A strong inhomogeneity in the carrier distribution {{and an increase in}} the internal quantum efficiency are predicted. In our experiments, this manifests as emission enhancement in InGaN quantum well (QW) radiating in the near-UV region.

We start with a short review which summarizes the results obtained by using quantum and classical descriptions of media, in both non-retarded and retarded regimes of particle interactions. The classical static result for the flat interface is rederived by using a combination of the microscopic linear response theory and the macroscopic method of <b>electrostatic</b> <b>image</b> charges.

40|$|The remarkably low {{experimental}} {{values of}} the capacitance data of carbon based materials in contact with water solvent needs to be explained from a microscopic theory in order to optimize the efficiency of these materials. We show that this experimental result {{can be explained by}} the dielectric screening deficiency of the electrostatic potential, which in turn results from the interfacial solvent depletion effect driven by image dipole interactions. We show this by deriving from the microscopic system Hamiltonian a non-mean-field dipolar Poisson-Boltzmann equation. This can account for the interaction of solvent molecules with their <b>electrostatic</b> <b>image</b> resulting from the dielectric discontinuity between the solvent medium and the substrate. The predictions of the extended dipolar Poisson-Boltzmann equation for the differential capacitance are compared with experimental data and good agreement is found without any fitting parameters...|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} {{ground-state}} structures of identical classical point charges with Coulomb interactions, confined between two symmetric parallel charged walls. For the well understood homogeneous dielectric case with no <b>electrostatic</b> <b>images,</b> the charges evenly condense {{on the opposite}} walls, thereby forming a bilayer Wigner crystal; five structures compete upon changing the inter-wall separation. Here, we consider a dielectric jump between the walls and a solvent in which charges are immersed, implying repulsive images. Using recently developed series representations of lattice sums for Coulomb law, we derive the complete phase diagram. In contrast to the homogeneous dielectric case, the particles remain in a hexagonal Wigner monolayer {{up to a certain}} distance between the walls. Beyond this distance, a bifurcation occurs to a sequence of Wigner bilayers, each layer having a nonzero spacing from the nearest wall.

Deflection plates and drive electronics move the frames to different locations on the framing tube output. A single charge-coupled device (CCD) camera then records the phosphor image of all nine frames. This paper discusses setup techniques to optimize system performance.

The dielectric constant between the surfaces {{is assumed to be}} different from the dielectric constant of the two semiinfinite regions bounded by the surfaces, giving rise to <b>electrostatic</b> <b>image</b> interactions. We show that on the weak coupling level the image charge effects are generally small, making their mark only in the second order fluctuation term. However, in the strong coupling limit, the image effects are large and fundamental. They modify the interactions between the two surfaces in an essential way. Our calculations are particularly useful in the regime of parameters where computer simulations would be difficult and extremely time consuming due to the complicated nature of the long range image potentials.

Mesoscopic structure of charged ultra-fine particles has been discussed with long-distance interaction. The dynamic behavior of the ultra-fine {{aerosol particles}} have been also investigated numerically and experimentally in relation to two-dimensional visualization of the particle trajectories. The numerical results of the particle trajectories showed that the effect of bipolar charges rather than non-charge was sufficiently affected on the dynamics behavior of particles, in which the mesoscopic spatio-temporal structure was appeared with the electrostatic charges on the surface of aerosol particles. Furthermore, this spatio-temporal structure was recognized sufficiently as two-dimensional image of particles, showing deference in the distribution of dimensionless distance of the nearest neighbors.

40|$|Navigation, localization, and {{targeting}} while completely {{submerged in}} the ocean are all extremely difficult {{due to the lack}} of a proficient sensor. The highly conductive nature of salt-water results in severe radio-wave attenuation precluding the use of RADAR. Naturally occurring noise sources, high energy costs, long-wavelengths, and surface turbidity restrict the use of SONAR imaging to low resolutions, depths, and far fields. The ocean's dark, turbulent, and silty disposition impedes optical imaging. Nature knows another better way. Apteronotus Albifrons is a nocturnal oceanic fish that cannot rely upon optical notions of vision to navigate, hunt, or avoid predators. Instead, it relies upon an electroreceptive capability achieved through a dense grid of electric field (Voltage) sensors arrayed along both sides of the body and concentrated around the head. It emits an electric field into the water and senses the self-induced forces down its sides. Objects in the vicinity that differ in conductivity from the background ocean environment disturb the field, redistribute the current, and hence the spatial distribution of voltages measured by the fish. This dissertation chronicles the effort to produce an engineered sensor which mirrors the biological phenomenon of electroreception and demonstrate its ability to "visualize" targets with different conductivities from the background ocean environment at very high resolution by detecting perturbations in a quasi-static electric field (electrostatics).

The total charge of the surface image is zero and its centroid is at the origin of the prolate spheroid. In addition, if the source is on the focal axis outside the prolate spheroid, then the image system of the exterior Green’s function consists of a point image on the focal axis and a line image on the line segment between the two focal points...|$|E
