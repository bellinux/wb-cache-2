5|$|Starting in August 1941, when {{it became}} clear to some in the Propaganda Ministry and the Wehrmacht high command that the war would likely extend into 1942, Goebbels grew {{increasingly}} concerned about the triumphant tone of the communiques. However, a string of spectacular victories in September, especially in the Battle of Kiev, removed any restraint from the texts, making propagandists's work more difficult later on, when they had to explain the Wehrmacht's <b>failures</b> <b>to</b> the German public which was rapidly losing confidence in a swift victory.|$|E

5|$|The attacks caught UN {{planners}} and troops by surprise. By August 26, the UN troops {{believed they had}} destroyed the last serious threats to the perimeter, and anticipated the war ending by late November. ROK units, in the meantime, suffered from low morale thanks to their <b>failures</b> <b>to</b> defend effectively thus far in the conflict.

5|$|Almost {{as soon as}} the war began, {{submarine}} captains indicated {{there were}} problems with the Mark 14 torpedo and the influence feature of the Mark 6 exploder. Torpedoes would fail to explode, or explode prematurely. Despite these reports, Christie was not fully aware {{of the impact of the}} situation, because his S-boats used the older Mark 10 torpedo, with a contact-only pistol. Christie acknowledged Mark 14s were running deeper than set, but attributed the <b>failures</b> <b>to</b> poor maintenance and errors on the part of the captain and crew. He was convinced the Mark 6 was satisfactory, and ordered all fleet boats to continue to use it. In November 1942, Christie was ordered to return to Newport as Inspector of Ordnance at the Torpedo Station. Newport had become a bottleneck for torpedo manufacture, and the Bureau of Ordnance wanted to advance development of the Mark 18 electric torpedo. Christie resisted leaving his command at Brisbane, but was considered of more use to resolve the torpedo issue. He was replaced by Captain James Fife. For his service at Brisbane, Christie was awarded the Legion of Merit.|$|E
5|$|As {{the senior}} member of the Hamdanid dynasty, he {{inherited}} the family power base around Mosul from his father, and was able to secure it against challenges by his uncles. Hasan became involved in the court intrigues of the Abbasid Caliphate in Baghdad, and, between 942 and 943, he, with the assistance of his brother Ali (known as Sayf al-Dawla), established himself as amir al-umara, or de facto regent for the Abbasid caliph. He was driven back to Mosul by Turkish troops, however, and subsequent attempts to challenge the Buyids who seized control of Baghdad and lower Iraq ended in repeated failure. Twice, his capital Mosul was captured by Buyid forces, which were, however, unable to defeat local opposition to their rule. As a result of his <b>failures</b> <b>to</b> retain power, Nasir al-Dawla declined in influence and prestige. He was eclipsed by the actions of his brother Ali, who established his rule more firmly over Aleppo and northern Syria. After 964, Nasir al-Dawla's eldest son Abu Taghlib exercised de facto rule over his domains, and in 967, Abu Taghlib and his brothers deposed and imprisoned their father, who died in captivity a year or two later.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} the 1860s, Levski {{developed}} a revolutionary theory that saw the Bulgarian liberation movement as an armed uprising of all Bulgarians in the Ottoman Empire. The insurrection was to be prepared, controlled and coordinated internally by a central revolutionary organisation, which was to include local revolutionary committees in all parts of Bulgaria and operate independently from any foreign factors. Levski's theory resulted from the repeated <b>failures</b> <b>to</b> implement Rakovski's ideas effectively, {{such as the use of}} foreign-based armed detachments (чети, cheti) to provoke a general revolt. Levski's idea of an entirely independent revolution did not enjoy the approval of the entire population either—in fact, he was the only prominent Bulgarian revolutionary to advocate it. Instead, many regarded an intervention by the great powers as a more feasible solution.|$|E
5|$|Over time, Vrataski trains Cage {{to excel}} in combat training. Frustrated by his {{continued}} <b>failures</b> <b>to</b> excel, he retreats to London to spare his own life, but discovers that the Mimics will attack there after defeating the UDF in France. Eventually receiving {{a vision of a}} dam in Germany, indicating that the Omega is hiding there, Cage and Vrataski spend many loops figuring out how to escape the invasion and reach the dam. Cage comes to know Vrataski and falls in love with her, but Vrataski, who lost a loved one to the Mimics, is only interested in the mission. Upon reaching a point where she is killed whatever they do, Cage decides to fly to the dam on his own. Inside the dam, he is ambushed by an Alpha and Mimic struggling to bleed him out and strip off his ability to reset time. Before they can slowly bleed him to death, Cage deliberately drowns himself to avoid the process.|$|E

Coulter to the P'ohang-dong area to shore up the ROK I Corps, which was falling apart due to low morale. UN troops were preparing for Operation Chromite, an amphibious assault on the port of Inchon on September 15, and did not anticipate that the North Koreans would mount a serious offensive before then.|$|E

5|$|Under his uncle's guidance, O'Neill {{joined the}} St George Cricket Club, in the Sydney Grade competition. He {{steadily}} moved {{up through the}} grades and broke into the first grade side {{at the age of}} 16. Sensing his potential, the club's selectors informed him that regardless of form, he would play the full season, which allowed him to be uninhibited in his batting. He made 108 in seven innings. The next season, he was out 12 times leg before wicket in 15 innings, and run out in the other three. O'Neill attributed his <b>failures</b> <b>to</b> over-aggressiveness and resolved to improve his patience. In the second match of the new season, the 17-year-old O'Neill made his first century. With all five state selectors onlooking, he made 28 in the next match and was called into the state squad.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after takeoff}} at 16.27 BST (15.27 GMT) on 8 April 1968, {{according}} to the investigations of Rolls-Royce, the 5th stage low-pressure compressor wheel failed in fatigue at the run out radius of the wheel web with the rim, causing secondary <b>failures</b> <b>to</b> other wheels {{and other parts of}} the engine. The wheel then burst through its casing and disconnected the main fuel pipe, igniting the fuel which was being pumped at 50 gallons (approx. 150kg) per minute. The fire could not be put out because the engine's two extinguishers had become ineffectual following the destruction caused to the engine cowling by the broken compressor casing. The ferocity of the blaze soon after caused the engine pylon to fatally weaken, which when it gave way, led to the engine falling off of the wing. However, the fuel booster pump continued to function, intensifying the fire until it spread to the wing itself, sweeping back from forward of the leading edge towards the tail. Upon landing, the application of reverse thrust and the westerly crosswind on runway 05R blew the flames underneath the wing and set light to the fuselage. The rapidly intensifying fire then spread under the plane and ignited the fuel lines and oxygen tanks, which, within seconds of the aircraft coming to a stop, caused a series of explosions that broke through the fuselage and set fire to the cabin, ultimately resulting in the deaths of five people.|$|E
5|$|The Bank offers {{flexible}} loans with maturities {{as long as}} 30 {{years and}} custom-tailored repayment scheduling. The IBRD also offers loans in local currencies. Through a joint effort between the IBRD and the International Finance Corporation, the Bank offers financing to subnational entities either with or without sovereign guarantees. For borrowers needing quick financing for an unexpected change, the IBRD operates a Deferred Drawdown Option {{which serves as a}} line of credit with features similar to the Bank's flexible loan program. Among the World Bank Group's credit enhancement and guarantee products, the IBRD offers policy-based guarantees to cover countries' sovereign default risk, partial credit guarantees to cover the credit risk of a sovereign government or subnational entity, and partial risk guarantees to private projects to cover a government's failure to meet its contractual obligations. The IBRD's Enclave Partial Risk Guarantee to cover private projects in member countries of the IDA against sovereign governments' <b>failures</b> <b>to</b> fulfill contractual obligations. The Bank provides an array of financial risk management products including foreign exchange swaps, currency conversions, interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and floors, and commodity swaps. To help borrowers protect against catastrophes and other special risks, the bank offers a Catastrophe Deferred Drawdown Option to provide financing after a natural disaster or declared state of emergency. It also issues catastrophe bonds which transfer catastrophic risks from borrowers to investors. The IBRD reported $26.7 billion in lending commitments for 132 projects in fiscal year 2011, significantly less than its $44.2 billion in commitments during fiscal year 2010.|$|E
