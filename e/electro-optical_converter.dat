40|$|Abstract—Silicon {{photonics}} {{is rapidly}} growing {{and a number}} of Si-based active and passive components have recently been demonstrated. We demonstrate new functionality of Er-doped silicon: a memory effect in electroluminescence. This finding opens a prospect of necessary, and thus far not available, component for Si optoelectronics—a fully complimentary metal–oxide– semiconductor-compatible <b>electro-optical</b> <b>converter</b> with a memory function, operating in the technologically important 1. 5 -µm band. When developed and optimized, prospect applications could include optical intra- and inter-chip connectors and volatile flash memory elements.

50|$|Firing station {{comprises}} {{a high-performance}} compact computer for missile guidance, an operator control panel and a high-resolution display. The system uses advanced control and image processing algorithms, <b>electro-optical</b> <b>converters</b> and radio links. The firing station has an optional GPS and north-seeking device. The firing station {{is used for}} mission planning before the engagement. The firing station stores a digitized map and displays the map during missile flight. For some applications, a dual monitor system used. The firing unit {{can be used as}} a trainer and simulator without additional hardware.|$|R
40|$|The phase 1 upgrade of the ATLAS [1] pixel {{detector}} {{will be done}} {{by inserting}} a fourth pixel layer together with a new beampipe into the recent three layer detector. This new detector, the Insertable B-Layer (IBL) should {{be integrated into the}} recent pixel system with as few changes in services as possible, but deliver some advantages over the recent system. One of those advantages will be a new data transmission link from the detector modules to the off-detector electronics, requiring a re-design of the <b>electro-optical</b> <b>converters</b> on the off-detector side. First ideas of how to implement those, together with some ideas to reduce cost by increasing the systems throughput are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{crosstalk}} or switching {{contrast of}} the digital optical switch (DOS) is analysed and a new architecture to enhance the contrast from - 20 dB to - 40 dB is proposed. An <b>electro-optical</b> mode <b>converter</b> is used for compensation of the undesired mode. Some theoretical results on vertical DOS are discussed...|$|R
