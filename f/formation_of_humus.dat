30|$|The {{solubility}} of {{the nutrients}} and heavy metals {{depends on the}} solubility equilibria for which the initial concentration of the ions, pH, complex formations, etc, are important (Larson et al. 1973; Benefield et al. 1982; Wang et al. 2009). The pH of the S. natans composts was in the range where the alkali or alkaline earth metals (i.e., Na+, K+, Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +, etc) were soluble. The possible reason for the decrease in water-soluble trace metals was the formation of complexes with the heavy metal ions. Composting results in humification of the organic matter with the <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> <b>humus</b> substances rich in humic acid-like organic carbons having increased aromatic characteristics; oxygen and nitrogen concentrations; functional groups; etc., depending on the nature and composition of the initial organic matter. The humic substances are low in fulvic acid-like organic carbon and water-extractable organic carbon (Roletto et al. 1985; Senesi 1989). Structurally, humic substances are 20 – 30  % aliphatic and 20 – 40  % aromatic. 20  % of hydrogen is bound to oxygen as carboxyl (–COOH) and phenolic hydroxyl (–OH) groups and the rest bound directly to carbon (Young 2010). The interaction of macronutrients (i.e., alkali or alkaline earth metals) and heavy metals with the humic substances is a complex phenomenon with differing views. The alkali or alkaline earth metals are held weakly by exchangeable hydrated ions, or by electrostatic forces by charged humus carboxyl groups. In case of heavy metals, a metal chelate complex is formed and two or more coordinate positions of the metal ion are occupied by donor groups of a single ligand to form an internal ring structure (Stevenson 1994; Tan 2010). The divalent and trivalent metals formed highly insoluble complexes, i.e., multidentate or multinuclear chelate sites with the functional groups of humus and are dominated by double or triple bonds to the mix of carboxyl and phenolic hydroxyl groups (Young 2010). Cations with two positive charges such as Cu 2 + can only be replaced by another transitional metal ion that has two positive charges. Chelation of toxic heavy metals such as mercury (Hg), lead (Pb) and cadmium (Cd) also forms organo-metal complexes which are less available for plant uptake. The stability of a metal chelate complex is determined by such factors {{as the number of}} atoms that form a bond with the metal ion, the number of rings that are formed, the nature and concentrations of the metal ions, and pH. The order of decreasing ability of metal ions to form chelating complexes with humic acids is Fe 3 + > Cu 2 + > Ni 2 + > Co 2 + > Zn 2 + > Fe 2 + > Mn 2 + (Stevenson 1994). Whereas, Tipping and Hurley (1992) evaluated the binding strength of the metals with humus in the increasing order VO 2 + > Cu 2 + > Pb 2 + > Zn 2 + = Ni 2 + > Co 2 + > Cd 2 + > Mn 2 + > Ca 2 +> Mg 2 +.|$|E
40|$|Termites of many {{different}} kinds are found throughout the tropics. Little is known about their impact on agriculture, even though {{there have been many}} studies of the social organization of termites within their colonies. What influence do termites have on soil fertility, for example, and what is the extent of the damage they cause to crops? The answers to these questions are to be found by observing farmers' practices in the field. Harmful or beneficial, the results are many and varied. Dr Yao Tano, a scientist at the Laboratory of Animal Biology at the University of Abidjan, concedes that 'people who study termites {{are more likely to be}} interested in their advantages than their disadvantages. ' However, despite this natural tendency, he has established subtle differences between the three principal categories of termites, distinguished by their feeding regime and the easily-recognizable shape of their mounds. The fungus termites, of which Macrotermes are the most widespread, are the most damaging. Their 'cathedral' mounds are the highest, reaching 6 m or more in height, whereas the mushroom-shaped mounds built by decomposers (Cubitermes) or the dome-shaped mounds of the forager termites (Trinervitermes), are usually less than a metre in height. The fungus termites derive their name from the symbiotic fungal growth which they maintain as a food source on macerated wood within the mound. But these termites also eat maize, groundnuts, yam and other crops. Decomposers eat decaying vegetable matter and therefore have a direct influence on the <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> <b>humus</b> as do the foragers, although to a lesser extent. The latter are more interested in wild grasses and, incidentally, in the leafy matter of cultivated crops. A greater proportion of total crop losses attributable to all types of termites is thought to be the result of attack in the field rather than from damage in grain stores. Actual percentages vary greatly from one region to another and, for the most part, have yet to be established. However, 'it is reasonable to estimate that losses in the field, particularly of maize crops, may exceed 15 % in some savanna zones. ' For some monocropping systems, such as rice cultivation, the losses are such that small-scale farmers are discouraged from attempting them. And when fungus termites invade a field of groundnuts (one of the crops most vulnerable to termites) the potential yield may be lowered by 20 % or more. Even though their damage is significant, it is much less than that caused by some other insects, for example, stem borers. ' Farmers, who are not always aware of the difference, often attribute damage to termites which is actually caused by stemborers. Although for the most part losses in production are due to termite attack on the crop itself, the fungus termite creates an added problem with its huge mounds. The base of these may reduce available soil surface by as much as 10 % or more and thus restrict land available for cultivation. Recycled termite mounds As for the beneficial effect of termites on soil fertility, in particular the fertility value of some termite mounds, 'little is known other than that which farmers have known for a long time. ' says Yao Tano. He is currently conducting trials in the Touba region in the north of Cote d'lvoire to quantify the effect on soil fertility. Solve authors mention that farmers in East Africa, notably Tanzania, use the mushroom mounds of decomposer termites as fertilizer. These small termite mounds can, up to a point, improve soil fertility in, for example, a home garden or, on a small scale, along ridges or mounds. In practice, the presence of such termites indicates to farmers that the soil is good and worth cultivating. The base material from which the huge, cathedral-like termite mounds are constructed is poor in both mineral and organic content They are made from fine particles of clay which the termites bring to the surface from Macrotermes cathedral mounds can reach a height of 6 m or more. The termites construct these mounds by baring deep into the earth sometimes to a depth of 20 m The light clay that constitutes the visible part of the mounds is very poor in both mineral and organic content and d is therefore of little agricultural value as much as 20 metres below ground. If the mounds are broken up, or eroded, they deposit a large quantity of fine, clay particles on the surrounding soil surface thereby reducing aeration and water infiltration. It is not surprising, therefore, that farmers look upon Macrotermes as a curse and try to get rid of the pest by destroying the queen. In general, if the queen is killed, so too is the rest of the colony. Farmers may also use chemical insecticides, 'but the insecticides are not selective and they kill not only termites but also beneficial worms. An effective means of getting rid of Macrotermes would be very greatly appreciated by farmers' says Yao Tano. Ants could one day provide a solution to the problem of damage caused by Macrotermes. Ants are termites' natural and most formidable enemies and a team of French scientists has identified 'a species of ant which emits a toxic substance capable of killing an entire termite colony. ' Even if the colony is destroyed, the problem of the 'cathedral' mound remains. The solution could be to use the clay of which the mounds are constructed to make bricks. This is being practiced on a large scale in the north of Zambia and the south-east of Zaire. It may be recalled that in 1985 a team of scientists from the Department of Geography at the University of Lubumbashi in Zaire and at the Laboratory of Ecology at the Faculty of Agronomic Sciencies at Gemboux, Belgium, initiated the construction of several large cities (Lubumbashi, Likasi, Kolwezi and Ndola, which now have between 125, 000 and 700, 000 inhabitants) from material taken from the termite mounds in the area.

The work was part of a study of the mechanism of transformation of organic matter into soil humus. The information obtained is of importance in the Netherlands for two main reasons: 1. As a result ofthe rapidly increasing population, and the shift ofthe rural population to urban areas, valuable horticultural land, surrounding towns and cities, is constantly lost. Horticultural crops require soil with a good humus status. As this becomes unavailable, it must be created by proper soil supplementation and management.

As a result of the intensive use of soil for more profitable agricultural pursuits, only the poorer soils are available for forestry. This, combined with the long rotation period required in forestry, has decreased revenues, and it is clear that costs must be kept at a minimum. Fertilizers become uneconomical even on these poor soils. Consequently, more efficient use of the minerals present in the soil is a necessity.
