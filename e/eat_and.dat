5|$|Freyja {{receives}} the slain {{heroes of the}} battlefield quite respectfully as Óðinn does. Her house is called Sessrumnir, 'filled with many seats', and it probably fills the same function as Valhöll, 'the hall of the slain', where the warriors <b>eat</b> <b>and</b> drink beer after the fighting. Still, we must ask why there are two heroic paradises in the Old Norse View of afterlife. It might possibly be a consequence of different forms of initiation of warriors, where one part seemed to have belonged to Óðinn {{and the other to}} Freyja. These examples indicate that Freyja was a war-goddess, and she even appears as a valkyrie, literally 'the one who chooses the slain'.|$|E
5|$|In the 18th century Royal Navy, {{rank and}} {{position}} on board ship {{was defined by}} a mix of two hierarchies, an official hierarchy of ranks and a conventionally recognized social divide between gentlemen and non-gentlemen. Boys aspiring for a commission were often called young gentlemen instead of their substantive rating to distinguish their higher social standing from the ordinary sailors. Generally, aboard most warships common seamen berthed in the fo'c'sle, while officers were quartered at the stern. Occasionally, a midshipman would be posted aboard a ship in a lower rating such as able seaman but would <b>eat</b> <b>and</b> sleep with his social equals in the cockpit.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} <b>eating</b> <b>and</b> rumination behaviour in 13 Scottish Highland cattle for 13 {{days on a}} winter pasture and then for 13 days in a loose housing barn during winter. The cows were fed hay ad libitum and each was fitted with a pressure-sensitive transducer integrated into the noseband of the halter. The endpoints for each cow at both locations were calculated per day <b>and</b> included <b>eating</b> <b>and</b> rumination times, number of chewing cycles related to <b>eating</b> <b>and</b> rumination, number of regurgitated cuds and number of chewing cycles per cud. Air temperature, wind speed, relative humidity, barometric pressure and precipitation were recorded. Pastured cows had significantly longer <b>eating</b> <b>and</b> rumination times, more chewing cycles related to <b>eating</b> <b>and</b> rumination, more regurgitated cuds and more chewing cycles per cud than housed cows. Meteorological conditions were very similar at both locations...|$|R
40|$|Trade-offs between {{current and}} future {{consequences}} are characteristic for the domain of health behavior. Therefore, both <b>eating</b> <b>and</b> exercising behavior could be determined by time orientation, which refers to an individual’s general orientation toward the present or the future. The main aim of this dissertation is to {{provide insight into the}} relations between time orientation <b>and</b> both <b>eating</b> <b>and</b> exercising behavior. The results of this dissertation confirm that time orientation is a shared determinant of <b>eating</b> <b>and</b> exercising behavior. Nevertheless, time orientation for food and for exercise are different constructs that, in turn, have differential relations with <b>eating</b> <b>and</b> exercising behavior. Specifically, eating behavior is mainly predicted by consideration of immediate consequences, whereas exercising behavior is mainly predicted by consideration of future consequences. In addition, these relations can be partly explained by construal level. Theoretically, the results of this dissertation contribute in various ways {{to a better understanding of}} the construct of time orientation and its relations with <b>eating</b> <b>and</b> exercising behavior. Methodologically, the results of this dissertation have several implications for the measurement of time orientation as well as the measurement of <b>eating</b> <b>and</b> exercising behavior. Practically, the results of this dissertation can be used in the development of campaigns to stimulate healthy <b>eating</b> <b>and</b> exercising behavior. Overall, the insights that have been gained in this dissertation contribute to a better understanding of individuals’ intertemporal decision making in the health domain and can ultimately be used in order to promote <b>and</b> stimulate healthy <b>eating</b> <b>and</b> exercising behavior...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} aims {{to expand on}} the {{existing}} literature by examining {{the relationship between the}} temperament components of novelty seeking and harm avoidance and the maladaptive behaviors of disordered <b>eating</b> <b>and</b> substance abuse. A sample of 202 female undergraduates completed self-report questionnaires measuring each of the variables of interest. Alike prior research, a significant correlation was found between disordered <b>eating</b> <b>and</b> substance abuse. Moreover, regression analysis revealed that disordered <b>eating</b> positively <b>and</b> significantly predicted substance use in college-aged women. It was also hypothesized that novelty seeking and harm avoidance would moderate this relationship between disordered <b>eating</b> <b>and</b> substance use. Although novelty seeking was significantly correlated with both disordered <b>eating</b> <b>and</b> substance abuse, it was not found to moderate {{the relationship between the two}} disorders. Moreover, harm avoidance was found to be significantly correlated only to disordered <b>eating</b> <b>and</b> not to substance abuse. Although these components were not found to moderate the relationship between disordered <b>eating</b> <b>and</b> substance abuse, the positive correlation between novelty seeking with these disorders suggests a relationship to be further investigated. In addition, the predictive value of disordered eating for the development of substance abuse within a college age, nonclinical sample is asserted. Implications of these findings can be utilized by mental health professionals as well as school and university administrators. ...|$|R
5|$|Lysosomes {{carry out}} {{intracellular}} digestion, {{in a process}} called phagocytosis (from the Greek phagein, to <b>eat</b> <b>and</b> kytos, vessel, referring here to the cell), by fusing with a vacuole and releasing their enzymes into the vacuole. Through this process, sugars, amino acids, and other monomers pass into the cytosol and become nutrients for the cell. Lysosomes also use their hydrolytic enzymes to recycle the cell's obsolete organelles in a process called autophagy. The lysosome engulfs another organelle and uses its enzymes to take apart the ingested material. The resulting organic monomers are {{then returned to the}} cytosol for reuse. The last function of a lysosome is to digest the cell itself through autolysis.|$|E

Antlers provide a means of defense, as does a strong front-leg kick, which is {{performed}} by either sex if provoked. Once the antlers have been shed, bulls tend to form bachelor groups which allow them to work cooperatively at fending off predators. Herds tend to employ one or more scouts while the remaining members <b>eat</b> <b>and</b> rest.|$|E

Problematic eating behaviors are defined as binge <b>eating</b> <b>and</b> emotional <b>eating,</b> <b>and</b> adaptive <b>eating</b> behaviors are defined as mindful <b>eating</b> <b>and</b> intuitive <b>eating,</b> <b>and</b> all variables were measured at multiple points: extended baseline, pre-test, post-test, 3 -, and 8 -month follow-up. By including assessment of outcome at multiple points, this study also investigated (i) measure’s test-retest reliability, (ii) if mindful eating mediated changes in the variables across time. A summary of key study variables and procedures is included below; please see Cancian et al. (2017) for further details.|$|R

5|$|Springbok are {{primarily}} browsers and may switch to grazing occasionally; they feed on shrubs and young succulents (such as Lampranthus species) before they lignify. They prefer grasses such as Themeda triandra. Springbok can meet their water needs {{from the food}} they <b>eat,</b> <b>and</b> are able to survive without drinking water through dry season. In extreme cases, they do not drink any water {{over the course of}} their lives. Springbok may accomplish this by selecting flowers, seeds, and leaves of shrubs before dawn, when the food items are most succulent. In places such as the Etosha National Park, springbok seek out water bodies where they are available. Springbok gather in the wet season and disperse during the dry season, unlike other African mammals.|$|E
