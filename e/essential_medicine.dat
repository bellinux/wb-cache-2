40|$|The {{concept of}} <b>essential</b> <b>medicines</b> was {{introduced}} in 1977 {{with the publication of}} the World Health Organization's (WHO) Model List of <b>Essential</b> <b>Medicines.</b> These medicines are intended to satisfy the priority health care needs of the population. They are selected with regard to public health relevance, evidence of efficacy and safety, and comparative cost-effectiveness. <b>Essential</b> <b>medicines</b> are intended to be available within the context of functioning health systems at all times in adequate amounts, in the appropriate dosage forms, with assured quality and at a price the individual and the community can afford. The WHO advises countries to adapt the <b>essential</b> <b>medicines</b> list according to their priority health care needs. The model list of WHO serves as a guide {{for the development of a}} national list of <b>essential</b> <b>medicines</b> (NLEM).

40|$|Concentration Paper Title: Policy and {{programming}} options {{for reducing the}} procurement costs of <b>essential</b> <b>medicines</b> in developing countries Abstract (150 - 300 words) : <b>Essential</b> <b>medicines</b> are central to a health system’s success and the care it provides its clients. An estimated {{one third of the}} world’s population lacks access to <b>essential</b> <b>medicines,</b> due in part to their cost. While poor infrastructure and distribution systems make delivery difficult, the cost of <b>essential</b> <b>medicines</b> remains the largest obstacle to access. This paper investigates hidden costs inherent in the procurement process that diminish purchasing power. Data collected and presented from ten countries illustrates that hidden costs can frequently more than double the price of <b>essential</b> <b>medicines</b> between manufacturer and patient. Faced with fixed budgets and limited financial resources available, countries must reduce costs in order to increase access to <b>essential</b> <b>medicines.</b> This paper identifies nine policy {{and programming}} options available to governments and pharmaceutical procurement offices to lower the costs of the <b>essential</b> <b>medicines</b> they procure. When available, these policies are supported by evidence from developing countries; when evidence is lacking, suggestions are made for studies. Specific actions for public health officials are also proposed. By reducing hidden costs, countries will increase purchasing power and provide more <b>essential</b> <b>medicines</b> to a greater portion of their population. Once implemented, these policies will also turn the spotlight on the next barrier to access: the manufacturer’s price.

40|$|Abstract Background In 2009, China {{implemented}} the national <b>essential</b> <b>medicines</b> system by enacting the National <b>Essential</b> <b>Medicines</b> List 2009. According {{to the policy}} of this system, primary health care institutions can only stock and use <b>essential</b> <b>medicines</b> on the prescribed List. Meanwhile, each province can choose to make its own list of supplemented medicines. The goal {{of the study is}} to provide suggestions for emerging problems and identify future policy-making trends. Methods In this study, we statistically analyzed the National <b>Essential</b> <b>Medicines</b> List 2009 and lists of supplemented medicines of all 29 provinces. We also examined the rationality of such medicines based on the DELPHI method and literature review, after which we studied the provincial supplements in relation to the national <b>essential</b> <b>medicines</b> system. Results We demonstrated that the National <b>Essential</b> <b>Medicines</b> List 2009 provides a comprehensive coverage of diseases as well as reasonable varieties of drugs for their treatment. The average number of supplemented medicines in 29 provinces is 207, with each medicine included in 2. 9 provincial lists on average. Only 2. 6 % supplemented medicines are included by {{more than half of the}} provinces (> 15), indicating great regional variance. Among the 32 most frequently supplemented medicines, only 18 meet the selection principles, including two with strict usage restrictions. Conclusion The structure and selection of the National <b>Essential</b> <b>Medicines</b> List 2009 are relatively reasonable. The main problems, however, include the excessive and non-scientific selection of medicines on the supplemented medicines list. The function of the provincial lists of supplemented medicines has not been achieved, which has influenced the effectiveness of the national <b>essential</b> <b>medicines</b> system in China. </p...|$|R

Policy response is constrained, amongst other factors, by a dearth of in-depth country level evidence. We share here i) gaps related to access to <b>essential</b> <b>medicine</b> in Pakistan; and ii) prioritization of emerging policy and research concerns. METHODS: An exploratory research was carried out using a health systems perspective and applying the WHO Framework for Equitable Access to <b>Essential</b> <b>Medicine.</b> Methods involved key informant interviews with policy makers, providers, industry, NGOs, experts and development partners, review of published and grey literature, and consultative prioritization in stakeholder 2 ̆ 7 s Roundtable. FINDINGS: A synthesis of evidence found major gaps in <b>essential</b> <b>medicine</b> access in Pakistan driven by weaknesses {{in the health care}} system as well as weak pharmaceutical regulation. 7 major policy concerns and 11 emerging research concerns were identified through consultative Roundtable. These related to weaknesses in medicine registration and quality assurance systems, unclear and counterproductive pricing policies, irrational prescribing and sub-optimal drug availability. Available research, both locally and globally, fails to target most of the identified policy concerns, tending to concentrate on irrational prescriptions. It overlooks trans-disciplinary areas of policy effectiveness surveillance, consumer behavior, operational pilots and pricing interventions review.
