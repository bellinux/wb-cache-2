5|$|According to a {{biography}} of Rosenberg on the Center for Nonviolent Communication (CNVC) website, Nonviolent Communication training evolved from <b>his</b> <b>search</b> <b>for</b> a way to rapidly disseminate peacemaking skills.

5|$|Finally, {{to end the}} impasse, Shackleton agreed, in {{a letter}} to Scott dated 17 May 1907, to work to the east of the 170°W {{meridian}} and therefore to avoid all the familiar Discovery ground. In the end it was a promise that he was unable to keep after <b>his</b> <b>search</b> <b>for</b> alternative landing grounds proved fruitless. With his only other option being to return home, he set up his headquarters at Cape Royds, close to the old Discovery base. For this he was roundly condemned by the British polar establishment at the time.|$|E

5|$|A six-issue {{comic book}} series titled God of War, written by Marv Wolfman with art by Andrea Sorrentino, was {{published}} by WildStorm and DC Comics between March 2010 and January 2011. The narrative switches between Kratos' past and present; it occurs while he is a soldier of Sparta and involves <b>his</b> <b>search</b> <b>for</b> the Ambrosia of Asclepius, which has legendary healing properties and eventually saved his plague-ridden daughter, Calliope. Kratos also embarks upon a quest to destroy the same elixir to deny it to the worshippers of the slain god Ares, who wish to resurrect him.|$|E
5|$|Besides Pluto, Makemake is {{the only}} other dwarf planet that was bright enough that Clyde Tombaugh could have {{detected}} it during <b>his</b> <b>search</b> <b>for</b> trans-Neptunian planets around 1930. At the time of Tombaugh's survey, Makemake {{was only a few}} degrees from the ecliptic, near the border of Taurus and Auriga, at an apparent magnitude of 16.0. This position, however, was also very near the Milky Way, and Makemake would have been almost impossible to find against the dense background of stars. Tombaugh continued searching for some years after the discovery of Pluto, but he did not find Makemake or any other trans-Neptunian objects.|$|E
5|$|Captain Nikos– Featured in the God of War comics #2, #3, and #4, Captain Nikos was a Spartan who Kratos met {{after he}} had slain the Hades Phoenix.

Hades later sent fireballs from the sky to stop the Spartan army. As a fireball was about to strike Kratos, Nikos sacrificed himself to save him. Before dying, he passed the rank of Captain to Kratos. During Kratos' second journey, Nikos' corpse, {{and those of other}} Spartans, were reanimated by Hades, but Kratos easily defeated them.|$|E

5|$|Dean Dull {{initiated}} a {{group known as}} the Ramblin' Wreck Committee of the Student Council to aid in <b>his</b> <b>search</b> <b>for</b> a mascot. When the Wreck was found in 1961, the Ramblin' Wreck Committee was chaired by Dekle Rountree. Rountree would drive the Wreck for school functions and Student Council fundraisers. He {{was also the first}} person to drive the Ramblin' Wreck onto Grant Field. Don Gentry, the president of Reck Club in 1961, was the first student to drive the Wreck as he aided in retrieving the Model A from Ted Johnson's home. The Wreck was always maintained by Reck Club but the complete transition of control occurred between 1964–1967. During this period, Reck Club was relieved of its RAT rules enforcement duties and given more wholesome jobs of maintaining the Wreck, upholding traditions, and generating school spirit.|$|E
5|$|During <b>his</b> <b>search</b> <b>for</b> backers, Borchgrevink met Sir George Newnes, {{a leading}} British {{magazine}} publisher and cinema pioneer whose portfolio included the Westminster Gazette, Tit-Bits, Country Life and the Strand Magazine. It {{was not unusual}} for publishers to support exploration—Newnes's great rival Alfred Harmsworth (later Lord Northcliffe) had recently financed Frederick Jackson's expedition to Franz Josef Land, and had pledged financial backing to the National Antarctic Expedition. Newnes was sufficiently impressed by Borchgrevink to offer the full costs of his proposed expedition—around £40,000, (at least £3million in 2008 values). This generosity infuriated Sir Clements Markham and the geographical establishment, who saw Borchgrevink as a penniless Norwegian nobody who had secured British money which they believed {{ought to have been}} theirs. Markham maintained an attitude of hostility and contempt towards Borchgrevink, and chastised Mill for attending the launch of his expedition.|$|E
5|$|In 1949, Mao Zedong's People's Liberation Army {{defeated}} Chiang Kai-shek's United States-backed Kuomintang (KMT) Nationalist Government in China, and the Soviet Union promptly {{created an}} alliance with the newly formed People's Republic of China. According to Norwegian historian Odd Arne Westad, the communists won the Civil War because they made fewer military mistakes than Chiang Kai-Shek made, and because in <b>his</b> <b>search</b> <b>for</b> a powerful centralized government, Chiang antagonized too many interest groups in China. Moreover, his party was weakened during the war against Japan. Meanwhile, the communists told different groups, such as the peasants, exactly {{what they wanted to}} hear, and they cloaked themselves under the cover of Chinese nationalism.|$|E

5|$|Manning {{spent her}} days writing; her main project {{was a book}} about Henry Morton Stanley and <b>his</b> <b>search</b> <b>for</b> Emin Pasha, but she also {{maintained}} an intimate correspondence with Stevie Smith, which was full of Bloomsbury gossip and intrigue. She undertook a dangerous journalistic assignment to interview the former Romanian Prime Minister Iuliu Maniu in Cluj, Transylvania, at the time full of German troops, and soon to be transferred by Romania to Hungary {{as part of the}} Second Vienna Award of August 1940, imposed by the Germans and Italians. Like many of her experiences, the interview was to be incorporated into a future work; others included her impromptu baptism of Reggie with cold tea because she feared being separated from him after death, and Reggie's production of a Shakespeare play, in which she was promised a prime role that was given to another.|$|E
5|$|Series {{producer}} Hiroaki Yotoriyama {{learned that}} comics creator Todd McFarlane {{was a fan}} of the Soul series and that McFarlane had praised their characters' designs. In 2003, McFarlane was interested in creating a new video game based on the Spawn comic book franchise; <b>his</b> <b>search</b> <b>for</b> a developer resulted in a deal with Soul publisher Namco. When the topic of toys arose in discussions, McFarlane and Namco reached an agreement to release a line of action figures based on Soulcalibur II characters. Afterward, Namco proposed that their company design a new character for video game console ports of the game, an idea that McFarlane accepted because he considered it an opportunity to create a toy based on Necrid's finished design.|$|E

Allen stays at the Black Order's Asia Branch headquarters {{to recover from the}} experience.|$|E
500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, according to Matthews, it appeared that Holst might follow Schoenberg into late Romanticism. Instead, as Holst recognised afterwards, his encounter with Purcell's Dido and Aeneas prompted <b>his</b> <b>searching</b> <b>for</b> a [...] "musical idiom of the English language"; the folksong revival became a further catalyst for Holst to seek inspiration from other sources during the first decade or so of the new century.|$|R
