40|$|A desert-sensitive moral theory {{says that}} whether people {{get what they}} <b>deserve,</b> whether they are treated as they <b>deserve</b> to be treated, {{plays a role in}} {{determining}} what we ought to do. Some popular forms of consequentialism are desert-sensitive. But where do facts about what people <b>deserve</b> come from? If someone <b>deserves</b> a raise, or a kiss, in virtue of what does he <b>deserve</b> those things? One plausible answer is that what someone <b>deserves</b> depends, at least in part, on how well he meets his moral requirements. The wicked <b>deserve</b> to suffer and the decent do not. Shelly Kagan (2006) has argued that this plausible answer is wrong. But his argument for that conclusion does not succeed. I will show how to formulate a desert-sensitive moral theory (and also a desert-sensitive version of consequentialism) on which this answer is correct. 1 A problem for desert-sensitive moral theories Desert {{plays an important role in}} our moral thought. Something has gone off, we think, when wicked people prosper and decent people suffer. And that is because the wicked do not <b>deserve</b> to prosper and the decent do not <b>deserve</b> to suffer. ...|$|R

50|$|Desert claims may be {{generally}} expressed as: Thing X <b>deserves</b> Y in virtue of Z. For example, I (X) <b>deserve</b> a good grade on my test (Y) because I studied hard (Z); Cincinnati (X) <b>deserves</b> to be praised (Y) {{because it is}} a pretty city (Z). Some authors have added a further criterion, qualifying Z. That is, Agent X <b>deserves</b> Y in virtue of Z if X is responsible for Z (or, alternatively, if X is also <b>deserving</b> of Z). Considering this stipulation, one does not <b>deserve</b> respect simply because one is a human being, because one is not responsible for being a human being (Z). Arguments such as this are understandably contentious as they suggest an untenability of intrinsic desert claims—that is, claims wherein Z means simply to be X. Less controversially, if one (X) uses steroids to win in a footrace, one is said not to <b>deserve</b> to win (Y) because one is not responsible for, and so does not <b>deserve,</b> ones enhanced physical abilities (Z).|$|R

Bell drew on the parallels between the character of Veronica and her own life, since Bell's parents had divorced and her best friend had also died.

5|$|Cisneros and Martínez {{were arrested}} and charged with capital murder, which in Texas is {{punishable}} with a life sentence or death by lethal injection. Cisneros was taken to the Cameron County jail. On her way there, reporters asked if she was responsible for Fischer's murder, and she shook her head. Cisneros' husband also refused to comment. The police denied her bail, but her attorney said that she was a respected member of the Brownsville community and <b>deserved</b> bail. Cisneros's attorney told the press that the arrest was a mistake, and that he was confident the police had no solid evidence against her. Police responded by saying they were content with her arrest, but still needed to go after other people involved in the murder plot. Martínez' family also said they were shocked by the arrest, saying they hoped it was a mistake, and {{that they did not know}} the Fischers or Cisneros. On April 13, Cisneros was released from prison on a $300,000 bond, refusing to comment as she left. According to court documents, Cisneros did not go before a judge to obtain a bond. Her attorney reached an agreement with the Cameron County Court District after her bond was denied the week before. Martínez remained in prison, and her bond was set at the same amount the next day. Her lawyer stated that she <b>deserved</b> a bond as well because she was a senior citizen and had a clean criminal record.|$|E
