In this paper we probe this issue both theoretically and empirically. First, we discuss Hurlbert and Ling’s (2007) cone-contrast theory, which posits a physiological explanation based on opponent cone outputs and gender differences. We then present an <b>ecological</b> <b>valence</b> theory that color preferences reflect people’s cumulative emotional responses to environmental objects/events strongly associated with particular colors.

40|$|Color {{preference}} {{is an important}} aspect of visual experience, but little is known about why people in general like some colors more than others. Previous research suggested explanations based on biological adaptations [Hurlbert AC, Ling YL (2007) Curr Biol 17 : 623 – 625] and color-emotions [Ou L-C, Luo MR, Woodcock A, Wright A (2004) Color Res Appl 29 : 381 – 389]. In this article we articulate an <b>ecological</b> <b>valence</b> theory in which color preferences arise from people’s average affective responses to color-associated objects. An empirical test provides strong support for this theory: People like colors strongly associated with objects they like (e. g., blues with clear skies and clean water) and dislike colors strongly associated with objects they dislike (e. g., browns with feces and rotten food). Relative to alternative theories, the <b>ecological</b> <b>valence</b> theory both fits the data better (even with fewer free parameters) and provides a more plausible, comprehensive causal explanation of color preferences...|$|E

40|$|Lichens {{represent}} a synergistic combination {{of at least}} two organisms, a heterotrophic fungus and a photosynthetic alga or a cyanobacterium. This association has resulted in a symbiotic organism, which is well tolerant to environmental influences. In fact, symbiotic relationship provides mutual benefit for both organisms. It is generally well known that the fungal partners of lichens are far less sensitive to environmental conditions, such as the temperature, altitude, rainfall or the type and composition of the substrate, in comparison to their algal partners. Therefore, lichen forming fungi have much wider <b>ecological</b> <b>valences</b> than the photobionts interacting with them. Indeed, most of the photosyntetic genera and species are adapted only to certain environmental conditions. For this reason, the symbiotic algae and cyanobacteria probably play a major role during the initial lichen formation on the site. This thesis focuses on the adaptability of photoautotrophic symbionts of lichens, coccoid green algae and cyanobacteria, to environmental conditions. Ecological diversification of photobionts has a direct impact on their genetic differentiation and thus to differentiate lichen species themselves.

40|$|AIM: {{the aim of}} {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the <b>ecological</b> <b>valence</b> of benthic macroinvertebrates at different pollution levels in highland rivers and streams of Rio Grande do Sul; METHODS: the dataset proceeds from samplings performed between 2002 - 2011 in 35 lotic ecosystems. The Chemical Index was used to determine pollution levels. Indices of richness and Shannon diversity were applied to characterize the structure of benthic communities. The descriptors used to determine taxa&#x 27 s <b>ecological</b> <b>valence</b> were selected according to Coefficient of Variation and regression analyses. Groups of tolerance were identified using Interquartile range and cluster analysis; RESULTS: Conductivity and Chemical Index were the descriptors best related with diversity of benthic macroinvertebrate community. These metrics were used to determine the tolerance range of 38 taxa. Interquartile range and cluster analysis revealed three groups of taxa, according to their occurrence in different levels of pollution: taxa with narrow amplitudes, present at sites with very low or very high load of organic enrichment; taxa with moderate amplitude, found until moderately polluted sites; and taxa with occurrence in widespread environmental conditions. The results, when compared to other studies in Brazil, showed differences in some taxa&#x 27 s tolerance.

40|$|Inland epigean {{freshwater}} amphipods of Romania are {{diverse and}} abundant for this region has a favourable geographical position between the Balkans and the Black Sea. Excluding Ponto-Caspian species originating in brackish waters and freshwater subterranean taxa, there are 11 formally recognized epigean freshwater species recorded from this country. They belong to 3 genera, each representing a different family: Gammarus (Gammaridae, 8 species or species complexes), Niphargus (Niphargidae, 2 epigean species) and Synurella (Crangonyctidae, one species). Their large-scale distribution patterns nevertheless remain obscure due to insufficient data, consequently limiting biogeographical interpretations. We provide extensive new data with high resolution distribution maps, thus improving {{the knowledge of}} the ranges of these taxa. Gammarus species display substantial altitudinal variability and patchy, fragmented distribution patterns. They occur abundantly, particularly in springs and streams, from lowlands to sub-mountainous and mountainous regions. In the light of recent molecular research, we hypothesize that the complex geomorphological dynamics of the Carpathian region dur-ing the Late Tertiary probably contributed to their allopatric distribution pattern. Contrasting with Gammarus, the genera Niphargus and Synurella exhibit low altitudinal variability, broad <b>ecological</b> <b>valences</b> and overlapping distributions, being widespread throughout the lowlands. The current distribution of N. hrabei and N. valachicus seems to be linked to the extent of the Paratethys during the Early Pliocene or Pleistocene. We further discuss the taxonomic validity of two syn-onymized and one apparently undescribed taxon, and provide an updated pictorial identification key that includes all taxa and forms discussed in our study. The mosaic distribution of epigean freshwater amphipod species in Romania shows that this region is particularly suitable for phylo- and biogeographical analyses of this group.

40|$|Abstract How are color {{preferences}} formed, and {{can they}} be changed by affective experiences with correspondingly colored objects? We examined these questions by testing whether affectively polarized experiences with images of colored objects would cause changes in color preferences. Such changes are implied by the <b>ecological</b> <b>valence</b> theory (EVT), which posits that color preferences are determined by people’s average affective responses to correspondingly colored objects (Palmer & Schloss, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 107, 8877 – 8882, 2010). Seeing images of strongly liked (and disliked) red and green objects, therefore, should lead to increased (and decreased) preferences for correspondingly colored red and green color patches. Experiment 1 showed that this crossover interaction did occur, but only if participants were required to evaluate their preferences for the colored objects when they saw them. Experiment 2 showed that these overall changes de-creased substantially over a 24 -h delay, but {{the degree to which}} the effect lasted for individuals covaried with the magnitude of the effects immediately after object exposure. Experiment 3 demonstrated a similar, but weaker, effect of affectively biased changes in color preferences when partic-ipants did not see, but only imagined, the colored objects. The overall pattern of results indicated that color preferences are not fixed, but rather are shaped by affective experiences with colored objects. Possible explanations for the observed changes in color preferences were considered in terms of associative learning through evaluative conditioning and/or priming of prior knowledge in memory.

There are hypotheses about influence of environmental factors (habitat openness, temperature, precipitation). In this thesis we tested the influence of these environmental factors, {{but we did not}} discover any relation. Yet we found a strong relation between versatility (<b>ecological</b> <b>valence)</b> and inhabited climate conditions. Sociality could be modified by reproductive parameters (adaptations in greater litter size, longer gestation period and longer lactation period). We discovered relations between sociality (number of individuals in a social group) and gestation period, sociality and lactation period and sociality and litter size. We used phylogenetical correlation and found that the relation between sociality and litter size is not significant. Greater litter size occurs in only one phylogenetical line; hence we consider greater litter size to be not a predisposition, but a result of transition to sociality. It is also not clear what is the ancestral state of sociality and used habitat on the base of the clade. Hypotheses say that the common ancestor of the mongooses was solitary and lived in a closed habitat, but based on our ancestral states reconstruction [...] ...|$|E

It is necessary to avoid the transfer and dissemination of such invasive species in the new environment. To prevent the spread of these species and to control them in general, it is crucial to know their characteristics and to strike at an initial phase of the invasion. The characteristics which make invasive species particularly successful in the new environment are, i. e., wide <b>ecological</b> <b>valence,</b> the ability to disseminate quickly, high competitive potential, and the potential to reproduce in the new environment. Another important factor which contributes to sustained existence of invasive species in the new environment is the absence of predators, parasites, and pathogens.

In general, the management should be directed towards long-term reduction of population size to a predefined level based on mitigation of impacts and reduction of management costs. The EU Strategy on Invasive Species involves a three-stage approach, the three stages being prevention, eradication, and containment. All European states [...] ...|$|E

Due to {{urbanization}} and industrialization, {{and to a lesser extent}} agriculture, Sasar Basin shows a simplification of the biocenosis, more or less brutal, the intensity of pollution. This paper summarizes the results of sampling campaigns that were carried out between 2003 - 2008, when a total of 10 stations of the investigated basin were identified and analyzed, according to the Normalized Global Biological Index (IBGN) methodology. Subsequent to the systematical study, 20 species belonging to 6 Ephemeroptera families (Leptophlebiidae, Ephemeridae, Ephemerelllidae, Caenidae, Heptageniidae, Bäetidae) were identified. Ephemeroptera is a group of demanding environmental conditions; high specific abundance was recorded in the stations located in areas with minimal and moderate anthropogenic impact (upstream Blidari- 10 species; Valley Măriuţii- 10 species, upastream Baia Sprie – 9 species). The number of species is drastically reduced for the stations located downstream of the Baia Sprie and Baia Mare industrial centers (downstream Baia Sprie- 3 species, downstream Baia Mare- 1 species). Within the communities of Ephemeroptera high frequencies were performed by Bäetis rhodani (90 %), considered in terms of the <b>ecological</b> <b>valence,</b> average tolerance to pollution.

During {{the last}} years the {{worldwide}} trend in viticulture research is to restore the local varieties due {{to the importance of}} obtaining quality products, typical, authentic, and so, their research has become a fundamental one. The research was conducted in Silagiu-Buzias viticultural area among 2008 - 2012, and the aim was to identify and enhance the productive potential and quality of local varieties and biotypes, cultivated in the Banat region, particular in the viticultural area Buziaş-Silagiu compared with control varieties. For the estimation and interpretation of genotype x environment interaction and stability of different studied traits, various models of linear regression analysis were used. This method is based on the finding that different components of genotype x environment interaction effects are linearly correlated with environmental conditions shown by the average performance of all genotypes for studied traits. Regression significance and genotypes drift from linear regression was performed using variance analysis by the Hardwick-Wood model. Another method used for assessing the stability was ecovalence method or <b>ecological</b> <b>valence.</b> Considering estimation for the six models used, on the rank sum differences is noted that the highest stability of this trait had varieties: Ochiul boului, Coarnă neagră, Alb crocant de Buziaş, Roşu crocant de Silagiu.

40|$|AIM: This study {{evaluated}} {{the use of}} oligochaetes {{at different levels of}} taxonomic resolution as environmental indicators in Argentine lowland streams affected by different land uses. METHODS: Sampling sites were grouped based on the physicochemical and habitat characteristics (low-, moderate-, and high-impact disturbance). Collection of the oligochaetes samples was carried out seasonally in sediment and vegetation habitats. RESULTS: The increases in nutrients and organic matter produced elevated densities of the Oligochaeta, but when the disturbance also involved changes in the physical habitat or enhancements in toxic substances, the abundance decreased significantly to values even lower than those of non-impacted environments. The responses of Naidinae and Tubificinae were similar. The density of the Pristininae decreased with increasing impact, but those of the Enchytraeidae and Rhyacodrilinae increased at the most highly impacted sites. The Opistocystidae were not recorded in high-impact sites. Species richness and diversity (H') were lower in high-impact sites and even lower in sediments. Some species presented no restrictions in the habitat type or with the contamination level: Limnodrilus hoffmeisteri, Dero furcatus, D. digitata, D. pectinata, Pristina longiseta, and P. aequiseta. Moreover, Trieminentia corderoi, Slavina appendiculata, and Aulodrilus pigueti exhibited the highest abundances at low-impact sites and were not registered in high-impact sites. CONCLUSIONS: The Oligochaeta show a relatively wide <b>ecological</b> <b>valence</b> through their extensive number of species. Although lower taxonomic levels can give information about environmental status, test-species' sensitivities to different types and degrees of contamination will be of utmost relevance to the evaluation of ecological quality...|$|E

The aim of our study is to identify environmental characteristics of varieties of Weigela to extend the range of ornamental plants under urban ecosystem of Krasnodar. We have analyzed the tolerance of varieties of Weigela to the temperature regime in the introduction region, we explored the complex biotic factors influencing the growth and development of these plants, and also studied the morphological characteristics of pollen and pollen productivity of Weigela flowers. Methods. Evaluation of resistance of varieties of Weigela to a complex of abiotic and biotic factors has been conducted {{in the field and}} in the laboratory, taking into account recommendations for ornamental shrubs. Results. Studied Weigela varieties have enough <b>ecological</b> <b>valence</b> to the force of impact of the maximum and minimum air temperatures {{in the area of the}} introduction. The most resistant to the complex of summer stress factors are the following varieties of Weigela: 'Candida', 'Nana Variegata', 'Olimpik Flame', 'Red Rrince'. The most heat-resistant varieties are 'Nana Variegata' and 'Olimpik Flame'. The most winter-hardy varieties are 'Candida' and 'Red Rrince', less winter-hardy variety is 'Nana Purpurea'. The most cold-resistant variety is 'Candida'. 'Nana Variegata' produces the highest number of fertile pollen grains. The smallest amount of fertile pollen is formed by 'Nana Purpurea'.

40|$|<b>Ecological</b> <b>valence</b> theory (EVT; Palmer & Schloss, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 107 : 8877 – 8882, 2010) {{proposes that}} color {{preferences}} {{are due to}} affective responses to color-associated objects: That is, people generally like colors {{to the degree that}} they like the objects associated with those colors. Palmer and Schloss found that the average valence of objects associated with a color, when weighted by how well the objects matched the color (weighted affective valence estimates: WAVE) explained 80 % of the variation in preference across colors. Here, we replicated and extended Palmer and Schloss’s investigation to establish whether color–object associations can account for sex differences in color preference and whether the relationship between associated objects and color preference is equally strong for males and females. We found some degree of sex specificity to the WAVEs, but the relationship between WAVE and color preference was significantly stronger for males than for females (74 % shared variance for males, 45 % for females). Furthermore, analyses identified a significant inverse relationship between the number of objects associated with a color and preference for the color. Participants generally liked colors associated with few objects and disliked colors associated with many objects. For the sample overall and for females alone, this association was not significantly weaker than the association of the WAVE and preference. The success of the WAVE at capturing color preference was partly due to the relationship between the number of associated objects and color preference. The findings identify constraints of EVT in its current form, but they also provide general support for the link between color preference and color–object association...|$|E

40|$|Aim. The article {{presents}} {{the findings of}} the study on fauna, biotopic distribution and zoogeographical analysis of scarabaeidae family of intramontane Dagestan. Methodology. The study of the fauna of scarabaeidae family has been conducted using a variety of methods designed for the field study of entomofauna. To study the biotope distribution we have used samples collected by the methods of soil sampling, pitfall traps and linear accounting. Findings and discussion. Intramontane Dagestan is a kind of an interesting area, which scientists believe is the primary center for the development and spread of xerophilous flora in the Caucasus. Since 1991 Intramontane Dagestan has been considered as a special botanical-geographical province. It occupies the central and western part of the country and widely extends deep into the mountains. According to geobotanical zoning of Dagestan, the studied area belongs to meadow, steppe and upland-xerophilous vegetation areas of Dagestan. In all types of vegetation xerophytic traits are expressed; among meadows significant place is occupied by steppified varieties and among steppes by dry grain and forb-grain varieties. Conclusion. The study has revealed 55 species of scarabaeidae belonging to 28 genera. The study of their biotopic distribution has made it possible to distinguish several groups of species in relation to water conditions. This species are confined exclusively to the mesophytic habitats (mesophiles); species prevailing in mesophytic habitats, but often found in dry habitats (mesoxerophiles); the inhabitants of the natural biotopes, which, however, use areas or seasons of greatest moisture (xerobionts); species confined exclusively to xerophytic habitats, in particular, to the arid slopes (xerophile), as well as species with high <b>ecological</b> <b>valence</b> which populate a variety of habitats (eurybionts). Research on the habitats of the studied species has made it possible to distinguish 14 zoogeographical complexes, which are dominated by the Mediterranean species of origin. </p...|$|E

The features of changes in environmental conditions of ecotypes of an urban forest have been shown through the systematic, biomorphological and ecomorphic structure of the herbaceous cover, the ratio of ecological groups, changes in type of ecological strategy of species, assessment of ecological fractions valences, and phytodiversity. We found 78 species of vascular plants. The most diverse families are Asteraceae, Poaceae and Lamiaceae. The biomorphological range of phytodiversity of the intensive recreational zone {{is characterized by a}} high proportion of adventive and ruderal species, dominance of vegetative mobile species, forming of monodominant groups and disturbed distribution of all spectrum types for coenotic morphs. Perennial hemicryptophytes dominate in the spectrum of life forms. The share of therophytes increased along the gradient of recreational transformation. Unrosellate herbal plants dominate in the structure of aboveground shoots and leaf placement, plants that don’t have special modifications dominate in the structures of underground shoots. Helophytes dominated in the analysis of heliomorphic plants. Mesophytes dominated almost everywhere. The share of hydrocontrastophobes increased with a gradual removal from places of recreation. Changes in acidomorphic and nitromorphic structures of plants were not found. Types of transitional groups of ecological strategies, including CR-, CS-, and CRS-strategies prevailed. The share of patiens diminished. Exsplerents from all types of primary ecological strategies dominated.

Barren brome has been becoming troublesome weed of winter cereals mainly in reduced soil tillage systems. The factors, that are important for its spreading and adaptability under different environmental conditions, are dormancy and germination. Optimal timing for seed germination varies with respect to natural conditions and it is determining for plant development. These traits are adapted to different conditions and habitats; therefore the dormancy and germination response patterns to those conditions vary significantly. Recently {{there are not many}} information available on germination behaviour, therefore this study was focused on seeds of barren brome and its characteristics, which were collected in different regions of the Czech Republic. Seeds were investigated under different temperatures, light regimes and water stress {{in a wide range of}} conditions. The following characteristics of seeds were studied the dormancy, the dynamics of germination, the temperature optimum, the age of seeds and dynamics of emergence from different depths and persistence in the soil profile under field conditions. Dormancy and germination are influenced by external conditions. The dormancy of seeds barren brome is very short or missing. The germination is influenced by light; the seeds germinated better under darkness than under light regime. The primary dormancy of B. sterilis was short and the seeds needed only three weeks for after-ripening. The seeds of B. sterilis showed broad <b>ecological</b> <b>valence</b> to hydrothermal factors germinating in the wide range of 3 to 35 °C. The temperature optimum is 5 - 23 °C. The germination was only slightly influenced in an environment with low water potential. Germination was limited under water stress only at lower temperatures under 10 °C. The response to light at various temperatures showed that seeds germinated better in darkness in all temperatures regimes, than in alternating light regime, especially at lower temperatures. The emergence declined significantly with burial depth (under 40 mm). The seeds were not able to survive in the soil seed bank for a longer time and fall seeds lost viability after 1 year burial in soil profile. These results may be of value for development of predictive models and understanding period when weed control may be most feasible...|$|E
40|$|Decades of {{research}} has established that individuals and groups have reliable preferences for some colours over others. The aim of this thesis is to understand the biological and cognitive mechanisms of these colour preferences. Two recent theories of colour preference are tested, the biological components theory (Hurlbert and Ling, 2007) and the <b>ecological</b> <b>valence</b> theory (EVT; Palmer & Schloss, 2010). The former argues that colour preference is explained by weights on the two cone-opponent channels underlying human colour vision, whereas the latter argues that colour preference is explained by colour-object associations. A series of experiments test these theories by testing different cultures, sexes and ages, and by sampling stimuli throughout colour space. The findings identify serious constraints for both theories. The biological component theory only works well when summarising hue preference, not when colours vary in lightness and saturation. EVT is effective at explaining the colour preference of males, but not females. For both theories, previous claims of 'universal' patterns of preference across cultures are not supported. The thesis also investigates whether 'mere exposure' (brief, repeated exposure to stimuli) influences colour preference, as it does for other basic stimuli. A series of experiments indicate that mere exposure influences colour preference for males but not females. This suggests that, at least for some groups, there could be basic cognitive processes that affect colour preference that are domain general. Overall, it is concluded there are multiple routes to colour preference, and that further research should consider how the various underlying mechanisms of colour preference combine and interact for different types of observers.

40|$|The epigeic fauna in {{the sink}} holes was studied using {{formaldehyde}} ground traps at 14 -day intervals from April to October in 2002 and 2003. A total of 5 transects of traps have been installed within 5 selected areas of {{the northern part of}} the Moravian Karst. Areas within the district of Vilémovice, Lažánky and Ostrov near Macocha villages have been studied in particular. Sink holes have been selected on the basis of how they are probably influenced by human activities (types such as regularly mown sink holes within a thoroughly exploited field – 1, sink holes partially or totally overgrown by shrubs – 3 and 2, sink holes with fully developed trees – 4, sink holes within an intensely exploited meadow – 5. It was the aim of this study to determine the species composition of individual areas, numbers of individual species, differences among areas characterised by synoecological characteristics such as the dominance, Shannon-Wieneręs index of species diversity, equitability, Jaccardęs index of similarity and to try to express the degree of anthropogenic influence. Similarity of individual areas has also been evaluated by means of the cluster analysis (on the basis of the Jaccardęs index). Eudominant species were Abax parallelepipedus, Anchomenus dorsalis, Carabus ullrichi, Microlestes maurus, Poecilus cupreus and Pterostichus melanarius. Species such as Aptinus bombarda, Licinus depressus, Molops elatus and Syntomus obscuroguttatus were the most important ones. The highest and lowest values of the index of species diversity were found in the area No. 4, and 1 and 2, respectively. Equitability was the highest and the lowest in the area No. 4 and 1, respectively. According to the Jaccardęs index, areas No. 2 and 3, and No. 1 and 4 were the most and least similar ones, respectively. A total of 53. 3 %, 45. 6 % and 1. 1 % of species could, be classified as belonging to the group E, A and R, respectively. The group E represents eurytopic species inhabiting a large variety of habitats, the group A contains species of more or less natural habitats while in the group R there are species with the most narrow <b>ecological</b> <b>valence.</b> The highest index of community was in the area No. 4, while the lowest in the area No. 1. The total results and the evaluation of characteristics such as dominance, index of diversity, equitability, ecological bond to the habitat expressed by species classification of A, E or R and the index the carabid beetle community proves the fact that areas No. 4 and 5 are under the least anthropogenic influence...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 50 - 53) The {{purpose of}} this study is to identify gender differences in apparel consumer???s color selections amongst personality and emotion and to examine if color selection impacts personal image differently according to gender. Literature relates the consumer???s apparel color selections to different factors such as gender, age, personality, time place and occasion, associations, emotion, and culture. However, we still do not have a clear explanation of whether or not there are gender differences in color selection according to these factors or if color selection impacts individuals differently according to their gender (Palmer & Schloss, 2009). A research model was developed, proposing that personality and emotion influence color selection and color selection influence??? personal image. This research model was also used to determine if there were any gender differences in the proposed relationships between the variables (emotion, personality, and personal image). Six different hypotheses were developed based on the literature review and the research model. Hypothesis 1 proposed that personality influences apparel consumer???s color selections. Hypothesis 2 suggests that emotion influences apparel consumer???s color selection and hypothesis 3 assumes that apparel consumer???s color selection impacts their personal image. Hypothesis 4 proposed that the influence of personality on color selection is different by gender. Hypothesis 5 suggested that the influence of emotion on color selection is different by gender and hypothesis 6 indicates that the influence of color selection on the impact of personal image is different by gender. Two focus group interviews were conducted; one male focus group and one female. A qualitative approach was used for the study. Interviews were conducted to test the proposed hypotheses by asking participants questions pertaining to color selection. The results were in support of hypothesis 1 - 3. There was a significant influence of personality and emotion on color selection and that color selection impacted participants??? personal image. For hypothesis 4, the results did not indicate a significant difference amongst genders personalities influencing their color selections. However, the results did support hypothesis 5 - 6, indicating that there was a difference amongst genders emotions influencing their color selections and there was a gender difference in their color selections impacting their personal image. Women were more influenced by their emotions when selecting colors in apparel (H 5) and there was a much greater level of impact from their color selections on their personal image (H 6). The academic significance of this study was to utilize an existing theory to build knowledge upon it. Application of the hunter-gatherer theory was appropriate for this study because prior studies have related the hunter-gatherer theory to gender differences within color selection. Additional qualitative research can explore the validity of the <b>Ecological</b> <b>Valence</b> Theory (EVT) in relation to gender differences in color selection. The information gathered from this study can also be utilized by providing image consulting services to examine individual???s personality types and in order to come up with a color palette that is specifically provided to them according to their personality type. The ambiance inside of clothing stores should not be overlooked when results from this study indicate consumers are influenced by their emotion when selecting apparel colors. Furthermore, the interior design and music are both very important details that can be used to enhance sales. If the influence and impacts are there for male consumers, however, they are just not aware or conscious of them, and then marketers should strategize how to make male consumers more aware in order to increase sales...|$|E
