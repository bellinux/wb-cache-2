5|$|For {{wives and}} {{families}} of prisoners of war, life under the occupation was particularly <b>hard.</b> <b>In</b> pre-war France, the husband was generally the household's chief wage earner, so many households saw {{a sharp drop}} in income and living standards.|$|E
5|$|The Great Depression (1929–c. 1939) hit {{especially}} <b>hard</b> <b>in</b> Western Canada, including Manitoba. The {{collapse of}} the world market combined with a steep drop in agricultural production due to drought led to economic diversification, moving away from a reliance on wheat production. The Manitoba Co-operative Commonwealth Federation, forerunner to the New Democratic Party of Manitoba (NDP), was founded in 1932.|$|E

5|$|A global {{financial}} crisis was triggered in 2008, {{beginning in the}} United States. The financial crisis of 2008 which continued into 2009, had {{a major impact on}} the Swedish economy. Reinfeldt's Government emphasized that a balanced budget was a priority, combined with income tax cuts to stimulate domestic production and commerce. The Cabinet received criticism for holding to <b>hard</b> <b>in</b> the public finances, with limited investments, and the support of Reinfeldt's policies dropped to one of the lowest ever seen for an incumbent Government.|$|E
5|$|Amidst {{his years}} of studying, Lundgren honed his karate skills by {{training}} <b>hard</b> <b>in</b> the dojo for five years, attaining the rank of 2nd dan black belt in Kyokushin in 1978. He captained the Swedish Kyokushin karate team, and was a formidable challenger at the 1979 World Open Tournament (arranged by the Kyokushin Karate Organization) {{when he was only}} a green belt. He won the European championships in 1980 and 1981, and a heavyweight tournament in Australia in 1982. In 1982, Lundgren graduated with a master's degree in chemical engineering from the University of Sydney. During his time in Sydney, he earned a living as a bouncer in a nightclub in the renowned King's Cross area.|$|E

5|$|Johnston then {{knocked over}} Charlie Barnett's stumps as the batsman leaned {{onto the front}} foot and inside edged the ball into his stumps for eight; this brought Godfrey Evanswho was given two livesto the crease at 6/60. Evans hit Johnston <b>hard</b> <b>in</b> the air to cover, where the ball went through Bradman for a boundary. The second {{catching}} opportunity went {{in the same direction}} before traveling through Bradman's hand and striking him in the abdomen. However, Johnston eventually snared Evans, who hit a ball strongly, but straight to short leg where Arthur Morris took the catch close in, as England reached 8/74.|$|E
5|$|The clay-rich Willamette Valley {{soils are}} <b>hard</b> <b>in</b> the dry season, and the gopher's protuberant incisors are well adapted to these conditions. Adequate soil {{drainage}} and suitable plant food are essential {{components of the}} gopher's ideal habitat. Not typically found in wetland areas (where its tunnels would flood), the species is found in seral communities of grasses and shrubs. They are also established in agricultural fields in the Willamette Valley, including fields of alfalfa, wheat and oats. The species has also been found in areas of ecological disturbance with similar terrain features.|$|E
5|$|A sailor's {{work was}} <b>hard</b> <b>in</b> {{the days of}} sail. When off duty, many sailors played musical {{instruments}} or joined in unison to sing folksongs such as the mid-eighteenth century ballad The Mermaid, a song which expressed the sailors' superstition that seeing a mermaid foretold a shipwreck. When on duty, there were many repetitive tasks, such as turning the capstan to raise the anchor and heaving on ropes to raise and lower the sails. To synchronise the crew's efforts, sea shanties were sung, with a lead singer performing the verse and the sailors joining in the chorus. In the Royal Navy in Nelson's time, these work songs were banned, being replaced by the notes of a fife or fiddle, or the recitation of numbers.|$|E

5|$|Arsenal again went on {{the attack}} as the second half began, with another corner won {{following}} a header by Buchan. Hulme drifted in a well placed cross, but nothing was made of it. It was then Cardiff's turn to attack. Curtis sent in a low shot which was saved by Lewis in the Arsenal goal. Shortly afterwards, Butler, the Arsenal midfielder, was struck <b>hard</b> <b>in</b> the face by the ball causing a brief delay to play. The game resumed, and McLachlan took it down the wing for Cardiff, who passed it to Davies, but his shot was just wide of the post. Buchan attempted to return the game to Arsenal's tempo, with a long pass to the left wing for Hoar, but Cardiff City's James Nelson had him covered. City's attacking continued, and a chance was had by Hardy which appeared to shake Lewis in goal as the keeper didn't gather the ball cleanly.|$|E
5|$|Back in New Zealand, Lynch {{did well}} in the premier women's road stage race in 1991 and 1992, and won bronze in the 1991 New Zealand National Road Race Championships, yet was not picked for the 1992 Olympic road cycling team. Her biographer speculates that the {{selectors}} were possibly influenced in their decision by Lynch's failure to get Harris into a medal position at the 1990 Commonwealth Games. She competed <b>hard</b> <b>in</b> the 1992 Tour Cycliste Féminin – the Tour de France for women. The ten-stage race was the most challenging event on the women's road racing calendar that year, and many big names entered. New Zealand had six competitors. Lynch {{set the tone for}} the team by coming fourth in the prologue in Paris. Jacqui Nelson and Lynch were the only New Zealanders remaining in the final stage, and Lynch came sixth ascending into Alpe d'Huez. Her biographer suggests that she made her point that her omission from the 1992 Olympic team had been a mistake.|$|E
5|$|By the {{following}} day, Mickl's kampfgruppe was deployed {{on the high}} ground {{on either side of}} the airfield at Sidi Rezegh. That afternoon, British armoured cars and tanks appeared, and Mickl's force was hard-pressed to hold its positions barring the British approach to Tobruk from the south and south-east, as little tank support was available. In the face of a superior force, Mickl's kampfgruppe fought <b>hard</b> <b>in</b> what became known as the Battle of Sidi Rezegh, with their commander often forward rallying his troops, and in the thick of counter-attacks launched to regain ground. Mickl and around 800 of his troops were captured by elements of the New Zealand Division on 26 November 1941, the captured troops being mainly from the Afrika Regiment.|$|E

5|$|Concepts of women's {{social rights}} {{and social status}} during the Tang era were notably liberal-minded for the period. However, this was largely {{reserved}} for urban women of elite status, {{as men and women}} in the rural countryside labored <b>hard</b> <b>in</b> their different set of tasks; with wives and daughters responsible for more domestic tasks of weaving textiles and rearing of silk worms, while men tended to farming in the fields. There were many women in the Tang era who gained access to religious authority by taking vows as Daoist priestesses. The head mistresses of the bordellos in the North Hamlet of the capital Chang'an acquired large amounts of wealth and power. Their high-class courtesans, who likely influenced the Japanese geishas, were well respected. These courtesans were known as great singers and poets, supervised banquets and feasts, knew the rules to all the drinking games, and were trained to have the utmost respectable table manners.|$|E
5|$|In {{advance of}} the storm, {{preparations}} were extensive; residents boarded up homes and businesses, while evacuations were recommended in some coastal areas. In the Bahamas, where winds reached , the storm killed three people. The city of Nassau was struck particularly <b>hard.</b> <b>In</b> Florida, damage was relatively severe, and included the deaths of several people. High winds brought down trees and power lines, though the storm was characterized by highly unusual rainfall patterns. In the Everglades region, a storm surge flooded local streets. As the storm progressed northward, the city of Tallahassee suffered widespread power outages and damage to numerous vehicles. Throughout the state, the hurricane inflicted $675,000 USD ($ 2011 USD) in damage. The cyclone later killed one person in Georgia.|$|E
5|$|In the 400m {{freestyle}} heats, Windle and Talbot made a misjudgement; in {{an attempt}} to conserve his energy for the final they decided that Windle should not go flat out, and Windle was four seconds slower than he was at the Australian Championships. Windle was one of the top seeds for the race, and Talbot advised him to swim <b>hard</b> <b>in</b> {{the first half of the}} race before slowing down. However, he swam too slowly and missed the final completely. Although he won his heat by seven seconds in a time of 4min 21.6s, he was the ninth fastest overall, so he missed the final by one position with a time deficit of 0.5s. The slowest qualifier was Tsuyoshi Yamanaka, who had been prevented from withdrawing from the race by his coaches. On the other hand, the two other Australian representatives who he defeated at the national championships did make the final, including Wood, who went on to win bronze. Talbot said that the tactical error was mostly his responsibility and that he learnt a lot from it.|$|E

5|$|Missouri {{arrived at}} Ulithi on 9 May and then {{proceeded}} to Apra Harbor, Guam, arriving on 18 May. That afternoon Admiral William F. Halsey, Jr., Commander Third Fleet, brought his staff from cruiser Louisville onto the Missouri. She passed out of the harbor on 21 May, and by 27 May was again conducting shore bombardment against Japanese positions on Okinawa. Missouri led the 3rd Fleet in strikes on airfields and installations on Kyūshū on 2–3 June. She rode out a fierce storm on 5 and 6 June. Some topside fittings were smashed, but Missouri suffered no major damage. Her fleet again struck Kyūshū on 8 June, then hit <b>hard</b> <b>in</b> a coordinated air-surface bombardment before retiring towards Leyte. She arrived at San Pedro Bay, Leyte on 13 June, after almost three months of continuous operations {{in support of the}} Okinawa campaign.|$|E
5|$|Nathan {{spent all}} of 2003 with the Giants in the bullpen after marrying Lisa Lemoncelli, his girlfriend of five years, in November 2002. This was a {{breakout}} year for Nathan, starting the season with 23 scoreless innings {{en route to a}} 12–4 record in his first full year as a reliever. His 78 appearances put him {{high on the list of}} most-used pitchers for the season as one of the best setup men in the NL, allowing no runs in 15 appearances from July 18 to August 20. His 12 wins in relief led the majors. The Giants won the National League West by 15 games and drew the Florida Marlins, the National League's wild card winner, in the NLDS. Nathan was hit <b>hard</b> <b>in</b> that series, blowing his only save opportunity. His team fared no better, winning Game 1 behind Jason Schmidt's complete game shutout before dropping the next three.|$|E
5|$|The Canadians {{subsequently}} occupied Hill 677 {{and began}} digging-in, deploying their six Vickers medium machine-guns in sections to add depth, and using defensive fire tasks {{to cover the}} gaps in their positions. Meanwhile, the Australians occupied Hill 504, with D Company holding the summit itself, A Company the spur-line which ran down to the north-west, and B Company the small hill by the river, while C Company was in reserve on the rear spur. In response to US IX Corps requirements Burke directed Ferguson to site his headquarters in the low ground of the valley {{in the vicinity of}} the hamlet of Chuktun-ni, so as to control the withdrawing South Koreans. However, this would limit Ferguson's situational awareness and his ability to control the battle, while also leaving them exposed to infiltration. The afternoon was spent on the lightly scrub-covered slopes digging-in and building sangers where the rocky ground proved too <b>hard.</b> <b>In</b> only a few hours the Australians managed to prepare hasty defensive positions, although defensive fire tasks were unable to be registered as the artillery Forward Observers were unable to reach the company positions until after dark.|$|E
