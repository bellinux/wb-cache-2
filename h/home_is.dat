We also compared students in the control group with students in experimental groups by race, sex, and socioeconomic level. The results of the year-long study revealed that students whose <b>homes</b> <b>were</b> called on days when they were absent, using the computer-assisted telecommuni-cation devices, showed higher subsequent attendance rates than did students whose <b>homes</b> <b>were</b> not called. 1 The {{purpose of this}} study was to determine if selected students who were absent from school and who received calls to their homes from the principal, via a computer message device, would have a better school attendance record than would students whose <b>homes</b> <b>were</b> not called. 2 We expect that students who were absent on a particular day, and whose <b>homes</b> <b>were</b> called by a programmed computer device, would have better attendance records than would students whose <b>homes</b> <b>were</b> not called.
