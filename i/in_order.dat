Means of eradication can be physical, thermal, managerial, biological or chemical. A combination of several of these can be most effective, though they must of course be compatible. All have some positive and negative aspects, but the most effective regimen is generally a mixture of chemical and physical control.

This one was extended for nondecreasing mappings by Nieto and Lopez [2, 3]. Meanwhile, Agarwal et al.

For the sake of contrast, the measurement of optical absorption was also made on disordered na-noscale indium particles.

It was also found that the peak position of nanoscale indium particles <b>in</b> <b>ordered</b> arrays after heat treatment had a blue-shift compared to that before heat treatment.

40|$|In practice, some of {{information}} systems are based on dominance relations, and values of decision attribute are fuzzy. So, it is meaningful to study attribute reductions <b>in</b> <b>ordered</b> decision tables with fuzzy decision. In this paper, upper and lower approximation reductions are proposed {{in this kind of}} complicated decision table, respectively. Some important properties are discussed. The judgement theorems and discernibility matrices associated with two reductions are obtained from which the theory of attribute reductions is provided <b>in</b> <b>ordered</b> decision tables with fuzzy decision. Moreover, rough set approach to upper and lower approximation reductions is presented <b>in</b> <b>ordered</b> decision tables with fuzzy decision as well. An example illustrates the validity of the approach, and results show that it is an efficient tool for knowledge discovery <b>in</b> <b>ordered</b> decision tables with fuzzy decision...|$|R
