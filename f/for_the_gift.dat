5|$|Reformed confessions {{reject the}} Catholic {{doctrine}} that the Eucharist is a sacrifice of propitiation, or sacrifice to satisfy God's wrath and attain forgiveness of sins. Instead, they teach that Christ's body {{is only to}} be received, not re-presented to God as a sacrifice. The confessions do sometimes speak of the Supper as a sacrifice of thanksgiving <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>gift</b> of propitiation which has been received. In the twentieth century, Scottish Reformed theologian T. F. Torrance developed a strong doctrine of Eucharistic sacrifice. He argued that Christ's person and work could not be separated, and that the Eucharist mediated his sacrificial death.|$|E
5|$|Singing was {{sporadic}} and in {{a cappella}} or occasionally there would be singing in tongues. There were periods of extended silence. Attenders were occasionally slain in the Spirit. Visitors gave their testimony, and members read aloud testimonies that {{were sent to the}} mission by mail. There was prayer <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>gift</b> of tongues. There was prayer in tongues for the sick, for missionaries, and whatever requests were given by attenders or mailed in. There was spontaneous preaching and altar calls for salvation, sanctification and baptism of the Holy Spirit. Lawrence Catley, whose family attended the revival, said that in most services preaching consisted of Seymour opening a Bible and worshippers coming forward to preach or testify as they were led by the Holy Spirit. Many people would continually shout throughout the meetings. The members of the mission never took an offering, but there was a receptacle near the door for anyone that wanted to support the revival. The core membership of the Azusa Street Mission was never much more than 50–60 individuals with hundreds and thousands of people visiting or staying temporarily over the years.|$|E

500|$|The fourth English edition, {{published}} in 1769, was personally supervised by Franklin while visiting London from Philadelphia. He made several corrections on {{different parts of}} the first three editions and wrote explanatory notes. One important correction Franklin noted in the Forward was that Letters 1 and 2 had been transposed and he had corrected that. He added a letter that was important to him. It was a letter to Collinson dated March 28, 1747. Franklin had thanked him <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>gift</b> of the German [...] "electric tube" [...] with directions on how to use it to make electricity. He was much appreciative of this, so he made that particular one Letter #1. This then advanced the numbering sequence of the Letters by one from the first three editions.|$|E
500|$|Barney Hoskyns {{describes}} [...] "Heylin's objections [...] {{the academic}} ones of a touchy Dylanologist: The Basement Tapes still contained {{some of the}} greatest music either Dylan or The Band ever recorded." [...] Sid Griffin similarly defends the inclusion of The Band's songs: [...] "'Ain't No More Cane' may be included under false pretenses, but it is stirring stuff. ... And while a Dylan fan might understandably grumble that he wanted to hear another Bob song, a fan equally versed and interested more generally in late 20th-century American music would only smile and thank the Good Lord <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>gift</b> of this song." [...] Of The Band's version of [...] "Don't Ya Tell Henry", he writes, [...] "True, the argument could be made that Robertson was way outside his brief in including this on the two-LP set, as this wasn't from Woodstock or '67, and has no Dylan on it. ... But it is a song from The Basement Tapes era and it swings like a randy sailor on shore leave in a bisexual bar. So give Robbie a break." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the latter}} part of the 1820s, Willis began {{contributing}} more frequently to magazines and periodicals. In 1829, he served as editor <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>gift</b> book The Token, making him the only person to be editor in the book's 15-year history besides its founder, Samuel Griswold Goodrich. That year, Willis founded the American Monthly Magazine, which began publishing in April 1829 until it was discontinued in August 1831. He blamed its failure on the [...] "tight purses of Boston culture" [...] and moved to Europe to serve as foreign editor and correspondent of the New York Mirror. In 1832, while in Florence, Italy, he met Horatio Greenough, who sculpted a bust of the writer. Between 1832 and 1836, Willis contributed a series of letters for the Mirror, about half of which were later collected as Pencillings by the Way, printed in London in 1835. The romantic descriptions of scenes and modes of life in Europe sold well despite the then high price tag of $7 a copy. The work became popular and boosted Willis's literary reputation enough that an American edition was soon issued.|$|E

500|$|According to {{reviewer}} Heid Erdrich, Mom & Me & Mom {{does not}} center on Angelou's childhood trauma, {{as described in}} Caged Bird, but [...] "rather constructs a portrait of self via details of her relationship to the mother who abandoned her and with whom she reunited as a teenager". [...] Erdrich states that Angelou's prose is [...] "very simply written", and calls her tone [...] "mostly light, even sweet, filled with affection for her younger self". [...] Erdrich states that even though {{it could have been}} written for young women experiencing the same difficulties Angelou faced, the book does not preach, but [...] "presents Angelou’s life path scattered with enormous obstacles endured and conquered through knowledge of self and a singular brand of mother love". [...] Publishers Weekly agrees, stating, [...] "The lessons and love presented here will speak to those trying to make their way in the world". [...] Erdrich also states that Angelou's narrative of her [...] "hard-won love for her extraordinary mother" [...] is compelling, and that Angelou portrays Baxter [...] "as extraordinarily self-aware, liberated from what others might think, and independent beyond any feminist of her era" [...] and [...] "the stuff of fiction but real and responsible in unexpected ways <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>gift</b> of her talented daughter".|$|E
500|$|In mid-September, the Republican ticket faced a major crisis. The media {{reported}} that Nixon had a political fund, maintained by his backers, which reimbursed him for political expenses. Such a fund was not illegal, but it exposed Nixon to allegations of possible conflict of interest. With pressure building for Eisenhower to demand Nixon's resignation from the ticket, the senator went on television to deliver {{an address to}} the nation on September 23, 1952. The address, later termed the Checkers speech, was heard by about 60 million Americans—including the largest television audience up to that point. Nixon emotionally defended himself, stating that the fund was not secret, nor had donors received special favors. He painted himself as a man of modest means (his wife had no mink coat; instead she wore a [...] "respectable Republican cloth coat") and a patriot. The speech would be remembered <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>gift</b> which Nixon had received, but which he would not give back: [...] "a little cocker spaniel dog … sent all the way from Texas. And our little girl—Tricia, the 6-year-old—named it Checkers." [...] The speech prompted a huge public outpouring of support for Nixon. Eisenhower decided to retain him on the ticket, which proved victorious in the November election.|$|E
500|$|Treves {{observed}} that Merrick was very sensitive and showed his emotions easily. At times Merrick was bored and lonely, and demonstrated signs of depression. He {{had spent his}} entire adult life segregated from women, first in the workhouse and then as an exhibit. The women he met were either disgusted or frightened by his appearance. His opinions about women were derived from his memories {{of his mother and}} what he read in books. Treves decided that Merrick would like to be introduced to a woman and it would help him feel normal. The doctor arranged for a friend of his named Mrs. Leila Maturin, [...] "a young and pretty widow", to visit Merrick. She agreed and with fair warning about his appearance, she went to his rooms for an introduction. The meeting was short, as Merrick quickly became overcome with emotion. He later told Treves that Maturin had been the first woman ever to smile at him, the first to shake his hand. She kept in contact with him and a letter written by Merrick to her, thanking her <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>gift</b> of a book and a brace of grouse (a pair of birds), is the only surviving letter written by Merrick. This first experience of meeting a woman, though brief, instilled in Merrick a new sense of self-confidence. He met other women during his life at the hospital, and appeared taken with them all. Treves believed that Merrick's hope was to go to live at an institution for the blind, where he might meet a woman who could not see his deformities.|$|E
