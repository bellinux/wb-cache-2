40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with traffic accidents and safety management in Nigeria. It focuses on trends in road crashes and carries out a critical review of current road safety approaches {{with a view to}} identifying their defects and deficiencies in tackling the traffic accident problem in the country. Accident records and details of current safety measures obtained from such relevant agencies as the Federal Road Safety Corps, The Nigeria Police and Department of Road Transport Services in addition to maps and photographs provided the basic data for the study. The results show the generally high rate <b>of</b> <b>accidents</b> in Nigeria with the driver as the main culprit, the functional limitations of FRSC as the lead agency for road safety matters, the practical difficulties of implementing the driver licence and vehicle registration schemes, and poor driving culture of Nigerians arising from weak traffic education, public awareness and enforcement programmes. Restructuring and re-tooling of the lead agency, <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> traffic <b>accidents</b> as a national health problem and institution of driver identity management system among others are proposed to improve safe motoring in Nigeria...|$|R
40|$|When {{stress-related}} {{diseases are}} increasing, the preventive work becomes increasingly important. The aim with {{this essay is}} to determine established law about psychosocial working environment. With the legal dogmatic method, an investigation has been made about the law on working conditions and what it says about preventive work to the psychosocial working environment. After a profound investigation regarding the frameworks pros and cons, {{it is possible to}} draw the conclusion that the law on working environment should keep the character of framework. Even if this entails difficulties with interpretation, it is not suitable to regulate the details in a law that should be appropriate for every profession. By studying the regulations of Swedish Work Environment Authority, the law is clarified. However, they should also clarify the concepts, which the law refers to, in order to know when the law should be applied. The same problem occurs when an analysis is made <b>of</b> the <b>declaration</b> forms <b>of</b> <b>accidents</b> and incidents. As a consequence of a weakly formulated definition of “serious incident”, problems arise when applying the law. How stress-related incidents should be treated is also weakly formulated, which could complicate and delay the preventive work. This is because the employers only know that they should report the diseases but not the incidents...|$|R
40|$|Geoinformation {{modelling}} {{serves as}} a methodological basis for development of means for prognosis of environmental and social consequences <b>of</b> <b>accidents</b> at trunk pipelines. One of numerous aspects of this problem is fragmentation of a pipeline into linear objects by environmental characteristics including technical state and probable environmental and social consequences <b>of</b> an <b>accident.</b> Rational planning <b>of</b> the pipeline linear section overhauls, <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> industrial and environmental safety, development of valid standards for the pump station emergency service and other aspects depend on the correct solution of these problems. When making management decisions under the conditions of uncertainty or limited initial information a comparative assessment (ranks) <b>of</b> probable <b>accident</b> consequences at these pipeline sections should become an effective means for determining the required reliability level of a trunk pipeline section...|$|R

In that case upon the <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> cessation of incapacity, a change of regent takes place, with {{the person who has}} a lower place in the order of succession ceasing to be the regent, and in his or her stead the person with a higher position in the order of succession, who had only ceased to be regent due to the <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> incapacity, resuming the office of regent. The requirements for <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> cessation of incapacity regarding the regent are the same ones that are valid for a <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> cessation of incapacity regarding the sovereign.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{determine}} whether rates <b>of</b> road traffic <b>accidents</b> were higher in diabetics treated with insulin than in non-diabetic subjects. DESIGN [...] Controlled, five year retrospective survey. SETTING [...] Diabetic, dermatology, and gastroenterology outpatient clinics. PATIENTS [...] 596 Diabetics treated with insulin (354 drivers) aged 18 - 65 attending two clinics and 476 non-diabetic outpatients (302 drivers). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Rates <b>of</b> <b>accidents</b> in diabetic and non-diabetic subjects. RESULTS [...] A self completed questionnaire {{was used to}} record age, sex, driving state, and rates <b>of</b> <b>accidents</b> and convictions for motoring offences among diabetic and non-diabetic volunteers. For the diabetic volunteers further information was obtained on treatment, experience <b>of</b> hypoglycaemia, and <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> disability to the Driving and Vehicle Licensing Centre and their insurance company. Accident rates were similar (81 (23 %) diabetic and 76 (25 %) non-diabetic drivers had had accidents in the previous five years). A total of 103 diabetic drivers had recognised hypoglycaemic symptoms while driving during the previous year. Only 12 reported that hypoglycaemia had ever caused an accident. Overall, 249 had declared their diabetes to an insurance company. Of these, 107 had been required to pay an increased premium, {{but there was no}} excess <b>of</b> <b>accidents</b> in this group. CONCLUSIONS [...] Diabetic drivers treated with insulin and attending clinics have no more accidents than non-diabetic subjects and may be penalised unfairly by insurance companies...|$|R
