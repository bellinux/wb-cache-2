Bee rental for pollination is a crucial element of U.S. agriculture, which could not produce anywhere near its current levels with native pollinators alone. U.S. beekeepers collectively earn much more from renting their bees out for pollination than they do from honey production.|$|E

During the occupation, the Japanese forces used Tiku as a symbol of Torajan struggle against colonial aggression, working to unite the people against Europeans. However, this was poorly received in conquered areas such as Baruppu' and Sesean, where Tiku was remembered as a man who killed others to steal their wives.|$|E
5|$|Despite the Supreme Court's {{desire to}} resolve {{conflicts}} between circuit courts, legal scholars disagree about whether circuit splits are detrimental or beneficial.

Scholars have also observed that regional variations in <b>different</b> <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> the United States have provided certain circuits with a particular specialization or expertise in some subjects of the law.|$|E
