40|$|In this dissertation, {{we present}} several main {{research}} thrusts involving thermodynamic stabilization via energy dissipating <b>hybrid</b> <b>controllers</b> and nonlinear {{control of network}} systems. Specifically, a novel class of fixed-order, energy-based <b>hybrid</b> <b>controllers</b> {{is presented as a}} means for achieving enhanced energy dissipation in Euler-Lagrange, lossless, and dissipative dynamical systems. These dynamic controllers combine a logical switching architecture with continuous dynamics to guarantee that the system plant energy is strictly decreasing across switching. In addition, we construct <b>hybrid</b> dynamic <b>controllers</b> that guarantee that the closed-loop system is consistent with basic thermodynamic principles. In particular, the existence of an entropy function for the closed-loop system is established that satisfies a hybrid Clausius-type inequality. Special cases of energy-based <b>hybrid</b> <b>controllers</b> involving state-dependent switching are described, and the framework is applied to aerospace system models. The overall framework demonstrates that energy-based <b>hybrid</b> resetting <b>controllers</b> provide an extremely efficient mechanism for dissipating energy in nonlinear dynamical systems. Next, we present finite-time coordination controllers for multiagent network systems. Recent technological advances in communications and computation have spurred a broad interest in autonomous, adaptable vehicle formations. Distributed decision-making for coordination of networks of dynamic agents addresses a broad area of applications including cooperative control of unmanned air vehicles, microsatellite clusters, mobile robotics, and congestion control in communication networks. In this part of the dissertation we focus on finite-time consensus protocols for networks of dynamic agents with undirected information flow. The proposed controller architectures are predicated on the recently developed notion of system thermodynamics resulting in thermodynamically consistent continuous controller architectures involving the exchange of information between agents that guarantee that the closed-loop dynamical network is consistent with basic thermodynamic principles.

40|$|Abstract — This {{paper is}} a {{response}} to requests from several respected colleagues in academia for a careful writeup of the classical time-optimal control based <b>hybrid</b> <b>controllers</b> that we have been using for material transport control in our modular reconfigurable manufacturing systems application. Specifically, we show how classical closed form time optimal control, which exploits the special structure of double integrator systems (ie ones with point-mass Newton’s Law dynamics) can be used to design <b>hybrid</b> <b>controllers</b> for waypoint tracking. While double integrator dynamics are very simple, they are extremely prevalent in many domains, beyond manufacturing systems, eg, transportation, disk drives, robotics, and aerospace. We present two methods, one which will track general way point specs, and another which will track waypoints that lie on convex or concave trajectories. Both approaches are based on appropriate setting (switching) of the state of a reference generator with the same point mass dynamics in a two-degree-of-freedom controller topology. The techniques we present ad-mit very compact implementations, suitable for use in low cost micro controllers and DSP chips used in modular reconfigurable embedded systems applications. Since these controllers were to be integrated with a discrete planner, as part of the control software of a large complex new research platform, every effort was made to keep the controllers as simple as possible. Our controllers can be viewed as examples of basic <b>hybrid</b> <b>controllers</b> that are being used successfully in practice, and can be used as benchmarks by controls researchers for more sophisticated hybrid control design methods.

40|$|Abstract — The {{problem of}} {{designing}} <b>hybrid</b> <b>controllers</b> {{in order to}} satisfy safety or liveness specifications has received much attention in the past decade. Much more recently, there is an increased interest in designing <b>hybrid</b> <b>controllers</b> in order to achieve more sophisticated discrete specifications, such as those expressible in temporal logics. A great challenge is how to compose safety and liveness controllers in order to achieve more complex specifications. Existing approaches are predominantly bottom-up, {{in the sense that the}} overall control and composition (or switching) logic requires verification of the integrated closed-loop hybrid system. In this paper, we advocate and develop a top-down approach for this problem by synthesizing controllers which satisfy the specification by construction. Given a flat linear temporal logic specification as an input, we develop an algorithm that translates the temporal logic specification into a hybrid automaton where in each discrete mode we impose controller specifications for the continuous dynamics. In addition to achieving the desired specification by construction, our methodology provides a very natural interface between high level logic design and low level control design. I...|$|R
