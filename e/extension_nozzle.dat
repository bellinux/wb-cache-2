40|$|Abstract. We have {{developed}} an improved HVOF spray process called “Gas-shrouded HVOF” (GS-HVOF) {{over the past several}} years. By using an <b>extension</b> <b>nozzle</b> at the exit of a commercial HVOF spray gun, GS-HVOF is capable of controlling the oxidation of sprayed materials during flight as well as achieving higher velocity of sprayed particles. These features result in extremely dense and clean microstructure of the sprayed coatings. The process has been successfully applied to corrosion resistant alloys such as SUS 316 L, Hastelloy C, and alloy 625 as well as cermets such as WC-Cr 3 C 2 -Ni. The spray process, coatings microstructure and property evaluation will be discussed with potential industrial applications in the near future. 1...|$|E

The specific wear rates of the coatings prepared by the GS-HVOF with a reducing (fuel rich) flame were close to that of chrome plating. The wear amount of the heat-treated GS-HVOF coatings could not be detected after testing.

40|$|Carbon-carbon (C-C) {{composite}} <b>nozzle</b> <b>extensions</b> are {{of interest}} for use {{on a variety of}} launch vehicle upper stage engines and in-space propulsion systems. The C-C <b>nozzle</b> <b>extension</b> technology and test capabilities being developed are intended to support National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and United States Air Force (USAF) requirements, as well as broader industry needs. Recent and on-going efforts at the Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) are aimed at both (a) further developing the technology and databases for <b>nozzle</b> <b>extensions</b> fabricated from specific CC materials, and (b) developing and demonstrating low-cost capabilities for testing composite <b>nozzle</b> <b>extensions.</b> At present, materials development work is concentrating on developing a database for lyocell-based C-C {{that can be used for}} upper stage engine <b>nozzle</b> <b>extension</b> design, modeling, and analysis efforts. Lyocell-based C-C behaves in a manner similar to rayon-based CC, but does not have the environmental issues associated with the use of rayon. Future work will also further investigate technology and database gaps and needs for more-established polyacrylonitrile- (PAN-) based C-C's. As a low-cost means of being able to rapidly test and screen <b>nozzle</b> <b>extension</b> materials and structures, MSFC has recently established and demonstrated a test rig at MSFC's Test Stand (TS) 115 for testing subscale <b>nozzle</b> <b>extensions</b> with 3. 5 -inch inside diameters at the attachment plane. Test durations of up to 120 seconds have been demonstrated using oxygen/hydrogen propellants. Other propellant combinations, including the use of hydrocarbon fuels, can be used if desired. Another test capability being developed will allow the testing of larger <b>nozzle</b> <b>extensions</b> (13. 5 - inch inside diameters at the attachment plane) in environments more similar to those of actual oxygen/hydrogen upper stage engines. Two C-C <b>nozzle</b> <b>extensions</b> (one lyocell-based, one PAN-based) have been fabricated for testing with the larger-scale facility...|$|R
40|$|There was {{interest}} {{in understanding the}} impact of out-of-round <b>nozzle</b> <b>extension</b> on the <b>nozzle</b> side load during transient startup operations. The out-of-round <b>nozzle</b> <b>extension</b> could {{be the result of}} asymmetric internal stresses, deformation induced by previous tests, and asymmetric loads induced by hardware attached to the nozzle. The objective of this study was therefore to computationally investigate the effect of out-of-round <b>nozzle</b> <b>extension</b> on the <b>nozzle</b> side loads during an engine startup transient. The rocket engine studied encompasses a regeneratively cooled chamber and nozzle, along with a film cooled <b>nozzle</b> <b>extension.</b> The computational methodology is based on an unstructured-grid, pressure-based computational fluid dynamics formulation, and transient inlet boundary flow properties derived from an engine system simulation. Six three-dimensional cases were performed with the out-of-roundness achieved by three different degrees of ovalization, elongated on lateral y and z axes: one slightly out-of-round, one more out-of-round, and one significantly out-of-round. The results show that the separation line jump was the primary source of the peak side loads. Comparing to the peak side load of the perfectly round nozzle, the peak side loads increased for the slightly and more ovalized <b>nozzle</b> <b>extensions,</b> and either increased or decreased for the two significantly ovalized <b>nozzle</b> <b>extensions.</b> A theory based on the counteraction of the flow destabilizing effect of an exacerbated asymmetrical flow caused by a lower degree of ovalization, and the flow stabilizing effect of a more symmetrical flow, created also by ovalization, is presented to explain the observations obtained in this effort...|$|R

A full analysis of the thermo-mechanical loading of the <b>nozzle</b> <b>extension</b> tubes of this engine has to model the production, the welding and the cyclic loading of the tubes during the hot run. In the current extended abstract, only the welding of the <b>nozzle</b> <b>extension</b> tubes is considered. At DLR Lampoldshausen, no dedicated welding analysis tool is available. Therefore, the welding of the <b>nozzle</b> <b>extension</b> tubes was modeled by a general purpose Finite Element code (ANSYS).

40|$|Carbon-Carbon Advanced Technologies, Inc. (C-CAT), has {{developed}} a high-melt coating for use in <b>nozzle</b> <b>extensions</b> in next-generation spacecraft. The coating is composed primarily of carbon-carbon, a carbon-fiber and carbon-matrix composite material that has gained a spaceworthy reputation due to its ability to withstand ultrahigh temperatures. C-CAT's high-melt coating embeds hafnium carbide (HfC) and zirconium diboride (ZrB 2) within the outer layers of a carbon-carbon structure. The coating demonstrated enhanced high-temperature durability and suffered no erosion during a test in NASA's Arc Jet Complex. (Test parameters: stagnation heat flux= 198 BTD/sq ft-sec; pressure=. 265 atm; temperature= 3, 100 F; four cycles totaling 28 minutes) In Phase I of the project, C-CAT successfully demonstrated large-scale manufacturability with a 40 -inch cylinder representing {{the end of a}} <b>nozzle</b> <b>extension</b> and a 16 -inch flanged cylinder representing the attach flange of a <b>nozzle</b> <b>extension.</b> These demonstrators were manufactured without spalling or delaminations.

50|$|For the {{new engine}} model, a <b>nozzle</b> <b>extension</b> was {{designed}} {{that could be}} added {{to the base of the}} new standard “short” nozzle when extra performance was required. But when the engine was fitted with the <b>nozzle</b> <b>extension,</b> the 7A encountered a new problem with unprecedented side-loads and irregular heating on the nozzle strong enough to damage the gimbal actuators and regenerative cooling tubes during startup. Meticulous computational fluid dynamics (CFD) work was able to sufficiently replicate and trace the dangerous transient loading and a new one-piece “long” nozzle with full regenerative cooling (as opposed to the original short nozzle with a separate film-cooled extension) was designed to mitigate the problem. Before this new nozzle was ready, some H-IIA’s were launched using only the short nozzle. The 7A no longer uses a separate <b>nozzle</b> <b>extension</b> in any configuration.|$|R
40|$|Upper {{stage and}} in-space liquid rocket engines are {{optimized}} for performance {{through the use}} of high area ratio nozzles to fully expand combustion gases to low exit pressures increasing exhaust velocities. Due to the large size of such nozzles and the related engine performance requirements, carbon-carbon (C/C) composite <b>nozzle</b> <b>extensions</b> are being considered for use in order to reduce weight impacts. NASA and industry partner Carbon-Carbon Advanced Technologies (C-CAT) are working towards advancing the technology readiness level of large-scale, domestically-fabricated, C/C <b>nozzle</b> <b>extensions.</b> These C/C extensions have the ability to reduce the overall costs of extensions relative to heritage metallic and composite extensions and to decrease weight by 50 %.

40|$|The J- 2 X {{engine is}} being {{designed}} for NASA s {{new class of}} crew and launch vehicles, the Ares I and Ares V. The J- 2 X is a LOX/Hydrogen upper stage engine with 294, 000 lbs of thrust and a minimum Isp of 448 seconds. As part of the design criteria to meet the performance requirements a large film-cooled <b>nozzle</b> <b>extension</b> is being designed to further expand the hot gases and increases the specific impulse. The <b>nozzle</b> <b>extension</b> is designed using Haynes 230, a nickel-chromium-tungsten-molybdenum superalloy. The alloy was selected for its high strength at elevated temperatures and resistance to hydrogen embrittlement. The <b>nozzle</b> <b>extension</b> is manufactured from Haynes 230 plate spun-forged to form the contour and chemically-milled pockets for weight reduction. Currently fusion welding is being evaluated for joining the panels which are then mechanically etched and thinned to required dimensions for the <b>nozzle</b> <b>extension</b> blank. This blank is then spun formed into the parabolic geometry required for the nozzle. After forming the <b>nozzle</b> <b>extension,</b> weight reduction pockets are chemically milled into the nozzle. Fusion welding of Haynes results in columnar grains which are prone to hot cracking during forming processes. This restricts {{the ability to use}} spin forging to produce the nozzle contour. Solid state joining processes are being pursued as an alternative process to produce a structure more amenable to spin forming. Solid state processes have been shown to produce a refined grain structure within the joint regions as illustrated in Figure 1. Solid state joining processes include friction stir welding (FSW) and a patented modification termed thermal stir welding (TSW). The configuration of TSWing utilizes an induction coil to preheat the material minimizing the burden on the weld tool extending its life. This provides the ability to precisely select and control the temperature. The work presented in this presentation investigates the feasibility of joining the Haynes 230 alloy using the solid state welding processes of FSW and TSW. Process descriptions and attributes of each weld process will be presented. Weld process set-up and welding techniques will be discussed leading to the challenges experienced in joining the superalloy. Mechanical property data will also be presented...|$|R
50|$|For {{first stage}} rocket engines, the engine works with <b>nozzle</b> <b>extension</b> in {{disposed}} position {{during the first}} minutes of flight and expands it at some predefined level of air pressure. This scheme assumes the outer skirt of the bell is extended while the engine is functioning and its installation to working position happens in the upper layers of the atmosphere. It excludes problems with flow separation at sea level and increases efficiency of the engine in vacuum. For example, application of <b>nozzle</b> <b>extension</b> for liquid rocket engine NK-33 improves the value of specific impulse up to 15-20 sec for near-space conditions. Therefore, this scheme adjusts the system to ambient conditions along the trajectory or, in other words, allows altitude compensation.|$|R
