Plaumann has argued that this follows the <b>false</b> <b>logic</b> <b>that</b> the decree would only be valid once the magistrate carries it out, while in his opinion a reluctance to abide by it is possible. The killing of Tiberius Gracchus was in this case nevertheless {{not covered by the}} SCU since it was not the consul who carried it out. Chen Kefeng has pointed out that [...] "in comparison with the later ones, [...] was uncommon and in inconformity to the orthodox formula due to the un-cooperation of the highest magistrate".|$|E
2500|$|In {{discussing}} {{the lack of}} female heroes in video games, particularly in video games published by Activision, Gamasutra news director Leigh Alexander cited GLaDOS while arguing that the [...] "females do not sell" [...] notion is possibly <b>false</b> <b>logic,</b> stating <b>that</b> {{she was on the}} fast track to becoming one of gaming's most beloved characters. Gamasutra writers Leigh Alexander, Brandon Boyer, Simon Carless, and Christian Nutt listed GLaDOS as being the second-most affecting video game character, being the highest-ranked actual character because the most affecting video game character was the player. They attribute the overall quality of Portal to GLaDOS, stating that without her, Portal would not be nearly as quotable. They added that the relationship between GLaDOS and the player-character has been described as passive-aggressive, maternal, and a [...] "feminist manifesto".|$|R

Analysis of the data record, which included interviews, observations, and documents, reveal that despite a framework for action, both teachers remained confused about their role and the content of the curriculum.

40|$|The Durbin Amendment is {{the first}} of the major {{provisions}} of the Dodd-Frank Act to have been implemented-but only after it withstood a constitutional challenge {{on the basis of the}} Takings Clause in the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. Now that the Amendment has taken effect, this Article addresses the <b>false</b> economic <b>logic</b> <b>that</b> led to its passage and the dubious arguments used to sustain its constitutionality. On the first issue, the supporters of the Durbin Amendment denounced the highly effective debit card system as a form of cartelization of the industry, which yields excessive returns to banks while overcharging retailers high rates for low-cost services. That objection rests on three central fallacies. The first is that the industry is monopolistic, when in fact, there is extensive competition for customers at every level. The second is that this critique ignores the economics of two-sided markets, under which transfer payments from retailers to customers expands the universe of debit card customers, spreading around the cost of operating the system. The third is that the costs of providing debit card services are limited to the marginal costs of providing services, but this critique ignores the fixed costs necessary to put the system in place. The failure to realize that these fixed costs need protection against government expropriation is the central error of the Eighth Circuit, which falsely assumed that firms in competitive industries need less protection than regulated monopolies. The paradox is that this argument gets it exactly backwards. The justification for regulating natural monopolies is to imitate competitive rates to the extent possible. But that justification is singularly unavailable with the debit card industry, which the Eighth Circuit held lacked monopoly power. At this point, there is no justification for any rate regulation, given that the debit card companies are already at the competitive rate and cannot recoup all their losses-direct charges to their customers requires the loss of the efficiency gains that interchange fees are able to exploit to good effect in a two-sided economic market. Thus, the Durbin Amendment, because of paradoxical thinking, has resulted in unconstitutional regulatory takings of the debit card companies...|$|R

The Robinson’s resolution principle is generalized for situation when a clause can take the don’t care value. Methods for the transition from partial deductive reasoning to inference in the first order predicate logic are proposed. The presented theoretical results are illustrated with examples. The proposed models and methods speed up the deductive reasoning process and decrease the number of clauses needed for knowledge representation...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Behavioral subtyping forces {{objects of}} subtypes {{to behave in}} the same way as objects of supertypes.

In this paper, we argue that the standard relative completeness notion is too stringent for program <b>logics</b> <b>that</b> are based on behavioral subtyping. Subsequently, we propose two novel and complementary completeness notions that can be employed to assess the strength of program <b>logics</b> <b>that</b> rely on behavioral subtyping. ...|$|R
