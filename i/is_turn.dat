25|$|Laser Spectroscopy (or Cavity ring-down spectroscopy, CRDS) {{is able to}} {{directly}} measure D/H, 17O/16O and 18O/16O isotope compositions in water or methane. The application of laser spectroscopy to hydrogen isotopes was first reported by Bergamaschi et al. in 1994.CH4/12CH4 and 12CH3D/12CH4 ratios in atmospheric methane sources {{by means of a}} long-path tunable diode laser absorption spectrometer|url=http://ao.osa.org/abstract.cfm?URI=ao-33-33-7704|journal=Applied Optics|volume=33|issue=33|doi=10.1364/AO.33.007704|pages=7704}} They directly measured 12CH3D/12CH4 in atmospheric methane using a lead salt tunable diode laser spectroscopy. The development of CRDS was first reported by O’Keefe et al. in 1988. In 1999, Kerstel et al. successfully applied this technique to determine D/H in water sample. The system consists of a laser and a cavity equipped with high finesse reflectivity mirrors. Laser light is injected into the cavity, at which the resonance takes place due to the constructive interference. The laser then <b>is</b> <b>turn</b> off. The decay of light intensity is measured. In the presence of a water sample, the photo-absorption by water isotopologues follows the kinetic law. The optical spectrum is obtained by recording ring-down time of the H2O spectral features of interest at certain laser wavelength. The concentration of each isotopologue is proportional to the area under each measured isotopologue spectral feature.|$|E

2500|$|Turn 8 (nicknamed [...] "Diabolica" [...] by some in {{reference}} to Monza's Curva Parabolica) particularly caught the imagination. The corner is a fast, sweeping corner with four apexes, similar {{to one of the}} multi-apex sections of the old Nürburgring. Spectators and drivers alike raved about Turn 8, comparing it to legendary corners such as Eau Rouge and 130R. The circuit itself has already been compared to Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps. Another notable corner <b>is</b> <b>Turn</b> 1, a sharp downhill left-hander immediately after the front straight. This corner has been nicknamed by some as the [...] "Turkish Corkscrew" [...] {{in reference}} to the famous Corkscrew at Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca. Both the 2006 F1 and MotoGP races at the circuit featured multiple incidents at this corner. A third noteworthy area is the uphill kink {{in the middle of the}} back straight; due to its similarity to Eau Rouge, it has been jokingly referred to as [...] "Faux Rouge".|$|E
