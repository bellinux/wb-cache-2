5|$|The last {{eruption}} of Mauna Kea was about 4,600 years ago (about 2600 BCE); {{because of this}} inactivity, Mauna Kea is assigned a United States Geological Survey hazard listing of 7 for its summit and 8 for its lower flanks, out of the lowest possible hazard rating of 9 (which {{is given to the}} <b>extinct</b> <b>volcano</b> Kohala). Twenty percent of the volcano's summit has seen lava flows in the past 10,000 years, and its flanks have seen virtually no lava flows during that time.|$|E

5|$|Gilbert, {{producers}} Broccoli and Harry Saltzman, production designer Ken Adam {{and director}} of photography Freddie Young then went to Japan, spending three weeks searching for locations. SPECTRE's shore fortress headquarters was changed to an <b>extinct</b> <b>volcano</b> after the team learned that the Japanese do not build castles by the sea.
