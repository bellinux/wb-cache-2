He soon {{established}} himself as a stamp dealer and cataloguer (as a sideline to owning a stationery and printing shop) in New York City, and published the Descriptive Price Catalogue of All Known Postage Stamps of the United States and Foreign Countries in 1876. [...] In 1879, he began printing stamps for the Dominican Republic and the Colombian State of Bolivar. These stamps were printed under a standard sort of printing contract, where he received a <b>fee</b> <b>for</b> <b>printing</b> a specified number of stamps. However, with the Bolivar issues, he began the soon to be infamous practice of year-dating otherwise identical stamp designs. Seebeck was successful {{enough to be able to}} sell his business in 1884 and purchase a significant interest in the Hamilton Bank Note Engraving and Printing Co., whose main contract was for printing tickets for the New York City transportation system.|$|E

40|$|To {{what degree}} are audit <b>fees</b> <b>for</b> U. S. firms with {{publicly}} traded equity higher than <b>fees</b> <b>for</b> otherwise similar firms with private equity? The answer is potentially important for evaluating regulatory regime design efficiency and for understanding audit demand and production economics. For U. S. firms with publicly traded debt, we hold constant the regulatory regime, including mandated issuer reporting and auditor responsibilities. We vary equity ownership and thus public securities market contextual factors, including any related public firm audit fees from increased audit {{effort to reduce}} audit litigation risk and/or pure litigation risk premium (litigation channel effects). In cross-section, we find that audit <b>fees</b> <b>for</b> public equity firms are 20 - 22 % higher than <b>fees</b> <b>for</b> otherwise similar private equity firms. Time-series comparisons for firms that change ownership status yield larger percentage <b>fee</b> increases (decreases) <b>for</b> those going public (private). Results are consistent with litigation channel effects giving rise to substantial incremental audit <b>fees</b> <b>for</b> U. S. firms with public equity ownership...|$|R
