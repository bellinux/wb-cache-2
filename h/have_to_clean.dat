50|$|Rondalee {{steps up}} for the White Team, taking on two NFLers: Scott for the Red Team and Damien for the Blue Team. The Blue Team is down to only two players - Damien and Lori - so the stakes are {{especially}} high. The Red Team hasn't won a challenge all season {{and they are very}} sick of losing. Rondalee is the first to fall in, leaving the quarterback and the lineman to face off. It's a tough battle, but in the end Damien drops, which means Scott nabs the Red Team's first victory! Now it's time to assign the penalties. One team will be on cleaning duty - they <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>clean</b> the whole house and can't hit the gym until their chores are done. The other team will be leaving the ranch and won't be back until the weigh-in. They won't have their trainer or access to the gym. Instead, they'll be headed to the polar opposite of the ranch: Las Vegas. The Red Team decides to send the White Team to Vegas, seeing as they've been the dominant team all season. That means Damien and Lori are going to <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>clean</b> house all week.|$|E
