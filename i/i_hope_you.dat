5|$|I am {{excited to}} give my Australian fans the World Premiere of 'Love On Top'! Thank you for the amazing {{response}} to the song at radio. I have worked very hard on this video, this song is special to me and I had an idea for the video based on {{some of my favorite}} male groups. I remember seeing videos from New Edition, The Jackson 5 and the Temptations, bands I love for their beautiful harmonies, and precise choreography and I always wanted to make a video and be part of a boy group myself. It was so much fun. I put my heart and soul into 'Love On Top' and <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> love it.|$|E
25|$|Well, John {{has been}} on hunger strike since July. He {{resisted}} the forcible feeding for a good while, but submitted to the inevitable. Now he is being fed by a stomach tube twice daily. He has aged very much and has {{the look of a}} man who is going through torture... Seemingly anything is law in regard to John. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> will make the atrocity public. We must get him out of their clutches. It is nothing but slow murder...|$|E
25|$|Before I forget it, let {{me remind}} you that I shall want the trunk and the things you took away from my house as soon as possible. I learn that instead of taking old things, you took my best. Mrs. Rogers is at the White Mountains. I am going to Fairhaven this afternoon. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> will not be there. By the way, I have been using a pair of your gloves in the Mountains, and they don't seem to be much of an attraction.|$|E

6000|$|... "Niece, <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>I</b> see <b>you</b> well in health." [...] Miss Nancy {{kissed her}} aunt's cheek dutifully, and answered, {{with the same}} sort of amiable primness, [...] "Quite well, I thank <b>you,</b> aunt; and <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>I</b> see <b>you</b> the same." ...|$|R
25|$|In March 2011, Oz sent imprisoned former Tanzim leader Marwan Barghouti {{a copy of}} {{his book}} A Tale of Love and Darkness in Arabic {{translation}} with his personal dedication in Hebrew: “This story is our story, <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> read it and understand us as we understand you, hoping to see you outside and in peace, yours, Amos Oz”. The gesture was criticized by members of rightist political parties, among them Likud MK Tzipi Hotovely. Assaf Harofeh Hospital canceled Oz's invitation to give the keynote speech at an awards ceremony for outstanding physicians in the wake of this incident.|$|E
500|$|In June 2016, McGregor {{supported}} Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn after mass resignations {{from his}} cabinet and a leadership challenge. McGregor tweeted, [...] "Good for you! The turncoats in your party {{should be ashamed}} of themselves. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> find the support you deserve." ...|$|E
500|$|I did {{not know}} about [...] {{involvement}} in this company. As an adult, he made that decision. It was a lapse in judgement for him to get involved with this company. I wish he hadn't done it. I know the expectations for elected officials, their families, are very high—rightfully so—especially for me.... Patrick is a very good son. I love him. Maggie and I are very proud of him. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> respect I have nothing more to say on this.|$|E

6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] said Ingleby, with a {{trace of}} confusion. [...] "Of course, there wasn't any reason. Still, <b>I</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>you</b> would. That was why I waited." ...|$|R
500|$|The Junta {{reconfirmed}} the order, but excluded {{the bishop}} of Córdoba, Rodrigo de Orellana, who was banished instead. Castelli was commissioned by the Junta to enforce the execution order. Mariano Moreno said, [...] "Go, Castelli, and <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> will not incur the same weakness as our general, if not yet fulfilled the determination, Larrea will go, and finally I'll go myself if necessary". Ocampo and Chiclana were demoted. Castelli's assistants were Nicolás Rodríguez Peña, elected as secretary, his former client Diego Paroissien as a campaign doctor, and Domingo French {{as head of the}} escort.|$|E
500|$|The song's second {{video was}} {{released}} via Kesha's YouTube account. She revealed the video's completion, release and inspiration through a video description quote saying, [...] "heyy {{to all my}} fans! so me [...] my friends were bored and we were really channeling some 80's [...] (Tron, David Bowie in Labyrinth, and Revenge of the Nerds.) and we made this new video for take it off. it was really fun to make. <b>i</b> <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> guys like it". The video was directed by Skinny. This version of the video is known as [...] "Take it Off (K$ N' Friends Version)".|$|E
500|$|In 1999, {{during the}} spring of Cho's eighth grade year, the Columbine High School {{massacre}} made international news and Cho was transfixed by it. [...] "I remember sitting in Spanish class with him, right next to him, and there being something written on his binder to the effect of, you know, ' 'F' you all, <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> all burn in hell,' which I would assume meant us, the students," [...] said Ben Baldwin, a classmate of Cho. Also, Cho wrote in a school assignment about wanting to [...] "repeat Columbine". The school contacted Cho's sister, who reported the incident to their parents. Cho was sent to a psychiatrist.|$|E
6000|$|You have {{possibly}} spoken nearer the truth than you dreamed. <b>I</b> married <b>you,</b> Tom, <b>hoping</b> great things of <b>you.</b> <b>I</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>you</b> {{would be a}} power for good-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I can go, if {{you want}} to get rid of me," [...] said Mavering, with unresentful sadness. [...] "But <b>I</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>you</b> might have {{something}} to suggest, Boardy.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{where are}} the others?" [...] the girl said with a shudder. [...] "How {{imprudent}} {{of you to come}} here! <b>I</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>you</b> had seen them coming toward the house." ...|$|R
500|$|When the Associated Press picked Petoskey {{as only a}} second-team All-American in 1933, ten-year-old Mary Lee Grossman from Saginaw, Michigan protested in {{a letter}} to AP sports editor, Alan Gould, that he had [...] "chosen wrong" [...] in leaving Petoskey and Whitey Wistert off the first-team. [...] To avoid any {{appearance}} of bias, the Saginaw native noted: [...] "You may think I am a friend of these boys but I do not know either of them. [...] <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> change your mind." [...] Gould responded to Miss Grossman in his column: [...] "You may be right, Mary Lee, but it's too late now to change our mind." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{lyrics of}} [...] "Tim McGraw" [...] regard a summer romance {{that came to}} a sudden halt. The song fondly reminisces an ex-boyfriend, and directs the lyrics towards him, rather than country singer Tim McGraw himself. It uses McGraw's music as a marker in their {{relationship}} timeline: [...] "When you think Tim McGraw / <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> think my favorite song." [...] Sean Dooley of About.com stated, [...] "Music {{has the power to}} evoke memories, and it's an old Tim McGraw song that triggers her happy memories." [...] McGraw's reference is one of the several items used for association of the failed relationship, along with other items and places, such as a little black dress.|$|E
500|$|On {{the other}} hand, Truman once remarked {{that he did}} not {{understand}} how the US Army could [...] "produce men such as Robert E. Lee, John J. Pershing, Eisenhower and Bradley {{and at the same time}} produce Custers, Pattons and MacArthur." [...] His relief of MacArthur cast a long shadow over American civil-military relations for decades. When Lyndon Johnson met with William Westmoreland in Honolulu in 1966, he told him: [...] "General, I have a lot riding on you. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> don't pull a MacArthur on me." [...] MacArthur's relief [...] "left a lasting current of popular sentiment that in matters of war and peace, the military really knows best", a philosophy which became known as [...] "MacArthurism".|$|E
6000|$|... "Dear me! Won't {{the truth}} do, then? <b>I</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>you</b> {{could have told}} them {{something}} consoling. I am thinking of the poor mother now. Your Russia is a cruel country." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why? Speak out, Russ. All {{this comes}} like a blow. There {{for a little}} <b>I</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>you</b> had worked out things {{differently}} from me. No hope. Ruin her life! Why?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was telling}} your father," [...] said Mrs. Jackson, on shaking hands, [...] "that <b>I</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>you</b> were {{properly}} grateful {{for all the}} mercies that have been bestowed upon you." ...|$|R
500|$|The Maharishi celebrated Harrison's 25th {{birthday}} and Harrison played sitar. He gave Harrison an upside-down plastic globe {{of the world}} and said: [...] "George, the globe I am giving you symbolizes the world today. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> will help us all in the task of putting it right." [...] Harrison immediately turned the globe to its correct position, shouting, [...] "I've done it!" [...] (Harrison [...] "affectionately" [...] referred to the Maharishi as the [...] "Big M"). On 8 April, the Maharishi gave an Indian prince's outfit to the Lennons for their son in England on his birthday. McCartney was uncomfortable with the Maharishi's flattery, including calling the band [...] "the blessed leaders of the world's youth".|$|E
500|$|The {{relief of}} MacArthur cast a long shadow over American civil-military relations. When Lyndon Johnson met with General William Westmoreland in Honolulu in 1966, he told him: [...] "General, I {{have a lot}} riding on you. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> don't pull a MacArthur on me." [...] For his part, Westmoreland and his senior colleagues were eager to avoid any hint of dissent or {{challenge}} to presidential authority. This came at a high price. In his 1998 book , then-Lieutenant Colonel (now National Security Advisor) H. R. McMaster argued that the Joint Chiefs failed in their duty to provide the President, Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara or Congress with frank and fearless professional advice. This book was an influential one; the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the time, General Hugh Shelton, gave copies to every four-star officer in the military.|$|E
500|$|Booker {{has never}} been married, and in 2013 he was named one of Town & Country’’s [...] "Top 40 Bachelors". Although he has {{generally}} tried to keep his personal life private, Booker {{has in the past}} described himself as a [...] "straight male" [...] and has said that he is trying to date more in hopes of finding someone to settle down with. [...] In a 1990 column in the Stanford Daily, Booker admitted that as a teenager he had [...] "hated gays". [...] Booker has himself been the target of rumors about being gay and has generally refused to address these on principle, which he explained in 2013: Because I want to challenge people on their homophobia. I love seeing on Twitter when someone says I'm gay, and I say, [...] "So what does it matter if I am? So be it. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> are not voting for me because you are making the presumption that I'm straight." ...|$|E
6000|$|There was {{something}} in his voice which brought the hot tears to her eyes and she replied, gently: [...] "I'm very sorry, Osborne. <b>I</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>you</b> wouldn't care--so much, and I didn't mean--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I have no explanation, my dear Beatrice,' he {{answered}} at last, making a strong effort over himself, 'except what I have already given <b>you.</b> <b>I</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>you</b> would never recur to the subject.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then I {{beg your}} pardon, mother. I {{certainly}} wasn't {{thinking of her}} alone. But she is proud, and <b>I</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>you</b> would let her feel that we realize all that she is doing." ...|$|R
500|$|B in the Mix: The Remixes {{received}} little promotion compared to Spears' standards. A promotional extended play (EP) titled Key Cuts from Remixed with several remixes from {{the album was}} released in September 2005. A contest was launched on Spears' paid fan site for those who pre-ordered the album. The winner received a copy of , a bottle of Spears' fragrance Fantasy with an additional lotion and make-up kit, and a personalized autographed picture of Spears. On November 22, 2005, the day the album was released, a release party was held at an unspecified nightclub in Los Angeles, California, organized by Spears' management and the webmaster of the fansite WorldOfBritney.com. It was a limited event to five hundred people, including members of the fansite or her official fan club. Spears commented: [...] "I {{just wanted to say}} that I love the idea of all my fans getting together to celebrate the release of my new album. I was happy to help! <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> have a great night out at the club and dance all night long!".|$|E
500|$|In October 1970 Shankar became {{chair of}} the {{department}} of Indian music of the California Institute of the Arts after previously teaching at the City College of New York, the University of California, Los Angeles, and being guest lecturer at other colleges and universities, including the Ali Akbar College of Music. In late 1970, the London Symphony Orchestra invited Shankar to compose a concerto with sitar. Concerto for Sitar & Orchestra was performed with André Previn as conductor and Shankar playing the sitar. Shankar performed at the Concert for Bangladesh in August 1971, held at Madison Square Garden in New York. After the musicians had tuned up on stage for over a minute, the crowd of rock-music fans broke into applause, to which the amused Shankar responded: [...] "If you like our tuning so much, <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> will enjoy the playing more." [...] Although interest in Indian music had decreased in the early 1970s, the live album from the concert became one of the best-selling recordings to feature the genre and won Shankar a second Grammy Award.|$|E
500|$|Potter {{borrowed}} a cat, {{and took a}} pet rabbit to Fawe Park as models. Her meticulous preparation before finalizing an illustration was noted {{in a letter to}} Warne: [...] "I think I have done every imaginable rabbit background and miscellaneous sketches as well – about seventy! [...] <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> will like them, though rather scribbled." [...] Scribbled or not, the work is of the highest quality with the sketches of onions and red carnations (which were dropped as the frontispiece) being chief examples. The illustrations communicate her obvious appreciation and love for the humble pots, onions, and flowers of the garden. [...] Many of the objects in the illustrations [...] the gate, the potting shed, the wall [...] have changed little over the years and are recognizable today from her illustrations. Aware the type of story she was writing was set primarily in colours of fawn, brown, and soft green, Potter wrote that, [...] "the (red) handkerchief will make a good bit of colour all through the book." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I thought," [...] Gwendolen went on--"at least <b>I</b> <b>hoped,</b> <b>you</b> {{would not}} object to sing at our house on the 4th--in the evening--at a party like Lady Brackenshaw's. I should be so much obliged." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{like fun}} that makes other people unhappy. I am {{disappointed}} in <b>you,</b> Demi, for <b>I</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>you</b> would never learn to tease Daisy. Such a kind little sister {{as she is}} to you." ...|$|R
