40|$|Even with no new introductions, {{the number}} of {{biological}} invasions in South Africa will increase as introduced species naturalise and become invasive. As of 2010 South Africa had ~ 8750 introduced plant taxa, 660 recorded as naturalised, 198 included in invasive species legislation, but only 64 subject to regular control (i. e. only widespread invaders are managed post-border). There is only one documented example of a successful eradication programme in continental South Africa against the Mediterranean snail (Otala punctata) in Cape Town. Here we describe the establishment in 2008 of a unit funded by the Working for Water Programme {{as part of the}} South African National Biodiversity Institute's Invasive Species Programme (SANBI ISP) designed to (1) detect and document new invasions, (2) provide reliable and transparent post-border risk assessments and (3) provide the cross-institutional coordination needed to successfully implement national <b>eradication</b> <b>plans.</b> As of the end of 2012, the ISP had an annual budget of R 36 million, employed 33 staff working across all nine provinces, supported 10 postgraduate students, hosted 35 interns (including those as part of a drive to collect DNA barcodes for all invasive taxa) and created over 50 000 days of work as part of government poverty alleviation programmes. The unit has worked towards full risk assessments for 39 plant taxa and has developed <b>eradication</b> <b>plans</b> for seven species; the unit is now helping implement these plans. By focusing on science-based management and policy, we argue that SANBI ISP can play a leading role in preventing introduced species from becoming widespread invaders...|$|R

40|$|Phragmites australis is a {{perennial}} grass presently invading many intertidal and freshwater wetlands {{throughout much of}} the Atlantic Coast of North America.

Forty-five Phragmites patches were sampled in eight VA Eastern Shore mainland watersheds and on a barrier island. Regardless of watershed landcover characteristics, there was little variation in Phragmites australis patch characteristics along the oceanside of the entire Eastern Shore of Virginia.

The public concern with the animal welfare effects of methods of disease eradication that result {{in the destruction of}} large numbers of uninfected animals has initiated a reconsideration of disease eradication policy in Europe. In many recent List A disease epizootics, the financial cost of addressing animal welfare concerns in healthy animals has greatly exceeded the cost of stamping out disease in infected herds.

50|$|African Swine Fever, {{though it}} endangers neither humans nor other animals, decimates swine populations {{because it has}} neither vaccinations nor {{medications}} to stymie {{the spread of the}} fever. When AFS first made its appearance in the Dominican Republic, the Haitian government ordered the extermination of all Haitian swine on the border within a radius of 15 kilometers-100,000 pigs were slaughtered. The peasants received no compensation for the losses they suffered and the preventive measure failed to stop the disease from spreading. In late 1978 ASF spread to Haiti and the peasantry was devastated. Haiti's northern neighbors watched the spread with apprehension. Studies indicated that if African Swine Fever ever came to the United States it could wreak $150 million to $5 billion worth of damage. This fear lead the American, Canadian, and Mexican governments, through IICA, imposed a Swine Fever <b>eradication</b> <b>plan</b> on the Haitian government.

Individual-based models (IBMs) are often used to replicate the dynamics of complex systems and are both able to incorporate individual differences and local interactions among organisms, as well as spatial details. In this work, we introduce a new stochastic lattice-based model for simulating the spread of invasive termites over a landscape and compare it to a recently published stochastic individual-based approach, based on the same ecological parameters, with the goal of improving its computational efficiency. The two modeling frameworks were tested over a homogeneous landscape with randomly located sources of infestation. Further, the setting of a case-study of an invasive termite, Nasutitermes corniger (Motschulsky), was used to simulate the spread of the species in Dania Beach, Florida, U. S.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{development}} of drugs to reduce malaria transmission {{is an important}} part of malaria <b>eradication</b> <b>plans.</b> We set out to develop and validate a combination of new screening assays for prioritization of transmission-blocking molecules. METHODS: We developed high-throughput assays for screening compounds against gametocytes, the parasite stages responsible for onward transmission to mosquitoes. An existing gametocyte parasitic lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH) assay was adapted for use in 384 -well plates, and a novel homogeneous immunoassay to monitor the functional transition of female gametocytes into gametes was developed. A collection of 48 marketed and experimental antimalarials was screened and subsequently tested for impact on sporogony in Anopheles mosquitoes, to directly quantify the transmission-blocking properties of antimalarials in relation to their effects on gametocyte pLDH activity or gametogenesis. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The novel screening assays revealed distinct stage-specific kinetics and dynamics of drug effects. Peroxides showed the most potent transmission-blocking effects, with an intermediate speed of action and IC 50 values that were 20 - 40 -fold higher than the IC 50 s against the asexual stages causing clinical malaria. Finally, the novel synthetic peroxide OZ 439 appeared to be a promising drug candidate as it exerted gametocytocidal and transmission-blocking effects at clinically relevant concentrations...|$|R
