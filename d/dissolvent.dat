Formulas in DNNF are linkless, in negation nor-mal form (NNF), and have the property that atoms are not shared across conjunc-tions. Full <b>dissolvents</b> are linkless NNF formulas that do not in general have the latter property. However, many of the applications of DNNF can be obtained with full <b>dissolvents.</b> Two additional methods — regular tableaux and semantic factor-ing — are shown to produce equivalent DNNF. A class of formulae is presented on which earlier DNNF conversion techniques are necessarily exponential; path dissolution and semantic factoring handle these formulae in linear time. ...|$|R
60|$|Tenthly, {{therefore}} the dissolving {{parts of the}} Air are but few, that is, it seems {{of the nature of}} those Saline menstruums, or spirits, that have very much flegme mixt with the spirits, and therefore a small parcel of it is quickly glutted, and will dissolve no more; and therefore unless some fresh part of this menstruum be apply'd to the body to be dissolv'd, the action ceases, and the body leaves to be dissolv'd and to shine, which is the Indication of it, though plac'd or kept in the greatest heat; whereas Salt-peter is a menstruum, when melted and red-hot, that abounds more with those <b>Dissolvent</b> particles, and therefore as a small quantity of it will dissolve a great sulphureous body, so will the dissolution be very quick and violent.|$|E
60|$|It may therefore, perhaps, {{be worthy}} some Physicians enquiry, whether {{there may not}} be {{something}} mixt with the Urine in which the Gravel or Stone lies, which may again make it dissolve it, the first of which seems by it's regular Figures to have been sometimes Crystalliz'd out of it. For whether this Crystallization be made in the manner as Alum, Peter, &c. are crystallized out of a cooling liquor, in which, by boyling they have been dissolv'd; or whether it be made in the manner of Tartarum Vitriolatum, that is, by the Coalition of an acid and a Sulphureous substance, it seems not impossible, but that the liquor it lies in, may be again made a <b>dissolvent</b> of it. But leaving these inquiries to Physicians or Chymists, to whom it does more properly belong, I shall proceed.|$|E
60|$|Some {{months passed}} between leaving Eton {{and going to}} Oxford. In January 1828, Gladstone went to reside with Dr. Turner at Wilmslow in Cheshire, and {{remained}} there until Turner was made Bishop of Calcutta. The bishop's pupil afterwards testified to his amiability, refinement, and devoutness; but the days of his energy were past, and 'the religious condition of the parish was depressing.' Among the neighbouring families, with whom he made acquaintance while at Wilmslow, were the Gregs of Quarry Bank, a refined and philanthropic household, including among the sons William R. Greg (born {{in the same year}} as Mr. Gladstone), that ingenious, urbane, interesting, and independent mind, whose speculations, <b>dissolvent</b> and other, were afterwards to take an effective place in the writings of the time. 'I fear he is a unitarian,' the young churchman mentions to his father, and gives sundry reasons for that sombre apprehension; it was, indeed, only too well founded.|$|E

6000|$|What we {{desire to}} say, then, comes, in short, to this, that M. Taine has given an exaggerated {{importance}} to the literary and speculative activity of {{the last half century}} of the old monarchy. In measuring the force of the various antecedents of the Revolution, he has assigned to books and philosophical ideas a place in the scale of <b>dissolvent</b> conditions that belongs more rightly to decayed institutions, to incompetent and incorrigible castes, to economic incongruities that could only be dealt with trenchantly. Books and ideas acquired a certain importance after other things had finally broken up the crumbling system. They supplied a formula for the accomplished fact. 'It was after the Revolution had fairly begun,' as a contemporary says, 'that they sought in Mably and Rousseau for arms to sustain the system towards which the effervescence of some hardy spirits was dragging affairs. It was not the above-named authors who set people's heads aflame. M. Necker alone produced this effect, and determined the explosion.'[6] ...|$|E
60|$|Of the antecedents {{and history}} of this {{doctrine}} enough has already been said. Its general truth as a description either of what is, or {{what ought to be}} and will be, demands an ampler discussion than there is any occasion to carry on here. We need only point out its place as a kind of intermediate <b>dissolvent</b> for which the time was most ripe. It breaks up the feudal conception of political authority as a property of land-ownership, noble birth, and the like, and it associates this authority widely and simply with the bare fact of participation in any form of citizenship in the social union. The later and higher idea of every share of political power as a function to be discharged {{for the good of the}} whole body, and not merely as a right to be enjoyed for the advantage of its possessor, was a form of thought to which Rousseau did not rise. That does not lessen the effectiveness of the blow which his doctrine dealt to French feudalism, and which is its main title to commemoration in connection with his name.|$|E
6000|$|And as it {{was with}} the {{question}} of the land, so was it also with a hundred other systems and institutions and complicated and disingenuous factors in the life of man. They spoke of trade, and I realized for the first time there could be buying and selling that was no loss to any man; they spoke of industrial organization, and one saw it under captains who sought no base advantages. The haze of old associations, of personal entanglements and habitual recognitions had been dispelled from every stage and process of the social training of men. Things long hidden appeared discovered with an amazing clearness and nakedness. These men who had awakened, laughed <b>dissolvent</b> laughs, and the old muddle of schools and colleges, books and traditions, the old fumbling, half-figurative, half-formal teaching of the Churches, the complex of weakening and confusing suggestions and hints, amidst which the pride and honor of adolescence doubted and stumbled and fell, became nothing but a curious and pleasantly faded memory. [...] "There must be a common training of the young," [...] said Richover; [...] "a frank initiation. We have not so much educated them as hidden things from them, and set traps. And it might have been so easy--it can all be done so easily." ...|$|E
6000|$|A scientist, Dr. Spurrell, in {{a recent}} book, [...] "Man and his Forerunners," [...] diagnoses the growth of civilisations {{somewhat}} as follows: A civilisation begins with the enslavement by some hardy race of a tame race living a tame life in more congenial natural surroundings. It is built up on slavery, and attains its maximum vitality in conditions little removed therefrom. Then, as individual freedom gradually grows, disorganisation sets in and the civilisation slowly dissolves away in anarchy. Dr. Spurrell does not dogmatise about our present civilisation, but suggests that it will probably follow the civilisations of the past into dissolution. I am not convinced of that, because of certain factors new {{to the history of}} man. Recent discoveries are unifying the world; such old isolated swoops of race on race are not now possible. In our great industrial States, it is true, a new form of slavery has arisen, but not of man by man, rather of man by machines. Moreover, all past civilisations have been more or less Southern, and subject to the sapping influence of the sun. Modern civilisation is essentially Northern. The individualism, however, which, according to Dr. Spurrell, dissolved the Empires of the past, exists already, in a marked degree, in every modern State; and the problem before us is to discover how democracy and liberty of the subject can be made into enduring props rather than <b>dissolvents.</b> It is the problem of making democracy genuine. And certainly, if that cannot be achieved and perpetuated, there is nothing to prevent democracy drifting into anarchism and dissolving modern States, till they are the prey of pouncing dictators, or of States not so far gone in dissolution. What, for instance, will happen to Russia if she does not succeed in making her democracy genuine? A Russia which remains anarchic must very quickly become the prey of her neighbours on West and East.|$|R
60|$|In {{politics}} Mrs. Austin was {{a philosophical}} Tory. Radicalism she detested, {{and she and}} most of her friends seem to have regarded it as moribund. 'The Radical party is evidently effete,' she writes to M. Victor Cousin; the probable 'leader of the Tory party' is Mr. Gladstone. 'The people must be instructed, must be guided, must be, in short, governed,' she writes elsewhere; and {{in a letter to}} Dr. Whewell, she says that the state of things in France fills 'me with the deepest anxiety on one point,--the point on which the permanency of our institutions and our salvation as a nation turn. Are our higher classes able to keep the lead of the rest? If they are, we are safe; if not, I agree with my poor dear Charles Buller--our turn must come. Now Cambridge and Oxford must really look to this.' The belief {{in the power of the}} Universities to stem the current of democracy is charming. She grew to regard Carlyle as 'one of the <b>dissolvents</b> of the age--as mischievous as his extravagances will let him be'; speaks of Kingsley and Maurice as 'pernicious'; and talks of John Stuart Mill as a 'demagogue.' She was no doctrinaire. 'One ounce of education demanded is worth a pound imposed. It is no use to give the meat before you give the hunger.' She was delighted at a letter of St. Hilaire's, in which he said, 'We have a system and no results; you have results and no system.' Yet she had a deep sympathy with the wants of the people. She was horrified at something Babbage told her of the population of some of the manufacturing towns who are worked out before they attain to thirty years of age. 'But I am persuaded that the remedy will not, cannot come from the people,' she adds. Many of her letters are concerned with the question of the higher education of women. She discusses Buckle's lecture on 'The Influence of Women upon the Progress of Knowledge,' admits to M. Guizot that women's intellectual life is largely coloured by the emotions, but adds: 'One is not precisely a fool because one's opinions are greatly influenced by one's affections. The opinions of men are often influenced by worse things.' Dr. Whewell consults her about lecturing women on Plato, being slightly afraid lest people should think it ridiculous; Comte writes her elaborate letters on the relation of women to progress; and Mr. Gladstone promises that Mrs. Gladstone will carry out at Hawarden the suggestions contained in one of her pamphlets. She was always very practical, and never lost her admiration for plain sewing.|$|R
60|$|This was no farce, such as Voltaire played now {{and again}} {{at the expense of}} an unhappy bishop or unhappier parish priest; nor such as Rousseau himself had played six-and-twenty years before, at the expense of those honest Catholics of Turin whose helpful {{donation}} of twenty francs had marked their enthusiasm over a soul that had been lost and was found again. He was never a Catholic, any more than he was ever an atheist, and if it might be said in one sense that he was no more a Protestant than he was either of these two, yet he was emphatically the child of Protestantism. It is hardly too much to say that one bred in Catholic tradition and observance, accustomed to think of the whole life of men as only a manifestation of the unbroken life of the Church, and of all the several communities of men as members of that great organisation which binds one order to another, and each generation to those that have gone before and those that come after, would never have dreamed that monstrous dream of a state of nature as a state of perfection. He would never have held up to ridicule and hate the idea of society as an organism with normal parts and conditions of growth, and never have left the spirit of man standing in bald isolation from history, from his fellows, from a Church, from a mediator, {{face to face with the}} great vague phantasm. Nor, on the other hand, is it likely that one born and reared in the religious school of authority with its elaborately disciplined hierarchy, would have conceived that passion for political freedom, that zeal for the rights of peoples against rulers, that energetic enthusiasm for a free life, which constituted the fire and essence of Rousseau's writing. As illustration of this, let us remark how Rousseau's teaching fared when it fell upon a Catholic country like France: so many of its principles were assimilated by the revolutionary schools as were wanted for violent <b>dissolvents,</b> while the rest dropped away, and in this rejected portion was precisely the most vital part of his system. In other words, in no country has the power of collective organisation been so pressed and exalted as in revolutionised France, and in no country has the free life of the individual been made to count for so little. With such force does the ancient system of temporal and spiritual organisation reign in the minds of those who think most confidently that they have cast it wholly out of them. The use of reason may lead a man far, but it is the past that has cut the groove.|$|R
60|$|Therefore twelfthly, {{it seems}} {{reasonable}} to think {{that there is no such}} thing as an Element of Fire that should attract or draw up the flame, or towards which the flame should endeavour to ascend out of a desire or appetite of uniting with that as its Homogeneal primitive and generating Element; but that that shining transient body which we call Flame, is nothing else but a mixture of Air, and volatil sulphureous parts of dissoluble or combustible bodies, which are acting upon each other whilst they ascend, that is, flame seems to be a mixture of Air, and the combustible volatil parts of any body, which parts the encompassing Air does dissolve or work upon, which action, as it does intend the heat of the aerial parts of the <b>dissolvent,</b> so does it thereby further rarifie those parts that are acting, or that are very neer them, whereby they growing much lighter then the heavie parts of that menstruum that are more remote, are thereby protruded and driven upward; and this may be easily observ'd also in dissolution made by any other menstruum, especially such as either create heat or bubbles. Now, this action of the menstruum, or Air, on the dissoluble parts, is made with such violence, or is such, that it imparts such a motion or pulse to the diaphanous parts of the Air, as I have elsewhere shewn is requisite to produce light.|$|E
60|$|Now, {{because the}} {{spurious}} pulses which cause a Red and a Blue, do the one follow the clear pulse, {{and the other}} precede it, it usually follows, that those Saline refracting bodies which do dilute the colour of the one, do deepen that of the other. And this will be made manifest by almost all kinds of Purples, and many sorts of Greens, both these colours consisting of mixt colours; for if we suppose A and A in the ninth Figure, to represent two pulses of clear light, which follow each other at a convenient distance, AA, {{each of which has}} a spurious pulse preceding it, as BB, which makes a Blue, and another following it, as CC, which makes a Red, the one caus'd by tinging particles that have a greater refraction, the other by others that have a less refracting quality then the liquor or Menstruum in which these are dissolv'd, whatsoever liquor does so alter the refraction of the one, without altering that of {{the other part of the}} ting'd liquor, must needs very much alter the colour of the liquor; for if the refraction of the <b>dissolvent</b> be increas'd, and the refraction of the tinging particles not altered, then will the preceding spurious pulse be shortned or stopt, and not out-run the clear pulse so much; so that BB will become EE, and the Blue be diluted, whereas the other spurious pulse which follows will be made to lagg much more, and be further behind AA than before, and CC will become ff, and so the Yellow or Red will be heightned.|$|E
60|$|This is no imaginative {{comparison}} of mine. To my mind radio-activity {{is a real}} disease of matter. Moreover, it is a contagious disease. It spreads. You bring those debased and crumbling atoms near others and those too presently catch the trick of swinging themselves out of coherent existence. It is in matter exactly what the decay of our old culture is in society, a loss of traditions and distinctions and assured reactions. When I think of these inexplicable <b>dissolvent</b> centres that have come into being in our globe--these quap heaps are surely {{by far the largest}} that have yet been found in the world; the rest as yet mere specks in grains and crystals--I am haunted by a grotesque fancy of the ultimate eating away and dry-rotting and dispersal of all our world. So that while man still struggles and dreams his very substance will change and crumble from beneath him. I mention this here as a queer persistent fancy. Suppose, indeed, that is {{to be the end of}} our planet; no splendid climax and finale, no towering accumulation of achievements, but just--atomic decay! I add that to the ideas of the suffocating comet, the dark body out of space, the burning out of the sun, the distorted orbit, as a new and far more possible end--as Science can see ends--to this strange by-play of matter that we call human life. I do not believe this can be the end; no human soul can believe in such an end and go on living, but to it science points as a possible thing, science and reason alike. If single human beings--if one single ricketty infant--can be born as it were by accident and die futile, why not the whole race? These are questions I have never answered, that now I never attempt to answer, but the thought of quap and its mysteries brings them back to me.|$|E
40|$|Ionic liquids (ILs) are {{a fairly}} new and very {{promising}} group of compounds. They are often considered as environmentally benign substitutes for traditional volatile organic solvents {{due to their}} attractive properties and physicochemical characteristics (e. g. non-volatility, high thermal stability and very good and versatile solving capacity). The ILs are salts composed entirely of ions (cations and anions) with a melting point below 100 °C and they are liquid {{in a wide range}} of temperatures. The ILs are usually described as "green", but they are chemical products, and as such have to fulfill the requirements of the European Community regulation on chemicals and their safe use called Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and Restriction of Chemical Substances (REACH). Due to their immeasurably low vapor pressure ILs cannot be found in the atmosphere, but their water solubility is often high and they are stable, so they can end up in industrial and laboratory effluents and consequently cause water and soil contamination. The analyzed ILs include representatives of a new family of protic ionic liquids (PILs) derived from mono-, di- and triethanolamine and aliphatic organic acids, and some of the most frequently used imidazolium and pyridinium based aprotic ionic liquids (AILs). In order to evaluate the environmental impact of these ILs, various (eco) toxicity tests were performed. The aquatic ecotoxicity tests included target organisms: marine bacteria Vibrio fischeri, green algae Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata and aquatic plant Lemna minor. The terrestrial ecotoxicity tests evaluated the toxic effects on terrestrial plants (onion Allium cepa, grass Lolium perenne and radish Raphanus sativus) and soil microorganisms involved in carbon and nitrogen transformation. Two additional test systems with an enzyme (acetylcholinesterase inhibition) and isolated leukemia rat cells IPC- 81 (cytotoxicity) were performed in order to provide a more in-depth evaluation of toxicity. Ready biodegradability in water and soil was also studied. The number of combinations of cations and anions forming ionic liquids is practically infinite, so they can be custom designed in order to suite the desired application. But the complete information on their environmental impact is still not available. The quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) modelling can allow reliable prediction of toxicity and it helps to avoid unnecessary animal experiments, which is why the use of in silico models and QSAR is strongly encouraged by European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) and REACH. As it is clearly impossible to analyze the toxicity of so many compounds, the application of QSAR models could speed up the process of ecotoxicological evaluation and indicate the potential toxicity of new ILs before they are considered for commercialization. In this thesis, a group contribution QSAR model was used in order to predict the (eco) toxicity of eight previously untested PILs that belong to the new family. The prediction was made for five (eco) toxicity tests (Microtox®, Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata and Lemna minor growth inhibition test, and Acetylcholinestherase inhibition and Cell viability assay with IPC- 81 cells). The PILs proved to be non-toxic in most of the performed tests. The EC 50 values for AILs are up to several orders of magnitude lower than the ones for the PILs and they show much lower biodegradation potential. The most toxic ILs are the most complex ones in both of the analyzed groups. The findings of the thesis indicate that the PILs with simpler and lineal structure can be considered as environmentally safer than the AILs predominately used up to date, which have bulky organic anions with long alkyl chain substituents. Els líquids iònics (ILs) són un grup de compostos bastant nou i molt prometedor. Sovint són considerats com a substituts ambientalment benignes de <b>dissolvents</b> orgànics volàtils tradicionals a causa de les seves propietats fisicoquímiques atractives. Encara que els ILs tenen un perfil potencialment "verd", són bàsicament productes químics, i com a tal, han de complir amb els requisits de la legislació vigent sobre productes químics de la Unió Europea anomenada Registre, Avaluació, Autorització i Restricció de Substàncies Químiques (REACH). La informació completa sobre l’impacte ambiental d’ILs encara no està disponible. Els líquids iònics analitzats inclouen representants d'una nova família de líquids iònics pròtics (PILs) derivats de mono-, di- i trietanolamina i àcids orgànics alifàtics, i alguns representants freqüentment utilitzats de la família de líquids iònics apròtics (AILs), derivats de l’imidazoli i del piridini. Per tal de determinar l'impacte mediambiental es van realitzar els assaigs d'ecotoxicitat aquàtica (amb Vibrio fischeri, Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata i Lemna minor) i terrestre (amb Allium cepa, Lolium perenne i Raphanus sativus, i amb els microorganismes del sòl participants en els cicles de carboni i nitrogen). Per obtenir una avaluació més detallada de la toxicitat, es van realitzar dues proves de toxicitat addicionals: inhibició de l'acetilcolinesterasa i citotoxicitat. La biodegradabilitat en aigua i sòl es va determinar també. Es va utilitzar un model de relació estructura-activitat quantitativa (QSAR) de contribució de grups per predir l’(eco) toxicitat dels PILs de la nova família que no s’havien analitzat prèviament. Els PILs van resultar ser no tòxics en la majoria de les proves realitzades. Els AILs analitzats van ser més tòxics que els PILs, amb valors de CE 50 diversos ordres de magnitud inferiors i van manifestar un baix potencial de biodegradabilitat. Els ILs amb l’estructura més complexa van ser els més tòxics en ambdós grups analitzats. Els resultats d'aquesta tesi indiquen que els ILs amb estructura més simple i lineal poden ser considerats com a més segurs per al medi ambient que els habitualment utilitzats fins ara, que contenen cations més voluminosos i substituents de cadena alquílica llarga...|$|R
60|$|Although it was Mr. Atkinson {{who finally}} {{provided}} {{her with a}} positive substitute for her older beliefs, yet a journey which Miss Martineau made in the East shortly after her restoration to health (1846) had done much to build up in her mind a historic conception of the origin and order of the great faiths of mankind--the Christian, the Hebrew, the Mahometan, the old Egyptian. We need not say more on this subject. The work in which she published {{the experiences of the}} journey which was always so memorable to her, deserves a word. There are few more delightful books of travel than Eastern Life, Past and Present. The descriptions are admirably graphic, and they have the attraction of making their effect by a few direct strokes, without any of the wordy elaboration of our modern picturesque. The writer shows a true feeling for nature, and she shows a vigorous sense, which is not merely pretty sentiment, like Chateaubriand's, for the vast historic associations of those old lands and dim cradles of the race. All is sterling and real; we are aware that the elevated reflection and the meditative stroke are not due to mere composition, but did actually pass through her mind as the suggestive wonders passed before her eyes. And hence there is no jar as we find a little homily on the advantage of being able to iron your own linen on a Nile boat, followed by a lofty page on the mighty pair of solemn figures that gaze as from eternity on time amid the sand at Thebes. The whole, one may say again, is sterling and real, both the elevation and the homeliness. The student of the history of opinion may find some interest in comparing Miss Martineau's work with the famous book, Ruins; or, Meditations on the Revolutions of Empires, in which Volney, between fifty and sixty years before, had drawn equally <b>dissolvent</b> conclusions with her own from the same panorama of the dead ages. Perhaps Miss Martineau's history is not much better than Volney's, but her brisk sense is preferable to Volney's high à priori declamation and artificial rhetoric.|$|E
60|$|For {{during these}} years Mr. Greg did not handle merely the {{abstract}} principles of politics and sociology. A very scanty livelihood would have come by that way. He discussed the men, measures, and events of the day; and most of what strikes one as unsatisfactory in the discussion is probably due to a want of that close observation of facts which was hardly possible to a student {{on the shores of}} Windermere. On the other hand, it is still more certain that it was in these meditative scenes that the germs were ripened of those grave, ingenious, and affecting speculations which afterwards came to their full growth in the Enigmas of Life--to most of us by so much the most interesting of all its author's performances. His note-book shows that the thoughts that are suggested in this short but important volume were springing up in his mind for years, and that it touches the problems that were most constantly present to him in his best moments. It was during his residence at Windermere that he worked out and published (1851) his memorable book on the Creed of Christendom. It is enough here to remind ourselves how serious a place is held by that work in the <b>dissolvent</b> literature of the generation. The present writer was at Oxford {{in the last three years}} of the decade in which it appeared, and can well recall the share that it had, along with Mansel's Bampton Lectures and other books on both sides, in shaking the fabric of early beliefs in some of the most active minds then in the University. The landmarks have so shifted within the last twenty years that the Creed of Christendom is now comparatively orthodox. But in those days it was a remarkable proof of intellectual courage and independence to venture on introducing to the English public the best results of German theological criticism, with fresh applications from an original mind. Since then the floods have broken loose. One may add that Mr. Greg's speculations show, as Hume and smaller men than Hume had shown before, how easily scepticism in theology allies itself with the fastidious and aristocratic sentiment in politics.|$|E

Its hardihood, its very license, its contempt of conventions, its presentation of common people and coarse passions and rough lives, all made it a <b>dissolvent</b> of the thin, dry, and frigid rules which tyrannised over the world, and interposed between the artist or the thinker and the real existence of man on the earth. When we think of what European literature was, it ceases to be wonderful that Goethe should have been unable for six whole hours to tear himself away from a book that so few men to-day, save under some compulsion, could persuade themselves to read through. On great wholesome minds the grossness left no stain, and the interest of Diderot's singularities worked as a stimulus to a happier originality in men of more disciplined endowments. And let us add, of more poetic endowments. It is the lack of poetry in Jacques that makes its irony so heavy to us. We only willingly suffer those to take us down into the depths who can also raise us on the wings of a beautiful fancy. Even Rabelais has his poetic moments, as in the picture of Cupid self-disarmed before the industrious serenity of the Muses. A single lovely image, like Sterne's figure of the recording angel, reconciles us to many a miry page. But in Jacques le Fataliste, Diderot never raises his eye for an instant to the blue æther, his ear catches no harmony of awe, of hope, nor even of a noble despair. With a kind of clumsy jubilancy he holds us fast in the ways and language of thick and clogged sense. The fatrasie of old France has its place in literature, but it can never be restored in ages when a host of moral anxieties have laid siege to men's souls. The uncommon is always welcome to the lover of art, but it must justify itself. Jacques has the quality of the uncommon; it is a curiously prepared dish, as Goethe said; but it lacks the pinch of salt and the handful of herbs with sharp diffusive flavour.|$|E
60|$|She {{had told}} him before they started {{that they should be}} early; she wished to see Miss Birdseye alone, before the arrival of any one else. This was just for the {{pleasure}} of seeing her--it was an opportunity; she was always so taken up with others. She received Miss Chancellor in the hall of the mansion, which had a salient front, an enormous and very high number--756--painted in gilt on the glass light above the door, a tin sign bearing the name of a doctress (Mary J. Prance) suspended from one of the windows of the basement, and a peculiar look of being both new and faded--a kind of modern fatigue--like certain articles of commerce which are sold at a reduction as shop-worn. The hall was very narrow; a considerable part of it was occupied by a large hat-tree, from which several coats and shawls already depended; the rest offered space for certain lateral demonstrations on Miss Birdseye's part. She sidled about her visitors, and at last went round to open for them a door of further admission, which happened to be locked inside. She was a little old lady, with an enormous head; that was the first thing Ransom noticed--the vast, fair, protuberant, candid, ungarnished brow, surmounting a pair of weak, kind, tired-looking eyes, and ineffectually balanced in the rear by a cap which had the air of falling backward, and which Miss Birdseye suddenly felt for while she talked, with unsuccessful irrelevant movements. She had a sad, soft, pale face, which (and it was the effect of her whole head) {{looked as if it had}} been soaked, blurred, and made vague by exposure to some slow <b>dissolvent.</b> The long practice of philanthropy had not given accent to her features; it had rubbed out their transitions, their meanings. The waves of sympathy, of enthusiasm, had wrought upon them in the same way in which the waves of time finally modify the surface of old marble busts, gradually washing away their sharpness, their details. In her large countenance her dim little smile scarcely showed. It was a mere sketch of a smile, a kind of instalment, or payment on account; it seemed to say that she would smile more if she had time, but that you could see, without this, that she was gentle and easy to beguile.|$|E
6000|$|The {{moral of}} all this is the tolerably obvious truth, that the {{prosperity}} of an abstract idea depends as much on the medium into which it is launched, as upon any quality of its own. Stable societies are amply furnished with force enough to resist all effort in a destructive direction. There is seldom much fear, and in our own country there is hardly any fear at all, of hasty reformers making too much way against the spontaneous conservatism which belongs to a healthy and well-organised community. If <b>dissolvent</b> ideas do make their way, it is because the society was already ripe for dissolution. New ideas, however ardently preached, will dissolve no society which was not already in a condition of profound disorganisation. We may be allowed just to point to two memorable instances, by way of illustration, though a long and elaborate discussion would be needed to bring out their full force. It has often been thought since, as it was thought by timorous reactionaries at the time, that Christianity in various ways sapped the strength of the Roman Empire, and opened the way for the barbarians. In truth, the most careful and competent students know now that the Empire slowly fell to pieces, partly because the political arrangements were vicious and inadequate, but mainly because the fiscal and economic system impoverished and depopulated one district of the vast empire after another. It was the break-up of the Empire that gave the Church its chance; not the Church that broke up the Empire. It is a mistake of the same kind to suppose that the destructive criticism of the French philosophers a hundred years ago was the great operative cause of the catastrophe which befel the old social régime. If Voltaire, Diderot, Rousseau, had never lived, or if their works had all been suppressed {{as soon as they were}} printed, their absence would have given no new life to agriculture, would not have stimulated trade, nor replenished the bankrupt fisc, nor incorporated the privileged classes with the bulk of the nation, nor done anything else to repair an organisation of which every single part had become incompetent for its proper function. It was the material misery and the political despair engendered by the reigning system, which brought willing listeners to the feet of the teachers who framed beneficent governments on the simple principles of reason and the natural law. And these teachers only busied themselves with abstract politics, because the real situation was desperate. They had no alternative but to evolve social improvements out of their own consciousness. There was not a single sound organ in the body politic, which they could have made the starting-point of a reconstitution of a society on the base of its actual or historic structure. The mischiefs which resulted from their method are patent and undeniable. But the method was made inevitable by the curse of the old régime.[34] ...|$|E
6000|$|Johnson, however, is {{the only}} member of that illustrious company who can profitably be {{compared}} with Burke in strength and impressiveness of personality, in a large sensibility at once serious and genial, in brooding care for all the fulness of human life. This striking pair were the two complements of a single noble and solid type, holding tenaciously, in a century of <b>dissolvent</b> speculation, to the best ideas of a society that was slowly passing. They were powerless to hinder the inevitable transformation. One of them did not even dimly foresee it. But both of them help us to understand how manliness and reverence, strength and tenderness, love of truth and pity for man, all flourished under old institutions and old ways of thinking, into which the forces of the time were even then silently breathing a new spirit. The friendship between Burke and Johnson lasted as long as they lived; and if we remember that Johnson was a strong Tory, and declared that the first Whig was the devil, and habitually talked about cursed Whigs and bottomless Whigs, it is an extraordinary fact that his relations with the greatest Whig writer and politician of his day were marked by a cordiality, respect, and admiration that never varied nor wavered. [...] "Burke," [...] he said in a well-known passage, [...] "is such a man that if you met {{him for the first time}} in the street, where you were stopped by a drove of oxen, and you and he stepped aside to take shelter but for five minutes, he'd talk to you in such a manner that, when you parted, you would say, This is an extraordinary man. He is never what we would call humdrum; never unwilling to begin to talk, nor in haste to leave off." [...] That Burke was as good a listener as he was a talker, Johnson never would allow. [...] "So desirous is he to talk," [...] he said, [...] "that if one is talking at this end of the table, he'll talk to somebody at the other end." [...] Johnson was far too good a critic, and too honest a man, to assent to a remark of Robertson's, that Burke had wit. [...] "No, sir," [...] said the sage, most truly, [...] "he never succeeds there. 'Tis low, 'tis conceit." [...] Wit apart, he described Burke as the only man whose common conversation corresponded to his general fame in the world; take up whatever topic you might please, he was ready to meet you. When Burke found a seat in Parliament, Johnson said, [...] "Now we who know Burke, know that he will be one of the first men in the country." [...] He did not grudge that Burke should be the first man in the House of Commons, for Burke, he said, was always the first man everywhere. Once when he was ill, somebody mentioned Burke's name. Johnson cried out, [...] "That fellow calls forth all my powers; were I to see Burke now it would kill me." ...|$|E
6000|$|In re-embracing the Protestant confession, therefore, Rousseau was {{not leaving}} Catholicism, {{to which he}} had never really passed over; he was only {{undergoing}} in entire gravity of spirit a formality which reconciled him with his native city, and reunited those strands of spiritual connection with it which had never been more than superficially parted. There {{can be little doubt that}} the four months which he spent in Geneva in 1754 marked a very critical time in the formation of some of the most memorable of his opinions. He came from Paris full of inarticulate and smouldering resentment against the irreverence and denial of the materialistic circle which used to meet at the house of D'Holbach. What sort of opinions he found prevailing among the most enlightened of the Genevese pastors we know from an abundance of sources. D'Alembert had three or four years later than this to suffer a bitter attack from them, but the account of the creed of some of the ministers which he gave in his article on Geneva in the Encyclopedia, was substantially correct. [...] "Many of them," [...] he wrote, [...] "have ceased to believe in the divinity of Jesus Christ. Hell, one of the principal points in our belief, is no longer one with many of the Genevese pastors, who contend that it is an insult to the Divinity to imagine that a being full of goodness and justice can be capable of punishing our faults by an eternity of torment. In a word, they have no other creed than pure Socinianism, rejecting everything that they call mysteries, and supposing the first principle of a true religion to be that it shall propose nothing for belief which clashes with reason. Religion here is almost reduced to the adoration of one single God, at least among nearly all who do not belong to the common people; and a certain respect for Jesus Christ and the Scriptures is nearly the only thing that distinguishes the Christianity of Geneva from pure Deism."[240] And it would be easy to trace the growth of these rationalising tendencies. Throughout the seventeenth century men sprang up who anticipated some of the rationalistic arguments of the eighteenth, in denying the Trinity, and so forth,[241] but the time was not then ripe. The general conditions grew more favourable. Burnet, who was at Geneva in 1685-6, says that though there were not many among the Genevese of the first form of learning, [...] "yet almost everybody here has a good tincture of a learned education."[242] The pacification of civic troubles in 1738 was followed by a quarter of a century of extreme prosperity and contentment, and it is in such periods that the minds of men previously trained are wont to turn to the great matters of speculation. There was at all times a constant communication, both public and private, going on between Geneva and Holland, as was only natural between the two chief Protestant centres of the Continent. The controversy of the seventeenth century between the two churches was as keenly followed in Geneva as at Leyden, and there is more than one Genevese writer who deserves a place in the history of the transition in the beginning of the eighteenth century from theology proper to that metaphysical theology, which was the first marked <b>dissolvent</b> of dogma within the Protestant bodies. To this general movement of the epoch, of course, Descartes supplied the first impulse. The leader of the movement in Geneva, that is of an attempt to pacify the Christian churches on the basis of some such Deism as was shortly to find its passionate expression in the Savoyard Vicar's Confession of Faith, was John Alphonse Turretini (1661-1737). He belonged to a family of Italian refugees from Lucca, and his grandfather had been sent on a mission to Holland for aid in defence of Geneva against Catholic Savoy. He went on his travels in 1692; he visited Holland, where he saw Bayle, and England, where he saw Newton, and France, where he saw Bossuet. Chouet initiated him into the mysteries of Descartes. All this bore fruit when he returned home, and his eloquent exposition of rationalistic ideas aroused the usual cry of heresy from the people who justly insist that Deism is not Christianity. There was much stir for many years, but he succeeded in holding his own and in finding many considerable followers.[243] For example, some three years or so after his death, a work appeared in Geneva under the title of La Religion Essentielle a l'Homme, showing that faith in the existence of a God suffices, and treating with contempt the belief in the inspiration of the Gospels.[244] ...|$|E
