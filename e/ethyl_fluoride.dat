40|$|A {{valence bond}} self-consistent field (VBSCF) {{calculation}} {{has been carried}} out on the bimolecular elimination (E 2) reaction of fluoride ion with <b>ethyl</b> <b>fluoride.</b> The transition state was first optimized at HF/ 6 - 31 +G and the resulting orbitals were used in the VBSCF calculation. A transition-state hybrid consisting of four structures (F-H-CH, CH 2 -F. F-HCH 2 =CH 2 F-, F-H-CH 2 -CH 2 -F, and F-H-CH 2 -CH 2 +F-) failed to give a reasonable energy. Incorporation of four charge-separated structures (F-H+CH 2 -CH 2 -F, F-H+-CH 2 -CH 2 +F-, F-H+CH 2 =CH 2 F-, and F-H-CH 2 -CH 2 +F-) for a total of eight resulted in an energy slightly below Hartree-Fock. A full-space VBSCF calculation utilizing 50 structures showed that the eight Structures give a sufficiently accurate wave function. The transition state is dominated by charge-separated structures, leading to a greater degree of charge separation than in either the reactant or product Complex. Therefore, the transition state does not evolve synchronously from the reactants, and explicit allowance Should be made for this fact when applying descriptions of the reaction path, Such as that in the More O'Ferrall - Jencks diagram...|$|E
40|$|Various {{conditions}} of storage {{have been tested}} for stability of ethyl acetate in whole blood. Ethyl acetate (5 μg/ml) was spiked to whole blood, and kept at room temperature or at 4 ℃ for various intervals in {{the presence or absence}} of sodium <b>fluoride.</b> <b>Ethyl</b> acetate and ethanol were simultaneously measured by our cryogenic oven trapping gas chromatography. Ethyl acetate was found stable at room temperature for 3 days in the presence of 10 mg sodium azide and 50 mg sodium fluoride in 1 ml whole blood. The compound was also very stable at 4 ℃ for at least 14 days under the same additive conditions. Without sodium <b>fluoride,</b> <b>ethyl</b> acetate was readily decomposed. Ethanol could not be used as an indicator of the preexistence of ethyl acetate in whole blood. Our informations on stability of ethyl acetate seem essential for accurate determination of the compound in blood. rights:日本法中毒学会rights:本文データは日本法中毒学会の許諾のもと掲載しています...|$|R
40|$|The TEMPO {{derivative}} 4 -thienylacetyl-oxy- 2, 2, 6, 6 -tetramethylpiperidin- 1 -yloxy (ThAcOTEMPO) is synthesized and its polymer (p-ThAcOTEMPO) is successfully prepared on Pt electrode in boron <b>fluoride</b> <b>ethyl</b> ether by electrochemical polymerization. The electrocatalytic {{performance of}} p-ThAcOTEMPO for oxidation of benzyl alcohol in CH 3 CN solution {{has been investigated}} by cyclic voltammetry and in situ FTIR. p-ThAcOTEMPO exhibits perfect electrocatalytic activity for oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde {{in the presence of}} 2, 6 -lutidine as the base. The oxidation mechanism of benzyl alcohol on p-ThAcOTEMPO is analyzed...|$|R
