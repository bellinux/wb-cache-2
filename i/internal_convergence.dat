40|$|The aim of {{this chapter}} is to assess the redistributive effect of the post- 2013 CAP {{decoupled}} payments (including redistributive payment, capping and greening) across EU farms, regions and MS using harmonized EU-wide micro-economic data (FADN). Results show that, due to the external convergence of the CAP, {{most of the new}} MS would gain from the post- 2013 CAP (compared to the 2012 payments); while former MS would experience a decline in their decoupled payments.

30|$|Furthermore, the {{allocation}} of national resources across the seven components of direct payments was as follows: the BPS received 58 % of resources, greening payment (GR) received 30 % of the budget (as established by Reg. 1307 / 2013), the young farmer payments (YFPs) received 1 % of national funds, the voluntary coupled support (VCS) received 11 % of funding, and the small farmers scheme (SFS) was activated. It {{must be noted that}} even though the GR refers to environmental concerns, the value of this payment in Italy depends on the value of the BPS (due to the application of the tunnel model of <b>internal</b> <b>convergence,</b> i.e., partial convergence of entitlement values). Therefore, since this aid varies based on the value of the entitlements associated with the land, its redistributive effect on farm income must be properly considered.

It is a fundamental mission in the field of visual target recognition. In general, there are two critical aspects of a {{template matching}} scheme. One is similarity measurement and the other is best-match location search. In this work, we choose the well-known normalized cross correlation model as a similarity criterion. The searching procedure for the best-match location is carried out through an internal-feedback artificial bee colony (IF-ABC) algorithm. IF-ABC algorithm is highlighted by its effort to fight against premature convergence. This purpose is achieved through discarding the conventional roulette selection procedure in the ABC algorithm so as to provide each employed bee an equal chance to be followed by the onlooker bees in the local search phase. Besides that, we also suggest efficiently utilizing the <b>internal</b> <b>convergence</b> states as feedback guidance for searching intensity in the subsequent cycles of iteration.

Both partial internal line supports and complex internal supports are considered for 21 square plates of various combinations of edge support conditions. The eects of dierent size, shape and topology of the internal supports and dierent boundary conditions on the vibration response of plates are investigated. The partial internal line supports may vary from a central point support to a full range of cross or diagonal line supports. Several closed-loop supports, such as ring, square and rhombus, and their combinations are studied for complex <b>internal</b> supports. <b>Convergence</b> and comparison studies are carried out to establish the correctness and accuracy of the DSC algorithm.

30|$|With {{respect to}} H 1 (the {{application}} of CAP 2013 reform in Italy causes {{a decrease in}} the unequal concentration of DPs), the decomposition of G shows that the new direct payment scheme in Italy decreases the concentration of DPs and leads to a more equal redistribution of DPs in 2019 (although this effect is still not evident in 2015). In particular, this effect is due to the implementation of the tunnel model for <b>internal</b> <b>convergence,</b> which bridges the gap in the value of entitlements across Italian farms and makes them progressively less dependent on the rank of farm income. According to Severini and Tantari (2013 b), any change in the distribution of DPs among farms could bring about a change in farm income concentration. This situation clearly holds for area redistribution and coupled payments generated by shifting from the individual farm-based (i.e., historical) model to the national flat rate model of direct aid implementation. It follows that the flat rate allows a redistribution of DPs that indeed penalizes sectors that have a high farm income but are largely dependent on DPs (a high DP/FI ratio), whereas it increases the share of direct aid for sectors that traditionally do not benefit from such support (vineyards, fruits, and vegetables) and for low-income sectors that are located in disadvantaged areas (livestock and grazing).|$|E
30|$|However, {{the main}} focus of this paper was the redistributive effect of the new direct payment scheme {{introduced}} by the CAP 2013 reform that replaced the former SPS in Italy, where approximately 90 % of the national ceiling was devoted to the BPS and the GR. Both static and dynamic analyses highlighted an expected decrease in the concentration of direct payments by 2019 because Italy will progressively shift from the “historical” regional model to a tunnel model for <b>internal</b> <b>convergence</b> during the transitional 2015 – 2020 period. Conversely, the decrease in the DP/FI ratio between 2014 and 2019 due to both policy changes and exogenous factors is expected to negatively affect the ability of these payments to oppose the regressive effect of MIs, particularly for regions and sectors that mainly benefitted from the SPS introduced by CAP 2003 reform. In more detail, the results indirectly highlight that the more farm income is affected by changing market conditions (increasingly influenced by price volatility) related to output composition (consumption, investment, government expenditure, and gross exports and imports), the more unequally it is distributed. This phenomenon is affected by any increase (decrease) in the budget for DPs, which could improve (worsen) the stabilization and redistribution of farm income and reduce (increase) its concentration since such aid tends to equalize farm income.|$|E

The approach is applied to estimate the extraction effects on the river and related aquifers under different conditions, {{with the purpose of}} determining the water supply potential and sustainability of the coupled system. The model consists of the conceptual and numerical coupling of two structures that take into account different aspects of the systems being considered. The fi rst is a free-surface fl ow structure, and it carries out the balance of mass and momen-tum along the river course, whereas the second one is of hydrogeological type that performs the mass balance in combination with Darcy’s law in each aquifer of interest for evaluation purposes. The two parts of the model are coupled by their source terms with a very simple linear relationship; the numerical implementation is carried out by using MODFLOW and ISIS codes. After calibrating the models with fi eld parameters, an iterative coupling process is given where each structure must satisfy their criteria of <b>internal</b> <b>convergence.</b> The complete model is satisfactory whenever the iterative coupling process and the hydrogeological and hydraulic models converge.

40|$|Internal {{gravity waves}} in the oceans are a limited scale process capable of {{providing}} sufficient energy to activate strong diapycnal mixing near sloping bathymetry. This can account for {{a significant portion of}} oceanic vertical mixing. Mixing can be locally intense, transporting colder nutrient-rich bottom water up onto continental margins with implications for coastal marine ecosystems and the carbon cycle. Modelling internal waves is particularly challenging. The strong vertical accelerations present in the overturning and breaking of internal waves necessitates a non-hydrostatic model, and the small-scale processes that result from the interaction of internal waves with bathymetry mean that traditional structured mesh models require high-resolution to adequately capture flow complexity. I present two-dimensional results of numerical simulations of internal waves being generated and interacting with idealised bathymetry, using the Imperial College Ocean Model (Fluidity-ICOM), a non-hydrostatic, finite-element, unstructured mesh model incorporating anisotropic mesh adaptivity. The unstructured nature of Fluidity-ICOM allows the mesh to be optimised to represent complex bathymetries, as well as capturing the vertically inhomogeneous structure of <b>internal</b> waves. <b>Convergence</b> of the model to analytical results has been demonstrated by modelling internal wave propagation in a linearly stratified fluid.

40|$|Decoupled direct {{payments}} {{were introduced in}} the European Union (EU) by the 2003 CAP reform in form of the Single Payment Scheme (SPS) and the Single Area Payment System (SAPS). The 2013 CAP reform changed both the implementation of decoupled payments {{as well as its}} budget. We assess the possible effects of the 2013 CAP reform on the capitalization of decoupled payments in land rental values. Our estimates suggest that the CAP reform leads to an increase in the capitalization of decoupled payments by additional 16 cents for each EUR of decoupled payments relative to the pre-reform situation. However, there is a relatively large variation in the reform effects between MS particularly between Old Member States (OMS) and New MS (NMS). In NMS the capitalization rate slightly reduces from 76 % in the pre-reform period to 72 % in the post-reform period. Although, the rate is significantly lower in OMS, it almost doubles (from 20 % to 39 %) due to the reform. The main source of the post-reform capitalization in the EU are the entitlement stock changes accounting for 19 % of total post-reform capitalization level, followed by the <b>internal</b> <b>convergence</b> of payments with 18 %, the budget change (including external convergence) with 1 %, and the differentiation of payments (redistributive payment) with - 7 %.

Romania {{is one of the}} “second wave” East European countries candidate to enter the EU in 2007. Romania’s position, apparently {{similar to those of the}} other candidates, is however quite peculiar. In spite of some positive signals (growth, exports, FDI, productive international networks), it deeply suffers from internal socio-economic inequalities, obsolete industries, scarce technological progress, weak public administration, lacking infrastructure. Moreover, concerns arise – as repeatedly stressed by European Union Commission – with regard to the safeguard of human rights. Nowadays trade liberalization and policies directed to convert the productive system are ongoing in this country with the main objective of fulfilling the EU acquis. In this “race”, however, strength aspects and fragility elements of the context play a fundamental role in influencing the result of major changes that are taking place in Romania. On one side the country benefits from a position in international production system that could be a stimulus to endogenous growth processes, on the other, however, serious internal obstacles still remain strong.

40|$|The Control-B {{simulation}} {{experiment was}} designed to improve on the Control-A experiment performed with the GMASS model. This experiment addressed several inadequacies with the first smooth terrain numerical simulation by including: (1) increased nested-grid resolution to better define the simulated gravity waves, (2) increased horizontal diffusion to remove outflow boundary condition noise, and (3) the use of reanalyzed rawinsonde data and surface observations in the initial state to increase {{the definition of the}} observed jet streak as well as other low-level features. A smoothed-terrain dry simulation with the nested-grid GMASS model has revealed many important aspects of the processes which resulted in the generation of gravity waves in the region and time when and where they were observed. However, the vertical structure, number, and characteristics of the waves are still quite different from observed waves as diagnosed thus necessitating future improved simulations. However, this control simulation has produced substantial insight into processes which occur on many spatial scales over a 30 hour time period thus allowing one to draw promising inferences as to the mechanisms for the complex process which occurred in nature during the CCOPE case study. The theoretical aspects of the project have focus on understanding the nature of the ageostrophic circulations which are produced in idealized models of the atmosphere in which the troposphere is modeled in one of two ways. The first model assumes that the lower atmosphere can be represented as a single layer of homogeneous fluid whose upper surface is free to exhibit vertical displacement. Two-dimensional <b>internal</b> <b>convergence</b> (divergence) occurring during the adjustment to an asymptotic equilibrium state from an ageostrophic initial state whose momentum structure is representative of a midlatitude localized zonal wind anomaly will cause the free upper surface of the homogeneous atmosphere to rise (fall), and therefore the response can be viewed as being physically three-dimensional.

It distinguishes between the opposite forces provided by: (1) the catching up effect of the EU- 10, expected to lead to a rise in price levels; and (2) increased competitiveness pressure on prices expected to lower price levels due to lower mark ups of prices over marginal costs. The study is based on comparative price levels for the EU- 25, covering the period 1999 - 2004. Distinct variables were identified as proxies for the catching-up and competition forces. The following analysis proceeded in two steps. First, it is examined whether price convergence has occurred and, second, what are its main drivers. The results confirm the presence of price convergence. This process is particularly visible in the case of basic headings, most likely because they are related to more homogeneous products.

In addition, the ability to deploy and manage services using a centralized traffic engineering control system within the 4 G and LTE IP RAN for MBB services would be highly advantageous. Most of these requirements are addressed in the technologies to be presented. The technologies highlighted within this presentation include the Topology-Transparent Zone (TTZ) [2] which may be deployed for network virtualization, resolving internal AS scalability and convergence, Multi-topology MPLS [3] procedures and protocol extensions to support separation of traffic across low latency (for mobile voice) and high capacity (for mobile data) links, {{and the use of the}} SDN Application-based Network Operations (ABNO) [4] architecture to provide underlying transport (Ethernet and optical) path protection.

40|$|Abstract Background Tinnitus {{research}} {{in an international}} context requires standardized and validated questionnaires in different languages. The aim of the present set of analyses was the reassessment of basic psychometric properties according to classical test theory of self-report instruments that are being used within the multicentre Tinnitus Research Initiative (TRI) database project. Methods 1318 patients of the TRI Database were eligible for the analyses. The basic psychometric properties reliability, validity, and sensitivity of Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI), Tinnitus Questionnaire (TQ) and Tinnitus Beeinträchtigungs Fragebogen (i. e., Tinnitus Impairment Questionnaire, TBF- 12) were assessed {{by the use of}} Cronbach’s alpha, corrected item-total correlations, correlation coefficients and standardized response means. Results Throughout the languages, all questionnaires showed high internal consistencies (Cronbach’s alpha > 0. 79) and solid item-total correlations, as well as high correlations among themselves (around 0. 8) and in combination with the self-reported tinnitus severity. However, some paradoxical correlations between individual items of the TBF- 12, constructed as a shortform of the THI, and the corresponding THI-items were seen. Standardized Response Means (SRM) were low if tinnitus did not change, and between 0. 3 and 1. 09 for improved or worsened tinnitus complaints, indicating the sensitivity of the measures. Conclusions All investigated instruments have high <b>internal</b> consistency, high <b>convergence</b> and discriminant validity and good change sensitivity in an unselected large multinational clinical sample and thus appear appropriate to evaluate the effects of tinnitus treatments in a cross-cultural context. </p...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: atopic {{dermatitis}} {{is directly related}} to psychological stress, reduced quality of life and psychosomatic symptoms. The Psychosomatic Scale for Atopic Dermatitis is the only questionnaire developed specifically for assessment of psychosomatization in {{atopic dermatitis}}. OBJECTIVES: the objective {{of this study was to}} cross-culturally adapt and validate a Brazilian-Portuguese version of the Psychosomatic Scale for Atopic Dermatitis. METHODS: adaptation consisted of independent translation and backtranslation by three bilingual translators, followed by a pre-test. The Psychosomatic Scale for Atopic Dermatitis and the Dermatology Life Quality Index were self-administered to 47 patients with atopic dermatitis. Disease severity was evaluated using the Eczema Area and Severity Index. Factor analysis was used to identify the dimensions of the Brazilian Portuguese version of the Psychosomatic Scale for Atopic Dermatitis. <b>Internal</b> consistency and <b>convergence</b> validity were also analyzed. Reproducibility was assessed using the Kappa coefficient. RESULTS: factor analysis revealed a two-dimensional structure: stress/laziness/insecurity (I) and maladjustment/social relationships (II), explaining 54. 4 % of total variance. All dimensions revealed excellent internal consistency. External construct validity was confirmed by positive correlations between the Psychosomatic Scale for Atopic Dermatitis and the Dermatology Life Quality Index. Test-retest reliability was excellent, with k> 0. 7 for all questions. CONCLUSIONS: the Brazilian Portuguese version of the Psychosomatic Scale for Atopic Dermatitis demonstrated acceptable psychometric properties and can be used for the evaluation of psychosomatic symptoms in patients with atopic dermatitis and as a tool in clinical and epidemiological research...|$|R

40|$|We {{draw upon}} {{multiple}} theories of corporate governance {{to examine the}} effects of competition and regulation on firm-level corporate governance quality. We find that regulation enhances firm-level corporate governance and within-country convergence. Competition has a negative effect on corporate governance. The interactive effect of regulation and competition is negative on firm-level corporate governance. Furthermore, competition reduces within-country <b>convergence.</b> <b>Internal,</b> i. e., firm-level governance choices are significantly influenced by external (country-level) choices. This suggests that governance choices are likely to converge across countries while simultaneously diverging within countries. For example, while firms in the top governance score cluster of each country will be different from lower-scoring clusters of firms in the same country, the similarity of the competition-regulation environment in which they operate means that these firms are likely to be very similar to firms in the top governance clusters of other countries. Our paper makes two significant contributions. First, it provides an integrative view of corporate governance that incorporates factors contributing to the variation in corporate governance across countries. Second, we contribute to the debate on within- and crosscountry convergence of corporate governance. While some researchers pontificate on the eventual convergence of global corporate governance practices, others have their own doubts. The latter viewpoint is reinforced by studies on temporal convergence in corporate governance which reveal significant cross-country variation due to path-dependence in the evolution of corporate governance practices. We provide an economic argument, namely that competition detracts from within-country convergence in corporate governance...|$|R
