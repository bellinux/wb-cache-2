40|$|The {{toxicological}} assessment of genotoxic impurities {{is an important}} consideration in the regulatory framework for pharmaceuticals. In this context, the application of promising computational methods (e. g. Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationships (QSARs), Structure-Activity Relationships (SARs) and/or expert systems) {{for the evaluation of}} genotoxicity is needed, especially when very limited information on impurities is available, both for practical reasons and to respect the principle of the 3 Rs (Replacement, Reduction and Refinement) of animal use. To gain an overview of how computational methods are used internationally in the regulatory assessment of pharmaceutical impurities, the current regulatory documents were reviewed. The software recommended in the guidelines (e. g. MCASE, MC 4 PC, Derek for Windows) or, practically used by various regulatory agencies (e. g. U. S. Food and Drug Administration, U. S. and <b>Danish</b> <b>Environmental</b> <b>Protection</b> <b>Agencies),</b> {{as well as the other}} existing programs were analysed, highlighting their benefits and limitations. Both statistically-based and knowledge-based (expert system) tools were analysed. Information on the models’ training sets as well as their applicability domains was retrieved. The overall conclusions on the available in silico tools for genotoxicity and carcinogenicity prediction are quite optimistic and the regulatory application of QSAR methods is constantly growing. For regulatory purposes, it is recommended that the predictions of genotoxicity/carcinogenicity should be based on a battery of models, combining high sensitivity models (low rate of false negatives) with high specificity ones (low rate of false positives), and in vitro assays in an integrated manner.

This chapter examines regulatory and entrepreneurial attempts to reconcile {{environmental and economic}} value by turning polluting substances into matters of worth. Our case focuses on animal slurry in agriculture – a hybrid valuation object which produces both ammonia emissions in the atmosphere and fertilizer for the farm’s crops. Following the implementation of regulation aiming to reduce ammonia emissions from livestock farming, entrepreneurs have introduced new technologies to clean and thus valorize slurry; {{the construction of a}} market for such “clean” technologies has in turn raised the issue of how their value can be demonstrated and measured.

40|$|Renowned {{acoustician}} denounces {{double standards}} in noise regulations Tricks {{are used to}} allow wind farms too close to habitations In an email replying to the European Platform against Windfarms (EPAW), world-leading specialist in low-frequency sound Professor Henrik Moller of Aalborg University denounces the improper acoustic measurements carried out by Danish authorities. As a result, he says, the new regulations for wind farm noise are not in line with industrial noise standards. According to EPAW, this effectively constitutes discrimination against wind farm neighbors, which now have less protection than other citizens- in Denmark, but also in those countries that may take their cues from the small kingdom.

However, it was unclear if pine tar had a sufficient biocidal efficacy to fall under the Biocidal Products Directive. In order to clarify that question the Nordic Biocides Group under the Nordic Chemicals Group decided to initiate this study on the fungicidal efficacy of pine tar.

40|$|A special {{challenge}} in the new European Union chemicals legislation, Registration, Evaluation and Authorisation of Chemicals, will be the toxicological evaluation of chemicals for reproductive toxicity. Use of valid quantitative structure–activity relationships (QSARs) is a possibility under the new legislation. This article focuses on a screening exercise by use of our own and commercial QSAR models for identification of possible reproductive toxicants. Three QSAR models were used for reproductive toxicity for the endpoints teratogenic risk to humans (based on animal tests, clinical data and epidemiological human studies), dominant lethal effect in rodents (in vivo) and Drosophila melanogaster sex-linked recessive lethal effect. A structure set of 57, 014 European Inventory of Existing Chemical Substances (EINECS) chemicals was screened.

40|$|Invasion {{of ocean}} surface waters by {{anthropogenic}} CO emitted {{to the atmosphere}} is expected to reduce surface seawater pH to 7. 8 {{by the end of}} this century compromising marine calcifiers. A broad range of biological and mineralogical mechanisms allow marine calcifiers to cope with ocean acidification, however these mechanisms are energetically demanding which affect other biological processes (trade-offs) with important implications for the resilience of the organisms against stressful conditions. Hence, food availability may play a critical role in determining the resistance of calcifiers to OA. Here we show, based on a meta-analysis of existing experimental results assessing the role of food supply in the response of organisms to OA, that food supply consistently confers calcifiers resistance to ocean acidification.

40|$|International audienceA {{previous}} report documented that endocrine disrupting chemicals contribute substantially to {{certain forms of}} disease and disability. In the present analysis, our main objective was to update a range of health and economic costs that can be reasonably attributed to endocrine disrupting chemical exposures in the European Union, leveraging new burden and disease cost estimates of female reproductive conditions from accompanying report. Expert panels evaluated the epidemiologic evidence, using adapted criteria from the WHO Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation Working Group, and evaluated laboratory and animal evidence of endocrine disruption using definitions recently promulgated by the <b>Danish</b> <b>Environmental</b> <b>Protection</b> <b>Agency.</b> The Delphi method was used to make decisions {{on the strength of}} the data. Expert panels consensus was achieved for probable (> 20 %) endocrine disrupting chemical causation for IQ loss and associated intellectual disability; autism; attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; endometriosis; fibroids; childhood obesity; adult obesity; adult diabetes; cryptorchidism; male infertility, and mortality associated with reduced testosterone. Accounting for probability of causation, and using the midpoint of each range for probability of causation, Monte Carlo simulations produced a median annual cost of € 163 billion (1. 28 % of EU Gross Domestic Product) across 1000 simulations. We conclude that endocrine disrupting chemical exposures in the EU are likely to contribute substantially to disease and dysfunction across the life course with costs in the hundreds of billions of Euros per year. These estimates represent only those endocrine disrupting chemicals with the highest probability of causation; a broader analysis would have produced greater estimates of burden of disease and costs...|$|E
40|$|AbstractUse of {{the road}} {{infrastructure}} brings wear {{of the road}} surface and vehicles and loss of fuel components. This leads to pollution of the environment near the roads, due to run–off of road surface water to lakes and streams. The two thousand detention basins along the Danish main road network act as delaying basins for sudden large amounts of water and also collect substances which are injorious to the environment, before the water is led to lakes and streams. The Danish Road Directorate has examined the content of substances injorious to the environment in the sediment of 70 basins distributed in the whole country. Analysis of hydrocarbons, PAH, heavy metals and NaCl have been made. The analysis are {{used to determine the}} degree of pollution of the sediment in relation to the criteria set out by the <b>Danish</b> <b>Environmental</b> <b>Protection</b> <b>Agency.</b> The results show that at least 90 per cent of the detention basins have sediment which is defined as slightly polluted and at least 61 has sediment which is polluted. These high values are due to the content of hydrocarbons. The second largest source of pollution is nickel and the concentrations show that 20 per cent of the basins have sediment which is polluted by nickel. The highest concentrations of substances injorious to the environment are around Copenhagen and Odense and on the stretch between Kolding and Randers. The content of PAH and heavy metals has been compared to analysis from 38 natural Danish lakes. The analyses shows that there is no marked difference between the measured levels of pollution in detention basins and natural lakes. Hydrocarbons have been compared to two natural lakes and here the difference is very considerable...|$|E
