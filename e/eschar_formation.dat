50|$|Chemical enzymes {{are fast}} acting {{products}} that slough off necrotic tissue. These enzymes {{are derived from}} micro-organisms including clostridium and histolyticum; or from plants, examples include collagenase, varidase, papain, and bromelain. Some of these enzymatic debriders are selective, while some are not. This method works well on wounds (especially burns) with {{a large amount of}} necrotic debris or with <b>eschar</b> <b>formation.</b> However, the results are mixed and the effectiveness is variable. Therefore this type of debridement is used sparingly and is not considered a standard of care for burn treatments.|$|E

The typical patient {{appears to be an}} obese, middle aged woman (median age 54 years, male to female ratio 1:3). This drug eruption usually occurs between the third and tenth days of therapy with warfarin derivatives. The first symptoms are pain and redness in the affected area. As they progress, lesions develop a sharp border and become petechial, then hard and purpuric. They may then resolve or progress to form large, irregular, bloody bullae with eventual necrosis and slow-healing <b>eschar</b> <b>formation.</b> Favored sites are breasts, thighs, buttocks and penis, all areas with subcutaneous fat. In rare cases, the fascia and muscle are involved.|$|E
50|$|Studies {{in humans}} show {{comparable}} results. Dermal penetration through human skin {{has been shown}} to be very rapid. NMP is rapidly biotransformed by hydroxylation to 5-hydroxy-N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, which is further oxidized to N-methylsuccinimide; this intermediate is further hydroxylated to 2-hydroxy-N-methylsuccinimide. These metabolites are all colourless. The excreted amounts of NMP metabolites in the urine after inhalation or oral intake represented about 100% and 65% of the administered doses, respectively. NMP has a low potential for skin irritation and a moderate potential for eye irritation in rabbits. Repeated daily doses of 450 mg/kg body weight administered to the skin caused painful and severe haemorrhage and <b>eschar</b> <b>formation</b> in rabbits. These adverse effects have not been seen in workers occupationally exposed to pure NMP, but they have been observed after dermal exposure to NMP used in cleaning processes. No sensitization potential has been observed.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to prevent <b>eschar</b> <b>formation</b> in {{thermally}} injured patients during the use of povidoneiodine ointment by modifying therapeutic protocols depending on normal events in healing process. Sixty thermally injured patients of different age groups, sex, and occupation with different burn sizes were involved in the study, allocated to two groups. Group A was made up of 17 patients treated with topical povidone-iodine ointment in addition to other prescribed drugs according to the burn unit regimen, while group B was comprised of 43 patients treated with topical povidone-iodine ointment for the first four days post-injury followed by topical silver sulphadiazine cream until discharge and with other prescribed drugs according to the burn unit regimen. In both groups the following were studied, using standard methods: oxidative stress parameters; thyroid, liver, and renal function test; microbiology; mortality rate; healing time and economic aspects. It was found that treatment of burn patients with topical povidone-iodine ointment for the first four days post-injury followed by topical silver sulphadiazine cream reduced the incidence of <b>eschar</b> <b>formation</b> from 100 % to 2. 3 %, in addition to maintaining improvement in burn outcome when using povidone-iodine ointment during the full course of treatment. It is concluded that for the modification of treatment protocols in burns designed to obtain normal wound healing and at the same time to avoid the undesirable effects of the treatment given, the use of topical povidone-iodine ointment for the first four days post-injury, followed by topical silver sulphadiazine cream, was a good application. In addition, this study clearly shows the importance of the therapeutic targeting of oxidative stress in burn treatment, especially during the first four days post-injury, a period when blood levels of oxidative stress parameters are at a maximum...|$|E

40|$|Low {{molecular}} weight heparin (LMWH) {{appears to be}} a promising solution for reducing inflammatory post-burn episodes and results in improved healing. The clinical examination presented here includes patients with burn wounds ranging from 20 to 35 % total body surface area (TBSA) who were categorized into two groups, of which one received subcutaneous LMWH treatment (10, 000 units/day) and the other acted as control. The process of healing was assessed through regular examination of clinical features such as regression of erythema and oedema, <b>eschar</b> <b>formation,</b> and rate of re-epithelialization. Various studies have demonstrated an increase in levels of serum IL- 6 indicating the severity of the morbid condition. In the present investigation, LMWH-treated patients exhibited a faster decline in levels of serum IL- 6 (within 12 days) than control. Infiltration of inflammatory cells at the local wound site was assessed through a histological analysis of tissue samples taken on various days during the healing process. The LMWH-treated groups exhibited an organized healing pattern with better remodelling in a shorter duration (28 days), while control patients took more than 28 days for complete healing. A slight correlation was observed with TBSA to the inflammatory process, which subsided in patients treated with LMWH, favourably modulating the events involved in the inflammatory process of burn wound healing...|$|E
40|$|Scrub typhus is an {{important}} endemic disease of the Asia-Pacific region caused by Orientia tsutsugamushi. To develop an effective vaccine to prevent scrub typhus infection, {{a better understanding of}} the initial host-pathogen interaction is needed. The objective of this study was to investigate early bacterial dissemination in a CD- 1 Swiss outbred mouse model after intradermal injection of O. tsutsugamushi. Three human pathogenic strains of O. tsutsugamushi (Karp, Gilliam, and Woods) were chosen to investigate the early infection characteristics associated with bacterial virulence. Tissue biopsies of the intradermal injection site and draining lymph nodes were examined using histology and immunohistochemistry to characterize bacterial dissemination, and correlated with quantitative real-time PCR for O. tsutsugamushi in blood and tissue from major organs. Soluble adhesion molecules were measured to examine cellular activation in response to infection. No <b>eschar</b> <b>formation</b> was seen at the inoculation site and no clinical disease developed within the 7 day period of observation. However, O. tsutsugamushi was localized at the injection site and in the draining lymph nodes by day 7 post inoculation. Evidence of leukocyte and endothelial activation was present by day 7 with significantly raised levels of sL-selectin, sICAM- 1 and sVCAM- 1. Infection with the Karp strain was associated with earlier and higher bacterial loads and more extensive dissemination in various tissues than the less pathogenic Gilliam and Woods strains.

40|$|A {{total of}} 370 ticks, {{encompassing}} 7 species from 4 genera, were collected during 2002 – 2006 from domestic animals and vegetation in the Taza region of northeastern Morocco. Rickettsial DNA was identifi ed in 101 ticks (27 %) by sequencing PCR products of {{fragments of the}} citrate synthase and outer membrane protein genes of Rickettsia spp. Seven rickettsiae of the spotted fever group were identifi ed, including 4 pathogens: R. aeschlimannii in Hyalomma marginatum marginatum, R. massiliae in Rhipicephalus sanguineus, R. slovaca in Dermacentor marginatus, and R. monacensis in Ixodes ricinus. Two suspected pathogens were also detected (R. raoultii in D. marginatus and R. helvetica in I. ricinus). An incompletely described Rickettsia sp. was detected in Haemaphysalis spp. ticks. Tick-borne rickettsioses are infections caused by obligate intracellular gram-negative bacteria of the spotted fever group (SFG) in the genus Rickettsia and the order Rickettsiales. These zoonoses are now recognized as emerging vector-borne infections worldwide (1, 2). They share characteristic clinical features, including fever, headache, rash, and occasional <b>eschar</b> <b>formation</b> {{at the site of}} the tick bite. Although these diseases have been known for a long time, they have been poorly investigated in northern Africa, including Morocco (2).

40|$|Intra-lesional {{chemotherapy}} {{for treatment}} of cutaneous malignancies {{has been used for}} many decades, allowing higher local drug concentrations and less toxicity than systemic agents. Here we describe a novel diterpene ester, EBC- 46, and provide preclinical data supporting its use as an intra-lesional treatment. A single injection of EBC- 46 caused rapid inflammation and influx of blood, followed by <b>eschar</b> <b>formation</b> and rapid tumor ablation in a range of syngeneic and xenograft models. EBC- 46 induced oxidative burst from purified human polymorphonuclear cells, which was prevented by the Protein Kinase C inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide- 1. EBC- 46 activated a more specific subset of PKC isoforms (PKC-bI,-bII,-a and-c) compared to the structurally related phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate (PMA). Although EBC- 46 showed threefold less potency for inhibiting cell growth than PMA in vitro, it was more effective for cure of tumors in vivo. No viable tumor cells were evident four hours after injection by ex vivo culture. Pharmacokinetic profiles from treated mice indicated that EBC- 46 was retained preferentially within the tumor, and resulted in significantly greater local responses (erythema, oedema) following intra-lesional injection compared with injection into normal skin. The efficacy of EBC- 46 was reduced by co-injection with bisindolylmaleimide- 1. Loss of vascular integrity following treatment was demonstrated by an increased permeability of endothelial cell monolayers in vitro and by CD 31 immunostaining of treated tumors in vivo. Our results demonstrate that a single intra-lesional injection of EBC- 46 causes PKC-dependent hemorrhagic necrosis, rapid tumor cel...|$|E
40|$|A 38 -year-old {{woman with}} {{alcoholic}} cirrhosis was admitted with a recurrent lower extremity rash. She had presented 1 year prior {{with a history}} of alcohol abuse, abdominal pain, fatigue, and a violaceous rash over the abdomen and proximal lower extremities. A skin biopsy showed multiple small vessels with calcification of the outer wall suggesting calciphylaxis. The patient was treated with sodium thiosulfate 25 mg intravenously 3 times weekly and serial wound debridement. She had symptom improvement within 3 weeks and resolution of the rash. One year later, the patient presented with recurrence of the painful violaceous rash (Figure 1). She denied any alcohol use over the last year. She had not been receiving albumin infusions or blood transfusions, and her body mass index (BMI) was 22 kg/m 2. Evidence of a healed skin graft was noted on her left thigh, with surrounding tender punctate erythema. Her calcium, phosphorus, parathyroid hormone, creatinine, and protein C and S levels were normal. An abdominal CT was significant for findings consistent with cirrhosis. The patient was started on sodium thiosulfate therapy and local wound care, and responded well without recurrence to date. Calciphylaxis is a rare, life-threatening syndrome characterized by cutaneous ischemic necrosis secondary to vascular calcifica-tion. It is seen almost exclusively in end-stage renal disease, but has been associated with cirrhosis in 9 case reports. The patho-genesis of calciphylaxis is unclear, but commonly described risk factors include female sex, obesity, protein C and S deficiency, corticosteroid use, albumin or blood transfusions, and high calcium-phosphorus product. 1 Clinically, calciphylaxis presents with tender violaceous skin mottling that progresses to blackened regions of <b>eschar</b> <b>formation</b> and non-healing ulceration.

40|$|Options {{for skin}} cancer {{treatment}} currently include surgery, radiotherapy, topical chemotherapy, cryosurgery, curettage, and electrodes-sication. Although effective, surgery is costly and unsuitable for certain patients. Radiotherapy can leave a poor cosmetic effect, and current chemotherapy {{is limited by}} low cure rates and extended treatment schedules. Here, we describe the preclinical activity of a novel topical chemotherapeutic agent {{for the treatment of}} skin cancer, 3 -ingenyl angelate (PEP 005), a hydrophobic diterpene ester isolated from the plant Euphorbia peplus. Three daily topical applications of 42 nmol (18 mug) of PEP 005 cured a series of s. c. mouse tumors (B 16 melanoma, LK 2 UV-induced squamous cell carcinoma, and Lewis lung carcinoma; it = > 14 tumors/group) and human tumors (DO 4 melanoma, HeLa cervical carcinoma, and PC 3 and DU 145 prostate carcinoma; it = > 4 tumors/group) previously established (5 - 10 mm(3)) on C 57 BL/ 6 or Fox 1 (nu) mice. The treatment produced a mild, short-term erythema and <b>eschar</b> <b>formation</b> but, ultimately, resulted in excellent skin cosmesis. The LD 90 for PEP 005 for a panel of tumor cell lines was 180 - 220 muM. Electron microscopy showed that treatment with PEP 005 both ill vitro (230 tot) and ill vivo (42 nmol) rapidly caused swelling of mitochondria and cell death by primary necrosis. Cr- 51 release, uptake of propidium iodide, and staining with the mitochondria dye JC 1, revealed that PEP 005 (230 muM) treatment of tumor cells ill vitro resulted in a rapid plasma membrane perturbation and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. PEP 005 thus emerges as a new topical anti-skin cancer agent that has a novel mode of action involving plasma membrane and mitochondrial disruption and primary necrosis, ultimately resulting in an excellent cosmetic outcome...|$|E

Three new Rickettsiae of the R. massiliae genogroup {{were identified in}} ticks by 16 S rDNA, gltA, and ompA sequencing. Rickettsiae are obligate intracellular gramnegative bacteria associated with arthropod vectors, ticks, mites, and insects that, while feeding, can transmit Rickettsiae to animals and humans. The rickettsioses have characteristic clinical features, including fever, headache, maculopapular eruption, and sometimes <b>eschar</b> <b>formation</b> (primary lesion). The number of representatives of the genus Rickettsia has increased over the last decades {{as a result of}} improved cell culture isolation and agent identification techniques (1). Sequence comparison of gene coding for citrate synthase (gltA) (2), rOmpA outer membrane protein (ompA) (3), and 16 S rRNA (4) has become the most reliable method of identifying Rickettsiae (5 - 8). We describe polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and sequence determination to identify Rickettsiae in naturally infected ixodid ticks in three regions of Russia endemic for tickborne rickettsioses. Rhipicephalus pumilio ticks (65 adults) were collected in 1996 from dogs in the Astrakhan region. Dermacentor nuttallii ticks (101 adults) were collected in 1994 in the village of Verhnyi Kouus, the Altay Mountains, Siberia.

40|$|Many {{studies have}} {{reported}} that zinc plasma levels significantly decrease after a burn, leading to zinc deficiency, and that increased free radical generation and decreased natural antioxidant may negatively affect wound healing and burn outcome in general. Targeting of these changes is considered an important strategy {{in the treatment of}} burns in an attempt to improve burn outcome in the clinical setting. Zinc was given orally in a nutritional dose (15 mg elemental zinc) as a zinc sulphate capsule to burn patients in order to improve post-burn zinc deficiency and burn outcome. The study was carried out in 58 burn patients of different age groups, sex, and occupation with different burn size. The patients were allocated to two groups: group A patients (43 in number) were treated with topical povidone-iodine ointment for the first four days post-injury followed by topical silver sulphadiazine cream 1 % until discharge in addition to other prescribed drugs according to our burn unit policy; group B patients (15) received the same treatment as group A plus a single daily oral dose of zinc sulphate in a 66 mg capsule, equivalent to 15 mg elemental zinc. In each group, using standard methods, we considered plasma zinc and copper levels, oxidative stress parameters, thyroid, liver, and renal function tests, microbiological factors, mortality rate, healing time, and cost effectiveness. The administration of zinc in dietary doses significantly increased the plasma zinc level in burn patients to around normal control levels and improved the antioxidant status, as represented by elevation of the natural antioxidant level (glutathione), in addition to improving healing time, the incidence of <b>eschar</b> <b>formation,</b> and the mortality rate, compared with the zinc-nonsupplemented group. We conclude that dietary zinc supplementation in zinc-deficient burn patients led to great improvements in their outcome and that zinc deficiency was as an important goal to target during treatment; also, that the use of a combination of topical and systemic antioxidants (povidoneiodine ointment and zinc sulphate, respectively) represented a good strategy for improving results in burn patient treatment...|$|E
40|$|Skin ulcers are a {{commonly}} encountered problem at departments of tropical dermatology in the Western world. Furthermore, the general dermatologist {{is likely to}} be consulted more often for imported chronic skin ulcers because of the ever-increasing travel to and from tropical countries. The most common cause of chronic ulceration throughout the world is probably pyoderma. However, {{in some parts of the}} world, cutaneous leishmaniasis is one of the most prevalent causes. Mycobacterium ulcerans is an important cause of chronic ulcers in West Africa. Bacterial infections include pyoderma, mycobacterial infections, diphtheria, and anthrax. Pyoderma is caused by Staphylococcus aureus and/or beta-hemolytic streptococci group A. This condition is a common cause of ulcerative skin lesions in tropical countries and is often encountered as a secondary infection in travelers. The diagnosis is often made on clinical grounds. Antibacterial treatment for pyoderma should preferably be based on culture outcome. Floxacillin is generally active against S. aureus and beta-hemolytic streptococci. Infection with Mycobacterium ulcerans, M. marinum, and M. tuberculosis may cause ulcers. Buruli ulcers, which are caused by M. ulcerans, are endemic in foci in West Africa and have been reported as an imported disease in the Western world. Treatment is generally surgical, although a combination of rifampin (rifampicin) and streptomycin may be effective in the early stage. M. marinum causes occasional ulcerating lesions in humans. Treatment regimens consist of combinations containing clarithromycin, rifampin, or ethambutol. Cutaneous tuberculosis is rare in travelers but may be encountered in immigrants from developing countries. Treatment is with multiple drug regimens consisting of isoniazid, ethambutol, pyrazinamide, and rifampin. Cutaneous diphtheria is still endemic in many tropical countries. Cutaneous diphtheria ulcers are nonspecific and erythromycin and penicillin are both effective antibacterials. Antitoxin should be administered intramuscularly in suspected cases. Anthrax is caused by spore-forming Bacillus anthracis. This infection is still endemic in many tropical countries. <b>Eschar</b> <b>formation,</b> which sloughs and leaves behind a shallow ulcer at the site of inoculation, characterizes cutaneous anthrax. Penicillin and doxycycline are effective antibacterials. Cutaneous leishmaniasis is caused by different species belonging to the genus Leishmania. The disorder is one of the ten most frequent causes of skin diseases in travelers returning from (sub) tropical countries. The clinical picture is diverse, ranging from a painless papule or nodule to an ulcer with or without a scab. Treatment depends on the clinical manifestations and the species involved. Sporotrichosis, chromo(blasto) mycosis, and mycetoma are the most common mycoses that may be accompanied by ulceration. Infections are restricted to certain regions and often result from direct penetration of the fungus into the skin. Anti-mycotic treatment depends on the microorganism involved. The most common causes of infectious skin ulceration encountered in patients from tropical countries who present at a department of tropical dermatology are reviewed in this articl...|$|E
