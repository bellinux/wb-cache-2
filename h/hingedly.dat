50|$|While he was {{designing}} the rail bridges over the Volga river near Tver in 1885 and the Belaya River in Ufa in 1886, Beleloubski developed and {{introduced a new}} technology: the transverse floor-beams were <b>hingedly</b> connected to the bottom chords of trusses. Such a type of structural support {{was considered to be}} ground-breaking in the days of Beleloubski, because it allowed to reduce secondary stresses in trusses. At the Edinburg Exposition 1890, this design received the Gold medal and later came to be known abroad as the ‘Russian support method‘.|$|E
5000|$|The bridge conisted of 6 spans, each of 109-meter (358 feet) bowstring arch through trusses {{with double}} lattice girders. This design {{involved}} careful and exact alignment of truss members and chords, which {{were made from}} a fairly advanced construction material for that time — cast iron. Beleloubski also proposed an innovative constructive solution: the transverse floor-beams of trusses were <b>hingedly</b> connected to bottom chords. Such a type of structural support {{was considered to be}} ground-breaking in the days of Beleloubski, because it allowed to reduce secondary stresses in trusses. This design received the Gold medal at the Edinburg Exposition 1890, and later {{came to be known as}} [...] "the Russian support method".|$|E
40|$|An {{artificial}} leg {{including a}} trunk socket, a thigh section <b>hingedly</b> coupled {{to the trunk}} socket, a leg section <b>hingedly</b> coupled to the thigh section and a foot section <b>hingedly</b> coupled to the leg section is outlined. A mechanical energy storage device is operatively associated with the artificial leg for storage and release of energy during the normal walking stride of the user. Energy is stored in the mechanical energy storage device during a weight-bearing phase of the walking stride when the user's weight is on the artificial leg. Energy is released during a phase of the normal walking stride, when the user's weight {{is removed from the}} artificial leg. The stored energy is released from the energy storage device to pivot the thigh section forwardly about the hinged coupling to the trunk socket...|$|E
40|$|A frame {{includes}} {{a pair of}} parallel arms that are transversely spaced apart from one another. A first brace interconnects the parallel arms at their respective leading ends and a second brace interconnects the parallel arms at their respective mid-lengths. A table has a first end <b>hingedly</b> connected to the second brace. A first and second plurality of teeth is provided along an extent {{of the first and}} second arms, respectively. First and second support struts <b>hingedly</b> interconnect the table to preselected teeth when the table is in a first angular position relative to the frame. First and second book supports are slideably mounted on the table and lockable into any selected position. The parallel arms are releasably attached to the armrests of a conventional wheelchair. The support struts are disengaged from the teeth to enable folding the table into a horizontal storage position where it overlies the frame...|$|E
40|$|A {{skateboard}} {{that includes}} a storage compartment. The deck of the skateboard forms a storage compartment and includes a bottom panel, a sidewall, and a top panel. The sidewall extends upwardly from, and is disposed along, {{the periphery of the}} bottom panel. The top panel is <b>hingedly</b> connected to the sidewall and opens and closes to form a storage compartment in conjunction with the sidewall and bottom panel. A latch is used to securely fasten the top panel in the closed position. A handle is provided to carry the skateboard like a suitcase...|$|E
40|$|A compact {{robotic hand}} {{includes}} a palm housing, a wrist section, and a forearm section. The palm housing supports {{a plurality of}} fingers and one or more movable palm members that cooperate with the fingers to grasp and/or release an object. Each flexible finger comprises a plurality of <b>hingedly</b> connected segments, including a proximal segment pivotally connected to the palm housing. The proximal finger segment includes at least one groove defining first and second cam surfaces for engagement with a cable. A plurality of lead screw assemblies each carried by the palm housing are supplied with power from a flexible shaft rotated by an actuator and output linear motion to a cable move a finger. The cable is secured within a respective groove and enables each finger to move between an opened and closed position. A decoupling assembly pivotally connected to a proximal finger segment enables a cable connected thereto to control movement of an intermediate and distal finger segment independent of movement of the proximal finger segment. The dexterous robotic hand closely resembles the function of a human hand yet is light weight and capable of grasping both heavy and light objects {{with a high degree}} of precision...|$|E
