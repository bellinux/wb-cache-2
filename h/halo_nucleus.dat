50|$|Lithium-11 {{is thought}} to possess a <b>halo</b> <b>nucleus</b> {{consisting}} of a core of three protons and eight neutrons, {{two of which are}} in a nuclear halo. It has an exceptionally large cross-section of 3.16 fm2, comparable to that of 208Pb. It decays by beta emission to 11Be, which then decays in several ways (see table below).|$|E
50|$|One {{example of}} a <b>halo</b> <b>nucleus</b> is 11Li, which has a {{half-life}} of 8.6 ms. It contains a core of 3 protons and 6 neutrons, and a halo of two independent and loosely bound neutrons. It decays into 11Be by the emission of an antineutrino and an electron. Its cross-section of 3.16 fm is close to that of 32S or, even more impressively, of 208Pb, both much heavier nuclei.|$|E
50|$|In nuclear physics, {{an atomic}} nucleus {{is called a}} <b>halo</b> <b>nucleus</b> or {{is said to have}} a nuclear halo when it has a core nucleus {{surrounded}} by a halo of orbiting protons or neutrons, which makes the radius of the nucleus appreciably larger than that predicted by the liquid drop model. Halo nuclei form at the extreme edges of the table of nuclides — the neutron drip line and proton drip line — and have short half-lives, measured in milliseconds. These nuclei are studied shortly after their formation in an ion beam.|$|E
40|$|ReviewRecent {{developments}} (since {{the last}} review in J. of Physics G by I. Tanihata in 1996 [1]) at RIB facilities opened possibilities of detailed studies of <b>halo</b> <b>nuclei.</b> New facilities {{have been constructed}} to provide higher intensity beams of radioactive nuclei {{in a wide range}} of energies. At the time of the last review, only secondary beams by projectile fragmentation were the production source of <b>halo</b> <b>nuclei</b> for use in reaction studies. Since then, re-acceleration facilities have been developed and thus high-quality low-energy beams become available for the reaction studies. The wide variety of new data are thus available on <b>halo</b> <b>nuclei</b> and nuclei on and outside of proton and neutron drip lines. Low energy beams provided a means to determine the masses and charge radii of <b>halo</b> <b>nuclei</b> (6, 8 He, 11 Li). Also transfer reactions have been measured in many nuclei far from the stability line. In fragmentation facilities, new experimental methods such as gamma ray detection in coincidence with breakup fragments of <b>halo</b> <b>nuclei</b> have been developed. Also the reaction cross sections have been measured {{in a wide range of}} beam energies. In addition, proton elastic scattering of <b>halo</b> <b>nuclei</b> has been measured at high energies. All together, studies of density distribution, identification of shell orbitals and spectroscopic factors of halo wave function became possible. Such studies reveal many new important information such as the change of magic numbers in nuclei far from the stability line. In this article, we would like to review the experimental developments on <b>halo</b> <b>nuclei</b> and other related drip line nuclei. Also the new view of the nuclear structure learned from such studies will be discussed. Development of selected theories on related nuclear structure problems will be mentioned briefly...|$|R
40|$|Few-body {{systems with}} {{resonant}} S-wave interactions show universal properties which {{are independent of}} the interaction at short distances. These properties include a geometric spectrum of three- and higher-body bound states and universal correlations between few-body observables.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{microscopic}} study of <b>halo</b> <b>nuclei,</b> {{starting from the}} Paris and Bonn potentials and employing a two-frequency shell model approach. It is found that the core-polarization effect is dramatically suppressed in such nuclei. Consequently the effective interaction for halo nucleons is almost entirely given by the bare G-matrix alone, which presently can be evaluated {{with a high degree}} of accuracy. The experimental pairing energies between the two halo neutrons in 6 He and 11 Li nuclei are satisfactorily reproduced by our calculation. It is suggested that the fundamental nucleon-nucleon interaction can be probed in a clearer and more direct way in <b>halo</b> <b>nuclei</b> than in ordinary nuclei. PACS numbers: 21. 30. +y, 21. 60.

40|$|Although {{the neutron}} (n) does not carry a total {{electric}} charge, its charge and magnetization distributions represented in momentum space by the electromagnetic form factors, F_ 1 ^(n) (q^ 2) and F_ 2 ^(n) (q^ 2), {{lead to an}} electromagnetic potential of the neutron. Using this fact, we calculate the electromagnetic corrections to the binding energy, B_d, of the deuteron and a one neutron <b>halo</b> <b>nucleus</b> (11 Be), by evaluating the neutron-proton and the neutron-charged core (10 Be) potential, respectively. The correction to B_d (9 keV) is comparable to that arising due to {{the inclusion of the}} Δ-isobar component in the deuteron wave function.

40|$|The elastic {{scattering}} and {{breakup of the}} <b>halo</b> <b>nucleus</b> 11 Be on protons at an incident energy of 26. 9 A MeV have been measured. The 11 Be +p {{elastic scattering}} cross sections at various energies, including the present one, are systematically analyzed with the Chapel Hill 89 (CH 89) and Koning-Delaroche (KD) global optical model potentials (OMPs), and the corresponding normalization factors are obtained. An extended version of the continuum-discretized coupled-channels (XCDCC) formalism, including dynamic core excitation effects, is applied to analyze the elastic scattering and breakup data. It is found that the core excitation plays a moderate role in the elastic scattering and breakup reaction of the <b>halo</b> <b>nucleus</b> 11 Be, being consistent with previous results at higher energies.

40|$|The {{effect of}} core {{polarization}} in <b>halo</b> <b>nuclei</b> is studied using a two-frequency shell-model approach: ¯hωin for the inner orbits and ¯hωout for the outer (halo) orbits. Starting from the Paris and Bonn NN potentials, accurate modelspace G-matrix is first derived. The core-polarization diagrams G 3 p 1 h are then evaluated {{as a function}} of ¯hωout, with ¯hωin held fixed. We find that they are largely suppressed for <b>halo</b> <b>nuclei</b> such as 6 He, 6 Li and 11 Li. The calculated di-neutron (p 3 / 2) 2 and (p 1 / 2) 2 and proton-neutron (p 3 / 2) 2 energies in these nuclei are also in good agreement with experiments.

40|$|We {{develop the}} method for the {{calculation}} of the total reaction cross sections induced by the <b>halo</b> <b>nuclei</b> and stable nuclei. This approach {{is based on the}} Glauber theory, which is valid for nuclear reactions at high energy. It is extended for nuclear reactions at low energy and intermediate energy by including both the quantum correction and Coulomb correction under the assumption of the effective nuclear density distribution. The calculated results of the total reaction cross section induced by stable nuclei agree well with the 30 experimental data within 10 percent accuracy. The comparison between the numerical results and the 20 experimental data for the total nuclear reaction cross section induced by the neutron <b>halo</b> <b>nuclei</b> and the proton <b>halo</b> <b>nuclei</b> indicates a satisfactory agreement after considering the halo structure of these nuclei, which implies the quite different mean fields for the nuclear reactions induced by <b>halo</b> <b>nuclei</b> and stable <b>nuclei.</b> The <b>halo</b> nucleon distributions and the root mean square radii of these nuclei can be extracted from above comparison based on the improved Glauber model, which indicate clearly the halo structures of these nuclei. Especially, it is clear to see that the medium correction of the nucleon-nucleon collision has little effect on the total reaction cross sections induced by the <b>halo</b> <b>nuclei</b> due to the very weak binding and the very extended density distribution.
