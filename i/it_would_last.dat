5|$|In 1654, {{only five}} years after its passage, the Act was repealed. Two years earlier the colony had been seized by Protestants {{following}} the execution of King Charles I of England and {{the outbreak of the}} English Civil War. In the early stages of that conflict, the colonial assembly of Maryland and its neighbors in Virginia had publicly declared their support for the King. Parliament appointed Protestant commissioners loyal to their cause to subdue the colonies, and two of them, the Virginian William Claiborne and Puritan leader Richard Bennett, took control of the colonial government in St. Mary's City in 1652. In addition to repealing the Maryland Toleration Act with the assistance of Protestant assemblymen, Claiborne and Bennett passed a new law barring Catholics from openly practicing their religion. Calvert regained control after making a deal with the colony's Protestants, and in 1657 the Act was again passed by the colonial assembly. This time, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>last</b> more than thirty years, until 1692.|$|E
5|$|PedroII {{planned a}} trip to Europe which would result in his absence for almost a year. In his place, his {{daughter}} and heir Isabel became Regent. Since {{she was young and}} inexperienced, Rio Branco could not rely on Imperial intervention to help push through passage of the Emperor's anti-slavery legislation. By this time, the Conservative elders were no more, and he had risen to lead the Conservative Party. Rio Branco formed his Cabinet on 7 March 1871 and <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>last</b> until 25 June 1875—the second longest in the Empire's history. Rio Branco became the longest-serving prime minister. With a single exception, all ministers he appointed were young and inexperienced. Only one achieved prominence: João Alfredo Correia de Oliveira, who as President of the Council of Ministers would, on 13 May 1888, secure passage of the law that extinguished the last vestiges of slavery in Brazil.|$|E
5|$|The humor {{magazine}} National Lampoon hired Jean and Reiss {{after they}} graduated in 1981. During the 1980s, the duo began collaborating on various television material. During this period they worked as writers and producers on television {{shows such as}} The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, ALF, Sledge Hammer! and It's Garry Shandling's Show. In 1989, Jean was offered {{a job as a}} writer on the animated sitcom The Simpsons, a show created by Matt Groening, James L. Brooks, and Sam Simon that continues to air today. Many of Jean's friends were not interested in working on The Simpsons because it was a cartoon and they did not think <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>last</b> long. Jean, however, was a fan of the work of Groening, Brooks, and Simon, and therefore took the job together with Reiss.|$|E

5|$|The siege {{began in}} May 1648. The Ottomans spent three months {{investing}} the city, which included {{cutting off the}} water supply. Eventually, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>last</b> until 1669, the second longest siege in history after the Siege of Ceuta (1694-1727) by the Moors under Moulay Ismail. The Ottoman besiegers were adversely affected by the bad supply situation caused by {{the activity of the}} Christian fleets in the Aegean, who intercepted Ottoman convoys carrying supplies and reinforcements to the island. In addition, the overall Ottoman war effort was severely hampered by increased domestic instability caused by Sultan Ibrahim's erratic policies and his summary execution of leading state officials. It ultimately led to his deposition in favor of his son Mehmed IV, ushering in a further period of confusion within the Ottoman government.|$|E
5|$|The new Ottoman army {{arrived on}} the island {{during the winter of}} 1666/1667, and in May, the final phase of the siege, overseen by the Grand Vizier himself, began. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>last</b> for 28 months and cost the lives of 70,000 Ottoman soldiers, 38,000 conscripted Cretans and slaves who labored in the Ottoman siege works and 29,088 of the city's Christian defenders. Faced with the renewed Ottoman assault and a {{struggling}} economy, despite the prospect of considerable reinforcements from Western Europe, in 1668 the Signoria hoped to end the war by striking a peace settlement with the Ottomans. Indeed, the Venetians hoped to use the imminent arrival of reinforcements to secure concessions from the Ottomans. Admiral Andrea Valier was at first appointed as envoy, but fell ill and was quickly replaced by the elderly nobleman Alvise da Molin. Molin and his embassy traveled to Larissa, where the Ottoman court resided during one of the Sultan's hunting expeditions. The Ottomans proposed that Venice keep one half of Crete, but the Signoria, emboldened by further pledges of reinforcements, especially from France, and renewed turmoil at the Ottoman court and within the Empire, refused the offer. Molin, in the meantime transported by the Ottomans to Canea in Crete, was ordered to continue negotiations and to continue observing the Ottomans' strength and intentions, but not commit himself or the Republic.|$|E

25|$|In 1873, {{two years}} after the {{unification}} of Germany, Franz Joseph entered into the League of Three Emperors (Dreikaiserbund) with Kaiser Wilhelm I of Germany and Tsar Alexander II of Russia (who was succeeded by Tsar Alexander III in 1881). The league had been designed by the German chancellor Otto von Bismarck, as an attempt to maintain the peace of Europe. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>last</b> intermittently until 1887.|$|E
25|$|New England took a 3-0 lead {{three minutes}} into the second quarter with John Smith's 23-yard field goal, but <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>last</b> just five minutes before Woodley {{finished}} a 76-yard drive with a 2-yard touchdown pass to tight end Bruce Hardy. Then next time Miami had the ball, they drove 79 yards to a 1-yard touchdown run by Franklin, giving the team a 14-3 halftime lead.|$|E
25|$|Blowing up the {{causeway}} had delayed the Japanese attack {{for over a}} week. Prior to the main assault the Australians were subjected to an intense artillery bombardment. Over a period of 15 hours starting at 23:00 on 8 February 1942 Yamashita's heavy guns laid down a barrage of 88,000 shells (200 rounds per tube) along {{the entire length of}} the straits, cutting telephone lines and effectively isolating forward units from rear areas. Even at this stage, a counter artillery barrage as a response could have been mounted by the British on the coastline opposite the Australians that would have caused casualties and disruption among the Japanese assault troops. But the bombardment of the Australians was not seen as a prelude to imminent attack—Malaya Command believed that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>last</b> several days and would later switch its focus to the north-east—despite its ferocity exceeding anything the Allies had experienced thus far in the campaign, and consequently no order was passed to the Allied artillery units to begin targeting possible Japanese assembly areas.|$|E

25|$|Madison, {{the lead}} {{supporter}} of the Constitution, was inhibited in replying to Henry's criticisms, since he was ill {{through most of the}} convention. Henry likely realized he was fighting a losing battle as sentiment in the convention moved towards ratification, but continued to speak at length and his speeches fill nearly one-quarter of the pages of the Richmond convention's debates. Governor Randolph, who had become a supporter of ratification, suggested that if the convention allowed Henry to continue arguing, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>last</b> six months rather than six weeks. Henry was somewhat mollified, after the convention voted on June 21 to ratify the Constitution, {{by the fact that the}} convention then proposed about 40 amendments; some of them were later incorporated in the Bill of Rights. George Mason, Henry's ally in opposing ratification, intended a fiery diatribe on the faults of the new plan of government; he was talked out of it. By one account, Henry told other opponents that he had done his duty in opposing ratifications, and as republicans, with the issues settled in a democratic way, they had best all go home. Madison wrote to Washington that Henry still hoped for amendments to weaken the power of the federal government, possibly to be proposed by a second national convention.|$|E

500|$|There {{are also}} {{differences}} in how this new age is envisioned. Those adhering to what Hanegraaff termed the [...] "moderate" [...] perspective believed {{that it would be}} marked by an improvement to current society, which affected both New Age concerns—through the convergence of science and mysticism and the global embrace of alternative medicine—to more general concerns, including an end to violence, crime and war, a healthier environment, and international co-operation. Other New Agers adopt a fully utopian vision, believing that the world will be wholly transformed into an [...] "Age of Light", with humans evolving into totally spiritual beings and experiencing unlimited love, bliss, and happiness. Rather than conceiving of the Age of Aquarius as an indefinite period, many believe that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>last</b> for around two thousand years before being replaced by a further age.|$|E
500|$|The {{success of}} Just Dance {{led to the}} {{development}} of a sequel, Just Dance 2, which focused on adding new features and refinements to the game—such as improvements to its motion tracking system, new game modes, and support for downloadable content. Sales of Just Dance 2 surpassed that of the original; with over 5 million copies as of January 2011, it was the best-selling third-party title for the Wii. Laurent Detoc, CEO of Ubisoft's North American operations, stated that this achievement [...] " [...] the Just Dance brand as a pop culture phenomenon." [...] Poix felt that [...] "there's a pressure within Ubisoft to keep Just Dance enormous, and we think we can make it enormous. But it wasn't like that initially, because at the end of the first one, people—even us—had our doubts that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>last.</b> After the first one we thought maybe there would be a second one, and then it would be over." ...|$|E
500|$|A team of commissioners, {{including}} former Civil War general and civil engineer Thomas A. Morris, planned and oversaw the project. The structure {{was designed by}} Edwin May, an Indianapolis architect. Not wanting to repeat the mistakes made {{in the construction of}} the previous statehouse, the legislature required the new capitol to be built on a solid foundation, so that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>last</b> for many decades. Construction began in 1880 and the cornerstone was laid on September 28. Edwin May died in February of that year, and Adolph Sherrer supervised the project for the entire construction period. The interior was modeled in the Italian Renaissance style. [...] Wherever possible, materials native to Indiana were used. Doors were made of Indiana oak, and Indiana limestone was used throughout the structure. The building's cornerstone is a ten-ton block of limestone quarried in Spencer, Indiana. The central dome was completed in 1883. The building was also wired for electricity, even though Indianapolis did not yet have an electrical power grid. In 1887, the new capitol was sufficiently finished for the first legislative session to be held there. Construction ultimately endured eight years, and the building was finally completed in October 1888. With the pinnacle of the building reaching [...] high, it was the second tallest building in the state at the time of its completion.|$|E

500|$|Akira Toriyama loosely modeled Dragon Ball on {{the classic}} Chinese novel Journey to the West; but also redeveloped it from his 1983 {{one-shot}} manga Dragon Boy. He {{has said that the}} fighting was influenced from movies by famous martial arts actor Jackie Chan, as he wanted to create a story with the basic theme of Journey to the West, but with [...] "a little kung fu." [...] Since it was serialized in a shōnen magazine, he added the idea of the Dragon Balls to give it a game-like activity of gathering something, without thinking of what the characters would wish for. With Goku being Sun Wukong, Bulma as Xuanzang, Oolong as Zhu Bajie and Yamcha being Sha Wujing, he originally thought <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>last</b> about a year or end once the Dragon Balls were collected. Toriyama stated that although the stories are purposefully easy to understand, he specifically aimed Dragon Ball at readers older than those of his previous serial Dr. Slump. He also wanted to break from the Western influences common in Dr. Slump, deliberately going for Chinese scenery, referencing Chinese buildings and photographs of China his wife had bought. The island where the Tenkaichi Budōkai is held is modeled after Bali, which he, his wife and assistant visited in mid-1985, and for the area around Bobbidi's spaceship he consulted photos of Africa.|$|E
