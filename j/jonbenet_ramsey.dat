500|$|The {{lyrics of}} the song refer to vampires and werewolves: [...] "Run run her kiss is a vampire grin/The moon lights her way while she's howlin' at him". Gaga {{explained}} that the lines were means of expressing how people rely on external motivations to cope with internal anxiety. [...] "She doesn't feel free without the moon," [...] Gaga said. [...] "These lyrics are a {{way for me to}} talk about how I believe women and some men feel innately insecure about themselves all the time. It's not sometimes, it's not in adolescence, it's always." [...] The spoken interlude refers to famous people who met with a tragic end of their lives, namely Marilyn Monroe, Judy Garland, Sylvia Plath, <b>JonBenét</b> <b>Ramsey,</b> Liberace, Jesus, Stanley Kubrick, and Princess Diana.|$|E
500|$|Roger Wilkins, {{a history}} {{professor}} at George Mason University who studies race in the United States, said [...] "Blood Ties" [...] provided [...] "insightful, wonderful explorations on the complexities of many levels of race." [...] He also said the show [...] "really does understand how we're all caught in this culture, and we're all struggling with it. And we all bring to this jagged enterprise the limited understanding of where we came from and who we are. Being fully alive requires us to struggle with these realities. That's what the show does." [...] In his journal article about the portrayal of African American men in Homicide: Life on the Street, documentary historian Thomas A. Mascaro said the presentation of light-skinned black villains like Luther Mahoney and dark-skinned actors like the one played by James Earl Jones in [...] "Blood Ties", [...] "dispels the notion that black skin color is uniform or determinative with regard to character". Some media outlets described the Watson subplot as a racial spin on the 1996 murder of six-year-old child beauty pageant queen <b>JonBenét</b> <b>Ramsey,</b> although Tom Fontana said any similarities were not intended.|$|E

2500|$|A Colorado {{grand jury}} had voted in 1999 to indict the parents. The {{indictment}} cited [...] "two counts each of child abuse" [...] {{and said the}} parents [...] "did unlawfully, knowingly, recklessly and feloniously permit a child to be unreasonably placed {{in a situation that}} posed a threat of injury to the child's life or health, which resulted in the death of <b>JonBenét</b> <b>Ramsey,</b> a child under the age of sixteen." [...] Among the experts in the case were DNA specialist Barry Scheck and forensic expert Dr. Henry Lee. On October 13, 1999, Alex Hunter, who was the district attorney at the time, refused to sign the indictment, saying that the evidence was insufficient. This left the impression that the grand jury investigation had been inconclusive. In 2002, the statute of limitations on the charges expired. The indictment was not known publicly until October 25, 2013, when previously sealed court documents were released.|$|E
2500|$|<b>JonBenét</b> Patricia <b>Ramsey</b> ( [...] ; August 6, 1990 – December 25 or 26, 1996) was an American child {{beauty pageant}} queen {{who was killed}} in her family's home in Boulder, Colorado, on the night of December 25–26, 1996, at the age of six. A lengthy ransom note was found in the house, and her father, John <b>Ramsey,</b> found <b>JonBenét's</b> body in the {{basement}} of their house about eight hours after she was reported missing. She sustained a broken skull from a blow to the head and had been strangled; a garrote was found tied around her neck. The autopsy report stated that the official cause of death was [...] "asphyxia by strangulation associated with craniocerebral trauma". Her death was classified as a homicide. The case generated nationwide public and media interest, in part because her mother Patsy Ramsey (herself a former beauty queen) had entered JonBenét in a series of child beauty pageants. The case still remains an open investigation with the Boulder Police Department.|$|R
5000|$|John and Patsy Ramsey were sued in two {{separate}} defamation lawsuits arising from the publication of their book, The Death of Innocence. These suits were brought by two persons named in the book as having been investigated by Boulder police as suspects in <b>JonBenét's</b> murder. The <b>Ramseys</b> were defended in those lawsuits by Lin Wood and three other Atlanta attorneys, James C. Rawls, Eric P. Schroeder, and S. Derek Bauer, who obtained dismissal of both lawsuits, including an in-depth decision by U.S. District Court Judge Julie Carnes that [...] "abundant evidence" [...] pointed to an intruder who committed the murder.|$|R
40|$|<b>JonBenet</b> Patricia <b>Ramsey</b> was a six {{year old}} rising {{star in the}} beauty pageant world when she was found brutally murdered in the {{basement}} of her home in Boulder, Colorado on December 26, 1996. Nineteen years later, the crime remains unsolved and no convictions have ever been made in the case. This could mainly be attributed {{to the fact that the}} Boulder Police Department was extremely inexperienced when it came to homicides, so they did not follow through with typical crime scene procedure when they responded to the 911 call. Also, they did not accept help from more experienced agencies, such as the Denver Police Department, available nearby. This paper reviews and analyzes the procedural mistakes made by the Boulder Police Department in Boulder, Colorado throughout the course of the kidnapping and subsequent murder investigation. These mistakes are specified and interpreted as to how the department should have handled the investigation in order to protect and preserve the crime scene evidence that was eventually damaged due to carelessness. Next, the theory of the main suspects, John and Patsy Ramsey, as well as a possible intruder are discussed while addressing the physical and circumstantial evidence gathered during the case and how the mistakes of the police investigation might have hindered a conviction. Finally, the paper indicates what former criminal profiler, John Douglas, ultimately believed happened to the miniature beauty queen. Honors CollegeThesis (B. ?...|$|R
2500|$|The {{final cut}} of The Fame Monster {{contains}} eight tracks {{on the standard}} edition. The record displays Gaga's taste for pastiche, drawing on [...] "Seventies arena glam, perky ABBA disco, and sugary throwbacks like Stacey Q" [...] according to Rolling Stone. Neil McCormick from The Daily Telegraph felt that while not as thematically unified as its predecessor, The Fame Monster had engaging songs composed by virtue of Gaga's [...] "vivacious energy, bold melodies and almost comically relentless sensationalism". The lyrics contain zombie metaphors in songs like [...] "Monster" [...] ("He ate my heart..."), the Cossack like music in [...] "Teeth" [...] ("Take a bite of my bad-girl meat...") and [...] "Dance in the Dark" [...] ("Silicone, saline, poison, inject me..."). The latter's lyrics also refer to famous people who met a tragic end: Marilyn Monroe, Judy Garland, Sylvia Plath, Princess Diana, Liberace and <b>JonBenét</b> <b>Ramsey.</b> Recording sessions were held in Los Angeles, London, Osaka, and Amsterdam. Four of the songs were primarily produced by RedOne, with additional productions on the other songs by Ron Fair, Fernando Garibay, Tal Herzberg, Rodney [...] "Darkchild" [...] Jerkins, Teddy Riley and Space Cowboy. Gaga was the co-producer on all the tracks.|$|E
