5|$|Father Sébastien Rale {{was widely}} {{suspected}} of inciting the Norridgewock tribe against the New Englanders, and Massachusetts Governor Joseph Dudley {{put a price}} on <b>his</b> <b>head.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> winter of 1705, 275 British soldiers under the command of Colonel Winthrop Hilton were dispatched to seize Rale and sack the village. The priest was warned in time, however, and escaped into the woods with his papers, but the militia burned the village and church.|$|E
5|$|He re-invented the {{practice}} of stiff-arming his tacklers, which {{had gone out of}} favor among running backs in the 1970s. At times, he used his high school experience as a long jumper to leap over his opponents, landing on <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> end zone to gain a touchdown in a game against the Buffalo Bills. His running gait was somewhat unusual, as his knees were minimally bent, and the motion was largely powered from the hip. This may have given his knees, a football player's most vulnerable joints, some protection, although he underwent arthroscopic surgery on both knees in 1983. He referred to this procedure as an 11,000-yard checkup.|$|E
5|$|In the 1685 Monmouth Rebellion, {{the rebel}} James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth was proclaimed King on the Cornhill in Bridgwater {{and in other}} local towns. He {{eventually}} led his troops on a night-time attack on the King's position near Westonzoyland. Surprise was lost when a musket was accidentally discharged, and the Battle of Sedgemoor resulted in defeat for the Duke. He later lost <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Tower of London, and nine locals were executed for treason.|$|E

5|$|The {{first major}} {{action of the}} race {{occurred}} as the riders approached the first ascent of the Mur de Huy. Dan Martin, one of the favourites for the race, touched wheels with Tiago Machado (Katusha) and both riders crashed. Martin returned to his bike and chased back to the peloton {{with the help of}} several teammates, but later withdrew. He had hit <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> crash and wished to recover ahead of the Liège–Bastogne–Liège the following weekend. Several other riders were caught up or delayed, including Chris Froome. At the top of the first ascent of the Mur, the breakaway's lead had been cut to under six minutes.|$|E
5|$|Lion taming {{refers to}} the {{practice}} of taming lions for entertainment, either as part of an established circus or as an individual act, such as Siegfried & Roy. The term is also often used for the taming and display of other big cats such as tigers, leopards, and cougars. The practice was pioneered {{in the first half of}} the nineteenth century by Frenchman Henri Martin and American Isaac Van Amburgh who both toured widely, and whose techniques were copied by a number of followers. Van Amburgh performed before Queen Victoria in 1838 when he toured Great Britain. Martin composed a pantomime titled Les Lions de Mysore ("the lions of Mysore"), an idea that Amburgh quickly borrowed. These acts eclipsed equestrianism acts as the central display of circus shows, but truly entered public consciousness in the early twentieth century with cinema. In demonstrating the superiority of human over animal, lion taming served a purpose similar to animal fights of previous centuries. The ultimate proof of a tamer's dominance and control over a lion is demonstrated by placing <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lion's mouth. The now iconic lion tamer's chair was possibly first used by American Clyde Beatty (1903–1965).|$|E
5|$|Male mole crickets sing by stridulating, always underground. In Gryllotalpa gryllotalpa {{the song}} {{is based on an}} almost pure tone at 3.5 kiloHertz, loud enough to make the ground vibrate 20cm all round the burrow; in fact {{the song is}} unique in each species. In Gryllotalpa gryllotalpa the burrow is {{somewhat}} roughly sculpted; in Gryllotalpa vineae, the burrow is smooth and carefully shaped, with no irregularities larger than 1 millimetre. In both species the burrow {{takes the form of a}} double exponential horn with twin openings at the soil surface; at the other end there is a constriction, then a resonating bulb, and then an escape tunnel. A burrow is used for at least a week. The male positions himself head down with <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bulb, his tail near the fork in the tunnel.|$|E

5|$|McKnight {{was born}} in Cranbury Township in the colonial Province of New Jersey in 1750. His only sibling was his younger brother, Richard. His father, also named Charles McKnight, emigrated to the colonies from Ireland {{sometime}} around 1740 and was ordained as a Presbyterian minister in 1742. He became a minister of some note, {{and was one of}} the founders and trustees of the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University). Reverend McKnight opposed British governance in Colonial America and was a loud voice for opposition and overthrow of the British government in New Jersey. According to Martha J. Lamb, Reverend McKnight received a severe saber cut to <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> slashing melee that mortally wounded General Hugh Mercer at the Battle of Princeton. His church at Middletown Point was burned in 1777 and Reverend McKnight was arrested. While in custody aboard the British prison ship HMS Jersey in New York City, Rev. McKnight's health rapidly failed, and he was released shortly before his death on January 1, 1778.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} known {{story to}} feature a beheading game is the 8th-century Middle Irish tale Bricriu's Feast. This story parallels Gawain in that, like the Green Knight, Cú Chulainn's antagonist feints three blows with the axe before letting his target depart without injury. A beheading exchange also {{appears in the}} late 12th-century Life of Caradoc, a Middle French narrative embedded in the anonymous First Continuation of Chrétien de Troyes' Perceval, the Story of the Grail. A notable difference in this story is that Caradoc's challenger is his father in disguise, come to test his honour. Lancelot is given a beheading challenge in the early 13th-century Perlesvaus, in which a knight begs him to chop off his head or else put his own in jeopardy. Lancelot reluctantly cuts it off, agreeing {{to come to the}} same place in a year to put <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same danger. When Lancelot arrives, the people of the town celebrate and announce that they have finally found a true knight, because many others had failed this test of chivalry.|$|E
25|$|Lamson {{designed}} and built the Quark in 1964 as a lighthearted experimental aircraft project to create a prone position-pilot glider. To this end the pilot was accommodated lying down with <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nose bubble.|$|E

25|$|October 12, 2008, {{they claimed}} their second United Soccer Leagues First Division {{championship}} with a 2–1 {{victory over the}} Puerto Rico Islanders. Charles Gbeke scored twice with <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second half to help secure the title. In 2009, they placed 7th {{in the league and}} were eliminated in the final by the Montreal Impact on a 6–3 aggregate.|$|E
25|$|In 1801 he {{commanded}} the 90th Foot when they landed at Aboukir Bay in Egypt {{as part of}} a force under Sir Ralph Abercromby: Hill was seriously wounded in the action when a musket ball hit <b>his</b> <b>head.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> ensuing weeks Hill helped drive the French forces out of Egypt. Hill became a brigadier in 1803 and a major-general on 2 November 1805.|$|E
25|$|Campese and Ackerman had {{encountered}} a few personal scrapes {{with one another}} during different moments of their careers. Ackerman had previously played club rugby in Canberra not long before the Barbarians game, and according to Mark Ella in his book, Running Rugby, the two men did not get along with each other. After the Wallabies 1984 win against Wales at Cardiff Arms Park, Campese claimed Ackerman had buried <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dirt during the game, adding {{to a sense of}} tension between the two.|$|E

25|$|The hotel's {{security}} staff continued following {{the party for}} a short distance outside the hotel. In the altercation that followed one of the bouncers, Zdravko Mićević, punched Hookes. He fell to the ground, hitting <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> process, and went into cardiac arrest. He was revived by paramedics but did not regain consciousness. He was taken to Melbourne's Alfred Hospital and placed on life support. The following evening, after family and friends had said their goodbyes, Hookes was taken off life support and died soon after. Hookes was an organ donor and 10 people received transplanted organs.|$|E
25|$|Powell {{decided to}} return to Surratt's {{boarding}} house to seek help. His clothes were somewhat bloody from the attack at Seward's home, and he'd dropped his hat at the Seward home. During much of the Victorian era, it was considered unseemly for any man (even a menial laborer) to be seen in public without a hat, and Powell would have been viewed with suspicion had he tried to enter the city without one. Ripping the sleeve from his undershirt, Powell placed the sleeve on <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hope that people would think it was a stocking cap. To complete his disguise as a common laborer, he then stole a pickaxe from a farmyard. Powell then headed for Surratt's.|$|E
25|$|The Summers fight {{took part}} at the National Sporting Club in Covent Garden, with a purse of £2,200 and the Lonsdale Belt at stake. Welsh took {{control in the}} first round and never let Summers into the fight. One {{reporter}} counted 200 successful blows to Summers head during the match, and he was bleeding as early as the third round. During the fight, some members of the crowd jeered Welsh's use of the kidney punch, which although not outlawed at the time was seen as unsporting; he was also cautioned by the referee for the use of <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fifth. The fight went the distance, with Welsh winning on points; in taking the Lonsdale Belt he was the pride of Wales and America, but many in the boxing fraternity of England saw in Welsh a cynical, cold and cruel fighter.|$|E

25|$|On {{at least}} one occasion, a sports-writing {{assignment}} actually took Masterson {{out of the country}} to Cuba. On April 5, 1915, the 61-year-old Bat Masterson was in Havana, Cuba, attending the heavyweight championship fight between Jack Johnson and Jess Willard. As he arrived, he posed for a newsreel cameraman. He was now quite portly. The mustache of his younger days was long gone along with most of the hair on top of <b>his</b> <b>head.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> brief film clip, he removes his hat, smiles for the camera, and replaces the hat on his head. Twenty-eight stills from this film can be viewed in a 1984 book on Masterson. Later that day, in the official film made of the fight, Bat can be seen as one of the seconds for Jess Willard, climbing through the ropes just {{prior to the start of}} the fight.|$|E
25|$|The estate at Hensol dates {{at least}} from the early 15th century and Hensol House (now Grade I listed Hensol Castle) was built in the 16th century. It has been home to a {{succession}} of eminent people including Judge David Jenkins (1582–1663) the staunch royalist who nearly lost <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> civil war, Charles Talbot (1685–1737) who served in Walpole's government becoming Lord Chancellor in 1733 and taking the title Baron Talbot of Hensol, Benjamin Hall (1778–1817), whose son became Baron Lanover and may have given his name to the Palace of Westminster's “Big Ben”, the “Iron King” of Merthyr Tydfil William Crawshay II (1788–1867) who later built Cyfarthfa Castle, another ironmaster, Rowland Fothergill (1794–1871) of Abernant who in 1853 commissioned David Brandon to rebuild Pendoylan Parish Church and his sister Mary (1797–1887) who built and endowed a new school building for Pendoylan in his memory in 1873.|$|E
500|$|For the cape, {{director}} Christopher Nolan {{wanted to}} have a [...] "flowing cloak... that blows and flows as in so many great graphic novels". Hemming's team created the cape out of their own version of parachute nylon that had electrostatic flocking, a process shared with the team by the British Ministry of Defence. The process was used by the London police force to minimize night vision detection. The cape was topped by a cowl, which was designed by Nolan, Hemming, and costume effects supervisor Graham Churchyard. The cowl was created to be thin enough to allow motion but thick enough to avoid wrinkling when Bale turned <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Batsuit. Churchyard explained the cowl had been designed to show [...] "a man who has angst", so his character would be revealed through the mask.|$|E
