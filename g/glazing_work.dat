One {{of these is}} Gail Crawford's book Studio Ceramics in Canada, a standard reference text published {{with the assistance of}} the Gardiner Museum, the only museum in Canada dedicated to ceramic art. The text discusses and illustrates Canadian ceramic art work and ceramic artists in Canada. Kirsten Abrahamson's <b>glazing</b> <b>work</b> has also been used for illustrative purposes in two books by professional studio potter Robin Hopper. In 2012 her work was featured by the Jonathon Bancroft-Snell Gallery's promotion in Ceramics Monthly.|$|E
40|$|Statement of Problem: Ceramic restorations {{are popular}} {{because they can}} provide the most natural {{replacement}} for teeth. However, the brittleness of ceramics is a primary disadvantage. There are various methods for strengthening ceramics such as metal framework, ceramic cores, and surface strengthening mechanisms through <b>glazing,</b> <b>work</b> hardening and ion exchange. Purpose: The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the effect of polish on flexural strength of feldspathic porcelain and to compare it with overglaze and autoglaze. Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, one brand of feldspathic porcelain (colorlogic, Ceramco) was used and forty bars (25 × 6 × 3 mm) were prepared according to ISO 6872 and ADA No. 69. The specimens were randomly divided into four groups: overglazed, auto glazed, fine polish and coarse polish (clinic polish). Flexural strength of each specimen was determined by three point bending test (Universal Testing Machine, Zwick 1494, Germany). Collected data was analyzed by ANOVA and post-hoc test with P< 0. 05 as the limit of significance. Results: A significant difference was observed among the studied groups (P< 0. 0001). According to post-hoc test, flexural strength in overglaze and fine polish group were significantly stronger than clinic polish and autoglaze group (P< 0. 001). Although the mean value for overglazed group was higher than fine polish group, this was not statistically significant (P= 0. 9). Also no statistical difference was seen between autoglazed and coarse polish group (P= 0. 2). Conclusion: Based on the findings of this study, flexural strength achieved by fine polish (used in this study) can compete with overglazing the feldespathic porcelains. It also can be concluded that a final finishing procedure that involves fine polishing may be preferred to simple staining followed by self-glazing...|$|E

50|$|After the Medes were overthrown by the Persians as the {{dominant}} force in ancient Iran, Assyria was ruled by the Persian Achaemenid Empire (as Athura) from 549 BC to 330 BC (see Achaemenid Assyria). The Assyrians of Mada (Media) and Athura (Assyria) had been responsible for gold and <b>glazing</b> <b>works</b> of the palace and for providing Lebanese cedar timber, respectively. The city and region of Ashur had once more gained a degree of militaristic and economic strength. Along with the Assyrians in Mada, a revolt took place in 520 BC but ultimately failed. Assyria seems to have recovered dramatically, and flourished during this period. It became a major agricultural and administrative centre of the Achaemenid Empire, and its soldiers were a mainstay of the Persian Army.|$|R

The manufacture de Nast was also in the forefront of developing new highly pigmented color <b>glazes.</b> <b>Working</b> with French chemist Louis Vauquelin, the first to isolate the element chromium in 1797 created an intense malachite green glaze called viridian that was able to remain stable at very high temperatures.|$|R

Neither Luca nor Andrea was in the habit of signing his work, but Giovanni often did so, usually adding the date, probably because other potters had begun to imitate the Robbia ware. Examples of these imitations are a retable in the Basilica of San Lucchese near Poggibonsi dated 1514, another of the Madonna and Saints at Monte San Savino of 1525, and a third in the Capuchin church of Arceria near Senigallia. Some of them may have been made by assistants trained in the Robbia workshops.|$|R
