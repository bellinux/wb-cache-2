5|$|Most of {{the risk}} factors for endometrial cancer involve high levels of estrogens. An {{estimated}} 40% of cases {{are thought to be}} related to obesity. In obesity, the excess of adipose tissue increases conversion of androstenedione into <b>estrone,</b> an estrogen. Higher levels of <b>estrone</b> in the blood causes less or no ovulation and exposes the endometrium to continuously high levels of estrogens. Obesity also causes less estrogen to be removed from the blood. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), which also causes irregular or no ovulation, is associated with higher rates of endometrial cancer for the same reasons as obesity. Specifically, obesity, typeII diabetes, and insulin resistance are risk factors for TypeI endometrial cancer. Obesity increases the risk for endometrial cancer by 300–400%.|$|E
25|$|Inhibition of the {{conversion}} of estradiol to <b>estrone,</b> resulting {{in an increase in}} the ratio of circulating estradiol to <b>estrone.</b> Estradiol is far more potent than <b>estrone</b> as an estrogen, which is comparatively almost inactive.|$|E
25|$|A {{review of}} {{activated}} sludge plant performance found estrogen removal rates varied considerably but averaged 78% for <b>estrone,</b> 91% for estradiol, and 76% for ethinylestradiol (estriol effluent concentrations are between those of <b>estrone</b> and estradiol, but estriol is a much less potent endocrine disruptor to fish).|$|E
25|$|Estradiol is {{reported}} to be approximately 12times as potent as <b>estrone</b> and 80times as potent as estriol in its estrogenic activity. As such, estradiol is the main estrogen in the body, although the roles of <b>estrone</b> and estriol as estrogens are said to not be negligible.|$|E
25|$|During the {{reproductive}} years, most estradiol in women {{is produced by}} the granulosa cells of the ovaries by the aromatization of Δ4-androstenedione (produced in the theca folliculi cells) to <b>estrone,</b> followed by conversion of <b>estrone</b> to estradiol by 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase. Smaller amounts of estradiol are also produced by the adrenal cortex, and, in men, by the testes.|$|E
25|$|A woman using COCPs excretes {{from her}} urine and feces natural estrogens, <b>estrone</b> (E1) and {{estradiol}} (E2), and synthetic estrogen ethinylestradiol (EE2).|$|E
25|$|Estradiol, <b>estrone,</b> and estriol {{have all}} been {{approved}} as pharmaceutical drugs and are used medically. Estetrol is currently under development for medical indications, but {{has not yet been}} approved in any country. A variety of synthetic estrogen esters, such as estradiol valerate, estradiol cypionate, estradiol acetate, estradiol undecylate, polyestradiol phosphate, and estradiol benzoate, are used clinically. The aforementioned compounds behave as prodrugs to estradiol, and are longer-lasting in comparison. Esters of <b>estrone</b> and estriol also exist and are employed in clinical medicine.|$|E
25|$|Ethinylestradiol (EE) is a {{more potent}} {{synthetic}} analogue of estradiol that is used widely in hormonal contraceptives. Mestranol, moxestrol, and quinestrol are derivatives of EE used clinically. A related drug is methylestradiol, which is also used clinically. Conjugated equine estrogens (CEEs), such as Premarin, a commonly prescribed estrogenic drug produced from the urine of pregnant mares, include the natural steroidal estrogens equilin and equilenin, as well as, especially, <b>estrone</b> sulfate (which itself is inactive and becomes active upon conversion into <b>estrone).</b> A related and very similar product to CEEs is esterified estrogens (EEs).|$|E
25|$|The {{three major}} {{naturally}} occurring estrogens in women are <b>estrone</b> (E1), estradiol (E2), and estriol (E3). Estradiol is the predominant estrogen during reproductive years {{both in terms}} of absolute serum levels as well as in terms of estrogenic activity. During menopause, <b>estrone</b> is the predominant circulating estrogen and during pregnancy estriol is the predominant circulating estrogen in terms of serum levels. Though estriol is the most plentiful of the three estrogens it is also the weakest, whereas estradiol is the strongest with a potency of approximately 80 times that of estriol. Thus, estradiol is the most important estrogen in non-pregnant females who are between the menarche and menopause stages of life. However, during pregnancy this role shifts to estriol, and in postmenopausal women <b>estrone</b> becomes the primary form of estrogen in the body. Another type of estrogen called estetrol (E4) is produced only during pregnancy. All of the different forms of estrogen are synthesized from androgens, specifically testosterone and androstenedione, by the enzyme aromatase.|$|E
25|$|Androstenedione (Andro): an {{androgenic}} steroid {{produced by}} the testes, adrenal cortex, and ovaries. While androstenediones are converted metabolically to testosterone and other androgens, {{they are also the}} parent structure of <b>estrone.</b>|$|E
25|$|Adipose tissue {{possesses}} aromatase, {{an enzyme}} that converts androstenedione to <b>estrone</b> and testosterone to estradiol. The excess of adipose tissue in obese women creates {{the paradox of}} having both excess androgens (which are responsible for hirsutism and virilization) and estrogens (which inhibits FSH via negative feedback).|$|E
25|$|At a {{high dosage}} of 1,600mg/day orally for 4weeks, {{treatment}} of postmenopausal women with prasterone {{has been found}} to increase serum levels of DHEA by 15-fold, testosterone by 9-fold, DHEA-S, androstenedione (A4), and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) all by 20-fold, and <b>estrone</b> and estradiol both by 2-fold.|$|E
25|$|Estradiol is also metabolized via {{hydroxylation}} into catechol estrogens. In the liver, it is non-specifically metabolized by CYP1A2, CYP3A4, and CYP2C9 via 2-hydroxylation into 2-hydroxyestradiol, and by CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2C8 via 17β-hydroxy dehydrogenation into <b>estrone,</b> {{with various}} other cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes and metabolic transformations also being involved.|$|E
25|$|Estrogens are metabolized via {{hydroxylation}} by cytochrome P450 enzymes such as CYP1A1 and CYP3A4 and via conjugation by estrogen sulfotransferases (sulfation) and UDP-glucuronyltransferases (glucuronidation). In addition, estradiol is dehydrogenated by 17β-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase {{into the}} much less potent estrogen <b>estrone.</b> These reactions occur {{primarily in the}} liver, but also in other tissues.|$|E
25|$|During the {{reproductive}} {{years of the}} human female, levels of estradiol are somewhat {{higher than that of}} <b>estrone,</b> except during the early follicular phase of the menstrual cycle; thus, estradiol may be considered the predominant estrogen during human female reproductive years in terms of absolute serum levels and estrogenic activity. During pregnancy, estriol becomes the predominant circulating estrogen, and this is the only time at which estetrol occurs in the body, while during menopause, <b>estrone</b> predominates (both based on serum levels). The estradiol produced by male humans, from testosterone, is present at serum levels roughly comparable to those of postmenopausal women (14-55 versus <35 pg/mL, respectively). It has also been reported that if concentrations of estradiol in a 70-year-old man are compared to those of a 70-year-old woman, levels are approximately 2- to 4-fold higher in the man.|$|E
25|$|In females, {{synthesis}} of estrogens starts in theca interna {{cells in the}} ovary, by the {{synthesis of}} androstenedione from cholesterol. Androstenedione is a substance of weak androgenic activity which serves predominantly as a precursor for more potent androgens such as testosterone as well as estrogen. This compound crosses the basal membrane into the surrounding granulosa cells, where it is converted either immediately into <b>estrone,</b> or into testosterone and then estradiol in an additional step. The conversion of androstenedione to testosterone is catalyzed by 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17β-HSD), whereas the conversion of androstenedione and testosterone into <b>estrone</b> and estradiol, respectively is catalyzed by aromatase, enzymes which are both expressed in granulosa cells. In contrast, granulosa cells lack 17α-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase, whereas theca cells express these enzymes and 17β-HSD but lack aromatase. Hence, both granulosa and theca cells are essential {{for the production of}} estrogen in the ovaries.|$|E
25|$|Androstenedione (A4) is an {{androgenic}} steroid {{produced by}} the testes, adrenal cortex, and ovaries. While androstenediones are converted metabolically to testosterone and other androgens, {{they are also the}} parent structure of <b>estrone.</b> Use of androstenedione as an athletic or bodybuilding supplement has been banned by the International Olympic Committee, as well as other sporting organizations.|$|E
25|$|Estradiol, {{like other}} steroids, {{is derived from}} cholesterol. After side chain {{cleavage}} and using the Δ5 or the Δ4- pathway, Δ4-androstenedione is the key intermediary. A portion of the Δ4-androstenedione is converted to testosterone, which in turn undergoes conversion to estradiol by aromatase. In an alternative pathway, Δ4-androstenedione is aromatized to <b>estrone,</b> which is subsequently converted to estradiol.|$|E
25|$|Estradiol, {{the most}} potent {{of the three major}} estrogens, was the last of the three to be identified. It was {{discovered}} by Schwenk and Hildebrant in 1933, who synthesized it via reduction of <b>estrone.</b> Estradiol was subsequently isolated and purified from sow ovaries by Doisy in 1935, with its chemical structure determined simultaneously, and was referred to variously as dihydrotheelin, dihydrofolliculin, and dihydroxyestrin. In 1935, the name estradiol and the term estrogen were formally established by the Sex Hormone Committee of the Health Organization of the League of Nations; this followed the names <b>estrone</b> (which was initially called theelin, progynon, folliculin, and ketohydroxyestrin) and estriol (initially called theelol and trihydroxyestrin) having been established in 1932 at the first meeting of the International Conference on the Standardization of Sex Hormones in London. Following its discovery, a partial synthesis of estradiol from cholesterol was developed by Inhoffen and Hohlweg in 1940, and a total synthesis was developed by Anner and Miescher in 1948.|$|E
25|$|Inactivation of {{estradiol}} includes {{conversion to}} less-active estrogens, such as <b>estrone</b> and estriol. Estriol {{is the major}} urinary metabolite. Estradiol is conjugated in the liver to form estrogen conjugates like estradiol sulfate, estradiol glucuronide and, as such, excreted via the kidneys. Some of the water-soluble conjugates are excreted via the bile duct, and partly reabsorbed after hydrolysis from the intestinal tract. This enterohepatic circulation contributes to maintaining estradiol levels.|$|E
25|$|Estradiol is an estrane (C18) steroid. It is {{also known}} as 17β-estradiol (to {{distinguish}} it from 17α-estradiol) or as estra-1,3,5(10)-triene-3,17β-diol. It has two hydroxyl groups, one at the C3 position and the other at the 17β position, as well as three double bonds in the A ring. Due to its two hydroxyl groups, estradiol is often abbreviated as E2. The structurally related estrogens, <b>estrone</b> (E1), estriol (E3), and estetrol (E4) have one, three, and four hydroxyl groups, respectively.|$|E
25|$|Estradiol is {{produced}} especially within the follicles {{of the female}} ovaries, but also in other endocrine (i.e., hormone-producing) and nonendocrine tissues (e.g., including fat, liver, adrenal, breast, and neural tissues). Estradiol is biosynthesized from cholesterol {{through a series of}} chemical intermediates. One principal pathway involves the generation of androstenedione, which is converted into <b>estrone</b> by aromatase and then by 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase into estradiol. Alternatively, androstenedione can be converted into testosterone, an androgen and the primary male sex hormone, which in turn can be aromatized into estradiol.|$|E
25|$|Persistently {{increased}} {{blood levels}} of estrogen are {{associated with an increased}} risk of breast cancer, as are increased levels of the androgens androstenedione and testosterone (which can be directly converted by aromatase to the estrogens <b>estrone</b> and estradiol, respectively). Increased {{blood levels of}} progesterone are associated with a decreased risk of breast cancer in premenopausal women. A number of circumstances which increase exposure to endogenous estrogens including not having children, delaying first childbirth, not breastfeeding, early menarche (the first menstrual period) and late menopause are suspected of increasing lifetime risk for developing breast cancer.|$|E
25|$|In 1931, Butenandt {{found that}} the benzoic acid ester of <b>estrone</b> had a {{prolonged}} duration of action. Subsequently, Schwenk and Hildebrant synthesized estradiol benzoate from estradiol in 1933, and estradiol benzoate was introduced by Schering-Kahlbaum for medical use via intramuscular injection under the brand name Progynon-B in 1936. It was the first estrogen ester to be marketed, and has since been followed by many additional esters, for instance estradiol valerate and estradiol cypionate in the 1950s. Ethinylestradiol was synthesized from estradiol by Inhoffen and Hohlweg in 1938 and was introduced for oral use by Schering in the United States under the brand name Estinyl in 1943. It remains widely used in combined oral contraceptives.|$|E
25|$|Spironolactone {{has been}} found to act as a {{reversible}} inhibitor of human 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 2 (17β-HSD2), albeit with weak potency (Ki = 0.25–2.4μM; IC50 = 0.27–1.1μM). C7α thioalkyl derivatives of spironolactone like the 7α-thioethyl analogue were found to inhibit the enzyme with greater potency, suggesting that the actual active metabolites of spironolactone like 7α-TMS might be more potent inhibitors. 17β-HSD2 is a key enzyme responsible for inactivation of estradiol into <b>estrone</b> in various tissues, and inhibition of 17β-HSD2 by spironolactone may be involved in the gynecomastia and altered ratio of circulating testosterone to estradiol that the drug is associated with. Spironolactone has also been associated with positive effects on bone, and it is notable that 17β-HSD2 inhibitors are under investigation as potential novel treatments for osteoporosis due to their ability to prevent estradiol inactivation in this tissue.|$|E
25|$|Estradiol acts {{primarily}} as an agonist of the estrogen receptor (ER), a nuclear steroid hormone receptor. There are two subtypes of the ER, ERα and ERβ, and estradiol potently binds to and activates {{both of these}} receptors. The result of ER activation is a modulation of gene transcription and expression in ER-expressing cells, which is the predominant mechanism by which estradiol mediates its biological effects in the body. Estradiol also acts as an agonist of membrane estrogen receptors (mERs), such as GPER (GPR30), a recently discovered non-nuclear receptor for estradiol, via which it can mediate a variety of rapid, non-genomic effects. Unlike {{the case of the}} ER, GPER appears to be selective for estradiol, and shows very low affinities for other endogenous estrogens, such as <b>estrone</b> and estriol. Additional mERs besides GPER include ER-X, ERx, and Gq-mER.|$|E
25|$|Hormones can be {{administered}} {{in a variety}} of ways, including percutaneous skin and vaginal creams, oral pills, topical gels, vaginal rings and tablets, and transdermal patches. Though all preparations of a given type of estrogen (e.g. estradiol) may be molecularly identical before their introduction into the human body, estrogens administered orally are modified by the liver before entering the bloodstream and in this process, most is converted to <b>estrone.</b> However, estrogen bypassing the digestive tract and liver and entering through the skin is not converted to a new form before entering the bloodstream. Creams and gels applied to the skin also enter the blood directly and without modification but absorption of the gels, creams, and patches can vary from application to application, depending on the temperature and condition of the skin. Pharmaceutical compounding is frequently used to modify the dose, form, and additives of the preparations, based on instructions from a health-care practitioner.|$|E
25|$|In the female, {{estradiol}} acts as {{a growth}} hormone for tissue of the reproductive organs, supporting {{the lining of the}} vagina, the cervical glands, the endometrium, and the lining of the fallopian tubes. It enhances growth of the myometrium. Estradiol appears necessary to maintain oocytes in the ovary. During the menstrual cycle, estradiol produced by the growing follicles triggers, via a positive feedback system, the hypothalamic-pituitary events that lead to the luteinizing hormone surge, inducing ovulation. In the luteal phase, estradiol, in conjunction with progesterone, prepares the endometrium for implantation. During pregnancy, estradiol increases due to placental production. The effect of estradiol, together with <b>estrone</b> and estriol, in pregnancy is less clear. They may promote uterine blood flow, myometrial growth, stimulate breast growth and at term, promote cervical softening and expression of myometrial oxytocin receptors. In baboons, blocking of estrogen production leads to pregnancy loss, suggesting estradiol has a role in the maintenance of pregnancy. Research is investigating the role of estrogens in the process of initiation of labor. Actions of estradiol are required before the exposure of progesterone in the luteal phase.|$|E

2500|$|Estrogens are {{synthesized}} in all vertebrates {{as well as}} some insects. Their {{presence in}} both vertebrates and insects suggests that estrogenic sex hormones have an ancient evolutionary history. [...] The three major naturally occurring forms of estrogen in women are <b>estrone</b> (E1), estradiol (E2), and estriol (E3). Another type of estrogen called estetrol (E4) is produced only during pregnancy. [...] Quantitatively, estrogens circulate at lower levels than androgens in both men and women. While estrogen levels are significantly lower in males compared to females, estrogens nevertheless also have important physiological roles in males.|$|E
2500|$|Typically, {{compounded}} preparations of bioidentical hormones include estriol, <b>estrone,</b> estradiol, testosterone, progesterone {{and sometimes}} dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), either individually {{or in some}} combination. They are promoted as natural, safer and (in some cases) more efficacious than CHT; however, there are no scientific studies to support claims of superiority of BHs over CHRT. [...] Estimates from sales of bulk hormones for compounding suggest {{that more than one}} million women may be using compounded BHRT in the U.S. [...] Bioidentical hormones are expected to have the same risks as conventional hormones made with the same categories of hormones.|$|E
2500|$|In premenopausal {{women the}} {{majority}} of estrogen produced by the body is estradiol (produced primarily in the ovaries), while in postmenopausal women <b>estrone</b> (produced in fat cells) {{is the type of}} estrogen present in the greatest amount; however, the body is able to convert one type of estrogen into another to a certain extent. Because of the limited research into potency, delivery methods and conversion of the various estrogens, a valid scientific understanding of compounded estrogen products has not been achieved. [...] Synthetic estradiol, taken orally, splits when absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract and delivers bioidentical estradiol to the bloodstream.|$|E
2500|$|Aromatase is {{an enzyme}} which {{converts}} some enones with a six membered ring to aromatic rings - specifically testosterone to estradiol and androstenedione to <b>estrone.</b> [...] Each of these aromatizations involves the oxidation of the C-19 methyl group to formic acid {{to allow for}} the formation of the aromatic system, conversions which are necessary parts of estrogen tumorogenesis in the development of breast cancer and ovarian cancer in postmenopausal women and gynecomastia in men. Aromatase inhibitors like exemestane (which forms a permanent and deactivating bond with the aromatase enzyme) and anastrozole and letrozole (which compete for the enzyme) {{have been shown to be}} more effective than anti-estrogen medications such as tamoxifen likely because they prevent the formation of estradiol.|$|E
2500|$|NET is {{made from}} estr-4-ene-3,17-dione (bolandione), {{which in turn is}} {{synthesized}} by partial reduction of the aromatic region of the 3-O-methyl ether of <b>estrone</b> with lithium in liquid ammonia, and simultaneously of the keto group at C17 to a hydroxy group, which is then oxidized back to a keto group by chromium trioxide in acetic acid. The congugated [...] C4-C5 olefin and the carbonyl group at C3 is then transformed to dienol ethyl ether using ethyl orthoformate. The obtained product is ethynylated by acetylene in the presence of potassium tert-butoxide. After HCl hydrolysis of the formed O-potassium derivative, during which the enol ether is also hydrolyzed, and the remaining double bond is shifted, the desired NET is obtained.|$|E
2500|$|In 1929, Adolf Butenandt and Edward Adelbert Doisy {{independently}} {{isolated and}} purified <b>estrone,</b> the first estrogen to be discovered. Thereafter, {{the pace of}} hormonal drug research accelerated. The [...] "first orally effective estrogen", Emmenin, derived from the late-pregnancy urine of Canadian women, was introduced in 1930 by Collip and Ayerst Laboratories. Estrogens have poor oral bioavailability and prior {{to the development of}} micronization could not be given orally, but the urine was found to contain estriol glucuronide, which is absorbed orally and becomes active in the body after hydrolysis. Scientists continued to search for new sources of estrogen because of concerns associated with the practicality of introducing the drug into the market. At the same time, a German pharmaceutical drug company, Schering, formulated a similar product as Emmenin called Progynon that was introduced to German women to treat menopausal symptoms.|$|E
