50|$|The {{original}} AM/MW transmitter {{was installed}} in New York before 1972 and consisted of two 25,000-watt Collins units and a Collins combiner, giving the station a potential 50 kW AM signal. The MW signal was broadcast from a centre-fed <b>horizontal</b> <b>antenna</b> slung between the fore and aft masts, a design {{similar to those used}} by Radio Veronica and later Laser 558. The station normally ran at 35 kW until late 1976, when it was decided to operate just one transmitter at a time, keeping the other in reserve. In 1985, Keith York's repair of the combiner enabled the two Collins units to be run together again, resulting in a large mailbag from Turkey, Crete, Greece, and Cyprus, areas the Voice of Peace message hadn't reached for nine years. After these AM transmitters became unserviceable, a Canadian Nautel 10 kW AM transmitter was installed.|$|E

A 125-foot mast to support the broadcasting antenna coupled to two 10,000 watts LTV-Continental Electronics (CEMCO) transmitters was then assembled and installed. The transmitters had been flown in from the factory at Dallas, Texas in six thousand parts. The original antenna design called for fore and aft masts with a <b>horizontal</b> <b>antenna</b> slung between (as on Radio Veronica's ship Borkum Riff). However, final design was an inverted V supported by the single foremast, forming a folded unipole antenna.

The vertical monopole antenna beam patterns are controlled by reconfigurable frequency selective reflectors (RFSR) technique.

The r. m. s. noise voltage in the receivers was several times greater than the thermal agitation noise in the electrode-ta-sea water resistance of 4 ohms. Electromagnetic induction from turbulence induced by water flow past the electrodes may be a contribution to the excess noise.

40|$|A {{technique}} is presented for measuring ocean wave directional spectra from aircraft using microwave Doppler radar. The technique involves backscattering coherent microwave radiation from {{a patch of}} sea surface which is small compared to dominant ocean wavelengths in the antenna look direction, and large compared to these lengths in the perpendicular (azimuthal) direction. The mean Doppler shift of the return signal measured over short time intervals {{is proportional to the}} mean sea surface velocity of the illuminated patch. Variable sea surface velocities induced by wave motion therefore produce time-varying Doppler shifts in the received signal. The large azimuthal dimension of the patch implies that these variations must be produced by surface waves traveling near the <b>horizontal</b> <b>antenna</b> look direction thus allowing determination of the direction of wave travel. Linear wave theory is used to convert the measured velocities into ocean wave spectral densities. Spectra measured simultaneously with this technique and two laser profilometers, and nearly simultaneous with this technique and two laser profilometers, and nearly simultaneous with a surface buoy, are presented. Applications and limitations of this airborne Doppler technique are discussed...|$|E
